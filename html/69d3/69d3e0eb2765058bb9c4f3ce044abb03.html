 THE 12TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS WILL LEAD CONSTRUCTION TO VICTORY--ON
 UNDERSTANDING AND MASTERY OF THE LAWS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 pp 2-6
 [Article by RED FLAG commentator]
 [Text]  In his recent talks with Comrade Kim Il-song, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
 said:  "The role of the 12th congress is the same as that of our party's
 7th congress.  The 7th congress led the revolution to victory; the 12th
 congress will lead our construction to-victory."  This is a correct summary
 of the historical roles of the 7th and 12th congresses.
 As for the view that the seventh congress led the revolution to victory,
 this has been proved by history and no comrade in our party disagrees with
 this view.  However, are there good reasons for the judgment that the 12th
 congress will lead our construction to victory?   What reasons is this view
 based on?  Is it sufficiently well founded?  In the first part of his speech
 at the 12th congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang answered these questions.  In his
 opening speech at the congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:  "Com-
 pared with the time when the eighth congress was held, our party's under-
 standing of the law of our country's socialist construction is now much
 deeper, our experiences are much richer and our consciousness and steadfast-
 ness in implementing and carrying out our correct policies has been greatly
 heightened."  Viewed from the implementation of the party's correct line and
 its series of principles,'policies and measures, the question of what reasons
 form the basis of our judgment that the 12th congress will lead the construc-
 tion to victory is precisely the question of whether we understand and grasp
 the law of socialist construction.
 In his "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" Lenin said:  "As in any scien-
 tific field, in the epistemological field, we should also think in a dialec-
 tical manner.  This means that we should not think that our understanding is
 fixed and will not change in the slightest; on the contrary, we should
 analyze by what means we can turn ourselves from knowing nothing to knowing
 something and from having an incorrect understanding to having a relatively
 correct understanding."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 14, pp 98-99)
 In the initial period following the founding of the PRC, our party led the
 people of all nationalities throughout the country to achieve, step by step,

 the transition from new democracy to socialism, rapidly recovered the
 national economy, began economic construction in a planned manner and
 basically completed the socialist transformation of the private ownership
 of the means of production in nearly all the areas in our country.  The
 sober understanding of the social structure of China and of the trend of
 historical development enabled our party to creatively chart a path of
 socialist transformation suited to the special features of China.  However,
 at that time, we knew very little about the law of socialist construction.
 This has now greatly changed.  The first part of the report to the 12th
 congress expounds, from the angles of ideology, politics, organization,
 economy, cultural and educational undertakings, military affairs and party
 building, on the tremendous achievements we have scored since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in bringing order out of chaos in
 our actual work and in making a clear distinction between the rights and
 wrongs of our guiding ideology.  Through summing up the rich experience of
 the past 30 years, our understanding of the law of socialist construction in
 China has already undergone a process from being incomplete and incorrect to
 being comparatively complete and correct.  Compared with the time when the
 eighth congress was held, our understanding is indeed much deeper and more
 correct.  No law can be understood and mastered at a single stroke.  No one
 has ever been able to see through and skillfully master the internal rela-
 tionships of things at first sight.  This has never been possible.  However,
 we can now safely say with pleasure that our understanding and mastery of
 the law of socialist construction has already in the main undergone a
 process from knowing nothing to knowing something and from incomplete,
 incorrect understanding to comparatively complete, correct understanding.
 This process cannot be plain sailing.  Often there are many twists and turns
 including the struggle between correct and erroneous ideas and the struggle
 of correct ideas to overcome errors.   Just as Comrade Mao Zedong said in
 1962 at the enlarged central work conference:  "During the period of demo-
 cratic revolution, only after comparing the two victories and two defeats
 could we understand the objective reality in China. On the eve of and
 during the war of resistance against Japan, I wrote some articles, such as
 'Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War,' 'On Protracted War,'
 'On New Democracy' and 'Introduction to the Communist,' and drafted some
 documents on policies and tactics for the Central Committee.  In all these
 writings, I summed up our revolutionary experiences.  These articles and
 .documents could only be produced at that time, not earlier, because pre-
 viously we had not gone through the great storms of the two victories and
 failures and had not gained sufficient experience; therefore we could not
 have understood the law of the Chinese revolution."  Similarly, "we must
 also undergo a process before we can understand the law of socialist con-
 struction.  We must proceed from practice and gradually undergo the change
 from having no experience to having some experience and from having rela-
 tively less to having relatively more experience.  In this way, our under-
 standing will leave the realm of necessity in which we do not understand
 socialist construction.  We will gradually overcome our blindness, under-
 stand objective law, thus obtaining freedom and enabling our understanding
 to enter the realm of freedom."  "We should be prepared to suffer many
 setbacks and failures caused by our ignorance of the law in order to obtain
 experiences which will enable us to achieve final victory."

 Law is invisible and untouchable, and we can understand and master it only
 in practice.  If we act in accordance with law in practice, we will win
 victory.  This will be beneficial to our understanding and mastery of the
 law.  If we run counter to law in practice, we will suffer defeat.  This
 will also help us understand and master the law.
 In discussing his book entitled "Questions Concerning the Soviet Socialist
 Economy" Stalin said:  "When a law has not been violated, it remains idle
 and no one knows where it is.  It exists everywhere, but we do not know
 its existence."  "Generally speaking, a law can only be felt when it is
 violated, but violation of the law will inevitably bring about evils."
 Here he expounded on the idea that the punishment that people incur when
 they go against the law enables them to draw lessons from their failure.
 We find many such examples in people's daily life.  For instance, when
 there is enough air, we do not feel the existence of air or its indispensa-
 bility to our survival.  However, when we are shut in a room where there is
 not enough air, we will find it difficult to breathe, and then, it is very
 easy for us to realize that air is essential for our survival.  In order to
 understand objective laws, we need negative experience as well as positive
 experience.
 In a country like China, which is populous and has a long and complicated
 history, while leading revolution and construction, we cannot but make
 repeated comparisons of victory and failure in order to understand and
 master the law'of revolution and construction.  Only thus can we complete
 the process from knowing nothing to knowing something and from incorrect
 to comparatively correct understanding.
 For every communist, it is a very severe challenge to adopt a proper atti-
 tude toward victory and especially toward failures.  Our party and many
 comrades have the experience of being carried away by victory, losing their
 modesty and prudence.  What should we do when we suffer a failure?  We
 firmly oppose the practice of wavering, becoming dejected, deserting or
 even betraying the revolution because of failure.  When the great revolu-
 tion in 1927 failed, many comrades died heroically.  They are heroes and
 deserve to be called communist fighters.  We must always remember them and
 learn from them.  Under Chiang Kai-shek's White terror, there were also
 some people who became dejected, and lost faith in the revolution.  Some of
 these people dropped out of the revolutionary ranks or retired from public
 life.  Others published confessions in Kuomintang newspapers and some
 others even became traitors.  Purging the party of those who betrayed it
 will make our party stronger, purer and more combatworthy.  Moreover, we
 have to'handle correctly the problem of how we should treat those comrades
 who are still loyal to the revolution but have committed mistakes.  We do
 not approve the adoption of any absolute attitude toward these comrades or
 the practice of being satisfied merely with putting the blame on a few
 individuals and holding them responsible for the failure.   On the contrary,
 we should act in the way that Comrade Mao Zedong told us.   We should concen-
 trate our efforts on analyzing the background in which the mistakes were
 committed,. the details of the mistakes and their social, historical and
 ideological sources, and adopt the policy of learning from past mistakes to

 avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient.  It is a
 very unworthy "revolutionary" who becomes dejected, resorts to complaining
 and reproaching, is querulous and even refuses to carry out revolution any
 longer when the revolution suffers temporary setbacks.  At the 11th con-
 gress-of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik), Lenin said that the
 proletariat was not apprehensive of acknowledging the things that it had
 not done satisfactorily in its revolutionary cause as well as the things
 that it had done satisfactorily.  He said:  "We are not afraid to speak
 out about our weak points and we are capable of learning to overcome our
 weak points."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 33, p 275)  When we suffer
 a failure we should conscientiously sum up our experiences and resume work
 from the very beginning in amore prudent and persistent manner.  Only this
 constitutes the revolutionary work style we communists must have.
 In 1957 our country entered the period of all-round socialist construction.
 Since then, we have achieved great successes, but have also committed some
 mistakes, such as the expansion of the scope of the anti-rightist movement,
 the "Great Leap Forward," "struggle against right deviation" and especially
 the "Great Cultural Revolution" which lasted a decade and brought about the
 most serious setbacks and losses since the founding of our country.  Our
 victories and failures have repeatedly educated us.  The mistakes, setbacks
 and losses caused by our violation of the law of socialist construction
 have made us especially conscious of the importance of understanding and
 mastering the law and enabled us to draw even more profound lessons related
 to the understanding and mastery of the law.  It is precisely because of
 repeated comparison between the victories we achieved and the failures we
 suffered after the 8th party congress that this 12th party congress was able
 to sum up the experiences of our victories, draw lessons from our failures,
 obtain relatively comprehensive views conforming to objective laws and
 formulate a correct line and a series of correct principles, policies and
 measures.
 It is always the case that at first, only a few people understand and
 master the law; later, a relatively large number of people do so; and still
 later, most people begin to, do so.  It was Comrade Liu Shaoqi in Yanan who
 stated for the first time that we should respect the minority.  This is an
 important idea that we have drawn from the historical experience of the
 Chinese revolution.  Within our party, the law that governs the Chinese
 revolution was first understood and mastered by Comrade Mao Zedong and some
 other comrades of the old generation of revolutionaries.  At first, there
 were only a few of these people.  However, could the majority of the com-
 rades within our party accept this correct understanding immediately,
 turning it into the common wealth of all the comrades in our party, without
 personally and repeatedly drawing lessons from both positive and negative
 experiences?  Obviously, this was not the case.  Our practice has already
 proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's understanding of the law of Chinese revolu-
 tion and his ideas about the Chinese revolution are correct.  Why, then, was
 he excluded from the central leading group after 1930 and especially after
 the time when the Provisional CPC Central Committee moved to the central
 soviet area?  This was because at that time, most of the leading cadres did

 anti-encirclement struggle and at the Zunyi conference when most of the
 leading cadres recalled the victories achieved under the leadership of
 Comrade Mao Zedong and earnestly drew lessons from both positive and nega-
 tive experiences that they began to admit that Comrade Mao Zedong was
 correct, and clearly acknowledged his leading position in the Red Army and
 the CPC Central Committee.  It was only after the Zunyi.conference and
 after the historical turning point which followed it that we began to
 achieve one victory after another in our democratic revolution and finally
 established the PRC.  During the 30 and more years since the founding of
 the PRC, our understanding of the law of socialist construction has been
 deepening and improving step by step.  The CPC Central Committee concen-
 trated the correct understanding of all the comrades in our party and led
 our construction cause from victory to victory.  The party Central Committee
 itself is a collective.  Due to the fact that Comrade Chen Yun has been
 engaged in economic work fora long time, it is appropriate to say that he
 is one of the first people to understand the law governing important issues
 in socialist economic construction.  The speech delivered by Comrade Chen
 Yun at the Eighth CPC Congress in 1956 was extensively praised inside the
 party.  However, after the campaigns of the "Big Leap Forward" and "opposing
 right deviations," his. correct ideas on economic problems-no longer worked.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the llth,CPC Central Committee, some
 strategic decisions and important measures proposed by Comrade Chen Yun
 have been accepted by the central authorities and have been proved to be
 more and more effective in practical work.  Thus, most of our comrades pro-
 foundly realize that they should learn from Comrade Chen Yun's methods for
 observing economic phenomenon and handling economic problems.  The new party
 constitution adopted by the 12th party congress makes a clear stipulation
 on the issue of respecting the minority.  Our party forbids any form of
 personality cult.  We should ensure that the activities of party leaders
 are supervised by the people and at the same time uphold the prestige of
 leaders who represent the people's interests.  Every party member and cadre
 must resolutely carry out in their actions the decisions of the Central
 Committee and the party organizations, but at the same time, be allowed to
 have reservations and present their opinions to the party organizations,
 and even to the Central Committee.  Our organizational principle is that
 the individual should be subordinate to the organization, the minority
 subordinate to the majority, the lower level subordinate to the higher level
 and the whole party subordinate to its national congress and its Central
 Committee; but at the same time the opinion of the minority should be
 respected.  In discussing and making decisions on problems, party organiza-
 tions should conscientiously consider the different opinions of the minority.
 By so doing we will be able to overcome our one-sidedness.
 Marx and Engels said in their "Holy Family" that historical movements con-
 stitute the cause of the masses and that along with the deepening of
 historical movements the ranks of the masses will inevitably expand.  The
 process of historical development is precisely the process of the expansion
 of the ranks of the masses who understand and master the law of social
 development.   The victory of the socialist cause has greatly promoted the
 progress of this development and has opened up a wide sphere for the broad
 masses of people to master Marxism--the most scientific and revolutionary

 theory--and thus become the masters of history.  However, the masses of
 people cannot master the law of socialist society spontaneously.  What has
 been proved by our practice is that in order to make the masses really
 master the correct line, principles and policies we should carry out the
 iecessar4j propaganda, education and other work to enlighten them. This
 work should be carried out by adopting diversified methods in order to make
 it popular and acceptable, enabling us to guide the masses toward under-
 standing and mastering the law through their personal experience.
 It can be said that in all periods our cadres at all levels and on all
 fronts underwent positive and negative education and tests.  What is
 especially heartening is that the college graduates and the cadres of simi-.
 lar educational standard whom we have trained since the founding of the
 PRC have grown up with the socialist, cause.  These people are at the prime
 of their life, know their profession well and have undergone positive and
 negative education and tests.  Our cadres and our people are continuously
 making efforts to understand and master the law of socialist construction
 and an increasingly large number of them will become the conscious masters
 of the development process of history.  This will enable them to play an
 increasingly important role in the development of our cause.
 In his article entitled "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War,"
 Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that we should study the law of war, the law
 of the revolutionary war and the law of the Chinese revolutionary war.  This
 means that we should study the problems related to the general and specific
 laws governing various categories and subcategories of wars.  Similarly, we
 should also realize that we must study the law of construction, the law of
 socialist construction and the law of China's socialist construction.  All
 the experiences that have been drawn on from the construction of other
 countries, especially that of other socialist countries, are important for
 us.  We should assimilate the part of these experiences useful to us as
 reference.  We should also enrich these experiences and develop them.`
 However, we will be bound to fail if we mechanically copy these experiences.
 In the past, we copied the experiences of Soviet socialist construction.
 During the past few years, quite a few of our comrades affirm, without
 analysis, the experiences of certain foreign countries, but fail to pay
 attention to understanding and mastering the experience of China's socialist
 construction or to proceeding from China's reality.  In his opening speech
 at the 12th congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:   "To integrate the uni-
 versal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of China, blaze a path
 of our own and build socialism with Chinese characteristics--this is the
 basic conclusion we have reached in summing up our long, historical experi-
 ence."  We should continue to research deeper into the general law of con-
 struction and of socialist construction.  However, we should not be satis-
 fied with the mere understanding of these general laws.  We must understand
 and master the specific performance of these laws under China's conditions
 and we must understand and master the special laws governing China's social-
 ist construction in different periods and spheres.
 Our party is one which upholds struggle and action and a party characterized
 by the integration of theory and practice.  Our understanding of objective

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 laws is not only aimed at gaining the ability to talk about, or obtain
 academic knowledge of them.  For communists, the correct understanding of
 objective laws is aimed at observing the requirements of objective laws to
 make revolutionary changes to the world and lead the people to promote the
 development of history.  Therefore, our correct understanding of these laws
 must lead to the formulation'of the correct line, principles and policies
 and to the action of leading the masses of people, through our party, to
 implement them.
 It is precisely because we have to combine our understanding with the
 conscious activities of the masses, in creating history that having
 mastered the theory, we should return to practice and apply the theory to
 our actions.  Therefore, it is insufficient to have only a general line.
 We must also solve the problems concerning the actual implementation of
 the general line on various fronts and in all the areas of our work.  This
 is an important difference between the 12th congress and the 8th congress.
 The line formulated by the 8th congress was correct, though it was not
 clear, definite or perfect.  However, the concrete measures for imple-
 menting this line on all fronts and in all areas of our work had not yet
 been discussed at that time.  At the enlarged central work conference,
 Comrade Mao Zedong said that in carrying out both revolution and construc-
 tion our party must have a wholly convincing general line suited to objec-
 tive conditions.  However, we had also to formulate, under the guidance of,
 the general line, a series of appropriate and concrete principles, policies
 and methods related to our work in all fields including industry, agricul-
 ture, commerce, education, military affairs, politics and party affairs.
 Only when we had formulated these principles, policies and methods, could
 we educate our cadres and masses, unify their understanding and enable
 them to do their jobs well.  These words remain completely correct even
 today.  The reason why the seventh congress led the revolution to victory
 is because it formulated not only a general line for the new democratic
 revolution, but also a series of principles, policies and methods for
 actually carrying out this general line on all fronts and in all our work.
 This enabled us to unify the thoughts and actions of the whole party after
 the seventh congress and quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek.  The report to the
 12th congress puts forward our party's general task in the new historical
 period, that is, "to unite the people of all our nationalities to work hard
 and independently to achieve, step by step, the. modernization of our indus-
 try, agriculture, national defense and science and technology and to make
 China a 'culturally advanced and highly democratic socialist country."
 With regard to the understanding and mastery of the law of socialist con-
 struction, we have undergone the process from knowing nothing to knowing
 something and from incorrect to comparatively correct understanding.  We
 have experienced both victory and defeat in this respect and have summed
 up both positive and negative experiences.  More and more of our cadres and
 people have come to understand and master this law to varying degrees.  In
 practice, we have gradually come to understand the law of socialist con-
 struction in general and the special law governing Chinese socialist
 construction.  We have a more definite and complete general line and have
 worked out a series of guiding principles, policies and methods suitable

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 to various fronts, quarters and work.  All of this guarantees that we will
 win still greater victory in our cause.
 When discussing commanding battles, Comrade Mao Zedong said that the reason
 why people make mistakes in commanding battles is that their deployment and
 command in war and battles are not suited to the conditions of the time and
 place, and their subjective guidance is not suited to actual objective con-
 ditions; in other words, they fail to solve the contradiction between the
 subjective and the objective.  For a revolutionary, solving the contradic-
 tion between the subjective and the objective is a very important task.  It
 is inevitable that people will have different levels of ability.  Mili-
 tarily, doing a good job requires more victories and less defeats.                       For any
 party or individual, there is never complete accordance between the sub-
 jective and the objective.  However, it is possible to achieve relative or
 basic accordance between them.  If this is achieved, we will be basically,
 or on the whole, correct.  Our understanding and mastery of the law of
 socialist construction will be further perfected and corrected in our
 practice.  Just because of this, we can ensure that we will commit few
 mistakes or avoid committing big mistakes and that we will discover and
 correct our mistakes. quickly.
 In short, at present, our party, our party Central Committee and most of our
 cadres have a deeper understanding of the law governing our country's
 socialist construction compared with the period of the Eighth CPC Congress.
 Thus, we may conclude that the view that the 12th CPC Congress will lead
 construction to victory is expressed on a completely scientific. basis.  We
 shoulder the great task of the creation of a:.-..new overall situation in our
 socialist modernization.  Let us continue to enrich and deepen our under-
 standing of the law of socialist construction in order to score new histori-
 cal achievements and new victories!

 COMMUNISTS MUST STRICTLY OBSERVE PARTY DISCIPLINE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 pp 7-10, 37
 [Article by Zhang Yun [4545 5686]]
 [Text] From the day a man gets his Communist Party membership, he is not
 exempt from the necessity of.observing the following regulations:  "Indi-
 vidual party members are subordinate to the party organization, the minority
 is subordinate to the majority, lower party organizations are subordinate to
 the higher party organizations, and all the constituent organizations and
 members of the party are subordinate to the national congress and the
 Central Committee of the party."  These four regulations are, on the one
 hand, the basic principle of the party's system of democratic centralism.
 They are, moreover, the iron discipline built on the base of the party
 members' high degree of consciousness.  With Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong
 Thought as its guide to action, the CPC relies on this organizational prin-
 ciple and discipline to keep the ranks in good order and in step and
 ensure the implementation of the party's line, principles and policies in
 different historical periods.  In this way, the CPC leads the people of the
 whole country to overcome the difficulties and hardships on our road and
 to continuously win new revolutionary and construction victories.  In July
 1982, at a seminar, Comrade Deng Xiaoping rightly pointed out:  "Without
 discipline, it is impossible to dedicate ourselves heart and soul to the
 same cause.  In the past, we'relied on discipline to start a revolution.
 The discipline we relied on was a discipline based on political conscious-
 ness.  Since the founding of the CPC, this has been the best practice."
 The new party constitution passed by the 12th CPC National Congress imposed
 strict ideological, political and organizational demands on party members
 and cadres.  These demands are stricter than the ones imposed by the former
 party constitutions.  The new party constitution has placed the problem of
 strengthening party discipline in an extremely important position and has
 made some important new provisions.  These have important significance for
 .the party in power in the new historical period.
 To Conscientiously Observe Discipline Is an Expression of Strong Party Spirit
 The general program of the new party constitution makes the adherence to
 democratic centralism as "one of the three essential requirements" that must

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 be achieved in order to "strengthen party building, carry forward the
 party's fine traditions and enhance the party's combat strength."  In addi-
 tion, it demands that, within the party, democracy be given full play, a
 high degree of centralism be practiced on the base of democracy and a sense
 of organization and discipline be strengthened, so as to ensure unity of
 action throughout its ranks and the prompt and effective implementation of
 its decisions.  Chapter I of the party constitution clearly stipulates that
 party members should "accept the party's program and constitution," and
 should also, "join and work actively in one of the party's organizations,
 carry out the party's decisions and pay membership dues regularly," "con-
 scientiously observe party discipline and the laws of the state."  Chapter
 VII of the party constitution clearly stipulates that "a Communist Party
 member must consciously act within the bounds of party discipline."  In
 addition, it has made concrete provisions for the maintenance of party
 discipline.  The question of whether or not the provisions of the new party
 constitution are being strictly implemented is closely related to the ques-
 tion of whether the Marxist-Leninist principles of party building and party
 organization are being adhered to and of what our party is being built into.
 All comrades must take this large problem seriously.  We must most cer-
 tainly not trivialize it.
 We all know that as early as 1902 to 1904, when Lenin started to build the
 Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (later, it was changed to the CPSU),
 he was engaged in a heated debate with Martov on the question of what kind
 of party should be built.  At that time, Lenin and his comrades-in-arms
 defended the Marxist principle of the party's role, adhered to the ideas
 that the party had to be the, advanced, conscientious and organized vanguard
 of the working class and that only those who accepted the party's program,
 supported the party materially and joined in one of the party organizations
 could become party members.   He strongly opposed recruiting those who
 accepted the party's program but were unwilling to join in one of the party
 organizations and who did not, in fact, observe discipline, as members.  The
 clique represented by Martov agreed that to accept the party program and to
 support the party materially should be the necessary condition for member-
 ship, but they did not accept that joining one of the party organizations
 and observing party discipline should also be a condition for membership.
 To counter the worship by people like Martov of the spontaneity of the labor
 movement and their attempting to appease the Russian intellectuals.' fear of
 the proletarian sense of discipline and organization, Lenin clearly pointed
 out:  "In the end, it is a matter of choosing between two alternatives:
 consistent application of the principle of organization, or the sanctifica-
 tion of disunity and anarchy."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 1, p 456)
 The debate over the organizational principle for party. building ended in
 the victory of Lenin's correct views and stand.  The Bolshevik Party, which
 was built in accordance with Lenin's principle of party building, through
 arduous struggles, succeeded in gaining victory in the October Revolution
 and thus ushered in a new era in human history.
 Our party was built in accordance with Lenin's principle of party building.
 In his essay, "On the People's Democratid Dictatorship," Comrade Mao Zedong
 tells us that our party has "three principal weapons to defeat the enemy."

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 The first of these is:  "a well disciplined party, armed with the theory of
 Marxism-Leninism and using the method of self-criticism, which is linked to
 the masses of the people."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 4, p 1417)
 In addition, of the four notable characteristics of the party, he puts
 "disciplined" in the first place.  In the crucial moment of the third
 revolutionary civil war period, Comrade Mao Zedong's mobilization order,
 with its unique style, placed "strengthening the sense of discipline" side
 by side with "the troops' advancing and one inch of growth in production"
 and considered them the necessary conditions for "constant and regular
 victory in revolution."  The now widely known "The Three Main Rules of
 Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention" song emphasizes from the
 start, that "victory can be won only by keeping in step."  Our party has
 successfully led China's revolution and construction from victory to victory.
 This fact cannot be separated from our party's adherence to Lenin's prin-
 ciple of party building and strengthening the sense of organization and
 discipline.
 Every party member should, through the study of party history and the study
 of Lenin's and Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of party building, particularly
 the discussions on discipline, strengthen his understanding of the tre-
 mendous importance of party discipline.  He should establish the firm con-
 cept of discipline and thoroughly understand that adherence to democratic
 centralism and the strengthening of party discipline is the key to organi-
 zationally maintaining and consolidating the party's high degree of polit-
 ical and ideological consistency, implementing the correct line, principles
 and policies of the party and promoting the party's combat strength.  An
 important aspect in strengthening the training on the party members' party
 spirit is to continuously strengthen our sense of organization and dis-
 cipline in revolutionary practice.  Through conscientious observance of
 party discipline, our strong party spirit is shown.  Only those who can
 achieve this can be called qualified Communist Party members.  Those who
 disregard organization and discipline and stick to their old ways of doing
 things are not qualified to be Communist Party members.  They cannot remain
 in the party.
 Set Strict Demands With Regard to Major Issues and Do Not Deviate From
 Standards With Regard to Minor Issues
 The discipline that should be observed by Communist Party members includes
 many things and there are many aspects to it.  However, we can summarize it
 in two points:   1) what should be done, what is allowed to be done; 2) what
 should not be done and what is not allowed to?be done.  That means, we must
 conscientiously exert all our strength to do things beneficial to our party,
 the state and the people in accordance with the party's resolutions and
 demands.  Moreover, we should also influence and mobilize other people to do
 the same thing.  All the things which are not beneficial to the party, state
 and people must be those things not allowed by party discipline and the laws
 of the state, so we should resolutely not do them.  In addition, we should
 supervise and warn other people not to do them and be brave in the struggle
 against the acts which violate party discipline and laws of the state.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 On this point, the problem of how to handle major and minor issues should be
 emphatically discussed.
 Basically, the major concern of a Communist Party member is to unswervingly
 adhere to the demands of the "admission oath," keep a firm proletarian
 revolutionary stand and dedicate his life to struggling for the implementa-
 tion of the communist ideal.  At the present stage, the major issue is to
 adhere to the socialist road, people's democratic dictatorship, leadership
 of the party and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, to keep political
 consistency with the Central Committee and to unswervingly implement the
 party's line, principles and policies since the 3d Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee, especially the program to create a new situa-
 tion in all fields of socialist modernization passed by the 12th CPC
 National Congress.  It is necessary to protect the unity and unification
 of the party in the same way we protect our eyes, strictly observe the
 party constitution and the "Guiding Principles for Inner-Party Political
 Life" and struggle against all unhealthy tendencies inside the party and
 acts which violate party discipline and laws of the state and which
 endanger the party's cause.  If a Communist Party member can make strict
 demands on himself in these major issues and not be influenced by his own
 emotions and the prevailing tendencies, he has observed the party's dis-
 cipline in the political sense.
 The party demands that every party member take a:-,strong stand on major
 issues.  In addition, he should also be careful about minor issues.  For
 instance, everybody must straighten their ideological style, work style
 and life style, manage love, marriage and family life well, be upright and
 fair in handling people and business, under no circumstances commit crooked
 acts, refrain from the vulgar "study of connections," not pursue privileged
 living and not become corrupt, degenerate and so on.  In other words, with
 regard to minor issues, it is also necessary to set "strict demands on our-
 selves" and not deviate from the standards of the party constitution and
 the "principles."
 With regard to the major and minor issues, one is primary and the other
 secondary, but there is not a sharp line of demarcation between the two,
 they are interlinked.  In the past, there was a popular saying:  "A gentle-
 man disregards the minor issues."  It seems that as long as things are not
 going too badly with the major issues, it is all right and the minor issues
 are of little importance so it is not necessary to be too strict.  Some
 find the excuse of "no gold is 100 percent pure, no man is perfect" to
 console themselves and have 'an easy conscience in "disregarding the minor
 issues."  This is incorrect.
 1.  We materialists accept the objective fact that "no gold is 100 percent
 pure and no man is correct."  In selecting and appointing people to posts,
 it is correct "not to discard a huge piece of timber just because one inch
 of it is rotten."  Our comrades should be "lenient and forgiving in treat-
 ing people" and not be too testy and critical.  But, every party member
 should "set strict demands on himself," not be satisfied with being
 "basically qualified" or "barely qualified," compare himself with others

 and spur himself on to a high standard and become a qualified Communist
 Party member.  This is certainly possible.  The countless revolutionary
 martyrs are our models.  The emerging advanced people on all fronts are
 also good models for us to follow.  Is there any reason not to strive in
 this direction?!
 2.  As far as development is concerned, small things can become great.
 "If a small hole is not mended, it becomes a big hole with a diameter of
 1.5 chi," "one ant hole may cause the collapse of a thousand-li dike,"
 such sayings vividly depict the importance of checking erroneous ideas at
 the outset.  Inside our party, there are people who become morally degen-
 erate.  This starts with their "disregarding the minor issues."  We have
 enough of such lessons.  It is hard to imagine a Communist Party member
 having a dual personality, being devoted heart and soul to public interests
 in political life, but in private life being heart and soul devoted to
 private interest.  In other words, he has no communist morality in his life,
 he is infected with the foul odor of the extreme individualism of the
 exploiting class, his valley of greed can never be filled, he leads a fast
 life.  However, in political life, faced with major issues of right and
 wrong, he takes a clear-cut stand and devotes his life to implementing the
 communist ideal.   Like water and fire, these two are incompatible, how can
 they "peacefully coexist"?
 3.  Our party is based in society and party members carry out their activ-
 ities among the masses.  The party's image formed in people's minds and the
 party's prestige determine whether the party's line, principles and poli-
 cies are correct and whether they are advantageous to people.  In addition,
 to a great extent they determine the activities of the party organizations
 at all levels and the performance of every party member.  The masses not
 only "listen to their words" but also "observe their behavior."  If the
 party organizations at all levels and every party member can meet the
 demands imposed by the party:  proceed from the people's interests in all
 aspects, '.'be the first to be concerned about what should be worried about
 and be the last to enjoy themselves," think what the masses think about,
 be eager to meet the needs of the people and play an exemplary and leading
 role in all aspects, fear neither hardship nor death in upholding the cause
 of the party and the people, persistently think and act in one and the same
 way and be as good as their word, then, the people would wholeheartedly love
 and support the party and forever follow the party.  However, if the party
 organizations, and party members do not act in accordance with the party's
 demands, or even act in ways contrary to the party's demands, use discipline
 to deal with people but do not themselves keep within its bounds, speak in
 high-flown phraseology but fail to carry out their pledges, at every turn
 think of themselves before others and not be concerned about the people's
 welfare and suffering, "strive for fame in the central government and
 strive for wealth when they are out of it," have much interest in acting
 like high officials and overbearing bureaucrats and seriously cut them-
 selves off from the masses, then, what remains of the party's prestige
 among the masses?  Under such conditions, all magnificent ideals and plans
 cannot be realized.  Thus, speaking of keeping the close ties between the
 party and the masses, it is necessary for party members to pay attention

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 to both the major and minor issues and to conscientiously observe party
 discipline in both aspects.
 Stride To Form Habits So That They Become Natural to You
 Many of our old party members have a commun understanding that it is not
 difficult to observe discipline in doing something once, but it is diffi-
 cult'to observe discipline under all circumstances and conditions every-
 where and at any time.  But, this is exactly what the party and the masses
 require of us, which means it is necessary for us to play an exemplary role
 in observing discipline everywhere and at any time.  What shall we do?  The
 most importait thing is to strengthen the training of party spirit, estab-
 lish a firm concept of discipline, continuously promote our consciousness
 in observing discipline and strive to form a habit so that it becomes
 natural to us.  In my 57 years of revolutionary practice, I have tried to
 find an answer. My conclusion is that principally it is necessary to make
 vigorous efforts in the following aspects:
 1.  Know the rules.  It is necessary to vigorously grasp study, strive to
 familiarize ourselves with the party's program, the party constitution and
 the party's concrete rules and regulations (for instance, the "Guiding
 Principles for Inner-Party Political Life" and others), the line, prin-
 ciples and policies of the party, the resolutions, provisions and system
 of the party in all aspects, strive to have a pretty good idea of them and
 to speak and act in accordance with them.  Otherwise, we can have no idea
 of what is right, what is wrong, what can be done and what cannot be done.
 In such a case, we are blind.  We do not have anything to follow in doing
 or saying things.  We are like a blind man who walks on the road.  He bumps
 into a wall or falls on the ground, but he does not know why.  In this way,
 how can we have consciousness in observing discipline and how can we play
 an exemplary role in observing discipline?
 2.  "Be watchful over oneself when one is alone."  This is a piece of
 Confucian jargon from Chinese history, which means:  Even when one is alone,
 one should be careful and observe moral principles.  In his work "How To Be
 a Good Communist" Comrade Liu Shaoqi made use of this piece of jargon, he
 demanded that every Communist Party member:  "Even when he is working on
 his own without supervision and is therefore in a position to do something
 bad, is just as 'watchful over himself when he is alone."'  In the period of
 the revolutionary war and in the 30 years since the founding of the PRC,
 many facts tell us that normally, when a party member violates discipline,
 he is not engaged in collective activities, or being watched by people
 everywhere.  A party member violates discipline when he leaves the collec-
 tive, when he carries out a task alone or when he is temporarily not under
 the supervision of the organization and his comrades.  This tells us that
 under the latter conditions, it is all the more necessary for our party
 members to have firm revolutionary conduct and consciousness in observing
 discipline.  Otherwise, it is easy for us to do something wrong.  Exactly
 for this reason, we should strengthen ideology, consciousness and organiza-
 tion discipline training and cultivation so as to enable our party members
 to act the same whether alone or in living in the collective and to act the

 same way whether they are free of supervision or whether they are being
 supervised by the organization or the comrades.   In the Ming dynasty,
 Yu Qian wrote a poem "Song of Limestone."  The poem said that people
 should be like limestone, which is not afraid of being ground to dust
 althdugh it is hammered thousands of times and burned.  As a result, lime-
 stone keeps its whiteness and purity.  We communists can do not only that,
 we should be able to do better.
 3.  Self-examination.  That means, it is necessary to master Marxist-
 Leninist weapon of criticism and self-criticism.  Just as every day we wash
 our face and sweep the ground, we should always examine our conscience, see
 if we have performed acts and said things which violate party discipline
 and in an open-minded fashion ask for and listen to the opinions of others
 and welcome the supervision of the organization and the comrades.  When-
 ever we discover our shortcomings and faults, we should determinedly
 correct them at once and should absolutely never shield them.  The "Resolu-
 tion on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding
 of the PRC" passed by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Com-
 mittee is an example of the communists' being practical and realistic in
 carrying out self-criticism.  "It is not easy to rectify the party spirit,
 but it is even more difficult to carry out self-examination."  When Comrade
 Chen Yi was still alive, he had a deep understanding of this problem.  In
 his two poems "Qigu:  The Hands Do Not Extend" and "Revealing My Mind on
 My 63rd Birthday," he talked of the proper attitude one should have in
 self-examination.  What he said were words from the bottom of his heart.
 "Whenever I discover my mistakes, I am delighted and I am enlightened when
 I have painstakingly corrected them," "the best policy is to have courage,
 correct the mistakes and march forward again."  ("Selected Poems and Songs
 of Chen Yi," People's Literary Publishing House, pp 89, 328, 330)  When we
 carry out self-criticism, we should have such an attitude.
 Make persistent efforts to know the rules, be watchful over ourselves when
 we are alone and criticize ourselves.  In this way, we cannot feel that we
 are incompatible with the party's discipline and are unaccustomed to it.
 On the contrary, we can take the observance of discipline for granted and
 gradually form a habit so that it comes naturally to us.  In this way, we
 can march from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom.
 At present, we are building a high level of. material civilization.  We
 should also strive to build a high level of socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.   "Observance of discipline" is an important content in building a
 spiritual civilization.  Lenin said:  "Every new social order demands new
 relations between man and man, a new discipline....  With the beginning of
 the socialist revolution, discipline must be built on entirely new prin-
 ciples; it must be a discipline of faith in the organizing power of the
 workers and poor peasants, a discipline of comradeship, a discipline of the
 utmost mutual respect, a discipline of independence and initiative in the
 struggle."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 27, p 481)  In our building of
 socialist spiritual civilization, it is necessary to establish and observe
 such discipline.  When there is such discipline and when all of us observe
 such discipline, we can have normal party political life and normal

 political life in the entire state,  we can have a stable and united polit-
 ical situation and good social order, we can fully promote the creativity
 and initiative of all the people and we can make the people and all the
 comrades of the party bravely march with one heart and one mind in the
 direction of building a modernized socialist state under the unified leader-
 ship of the Central Committee.  Thus, Communist Party members should be the
 first.to achieve what we ask the masses to achieve and the Communist Party
 members should resolutely not do what we ask the people not to do.  In
 other words, if the Communist Party members want to be the vanguard of the
 construction of spiritual civilization, they must first of all strictly
 observe party discipline.
 The 12th CPC National Congress has sounded the bugle call to create a new
 situation in all fields of socialist modernization.  In order to more
 vigorously lead the people of the entire country to implement this magnifi-
 cent program in the new period, our party will carry out an overall recti-
 fication of the work style and organization of the party.  One of the
 important issues in party rectification is to further strengthen the party
 members' sense of discipline and sense of organization.  I am an old member
 of the party, I am old and ailing like a candle flickering in the wind, but
 my heart is as stout as ever and I am unwilling to lag behind.  I am willing
 to accept an overall examination of the party together with other comrades
 of the party.  In addition, I will, in accordance with the demands of the
 new party constitution, continue to strengthen the study of theory and
 training of party spirit so as to uphold my revolutionary integrity in my
 later years and make myself worthy of the name of a Communist Party member.
 In observing party discipline, I am willing to encourage and.supervise and
 be encouraged and supervised so as to strive together with other party
 members to play an exemplary role in observing discipline.

 HAVE LOFTY IDEALS, GOOD MORALITY AND KNOWLEDGE, OBSERVE DISCIPLINE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 pp 11-15
 [Article by Jia Chunfeng [6328 2504 1496]; passages within slantlines
 published in boldface]
 [Text] In his report to the 12th CPC Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang raised
 socialist spiritual civilization with communist ideology as its core as an
 important characteristic of the socialist system and strategically expounded
 the position and role of building spiritual civilization in the building of
 socialism.  At the same time, he profoundly elaborated the two aspects of
 building spiritual civilization, that is, the dialectical relations of
 cultural and ideological building.  This undoubtedly has great signifi-
 cance on the theory and practice of scientific socialism.
 Like social civilization, spiritual civilization is a historical process of
 continuous development.   By civilization, we mean the progress level and
 state of human society, including the two component parts of material
 civilization and spiritual civilization.  We often talk about developed
 education, prosperous science, flourishing culture, and people's high
 political consciousness, firm belief and ideals,-lofty morality and senti-
 ments, devoted spirit, enhancement of sense of discipline and so on.  These
 are all the manifestation of spiritual civilization.  Before the emergence
 of the socialist system, spiritual civilization under the three kinds of
 social systems--slave, feudal and capitalist--were divided into class by
 private ownership and society and was restricted by the existence of
 exploitation.  Therefore, it is inevitable that they have their historical
 and class limitations.  Socialist society is a completely new stage in the
 development of human history.  Under the socialist system, we are not only
 capable of inheriting all the outstanding achievements of culture and social
 morality of the past, but also capable of establishing an entirely new
 spiritual civilization which is fundamentally different than that of any
 former period.  To. sum up, this new type of socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion is to train and bring up socialist new people with revolutionary
 ideals, morality, discipline and culture, among which revolutionary ideals
 are the spiritual mainstay, revolutionary morality is the norm, revolu-
 tionary discipline is an indispensable guarantee and culture is an important
 condition.  The close integration and mutual complement of these aspects
 commonly indicates the requirements of the basic economic and political

 system of socialism on the political consciousness, spiritual state, moral
 features and cultural cultivation of its social members.
 /The spiritual state of our country and people is judged, first of all, by
 whether or not our people have revolutionary ideals and are encouraged by
 these ideals, and vigorously and effectively engage in the building of the
 socialist cause./  Ideals are people's social political standpoint and
 their world outlook centrally manifested in their fighting objective.  It
 shows that people cherish and yearn for the glorious future.  Different eras
 and classes have different world outlooks and people have different ideals.
 The proletariat is the most advanced and revolutionary class in human
 history.'  Communism--the great ideal of the proletariat and its vanguard,
 the communist party--reflects the inevitable trend of the development of
 history.   Therefore, it has the greatest calling and mobilizing strength.
 The great ideal of communism will surely be attained.  Thie is an objective
 law independent of man's will.  But the road toward communism is arduous and
 tortuous.  Whenever the revolutionary cause of the proletariat suffers
 temporary setbacks and needs most the encouragement of revolutionary ideals,
 there are usually some weak-willed people who waver in communist ideals and
 bring about a sense of illusion.  This is a repeated phenomenon in the
 history of revolution.  Meanwhile, historical facts teach us again and
 again. that those who give up communist idealism at a time when the revolu-
 tion suffers setbacks and fall behind the revolutionary ranks will certainly
 be eliminated by the historical trend.  Only by adhering to revolutionary
 ideals and inspiring revolutionary enthusiasm can we once again follow the
 revolutionary cause and march toward the glorious future.  Whether in
 revolutionary success and development or during temporary revolutionary set-
 backs, our veteran party members and revolutionaries adhere to communist
 ideals and have great determination, are fearless of sacrifice, plunge
 through fire and water and fight heroically to attain this ideal.  Today,
 inspired and encouraged by this great ideal, the broad masses of party mem-
 bers and people are also using their creative work and labor to do their
 little bit to build communism.  Historical and present facts have effec-
 tively proved that communist ideals are the powerful ideological strength
 for the victory of the people's liberation cause, and are the spiritual
 mainstay of the solidarity and militancy, hearts and minds of our people
 and country and the  revolutionary soul fostering the continuous develop-
 ment of our socialist cause and opening up a bright future.
 Morality is closely related to ideals; to have ideals is to have morality.'
 A country full of revolutionary idealism is bound to have revolutionary
 morality and customs.  A man fostered with revolutionary ideals will con-
 sciously conform his deeds with revolutionary morality.  On the contrary,
 those with illusions usually forfeit morality./  Ideology, principles or
 morals are not without foundation.  Their emergence and development all have
 a profound social economic root.  Communist morality is determined by the
 class status, class nature and historical tasks of the proletariat.   It is
 impossible to expect every social member to be a communist at the present
 stage.  But our socialist system is based on public ownership which regards
 the highest stage of communism as its objective.  Therefore, we must ener-
 getically propagate and propose that the whole society use communist morality

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 as a norm of action for adjusting relations between men and between man and
 society.  It is also imperative to educate party and league members and all
 advanced elements with communist morality and through them educate and
 influence the broad masses.  The basic principle of communist morality is
 the principle of collectivism loyal to the communist cause; the devoted
 spirit of serving the people and a communist labor attitude.  This principle
 expects people to insist that the interests of the people and the socialist
 motherland be superior to the interests of the individual, and whenever they
 contradict, the interests of the individual should unconditionally be sub-
 ject to the interests of the people and the state.  This principle also
 demands that people unite as one, help and love each other, fight and
 advance together, respect and enjoy comforts after others, find pleasure
 in helping people and sacrifice one's own interests for the sake of the
 people, masses and public in their work, labor and social life.  All these
 have manifested in various respects the principle of collectivism that
 people should adopt toward the interests, cause and activities of the whole.
 Morality covers a lot of ground; it includes professional morality of vari-
 ous trades and professions.  Engels once pointed out:   As a matter of fact,
 each class and each trade has its own morality."  ("Selected Works of Marx
 and Engels," Vol 4, p 236)  Professional morality is a summarization of the
 norm of behavior of people's own peculiar work and labor engaged in a cer-
 tain profession.  This type of morality has the characteristics of certain
 concrete professions or trade activities.  Different professional morality
 reflects the professional psychology, habits, tradition and responsibility
 formed according to different professions and trades and represents certain
 differences of moral behavior and consciousness caused by different profes-
 sions and trades.  Professional morality is related to the development of
 the division of labor in society and has a long formation and developmental
 history.  In our country, professional morality is a necessary complement
 and concreteness of the principle and norm of our, revolutionary morality.
 In the past few years, along with the work of bringing order out of chaos
 in the field of moral ethics in our country and along with the development
 and restoration of the fine tradition and work style of our party and
 country, professional morality in various trades and professions is being
 established and perfected under the unified guidance and influence of the
 principle of communist morality, such as service regulations in service
 trades, village rules and regulations in rural areas, scientific moral
 standards for scientific and technological workers, regulations for literary
 and art workers and so on.  Our socialist modernization cause is a cause of a
 whole that is complicated and coordinated.  With its different methods, each
 profession joins with the entire socialist modernization cause and serves
 the entire socialist cause and the people.  Society has its special require-
 ments for the various professions.                       Professional morality determines the
 specific responsibility the people of different professions must undertake
 in the entire socialist modernization cause.  This is favorable for impelling
 the sense of honor and dedication of people to hold fast at their posts, to
 bind people to observe certain professional order and discipline, to
 encourage people to,unite and cooperate, perfect their skills and gain
 professional proficiency, and to raise their working capability and effi-
 ciency, and labor techniques and efficiency.                         Facts show that under the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 guidance of the principle of communist morality, proceeding from the needs
 of the profession and meeting the concrete conditions and accepting the
 capability of the profession, and by adopting easy and effective, vivid
 and vital methods, the professional morality formulated and perfected by
 the various trades and professions has and will play a greater role in
 developing socialist spiritual civilization, thus further attaining the
 stability and unity of society and doing a good job in the building of all
 fields of socialist modernization.
 /Revolutionary discipline is a manifestation and guarantee for revolutionary
 ideals and morality.  There is unity in having ideals, morality and observing
 discipline, whereas forfeiting ideals, degenerating morality and violating
 the law and discipline are also grouped together./  This is a truth of real
 life.  Anyone who sabotages social morality must be censured by public
 opinion and when the case has developed to a certain seriousness, he must
 be punished according to state law and discipline.  Legality, discipline
 and morality belong to the category of the norm of behavior.  Morality
 depends on public opinion, people's faith, traditional customs and educa-
 tional influences to maintain and exert its role; whereas state law and
 discipline depend on administrative execution and compulsory means to main-
 tain and exert their role.  These two roles complement each other in
 society; neither can do without the other.  The realization of revolutionary
 ideals and the exertion of revolutionary morality are both guaranteed by law
 and discipline.  Our party, army and people have always had the tradition of
 observing discipline.  What do the unity and powerful fighting capacity of
 our party and the implementation of the party's principles and policies
 depend on?  One of the most important factors is firm discipline.  Our fine
 tradition of observing discipline was seriously sabotaged in the 10 years of
 internal disorder.  The building of socialist spiritual civilization carried
 out at present is precisely for the purpose of resuming and promoting this
 fine tradition.  There is party, political and military discipline; there
 is discipline for each factory, production team, shop, school, leading organ
 and mass organization, and there is also professional discipline for all
 trades and professions.  Freedom and discipline are unity of opposites.
 This is also the case with right and duty; none of them must be separated.
 Our people enjoy freedom and rights within the limits of the constitution
 and law, but they must also be consciously bound by discipline.  Only in
 this way can the whole society be a coordinated whole unit, can all parts
 of society organically cooperate with each other and form into a fine pro-
 duction, work, study and life order and ensure the smooth progress of the
 building of socialist modernization.
 /Knowledge is an important aspect in the substance of socialist spiritual
 civilization and also an important condition for forming scientific ideals
 and belief, lofty moral sentiments and a conscious sense of discipline./  We
 cannot build socialism or attain the lofty ideal of communism by relying on
 illiterate or semi-illiterate people.  Long ago Engels said that the social-
 ist cause of the proletariat needed lawyers, "and also doctors, engineers,
 chemists, agronomists and other specialized personnel, because we must not
 only administer the political apparatus, but also administer the entire
 social production.   Therefore, what we need is not beautiful words but

 abundant knowledge."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 22, p 487)
 Marx and Engels specially stressed that only by developing education can we
 train people who are developed in an all-round way.  Lenin pointed out:  "We
 must build socialism by retaining all the culture left over by capitalism.
 We must retain all the science, technology, knowledge and art.  Without
 these, we cannot build communist society."  ("Collected Works of Lenin,"
 Vol 4, p 348)  Stalin once sneered at the innocent mood of praising their
 own illiteracy and sharply pointed out:  "I hold that we simply cannot make
 any progress without eliminating these savage and uncivilized phenomena and
 the savage attitude toward science and learned people.  The working class
 cannot genuinely become masters of their country if they do'not free them-
 selves from illiteracy, bring up their own intellectuals, master science and
 manage the economy according to scientific principles."  ("Collected Works
 of Stalin," Vol 11, p 64)  The building of socialist modernization has put
 a higher demand on the people's level of cultural and scientific knowledge.
 Without constantly raising the level of scientific knowledge of the whole
 society, it will be impossible to attain the grand objective of building
 modernization, it also will be unfavorable to the formation, consolidation
 and development of scientific ideals and belief and revolutionary morality.
 With-knowledge, people can thoroughly understand the law of social develop-
 ment,.consciously master scientific world outlook and methodology and be
 developed in an all-round manner.  To be sure, while developing culture and
 raising the educational level of the people, we must adhere to the guidance
 of Marxist scientific theory, and eradicate the influence of capitalist,
 feudal and reactionary decadent culture.  In the light of class struggle
 still existing within certain limits in our society, class struggle in the
 international field will inevitably find expression in our country.  The
 serious cultural smuggling is a phenomenon not to be ignored.  The decadent
 culture of capitalism, such as films, cassettes, periodicals,. photographs,
 records and so on with brutal, reactionary, degenerate and obscene sub-
 stance is bound to contaminate our social mood, poison the people's souls
 and cause revolutionary idealism to waver, corrode revolutionary morality
 and disintegrate revolutionary discipline.  To resist the corrosion of
 capitalist and reactionary culture is necessary in order to safeguard and
 develop the basic economic and political system of socialism and build
 socialist spiritual civilization and enable people to have ideals, morality,
 culture and to observe discipline.
 In our socialist society, the system of exploitation no longer exists.  In
 the means of production, public ownership has replaced private ownership.
 We have attained the principle of distribution according to work and the
 fundamental interests of the whole people coincide.  This determines that
 our people can increasingly form common revolutionary ideals, morality and
 discipline and consciously develop culture in the whole society.  But this
 does not mean that the establishment of the basic economic and political
 system of socialism will enable the whole society and every member of
 society to spontaneously have such common revolutionary ideals, morality
 and discipline and spontaneously maintain it forever.  In order to enable
 more and more members of society to become laborers with ideals, morality,
 culture and who observe discipline, we must. consciously carry out a series
 of painstaking and untiring efforts when confronting new conditions and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 problems emerging at any time.  We must clarify muddled ideas and erroneous
 understanding of some people in their ideals, morality, discipline and
 culture.
 /It is necessary to understand the relationship between adhering to com-
 munist ideals and morality and carrying out the present economic policy./
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we have
 adopted the policy of opening to the outside world and enlivening the
 domestic economy.  Facts have proved that by carrying out this policy, we
 have achieved marked results in vigorously developing our national economy.
 We must fully affirm this achievement.  But, we must also be fully aware
 that "opening" and "enlivening" has put forward a new question on adhering
 to the education of communist ideals and morality.  For example, some
 people say:  "Idealism is vague and remote; it is better to be practical!"
 To these people, preaching idealism is but empty words; it is not as good
 as having benefits, such as bonuses, housing and furniture.  Is communism
 remote and an empty thing?  As a social system, the complete realization of
 communism is, of course, a future matter.  But as a movement, it started
 long ago with the founding of our party and the consequent new democratic
 revolution carried out throughout the nation.  At present, we have developed
 to the initial stage of communism--socialist society.  The work and life of
 each of us are closely related with the gradual realization of communist
 ideal.  From this point of view, communism is not a vague and remote thing
 that is within sight but beyond reach, but closely linked with the destiny
 of each family and individual.  With regard to "benefit," we certainly do,
 not reject personal benefit.  We have always stressed giving consideration
 to the state, collective and individual.  But here we have a problem of how
 to correctly put in the relationship between present and future, individual
 and society, and the state, collective and individual.  If we reject com-
 munist ideals and engage in "everything for the purpose of money," advocate
 the so-called "people die for wealth, and birds die for food" and infuse
 our minds with egoism, then we will lose our ability to resist sugar-
 coated bullets, confuse our objective and forfeit our revolutionary will
 and fighting strength; all kinds of unhealthy tendencies and dishonest
 practices will expand and the phenomena that only existed in the old society
 will be revived.   In this way, the whole society forfeits its revolutionary
 vigor and vitality.  How then can we guarantee the socialist orientation in
 the building of modernization?
 Our present economic policy, formulated and executed under the guidance of
 communist ideals and world outlook, is a concrete step and measure for
 attaining the great objective of communism.  These two do not contradict
 but complement each other.  We should neither immediately implement policy
 for the higher stage of communism, just because we practice the communist
 ideological system, nor abandon communist ideological education because we
 are implementing the present economic policy.
 /It is necessary to correctly handle the relations,-.between discipline and
 creativity./  With regard to enhancing discipline, some people think that it
 binds people's creativity and is incompatible with people's initiative and
 enthusiasm.   Marxism holds that man's creativity and discipline are closely
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 connected--"perfect when both combine and suffer when both depart."  It is
 inevitable for man living in a certain society to have this or that kind of
 social relationship with other people.  In the course of changing the
 objective world, if a man needs freedom to exert his initiative and
 creativity, there must be certain bounds for his words and deeds; that is#
 there must be certain discipline to restrict any improper freedom.  Other-
 wise, people's social activities will not be ensured, their genuine
 creativity and initiative cannot be fully exerted or may even be offset
 and strangled.  Discipline exists in every social system.  It has different
 nature and conditions in different social systems.  Just as Lenin said:
 Any new social system requires a new relationship and discipline between
 men.  From the beginning of the socialist revolution, discipline should be
 built on a new basis.  This is a discipline of comradeship, of each
 respecting the other and of exerting initiative and creativity in the
 midst of struggle.  Some people feel it difficult to understand the prac-
 tice of regarding revolutionary discipline as the main content of socialist
 spiritual civilization.  In fact, the realization of revolutionary ideals
 requires that the potential wisdom and capability of the people be tapped
 to the greatest extent and that their initiative, creativity and devoted
 spirit be brought into full play.  It will be impossible to attain the
 grand objective of communism without this initiative and creativity, which
 is guaranteed by organizational discipline.  Therefore, whether our sense
 of discipline is firm or not is an important part in judging a man's
 spiritual mood; and whether our social discipline is strict or not is
 another important aspect in measuring the state of spiritual civilization
 of a society.
 Socialism is a movement that advances toward communism.  This movement can-
 not be conducted by merely increasing material wealth.  We must concentrate
 forces in developing socialist economy and do a good job in the building of
 material civilization.  But we cannot set sights only on material and not
 on man.  In the final analysis, the purpose for developing our socialist
 economy is for man and not material.  It is absolutely true that material
 wealth can make people happy, but it can also degenerate them.  The crux of
 the matter is to'do a good job in building socialist spiritual civilization
 and make great efforts to enable our people to have ideals, morality,
 culture and to observe discipline.  This is a lofty task.  All our party
 members, league members, advanced elements and members of society must
 consciously shoulder this historical task.  Let us start now and from our-
 self and influence and lead the people aroud us to make the greatest efforts
 in building a high level of socialist spiritual civilization.

 EXCERPTS FROM SPEECHES AT A FORUM ON STUDYING THE DOCUMENTS OF THE 12TH CPC

 Lu Jiaxi [4151 0857 6932]:  "Strengthen Unity and Coordination, Do a Good
 Job in Scientific Research"
 The socialist scientific cause is an important component part of socialist
 spiritual civilization.  Development of our scientific, cultural and other
 causes will not only greatly help along the building of socialist material
 civilization, but will also remarkably enhance auralevel of. spiritual
 civilization.   Therefore, every person working in our scientific research
 departments is a builder of the socialist spiritual civilization.
 How to more strongly push ahead the scientific cause under the socialist
 system?  To achieve this, we can only depend on our superior socialist
 system and our socialist consciousness.  We must unite as one, share work
 and cooperate with one another under the unified leadership of the party,
 thus giving full play to our efficiency with our limited manpower and
 material resources.
 Now, our number one headache is the disputes over trifles among our com-
 rades and the practices of shirking responsibility, pushing it onto one
 another.  This is an obstacle to the realization of our common goal and a
 negative factor which goes against communist ideology.  In the case of the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences, endless haggling and shifts of responsibility
 are'reflected in two areas, concerning external and internal relations,
 respectively.

 Let us deal with the external relations first.  Everyone knows that our
 country's professional scientific research contingent is composed of five
 different sectors--industry, national defense, local scientific research
 bodies, institutes of higher learning and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
 In the 1950's, these five sectors had cooperated well.  At that time, with
 Premier Zhou as our chief commander, Chairman Mao as our pilot who devised
 strategies in light of the overall situation, and Comrades Chen Yi and Nie
 Rongzhen as our direct leaders, successively, all of us worked with one
 heart and one mind and achieved great successes.  Why could we quickly
 reap remarkable results in tackling the grand project of "A bomb, H bomb
 and satellite" in the early 1960's?  I think that this was mainly because
 all of us had united and pooled our efforts under a common aim instead of
 disputing over trifles and pushing responsibility onto one another, thus
 dispersing our force.  This was really a good lesson which deserves to be
 learned.  However, the "Great Cultural Revolution" destroyed this trend
 of unity and coordination.  Today, when we are making our efforts to
 create a new situation in all fields of socialist modernization, we should
 try our best to resume the fine style which was prevalent at that time.
 Ownership by the department.. cannot be adopted in scientific research.  A
 single department or unit, for example, a scientific research unit or an
 educational unit or any other department, cannot possibly do the whole job
 ranging from basic theoretical studies to application, popularization and
 mass production of research results.  Only when the five sectors make con-
 certed efforts can each individual, each department and each system effec-
 tively play its own role in the collective division of work and thus over=
 come difficulties one after another.  If we do nothing about the practice
 of endless haggling and shifts of responsibility and retain ownership by
 department, we can hardly achieve anything in our scientific research.   I
 truly found that in order to solve this problem, we must strengthen the
 building of socialist spiritual civilization in our contingent.  And, first
 of all, our comrades who are holding leading posts should arm themselves
 with communist ideology.  Although we are facing problems concerning the
 system and some defects existing in the working system and regulations, in
 specific policies and in other fields, we should not blame all problems on
 the system.  Without the guidance of a good ideology, even a good system
 can hardly work.  Although we oppose the tendency to effect the transition
 to communism prematurely, we should still always advocate communist style,
 communist morality and communist ideology.
 Now, let us talk about the internal relations.  In a meeting, Comrade Hu.
 Yaobang said:  The Academy of Sciences should mainly be run by you scien-
 tists.  All of you should pool your efforts. This is a problem which really
 deserves attention.  According to my understanding, such joint efforts
 concern several aspects, namely, technical research, professional work
 management, administration, party work and ideological and political work.
 If all these works do not center around a common aim and are carried out
 separately, the practice of disputing over trifles and pushing responsi-
 bility onto one another will prevail.  Of course, these aspects are differ-
 ent from one another in terms of the division of work, their specializations
 and the importance of their roles; and these are differences between

 I
 individuals in their ability.  This is a normal phenomenon.  However, all
 departments and all individuals have a common goal, a common ideal and a
 common guiding ideology, and all our works center around a common key link.
 It is this common faith that links us together to fight for victory.  I
 think that in order to solve the problem of disputing over trifles and
 shirking responsibility, all of us must first strive for our common goal
 and arrange our work around the central task; second, we must courageously
 shoulder heavy loads and tackle key problems, or willingly play minor roles
 to assist main roles to complete key tasks; and third, we must respect,
 support and help one another.  In brief, one of the principal roles of our
 ideological and political work is to function as the bond among our com-
 rades and a catalyst in our cause.
 Peng Peiyun [1756 3805 0061]:  "Education Is an Essential Prerequisite for
 Building Material and Spiritual Civilization"
 It was pointed out in the report to the 12th CPC Congress that education
 and science are key points of strategic importance in economic development
 as well as an important aspect of socialist spiritual civilization.  This
 was the first time in our party's history that such importance was attached
 to education.  We comrades working on the front of educational work, warmly
 hail. the correct program laid down by the 12th congress and are determined
 to strive to create a new situation in the educational cause.
 In the last few years, more and more comrades have acknowledged the position
 and the role of education in socialist modernization.  So far, however,
 some'comrades still attach importance to economic work alone while overlook-
 ing education, or just schedule educational development behind economic
 development.  They do not know that although educational development is
 restrained by economy, education may, in its turn, have a tremendous reac-
 tion on economic development.  From a long-term point of view, the success
 or failure of education will have an important bearing on the overall situa-
 tion of the socialist modernization construction and on our nation's future.
 Unaware of this, we will inevitably commit historical mistakes.  The report
 to the 12th CPC Congress stated:  "The key link to the four modernizations
 rests on the modernization of science and technology."  And education is the
 foundation for the cultivation of scientific and technical personnel.  In
 order to develop the economy and improve economic returns, we need an
 adequate number of skilled workers, scientific and technical personnel and
 administrative staff with socialist consciousness.  And, in order to build
 the socialist spiritual civilization, we need a massive contingent of
 intellectuals.  All these rely on the popularization and enhancement of
 education.  Today, in investing "expenditures" in education, we are just
 aiming at cultivating a labor force of high quality, so that this force
 will be able to play a greater part in production in the future.  As the
 most fundamental capital construction of a country, education needs a long
 turnover cycle. Therefore, it must go ahead of other undertakings in our
 socialist construction and prepare a reserve of qualified personnel during
 the first 10 years for a new economic restoration in the next 10 years.

 The report to the 12th CPC Congress pointed out that the popularization of
 education is the essential prerequisite for building material and spiritual
 civilization.  This statement touches the core of the problem.  To raise
 the Scientific and cultural standards of our whole nation, we must start
 with primary education.  As long as primary education is not popularized,
 new illiterates will keep on emerging.  If the quality of primary education
 fails to improve, the quality of secondary and higher education will
 inevitably be affected, and thus a vicious circle within the educational
 field will take shape.   As the popularization of education is a "matter of
 prime importance" which has a direct effect on the destiny of the whole
 nation, it must be dealt with conscientiously.
 In order to adapt to and serve economic construction more effectively, our
 educational work must undergo readjustment and reform step by step and in a
 planned way, and a. socialist educational system with Chinese features must
 be gradually established.  We are now planning to concentrate our efforts
 for a while on educational work in rural areas.  Our country has a popula-
 tion of 1 billion, of which 800 million are living in rural areas.  Since
 agriculture will be the strategic key point of economic development in the
 next 20 years, how to adapt educational work in rural areas to the needs of
 rural socialist construction and cultivate a new generation of peasants
 with socialist consciousness, culture and production skills is a very
 important problem which badly needs to be solved.  In the past, we did not
 pay enough attention to the studies of educational work in rural areas.
 This is a shortcoming which should be overcome.  At present, our major task
 is to vigorously popularize primary education and carry out structural
 reform of secondary education.  The student recruitment system and the
 graduates distribution system in those institutes of higher learning and
 secondary technical schools which mainly aim at meeting the needs of rural
 areas should also be reformed, so that students from rural areas can find
 their way back to their hometowns.
 The readjustment and reform of higher education involve very arduous tasks
 and very complicated problems.  We are considering concentrating our efforts
 on the following matters:  working out the plan for cultivating qualified
 personnel, and readjusting various proportions so as to adapt to the needs
 of the economic and social development; setting up different systems of and
 various requirements for higher education, adopting different forms of
 running schools, actively developing unconventional educational forms such
 as television schools, broadcasting schools, correspondence schools and so
 on; reorganizing liberal education so that it can help better in economic
 construction, political work and the building of spiritual civilization
 and can provide a contingent of revolutionary, young, educated and profes-
 sionally competent cadres.
 All schools of various categories at various levels throughout the country
 must further improve their teaching quality and adhere to the principle of
 all-round development in moral, intellectual and physical education.  We
 must, particularly at present, emphasize educating the vast number of
 students with communist ideology so as to enable them to resist the corro-
 sion of bourgeois ideology, see through erroneous ideas of every description

 and thus.grow into a new generation of communists in the new situation when
 the policy of opening the door to the outside world and enlivening the
 economy at home is being carried out.  We educational workers must fully
 realize that we are shouldering an especially glorious and important
 mission of providing youngsters with communist ideological education and
 that, being both Red and expert, we must impart knowledge as well as
 educate people.
 In order to create a new situation in educational work, we must also
 enhance our revolutionary vigor, improve our efficiency, go deep into the
 reality of life and work in a down-to-earth manner.  At the same time, we
 hope that the party and government leading comrades of various departments
 in various places can put educational work on the important agenda, just as
 they have done with agriculture, energy production and communications, and
 seriously investigate and solve various problems existing in education work.
 At present, they should particularly assist in reorganizing the leading
 bodies of the educational system; select those "experts" who are enthusiastic
 about and are familiar with educational work, to hold the leading posts;
 try every means to increase educational funds and improve the conditions of
 schools; further implement the policy toward intellectuals, enhance the
 social status of teachers and improve their living and working conditions
 so as to more effectively mobilize the initiative of the vast number of
 teaching and administrative staff.  Since our country's educational cause
 is large in scale, and since the state cannot take care of everything, we
 have to mobilize the whole society to engage in the job.  At the same time,
 we must work out the relevant principles and policies and some basic rules
 and regulations so as to ensure that all areas of society can play more
 active roles under the unified planning of the state.
 Zhang Guanghou [1728 1684 0624]:  "Cultivate Scientific and Technical
 Personnel With Communist Ideology"
 In his report to the 12th CPC Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang set the building
 of a high degree of socialist spiritual civilization as a strategic guide-
 line for socialist construction.                    This was a very correct and necessary
 decision.  Here I would like to talk about my understanding of the building
 of socialist spiritual civilization from the viewpoint of the cultivation of
 qualified personnel.
 The key to the four modernizations is modernization in science and tech-
 nology.  To fulfill this task, we need to cultivate a vast number of
 scientific and technical personnel.  I am a researcher in basic mathematical
 theories.  Is it enough for me to just do a good job in my own field?  In
 view of the course of struggle of some accomplished mathematicians and my
 own experience, I truly realize that one's accomplishments are the fruits
 of many factors.  These factors can be generally classified into three
 aspects, namely, moral, intellectual and physical education.  I am not
 going to talk about the role of physical education here.  As far as morality
 and intelligence are concerned, all our accomplished predecessors were not
 only equipped with an enviable and rich store of knowledge, but also with
 moral integrity, which is worth being followed.  In fact, it was the latter
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 which enabled them to build their rich store of knowledge and to make great
 contributions.  It is one-sided or even wrong to simply attribute their
 achievements to chance and their gifts such as intelligence, talent and
 luck. Take me as an example.  Is it simply because I have had a rather
 solid foundation in mathematics that I have been able to engage in mathe-
 matic studies and thus have achieved certain successes?  The answer is no.
 I was born into a worker's family and led a very poor life in the old
 society. I began to work as a child laborer in the Kailuan coal mine when
 I was .8 or 9 years old.  At that time, I never thought about or, to put it
 bluntly, could not possibly think about studying mathematics.  My highest
 goal at that time was nothing more than to become a technical worker in the
 coal mine.  However, my poor living in the old society led to my hard-
 working spirit and tenacious character.  After liberation, I had the
 opportunity to go to junior secondary school.  Although I began to be inter-
 ested in mathematics then, I did not think about taking mathematic studies
 as my career.   I had only an idea in my mind: I am determined to devote my
 life to the party's revolutionary cause under the party's guidance; I will
 do anything with which the party entrusts me.  It was at that time that I
 laid down a solid foundation in politics and began to link my destiny with
 the party's cause.   Only when I went to senior secondary school did I make
 up my mind to devote my life to mathematics research for my motherland.
 But, on the other hand, I was also prepared to respond at any time to any
 call of the party.   I think that it was during the above three periods when
 I laid foundations in various aspects.   One's path is by no means smooth.
 Mishandling at a single link may have serious effects on one's lifetime
 cause.  When the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques were
 running amok, I bore pressure in my academic research due to the unfavorable
 political climate, as well as having faced seriously difficult working and
 living conditions.  The spiritual support which spurred me to carry on
 scientific studies was the communist ideal.  I understand that the party
 has paid very much for cultivating me.  So, I must not spend the people's
 money freely and just let my life slip idly by.  My own course of growth is
 a'good example to demonstrate the important role of socialist spiritual
 civilization in the cultivation of a qualified person.  In order to become
 a qualified person in the field of science and technology, one has to
 devote considerable effort to strengthening scientific and technological
 studies as well as improving political understanding.
 No matter what career in which we are engaging, the ideology guiding our
 work must be nothing other than communism.  Personal fame and gain., for
 example, can be an effective incentive to temporarily push one to work hard
 in scientific and technological. fields.  However, the effect of such an
 incentive cannot be sustained and is limited or even dangerous.  There are
 numerous examples to illustrate the bitter experiences in this respect.
 Because the socialist system has been founded and developed in our society
 under the communist ideological system, any nonproletarian ideology existing
 in our minds can actually conflict with reality.  If we uphold these wrong
 things instead of overcoming them with communist spirit, we will surely run
 into snags and be foiled everywhere.  Thus, we will not only take to evil
 ways politically, but will also be utterly disheartened since we will always
 suffer setbacks.  Only by arming ourselves with communist ideology can we
 ever,-keep our revolutionary spirit young.

 Li Yanjie [2621 3601 2638]:  "Educate the New Communist Generation in
 Proletarian Love"
 To build a high level of socialist spiritual civilization is a common task
 of the whole party and all the people of the country.  Teachers should be
 active propagandists of spiritual civilization and communist teachers
 should be more active and spontaneous propagandists because, first of all,
 we are communists and, second, teachers.  A teacher should possess the
 morality of a teacher and love his pupils and teach them knowledge and
 cultivate them, that is to say, he should cultivate a new communist gen-
 eration with proletarian love and get them to understand that the glorious
 cause is to liberate all mankind and that the best ideology is to fight all
 his life for the cause of communism.
 A communist teacher should not take teaching as a means for making his
 living.  He is a builder of spiritual civilization devoted to the cause of
 communism.  Having this understanding, he will perceive the sense of
 responsibility and will not only sit in his study writing books or teaching
 in the classroom, but will also be deeply rooted among the youth, attaching
 importance to their healthy growth.  As I told the life stories of Lu Xun
 and Wen Yiduo, I was frequently moved by their spirit of selflessness in
 the educational cause.  They were illuminating, like a burning candle, the
 road to advance for youth.  They could do it in the old society, which was
 an abyss of darkness, but why can we not do it in the socialist society?
 I am determined to take them as examples and strive to do more work for the
 people.  At present, apart from teaching in the classroom, I make public
 reports for the youth in order to make close contact with the young people
 and to absorb political nourishment from them.
 In recent years, I have received several hundred youths who came to visit me
 and 7,000 letters from them.  Through these contacts and correspondence, I
 have come to realize that although their hearts were heavily broken during
 the 10 years of turmoil, they are never demoralized and most of them are
 willing to follow the party and are ready to accept ideological education
 in communism.  Actually, the splendor of communist thought is shining among
 the advanced youth.  For instance, Zhang Jun from Shaanxi, only 19 years of
 age, seeing a powder magazine burst into flames, rushed to the fire on four
 occasions within 5-6 minutes and saved 86 bags of detonating powder.  Feng
 Jianhu, a telephone office worker from the railway department, is 20 years
 old.  One day, as he was working beside the railway, he suddenly discovered
 a small girl picking out unburned coal from among cinders along the track.
 .Meanwhile, a train was rapidly approaching the girl and was only 40 meters
 away.  At this critical moment, he raced against the train, took the child
 in his arms and came rolling away from the track together with her.  Thus,
 a life was saved from the jaws of death.  People consider him a figure like
 Ou Yanghai.
 Chinese youth possess revolutionary tradition.  In particular, since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, encouraging change has
 taken place in the political ideology among the youth.  Perplexed at the 10
 years of internal disorder, they have woken up and after pondering thiings'and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 making comparisons, have come, to realize that the CPC is great and have
 strengthened their ideal and faith in communism.  While some people have
 lost confidence in the rectification of bad party style, there is a student
 of 18, full of enthusiasm of fighting for communism, who joined the CPC.
 He expressed in unequivocal terms:  "I join the party because vice still
 exists in the world.  Why would we need the party if the whole world were
 bright?"  This is the "fresh blood of the party body," the new and healthy
 force that is capable of waging uncompromising struggles against vice in the
 party.
 As teachers and gardeners devoted to cultivating the new communist genera-
 tion, we should try by every possible means to contact the youth and be
 their bosom friends; the common things existing between them; educate them
 by having a definite object in view; discover their positive factors and
 encourage them to advance.  In the past few years, in connection with
 teaching classical literature, "making the past serve the present," I have
 inserted moral education in intellectual and aesthetic education.  I strive
 to adopt the method of "what is taken from the youth is used in the interest
 of the youth."  I cite the advanced deeds of the youth to compile books, to
 make reports and to encourage the youth in the school and in society to
 learn from each other.
 We should hold high the banner of the 12th CPC National Congress and unite
 more comrades with the view of doing a good ideological job for the youth.
 Recently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Municipal
 CYL Committee organized youth friendship training courses, and I am respon-
 sible for art education.  More than 100 propagandists from Beijing and other
 localities of the country joined these two training groups.  Since the
 study, all of us have made certain improvements ideologically, theoretically
 and in the art of lecturing.  There is a big number of socialist civiliza-
 tion building lecturers who will become friends of the youth and are to be
 welcomed by them.  We are also going to run well self-study universities
 under the party so that the present 250,000 students in training courses
 will become more socialist-minded and professionally proficient and more
 active builders of socialist spiritual civilization.
 Xu Xing [1776 5429]:  "Building Socialist Spiritual Civilization Corresponds
 to the Desire of the Party and People"
 We are'studying the 12th CPC Congress documents.  In the study, I profoundly
 perceive that politically and theoretically, the party Central Committee has
 thoroughly discussed the significance, role, content and key point of
 building socialist spiritual civilization and the important measures for
 promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization.  This has made
 our minds clearer and our vision broader.  Now, I initially review my study
 experiences in the following three points:
 1..  Comrade Hu Yaobang clearly pointed out in his report to the 12th CPC
 National Congress:  "Socialist spiritual civilization is an important
 characteristic of socialism and an important manifestation of the superiority
 of the socialist system."  I think that these two phrases can be considered
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 as a key point of important significance for building socialist spiritual
 civilization.  The expositions on building socialist spiritual civilization
 by the party Central Committee have enriched the theory of scientific
 socialism and have defined the core of communist ideology for socialist
 spiritual civilization.  The elimination of the system of exploitation and
 the establishment of the public ownership system for the means of produc-
 tion, distribution according to work, the development of national economy
 according to plan and proportion and the political power of the working
 class and laboring people are the characteristics of socialism.  This
 enables us to have an all-round and complete knowledge.  It can be consid-
 ered that only by completely and thoroughly understanding socialism can we
 be able to comprehend socialism, socialist spiritual civilization and the
 strategic significance of building a high level of socialist spiritual
 civilization in the socialist cause.  It is impossible to develop socialism
 without this spiritual civilization.
 2.  The strategic policy posed by the party Central Committee on simultane-
 ously building material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization
 corresponds to the desire and demand of the people as well as to the law
 of socialist development.   Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Central
 Committee, the party Central Committed. has led the people of the country to
 bring order out of chaos and has carried out a key change in the focus of
 party work.  This has provided-the pepple with .a definite orientation, goal,
 ideal and spiritual power and has aroused the people's enthusiasm and
 knowledge for creating a new life in the building of socialism.  Many
 advanced figures are seen in all fields.  They are characterized by their
 firm faith in the cause of communism or their spirit of devoting themselves
 to it, their patriotic and collective spirit of socialism, their communist
 spirit of sacrificing their own interests for the sake of others; they are
 so devoted to public service as to forget their own interests, attaching
 great importance to the public interest and protecting public ownership.
 This advanced ideology actually exists in our daily life and vigorously
 affects and changes the concept and spirit of the people, and brings
 along the whole society.  Numerous facts have proved that the building of
 socialist spiritual civilization accords with the desire of the party and
 people and is in line with the trend of history.
 3.  Now, our present task is to earnestly follow the orientation and track
 provided by the Central Committee and to carry forward more effectively the
 socialist spiritual civilization cause (including ideological and cultural
 undertakings) in accordance with the measures and demands put forward by.
 the 'Central Committee.  In this glorious undertaking, we propagandists,
 theoretical workers, educational workers, scientific workers, literary and
 art workers, journalists and publishing workers are shouldering very impor-
 tant tasks.  Under the leadership of the Central Committee, we should con-
 scientiously study the relations between the building of socialist spiritual
 civilization and the job of our departments, make clear the demands put to
 us by the spiritual civilization and understand how we can further improve
 our work, in accordance with the characteristics existing in the job of our
 department, in order to make due contributions to socialist spiritual
 civilization and to effectively avoid the unfavorable factors in socialist

 spiritual civilization which might emerge in work, and to resist the corro-
 sive influence of decadent factors.  Only thus will we have clearer ideas
 and under the unified plan of the party, make continuous efforts and strive
 to cultivate more members of society by converting them into laborers with
 ideals, morality, culture and discipline.
 Luo Guojie [5012 0948 2638]: "Strengthen Education in Communist Morality"
 The report of the 12th CPC Central Committee says that communist ideology
 is the core of socialist spiritual civilization.  Education in communist
 morality will play an important role in the building of socialist spiritual
 civilization.  Under socialist conditions, communist morality is the
 spiritual link for establishing new relations between the people.  Communist
 morality generally comprises five universal points of significance and the
 most important standards.  First, to wholeheartedly serve the people, that
 is, to ardently love the people, attach great importance to the people and
 proceed in all cases from the interests of the people.  Second, the com-
 munist attitude toward labor urges all laborers to take labor as a glorious
 task of a citizen and to observe labor discipline in order to make more
 contributions to socialist construction.  Third, to protect public property
 and to acquire the socialist concept of public property as sacred and
 inviolable.  Fourth, to adhere to science and the truth, to urge people to
 study hard, to acquire scientific theory and to persist in the truth and to
 develop it in practice.  Finally, to uphold socialist patriotism and inter-
 nationalism.  It urges people to protect the national dignity and national
 interest, and to link the national. interest with the general interests of
 the whole of mankind.  These several standards are indispensable to com-
 munist morality.
 We stress communist moral education because it is linked to the remolding
 of people's ideology under socialist conditions.  While building socialism,
 we must constantly improve people's material living standards and, at the
 same time, we should make our new generation people with ideals, morals,
 culture and discipline.  Only thus can we guarantee that socialist con-
 struction will not lose its way.  The building of material civilization is
 .an indispensable basis for the creation of spiritual civilization, but on
 no account must we consider that the building of spiritual civilization is
 of little importance.  Practical life will constantly and clearly show that
 if the people do not remold their ideology and cultivate lofty communist
 morality, it is entirely impossible to develop socialist modernization and
 to advance along the track toward a high level of communism.
 The undertaking of communist moral 'education must be integrated with the
 practical problems that people are facing in their work, study and labor,
 and they must be patiently and painstakingly inspired and guided..  Only
 thus'can sympathy for communist morality be aroused in the hearts of the
 people and can they understand the importance of heightening their morality,
 so that an increasing number of members of society can conscientiously bring
 their deeds in line with communist morality.

 Zhou Taihe [0719 1132 0735]:  "Strengthen and Perfect the Economic Respon-
 sibility System"
 In his opening speech at the 12th CPC National Congress, Comrade Deng
 Xiaoping called on the whole party,: for a time to come, four tasks have to
 be tightly grasped, and the reform of organs and economic systems must be
 considered as an important task.  The reform of the enterprise administra-
 tive system comprises an important part of the whole system reform.  In
 order to arouse the initiative of enterprises and laborers, the system of
 job responsibility must be implemented in management and administration in
 state-owned and collective enterprises.  In recent years, while imple-
 menting the eight character policy of national economic readjustment,
 restructuring, reorganization and upgrading, the economic responsibility
 system which has been carried out by the industrial enterprises in respon-
 sibility, power and profit, has achieved some results by enhancing the
 initiative of the enterprises, improving them and raising economic returns.
 In order to strengthen and perfect it, we hold that at present, the
 following questions have to be resolved:
 1.  The enterprises which are implementing the economic responsibility
 system must, first of all, strengthen planning and administration, must be
 responsible for the plan provided by the state and must run well the busi-
 ness of the enterprises in accordance with the requirements of the state's
 plan,  Therefore, leading cadres of the enterprises have to acquire economic
 knowledge, know how to plan and to run the business, first be responsible
 for running the enterprises well and strive to achieve the best economic
 returns.  Our national economy puts planned economy in the.leading role.
 Enterprises, as grassroots units of economic activity, must completely ful-
 fill the state's plan.  Therefore, enterprises must convert the state's plan
 into their own plan, putting it in the light of their own practical condi-
 tions.  Only by planning production will we be able to run our businesses
 well.. At the same time, we must also implement the complete plan down to
 every post at all levels and to every person.  That is to say, we must
 strictly carry out the economic responsibility system.  How can we run an
 enterprise if we entirely depend on the state, do not assume responsibility
 for the profit acid loss or do not stress economic returns?  We should employ
 those who know how to plan and run the enterprises or are specialized in
 taking "strategic problems" into account.  Raw material and fuel sources
 and product sales volume must also be taken into full account.  Naturally,
 it is impossible to make all decisions by the enterprise in planned economy;
 it is important that the leading cadres of the enterprise understand the
 state's economic situation and gain a clear idea of the state's plan and
 market development and hold themselves responsible to the state.  In the
 fall of last year, Comrade Zhao Ziyang pointed out that in order to imple-
 ment well the economic responsibility system, it is important to combine
 the implementation of the economic responsibility system with the strengthen-
 ing of planning and administration so that the enterprises will be able to
 operate in the light of the state's plan and the demands of society.  The
 most important experience acquired by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Company in
 implementing the economic responsibility system is that it arranges produc-
 tion in accordance with the state's plan and requirement, every level

 assumes responsibility, and each of them is responsible for the task until
 it is completed and pledges to fulfill the state plan in an all-round way.
 The economic administration departments must also be economically responsi-
 ble to the state and must assume responsibility for fulfilling state plans.
 2. Enterprises should have a certain decisionmaking power.  Such power
 must be given to the enterprise so that it may have initiative in running
 its administration well and may fully bring this initiative into play.
 Since 1979, we have expanded decisionmaking power in some pilot project
 enterprises, enabling them to have power in marketing some products, in
 utilizing retained profits, in issuing bonuses, in appointing and removing
 cadres at middle level and so on.  This has increased vigor in the enter-
 prises and revived them.  In 1981, we implemented the economic responsibil-
 ity system by setting profit quotas for enterprises and adopting measures
 of reward linked to profits to the staff members and workers.  All locali-
 ties have adopted various forms of retention of profits and reward in the
 light of their own conditions.  This has further aroused the initiative of
 the enterprises and workers and improved the administration and management
 of the enterprises.  In the future, following the process of administration
 system reform, the decisionmaking power of enterprises will be continually
 practiced and developed.  For instance, marketing power to some extent is'
 to be given to the enterprise and a system of good price for good quality'
 will be imposed.  This will serve to closely link production and marketing,
 to improve quality, to expand the market and to raise the social economic
 returns.
 3.   Implement the principle of distribution according to work.  The
 egalitarianism existing in distribution has for years seriously affected
 the initiative of staff members and workers.  The implementation of the
 economic responsibility system and the principle of material interest has
 partially eliminated the evils of egalitarianism inherent in wages over a
 long period of time.  A bonus principally comprises reward in excess of
 labor'quota.   Before the reform of wages is completed in an all-round way,
 the division of bonuses into categories serves to adhere to the principle
 of distribution according to labor.  Why is the economic system of labor
 responsibility well received~by the people?  One of the most important
 factors is that people urge the implementation of the principle of distribu-
 tion according to work.  If the total amount of bonuses must be put under
 control and distribution according to labor must be handled well, what is to
 be done?  According to some units' experiences, bonuses should not be leveled
 out among units and the distribution of bonuses for individuals might have
 to be increased or decreased.
 As regards distribution of profits for enterprises, the relations between
 the state, the enterprise and the laborer should be handled correctly.  In
 order to guarantee that the state can concentrate financial resources for
 energy, communications and other construction, the principle of turning
 over a greater proportion to the state should be implemented in the distri-
 bution of profits.  In the distribution of the three retained funds in the
 enterprises, a rational proportion between production funds, welfare funds
 and staff and workers' bonuses should be stipulated in the light of the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 enterprises' specific conditions.  A considerable amount. of production
 funds should be ensured so that the enterprises can constantly improve
 their technology and tap their potentials.
 4.  Conduct enterprises' readjustment in an all-round way and simultane-
 ously carry out necessary reform.                     The economic responsibility system
 should be stressed at all levels, from the leading organs to the enter-
 prises.  Only by completing enterprise readjustment and all basic tasks
 will the economic responsibility system be stabilized and gradually per-
 fected.                       At the same time, the necessary reforms indispensable to com-
 pleting the economic responsibility system should be vigorously experimented
 with at selected points or optionally arranged.  Reform within an enterprise
 should be linked with the reform of the entire industrial administration
 system, and the relations between the part and the whole should be improved.
 With the constant progress of production technology, they should be con-
 stantly improved.  A complete and specific system and measures must be
 found and adopted to suit industrial characteristics, to further arouse
 the initiative of the enterprises and staff members and workers and to
 bring.about an overall upsurge in the socialist economy.
 You Lin [2589 2651]:  "Planned Economy Is a Basic Feature of Socialist
 Economy"
 The general program of the party constitution and Comrade Hu Yaobang's
 report have reaffirmed that the socialist economy can and must develop in
 a planned and proportionate way.  They pointed out that it is absolutely
 necessary for us to have a planned economy based on public ownership.
 What is referred to as the planned economy is coordinated development of
 social economy based on unified planning.  Production is socialized under
 the capitalist system.  However, the means of production are still owned
 by the capitalists individually.  Therefore, an extremely acute contradic-
 tion has occurred.  Planned division of labor is practiced in the capitalist
 enterprises, which is characterized by being well organized.  However, the
 production of the whole society, being dominated by the spontaneous divi-
 sion of labor, is in a state of anarchy.  Thus, the market has become the
 only form of mutual contacts and the only regulator of production and
 circulation.  The spontaneous market regulation maintains the proportional
 relationship needed for the development of capitalist economy, but this is
 achieved through the frequent disruption of proportion and serious economic
 upheavals and crises.  The establishment of socialist public ownership has
 made planned economy an objective requirement and opened the possibility
 for its realization.  The planned development of social economy shows that
 social relations of production no longer rule people as an alien force.
 They have become jointly owned and brought under the control of the
 people working together.  People's economic activities are no longer
 prompted by an unknown force but are conducted according to schedule.  This
 constitutes a great leap in the history of mankind.  Planned economy comes
 into being on the basis of public ownership.  It also shows, from an impor-
 tant aspect, the nature of socialist production relations.  Therefore, it is
 entirely correct to regard the planned economy as a basic feature of
 socialist economy.

 Some comrades have summarized the basic feature of socialist economy as the
 commodity economy.  This is open to doubt.  Everybody knows that commodity
 production and exchange have been in existence for thousands of years.  They
 are a common phenomenon of the widely different modes of social production.
 Viewed from the general character of commodity production, they only reflect
 a mutual relationship between commodity owners.  They do not contain more
 complicated relationships.  The essence of capitalism cannot be summarized
 as a commodity relationship.  When criticizing the attempt of philistine
 bourgeois economists to sum up the relationship between the interested
 capitalist parties as a simple relationship brought about by the circula-
 tion of commodities, Marx pointed out:   "If we only know the abstract
 categories of commodity circulation shared by these modes of production, we
 are still unable to understand the different features of these modes of
 production, nor are we able to make a judgment on these modes of production."
 ("Complete Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 23, p 133)  This is because, in
 the capitalist economy, the law of commodity ownership has been transformed
 into one of capitalist ownership.  It is all the more impossible to sum-
 marize the essence of socialist economy as a commodity relationship.  In
 China, it is necessary to vigorously develop commodity production and
 exchange.  However, if we summarize our economy as a commodity economy, it
 is necessary to regard all state enterprises as independent economic
 entities possessing all the functions and competence of commodity producers
 and owners; to regard, under socialist conditions, the most fundamental
 relationship among people as one of exchange of commodity equivalents and
 not one of joint ownership and labor; and to regard the factor controlling
 our economic activities as being primarily the law of exchange at equal
 value (which, in fact, is an exchange of equal labor) and not the basic
 socialist economic law and the law; of planned development.  This will
 obscure the distinction between the socialist and capitalist economy.
 Will it hamper the development of commodity production and exchange if we
 do not summarize the socialist economy as a commodity economy?  No,  On
 the contrary, it will help commodity production develop along the socialist
 path.  In "Questions of Soviet Socialist Economy," Stalin pointed out that
 we should never regard commodity production as something which independently
 exists without relying on the surrounding economic conditions and that com-
 modity production exists in several different societies and serves differ-
 ent social systems.  In China, commodity production depends on the economy
 of socialist public ownership, which develops in a planned way and in which
 the state economy holds a dominant position.  It serves the socialist
 system.  Only by clarifying this point is it possible for the developing
 commodity production to become socialist commodity production beneficial
 to socialism.
 Sun Shangqing [1327 1424 3237]:  "Step Up the Study of Economic Structure
 for the Realization of Strategic Objectives"
 The report to the 12th party congress pointed out that, in the period of

 efforts is to continuously readjust the economic structure and, in the
 period of the Seventh Five-Year Plan, to continuously complete the

 rationalization of the economic structure in various fields.  Here, the
 gradual rationalization of the economic structure has been put forward as
 a very important task for laying a solid foundation and accumulating
 strength in the first decade and for creating the necessary conditions for
 a new period of vigorous development in the second.  A rational economic
 structure is an important condition for achieving better economic results
 and faster speed of development.  What is referred to as a rational
 economic structure should be one which not only promotes current economic
 development, but one which is also beneficial to future economic develop-
 ment.              It includes structures of both the productive forces and the pro-
 duction relations.  In order to ensure the realization of our strategic
 objective, it is necessary to study well all these structures and raise
 scientific proposals for these structures.
 Rationalization of industrial structure is a basic condition for the pro-
 portionate and coordinated development of the national economy.  The report
 to the 12th party congress has stipulated the strategic priorities of
 economic growth such as agriculture, energy and transport and education
 and science.  It has not only set definite demands on the current readjust-
 ment of economic structure, but has also shown clearly the orientation for
 the rationalization of industrial structure in the next two decades.  Our
 task is, on the basis of major achievements scored in the readjustment of
 industrial structure over. the past few years, to study the trend of future
 changes in China's industrial structure and raise proposals for the indus-
 trial structure in different stages of development so that the structures
 of various departments, such as agriculture, light industry, heavy indus-
 try, communications and transport, building industry, commerce and the
 service trades, become the best structures for the realization of strategic
 objectives.  It is also necessary to penetratingly study product structure.
 Quadrupling the gross annual value of industrial and agricultural produc-
 tion is not tantamount to quadrupling the output of all products.  It is
 impossible to quadruple some products, such as energy and certain raw
 materials.  However, it is possible to increase the output of some other
 products, such as machinery and electronics and petrochemical products, by
 several, a dozen or even several dozen fold.  Within a trade or profession,
 the growth of various products will also differ in thousands of ways.  This
 makes it necessary to study proposals concerning product structure in order
 to make sure that the development between the various departments or within
 the department itself helps to improve the economic results of society.
 The realization of strategic objectives should primarily depend on techno-
 logical progress.  It is necessary to study, in light of China's conditions
 characterized by a huge labor force and a relatively low technological
 level in production, proposals for China's technological structure so that
 there is a rational ratio between automatic, semiautomatic, mechanized,
 semimechanized and manual operations.  It is also necessary to study changes
 in the respective stages of development and to formulate scientific proposals
 in coping with the situation in order to continuously raise, while expanding
 employment, labor productivity and the technological level.

 When expounding the necessity of upholding the leading position of the
 state economy and developing different economic forms, the report to the
 12th party congress has also scientifically defined the various basic
 principles for China's ownership structure.  It has also called for the
 rational distribution and development of different economic forms in order
 to invigorate the urban and rural economy and to make life more convenient
 for the people.  This makes it necessary to set up a rational ownership
 structure.  Therefore, it is necessary to study proposals for the ownership
 structure which conforms to the productive forces in different stages of
 development in order to correctly bring into play its positive role in
 promoting the development of production forces.  Undoubtedly, this is also
 an important subject facing economics.
 The research task of economics is diversified.  It is also extremely
 strenuous.  So long as we penetratingly study and correctly understand the
 guidelines of the documents of the 12th party congress and implement them
 in various research tasks, we will certainly be able to create a new situa-
 tion in all fields of socialist modernization and make our contributions.
 Liu Guoguang [0491 0948 0342]:  "The Economic Program of the 12th Party
 Congress Reflects the Requirement of the Objective Economic Law"
 Now I would like to discuss with you, from the requirement of economic law,
 my initial understanding of the guidelines of the economic program expounded
 in the 12th party congress.
 1.  Let us look at this problem from the requirement of basic socialist
 economic law.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Com-
 mittee, our party, when formulating new economic principles and policies,
 has placed the aim of socialist production in a very important position.
 It was pointed out in the report to the 12th party congress that, on the
 basis of quadrupling the gross annual output of industrial and agricultural
 production, efforts should be made to increase the income of the urban and
 rural population several times over so that the Chinese people will be
 comparatively well-off both materially and culturally.  The report
 explicitly pointed out that the means to this end can only be the vigorous
 development of production.  The report also made important stipulations in
 various fields, such as increasing production and practicing economy, the
 accumulation and distribution of funds, key construction projects and
 technological transformation.  All these will help to meet the requirement
 of basic socialist economic law in a relatively satisfactory manner.
 2.  Let us look at this problem from the requirement of the law of develop-
 ing the economy in a planned and proportionate way.  Lenin pointed out:
 What is referred to as planning is a balance constantly and conscientiously
 maintained.  The report to the 12th party congress pointed out:  "China has
 a planned economy based on public ownership."  That is to say, it is neces-
 sary for China's economy to constantly and conscientiously maintain its
 proportionate development.  The economic program of the 12th party congress
 has made important stipulations in two areas--the readjustment of ratio and
 structure and the reform of planning.  With respect to the readjustment of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 ratio and structure, the report pointed out that it is necessary to regard
 agriculture, energy and transport and education and science as the strate-
 gic priorities in China's economic growth in the next two decades and,
 centering around the national economy, carry out readjustment and
 rationalization of the various economic structures.  With respect to plan-
 ning reforms, the report pointed out that it is necessary to determine,
 according to different circumstances, the limits and scope of the three
 different forms of planning,'namely, mandatory planning, guidance planning
 and regulation by market mechanism, and,. on the basis of strengthening
 state unified planning and overall balance, continuously bring into play
 the supplementary role of regulation by market mechanism.  So long as we
 succeed in establishing a scientific planning system which conforms to
 China's conditions, we will be able to realize in a better way the require-
 ment of the law of developing the economy in a planned and proportionate way.
 3.  Let us look at this problem from the requirement of the law that the
 relations of production must conform to the nature of productive forces.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our party
 has, on the basis of upholding the leading position of the state economy,
 encouraged and supported the urban and rural collective economy and the
 individual economy within a certain limit and has allowed the coexistence
 and development of different economic forms, thus promoting the prosperity
 of urban and rural economy.  The economic program of the 12th party congress
 has affirmed this orientation, explicitly pointing out the necessity for
 China to maintain different economic forms for a long time to come.  It has
 also more conscientiously applied the law of production relations conforming
 to the nature of productive forces to the rational distribution and develop-
 ment of different economic forms, with the state economy as the main body.
 In addition to the different economic forms, the report to the 12th party
 congress has also dealt with different forms of management and has set forth
 the task of continuously achieving rationalization of organizational struc-
 ture of enterprises.  These policies and measures will certainly further
 improve China's socialist relations of production and thus promote further
 development of the productive forces.
 4.' Let us look at this problem from the requirement of the law of value.
 The report to the 12th party congress has further expounded the scope and
 ways of functioning of the law of value.  1) The scope of the spontaneous
 regulatory role of the law of value is limited to the production and
 circulation of some products not listed in the plan.  A complement to
 planned production and circulation, it plays a subordinate and secondary
 role but. is also essential and beneficial.  2) State planning consciously
 utilizes the scope of functioning of the law of value, including the pro-
 duction and circulation of products listed in the plan.  But whether in
 mandatory planning or in guidance planning, we should constantly study
 changes in market supply and demand, and constantly make use of such
 economic levels as pricing, taxation and credits to guide the enterprises
 in fulfilling state plans.  This part of the planned production and circu-
 lation is the main body of China's national economy.  All these are of
 great importance to the implementation of the principle of ensuring the
 leading role of planned economy, which is supplemented by regulation by

 market mechanism, and to the vigorous development of socialist commodity
 production and exchange, thus bringing about an all-round upsurge of the
 socialist economy.
 Li Lhengzhong [2621 7201 0022]:  "Uphold the Principle of Relying Mainly dtt
 the Planned Economy and Supplementing It With Regulation by Market
 Mechanism"
 The principle of "relying mainly on the planned economy and supplementing
 it with regulation by market mechanism" expounded in the report to the 12th
 party congress is a scientific summing-up of the experience gained in
 China's socialist construction in the past three decades and more.  This
 principle, which has satisfactorily integrated a strong sense of principle
 with a high degree of flexibility in socialist economic management, should
 be made an orientation for reforming China's economic management system.
 A socialist society should practice the planned economy; it cannot do other-
 wise.  This is because the planned economy is the objective requirement of
 mass production and the inevitable consequence of the supersession of
 capitalist private ownership by socialist public ownership.  Just as Lenin
 said: "Socialism is inconceivable without planned state organization,
 which keeps tens of millions of people to the strictest observance of a
 unified standard in production and distribution."  ("Selected Works of
 Lenin," Vol 3, p 545)  It was explicitly pointed out in the report to the
 12th party congress that the planned and proportionate development of the
 national economy is an important feature of socialism.  This shows that in
 upholding socialism, it is necessary to uphold the planned economy.  We
 should not confuse with the planned economy some imperfections or even some
 shortcomings and mistakes in planning, still less should we negate the
 planned economy because of this.  Naturally, in order to uphold the planned
 economy in a more satisfactory manner, it is necessary to strengthen and
 improve management, raise the standard of planning and improve the system
 and methods of management.  Only in this way is it possible to bring into
 full play the superiority of the planned economy.
 The report to the 12th party congress listed three forms of planning:
 mandatory planning, guidance planning and regulation by market mechanism
 (that is, the enterprises flexibly arrange their production according to
 changes in market supply and demand).  These three forms are in fact the
 crystallization of the principle of relying mainly on the planned economy
 and supplementing it with regulation by market mechanism.  The adoption of
 the three planning forms conforms to China's reality and the distinguishing
 features of socialist planned economy.  In the present state of our country,
 there are still two forms of public ownership, the state economy, which
 occupies the leading position in the entire national economy, and the
 collective economy of the working people.  At the same time, there is also
 the individual economy of urban and rural working people.  Socialist com-
 modity production and exchange still extensively exist.  Mass production is
 still uneven in different departments and localities.  Under these circum-
 stances, we cannot adopt a dingle planning form but should adopt the forms
 of mandatory planning, guidance planning and regulation by market mechanism
 according to different circumstances.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 The three forms are integrally related with one another and none of them
 can be dispensed with.  They have different status in the planning system.
 Mandatory planning occupies a leading position.  Only with the coordination
 of mandatory planning can guidance planning and regulation by market
 mechanism play their proper roles.  However, the realization of mandatory
 planning is inseparable from the coordination and supplementation of
 guidance planning and regulation by market mechanism, particularly guidance
 planning.  This is because guidance planning has a fairly extensive scope
 and also plays an important role in promoting the proportionate development
 of the national economy.
 The CPC Central Committee has stressed the implementation of mandatory
 planning in a certain scope.  This is not an expedient measure.  I agree
 with the view that mandatory planning is an important feature of the
 planned economy.  This view conforms with the Marxist principle of planned
 economy.  The planned economy calls for readjustment in the proportion of
 social reproduction through the economic plans.  It goes without saying that
 these plans should be implemented by the leading economic bodies at various
 levels and all the economic organizations.  The national economic plan is
 not a general appeal but a program of action for mobilizing a mighty force,
 to realize the strategic tasks of the party and state for economic develop-
 ment.             If we do not have mandatory planning as well as its binding force,
 we do not have a planned economy.  Naturally, we do not mean that the
 greater the scope of mandatory planning the better.  The scope of mandatory
 planning should be determined according to actual circumstances.  At the
 same time, in mandatory planning, we must also "strive to make it conform
 to the objective reality, constantly study changes in market supply and
 'demand, consciously make use of the law of value and such economic levers
 as pricing, taxation and'credits to guide the enterprises in fulfilling
 state plans, and give them varying degrees of powers to make decisions as
 they see fit."
 He Jianzhang [0149 1696 4545]:  "Build a Socialist Economic System With
 Chinese Characteristics"
 In his opening speech to the 12th party congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:
 "To integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of
 China, blaze a path of our own and build socialism with Chinese characteris-
 tics--this is the basic conclusion we have reached in summing up long,
 historical experience."  What characteristics does socialism with a Chinese
 style have?  In his report to the 12th party congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang
 gave a general description of these characteristics.  My impression is that,
 viewed from the economic system, socialism with a Chinese style should com-
 prise the following two aspects:
 1.  With respect to the structure of ownership, we should implement the
 principle of maintaining, on the basis of the absolute predominance of
 socialist public ownership, different economic forms for a long time to
 come.  Comrade Hu Yaobang said: "As the level of development of the produc-
 tive forces in our country is on the whole still fairly low and uneven, it
 is necessary to maintain different economic forms for a long time to come."

 Our lesson in the past was that we blindly sought "continued revolution"
 in the relations of production, departing from the specific conditions in
 the development of China's productive forces.  After the socialist trans-
 formation of the private ownership of the means of production was basically
 completed, we were again busy undertaking a "poor transition" without so
 much as summing up the experience, consolidating the gains in victory and
 correcting the shortcomings in our work.  By the time the "gang of four" was
 smashed, in both cities and towns there was almost exclusive economy under
 ownership by all the people; in the rural areas, there was nothing left
 except the collective economy of the people's commune, which integrated
 government administration with economic management.  This practice was
 divorced from China's national conditions and brought about serious conse-
 quences.  Since its third plenary session, the CPC Central Committee has
 rectified this "leftist" guiding ideology, reaffirming that ownership by
 the whole people and by the collective are two basic forms of socialist
 public ownership.  The socialist state sector occupies the leading position
 in the entire national economy.  It is necessary to vigorously develop the
 collective economy, including the cooperatives financed and run by young
 people and other residents.  We must encourage the appropriate development
 of the individual economy of urban and rural working people within limits
 prescribed by the state and under supervision by industrial and commercial
 administration.  In agriculture and industrial and commercial enterprises,
 it is necessary to set up and popularize various forms of the responsibility
 system, including the system of responsibility for profit and/or loss in some
 of the state enterprises.   It is precisely due to the implementation of a
 series of correct policies which conform to the development of China's
 productive forces that the economy has been initially invigorated.  This
 has played a useful role in promoting urban and rural economy and in making
 life more convenient for the people.  At present, it is necessary to consoli-
 date and improve the agricultural production responsibility system and
 explore diverse and better forms of cooperative economy.  It is necessary
 to explore and formulate a set of specific systems and methods which con-
 form to the characteristics of industry and commerce and which not only
 ensure the unified leadership by the state but also bring into play the
 initiative of enterprises and their staff and workers.  With respect to
 some problems that crop up in the course of developing the cooperative
 economy financed and run collectively and the individual economy, we should
 also make efforts to solve them and strengthen management over them.
 2.  With respect to the planning system, it is necessary to implement the
 principle of "relying mainly on the planned economy and supplementing it
 with regulation by market mechanism" and practice the method of integrating
 mandatory planning with guidance planning and flexible arrangement of pro-
 duction.  Mandatory planning is aimed at enabling the state to directly
 control and allocate the necessary material and financial resources for the
 .planned and proportionate development of the national economy and the
 stability of the people's livelihood.  However, it is neither possible nor
 necessary for the state (including the various departments and localities)
 to assign mandatory targets'to various economic forms and several hundred
 thousand enterprises for a great variety of products.  At present, there
 are only 140-odd kinds of industrial products administered by the State

 Planning Commission which, if we add the industrial products administered
 by the various departments, come to about 500.  There are more than 250
 kinds of goods and materials for unified distribution by the State Planning
 Commission and State Administration of Supplies and there are only about
 580 kinds'of goods and materials administered by the various departments.
 Therefore, in addition to mandatory targets, it is entirely. necessary to
 have guidance targets and to allow enterprises to arrange their production
 flexibly in accordance with market conditions.  What merits further study
 at present is the respective scope and limits of mandatory plans, guidance
 plans and regulation by market mechanism.  It is particularly necessary to
 explore ways to implement them for various products and enterprises in vari-
 ous departments and localities.  It is necessary to draw up a system of
 targets which is provided with a scientific basis and a list of products
 for management at different levels.  This is a very complicated and meticu-
 lous job.  Furthermore, the questions of how to effectively apply the
 economic levers to realize the guidance plans and how to correctly effect
 regulation by market mechanism are important subjects facing us.

 APPROPRIATELY POOL FUNDS TO STRENGTHEN CONSTRUCTION OF MAJOR PROJECTS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 pp 29-33
 [Article,by Gui Shiyong [2710 0013 6978]]
 [Text] In his report to the 12th party congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang put
 forward the magnificent goal of quadrupling the gross annual output value
 in industry and agriculture by the end of this century.  For the sake of
 gradually realizing this goal, an important problem we must solve at
 present is to concentrate the necessary funds on the construction of major
 projects. This is an important measure for getting rid of the weak links
 in the national economy and for ensuring the continued growth of socialist
 production at the rate we have anticipated.
 Appropriately concentrate funds to strengthen the construction of major
 projects is the urgent demand of further strengthening economic readjust-
 ment as well as the objective need of long-term economic development.
 In recent years, we have carried out a series of major readjustments to the
 national economy and the serious imbalance in the past in the proportion
 between consumption and accumulation as well as between agriculture, light
 industry and heavy industry'have become more or less basically coordinated.
 However, the task of economic readjustment is by no means over, and there
 are still many problems in the national economy which require solutions.
 One'outstanding problem is that such basic facilities as energy and com-
 munications are not in keeping with economic development.  In recent years,
 because of the restriction of all sorts of conditions, the development of
 energy production has slowed down.  However, the phenomenon of serious
 ,energy waste has not changed much.  In the preceding 2 years, because some
 heavy industrial enterprises did not have enough production tasks, a portion
 of their energy was transferred to support the development of light industry.
 Thus under the condition of no increase or even a slight decrease in the
 total amount of energy supply, the whole economy still achieved a certain
 rate of growth.  This year, along with the quicker pick-up of heavy indus-
 try, the energy shortage has worsened.  At the same time, communications and
 transportation capacities are very much out of line with the increase in
 freight volume, a great deal of coal has piled up in the mining areas and

 cannot be shipped out, and the phenomenon of ships and cargoes laid up in
 ports is rather serious.  These conditions show that when there has been a
 greater improvement in the proportion between consumption and accumulation
 and between agriculture, light industry and heavy industry, the focus of
 economic readjustment work should be shifted toward further solving the
 problem of the internal structure of agriculture and industry and toward
 coordinating the relations between energy and communications as well as
 other departments and progressively alleviating the tense situation in
 energy as well as communications and transportation.  This requires us,
 while at the same time progressively strengthening energy and communica-
 tions. construction:and actively increasing the production and supply of
 energy, to realistically and effectively develop and save energy.
 Concentrating the necessary funds to carry forward the construction of
 major projects is not only the demand of further carrying out economic
 readjustment, but more importantly, it is the need of ensuring long-term
 economic development.  Proceeding from the historical experience of our
 economic construction as well as actual social economic conditions, our
 economic development henceforth should mainly rely on carrying forward
 technical transformation, improving management and administration and
 giving full play to the role of existing enterprises.  We definitely.cannot,
 as in the past, rely mainly on putting in huge investments to build large
 numbers of new enterprises.  We must not have the slightest doubt or vacil-
 lation on this point.                      However, this definitely does not mean that we can
 neglect the building of new enterprises or that we can underestimate the
 important significance of the construction of new projects which are carry-
 ing forward socialist modernization.  Our rich natural resources are at
 present poorly utilized, and there are still many resources requiring
 exploration and development.  Our agriculture field's ability to combat
 natural calamities is still very weak, and many basic production conditions
 must be progressively improved.  Our industrial technology is still rather
 backward, and such basic facilities as energy and communications must be
 strengthened.  Many developing industrial departments also require faster
 development.  Our economic distribution is still not very rational, and we
 must continue to improve it in a planned manner.  The solution of all the
 tasks mentioned above requires us to energetically carry forward the
 technical transformation of existing enterprises.  At the same time, we must
 construct the necessary new enterprises in a planned manner and reconstruct
 and'expand many of the existing enterprises.  Otherwise the expanded repro-
 duction,of society cannot smoothly develop.
 Take the solving of the energy problem for exagaple. We must give priority
 to the saving of energy, and at the same time, tap as fully as possible the
 potentials of existing coal mines and oil fields, and strive to increase the
 production of energy.  We should see that our country's energy shortage is
 to a very large extent caused by the serious waste of energy.  Therefore,
 we must hold fast to saving energy as a long-term strategic policy.  How-
 ever, this does not mean that the additional energy required for future
 economic development can be wholly solved by practicing frugality.  This is
 not the case.  Large-scale saving of energy involves carrying out the
 reorganization as well as the technical transformation of the whole industry

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 and also requires a procedure.  In this procedure, economic growth as well
 as the increase of energy consumption by the people must certainly be
 guaranteed by a definite amount of additional energy sources.  This
 requires us, based on needs and possibility, to strengthen energy construc-
 tion as well as relevant communications construction.  In the next decade
 if we cannot prepare the necessary energy sources, communications and other
 essential material conditions for vitalizing the economy in the 1990's, then
 we will encounter great difficulty in achieving the strategic dispositions
 for the whole economic development.  The construction of energy sources and
 communications will require a great deal of money and take a long time.  We
 must make appropriate arrangements well in advance.  On this question we
 would rather make the estimates more difficult and the preparations more
 adequate than are actually required, for this will be more to our advantage.
 Strengthening the construction of major projects requires a considerable
 amount of money.  Where does this money come from?  As China is a socialist
 country, construction funds must rely mainly on internal accumulation.  The
 basic path of accumulating funds is by developing production, raising
 economic benefit and opening up sources of revenue.  In other words, we
 must first have ways of making money.  Only with the development of produc-
 tion, the raising of economic benefit and the increase of public wealth can
 we keep on improving the livelihood of the people, and at the same time,
 accumulate more and more construction funds.   If we deviate from developing
 the economy to raise funds, we will be attending to trifles to the neglect
 of essentials and will be unable to properly solve the question of funds.
 At present, regardless of whether in the field of production, communica-
 tions or circulation, the waste of manpower, material resources and finan-
 cial resources is very serious.  Many technical and economic indices are
 very much lower than those of the economically developed countries, and
 even not as high as the better level . we':.have reached in the past.  There
 is extremely great potential for increasing production and practicing
 economy in various fields.  If policies are on the right track and work is
 effectively carried out, it is entirely possible to create more material
 wealth by making use of the existing financial and material resources and
 thereby provide an enormous source for the accumulation of funds.      The
 emphasis on ways to make money definitely does not mean we must not pay
 attention to ways of accumulating funds.  It is just the opposite.  After
 wealth has been created, the rational distribution carried out regarding
 its various uses is of great important significance to whether or not the
 necessary funds can be accumulated and whether or not the coordinated and
 sustained development of the national economy can be promoted.  In particu-
 lar, in such a populous and backward country as ours where the average per
 capita national income is still very low, China is still faced with the
 strenuous task of improving the livelihood of the people and pushing for-
 ward the modernization.  Under these conditions, the making of overall
 planning and arrangement and the correct handling of various proportions
 in the distribution of national income are of prime importance.  An impor-
 tant manifestation of the superiority of the socialist economy over the
 capitalist economy is that it can concentrate necessary financial and
 material resources for solving those urgent and immediate problems and
 thereby promote faster development of the economy.  Based on the per-capita

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 economic index, China is still a poor country and not very well-off in many
 respects.  However, if the funds scattered throughout the country can be
 rationally centralized, it will become a very impressive force and many
 important things can be done.  This is precisely the strong point of a
 large country such as ours.  If we take advantage of and give play to this
 strong point, it will play a very important role in pushing forward our
 socialist modernization.  The task we are faced with at present is to
 appropriately readjust the relations of distribution so as to concentrate
 necessary funds to strengthen the construction of major projects on the
 basis of energetically developing the economy and striving by every means
 to increase national income.
 For the sake of accumulating necessary funds to guarantee the construction
 of major projects, we must first continue to handle properly the relations
 between consumption and accumulation and make unified arrangement for the
 livelihood of the people as well as production and construction in
 accordance with the principle "first, feed the people and second, build the
 country."
 In recent years, for the sake of correcting the previous mistake of placing
 one-sided emphasis on production and construction to the neglect of the
 people's livelihood, we have adopted a series of measures such as greatly
 raising the purchasing prices for agriculture products, expanding labor
 employment in cities and towns, readjusting the wages of workers and staff
 members and implementing the bonus system to more quickly raise the
 standard of living of urban and rural people.  According to statistics,
 compared with 1978, the 66-percent increase in the net income of individual
 peasants and the 44-percent increase in the total wages of workers and
 staff members in 1981 have both greatly surpassed the 22-percent increase
 in the gross output value of agriculture and industry and also the 35-
 percent increase in the total output value of agriculture and light industry
 for the same period.  In these 3 years, the 26-percent increase in the
 average wage of workers and staff members has surpassed the 7-percent
 increase in the labor productivity of all personnel of enterprises for the
 same period.  Almost all the new increases in national income during these
 3 years have been used for increasing consumption and there has been no
 increase in accumulated funds.  For the sake of evidently improving the
 longstanding rather low livelihood of the people and thereby arousing the
 enthusiasm of the masses for production, this practice has been necessary.
 However, this practice can only be carried out within a specific and
 relatively short period, and should not and cannot continue forever.  If we
 keep on improving the livelihood of the people to an extent in excess of
 that of the production growth and labor productivity and use all of the
 increase in national income on consumption, the accumulation of funds is
 bound to be affected and production and construction will be impaired.  In
 this way, production will not be able to increase more quickly and the
 livelihood of the people will not continually improve.  We should see that
 a very great change has already taken place in the condition of the
 economy as a result of the readjustment in recent years.  On the one hand,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 the income of the overwhelming majority of urban and rural people has evi-
 dently increased and varying degrees of improvement have appeared in their
 material and cultural life.  On the other hand, capital construction
 investment by the state has already been cut to a minimum.  For the sake
 of ensuring the continued development of the economy, we must make appro-
 priate increases in the future.  The price subsidy shouldered by state
 finance has already taken up more than 30 percent of financial income, and
 this cannot be increased further in the future.  The increase of purchasing
 power in society for several years has surpassed the increase in commodity
 supply volume, and the daily increase in surplus purchasing power is
 affecting the stability of market prices.  These conditions explain the
 inadvisability of continuing the method of freezing accumulated funds to
 greatly increase consumption funds practiced in recent years, and the pro-
 portion between consumption and accumulation should be basically stabilized.
 Along with the development of production, the consumption level of the
 people will continue to increase in the future.  However, the margin of
 increase should no longer surpass but should be lower than the margin of
 production increase.  It should be suited to the increase in the production
 and supply of consumer goods.  The accumulation rate may also be appro-
 priately lowered a bit further, but this must be on the premise of increas-
 ing the indispensable absolute amount of accumulation.  Only in this way
 can we continue to improve the livelihood of the people, and at the same
 time guarantee the essential expansion of production and construction and
 thus enable the livelihood of the people as well as production and con-
 struction to be closely linked together, promote each other and push for-
 ward the coordinated development of the national economy.
 Proceeding from this kind of new condition and demand, for a number of
 years to come, the increase in the income of the peasants should rely
 mainly on developing agricultural production and lowering production costs,
 and should no longer rely mainly on raising the purchasing prices for agri-
 cultural products, lowering the base figure of requisition by purchase of
 assignment and expanding the range of negotiated prices.  At present, the
 productivity and economic benefit of our industry are still rather low, our
 ability to accumulate funds is not very high, and a process is needed to
 change this condition.  Therefore, the accumulation-of a considerable part
 of the funds needed for giving impetus to modernization must still rely on
 agriculture.  This is not only the bounden responsibility of the broad
 masses of peasants but also tallies with their fundamental interests.  If
 we do not take into consideration the capacity of the national economy but
 continue to raise the purchasing prices of agricultural products, this will
 certainly raise the costs of industrial production, increase the subsidy of
 prices and reduce the accumulation of funds.  This is detrimental to over-
 all economic development.  Moreover, by constantly raising the purchasing
 prices for agricultural products under the condition that industrial effi-
 ciency cannot be correspondingly increased, it will also be difficult to
 have enough industrial goods to exchange with the peasants.  In this way,
 either the peasants with money will not be able to buy the industrial goods
 they need for the prices of industrial goods will also be readjusted upward.
 Such conditions are detrimental to economic stability and development, and
 in the final analysis, also?detrimental to .the development of agriculture

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 and the continued improvement of the peasants' livelihood.  For the sake of
 enabling the increase in production to be suited to the development of
 production, the extent of increase in the wages and bonuses of the workers
 and staff members should be lower than that of the production increase and
 labor productivity.  If we want to increase income, we should concentrate
 efforts on raising labor productivity and lowering costs.  We definitely
 cannot indiscriminately issue bonuses and subsidies without taking into
 consideration the actual increase in production and profit.  Only in this
 way can we improve the livelihood of the workers and staff members and at
 the same time accumulate necessary funds, and can we balance market supply
 and demand, stabilize prices, guarantee the continued development of the
 national economy and create a more solid material basis for unremittingly
 improving the people's welfare.
 When we say that we must appropriately control the increase in consumption
 based on the new situation, this definitely does not mean that we need not
 pay attention to the necessity and possibility of improving the people's
 livelihood.  Ours is a socialist country, and our basic goal in carrying
 out production and construction is, in the final analysis, to satisfy the
 daily increasing material and cultural needs of the people.  This is a
 basic principle we must always uphold.  In recent years, although there has
 been a great improvement in the people's livelihood, many problems still
 exist.  In the countryside, there has been not much of an increase in the
 income of the commune members of some poor and low-yield production teams,
 and the livelihood of the peasants in some areas affected by serious natu-
 ral calamities is still very difficult.                  In cities and towns, the burden of
 some workers and staff members with low wages, less bonuses and many mouths
 to feed is still very heavy.  For many families, housing is still in very
 short supply.  Especially, the material treatment and working conditions
 for middle-aged intellectuals and workers playing a key role on various
 fronts are rather poor..  We must attach great importance to these problems
 and adopt measures to solve them step by step.  The standard of living of
 people throughout the country is also still rather low at present, and it
 must be progressively improved along with the development of production.
 The reason we emphasize accumulating necessary funds for carrying out
 construction is precisely for the sake of guaranteeing the continued
 improvement of the people's livelihood.  We must appropriately link
 together the immediate and long-term interests of the people. In our coun-
 try, we not only must not force down the normal consumption of the people to
 expand production and construction, but we also must not squeeze out or take
 over essential construction funds to improve the people's livelihood.  We not
 only must not wait until we have made a success of construction before turn-
 ing back to improve the people's livelihood, but we also must not wait until
 we have become better off before carrying out construction.  The only cor-
 rect policy is to take into consideration both construction and the people's
 livelihood so that they will develop in harmony.
 III
 For the sake of concentrating necessary funds to carry out the construction
 of major projects, we must also correctly handle the relations of funds

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 allocation between the central departments, localities and enterprises.  We
 not only must guarantee essential extra financial resources, but we must
 also enable the state to be in control of comparatively more funds.
 For a long time, our defect in this respect was that because of overconcen-
 tration at the central departments, localities and enterprises lacked the
 necessary extra financial resources.  This has on the one hand ffettered the
 initiative of the localities and enterprises, and on the other hand,
 encouraged blind command in economic management and resulted in many nega-
 tive consequences in economic development.  In the past, the proportion
 occupied by local income in state financial income was rather low.  This has
 now been increased.  In the past, very little of the net income was retained
 by state-run industrial enterprises.  Now this has been increased to about
 12 percent.  These changes, in addition to other reform measures, have
 played a very useful role in giving play to the initiative of the localities
 and enterprises and livening up the economy.  The present problem is that
 some of the reform measures cannot be linked up.  Many units do not strictly
 observe the financial discipline of the state.  They arbitrarily increase
 the proportion of the profits retained by the enterprises and even cut off
 the income which should be handed over to the state, causing the allocation
 and use of funds to be unduly scattered.  In 1981, the funds controlled by
 localities and enterprises outside the budget roughly equalled half the
 state financial income, and only about half of the total investment in capi-
 tal construction of units owned by the whole people in the country was
 directly controlled by the state.  On the one hand, state finance was in
 straitened circumstances and did not have enough funds for the construction
 of major projects.  On the other hand, many units did not utilize the funds
 in accordance with the plans and policy.demands of the state and blindly
 went in for projects aimed at purely expanding processing capacity.  Such
 weak links as energy sources and communications in the national economy
 could not be properly strengthened, technical transformation focusing on
 energy conservation could not be quickly developed, and high energy con-
 sumption trades which should have been put under control continued to
 develop.  Obviously, unless this state of affairs changed, the planned and
 proportionate development of the national economy would be adversely
 affected.
 China has a vast territory and numerous enterprises.  The conditions of
 various localities are vastly different, and moreover, changes are always
 taking place.  For the sake of guaranteeing that localities and enterprises
 will be able to organize production activities in line with local condi-
 tions, we must give them the proper power including the necessary financial
 power.  Especially as the economic development in the future will mainly be
 turned to intension, the emphasis will be placed on replacing the equipment
 of existing enterprises and technical transformation.  This means that it is
 even more necessary to give essential power to the enterprises and locali-
 ties so that they can improve their management and administration and raise
 their production technique in a manner suited to their own specific condi-
 tions.  At the same time, we must also see that the power of socialist
 enterprises and localities is under the planned guidance of the state.  The
 power for working out a nationwide comprehensive balance, its amount as well

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 as its application, must contribute to and definitely not hinder the
 coordinated development of the whole economy.  At present, such basic
 facilities as energy sources and communications are backward.  However the
 transformation and construction of most of these basic facilities cannot
 be shouldered by the localities and enterprises and they must be planned,
 prepared and conducted in a unified manner by the state.  At the same time,
 the present price system is not very rational. To a very great extent, it
 restricts our utilization of the economic lever to guide the enterprises
 and localities in making rational use of funds.  The organizational struc-
 ture of our enterprises is also not very rational, and the setup of many
 enterprises is very unrealistic.  Such enterprises should be closed, their
 operations suspended, be merged into other enterprises or shifted to other
 types of production, and we must carry out reorganization and integration
 in accordance with the principle of specialized cooperation.  All this
 explains the inadvisability of handing too much financial power to the
 enterprises and localities under the present condition.  Otherwise, it will
 be difficult to use the limited funds where they are needed most and the
 development of projects highly beneficial to the national economy will be
 affected.  Judging from the general situation at present, localities and
 enterprises already have too much financial power.  We must make appropriate
 readjustments so as to guarantee that the state will still be able to con-
 centrate necessary funds for the construction of major projects.
 We must combine economic readjustment with strict financial and economic
 discipline, and wage a struggle against such offenses against law and dis-
 cipline as random spreading of costs, cutting off income, evading taxes and
 wantonly increasing profits retained by enterprises.  All practices running
 counter to the existing policies, systems and regulations of the state
 should be conscientiously corrected., all forms of tax evasion must be
 plugged up and all income which should be handed over to the state must be
 collected.  At the same time, while continuing to implement the existing
 financial system and guarantee the proper decisionmaking power of the enter-
 prises, we must also appropriately readjust the proportion of the alloca-
 tion of central and local financial income as well as the proportion of
 profits retained by the enterprises in accordance with the actual condi-
 tions of different areas and trades.  In the use of funds controlled by the
 state, we must also make appropriate concentration.  We must emphasize using
 funds for the construction of such basic facilities as energy sources and
 communications and appropriately increase investment in the field of intel-
 lectual development.  Construction in other fields should mainly be arranged
 by the localities, departments and enterprises based on their own funds and
 possible bank credit.  In doing so, we are definitely not trying to slip
 back to the old rut of over-rigid control.  In the process of concentrating
 funds, we should take into account the rational needs of enterprises and
 localities so that they will have the extra financial resources to do some
 of the things, which are not advisable to be carried out by the central
 departments, in a manner suited to local conditions, and thereby bring their
 initiative into full play.  Moreover, we also cannot merely rely on this
 method of financial concentration of funds to guarantee the construction of
 major projects.  We must also properly give play to the role of banks in
 raising and utilizing funds; and through bank credits, centralize idle funds

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 in society and use them in a planned manner for production and construction.
 At the same time, the state must also implement administrative and economic
 methods to guide the orientation of the localities and enterprises in the
 use of their own funds and encourage them, by means of various forms of
 economic alliance, to use the funds where they are needed most by the state.
 In particular, we must use the funds for replacing the existing enterprises,
 carrying out technical transformation, conserving energy, cutting down the
 consumption of raw materials, improving product quality, strengthening the
 comprehensive utilization of resources and controlling pollution, and not
 simply trying to expand production capacity.   In this way, under the con-
 dition of strictly controlling the scale of fixed capital investment of
 the whole society, we will be able to free funds for strengthening the
 construction of major projects, push forward the technical transformation
 of key enterprises and properly integrate and combine these two aspects.
 In the allocation of financial resources, we should take into consideration
 the needs of these two aspects as much as possible and guard against paying
 attention to one aspect and losing sight of the other.
 On the question of rational allocation and correct use of funds, we must
 firmly establish the thought of "coordinating all the activities of the
 nation like pieces in a chess game."  At present, many of the localities,
 departments and enterprises want to keep some funds to do more of the
 things they would like to do.  This demand is understandable.  However, if
 we do not take resolute as well as realistic and practical measures to
 guarantee the construction of essential major, projects, such basic facili-
 ties as energy sources and communications will not go forward, excessive
 energy consumption will not go down and it will be difficult to enliven the
 overall situation of the national economy.  Under this condition, the
 development of the various parts will certainly be greatly affected.  Con-
 versely, only with the appropriate concentration of funds to strengthen the
 construction of major projects can the proportion between supply and demand
 in such fields as energy sources and communications be coordinated with each
 passing day, and can there be favorable external conditions for the develop-
 ment of various localities and enterprises.

 THE TWO CIVILIZATIONS MUST BE GRASPED SIMULTANEOUSLY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 pp 34-37
 [Article by Sanming Municipal CPC Committee Secretary Yuan Qitong [5913
 0796 1749]]
 [Text] In his report to the 12th party congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang
 pointed out that it is a strategic principle of our socialist construction
 to build a high material civilization simultaneously with the building of
 spiritual civilization.  He stressed:  "Whether we are able to persist in
 this principle is related to whether socialism will thrive or fail."  In
 recalling practice over the past few years, we have deeply realized that
 the principle of "grasping the two civilizations simultaneously" put forth
 by the CPC Central Committee is correct and this principle has pointed out
 the orientation for realizing the socialist modernization program of"our
 country.  The following are some experiences gained in the work carried out
 by Sanming municipality in implementing the strategic principle of the CPC
 Central Committee.
 Sanming municipality is a newly arising industrial city in Fujian Province.
 It has made certain achievements since it was constructed in 1958.  How-
 ever, as a result of the influence of "leftist" guiding ideology and sabo-
 tage during the 10 years of turbulence, the construction of the city left
 much to be desired.  For example, the housing situation was tight, the
 number of commercial centers were limited, traffic was congested, public
 order was chaotic and there were limited cultural and recreational facili-
 ties.  The masses said the city was characterized by no electrical lighting,
 uneven roads, ineffective telephone facilities and an unstable social order.
 Industrial and agricultural production was seriously affected.  Following the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we eradicated "leftist"
 guiding ideology and stepped up our leadership over work in various aspects.
 Thanks to this work, the city began to take on a new look.
 Since last year, we have studied the directives of the CPC Central Committee
 on "grasping the two civilizations" and have realized that in order to build
 the city into an industrial city with "political stability, economic pros-
 perity, advanced culture, a beautiful environment and convenient life," it
 is necessary to grasp the building of material civilization simultaneously
 with the building of spiritual civilization.  Work in these two aspects must

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 be arranged in a unified manner so that they will also be able to develop
 simultaneously.  The building of the two civilizations covers many aspects
 such as politics, economy, culture and ideology.  In carrying out the build-
 ing of spiritual civilization, it is necessary to solve urgent problems and
 carry.out work more effectively so as to promote the development of material
 civilization.  We have based ourselves on the spirit of the directives of
 the CPC Central Committee and the demand of the masses and have spared no
 efforts in improving environmental hygiene, cleaning the environment, plant-
 ing trees and beautifying the city.  Efforts have also been made to improve
 social safety in a big way and traffic order, carry out municipal construc-
 tion, repair roads, construct housing, add commercial centers and build
 parks and cultural and recreation facilities.  At the same time, we have
 also launched mass campaigns of "learning from Lei Feng and fostering new
 habits" and "five stresses and four beauties."  In March this year, we also
 launched a large-scale civility and courtesy month drive across the city.
 Thanks to these efforts carried out over the past 2 years, the city has
 taken on a new look while the people's living standard has been improved
 considerably.  The newly built housing facilities cover 330,000 square
 meters, equivalent to the total space of the housing facilities built in
 the past 2 decades and more.  More than 270 new commercial service centers
 have been added; this figure is more than double the previous number.  In
 downtown areas, 16 streets and lanes have been built or repaired.  In addi-
 tion, we. have also constructed waterways totaling 6,000 meters in length and
 built 21 latrines; we also have built and expanded 8 parks and scenic spots
 and planted 500,000 trees.  Considerable achievements also have been made in
 improving hygiene and restoring social order.  The sanitation situation has
 been greatly improved.  In the first 8 months of this year, cases of epi-
 demic diseases were 40 percent less than the same period last year.  Social
 safety and public order have been greatly improved.  In the first 8 months of
 this year, the number of criminal cases dropped by 41 percent compared with
 the same period last year.  Undesirable work styles in commercial and
 service trades, characterized by "inaccessibility, reluctant attitudes,
 offensive remarks and delays in work" have begun to change.  More than-25
 percent of the total population in urban areas have taken part in the
 activities of "learning from Lei Feng and fostering new habits" and they
 have done much work in the interests of the people.  A new atmosphere has
 emerged in party work style and the people's work style throughout the city.
 Changes in the outlook of the city, improvement in the people's life, par-
 ticularly improvement in ideological consciousness, have enabled the broad
 masses of cadres and people to fully display their socialist initiative and
 promote-production in a big way.  Gross industrial output value in 1981 was
 9.3 percent higher than 1980, while agricultural output value increased by
 18.3 percent.  The average per capita collective income of commune members
 increased by 36 yuan to reach 190 yuan.  Financial revenue increased by
 7 percent.  Gross industrial output value has continued to grow this year.
 In the first 8 months of this year, it was 18 percent higher than the same
 period last year, while the figure for March, June and August was the high-
 est monthly output value in the 24 years since the city was built.

 The great changes experienced by the city over the past 2 years proves that
 the two civilizations promote each other and are indispensable.  Spiritual
 civilization must have material civilization as its foundation and the
 building of the former can in no way depart from material conditions.  At
 the same time, the building of material civilization cannot depart from the
 building of spiritual civilization; the latter not only has a tremendous
 motivating role for the former but also guarantees that the former will
 develop along a correct orientation.  With regard to the work of a city,
 there-is no doubt that, first of all, it must do a good job in production
 and economic work, as these are basic tasks.  But to grasp economic work
 does not automatically mean that a good job is being done in-socialist con-
 struction.  It is only when we are able to grasp socialist material civili-
 zation simultaneously with grasping socialist spiritual civilization that
 we are carrying out socialist construction in an overall way.  So spiritual
 civilization represents an important feature of socialist material civiliza-
 tion and is an important manifestation of the superiority of the socialist
 system.  Without the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, we
 will not be able to build material civilization well; even if we are able to
 build spiritual civilization, it will not last long and cannot be consoli-
 dated; it may even be eliminated.  This situation has been proved through
 historical experience.  Therefore, the thinking and method of putting these
 two civilizations in contradiction and neglecting the building of spiritual
 civilization are incorrect; neither is it right to consider grasping
 spiritual civilization as grasping a minor matter instead of an important
 matter.
 To grasp the building of the two civilizations well, particularly the build-
 ing of spiritual civilization is in fact a revolution of transforming tradi-
 tions and habits and transforming society.  The aim of this revolution is
 not only to change social outlook but also to change people's spiritual
 outlook.  Therefore, it involves every family and every member of society.
 Following the 10 years of turbulence, the problems of "dirt, chaos and back-
 wardness" in the city were very common and serious and social order was
 seriously damaged.  In addition, there were also the influences of various
 wrong ideologies, old habits and old traditional concepts.  Therefore,
 there were many difficulties confronting us in the building of the two
 civilizations.  We understand from our practice that we can implement the
 guiding ideology of "grasping the two civilizations simultaneously" well and
 make new achievements in the building of the two civilizations only when we
 are able to work with revolutionary zeal.
 In order to work with revolutionary zeal, it is imperative to oppose the
 thinking of attempting and accomplishing nothing and the attitude of fear-
 ing to overcome difficulties.  It is also imperative to foster the ideology
 that considers everything from the point of the interest of the people and
 to carry out work well.  Each task must be carried out faster and achieve-
 ments must be made.  We have done our work in this way and consequently
 many construction items have been speeded up.  For example, we built the
 Qiling Mountain Park on a total space of more than 600 mu at the top of the
 mountain'in only 1 year. The building of street flowerbeds of more than
 2,000 square meters on 3 major streets was completdd in only 2 weeks.

 To work with revolutionary zeal, it is also imperative to oppose irrespon-
 sible attitudes and to advocate the attitude of daring to shoulder respon-
 sibility and to solve problems.  In order to solve the problems of dis-
 marttlitig and removing houses to give way for the extension project of the
 Honggi Road North and Dongxin Road II, leading comrades from the municipal
 party committee, municipal government and municipal construction depart-
 ments visited Xubi Estate on five occasions in August last year to investi-
 gate the situation of the masses and to carry out meticulous ideological
 work.  As a result, the old problems of dismantling and removing more than
 40 houses were resolved and the projects of the two streets that had been
 delayed for 8 years were at last completed.  Dismantling work in other
 sections of the projects have also been resolved one after another follow-
 ing meticulous ideological work.
 To work with revolutionary zeal, it is also imperative to oppose the work
 style in which cadres confine themselves to their offices, from where they
 give guidance irrespective of reality, and to encourage leading cadres to
 go deep into reality, carry out work on the spot, set examples through their
 own deeds and solve difficulties wherever they crop up.  Over the past year
 and more, we have organized leading cadres to carry out work at the grass-
 roots level on more than 10 occasions.  On the eve of the last Spring Festi-
 val, leading comrades from the municipal party committee and municipal
 government, with exception of a few comrades who remained on duty, led more
 than 1,200 cadres above the level of deputy bureau director throughout the
 city. to carry out work on several fronts to grasp the situation of market
 supply at the grassroots level, grasp the work of cultural and recreational
 activities of the masses, transform the scenery of the city, improve social
 safety and public order and arrange industrial and agricultural production
 during the holidays.  As a result, we have been able to promote the work of
 various departments, improve the people's material and cultural lives and
 train cadres and promote the relationship between the party?and the people.
 Exemplary deeds of cadres have educated and encouraged the masses of people
 who have consequently been able to enlighten their spirit and increase
 their confidence in socialist construction and the party.
 Communist ideology is the core of socialist spiritual civilization.  The
 primary task of building socialist spiritual civilization is to educate
 people with communist ideology and communist morality so that more and
 more members of society will become workers with ideals, morals and culture
 and who abide by discipline.  Because of the grave consequences of the 10
 years',of turbulence, this kind of education is particularly pressing at
 present.  We have grasped this work in connection with other work and with
 emphasis on party ideological building and the ideological and political
 work of the masses.
 The building of party ideology supports the building of social spiritual
 civilization. The ideological level and work style of the broad masses of
 party members, particularly party cadres, have a direct effect on the
 ideology and morality of the whole society.  Therefore, improvement in the
 ideological level of the broad masses of party members and basic improve-
 ment in the party's work style play a decisive role in the building of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 socialist spiritual civilization.  Over the past year and more, we began
 this work among the standing committee members of the municipal party com-
 mittee while party organizations at various levels began the work of recti-
 fying the party's work style as the key subject in organizational activities.
 This-work includes the following:  1) Party members have been organized to
 study a series of directives of the CPC Central Committee and carry out
 education on persisting in the five basic principles so as to solidly
 foster communist ideals and concepts.  2) Following the principle of recti-
 fying work style and the principle of party constitution and inner-party
 political activities, education has been strengthened on party character,
 party discipline and party work style and criticism and self-criticism
 launched..  At the same time, party members have been educated on how to
 maintain the purity of their ideology; this work has been carried out in
 connection with measures to hit at criminal activities in the economic
 sector and to fight against corrosion.  3) The combat capability of party
 organizations and the ideological level of party members have been tempered
 and improved through practice in the building of the two civilizations.
 Work has also been carried out to regularly check, examine and appraise the
 ideology, work style and practice of all party organizations and members
 throughout the city.  During the launching of civility and courtesy month,
 the municipal party committee organized more than 800 cadres above the level
 of party branch members at grassroots level across the city to conscien-
 tiously?study the directives of the CPC Central Committee.  At the same time,
 all party members were organized to take part in the building of the two
 civilizations; in this work they have played the roles of both propagators
 and fighters.  Thanks to the vanguard and exemplary roles of all party
 members, the civility and courtesy month was carried out smoothly.
 People are the masters of history as well as the builders of the two
 civilizations.  It is only when people are armed with communist ideology
 and moral concepts that they can display to the utmost their initiative
 and creativity and promote the constant development of the building of the
 two civilizations.  Therefore, we have proceeded from reality and used
 various methods to carry out'education on revolutionary ideals, morality,
 discipline and law and education on social morality, professional morality
 and marriage and family morality among cadres and masses in various trades,
 particularly among youths.  The masses were organized to work out various
 rules and regulations on the civilizations as criteria for their deeds.
 This work is aimed at enabling people, in their common social life, to
 consciously follow communist spirit, correctly handle the relationships
 among the state, collective and individuals, correctly handle the relation-
 ships among people and foster collective and patriotic ideology and the
 sense of responsibility as the masters of their own country.  We have also
 taken active measures to lead the masses in launching the campaign of
 "learning from Lei Feng and fostering new habits" and creating civilized
 units so as to foster good morality.  We have also taken a clear-cut stand
 in commending and supporting new people and new things that have demon-
 strated communist spirit and have hit at bad habits and traditions and
 undesirable persons and things.  In order to carry out ideological work well
 and promote the work of various aspects, we have since May last year trans-
 ferred more than 6,600 people from government organizations and enterprises

 and formed them into 10 propaganda teams.  These teams are assigned certain
 work in certain places for maintaining social safety and environmental
 hygiene, public traffic order and to help in service trades and eliminate
 spiritual pollution.  These teams have carried out ideological and polit-
 ical work at the grassroots level to become a backbone force in the building
 of the two civilizations.  Great changes have taken place in social practice
 thanks to education.  During the civility and courtesy month over 100
 advanced. units and over 4,000 activists emerged.
 Marxism states that the basic purpose of socialist construction is to meet
 the increasing needs of the people's material and cultural life.  In the
 final analysis, the purpose of doing a good job in the building of the two
 civilizations is also to realize this goal.  Therefore, we carry out our
 work according to the specific conditions of our city, grasp the work that
 is urgently needed by the masses and solve problems so as to do more and
 better work.   The present Hongxing shopping center is built on the site of
 a former rubbish dumping ground that had seriously affected municipal
 scenery and environmental hygiene over the past many years.  Measures were
 taken to clear the rubbish and build a shopping center with 27 state-owned
 and collective shops as well as individual shops that sell food and daily
 necessity goods.  In this way, we have not only removed the heaps of
 rubbish but also improved the scenery of the city, activated the market,
 brought convenience to the masses, arranged employment and added income
 for the state.  Basing themselves on the desires of the people and their
 own specific conditions, various trades have-taken measures to solve such
 problems as housing; coal supplies; vegetable supplies; commercial centers;
 traffic; recreation activities, such as movies, operas and television pro-
 grams; latrines; and sports activities.  As all problems have been gradually
 solved, a more convenient living environment for the masses consequently
 has been formed.  Through their own experiences, the broad masses of people
 deeply understand that to "grasp the two civilizations simultaneously" is
 not only in the long-term interest of the state and the nation but is also
 in the interest of each member of society and therefore they have become
 more determined in building the two civilizations.
 However, the work we have done over the past 2 years is far from enough.
 We only have made limited and initial achievements in the building of the'
 two civilizations and these achievements are still far from what is demanded
 by the party.  But we understand that these achievements represent a good
 beginning.  Now, the broad masses of cadres and people are able to measure
 their work from the point of the two civilizations and relate their various
 concrete work with the long-term goal.  This situation has provided us with
 a better ideological foundation for building the two civilizations on a
 larger scale in the future.  At present, it is imperative for us to do a
 good job in studying and disseminating the spirit of the 12th party con-
 gress.  In particular, we must do a good job in studying and disseminating
 the importance of building a high socialist spiritual civilization, in
 carrying out the activities of the "five stresses and four beauties" and
 in further displaying the 'initiative of various departments and units so as
 to further overcome the conditions of "dirt, chaos and backwardness."  I am
 fully confident that with the encouragement of the spirit of the 12th party
 congress and under the guidance of the correct principles of the CPC Central
 Committee, we will be able to make new achievements in the building of the
 two civilizations.

 SERIOUSLY CARRY OUT THE WORKERS' CONGRESS SYSTEM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 pp 38-41
 [Article by Yu Yannan [2456 3601 0589]; passages within slantlines published
 in boldface]
 [Text] China's experiences in socialist construction illustrate that the
 workers congress system under the control of party committees has raised
 the working class' sense of mastery and responsibility, as well as acti-
 vating their enthusiasm to manage affairs and correctly set up the basic
 organizational style of socialist enterprise.  The "Provisional Regulations
 of the Workers Congress in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" drawn up by
 the CPC Central Committee and the State Council (referred to hereafter as
 "the regulations") clearly outline the powers of the workers' congress based
 on state governmental policies and laws and planning demands.  These powers
 relate to enterprise production, management and distribution as well as
 cadre surveillance, election, recall, etc.  This is the successful result
 of the party's guidance of the working class in the development of socialist
 democracy and carrying out the systematization of the democratic management
 of enterprise.  Furthermore, it is an embodiment of our party's total reli-
 ance on and trust in the working class under the historical conditions of
 modernized construction.  After the publication of the regulations, every
 region and department quickened the pace of introducing the workers' con-
 gress system.  Up until the end of last year, the number of enterprises and
 units that had introduced the workers' congress system stood at around
 101,000.  Most medium and large-scale industrial enterprises in Beijing,
 Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Chongqing had
 all basically completed the popularization of the system.
 In the last year, many enterprises have been working very seriously in
 accordance with the regulations and the workers' congress has played an
 active role in improving administration and management, correctly solving
 internal enterprise contradictions, strengthening surveillance of cadres,
 etc.  However, in national terms, the general situation concerning the
 introduction of the workers' congress system is not well balanced.  The
 proportion of well organized workers' congresses is small and a great many
 work units have set up workers' congresses which display varying degrees of
 formalism and perfunctoriness and of which, of course, most workers are
 very critical.  Thus, the pressing task which now faces today's enterprises

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 is to satisfactorily and completely put the workers' congress system into
 effect and ensure that the working masses are able to enjoy all the demo-
 cratic powers outlined in this system.
 /I.  Continue to raise the consciousness of the broad mass of cadres, in
 particular the enterprise leaders, regarding the importance of implementing
 the workers' congress./
 Some work units which have alreddy set up workers' congresses but without
 success, find that the main reasons for this lack of success lie with the
 leading cadres of the units.  Many leading cadres are not accustomed to
 putting workers' congresses into action and fear:.the power of such con-
 gresses as well as the loss of their own power.  In some enterprises, party
 organizations have taken on the work of the workers' congresses themselves
 and insist that all affairs, whatever the size, must be discussed by the
 party committee, getting the consent of the workers' congress afterward.
 Some leading administrative cadres only want to make use of the workers'
 congress when they are faced with problems that they themselves cannot
 solve, such as only partially fulfilled production quotas, and thus are not
 in the least interested in allowing the workers to enjoy their democratic
 powers, feeling that democratic management with everyone having a say will
 hinder the realization of the foreman responsibility system.  Some people
 even feel that enterprises should be in complete control of foremen and
 managers appointed by the state, with workers powerless to participate in
 management.  All this illustrates that some people have a confused under-
 standing of or misconceptions about recognizing workers' positions as
 masters of the enterprise and the reasons for carrying out democratic
 management in socialist enterprises as well as the basic relationship
 between state-employed personnel and the working masses.  Such misunder-
 standings must be quickly clarified.
 Democratic management is a necessary part of the socialist system of public
 .ownership of the means of production and is, indeed, a reality of it.  Dis-
 tribution according to work is another reality of such a system.  The
 establishment of the socialist system of public ownership of the means of
 production means the thorough eradication of the relationship of exploiters
 and exploited, laying a material foundation for the workers to become
 masters of enterprise management.  For the workers to become masters of the
 means of production is by no means an empty, abstract concept; there is a
 very full and concrete content to it.  It includes the need for workers to
 have authority and power when involved in enterprise production, adminis-
 tration and distribution activities as well as the election, surveillance
 and recalling of the enterprise leadership; in other words, anything
 related to enterprise management or the workers' personal interests.  Thus,
 the workers should use suitable channels and means to participate in actual
 and not merely nominal enterprise management.  If workers only have labor
 rights within an enterprise and are deprived of management rights, then
 their position as masters of the enterprise has not been fulfilled or, if it
 has, then in name only.  Mao Zedong pointed out that we should not come to
 understand the power of the people to mean only labor powers, education and
 social security.  The workers' power to manage the state, enterprise and
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 cultural education is the most basic of powers.  If democratic management
 is no.t carried out in our socialist enterprises, then the working masses
 are not able to involve themselves in important economic activities, are not
 able to carry out surveillance of enterprise leaders or carry out the demo-
 cratic-election or recalling of enterprise leaders within the specific
 limits laid down by the laws and regulations.  Thus, how does the fact
 illustrate itself that the workers are masters of the means of production
 and in charge of enterprise management?  Hence, in very basic terms,
 supporting democratic management means also supporting the workers as
 masters of the means of production and, also, the socialist system of pub-
 lic ownership of the means of production.
 State-run enterprises belong to the whole nation and the workers in such
 enterprises are part of the nation.  Not only do they, along with the rest
 of the population, possess the means of production of their enterprises,
 but they also make direct use of the means of production in their enter-
 prises and carry direct responsibility for organizing all affairs in the
 enterprises.  Power and responsibility cannot be separated.  Because of the
 workers' closer relations with the enterprise's means of production, the
 production process and production results, they have a more direct and
 greater right to say how these means of production should be organized and
 used, how production technology should be improved and how economic effi-
 ciency should be raised, than other workers in enterprises and than other
 workers in general.  Thus, while the management of states-run enterprises
 manifests itself through unified state plans, policies and decrees, through
 instructions from higher authorities and through the direct role played by
 the directors of the enterprise, democratic management of the enterprise by
 the workers and staff is also necessary, in accordance with the rules and
 regulations set by the state and higher authorities and through proper
 organizational forms.  These two are not contradictory but should combine
 and work together to unite the interests of the state, the collective and
 the workers, thereby ensuring the quality of state-owned enterprises and
 helping the workers become masters of their work while fuelling their
 enthusiasm and creativity. ,
 At present, the workers' congress system is a fundamental system guarantee-
 ing that the working class will act as masters of our society.  By making
 use of the workers' congress system, the workers can make use of democratic
 powers in their enterprise to become the masters of their situation and
 this is an important part of the move to strengthen socialist democratic
 construction.  But the leaders in some enterprises have forgotten that the
 party should direct and support the workers' move toward. mastery over
 their affairs and such people wrongly feel that giving power to the
 workers' congress and allowing the working masses to exercise power will
 destroy the leadership of the party committee.  This is completely wrong.
 Ignorance or deprivation of the workers' democratic rights will not be
 tolerated.  Such people are in fact not recognizing the workers' position
 as masters of their affairs and they have forgotten that they themselves
 have been appointed by the state and the people to take up their public
 office of duties and they either consciously or subconsciously place them-
 selves'in a position above the people.  They do not realize that if the

 workers in an enterprise do not become the masters of their affairs then
 their sense of responsibility and their enthusiasm toward politics and
 production will suffer greatly, indeed may be eliminated completely.  Full
 expression of the workers' production enthusiasm is one of the fundamental
 advantages of the socialist system.  We should do a lot of serious thinking
 about the extent to which the advantages of the socialist system give
 expression to such things, as well as the basic position of cadres within a
 socialist state.  Misconceptions and mishandling of such things should also
 be thoroughly corrected.
 Investigative materials illustrate that, at present, relations between
 cadres and the masses in some enterprises are very uneasy.  The workers
 lack the democratic powers that are their right and this has already influ-
 enced their political and production enthusiasm.  In China's enterprises
 the problem of cadre/masses relations is to a large extent a question of
 party/masses relations.  The main reason for bad cadre/masses and party/
 masses relations lies in the lack of basic alterations in party lines.
 Some leaders and cadres use underhand means to arrange favorable positions
 for their children.  Promotion, housing and other questions affecting the
 interests of the working masses are abused by these people for themselves
 and their relatives.  These wrongful activities directly injure and destroy
 the moral of the working masses and directly harm the image of the party in
 the eyes of the working masses.  Under such conditions, the workers desire
 with even greater fervour stricter surveillance of the cadres and leaders.
 A major reason for the insistent demands of the workers to introduce the
 workers' tribune system is that such a congress would provide them with a
 tribune to help them realize their democratic rights.  These demands made
 by the working masses are very reasonable and fully in accord with the
 party's aim of achieving a high level of socialist democracy in China.
 China's cadres, especially those involved in the running of enterprises
 should take a serious and deep look at the workers' position, their demands
 and their voice and come to grasp the essence and significance of the CPC
 Central Committee and the State Council's move to realize the workers'
 congress system and should, with a high degree of political responsibility,
 move forward with the working masses to strive to realize the workers'
 congress system.
 /II.  Lay out and improve the regulations for the workers' congress system
 and ensure that the working masses fully enjoy the democratic powers set up
 for them within such a system./
 Historical experience tells us that acquisition of correct knowledge, the
 establishment of a set of important principles and the transference of such
 knowledge and principles into the minds of the masses and getting the masses
 to accept them so that they become a part of the behavior of the masses,'is
 often a repetitive and tortuous process of development.  Democratic manage-
 ment developed as an important principle in the early 1950's in China and
 indeed the workers' congress system was put to a trial run in several
 enterprises.  As a result of a variety of reasons the system had its ups
 and downs until after the 3d Plenary of the 11th National People's Congress
 the party officially produced the "Provisional Regulations for the Workers'
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 Congress in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises"--a decisive and significant
 step in the systematization and legalization of the system of democratic
 management. But the coming into being of these regulations did not solve
 everything, for the actual implementation of these regulations still
 requires a great deal of work.  Every region, every department and every
 unit should draw up and complete feasible and detailed rules for the
 implementation of the regulations, based on the actual situation in which
 they are involved.  In addition every article and every clause of the regu-
 lations should be made concrete so that when the workers in an enterprise
 make use of their democratic powers, there exist concrete methods to be
 followed.  Without the application of detailed rules things laid out in
 the regulations cannot be implemented very easily, nor can investigations
 be conveniently carried out.  For example, the regulations state that the
 workers' congress has the power to decide workers' housing distribution;.
 In the course of implementation an enterprise can make this more concrete
 and based on the actual regulations and the realistic situation of that
 particular work unit, additional and subsidiary rules may be drawn up:
 1) the workers' congress should discuss and decide those who are to sit on
 the housing committee and ensure that duties are carried out correctly based
 on the support of the principles drawn up by those who have faith in the
 masses; 2) conditions for housing allocation should be decided by the
 workers' congress; 3) concrete plans for housing allocation must be decided
 by the workers' congress and then announced to the workers.  Such plans
 include how many houses are to be built, the conditions for housing alloca-
 tion and who gets what.  With these supplementary rules, the working masses
 are able to fully exercise their democratic powers in the allocation of
 housing.
 After the publication of these regulations, the party Central Committee
 went on to publish "Provisional Regulations for the Working of Foremen in
 State-Owned Factories" and "Provisional Regulations for the Work of Chinese
 Communist Industrial Enterprises Grassroots Organizations."  These three sets
 of regulations brought about new sets of rules for the internal leadership
 and management system in China's industrial enterprises.  Questions such as
 how these three sets of regulations should be linked, how the workers'
 congress system, under the command of the party committee can be united with
 the foreman responsibility system under the command of the party committee
 within one single enterprise and how the party committee can command but
 not completely monopolize or take over all need more detailed and concrete
 regulations and should be incorporated into the restructuring of the
 economic system to gradually try to establish a complete system of rules
 and regulations.
 Today, the workers' congress system has been spread throughout the country
 and in the process of carrying out this system the working masses must
 construct and advance.  The new and fresh experiences that they have gained
 should be timely assimilated and propagated so that the workers' congress
 system can be improved on.  In recent years some enterprises have taken the
 .assessment of cadres as an important role and function of the workers'
 congress, and this is something which we should watch very,carefully.  Under
 the leadership of the party committee one electric locomotive repairs

 factory carried out cadre evaluation and assessment activities in their
 workers' congress throughout 1980 and 1981.  The cadres of this factory
 felt there was no essential difference between cadres and workers and that
 one should not allow cadres to criticize workers without workers being
 able'to criticize cadres.  Cadres who originally had misgivings about such
 system now say that "The system whereby the workers' congress criticizes
 cadres is very good, for in this way both the cadres and workers are able
 to express what otherwise would have been suppressed inside themselves.
 They can then come to a mutual understanding and make forward progress.
 Working in this way everyone is able to carry out factory affairs much more
 successfully."  The experiences of other work units who have also put such
 assessment programs into operation also suggest that strict assessment of
 cadres over a set period of time by the workers' congress is a very viable
 and feasible method of strengthening workers' surveillance of cadres and
 should be popularized throughout the country's enterprises.  Of course,
 during the process of cadre assessment, the workers must be taught to
 correctly make use of their democratic powers and to correctly handle
 cadres' faults and mistakes.  In situations where conditions are ripe, a
 transition must be made from the masses' assessment of cadres to the demo-
 cratic election of cadres within specific limits.
 /III.  The working masses should actively participate in democratic life
 such as the workers' congress and ceaselessly strengthen their own ability
 to master their affairs./
 The direct democracy that the workers' congress represents is an important
 component part of socialist democracy.  Because socialist democracy is a
 new kind of democracy in the history of mankind and because of the lack of
 a democratic tradition in old China because of the rule of the exploitative
 classes, the ordinary masses lack training in democratic life.  In addi-
 tion to this, the 10 years of social chaos under the anarchistic rule of
 Lin Biao and the "gang of four" which tried to pass itself off as socialist
 democracy has still not been entirely cleared up.  Thus today, China's
 working masses still lack experience in how to correctly and effectively
 make use of this new style of democracy known as the workers' congress to
 strengthen the democratic management of enterprise.  The workers should
 concentrate on checking their own weaknesses in this area and actively try
 to learn and understand so that they may increase their own democratic
 accomplishments and strengthen their ability to be masters of their affairs.
 The past 30 years of cultural education has meant that the present cultural
 level of the working masses is much higher than it was during the early
 years of new China.  Indeed, a certain level of cultural knowledge is a
 vital condition for a democratic life style.  The advantage of our position
 is that our workers do not participate in management as separate individuals
 but participate in management by organizing together and collectivizing
 their knowledge and strength.  Some people feel that while division of labor
 still exists in the present stage of China's development, the restrictions
 of the division of labor prevent workers from understanding enterprise pro-
 duction, administration and distribution and other facets of the overall
 enterprise situation.  They feel that the workers do not possess the neces-
 sary skill and knowledge for such areas and for these reasons should not

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 participate in enterprise management.  Such an opinion is both incorrect and
 one-sided.   For one thing, worker representatives possess the character of
 the working masses, meaning not only individual workers involved in produc-
 tion but also engineers and technological personnel, administrators, lead-
 ing cadres and other work personnel.  Of course, production workers repre-
 sent the greater part.  By organizing these people together and pooling
 their wisdom and strength it is often very easy to solve problems that
 individual cadres found insoluable and thereby ensure that decisions to
 major enterprise problems are in the best interests of the working masses
 and reflect in a more all-round and accurate way the regularity of objec-
 tivity.  When Lenin discussed the task of developing socialist democracy
 he said: "We can complete this task, we can teach the infinite number of
 working masses to manage the state and manage industry, we can develop real
 work and we can destroy the deep-rooted prejudices that have existed for
 so long amongst the working masses, namely that administration of the state
 is a matter for the privileged few and is a refined skill."  ("Complete
 Works of Lenin," Vol 28, p 405)  Under the guidance of the party, China's
 working class is perfectly capable of coming to understand and learn the
 economy, politics, cultural and other social tasks necessary for administer-
 ing the state.
 Those workers elected as worker representatives should of course strive hard
 to learn ands understand the knowledge and ability needed to be their own
 masters.  On the one hand such representatives should make full use of
 their naturally intimate relationship with the working masses and should
 possess rich practical experience.  On the other hand, they should actively
 learn the party line and party policies and the necessary knowledge for
 the administration and management of an enterprise, as well as the basic
 facts related to socialist democracy and the legal system.  Only in this
 way can the worker representatives correctly and effectively exercise the
 democratic powers laid out in the workers' congress system and thereby live
 up to the trust and expectations placedlin them by the working masses.
 Cadres and leaders on every level of the enterprise should make conditions.
 favorable for the worker representatives to learn and establish necessary
 conditions for the fulfillment of their own duties.  Workers' representa-
 tives should of course, without doubt consciously accept the correct guid-
 ance of the party committee and make conscious efforts to preserve the
 rightful authority of the foreman and conscientiously support the struggle
 against such incorrect phenomena as anarchy, out and out egosim and selfish
 departmentalism.
 We believe that, fired by the enthusiasm of the party, the workers' con-
 gress system may be carried out and practiced more keenly and more widely
 throughout the country that the working class will play an increasingly
 important role in the establishment of a high degree of socialist democracy.

 HOW TO STUDY THE FOURTH PART OF THE REPORT TO THE 12TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 pp 42-45
 [Article by RED FLAG Editorial Office for Theoretical Education; passages
 within slantlines published in boldface]
 }
 [Text]  The subject of establishing a high level of socialist democracy
 mentioned in this section is one of the basic aims and tasks of the new
 historical era of the party.  Here we will look at the important content
 and basic principles involved in establishing this high level of socialist
 democracy.  In studying this section we must grasp three major points:
 1.  The major significance of establishing a high level of socialist
 democracy.
 2.  The main content of establishing a high level of socialist democracy.
 3.  The relation between class struggle and establishing a high level of
 socialist democracy.
 /In studying the first point, a deeper understanding may be achieved in two
 ways.  1) Why is the establishment of a high level of socialist democracy a
 fundamental aim and task; and 2) integration into reality and correct mis-
 conceptions concerning the question of democracy./
 The report says that the construction of socialist material and spiritual
 civilization depends on the continued development of socialist democracy
 for support.  One of our fundamental aims and tasks is to establish a high
 level of socialist democracy.  The fact that the party has made the estab-
 lishment of a high level of socialist democracy a fundamental aim and task
 arises from the fact that China is a nation where the people are masters of
 the state and our socialist cause is the common cause of all the people.
 Only with a high level of socialist democracy will it be possible to raise
 the masses' sense of mastery and allow them to fully exercise their powers
 in managing the state and to ensure that developments in all our undertak-
 ings conform with the interests, the will and the expectations of the
 people, and to ensure effective dictatorship over the handful of hostile
 elements who seek to destroy our socialist undertakings.   In this way we
 will promote the smooth progress of the establishment of socialist cultural

 and spiritual civilization.  Some comrades wonder why it is only a high
 level of democracy which is our fundamental aim and task and why not a
 high level of centralization as well.  The reason is because the high level
 of democracy of which we talk relates to the question of the fundamental
 system of our country or state and the question of the position of the
 masses within the state.  From a Marxist point of view, the most important
 and basic implication of socialist democracy is that the entire population
 should enjoy the highest degree of power for managing the state on the
 basis of the public ownership of the means of production.  In the."Communist
 Manifesto" Marx and Engels pointed out that "the first step in the workers'
 revolution is to elevate the proletariat classes to the position of ruling
 classes in the struggle for democracy."  ("Selected Works of Marx and
 Engels," Vol 1, p 272)  Lenin said:  "Democracy is a form or style of a
 state."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 3, p 257)  The Constitution of the
 PRC states that all the power of the PRC belongs to the people.  Taking
 democracy as the fundamental state system, it cannot be placed along with
 centralization and thus "a high level of democracy" and "a high level of
 centralization" cannot be mentioned together.  Democracy and centralization
 are questions of form of government and are thus also questions of
 organizing every level of government in accordance with the principles of
 a system of democratic centralization.  Within these limits, we should
 bring.about a link up between a high level of democracy and a high level of
 centralization and thus put into practice a high level of centralization on
 the broad base of democracy.
 Since "a high level of democracy" refers first-and foremost to a state
 system why then is the establishment of a high level of socialist democracy
 taken as only a fundamental aim and task?  Why is no mention made of dic-
 tatorship?  We should remember that China is run on a system of the people's
 democratic dictatorship.  Such a system, as the report pointed out, ensures
 that the workers, who represent the vast majority of the population are
 masters of the state and also guarantees that efficient dictatorship is
 carried out against the small proportion of enemy elements intent on
 destroying the socialist cause.  Today, class relations in China have
 already changed a great deal.  The exploitative class has already been
 eradicated.  Class struggle is no longer the major social contradiction and
 most social contradictions are now no longer of the nature of the class
 struggle.  Because of this, we can use the principles of the system of
 democratic centralization to solve contradictions.  Under such circumstances
 the establishment of a high level of socialist democracy and the development
 of democracy among the people both take on an even greater importance.  The
 most important task of China's political construction is thus to develop the
 socialist democracy already established, both gradually and sequentially.
 The greater the development of the people's democracy, the greater the
 efficient dictatorship over the small hostile element within our society.
 Thus; making the establishment of a high level of socialist democracy the
 most important of our aims and tasks does not mean that the dictatorship
 over the small hostile element will be ignored; rather it includes such
 dictatorship.

 Not everyone understands fully the importance of establishing a high level
 of socialist democracy.  If we take a look at the class nature of China's
 system of the people's democratic dictatorship we can see that in historical
 terms it is the most democratic system and is incomparably superior to
 capitalist democracy.  It is the democracy of the masses replacing the
 democracy of the small minority, it is true democracy replacing false
 democracy.  As Lenin said, this new style of socialist democracy "is a
 hundred times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy."  (Ibid., p 634)
 If one does not understand this, then one has not grasped the most funda-
 mental things of a Marxist country's doctrines.  But the system of socialist
 democracy and democratic life itself has a developing and constantly
 improving process to it.  The several thousand years of feudal society in
 China have meant that economics and culture are fairly backward and lacking
 in democratic tradition.  Despite the great work carried out by the party
 since the founding of new China in terms of establishing socialist
 democracy, the construction of a democratic system was seriously influenced
 by the later emergence of "leftist" errors.  What was particularly disas-
 trous to the socialist democracy were such counterrevolutionaries as Lin
 Biao and Jiang Qing who tried to set up a fascist so-called "total dicta-
 torship."  The result of this was that some comrades became very accustomed
 to any and all kinds of undemocratic phenomena and lacked the necessary
 faith in the development and fulfillment of socialist democracy.  Since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the party has corrected
 'these "leftist" mistakes and has continuously made the establishment of a
 high level of socialist democracy the most important aim, carrying out
 repeated mass education and making use of many large-scale measures.
 Nevertheless, we should remember that the "leftist" influence has not been
 totally eradicated in terms of the establishment of socialist democracy and
 there are still many. ideological barriers which must be overcome.  Both the
 establishment of a people's system and the development of a democratic life
 style are very far removed from the demands of establishing. a high level of
 socialist democracy and thus we still have a long period of hard work ahead
 of us.  On the other hand the democracy problem is still being disrupted
 and attacked from the right.  Some people cannot recognize the fact that
 socialist democracy is in its essential character incomparably better than
 bourgeois democracy, nor do they recognize that bourgeois democracy "is a
 heaven for the rich but a trap and a hoax for the poor and the exploited."
 Such people praise bourgeois democracy and freedom to the skies, speak'~of
 it highly without analysis and even oppose the four fundamental principles
 in order to laud the freedom of the bourgeoisie.  If we allow such mistaken
 rightist thinking to spread unchecked, we will find ourselves in a situa-
 tion of anarchy with a shattered, disunited political situation.  These two
 incorrect ways of, thinking are mutually influential.  When we study we must
 take care to bring things into line with reality and take another step
 forward in overcoming these deviations and come to fully understand the
 importance of establishing a high level of socialist democracy and supporting
 the correct development of socialist democracy.
 /In studying the second important point, we should come to a deeper under-
 standing of the following four points on the basis of bringing together

 theory and practice.  1) Restructure and improve the democracy system and
 allow democratic life to pervade every area of society according to the
 principles of the system of democratic centralization; 2) the systemization
 and legalization of socialist democracy; 3) develop peace, unity and mutual
 assistance between races, based on socialist race relations; 4) continue
 to consolidate and strengthen, patriotic unity./
 All the power in our country belongs to the people and when exercising this
 power the people must follow the principles of the system of democratic
 centralization.  The system of democratic centralization means centraliza-
 tion on the basis of democracy and the mutual bringing together and unifi-
 cation of democracy under the guidance of centralization.  This is the
 fundamental guiding principle of completing the democratic system and
 developing democratic lifestyles.  Only with centralization based on
 democracy can we correctly embody the interests and will of the people and
 only with democracy under the guidance of centralization can we ensure that
 the people will effectively exercise their democratic powers or rights.  In
 the past, some people said. that democracy and centralization were dia-
 metrically opposed to each other, saying that with democracy there was no
 need for centralization and with centralization there was no need for
 democracy, not understanding that the two are dialectially united.  These
 one-sided and mistaken views create confusion in the support for the prin-
 ciples of the system of democratic centralization and they should be cleared
 up as soon as possible.  Only if we carry out the principles of democratic
 centralization in full can we successfully restructure and improve the
 political system and the system of leadership in China and ensure that
 every level of the state organs is established on a broad democratic base
 and with a high level of centralization effective leadership and organiza-
 tion of socialist construction.   Socialist democracy still needs to expand
 into every area of the people's political, economic, cultural and social
 lives.  In order for the people to be masters of the state, not only must
 they exercise their powers in managing the state, they should directly
 enjoy differing degrees and different types of managerial powers in their
 participation in political, economic, cultural and social activities, so
 that on`a broader basis and to a greater extent they may make use of
 democracy to govern themselves, educate themselves, and on the basis of the
 principles of socialist democracy establish and develop equality between
 people and correct relations between individuals and society.  These, then,
 are all important for the establishment of a high level of socialist.
 democracy.  In order to establish a high level of socialist democracy we
 must strengthen the construction of the socialist legal system, so that
 socialist democracy is institutionalized and codified into laws.  Institu-
 tions and laws are both fundamental, all-round, stable and long lasting.
 Only by firmly establishing the democratic powers used by the people to be
 masters of the society through legalization and institutionalization can we
 attain any definite guarantees for socialist democracy.  No doubt, some of
 the mistakes we made in the past were connected with the incorrect ideology
 of some of our leaders but they were also undoubtedly connected to the fact
 that the democracy system and its legalization were not complete.  Today,
 we have the ability and the need to strengthen the construction of the legal
 system and to establish and improve on all the various systems of democracy

 and to establish relevant.political, economic and social rules and regula-
 tions so that the working masses may have a clear standard by which to
 carry out surveillance of the cadres as well as restraining their own
 behavior and pouncing on all illegal activities in every legal way possi-
 ble, and thereby ensure good political, economic and social order.
 With a fully institutionalized and legalized system of democracy the people
 will have laws they may depend on and a set of rules by which they may live.
 One of the most important principles of the socialist system of democracy
 and its legal system is that everyone is equal in the eyes of the law.  If
 everyone works in strict accordance with the system of democratic centrali-
 zation and the legal system, it may appear troublesome and restricting but
 in the final analysis it is beneficial to the people.  Lawlessness appears
 very much simpler and more "free" but in actual fact it can only serve to
 help a small minority of degenerates.   By amassing all the experience
 gained in this area, in particular that gained through the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, the new party constitution clearly states that the party must act
 within the sphere of the constitution and the law.  Everyone from the
 central party down to the grassroots level must act in accordance with the
 constitution and the law.  Only by starting from the party body itself can
 we make the people understand the importance of a correct social attitude
 toward the legal system.
 Further promotion of the socialist relations of equality, unity and mutual
 assistance between all our nationalities is another important aspect of the
 establishment of a high level of socialist democracy in China.  Racial
 questions within a socialist epoch are basically a question of relations
 between working people of every race.  In the past we have made mistakes
 with the question of race, especially during the Cultural Revolution with
 the broadening of the class struggle which did serious harm to many minority
 race cadres and working people.  We did not attach enough importance to the
 question of autonomous powers for minority races.  After the smashing of the
 "gang of four," and in particular since the third plenary session of the
 party committee, the party has done a great deal of work in implementing
 race policies and thereby restoring good race relations.  China is a multi-
 nationality country founded and united with the joint efforts of many races.
 In addition to the Han race there are over 55 other national minorities
 making up 6 percent of the total population, with their homes covering
 between 50 and 60 percent of the total land area of China.  Our socialist
 cause is the common cause of every race in China and only by activating all
 races and joining together can we speed up the modernization of the mother-
 land.  Mao Zedong said, "The unification of the country, the unity of the
 people and the unity of all the races of China represent the fundamental
 guarantee for the success of our cause."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong,"
 Vol '5, p 363)  Based on Marx' racial theory and the realities of China's
 present situation, we should give attention to solving three major problems
 in our aim to promote racial equality, unity and mutual assistance:
 1) autonomy of national regions:   improve and strengthen the legalization of
 autonomy for national regions and ensure that party and national policies
 of autonomy are successfully implemented according to the realities of the
 situation in each national minority region and at the same time consolidate

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 democratic equality and unity between nationalities; 2) gradually eradicate
 inequalities between races in terms of politics, economics and culture and
 aid national minority regions to develop their economy and culture while
 actively striving to train and select national minority cadres; 3) recognize
 racial differences and nurture the special characteristics of each race.
 Handle racial contradictions carefully and oppose great nation chauvanism
 as well as local national chauvanism.
 Another fundamental part of the move to establish a high level of socialist
 democracy in China is to consolidate and strengthen a united and patriotic
 front.  According to Marx, only by liberating the whole of humanity can the
 proletariat class liberate itself.  The importance that the party places on
 a unified line is on a par with liberating the whole of humanity.  The
 united and patriotic line in China today is stronger and broader than it
 has been before.  The party continues to support various policies along
 with other democratic factions and parties, such as "long-term mutual
 coexistence and mutual surveillance," and "show utter devotion and mutually
 share honor or disgrace," and in addition the party practices equal treat-
 ment of people outside the party as well as discussion of all affairs and
 mutual learning.  This is a basic channel for strengthening the political
 alliance between party and nonparty and is in addition an important embodi-,
 ment of the broadening of the great socialist democratic lifestyle.  In our
 studying we must come to fully understand the importance of a united and
 patriotic line ruled by a strengthened party and the need to. gradually
 eliminate the influence of "leftist" thinking while seriously implementing
 all possible policies related to a unified front.
 /In studying the third important point we can concentrate on three ques-
 tions in order to understand things more fully.  1) Fully understand the
 party's basic appraisal and basic direction in terms of the question of
 class struggle in the present historical stage of China; 2) the need to
 support the policy of "two hands" in this present historical stage; and
 3) prevent and overcome two main types of errors and thereby strengthen the
 construction of socialist democracy./
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee the party Central
 Committee has made some estimates concerning the class struggle in China's
 present historical stage and as a result has come up with correct policy
 directions.  After the destruction of the exploitative class as a class,
 class. struggle was no longer the main contradiction of our society and thus
 we can no. longer use the slogan "take class struggle as the key link."
 Nevertheless class struggle will continue to exist within certain limits
 because of various domestic factors and international influence and indeed
 may even sharpen under certain conditions.  Practical experience tells us
 that this prediction is correct and tallies with the reality of the situa-
 tion.  Today, the sphere of the people is greater than ever before and now
 represents 99.9 percent of the total population., The target of our class
 struggle is that small percentage of the population which may be considered
 as an enemy element which is intent on the premeditated destruction of the
 economy, politics, ideology :and culture as well as the overturning of the
 socialist system.  The class struggle today is basically represented by the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 struggle of the people against this minority element.  Such a small enemy
 element cannot hope now to represent a class in itself and thus the strug-
 gle against these few is not the same as the struggles in the past which
 were struggles of class against class.  The activities of these elements
 reflect desires both within China and abroad to destroy the socialist cause
 and thus the struggle against them is of a very special nature.  With this
 in mind we must clearly come to differentiate, between contradictions
 between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions between the people, so
 as to avoid repeating the past mistakes of enlarging the scope of the class
 struggle.  Thus we must prepare ourselves-mentally for a long-term struggle
 and ensure that democratic dictatorship is exercised over these enemies and
 that a Marxist class viewpoint is upheld in handling the current social
 contradictions and other social phenomena that have the nature of class
 struggle.
 We must support the continued implementation of the basic party policies in
 dealing with the question-of class struggle and understand its importance
 for establishing a high level of socialist democracy in China.  For it will
 ensure and help develop the democratic powers of the people as well as
 exercise effective dictatorship over the small number of enemy elements in
 our midst.  Within China, one can still see the existence of class struggle
 and on the international scene we can still see imperialism and hegemony.
 Therefore, we must not ignore the function of dictatorship in China, or the
 construction of the people's army, police bodies, law courts and prisons
 and other such instruments of dictatorship.  The strengthening of such tools
 of dictatorship is not contradictory to the establishment of a high level of
 socialist democracy, but is in fact an important guarantee of such a
 democracy,.but is in fact an important guarantee of such a democracy.  In
 our studying we should increase our understanding and correctly unify our
 thinking to fall into line with the scientific estimates and predictions and
 basic policies of the party in relation to the present stage of class
 struggle in China.
 An important new phenomenon in the present class struggle is illegal activi-
 ties in economic and other areas of life, which have arisen under the new
 policies in China designed to open the country up to foreign countries and
 enliven its own economy.  Both foreign and domestic class enemies are using
 poisonous. bourgeois ideology to carry out a destructive battle against us.
 Such serious illegal activities have already begun to erode our cadres, harm
 the party, the government and the army as well as the good name of the
 country.  They are poisoning the people's thinking and polluting the social
 order as well as destroying economic construction and affecting social order
 and preventing the proper implementation of policies aimed at opening up to
 foreign *countries and enlivening the economy.
 Whether or not we can carry out a successful struggle against such illegal
 activities is related to the success or failure of China's socialist moderni-
 zation program and the prosperity or decline of the party and the country.
 Because of the decisive policies undertaken by the party this struggle has
 already seen initial success.   But because of specific historical conditions,
 the struggle will be a long one.  Thus we have decided that during this new

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 era of development of the socialist cause, we must use both hands.  One hand
 supports the open-door policy and the move to revitalize the economy and the
 other hand supports the move to fight all illegal activities within economic
 and any other  areas.  Because of the illegal activities in economic and
 other areas, it is possible that less attention would be given to the open-
 door policy and the invigoration of the economy.  On the other hand if we only
 concern ourselves with these invigoration policies then we ignore the struggle
 against illegal activities in economic and other areas.. Both these possibil-
 ities are incorrect and should not be allowed to occur and thus in our study-
 ing we must link everything to reality and rid ourselves of these incorrect
 ways of thinking.
 As far as class struggle is concerned, we must seek to prevent and overcome
 two main incorrect ways of thinking.  Since the third plenary session the
 party has made several new tactical policies and in so doing has corrected
 the former mistaken policy of "taking the class struggle as the key link"
 and criticized the idea of "using the class struggle to study and analyze
 everything."  Instead, the party has promoted the task of improving the
 system of socialist democracy and strengthening the legal system of social-
 ism.  This is entirely correct but some rightists misinterpret the party line
 and incorrectly believe that the class struggle no longer exists and that
 the class viewpoint of Marx is no longer applicable and even feel that the
 fight against economic and other types of corruption is not a class struggle.
 Even more serious is the fact that some people even turn a blind eye to the
 small'number of bad elements and their illegal activities as well as the
 corruptive invasion of bourgeois ideology.  Some people still have not rid
 themselves of the fetters of the concept of "making the class struggle the
 key point" and thus, with the appearance of economic corruption and the
 invasion of poisonous bourgeois ideology, they are unable to handle the
 situation correctly and feel that only with politicalization can the prob-
 lem be solved.  Such ideas as these are all wrong.  In our studying we must
 link everything with reality and look at historical and present experiences.
 In this way we can strengthen our watch against bourgeois corruption and
 support the purity of communist education as well as overcome the rightist
 mistake of ignoring the existence of class struggle.  Furthermore, we must
 respect the socialist legal system and use the weapon of the law to strike
 out at bad elements and thereby avoid a return to the old road of "taking
 ,the class struggle as the key link" and overcome "leftist" mistakes.

 HOW TO STUDY THE FIFTH PART OF THE 12TH CPC CONGRESS REPORT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 pp 45-48
 [Article by RED FLAG Editorial Office for Theoretical Education; passages
 within slantlines published in boldface]
 [Text] This part of the report expounds on the basic principles and poli-
 cies of China's relations with other countries, the major questions of our
 relations with other countries at present and the important principles of
 developing the relationships between our party and other communist or
 working-class parties.  In our study, we must grasp the following four main
 points:
 1.  The basic point of departure for our country to handle its relations
 with other countries.
 2.  The five principles of peaceful coexistence have consistently guided
 China in its efforts to develop relations with other countries.
 3.  Resolutely opposing imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism together
 with other Third World countries is our sacred international duty.
 4.  The important principles of developing relationships between our party
 and other communist or working-class parties.
 /While studying the first main point, it is advisable to deepen our under-
 standing in three aspects:  1) China's foreign policy fully reflects the
 integration of patriotism and internationalism.  2) We must have a further
 understanding of the correctness of our foreign policy by recalling the past
 and contrasting it with the present.  3) Adherence-to an independent foreign
 policy must go through struggles./
 China's foreign policy is based on Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  It
 proceeds from the fundamental interests of the people of. China and the rest
 of the world and fully embodies the integration of patriotism and inter-
 nationalism.  Being patriots, in relations with other countries we must
 resolutely safeguard our national interests or dignity, and we definitely
 cannot tolerate any encroachment of them.  Being internationalists, we must
 realize our national interests in the course of safeguarding the overall

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 interests of mankind and definitely not infringe upon the overall interests
 of mankind for the sake of narrow national interests.  Therefore, in inter-
 national activities we must always have the overall interest of the world in
 mind, support all undertakings conducive to safeguarding world peace and
 promoting human progress and try our utmost to make our own contributions
 in this respect.  In addition, as for the Chinese people who are struggling
 for socialist modernization, world peace and human progress are indispensable
 international conditions and a vehicle of supports  In the past, we always
 stressed that aid among all nations was reciprocal and that the just strug-
 gles of the people of other countries have helped the Chinese people and in
 turn the Chinese people have also helped the just struggles of the people of
 other countries.  In the future we will continue to support this view and act
 in such a way.  It is precisely because the basic point of departure of our
 foreign policy is based on patriotism and internationalism that it is com-
 pletely different from the diplomacy of capitulationism and humiliation which
 was pursued by the reactionary rulers in old China in the face of imperialist
 aggression and oppression, and is also completely different from the expan-
 sionist and hegemonist policies practiced by some big nations which rely on
 strength  to overpower weak nations.  It is an embodiment of the integration
 of patriotism and internationalism.  On the basis of adhering to our per-
 sistent principled stand, flexible methods and steps are adopted in light of
 the development of and changes in the situation.  In handling our external
 relationships, we uphold principles and also keep our promises and mean what
 we say.   Being diametrically opposed to the practices which regard the
 intercourse between different countries as a political game or as playing
 "cards," in its dealings with other countries China always has a long-term
 stand and firm principles, follows an overall long-term strategy and is
 definitely not swayed by expediency or by any external pressure or by any-
 body's instigation or provocation.  Our foreign policy has weathered all
 sorts of tests in the changing international situation and has gained
 prestige and made more and more friends throughout the world.
 In order to have a deeper comprehension of our independent foreign policy,
 let us look back at the bitter history of more- than 100 years after the Opium
 War in 1840 in which China was subjugated to the aggression of colonialist
 and imperialist big powers compelled China to sign unequal treaties by force
 of arms, willfully trampled upon our sovereignty, divided our territory and
 plundered our wealth; moreover, in order to exchange the recognition and
 support of the imperialists, the reactionary decadent Qing dynasty, the
 northern warlords and the KMT government would not hesitate to sell our
 state sovereignty and betray national interests.  As a result, China became
 weaker and weaker. and became impoverished.  It was not until the founding
 of the.PRC that this history of national betrayal and humiliation was
 thoroughly ended.  After the PRC was founded, the Chinese people really
 stood up.  China carried out an independent external policy, participated
 in. discussing and resolving international affairs on an equal footing, con-
 tinuously gained new and tremendous achievements in international activities
 and its international status rose rapidly.  On the basis of the five prin-
 ciples of peaceful coexistence, China has in the past 33 years, since the
 founding of the PRC, established diplomatic relations with more than 120
 countries, developed economic and commercial intercourse and cooperation in

 various fields with more countries and regions, and has thus provided our
 socialist construction with favorable international conditions.  In the
 course of our study, we must have a deeper comprehension of the principles
 and characteristics of our foreign policy through recalling the past and
 contrasting it with the present and lay an ideological foundation for doing
 a further good job in the foreign affairs work and developing relations with
 other countries.
 Under the present conditions, in order to adhere to an independent foreign
 policy it is still necessary to go through severe struggles.   Intern
 nationally, the superpowers which carry out a hegemonist policy will
 always try to rely;_, on their military and economic strength, which occupies
 a dominant position, to put pressure on China, menace the security of our
 country, interfere in our internal affairs and be unwilling to handle their
 relations with our country in an equal manner.  The process of our adher-
 ence to an independent foreign policy is a process of struggling against
 hegemonism.  Domestically, in a situation in 'which we follow a policy of
 opening to the outside world, in the dealings with foreign countries, some
 party members and cadres, seriously corrupted by foreign ideas, depart from
 the correct stand, lose moral quality and national dignity, infringe upon
 the state's interests to seek personal gains .and even sell secrets and
 betray the motherland; still other people stubbornly worship foreign things
 and fawn on foreign powers and lose the national confidence and their self-
 respect.  While studying we must proceed from realities, pay attention to
 waging. struggle against this sort of phenomena and eradicate their influ-'
 ence.
 /While studying the second main point, it is advisable to have a deeper
 understanding of the necessity of adhering to an independent foreign policy
 in social and ideological foundations;. at the same time, it is also neces-
 sary to understand that the five principles of peaceful coexistence are not
 only applicable to handling our relations with countries having!., different
 social systems but are also applicable to handling our relations with social-
 ist countries./
 The five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
 integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other.!,  internal
 affairs,, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence have con-
 sistently guided China in its effort to develop relations with other coun-
 tries.  China first put forth and has persistently upheld these five prin-
 ciples which have opened up a new path of developing international relations.
 The characteristics of previous foreign relations were that big nations
 could bully weak ones at will; big nations could wantonly oppress small
 ones;'some big nations and even one or two superpowers could dominate world
 affairs and manipulate the fate of the vast numbers of other countries.
 China has consistently held that all countries, whether big and small or
 powerful and weak, must be equal in the international arena and matters that
 concern the world must be jointly settled through consultation among all
 nations; that the sovereignty and integral territory of a country must be
 respected and no country whatsoever has the right to serve as an inter-
 national gendarme.or to brandish the baton and no country is allowed to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 occupy other countries' territories and interfere in the internal affairs
 of other countries.  In past years, China has strictly abided by the five
 principles of peaceful coexistence and never occupied a single inch of
 foreign land, never infringed upon the sovereignty of another country or
 imposed an unequal relationship upon another country and has proclaimed
 that under no circumstances will it seek heg~monism.  We have a solid
 social. and ideological foundation in doing things in this way.  In terms
 of, social foundation, we have established inlChina the socialist system
 with the people being the masters of the country.  This provides a social
 foundation for carrying out a peaceful policy in external work.  There does
 not exist in China the monopolistic capitalist class which needs to grab
 super-profits in other countries or the militlarist force which serves this
 class, so there is no need whatsoever for China to commit aggression
 against another country or to expand its territory.  In terms of the
 ideological foundation, we uphold proletarian internationalism, firmly
 believe that "a nation cannot become free and at the same time continue to
 oppress other nations" and "no people on earth who enslave a nation can
 escape punishment."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 4, p 410;
 Vol 18, p 629)  Therefore, in our external intercourses, we have all along
 strived for safeguarding unity and friendship among the people of all
 countries and will definitely not oppress and enslave another nation.  We
 have persistently supported the struggle for liberation of the oppressed
 people and nations and are convinced that communism will ultimately be
 realized throughout the world and strictly follow the principle of "revolu-
 tion cannot be exported."  In accordance with the historical materialist
 viewpoint, only the people of the country concerned can decide the fate of
 their own country.  The revolution of a country must rely on the political
 consciousness of the people of the country concerned and it cannot and also
 must not be forcefully imposed on the people from the outside.
 The five principles of peaceful coexistence are applicable to our rela-
 tions with all other countries.  The report separately expounds on China's
 relations with Japan, the United States and the Soviet Union.  Although
 conditions vary from country to country, our relations with them have a
 common spirit, that is, adherence to the five principles of peaceful
 coexistence.   In his opening'speech to the 12th CPC Congress, Comrade Deng
 Xiaoping pointed out:  "While we Chinese people value our friendship and
 cooperation with other countries and people, we value even more our hard-won
 independence and sovereign rights.  No foreign country can expect China to
 be its vassal, nor can it expect China to swallow any bitter fruit harmful
 to China's interests."  This is an expression of the Chinese people's firm
 stand of upholding the five principles and safeguarding the interests of
 the motherland and national dignity.
 In our external relationships, we uphold principles and wage appropriate
 struggle against the practices of those countries which deviate from the
 five principles of peaceful coexistence.  This will be conducive to the
 consolidation and development of relations based on the five principles
 rather than damaging our normal relations with those countries.  If we do
 not do so and further allow the phenomena which run counter to the five
 principles to develop unchecked, then the relations which have been

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 established and developed will also possibly regress and even be in danger
 of heading for a diplomatic breakdown.  Such are the relations between China
 and the countries which have different social systems from China's.  In our
 relations with other socialist countries, on;the basis of sharing identical
 goals and an identical basic stand and viewpoint, there will possibly emerge
 differing comprehensions and even differences of opinion on some matters,
 and therefore it is also necessary to solve the differences and contradic-
 tions of both parties concerned on the basis 'of the five principles of
 peaceful coexistence and through consultation based on an equal footing so
 that the bonds of friendship, unity and close cooperation can be continu-
 ously consolidated and developed.
 /While studying the third main point, we must deepen our understanding in
 three aspects:  1) Opposing imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism is the
 common task of the people of all Third World countries.  2) The unity and
 cooperation between China and other Third World countries has a historical
 and practical foundation.  3) Mutual cooperation among Third World coun-
 tries is of great significance./
 One characteristic of the present international situation is that the old
 system of colonialism has disintegrated but its remnants are far from being
 eliminated; the imperialists and colonialists are still attempting to safe-
 guard their vested interests in their former colonies and vassals.  The
 superpowers that practice hegemonism pose a new threat to the people of the
 world.  Their pursuit of global domination is the main source of instability
 and turmoil in the world.  Therefore, opposing imperialism, hegemonism and
 colonialism and striving for complete equality and reason in political and
 economic relations among nations are the common demands and fighting tasks
 of the people of the world, and in particular the people of the Third World
 countries, and the most important task of the people of the world today is
 to oppose hegemonism and safeguard world peace.  China is against all wars
 of aggression, including the world war being fomented by the superpowers,
 and all local wars of aggression which the superpowers instigate or back
 and regard supporting all victim countries and people in their struggle
 against aggression as its own international duty.
 China belongs to the Third World and the unity and cooperation  between
 China and the vast numbers of other Third World countries has a profound
 historical and practical foundation:  1) China has experienced sufferings
 similar to those of most other Third World countries.  Historically, China
 and most other Third World countries were for a long time subjected to
 colonialist and imperialist aggression and oppression.  In the struggle for
 national liberation, they stood on the same front line to oppose a common
 enemy and they went through thick and thin and enjoyed the joy of victory
 together.  2) China and most other Third World countries are faced with
 common problems:  in the international political arena, they are menaced
 and jeopardized by hegemonism; in international economic relations, they
 are unjustly and unequally treated by the old international economic order;
 and domestically, they are faced with, to varying degrees, the problems of
 economic poverty and cultural backwardness left over by history.  3) China
 and other Third World countries are faced at present with common tasks:
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 first and foremost, they should defend their national independence and
 state sovereignty and actively develop their national economies so that
 they can back up their political independence with economic independence.
 With a common basis, we can share a common destiny with Third World coun-
 tries and sincerely treat each other and cooperate in a friendly manner.
 Mutual cooperation with Third World countries, and in particular economic
 cooperation, will contribute to breaking the old unequal international
 economic order.  The so-called old international economic order is in
 essence an economic system under which the international monopolistic
 capital of the developed capitalist countries monopolizes the production,
 trade and finance of the world and exploits developing countries.  Through
 the export of capital and transnational corporations--monopoly enterprises
 of an international character, the developed countries control the produc-
 tion of important products of quite a few developing countries and grab
 super-profits in developing countries.  On the international market, in
 the trade between the developing countries which mainly export primary
 products and the developed countries which mainly export manufactured goods,
 the continuous widening of the scissors difference in exchange prices and
 the artificial forcing down of prices for many raw materials by the
 developed countries have made developing countries sustain a great loss.
 In financial and monetary fields, inflation and remittance fluctuations of
 the West have made foreign exchange reserves of developing countries suffer
 losses, and high interest and harsh terms on capital loans have added
 weight to the financial burdens of developing countries.  In order to reform
 this old international economic order, apart from striving to solve problems
 through negotiation with developed countries (the South-North dialogue),
 developing countries are strengthening their mutual economic cooperation
 (South-South cooperation).  This is of great significance.  It is conducive
 to establishing a new international economic order based on genuine equality
 and mutual benefit as well as fairness and rationality and to promoting
 developing countries to self-reliantly and steadily get rid of the relation-
 ship of economically hanging on to the coattails of developed countries.
 From a long-term point of view, "South-South cooperation" has a broad
 prospect.  Today China and many other Third World countries have been
 fruitfully putting an end to their respective economically and technically
 backward features.  This is a new force in the world economy which has a
 reservoir of potential.  If China is economically prosperous and flourish-
 ing, it will surely make more contributions to the development of "South-
 South cooperation" and the prosperity of the world economy.   .
 /While studying the fourth main point, it is advisable to deepen our under-
 standing of the important principles for our party to handle its relations.
 with foreign communist or working-class parties in light of the historical
 experience of the international communist movement./
 The principles for our party to handle its relations with other communist
 or working-class parties are in strict conformity with Marxism, adherence
 to independence, complete equality, mutual respect and noninterference in
 each other's internal affairs.  This is not only a summing up of the
 historical experiences of our party in handling its relations with foreign
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100400001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100400001-3
 communist parties but also an assimilation of the historical experiences,
 both positive and negative in the international communist movement.
 The.history of the international communist movement has told us that the
 socioeconomic conditions and political conditions of every country are
 complicated and multifarious.  The problems of revolution in any country,
 such as strategy, tactics and organizational forms, should be decided by
 the country's communist party or other working-class party under the
 guidance of Marxist principles and in accordance with the country's actual
 conditions and they should be tested and perfected in the continuous prac-
 tice of revolutionary work.  The reason why the Chinese revolution could be
 victorious is because our party was good at integrating Marxist universal
 principles with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, that is to
 say, China self-reliantly defined its own line, principles and policies.
 In his opening speech to the 12th CPC Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
 pointed out:  "Both in our revolution and construction, we should also
 learn from foreign countries and draw on their experience.  But mechanical
 copying and application of foreign experience and models will get us
 nowhere.  We have experienced many lessons in this respect.  To integrate
 the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of China, blaze
 a path of our own and build socialism with Chinese characteristics--this is
 the basic conclusion we have reached in summing up long, historical
 experience."
 The historical experience of the international communist movement has also
 proved that any attempt by one party (no matter how high its seniority and
 prestige are) to decide the internal affairs of other parties, to force-
 fully issue orders or to run the internal affairs of other parties will
 always produce poor results and can only lead to setbacks or failures in
 the revolutions of the countries concerned.  In maintaining contacts among
 the communist parties of different countries, one must only rely on the
 truth of Marxism to convince others rather than resorting to administrative
 means.  As for the practice of one party willfully interfering in the other
 parties' internal affairs and even compelling other parties to submit to it
 by force of arms, it can fundamentally run counter to proletarian inter-
 national principles and undermine the very foundation of the international
 communist movement.
 Of course, it is still quite necessary for all communist parties to exchange
 views and help each other on the basis of mutual respect and complete
 equality.  Each party has its own strong and weak points.  Each party is
 encouraged to learn from each other's successes and failures and draw use-
 ful lessons from them.

 ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL WORK AMONG EDITORIAL
 STAFF
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 20, 16 Oct 82 p 49
 [Article by Wen Zhao [2435 6856] and Che Yanming [6508 1750 2494]]
 [Text] Comrade Liu Shaotang's article "Ideological and Political Work
 Among Writers Should Be Strengthened," which was published in RED FLAG
 No 13, 1982, raised a seriously acute problem:  Among a very small number
 of people in literary and art circles, there exists an erroneous tendency
 to think very highly of oneself and feel cocky toward the party.  The
 article states:  "Only when ideological and political work among writers
 is strengthened, can we produce good works of literature and art, foster a
 good work style and promote the greater flourishing of socialist literary
 undertaking."  We consider that the article's argument is extremely apposite.
 However, we have one point to add:  We must also simultaneously strengthen
 ideological and political work among editorial staff and strive to heighten
 their sense of political responsibility.
 A completed item of work, although it reflects the ideology and political
 tendency of its writer, it is nevertheless necessary to go through the
 medium of the editor to use the work to influence and educate. the people.
 Therefore, editors must have a sharp ability to discriminate and a high
 level of sense of political responsibility.  What kinds of work should be
 published and what kinds of work should not be published?  This is a ques-
 tion of principle concerned with whether or not the party's literary under-
 taking can be safeguarded.  It is a pity that in a few publications, some
 works of, literature and art unexpectedly appeared which had a low style and
 even had extremely absurd content.  These works seriously damaged our party's
 image and the image of socialist new people, brought pollution to the
 spiritual life of the masses of the people and had an extremely harmful
 influence on the vast numbers of readers.  One of the important reasons why
 it was possible to publish these works is that some working editorial
 personnel failed to strictly examine and conscientiously distinguish these
 works, or they based their decision to publish the work merely on.the repu-
 tation of the writer.  It even happened that the publication of some works
 of literature and art was entirely due to the fact that the editor responded
 sympathetically to the thoughts of the writer.

 We can see from this that it is not enough to strengthen ideological and
 political work among writers alone.  While providing more effective party
 leadership in literary and art works and strengthening ideological and
 political work among the writers, further vigorous efforts should still be
 made to strengthen ideological and political work among working editorial
 personnel.  Only in this way can we ensure the publication of more works
 which fill people with enthusiasm and can we restore and develop the
 glorious tradition of revolutionary literature and promote the greater
 flourishing of socialist literary undertakings.
 Editor's note:  After reading Comrade Liu Shaotang's article "Ideological
 and Political Work Among Writers Should Be Strengthened," Comrades Wen Zhao
 and Che Yanming proposed that "attention should also be given to ideological
 and political work among editorial staff."  We consider their opinion to be
 quite correct.  It must be said that their opinion is not only applicable
 to the editors of literary and art newspapers and editorials but also to the
 editorial staff in such fields as new publication and theoretical propa-
 ganda.  In the last few years, great advances have been made in newspaper
 and periodical publication work and many comrades on the editorial staff
 have done their utmost to serve as a link between writer and reader and
 play the. part of a discrete matchmaker.   They have thus done a lot of work.
 However, there still exist some problems in editorial work.  Apart from
 those things mentioned by Comrade Wen Zhao and Che Yanming in their letter
 to us, according to readers' letters, there are still a small number of
 people who hanker after the indulgence of all sorts of unhealthy practices,
 such as the "study of relationships."  For example, a few people try their
 best to publish the manuscripts of their old acquaintances, friends and
 classmates, regardless of quality.  And there is a tacit agreement between
 different editors that you publish my work and I will publish yours.  Some
 editors even indulge in flattering each other in an unprincipled way.  What
 is more, they act willfully in accordance with their personal tasks, view-
 points and tendencies, they abandon principles, act without regard for the
 consequences and so on.  They do not, as they ought to, regard the news-
 papers and periodicals which they are involved in editing as the party's
 propaganda front.  All these practices not only make the quality of publi-
 cations inferior but also have a directly harmful influence on the readers.
 We are happy to see that this problem has aroused the attention of the
 departments and units concerned.  Quite a few units have examined and summed
 up their own editorial work and are strengthening ideological and political
 work among the editorial staff in the light of their respective actual con-
 ditions.   Through the examination and summing up work, the vast numbers of
 editorial working personnel have also acquired a deeper understanding of
 the glorious responsibility which they bear, and they are adding to their
 achievements, overcoming their mistakes and vigorously encouraging editorial
 professional morality so that together they can push the building of social-
 ist spiritual civilization forward.   Of course,. intensifying ideological
 education among editorial staff is a long-term task.  With regard to this
 question, this magazine wishes to encourage other fraternal newspapers and
 periodicals in our endeavor.
