 Principal Developments in World Communist Affairs
 (21 May to 19 June 1968)
 1.   Czechoslovakia
 a. Soviet/Czech Mutual Interest vs. Mutual Irritation
 For the most part, observers of the Czechoslovak scene have noted
 that the past month has witnessed a disposition of prbpagandists,of the
 Soviet Union and East Germany on the one hand and the news commentators
 and writers in Czechoslovakia on the other to emphasize their mutuality
 of interests andninimize the frictions between Czechoslovakia and the
 rest of the Soviet Bloc.   This is even more true on the part of the po-
 litical leaders of each side, as the many professions of mutual under-
 stading and confidence testify.   Apart from the fitful flare-ups of
 polemics on either side, the most serious discordant note was Pravda com-
 mentator Konstantinov's passing mention of a key member of the Dubcek
 regime, Cestmir Cisar, as an example of modern revisionism for Cisar's
 alleged disparagement of Leninism as a universal doctrine.   The attack
 was a unique example of Soviet media directly attacking a current Czech
 leader by name and was, moreover, gratuitious in that Konstantinov seems
 to have distorted Cisar's words and intent in the process.   It remains
 to be seen whether this is, as some Czech journalists speculate, a renewal
 of the polemical battle with even more ominous purposes than: heretofore.
 b.   Czech Press Freedom
 In a month of seeming reconciliation between the nervous Russians
 and East Germans with the centrist Dubcek leadership, the main bone of
 contentions remained the uncensored press and other information media in
 Czechoslovakia.   With amazing indiscretion it still raised issues that
 might throw in doubt, in the minds of many Soviets and East Germans the
 Dubcek regime's ability to control subversive tendencies in Czechoslovakia
 (i.e., threats to Czechoslovak Communist Party [CzCP] dominance and con-
 trol).   Cisar in fact cautioned the press to exercise self-restraipt in
 reporting and commentary on sensitive matters, while later reiterating
 that censorship would not be reimposed.   This latter promise may have
 been inspired by the recollection that press criticism was a major factor
 in the deposition of conservative leader Novotny and a realization that
 until the battle against the conservatives is decisively won the Dubcek
 leadership depends on the support of the liberal-minded news media.
 c.   Victory over Conservatives
 The conservative Communists are led by former President Novotny and
 comprise some 4+0 members of the 110-member CzCP Central Committee.   The
 Central Committee Plenum (29 May to 1 June) was a major test of strength
 between Dubcek and the conservatives.   Among the issues were the future
 status of Novotny and the early convening of a Party Congress (favored
 by the liberals and opposed by the conservatives).   The Plenum decided

 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030030-3
 to deprive Novotny of hip seat on the Central Committee, and, in addi-
 tion, to suspend his Party membership along with those of six other prom-
 inent Communists, all apparently conservatives.  A further victory over
 the conservatives was the approval for convening a Congress in September,
 at which a continuation of the attack on the conservatives is expected.
 Some observers believed that the Soviets, if not intent on preserving in-
 tact the conservative voice in the CzCP, would at least consider a con-
 servative setback at the Plenum as an additional sign of the unreliabil-
 ity of the Dubcek regime.   Thus far, however, there has been no unequivo-
 cal expression of Soviet disapproval of the purge of Novotny and the
 other conservatives, which Soviet media reported promptly, briefly, and
 without comment.   It may be that the Soviets decided that the situation
 called for maximum discretion.
 d.   Discouragement of Independent Political Parties
 A major potential threat to the Dubcek regime was the mushrooming
 of political and quasi-political movements which, in the wave of hope and
 optimism engendered by the accession to power of Dubcek and the promulga-
 tion of his liberalizing Action Program, strove for recognition as politi-
 cal entities independent of the CzCP and of the rubber stamp parties con-
 trolled by it in the National Front.   During the past month the regime
 served formal notice (apparently docilely accepted) that these incipient
 :independent organizations were impermissible on the Czechoslovak scene.
 On i6 May, Rude Pravo, the official organ of the CzCP, warned that such
 movements -- in the form of clubs or other similar organizations -- could
 not be legally fo1med or become active without prior approval by the
 Interior Ministry.   Shortly thereafter one such group (the Club of En-
 gaged Non-Party Members) cancelled its meeting and another group was
 prevented from carrying out a previously planned meeting.   It does not
 seem likely that such independent political organizations will gain ap-
 proval from the Dubcek regime in'the future.   Even moe  recent (mid-June)
 discussions of the National Front and the condemnation of proponents of
 independent parties, such as Ivan Svitak,tend to confirm this view.
 e.   The Military Maneuvers
 Though Soviet and Czech leaders have gone to great lengths to assure
 the Czech public and the world at large that the military maneuvers on
 Czech territory are a normal, planned, routine, innocuous exercise, there
 can belittle doubt that, intended or not, it is a form of insurance that
 any effort to overthrow the CzCP will not succeed.  At the same time,
 these maneuvers, coupled with the sporadic Soviet attacks on Czech publi-
 cists, are a measure of the continuing concern, objectively warranted or
 not, of the Soviet regime.   And despite the leveling off of nervous reac-
 tions, Soviet unqualified acceptance of the Czech Action Program of lib-
 eralization and democratization is still in suspense.

 2.   Extension of the Revolutionary Committee System in Communist China
 The revolutionary committees are a device for administering provinces
 since Mao's Red Guard and the Cultural Revolution destroyed the normal
 processes for governing.   They are composed of representatives of three
 elements:   the army, the Communist Party, and the Red Guard.
 The establishment of a revolutionary committee in Szechwan Province
 -- consisting of 70 million inhabitants and occupying a very important
 strategic area -- was hailed in a Peking New China News Agency broadcast
 on. 1 June 1968 as "a great victory for Chairman Mao's ... great proletar-
 ian cultural revolution" and as signaling "the complete bankruptcy of
 the criminal scheme of China's Khrushchev [President Liu Shao-chi], the
 others in the handful of top capitalist-roaders in the Party, and their
 agents to restore capitalism in Southwest China and Szechwan Province."
 Szechwan is bigger than France in size and almost equal to East and
 West Germany in population and is one of China's richest and most popu-
 lous provinces.   Bitter struggles have taken place in this region between
 anti-and pro-Mao elements for the past two years.   Even artillery and
 anti-aircraft guns were reportedly used throughout last year during the
 renewed outbreak of factional fighting. Since squabbling continued for
 over a year even among members of a military team appointed by Peking to
 form the revolutionary committee, some observers find it hard to consider
 the establishment of Szechwan revolutionary committee as a "victory."
 This new committee is the supreme body responsible for handling the af-
 fairs of the region, which were previously handled by the Communist Party
 Committee and local administrative offices.
 Only five of Communist China's 26 provinces and autonomous regions
 are still without such committees.   They are Fukien, Yunan, Tibet, Sink-
 iang and Kwangsi,   Failure thus to establish revolutionary committees in
 these provinces is reportedly considered pardonable because they are on
 a "war footing."  They border Russia, India, Burma, Laos, and North Viet-
 nam or face Formosa.   Szechwan was the last province in "peaceful" China to
 create a revolutionary committee.
 3.   Chinese Communist Support of Insurgent Movements in Northeast India
 Despite preoccupation with vast internal problems, Red China finds
 time and energy to export revolution.   In early June 1968, India report-
 edly sealed its Nagaland border with Burma to prevent Naga rebel "na-
 tionalists" -- armed, guerrilla-trained, guided and encouraged by Red
 China -- from returning to resume their fight for the "national independ-
 ence" of Nagaland and thus break the uneasy cease-fire so tortuously
 negotiated in September 1963 that halted their eight-year war with India.
 (The cease-fire is due to expire July 1st unless re-extended.)   This pre-
 ventive action was taken by the Indian government as a result of bloody
 Indo-Burmese border clashes in May which resulted in the death of some
 Indian troops and about 200 Naga rebels trying to return from China, the

 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030030-3
 capture of 24 rebels, and the seizure of large quantities of Chinese arms,
 ammunition and documents which, officials said, gave conclusive evidence
 of Naga links with China.
 The seriousness of Red Chinese subversive influence and designs on
 Nagaland cannot be taken lightly.  A Hindustan Times correspondent who
 visited Nagaland in April (this area has been barred to foreign corres-
 pondents for the past 8 years) and talked with the leaders and people was
 privately told by a "political thinker" in the rebels' underground "par-
 allel" government that the "political initiative and military direction
 of a Cuban type revolution in the offing in Nagaland have passed to Peking
 ... that the solution of the Naga problem, is no longer in our hands,"
 Coordination between China and the Naga rebels has greatly improved since
 the first group of Naga rebels marched to China, via Burma, in January
 1967 to enlist active Red Chinese support for their fight for "national
 independence" and were told that "training a guerrilla force was not
 enough," that the underground Naga political leadership must establish
 direct contact with Peking and must send its "political representative"
 there.   This was evident when the second group of Naga rebels that left
 for China in January 1968 found truck convoys waiting for them in northern
 Burma.   Over 1,000 Nagas are now reported to be in China -- receiving
 guerrilla training, arms and indoctrination -- and are not expected to
 return until the last quarter of 1968.
 (Nagaland consists of 6300 square miles of dense forest and steep
 hills, populated by 400,000 nature-worshipping animists, about three-
 fifths of whom are today converted Christian Baptists and only about one-
 fifth of whom can read and write.   There 16 Naga tribes which set aside
 their ancient feuds and formed a council seeking a more independent
 status.   They live in 800 Naga villages under a dual government -- the
 official, elected regime, and the undergound nationalist one.)
 Indian security forces, concerned as well about the growing evidence
 of Red Chinese training and equipping of rebels from the Mizo Hills and
 Manipur -- in northeastern India's remote hill country which adjoins
 Nagaland, borders Burma and lies close to East Pakistan -- have also in-
 tensified their security patrols in these border areas to prevent further
 Chinese subversion there as well as to prevent further raiding and plund-
 ering of the Union territory of Tripura by these rebels.
 In late April 1968, the Government claimed a sudden outburst of hos-
 tility in the Mizo Hills involved heavy casualties on both sides and it
 confirmed officially that some of the weapons used by those indulging in
 subversive activities in the Mizo Hills, Nagaland and Manipur are of Chi-
 nese origin.  About the same time, another report claimed that groups of
 Mizo rebels, trained and equipped by the Chinese, entered the Mizo Hills
 from, the Chittagong Hill tracts in East Pakistan and that Red China had
 shipped weapons to Chittagong camps in East Pakistan to arm and train
 Mizo rebels. Still another late April Indian Government report warned

 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030030-3
 that India may have to resort to military operations to deal with increas-
 ing instability in the remote hill areas of northeast India -- in Assam,
 Manipur and Nagaland -- and added that "Mizos have also gone to China and
 continue to conduct guerrilla operations" from there.
 (The 300,000 members of the Mizo tribes, 90% of whom profess to be
 Christian and nearly half of whom are literate, live in the Mizo Hills
 -- in the southern finger of Assam state on India's northeast border with
 Burma.   Only about one-third of the Mizos are reportedly securely under
 government control.   Since 28 February 1966, the 7,000 square miles of
 the Mizo Hills have been aflame with rebellion.)

 Ho Chi Minh's Domestic Problems and the Vietnam War
 No war can be fought without problems, and the problems engendered
 by war are never peculiar to one side.   The world press has concentrated
 so heavily on those with which the Allies must contend, however, that it
 has been difficult to bring Hanoi's difficulties into the limelight.   Like
 anyone else, He Chi Minh has his troubles, both military and political,
 and they are grave.   Indications of those problems are not as readily
 apparent to the free world as those of the Allies are to the Communist
 world, but Hanoi's troubles are gradually being catalogued -- in captured
 documents, in casualty lists, in the growing importance of defectors and
 number of prisoners of war, in cullings from her press and radio.   The
 following are only a few of Hanoi's problems, but knowledge of a portion
 of them makes it possible to deduce others now and is assurance that other
 problems will gradually bob to the surface.
 War weariness must be deduced for the most part, but it must inevi-
 tably be part of the dreary life in North Vietnam -- for her people, her
 leaders and possibly even her military establishment.   Movies and eye-
 witness accounts attest to the discomfort of life under regular air at-
 tack, but life is undoubtedly uncomfortable also as a result of food and
 consumer goods shortages.   Resentment must be growing when those who can
 afford to patronize the black market manage to feed and clothe themselves
 with relative ease, and resentment -- even active disobedience to party
 authority -- has actually been reflected in Hanoi's recent anti-subversion
 law (see attachments).  Water supply problems chronically plague North
 Vietnam (Hanoi's propagandists, ignoring the fact that damage to reservoirs,
 and other facilities is an annual phenomenon during the rainy season,
 blame it on deliberate U.S. air attacks against water installations).
 Housing shortages are also a problem as are the absence of hygiene, the
 scarcity of medicine and medical aid, the separation of families, the loss
 of Vietnam's young men -- all the ugly accompaniments of life for a people
 whose country is waging war.   It would be interesting to learn what those
 who have and are undergoing these privations feel about He Chi Minh's
 avowed intent to extend the war for 10, 15 or 20 years if necessary.
 The dismal state of North Vietnamese agriculture is a major problem
 for the country.   For several rice harvests years have fallen seriously
 below the four and one-half million ton averages of the early 1960's
 partly as a result of bad weather, partly from mismanagement, partly from
 the necessity to shift men and materiel from agriculture into more direct
 support of the war effort.   The diet of the general population has been
 maintained at a bare minimum and even this has been accomplished only by
 imports of rice, wheat, flour and other foodstuffs from Communist China
 and the Soviet Bloc; imports have 'been massive they will unquestionably be
 higher yet in 1968.
 A third problem directly related to both of the above is the diffi-
 cult and increasingly dangerous task of infiltrating more troops and
 supplies from North Vietnam into the South -- North Vietnam could, in
 fact, be viewed as a combination funnel and arsenal, which is permitted
 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030030-3
 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030030-3
 to consume only the minimum essentials while processing and transporting
 to the South whatever is needed for the conduct of operations there.   The
 North Vietnamese people have apparently accepted this role -- as they do
 living with a war -- without enthusiasm or much resistance.   Although U.S.
 bombing is today limited almost entirely to interdiction of the infiltra-
 tion routes in the panhandle, the massive repairs to be made further
 north and the task of maintaining and repairing the full lines of commu-
 nication require more than 200,000 full-time workers and several hundred
 thousand more part-time workers.
 Manpower requirements, as represented only in small part by the 200,000
 workers needed for the infiltration routes, are a burgeoning problem for
 North Vietnam.   Workers are needed with ever increasing urgency in trans-
 portation, agriculture, communications, engineering and labor battalions,
 industry, domestic defense and in North Vietnam's Armed forces (see at-
 tachments for details).   One of the means Hanoi is using to alleviate her
 manpower requirements has recently been revealed in the assignment to
 North Vietnam of 40-50,000 Chinese in engineering, labor and railway bat-
 talions.   This partial "solution" to the manpower problem may well create
 an even more serious problem.   The Chinese comprise a difficult-to-
 assimilate part of the population and a potential menace for the future
 (as they were in North Vietnam after World War II or in North Korea after
 the fighting ended there in 1953).   Many thousands of Chinese technicians
 and laborers arrived during the past three years at Hanoi's request to
 keep supplies moving, to build war-related facilities and to help cope
 with the bomb damage; their political activities in giving the North Viet-
 namese people daily lessons in the thoughts of Mao Tse-tung were their
 own idea.
 North Vietnamese geographic and economic dependence on China and the
 Bloc is a virtually insoluble problem.   North Vietnam's dependence upon
 the Soviet Union and the Bloc for vast quantities of military supplies
 and Peking's rift with Moscow further complicate Hanoi's efforts to steer
 a careful course between the two Communist giants while attempting to
 extract the maximum concessions from each with the minimum of repayment
 or other commitments.   The emphasis, in fact, has been on grant aid rather
 than credits, since it is unrealistic to expect a poor country, and one
 whose exports and foreign currency holdings are near the zero mark, to
 repay the vast debts Hanoi is incurring in this war.
 Peking's negative attitude regarding peace negotiations undoubtedly
 exacerbates any friction which exists in the Lao Dong Politburo between
 the pro-Peking and pro-Moscow factions as well as between the Politburo's
 hawks and doves.   It is difficult to see. how a country or people whose

 North Vietnamese casualties (as well as those of the Viet Cong) have
 been frightful.   Since January 1961, the number of enemy dead has been
 over 360,000.   Forty thousand of these deaths are estimated to have oc-
 curred during the Tet offensive.   (However, there are close to 350,000
 men in the armed forces still in North Vietnam and Hanoi's militia and
 security forces are at least that size.   Out of a population of 18 mil-
 lion, North Vietnam has nearly three million males between the ages of
 17 and 35; and additional 200,000 males reach the age of 17 each year,
 more than half of whom are fit for military service.)
 Declining troop morale in the North Vietnamese Army is illustrated
 by the increasing number of high-level defectors from the NVA as well as
 a greater number of unit surrenders.   The comments of these men in press
 conferences, interviews, prisoner interrogations, etc., have vividly re-
 vealed that life in the NVA is sometimes hungary, frequently depressing
 and always hazardous (.:>ce cornmi3nts, of Lt. Colonel Dung and ot]-~er ,, a,ttticl c d) .

 Assessment of North Vietnam. Media:
 Indications of Increasing Morale Problems in North Vietnam
 (as of December 1966)
 An article in the Hanoi Army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan of 1 November
 revealed the North Vietnamese regime's fears about army morale.  Written
 by one Trung Cong, the article amounted to a warning to the Party to step
 up ideological education before "rightist'," i.e. defeatist, thoughts ir-
 remediably affected the army's fighting spirit.
 In its theme of the conflict between "proletarian" and "non-prole-
 tarian" thoughts, the article defined the latter as "rightist, negative
 and individualistic thoughts when faced with new ordeals`."  These were
 said to take shape and develop if the "ideological task is not carried
 out constantly'..`  There were army units which had to struggle against
 these negative thoughts because "the battleground of proletarian ideol-
 ogy in these units is steadily consolidated every day'."  Faced with hard-
 ship and "temporary, partial losses," a number of soldiers were failing
 to entertain "correct views and thoughts."   Only a "thorough education"
 could bring soldiers' thoughts into line with the Party's views, and a
 careful check: should be kept on "the trend of the development of thought."
 The article implied that the ideological leadership had failed in
 its "central task" of "ensuring that everyone has a steadfast anti-U.S.
 national salvation determination."   It criticized the leadership for
 lacking "an objective and scientific method of study as well as a firm
 mass outlook."   This had resulted in a failure to understand "the mind
 of the masses."
 Although it was hinted that "passive phenomena,"  (i.e. a war weari-
 ness) had arisen after fierce battles, the article claimed that "suffer;.-
 ing losses and making sacrifices do not mean that we are not winning".
 If this thought was borne in mind, Trung Cong concluded, "we will always
 be optimistic, confident and resolute."
 Problems of morale are on the increase generally in North Vietnam.
 It is clear that there is a strong body of opinion critical of the Hanoi
 regime's aggressive policy which has exposed the North to US-South Viet-
 namese bombing raids.   The people who hold these views are certainly in
 the leadership, as well as in the army and among the civilian population.
 Evidence that they are in the leadership, possibly at a high level,
 is to be found: in an article by Hoang Qtloc Viet in the July issue of the
 party periodical, Hoc Tap.
 Viet, one of the most influential members of the Communist (Lao Dong)
 party leadership, who is believed to favor China's hard line, was much
 concerned about the "new workers" who were becoming "very easily perplexed
 when faced with difficulties and hardships'.'.'  He considered that it had
 become an "extremely urgent problem" to struggle resolutely against."

 "pacifist ideas."  It had to be admitted, the article said, that  "a number
 of our comrades have lacked a correct view of the working class in con-
 solidating and safeguarding the north and liberating the south.   As a
 result, certain front policies have not been strictly carried out."
 As these "comrades" were in a position to prevent the implementation
 of front policies, it can be assumed that they hold important Party or
 Government posts.
 On 8 October Hanoi Radio also admitted that in the present situation
 "many of our people are worried" and it was likely that "their worries
 might affect their struggle spirit."  Some people, the broadcast said,
 had thought that "we should be a little bit more yielding and flexible
 in order to avoid bloodshed and killing.   They believe that the use of
 diplomatic skill may sometimes spare sacrifices."  However, "For our part
 we think otherwise ... we are deeply aware that independence and freedom
 cannot be achieved through negotiations and talks but only through the
 shedding of our blood."
 The problems resulting from loss of morale have led to a general
 tightening up of security and consequently to increased emphasis on the
 role of the security forces.   President Ho Chi Minh spoke to the North
 Vietnamese People's Security Forces Emulation Conference (broadcast on
 22 October) urging security officers and men to "perfect their organiza-
 tion" and "strive to improve revolutionary morality."  They should be
 "sincerely united, must completely eliminate individualism, must thorough-
 ly correct arrogant bureaucratic and overbearing manners, and must es-
 tablish very good relations between the security forces and the people."
 One of their principal tasks was to "deepen their hatred for the U.S. ag-
 gressors."
 The Party daily Nhan Dan, in an editorial on 22 October, stressed that
 the security forces had been ordered to "check in time and suppress all
 pilots of the reactionaries in order satisfactorily to protect our leading
 organs and armed forces..."
 An editorial on 27 November in Quan Doi Nhan Dan emphasized the need
 to review regularly the rules governing "the preservation of secrets and
 the prevention of enemy penetration in the units of the people's armed
 forces, in the public authorities, schools and co-operatives" and to sup-
 plement them when necessary.   Security methods should be integrated "into
 the firm pattern of our daily life."  It was essential to "react skilfully
 to all events as they occur, not letting them affect other localities
 "Backward elements" must be reformed; "reactionary elements" should be
 suppressed.
 Combined with these warnings and exhortations to vigilance are attacks
 on American "deceitful propaganda."  The editorial warned that the United
 States used "material means to buy up certain elements along with spread-
 ing false rumors and putting forward hypocritical sugar-coated arguments
 which had "the dark aim of paralyzing our army's and people's vigilance

 It is a tribute to their skill that In all the

 negotiated by night.

 three months: akilo-and-a-half of dried

 thinks the war will go on for a.
 long time If the allies pursue
 a military victory.
 "If  we  want  to  crush
 the other side militarily, It will
 take a long time and the cost
 will be high," Dung said.
 "But there are other ways to
 end the war. We can exploit
 divisions on their side. We can
 perhaps  find  a way to get
 them to rally In groups, not
 singly as I did,"
 Dung, who had commanded
 a regiment,  is certain that
 other  Vietcong  officers and
 soldiers share his doubt that
 the war will never be solved
 militarily and he believes that
 many also arc not certain they
 Foe Seen Resigned
 "Since  1965,  everyone' (in
 the Vietcong) has known that
 there can be no military solu-
 tion to the war," Dung said, in
 a long interview.
 Dung angered one military
 interrogator several days car.
 her  by refusing to give de.
 tailed information about the
 Vietcong   165th   Regiment,
 tvhich he commanded before
 he defected.
 He had said that many of
 the Vietcong are his rriends
 and  he is not eager to see
 them killed. He wants to aid
 the  Saigon  government but
 not  by simply informing on
 his unit.
 3 Phases Since 1963
 The Colonel came back from
 several years in North Viet.
 nam in 1963. Ile divides the
 years  since then into three
 phases.
 In the first, "when there
 were only American advisers.
 f
 ous  difficulty-they  had to
 leave ten dead and one ma-
 chine gun behind.
 Dung fought most of the
 time in the Highlands along
 the Cambodian border. In the
 second phase, he said, his
 troops would usually have the
 advantage at the start of each
 battle because of surprise at-
 tacks  and slow Allied reac-
 tions. But when the reaction
 and the planes came, Dung
 said, the advantage shifted.
 The third phase began with
 the Tet attacks on the cities,
 he said, He found this fighting
 extremely difficult for his reg.
 inient.
 VC Leaders' Concern
 "Vietcong  leaders want to
 create an Impact In the world

 "if we fulfilled our responsi-

 Dung said he had difficulty
 communicating the situation
 he saw in the field to his supe-
 riors. He was amused when an
 American told him that U.S.
 officials   in  Vietnam  fre
 quently make the same com-
 plaint.
 Dung, 38, gave up to'South
 Vietnamese      authorities in
 l3lnhduoing Province May 7 as
 the Vietcong made their sec-
 ond major effort to attack Sai-
 gon. Ile said that he first
 thought of doing so 11 years
 ago, "when It was clear there
 would be no elections to re-
 unify Vietnam."
 Joined Vietminh at 15
 He joined the Vietminh at
 15; at 16 he was a member of
 the Communist Party. He was
 a 24year-old deputy battalion
 commander when the French
 were defeated In 1954.
 Dung went to North Viet-
 nam after the partition of the
 namcse :+l'my.
 "I am proud of joining the
 Vietminh to fight against the
 French," he said. ""But I began
 to find that communism was
 not the right doctrine for me,"
 But three things made it dif-
 ficult for him to decide to
 ahandon the Communists,
 Dung said.
 He was not sure that the
 government in Saigon was any
 better than the government in
 Hanoi; the  Americans were
 supporting  Saigon  and  he
 thought they were responsible
 for blocking the national elec-
 tions called for by the Geneva
 agreements; also, he had many
 friends  on the  Communist
 side.
 Thinks Capitalism Better
 Dung said he knew little of
 capitalism  except  what he
 learned from Communist lec-
 tures and books, but he believ-
 ed that capitalism could make
 the people happy and the coun-
 try strong.
 "It was not all good, but if

 munism with capitalism, capi-
 talism is better."
 die decided that the Saigon
 government had many faints,
 but, was better than the gov-
 ernment in Hanoi.
 "As  a Vietnamese," Dung
 said. "I don't like to have for-
 eigners--especially fore I g n
 troops-in the country."
 It took much thought before
 he decided that the Americans
 were not the aggressors and
 were  not seeking a colonial
 empire in Vietnam, he said.
 He compared the actions of
 the United States in Vietnam
 and the Soviet Union in Hun-
 gary and found them Identical,
 Dung said:. If Russia was not
 an  aggressor,  neither  was
 America, lie said. Ile thinks no
 encroachments by communists

 the "free market" the price of white

 per cent since early  1965, when

 AGRICULTURE:  A CONSPICUOUS WEAKNESS OF COMMUNISM
 1.   Agriculture has been labelled the "Achilles heel" of Commu-
 nism.                            Communist agriculture has bitterly disappointed the reasonble
 expectations of people in Communist-run countries.   The total amount
 and quality of agricultural products are lower than the land and farmers
 could produce under less restrictive conditions.   The prices are higher
 than they would be if economic forces determined the rates of production
 and means of distribution.   Thus, Communist agriculture fails to yield
 a fair return for the work of either the farmer or the consumer.
 2.   Assets addressing mass audiences may emphasize the historical
 pattern of unreliability of Soviet farm production, the brutal treat-
 ment of farmers during collectivization, and the subsequent neglect
 of farmers and of the development of farming, as well as the current
 limited and less than whole-hearted efforts to correct the accumulated
 deficiencies of Soviet agriculture.
 3.  Addressing intellectuals, assets may draw on both the scholarly
 conclusions of the Britisher Dr. Klatt and the acid criticisms of Czech
 writer Jan Prochazka concerning the ideological shortcomings of Marxist
 agriculture (see unclassified attachments).   Emphasis can be given to
 the   shallowness of Soviet attempts to uphold Marx' and Lenin's formu-
 lations on agriculture.
 4.   Continued attention to the shortcomings of Communist agricul-
 ture is especially important in developing areas whose populations are
 predominantly agrarian.   Governments and intellectuals in these coun-
 tries may be dazzled by the (true and alleged) advances of Soviet,
 Chicom and other Communist industry, military technology, etc.   Our
 assets should keep reminding them that their first problem is to pro-
 vide adequate food for their rapidly increasing populations and that
 no Communist country can effectively assist them in fulfilling this
 most fundamental and truly vital task.
