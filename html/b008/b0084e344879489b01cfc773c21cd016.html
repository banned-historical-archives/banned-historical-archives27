 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 The keynote of Khrushchev's
 address to the Supreme Soviet
 on 14 January was his portrayal
 of the growth of Soviet strength.
 Khrushchev claimed in effect
 that Soviet power,  both eco-
 nomic and military, has achieved
 a "breakthrough"--so strength-
 ening the bloc's position vis-
 a-vis the non-Communist world
 as to permit a one-third re-
 duction in Soviet armed forces
 --a pronouncement which has ma-
 jor implications for East-West
 negotiations.
 The USSR,  he implied,  is
 so far advanced in rocket weap-
 ons that the conventional ground,
 air, and surface naval forces
 and the military requirements
 which necessitated their main-
 tenance have lost much of their
 earlier significance.   He
 argued that formidable weapons
 the USSR already possesses and
 "incredible" weapons to come
 permit it to economize in the
 military sphere.
 While Khrushchev sees war
 as marking the end of capital-
 ism, he also recognized ex-
 plicitly--for the first time--
 that neither great power could
 attack the other without re-
 ceiving devastating retalia-
 tion.   War thus is no longer a
 rational course for either side,
 and,  in his view,  the advance
 of Communism is thus facili-
 tated,   since the West can no
 longer resort to arms to stem
 the "tide of history."
 Troop Reduction
 In speaking of a reduction
 in the armed forces,Khrushchev
 for the first time gave offi-
 cial figures on the size of the
 Soviet military establishment.
 He said the armed forces fell
 from 11,400,000 men in 1945 to
 3,600,000 at present--about
 640,000 less than American esti-
 mates.   After the new reduc-
 tion, he said,  the armed forces
 would be down to 2,400,000 men.
 These figures apparently ex-
 clude security troops--believed
 to number 350,000 men,
 A troop reduction of 1,-
 200,000 within the next two
 years would be in line with the
 decrease in the number of men
 reaching conscription age and
 with the growing needs of the
 economy for labor.   The Soviet
 premier's references to some
 future military training within
 territorial units may indicate
 a plan to offset the effect of
 a reduction in regular forces.
 Large numbers of men could be
 trained under this supplemen-
 tary reserve program without ac-
 tually being conscripted into
 the armed forces.
 Impact on Military Doctrine
 The proposed troop   reduc-
 tion appears to reflect Khru-
 shchev's own ideas on modern
 warfare--reliance on missiles
 as the chief element of offen-
 sive and defensive power.   He
 played down the importance of
 surprise attack with modern
 weapons as not giving any coun-
 try "an advantage for achieving
 victory."   The Soviet Union,
 he implied,  is developing a
 second strike capability--locat-
 ing its "rocket facilities in
 such   a  way  as   to  ensure

 duplication and triplication...
 so that if some of the means
 earmarked for a retaliatory
 blow were put out of commission
 one could always.  .  .hit targets
 from reserve positions."
 Khrushchev further asserted
 that war would begin,  not on
 national borders,     but in the
 heart of warring countries.
 "Moreover, there would not be
 a single capital, not a single
 major industrial or administra-
 tive center,  not a single stra-
 tegic area which would not be
 subjected to attack,  not only
 during the first days, but dur-
 ing the first minutes of the
 war."
 Khrushchev implied that,
 after the proposed cuts,  there
 will be a preponderant emphasis
 on a nuclear striking capabil-
 ity,            although Defense Minister
 Malinovsky, who spoke after
 Khrushchev at the Supreme So-
 viet, clearly reasserted the
 need for maintaining a proper
 balance among the various arms.
 Malinovsky added that the So-
 viet Army and Navy now are
 training primarily for inflict-
 ing a "destructive retaliatory
 blow."
 Khrushchev implied signif-
 icant changes in the employment
 of the Soviet armed forces.  The
 reductions in conventional
 forces suggest that mission
 priorities and the present dis-
 position of these forces may
 have been re-examined, and may
 perhaps even result in a re-
 duction of forces in East Ger-
 many.   In general,  the reduc-
 tion in numbers will be offset
 somewhat by the continuing em-
 phasis on firepower and mobility
 --in particular by a further
 improvement in Soviet airlift
 capabilities.
 Evidence is lacking to
 support the Soviet leader's
 implication of substantial ICBM
 capability in being.   His ref-
 erence to "incredible new weap-
 ons" and his missile rattling
 seem in considerable part de-
 signed to reassure the Soviet
 public as well as to warn the
 Western powers that the pro-
 jected reduction does not en-
 danger Soviet security.
 Conventional armaments
 were again played down by Khru-
 shchev.   He said the air force
 and navy had lost their former
 importance in view of the mod-
 ern development of military
 equipment.   Almost the entire
 air force,  he said,  is being
 replaced by rocket equipment,
 and the USSR will continue to
 cut   and even discontinue pro-
 duction of bombers and other
 obsolete equipment.
 In the navy, Khrushchev
 said, submarines are assuming
 great importance but surface
 vessels no longer play the part
 they once did.   He added that
 Soviet armed forces to a con-
 siderable extent have shifted to
 rocket and nuclear arms, that
 some artillerymen   and airmen
 will be used in newly formed
 rocket units,  and that rocket
 and nuclear weapons will con-
 tinue to be perfected until
 such  time  as they are banned.
 Soviet military production
 programs in the recent past
 bear out Khrushchev's state-
 ments.                                                                    Of eight plants pro-
 ducing bombers in 1955, only
 one does so at present.   This
 plant has been  producing
 one or two Bison  heavy bombers
 per month over the past two
 years.
 The future of Soviet fight-
 er aircraft was not so clearly

 written off but                                   it  has   been

 sign and production difficul-
 ties with  new fighter                                                                   types
 may be in large part responsi-
 ble for the small numbers pro-
 duced in the last year or  so,
 theymay also reflect some doubt
 about the future of the manned
 fighter.
 Soviet naval shipbuilding
 has  decreased  rapidly after
 reaching a peak in 1955-56.
 Much experimental work  has
 been done  on new types  of
 naval vessels,  but no   deci-
 sion is apparent  to mass-pro-
 duce  any of  the new types on
 the scale of the 1950-55 pro-
 grams.
 Soviet Economy
 In speaking of the Soviet
 economy,   Khrushchev said  the
 Seven-Year Plan could be  met
 with or without the troop.re-
 duction and concurrent                         mone-
 tary saving, and that the budg-
 et could stand an increase                   in
 expenditures for  the  armed
 forces,  if this became   neces-
 sary, without detriment  to the
 economic plan.   The Soviet Un-
 ion is proceeding, he said,not
 from budgetary weakness but
 from economic strength.
 It is believed the  USSR
 would probably have fulfilled
 the industrial targets of the
 Seven-Year Plan in any event,
 but a troop reduction will in-
 crease the possibility of over-
 fulfillment.    Khrushchev's
 speech reflects a Soviet judg-
 ment that it is more advantage-
 ous to apply resources to ad-
 vanced weapons or to economic
 growth rather than to large
 conventional military forces.
 This transfer of resources may
 actually have been going on
 for some time.
 Khrushchev's  statement
 that the armed forces at present
 comprise only 3,600,000 men--as
 opposed to 4,300,000 estimated
 hefetofore--means that billions
 of rubles (some 20-25  billion
 rubles for 1960) more than es-
 timated have been available an-
 nually in recent years for oth-
 er military  or  economic pur-
 poses.   In     the future,                                                            after
 the additional   future   troop
 cuts, 16-17 billion rubles per
 year will   be available          for

 21 January 1960
 whatever use--advanced weapons,
 industrial investment, and con-
 sumer goods--Khrushchev wishes
 to make of them.   The resources
 in terms of manpower and equip-
 ment represented by 16-17 bil-
 lion rubles are not, however,
 immediately transferable to
 these ends.
 The possibility that more
 resources than estimated  have
 been used for military hard-
 ware for some years and the
 prospect that proposed troop
 cuts will make more funds avail-
 able in the next few years will
 not alleviate the physical lim-
 itations on providing launching
 facilities, missiles, equipment,
 and trained operating personnel
 involved in attaining a force
 of 140 to 200 ICBMs on launcher
 by mid-1961.   The time required
 to provide these after an ini-
 tial operating capability  has
 been achieved--in this case es-
 timated to be 1 January 1960--
 is relatively fixed, and would
 not be altered significantly
 by allocating additional funds.
 The Soviet premier pointed
 up  the progress of   Soviet in-
 dustry in the past year.   He
 said the growth  in value  of
 gross industrial production
 was "more than   11 percent,"
 against a planned goal of 7.7
 percent.   Production of steel,
 coal, petroleum, and electric
 power was about as planned;
 labor productivity and housing
 plans were also reported over-
 fulfilled.
 Political Implications
 It was obvious from Khru-
 shchev's speech that  his pro-
 posals met considerable resent-
 ment; he went to some lengths
 to reassure his military peo-
 ple that those affected by the
 reductions will be given spe-
 cial treatment while adjusting
 to civilian life.   He also took
 great pains to emphasize that
 Soviet strength will be in no
 way impaired by his   proposed
 cuts.   Khrushchev's proposals
 may stem from a fairly recent
 decision.    Last   March at a
 press conference, he said,  "We
 are not going to reduce   our
 armed forces further,"   adding
 that  Western  reluctance   to
 agree to disarmament meant that
 the USSR must "keep its powder
 dry."
 There are no doubt impor-
 tant groups  in  the Soviet
 Union which in some  degree
 opposed the plan to cut   the
 armed forces.   Khrushchev him-
 self has admitted from time
 to time that his military lead-
 ers are  a problem  because of
 their   hidebound opposition to
 change. At the   same time
 Khrushchev is quick  to empha-
 size that he has consulted
 with the general staff.   Almost
 immediately after the speech,
 Malinovsky and five others came
 to   the  podium  to support
 the   move.   A subsequent rally
 at   the headquarters   of   the
 Moscow Military District to
 support the proposals was   at-
 tended                                                                     by no less than  five
 presidium members.      Such rallies
 of   the military  are rare,   the
 last ones   being  in 1957 when
 Zhukov was removed      and in 1953
 when   Beria was ousted.

 State Planning Commission stated

 Khrushchev's speech is
 the most sweeping Soviet claim

 opinion,  "Never before has the

 peace,  been so great as today.
 ... We support our proposals

 The Soviet premier but-

 of the "relation of forces"
 in the world arena by depict-

 a state of disarray and alarm.
 As in all his major foreign
 policy speeches since his visit

 marked shift in the Western,
 particularly American,  attitude
 toward the USSR--a shift to-
 ward growing recognition that
 a "fundamental shift" in the
 East-West balance of power has
 occurred.   He asserted that
 "ossified conceptions" in West-
 ern policy are breaking up,
 especially in the United States,
 and that Western statesmen have
 finally come to see that their
 "policy of strength" has failed.

 the question of German partici-
 pation.    His   assurance                          that
 the interests of small states
 not represented at the summit
 will be fully protected ap-
 pears to have been addressed
 in part to the East Germans.
 Khrushchev  gave no  hint
 that he believes his long-range
 strategy based on pressure for
 a German   peace treaty and  an
 end to the Western "occupation
 regime" in West Berlin needs to
 be altered in any significant
 way in view of developments
 since the Geneva foreign minis-
 ters'  conference.   He repeated
 his now-standard warning  that
 if Soviet efforts to  conclude
 a  treaty  with both  German
 states  "fail to be crowned
 with success after all," the
 USSR will sign a separate trea-
 ty with East Germany "with all
 the consequences proceeding from
 this."  However, he strongly im-
 plied that he foresees an in-
 definite period of high-level
 negotiations before the day of
 decision for unilateral action
 arrives.
 The mounting discontent
 with De Gaulle's leadership,
 evident in his dispute with
 Finance Minister Pinay and in
 army restiveness over Algeria,
 spells increasing difficulties
 for the French President's poli-
 oies and perhaps even for   the
 continued operation of the par-
 liamentary institutions as orig-
 inally established by him.     De
 Gaulle's central problem is to
 keep the Algerian issue  from
 broadening rightist and  army
 opposition.   The Algerian reb-
 els continue to keep open the
 possibility of cease-fire nego-
 tiations, but they probably
 view the growing opposition to
 De Gaulle as confirmation that
 De Gaulle's personal assurance
 of eventual self-determination
 is insufficient grounds for  a
 cease-fire.
 Pinay's ouster highlighted
 economic policy differences and
 emphasized  the  parliament's
 long-brewing   irritation over
 its   reduced role  and over De
 Gaulle's "royal"   method  of
 running the government.   It
 also reflected a general un-
 happiness with De Gaulle's at-
 titude toward the Western  al-
 liance and European integra-
 tion.   There are strong indi-
 cations that the rightist In-
 dependent party intends to go
 into open opposition to the
 government, and party leaders
 may try to force a special
 parliamentary session before
 the regularly scheduled 26
 April session to discuss "eco-
 nomic policy and possibly Algeria."
 De Gaulle has already hinted
 that an impasse with parliament
 would spur him to "go to   the
 country" for a   referendum  on
 further constitutional changes.
 Article  16 of the constitution
 invests him with virtually dic-
 tatorial powers in time of "na-
 tional crisis," but suspicion
 is mounting that he wants a
 more outright presidential sys-
 tem of government.   No improve-
 ment in the relationship between
 the government and the political
 parties seems likely in the near
 future.
 The recent manifestations
 of army discontent over Algerian
 policy,   climaxed  by  General
 Massu's published criticism  of
 De Gaulle,   seem  to  have been
 timed to take advantage of  the

 political setback given De
 Gaulle by Pinay's departure.
 A serious threat to the regime
 would result from close coopera-
 tion between these two currents
 of opposition.
 The seriousness of the mil-
 itary opposition depends on the
 extent to which De Gaulle can
 continue to convince the bulk
 of the army that he will neither
 abandon it nor Algeria and that
 the French public is behind him.
 Despite the army's apparent ac-
 ceptance of his assurances last
 fall,  there have been indications
 of smoldering anxiety which has
 recently been fanned by fears
 that the special session of civil
 and military leaders on Algerian
 policy he has called for 22 Jan-
 uary presages further conces-
 sions to the rebels.   Recent
 signs of De Gaulle's willingness
 to bolster NATO may be a gesture
 to allay the alarm of pro-NATO
 top military leaders in order
 to retain their support on his
 Algerian program.
 His public reaffirmation on
 20 January of his Algerian pol-
 icy thus challenges the loyalty
 of the army, which brought him
 to power. He wants to maintain
 army unity,  however,  and to
 shore up its prestige. He may
 therefore couple a new plea to
 the rebels to cease hostilities
 with a call to the army to in-
 tensify its pacification drive.
 Although right-wing settlers
 in Algeria have been vocal in
 denouncing De Gaulle's self-de-
 termination program,  their opposi-
 tion has suffered from the ab-
 sence of active army support.
 Since mid-December, however, 26
 Europeans have been killed in a
 sharp rise in terrorism in Al-
 giers Department. Initial settler
 criticism of alleged army laxity
 in local security has led to new
 attacks on De Gaulle's Algerian
 policy.  Rumors that the President
 plans to offer new "concessions"
 to the rebels on 22 January has
 prompted a declaration by the
 mayors of the Algerian Department
 that Algerians are determined
 to remain French "by taking up
 arms if necessary." One settler
 leader says 15,000 rightist mil-
 itants are ready to take up arms
 against De Gaulle at any time.
 The new unrest has been in-
 tensified by speculation con-
 cerning a special meeting of
 the Algerian Revolutionary Coun-
 cil in Tripoli. On 19 January,
 however,  the meeting ended amid
 indications that it had been de-
 voted more to streamlining the
 cumbersome rebel governmental
 machinery than to new moves in
 connection with De Gaulle's self-
 determination proposals. A rebel
 communique announced a shake-up
 of ministerial posts,  together
 with the formation of a three-
 man "war cabinet" to prosecute
 the war.  In contrast to settler
 fears that the rebels might make
 new moves toward a cease-fire,
 the rebel communique limited
 itself to keeping open   the
 possibility of cease-fire nego-
 tiations.
 Iraq
 Prime Minister Qasim's de-
 lay in granting licenses to
 groups which have applied for
 legal recognition under the po-
 litical parties law of 6 January
 is increasing the rivalry be-
 tween contending factions. The
 dissenting Communist splinter
 group,  led by Daud Sayyigh,
 which applied for recognition
 appears to have suffered a set-
 back  by  the  withdrawal of
 six founding members.

 Although the Communists
 remain the best organized party
 in Iraq, they appear unsure of
 Qasim's attitude toward them,
 fearing that his policy is to
 keep an equilibrium between
 opposing political factions in
 the country.   Qasim's reported
 declaration to Sayyigh on 15
 January that there must be only
 one Communist party in Iraq has
 resulted in an intensified ef-
 fort by the "orthodox" Communist
 press to discredit factionalism.
 The declaration by pro-
 Communist People's Court Presi-
 dent Colonel Mahdawi that he
 will form a"People's party"
 with the blessing of Qasim hqs
 introduced a new element into
 the political scene.   This par-
 ty could become a Communist
 front intended to unite leftist
 but non-Communist elements.
 Mahdawi intends to form his par-
 ty after the termination of the
 current trials of Baathists im-
 plicated in the assassination
 attempt on Qasim about the end
 of January.
 Jordan-UAR
 Jordan's relations with
 the UAR, formally re-established
 last July, have again deterio-
 rated.   One issue which has as-
 sumed "crisis" proportions with-
 in the past week involves the
 status of the UAR Consulate
 General in Jerusalem, which was
 opened on 6 January.   The UAR's
 request for an exequatur, how-
 ever, apparently referred to
 the consulate general's intended
 jurisdiction merely as terri-
 tory "occupied by the Jordanian
 Army. "  This infuriated Jor-
 danian Prime Minister Majali,
 since the area concerned was
 annexed and formally absorbed
 by Jordan in 1950 following the
 Arab-Israeli war.   The consulate
 general now is closed.
 On 19 January,  Jordan
 announced that a "battle plan"
 for settling the Palestine
 problem would be presented to
 the forthcoming meeting of Arab
 League foreign ministers.
 Majali has been irritated
 also by Nasir's pronouncements
 on Israeli plans for diverting
 Jordan River waters, another
 issue which affects Jordan more
 than other Arab states.
 Earlier this month,  Majali
 said the UAR had failed 25X1
 to live up to the agreement made
 when diplomatic relations were
 resumed last July:   he said the
 UAR had put exiled former Chief
 of Staff Nuwar, whose leadership
 of an abortive coup against
 King Husayn led to severed re-
 lations in 1957, on Cairo radio
 recently and Nuwar had asserted
 that Jordan was doing nothing
 on the Jordan waters question;
 Syrian MIGs fired on Jordanian
 aircraft over Jordanian terri-
 tory on 12 December; and Nasir,
 in a recent speech, had labeled
 the short-lived Arab Union of
 Jordan and pre-revolutionary
 Iraq an "imperialist maneuver."

 Although the UAR promptly
 apologized for the air incident,
 claiming the Syrians thought
 they were chasing Israeli planes,
 Jordan has decided to arm all
 of its jets during their flights
 and to adopt a more aggressive
 defensive attitude toward any
 future   intrusions.   In view of
 the other differences between
 the two countries,  the decision
 could lead to air clashes along
 the Syrian-Jordanian border as
 well as along the Jordanian-
 Israeli frontier.                       In general,
 however, Jordanian official
 sensitivity to these UAR pin
 pricks reflects the continuing
 basically uneasy situation of
 a Jordanian monarchy nearly
 surrounded by politically and
 socially revolutionary states.
 Israel
 The Israeli Government has
 decided it must step up its pur-
 chases of modern arms and mili-
 tary equipment during 1960 in
 order to "maintain the balance
 of power in the Middle East in
 view of the continuous arms
 flow to Arab countries."   An
 Israeli Foreign Ministry source
 refused to say what types of
 weapons would be sought or
 which sources the Israelis con-
 sider most promising,  but he
 indicated Israel would renew
 its requests for American arms.
 Foreign Minister Meir now is
 in Paris,  where she may be
 seeking new French military aid
 commitments.
 There has been an increase
 in the emigration of Rumanian
 Jews to Israel during recent
 weeks, apparently involving
 mostly  elderly   persons
 and "family reunion cases."
 While the Jewish Agency,  the
 Israeli immigration authority,
 does not presently feel the
 migration will be as large
 as that of late 1958 and
 early 1959,  it is hoping to
 avoid any publicity concern-
 ing the new movement,  fearing
 Arab protests might again
 jeopardize the exodus as they
 did a year ago.
 Libya
 Results of the 17 January
 elections to the Libyan House
 of Deputies point up the in-
 creasing popular dissatisfaction
 in Tripolitania Province over
 the policies of--and the wide-
 spread corruption within--the
 federal government.   Only 12
 of the 25 incumbents in the
 province who were running for
 re-election won,  and several
 who spent large sums campaign-
 ing were defeated by young po-
 litical unknowns.   The govern-
 ment may no longer be able to
 count on support of a majority
 of Tripolitania's 35 deputies,
 even though the greater success
 of progovernment candidates
 in Cyrenaica and the Fezzan
 should provide the government
 with majority support in the
 House of Deputies as a whole.
 In spite of its limited
 and circumscribed powers,  the
 new House of Deputies is like-
 ly to become a sounding board
 for more and stronger criticism

 of governmental policy. Major
 changes in the Council of Min-
 isters are likely.
 The Lebanese  parliament
 was enlarged last week   from
 66 to 99 seats as a prelude to
 parliamentary elections which
 probably will be held this year.
 While President Shihab admits
 that a 99-seat parliament  is
 absurd for a country the size
 of Lebanon, he feels that the
 move will tend to avert "dan-
 gerous" competition                       between
 various local leaders for seats.
 Shihab also believes that
 elections this year would ease
 political pressures remaining
 in the country as an aftermath
 of the Lebanese civil  strife
 of 1958.   However,  his inten-
 tion to make a radical change
 in the Lebanese voting system
 by introducing the secret bal-
 lot, as well as carrying out a
 reapportionment   of   election
 districts, is sure  to arouse
 violent objections from Lebanese
 political bosses.
 Foreign Minister Uwayni,
 who has made himself the mouth-
 piece of the Arab League   on
 the question of diverting Jor-
 dan waters,   announced  on  15
 January that Lebanon will divert
 the Hasbani River as part of
 the league's scheme to harass
 Israeli plans to irrigate the
 Negev desert.   The Karami re-
 gime will request a parliamen-
 tary appropriation of $3,165,-
 000 to carry out the project.
 Israeli reaction will probably
 be cautious, at least for the
 time being.
 The Castro regime has re-
 acted angrily to the US note
 of   11 January protesting the
 illegality of the seizure   of
 American-owned properties in
 Cuba by the agrarian  reform
 institute  (INRA).   Castro him-
 self publicly attacked Ambas-
 sador Bonsal and called                    the
 note "threatening."  The sei-
 zure of lands has been stepped
 up, and the government is ap-
 parently drafting  a drastic
 urban reform law. The Cuban
 press is under mounting pres-
 sure to conform to the govern-
 ment line, and on 18 January
 one of Havana's leading inde-
 pendent newspapers was   taken
 over by its employees when its
 management abandoned efforts
 to resist government-supported
 efforts by   the  workers   to
 "clarify" anti-Castro stories
 in the paper.
 After eight months of ex-
 tralegal takeovers of private
 lands, a Castro government of-
 ficial announced on 17 January
 that the  INRA will start   hun-
 dreds of court actions to                                                                 ex-
 propriate  Cuban as  well  as
 foreign-owned properties.    The
 institute is  already seizing
 significant acreages of sugar
 land, with this year's sugar
 harvest barely under way.    Its
 executive director, suspected
 Communist Antonio Nunez Jimenez,

 In his address to the Su-
 preme Soviet on 14 January,
 Khrushchev exuded confidence
 that he can afford to stand
 firm on his present position
 at the nuclear test cessation
 talks in Geneva.   He gave noti-
 fication that such moves as
 the recent US announcement re-
 serving the right to resume
 testing,  "designed to bring
 pressure on the USSR," will be
 of no avail.   While conceding
 that existing technical equip-
 ment "cannot provide absolute
 certainty" that underground
 nuclear explosions can be de-
 tected, he contended that vio-
 lators "would cover themselves
 with shame, and they would be
 condemned by the peoples of
 the world."
 Khrushchev appears to be
 playing for time on the assump-
 tion that the USSR, capitaliz-
 ing in part on the British dis-
 position for compromise, can
 extract further concessions
 from the United States on the
 nuclear test cessation issue.
 The Soviet delegates at
 Geneva continue to avoid any
 further discussion of the dif-
 ficulties in detecting under-
 ground tests, arguing that once
 a "fixed" quota of annual on-
 site inspections is agreed on,
 the reasons for the clash be-
 tween American and Soviet ex-
 perts on this question will
 disappear.   The Soviet delega-
 tion is attempting to encour-
 age the British to promote a
 compromise between the Ameri-
 can and Soviet positions on
 the deadlocked technical issue.
 Soviet delegate Tsarapkin
 asserted that British remarks'
 on 15 January could "possibly"
 provide the way for resolving
 the technical impasse.   The
 British delegate had asked
 whether the Soviet Union could
 agree to "temporary" control
 measures while the control sys-
 tem is being installed,                                                                  if the
 West were to accept the on-site
 inspections quota proposal.   The
 Soviet delegate said the Brit-
 ish questions deserved "careful
 attention" and that he would
 reply shortly.
 Moscow may calculate that
 British willingness to discuss
 any compromise which would as-
 sume settlement of the quota
 issue  prior to final determina-
 tion of the criteria to be used
 to send out inspection teams
 presents an opportunity for ma-
 jor inroads on the formal West-
 ern position that a technically
 reliable control system must
 be agreed on before agreement
 on a comprehensive test ban.
 Moscow probably also as-
 sumes that the British line of
 questioning implies agreement
 to a moratorium on underground
 tests during the time the perma-
 ent control system is being set
 up.  The Soviet delegate indi-
 cated privately last November
 that in event of disagreement
 in the technical talks,  the
 USSR might consider a phased
 treaty, but stressed that the
 "crux of the matter" must be an
 obligation to halt all tests at
 the outset, regardless of the
 temporary nature of a ban on
 underground tests.   Moscow may

 KHRUSHCHEV'S LATEST STATEMENT ON SOVIET MISSILE CAPABILITIES
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev's
 most recent statement on Soviet
 missile capabilities, made on
 14 January at the opening of
 the USSR Supreme Soviet, is the
 most comprehensive official ex-
 pression to date of the coming
 dominance of missile armaments
 in the Soviet military estab-
 lishment.  The speech gives his
 view that these new weapons are
 replacing more conventional
 ones.
 Khrushchev said, "We al-
 ready have so many nuclear
 weapons, both atomic and hydro-
 gen, and the necessary rockets
 for delivering these weapons...
 that...we would be able literal-
 ly to wipe the country or coun-
 tries which attack us off the
 face of the earth."  At the
 Hungarian party congress in
 Budapest on 31 November, Khru-
 shchev said the Soviet Union
 had a stockpile of rockets with
 nuclear warheads sufficient
 "to raze to the ground all our
 potential enemies:'
 Both these statements are
 general and give no indication
 of the quantities that might be
 involved.  There is a great
 difference between the smaller
 stockpile of missiles required
 to destroy the major cities of
 the West and the greater quan-
 tity necessary to attack effec-
 tively and destroy Western re-
 taliatory forces.
 One of the few statements
 permitting a rough numerical
 estimate of Soviet intentions
 shifting from conventional arma-
 ments to long-range missiles
 had been estimated by his mili-
 tary advisers to be 30 billion
 rubles.   It is probable that
 expenditure of the 30 billion
 rubles, if indeed this were an
 approved program, would be made
 over a period of some five or
 six years, or to the end of the

 Such an expenditure might en-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 Over the past year Khru-
 shchev has made a series of
 statements designed to create
 in Western eyes the impression
 of a rapid growth of Soviet
 military might in the missile
 field.   In November 1958 he
 claimed in his "Theses on the
 Seven-Year Plan" that the "pro-
 duction of intercontinental
 ballistic missiles has   been
 set up successfully."   This im-
 plied that initial tooling of
 ICBM production facilities had
 recently been completed,  that
 the technology of production
 was considered mastered and
 probably had been demonstrated,
 and that initial delivery of
 stockpile ICBMs was about to
 begin.
 If it was an accurate rep-
 resentation of the status of
 the program at that time,  this
 statement would have indicated
 a capability to begin deliver-
 ies of such missiles early in
 1959, a development implied by
 Khrushchev's second major re-
 mark on ICBM production, made
 at the 21st party congress in
 January 1959.   He then stated
 that serial production of inter-
 continental ballistic rockets
 had been organized.
 According to a 1957 So-
 viet text on aircraft produc-
 tion,  there are three stages
 involved in putting a new item
 into serial production:   prep-
 aration for production; mastery
 of the processes of manufactur-
 ing by the production line;
 and serial production and mas-
 tery of modifications.   Khru-
 shchev's claim in November 1958
 would imply that the second
 stage had been achieved,  and
 the statement in January 1959
 would suggest that all prep-
 arations for the third stage
 had been completed.
 Even if serial production
 were successfully organized at
 the beginning of 1959,  as Khru-
 shchev wished to imply,  initial
 rates of production would be
 low and production would in-
 crease gradually during the year.
 The USSR,  therefore, could not
 yet have been able to achieve
 production and deployment of
 large numbers of ICBMs.
 However,  a small stockpile
 of perhaps ten ICBMs--that is,
 enough to attack several key US
 urban areas--is believed to
 exist.   Moreover, Khrushchev's
 recent statement,  implying a
 large current missile capabil-
 ity, cannot be wholly discred=
 ited,  in that the USSR probably
 has had sufficient time to
 possess significant numbers of
 700-nautical-mile missiles and
 some 1,100-nautical-mile mis-
 siles capable of reaching tar-
 gets in Western Europe and other
 peripheral areas.
 On 14 November 1959, in a
 speech to Soviet journalists
 which cannot logically be re-
 lated to his previous ICBM state-
 ment,  Khrushchev said,  "In one
 year, 250 missiles with hydrogen
 warheads came off the assembly
 line in the factory we visited."
 Available evidence suggests a-
 gain that, among the longer
 range missiles, only the 700-
 nautical-mile weapon has been
 in production long enough to
 permit achievement of such a
 production rate. Khrushchev's
 statement also could be true if   25X1
 it referred to the combined pro-
 duction of several missile types

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 The firing of party presid-
 ium                    member   Nikolay Belyayev on
 19 January from his post as par-
 ty chief in Kazakhstan is the
 latest of a number of recent
 signs of stresses and strains
 in the party presidium which
 probably indicate that a signif-
 icant  reshuffling of Khrushchev's
 top command is under way.
 Others in addition to Bel-
 yayev have suffered a sharp loss
 in standing, with the result that
 the number of top leaders around
 Khrushchev has become smaller
 than at any time since he con-
 solidated his power.   There now
 are several presidium members
 who are probably members   in
 name only.   While   this situa-
 tion could remain until the next
 party congress,  scheduled to
 be held in 1961,  Khrushchev may
 soon find it desirable to adjust
 the composition of the presidium
 to correspond with the actual
 political situation.
 Belyayev's removal from his
 Kazakh post appears to be a
 direct   consequence   of   the
 scathing criticism of agriculture
 in Kazakhstan which Khrushchev
 made at the party central com-
 SECRET
 Page 4 of 20
 mittee meeting in December.  Khru-
 shchev accused Belyayev of poor
 leadership in organizing the har-
 vest and of "lacking the courage"
 to admit his errors.   There is
 some evidence, however, that fac-
 tional infighting may have been
 involved.
 Nikolay Rodionov,  former
 party chief in Leningrad and a
 protege of presidium member and
 First Deputy Premier Frol Kozlov,
 was named second secretary in the
 Kazakh party shuffle,  suggest-
 ing that Kozlov had a hand                                                        in
 Belyayev's downfall,   Dinmuk-
 hamed Kunayev,  Kazakh premier,
 replaced Belyayev as party first
 secretary.   The Soviet announce-
 ment made no mention of a new
 post for Belyayev, probably in-
 dicating that he is not to be
 given an important job.
 Presidium member Aleksey
 Kirichenko, demoted last week,
 was given the job of party
 chief in Rostov Oblast, but he
 has clearly lost the influence
 with Khrushchev which had made
 him the second-in-command in
 the professional party machine.

 of the party secretariat  but

 is obviously precluded from
 its activities by the Rostov
 assignment.   At the Supreme
 Soviet session last week Kiri-
 chenko filed in  with  the
 presidium members   but   sat
 apart.   Throughout the session,
 he appeared glum and dejected.
 The demotion of Belyayev
 and Kirichenko obviously up-
 sets the balance of forces on
 the presidium, but Kirichenko's
 will probably have the more
 serious repercussions.  Belyayev's
 seat at the presidium table
 could be left vacant, but whether
 or not Khrushchev revamps the
 presidium completely,'the gap
 Kirichenko leaves will have to
 be filled,  in view of the im-
 portant role he played in su-
 pervising party operations for
 Khrushchev, and it is doubtful
 that any arrangement can be
 found which will be satisfac-
 tory to all members of the
 presidium.   A new period of
 maneuvering, among Khrushchev's
 lieutenants, therefore,  is like-
 ly to ensue.
 Events of the past few
 weeks have not reflected ad-
 versely on other members of
 the presidium,  but Nikolay
 Shvernik, 72, who is frequently
 sick, and Otto Kuusinen, 78,
 have apparently had little real
 influence for some time.   Can-
 didate member Yan Kalnberzin's
 transfer in November 1959 from
 Latvian party  chief  to   the
 ceremonial post of chairman
 of the Presidium of the Latvian
 Supreme Soviet indicated his
 loss of stature.
 On the other hand,  Presidium
 member Averky Aristov, who is
 also a member of the secretariat
 and Khrushchev's deputy on the
 bureau for the RSFSR,  has become
 increasingly prominent.   For ex-
 ample, he was present at the Rostov
 party meeting which installed
 Kirichenko as first secretary.
 Although undoubtedly performing
 this and similar tasks as a rep-
 resentative of the presidium, to
 the party faithful he must in-
 creasingly appear as one of the
 inner circle.
 When Khrushchev does get a-
 round to revamping the presidium,
 the two candidate members who
 appear most likely to be promoted
 to full members are Deputy Pre-
 mier and Gosplan Chief Aleksey
 Kosygin and RSFSR Premier Dmitry
 Polyansky, both of whom are key   25X1
 figures in the economic drive
 for Khrushchev's Seven-Year
 Plan.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 POLISH ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 1960
 The moderate increase in
 industrial output planned for
 1960 offers little prospect of
 gain for the Polish consumer.
 Output is to rise 7.6 percent
 over last year,  a slight de-
 cline from the 1959 rate.   A
 large share of the increase in
 national income this year is
 to be directed toward a reduc-
 tion of the trade deficit.
 This deficit increased
 almost 60 percent in 1959.  to
 $265,000,000.   Fodder imports
 had to be increased to prevent
 a further decline in hog pro-
 duction--pork comprises about
 80 percent of Polish
 meat consumption--
 and emergency imports
 of meat were neces-
 sary.   Another ma-
 jor cause of the
 trade imbalance was
 the continued depres-
 sion of hard-currency
 prices for coal, Po-
 land's largest export
 item.
 In 1960, there-
 fore, a smaller share
 than last year of
 the increase in na-
 tional income is to
 be allocated for con-
 sumption and invest-
 ment.   The increases

 the regime.
 Such reforms have been
 made in recent years in other
 satellites without major out-
 breaks,  but with much opposi-

 in Poland will be determined
 to some extent by the way they
 are put into effect.   Official
 statements claim that the pro-

 that the present level of aver-

 The outlook for Polish
 agriculture is unpromising.
 Because of the drought,       less
 acreage was sown in winter
 grain.   Furthermore, the snow
 cover for winter crops has
 been inadequate to date, caus-
 ing speculation that 1960 pro-
 duction of bread grain--con-
 stituting the bulk of Poland's
 grain output--will be consid-
 erably smaller than the pre-
 ceding year.   To help tide
 them over until the coming
 harvest and perhaps provide
 some backlog for next year,
 Polish officials have asked
 the United States for another
 600,000 tons of wheat--in
 addition to the 200,000 tons
 of grain sold to Poland in
 November.
 Developments in the econ-
 omy point to a year  of in-
 creased tension between the re-
 gime and the people.   The peas-
 ant--already  subject to new
 disciplines such as linking
 his coal supply to produce de-
 liveries to the state--will
 probably be further alienated
 by attempts to collect arrears
 in taxes, by strong propaganda
 urging him to join agricultural
 "circles"--cooperative associa-
 tions--and by related fears of
 a resumption of the program to
 collectivize private farmland.
 Only 13 percent of Poland's
 agricultural land now is under
 state control.
 Shortages of meat, butter,
 and milk--but no actual hunger--
 and a failure to make tangible
 improvements in other aspects
 of his living standard will de-
 press the urban worker,  as
 will the labor speed-up.   He
 will probably also be embittered
 by insecurit  .over possible
 layoffs .                  (Pre-   25X1

 A reorganization of North
 Vietnam's security forces--
 with the possible transfer of
 former regular army border se-
 curity battalions to a new
 Armed Public Security Force--
 has become apparent from pub-
 lic statements in the North
 Vietnamese press.   The new
 organization will probably be
 similar to Peiping's military
 public security apparatus.
 An article in Nhan Dan on
 13 September described-ti  new
 security arm as "an armed force

 organ of the security branch."
 According to the paper, the
 new organization is in charge
 of guarding the borders,  the
 coastline, the economic.and
 cultural institutions of the
 country, the "peaceful labor
 of the people, and the peace
 and security of all."
 An article on 12 December
 in People's Army elaborates
 somewhat by stating that the
 Armed Public Security Force
 "will fight side by side with
 the People's Army to check im-
 perialist aggression from out-
 side."   Internal security and
 counterespionage functions are
 implied by the statement that
 this will "also curb the activi-

 An article in

 for officers paral-
 leling those of the
 regular army.   The
 organization appears
 to be directly under
 the control of the
 Ministry of Defense
 general headquarterg
 although it may be
 nominally under the
 Ministry of Public
 Security.   In any
 case,  its mission is
 distinct from that
 of the regular army
 and the police mis-
 sions of the Ministry
 of Public Security.
 The reorganization
 probably began dur-
 ing the summer of
 1959.
 Chinese agriculture in
 1959 was afflicted with a wide
 range of unfavorable weather.
 According to preliminkry West-
 ern estimates, total grain pro-
 duction probably did not exceed
 200,000,000 tons, as against
 185,000,000 tons in 1957 and
 some 210,000,000 to 215;000,000
 tons in 1958.   Cotton produc-
 tion was possibly in the range
 of 1,500,000 to 1,750,000 tons,
 as compared with 1,640,000 tons
 in 1957 and 2, 100, 000 tons in 1958.
 Spokesmen, for the Peiping
 regime take a considerably more
 optimistic view.   They argue
 that the superiority of the
 communes and the inspiration
 provided by the campaign a-
 gainst rightists enabled the
 farmers to overcome the worst
 weather in decades and to in-
 crease output.   They assert
 that grain production reached

 250, 000, 000 tons claimed for 1968
 and that cotton output jumped from

 Information from independ-
 ent  sources confirms Peiping's
 assertion that "natural calam-
 ities" were widespread.  The
 extended drought which centered
 in the important farm belt of
 central and north-central China
 covered approximately one third
 of the total cultivated acreage
 and lasted for over 100 days in
 some areas.   Extreme heat, with
 high rates of evaporation,
 aggravated the dry spell.
 Irrigation installations,
 many of them constructed during
 the "leap forward" labor drives,
 presumably lessened the damage,
 but many irrigation canals and
 storage ponds apparently ran
 dry.  Most of the available
 water probably was given to
 rice and cotton crops at the
 expense of coarse grains and
 sweet potatoes.
 SECRET
 PART II                    NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Peiping's ac-
 tions do not bear
 out its claims of
 an increase over the
 1958 crop, which it
 called the finest
 harvest in China's
 history.   It contin-
 ues a relentless
 campaign, stepped up
 last August,  for
 austerity in food
 consumption,     explaining that it
 is necessary in bumper years to
 save for possible lean years.
 The regime insisted on great
 care in reaping the harvest,
 pointing approvingly to communes
 where fields were combed four
 or five times to save every
 kernel.
 The use of substitutes for
 grain has been urged on the
 people.  The market has been
 flooded with Chinese cabbage,
 however, following a regime-
 sponsored campaign, and fears
 have been expressed that much
 of it may spoil before it is
 eaten or stored, as was the
 case with sweet potatoes a year
 ago.   Peiping has also tried to
 impose an over-all reduction in
 state sales of grain at a time
 when intensified state crop pro-
 curement has netted larger a-
 mounts than in the same period
 last year.
 It is likely that the total
 food available for consumption
 until the early harvest next
 June will be slightly less than
 a year ago.   However,  the re
 gime's strenuous efforts to

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 MOSCOW REINFORCES ECONOMIC TIES WITH CAIRO
 The Soviet Union, in order
 to strengthen its economic ties
 with the UAR,       has agreed to fi-
 nance the construction of the
 second stage of the Aswan Dam.
 This stage involves primarily
 construction of the permanent
 High Dam structure itself.
 Moscow, which has de-
 scribed Soviet aid to the UAR
 for the first stage of the dam
 as a first-round victory over
 the West in "the competition...
 for the right to design and
 build the Aswan Dam," appar-
 ently feels that the new com-
 mitment will greatly limit the
 prospect of Western participa-
 tion in the later hydroelectric
 and irrigation phases of the
 High Dam project.   The addi-
 tional aid,  granted despite
 intermittent frictions with
 Cairo, will also serve to bol-
 ster Moscow's claim that Soviet
 aid is granted on the principle
 of "nonintervention in internal
 affairs."
 In November 1958 the USSR
 extended a long-term,  low-in-
 terest $100,000,000 credit to
 the UAR to cover the foreign
 exchange costs incurred for the
 first phase of the Aswan High
 Dam.   Soviet engineers revised
 the original plans for the dam
 to conform more closely to So-
 viet construction methods.  The
 revisions will result in a sav-
 ing of time and money to the
 UAR.   The Soviet Union is com-
 mitted under this first agree-
 ment to build the coffer dams
 to the north and south of the
 site for the main dam and to
 dig the diversion channels on
 the east bank.
 Under the new agreement--
 which was formally reached
 through an exchange of letters
 between Khrushchev and Nasir--
 the USSR will assist in the con-
 struction of the project's sec-
 ond  phase on the same terms
 as for the first stage.   Moscow,

 this stage of the dam's con-

 foreign exchange than the
 first stage.   A study made in
 1955 by the International Bank
 for Reconstruction and Develop-

 days

 start
 of construction on  the
 first
 phase of the project.
 The
 ceremonies were attended by
 two high Soviet officials, and
 the Soviet press and radio
 gave the event extensive cov-
 erage.  Emphasizing the "self-
 lessness" of the USSR's aid,
 Soviet propaganda portrayed
 Soviet.UAR relations in a more
 friendly light than has been
 observed in recent months.

 could lead to cancellation  of
 the Cyprus agreements of  last
 February.   These agreements pro-
 vided for Cypriot independence
 but with two military base
 areas to be retained under full

 the base areas must include
 about 120 square miles under

 has insisted on restricting
 this area to about one third
 of that figure,   At the con-
 ference,  Lloyd offered a few
 concessions regarding agricul-
 tural lands near the bases and
 provision for resettlement of
 additional Cypriots now living
 within the area of the bases,
 A possible solution could
 limit the British sovereign

 existing military bases, Arrange-

 recognition on both sides of
 the need for agreement and the
 relatively cordial atmosphere
 whicl3 has thus far surrounded

 Makarios,  however, would
 lose considerable prestige and

 to reap political profit from
 any concessions he makes to the
 British.   In Athens,  General
 Grivas has publicly proclaimed
 his opposition to any conces-
 sions beyond 36 square miles,
 One possible advantage to
 Cyprus which appears to have
 developed from the present sit-
 uation is increased collabora-
 tion between Makarios and the
 Turkish Cypriot leaders.   Any
 further delay in proclaiming

 CU  ENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 INDIAN CONGRESS PARTY'S ANNUAL CONVENTION
 The 65th annual convention
 of India's ruling Congress party,
 a lackluster affair held in
 Bangalore from 12 to 17 January,
 reflected both the country's
 distraction over events on its
 frontier bordering Communist
 China and the party's waning
 ability to inspire either its
 members   or   the   public at
 large.
 The usual resolutions
 drafted by the Congress'  high
 command on international affairs
 and on economic matters con-
 tained only minor variations on
 themes which have become famil-
 iar in recent months.   After
 provoking desultory and quickly
 stifled criticism from a few of
 the delegates,  the resolutions
 were passed unanimously,
 Speeches lacked the spark evi-
 dent at last year's session, and
 the public turnout fell far
 short of normal.
 The resolution on inter-
 national affairs restated
 India's adherence to a policy
 of nonalignment with either
 of the two big-power blocs.
 Prime Minister Nehru insisted
 this policy had been proved
 right and remained the only
 course India should follow.   He
 rejected vehemently suggestions
 that the door be kept open for
 military assistance in the event
 of an emergency,
 A special resolution on
 the frontier question covered
 much of the same ground as have
 recent government statements,
 its impact being lessened by the
 fact that several months of pub-
 lic debate on the Sino-Indian
 dispute have all but exhausted
 the subject.
 The high command steered
 clear of any radical proposals
 in the economic sphere such as
 last year's controversial pro-
 gram for reorganizing the rural
 economy along cooperative lines,
 Although it reaffirmed the
 party's support for the coopera-
 tive system, its resolution tac-
 itly conceded the strength of
 the opposition and in effect
 retreated from the original
 program,   The 1960 resolution
 stressed primarily the need for
 overhauling the government ad-
 ministration to ensure faster
 implementation of five-year-
 plan programs.
 Perhaps the most signifi-
 cant event of the convention
 was the induction of Sanjiva
 Reddy,  46-year-old former chief
 minister of the southern state
 of Andhra Pradesh, who succeeds
 Indira Gandhi as president of
 the Congress party.   Reddy's
 two-year term will be crucial,
 for it will be his responsibil-
 ity to prepare the party organ-
 ization for the national elec-
 tions in 1962.   While his youth
 and apparent political acumen
 may bring new vigor to the high
 command,  his lack of national
 stature probably will limit his
 ability to enforce party disci-
 pline in the dominant northern
 states,

 CU.d'U NT II ';TL LLIG'SNC:E WEEKLY SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 Relations between Pakistan
 and  India have improved marked-
 ly since Pakistan's military
 government came to power,
 especially since the increase
 in Chinese Communist pressure
 on the Himalayan border area.
 President Ayub's government
 has encouraged negotiations on
 the whole range of problems with
 India.   New Delhi,  which con-
 sidered Pakistan's parliamen-
 tary regimes too unstable to
 fulfill any long-term commit-
 ments, has apparently decided
 that Ayub's offers of friend-
 ship present a useful opportuni-
 ty to liquidate long-standing
 and costly disputes,
 On 11 January, Rawalpindi--
 the new Pakistani capital--and
 New Delhi announced the resolu-
 tion of all but one of the bor-
 der delineation disputes involv-
 ing small areas of Indian and
 West Pakistani territory.   This
 agreement followed exchanges
 of disputed territory along the
 East Pakistani border.   These
 steps will probably result in
 a sharp reduction in border
 incidents.
 On 3 January negotiators
 from the two countries announced
 they had overcome the most dif-
 ficult obstacles to a final
 settlement of the financial
 disputes which arose out of the
 1947 partition of British India.
 In early December,  Rawalpindi
 and New Delhi announced a new
 payments agreement intended to
 increase mutual trade.   A fur-
 ther improvement in Indo-Paki-
 stani economic relations will
 probably follow these efforts.
 Both governments also hope
 to reach an agreement this
 spring on the division of waters
 in the Indus River basin,
 Under the auspices of the World
 Bank,  a treaty has been drafted
 providing for a $1 billion
 system of canals to replace
 waters which will be diverted
 by India from rivers now flow-
 ing from Indian-held territory
 into Pakistan.   New Delhi is to
 contribute about $168,000,000,
 most of the remainder being
 provided by Western sources,
 The Pakistani Government's
 appointment of A.  K.  Brohi,  an
 outstanding legal expert and a
 strong advocate of closer ties
 with India,  as high commissioner
 to India has also been received
 in New Delhi as evidence of
 Pakistan's desire for better
 relations.   Brohi's chief as-
 signment is likely to be to
 find a solution to the impasse
 on Kashmir.   The Ayub govern-
 ment apparently hopes that,  in
 view of the threat from Com-
 munist China, New Delhi will
 feel it can no longer allow
 the bulk of its army to be tied
 down defending Kashmir.   No
 direct effort has yet been made
 to initiate negotiations on this
 problem,  however,  and a quick
 solution is unlikely,
 The political tempo in
 Cambodia has picked up with the
 return of Premier Sihanouk on
 1 January from a two-month visit
 to the UAR,  Yugoslavia,  and
 India.   Sihanouk has launched
 into a full schedule of cabinet
 meetings and audiences with ad-
 visers,                                                                and he intends next
 month to tour the country to

 push basic economic programs.
 This activity will culminate in
 the semiannual national congress
 of Sihanouk's Sangkum movement
 in Phnom Penh from 20 to 23
 February.   These open-forum
 reviews of governmental pro-
 grams are frequently used by
 Sihanouk for major policy pro-
 nouncements.
 A major determinant in
 Sihanouk?s political outlook
 continues to be resentment and
 fear of the attitude of South
 Vietnam and Thailand toward
 Cambodia.   Basic   antagonisms
 appear undiminshed despite out-
 ward signs of some improvement
 in relations;  trade and payments
 agreements between Cambodia and
 South Vietnam were restored last
 December,  and the press war be-
 tween Cambodia and its two
 neighbors has eased,
 During his recent trip a-
 broad,  Sihanouk referred fre-
 quently to the "aggressive" in-
 tentions of South Vietnam and
 Thailand and warned that Cam-
 bodia would not hesitate to
 "go Communist" if it came to a
 question of national survival
 against pressures from its
 neighbors.   Such statements tend
 in turn to confirm the fears in
 Saigon and Bangkok that Cambodia
 is headed toward Communism under
 Sihanouk's leadership.
 Among Sihanouk's earliest
 moves on returning to Phnom
 Penh were to give a dinner in
 honor of Chinese Communist tech-
 nicians who recently installed
 a radio transmitter,  a gift from
 Peiping,  and to visit a plywood
 factory being built under the
 Chinese Communist aid program.
 Sihanouk apparently thereby
 intended to correct any im-
 pression that his recent visits
 to the UAR,  Yugoslavia,  and
 India imply a change in Cam-
 bodia's friendly attitude to-
 ward Peiping,  or in his deter-
 mination to keep strictly to
 "independent" neutrality.   At
 the same time,  the Sihanouk
 government is adhering to the
 tougher line adopted last sum-
 mer toward Communist subversion.

 While some criticism of the
 premier and his policies exists
 among various urban groups in
 Cambodia,  in addition to the
 open enmity of the small dissi-
 dent movement headed by expatri-
 ates Sam Sary and Son Ngoc
 Thanh,  present opposition to
 Sihanouk is no threat to his en-
 The new Japanese Democratic
 Socialist party  (DSP),  organized
 by former right-wing members of
 the Japanese Socialist party
 (JSP),  will be inaugurated on
 24 January,   The new party,  with
 at least 52 seats in the Diet,
 while essentially Socialist, has
 won strong press endorsement for
 its moderate program and has
 attracted a greater membership
 and support than its leaders
 had initially anticipated.
 Many observers believe the new
 party will halt the trend to-
 ward polarization in Japanese
 politics,  but its ultimate
 fortunes will depend on how
 much support it attracts out-
 side the moderate labor unions.
 Suehiro Nishio, who led
 the withdrawal from the JSP be-
 cause of his opposition to its
 Marxist orientation and domina-
 tion by the extreme leftist
 Sohyo labor federation,  is ex-
 pected to be named chairman of
 the new party.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 The DSP's draft program
 recognizes the need for Japa-
 nese military forces and for
 the security treaty with the
 United States but recommends
 that the United Nations estab-
 lish an international police
 force,  thus eventually making
 the treaty unnecessary.   The
 party would support   the   ad-
 mission of Communist China to
 the UN, but desires a peaceful
 settlement of the Taiwan issue
 and  an   independent Japanese
 foreign policy which is neither
 pro- nor anti-American.  Its
 economic proposals call for a
 gradual socialization of the
 national economy.
 Thus far, one fifth of
 the JSP members in the Diet
 have joined the new party and
 a few more are expected to do
 so.   The DSP has established
 chapters in 35 of Japan's 46 prefec-
 tures and has the support of the
 800,000-member Zenro labor federation.
 Zenro, however, has criticized
 the new security treaty and is
 calling on the government to
 dissolve the Diet and to hold
 national elections prior to
 seeking Diet ratification.
 Although additional labor
 support for the DSP can be ex-
 pected from Sohyo unions which
 are     wearying  of   "political
 struggles" which have failed
 to attain the wa a increases and
 other improvements won by some
 Zenro unions by  nonpolitical
 means, the new party will have
 difficulty expanding.   Chances
 of gaining the support of the
 "liberal conservative wing"
 are believed slight, but the
 DSP's formation may give con-
 servatives opposed to Prime
 Minister Kishi's leadership of
 the ruling Liberal-Democratic
 party wider latitude for fac-
 tional maneuvering.
 Informed observers believe
 that not many small-businessmen,
 white-collar workers, and older
 farmers will change party alle-
 giance and that,  therefore,  the
 DSP must attract intellectuals,
 students, and young farmers if
 it   is to become an effective
 political organization. -

 however,  are threatened by con-
 flicting interests and national
 rivalries.
 The Montevideo conference,
 which began on 12 January with
 discussion of a payments sys-
 tem for a proposed South Ameri-
 can free-trade area, was
 marked by a clash between rep-
 resentatives of the Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund (I.v1F)  and
 Raul Prebisch,  spokesman for
 the United Nations Economic
 Commission for Latin America,
 who favors development programs
 at the expense of
 standard financial
 principles.   Prebisch
 recommends that pro-
 spective members--Ar-
 gentina,  Brazil,  Bo-
 livia,  Chile,  Para-
 guay,  Peru,  and Uru-
 guay--be pressed to
 buy as much as they
 sell within the pro-
 posed area, while IMF
 representatives be-
 lieve that payments
 in the free-trade
 zone should be freely
 convertible in order
 to preserve the bene-
 fit of relatively free
 trade with countries
 such as the United
 States.
 The conference
 plans to recommend to
 a foreign ministers'
 conference in Monte-
 video next month a
 payments system to be
 adopted in a formal
 treaty designating
 the free-trade area.
 Less ambitious and
 binding than the Euro-
 pean Common Aarket,the

 or exchange hindrances

 authorized their ministers of
 economy on 9 January to draft
 and sign a treaty within 30
 days "to establish the means to
 achieve a greater integration
 of their (countries') economies."
 The new treaty will probably be
 open to later adherence by
 Nicaragua and Costa Rica and
 presumably will establish a
 shorter timetable than the ten
 years allowed in the 1958 treaty
 for the establishment of a Cen-
 tral American customs union.

 DISSENSION IN BOLIVIA'S GOVERNMENT PARTY
 Dissension within the gov-
 erning Nationalist Revolutionary
 Movement  (MNR)  in Bolivia may
 lead to outbreaks of violence
 and possibly to a split in the
 party prior to the MNR presi-
 dential nominating convention
 scheduled for 15-21 February.
 Foreign Minister Walter Guevara,
 the candidate sponsored by the
 right wing,  now appears to be-
 lieve former President Paz
 Estenssoro will easily win the
 MNR nomination,  but Guevara's
 supporters bitterly oppose Paz.
 Many of Paz' supporters advo-
 cate an exchange of diplomatic
 missions with the USSR,  and Paz
 may be more responsive to such
 pressures than incumbent Presi-
 dent Siles.
 The question of Bolivia's
 relations with the USSR has been
 reopened in the course of the
 political struggle.   The two
 countries did not exchange rep-
 resentatives   a:'ter relations
 were established in 1945,  but
 Bolivia's Foreign Ministry al-
 locations for 1960,  reflecting
 strong public and congressional
 interest,  provide funds for a
 Moscow mission.   Both President
 Siles and Guevara apparently
 oppose an exchange of missions.
 This provision in the budget
 may be explained as a move by
 Guevara to draw away leftist
 support from Paz.   Paz has not
 expressed himself on the exchange
 of missions,  but is supported
 by the left wing and seems to
 favor a more independent line
 in relations with the United
 States than incumbent President
 Siles.
 The Siles administration
 has achieved a marked improve-
 ment in respect for laws con-
 cerning persons and property
 since its inauguration in 1956.
 Virtually every leader in the
 government party,  however,  has
 some armed force at his command,
 since the party's civilian militia
 is organized on both geographic
 and trade union lines.   Siles
 sought to avoid a showdown between
 right- and left-wing militia
 by swinging his support from
 Guevara to Paz last October.
 The tensions of the campaign for
 the MNR presidential nomination
 have nevertheless caused a clash
 of opposing militia elements
 resulting in about 25 deaths,
 the assassination of a former
 cabinet minister,  and dispersal
 of a right-wing rural congress
 by left-wing threats of violence.
 A separate political party
 formed by Guevara's followers
 would probably derive some ad-
 ditional support from the right-
 ist Bolivian Socialist Falange
 (FSB).   The FSB polled 12 per-
 cent of the vote in 1958 national
 elections and since the 1952

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 Communist China's leading
 economic planners apparently
 are confident that a "new stage"
 has been reached in Chinese
 economic development and that
 the nation's industry,  after
 the rapid expansion of the past
 decade,  now can provide farmers
 with "greatly increased" amounts
 of machinery and chemicals and
 thus hasten the modernizaton
 of China's primitive agricul-
 ture.                     This concept that indus-
 try now is or shortly will be
 in a position to   increase
 sharply the   supplies of trac-
 tors,  farm implements, vehicles,
 chemical   fertilizers,   and in-
 secticides to the                          Chinese
 countryside was recently  de-
 scribed by planning chief Li
 Fu-chun as a "conspicuous new
 thing"  in Peiping's economic
 planning,
 The planners indicate that
 heavy industry still enjoys a
 "priority" role--thus no radical
 shift in economic priorities is
 contemplated--but they add that
 agriculture now must be regard-
 ed as the "foundation to impel
 the advance of the various
 branches of the national econ-
 omy,"   This formulation moves
 agriculture up another notch
 in importance.
 Peiping's farm moderniza-
 tion program is still vague
 and generalized,  and much de-
 tailed planning and careful
 preparation remain to be done
 before the program can be con-
 sidered launched.  Present indi-
 cations are,  however,  that the
 regime intends to speed up the
 process.   Where Mao Tse-tung
 had earlier said that China
 would be   doing well to com-
 plete the process by 1975, the
 planners now are holding out
 the prospect that the country-
 side will be well along the
 road to modernization in ten
 years.   While their expecta-
 tions that the program  will
 double farm output are very
 likely misplaced,  their con-
 viction that it will not ap-
 preciably slow the   advance
 of heavy industry may be bet-
 ter founded.
 Concept of Program
 Peiping's program is not
 designed to bring Chinese agri-
 culture near Western technolog-
 ical levels.   As described by
 regime spokesman Po I-po,  the
 general intent is to replace
 manual and animal power with
 mechanical and  electrical
 power and to supply agricul-
 ture with abundant quantities
 of chemical   fertilizer.   Spe-
 cifically, Po foresaw by 1969
 "or thereabouts" the mechanical
 cultivation   of   all land that
 is workable by machine,  ir-
 rigation by machine where nec-
 essary,  the use of motor ve-
 hicles for nearly all rural
 transport, mechanical process-
 ing of farm produce,  and pro-
 duction of seven to eight times
 as much chemical fertilizer as
 presently applied--about 2,-
 700,000 tons in 1958.
 Whereas the Western concept
 of mechanized agriculture is
 usually in terms of movable
 equipment,  the Chinese  Commu-
 nists classify as farm machinery
 both  movable  and  stationary

 equipment.     The former includes
 tractors and implements; the
 latter, irrigation machinery
 and processing equipment.   Be-
 cause of the mixture of the
 two types in Chinese plans,
 and because irrigation pumps
 constitute much less dramatic
 evidence of mechanization than
 do tractors, Chinese propagan-
 dists tend to slur over the
 distinction and issue progress
 reports in terms lumping the
 various types of machinery.
 Topography and cultiva-
 tion techniques sharply limit
 the amount of land where West-
 ern-type mechanization is feas-
 ible.   One Communist writer
 calculates that 140,000,000
 acres--slightly over half of
 China's total cultivated acre-
 age--are in areas where inten-
 sive tractor cultivation prob-
 ably will prove feasible.   This
 land is largely in northern
 China,  Sinkiang,  and Manchuria.
 On the other hand,  official
 statements make it clear that
 no practical means have yet been
 devised for mechanizing the
 paddy fields and hilly land of
 South China.   Mechanization
 there will be limited mainly
 to off-the-field tasks.  There
 are plans for supplying large
 quantities   of irrigation equip-
 ment ana processing plants,  and
 a main source of power will be
 small hydroelectric  plants to
 be built into irrigation sys-
 tems.   Motorized junks will re-
 lieve the peasant of some heavy
 rural transport burdens.
 Problems
 The limited program en-
 visaged by Peiping will not
 require a significant drop in
 the investment priority as-
 signed heavy industry. How-
 ever,                  the introduction of the
 necessary amounts of major in-
 dustrial commodities to agri-
 culture during the next decade
 will present some difficulties.
 The problem of chemical
 fertilizer will loom large,
 for China's capacity to pro-
 duce it is limited.   Peiping
 has announced plans to step up
 investment in fertilizer plants
 during the Second Five-Year Plan
 (1958-62), and a number of large
 plants are under construction.
 At the present rate of construc-
 tion, however, there seems little
 likelihood of reaching Po's tar-
 get of roughly 20,000,000 tons
 by 1969.   Imports will make up
 only part of the deficit.
 Another major item will be
 tractors.   Chinese Communist
 sources have stated at various
 times that 550,000 to 1,500,000
 tractor units are needed.   (A
 standard tractor unit,  equiva-
 lent to 15 horsepower,                                                                  is a
 statistical device used in the
 USSR and Communist China to
 convert tractors of various
 horsepower into comparable
 units.)   The acreage estimated
 as suitable for tractor culti-
 vation in China is less than
 half the area cultivated by
 tractors in the Soviet Union in
 1938 when that country con-
 sidered its agriculture basically
 mechanized.   Assuming China
 follows the Soviet example, Pei-
 ping should be able to realize
 its present program if it is
 able to acquire one half the
 Soviet vehicle inventory in
 1938--or 300,000 tractor units,
 77,000 combines, and 100,000
 trucks.
 The Chinese tractor park now
 contains 55,000 tractor units.
 If Peiping continues to allocate
 investment to tractor factories
 and imports at the rate of recent
 years,   or at  a slightly  higher
 rate,   it  should be  possible
 to    build  up  an   inventory

 of    300,000         tractor  units
 by  1969.    China's           first
 tractor plant has just come
 into operation at Loyang.         It
 was designed to produce 15,000
 5.5-ton crawler tractors an-
 nually, which is equivalent to
 36,000 standard units.   Assum-
 ing that this factory reaches
 capacity production by the
 Third Five-Year Plan  (1963-67),
 China would have more of this
 type by 1969 than the Soviet
 Union   did in 1938.  The re-
 quired number of combines and
 trucks may also be available
 from domestic industry in the
 next ten years under plans laid
 long before the announcement
 of the new program.
 Judging from Soviet expe-
 rience,                      this number of tractors,
 combines,  and trucks would con-
 sume about 3,000,000 tons of
 diesel and other liquid motor
 fuels annually by 1969,  but
 this amount should not be an
 insupportable strain on the
 petroleum products then avail-
 able in China.
 A major portion of the ma-
 chinery planned for Chinese ag-
 riculture is for irrigation and
 drainage equipment.   It has been
 stated that such equipment with
 a total capacity of 15,000,000
 horsepower will be needed to
 bring all farmland under irri-
 gation.   Some 1,100,000 horse-
 power was in use in 1958,  and
 it is claimed that 2,400,000
 horsepower is in use now.   The
 present level of output would
 by 1969 provide enough equip-
 ment to meet the estimated re-
 quirements.
 The Communists have stated
 that power-generating units to-
 taling 8,000,000 kilowatts must
 be turned out to reach the
 "first stage" of rural electri-
 fication.   If vigorously pushed,
 this goal could be attained by
 1969.   The need for a large
 maintenance and operating force
 and the severe limitation on
 generating capacity when water
 flow is low will create the
 greatest difficulties.
 The production of most farm
 quipment other than tractors--
 both tractor-drawn and simpler
 implements--and processing ma-
 chinery presents little problem
 to the machine-building industry.
 It has been stated that about
 20,000,000 farm tools and proc-
 essing machines have to be pro-
 duced for the mechanization pro-
 gram,  but industry should be
 able to manufacture these prod-
 ucts as demand develops.   Judg-
 ing from past experience, the
 major problem here will not be
 in supplying the equipment but
 in perfecting models suited to
 local conditions and in per-
 suading peasants to use them.
 The regime up to now has
 had little success in demon-
 strating to peasants that it
 knows more about farming than
 they do.   The vaunted two-wheel
 double-share plow, manufactured
 in large quantities in 1956,
 has never been put into general
 use.   Furthermore,  serious in-
 adequacies in agronomical re-
 search became evident in the
 past two years when attempts to
 change such farm practices as
 depth of planting, amount of
 fertilizer applied, closeness
 of planting, and extent of ir-
 rigation resulted in enormous
 expenditure of manpower for less
 than proportional returns in in-
 creased production.
 Some of the greatest prob-
 lems facing the regime are de-
 signing new and useful types
 of tools, developing and pro-
 viding improved seed strains,
 popularizing these innovations
 among a conservative and largely
 illiterate peasantry, and devis-
 ing a way to finance the purchase
 of new tools and equipment by
 rural production units.   There
 are signs that Peiping is becom-
 ing more aware of these prob-
 lems and is taking steps to
 cope with them.
 The new farm program
 stresses careful preparatory
 work and requires that research
 and experimentation precede the
 large-scale adoption of modern

 machinery.     In this connection,
 Peiping has also launched a
 campaign "basically" to elimi-
 nate illiteracy in the next
 two to three years so that
 peasants can acquire some tech-
 nical knowledge or at least
 be able to read instructions.
 Steps are also being taken to
 set up an agricultural exten-
 sion program in rural areas.
 Some 600 "agrotechnical re-
 search centers" have been set
 up under this program so far.
 These centers are to conduct
 experiments in seed strains,
 plowing techniques,  and pest
 control,  and will presumably
 be the vehicle for disseminat-
 ing the improved cultivation
 techniques Peiping hopes to
 introduce
 The immediate impact of
 the mechanization program will
 be slight.   Po I-po,  emphasiz-
 ing that it is to be carried
 out gradually,  anticipated that
 the initial foundation would
 require four years.    At the
 outset, priority is being given
 to irrigation facilities and
 tool improvement.
 A main objective of the
 program is to raise agricultural
 output to levels sufficient
 both to feed the rapidly grow-
 ing population and to maintain
 a high rate of industrial ex-
 pansion.   The use of tractors
 and combines in some areas may
 improve farm yields slightly
 through more timely and effici-
 ent field operations,  but
 greater increases will come
 from the use of more chemical
 fertilizer and expanded irriga-
 tion   The regime's statement
 that output will be doubled is
 highly doubtful.   Japan has
 made perhaps the greatest
 strides in agriculture of any
 country in the Orient,  and the
 Chinese would have to exceed
 by far Japan's best yields to
 double their output.   However,
 steady increases are quite pos-
 sible.
 Extensive reclamation work
 would improve the prospect for
 increases.   Such work is planned
 in the northwest,  but it is
 doubtful that the regime in-
 tends to devote sufficient re-
 sources there to bring appreci-
 able results in the near future.
 Another declared objective
 of the farm mechanization pro-
 gram is to release farm labor
 for other activities.   Communist
 planners mention figures ranging
 into the "hundreds of millions."
 It is suspected,  however,  that
 such figures are derived from
 simple calculations of the labor-
 saving capability of individual
 items of machinery and not from
 actual expectations.   Modern
 industry could not absorb any-
 where near such numbers.   Much
 labor replaced by machine will
 not,  however,  be released to
 industry but to other rural
 tasks.
 There will probably not
 be an appreciable movement off
 the farm until the later stages
 of the program.   The movement
 may then reach as much as half
 the natural population increase
 in rural areas,  causing urban
 population to expand from 96,-
 000,000 in 1958 to 196,000,000
 in 1969.   An expansion of this
 magnitude could probably be
 absorbed by nonagricultural
 sectors of the economy and by
 industry,  which is expected to
 quadruple its output during
 this periods
 By launching such a pro-
 gram at this time,  Peiping has
 acknowledged that agriculture
 must receive more substantive
 and careful attention than here-
 tofore if it is to meet the
 heavy demands of the country's
 industrialization program.
 Past policies,  ranging from
 consolidation of small individual
 farms into larger collective
 units to a massive effort at
 more intensive cultivation,
 have proved only of limited
 value.   The basic problem re-
 mains one of raising crop yields

 The United Arab Republic
 (UAR), which will celebrate
 its second anniversary on 21
 February, has been compelled
 to devote increasing attention
 to the difficulties inherent
 in the union between Egypt and
 Syria.   Syria, which urged such
 a union on President Nasir,  has
 in fact become his principal
 domestic political problem.
 Its stagnating economy  and
 Nasir's differences with Syrian
 politicians, mostly Baathists,
 are causing the greatest con-
 cerns
 Geographic-Cultural Problems
 The geographic separation
 of the two regions has compli-
 cated  Nasir's job.   Cairo prob-
 ably seems to the Syrians to be
 farther away than only 400
 miles because the enemy state
 of Israel lies between.   Re-
 moteness from the center of
 government has contributed to
 a Syrian feeling of nonpartici-
 pation;  the rarity of Nasir's
 visits to the northern region--
 three times in two years--
 strengthens this impression.
 The difficulty and ex-
 pense of traveling be-
 tween the two regions
 have hindered the
 personal exchanges
 that could at least
 partially diminish
 Syria's feeling   of
 isolation.   In  the
 last two years,those
 Egyptians who   have
 gone to Syria have
 been largely restrici;-
 ed to official gov-
 ernmental or mili-
 tary posts where
 their "unlikeness"
 to the Syrians is
 most easily noted.
 Some Syrians   feel
 AMMAN
 SECRET
 that the Egyp-
 tians intend to be--and some-
 times act like--their masters.
 The regime has tried   to
 attack the problem by careful
 conduct toward minorities,    re-
 assurances of its good inten-
 tions,  and constant propaganda
 on the theme of unity.  However,
 Syrian particularism--with its
 concentric arrangement of loyal-
 ties to family,  tribe,                                                                  locality,
 and religion--is probably one
 of the most serious barriers
 to real union. Differences
 among Christians, Moslems,
 Arabs,  Armenians,  Kurds, Druze,
 and Alawites and the divisions
 of landlord,  peasant, city
 bourgeoisie,and proletariat,
 all with special interests and
 prejudices,  plagued the govern-
 ments of Syria long before
 union with Egypt.
 With the union,  Nasir in-
 herited a melange of Syrian po-
 litical parties ranging from
 the narrowly nationalistic,  re-
 ligious Moslem Brotherhood--
 long banned in Egypt--to the

 Syrian branch of the Communist
 party,  the strongest in the
 Arab world.   In control of
 Syria at the time of union,
 however, was the Arab Social-
 ist Resurrection party,  popu-
 larly called the   Baath.    Its
 branches throughout the Arab
 world were the most vocal and
 effective supporters of Nasir's
 style of. Arab nationalism.   It
 was the Baathists,frightened
 by the growth of Communist and
 pro-Communist strength in
 Syria, who played the largest
 part in leading Syria into
 union with Egypt.
 Since union,the Baathists
 have had repeated occasions to
 repent their haste.  Their   as-
 sumption that,  being Syria's
 political leaders and strongly
 pro-Nasir,  they would receive
 preferential treatment   from
 Cairo seemed accurate at first,
 when Nasir appointed a   Syrian
 region executive council domi-
 nated by members of their par-
 ty.  They apparently could   not
 believe that Nasir's early
 edict banning political party
 activity,  as in Egypt, would
 be wholly effective.
 The Baathists discovered,
 however, when they attempted
 to continue their organization,
 that Nasir was aligning himself
 with old-line,conservative ele-
 ments and that these conserva-
 tives were favored to   defeat
 9aathist candidates in elec-
 tions to his new, single-party
 organization--the National
 Union.   The Nasir-11aathist feud
 culminated in the recent resig-
 nation of the remaining influ-
 ential Baathist members of the
 Syrian regional and UAR central
 cabinets.
 Nasir's victory over the
 Syrian Baathists now  appears
 complete,  but there are indi-
 cations  l;s aftermath harbors
 so-tue danger for the regime .
 The possibility of a renewed
 alliance between the Communists
 and the disgruntled Baathists--
 they cooperated frequently be-
 fore 1958--has not been over-
 looked by the Communists, who
 have reportedly already made
 new approaches to that end.
 The Communists,  although dec-
 imated   and disorganized   by
 Nasir's campaign last year,
 probably still retain some po-
 tential for taking advantage
 of a troubled situation in
 Syria. A Baathist-Communist
 coalition,  if it could gain
 support among dissident mili-
 tary elements,  might eventual-
 ly present a serious challenge
 to Nasir.
 The conflict with Syria's
 radical elements has  driven
 Nasir to an unforeseen and pure-
 ly expedient courtship of   the
 conservatives.   Financiers,  mer-
 chants,  landowners,  and  many
 professional groups,  displaced
 from their historically dominant
 position in Syrian politics by
 their own divisions and the
 mob appeal of the Baathists,
 welcomed the union.   They were
 later repelled when it began
 to seem they were not to be de-
 livered from Baathist control.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 During the past few months,
 however,  Nasir's split with
 the F3aathists,      his slowdown
 of land reform and economic
 controls--both Baathist objec-
 tives--and the current good-
 will mission of Vice President
 Amir in Syria have brought   at
 least temporary relief to   the
 minds of most conservatives.
 As long as the regime
 feels the Syrian political and
 economic systems require moder-
 ate   treatment,  the Syrian con-
 servatives are probably safe,
 and there is little likelihood
 that Nasir will be strong
 enough to push his concept of
 a "democratic,  socialist,  co-
 operative society" in Syria
 for several years.
 Syria-Iraq
 The often-mentioned threat
 to unity posed by the attrac-
 tion of  Iraq for some Syrians,
 although likely to worry Nasir,
 does not appear significant as
 long as Iraqi Prime Minister
 Qasim's own house is in dis-
 order.  In fact,  Nasir has had
 some propaganda success in ex-
 p1biting the chaotic political
 situation in Iraq, as well   as
 the bogey of Communism,  to
 counter any revival of the Fer-
 tile Crescent scheme of                  Iraqi-
 Syrian union.   The firm es-
 tablishment of a radical "Arab
 nationalist" government in
 Baghdad,  however,  could change
 the picture.
 Syrian Army
 The Syrian Army is a spe-
 cial,  and perhaps the most im-
 mediately dangerous,  problem
 for Nasir.,   For years prior to
 the union, the army was com-
 pletely involved in politics;
 there were five military coups
 between 1949 and 1954. The
 latest military strong man is
 Nasir's present security watchdog
 and civilian minister of in-
 terior for the Syrian region,
 Abd al-Hamid Sarraj.
 In league with Sarraj
 prior to the union was a power-
 ful army clique,  including nu-
 merous pro-Baathists,   Sarraj
 was instrumental in helping
 Nasir purge both civilian and
 military Baathists,  but his
 reliability is still debatable.
 He is believed to have retained
 an influential following in
 the armed forces, and any re-
 surgence of political ambition
 and real antiregime feeling a-
 mong the military would find
 him gauging it carefully be-
 fore deciding whether to remain
 loyal to Nasir,
 Nasir has taken steps   to
 preclude the army's return to
 its former troublesome role in
 politics.   A few officers,like
 Sarraj,  have been   invited   to
 give up their uniforms and ac-
 cept civilian government posi-
 tions.                                                                     Others have been trans-
 ferred,                                                                     retired, or purged,
 with an undetermined degree of
 resentment resulting through-
 out the rest of the military,
 Many key positions have been
 assigned to Egyptian personnel
 to keep the army neutralized.
 Its history of political ac-
 tion,  however, and its large
 complement of officers  who
 come from the politically con-
 scious segments of Syrian so-
 ciety, give grounds for believ-
 ing that dormancy is not  the
 army's natural state and sug-
 gest  that the regime may face
 further trouble.
 Probably the most urgent
 and basic concern of the re-
 gime in Syria is the decline
 of the Syrian economy since un-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 21 January 1960
 years of drought--a third ap-
 pears in the offing--have
 stifled Syria's free economy
 and aroused apprehension.  The
 regime is trying now to remedy
 the situation by back-tracking
 on reforms and relaxing con-
 trols, working  hard to gain
 the trust and cooperation   of
 Syria's land-owning and com-
 mercial groups,  and  seeking
 temporary outside aid,  particu-
 larly from the United States,
 For the long term,  the out-
 look for Syria--compared with
 the rather dark prospects for
 Egypt--is bright,  especially
 in agriculture,   More than
 three acres of cropped land is
 available for every Syrian, and
 per capita national income now
 is about $160,  compared with
 0,42 acre and $115 for Egypt.
 The region's short-run problems,
 however,  are likely to be se-
 vere,   Ominous inflationary
 pressures have developed,  chief-
 ly as a result of ordinary
 budget deficits since 1955,  and
 could well increase if present
 development  plans are carried
 through, as now planned, with-
 out compensating reductions in
 nondevelopmental expenditures,
 Political Outlook
 For the political future,
 Nasir is counting heavily on
 his National Union to develop
 a new breed of public servant,
 free   of factional  loyalties
 and    dedicated to the state.
 Election to the National Union
 --prerequisite to participa-
 tion in political life--begins
 on the lowest, popular level,
 and advancement from local to
 national responsibility comes
 through subsequent elections
 within the membership.
 SECRET
 On top of the pyramid thus
 constructed is, of course, Nasir
 himself.   His authority to se-
 lect whomever he chooses for
 the really important positions
 in government is a check on the
 rise of any individual or group
 out of step with the aims of
 the regime,   The Syrians,  cyni-
 cal by nature, are likely to
 regard such a system as merely
 a facade,  even though it may
 offer at least limited opportun-
 ities for political advancement.
 There have been rumors and
 speculation that Nasir may
 choose to relieve himself of
 some of the responsibility--
 and blame--for Syrian affairs
 by loosening the union into
 something closer to a feder-
 tion, with greater autonomy
 for both regions.   Although such
 a drastic step appears unlikely
 --partly because of the implied
 admission of failure--some con-
 cessions to the Syrians may be
 made with Nasir's scheduled ap-
 pointment of a new government
 and parliament in February.   The
 present dominance of Egyptians
 in the central UAR cabinet may
 be diminished.   Proportional rep-
 resentation in the parliament
 may also salve Syrian pride.
 Nasir is unlikely to let
 the parliament get out of hand,
 and will hand-pick half of the
 members, but it may furnish a
 forum for the airing of com-
 plaints and be something more
 than a rubber stamp.   Meanwhile,
 Nasir will probably continue
 relying on his personal popu-
 larity in the northern region--
 which apparently remains high--
 local scapegoats, and a good in-
 ternal security apparatus to
 keep dissension to a minimum.
