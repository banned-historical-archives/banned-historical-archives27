 by the bill would be employed in such
 a manner as to encourage innovation and
 allow for diversity on the part of State
 and local governments in the design,
 execution, and management of their own
 systems of personnel administration and
 their own training programs.
 The bill would:
 First. Provide for intergovernmental
 cooperation, through an advisory coun-
 cil appointed by the President, in the
 development of policies and standards
 for the administration of programs for
 improvement of State and local person-
 nel administration and training. The ad-
 visory council would report from time to
 time to the President and to the Con-
 gress, and in transmitting to the Con-
 gress reports of the advisory council, the
 President would submit to the Congress
 proposals of legislation which he deems
 desirable to carry out recommendations
 of the advisory council.
 Second. Authorize the Civil Service
 Commission to make grants to State and
 local governments to plan and to make
 improvements in their systems of per-
 sonnel administration.
 Third. Transfer to the Civil Service
 Commission responsibility for adminis-
 tration of existing Federal statutory pro-
 visions requiring merit personnel ad-
 ministration for State and local employ-
 ees engaged in certain federally assisted
 programs.
 Fourth. Authorize Federal agencies to
 admit State and local government offi-

 ministrative, professional, and technical
 occupations,  to Federal  training pro-
 grams. To meet the costs resulting from
 the admission of State or local em-
 ployees or officials to such training pro-
 grams, the Federal agency concerned
 may use its appropriations or may be
 reimbursed by State or local govern-
 ments, or the Civil Service Commission
 may use its appropriations to reimburse
 the Federal agency concerned or make
 advances toward these costs.
 Fifth. Authorize Federal agencies ad-
 ministering programs of financial grants
 or assistance to State or local govern-
 ments to provide special training for
 State and local government officials or
 employees who have responsibilities re-
 lated to those programs; and permit
 State and local governments to use ap-
 propriate  Federal funds to establish
 training courses for or to pay certain
 education expenses of their officials or
 employees who have responsibilities re-

 Ninth. Authorize the temporary ex-
 changing of personnel between the Fed-
 eral Government and States and local
 governments.
 Tenth. Direct the Civil Service Com-

 technical assistance services to State and

 effectiveness of administration.
 Mr. President, I hope that this bill can
 be given early consideration in the Sen-
 ote, and that it will receive final ap-
 proval by the Congress in time for It to
 be put into execution before the end of

 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
 will be received and appropriately re-
 ferred; and, without objection, the bill
 and section-by-section analysis of the
 bill will be printed in the; RECORD.
 The bill (S. 11) to reinforce the Fed-
 eral system by strengthening the per-
 sonnel resources of State and local gov-
 ernments, to improve intergovernmental
 funds, a national interest exists in a high
 caliber of public service in State and local
 governments.
 That the quality of public service at all
 levels of government can be improved by
 the  development of systems  of personnel
 administration consistent with such merit
 principles as-
 (1)  recruiting, selecting, and advancing
 employees on the basis of their relative abil-
 ity,                                                                                                                                        knowledge, and skills, including open
 consideration of qualified applicants for ini-
 tial appointment;
 (2) providing  equitable  and  adequate
 compensation;
 (3) training employees, as needed, to as-
 sure high-quality performance;
 (4) retaining employees on the basis of
 the adequacy of their performance, correct-
 ing Inadequate performance, and separating
 employees  whose  inadequate  performance
 cannot be corrected;
 (5) assuring fair treatment of applicants
 and employees in all aspects of personnel
 administration without regard to political
 affiliation, race, color, national origin, sex,
 or religious creed and with proper regard
 for their privacy and constitutional rights
 as citizens; and
 (6) assuring that employees are protected
 against coercion for partisan political pur-
 poses and are prohibited from using their
 official authority for the purpose of inter-
 fering with or affecting the result of an elec-
 tion or a nomination for office.
 That Federal financial and technical as-
 sistance to State and local governments for
 strengthening  their  personnel  administra-
 tion in a manner consistent with these prin-
 ciples is in the national interest.
 SEC. 3. The authorities provided by this

 systems of personnel administration.
 (b)  An application for a grant shall be
 made at such time or times, and contain

 sult in a reduction in relevant State or local
 government expenditures or the  substitu-
 tion  of Federal funds  for  State  or local
 funds previously made available for these
 purposes; and
 (5)  sets forth clear and practicable ac-
 tions for the improvement of particular as-
 pects of personnel administration such as-
 (A)                                                                           establishment of statewide personnel

 ation in personnel administration, with re-
 spect to such matters as recruiting, exam-
 ining, pay studies, training, education, per-
 sonnel  interchange,  manpower  utilization,

 SEC. 203. (a) The Commission is author-
 ized to make grants to general local govern-
 ments, or combinations of such governments,
 that serve a population of fifty thousand or
 more, for up to 75 per centum of the cost of
 developing and carrying out programs or
 projects which the Commission finds are con-
 sistent with the applicable principles set
 forth in clauses (1)-(6) of the third para-
 graph of section 2 of this Act, to strengthen
 the personnel administration of such govern-
 ments. Such a grant may be made only if,
 at the time of the submission of an applica-
 tion, the State concerned does not then cur-
 rently have an approved application for a
 grant adequately providing, in the judgment
 of the Commisson, for assistance in strength-
 ening the personnel administration of that
 local government or combination of local
 governments. However, such a grant, except
 as provided in subsection (b) (1) of this sec-
 tion, may not be made until the expiration
 of one year from the effective date of the
 grant provisions, as provided in section 513
 of this Act.
 (b) An application for a grant from a gen-
 eral local government or combination of gen-
 eral local governments shall be made at such
 time or times and shall contain such infor-
 mation as the Commission may prescribe.
 The Commission may make a grant under
 subsection (a) of this section only if the ap-
 plication therefor meets requirements similar
 to those established in section 202(b) of this
 Act for a State application for a grant, un-
 less  any  such  requirement  is  specifically
 waived by the Commission, and the require-
 ments of subsection (c) of this section. Such
 a grant may cover the costs of developing the
 program or project covered by the applica-
 tion. The Commission may-
 (1) waive, at the request of a general local
 government or combination of such govern-
 ments, ments, the one-year waiting period, unless
 the State concerned declares, within ninety
 days from the effective date of the grant pro-
 visions, as provided in section 513 of this
 Act, an indent to file an application for a
 grant that will provide adequately for as-
 sistance to the local government or govern-
 ments; and
 (2) make grants to general local govern-
 ments,  or  combinations  of  such  govern-
 ments, that serve a population of less than
 fifty thousand, If it finds that such grants
 will help meet essential needs in programs
 or projects of national interest and will as-
 sist general local governments experiencing
 special problems  in personnel administra-
 tion related to such programs or projects.
 (c) An application to be submitted to the
 Commission under subsection  (b)  of this
 section shall first be submitted by the gen-
 eral local government or governments to the
 State office designated under section 202(b)
 (1)  of this Act for review, except that, if
 no State office has been so designated, such
 application shall be submitted to the Gov-
 ernor for his review. Any comments and rec-
 ommendations of the State office or of the
 Governor, as the case may be, and a state-
 ment by the general local government or
 governments that such comments and rec-
 ommendations have been considered prior
 to its formal submission will accompany the
 application to the Commission. However, the
 application  need  not  be  accompanied  by
 such comments and recommendations and
 by such a statement if the general local
 government or governments certify that the
 application has been before the State office
 or the Governor, as the case may be, for re-
 view for a period of sixty days without com-
 ments or recommendations on the applica-
 tion being made by that office.
 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION IN
 RECRUITING AND EXAMINING
 SEC. 204.  (a)  The Commission may join,
 on a shared-costs basis, with State and local
 governments in cooperative recruiting and
 examining activities under such procedures
 and regulations as may jointly be agreed
 upon.
 (b) The Commission also may, on the writ-
 ten request of a State or local government
 and under such procedures as may be joint-
 ly agreed upon, certify to such governments
 from appropriate Federal registers the names
 of potential employees. The State or local
 government making the request shall pay
 the Commission for the costs, as determined
 by the Commission, of performing the serv-
 ice, and such payments shall be credited to

 TITLE III-TRAINING AND DEVELOPING STATE
 AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES
 SEC. 301. This section sets forth the basic
 purpose of this title, which is to strengthen
 State and local government programs for
 the training and development of their em-
 ployees and officials,  p. rticularly those in
 professional, administrative, and technical
 occupations.
 Admission to Federal employee training
 programs
 SEC. 302. Subsection (a)  of this section
 authorizes admittance of State and local gov-
 ernment employees and oflicials to training
 programs established by a Federal agency to
 train Federal professional, administrative, or
 technical personnel. The subsection provides
 that the admittance of State and local em-_
 ployees and officials is subject to such condi-
 tions as the head of the Federal agency es-
 tablishing the training program may pre-
 scribe.
 Subsection (b) of this section authorizes
 Federal agencies admitting State and local
 government employees and officials to their
 training programs to receive payments for
 the training from, or on behalf of, State and
 local governments, to waive all or part of
 such payments, and to enter into agreements
 concerning the payments with the State or
 local government concerned.
 Subsection (c)  of this section authorizes
 the Commission to use appropriations au-
 thorized by this Act to meet the additional
 developmental or overhead costs incurred be-
 cause of the admittance of State or local em-
 ployees to Federal training courses, and to
 reimburse other Federal agencies for these
 costs.
 Training of personnel engaged in grant-in-
 aid program
 SEC. 303. This section authorizes any Fed-
 eral agency that administers a program of
 grants or financial assistance to State or local
 governments to establish, provide, and con-
 duct training programs specifically for State
 and local government employees and officials
 who have responsibilities related to the said
 program. Federal agencies may, to the same
 extent provided in Section 302(b) of this
 Act, accept payments for such training from,
 or on behalf of, State and local governments
 waive such payments, and enter into agree-
 ments concerning the payments.
 The section further provides that any Fed-
 eral  agency  administering  a  program  of
 grants or financial assistance may authorize
 a State or local government, from Federal
 funds available for State or local program
 administration expenses, to establish, pro-
 vide, conduct, and support training and edu-
 cation programs, including fellowship pro-
 grams providing for full-time graduate-level
 study, for those of their employees and offi-
 cials who have responsibilities related to the
 aided program. Full-time graduate-level fel-
 lowship programs, to be approved, must be
 consistent with the provisions made for Gov-
 ernment Service Fellowships under Section
 306 of this Act.
 Section 306 provides that fellowships may
 not exceed two years of full-time graduate
 level study for professional, administrative
 and  technical personnel.  Grants made to
 State and general local governments to sup-
 port fellowship programs may-
 Cover the necessary costs of books, travel
 and transportation, and such related expenses
 as may be authorized;
 Provide reimbursement to the State or local
 government for up to 25 percent of the salary
 of each fellow during the period of the fel-
 lowship; and
 Cover payment to the educational institu-
 tion involved of such amounts as the Com-
 mission determines to be consistent with pre-
 vailing practices under comparable Federally
 supported programs less amounts charged the
 fellow for tuition and fees.
 Section 303 also provides that the State or
 local government concerned shall select the
 employee or official to receive the education
 or training and shall continue his full salary
 and normal employment benefits during the
 period of training. State and local govern-
 ments, however, must make their selections
 in accordance with such eligibility criteria as
 may be prescribed by the Federal agency con-
 cerned.
 Grants to State and local governments for
 training
 SEC. 304. This section authorizes the Com-
 mission, if training is not adequately pro-
 vided for under grant-in-aid or other stat-
 utes, to make grants to States and, under
 certain circumstances, to general local gov-
 ernments to meet up to seventy-five percent
 of the cost of developing and carrying out
 programs approved by the Commission, and
 consistent with the applicable principles of
 merit outlined in Section 2, for training their
 professional,  administrative,  and  technical
 employees and officials. Such grants may not
 be used to cover the costs of full-time grad-
 uate-level study, which is covered in Section
 306 of this Act, or of the construction or
 acquisition of training facilities.
 The State and local government's share of
 the costs may include the reasonable value
 of the facilities and personal services they
 provide. The State and local government's
 share of  costs may  not,  however,  consist
 solely  of  providing such  facilities   and
 services.
 An application for a grant shall be made
 at such time or times, and contain such in-
 formation as the Commission may prescribe.
 Subsection (b) sets forth the minimum re-
 quirements a State or general local govern-
 ment  application  for a  training  program
 grant must meet in order to be approved by
 the Commission. The Commission is author-
 ized to waive any_ of the requirements in a
 specified justified case. In general, these re-
 quirements         emphasize  the  importance  of
 careful planning, a comprehensive approach,
 strong leadership by  the  chief executive,
 inter-program and inter-jurisdictional coor-
 dination, and similar matters. In addition, a
 State or local government is required to pro-
 vide assurance that the grant will not result

 section (c) to make grants to a general local
 government serving a population of 50,000
 or more, or a combination of such local gov-
 ernments, if within one year from the effec-
 tive date of the grant provisions of this Act
 the State has not submitted and received
 approval of an application for a training
 program grant which adequately provides for
 such local government. The application sub-
 mitted by the local government must meet
 requirements similar to those established for
 State applications unless any requirement is
 waived by the Commission.
 The Commission is authorized to waive the
 one year waiting period and make grants to
 general local governments if such a govern-
 ment requests the waiver and the State gov-
 ernment concerned has not declared, within
 90 days of the effective date of the grant pro-
 visions of this Act, an intent to file an appli-
 Cation, for a grant that will provide ade-
 quately for the training of employees of the
 local government.
 The Commission may also waive the 50,000
 population requirement and make grants to
 smaller general local governments, or com-
 binations of such governments if it finds
 such grants will meet other essential needs
 in programs of national Interest.
 Subsection (d) provides that an applica-
 tion. submitted to the Commission under
 Subsection (c) shall first be submitted by
 the local government(s) to the designated
 State office for review, If no such office has
 been designated, it shall be submitted to the
 Governor. The application will be accom-
 panied to the Commission by any comments
 or recommendations received from the above
 State officials, and by a statement by the
 local government Indicating that such com-
 ments have been considered. However, if a
 60 day period should elapse without such
 review being affected by the above State offi-
 cials, the local government(s)  may certify
 such fact, and forward the application to the
 Commission.
 Grants to other organizations
 SEC. 305. This section authorizes the Com-
 mission to make grants to an organization
 representing member State or local govern-
 ments, or an association of State or local
 officials, as well as nonprofit organizations
 that meet certain requirements specified in
 the section. These grants may pay up to
 seventy-five percent of the costs of provid-
 ing training to State and local government
 professional, administrative, or technical em-
 ployees and officials. To make such grants,
 the  Commission  must first find  sufficient
 State or  local  government Interest in the
 training program and, In addition, must ap-
 prove the training program as meeting such
 requirements as may  be  prescribed by its
 regulations.
 Government service fellowships
 SEC. 306. This section authorizes the Com-
 mission to make grants to States and general
 local governments to support programs, ap-
 proved by the Commission, to provide fel-
 lowships for graduate-level study to profes-
 sional,  administrative,  and  technical  em-
 ployees such State and local governments
 have selected for this training. The grants
 may cover the necessary costs of travel and
 transportation, books and such related ex-
 penses Iti the Commission may authorize;
 reimbursement to the State or local govern-
 ment not to exceed one-fourth of the salary
 of the employee selected for the period of the
 graduate study, and payment to the educa-
 tional institutions involved of such amounts
 as the Commission determines to be  con-
 sistent with other prevailing practices under
 comparable Federally-funded programs, less
 any amount charged by the institution for
 tuition and non-refundable, fees and de-
 posits.
 A fellowship awarded by a State or general
 local government to a professional, admin-
 istrative or technical employee will be for
 a period not exceeding two years of full-time
 graduate-level study.
 This section provides that the State or gen-
 eral local government will, subject to eligi-
 bility criteria prescribed by the Commission,
 select the individual employee to be awarded
 :, fellowship. The State or general local gov-
 ernment must, during the period of the fel-
 lowship, continue the full salary and nor-
 mal employment benefits (such as credit for
 seniority, leave accrual, retirement, and in-
 surance) to which the recipient of the fel-
 lowship Is entitled, and outline in the ap-
 plication the plans made for. the employer's
 c.o,ntinued utilization in the public service.
 Coordination of Federal programs
 SEC. 307. This section directs the Com-
 mission, after consultation with other con-
 cerned Federal agencies, to prescribe regula-
 tions covering the training provided for in
 title III of the Act. The regulations are to
 include  requirements  for  coordination  of,
 and reasonable consistency in, the training
 programs established by the Commission and
 by other Federal agencies under title III.
 In addition, the section directs the Com-
 mission, again after consultation with other
 Federal agencies concerned, to coordinate the
 training support given State', and local gov-
 ernments under this Act with that provided
 under other Federal programs. The Commis-
 sion is to make such arrangements as needed
 to avoid duplication among Federal programs
 providing for training of State and local
 government employees and to insure con-
 sistent  administration  of  related  Federal
 training activities. The Commission is au-
 thorized to collect and maintain appropriate
 data on Federal agency training grants and
 programs.
 TITLE V-I&OBILITY OF FEDERAL, STATE, AND
 LOCAL EMPLOYEIIS
 SEC. 401. This section set forth the purpose
 of title IV, namely to facilitate intergovern-
 mental cooperation by authorizing temporary
 assignments of personnel between the Fed-
 eral Government and State and local gov-
 ernments.
 SEC. 402. This section adds a new sub-
 chapter VI at the end of Chapter 33 of title
 5 of the United States Code embodying the
 mobility provisions.
 Definitions
 Section 3371 of the new subchapter de-
 fines "State" and "local government" for the
 purpose of this title. These definitions are
 intended to be broad enough to include any
 agency of a State or local government at
 any level; their instrumentalities, including
 multi-State authorities and intra-State au-
 thorities; Federal-State authorities; and the
 District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of
 Puerto Rico, and a territory or possession of
 the United States.
 There is no special definition of a Federal
 agency or a Federal employee,in this section.
 For the purposes of this title a Federal agency
 would be any Executive agency as defined
 under section 105 of title 5 of the United
 States Code. The definition of Federal em-
 ployee would be that which appears in sec-
 tion 2105 of title 5. Uniforrred personnel,
 including those In  the  Coat Guard,  the
 Public Health Service, and the Coast and
 Geodetic "Survey do not come under its
 coverage.
 General provisions
 SEC. 3372. This section provides the broad
 framework for  establishing , mobility pro-
 grams. It authorizes assignments of employ-
 ees, with their consent, from one govern-
 mental jurisdiction to another for periods up
 to two years. Assignments could be extended
 by the Federal agency head concerned for
 not to exceed two years. The assignment
 would have to be for work which the Federal
 agency head determined would be of mutual
 benefit to his agency and the State or local
 jurisdiction concerned. Subchapter (b)  au-
 thorizes the assignment of an employee of an
 Executive agency to an institution of higher
 learning, and vice versa. Private as well as
 public institutions of higher learning would
 come under the purview of this provision.
 Assignment of Federal employees to States or
 local governments
 SEC. 3373. This section deals with the as-
 signment of Federal employees to State and
 local jurisdictions. Under subsection (a) em-
 ployees could be assigned either on a detail
 or leave without pay basis, whichever seems
 most desirable to the agencies involved. Em-
 ployees serving on a detail basis would be
 treated as Federal employees for all purposes
 except that their supervision would be gov-
 erned by agreement between the participat-
 ing agencies. The Federal Tort Claims Act
 and any other Federal tort liability statute
 would  continue to  apply  to Federal  em-
 ployees whether on detail or on leave without
 pay.
 Subjection (b) provides that assignments
 either on a detail or leave without pay basis
 may be made with or without reimbursement
 by the State or local government for salary,
 supplemental salary, and travel and trans-
 portation expenses of Federal personnel. Au-
 thority would be available for Federal agen-
 cies to receive reimbursement from the State
 or local agency for all or part of the expenses
 of Federal employees.
 Subsection (c)  sets the ground rules for
 assignments of Federal employees to State
 and local governments on leave without pay.
 Such personnel would be given State or local
 government appointments, and their salary
 would come from State or local funds. How-
 ever, Federal appropriations would be au-
 thorized for certain expenses. If the rate of
 pay for a State position is less than the rate
 of pay the Federal  employee would have
 received  had he remained at his Federal
 post, the Federal agency would pay a salary
 supplement equal to the difference. The sup-
 plement would be payable as earned, and
 would not be conditional on such factors as
 completion of the full period of assignment.
 Employees serving on leave without pay
 would earn leave at the same rate as they
 would have earned it had they remained in
 their regular jobs. Employees would not be
 authorized to earn leave at a higher rate
 even if the position they occupied in the
 State  government  normally  called  for  a
 higher  earning  rate.  The  determination
 whether  the Federal     Government  or the
 State or local government paid for the leave
 would be arrived at by agreement between
 the participating agencies.
 Federal employees on leave without pay
 would be entitled to continuation of their
 retirement, life insurance, and health bene-
 fits coverage under the civil service or other
 applicable systems as long as they currently
 paid  the  employee  contribution  into  the
 appropriate fund or system. The employer
 contribution would be paid by the Federal
 agency originating the assignment for all
 three types  of  coverage.  These  personnel
 would continue to be covered under 5 U.S.C.
 8501-8508 relating to unemployment com-
 pensation benefits.
 Service performed on such assignments on
 leave without pay would be creditable for
 Federal salary,  retention,  retirement,  and
 leave accrual purposes. Such service would
 also be creditable for early retirement pur-
 poses for law enforcement personnel under
 5 U.S.C.8336(c).
 There is one circumstance, however, under
 which Federal  health, life  insurance,  and
 retirement benefits would not be authorized.
 That would be when employees or their bene-
 ficiaries  elected to receive                                                                                                                                           benefits under
 State or local systems instead. The policy

 throughout this title is to bar the receipt
 of dual benefits by Federal employees for
 any purpose?
 Subsection (d) (1) provides that if an em-
 ployee on leave without pay is injured or
 killed in the performance of official duty,
 he or his beneficiary shall be treated for the
 purpose of injury compensation benefits as
 if he had been, injured or killed while on
 active duty in  is agency. Here, too, the em-
 ployee or his beneficiary would have a choice
 between Federal and State benefits. And
 of the non-Federal benefit is selected, the
 employee or his beneficiary would not be
 entitled to a parallel Federal benefit.
 Under subsection (d) (2) an employee who
 elects to receive State workmen's compen-
 sation benefits would not be entitled to Fed-
 eral disability retirement for the same pe-
 riod.
 Assignment of State or local government
 employee
 Assignment of State or local government
 employees
 Svc. 3374. This section sets forth the con-
 ditions for assignment of State and local em-
 ployees to the Federal Government.
 Subsection (a) provides two methods for
 assigning State and local employees to Fed-
 eral agencies which are comparable to the
 two methods authorized for Federal employee
 assignments to State and local governments.
 State or local employees could serve either
 on a detail basis or under a temporary Fed-
 eral appointment without regard to the pro-
 visions governing appointment in the com-
 petitive civil service. An employee who is de-
 tailed to the Federal Government would re-
 main a State government employee for most
 purposes. A State employee given a Federal
 appointment would be" treated in the same
 "Way as any other temporary Federal em-
 ployee for most purposes. He would not be
 entitled to tenure,  and his appointment
 could be terminated at any time by the Fed-
 eral agency employing him.
 Subsection (b)- provides that a State em-
 ployee given a Federal appointment would
 come under the coverage of the Civil Service
 Retirement Art or other applicable retire-
 ment systems  or the Federal Employees
 Group Life Insurance Act. He would not be
 covered under the Federal Employees Health
 Benefits Act or similar authority unless his
 Federal appointment resulted in the loss of
 coverage under a State or local health bene-
 fits system.
 Subsection (c) is concerned with the sta-
 tus of State and local personnel detailed to
 a Federal agency. Such personnel would not
 be entitled to Federal pay, but would be
 considered Federal employees for the purpose
 of certain Federal employee laws including
 those relating to conflict of interest, politi-
 cal activity, failure to account for public
 money, disclosure of confidential informa-
 tion, lobbying with appropriated funds, and
 tort claims. In addition, they would be sub-
 ject to such regulations as the President may
 prescribe. The supervision of the duties of
 a State or local detailee would be governed
 by  agreement  between  the  participating
 agencies. A Federal agency could reimburse
 a State or local agency for all or part of the
 salary of a State or local detallee.
 Subsection (d) provides that a State or
 local government employee serving on detail
 or under Federal appointment who is dis-
 abled or dies as a result. of personal injury
 sustained while in the performance of of-
 ficial duty is to be treated as aFederal em-
 ployee for on-the-job injury compensation
 benefits. However, as in the case of the Fed-
 eral employee who is injured serving on a
 State or local government assignment, the
 State or local employee or his beneficiary
 would not be entiled to receive both Fed-
 eral and State benefits for the same injury.
 Subsection (e) provides that if a State
 or local government fails to continue the
 employer's contribution to the State or local
 government retirement, life insurance, and
 health benefit plans for a State or local gov-
 ernment employee under Federal appoint-
 ment, the employer's contribution or a part
 thereof, may be paid by the Federal agency
 concerned. In these situations, the Federal
 agency would transmit deposits directly to
 the State or local government system.
 Travel expenses
 SEC. 3375, This section authorizes the pay-
 ment of travel and transportation expenses
 and per diem for State and local government
 employees assigned to Federal agencies and
 Federal employees assigned to State and local
 governments. This section is intended to be
 broad enough to provide for the needs of
 Federal, State, and local employees enroute
 to, from, and during their assignments in
 either the Federal Government or State and
 local governments.
 The  authorizations  provided  would  be
 available for Federal agency use on a dis-
 cretionary basis under regulations prescribed
 by the President.
 Subsection (a) (1) provides authotity for a
 Federal agency to pay the costs of travel, in-
 cluding  mileage  and  allowances, and  per
 diem in lieu of subsistence in accordance with
 subchapter I of Chapter 57, title 5, United
 States Code, of Federal, State and local em-
 ployees enroute to, from, and during assign-
 ment.
 Subsection (a) (2) provides authority to
 pay the travel and transportation expenses
 of the immediate families of employees as-
 signed to another governmental jurisdiction
 and return. This includes transportation of
 household goods and personal effects, pack-
 ing, crating, temporarily storing and unpack-
 ing, etc.
 Subsection (a) (3)  provides authority to
 pay a per diem allowance for the immediate
 family of the employee while enroute to and
 from the assignment location in accordance
 with section 5724a(a) (1) of title 5 of the
 United States Code.
 Subsection (a) (4) would authorize pay-
 ment of subsistence expenses for the em-
 ployee and his immediate family for a period
 up to 30 days while occupying temporary
 quarters at the assignment location with
 section 5724a(a) (3) of title 5.
 Subsection (a) (5) provides for the pay-
 ment of expenses of nontemporary storage
 of household goods and personal effects in
 connection with assignment at an isolated
 location in accordance with section 5726(c)
 of title 5.
 Subsection (b) provides that the expenses
 specified in subsection (a) may not be al-
 lowed unless the employee signs a written
 agreement to complete the entire period of
 his assignment or one year, whichever is
 shorter, unless separated for reasons beyond
 his control. If the agreement is violated, the
 expenses would be recoverable by the United
 States. However, an agency head could waive
 the right of recovery with respect to State or
 local government employees assigned to his
 agency.
 Subsection (c) authorizes the use of ap-
 propriations to transport the remains and
 personal effects of employees and their de-
 pendents who die while on an assignment.

 ployees affected, the Urgency of the program,
 the need for funds, and the potential of the
 particular jurisdiction to use the funds most
 effectively.
 Subsection (b) states that 15 ty of the total
 funds available for grants In each fiscal year
 shall  be apportioned equally among the
 States.
 Any unused portion of such funds at the

 S. 14-INTRODUCTION OF BILL TO
 PROVIDE FOR THE ESTABLISH-
 MENT  OF  A  COMMISSION  ON
 AFRO-AMERICAN HISTORY AND
 CULTURE
 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, on behalf
 of Senators BAYH, BROOKE, ,CASE, COOK,
 GOODELL, HART, HARTKE, HATFIELD,
 INOUYE, JAVITS, MCGEE, MATHIAS, MILLER,
 MONDALE, MUSKIE,   NELSON, PERCY,
 SCHWEIKER, WILLIAMS of New Jersey, and
 myself, I introduce for appropriate ref-
 erence a bill to establish a Co emission on
 Afro-American  History  and Culture.
 Congressman SCHEUER, of New York, is
 introducing a companion measure in the
 House of Representatives. A :'similar pro-
 posal, H.R. 12962, was approved late in
 the second session of the last Congress
 by the House. My bill of last year was
 approved by the Subcommittee on Arts
 and Humanities of the Senate Labor and
 Public Welfare Committee. The immi-
 nence of adjournment prevented the 90th
 Congress from completing action on the
 legislation.
 I am encouraged by the actions taken
 by the full House and the Senate sub-
 committee and I feel sure that the pro-
 posal to establish a Commission on Afro-
 American History and Culture will be
 accepted by this Congress.
 The congressional hearings on last
 year's bill emphasized a black imbalance
 in American history as ta{lght in our
 schools as well as in other. areas. I do
 not believe that stepping from total
 neglect of Negro history into crash pro-
 grams with short life spans can ade-
 quately meet the challenge of dissemina-
 tion of black history and culture. There
 must be positive and deliberate programs
 of research, preservation an dissemina-
 tion of the black heritage. My proposal
 to establish a Commission on Afro-
 American History and Culture can do
 this. It could be the catalyst which
 brings better understanding of the total
 nature of our society to all! Americans.
 The challenge goes out to all citizens to
 spread the word that Negroet have made
 sound contributions to our, country. It
 must be met by those in the communica-
 tions media, historians, sociologists, and
 politicians.
 The academic community is taking
 some positive steps by providing studies
 of African-American history and culture.
 For the first time In history a major
 American university, Yale, is offering a
 degree in black culture. Seven institu-
 tions of higher learning this past sum-
 mer conducted workshops designed to
 inform faculty members of available ma-
 terials in the area of Negro history and
 culture. However, such workshops are
 handicapped by the shortage of books,
 monographs, and research work in this
 field. Many State colleges, State uni-
 versities, and land-grant colleges have
 added a black-American dimension to
 their curriculum through courses in black
 history and culture. But there is a need
 for much more historical data on the
 Negro in America to add to the substance
 of curriculum. The scarcity of organized
 reference material on the black Ameri-
 can makes research exteremely difficult.
 The time is ripe for national leader-
 ship in fostering better understanding
 and knowledge of the contributions of
 African-Americans and their heritage to
 American society.
 This does not mean just including an
 African-American  history  course  in
 school curriculums; it also means high-
 lighting the presence of the Negro in a
 wide range of activities such as litera-
 ture, economics, music, or political sci-
 ence as the activity itself is studied or
 publicized. I believe the Commission will
 serve best when it performs this task of
 identifying  and dramatizing,  in the
 classroom and out,'the black man's con-
 tributions to the total American experi-
 ence. At its best, such an effort will sup-
 port the long and often tragic struggle
 of the Negro, himself, to feel a part of
 this experience.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the text of my proposal be
 printed in the RECORD, together with an
 article which appeared in the Johns
 Hopkins magazine, summer 1968 Issue,
 entitled "The Burden of Negro History,"
 which will shed further light on this
 subject. In this article, its author, Hugh
 Davis Graham, says:
 To the degree that classroom courses in
 Negro history and culture, if taught by com-
 petent instructors with a critical sense of
 responsibility to the evidence, can contrib-
 ute to both white and black understanding
 of the legacy of American Negroes, then this
 is clearly desirable-even urgent.
 May I add that a critical sense of re-
 sponsibility to the evidence by all Amer-
 icans should and must begin to be woven
 into every facet of our society, and that
 this, too, is clearly desirable-even ur-
 gent.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
 will be received and appropriately re-
 ferred; and, without objection, the bill
 and article will be printed in the RECORD.
 The bill (S. 14) to provide for the es-
 tablishment of a Commission on Afro-
 American History and Culture, intro-
 duced by Mr. SCOTT, was received, read
 twice by its title, referred to the Com-
 mittee on Labor and Public Welfare, and
 ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as
 follows:

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, January 9, 1969
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. Mr. Speaker, to-
 day as the Congress meets in joint ses-
 sion to hail the great technical achieve-
 ment of the flight of Apollo 8, and to
 extend the Nation's admiration and grat-
 itude to its courageous crew, I am par-
 ticularly pleased to bring to the atten-
 tion of my colleagues two editorials from
 leading newspapers in the Sixth Con-
 gressional District of Michigan. One is
 entitled, "'Shooting the Moon' Really
 Benefits All," and appeared in the Jack-
 son Citizen  Patriot,  Jackson,  Mich.,
 Wednesday, January 1, 1969; and the
 other is headlined, "Apollo Opens Door
 to Universe," reflecting the view of the
 Owosso Argus Press, Owosso, Mich.,
 Thusrday, January 2, 1969.
 Both of these themes are particularly
 well stated and I believe are clearly ap-
 propriate additions to the permanent
 record of today's proceedings.
 The editorials follow:
 [From the Jackson (Mich.) Citizen Patriot,
 Jan. 1, 19691
 "SHOOTING THE MOON" REALLY BENEFITS
 ALL
 The fantastic feats performed by the crew
 of Apollo 8, as well as the ship itself, occupy
 center stage as the new year dawns, and
 properly so.
 Yet along with the praise from around the
 world comes the nagging question expressed
 in various ways: Yes, but-what good does
 It do, what have we gained from the billions
 poured into the effort?
 Someone recalled  that  President Eisen-
 hower had decided against pressing for the
 flight on the grounds the money was more
 useful in other places, and a few scientists
 still hold more information can be obtained
 by un-manned, automated space probes.
 These  are  the  questions  posed  by  the
 pessimist in us, while it is the ever-present
 optimist that provides the answers.
 There is something within all human be-
 ings, some invisible force, that keeps man
 reaching for the unattainable-reaching un-
 til he has attained the impossible. All prog-
 ress, from the caves to the breakthrough
 into space travel, is the result of that drive
 to know more, to conquer everything just
 because it is there.
 It is not a wholly American trait, even
 though we sometimes like to think so, but
 it does get a freer rein in this, country.
 There are many who decry that attitude,
 but decrying it won't still the urge geneti-
 cally implanted in the human mind. Knowl-
 edge is imperfect, thus more effort must be
 put into perfecting it.
 Tremendous benefits are beginning to flow
 into our daily lives from the space effort, al-
 though admittedly they are still relatively
 a trickle.
 For the time being they are evidenced
 mostly in the fantastic subminiturization of
 mechanical devices and the studies of radia-
 tion. Both have found their way into the
 medical arts as well as scientific usage.
 Perhaps the most dramatic of these bits
 of progress are the new micro-batteries that
 can be implanted under the human skin to
 keep  Pacemakers  working  at  regulating
 heartbeats, and more obviously, the revolu-
 tionary effects on communications,
 Billions of dollars are being saved annually
 by farmers because weather satellites are
 performing on high, telling the when and
 where of storms. In the future are space ob-
 servations of crop disease and the causes, as
 well as water or mineral imbalances in the
 soil. World-wide crop advice and manage-
 ment is within reach of a globe whose peo-
 ples have starvation, undernourishment and
 well-being spread unequally. Solution of this
 last problem alone would justify the expense
 involved.
 The Apollo 8 communications opened a
 whole new era, and already a Japanese man-     Such a station is also a necessary fore-

 Progress has been made in such fields as
 housing (and all of its iritegral areas such
 as wiring, plumbing and basic construction),
 medicine, new fields of employment, and so
 on.
 Thus the conquests of Apollo 8 are not so
 limited as firing a rocket around the moon
 and back, but include significant advances
 for all.

 APOLLO OPENS DOOR TO UNIVERSE
 Ten lunar orbits do not a successful moon
 landing make, but the brilliant and virtually
 flawless  performance of Apollo  8  and  its
 crew render that accomplishment almost a
 foregone conclusion in 1969.
 Thus it is not too early to begin asking,
 "Where do we go from here in space-if
 anywhere?"
 With the major development work on the
 Apollo Project completed, Americans have
 in their national inventory the production
 and testing facilities and highly skilled per-
 sonnel representing an investment of some
 $30 billion. This investment can either be
 dismantled, as was the nation's investment
 We ought not to make the mistake of
 Daniel Webster, who vowed never to vote
 for the spending of a cent of the public
 money on the exploration of the "useless"
 American West.
 There  remains  near-earth  space,  whose
 manifold uses we have only begun to appre-
 ciate and exploit. A permanent manned space
 laboratory is a logical post-Apollo goal and
 one which there is good indication the Rus-
 gantic Saturn rockets to send a few men
 directly to the moon, and unfeasible to sup-
 ply them this way.
 With an earth-orbiting space station, reg-
 ular shuttle flights to the moon can become
 a reality. Beyond that, it would be an as-
 sembling and stepping-off point for explora-
 tion of the nearer planets.
 The Apollo project is not yet completed,
 but it has already opened the door on a vast
 new  realm-nothing  less  than  the  entire
 universe. We cannot allow that door to close
 again, for to do so would be to fail our own
 dreams.

 FEDERAL SALARY INCREASES
 HON. CLARENCE E. MILLER
 of OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, January 9, 1969
 Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, on
 Monday, January 6, 1969, this body
 passed H.R. 10, increasing the salary of
 the President of the United States by
 100 percent. The salary to be received
 by the new President beginning Janu-
 ary 20, 1969, will be $200,000 per year.
 The matter of Federal spending and
 salary increases, not only for the Presi-
 dent, but for other Federal officeholders,
 is one of great concern to me personally
 and to many of my constituents.
 During debate on H.R. 10 there were
 two points brought out in the arguments
 in favor of the measure. One was that a
 great amount of the increase would be
 returned to the Treasury in the form of
 taxes. The other argument was that re-
 cent Presidents have had to dig into their
 own funds to pay some of the costs of
 operation of the office. Let us analyze
 these two arguments.
 First was the argument that most of
 the increase would be returned to the
 Treasury in the form of income taxes. I
 quote from comments on page H73 of
 the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD Of January 6,
 1969:
 Out of this $100,000 increase, between
 $65,000 and $70,000 will be turned right back
 around, to come back to the Treasury as taxes
 on the President's salary, so we are talking
 here about $30,000 to $35,000.
 The second argument was that the
 President has had to pay, out of his own
 pocket, some of the costs of operation of
 his office. If this is true and can be doc-
 umented I do not believe a measure
 which would directly offset such valid ex-
 penses as the President may incur would
 have any great amount of difficulty being
 passed by the Congress. It is true that
 costs are higher and if the present ex-
 pense allowance authorized, the Presi-
 dent is not sufficient, then it perhaps
 should be increased.
 The point I wish to make is that the
 President cannot use the increase for ex-
 penses of the office and the increase also
 be returned to the U.S. Treasury. It must
 be one way or the other.
 Both of these arguments, the costs of
 operation of the office, and the actual net
 eluding Members of Congress, without
 having them too near the President's in-
 come on the established salary scale.
 In the budget message scion to come
 from the President some large increases
 are expected for Federal employees,
 starting at the top with Cabinet mem-
 bers and continuing through' members of
 the Armed Forces. This increase is ex-
 pected to cost approximately $3 billion.
 In an era when we are talking of re-
 straint and austerity it seems unreason-
 able that a top executive's p y should be
 increased 100 percent.
 At the close of debate on' H.R. 10 the
 yeas and nays were refused. !A motion to
 reconsider was laid on the table. Two-
 thirds of those present voted in favor, the
 rules were suspended, and the bill was
 passed.
 No rollcall vote was taken and, as a
 result, the RECORD does not indicate those
 who would have voted against H.R. 10.
 I would like to state that fad the roll
 been called I would have voted against
 doubling the salary of the President.
 COMMISSIONER OF POLICE PRO-
 POSED FOR THE DI TRICT OF
 COLUMBIA
 HON. JOEL T. BROYHILL
 OF VIRGINIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, January 9, 1969
 Mr.                                         BROYHILL  of  Virginia.  Mr.
 Speaker, today I am introducing legisla-
 tion in behalf of myself, the Honorable
 JOHN L. MOMILLAN,                                                  chairmnan  of the
 Committee on the District of Columbia;
 Mr. DOWDY, of Texas; Mr. ABERNETHY,
 of Mississippi; Mr. HAGAN,I of Georgia;
 Mr. O'Koxsxr, of Wisconsinl; Mr. WINN,
 of Kansas; and Mr. FUQUA, of Florida, to
 create a Commission of Police for the
 Nation's Capital under direct control of
 the Congress and consolidate the five
 major police forces in the District under
 that Commissioner.
 This legislation creates a Commissioner
 of Police for the Nation's Capital under
 direct control of the Congress. The Com-
 missioner would assume complete juris-
 diction over the Metropo'lit#n Police, the
 Park Police, the White House Police, the
 Capitol Police, and the National Zoo-
 logical Park Police=now under jurisdic-
 tion of the Commissioner a #d City Coun-
 cil; the Secretary of the Interior; the
 Secretary of the Treasury; the Sergeants
 at Arms of the House and' Senate; and
 the Secretary of the Smithsonian, in that
 order.
 The bill would also create a nine-man
 advisory commission, five of whose mem-
 bers would be citizens of the District of
 Columbia.
 The Commissioner would be appointed
 by the Speaker of the House of Repre-
 sentatives and the President pro tempore
 of the Senate, and wofold be directly
 responsible to the Congress. He would be
 charged with the creation of the neces-
 sary agency to discharge the duties of
 his office, and would be similar in char-
 acter to the Comptroller General or the
 Public Printer in his role as a servant of
 the Congress.
 Mr. Speaker, this organizational struc-
 ture is patterned in part on nearly a
 century and a half of success experi-
 enced by a distinguished police force in
 another world capital. Since Sir Robert
 Peel created the Metropolitan Police Dis-
 trict of London in 1829, the police force
 known to millions throu3;?,hout the world
 as Scotland Yard has functioned under a
 Commissioner of Police directly respon-
 sible to Parliament's office of the Home
 Secretary, and not to the municipal gov-
 ernment of London. Today it is a re-
 spected, highly effective organization of
 19,000 men.
 Great Britain has 148 regular police
 forces, all of which are controlled by
 local authority, with the sole exception
 of Scotland Yard. It also should be noted
 that, contrary to popular notion, Scot-
 land Yard has no official jurisdiction out-
 side of Greater London. To be sure, its
 central investigative division cooperates
 with and assists other police forces
 throughout the United Kingdom and
 throughout the world.
 I think it is fair to say that Scotland
 Yard has functioned with a record of
 efficiency which is the envy of police de-
 partments the world ov? r, and those of
 us who have been in London in recent
 years can attest to the safety of that city
 and to the good relations that exist be-
 tween Londoners and their police.
 It is my desire to see created a force
 such as the Metropolitan Police of Lon-
 don here in the city of Washington, D.C.
 It is not my desire to create a national
 police force, or a secret police establish-
 ment to grind underfoot the legitimate
 complaints of the citizens of the District
 of Columbia and its visitors.
 I strongly urge that we reflect a mo-
 ment on the success of the British and
 the advantages that are possible to
 achieve under such a system. There are
 obvious financial gains to be had. The
 Metropolitan Police Force will cost the
 city of Washington $43,033,000 during
 the next fiscal year. This figure will be
 higher as time goes on. This is an ex-
 pense that could constitutionally be
 borne by the Congress. and a substantial
 savings to the city could accrue if this
 legislation is enacted.
 I believe the Congress could afford and
 would approve the necessary funds to
 staff and equip a department equal to
 the police needs of the city. It could also
 afford and I believe would approve funds
 necessary to bridge the rap between the
 people of the District of Columbia and
 the police officer. Such an effort would
 call for educated, highly talented person-
 nel and coordinated efforts to project the
 police officer in the role of guardian as
 well as enforcer of the law, and would
 have to be prosecuted vigorously. None
 of these things can be done as effectively

 when the findings of a special Presiden-
 tial Task Force on Telecommunications
 had already been submitted-though
 they were not yet published-finding
 that had in fact reached exactly the op-
 posite conclusion with regard to CATV
 from the viewpoint reflected in the
 Commission's own proposed regulations
 and its interim orders. In other words
 the  task  force  had  concluded  that
 CATV should be expanded to serve the
 public interest, not curtailed.
 FCC Commissioner Robert T. Bartley,
 in a dissenting statement, declared that
 application of the Commissioner's in-
 terim rules is a fatally defective proce-
 dure because the rules are in fact sub-
 stantive and thus have been applied
 without rulemaking procedures required
 by the Administrative Procedure Act. I
 could not agree with Mr. Bartley more.
 The Commissioner also notes the "`dis-
 tinct possibility" that the interim order
 will stifle further development of CATV,
 and again, as I have already indicated, he
 is cooking with gas.
 Mr. Speaker, legislation has already
 been introduced in this House by the
 gentleman from California  (Mr. VAN
 DEERLIN) calling for a full investigation
 by the Committee on Interstate and
 Foreign Commerce of this whole- CATV
 rules matter. I fully support this resolu-
 tion. Surely if one administrative agency
 of Government can, by a single action,
 take away the jobs of hundreds of
 American citizens and jeopardize the in-
 vestment of thousands of businessmen
 and stockholders, and disrupt the tele-
 vision service of millions of Americans
 living in rural areas, and do all this
 without even so much as a "by your
 leave, sir," to the Congress, then some-
 thing is very seriously wrong.
 Indeed, I believe that even stronger
 action than just an investigation is
 needed to restore justice and equity.
 While we investigate, CATV will con-
 tinue to stagnate, thousands of men and
 women will remain without employment,
 and millions of families will be without
 adequate television coverage.
 If the Federal Communications Com-
 mission does not promptly rescind its in-
 terim orders I intend to introduce legis-
 lation to force their repeal. I hope such a
 course will not be necessary, but if the
 FCC remains obstinate this Congress can
 and must move quickly to correct their
 outrageous and improper action, plainly
 directed against the welfare of millions
 of plain Americans whose only fault is
 that they happen to live in rural America
 instead of in one of the big cities.
 CONGRESSMAN STRATTON INTRO-
 DUCES CONGRESSIONAL AMEND-
 MENT TO ELIMINATE THE TWO
 MOST GLARING DEFECTS IN OUR
 PRESENT ELECTORAL, SYSTEM
 (Mr. STRATTON asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Speaker, one is-
 sue on which most Americans are agreed,
 in the light of some of our experiences in
 the recent presidential election, is that
 there are grave deficiencies in the pres-
 ent electoral college system of electing
 a President of the United States, and
 that reform is very definitely in order.
 The other day I introduced a resolu-
 tion-House Joint Resolution 189-in the
 House, designed to correct the two most
 serious of these deficiencies; namely, the
 arrangement that throws the election of
 a President into the House of Repre-
 sentatives if no candidate receives a ma-
 jority of the electoral vote; and the ar-
 rangement which makes it possible le-
 gally for an individual elector to cast his
 ballot for someone other than the candi-
 date for whom he was chosen to be an
 elector.
 My proposed amendment, I might add,
 is identical to House Joint Resolution 1,
 introduced earlier in this session by the
 distinguished gentleman from Louisiana
 (Mr. Boots).
 As some commentators have already
 noted in the press there are almost as
 many different proposals for reforming
 the electoral college as there are com-
 mentators and critics. My amendment
 obviously does not go as far in the direc-
 tion of reform as many people would like.
 It does not, for example, call for a sys-
 tem of direct election of the President
 and the Vice President. Personally, my
 mind is still open on this issue, but I do
 recognize some of the substantial diffi-
 culties involved in getting such a sweep-
 ing reform adopted. Since the present
 system embodies the same Federal prin-
 ciple on which our Republic was estab-
 lished, therefore favoring to some ex-
 tent  the smaller States, a proposed
 amendment leading to a direct vote
 might incur difficulties in getting the
 necessary three-fourths of the States for
 ratification.
 But whether direct election is or is not
 a desirable objective, the two features to
 which I have referred are so obviously
 bad that their elimination from our elec-
 toral system ought not to hang on the
 desirability of some of further and more
 controversial forms.
 As we have just realized in the recent
 1968  election,  the  provision  which
 throws the election of a President into
 the House of Representatives in the ab-
 sence of a majority of the electoral vote
 would have grave and damaging effects
 in today's world that were never even
 dreamed of by the Founding Fathers. At
 the very least it would leave the question
 of the leadership of our country at a time
 of critical international activity in doubt
 for much too long a period of time. More-
 over the voting system provided in the
 House  under   these   circumstances,
 whereby each State no matter how small
 or large receives only one vote, is just
 too undemocratic and outmoded for to-
 day's world.
 The other glaring deficiency that must
 also be eliminated without further delay
 is the absence in the Constitution of any
 requirement that an individual elector
 must cast his vote for the person for
 whom he was designated as an elector.
 Only the other day in this Chamber we
 have seen once again that the Constitu-
 tion is powerless to prevent an elector,
 chosen by the people of his State to cast
 his vote for one individual, casting it in-
 stead for another. If this could happen
 in the case of Dr. Bailey, of North Caro-
 lina, in 1968, it can happen in the case of
 other electors in future elections. In fact,
 if the electoral result should be especially
 close the acts of "faithless electors" like
 Dr. Bailey could alter the entire outcome
 of a presidential election, contrary to the
 wishes of the people themselves.
 If we can agree on further reforms,
 well and good; but the removal of the
 most objectionable and hazardous as-
 pects of the present system ought not to
 have to wait on agreement on more con-
 troversial reforms.
 My proposed amendment would do the
 following:
 First, abolish the electoral college as
 a group of individuals but retain the
 principle of .each State's electoral vote,
 as at present, equal to the number of
 that State's Representatives and Sen-
 ators;
 Second, automatically count all of a
 State's electoral votes for the candidate
 who receives a plurality of that State's
 popular vote;
 Third, provide for the election of the
 presidential and vice-presidential ticket
 which receives a plurality of at least 40
 percent of the total electoral vote, in
 place of the present provision that a com-
 bined ticket must get a majority of the
 electoral vote; and
 Fourth, provide for a quick run-off na-
 tionwide election between the two presi-
 dential tickets with the greatest number
 of electoral. votes if no ticket receives at
 least 40 percent of the total electoral
 vote.
 Mr. Speaker, I urge the prompt adop-
 tion of this amendment so we may elim-

 CORRECTION OF ROLLCALL
 Mr. CONTE. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall
 No. 8, on January 3, 1969, a quorum call,
 I am recorded as absent. I was present
 and answered to my name.
 I ask unanimous consent that the

 A BEAUTIFUL AND EXCITING
 MUSICAL EXPERIENCE
 (Mr. MAYNE asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. MAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to
 call the attention of the House to the
 fact that Washingtonians will have a
 rare opportunity to share a beautiful and
 exciting musical experience this week.
 The celebrated Iowa String Quartet will
 be performing tonight, Thursday, Janu-
 ary 9, at the Corcoran Gallery, and Sun-
 day, January 2, at the Phillips Collection.
 The Iowa String Quartet, which is the
 resident quartet at the University of Iowa
 in Iowa City, has gained international
 recognition as one of this country's most
 outstanding musical groups, performing
 in many cities throughout this Nation
 and in Europe. The quartet completed a
 tour of major European cities in Febru-

 Department  and  is planning  another
 State Department tour in the spring of
 1970.
 As is their custom the members of the
 quartet will be performing on the famous
 Stradivarius instruments owned by the
 Corcoran Gallery which are on perma-
 nent loan to the quartet. Known as the
 Paganini Strads, they were owned and
 used by the great Italian virtuoso, Nicola
 Paganini, in the 19th century. Iowans
 are justifiably proud that the Corcoran
 has honored the quartet and recognized
 its artistic merit by making these prized
 instruments available to the quartet on
 a permanent loan basis.
 All members of the quartet-Allen
 Ohmes, John Ferrell, William Preucil,
 and Charles Wendt-are on the faculty
 of the music department of the Univer-
 sity of Iowa. The membership of the
 quartet has varied since it was first or-
 ganized. Perhaps the most renowned
 member has been Charles Treger, who
 went on to become the first American to
 win first place in the Wieniawsky violin
 competition held in Poznan, Poland, in
 1962. Mr. Tieger is still a member of
 the Iowa faculty. He and the present
 members of the quartet are typical of the
 vigorous artistic and cultural activity
 now flourishing in the State of Iowa.

 GUARANTEEING FEDERAL EMPLOY-
 EES THE RIGHT TO JOIN OR RE-
 FRAIN FROM JOINING A GOVERN-
 MENT EMPLOYEES UNION
 (Mr. BLACKBURN asked and was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute and to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the
 right of Federal employees to choose or
 not to choose to join a union, as outlined
 in President Kennedy's Executive Order
 No. 10988 of 1982, is too valuable to be
 subject to the whims of whomever might
 occupy the White House.
 Therefore, today I am reintroducing
 the Federal Employee Freedom of Choice
 Act of 1969. Basically, this measure guar-
 antees that all Federal employees will
 have the right to join or the right to
 refrain from joining a Government em-
 ployee's union. The following. Members
 have graciously agreed to cosponsor this
 measure with me: The Honorable GEORGE
 Buses, the Honorable WILLIAM L. SCOTT,
 the Honorable JOHN N. ERLENBORN, the
 Honorable JOHN RHODES, the Honorable
 EDWARD  J.  DERWINSKI,  the Honorable
 LARRY WINN, JR., the Honorable DuR-
 WARD  G. HALL, the Honorable O. C.
 FISHER, the Honorable CHESTER MIZE, the
 Honorable JAMES B. UTT, the Honorable
 LAWRENCE BURTON, the Honorable W. E.
 BROCK,  and the Honorable ROBERT V.
 DENNEY. During 1968 this measure re-
 ceived favorable editorial comment from
 over 40 different newspapers throughout
 the United States.
 I believe that it is the right of every
 person to join or to refrain from joining
 a union. Furthermore, I feel that it is a
 violation of the basic liberties of our cit-
 izens to allow the deletion of this vital
 right to refrain.
 At this time, I sincerely urge the Com-
 mittee on the Post Office and Civil Serv-
 A HEARTY WELCOME TO OUR LAT-
 EST SPACE ASTRONAUTS
 (Mr. BUSH asked and was given
 permission to address the :House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, it is with ex-
 treme pleasure that I join With the rest
 of the Congress in welcoming Col. Frank
 Borman, Capt. James Lovell, and Maj.
 William Anders to this joint session.
 Their achievement is  a magnificent
 one-not only for them, but also for the
 people of the National Aeronautics and
 Space Administration, who, have put in
 so many long hours of hard work on
 this flight.
 The  voyage  magnificently  put  our
 world in perspective. When we look at
 those beautiful pictures of this earth
 taken from the moon orbit, one cannot
 help but be impressed by the beauty of
 it. I hope that as we continue to reach
 these fantastic heights in space we will
 all look back at the "good earth" and
 realize that somehow we must and we
 can achieve a means of living together
 peacefully.
 In one flight the United States became
 the unchallenged leader of the world in
 science and technology. Frankly, I have
 never felt that we had lost this leader-
 ship, but the moon orbit dramatized to
 the rest of the world the magnitude of
 the U.S. effort and our ability-in an
 open society-to develop our technology.
 I am especially proud that the Manned
 Spacecraft Center is located in Houston
 and that I have been able to get to know
 each of these fine men pe$sonally. It is
 with the utmost respect and esteem for
 their outstanding accomplishments-as
 astronauts and as human' beings-that
 I welcome Colonel Borman, Captain
 Lovell, and Major Anders' to this body
 today. It is only fitting and proper to
 award these astronauts the recognition
 they have so gallantly and,' courageously
 earned.
 APOLLO 8 AMONG OTHER ACCOM-
 PLISHMENTS OF THE, MILITARY-
 INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX
 (Mr. TALCOTT asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. TALCOTT. Mr. Speaker, we in the
 Congress,  and  Americans  everywhere,
 proudly salute the three Apollo 8 astro-
 nauts. It is quite appropriate that we
 should.
 Exceeding and leaving the earth's
 gravitational force, circling the moon
 and returning to the earth safely and
 precisely, is probably the greatest human
 feat in history. No other accomplishment
 compares. Other feats will overshadow
 this, but for now the genius, foresight,
 daring, and skill of the Apollo 8 team
 is unexcelled.
 I, too, join the salute and convey my
 highest commendation and appreciation.
 While we bask in their achievement,
 we ought to keep some perspective.
 I have noticed that some Members
 who are cheering the loudest and who
 are most anxious to share the spotlight
 with these present day heroes, were only
 recently disparaging and condemning
 the so-called military-industrial complex
 as something heinous, pervasive, and evil.
 It should be remembered that these
 three  astronauts-great  heroes-are
 members of the military and that the
 whole Apollo 8 achievement is due almost
 wholly to the military-industrial com-
 plex of the United States of America.
 I, too, hold that we ought to be
 cautious  about permitting  too much
 power in any complex--military-indus-
 trial, media, governmental, union; but
 let us give proper credit where proper
 credit is due. Today our military-in-
 dustrial complex is entitled to the credit
 for Apollo 8.
 No military-industrial complex of any
 other nation has equaled its achieve-
 ments. No other complex or association
 has equaled this achievement of our
 military-industrial complex.
 When we next criticize the military-
 industrial complex-and we should-we
 should also remember Apollo 8 among
 its many other accomplishments.
 ORDERLY TEXTILE TRADE
 (Mr. MIZELL asked and was given per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr.  MIZELL. Mr. Speaker,  I  am
 pleased to join with several of my col-
 leagues who have introduced into the
 Congress bills to provide for orderly trade
 in textile articles, a measure which re-
 ceived considerable attention in the pre-
 vious Congress.
 The problem of ever-increasing textile
 imports is fully recognized by those of us
 here who represent Districts in which
 the textile industry plays a vital role
 in the local economy. It is my intention
 to supply ways and means of protecting
 the livelihood of these textile workers
 as much as possible by supporting our
 President-elect in his effort to provide
 reasonable restraints on US textile im-
 ports. The alarming -ate at which these
 imports have increased during the last
 few years make it imperative  that
 restrictive steps be taken at the earliest
 possible time before we reach a point of
 "no-return" and sheer self-destruction.
 In my district-the Fifth District of
 North Carolina-the manufacture  of
 textiles provides one of the major sources
 of family income, and only by placing
 restrictions on imports can we hope to
 hold on to these jobs. Further, any chance
 of expanding our textile plants lies com-
 pletely in the hands of the Congress in
 its handling of this proposal. Frankly, I
 feel that these U.S. 'workers are entitled
 to the protection this legislation would
 afford them for the preservation of their
 jobs, their homes and the future of their
 families. Otherwise, U.S. industry will be
 forced to seek sites abroad for their
 operations to meet the challenge posed
 by foreign imports.
 Mr. Speaker, I feel very deeply about
 the ramifications of a continuing liberal
 import program, and urgently request
 that my colleagues study the proposal I

 Concurrent resolution proposing a multilat-
 eral treaty to bar all military installations
 from the seabed
 Whereas the United States has previously
 entered into treaties providing for the de-
 militarization, of outer space, including the
 moon and  other celestrial  bodies,  and of
 Antarctica; and
 Whereas the seabed should be kept free of
 military installations of all kinds so as to
 eliminate a  source  of  potential   conflict
 among the nations of the world: Now, there-
 fore, be it
 Resolved by the House of Representatives
 (the Senate concurring), That the United
 States should actively seek to conclude a
 multilateral treaty, along the lines of those
 which govern activities in outer space and in
 Antarctica, which would bar all types of mili-
 tary installations from the seabed and would
 make appropriate provision for inspection to
 insure gompliance,
 and fight desperately to keep cheap for-
 eign oil out of this country because it
 would lower prices slightly to scores of
 millions of gasoline and oil consumers.
 Bulging with profits and swollen with
 privilege, they come to Capitol Hill, con-
 fident of their power and contemptuous
 of the vast majority of our American
 people.
 As every man and woman in this coun-
 try digs deep, deeper, deepest, for their
 taxes this year, I pray they will examine
 our American oil industry. It is 4-national
 scandal and outrage to_ allow this un-
 believable  situation to  continue  un-
 checked.
 We are even now engaged in a search
 for tax reform. Let us be blunt, spelling

 to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. WAGGONNER. Mr. Speaker, if
 the news item I am inserting here in the
 lic. I was much moved by their reason-
 ing. Reading their comments, I panted
 under the effect of their eloquence. Never
 was a more ignoble cause defended so
 ably. Unfortunately, their arguments are
 mere sleight of mouth. They plead pov-
 erty. They plead high operating costs. I
 would sooner believe that a barracuda is
 a vegetarian. I would sooner believe in
 perpetual motion or squaring the circle
 then accept their futile testimony.
 It is almost tax time, and scores of mil-
 lions of citizens are beginning to grope
 for cash to pay Uncle Sam. Let every
 single one of them take a close look at
 the American oil industry. See it for
 what it really is-a fourth level of gov-
 ernment. A prime cause of inflation. A
 major reason why millions pay stagger-
 ing taxes.
 As taxpayers painfully look at their tax
 writeoffs, let them note the 271/2-percent
 tax-free allowance given the oil industry
 annually to cover depletion of wells they
 drill and operate. Let them see a statu-
 tory provision enabling oil well drillers
 to deduct, in 1 year, most capital costs
 of their drilling that are spread out over
 a period of years in other industries.
 Let them see how oil companies are
 allowed to deduct from taxes, as a credit,
 payments of royalties to foreign gov-
 ernments. Such business expenses in
 most industries are simply deductions
 from income, taken before taxes are
 computed.
 Let lower and middle income taxpayers
 take a searching look at tax rates paid
 by these companies, as they pollute our
 environment, raise gasoline prices at will,

 ALL IS "RACIST" TO BLACKS: HA   SSMENT JARS
 LIBERAL   I~f
 (By Rasa Gustaatis)
 SAN  FRANCISCO,                                           Feb wary  24.-As  Prof.
 John H. Bunzel faced his class for the first
 time in the semester at San Francisco State
 College, he knew he was in for trouble.
 In the unusually large group before him
 he saw a sizable number of black militants-
 to whom, he knew, he symbolized the enemy.
 For months now-ever since he had pub-
 lished an article critical of the black studies
 program as proposed by Associate Professor
 Nathan Hare-Bunzel had been a target of
 abuse and intimidation.
 He had received anonymous threatening
 telephone calls at home and became accus-
 tomed to being called "pig Bunzel." His two
 cars were covered with the words "Fascist
 Scab"  one  night  and  all  the  tires  were
 slashed. A homemade bomb was found one
 morning outside the office of the political
 science department, which he heads.
 Nevertheless, Bunzel, 45, tall and tweedy,
 looked at the group before him calmly and
 began to explain what he had in mind for
 the course.
 FLOOD OF HOSTILITY
 His voice was drowned in a flood of hostile
 questions and remarks. Someone stood up
 and began to read aloud from "Quotations
 from Chairman Mao Tse-tung." Bunzel tried
 for  ten                              minutes  to  restore  order,  then,
 stunned, he dismissed the class.
 Two days later, on Wednesday, he tried
 again. The class now had become, for him,
 a testing ground of "whether those of us
 committed to the use of reason can still have
 his voice heard in an increasingly irrational
 environment."
 He tried to respond to the hostile questions.
 The course, he said, was titled "community
 power  and  the politics  of leadership."  It
 would not deal with today's headlines (here
 a girl's hand shot up) but would follow an
 academic form and would prove the com-
 plexities of community, he said. Then he
 gestured to the girl.
 "Some of the things you say we don't
 understand," she told him. "I'm asking you
 to come down to our level. And when we raise
 our hands, you should respond immediately.
 It took you about four'mintues to respond."
 "If it's all right, I'd prefer to. finish a
 thought, then answer questions," Bunzel
 replied.
 "Man, what you're saying doesn't mean
 anything anyway," a black student shouted.
 Others joined in a cacophony.
 "I can't hear your questions," Bunzel told
 the class.
 "Man, you haven't been hearing all your
 life," a student said.
 TWO MILLION OMITTED
 The  black  students demanded to  know
 why no readings from Stokely Carmichael
 or Huey P. Newton were assigned. Bunzel
 replied that some two million other choices
 had been omitted.
 The books on the list, the students charged,
 were racist.
 C. Wright Mills and Talcott Parsons ra-
 cists? By what standards? Bunzel asked. Had
 anyone read them?
 "If you put it on the list, nine times out
 of ten it's a racist book," a voice replied.
 At the end of half an hour, Bunzel dis-
 missed the class, telling the students:  "I
 intend to teach this course as it has always
 been taught."
 "If we have to bring guns in here you
 won't teach it," a youth replied. "We'll teach
 you about community power."
 On Friday, Bunzel again pleaded with the
 students to be allowed to begin. When the
 heckling continued, an administrative offi-
 cial was called and ordered two of the Negro
 students  suspended.  The  class  was  again
 dismissed, with the first lecture still to be
 given.
 INTIMIDATION CHARGED
 At a press conference later, Black Student
 Union members declared that "black stu-
 dents were harassed, intimidated and sus-
 pended" in Bunzel's class that morning.
 Tony Miranda, a leader in the Third World
 Liberation Front, said the militants  were
 determined to "stop the functioning of the
 class and educate people on what the class
 is about. Any class he'll be teaching will

 have his attitudes and perceptions of our
 society and that is busting the people. We're
 saying he's in direct opposition to our strug-
 gle at this point. And as such he's an enemy."
 Bunzel, a cool, calm scholar, is somewhat
 puzzled by the vehemence of the attacks
 against him, for he prides himself on his
 long liberal record-the fight he led for ad-
 mission of Negroes into clubs at Prince-
 ton in the 1940s, his outspokenness against
 Sen. McCarthy and against the California
 loyalty oath in the 1950s, his support for a
 black studies program at San Francisco State
 College as long as four years ago.
 He became a special target of the militant
 students last October, when he published
 that article in the quarterly,   The Public
 Interest." In it, he questioned whether the
 black studies program being drawn- up for
 the College by Nathan Hare would allow for
 enough diversity in points of view on racia'
 questions.
 "It was a cautious piece, hardly some-
 thing to provoke a kamikaze attack," he
 said.
 Yet it is exactly that caution which angers
 the militants. For Bunzel, with his care-
 ful weighing of all sides of the question, rep-
 resents to them a liberal enemy-the man
 in the middle who fails to take sides clearly
 and so blocks the revolution.
 He not only questions their black student
 studies program but also has failed to sup-
 port the American Federation of Teachers'
 strike, explaining that he believes "it is the
 wrong strike at the wrong time, and be-
 sides, I'm not completely persuaded that
 the industrial trade union model is ap-
 propriate to the academic community."
 WORSE THAN WALLACE?
 "He's much more a dangerous thing than
 a man like George Wallace," a BSU mem-
 ber told me.  With Wallace, everyone knows
 where he stands. But when Bunzel says some-
 thing people say, yeah, he's a liberal so that
 must be right."
 But to Bunzel, the right to say or write
 what he believes and to teach the class as
 he wants to is "the irreducible minimum
 of academic freedom."
 "I Will not be intimidated but I will not
 be afraid to acknowledge that sometimes
 I'm scared," he told me. "I've had police pro-
 tection at home now for four months and
 that's a lousy w &y to live."

 FASCELL                                  INTRODUCES:. BILL  TO
 ALLEVIATE INEQUITIES IN FED-
 ERAL  EMPLOYEES'                                  COMPENSA-
 TION ACT
 (Mr. FASCEI L asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr.'FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, I intro-
 duce today legislation to correct a Gov-
 ernment practice which affects only a few
 people but is of extreme importance to
 those few who are involved.
 I refer to the policy of cutting off a
 Federal employee's pay as soon as he
 files a compensation claim for injury
 suffered on the job. In many cases the
 paperwork delay in processing a justifi-
 able claim amounts to weeks or months.
 Meanwhile, the injured employee is ex-
 pected to meet all of his continuing ex-
 penses-which may include supporting a
 family of many children-without any
 income.
 Clearly this is an unfair and inequi-
 table situation, since the employee is in-
 jured through no fault of his own. Ile
 was carrying out his official Government
 duties when injured, and therefore the
 Government has an obligation to provide
 for his support until he is able to work
 again.
 Under present practices, the Govern-
 ment's obligation to such employees is
 not being met. Rather, the faithful em-
 ployee's urgent need d  Ing the critical
 period of his on-the-jobinjury is ignored
 as the Government slov?ly processes his
 justifiable request for compensation. We
 cannot allow this treatment to continue.
 My legislation would allow Federal
 employees injured on th job to continue
 to receive their regular pay until there
 is a decision and compensation payments
 may begin. I think it is only fair that we
 enact this system so that an injury on
 the job will not result In an automatic
 lengthy cutoff of all income.
 My bill would amend the Federal Em-
 ployees' Compensation At to accomplish
 this goal. It provides safeguards so that
 any differences or discrepancies would be
 adjusted by withholding portions of the
 compensation paymen   in a manner
 that will be equitable  o the employee
 and the Government.
 My bill also makes another amendment
 of the Compensation Act, to provide that
 employees who are on the compensation
 rolls will continue to ern annual and
 sick leave.
 Under existing law, ajn employee re-
 ceiving compensation payments because
 of duty-incurred injuriejs is deprived of
 the right to earn annual 'or sick leave for
 those periods which exceed 80 hours of
 leave without pay.
 This practice is just the opposite when
 the employee is on annual or sick leave.
 When an employee is avay from his job
 on such leave, he is earning more leave
 credits.
 I fail to see why a diffgrent rule should
 apply to those who have; been injured on
 the job. Consequently, I seek to amend
 the law to provide equal treatment for
 those who are injured.
 I have introduced this legislation for
 the past several Congre4ses, but to date
 it has not become law. This session, I
 hope we can enact these) needed reforms
 which will help produce! equitable treat-
 ment for our injured Federal employees.

 Mr. REES. Mr. Spea er, on April 4
 of this year, President Nixon may be
 forced to commit our  .atin American
 policy to a course that w~luld irreparably
 damage future U.S. rel tions with that
 region. I refer to the Ap it dealline upon
 which, under the statu ry sanctions of
 the Hickenlooper ameddlnent to the
 Foreign Assistance Act,  e U.S. Govern-
 ment must suspend all assistance to the
 Government of Peru, if the conflict be-
 tween that Government, and the Inter-
 national Petroleum Co., a subsidiary of
 Standard Oil of New Je'sey, remains in
 stalemate. The IPC     expropriation
 case has made headlines in the United
 States and throughout Latin America,
 and well it should-it is creating perhaps
 the greatest crisis in United States-Latin
 American relations in our time, and the
 manner in which the U.S. Government
 reacts to this incident could propel us
 into a future of total alienation from the
 Southern Hemisphere.
 In my mind, the IPC case points up
 the vital necessity of an immediate re-
 assessment of U.S. policy toward Peru.
 and indeed, all of Latin America, and
 calls for, in particular, a thorough study
 of two aspects of that policy: first, the
 Hickenlooper amendment and it seri-
 ously negative effects on overall U.S. re-
 lations with Latin America; and second,
 the future course of U.S. private invest-
 ment in that region, and U.S. Govern-
 ment policy concerning investment.
 With  regard  to  the  Hickenlooper
 amendment, I seriously question the wis-
 dom of such a statutory prohibition as
 an instrument of our foreign aid policy.
 Its application to the current IPC ex-
 propriation case is a prime opportunity
 to evaluate its validity in our aid policy
 and to determine its effectiveness in pro-
 tecting and encouraging private invest-
 ment in Latin America.
 The confusing and complex issues of
 the IPC case have been aired many times
 in the press, and I will not attempt to ex-
 plain them here. But I feel that the most
 important point, and one which many of
 us have lost sight of in the current hys-
 teria of this confrontation, is that Peru's
 expropriation of the IPC holdings is a
 unique case, and it is regarded as such
 by the Peruvian Government. It is based
 on a recurring dispute between IPC and
 Peru that has persisted for 45 years. Dur-
 ing that time, it has been a constant
 source of resentment on the part of the
 Peruvians against what they believed,
 perhaps unjustly, to be economic ex-
 ploitation of their natural resources by
 U.S. business interests. It is not a pre-
 view of a new anti-American wave surg-
 ing through Latin America and it will
 not result in a massive seizure of U.S.
 business interests in Peru and elsewhere,
 or in a general rejection of U.S. influence
 in the Latin nations unless the United
 States, through acts of sanction and re-
 taliation imposed by the Hickenlooper
 amendment, causes that alienation to
 occur. I cannot emphasize this point too
 strongly-the manner of official U.S. ac-
 tion on this matter is all important-
 we must be willing to show the Peruvians
 and other Latin American nations that
 we are approaching this situation from
 a sound, reasonable policy, and that we
 are actively seeking a just and equita-
 ble negotiated settlement in the interests
 of both sides. The danger is in leaping
 too fast to impose punishment before
 there is a reasonable opportunity to set-
 tle the case by negotiation, and this dan-
 gerous leap is precisely what the United
 States must make if the provisions of
 the Hickenlooper amendment remain in
 force.
 In the view of the current Peruvian
 Government, the expropriation of the
 IPC holdings was a lawful and just act
 to recover Peru's national rights. The act
 represents reparations for what the Gov-

 S. 2739-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF
 DEDUCTIBLE MOVING .EXPENSES
 INCURRED BY AN EMPLOYEE
 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I
 am introducing Senate bill 2739 which
 is designed to allow additional legiti-
 lnate moving expenses to be deducted
 under existing Internal Revenue proce-
 dures. This is a companion bill to one
 recently introduced into the House of
 Representatives.
 We are all aware of the rising costs of
 living facing us, but nowhere is this cost
 more apparent than my home State of
 Alaska. In the past only those costs such
 as travel and household moving have
 been  allowable  deductions.  However
 these comprise only a portion of the ac-
 tual costs involved. Reliable sources fix
 the cost to an average family for moving
 at $3,300. In Alaska the average can go
 as high as $5,000. And yet under exist-
 ing regulations only a portion of this
 amount may be deducted,
 Certainly costs such as temporary
 housing, loss that might incur from a
 broken lease, costs in purchasing a new
 house, and in looking for a new home are
 -all part of moving, and costs we have all
 borne in our previous moves.
 My bill would recognize these costs;
 costs which have long been recognized
 by private industry, and allow reason-
 able and just deductions within the In-
 ternal Revenue Code.
 Homeowners purchasing a home in
 their new place of residency would be al-
 lowed up to $2,500 in additional deduc-
 tions. A renter would be granted up to
 $1,000 in new deductions.
 With the enactment of this bill our
 highly mobile American society will no
 longer be penalized because they have
 found it necessary to move from one area
 to another.
 Mr. President, it is my understanding
 that this amendment will not apply to
 Members of Congress because, technically
 if not otherwise, our principal place of
 residence remains in our State or district,
 notwithstanding our residence in the
 Washington area while Congress is in
 session.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent
 that the text of my bill be printed im-
 mediately following these remarks in the
 RECORD.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
 will be received and appropriately re-
 ferred; and, without objection, the bill
 will be printed in the RECORD.
 The bill (S. 2739) to' expand the defi-
 nition of deductible moving expenses in-
 curred by an employee, introduced by Mr.
 STEVENS, was received, read twice by its
 title, referred to the Committee on Fi-
 nance, and ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 S. 2739
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
 Representatives of the United States of Amer-
 ica in Congress assembled, That paragraph
 (1) of section 217(b)  of the Internal Rev-
 enue Code of 1954 (relating to definition of
 moving expenses) is amended to read as fol-
 lows:
 "(1)  IN     GENERAL.-For  purposes of this
 section, the term 'moving expenses' means
 only the reasonable expenses-
 "(A) of moving household goods and per-
 sonal effects  (including temporary storage
 expenses) from the former residence to the
 new residence;
 "(B)  of traveling  (including meals and
 lodging)  from the former residence to the
 new place of residence;
 "(C)  of traveling  (including meals and
 lodging) by the taxpayer, his spouse, or both
 for the purpose of searching for a new resi-
 dence in the area of the new principal place
 of work when both the old and the new
 principal places of work are located within
 the United States.
 "(D) of meals and lodging of the taxpayer
 and members of his household at the new
 place of residence while occupying temporary
 quarters for a period not exceeding 30 days;
 "(E) incident to the sale or exchange of
 taxpayer's former residence (not including
 expenses of redecorating or other items to
 improve salability) or to the settlement of an
 unexpired lease covering property used by
 the taxpayer as his former residence, and
 "(F) incident to the purchase of a resi-
 dence in the area of the new principal place
 of work.
 If the aggregate of the expenses described
 in subparagraphs  (C),  (D),  (E), and  (F)
 exceed $2,500 in the case of a taxpayer who
 was the owner of his principal place of abode
 at the former residence, subsection (a) shall
 apply only to the first $2,500 of such ex-
 penses, and if the aggregate of such ex-
 penses exceed $1,000 in the case of any other
 taxpayer,  subsection  (a)  shall apply only
 to the first $1,000 of such expenses."
 SEC. 2. The amendments made by this Act
 shall apply to expenses incurred after De-
 cember 31, 1968.
 S. 2742-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 PROVIDING FOR EXPANDED MEM-
 BERSHIP ON NATIONAL SECURI-
 TIES EXCHANGES
 Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. President, I am
 today  introducing  legislation  which
 would open membership on registered
 stock exchanges to all broker-dealers
 who are registered with the Securities
 and Exchange Commission, pursuant to
 section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act
 of 1934.
 Current restrictions imposed by stock
 exchanges on the number of seats avail-
 able to broker-dealers would be abolished
 by this bill. However, it would require
 new exchange members to pay an appro-
 priate share of the value of the ex-
 change's physical facilities and property
 so as not to take from present members,
 without compensation, the value of their
 contributions to those facilities.
 The bill also provides that an exchange
 could limit membership temporarily to
 meet such problems as inadequate trad-
 ing floor facilities. Such temporary limits
 would become effective 60 days after be-
 ing filed with the SEC If the SEC found
 them necessary.
 There are approximately 4,530 broker-
 dealers registered with the Securities and
 Exchange Commission and only 1,366
 seats on the New York Stock Exchange
 with the number of seats and who may
 become a member controlled by the New
 York Stock Exchange with only a limited
 check by the SEC.
 At the present time, the SEC is not
 even sure whether it has the authority to
 require the New York Stock Exchange
 to increase the number of seats or
 change its membership requirements.
 But there are financial institutions
 such as mutual funds, insurance com-
 panies, and pension plans which account
 for half of the volume on the New York
 Stock Exchange and one-fourth of its
 gross commissions. Although many of
 these  institutions  are  registered  as
 broker-dealers with the SEC, they are
 arbitrarily excluded by the New York
 Stock Exchange from membership on the
 grounds that they are not primarily en-
 gaged in the brokerage business.
 These institutions represent many mil-
 lions of shareholders who are thus un-
 able to recoup their brokerage commis-
 sions.  If  exchange - membership  were
 available the institution could execute
 its own transactions and pass on the
 saving to its shareholders.
 The artificial limitation on member-
 ship has increased the price of New York
 Stock Exchange seats to $515,000, thus
 excluding many small brokers from
 membership because of their lack of fi-
 nancial resources.
 The New York Stock Exchange claims
 it is protected in its actions by an im-
 plied antitrust exemption in the Securi-
 ties Exchange Act but the Department of
 Justice, in a brief filed with the SEC
 on January 17, 1969, says such immunity
 is implied "only to the extent necessary
 to make the exchange work and then
 only to the minimum extent necessary."
 The Department of Justice goes on to
 declare that the SEC should take steps
 to require expansion of stock brokerage

 There              are  approximately  4,530  broker-

 Exchange Commission and only 1,366 seats
 (members) of the New York Stock Exchange.
 Of these 1,366 members approximately 600
 deal with the public. The remainder work on
 thefloor of the Exchange either for their own
 accounts, as specialists, or in various other
 non-public functions. The number of seats
 and who may become a member is controlled
 directly by the New York Stock Exchange
 with limited SEC oversight. The SEC is not
 even sure as to whether or not it can require
 the New York Stock Exchange to increase the
 number of seats or change its membership
 requirements.
 Financial  institutions  such  as  mutual
 funds,  insurance  companies        and  pension

 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' HEALTH
 INSURANCE COSTS
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from. New York (Mr. HALPERN)                                      is
 recognized for 5 minutes.
 Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Speaker, I have
 today introduced a bill to require the
 Federal  Government  to  assume,                        in
 stages, the full cost of the health insur-
 ance which since 1960 has been avail-
 able to Federal employees. My bill pro-
 vides that the Governrnents share of
 the cost of health insurance for Federal
 employees shall rise to 50 percent of the
 cost after June 1969, to 75 percent of the
 cost after June 1970, and to the full cost
 after June 1971.
 When health insurance was first made
 available to Federal employees the Fed-
 eral Government paid about two-fifths
 of the cost and the employee paid about
 three-fifths of the cost. However, as
 things have worked out, because of dol-
 lar limits on. the amount the Federal
 Government can pay toward any indi-
 vidual's health insurance, the rising cost
 of health insurance has resulted in em-
 ployees paying an average of over 70 per-
 cent of the cost.
 Progressive employers, all over the
 country,  provide health  insurance  to
 their employees at no cost. In fact, since
 the amounts paid out for employees'
 health insurance is a cost of doing busi-
 ness, and therefore not taxable income,
 one can say that the Federal Govern-
 ment pays a part of the cost of health
 insurance for employees in private in-
 dustry. And, with corporate tax rates
 being what they are, in some cases the
 Government share for private employees
 is more than the Government pays for its
 own employees.
 It is time, Mr. Speaker, for the Fed-
 eral Government to take the same action
 in regard to its employees that progres-
 sive employers everywhere have taken
 with regard to their employees. If we do
 not do something, and do it soon, Fed-
 eral employees will be priced out of the
 health insurance market.
 I would call this body's attention to
 the fact that I am not alone in crying
 out against the unfair treatment Fed-
 eral employees receive in regard to
 health insurance. On the very first day
 of this Congress the honorable gentle-
 man from New Jersey (Mr. DANIELS)-
 who is so knowledgeable about matters
 relating to the retirement and health
 benefits provided Federal employees-in-
 troduced a bill identical to my bill. At
 that time he pointed out the urgent need
 "to relieve employees and annuitants of
 the unfair burden of continuing to as-
 sume the lion's share of constantly spi-
 raling costs."
 Mr. Speaker, I join with the gentle-
 man from New Jersey in urging prompt
 action on this proposal. Health care
 costs continue their rapid rise. As health
 care costs rise, health insurance costs
 must rise. Under the present program,
 employees and annuitants must bear the
 full burden of rising costs. Therefore,
 we must act to relieve them of their dis-
 proportionate burden.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from Ohio (Mr. MINSxALL) is recog-
 nized for 30 minutes.
 [Mr. MINSHALL addressed the House.
 His remarks will appear hereafter in the
 Extensions of Remarks.]
 (Mr. SIKES asked and was given per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include extra-
 neous matter.)

 after in the Extensions of Remarks.]
 AMENDING SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
 ACT
 (Mr. TIERNAN asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. TIERNAN. Mr. Speaker, a genera-
 tion ago, the terms solid waste and lit-
 ter were virtually unknown. Solid waste,
 until recently, was just plain garbage and
 people did not worry so long as it was
 properly disposed of.
 Litter has been around as long as there
 have been people. It is mentioned in the
 histories of early Rome, and Shake-
 speare's father was once fined for lit-
 tering. But it was not considered a prob-
 lem until the advent of the packaging
 revolution and the automobile which
 made people sufficiently mobile to lit-
 ter the entire national landscape.
 Consumers today discard over 5 pounds
 of refuse a day, per capita, and projec-
 tions show this will double by 1975 and
 may triple by 1980. Few people worried
 or spoke about this problem even as late
 as 1960. By 1965, the problem in urban
 areas reached the crisis stage, so that
 the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965 was
 enacted. Action has been faster since
 then, mainly due to the latent nature of
 the problem. Attention thus far has been
 principally focused on municipalities and
 local governments.  Unfortunately,  the
 public's commitment to this problem has
 been inadequate. While we have devel-
 oped elaborate systems of transportation
 organization, and management to bring
 goods to the consumer, we have left the
 major questions of disposal and reuse of
 our wastes unanswered.
 Senator  MUSKIE,  when  introducing
 this bill in the Senate last week, stated:
 In our current view, materials are rela-
 tively cheap. We buy, we use, and we throw
 away.
 Senator MUSKIE referred to the state-
 ment of Austin C. Daley, chief of the di-
 vision of air pollution control of the
 Rhode Island Department of Health,
 given during a hearing before the Sen-
 ate Subcommittee on Air and Water Pol-
 lution at Boston on April 10. Mr. Daley
 stated:
 We are a nation of users, not consumers.
 Mr. Daley, a nationally recognized ex-
 pert in the field of solid wastes manage-
 ment, also pointed out: -
 In our efforts to cope with this problem,
 we must recognize that we can neither cre-
 ate nor destroy matter.
 Mr. Speaker, with this in mind, I am
 today introducing the Resource Recovery
 Act of 1969. This bill would amend and
 strengthen the Solid Waste Disposal Act
 of 1965. It would also extend the pro-
 visions of that act for an additional 4
 years. Two new provisions incorporated
 within this legislation are:
 First, the Secretary of Health, Educa-
 tion, and Welfare is directed to conduct
 studies and report to the President and
 the Congress on economical means of re-
 covering useful materials from solid
 wastes, recommended uses of such ma-
 terials for national and international
 welfare, and the market of such recovery;
 recommended incentive programs-in-
 eluding tax incentives-to assist in solv-
 ing the problems of solid waste disposal;
 and recommended changes in current
 production and packaging practices to
 reduce the amount of solid wastes. The
 Secretary also - would be authorized to
 carry out demonstration projects to test
 and demonstrate the recovery techniques
 developed by these studies.
 Second, the Secretary would be author-
 ized to make grants to any State, munic-
 ipality, or interstate or intermunicipal
 agency for the construction of solid
 waste disposal facilities, with incentives
 for new and improved methods for deal-
 ing with solid wastes.
 The Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965
 was just a beginning. If we are to effec-
 tively manage our refuse, we must first
 effectively utilize our resources. Billions
 of dollars in raw materials are now being
 wasted. We can no longer afford this
 waste. This bill, the Resource Recovery

 S.  1758-INTRODUCTION OF BILL
 NAMING TIC . INTERSTATE SYS-
 TEM AS THE "EISENHOWER IN-
 TERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM"
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, I intro-
 duce, for appropriate reference, a bill to
 designate the Interstate Highway Sys-
 tem of the United States as the Eisen-
 hower Interstate System.
 Dwight David Eisenhower was one of
 America's greatest leaders. He was a
 leader in war. He was a leader in peace.
 A major accomplishment of the Eisen-
 hower administration was the passage of
 the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956
 which created the Interstate Highway
 System. This Is reason enough for nam-
 ing the Interstate System In honor of
 President Eisenhower.
 However, unlike many of his predeces-
 sors in the Office of Presidency, Dwight
 Eisenhower never did represent a district
 or a State before he.became President.
 Instead, he represented all of America.
 He was born in Texas; he grew up in
 Kansas. During his outstanding career,
 he had occasion to live in many parts of
 the Nation. He belonged to no geographic
 area.
 Therefore, it is particularly fitting and
 proper that his memorial should be the
 magnificent Interstate Highway System
 which stretches the length and breadth
 of the United States.
 Mr. President, similar legislation has
 been introduced in the other body, and
 I am honored to introduce this bill in the
 Senate to honor the 34th President of the
 United States.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S. 1758) to designate the In-
 terstate System as the "Eisenhower In-
 terstate Highway System," introduced
 by Mr. HANSEN, was received, read twice
 by its title, and referred to the Commit-
 tee on Public Works.
 S. 1769-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 ALLOWING THE  TREASURY DE-
 PARTMENT TO ISSUE CONSTANT
 PURCHASING POWER BONDS
 Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, I intro-
 duce, for appropriate reference, a bill
 allowing the Treasury to issue constant
 purchasing power bonds, which could
 be purchased by individuals and certain
 institutional groups for retirement pur-
 poses.
 Our senior citizens are" facing a re-
 tirement income crisis unprecedented in
 the history of our country. An increas-
 ing number of retired workers living for
 longer retirement periods are discover-
 ing that inflation relentlessly nibbles
 away at their fixed incomes, until al-
 most one-third of the 20 million Ameri-
 cans who are 65 years of age and over
 find themselves living in poverty. Con-
 scientious, thrifty people who have saved
 throughout their working lives for a re-
 tirement of independence and dignity
 are dismayed by the realization that
 they may just as well have spent their
 income as they earned it because of the
 deterioration of the purchasing power
 of their savings.
 It seems to me that the Federal Gov-
 ernment has a responsibility to retirees
 who have productively contributed to
 the, growth of our economy throughout
 their working lives. I do not believe that
 we should impose the burden of inflation
 on those whose income, with a purchas-
 ing power dependent on a past rather -
 than a current economy, cannot absorb
 the shock of inflation.
 To help solve this monumental prob-
 lem, I recommend the enactment of leg-
 islation allowing the Federal Govern-
 ment to issue a bond that, if held to
 maturity, would be redeemed at face
 value, plus any increase reflected by the
 Consumers Price Index between the
 date of purchase and the date of re-
 demption.  Such  securities  could  be
 bought in amounts not exceeding $10,-
 000 in any 1 year or $60,000 in an indi-
 vidual's lifetime. They would not be
 transferable, would have a 20-year ma-
 turity period, and would have to be held
 to maturity for the cost-of-living ad-
 'justment to apply, unless the holder has
 reached the age of 60, died, or has be-
 come disabled.
 In my judgment, a constant purchas-
 ing power bond. would not only help to
 meet the urgent needs of our senior citi-
 zens, but also contribute to the reduc-
 tion of inflation by drawing millions of
 dollars into savings. It is my hope that
 the Senate will give favorable considera-
 tion to this concept as a means of coping
 with an increasingly serious domestic
 economic problem.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S. 1769) to assist individuals
 to obtain retirement benefits protected
 against increases in the cost of living by
 providing for the issuances by the Treas-
 ury a new series of bonds containing ad-
 justments, under certain conditions, in
 maturity and redemption values to com-
 pensate for increases in the cost of liv-
 ing  which  may  be  purchased  by
 individuals and eligible institutions, in-
 troduced by Mr. CANNON, was received,
 read twice by its title, and referred to

 S. 1770-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 PROPOSING  PAYMENT  OF  CER-
 TAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO RE-
 CRUITMENT  OF  PROSPECTIVE
 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES
 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, I send to
 the desk, for appropriate reference, a
 bill to authorize Federal agencies to pay
 certain expenses related to recruitment
 of prospective Federal employees.
 Under existing law, Federal agencies
 are not permitted to pay any of the ex-
 penses, not even a hamburger, for a
 young man ar woman whom the agency
 wishes to interview for a job. This ob-
 viously puts the burden on the prospec-
 tive employees to pay travel expenses,
 food, and lodging when he comes to
 Washington or some other city to inter-
 view with an agency. When the prospec-
 tive employee is a honor graduate in
 the arts and sciences, whose talents are
 sought after by many employers, the
 Government is at a distinct disadvan-
 tage.
 We now pay salaries which are com-
 parable with private enterprise and we
 have revised some of the methods of
 recruitment to make Federal employ-
 ment more attractive. This legislation is
 another step in the long journey of re-
 cruiting and retaining the best possible
 personnel for the Federal Government.
 I ask unanimous consent that the
 statement of purpose and justification
 by the Civil Service Commission be
 printed in the RECORD at this point.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred;
 -and, without objection, the statement of
 purposes and justification will be printed
 in the RECORD.
 The bill (1770) to amend title 5, United
 States Code, to authorize payment of
 travel expenses of applicants invited by
 an agency to visit it in connection with
 possible employment, introduced by Mr.
 MCGEE, by request, was received, read
 twice by its title, and referred to the
 Committee on Government Operations.
 The material, presented by Mr. McGEE,
 follows:
 STATEMENT  OF  PURPOSE  AND  JUSTIFICATION
 PURPOSE
 To improve the ability of Federal agencies
 to recruit well-qualified persons in shortage
 occupations.

 The need for well-qualified  professional
 and technical employees continues at a high

 level and shows no sign of diminishing. De-
 partment of Labor manpower estimates for
 the economy as a whole predict a 45%
 increase In employment in professional and
 technical occupations during the decade from
 1965-1975. This growth has several major
 causes, including the rapid expansion in re-
 search and development activities, the tre-
 mendously rapid increase in application of
 technological Improvements,  and the  in-
 creasing size and complexity of business or-
 ganizations.
 Current Commission projections of Federal
 manpower requirements indicate that by fis-
 cal year 1971 agency needs for mathemati-
 cians, engineers, scientists and medical per-
 sonnel will Increase by at least 10%. Demand
 for social scientists and technicians will be
 equally high. Despite increased college en-
 rollments, and even with greatly increased
 recruiting efforts, it is quite likely that Fed-
 eral needs for top flight scientific and tech-
 nical personnel will not be fully met.
 To Federal recruiting officials, these fore-
 casts can only mean that competition for
 highly trained and specialized personnel will
 remain very high. Our Federal laboratories
 must have technically trained and highly
 skilled employees if we are to be successful
 in such  critical endeavors as medical re-
 search,                             military  preparedness,  and  space
 activities.
 The Federal Government should be able
 to attract Its fair share of the best talent
 that our colleges and universities are pro-
 ducing. In occupations in which there are
 numerical shortages, there often are even
 more serious shortages of quality. Industry
 makes special efforts to attract the superior
 quality graduate.  The  Government  as an
 employer must do all that it can to attract
 highly talented men and women.
 Authorizing   agencies  to  pay  travel  and
 transportation expenses of new employees
 to the first post of duty (Public Law 86-
 587) was a stride forward In placing the Fed-
 eral Government in a more competitive po-
 sition with industry. However, inability to
 pay interview expenses remains a serious
 obstacle. Therefore, major Federal employers
 of scientists, engineers and other personnel
 in short supply (Departments of Army, Navy,
 Air Force, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce,
 Health,  Education,  and  Welfare,  National
 Aeronautics and Space Administration, Vet-
 erans Administration, and Federal Aviation
 Agency) have recommended that legislation
 be sought to authorize payment for travel
 expenses of  certain  applicants  invited to
 visit the agency to discuss employment.
 Why is this authority needed?
 (1) To more nearly meet competition from
 private industry. Private industry has rec-
 ognized that the kind of equipment a man
 will have to work with, who his co-workers
 will be, and the kind of living conditions
 his family will have can all be important
 factors in selling him on a particular job.
 Twenty-five of twenty-six large AEC con-
 tractors pay the cost of travel to their plants
 or laboratories in connection with recruit-
 ment for important positions. Research and
 development  contractors  for  the  military
 services provide such travel expenses, and
 other private firms advertise that expenses
 of a visit to the company before employment
 will be paid.
 A report of college placement bureaus
 compiled 3 years ago indicated that more
 than 80% of employers who recruit on their
 campuses provide for plant -visits at company
 expense. A 1968 Prentice-Hall survey of 121
 companies found that 87 % of them pay some
 or all of an appflcant's expenses for a plant
 interview. Of these 121 employers, 74% pay
 all   expenses   (including   transportation,
 meals, lodging, and incidentals), 75% pay
 for meals, 76% pay for lodging and 85% pay
 for transportation. A recent CSC study of
 seven large private employers and two large
 public entities revealed that all nine of these
 pay the cost of transportation for plant visits
 in screening candidates for college level en-
 try jobs.
 (2) To acquaint applicants with opportu-
 nities presented by Government employment.
 In addition to-the advantage; of offering the
 rewards of public service-a factor which
 draws more young people to the Federal
 service each year-Government employment
 often provides unique challenges and oppor-
 tunities.
 This is especially true in the scientific and
 engineering fields. These benefits can be
 made so much more apparent in a plant visit
 that they can often more than compensate
 for the slightly lower starting salaries In the
 Federal  Government.  (The  Army Materiel
 Command reports it difference of $2,253 per
 year at GS-5 and $1,000 per year at GS-7
 with the average industrial starting salary
 for Bachelor level technical graduates in the
 1967 fiscal year.)
 (3) To obtain a greater number of highly
 qualified applicants. The demand for tech-
 nical talent is such that the well-qualified
 scientist or engineer often does not have to
 go looking for a job-the job goes looking
 for him. Recruiting such a person often be-
 comes a "selling" job.
 In today's market most scientists and en-
 gineers will not make a decision on their
 professional career without personally visit-
 lug the place of employment.  It is only
 natural to accept an offer ' from industry.
 where the applicant has visited the plant and
 met the officials, in preference to an offer
 from a distant and unknown, Federal labora-
 tory, even though the work, at the Federal
 agency may appear to be more interesting
 and offer more challenge. Federal laboratories,
 equipment, and physical plant often surpass
 the best in private industry, and these things
 can be a powerful inducement for able sci-
 entists and engineers. But this advantage is
 lost unless we are able to bring qualified
 persons In to see them, and In appropriate
 cases to pay their travel expenses.
 Similarly, applicants on civil service lists of
 eligibles who appear to be well-qualified, but
 who are not available for interview, are often
 passed over for persons not as well-qualified,
 but who were interviewed. Federal employers
 also do not want to buy without looking and
 this may result in the Federal Government
 not selecting the best available person.
 It has been the experience of Federal em-
 ployers in recent years that inability to pay
 these expenses is the governing factor in
 numerous declinations of job offers. To cite a
 few examples:
 Navy reported 726 declinations out of the
 945 offers made by 5 of their biggest labs.
 Without exception, the labs specified nonpay-
 ment of preemployment interview expenses
 as a primary reason for these declinations.
 The  Army  Materiel  Command  reported
 that 32% of all those inexperienced scien-
 tists and engineers declining job offers listed
 the lack of opportunity to visit the work site
 at government expense as their main reason
 for declination.
 One Air Force installation reported losing
 an average of 25 qualified research people
 per year to industry because of the inability
 to pay expenses for a plant interview.
 All  Naval  recruiting  activities-65  in
 total-mentioned  inability  to pay preem-
 ployment interview expenses as a major rea-
 son for declinations by qualified applicants
 in shortage categories.
 74% of all Army Materiel Command appli-
 cants declining offers reported that they had
 visited  the organization whose offer they
 subsequently accepted. Moreover, respond-
 ents visited an average of, five companies
 each at company expense.
 These illustrations are indicative of the
 need for authority to pay preemployment in-
 terview expenses. Total figures would un-
 ,-1 9 69
 doubtedly be much higher. We can only con-
 clude from such examples that-the Federal
 Government has lost opportunities to obtain
 professional talent of high quality by in-
 ability to pay interview expenses.
 (4)  To place the right man in the right
 position. This is particularly important for
 the higher-grade, specialized, research posi-
 tions, and is critical in the selection of a
 scientist to be it member of a research team
 where the ability to func!ion in the particu-
 lar working environment. is extremely im-
 portant.  Such  interviews  enable  a  larger
 group to talk to the candidates and thereby
 provide a broader base for evaluating per-
 sonal  qualifications.  Multiple  evaluations
 may also result in consideration for alterna-
 tive positions at the installation.
 (5) To eliminate misconceptions which
 we know exist in the minds of some appli-
 cants concerning Federal employment in gen-
 eral or employment at particular locations.
 (6) To keep turnover at a minimum, par-
 ticularly at isolated locations. Despite agency
 efforts to give prospective employees com-
 plete  and  factual  information  about  the
 working and living conditions at isolated
 installations,  employees  sometimes resign
 shortly after reporting for duty. This is very
 costly. Personal interviews at the work site
 will tend to uncover these sources of po-
 tential   dissatisfaction                                                                                                                                            before   the ap-
 pointment is made.
 What are Federal agencies doing in the ab-
 sence of authority to pay for interview
 expenses?
 Federal recruiters, when visiting colleges
 and through telephone calls and correspond-
 ence, make every reasonable effort to en-
 courage prospects to visit the work site at
 their own expense. The distance involved is
 an important factor in these efforts. Results
 are often disappointing.
 One Naval activity repo; ts: "We have in our
 files dozens of letters from applicants who
 have naively requested to visit the laboratory
 at Government expense. They assume that
 this is standard practice. as it is in industry.
 When we disillusioned them, their candiday,
 with rare exception, came to an abrupt end."
 In the absence of au ihority to pay ex-
 penses for preemployment interviews, some
 agencies now conduct essential Interviews
 near the applicant's home. Interviews are
 conducted by agency officials who may be
 traveling in the area for other purposes or
 who may be making the trip for the sole pur-
 pose of conducting the Interviews. "Courtesy"
 Interviews  are  conducted by officials of a
 nearby installation of the same agency as
 the  prospective  employer.  However,  both
 kinds of interviews have serious disadvan-
 tages. In addition to the absence of personal
 contact between employer and applicant:
 (1) "Courtesy" interviews are usually not
 familiar with actual working and living con-
 ditions at the recruiting installation;
 (2) Selecting officials are reluctant to de-
 pend on the judgment of a disinterested third
 party, particularly for high-level specialized
 positions;
 (3) There is no opportunity to make mul-
 tiple evaluations of a candidate;
 (4)  Time delays and  some expense  are
 encountered in arranging with third parties
 to conduct interviews and to furnish results
 to recruiting installations.;
 (5) There are travel costs for interviewing
 officials;
 (6) In research organizations it is particu-
 larly desirable that interviews be conducted
 by key staff members who have a thorough
 knowledge of the research programs and can
 discuss them in terms of the technical knowl-
 edge of the candidates. When these key of-
 ficials must travel extensively to conduct in-
 terviews, much of their time used for this
 purpose could otherwise have been profitably
 devoted to program duties at the work site.

 ;What has been the experience of Federal
 J  a eneies now authorized to pay these ex-
 penses~
 Federal a encies are authorized to pay pre-
 employmen  interview expenses When con-
 elderingAc iibidates for employment to posi-
 tions gxcepted from the competitive civil
 service. The Comptroller General has ruled
 that in filling excepted positions, where the
 responsibility for determining the qualifica-
 tions of applicants is vested in the agencies,
 the payment by them of any necessary ex-
 penses incident to  the determination is
 proper if funds otherwise are available there-
 Reports'from the principal excepted agen-
 cies authorized paid preemployment travel
 show that this right has been used carefully
 and conservatively. No complaints of abuse
 have been made to the General Accounting
 Office.
 Tennessee Valley Authority-All positions
 in TVA are in the excepted service. TVA pol-
 icy is that payment for interview expenses
 may be authorized when deemed by the di-
 vision incurring the expense to be neces-
 sary in the conduct of official business. Ex-
 perience of TVA has disclosed no applicant
 abuse of the authorization to pay such ex-
 penses. In FY 1967, TVA hired 175 employees
 in shortage categories and authorized pre-
 employment travel for 58 applicants.
 Atomic Energy Commission-All positions
 in AEC are in the excepted service. AEC re-
 ports that the authority to pay these expenses
 has been used sparingly, but its use has been
 found necessary in the current competitive
 market for "quality" candidates. Invitational
 travel is not considered an additional cost.
 In most instances, in lieu thereof, AEC would
 have to'%6nd a representative to interview
 the candidate to accomplish an adequate
 evaluation  of his qualifications. The  cost
 then would include not only travel expenses
 for AEC's representative, but also his salary.
 In FY 1967 AEC hired 277 shortage category
 employees and authorized preemployment in-
 terview expenses for 85 applicants.
 ' AEC is not aware of any abuse on the part
 of candidates, such as travel for their own
 pleasure or convenience. Candidates who have
 accepted  invitational  travel  for  interview
 have usually accepted offers of employment.
 Veterans Administration-Physicians, Den-
 tists, and nurses in the Department of Medi-
 cine an                   Surgery are in the excepted service.

 In evaluating agency requests the Com-
 mission  independently  examines  existing
 registers to see how many- qualified people
 are actually available, and how well quali-'
 fled they are. As circumstances require, other
 pertinent sources of information are checked
 such as the U.S. Employment Service and
 the latest literature on the subject.
 Funds to pay travel costs authorized by
 the draft bill would be secured by individ-
 ual  agencies  through  their  appropriation
 requests to the Congress. Necessity for justi-
 fying funds to  be used for      this purpose
 and the generally limited amounts of agen-
 cy travel funds in relation to travel needs
 will assure that individual agencies admin-
 ister these provisions in the best interests
 of the agency and the Federal Service. The
 requirement that applicants must first be
 found qualified by a civil service examining
 office is added assurance that these inter-
 views would come at a point just short of
 actual employment in the competitive serv-
 ice.
 Students often express an interest in the
 Federal  service  some  months  before  they
 are scheduled to complete their education.
 The proposed legislation has been drafted
 so  as not to preclude from coverage this
 very   important  group of  applicants  who
 are considered "tentatively qualified." This
 means they have taken and passed any re-
 quired test and have been rated qualified
 by an examining office. To be fully quali-
 fied they only need to finish the last few
 weeks of their education and receive their
 degree.
 These  applicants,  still  in  school,  but
 gards it as an important recruiting factor in           prise one of the Government's most lm-
 the cases where it is needed. In FY 1967, VA                            portent recruitment sources  for   engineer
 only used its authority to pay expenses for             and scientific positions. Because of the in-

 Decreases in turnover (especially at iso-
 lated locations) because applicants will have
 a clearer view of actual living and working
 conditions and can better decide whether or
 not they wish to accept the job offered.
 Greater benefits from the funds already
 spent on recruiting because many applicants,
 who now go through the initial interview
 stage but drop out when they find no oppor-
 tunity to visit the work site at Government
 expense, will go on to probable employment.
 The present experience of the excepted
 agencies, TVA, AEC, and VA show their ex-
 penses to be under our estimate of about $155
 per trip. The average cost reported for each
 preemployment interview traveler was  for
 AEC  $117.87, for TVA $67.81, and for VA
 $133.13. Therefore we feel our estimate is a
 generous one.
 It is expected that costs would be absorbed
 in the regular travel budgets of the agen-
 cies concerned, and that no special appropri-
 ation would be needed.
 The agency's ability to reimburse an ap-
 plicant for his interview expenses might well
 tip the scale in favor of his accepting a
 "manpower shortage" category position. In
 this event, the money would be well spent.
 S. 1771-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 TO PROVIDE CERTAIN BENEFITS
 TO EMPLOYEES IN THE POSTAL
 FIELD SERVICE
 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, I intro-
 duce, for appropriate reference, a bill to
 amend title 39 of the United States Code
 to provide that the provisions of law
 which permit a "saved pay rate" for cer-
 tain employees who have been reduced
 in grade through no fault of their own
 shall not be limited to just 2 years in
 the case of postal employees in the rail-
 way postal service whose jobs were abol-
 ished because of the discontinuance of
 railway postal service.
 The proposed legislation is vitally im-
 portant to former railway postal clerks
 whose pay rates were preserved for 2
 years, but who now face a serious reduc-
 tion in pay because the benefits of the
 law do not extend past 2 years. My bill,
 which received the very firm support of
 the Postmaster General in 1967, would
 waive the 2-year provision in this specific
 case.
 The committee will schedule early ac-
 tion on this legislation.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S. 1771) to provide benefits
 for employees in the postal field service
 who are required in the interest of the
 Government to transfer to new duty
 stations, was received, read twice by its
 title, and referred to the Committee on
 Post Office and Civil Service.

 TO PROVIDE THAT THE FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT SHALL PAY ONE-

 INSURANCE  FOR FEDERAL EM-
 PLOYEES AND ANNUITANTS
 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, I intro-
 duce, for appropriate reference, a bill to
 amend the Federal Employees Health
 Benefits Act to provide that hereafter
 the Government shall pay one-half of
 the cost of the high option health insur-
 ance plan carried by Federal employees.

 Post Office and Civil Service can sched-
 ule hearings in the very near future to
 covered behave differently than the way
 the committee, the Civil Service Com-
 mission, and even the employees them-
 selves thought they would behave, it is
 fair to say the program should be re-
 examined.
 From June 1960 until November 1964,
 the  Government contribution of $6.76
 per month for self-and-family coverage
 equalled 34.9 percent of the cost of "high
 option," and 47.6 percent of "low option"
 of the Service Benefit plan, When rates
 began to go up annually beginning in
 November 1964, the Government's con-
 tribution of $6.76 dropped from 34.9 per-
 cent to 28.4 percent of total cost through
 June 1966. After a statutory increase in
 the amount of the contribution in July
 1966, the Government's share rose to 37.3
 percent, and then dropped to a 1969 fig-
 ure of 25.2 percent. All of that is under
 the Service Benefit plan, the euphemistic
 title of the Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan.
 I ask unanimous consent to insert in
 the  RECORD  at this point a detailed
 analysis of the rate history of the health
 insurance program prepared by the Civil
 Service Commission which shows the cost
 to both the employee and the Govern-
 ment for high option and low option pro-
 tection from the beginning until the
 present time. This Is an excellent rate
 history of the program.
 There being no objection, the analysis
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 consider this legislation.
 The Federal Employees Health Bene-
 fits Act was a landmark piece of legisla-
 tion when it was enacted in 1959. It pro-
 vided the basic framework for a hospital
 and medical insurance protection pro-
 gram applicable to virtually all Federal
 employees without regard to their eco-
 nomicstatus and without a requirement
 that they pass a physical examination.
 In my opinlon,`it is one of the most suc-
 cessful and certainly one of the best ad-
 ministered programs in the Federal
 Government today. It is a monumental
 achievement for the distinguished mem-
 bers of our Senate Post Office and Civil
 Service Committee who devised the pro-
 gram. Olin Johnston, who guided it
 through the committee and the Senate;
 Bill Langer, who made sure that the
 benefits provided would care for serious
 and lengthy illnesses; Dick Neuberger,
 FRANK  CARLSON, Mike Monroney, and
 RALPH YARBORO'tsIr, all of whom played
 a key part in its development.
 One of the considerations in mind at
 the time the program was developed was
 that rank-arid-file Federal  employees
 cannot afford an expensive health insur-
 ane.  in1m.n   mhr  enmmiftpev                thenrefnre

 most from the beginning, employees
 chose the "high option protection." They
 preferred to pay more in order to get
 more insurance protection. Today, nearly
 90 percent of all employees covered by
 the program choose "high option" re-
 gardless of the carrier they select and
 apparently regardless of the cost. So it
 worked out that the presumption that
 the Government would pay one-half of
 the cost of the insurance provided was
 in error. When almost all employees

 What has been the experience of Federal    The length of time active but unsuccessful
 agencies now authorized to pay these ex-  recruiting has been conducted;
 penses?
 Federal agencies are authorized to pay pre-
 employment interview expenses when con-
 sidering candidates for employment to posi-
 tions excepted from the competitive civil
 service. ,'1'he Comptroller General has ruled
 that in filling excepted positions, where the
 responsibility for determining the qualifica-
 tions of applicants is vested in the agencies,
 the payment by them of any necessary ex-
 penses  incident  to  the  determination  is
 proper if funds otherwise are available there-
 for.
 Reports from the principal excepted agen-
 cies authorized paid preemployment travel
 show that this right has been used carefully
 and conservatively. No complaints of abuse
 have been made to the General Accounting
 Office.
 Tennessee Valley Authority-All positions
 in TVA are in the excepted service. TVA pol-
 icy is that payment for interview expenses
 may be authorized when deemed by the di-
 vision incurring the expense to be neces-
 sary in the conduct of official business. Ex-
 perience of TVA has disclosed no applicant
 abuse of the authorization to pay such ex-
 penses. In FY 1967, TVA'hired 175 employees
 in shortage categories and authorized pre-
 employment travel for 68 applicants.
 Atomic Energy Commission-All positions
 in AEC are in the excepted service. AEC re-
 ports that the authority to pay these expenses
 has been used sparingly, but its use has been
 found necessary in the current competitive
 market for "quality" candidates. Invitational
 travel is not considered an additional cost.
 In most instances, in lieu thereof, AEC would
 have to send a representative to interview
 the candidate to accomplish an adequate
 federal  service some months  before  they

 tists, and nurses in the Department of Medi-
 cine and Surgery are in the excepted service.
 VA uses its authority infrequently, but re-
 gards it as an important recruiting factor in
 the cases where it is needed. In FY 1967, VA
 only used its authority to pay expenses for
 46 applicants but it hired 5,195 employees
 in shortage categories.
 How would the proposed legislation be
 The declinations because of lack of pay-
 ment of travel and transportation funds;
 A statement on the extent and nature of
 recruiting efforts and the results obtained
 from the use of paid and free advertising,
 contacts with schools, contacts with the local
 State Employment Service, etc.;
 The extent to which it has been necessary
 to recruit outside of the area in which the
 vacancy exists;
 Information on internal efforts to relieve
 the shortage such as job engineering and up-
 grading the skills of people already employed;
 The general quality of recruits obtained
 and the prospects for obtaining better ones
 if travel costs are paid.
 In evaluating agency requests the Com-
 mission  independently  examines  existing
 registers to see how many qualified people
 are actually available, and how well quali-
 fled they are. As circumstances require, other
 pertinent sources of information are checked
 such as the U.S. Employment Service and
 the latest literature on the subject.
 Funds to pay travel costs authorized by
 the draft bill would be secured by individ-
 ual  agencies  through  their  appropriation
 requests to the Congress. Necessity for justi-
 fying  funds  tp be  used for    this purpose
 and the generally limited amounts of agen-
 cy travel funds in relation to travel needs
 will assure that individual agencies admin-
 ister these provisions in the best interests
 of the agency and the Federal Service. The
 requirement that applicants must first be
 found qualified by a civil service examining
 ,office is added assurance that these inter-
 views would come at a point just short of
 actual employment in the competitive serv-
 ice.
 Students often express an interest in the
 weeks of their education and receive their
 degree.

 about to begin their working careers, com-
 prise  one of the  Government's  most im-

 and scientific positions. Because of the in-
 tense competition with industry recruiters
 for this particular group of applicants, it
 is essential that Federal  agencies be able
 to extend preemployment interview invita-

 Greater benefits from the funds already
 spent on recruiting because many applicants,
 who now go through the initial interview
 stage but drop out when they find no oppor-
 tunity to visit the work site at Government
 expense, will go on to probable employment.
 The present experience of the excepted
 agencies, TVA, AEC, and VA show their ex-
 penses to be under our estimate of about $155
 per trip. The average cost reported for each
 preemployment interview traveler was  for
 AEC  $117.87, for TVA $67.81, and for VA
 $133.13. Therefore we feel our estimate is a
 generous one.
 -It is expected that costs would be absorbed
 in the regular travel budgets of the agen-
 cies concerned, and that no special appropri-
 ation would be needed.
 The agency's ability to reimburse an ap-
 plicant for his interview expenses might well
 tip the scale in favor of his accepting a
 "manpower shortage" category position. In
 this event, the money would be well spent.
 S. 1771-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 TO PROVIDE CERTAIN BENEFITS
 TO EMPLOYEES IN THE POSTAL
 FIELD SERVICE
 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, I intro-
 duce, for appropriate reference, a bill to
 amend title 39 of the United States Code
 to provide that the provisions of law
 which permit a "saved pay rate" for cer-
 tain employees who have been reduced
 in grade through no fault of their own
 shall not be limited to just 2 years in
 the case of postal employees in the rail-
 way postal service whose jobs were abol-
 ished because of the discontinuance of
 railway postal service.
 The proposed legislation is vitally im-
 portant to former railway postal clerks
 whose pay rates were preserved for 2
 years, but who now face a serious reduc-
 tion in pay because the benefits of the
 law do not extend past 2 years. My bill,
 which received the very firm support of
 the Postmaster General in 1967, would
 waive the 2-year provision in this specific
 case.
 The committee will schedule early ac-
 tion on this legislation.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S. 1771) to provide benefits
 for employees in the postal field service
 who are required in the interest of the
 Government to transfer to new duty
 stations, was received, read twice by its
 title, and referred to the Committee on
 Post Office and Civil Service.

 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, I intro-

 the cost of the high option health insur-
 ance plan carried by Federal employees.

 that they pass a physical examination.
 In my opinion, it is one of the most suc-

 One of the considerations in mind at

 that rank-and-file Federal employees
 cannot afford an expensive health insur-

 the Government would pay one-half of
 the cost of the insurance provided was
 in error. When almost all employees
 covered behave differently than the way
 the committee, the Civil Service Com-
 mission, and even the employees them-
 selves thought they would behave, it is
 fair to say the program should be re-
 examined.
 From June 1960 until November 1964,
 the Government contribution of $6.76
 per month for self-and-family coverage
 equalled 34.9 percent of the cost of "high
 option," and 47.6 percent of "low option"
 of the Service Benefit plan. When rates
 began to go up annually beginning in
 November 1964, the Government's con-
 tribution of $6.76 dropped from 34.9 per-
 cent to 28.4 percent of total cost through
 June 1966. After a statutory increase in
 the amount of the contribution in July
 1966, the Government's share rose to 37.3
 percent, and then dropped to a 1969 fig-
 ure of 25.2 percent. All of that is under
 the Service Benefit plan, the euphemistic
 title of the Blue Cross-Eue Shield plan.
 I ask unanimous consent to insert in
 the RECORD at this point a detailed
 analysis of the rate history of the health
 insurance program prepared by the Civil
 Service Commission which shows the cost
 to both the employee and the Govern-
 ment for high option and low option pro-
 tection from the beginning until the
 present time. This is an excellent rate
 history of the program.
 There being no objection, the analysis
 was ordered to be printed In the RECORD,

 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, there are
 other plans, and the statistical evidence
 on the Government's contribution to
 these have not been gathered, Some of
 the plans offered by Federal employee
 organizations are much broader and cost
 a good deal more than the Blue Cross-
 Blue Shield and Aetna plans. But in all
 cases the Government's contribution is
 exactly the same-$8.88 per month for
 self-and-family protection regardless of
 the plan or option chosen by the em-
 ployee. The annual premium at the pres-
 ent time is more than $675 million for
 the Government-wide ' plans alone. Of
 this amount, the Government pays $180
 million and the employees pay $494 mil-
 lion.
 The bill that I introduce today will
 provide that from now on the agency
 contribution to the cost of health insur-
 ance will be adjusted at the beginning of
 each fiscal year to an amount equal to
 one-half of the cost of the least expen-
 sive Government-wide high-option in-
 surance plan. This is a reasonable limi-
 tation. The budget people could esti-
 mate with some degree of accuracy in
 advance the amount of money necessary
 to pay additional costs arising from more
 expensive hospital and doctor bills. There
 would ' be a ceiling necessarily imposed
 because the Government would not pay
 more than one-half of the cost of either
 Blue Cross-Blue Shield or Aetna, which-
 ever offered the least expensive "high
 option" plan. That dollar amount would
 be the Government's contribution to any
 plans offered locally or by a Federal
 employee organization. This would avoid
 any "blue sky" competition to see who
 could offer the most health insurance.
 We started well ahead of the pack in
 1959 when we created the health insur-
 ance plan. Today we are no longer out
 front. Although the Federal program is
 broad and offers some of the best health
 insurance, plans available, it is not better
 -than some plans in private industry and
 it is substantially more expensive for the
 employees than larger employers in the
 private sector of the economy offer. It is
 time to catch up.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
 ,be , eceived and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S, 1772)? to provide that the
 Federal Government shall pay one-half
 of the cost of health insurance for 1?'ed-
 eral employees and annuitants, intro-
 duced by Mr. MCGEE, (for himself and
 Mr. BURDICK), was received, read twice
 by its title, and referred to the Commit-
 tee on Post Office and Civil Service.
 S.  1773-INTRODUCTION OF FAIR
 SHARE TAX ACT
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, today I in-
 troduce the Fair Share Income Tax Act.
 of 1969. For many years I have been con-
 cerned that our income tax laws placed
 a heavy burden on those of small and
 modest means while at the same time
 providing the more affluent with special
 ways by which they can reduce-even
 esoape-their tax load. These special
 provisions have made a mockery of the
 proposition that most. citizens thought
 had been built into our tax structure,
 namely, that the more you earn the more
 income tax you pay.
 Former Treasury Secretary Joseph W.
 Barr, testifying before the joint Eco-
 nomic Committee earlier this year, made
 an eloquent plea for reforms in our in-
 come tax system when he said:
 Our income tax system needs major re-
 forms now, as a matter of importance and
 urgency. That system essentially depends on
 an  accurate  self-assessment  by taxpayers.
 This, in turn, depends on widespread con-
 fidence that the tax laws and the tax admin-
 istration are equitable, and that everyone is
 Paying according to his ability to pay.
 We face now the possibility of a taxpayer
 revolt if we do not soon make major reforms
 in our income taxes. Revolt will not come
 from the poor but from the tens of millions
 ad' middle-class families and individuals with
 incomes of $7,000 to $20,000, whose tax pay-
 ments now generally are based on the full
 ordinary rates and who pay over half of our
 individual income taxes.
 The middle  classes  are likely to  revolt
 against income taxes not because of the level
 or amount of the taxes they must pay but
 because certain provisions of the tax laws
 unfairly lighten the burdens of others who
 can afford to pay. People are concerned and,
 indeed, angered about the high-income re-
 cipients who pay little or no Federal income
 taxes. For example, the extreme cases are
 155 tax returns in 1967 with adjusted gross
 incomes above $200,000 on which no Federal
 income taxes were paid, including 21 incomes
 above $1 million.
 Secretary Barr spoke with deep con-
 viction founded upon his experience as
 one of the Nation's leading fiscal officers,
 Since the date of his testimony before
 the Joint Economic Committee, Janu-
 ary 17, 1969, we have heard and read
 much on the probabilities of income tax
 reform. A study is now being conducted
 by the House Ways and Means Commit-
 tee  which,  hopefully,  will result in
 meaningful and comprehensive reform.
 We also hear reports that the Nixon ad-
 ministration may  delay  implementing
 any tax reforms until 1971.
 Certainly, there is no doubt that some
 of the areas marked out for reform will
 require additional thorough study to de-
 termine their effect on the Nation's
 economy. However, there are questions
 upon which we can all agree and in which
 reforms should be implemented as soon
 as possible.
 The bill I introduce today, Mr. Presi-
 dent, is, I believe, one of those upon
 which there can be a general agreement.
 What I propose is that we insure that
 those best able to pay income taxes do,
 in fact, pay income taxes. This, as my
 bill details, can be done by the imposi-
 tion of a minimum tax. Stated simply,
 the proposal amends the Internal Reve-
 nue Code to provide new tax tables for
 those who under the existing law, by
 taking advantage of such provisions as
 the allowances for depletion, deprecia-
 tion, and capital gains, have only mini-
 mum tax liability, or no tax liability at
 all. The rates would vary as they do now
 ranging from 7 to 35 percent. In addition,
 there is a provision for a minimum cor-
 porate income tax.
 Mr. President, passage of this bill will
 not remove all the inequities in our pres-
 ent tax structure. It does not affect sev-
 eral defects, the correction of which I
 have supported in the past and will con-
 tinue to support. For instance, it does not
 ease the burden of those with children
 in college, a matter which the distin-
 guished Senator from Connecticut (Mr.
 RisrcoFF) has dealt with in previous
 Congresses, and one on which I expect
 to support him again in the near future.
 It does not increase personal exemptions
 from $600; it does not exclude as gross
 income the first $5,000 of civil service
 retirement; it does not provide head-of-
 household benefits to certain single per-
 sons; it does not modify the oil depletion
 and capital gains allowances-all of
 these changes which I support.

 Passage of my proposal, Mr. President,
 is intended to accomplish one simple re-
 suit: to insure that those with the ability
 to pay would in fact pay their fair. share
 of income taxes. It would be a start to-
 ward improving and perfecting the In-
 come tax structure, one of our country's
 strongest  assets. The other  changes
 which I have cited and which equity re-
 quires should be Incorporated in the
 comprehensive reform being developed
 in the House Ways and Means Committee
 and adopted as promptly as possible.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S. 1773) to amend the Inter-
 nal Revenue Code of 1954 to impose a

 S. 1774-INTRODUCTION OF DESIGN
 PROTECTION ACT OF 1969
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, I introduce,
 for appropriate reference, today the pro-
 posed Design Protection Act of 1969. The
 purpose of the legislation is to provide
 effective protection for original orna-
 mental designs from unauthorized copy-
 Ing.
 The need for the legislation has been
 established  in  hearings  before  the
 Patents Subcommittee of the Commit-
 tee on the Judiciary. The legislation was
 approved by the Senate in previous Con-
 gresses but has been unsuccessful in the
 House of Representatives. In this Con-
 gress a number of bills similar to the one
 I propose have been introduced in the
 House, and it is hoped that they will be
 favorably considered. It is my belief that
 the equity of this proposal will again re-
 sult in favorable action by the Senate.
 S.1776-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A SPE-
 CIAL POSTAGE STAMP IN THE
 HONOR OF THE LATE DR. MAR-
 TIN LUTHER KING, JR.
 Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, I intro-
 duce, for appropriate reference, a bill to
 authorize the issuance of a special pos-
 tage stamp in honor of the life and serv-
 ice of the late Dr. Martin Luther King
 Jr.
 In 1811, Thomas Jefferson said:
 Politics, like religion, hold up the torches
 of martyrdom to the reformers of error.
 In 1964, Martin Luther King said:
 The Negro is willing to risk martyrdom in
 order to move and stir the social conscience
 of his community and the Nation.
 To the shock and sadness of millions,
 Martin Luther King's risk became a re-
 ality on that fateful day a year ago.
 Mr. President, Dr. King died so that
 others of his race might live in free-
 dom.
 To millions of Americans, he was the
 prophet of the Negroes' quest for racial
 equality, their voice of anguish, their
 champion for human dignity.
 While I offer this legislation today to
 memorialize this great civil rights leader,
 the measure of the man and his move-
 ment is already memorialized by the fact
 that his crusade goes on with anew sense  his avem'ge current ear
 of urgency.                               became disabled.
 The VICE PRESIDENT.' The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S. 1776) to provide for the
 issuance of a special postage stamp In
 honor of the late Dr. Martin Luther
 King, Jr., introduced by Mr. GRIFFIN,
 was received, read twice by its title, and
 referred to the Committee On Post Office

 S. 1779-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 FOR RELIEF OF BOGDAN BEREZ-
 NICKI
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, the bill I
 introduce grants authority to the For-
 eign Claims Settlement  ommission to
 reopen the claim of Bogdan Bereznicki
 for compensation for family property
 confiscated in Poland duri g World War
 IT. This legislation is necessary to right
 the wrong he suffered as a result of an
 incorrect ruling by the Immigration and
 Naturalization Service for which there is
 now no administrative remedy.
 Mr. Bereznicki first approached me in
 early May 1967 for help in appealing the
 decision of the Immigration and Natu-
 ralization Service that he, had forfeited
 his citizenship by  s service in the Pol-
 ish Army. On the b  is of 'the Immigra-
 tion Service ruling the Foreign Claims
 Settlement Comm ion was forced to
 deny his claim.
 A series of court} and administrative
 decisions relating to >e supposed forfeit-
 ure of his citizenship ed to a ruling that
 Mr. Bereznicki had, in fact, continuously
 been a citizen from the date of loss as
 required by the Claims commission, but
 by this time the jurisdicn of the Com-
 mission had expired and'''lit was unable
 to consider this new evideri e.
 While the bill does not. presume to
 judge the merits of the claim, it does
 emphasize my conviction that equity re-
 quires that this lifelong citizen have the
 same consideration under the law as had
 other citizens who were unaffected by an
 erroneous decision by their government.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The 'hill will
 be received and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S. 1779) for the relief c}f Bog-
 dan Bereznicki, introduce o by Mr. $riRT,
 was received, read twice by its title and
 referred to the Committee on the Judi-
 ciary.
 S. 1781-INTRODUCTION OF A BILL
 TO ALLOW DISABLED WORKERS
 TO RECEIVE BOTH SOCIAL SECU-
 RITY BENEFITS AND; WQftKMEN'S
 COMPENSATION
 Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, I in-
 troduce, for appropriate reference, a bill
 to repeal section 224 Of the Social Secu-
 rity Act. This legislation' will correct a
 serious  inequity  resulting  from  the
 Social Security Act` by the amendments
 of 1965. Section 2'L4 provides for reduc-
 tion in social security insurance bene-
 fits payable to a disabled worker and
 his family who are receiving workmen's
 compensation. Presently, this restriction
 applies if the total monthly benefits of
 the two programs exceed 80 percent of
 further compounded by its application
 only to those persons who become eligi-
 ble for disability insurance benefits after
 December 31, 1965. It does not apply to
 those who were already receiving these
 benefits.
 As of December 1967, 9,965 disabled
 worker families, involving a total of
 29,796 beneficiaries, were affected by this
 section of the act. The average monthly
 reduction in social security benefits for
 a disabled worke - + i. no dependents
 was $53.57. The reduction for a worker
 with one or more dependents was $158.42.
 In some cases a worker's social security
 benefits have been totally eliminated due
 to receipt of workmen's compensation.
 The total number of persons subjected
 to the workmen's compensation offset
 provision may not be large. However, the
 effect of this reduction of a beneficiary's
 monthly payment is significant.
 It is my belief that this provision
 places an unjust burden upon our work-
 men injured on the job and their fami-
 lies. These workers have encountered a
 serious financial setback by loss of their
 ability tee participate (ally in the em-
 ployment market and, therefore, loss of
 potential income.
 It is possible that in some cases bene-
 ficiaries may receive excessive benefits
 if this section is repealed. But this would
 be preferable to the continuation of a
 policy that results in insufficient pay-
 ments in the majority of. cases.
 Mr. President I am pleased to have
 as cosponsors of this measure the Sena-
 tor from Tennessee  E Mr. BAKER),  the
 Senator from West Virginia (Mr. BYRD),
 the Senator from Montana (Mr. MET-
 CALF), the senior Senator from Pennsyl-
 vania (Mr. SCOTT), and the junior Sena-
 tor from Pennsylvania (Mr. ScHWEIKER).
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred.
 The bill (S. 1781) to amend title II of
 the Social Security Act. to eliminate the
 reduction in disability insurance bene-
 fits which is presently required in the
 case of an individual receiving work-
 men's compensation benefits, introduced
 by Mr. RANDOLPH (for himself and other
 Senators), was received, read twice by
 its title, and referred to the Committee

 mission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the
 United States. A similar measure, Senate
 Joint Resolution 100, passed the Senate
 in the second session of the 90th Con-
 gress, but too late for the other body to
 act.
 The purpose of the Commission envi-
 sioned by Senate Joint Resolution 100
 was to "study, analyze, evaluate, and
 recommend changes to the Bankruptcy
 Approved For Release 2000/09/11 : CIA-RDP71 B00364R000500140002-6
