 TRANSITION IN TIBET*
 Summary
 The Chinese Communist occupation of Tibet has been marked by con-
 siderable Tibetan resistance to the imposition of Communist programs.
 Although a postponement of further "reforms" was announced in Decmber
 1960, changes introduced during the past 3 years have slowly strength-
 ened and consolidated the Chinese position in Tibet.
 The traditional administrative structure of Tibet was abolished in
 early 1960 and was replaced by standard Chinese Communist local govern-
 ment units.  Although effective local government is possible in predom-
 inantly agricultural areas, the sparsely populated nomadic areas of
 northern Tibet present unique problems and have to a large extent re-
 mained outside the pale of Chinese administration and the instituting
 of Communist programs.  The actual functioning of local government
 units in carrying out higher level policy directives has been hindered
 by an insufficient number of trained and reliable Tibetan and Chinese
 cadres.
 The lack of adequate transportation from China to Tibet historically
 has been a major problem in the maintenance of Chinese contraw lti empha-
 sis Road construction has been pushed, particularly since 1959,
 sis upon an improved network in southern Tibet.  In southern and south-
 western Tibet, much of the terrain consists of extensive plains in which
 little construction is needed to permit the use of motor vehicles.  In
 the rugged and compartmentalized ridge and gorge terrain of eastern Ti-
 bet, however, road construction has been much slower and more costly.
 T. spite of improved enroad tirelyrnuponilongfand         Chinese

 To lessen their dependence upon food transported from China, Chinese
 authorities have stressed the necessity for increased agricultural output
 in Tibet.  Some increases are likely through the expansion ofrgation,
 greater use of fertilizers, and the introduction of other improved
 niques.  It is possible that improved rations for the Tibetans and self-
 sufficiency for the superstructure of Chinese troops, administrators, and
 cadres may be achieved during the next few years.  The limitations of

 unsuitable terrain, high elevations, low temperatures, and insufficient
 precipitation, however, make it unlikelrr that enough additional land can
 be brought under cultivation to permit significant numbers of Chinese
 immigrants to settle in Tibet.
 In 1959 and 1960, after the international publicity given Tibet by
 the March 1959 revolt and the flight of the Dalai Lama to India, con-
 sultative bodies to the United Nations made authoritative appraisals
 concerning the legal status of Tibet.  These appraisals help to clarify
 the complexities of international law surrounding the status of Tibet;
 and, by concluding that Tibet was an independent state in 1913 when it
 was a signatory to the Simla Convention, they also give some support
 to the Indian position on the validity of the McMahon Line.

 I.  Introduction
 Chinese Communist efforts to bring about a "socialist transfor-
 mation" in Tibet have met with frustration repeatedly during the past
 several years.  In December 1960 the Chinese announced that the social-
 ization of Tibet would be postponed for 5 years.*  This policy retreat
 followed the tacit admission that the introduction of land reform con-
 siderable the organization of mutual-aid teams during 1959-60 had met
 siderable opposition.  The Chinese leadership therefore decided that
 conditions in Tibet were not suitable for the furtherance of present
 Party policies; instead, emphasis should be placed upon "consolidation"
 of the "democratic revolution."  The continuance of logistical problems
 in supplying the Chinese personnel in Tibet, numbering roughly via long and difficult supply routes also had a dampening effect on the
 pursuit of unpopular programs that might spark additional Tibetan
 resistance.
 Although major Chinese Communist programs now have been shelved, the
 imple-
 mentation position in Tibet is slowly being strengthened through
 mentation of less spectacular measures.  The local Tibetan administrative
 structure has been replaced by standard Chinese administrative organs,
 staffed by Chinese and pro-Chinese Tibetans.  Motorable roads continue
 to be built, particularly in southern Tibet.  The Chinese also continue
 to stress the need for increased agricultural production and suggest  -
 ways of achieving it.  Significant gains in this undertaking might per-

 After the inauguration of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet
 Autonomous Region in 1956, the attempt to curb the power of the monas-
 teries and related restrictions helped spark sizable anti-Chinese out-
 breaks, particularly in eastern Tibet.  Consequently, a 5-year morato-
 rium on the introduction of so-called democratic reforms was announced
 by Mao Tse-tung in early 1957.  In spite of this promise of postponement
 of "reform," the outbreak of heavy fighting in March 1959 and the flight
 of the Dalai Lama to India led to a renewal of Chinese efforts to prod
 the truculent Tibetans into taking the first steps on the "road to so-
 cialism."  But considerable Tibetan resistance to both land reform and
 the organization of mutual-aid teams forced another Chinese "reexam-
 ination  of Party policies in 1960, and this examination was followed
 by the retrenchment announcement of late 1960.  In spite of the 1960
 moratorium, however,  a fundamental change in Tibetan society was ac-
 complished during the land-reform program by the confiscation or "buy-
 ing out"    the large
 base from which much sofrtheirnpower wasility,

 The legal status of Tibet came under scrutiny in 1959 when the
 General Assembl rof the United Nations debated the "question of Tibet
 including the charges that the Chinese Communists had practiced gen-
 ocide and violated human rights in Tibet.                            Under the auspices of the
 United Nations, the International Commission of Jurists prepared two
 reports on the situation.  The Commission included in its findings the
 judgment that Tibet was in fact an independent state from 1913 to 1950.
 Although the findings have little practical effect on the present sta-
 tus of Tibet, tije implication of Tibetan statehood at the time the
 Simla Convention was signed in 191+ lends weight to the Indian con-
 tention that the McMahon Line is a valid boundary.  To this extent the
 Commission's findings support the Indian case in the Sino-Indian bor-
 der dispute.

 II.  Administrative Changes
 In January 1960 the Chinese Communists announced that Tibet had
 been or anized into 7 special districts (chuan-ch'ii) and 1 munici-
 pality (shih) through which the 72 newly created hsien would be ad-
 ministered  see Table 1 and Map 35255).*                                This reorganization marked
 the end of the traditional administrative system of Tibet, which had
 been based on a level of local government called the dzon   tsun ),
 as well as the end of Chinese efforts to implement policy directives
 at the local level through the mechanism of traditional institutions.
 Chinese dissatisfaction with the existing situation had become appar-
 ent in 1959 when press releases in China noted pointedly that the
 administrative units of Tibet were staffed almost entirely by Tibetans.
 It was these Tibetan officials, charged the Chinese Communists, to-
 gether with the "reactionary clique of the upper strata" -- the cler-
 ical and lay nobility -- who were the leading instigators of the re-
 bellion.  In July 1959 the pro-Chinese Tibetan, Ngapo Ngawang Jigme,
 who holds the title of Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for
 the Tibet Autonomous Region, called the traditional Tibetan adminis-
 trative system "irrational and inconvenient for administrative manage-
 ment." jam'  Jigme further suggested making a "rational" administrative
 redivision based upon topography, communications, economy, defense, and
 similar factors. J  Administrative changes of this type were made, and
 the present administrative structure became effective in January 1960.
 Most of the 72 hsien of Tibet are located in the south and east,
 where sedentary agriculture is possible.  The population of the agri-
 cultural areas is estimated at 900,000, distributed by administrative
 division as shown in Table 2.xxx  The 300,000 Tibetans who are classi-
 fied as nomads are scattered throughout Tibet wherever pastures can be
 found, but the majority are located north of the Tsangpo on the high
 grasslands of the Chang Thang, or northern plateau.  The traditional
 independence of the nomads and the obvious difficulties of maintaining
 satisfactory control over pastoral people located in a bleak and in-
 hospitable physical environment have posed perplexing problems for the
 Chinese.  The chief shortcoming of democratic reform in Tibet is that,
 as the Panchen Lama succinctly stated in December 1960, "a set of work
 experiences has not yet been found which will suit the characteristics
 of the pastoral areas in which there is a large stretch of land but a
 small population and in which the people live widely apart and move
 frequently from one place to another." 3/

 C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L
 The creation. of the special districts resulted in the abolition of
 the Chamdd LocaJl Area (Ch'ang-tu Ti-ch'ii), a political unit at the pro-
 vince level governed by the Chamdo Liberation Committee.  The Chamdo
 Local Area was established early in the Communist rule of Tibet to gov-
 ern the territory extending roughly from the upper Yangtze River west to
 the older provincial border between Tibet and Sikang.*  Although Chamdo
 representativeswere included on the 51-member Preparatory Committee for
 the Autonomous Legion of Tibet (organized in 1956) and the inference was
 that Chamdo would be a part of the future Tibet Autonomous Region, some
 confusion aboutthe status of Chamdo remained even after 1956.  It was
 shown as a separate unit, not part of Tibet, on Chinese Communist maps
 and was listed in administrative tables as a province-level unit.  When
 Chamdo officially became a part of Tibet through the 1960 reorganization,
 however, the ancient political boundaries of Tibet were restored.
 Although a (4hinese Communist administrative structure has been forced
 upon Tibet (see tFigure 1), the actual functioning of the system that was
 set up to achieve effective implementation of Party policies is dependent
 upon the staff] of local government organs by trained and dependable
 Tibetan and Chinese cadres.  Official reports made by the Panchen Lama
 in 1960 and 1961 have included statements concerning the necessity of
 having "a considerable number of Han cadres and cadres of other broth-
 erly nationalities to work in Tibet."     Chinese press releases fre-
 quently have ref$rred to the incompetency of the cadres in Tibet and the
 consequent diffiulty in carrying out Party directives. /  Improvement
 in cadre qualityiobviously will be a key factor in the furtherance of
 Communist objectives in Tibet.
 *  When the SikanO Province of China was organized in 1928, its western
 border was drawn nearly 400 miles west of the upper Yangtze River.  At
 that time the Yan tze marked the somewhat fluctuating line between terri-
 tory controlled from Lhasa and that controlled by Chinese authorities in
 Szechwan Provinces  Despite any semblance of Chinese administration west
 of the Yangtze during the period from 1912 to 1951, the fiction of Chi-
 nese control was maintained by maps that showed hsien seats in this area
 and a Sino-Tibetan border drawn only 75 miles east of Lhasa.  Thus the
 creation of the Ch`amdo Local Area, coinciding in territory with this

 Figure 1.  The town of Lin-chih in southeastern Tibet.
 Lin-chih is the administrative headquarters of the
 Lin-chih special district.  The numerous new buildings
 constructed by the Chinese Communist occupation forces
 and trucks such as those in the left foreground make a
 visible imprint on Tibetan communities.  Southeastern
 Tibet is mostly below 10,000 feet in elevation, lower
 than other parts of the country, and receives a consid-
 erable amount of rain.  Consequently, the slopes here
 are covered by shrubs and trees, in sharp contrast to
 the barren hills so characteristic of most of Tibet.

 III.  Road Construction
 Road construction in Tibet was greatly accelerated after the March
 1959 revolt, particularly the building of new roads to the Nepal, Bhutan,
 and northeastern India frontiers.  Roads now connect most of the im-
 portant Tibetan towns in the Himalayan border region, and an east-west
 road (actually parts of several roads) now parallels the entire southern
 border of Tibet (see Map 351l28).* Most of these roads were hastily built
 to support Chinese military operations against areas of dissidence, many
 of which were located between the Tsangpo and the Himalayas.  After the
 more immediate military requirements of 1959 had been satisfied, the
 further extension of the road network enabled the Chinese to maintain
 tighter control of the southern border regions of Tibet.  Through the
 construction of a road net along the southern border, the southward
 movement of Tibetan refugees can be regulated, possible overland smug-
 gling of military supplies into Tibet can be checked more easily, and
 Chinese military capabilities against India, Nepal, and Bhutan are
 enhanced.
 One of the more significant of the roads built during the past 3
 years is the 600-mile road linking Zhikatse with Barkha, a point on the
 Sinkiang-Tibet road in western Tibet.  The completion of this road link,
 which has been rumored as under construction for many years, should now
 permit the movement of supplies from the major Chinese bases at Lhasa
 and Zhikatse to western Tibet.  Up to now, western Tibet has been depend-
 ent upon goods brought from Sinkiang over a road that is probably closed
 to traffic during much of the winter and early spring.
 Another recently constructed road of considerable importance con-
 nects Zhikatse with Tingri Dzong, a strategic Chinese base near the
 Nepalese border.  From this road a number of feeder routes probably have
 been built or are under construction to such points as Tingkye Dzong,
 Sar, Nyalam Dzong, Jongkha Dzong, and other places near the border.  The
 importance of the Tingri Dzong route was increased by the signing, on
 15 October 1961, of an agreement between Nepal and Communist China for
 the construction of a road link between the two countries.
 The relatively open valleys and level plateaus that are character-
 istic of much of southern Tibet permit roads to be "constructed" with
 minimal effort and in little time.  Most of the roads built since 1959
 probably have been "simple highways"** with natural earth surfaces (see

 **   Roads in Communist China are classified in six basic types according
 to construction specifications, type of surface, and traffic capacity.
 The lowest class, Type VI-B, is a "simple highway," designed as a single-
 lane, low-capacity road with a natural earth (footnote continued on p. 16]

 Figure 2). 1    An October 1959 Chinese Communist press report stated
 that after the suppression of the rebellion, simple highways were built
 to connect most of the hsien in southern Tibet. 18   The speed of con-
 struction can be explained by the relatively open terrain and the likeli-
 hood that existing caravan tracks were used as road alignments.  Most
 roads are estimated to be motorable during all but a few weeks of the
 year.  Although precipitation generally is light in southern Tibet, oc-
 casional heavy rains and resultant flooding during summer may disrupt
 traffic, particularly on simple highways where smaller streams may not
 be bridged.  In some of the protected plains and lower valleys near the
 Nepalese border, winter snowfall has been known to halt transport for
 several days at a time.   Depending upon the importance of the route and
 the availability of alternate means of transport, many of these original
 simple highways probably will be improved through the realignment of
 difficult sections, widening, bridging, and the addition of aggregate
 to road surfaces (see Figure 3).

 surface.   The building of such a simple road in Tibet, as suggested by
 its construction specifications and surface characteristics, may involve
 nothing more than the use of stones to outline a roadbed across flat
 barren or grassy plains.

 relatively small streams can be forded, improve-
 ment of a road usually includes the construction
 of bridges such as this one on a road in southern
 Tibet between Sakya Gompa and Zhikatse.
 Although Chinese Communist transportation capabilities have improved
 markedly in southern Tibet, poor communications remain a problem in many
 areas of eastern Tibet (see Figure 1).  Here deeply incised rivers and
 streams have dissected the plateau into an intricate mosaic of deep
 canyons, sharp ridges, and precipices.  Thus the northwest-southeast
 alignment of these terrain features greatly hinders east-west commu-
 nications.  The main Szechwan-Lhasa road, particularly the section between
 Ch'ang-tu and Lin-chih, has been plagued since its completion in late 195+
 by maintenance problems because of ice and snow on the higher stretches
 during winter and frequent landslides in areas of lower elevation where
 rainfall is comparatively heavy.  To bypass this section of the route
 and to improve over-all Chinese Communist control, new roads have been
 under construction for several years, notably a southern route via
 Batang, Ning-ching, Pang-ta, and Sung-tsung, and a northern road,
 apparently uncompleted, from Chang-tu to Ting-ch'ing to Nagchhu Dzong.
 Where political and economic conditions warrant and the terrain permits
 their construction, branch roads lead from the major routes into side
 valleys.  Data are insufficient, however, to plot the location of all
 these roads on the accompanying map.

 IV.  Air Transport
 An air link between Tibet and China has existed since 1956, when
 the airfield near Tang-hsiung, some 60 miles due north of Lhasa, was
 completed (see Figure 5).  The Tang-hsiung field is built on a plain
 at an elevation of 1+,000 feet and has the distinction of being the
 highest airfield in the world.  Numerous reports during the past sev-
 eral years have mentioned other airfields under construction in Tibet,
 but -- with the possible exception of a field located near Nagchhu
 Dzong, some 150 miles north of Lhasa -- none is believed to be oper-
 ational.
 Figure 5.  Tang-hsiung Airfield near Lhasa.  The Tibetans in the
 foreground are welcoming the first plane that landed on the new
 field, in June 1956.  The airfield is 1+,000 feet above sea level;
 the peaks of the Nyenchhen Thangiha in the background rise several
 thousand feet higher.
 The extensive and generally hard-surfaced plains that are common to
 many areas of Tibet facilitate the construction of airfields.  Possibly
 some sites could be utilized as landing grounds with little more than a
 ground check to remove stones and other minor obstacles.  Much of the
 reported construction activity related to airfields, therefore, may be
 in the nature of preliminary work designed to provide emergency landing
 fields in areas of possible future air operations.
 The high elevations and severe climate of Tibet affect air operations
 as well as the construction of airfields.  Frequent gales, low temper-
 atures, and changeable weather hamper air operations.   In the rarified
 air of the Tibetan Plateau, extraordinarily long runways are essential.

 V.  Agriculture
 A major problem for the Chinese Communists in maintaining control
 of Tibet is the necessity of transporting foodstuffs from China to
 supply the large numbers of Chinese troops, cadres, and technicians
 (see Figure 6).  Because major increases in the amount of food trans-
 ported into Tibet are not likely to occur until (or if) the Hsi-ning--
 Lhasa railroad is constructed, emphasis probably will continue to be on
 measures designed to increase local production.
 Figure 6.  Truckloads of grain at Lhasa.  The need to
 import food supplies into Tibet via long and costly
 truck hauls to feed the large numbers of occupying Chi-
 nese is one of the major problems of Communist control
 of Tibet.
 Estimates of the total amount of land cultivated suggest a figure
 between 450,000 and 500,000 acres -- far less than 1 percent of Tibet's
 total area.   (See Map 35953* for approximate distribution of agricultural
 land.)  In general, most of the flat land in river valleys below 1+,000
 feet in elevation is cultivated.  The principal crops are barley, wheat,
 buckwheat, and root vegetables.   In a few places where elevations drop
 below 10,000 feet -- such as the Chumbi Valley and parts of Lin-chih in
 southeastern Tibet -- a greater variety of foodstuffs, including rice
 and fruit, can be grown.  As indicated on Map 35953, not all river val-
 leys below 1+,000 feet can be cultivated.  Portions of the Tsangpo Val-
 ley between Zhikatse and Tsethang, for example, are covered with great

 C-0-N-F-I-D-E-?N-T-I-A-L
 sand dunes; some of the valleys of southeastern Tibet are still in
 forests; and the deep canyons characteristic of rivers and streams of
 eastern Tibet restrict cultivation to isolated valley flats and scatter-
 ed fields on the upper slopes.  As a consequence of the paucity of
 cultivated land and the limitations on output imposed by the severe
 Tibetan climate, agricultural production has been barely adequate for
 the local populace. Traditionally the Tibetans have carried on a lim-
 ited border trade by exchanging wool and salt for foodstuffs from
 India and Nepal.
 Feeding the Chinese stationed in Tibet aggravates an already diffi-
 cult problem of procuring an adequate food supply.  Chinese efforts to
 increase and stimulate agricultural production have been centered at
 their Lhasa Experimental Station, located in the fertile and protected
 Kyi Chhu Valley (see Figure 7).  Common garden vegetables in wide variety
 have been grown successfully, and experimental test plots have been
 planted with different varieties of barley and wheat.  By 1959 the Chi-
 nese Communists claimed to have achieved self-sufficiency in supplying
 vegetables to their personnel in Tibet.  17!   A 1960 report claimed that
 some 50 percent of their meat requirements also were met through their
 own efforts. 20   The validity of these statements, however, is doubtful,
 in spite of the probability that many permanent Chinese installations
 include vegetable gardens and that Chinese personnel engage in animal
 husbandry to some extent.  In Lhasa in January 1962, a conference on
 production by government organizations gave a less optimistic picture of
 the present and a qualified view of future production by stating that if
 ideological, planning, and policy problems are settled "all Tibet govern-
 ment organizations may well be self-supporting in food crops, edible
 oils, meat, vegetables, and cattle fodder in years to come." 21
 The possibility that agricultural production could be dramatically
 raised by reclaiming large tracts of land has been suggested occasion-
 ally (see Figure 8).  According to Anna Louise Strong, a pro-Communist
 author who visited Tibet in 1959, Chinese officials professed to have no
 statistics available on the amount of land reclaimable. 22   In her talks
 with numerous officials in Lhasa, however, the consensus was that culti-
 vated land could be increased by 50 percent and possibly doubled. 23
 Considerable labor would be needed to drain swamps, build irrigation
 ditches, and carry out other measures that are required to open up addi-
 tional land.  There have been various claims that the area under culti-
 vation has been increased, but the major Chinese effort continues to be
 toward increasing yields from land now in crops. 24+   Because of the
 relatively primitive state of Tibetan agriculture, higher yields could
 be achieved through increased fertilization -- although, in view of the
 transport problems, local supplies of animal manure will probably have
 to be used instead of chemical fertilizers.  Manures, however, may be in
 short supply in some agricultural areas that are deficient in fuelwood,
 because dried dung is commonly used for fuel.  The use of improved seeds,

 extension of irrigation works and better maintenance of them, and other
 agricultural techniques may also increase output significantly.
 Discussions of land reclamation are often tied in with the assertion
 that Tibet could be populated by millions of Han Chinese immigrants.
 Although it is likely that substantial increases in agricultural output
 can be realized during the next few years, it is unlikely that this in-
 crease will be so great or new land so extensive that Han Chinese would
 be permitted to settle in any more than token numbers.  Probably the
 increases in production will provide little more than improved rations
 for the Tibetans and self-sufficiency for the superstructure of Chinese
 troops, administrators, and cadres.

 VI.  Other Economic Developments
 Aside from improving agricultural practices, few attempts have been
 made to develop the economy of Tibet.  A major exception has been the
 mining of borax at several places near Pan-ko Hsien in northern Tibet.
 In 1959, some 10,000 tons of borax were exported to the Soviet Union;
 with the inclusion of exports to other Bloc nations, this figure prob-
 ably had doubled by 1961. /  Other development has been of local sig-
 nificance only, consisting of the construction of a small hydroelectric
 station near Lhasa (see Figure 9), the opening of coal mines near Lhasa
 and in northern Tibet, and the establishment of motor-vehicle shops,
 farm-tool manufacturing plants, and leather-tanning and similar handi-
 craft industries in Lhasa and other urban centers. 26   Agriculture
 remains the first priority, and Chinese Communist officials have stated
 that industrial development of Tibet is de endent upon its first be-
 coming agriculturally self-sufficient.

 VII. Legal Status
 Before the March 1959 revolt the world was little concerned about
 or interested in the legal status of Tibet.  This indifference resulted
 primarily from (1) the physical isolation of Tibet and its almost non-
 existent external contacts, and (2) the continued claims of past and
 present Chinese governments that Tibet was an integral part of China.*
 The latter point was reinforced by the undeniable fact that Tibet was a
 dependency of China for nearly two centuries prior to 1912.  The flight
 of the Dalai Lama to India in March 1959 and the confirmation of large-
 scale fighting between Chinese and Tibetans sparked considerable inter-
 est in Tibet and its relationship with China, including debate in the
 United Nations over the reported Chinese violation of human rights and
 the practice of genocide against the Tibetans.
 The activity of the United Nations in Tibetan affairs included the
 investigation by the International Commission of Jurists, an organiza-
 tion with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social
 Council.  Both reports prepared by the Jurists -- a preliminary one by
 the Commission in July 1959 and a more detailed study by the Legal In-
 quiry Committee that was specially convened under the aegis of the Com-
 mission in 1960 -- concluded that Tibet was at the very least a de facto
 independent state at the time of the 1950 Chinese invasion. 29/  The
 jurists were satisfied that from 1913 to 1950 Tibet had demonstrated
 the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international
 law:  a distinct people inhabiting a definite territory and having a gov-
 ernment that conducted its domestic affairs free from outside control and
 also conducted its own foreign relations.  Although its foreign relations
 were few, the evidence showed that the Tibetan government exclusively
 conducted its own affairs after 1913.  Also, countries with whom Tibet
 had foreign relations treated Tibet as an independent state.  The find-
 ings of the Commission are largely of academic interest as far as any
 practical change in Tibet's present status is concerned, inasmuch as
 Tibet is and apparently will continue for the foreseeable future to be
 a de facto territory of Communist China.
 A more tangible result of the jurist's deliberations is additional
 backing for the Indian position regarding the legality of the McMahon
 *  The Government of the Republic of China, as well as the Communist
 regime on the mainland, maintains that Tibet is an integral part of
 China.  After the March 1959 revolt, President Chiang restated the po-
 sition of the Chinese Nationalist Government that "when the mainland is
 recovered," it would "assist the Tibetan people to realize their own
 aspirations in accordance with the principles of self-determination." 28

 Line.  If, as the jurists contend, Tibet was an independent state in
 1913, then it was in a position at the Simla Conference of 1913-14* to
 negotiate and sign the Simla Convention. of 1914 that included a map on
 which the McMahon Line was delineated.
 *  The Simla. Conference of 1913-14, attended by representatives of Great
 Britain, China, and Tibet, was called in an attempt to settle the status
 of Tibet.  A primary objective of the Conference was to partition Tibet
 into an Inner Tibet, where Chinese sovereignty would be recognized, and
 an Outer Tibet that would be autonomous.,  In the course of determining
 this Sino-Tibetan border, a boundary between India and Tibet east of
 Bhutan was defined and drawn on a map.   This boundary became known as the
 McMahon Line.  Although the Chinese representative refused to sign the
 final agreement, the British and Tibetan plenipotentiaries concluded the
 Simla, Convention on 3 July 1914 using the map on which the McMahon Line
 had been drawn.

 VIII.  Conclusions
 The difficulties encountered by the Chinese Communists in their
 attempts to control Tibet and the Tibetan people are similar to those
 faced by earlier Chinese regimes.  Perennial obstacles to Chinese dom-
 ination in Tibet include the great distances separating centers of
 Tibetan authority from Chinese bases as well as the high cost of main-
 taining communications between them; the size of Tibet, in which large
 areas are sparsely populated by mobile nomadic groups who traditionally
 have resisted any form of external control; and the widespread antip-
 athy between Tibetans and Chinese, which is sharpened by their contrast-
 ing ways of life.
 The construction of motorable roads seemingly should have eased con-
 siderably the problems of transportation between Tibet and China, but
 adequate supplies of indigenous food and other necessities are lacking
 and the large numbers of Chinese in Tibet are still largely dependent
 upon supplies brought long distances over difficult roads.  The trans-
 portation situation is not likely to improve in the near future because
 air-supply capabilities are limited and the proposed railroad from
 Tsinghai to Lhasa is a questionable project with a completion date many
 years in the future.
 Basic Sino-Tibetan animosities remain, and the Chinese leadership
 has admitted that among the "masses" an understanding of socialism is
 imperfect -- which, in effect, means that the Chinese have experienced
 determined Tibetan opposition.  The lack of trained cadres, either
 trusted Tibetans or reliable Chinese, who could implement Party pol-
 icies at the local level continues to be a problem.
 In spite of the opposition of the Tibetans and the other vexing
 problems with which the Chinese Communists have been confronted, the
 record of 10 years of Communist occupation has been one of halting but
 continuing alteration of the social, political, and economic structure
 of Tibet.  The apparent breaking up of the vast power of the monas-
 teries by confiscation of most of their large land holdings through
 programs of land reform and the resultant general depopulation of the
 monasteries are perhaps the most far-reaching and significant of the
 Communist "reforms."  The Chinese Communists have reiterated that, in
 spite of the present moratorium on new programs, the political need for
 eventual reform persists.  They seem determined to proceed toward their
 goal of transforming Tibet into a pliant and socialized territory under
 complete Communist domination.
