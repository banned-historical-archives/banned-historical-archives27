 THE BULGANIN LETTERS .       . .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 Premier Bulganin's letters to the heads of the
 NATO governments and to Nehru on the eve of the Paris
 NATO conference climax a world-wide propaganda cam-
 paign by the Soviet bloc aimed at stimulating suspi-
 cion of the motives of Western, particularly American,
 government  leaders in taking steps to increase NATO's
 strength  and  unity.  By formally reaffirming Soviet
 willingness to engage in new high-level East-West talks
 on outstanding issues and by suggesting a wide variety
 of measures to lessen international tension, the let-
 ters reinforce hints made privately by top Soviet lead-
 ers to Western diplomats during the past two weeks
 which bold out the prospect of a general East-West set-
 tlement on the basis of the status quo.
 THE NATO MEETING .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 3
 On the eve of the NATO meeting from 16 to 18 Decem-
 ber, Continental European members are stepping up their
 campaign to impress on the United States their inten-
 tion to proceed with closer military cooperation among
 themselves, especially if satisfactory NATO-wide meas-
 ures fail to develop.  British-Continental differences
 have been highlighted by the impasse between London and
 Bonn over support-cost payments for British troops in
 West Germany.  Among non-NATO members in the free world,
 only Japan has officially indicated a desire to be in-
 cluded in any new arrangements for expanded cooperation.

 The political and economic situation in Indonesia has
 deteriorated further, particularly in Java, as the anti-
 Dutch campaign has continued unabated. The Soviet bloc
 moved quickly to exploit these circumstances and offered
 to furnish technical personnel, shipping, and air services
 to replace those hitherto provided by the Dutch.
 The confused state of affairs has been further com-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 December 1957
 PART I   (continued)
 Chief of Staff Nasution has taken over the government
 from President Sukarno.  These three men may have felt
 that,  in view of the worsening situation in Java, drastic
 measures were called for to avoid a Communist takeover
 and the fragmentation of the Indonesian republic.
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 SUPREME SOVIET MEETING . .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The Supreme Soviet session scheduled to begin on
 19 December will probably be devoted to the routine
 annual approval of the  budget and  discussing
 and approving the 1958 economic plan, but no drastic
 alterations in present economic policies are antic-
 ipated.  The Soviet leaders may also consider the time
 ripe for another report on the international situa-
 tion and Soviet foreign policy.  The proposals in Bul-
 ganin's  notes to Western leaders   o uld probably form
 the basis of such a report; possible measures to bol-
 ster the Warsaw pact might well follow a decision at
 the
 Paris conference to strengthen NATO militarily.

 Fighting continues between Spanish troops and
 Moroccan irregulars in the Spanish African enclave
 of Ifni. Madrid apparently still hopes to launch a
 successful counteroffensive from selected strong
 points but, without substantial reinforcements, may
 not be able to re-establish its authority over areas
 now being abandoned.   Such a development would seri-
 ously weaken Spain's bargaining position in any future
 territorial negotiations with Morocco.                                          25X1

 The prestige of Syrian Defense Minister Azm con-
 tinues to grow.  His rise and his openly pro-Soviet
 policies, plus the gradually increasing influence of
 local Communists, are causing more worry for Syria's
 radical nationalists.   Saudi-Egyptian relations re-
 main very cool, with the Saudis complaining about
 Egyptian propaganda treatment of King Saud.   Iran
 continues to be tempted by Soviet offers,  including
 a reported oil proposal which would give Iran more
 than 75 percent of the profits.                                                  25X1

 PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT RESIGNS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 5
 The resignation on 11 December of Prime Minister
 Chundrigar's government in Pakistan is a blow to Presi-
 dent Mirza's political prestige and constitutes the
 most difficult problem he has faced since assuming the
 presidency.  With the breakup of the uneasy coalition
 he promoted between his Republican party and Chundri-
 gar's Moslem League in October, Mirza is at present
 confronted with the choice of allowing a new coalition
 government to be formed by politicians who have repudi-
 ated his leadership or of resorting to direct authori-
 tarian rule.

 Most members of the top Soviet leadership have
 been engaged in a campaign throughout the country
 to present the results of the recent Moscow confer-
 ences to the Soviet population as a major achieve-
 ment in intrabloc and international diplomacy and
 to remove whatever doubts may have arisen since the
 20th party congress about bloc unity.
 NEW SOVIET LONG-RANGE ATOMIC CANNON   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 7
 Two new self-propelled guns were displayed at
 last month's 40th anniversary parade in Moscow.         It
 is estimated that one of the weapons could fire a 390-
 pound, ram-jet-powered, high-explosive projectile to
 a range of some 200 miles and an atomic warhead to a
 range of some 30 miles, while the other could fire an
 atomic round to about 90 miles.  The accuracy of these
 weapons is believed to compare favorably          ided-
 missile delivery systems of similar range.

 As part of its renewed policy of repression, the
 East German regime has stepped up its program to force
 the German Evangelical Church to separate into eastern
 and western branches.  The regime hopes to reduce the
 influence of the church in East Germany as a rallying
 point for resistance to communization.  Persecution of
 the church, however, will probably add to the alread
 strong resentment of the regime in East Germany. II                25X1

 PART II (continued)
 PEIPING SETS NEW ECONOMIC GOALS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 9
 Communist China's long-range planning chief Li Fu-
 chun has asserted that China will surpass Great Britain
 in the production of steel and other industrial items
 by 1972 and that some industrial targets for the Second
 Five-Year Plan, beginning in 1958, will be raised.  Pei-
 ping seems to be proceeding with increased confidence
 brought on by the success of the First Five-Year Plan
 and, perhaps, by the results of recent talks in Moscow.
 In agriculture,  however,  the confidence is somewhat tem-
 pered, and original tar ets for major crops in 1962 have
 been lowered.

 CHINA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 11
 A statement last week by An Tzu-wen, a key figure
 in Chinese Communist party personnel matters, strength-
 eus previous indications that the party is headed for
 a vigorous weeding out.    Peiping is expected to an-
 nounce plans for punishing rightists and other "undesir-
 able" elements--possibly including some central commit-
 tee members--at the next party congress, which regime
 spokesmen have said will be held soon.
 NORTH KOREA MAKES NEW PEACE OVERTURES TO SOUTH .
 Premier Kim I1-sung has addressed new peace ap-
 peals to South Korean audiences and intimated that he
 is eager, pending "peaceful unification," to establish
 de facto relations with Seoul.  Kim for the first time
 explicitly called for the withdrawal from Korea of
 Chinese Communist as well as American forces and again
 proposed the unsealing of the armistice line to permit
 North-South trade.  Pyongyang remains adamant against
 unification based on UN-supervised elections.

 The results of Japanese Prime Minister Kishi's

 land, while not regarded as major diplomatic triumphs,
 have been welcomed by Japan's critical press.              Kishi
 was greeted cordially in countries where postwar bitter-
 ness toward Japan has been strongest and succeeded in
 reaching understandings for settlement of disputes with
 Indonesia and Australia.

 PART II  (continued)
 ELECTIONS IN-THAILAND            . .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 13
 Elections on 15 December to fill 160 seats in Thai-
 land's unicameral legislature are intended primarily to
 provide the civilian facade behind which Marshal Sarit and
 his military group will continue to run the country. The
 conservative and pro-Western Democrats are expected to
 win the most seats, followed by Sarit's Unionists and
 the left-wing Socialist Front.  The elections will prob-
 ably be relatively clean, partly because the military
 group, which controls 123 appointive seats, feels it can
 afford free elections.
 THE CYPRUS SITUATION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 14
 Rioting on Cyprus erupted with the opening of the
 Cyprus debate in the UN General Assembly on 9 December.
 EOKA has warned that "total war" will follow if the de-
 bate does not lead to an acceptable resolution, but has
 also indicated a willingness to postpone violence for
 five or six weeks as requested by the new governor of
 Cyprus.  Greece continues to insist on British-Cypriot
 .iegotiations toward self-determination, while Turkey
 remains firm in support of partition.  Compromise ef-
 forts are likely to succeed in preventing a showdown at
 25X1       the UN.
 FRENCH SOCIALIST DIFFERENCES THREATEN GAILLARD COALITION .  Page 15
 The future of the Gaillard government may hinge
 on the French Socialists' National Council meeting on
 14-15 December, since many Socialists are increasingly
 resentful over continued participation in a conserva.tive-
 tinged government.   Socialist leader Guy Mollet has been
 forced to take a strongly doctrinaire approach in op-
 posing some of Gaillard's anti-inflationary proposals,
 and he will be under strong pressure to drop support of
 the government's present Algerian policy.  The Commu-
 25X1            nists are in a good position to exploit these differences.

 LONDON'S MILITARY INTERVENTION IN BRITISH HONDURAS .  .  .  .  Page  16
 Reinforcement of the British garrison in Belize on
 6 December to prevent violence over the ouster of a local
 government minister will provide Caribbean Communists
 with material for renewed propaganda attacks on British
 colonial policy and may adversely affect relations be-
 tween the United Kingdom and the member states of the West
 Indies Federation, to be inaugurated in April 1958.

 THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENTIAL PLEBISCITE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 17
 Rumors of military disaffection and recent antigov-
 ernment demonstrations by students have increased pub-
 lic tension in Venezuela on the eve of President Perez
 Jimenez' election plebiscite on 15 December by which he
 plans to win a second five-year term.  Although the sta-
 bility of the government may be threatened, the regime
 is believed capable of handling any violence during the
 electoral period.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 MOSCOW CONFERENCE OF WORLD COMMUNIST LEADERS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 The primary Soviet objectives at the Moscow con-
 ferences of world Communist leaders in November were
 to reassert the USSR's leadership of the Communist bloc
 and to reinforce bloc unity.  These aims required, how-
 ever, some formulations in the communique and manifesto
 which evaded rather than resolved difficult issues. Mao
 Tse-tung's strong endorsement of the USSR's leading
 position indicates a marked advance in the reaffirmation
 of Soviet primacy, but subsequent statements by Gomulka,
 combined with the failure of Yugoslavia to sign the 12-
 nation communique, point to the continued existence of
 divergencies in the Communist world.
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN EGYPT .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  4
 Egypt's economy has been able to make up many of
 the losses resulting from the Suez crisis, but the past
 year has seen a general slowing of economic activity,
 a cutback in the Nasir regime's development program,
 and increased dependence on the Soviet bloc.  Without
 greater foreign assistance than the recent Soviet line
 of credit provides, Egypt probably cannot maintain even
 its present low standard of living.  While not irrev-
 ocably  tied to the Communist bloc, Egypt appears con-
 siderably more dependent on it economically than any
 other non-Communist nation.

 variety of measures to reduce
 international tension, the let-
 ters reinforce hints made pri-
 vately by top Soviet leaders to
 Western diplomats during the
 past two weeks which hold out
 the prospect of a general East-
 West settlement on the basis of
 the status quo.
 The 10 December letter to
 President Eisenhower recounts
 in detail the dangers which "in-
 tensifying the arms race" would
 hold for the prospects for world
 peace, and warns that "cata-
 strophic consequences" would re-
 sult from any attempt to impose
 territorial changes by external
 force or to upset the status quo
 between the capitalist and com-
 munist systems.
 The message suggests a num-
 ber of measures to increase in-
 ternational confidence and slow
 down the arms race:   a. voluntary
 renunciation by the nuclear pow-
 ers of the use of nuclear weap-
 ons, and a two-to-three-year ban
 on nuclear weapons testing as of
 1 January 1958; an agreement by
 the nuclear powers not to sta-
 tion nuclear weapons "of any
 kind" on West German or East
 German soil, plus an agreement
 by those two countries and by
 Poland and Czechoslovakia not
 to produce or deploy such weap-
 ons on their territories; a. non-
 aggression pact among members
 of NATO and the Warsaw pact; a
 treaty of friendship between
 the United States and the So-
 viet Union plus increased trade,
 broadened cultural and scientif-
 ic  contacts and a. halt in prop-
 aganda, and a declaration re-
 nouncing interference in Middle
 Eastern internal affairs and
 the use of force in dealing with
 Middle Eastern questions.
 Adoption of such measures,
 Bulganin claims, would create
 an atmosphere of confidence
 making further steps possible,
 including troop withdrawals from
 foreign territories.   Finally,
 the letter urges a "personal
 meeting of state leaders" to
 discuss all outstanding problems.
 These various suggestions re-
 peat standing official Soviet
 proposals, with the exception
 that the letter falls short of
 the Soviet nuclear weapons pro-
 posal made to the UN last Sep-
 tember by omitting any reference
 to control provisions in connec-
 tion with nuclear testing or to
 a five-year duration for a re-
 nunciation of the use of nuclear
 weapons.
 The letters to the West
 European NATO members are couched
 in terms designed to stimulate
 fears that these countries will
 be Soviet targets in case of a
 future war if NATO, particularly
 American, atomic and missile
 bases are established on their
 territories.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 December 1957
 The message to Chancellor
 Adenauer refers to the "divi-
 sion of labor" in NATO which
 alleges that the United States
 will supply "money and equip-
 ment" and the other NATO mem-
 bers will furnish "cannon fod-
 der" and expose their territory
 to the danger of "the first
 blow of retaliation."   The let-
 ter repeats the proposals for
 a "nuclear ban" in Germany, Po-
 land, and Czechoslovakia and
 for foreign troop withdrawals,
 and cites the possibility of
 progress in the current West
 German - Soviet negotiations
 in Moscow.
 Bulganin's letter of
 10
 December to Nehru, made in
 re-
 ply to India's appeal to the
 United States and the USSR to
 halt nuclear tests and to dis-
 arm, is intended to increase
 suspicion of Western moves to
 strengthen and unify NATO and
 to add to neutralist pressure
 on the West for immediate sus-
 pension of nuclear tests.   The
 message, which  praises India
 and  Nehru  for their  work as
 "world  peacemaker," like the
 note'to Japan on 5  December
 asking support for a test ban,
 seeks to focus critical Asian
 attention on the Soviet proposal
 to halt nuclear testing as of
 next month.
 In other moves timed to
 inhibit decision and action at
 the NATO meeting, top Soviet
 leaders stated privately to
 Western ambassadors during the
 past two weeks that the USSR
 is willing to conclude a general
 settlement of East-West prob-
 lems on the basis of the status
 quo and a guarantee of existing
 boundaries and political systems.
 On 3 December Khrushchev argued
 with a group of ambassadors that
 the West should recognize the
 status quo in Eastern Europe
 and should give up its "hopes"
 of changing Communist regimes
 in exchange for Soviet agreement
 not to attempt to change  the
 system of"government in capital-
 ist countries.
 In a conversation with the
 Swiss ambassador the next day,
 Bulganin stated that Khrushchev
 intended to allay Western fears
 regarding the contradiction be-
 tween the USSR's policy of peace-
 ful coexistence, and the 21 No-
 vember  Communist  bloc  unity
 declaration which urged a broad
 front of all "progressive" ele-
 ments to overcome the forces of
 "aggression and reaction."
 Elaborating on Khrushchev's
 remarks, Bulganin stated that
 the Soviet Union is prepared
 to give assurances, on a recip-
 rocal basis, against interven-
 tion in the affairs of capital-
 ist countries and denied that
 Moscow is engaging in "sputnik
 diplomacy."  He claimed that
 the USSR is now on a techno-
 logical level with the West and
 that this should encourage ac-
 ceptance of the status  quo.
 Presidium member Mikoyan took
 the same line in a conversation
 with the Swiss ambassador on 7
 December, stating that Soviet
 success in establishing tech-
 nological "parity" should facil-
 itate political discussion be-
 tween the USSR and the West,
 inasmuch as the USSR formerly
 suffered from an inferiority
 complex which impeded negotia-
 tions.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 THE NATO MEETING
 On the eve of the       NATO
 meeting, Continental European
 members are stepping up their
 campaign to impress      on    the
 United States their  intention
 to proceed with closer military
 cooperation among themselves,
 especially if satisfactory
 NATO-wide measures fail to de-
 velop.   British-Continental
 differences have been  high-
 lighted by the impasse between
 London and Bonn over support-
 cost payments for British troops
 in West Germany.  Among non-
 NATO members in the free world,
 only Japan has officially indi-
 cated a desire to be included
 in any new arrangements for ex-
 panded cooperation.
 There is increasing inter-
 est in some measure of military
 integration similar to  the
 abortive European Defense Commu-
 nity.   Several sources report
 that France has formally pre-
 sented Germany, Italy, and the
 Benelux countries with a spe-
 cific plan for six-nation inte-
 gration on research, develop-
 ment, and production of modern
 weapons.
 This implies an expansion
 of integration along the lines
 of EURATOM and the Common Mar-
 ket, and a rejection of WEU, of
 which Britain is a member.   Any
 decision by the Continental NATO
 members to push any exclusive
 arrangement would raise per-
 plexing problems for the Euro-
 pean integration movement it-
 self.   Dutch officials,  for
 example, have said that the
 Netherlands could not afford to
 remain outside such arrangements,
 but are concerned over the emer-
 gence of "uncoordinated Euro-      25X1
 pean sectionalism."
 Ipr oc eed-
 ing to develop nuclear weapons.
 A succession of recent public
 and private  statements  seem
 calculated to stress France's
 determination not to accept a
 secondary place in the alliance.
 German Foreign Minister
 Brentano's visit to London on
 4 and 5 December failed to over-
 come the support-cost impasse
 caused by Bonn's refusal to con-
 tinue contributing to the local
 costs of British forces after
 March 1958.   London has asked
 for $140,000,000 and has already
 invoked NATO and WEU provisions
 concerning financial distress
 connected with stationing of
 forces in member countries.
 Britain has said that it
 intends to maintain a 55,000-man
 force in Germany if acceptable
 financial arrangements can be
 made; otherwise the "whole ques-
 tion of the number of troops"
 will have to be reconsidered.
 This is apparently an attempt
 to play on Continental concern
 that Britain may withdraw all
 its troops from Europe--a con-
 cern which London knows indi-
 rectly contributes to anxiety
 over the continuation of the
 American commitment in Europe.
 Bonn shows more determina-
 tion on the support-cost issue
 than in previous years, when it
 has compromised.  West German
 government leaders evidently
 believe that British military

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 December 1957
 withdrawal from the Continent
 would have its advantages.  They
 are probably convinced that Ger-
 man security is best ensured by
 German forces, and by the com-
 mon European production of mod-
 ern weapons, which would ulti-
 mately lead to creation of
 stronger "shield" forces armed
 with tactical nuclear weapons
 under European control.
 Turkey approaches the NATO
 conference with continuing con-
 cern over the situation in Syria,
 but confidently anticipating the
 early receipt of American guided
 missiles and rockets to bolster
 the Turkish army.  The Turkish
 delegation will represent the
 interests of friendly Middle
 East countries and will seek a
 clarification of the relation-
 ship between NATO and the Bagh-
 dad pact.
 Outside of the NATO area,
 interest in the forthcoming
 meeting has been spotty.  The
 Japanese government told Ambas-
 sador MacArthur in late November
 that it hoped means could be
 found to associate Japan with
 "appropriate" aspects of pro-
 grams developed at the meeting--
 probably meaning any arrange-
 ments for distribution of modern
 weapons and exchange of military
 information.   In Southeast Asia,
 Djakarta fears the meeting may
 suggest general NATO support
 for the Dutch position regarding
 New Guinea.
 Officials of the Moslem
 members of the Baghdad pact met
 in Ankara on 10 December for
 policy talks concerning the con-
 ference, and some of the Arab
 countries have apparently sent
 memoranda to guide the Turkish
 delegation in discussions per-
 taining to the Middle East.
 Israeli leaders hope for the
 formation of some link between
 Israel and NATO that could lead
 to a guarantee of Israeli fron-
 tiers.
 Interest in Latin America
 has been slight, but Peruvian
 President Prado publicly urged
 a linking of NATO and OAS, and
 the Brazilian foreign minister
 has stated that his country
 would like to join NATO if in-
 vited.
 Latest cress reports on the
 ~zdonesian situation state that
 a triumvirate composed of former
 Vice President Hatta, Premier
 Djuanda, and Army Chief of Staff
 Nasution has taken over the gov-
 ernment from President Sukarno.
 These reports also state that
 fighting has broken out in Dja-
 karta..
 According to earlier in-
 formation, army leaves had been
 canceled, troops were confined
 to barracks, and officers were
 wearing battle dress.  Premier
 Djuanda was also reported to
 have told parliament that Sukarno
 is taking a "medical leave" and
 would go to a "friendly country"
 --probably India.
 A coup against Sukarno
 would have been precipitated for
 a number of reasons, chief of
 which would be the rapidly de-
 teriorating political and eco-
 nomic situation in Java result-
 ing from the government-sponsored
 anti-Dutch campaign which has

 been in progress since 2 Decem-
 ber.  Hatta, Djuanda, and Nasu-
 tion may have felt that unless
 drastic measures were taken to
 retrieve the situation, the end
 result would be Communist domi-
 nation of Java and the fragmen-
 tation of the Indonesian repub-
 lic.   In this connection, Suma-
 tra is already said to have de-
 clared its independence, but any
 such action would probably be
 rescinded if an effective mod-
 erate government should estab-
 lish itself in Djakarta.
 Previously the military
 commander in Central Sumatra
 had taken steps to protect for-
 eign business in his area and
 to retain all revenues which
 previously had gone to Djakarta.
 The South Sumatran commander
 had also assured local business-
 men that the Dutch in the prov-
 ince would be protected.
 Prior to the reported ac-
 tion against Sukarno, the anti-
 Dutch campaign had continued
 unabated.  Affiliates of SOBSI,
 the Communist-dominated labor
 federation, usually seized a
 firm, and then the government
 took over from SOBSI.   SOBSI,
 however, had retained consider-
 able influence in administering
 many of these companies through
 "labor assistance teams."
 The anti-Dutch drive has
 also been expanded to North Su-
 matra, the only area in Sumatra
 under direct Djakarta control.
 The army commander there, how-
 ever, has taken the precaution
 of placing all Dutch enterprises
 under military control, appar-
 ently in the hope of preventing
 SOBSI activity similar to that
 in Java.   Isolated and unoff i-
 cial seizures of Dutch interests
 have been reported from Palem-
 bang in South Sumatra and Makas-
 sar in Celebes.   In both cities,
 SOBSI affiliates predominate
 among organized labor.
 President Sukarno on 11
 December made his first public
 statement since the initiation
 of the harsh measures against
 the Dutch, indicated his ap-
 proval of the campaign, and
 stated there would be no compro-
 mise or letup in the pressure
 to force the Dutch to surrender
 Irian.
 Soviet bloc countries, mean-
 while, had offered to replace
 Dutch personnel.  East Germany
 volunteered to replace the Dutch
 "in all fields," and Poland
 offered shipping and technical
 personnel.
 Dutch reaction to the Indo-
 nesian campaign has been moti-
 vated by a desire not to pre-
 clude all possibility of eventu-
 ally retrieving some interests.
 Nevertheless, at an emergency
 meeting of the North Atlantic
 Council on 7 December called by
 the Dutch, their representative
 declared that Indonesia is an
 "acid test of NATO cooperation,"
 and warned that the issue would
 be raised at the mid-December
 NATO meeting if the picture had
 not improved by that time.
 Dutch Minister of Defense
 Staf has told Ambassador Young,
 moreover,  that if Holland's
 NATO partners fail to "rise to
 the test" there will be an in-
 evitable Dutch revulsion against
 NATO,, resulting in defense cut-
 backs and the reduction of the
 Netherlands' role in NATO to
 something like that of Norway's
 or Denmark's.

 tant to place any value on its

 commercial holdings in Indonesia
 but accepts unofficial estimates
 that they account for 3 percent
 of the Netherlands' national in-
 come..  Accordingly, the Ministry
 of Finance estimates that the
 uncompensated loss of their
 $1-2 billion investment would
 be serious, but not calamitous.
 The Dutch may, however, find
 difficulty in integrating ref-
 ugees into the Dutch economy;
 many of them have never lived
 in the homeland.  Housing is
 certain to be a serious problem.
 The Dutch are aware that
 Indonesian pressure is in part
 designed to promote bilateral
 negotiations on New Guinea, and
 the government has had some
 pressure from Dutch business
 interests, both in the Nether-
 lands and in Indonesia, to
 modify its stand.  Ambassador
 Young, however, believes Prime
 Minister Drees has already def-
 initely rejected their appeals,
 and in view of the participation
 in his coalition government of
 some parties which think there
 should be no sacrifice of prin-
 ciple for the sake of "sordid
 business interests," there is
 little possibility of a revision
 of this stand.                       25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 December 1957
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 SUPREME SOVIET MEETING
 The session of the USSR
 Supreme Soviet scheduled to be-
 gin on 19 December will prob-
 ably be devoted to the routine
 annual approval of the 1958
 budget and,  following the prec-
 edent set last February of pre-
 senting the annual   economic
 plan to the Supreme Soviet,  to
 discussing and approving the
 1958 economic plan.   The Soviet
 leaders may also consider the
 time ripe for another report on
 the international situation and
 Soviet foreign policy.
 The 1958 budget and plan
 will probably refct a continu-
 ation of present policies and
 trends without any drastic al-
 terations,  since the new system
 of regional administration of
 the   economy is   still being
 shaken dowel and Soviet planners
 are prepaxling a new seven-year
 plan to begin in 1959. However,
 in the 1958 budget   and plan,
 serious attention must again be
 devoted to housing and other
 consumer programs--important as
 incentives for increased pro-
 duction--and to improving the
 supply of raw materials.   Raw
 materials extraction problems
 have since early 1956 become an
 important curb on the speed of
 industrial growth.
 An appraisal of the first
 six months of operation of the
 new regional councils of  na-
 tional economy (sovnarkhozy)
 may be made at the Supreme So-
 viet.   While preliminary esti-
 mates of industrial output for
 the period indicate moderate
 overfulfillment of the modest
 1957 plan, they do not appear
 to meet the optimistic expecta-
 tions voiced by Khrushchev and'
 others last spring. The reorgan-
 ization itself will probably not
 be attacked,  however,  but there
 is some possibility that minor
 changes may be  made in the
 sovnarkhoz system--for example,
 an attempt to simplify coordi-
 nation problems by reducing the
 number of economic-administra-
 tive regions.
 The timing of the Supreme
 Soviet session--just after the
 scheduled close of the Paris
 NATO conference--may well have
 been arranged with a view to
 providing the Kremlin with a
 suitable occasion for reviewing
 recent Soviet foreign policy
 developments.   The proposals
 suggested in the Bulganin let-
 ters to President Eisenhower..
 and the heads of other princi-
 pal NATO governments would prob-
 ably form the basis of such a
 review (see Part I, page 1).
 Moves designed to counter the
 effects of any decisions at
 Paris may be announced, with
 the most likely countermove to
 any military strengthening of
 NATO being a bolstering of the
 Warsaw pact.   On 21 November,
 Khrushchev warned that specific
 measures. to increase the mili-
 tary potential of Moscow's War-
 saw pact allies would depend on
 the outcome of the NATO meeting.
 Changes in high-level gov-
 ernment personnel assignments,
 a function of the Supreme So-
 viet, might be made at   this
 session.   However, "westerners

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 December 1957
 Regular Moroccan army troops
 stationed near the Spanish pos-
 sessions, while avoiding any
 formal involvement, are prob-
 ably providing important logis-
 tical support and may be more
 directly engaged in the affair.
 Spanish concern over de-
 velopments in the Ifni area is
 also reflected in a recent re-
 quest for French support.  The
 French embassy in Rabat has
 stated,  however,  that France
 would not furnish direct mili-
 tary assistance within Morocco
 but may cooperate in the Saha-
 ran regions outside Morocco and
 Ifni.  The withdrawals recently
 ordered by Spain in this area
 probably increase the likeli-
 hood of such collaboration by
 France, which is concerned about
 Moroccan nationalist preten-
 sions to Mauritania and the ex-
 treme western triangle of Al-
 geria.
 Spain may attempt to solve
 the Ifni problem through early
 direct talks with Moroccan King
 Mohamed V, who is scheduled to
 return from his visit to the
 United States this week end.
 Madrid is apparently prepared
 to negotiate an adjustment of
 the enclave's frontiers but
 not to surrender the area en-
 tirely.   Such a surrender, it
 is feared, would make it more
 difficult for Spain to retain
 possession of its  other  ter-
 ritories in the area.
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 Syria
 Syria this week announced
 it would no longer cooperate
 with the chairman of the Is-
 raeli-Syrian Mixed Armistice
 Commission, a Norwegian officer
 assigned to the UN truce team
 in Palestine.  Part of the prob-
 lem in this case seems to have
 arisen out of UN Secretary Gen-
 eral Hammarskjold's discussions
 in Damascus last week, when he
 is reported to have told the
 Syrians that the question of
 Israel's de facto occupation
 of the demilitarized zones might
 better be taken up by the local
 truce machinery than submitted
 to the UN Security Council.  The
 Syrians apparently  took  the
 first opportunity to follow his
 advice, but claim to have been
 balked by the Norwegian of-
 ficer.  The real issue involved
 may be a Syrian fear that too
 ?ublicity had accompanied
 recent relatively amicable bor-
 der talks with the Israelis,
 and that this must be countered
 by-some unfriendly gesture.
 Khalid al-Azm, already
 Syria's defense minister, act-
 ing finance minister, and chair-
 man of the economic development
 board, this week became deputy
 prime minister as well.   He will
 probably gain still another
 boost to his growing prestige
 from his trip to Moscow, where
 he arrived on 10 December after
 a brief stopover in Hungary.
 Azm is heading a 25-man delega-
 tion to follow up the Syrian-
 Soviet economic accord which
 he helped negotiate last August.
 In addition to presenting the
 Soviet authorities with a list
 of the specific projects Syria
 wishes to undertake, Azm may
 seek to modify the repayment
 terms in order to make them con-
 form more closely to  those

 probably not very well founded,
 that Nasir might launch an anti

 treatment given his sovereign
 by Egyptian propaganda media--
 the Egyptians failed to broad-
 cast a recording the ambassador
 had made for the fourth anni-
 versary of King Saud's accession.
 According to the ambassador,
 "the trguble with Egyptians is
 that they have no gratitude."
 Meanwhile the meeting between
 King Faysal of Iraq and King
 Saud in Riyadh seems to have
 gone off smoothly,  but the only
 tangible result known thus far
 is a "cultural" agreement.

 Nasir's speech on 6 Decem-

 out to be a banal rehearsal of

 effort to minimize Iran's eco-

 tary, attachments to the West.
 The Shah warns that if such of-
 fers are published, he may be
 forced to accept them to satisfy
 the Iranian people in the ab-
 sence of increased American aid.
 While the Shah has many
 ties with the United States which
 would deter him from reorienting
 his foreign policy,  he could come
 under increasing Soviet influence
 either inadvertently through a
 rapid expansion of   economic
 relations with the USSR or by
 ultimately becoming convinced,
 as a result of intensive Soviet
 propaganda, that the power of
 the USSR is such that he must
 do business with it.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 December 1957
 The resignation on 11 De-
 cember of Prime Minister Chun-
 drigar's government in Pakistan
 is a blow to President Mirza's
 political prestige and consti-
 tutes the most difficult prob-
 lem he has faced since assuming
 the presidency.  With the break-
 up of the uneasy coalition he
 promoted between his Republican
 party and Chundrigar's Moslem
 League in October, Mirza is at
 present  confronted  with  the
 choice of allowing a new coali-
 tion government to be formed by
 politicians who have repudiated
 his leadership or of resorting
 to direct authoritarian rule.
 The  latter  meeting  re-
 sulted in a statement reported-
 ly signed by 52 assembly mem-
 bers, well over a majority,
 declaring they would support
 no government formed by Chun-
 drigar or any other Moslem
 League leader but would accept
 a person nominated by Than
 Sahib.  These developments seem
 to indicate that Chundrigar's
 current attempt will fail,
 leaving Mirza with no parlia-
 mentary alternative but to sanc-
 tion a new coalition favoring
 early elections under the pres-
 ent joint system.
 Chundrigar;resigned after
 being informed by the spokesman
 of the Republican party, Dr.
 Than Sahib, that the Republicans
 could not agree to back the Mos-
 lem League's plan to pass a bill
 restoring the system of separate
 communal electorates during a
 special session of the National
 Assembly scheduled for 11 Decem-
 ber.  Mirza then postponed the
 assembly session for three weeks,
 asked Chundrigar to continue in
 office, and commissioned him to
 try to form a new government.
 Maneuvering which followed
 the government's resignation ap-
 parently,  produced a division of
 various political groups into
 two opposing camps.  The Moslem
 League and remnants of the out-
 going coalition consulted with
 Chundrigar, while Republican,
 Awami League, and leftist Na-
 tional Awami party assemblymen,
 and several splinter and minori-
 ty groups met with Than Sahib.
 The Republican challenge
 to Mirza, who  has  sponsored
 the party since its inception
 in 1955, will demonstrate his
 present inability to control
 his   followers in a: showdown
 and is likely to  weaken sub-
 stantially his                                                                     position in
 the political arena.   Mirza may
 be restrained from resorting
 to  authoritarian rule by re-
 cent evidence of a decline in
 the support he has enjoyed
 among such elements as the army,
 the civil service, and certain
 political quarters.
 The political instability
 in Pakistan  has already re-
 sulted  in a                                                                   request  that
 Afghan King  Zahir  Than post-
 pone  indefinitely his  visit
 to    Karachi.  This postpone-
 ment  will impede  further
 progress  toward  a  transit
 agreement,   an increase  in
 trade, and settlement  of the
 Pushtoonistan   issue.

 12 December 1957
 SOVIET LEADERS SPARK DOMESTIC CAMPAIGN ON COMMUNIST CONFERENCES
 Most members of the top
 Soviet leadership have been en-
 gaged in a campaign throughout
 the USSR since 26 November, to
 present the results of the re-
 cent Moscow conferences to the
 Soviet population as a major
 achievement in intrabloc and
 international diplomacy and to
 remove whatever doubts may have
 arisen since the 20th party con-
 gress  about bloc unity.   The
 success claimed for the con-
 ferences is being linked with
 assertions of Soviet industrial
 achievement and technological
 superiority as part of an effort
 to elicit popular support and
 enthusiasm for the regime.
 Since the campaign began,
 Khrushchev, Furtseva, and Pos-
 pelov have addressed meetings
 in Moscow, while several of
 their fellow party presidium
 members have presided at gather-
 ings in their provincial baili-
 wicks.   Of the full members of
 the presidium, Kozlov has spoken
 in Leningrad, Ignatov in Gorkiy,
 and Kirichenko in Kiev; of the
 candidate members, Kirilenko has
 spoken in Sverdlovsk, Kalnberzn
 in Riga, Mukhitdinov in Tashkent,
 and Mzhavanadze  in  Tbilisi.
 Kuusinen and Shvernik, full
 members of the presidium, and
 candidate member Pospelov were
 on hand to do the honors in Es-
 tonia, Lithuania, and Novosi-
 birsk, respectively, where the
 party chiefs are not presidium
 members.
 Mikhail Suslov discussed
 the results of the Moscow con-
 ferences in Rostov on 2 December
 and in Voronezh on 4 December.
 His extended stay suggests that
 he may also have been involved
 in the administrative changes
 resulting from the recent aboli-
 tion of two oblasts in this area.
 Having attained a higher status
 in the party presidium as a re-
 sult of the purges in June and
 October, Suslov now may be taking
 on new responsibilities in inter-
 nal affairs in addition to his
 duties of supervising relations
 with the satellites and  other
 Communist parties.
 Bulganin, Mikoyan, Brezh-
 nev, and Belyayev are apparently
 occupied with other affairs in
 Moscow and have not thus far
 participated in the nationwide
 campaign.   Presidium member Aris-
 tov, who returned to Moscow
 shortly before the 40th anniver-
 sary celebration from a special
 Far Eastern trip, has not been
 mentioned publicly since 8 No-
 vember and did not participate
 in the discussions with for-
 eign Communist leaders.
 The campaign's keynote of
 self-confidence and optimism was
 sounded in Moscow by Furtseva,
 who claimed that the Communist
 meetings marked a strengthening
 of bloc unity and  assured the
 international Communist movement
 of continued success. Kirichenko,
 speaking in Kiev, declared that
 "the socialist system has proved
 its superiority over capitalism,
 not only by the tempo of econom-
 ic development and material re-
 sources, but also by the level
 of science and technology."
 To supplement the efforts
 of the Soviet leaders, the cam-
 paign now is being extended to
 lower levels, as   local party
 officials have begun to report
 to meetings organized in raions,
 factories,   and  villages.

 NEW SOVIET LONG-RANGE ATOMIC CANNON
 Two new self-propelled guns
 were displayed at last month's
 40th anniversary parade in Mos-
 cow.                   It is estimated that one
 of the weapons could fire a
 390-pound ram-jet-powered,  high-
 explosive projectile to a range
 of some 200 miles and an atomic
 warhead to a range of some 30
 miles,  while the other could
 fire an atomic round to about
 90 miles.   The accuracy of these
 weapons is believed to compare
 favorably with guided-missile
 delivery systems of similar
 range.   While these weapons may
 be experimental models intro-

 EAST GERMAN REGIME STEPS UP ATTACKS ON EVANGELICAL CHURCH
 As part of its renewed
 policy of repression, the East
 German regime has stepped up
 its program to force the German
 Evangelical Church to separate
 into eastern and western branches.
 Recent press attacks, arrests
 of church officials,  and re-
 striction of church functions
 have characterized this latest
 effort.   The regime hopes to
 reduce the influence of the
 church in East Germany as a
 rallying point for resistance
 to communization.  Persecution
 of the church, however, will
 probably add to the already
 strong resentment of the regime
 in East Germany.
 Editorials in the Social-
 ist Unity (Communist) party
 (SED) newspaper Neues Deutsch-
 land on 4 and 6    cem ez' set
 the tone of the attacks,  charg-
 ing that the church is in ef-
 fect an adjunct of NATO and
 supports aggressive measures
 against East Germany.   The sole
 requirement for the relaxation
 of tensions was said to be that
 church officers stop executing
 the orders of the Western "mili-
 tary church" and its chief,'
 Bishop Dibelius.   In other Com-
 munist newspapers, the church
 has been described as "anti-
 socialist," "antidemocratic"
 and a "hotbed of reaction."
 Several ministers refusing
 church burials to nonchurch
 members, particularly Communists
 and members of their families,
 have been subjected to vicious
 attacks by the press and by
 Communist organizations.   Church
 officials have been arrested on
 such charges as denial of church
 burials, currency and goods
 smuggling, and "incitement to
 antistate activity."   Communist-
 inspired protest meetings in a
 number of areas have demanded
 that action be taken against
 offending pastors.
 The most severe sentence
 yet given a churchman was the
 five-year prison term recently
 imposed on the student pastor
 at Leipzig University for al-
 leged antistate crimes, includ-
 ing opposition to the Communist
 youth dedication ceremony, con-
 tact with West German church
 groups, urging a general strike
 during the Hungarian uprising,
 and "slander against the state."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 December 1957
 The puppet eastern Chris-
 tian  Democratic Union (CDU),
 in its strongest opposition to
 the church, recently came out
 in support of the Communists,
 recommending state control of
 church finances in order  to
 avoid "strengthening reaction-
 ary circles  in  the                 church
 leadership."  The policy en-
 dorsed by the CDU would mean
 that state subsidies would be
 paid directly to  individual
 pastors, bypassing the central
 church organization, and would
 leave pastors open to greater
 pressures to conform to regime
 demands.
 The militant opposition
 of the church indicates that it
 will remain a strong anti-Commu-
 nist factor in  East  Germany.
 The popular will to resist Com-
 munist pressures is strong, and
 many East Germans,  even some who
 are not devout Christians, be-
 lieve the government is invading
 an area of conscience where it
 has no right to intrude. Bishop
 Dibelius, preaching in East Ber-
 lin on 1 December, defied the
 regime and called on the people
 to reject Communism.   The church
 synod on 6 December stated that
 it is impossible for Christians
 to believe in God and Communism
 simultaneously, and adopted a
 resolution to the effect that
 "not even fear must  drive us
 to acknowled    such a concept."
 PEIPING SETS NEW ECONOMIC GOALS
 Communist China's long-
 range planning chief Li Fu-chun
 has asserted that China will
 surpass Great Britain in the
 production of steel and other
 industrial items by 1972 and
 that some industrial targets
 for the Second Five-Year Plan
 (1958-62)  will be raised. After
 a year of relative caution, Pei-
 ping seems once again to be pro-
 ceeding with increased confi-
 dence brought on by the suc-
 cess of the First Five-Year
 Plan (1953-57) and,  perhaps,  by
 the results of recent talks held
 in Moscow.   In the case of agri-
 culture, however, the confidence
 is somewhat tempered,,and the
 original ambitious targets for
 major crops in 1962 have been
 lowered.
 Li Fu-chun told a trade
 union congress in Peiping that
 by 1972 China would be produc-
 ing 35,000,000-40,000,000 tons
 of steel, an amount,  he said,
 Great Britain will find diffi-
 cult to match even if the "in-
 evitable" capitalist depression
 is not taken into account. Li
 also assured his listeners that
 China can in the same period
 surpass Britain in the produc-
 tion of coal, machine tools,
 cement, and chemical fertilizer.
 Discussing the Second Five-
 Year Plan, Li said the principles
 proposed by the party central
 committee in September 1956
 "remain the principles to which
 we must conform."  Li reiterated
 that heavy industry is the "core"
 of economic construction and the
 "material basis" of all econom-
 ic advance.   He acknowledged
 that experience gained since the
 party congress had increased
 Peiping's "understanding of eco-
 nomic conditions" and led to
 certain adjustments in the "tasks
 and targets" proposed.  Although
 not all targets have yet been
 finalized, some industrial goals

 Li reviewed the achieve-
 ments of the regime's highly
 successful First Five-Year Plan.
 The total value of industrial
 production more than doubled,
 and 57 of the vital 156 Soviet-
 aid industrial projects were
 completed.   The industrial base
 in the Northeast, centered
 around Anshan, was "basically
 completed," suggesting that the
 bulk of construction activity
 in the future will shift else-
 where.   The only major indus--
 trial item which fell short of
 programed levels was petroleum,
 the output of which will reach
 only 1,500,000 tons this year
 as compared with the over 2,-
 000,000 tons called for in the
 plan.   In addition, Li announced
 that the initial 5,000,000-6,-
 000,000-ton petroleum target
 for the Second Five-Year Plan
 had been lowered.
 Li quoted initial estimates
 that the 1957 food-grain produc-
 tion had reached 185,000,000
 tons, 2,500,000 tons over last
 year.   For the first time since
 the Communists came to power,
 the percentage increase in food-
 grain production was less than
 the percentage increase in popu-
 lation.   Li said, as have Chi-
 nese Communist commentators for
 the past year,  that more atten-
 tion must be paid to agriculture.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 EXPULSION OF PARTY RIGHTISTS EXPECTED IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 A statement last week by
 An Tzu-wen, a key figure in
 Chinese Communist  party  per-
 sonnel  matters, strengthens
 previous indications that the
 party is headed for a vigorous
 weeding out.   Peiping is ex-
 pected to announce plans for
 punishing rightists and other
 "undesirable" elements--pos-'
 sibly including some central
 committee members--at the next
 party congress, which regime
 spokesmen have said will be
 held soon.
 An has recently been iden-
 tified as head of the party's
 organization department, which
 is responsible for recruiting
 and assigning most of the par-
 ty membership.   In a 5 Decem-
 ber article in People's Daily,
 the organ of the central com-
 mittee, An noted that 810,000
 party and government workers
 have been relieved of their
 posts in 1957 and sent to do
 "productive" work at lower
 levels.   He promised that addi-
 tional measures would be taken
 to "raise the Marxist-Leninist
 and vocational levels of offi-
 cials."
 Persons identified as
 rightists will probably be the
 first to feel the full weight.
 of party displeasure.   Writing
 in the People's Daily last
 September, An said that  al-
 though rightists within the
 party were small in number,
 their presence  seriously en-
 dangered the undertakings of
 the party.   Teng Hsiao-ping,
 secretary general of the party
 and An's chief, made the same
 point in a major report to the
 central committee plenum on
 23 September.
 Peiping has publicly at-
 tacked only about 60 party mem-
 bers--all minor figures--as
 rightists.   However,  the re-
 gime's admission that more than
 100 party rightists have been
 uncovered in Peiping and in An-
 hwei Province alone shows that
 rightist activity in party ranks
 has been much more extensive
 than the number of named of-
 fenders would suggest.
 to the campaign.
 On 5 December Peiping ended
 a lull in publicity concerning
 the antirightist campaign with
 the announcement that Wang Han,
 a middle-level party and gov-
 ernment official, had been ex-
 posed as a rightist.   Wang, a
 veteran Communist of 25 years'
 service, is a vice minister in
 the Ministry of Supervision and
 an alternate member of the par-
 ty control commission.   Higher
 level officials than Wang are
 likely to be involved before
 the campaign ends.  The demotion
 or expulsion of one or two mem-
 bers of the central committee--
 several of whom have been un-
 explainably out of the news--
 would provide a suitable climax
 NORTH KOREA MAKES NEW PEACE OVERTURES TO SOUTH

 Korea of Chinese Communist as
 well as American forces.
 In support of his moderate
 position, Kim asked, "Why can-
 not one people, living in the
 same country, freely travel
 north and south and exchange
 goods and even letters?"  He
 proposed unsealing the armi-
 stice line to permit North-
 South trade, and offered to pro-
 vide the South with electricity
 and industrial products and to
 permit fishing off the North
 Korean coast.   He avoided men-
 tioning, however, the recently
 adopted UN resolution for uni-
 fication through the holding
 of free elections supervised
 by the United Nations, and re-
 peated Pyongyang's line that
 unification should be solved
 by the "Korean people them-
 selves."
 The North Korean leaders
 remain adamant against unifica-
 tion based on general elections
 in which the South, with a popu-
 lation of 21,000,000, would
 have a marked advantage over
 the northern regime governing
 only 8,000,000 people.  They
 are displaying instead a "fra-
 ternal" willingness to deal
 directly with the authorities
 in the South on a de facto "two
 Koreas" basis.   Their failure
 to include candidates represent-
 ing southern constituencies in
 the elections last August for
 the Supreme People's Assembly
 indicates a realistic decision
 to drop their previous pretense
 of speaking for the entire Ko-
 rean populace.
 To intensify the impact of
 his proposals for North-South
 contacts, Kim II-sung has cou-
 pled them with propaganda ex-
 ploitation of recent incidents
 between American troops and
 Korean civilians.  He claimed
 that American "imperialist rule"
 has resulted in "unbearable
 suffering" for the populace and
 noted that the situation is now
 "ripe" for a unification drive
 in the South in the form of a
 national united front of various
 classes.  The American embassy
 in Seoul reported last month
 that Pyongyang's proposals for
 peaceful unification may have a
 wider acceptance among various seg-
 ments of. the South Korean populace
 than previously has been supposed.
 Pyongyang apparently is
 seeking to exploit this soft
 spot in President Rhee's anti-
 Communist front by stepping up
 its agent activity in the South
 to coincide with its propaganda
 effort.
 The results  of Japanese
 Prime Minister Kishi's second
 Asian tour, which also included
 visits to Australia and New Zea-

 apparently no major diplomatic

 had been wide speculation he
 would attempt to capitalize on
 a successful trip by holding
 early elections, but Kishi an-

 most pronounced, the Japanese
 prime minister achieved agree-
 ment in principle on two major
 problems of long standing--rep-
 arations for Indonesia and Jap-
 anese  pearl fishing rights off
 the Australian continental
 shelf. Only in the Philippines,
 where Kishi arrived on the anni-
 versary of the Japanese inva;
 sion and at a time when Japa-
 nese nationals there are in-
 volved in trade and travel dis-
 putes, did any unpleasantness
 occur.
 Kishi's second tour dif-
 fered markedly from his first
 trip last May.  At that time,
 he visited Asian countries with
 which Japan's relations were
 relatively friendly and  di-
 rected himself toward rallying
 Asian opinion on international
 issues such as cessation of nu-
 clear tests, Asian cooperation
 in the United Nations, and sup-
 port for a regional development
 fund.   On his second trip, Kishi
 visited the less friendly coun-
 tries and concentrated, first,
 on breaking down barriers of
 animosity and, second, on seek-
 ing solutions to bilateral prob-
 lems which have been impeding
 the development of closer eco-
 nomic relations.
 The most important result
 of the trip was the understand-
 ing reached with Indonesian Pre-
 mier Djuanda on reparations.
 They agreed that Japan would
 pay $223,000,000 in direct
 grants over 12 years, would can-
 cel Indonesia's $177,000,000
 trade debt to Japan, and would
 extend $400,000,000 in loans
 and investments.   Final details
 are to be worked out shortly.
 The understanding was greeted
 with mixed feelings in Japan--
 relief that the problem had
 been settled but concern about
 Japanese ability to pay such a
 large amount.  Apparently little
 progress was made toward a rep-
 arations settlement with South
 Vietnam.
 Although Kishi did not em-
 phasize his desire for a re-
 gional development fund on this
 trip, he did discuss it in gen-
 eral terms.   Indications are
 that he may be altering his
 thinking in favor of bilateral,
 ro'ect-b - ro'ect assistance.
 Elections on 15 December
 to fill 160 seats in Thailand's
 unicameral legislature are in-

 civilian facade behind which
 Marshal Sarit and his military

 the next government through its
 control of the 123 appointed

 The political orientation of
 the civilian elements with which
 the regime will have to work,
 however, will have some bearing

 Sarit's Unionist party 140.
 The left-wing Socialist Front,
 dominated by Thep Chotinuchit's
 Economist party, has 100 candi-

 Aphaiwong, who is a highly ar-
 ticulate and witty campaigner.
 The Unionists, who have made a
 fumbling attempt to adopt a
 middle-of-the-road policy between
 the Democrats and the Socialist
 Front, suffer from disunity
 and weak leadership,  but will
 profit from the public's knowl-
 edge that Sarit backs them. The
 Socialist Front is strong in
 the relatively underdeveloped
 northeast and, according to a
 recent report, may make gains
 in southern Thailand.
 The campaign has been rela-
 tively quiet.   Foreign policy,
 particularly Thailand's member-
 ship in SEATO, has been the
 principal issue.   The Democrats
 have strongly defended SEATO;
 the Unionists support it, but
 with less enthusiasm; and the So-
 cialist Front has attacked it,
 calling for a neutral foreign
 policy.   The elections may thus
 provide some measure of popular
 attitudes toward SEATO.  They
 may also give some insight in-
 to the degree of influence ex-
 ercised on public opinion by
 Bangkok's largely leftist press.
 The elections are a direct
 outgrowth of the Sarit-led 16
 September coup d'etat resulting
 in the ouster of Premier Phibun
 and Police Director  General
 Phao.   Almost immediately after
 the coup,  Sarit asked the King
 to dissolve the legislature,
 which had been elected amid
 charges of fraud last February.
 The elections this month
 are generally expected to be
 relatively free.   Because of
 his pose as the champion of
 government reform,  Sarit will
 be in a poor position to under-
 take illegal actions.   Moreover,
 the military probably feels it
 can afford to permit clean
 elections,   since  it will be
 able   to forge  a  workable
 coalition  with  the elements
 expected  to   win at the polls
 and   the 123 appointed members.

 Turkey and among the Turkish
 Cypriots.
 The Greek government,  fear-
 ing exploitation of the Cyprus
 issue by the opposition in Ath-
 ens, must remain firm on the
 issue in its public statements.
 Athens insists on an agreement
 bated on self-determination,
 not specifically prohibiting
 union of the island with Greece.
 The Greeks continue to hold to
 their position that Turkey is
 not a party to the Cyprus dis-
 pute and has no right to veto
 any solution agreed to between
 the British and the  Cypriots.
 In Turkey,  public and pri-
 vate statements by Turkish lead-
 ers show continued aggressive
 support for partition as the
 only solution to the Cyprus
 problem.   Ankara also continues
 to indicate a desire for an in-
 ternational conference to dis-
 cuss Cyprus.                                                                   It is wary,  how-
 ever, of proposals by NATO Sec-
 retary General Spaak, whom it
 considers opposed to partition.
 The British government
 seems principally interested
 in retaining maneuverability
 so that Governor Foot will have
 an opportunity to suggest a
 formula for solving the issue.
 Britain profe$ses reluctance to
 undertake discussions on self-
 government directly with the
 Cypriots until Greece and Tur-
 key agree on the island's ulti-
 mate disposition.
 At the UN, efforts leading
 to a compromise similar to last
 year's call for continued nego-
 tiations seem likely to succeed.
 The Greek foreign minister is
 aware that his resolution sup-
 porting self-determination can-
 not secure the necessary two-
 thirds vote.   Both he and Brit-
 ish representatives have indi-
 cated  willingness to accept
 a compromise.                            25X1

 because of the fear that the
 Communists were gaining support
 as a result of labor unrest.
 Opposition to Mollet is
 sparked  by Gaston  Deferre,
 head of the powerful Marseille
 Socialist federation, who.'is
 an able and highly respected
 politician.   Mollet has moved
 to avert the threat to his
 leadership by taking a line
 closer to Socialist doctrine.
 He forced Premier Gaillard to
 rescind certain scheduled price
 rises and to hike civil service
 salaries more than originally
 proposed.
 Mollet is vulnerable,  how-
 ever,  to attack on his associa-
 tion with the present Algerian
 policy,  and may hope to avoid
 open conflict by pushing through
 a nebulous resolution support-
 ing the basic statute.   He may
 also feel obliged to dissociate
 his party from the pacification
 program by working for the
 resignation of Robert Lacoste
 as minister for Algeria.   Such
 a move would make it impossible
 for Gaillard to resolve differ-
 ences between the Socialists
 and proponents of a firm Al-
 gerian policy.
 There is a growing fear
 that Socialist-Communist coopera-
 tion might develop if Deferre's
 wing of the party wins control,
 even though he himself is.like-
 ly to oppose collaboration with
 the Communists.   The moderate
 tone of a recent assembly
 speech by a leading Communist
 deputy made a favorable impres-
 sion on many Socialists and on
 members of the: small center
 groups in the assembly.   The
 Communists have stepped up
 their efforts to establish a
 common ground with the Social-
 ists.   They hope to exploit
 this line further by supporting
 the complaints of French ex-
 cesses against due process of
 law in Algeria that Mollet is
 expected to make at the Social-
 ist party meeting.   The So-
 cialists are still far 'from con-
 sidering a "popular front,"
 but they may be pushed closer
 to the Communists if the gov-
 ernment applies stringent eco-
 nomic austerit  measures.

 The authoritarian Perez
 regime,   which    is  generally
 friendly  toward  the     United
 States and favorable in its
 treatment of foreign capital,
 postponed decisions on the form
 and timing of the election as
 long as practicable.   The pleb-

 against Perez and an official
 slate of congressional deputies.
 Campaign activity is prohib-

 The government has imple-

 against violence.   Rafael Cal-
 dera,                   head of the principal
 legal opposition party and con-

 opposition leaders and the for-
 merly powerful national guard
 commander, who reportedly har-
 bored presidential ambitions,
 have been arrested or gone in-
 to exile.   Perez' reluctance
 to risk a free election appar-
 ently. stems largely from mili-
 tary ;,pressures against such a
 contest and his inability to
 command a majority of the popu-
 lar vote.
 Because the armed forces
 have remained loyal   to Perez

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 MOSCOW CONFERENCE OF WORLD COMMUNIST LEADERS
 The primary Soviet objec-
 tives at the Moscow conferences
 of world Communist leaders in
 November were to reassert the
 USSR's leadership of the Com-
 munist bloc and to reinforce
 bloc unity.  These  aims_ re-
 quired some formulations in
 the communiqu6 and manifesto
 which evaded rather than re-
 solved difficult issues.  Mao
 Tse-tung's endorsement of the
 USSR's leading position indi-
 cates a marked advance in the
 reaffirmation of Soviet primacy,
 but subsequent statements by
 Gomulka, combined with the fail-
 ure of Yugoslavia to sign the
 12-nation communiqu6,'point to
 the continued existence of
 divergencies  in:',the  Commu-
 nist world.
 The Soviet leadership will
 continue to be faced with the
 problem that has plagued So-
 viet policy toward the satel-
 lites ever since the summer of
 1956;   how to restore bloc
 stability and at the same time
 retain the vitality which pq
 Stalin policies were designed
 to give to the Communist move-
 ment.
 ties   and  populations for
 greater liberalization.
 Soviet efforts in 1957 to
 re-establish bloc stability
 were complicated by certain
 Chinese Communist actions which
 were interpreted by Gomulka and
 other Communists in Eastern
 Europe as supporting their de-
 sires for increased independence
 of Moscow.
 By the summer of 1957, how-
 ever, both Tito and Gomulka,
 thoroughly disturbed by the
 threat which the Hungarian revo-
 lution had posed to all Commu-
 nist states, and presumably con-
 vinced that  the USSR intended
 to pursue a gradual policy of
 relaxation in Eastern Europe,
 appear to have reached agree-
 ment with Khrushchev to support
 a policy designed to restore
 stability ..in, the.  bloc  and
 strengthen the individual satel-
 lite parties.  The two independ-
 ent  Ecifmunist leaders apparent-
 ly consented :to.. stress                                                            the
 areas of agreement within the
 Communist world and to end pub-
 lic discussions of their differ-
 ences.
 Preconference Developments
 For the past year, the
 USSR has been striving to re-
 store the stability of Eastern
 Europe which was seriously
 shaken by the Hungarian revolu-
 tion and the emergence of Go-
 mulka in Poland in October 1956.
 These crises had been stimu-
 lated by Moscow's post-Stalin-
 ist policy of reducing its di-
 rect control of the satellites
 and making up with Tito.  The
 20th party congress endorse-
 ment of independent paths to
 socialism and the subsequent
 rehabilitation  of  "national
 Communist"  victims throughout
 Eastern Europe encouraged de-
 mands within the satellite par-
 This appearance of Commu-
 nist solidarity was punctured,
 however, by Tito's failure to

 this control through more numer-
 ous multilateral and bilateral
 meetings and by a new Communist
 ideological journal.
 Moscow is still, however,
 paying lip service at least to
 the principle that each satel-
 lite shall have a degree of
 autonomy in its internal  af-
 fairs.  This is clearly sug-
 gested by the statement that
 "national peculiarities" must
 be taken into consideration,
 but not exaggerated.  Outright
 imitation of the USSR, more-
 over, is specifically ruled out
 by the declaration.   On the im-
 portant question of determining
 internal dangers to party unity,
 the declaration presents "re-
 visionism"--pressures for great-
 er liberalization--as the;great-
 er danger at present, as opposed
 to "dogmatism"--Stalinism--but
 permits each party to determine
 for itself which is the greater
 danger at any particular time.
 The failure of the Sino-
 Soviet bloc communique to set
 forth a less ambiguous line
 does not solve the basic prob-
 lems of bloc unity.  There are
 indications that orthodox Com-
 munist leaders may be concerned
 that the declaration will tend
 to weaken their positions, and
 they are already endeavoring to
 minimize this possibility by
 interpreting it along firm,
 orthodox lines.
 Soviet presidium  member
 Furtseva emphasized at least
 five times in an address on 26
 November that the primary ob-
 jective of the Communist meet-
 ings was to obtain clear                   re-

 ciple" by the other Communist
 parties.  He asserted that
 these policies will not be
 altered.  Unlike other bloc
 leaders, he placed strong em-
 phasis on those portions of the
 declaration which recognize the
 degree of internal independence
 already obtained by Poland.
 Gomulka's relations with
 other bloc leaders may have been
 strained by his apparent insist-
 ence on inclusion of certain of
 his own principles in the docu-
 ment.  Mao's failure to support
 some of Gomulka's more independ-
 ent: formulations in the confer-
 ence discussions disappointed
 the Polish leader.
 To obtain concurrence "in
 principle," Gomulka probably
 felt justified in compromising
 on matters not directly impor-
 tant to Poland.   Gomulka's cur-
 rent policy of curbing the press
 and his public statements stress-
 ing areas of agreement within
 the bloc conform  to the bloc-
 wide effort to play down dif-
 ferences.

 however,  that they will con-
 tinue efforts to improve re-
 lations with the bloc as well
 as the West, and Tito still pro-
 fesses to believe that the proc-
 ess  of liberalization in the
 Soviet Union will continue. It
 is evident, however, that the
 rapid rapprochement between
 Moscow and Belgrade following
 the Tito-Khrushchev meeting in
 Rumania in early August,  has
 been checked by the Zhukov ous-
 ter and the Moscow declaration.
 The timing of Yugoslavia's de-
 cision to discontinue American
 military aid to coincide with
 its criticisms of the bloc's
 declaration suggests that Bel-
 grade is determined to uphold
 its appearance of independence
 of both East and West.   The
 USSR, irritated by Tito's re-
 fusal to attend the conference
 and encouraged  by  its  own
 scientific and technical ad-
 vances, does not seem especial-
 ly interested at present in
 making any new gestures to woo
 Belgrade.   It may believe Yugo-
 slavia's policy of independence
 between   East and  West  will
 eventually become untenable and
 will  be modified  to   accept
 closer relations with the bloc
 on Moscow's terms.
 Position
 At the conference,  Mao
 Tse-tung placed the full weight
 of his prestige behind Khru-
 shchev and the concept of So-
 viet leadership of the bloc,
 probably in an effort to assure
 solidarity of bloc foreign pol-
 icy, to strengthen the Sino-
 Soviet alliance, and to win com-
 mitments from Moscow for greater
 Sino-Soviet collaboration in
 military and scientific matters.
 The Chinese, who regard
 adherence to the alliance as
 their "supreme international
 duty," consider bloc power and
 prestige greatly enhanced as a
 result of recent Soviet military
 and scientific advances.
 In the course of Mao's
 talks with Russian officials,
 Peiping for the first time ex-
 tended its profession of the
 USSR's national primacy in the
 bloc to include Soviet party
 primacy.   Peiping had previous-
 ly stressed equality among par-
 ties as a condition for unity.
 China's public recognition
 of Soviet party leadership in-
 cludes the view that "revision-
 ism" is the bloc's  greatest
 danger. A year ago Peiping was
 portraying '.'great-nation (So-
 viet) chauvinism" as the main
 problem in intrabloc relations.
 The Mao-Khrushchev accord
 sets the stage for greater mili-
 tary and scientific collabora-
 tion between Moscow and Peiping.
 It is reported that Moscow has
 agreed to supply the Chinese
 with missiles and nuclear weap-
 ons, and that the Chinese may
 join the Warsaw pact, presuma-
 bly as part of the bloc's an
 sorer to Western plans to strength-
 en NATO.
 Possibly in anticipation
 of the Chinese endorsement of
 Soviet primacy,   the   USSR
 sanctioned the "validity of the
 Chinese Communist experience"
 as a guide for the parties of
 Asia in a Pravda article pub-
 lished jus~~r to the 40th
 anniversary celebrations.   The
 article, written by Indonesian
 Communist party chief  D. N.

 the Chinese  Communists as a

 ditions  not found in Europe.
 At the Chinese party con-
 gress in September 1:)56, Mikoyan
 explained that the USSR is pass-
 ing through an entirely  new"
 stage in the building of Com-
 munism, and that its accomplish-
 ments would  serve at a later
 stage  as a guide  for   former
 colonial countries.   He stressed
 the historical importance of
 the Soviet experience  in build-
 ing  socialism                          but emphasized
 that  the historical  condi-
 tions  applicable  to the build-
 ing  of socialism in                  the USSR
 are no   longer  applicable.
 The Chinese,  he said,   are mak-
 ing their own innovations more
 relevant   to the   present, not
 only  because  of the simple
 passage of  time, but  because
 of  different'.  beginnings.
 International Communist Tactics
 Although the peace manifesto
 of the world Communist leaders
 cites revolutionary Communist
 action as a "possibility" in gain-
 ing control in those  cases in
 which the "ruling classes resort
 to violence against the people,"
 it emphasizes peaceful transi-
 tion to socialism which would
 "win state power without civil
 war."  It calls  for a  grand
 "united front" of all progressive
 forces throughout the world, in-
 cluding the bourgeoisie and na-
 tionalistic elements as well as
 Communists, to struggle for peace
 and for the "victory of socialism."
 This reaffirms the decision of
 the 20th party congress and in-
 dicates that Moscow intends that
 Communist parties outside the
 bloc continue their present tac-
 tics of trying to form "popular
 fronts" with other leftist par-
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN EGYPT
 Egypt's economy has been
 able to make up  many of  the
 losses resulting from the Suez
 crisis, but the past  year has
 seen a  general  slowing  of
 economic activity, a cutback
 in the Nasir regime's develop-
 ment program, and                 increased
 dependence on the Soviet bloc.
 Without greater foreign assist-
 ance than the  recent  Soviet
 line of credit provides, Egypt
 probably cannot even maintain
 its people's present low stand-
 ard of living. While not ir-
 revocably tied to the Communist
 bloc, Egypt appears to be con-
 siderably more dependent on it
 economically  than  any  other
 free-world nation.
 Agriculture
 Agriculture is the key to
 the Egyptian economic picture,
 even though only 32 percent of
 the national income is derived
 from this source, because of the
 role of cotton--80 percent of
 Egypt's total exports--in pay-
 ing for essential imports.   The
 outlook for marketing the pres-
 ent cotton crops remains doubt-
 ful.  The crop--1,658,000  US
 bales--is  about  10-percent
 larger than last year and Cairo
 is faced with a carry-over from,
 the 1956-57 marketing season
 10-percent larger than a year
 earlier.   In view of the size
 of  the  present  marketable

 surplus--1,869,000 bales--and
 the difficulty encountered in
 marketing last year's crop,
 together with slow sales thus
 far in the current sales year,
 it is apparent Cairo will again
 depend on the Communist world
 to take a major portion of its
 cotton exports.
 The regime's hopes that
 Western buyers will enter the
 market in force are ill-founded.
 Western buyers who have been
 able to obtain their require-
 ments of Egyptian cotton from
 the Soviet bloc at prices re-
 portedly 20 to 30 percent less
 than those in the Egyptian mar-
 ket are expected to continue
 to obtain this cotton principal-
 ly from the Soviet bloc.
 Despite the dominant role
 of agriculture, Egypt does not
 grow enough basic food grains
 to feed its people.   During the
 1956-57 season, Egyptian wheat
 imports from the Soviet bloc
 amounted to about 14,697,480
 bushels.   This wheat marketing
 year--July 1957 through June
 1958--Egypt had hoped to import
 all of its wheat requirements,
 the equivalent of 36,734,700
 bushels, from the West but was
 forced to purchase about 3,744,-
 000 bushels from the bloc when
 a cotton-wheat exchange with
 France fell through.   Cairo
 press reports of 10 December
 state that another purchase of
 a similar amount is being ar-
 ranged.
 Egypt's long-term agricul-
 tural outlook is not good. Popu-
 lation pressure on the land is
 increasing,  so that by 1980, for
 example, an estimated 43,000,-
 000 Egyptians will be crowded
 into an area of about 13,500
 square miles.   Egypt's present
 population,  totals about 24,:000,-
 000.             The agricultural popula-
 tion, about 68 percent of total
 inhabitants, remains in abject
 poverty with less than $50 in-
 come per capita per year.
 Given modern technology,
 Egypt's principal hope of lift-
 ing its per capita standard of
 living lies in industrialization.
 However, the country is poorly
 endowed with minerals and other
 industrial raw materials.
 Industry
 In recent years Egyptian
 industry employed only about
 370,000 persons, almost 70 per-
 cent of them in food, textile,
 and cotton-ginning plants.
 Egyptian industry is very inef-
 ficient by Western standards.
 For example, the value of the
 net output per person in the
 chemical industry has been only
 11 percent as much as in the
 UK and only 6 percent of the
 American average.   In the case
 of textiles, Egypt's largest
 industry, the average Egyptian
 produces only half as much as
 his British counterpart and
 less than a quarter as much as
 an American worker.
 The country's primitive
 transport system adds greatly
 to the cost of Egyptian manu-
 factured goods and makes many
 of them noncompetitive with
 foreign imports, even in local
 Egyptian markets.   It has been
 cheaper to import chromium
 from South Africa for use in
 local industries than to use
 Egyptian chromium, largely be-
 cause of transport costs.
 Egyptian management general-
 ly is also exceedingly inef-
 ficient,                                                                   even in the highly de-
 veloped cotton industry.  A
 postwar study found, for example,
 that cheap, mass-consumption
 textiles were being made from
 high-quality Egyptian cotton
 rather than from the lower
 quality Indian and American cot-
 tons, as is the case in other
 countries.
 The major factor limiting
 industrialization is the lack
 of a local market.   Even with
 substantial foreign aid, this
 would remain a major handicap.
 The average Egyptian purchases
 only a few yards of cotton tex-
 tiles, a few pounds of sugar, and

 $16,000,000.   This shift was
 brought about in part by a sub-
 stantial surplus in trade with
 the bloc and in part,-by a sharp
 reduction in imports.
 Although the Egyptian
 press has hailed the achievement
 of a "favorable" trade balance
 as an improvement in
 Egypt's economic posi-
 tion, there has been
 a substantial reduc-
 tion in inventories
 of manufactured goods,
 including badly need-

 because the Commu-

 unable to supply all
 Egypt's requirements.

 Economic Development
 Egypt has recently an-
 nounced a five-year industrial
 development program to cost
 about $720,000,000, including
 approximately $430,500,000 in
 foreign exchange.   Since a pro-
 gram of this size is considera-
 bly beyond Egypt's resources,
 even with foreign exchange earn-
 ings from the Suez Canal,  ex-
 tensive foreign assistance will
 be needed.   The recent Soviet
 credit, reported to be about
 $178,000,000, and the recently
 announced $56,000,000 Czech-
 oslovakian credit will provide
 about 53 percent of the foreign
 should not add an appreciable
 burden to Egypt's payments
 problem.    The  reported  re-
 payment  schedule                                                                  calls for
 12 annual installments of
 about  $14,580,000--plus 2.5-
 percent interest--starting five
 years  after production  re-
 sulting  from the  construction
 of  new industries       begins.
 Thus  each annual payment
 would amount to only     about
 10 percent of Egypt's exports
 to  the bloc in  1957.
 Egypt's economic arrange-
 ments with the bloc in the past
 several months are not in them-
 selves sufficient to commit
 Egypt to the Communist camp ir-
 revocably.  As to the kind of
 economy  the Nasir  regime
 seems  to wish  to see develop
 in  Egypt, this appears  to be
 a product of vague "socialist"
 notions  and  of what  the re-
 gime                                                            feels is    hard necessity.
 It  has Egyptianized British
 and French assets, bought
 into existing private Egyptian
 firms,   and set up  new busi-
 nesses owned  and operated  by
 the government.   This develop-
 ment                                                            could in time   lead to the
 imposition  of centralized plan-
 ning and control on the hereto-
 fore Western-oriented business
 community, but it depends on
 the creation of a much larger
 reservoir of administrative
 talent than is now available.
 At present, the Economic
 Organization--a government agency
 --owns outright or holds an in-
 terest in more than 40 firms,
 including about 30 companies
 formerly owned by British and
 French nationals.   In addition,
 the government has formed new
 companies with a total capital
 in excess of $14,500,000 and
 plans to form additional gov-
 ernment-owned industries to pro-
 duce caustic soda, nitrogenous
 fertilizers, sodium carbonates,
 suiuric acid, and aspirin and
 ether  pharmaceuticals.   Plans
 to  set  up  an  automobile

 the Egyptian economy.        Plans
 for expanding agriculture, even
 through such enormous projects
 as the proposed Aswan High Dam,
 can do little more than add a
 maximum of 1,349,000 acres to
 the present 6,200,000 acres of
 farmland, barely enough to pre-
 vent a decline in the already
 extremely low standard of living.
 Prospects
 Whether or not Egypt's
 economy muddles through the next
 few months depends almost en-
 tirely on relations with the
 Soviet bloc.   Since it appears
 quite unlikely that the West
 will, without  major  policy
 shifts,, increase its imports f om
 Egypt by 50 to 100 percent, Com-
 munist purchases will again pro-
 vide the margin of success or
 failure for Egypt's trade ef-
 fort.  Although Nasir apparently
 recognizes his increasing de-
 pendence on Moscow and has ex-
 pressed a desire to hold the
 Communists'~:'shar.e'.in Egypt's ex-
 ports to one third, this may
 not be possible.   If anything,
 the recent Soviet and Czecho-
 slovak economic deals will tend
 in time to increase trade with
 the bloc.   Cairo's apparent in-
 tention to continue its intru-
 sion into the business community
 could make the government more
 susceptible to Soviet-type eco-
 nomic thinking and accelerate
 this policy.
