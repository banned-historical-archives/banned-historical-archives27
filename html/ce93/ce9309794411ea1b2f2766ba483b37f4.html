 THE FATE OF CHINA'S INTELLECTUAL COMMUNITY
 DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 February 1969
 Early in June 1966 the Principal of the renowned Peking University
 was attacked by what was soon to become an all too familiar weapon -- the
 wallposter.  Similar attacks spread like brushfire to dozens of other re-
 spected institutions of learning throughout China and, almost as simply
 as that, the Cultural Revolution had been launched.  By August of 1966,
 the Revolution and its adolescent apostles, the ubiquitous Red Guards, had
 become an unpleasant fact of life for many thousands of China's teachers,
 scholars, artists and all those comprising that segment of the population
 known as the intellectual community.  But wallposter attacks, initially
 accompanied by verbal denunciations, demonstrations, speeches and ridicule
 of the victims, were only prelude and destruction of property; and armed
 clashes, (and, in a few cases, deaths and suicides) became the order of
 the day.  A similar scenario was being written at the same time by extrem-
 ist elements in factories and within Communist Party organizations, but
 that is another story, in many ways quite removed from that of the intel-
 lectuals.  The methods applied against all the victims, however, bore a
 depressing resemblance to one another.
 The Cultural Revolution might have died after the initial impulse had
 ebbed but for two events.  Chairman Mao Tse-tung (presumably to prove he
 was still able to command), after (allegedly) taking his famous swim across
 the Yangtze, returned to Peking where he wrote his own poster called "Boma
 bard the-headquarters," praising the Red Guards and in effect putting him-
 self at their head as they began to flood into Peking.  Then, on 8 August,
 the Central Committee of the CCP produced a document (undoubtedly at Mao's
 behest -- probably even drafted by him) giving Party blessing to Red Guard
 actions in China's schools (as well as to extremist actions in China's
 factories).  Thus, the Cultural Revolution was assured a future, for at
 least as long as it took to accomplish its purpose:  cleansing the Party
 of "rightist" elements, which, of course, is translatable into moderates.
 The intellectuals were certainly the most dramatic victims of the
 Revolution although this was not necessarily the initial intention of Mao
 and the Central Committee.  Certainly Mao is aware of the qualms tradi-
 tionally suffered by the intellectual in being obliged to conform; surely
 he is also aware that many intellectuals hold Party membership as a matter
 of highly cynical expediency.  Mao did, however, make concessions for one
 segment of the intellectual community in the Central Committee's document
 on the Cultural Revolution.*  Not surprisingly, that segment was the scien-
 tific community; China, after all, had her nuclear weapons program underway.

 ing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."  Also known as the "Sixteen
 Points of August 1966."

 "As regards scientists, technicians and ordinary members
 of working staffs, as long as they are patriotic, work energet-
 ically, are nat against the Party and socialism, and maintain
 no illicit relations with any foreign country ... special care
 should be taken of these scientists and scientific and techni-
 cal personnel who have made contributions.  Efforts should be
 made to help them gradually transform their world outlook and
 their style of work."
 Scientists
 Despite Mao's effort to insulate China's scientific community from
 i;he turmoil of the Revolution, the violence generated in the course of his
 purges inevitably disrupted regions such as Sinkiang, where Chinese nuclear,
 missile and other defense installations are centered.  Mao's special pro-
 visions for the scientific segment of the intellectual community apparently
 cii.d not win over as many adherents as he had hope d, for quite recently five
 scientists, including three associated with China's nuclear program, have
 ~;een arrested on charges of treason and spying for the Soviet Union.  The
 mast prominent of these, Chien San-Chiang, was the head of China's Atomic
 Energy Institute.  Now in h:is late fifties, Chien studied in Paris under
 Communist physicist Frederic Joliot-Curie, winning the physics award of
 i;he French Academy of Science for his work on gamma and alpha rays and the
 1~ri-partition of nuclear fission of uranium.  The other two arrested
 scientists had, like a number of China's senior scientists, been trained
 abroad.  Wang Kan-Chang, charged with "relying too heavily on foreign text-
 books and conventions," had studied at the University of California before
 lzi:s apointment as Deputy Director of China's Institute of Atomic Energy.
 Wang is a nuclear physicist specializing in the fission process.
 Not only has the Cultural Revolution done damage to China's nuclear
 :installations, caused dissension among her leaders on scientific and de-
 fense policy and the arrest and disgrace of some of her leading scientists,
 but the Revolution has also dammed up the international exchange of scien-
 tific information.  The flow of scientific publications from China has
 ~~.x~ied up almost completely:  not one Chinese scientific journal has been
 ;gent to Great Britain, for instance, since October 1966.  Internally the
 situation is almost as serious; the number of publications listed for
 internal subscription in China fell from 650 in 1966 to 58 in 1968.  This
 ~~utoff, plus the curtailment of visitors to China, has reduced meaningful
 assessment of the role of science and the scientific worker (at any level)
 in China today to semi-educated guesswork.  From what can be observed and
 deduced, however, and even taking into account the Chinese hydrogem bomb
 test on 27 December 1868, it is apparent that Mao's Cultural Revolution
 has done considerable damage to scientific training and research programs.

 Scholars, Teachers, Students
 After the opening gun of the Cultural Revolution was fired at the
 head of Peking University, hundreds of scholars and teachers met the same
 fate:  ridicule, scorn, physical indignities, loss of job and standing in
 the community and in some extreme cases even the loss of life.  Now, a
 national "do-it=yourself" campaign has been launched in China to revise
 the entire educational curriculum, a campaign so alarming in its implica-
 tions for the future of education that China's harried and despairing
 scholars and teachers must view it as the end of learning.  The aim of the
 campaign is strictly ideological and the revamped curriculum will over-
 whelmingly consist of study of the thoughts of Mao.  The authority of the
 headmaster over the school and of the teacher over his class has been
 abolished completely.  Entrance examinations, grades, traditional rewards
 and punishments and final examinations have been swept aside and the
 workers and peasants are now in charge of education.  Peking apparently
 will be content to leave the education of the nation's young almost en-
 tirely in these hands, and has gone so far as to abolish or severely limit
 allocations of state funds to primary schools all over China.
 Looking beyond the primary schools, there is apparently no intention
 on the part of the regime to resume meaningful higher education in the
 near future.  Canton's technical colleges are not to reopen until the fall
 of 1969 at the earliest; a Shanghai university specializing in architec-
 ture and civil engineering has already had its courses cut from five to
 three years and courses at Tung-chi University in Shanghai have been re -
 duced from four to 'three years.  In addition, all curricula in upper
 schools are being revised and the subjects taught are being more closely
 geared to production requirements.  Ideological outlook is to play a very
 large part in students' promotions from one educational level to another.
 The regime's two most recent dicta with regard to education offer
 little promise of improvement in educational standards.  Particularly
 disheartening is the first of these which decrees the dispersal of 500,000
 college level youth in Kwangtung to the countryside for an unspecified
 time in order to engage in "agricultural pursuits."  The peasants -- who
 begrudge these usually unwilling recruits food and shelter and are uni-
 formly intolerant of their inexperience -- can offer little to replace
 the loss of formal education.  The possibility of inculcating a minimum
 of discipline in the students in the present circumstance is almost non-
 existent.  Also disheartening is a second regime dictum that provides for
 the immediate "graduation" of older students.  These older students tended
 to be leaders of the Red Guard movement and the great majority of them have
 had  no schooling in more than two years.  It scarcely requires a scholar
 to predict how this cavalier approach to academic disciplines is going to
 affect China's young and the quality of her once-proud educational system.
 Doctors,composers, artists
 Medical facilities in China, already below international standards,
 deteriorated during the Cultural Revolution and the training and standing
 of doctors was lowered appreciably.  Like the veriest criminals, doctors

 and nurses were dragged out of their hospitals, laboratories, clinics and
 classes by the Red Guards and forced to do manual work.  Some have been
 sent to rural areas where they spend half their time doing manual labor.
 The Chinese authorities are encouraging medical personnel to use Mao's
 "Thought" in lieu of drugs and equipment, and presumably medical textbooks,
 with what ludicrous and sometimes appalling results for the patients as
 can scarcely be imagined.
 The same frighteningly f ami.liar treatment accorded the scholars and
 the teachers was meted out to composers and artists who failed to measure
 up to the standards of tYie regime as interpreted by the Red Guards.  The
 isolation of men of talent is inevitable in today's China for it is in-
 escapable :in the arts that the dominance of politics will produce Philis-
 tinism, a dreary sameness of tone and color and thought and a smothering
 lack of imagination.  Ma Sitson's story is a commentary on what has happened
 to many of China's talented artists, musicans, composers.  Himself a com-
 paser of international rank and head of Peking's Central Music Academy,
 Ma along with Academy profess>ors and administrators, was humiliated,
 harassed, beaten and threatened in the name of the Cultural Revolution.
 It was only because he managed to escape China in the winter of 1967-and
 flee to the United States that the world outside learned what had happened
 to men like Ma and his fellow artists who included pianist Liu Shih-kun:,
 runner-up to Van Cliburn in the 1958 Moscow competitions.
 The Communist ]'arty and the Cultural Revolution
 The Cultural Revolution, which has done such damage to China's intel-
 lectuals, was actually fashioned by Mao to excise "Party persons in au-
 thority" eu2d to give youth the vicarious experience of a synthetic "revo-
 lution."  Perhaps this is the reason he was so much more adept at manipu-
 lating party personnel under cover of the Cultural Revolution than he was
 in manipulating the intellectual community.  In any case, the Chairman
 cannily managed to smoke out his adversaries in the Central Commute with
 very little fanfare, severed, their lines of support without destroying the
 Central Committee and is now apparently much readier to face the problems
 which China's long-delayed Party Congress may bring.  The Congress' first
 task will be to name a new Central Committee since less than a third of
 the presently listed 172. full and alternate members are still active.  It
 requires .Little imagination to guess wher- the loyalties of the survivors
 l.ie.
 The :new membership named in this Congress will undoubtedly be domi-
 nated by the military since the army has proved loyal to Mao, is trusted
 by him and has been extensively used by him as a checkrein on the Red
 Cxuards and on the older ext~?emists during the Cultural Revolution.  In
 this context, it seems high=Ly appropriate that the New China News Agency
 announcement of China's December 1968 hydrogen bomb explosion described
 i;he test as "a signific:s,nt gift to the forthcoming 9th National Congress
 ,~
 of the (Communist) Party.

 they were convinced that

 example, the local radio

 It is ironic that the old
 slogan, "oppose the resto-
 ration of the old," is now
 anathema --- while  the
 creation of "revolutionary
 alliances" is the aim of the
 teams. The chief purpose
 of the cultural revolution
 was to "destroy the old
 .. and make constant
 revolution through cease-
 less class struggle." It was
 not the reconciliation of
 feuding elements, but the
 encouragement  of
 "struggle."
 But reconciliation is to-'
 day's goal, and, -according
 to Changhsha Radio in
 Hunan province, it occa-
 sionally works. The radio
 said:

 "At i 1 itarized  construc-

 the army, which believes

 To that end, students and

 men and administrators,
 have already been orga-

 soldiers' orders.

 Chieh finally spoke up
 when encouraged by the

 Shihchiachuang, a major
 city  near  Peking.  Her
 revelations of "capitalist
 roading" and dereliction of
 duty among the profes-
 sional staff, the despised
 intellectuals, has now
 worked a proletarian revo-
 lution in the hospital.
 Literally millions of men
 and women of propaganda
 teams,  "guided  by  the
 Peoples  Liberation  Ar-
 my," have invaded every
 major institution in China
 -ostensibly  to "correct
 errors in ideological orien-
 tation and carry the cul-
 tural revolution through
 to, the end." They are,
 presumably, qualified for
 that arduous task by their
 pure  "proletarian  con-
 sciousness" and by their
 instinctive comprehension
 of the canonical Thought
 of Mao Tse-tung.
 The real point, however,
 is by no means what it
 appears.
 Put Down Excesses
 The chief function of the
 workers  propaganda
 teams is to suppress the
 excesses of the cultural
 revolution-in the name
 of Chairman Mao of the
 Communist Party, but un-
 der the orders of the hard-
 headed local generals.

 National Importance
 Several points arc of interest about this statement.  First,
 the fact that a special ruling was necessary for scientists anti
 technologists suggests that by 1966, many of them still. ditl
 not accept the ideas of Mao Tse-tung.  Sccond, the ,t,uenlrnt
 confirms the. national importance which the Chincsc Oovcrn-
 nlcnt gives to scicntific work.  Third, the reference to illicit
 contact with foreign countries is puzzling but suggests that
 all communications between Chinese and foreign scientists
 should be funnelled through official channels.
 Reports published in the People's Daily make' it appear
 doubtful that the policy announced in item 12 has been tip-
 held.  In July 1966, a month b fore the communiyut: was
 issued, a special rally was held in Peking for those rcvulution
 ary scicntific workers who were suffering from the "white.
 terror", which was being imposed upon the rescarch institutes
 of the Chinese Academy of Scicnccs by the supporters of Liu
 Shao-chi. There were several attempts during the ensuing
 months to seize power from the pro-Liu group who seem to
 have been in control of most of the institutes.

 The first objective of the worker teams
 is to wrest control of the universities,
 schools and  other  parts  of the 'super-
 siruclure'   from  the  intellectuals.  Their
 second and more far-reaching purpose is
 to use that control to organise a completely
 ce,alilarian system of education in which
 working-class children will not be handicap-
 ped because their parents do not help them
 with their homework but instead require
 their help in the fields. Exams seem to he

 issue of Red Flag attacks the old system
 lo r 'recognising marks only but not persons,

 Here committees for educational revolu-
 tion, consisting of poorer peasants, teachers
 and students have taken over from the
 school principals. The committees reduced
 primary schooling by one year and second-
 ary schooling by two, making a total school-
 ing period of nine years. On finishing school
 at 15 or 16, children will be expected to
 spend a few years doing farm work before
 being selected for university on the basis of
 political as well as intellectual qualifications.
 When students get to universities they will
 almost  certainly find  the  courses  there
 shortened  too.  One  Shanghai   university
 specialising in  architecture    and  civil
 engineering has already cut the length of its
 courses from five to three years.
 Perhaps the most convincing indication
 of Mao's determination that all intellectuals
 must be proletarianised is that even Chinese
 atomic and rocket scientists have now been
 attacked along with Nich Jung-chen, the
 top party man charged With master-minding
 the nuclear weapons programme. 'Capitalist-
 roadcrs' have been exposed at the Tachaitan,
 rocket plant in remote Chinghai, while a
 Red Guard bulletin has stated that the
 director and a deputy director of the
 Institute of Atomic Energy and (lie director
 of the Institute of Mathematics have been
 arrested along with two prominent adminis-
 trators at the Academy of Sciences. For these
 as for all other intellectuals schooled under
 the old system, the prescription is re-educa-
 tion. The method is a familiar Maoist one
 and already tens of thousands have left class-
 rooms and desk yobs to settle down as
 manual labourers in the -countryside.

 No. 163
 Can Workers Lead the Intellectuals?
 by Chi Ming
 -
 Lenin sai            ommunism equals    e boviet union pius nacauna-L
 ication."  This was an expression that never ruled out the people's desire
 or happy life in a socialist or Communist society.   However, anyone on
 he Chinese mainland enjoying a comfortable life or desiring to live better
 will be accused of following the influence of "capitalism," "revisionism"
 and "capitalist restoration," and be purged.
 In Lenin's time, the desire for "electrification" was a progressive
 slogan, but, with regard to the present situation, such a slogan is out-
 dated, because with the exception of the Chinese mainland and a few other
 laces "electrification" has become reality.   In Hong Kong, for instance,
 the average middle class family now has in its possession an electric
 phonograph, refrigerator, television, electric fan, electric rice cooker,
 electric iron and electric washing machine.   Thus, if Mao Tse-tung sin-
 cerely tries to improve the livelihood of the 700 million Chinese, he
 should try to follow Lenin's instruction by bringing all the blessings of
 electrification to the Chinese people on the whole mainland.
 When China goes for "electrification" or "modernization," she must
 have a great army of scientific and technical forces to embark on different
 projects with the full support of the common people; they may thus concen-
 trate their efforts in inventing and discovering wonders for mankind.   The
 question remains .   how to build up such a great scientific and technical
 force, and how to fully develop its creative spirit during the course of
 its cultivation.  Evidently this isn't the kind of problem that can be
 solved through political campaigns or "Mao Tse-tung's thought" or the like.
 While it is true that the Chinese Communists have in the nineteen
 years of their rule turned out certain numbers of scientific and technical
 personnel, the various political campaigns have to varying extents affected
 their creative spirit.  For instance, in 1956 Chien Wei-chang was awarded
 a second-class medal for his research paper on dynamics entitled "On the
 Question of the Large Deflection of Circular Thin Elastic Plate," but he
 was later branded a "rightist" and has since done nothing useful in his
 field of studies; no one can say that his loss in creative thinking does
 not represent a waste of talent for the country as a whole.
 In terms of China's population and territory, the scientific and
 technical personnel currently available is far from enough to cope with
 the need for national construction.   Liu Shao-chi aptly said:   "All our
 Party and League members and revolutionary intellectuals should study hard
 and earnestly pursue their professional knowledge, and master well all
 kinds of technology and scientific learning."  This was a sharp comment
 on the ignorance of those "empty-headed politicians  who never realized
 the importance of professional and technical knowledge to the performance
 of duties.   Is it for the benefit of the country and people that we should
 have more empty-headed politicians or well trained personnel thoroughly

 CPYRAP3roved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400020015-1
 imbued with professional knowledge?  Personally I believe we should have
 more of the latter.   In. the past, when the Chinese Communists were pre-
 occupied with political. and military struggles, naturally they needed more
 political and military specialists to speed up their success in the seizurl
 of political and military power.   Once in power, they should concentrate
 their efforts in building up the country.  They do have such personnel who
 understood quite well what type of persons they need in national construc-
 tion.   Chang Ching-fu in an article published in "Chung Kuo Ching Nien
 Pao" (China Youth Journal) on February 25, 1958 said:   "... professional
 and technical knowledge serves as the tool and weapon for accomplishing all
 kinds of tasks; advanced science and technology serves as an advanced tool
 and weapon; it would be difficult to try to accomplish all tasks without
 thoroughly acquainting the personnel with professional knowledge and
 scientific technology.   Our tasks in industrial construction, in agricul-
 tural development, in financial, trade, communications, legal and cultural
 fields are political tasks for the 600 million Chinese people, we should
 rely on the entire body of people for their accomplishment.   But every
 task involves certain professional and technical problems, and without a
 great army of specialists possessing sufficient professional and technical
 knowledge we shall find it very difficult to accomplish the tasks faster,
 better and more economically."
 Although Chang Ching-fu mentioned in the above paragraph the term
 "political task," the meaning of the term differed greatly from "empty-
 headed politician" and political campaigns; what he said completely cor-
 responded with Lenin's "Communism equals the Soviet Union plus national
 electrification."  Without advanced scientists and technical experts and
 complete facilities, it would be impossible to accomplish the nation's
 construction by merely inciting the revolutionary fervor of the people;
 this was illustrated by the disastrous failure of the "steel making" cam-
 paign during the Great Leap Forward in 1958.
 There had circulated on the Chinese mainland a prejudice that no one
 should study anything which was first invented in a capitalist country.
 In his article published in People's Daily on June 13, 1956, Lu Ting-yi
 (purged former Director of Propaganda of the CCP Central Committee) cri-
 ticized such an erroneous trend.  Under the title "Hundred Flowers Bloom
 and Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," the article pointed out:   "It is
 wrong to fix a label of '`feudalism,'  'capitalism" and 'socialism' on a
 certain medical, biological or other natural science theory by calling the
 Chinese  medicine practitioner 'feudalistic,'and the Western medicine prac-
 titioner'capita.listic,' Pavlov's theory 'socialistic,' Michurin's theory
 'socialistic,' and Mendel's study of heredity 'capitalistic' and so forth."
 There should not be any class attributes connected with the study of
 medical and natural sciences and theories, so that Einstein's theory is
 not only adopted by capitalist countries but also by Communist countries;
 Michurin's theory should be treated in a similar manner.
 The question that really concerns us is whether one can master this
 or that kind of science and technology and whether such science and

 A,Pr    For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400020015-1
 technology can be properly applied.   For instance, atomic energy can be
 used to develop industry and other peaceful projects, the same thing can
 be made to kill more people and make war more horrible.   However, science
 and scientists are innocent, if certain sciences and scientists commit
 their studies to criminal purposes, for the most part their rulers or
 systems should bear the blame.
 As mentioned earlier, the intellectuals and scientists should be pro-
 tected during the course of building up the new China, because a new crop
 of intellectuals and scientists cannot be raised without relying on the
 older and experienced ones.   An editorial in "Chung Kuo Ching Nien Pao"
 on April 9, 1963 said:   "Veteran scientists are the treasures of our
 country; they are needed to play the leading role in developing science
 and technology, and they are of special importance in the training of
 talents."  This truly sounded fair to the veteran scientists.   But, when
 the power struggle was launched under the cover of the "Great Cultural
 Revolution," many specialists and scientists of outstanding abilities
 like statistician Hsieh Mu-chiang were all given harsh treatment; some were
 arrested, others were mercilessly-attacked.   Such an action inevitably
 hinders the progress of our national construction to a very serious extent.
 In recent years, Canada has gone all out to recruit and employ tech-
 nical personnel from all over the world in order to speed up her national
 construction program; thus by comparison Canada attaches greater import-
 ance to scientific and technical experts than the Communist regime in
 Peking.   Meanwhile, if the influence of "conservatism" and "capitalism"
 continues to prevail over scientific and technical circles on the Chinese
 mainland, the Communist authorities should look squarely into the issue
 and try to find out what has been wrong with their system and what has
 caused the Chinese scientists and technical personnel to become passive.
 Einstein never tried hard enough to make his brilliant achievement in
 physics benefit Germany largely because of the latter's discrimination
 against the German Jews and Hitler's wars of aggression.
 A Chinese proverb says:   "In study there is no difference in senior
 and junior, he who masters is the teacher."  In other words, anyone who
 is thoroughly conversant with a certain subject or technique can be a
 teacher and leader in his particular field of learning.   At present, the
 Chinese Communist propaganda goes all out to stress that the "working
 class" must exercise leadership in everything, the word "everything" na-
 turally covers all activities in factories, mining centers, postal and
 telecommunications centers, banks, trade, culture, education, sciences and
 all concerned departments.   The question is that can the workers lead in
 such activities?  If the workers have mastered the necessary professional
 knowledge and technology, naturally they will know how to exercise leader-
 ship over these departments, and they cannot play the leading role if
 they haven't learned enough about the different subjects mentioned above.
 Before 1957, many Party cadres who were totally ignorant of the ne-
 cessary professional knowledge were assigned to leading posts in numerous

 government and academic organizations; their presence had aroused wide-
 spread criticism which was wrapped up in the laconic sentence "The layman
 leads the expert."
 On the: other hand, the Chinese Communist cadres in those days were
 still open-minded enough to learn from the experts.   Liang Szu-cheng, a
 well-known bridge construction expert, published in the 23rd issue of
 "Chung Kuo Ching Nien," 1957, an article which pointed out.   "I frequently

 mission, and many designing units; they all fought in guerrilla warfare
 in the past, often they would humbly call themselves 'boors from mountain
 caves.'   In fact, they were all battle-tested and fighters who have
 learned never to bow to difficulties of any kind; they have, on the basis
 of Marxism-Leninism, learned from the Soviet experts, from veteran scien-
 tists, veteran engineers, and they are themselves 'experts' who have grad-
 uated from the 'university' of practical work ... there are many technical
 problems on which the engineers cannot reach a conclusion through repeated
 and sometimes heated debates, but after listening to opinions of both
 sides, these comrades are capable of drawing out conclusions.   For instance,
 the decision on adopting the 'tube caisson foundation' method in building
 the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was reached in such a manner.   How could
 such a correct conclusion be drawn by those without expert knowledge?
 Impossible!"  Mr. Liang also said:   "Besides, of higher learning.   In
 Tsinghua University, for instance, there are several dozen directors,
 section chiefs and Party committee secretaries of industrial and mining
 setups who want to 'study from the very beginning.'   They average 40 years
 old.   Their curriculum is similar to that for college students.   After
 graduation, they will all become engineers."  The above paragraph quoted
 from Liang Sze-cheng's article clearly showed that the leading cadres must
 understand professional knowledge and concerned techniques.
 hold no prejudice against the working class.  In fact, the workers
 occupy a very important position in the construction of different lines of
 production and business.   However, it is undeniably true that the workers
 are, on the average, rather low in educational levels.   In the long years
 of employment, they are only able to learn general techniques, and they
 must rely on the experts in large-scale and precision designings.   For
 instance, the newly completed Yangtze River Bridge at Nanking could not
 have been built without help from the experts in those days; it was beyond
 the ability of the ordinary workers with general technical knowledge no
 matter how hard they might have tried to rely on Mao Tse-tung's thought.
 Therefore, if the working class wants to exercise leadership in every-
 thing, the workers must acquire the necessary technical knowledge and
 ability.   For instance, Nieh Jung-chen, head of the Scientific Commission
 under the Ministry of National Defense, and Wang Ping-chang, head of the
 Seventh Ministry of Machine-Building, have acquired the most essential
 knowledge needed although they are not as nearly accomplished as Chien
 Hsueh-sen and Chien San-chiang in science.

 WHERE CAN A CHINESE SCIENTIST GO?
 by Cha Ling, who received the personal
 experiences of Chinese physicist Li Ming-
 ching
 There are more than 10,000 Chinese scientists living and working in
 Western nations.   They all have this  sentiment    "living in a strange
 country, they feel sorry for themselves," and they all hope that someday
 they can return to the fatherland to live and to work.   But under the pre-
 sent conditions, none of them are willing to return.   As a whole, thaeir
 attitude may be represented by the statement of a Chinese electronic ex-
 pert, who escaped from the mainland in 1960 and has been living in London.
 He said:   "In England, I had no relatives, but I felt that I was warmly
 welcomed.   My contributions were appreciated and encouraged.   I have many
 friends among the overseas Chinese, but I have begun to feel that my
 closest friends are those of the same profession from other countries."
 How true!   Scientists are not separated by national boundaries and
 scientists of mutual interests have warm and friendly feelings for each
 other and they are not affected by differences in nationalities.   A Chi-
 nese medical doctor who is now living in West Germany said it well:   "In
 China, the Communist Party first forced me to decide whether I was a med-
 ical doctor or a Chinese.   Because I had studied abroad, they have their
 suspicions of me.   They made things difficult for me; they insulted me;
 they relegated low-class work to me and would not allow me to undertake
 responsible work or work in which I could contribute the most to society.
 As a result, I had to come to the conclusion that the fatherland did not
 need me.   Therefore, I gave up,my Chinese citizenship and chose to be a
 doctor.   Probably every nation in the world needs a doctor like me."
 A more typical example
 Dr. Li Ming-chiang, a physicist reknown for his technological liaison
 work at the research institute of the Virginia Technological Institute,
 had made a comparative study of Chinese Communist and Western scientists.
 Li Ming-chiang was born in 1935 in Ming-po, Chekiang Province, and al-
 though his family was not wealthy, the Chinese Communists placed his
 father and mother in the class of capitalists.   For this reason, he had
 to struggle very hard to stay in school.   In a school, aside from one's
 scholastic work, a student's standing in the class is based on his family
 origin and the student's so-called "political consciousness."  For this
 reason, although he was excellent in scholastic work, he barely passed
 the other standards to get promoted every year.   From 1953 to 1958, he
 studied physics theory at Peking University.   After he was graduated, in
 spite of being the best student in his class, he was sent to a teacher's
 ormal college in Inner Mongolia to teach elementary physics.   Although
 he laboratory facilities of the school were pitiful and crude, he, be-
 ause of his family origin, was not even allowed to enter the laboratory.

 Finally, after being frustrated and bored with the whole matter, he event-
 ually escaped from the mainland upon an invitation to go to the United
 States.
 P., scientist in a free heaven and on a free earth
 At that time his English was rudimentary; moreover, when he took the
 school examination, someone discovered that his educational level was
 equivalent to a junior in an American college and that what he had learned
 in Peking University was at least 10 years behind times.  At this he was
 annoyed and discouraged; at first, he couldn't believe that his standards
 were so low and he turned around and accused the Americans of discrimi-
 nating and looking down on his scholastic capabilities.  Because of dis-
 contentment, he tried harder; so hard that he slept little and ate little,
 but studied and studied.   His teachers gladly gave him special attention
 and special help.
 In 2 years, Li Ming-chiang obtained his doctorate in physics, a
 spectacular achievement.   For this reason, the school decided to send him
 to the Princeton Institute for advanced study for further study.   Only
 the most outstanding and experienced scientists were granted this honor.
 The scientists who go to the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies
 stay there for 2 years and during that time receive high salaries, live
 in luxury apartments and have the use of all sorts of recreational facil-
 ities.   It has one of the largest libraries in the world and for research
 tools it has almost everything available and if not, they are procured
 upon request.   As to work, the scientists do nothing but use their heads
 to think of and to solve scientific problems.   Li Ming-chiang fully
 utilized those 2 years there.  When he left the institute, he received
 numerous offers and had the choice of picking the one which paid him the
 most and gave him the greatest satisfaction.
 The reason that Chu talent was used in China
 He is married to a Chinese girl who holds a doctorate in chemistry.
 They now have two lovable children and a comfortable and happy life.   As
 to work, he uses one fourth of his time to teach the research students
 and spends the rest of the time for his own research work.  His interest
 in politics remains as lukewarm as the day when he was on the China main-
 land.   If the Chinese Communists were not so antiquated in demanding that
 in everything "politics commands" and had they not interfered with his
 livelihood and. work, he and other outstanding physicists would not have
 gone to the United States and would have remained on the mainland to serve
 the Chinese Communists,
 Speaking of the scientists on the mainland Li Ming-chiang pointed out
 that they should not be looked upon as one homogeneous group.   For example,
 scientists who had studied abroad are generally older and most had studied
 in the Soviet Union, the Western nations, or Japan.   Those who are rela-
 tively young acquired their education on the mainland and

 Buis e   y   eir  ami y origins, good or bad.   The
 types of scientists also vary according to the changes of events, particu-
 larly during the drastic and terrific changes, in 1958, of the struggle
 against the rightists and, in 1966, when the great Cultural Revolution
 as initiated.   Because of the changes of the nature of these problems,
 he fates of the scientists on the mainland is absolutely different from
 that of the scientists abroad.
 feeling of security-and shortcuts
 The great problem of the scientists on the mainland today is the lack
 f a sense of security.   The Chinese Communist regime blows hot and cold
 awards them, praising them at one time and putting them down at another.
 fter the anti-rightist struggle, the Chinese Communist Party accepted a
 arge number of outstanding scientists into their party leaving them to
 elieve they could have stability and peace in work; but this was completely
 hattered with the launching of the great Cultural Revolution.  When the
 hinese Communists practice suppression or "brain-washing," they often use
 he tactic of threat and seduction.   On the one hand, they would select
 few scientists  and     lavish praise and rewards upon them; on the other,
 hey would single out another group of scientists and brand them as tar-
 ets of struggle and hurl all sorts of invectives and insults upon them.
 hese two groups of persons were all selected by the cadres, and the cadres
 ade their selections quite at random.   Those scientists who received
 dulation and rewards naturally felt that "their ancestors were looking
 t them and their family tombs were propitious;" scientists who were the
 argets of struggle were naturally disgruntled and discontented with no
 ay to release their anger.   Those scientists who neither received an
 ward nor were the targets of "rectification" felt greatly relieved and
 onsoled themselves that they were lucky to get away with it again.   How-
 ver, in this type of struggle, there is not just one obstacle, but many
 bstacles ahead.   For this reason, all the scientists are still in great
 pprehension not knowing when it will be their turn to be struggled against.

 Excerpt from China Mainland Media
 Revealing Regime Treatment of Doctors
 and Status of Medicine in China
 June-Nov 1968
 Medical facilities in China, already below international standard,
 have deteriorated during the Cultural Revolution.  Doctors and nurses have
 been "dragged out" in large numbers and forced to do manual work in the
 hospitals.   Other physicians have been sent to rural areas to act as "bare-
 foot doctors," doing part manual and part medical work; in some instances
 they have been told that they will only receive work points for agricul-
 tural labor and not for medical work.   Disruptions in the pharmaceutical
 industry and in transport facilities have made medicine scarce.
 In trying to overcome shortages of both facilities and staff, the
 Chinese authorities are encouraging medical personnel to use Mao's Thought
 in place of drugs and equipment.   But risks are apparently being taken in
 Mao's name.   The New China News Agency (NCNA), on November 11, 1968, re-
 ported on the exploits of Cheng Yu-lu, a "barefoot doctor" who had never
 been to a medical college.   A patient once went to the commune clinic where
 Cheng worked and asked for an operation for an abscess on the right upper
 abdomen :
 "A doctor at the clinic, who was a medical college
 graduate, told the patient:   'Your case is very serious.
 Our clinic is not equipped to treat you.  We would like
 to recommend you to some other place for treatment.'   At
 this, Cheng Yu-lu came up to examine the patient.   The
 doctor was angry.   He said:  'How can such a poorly equipped
 clinic treat such a disease?  You will be held responsible
 if anything goes wrong.'   Cheng Yu-lu ignored the doctor's
 comp.laints...   He improvised an operating theatre in his
 bedroom...".
 Lartchow Radio said on November 8 that the political department of the
 Kansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently called on the people to
 learn from "model health worker," Cheng Yu-lu, in being "boundlessly loyal
 to Chairman Mao."
 Members of a Mao Tse-tung propaganda team of the People's Liberation
 Army (PLA) used new acupuncture techniques to treat deaf mutes at the
 Liao Yuan school for deaf mutes in Kirin according to NCNA on November 3.
 The three doctors and five nurses in the team tried an important acupunc-
 ture point which specialists in the past had called a "forbidden point":
 "The old acupunture books stipulated that the needle
 could be inserted safely only to a depth of one to 1.6
 centimeters. But this did no good.   The 'authorities'
 claimed that insertion to a depth of 3.3 centimeters would
 make a healthy person become mute; insertion to a depth of
 five centimeters would endanger life."

 Medical worker Chao :Pu-yu first tried the acupuncture needle on his
 own body, inserting the needle into his head beyond the danger point.   Thus
 having satisfied the team that the treatment was safe, they began work on
 the children in the school,   After acupuncture for half a month, 32 of
 the 157 deaf mutes could shout:   "Long live Chairman Mao."
 NCNA described on November 1, how a Shanghai medical team equipped a
 primitive hospital from scratch without any financial help from the State:
 "They borrowed some stools and boards to make some beds
 and fetched water from a well about half a kilometer away.
 The operating table was only a bed of wooden boards and
 child delivery was carried out in a bamboo reclining chair.
 A washbasin was used as a sterilizer.   They did not spend a
 penny of State funds      The bourgeois reactionary academic
 'authorities' looked down on the operating room of this
 tiny hospital as 'violating the regulations' and 'not to
 standard,' but it was in this operating room which had no
 operating table, no shadowless lamp, no blood bank, no
 oxygen and no running water that the comrades performed
 dozens of medium and major operations, including gastrec-
 tomy, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy by
 kerosene lamp and flashlight"
 An operation by PLA surgeons on a peasant woman with an abdominal
 tumor weighing 90 catties was reported by NCNA in June 1968,   The opera-
 tion was carried out with the aid of Mao's Thought despite the fact that
 the "army health center was not equipped for such a rare operation."  Now
 the Chinese have opened an exhibition of PLA achievements in medicine in
 Peking with the tumor as the center piece.

 Excerpts from China mainlandMedia                         June-Nov 1968
 Revealing Regime Treatment of Scientists
 Warning To China's Nuclear Scientists.
 Chien San-chiang, Director of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences since 1958, has been denounced as a "capitalist-
 roader and secret enemy agent" who must be "toppled."                              (Canton Red Guard
 newspaper, Red Flag Bulletin No. I, June 1968.)
 This attack on Chien, one of China's leading nuclear scientists who,
 although he studied and worked abroad between 1937 and 1948, has since
 held a number of political as well as scientific posts, reflects the
 changed official attitude towards scientists and technicians seen in Mao's
 recent instructions on technical training (Peking Radio, July 21) and in
 reports on the experiences of the Shanghai Lathe Plant in adopting new
 training procedures,
 The emphasis in technical training is now to be on practical labor
 at ordinary factory or agricultural worker level as opposed to theoretical
 research which is said to divorce intellectual workers from the masses.
 Foreign influences and revisionist views such as those attributed to "China's
 Khrushchev" (Liu Shao-chi) are to be resisted.
 The relevance of the latest instructions to scientists has been
 clearly underlined.   On July 21, the People's Daily, commending an investi-
 gation report on the Shanghai Lathe Plant prepared by the New China News
 Agency and Wen Hui Pao, urged scientific research departments and "leading
 units" to read it carefully as a "sharp weapon for further criticizing
 and repudiating" Liu Shao-chi's "counterrevolutionary revisionist line in
 science and technology."
 Wen Hui Pao warned on July 26 that the situation in scientific and
 technological circles was "not satisfactory," and complained that "some
 people" sought to put work first, indulged in personal ambition, relied
 too heavily on foreign textbooks and conventions, and did not move beyond
 the library or laboratory.   They did not intend to follow the direction
 indicated "long since" by Mao for science and technology.   The newspaper
 also complained that a "number of so-called experts, extremely politically
 reactionary and completely ignorant in their work," had "usurped leader-
 ship over science and technology."
 And in research bureaus, the strata were "strictly defined" and the
 "newly emerging forces," (presumably the revolutionary workers), were sup-
 pressed.   In short, the structure of scientific and technological depart-
 ments had become a "hotbed for the breeding of revisionist intellectual
 aristocrats."
 Wen Hui Pao warned on July 26 that some scientific and technological
 units had abandoned the task of "consolidating and expanding" revolutionary
 great alliances and three-way alliances.   Instead of struggling against

 "capitali.st-roaders," they were divided by "civil wars."  A Special Edition
 of Materials (published jointly by two Canton revolutionary groups and
 recording Chou En-lai's meeting on April 20-21, with representatives from
 the National Defense Scientific Commission, the Military Control Commis-
 sion, the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building and the Chinese of Sciences),
 disclosed that the "violent struggle of the Seventh Ministry of Machine
 Building was connected with the factionalism of the Scientific Commission."
 Both these departments are thought to be concerned with China's nuclear
 program.
 Wen Hui Pao laid down certain tasks for scientific and technological
 circles,   They were to
 "combine revolutionary mass criticism and repudiation
 with the purification of the class ranks, with the task of
 struggle-criticism-transformation in individual units and
 with the rectification of the party organization, and carry
 mass criticism and repudiation through to the end."
 This sterner attitude contrasts with that revealed in the 16-point
 decision of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee on the Cultural
 Revolution, adopted on. August 8, 1968, which laid down that during the
 cultural revolution,
 "the policy of unity-criticism-unity should be con-
 tinued toward those scientists, technical personnel, and
 working people so long as they are patriotic and work ac-
 tively without opposing the party and Socialism, and so
 Long as they have no improper association with foreign
 countries.   Those scientists and technical personnel who
 have made contributions would be protected.   Assistance may
 be rendered in the gradual transformation of their world
 outlook and work methods."   (NCNA, August 8, 1966)
 "Red v  Exert" camai_n continues .
 Laboratories have also become a target of the new wave of the "Red
 versus Expert" battle now being waged in China.   In 1963-65 during the
 period of recovery from the three previous years,necessity caused greater
 reliance on expertise, but currently the emphasis on the leading role of
 workers has given rise to a new prestige for "Redness."  Consequently pur-
 chases of technical equipment and money spent on proper research facili-
 ties in 1963-64 are now being condemned as bourgeois and counterrevolu-
 tionary
 Eight workers at a silk weaving mill in Soochow, Kiangsu Province,
 who wrote a report on their investigations at the mill's laboratory (New
 China News Agency (NCNA) on October 31, 1968), said that since it was set
 up in 1963, the laboratory had been controlled by a "handful of capitalist-
 roaders and reactionary bourgeois technical authorities" who believed in
 "letting experts run the plant":

 "These fellows were so free with money that they
 bought a good deal of apparatus blindly, regardless of
 whether it was needed or useful,"
 The workers also condemned the "appalling extent to which the labora-
 tory placed itself above the masses," and concluded:
 "The laboratory staff have gone down to do produc-
 tive work on the shop floor where they are being reedu-
 cated by the workers."
 The story of the laboratory at Chuchou Tientsin Locomotive and Rolling
 Stock Works was told by Changsha Radio (October 30).   This laboratory was
 established in 1958 at which time it was quite simple and in regular touch
 with the workers.   But in 1964, encouraged by official emphasis on "expert-
 ness," the "reactionary bourgeois technical authorities" spent 8,000 yuan
 on "a fine-looking laboratory" in the main building of the works and they
 also built a second laboratory.
 "These persons also made a big thing of buying instru-
 ments, trying several of the same kind at one time."
 The laboratory personnel were
 "gravely divorced from production, sitting around in
 their laboratories and going in for so-called creation,
 invention, scientific research and theorising?  They always
 reckoned themselves superior to the workers."
 The report ended:
 "The laboratory staff must take it in turns to do
 production and steel workers must take it in turn to work
 in the laboratory,"
