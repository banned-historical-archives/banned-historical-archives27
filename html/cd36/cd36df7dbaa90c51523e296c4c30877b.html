 PARTY ORGANIZATION AND PARTY LITERATURE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 2-4
 [Article by V. I. Lenin; passages within slantlines published in boldface]
 [Text]  The new conditions for social-democratic work in Russia which have
 arisen since the October Revolution have brought the question of party
 literature to the fore.  The distinction between the illegal and the legal
 press, that, melancholy heritage of the epoch of feudal, autocratic Russia,
 is beginning to disappear.  It is not yet dead, by a long way.  The hypo-
 critical government of our prime minister is still running amuck, so much
 so that IZVESTIA SOVETA RABOCHIKH DEPUTATOV is printed "illegally"; but
 apart from bringing disgrace on the government, apart from striking further
 moral blows at it, nothing comes of the stupid attempts to "prohibit" that
 which the government is powerless to thwart.
 So long as there was a distinction between the illegal and the legal press,
 the question of the party and nonparty press was decided extremely simply
 and in an extremely false and abnormal way.  The entire illegal press was a
 party press, being published by organizations and run by groups which in
 ono: way or another were linked with groups of practical party workers.  The
 entire legal press was nonparty--since parties were banned--but it "gravi-
 tated" toward one party or another.  Unnatural alliances, strange "bed-
 fe._lows" and false cover-devices were inevitable.  The forced reserve of
 these who wished to express party views merged with the immature thinking
 or mental cowardice of those who had not risen to these views and who were
 not, in effect, party people.
 An accursed period of Aesopian language, literary bondage, slavish speech,
 and ideological serfdom!  The proletariat has put an end to this foul
 atmosphere which stifled everything living and fresh. in Russia.  But so far
 the proletariat has won only half freedom for Russia.
 The revolution is not yet completed.  While tsarism is /no longer/ strong
 enough to defeat the revolution, the revolution is /not yet/ strong enough
 to defeat tsarism.  And we are living in times when everywhere and in

 everything there operates this unnatural combination of open, forthright,
 direct and consistent party spirit with an underground, covert, "diplo-
 matic" and dodgy "legality."  This unnatural combination makes itself felt
 even in our newspaper:  for all Mr Guchkov's witticisms about social-
 dembdratid tyranny forbidding the publication of moderate liberal-bourgeois
 newspapers, the fact remains that PROLETARY, the central organ of the
 Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party, still remains outside the locked
 doors of /autocratic/, police-ridden Russia.
 Be that as it may, the half-way revolution compels all of us to set to work
 at once organizing the whole thing on new lines.  Today literature, even
 that published "legally," can be nine-tenths party literature.  It must
 become party literature.  In contradistinction to bourgeois customs, to
 the profit-making, commercialized bourgeois press, to bourgeois literary
 careerism and individualism, "aristocratic anarchism" and drive for profit,
 the socialist proletariat must put forward the principle of /party litera-
 ture/, must develop this principle and put it into practice as fully and
 completely as possible.
 What is this principle of party literature?  It is not simply that, for the
 socialist proletariat, literature cannot be a means of enriching indi-
 viduals or groups:  it cannot, in fact, be an individual undertaking,
 independent of the common cause of the proletariat.  Down with non-
 partisan writers!  Down with literary supermen!  Literature must become
 /part/ of the common cause of the proletariat, "a cog and a screw" of one
 single great social-democratic mechanism set in motion by the entire
 politically conscious vanguard of the entire working class.  Literature
 must become a component of organized, planned and integrated Social-
 Democratic Party work.
 "All comparisons are lame," says a German proverb.  So is my comparison of
 literature with a cog, of a 'living movement with a mechanism.  And I dare
 say there will ever be hysterical intellectuals to raise a howl about such
 a comparison, which degrades, deadens, "bureaucratizes" the free battle of
 ideas, freedom of criticism, freedom of literary.. creation, etc., etc.  Such
 outcries, in point of fact, would be nothing more than an expression of
 bourgeois-intellectual individualism.  There is no question that litera-
 ture is least of all subject, to mechanical adjustment or leveling, to the
 rule of the majority over the minority., There is no question, either, that
 in this field greater scope must undoubtedly be allowed for personal
 initiative, individual inclination, thought and fantasy, form and content.
 All this'is undeniable; but all this simply shows that the literary side
 of the proletarian party cause cannot be mechanically identified with its
 other sides.  This, however, does not in the least refute the proposition,
 alien and strange to the bourgeoisie and bourgeois democracy, that litera-
 ture must by all means and necessarily become an element of Social-
 Democratic Party work, inseparably bound up with the other elements.
 Newspapers must become the organs of the various party organizations, and
 their writers must by all means become members of these organizations.
 Publishing and distributing centers, bookshops'and reading rooms, libraries
 and similar establishments--must all be under party control.  The organized

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 socialist proletariat must keep an eye on all this work, supervise it, in
 its entirety, and, from beginning to end, without any exception, infuse
 into it the life-stream of the living proletarian cause, thereby cutting
 the ground from under the old, semi-Oblomov, semi-shopkeeper Russian
 principle:  the writer does the writing, the reader does the reading.
 We are not suggesting, of course, that this transformation of literary work,
 which has been defiled by the Asiatic censorship and the European bour-
 geoisie, can be accomplished all at once.  Far be it from us to advocate
 any kind of standardized system, or a solution by means of a few decrees.
 Cut-and-dried schemes are least of all applicable here.  What is needed
 is that the whole of our party, and the entire politically conscious
 social-democratic proletariat throughout Russia, should become aware of
 this new problem, specify it clearly and everywhere set about solving it.
 Emerging from the captivity of the feudal censorship, we have no desire to
 become, and shall not become, prisoners of bourgeois-shopkeeper literary
 relations.  We want to establish, and we shall establish, a free press,
 free not simply from the police, but also from capital, from careerism,
 and what is more, free from bourgeois-anarchist individualism.
 ,These last words may sound paradoxical, or an affront to the reader.  What!
 some intellectual, an ardent champion of liberty, may shout.  What, you
 want to impose collective control on such a delicate, individual matter as
 literary work!  You want workmen to decide questions of science,
 philosophy, or aesthetics by a majority of votes!  You deny the absolute
 freedom of absolutely individual ideological work!
 Calm yourselves, gentlemen!  First of all, we are discussing party litera-
 ture and its subordination to party control.                        Everyone is free to write and
 say whatever he likes, without any restrictions.  But every voluntary
 association (including a party) is also free to expel members who use the
 name of the party to advocate antiparty views.   Freedom of speech and the
 press must be complete.  But then freedom of association must be complete
 too.  I am bound to accord you, in the name of free speech, the full right
 to shout, lie and write to your heart's content.  But you are bound to
 grant me, in the name of freedom of association, the right to enter into,
 or withdraw from, association with people advocating this or that view.
 The party is a voluntary association, which would inevitably break up,
 first ideologically; and then physically, if it did not cleanse itself of
 people advocating antiparty views.  And to define the borderline between
 party and antiparty there is the party program, the party's resolutions
 on tactics and its rules and, lastly, the entire experience of international
 social-democracy, the voluntary international associations of the prole-
 tariat, which has constantly brought into its parties individual elements
 and trends not fully consistent, not completely Marxist and not altogether
 correct and which, on the other hand, has constantly conducted periodical
 "cleansings" of its ranks.  So it will be with us too, supporters of
 bourgeois "freedom of criticism," /within/ the party.  We are now becoming
 a mass party all at once, changing abruptly to an open organization, and it
 is inevitable that we shall be joined by many who are inconsistent (from
 the Marxist standpoint), perhaps we shall be joined even by some

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 Christian elements, and even by some mystics.  We have sound stomachs and
 we are rock-like Marxists.  We shall digest these inconsistent elements.
 Freedom of thought and freedom of criticism within the party will never
 make us forget about the freedom of organizing people into those voluntary
 associations known as parties.
 Secondly, we must say to you bourgeois individualists that your talk about
 absolute freedom is sheer hypocrisy.  There can be no real and effective
 "freedom" in a society based on the power of money, in a society in which
 the masses of working people live in poverty and the handful of rich live
 like parasites.  Are you free in relation to your bourgeois publisher,
 Mr. Writer, in relation to your bourgeois public, which demands that you
 provide it with pornography in frames [novels] and paintings, and prostitu-
 tion as a "supplement" to "sacred" scenic art?  This absolute freedom is
 a bourgeois or an anarchist phrase (since, as a world outlook, anarchism
 is bourgeois philosophy turned inside out).  One cannot live in society
 and be free from society.  The freedom of the bourgeois writer, artist or
 actress is simply masked (or hypocritically masked) dependence on the
 money-bag, on corruption, on prostitution.
 And we socialists expose this hypocrisy and rip off the false labels, not
 in order to arrive at a nonclass literature and art (that will be possible
 only in a socialist extra-class society), but to contrast this hypocriti-
 cally free literature, which is in reality linked to the bourgeoisie, with
 a really free one that will be /openly/ linked to the proletariat.
 It will be a free literature, because the idea of socialism and sympathy
 with'the working people, and not greed or careerism, will bring ever new
 forces to its ranks.  It will be a free literature, because it will serve,
 not some satiated heroine, not the bored "upper ten thousand" suffering
 from fatty degeneration, but the millions and tens of millions of working
 people--the flower of the country, its strength and its future.   It will
 be a free literature, enriching the last word in the revolutionary thought
 of mankind with the experience and living work of the socialist proletariat,
 bringing about permanent interaction between the experience of the past
 (scientific socialism, the completion of the development of socialism from
 its primitive, utopian forms) and the. experience of the present (the
 present struggle of the worker comrades).
 To work, then, comrades!  We are faced with a new and difficult task.  But
 it is a noble and grateful one--to organize a broad, multiform and varied
 literature inseparably linked with the social-democratic working-class
 movement.  All social-democratic literature must become party literature.'
 Every newspaper, journal, publishing house, etc., must immediately set
 about reorganizing its work,, leading up to a situation in which it will,
 in one form or another, be integrated into one party organization or
 another.   Only then will "social-democratic" literature really become worthy
 of that name, only then will it be able to fulfill its duty and, even within

 [Article by office for editing and translating Lenin's and Stalin's works
 of the editorial and translation bureau of the CPC Central Committee]
 [Text]  There are not many words in the article written by Lenin more than
 70 years ago but the influence of the article is very great.  Starting
 from the 1930's, there have been many translations of the article in China.
 Some have even been included'in various versions of special collections
 of articles on literature and art by the classical writers.  However, there
 are many inaccuracies in some of the crucial places in all the Chinese
 translations, including the translation by our own bureau.   Misunderstand-
 ings have been caused.  For example, the expression "partiinaya literatura"
 (the second word comprises literature, documents and publications, but
 what is meant here is newspapers, periodicals and books).  This phrase is
 translated as "party literature" in all the existing Chinese translations.
 Such a phrasing could easily give people the erroneous understanding that
 the cultural and social phenomenon of literature is merely an accessory of
 the party.   Thus, we think it is necessary to check the translation again
 and correct the mistranslations.  In addition, we make a brief explanation
 of the background against which the article was written, the central
 features of the article and our translation.
 Lenin's article "Party Organization and Party Literature" was written in
 November 1905 at the climax.of the first Russian bourgeois democratic
 revolution.  The people's revolution which was started at the beginning of
 1905 reached its climax in the autumn.  The political strike throughout
 Russia in October was an augury of the coming of the revolutionary storm,
 the people's armed uprising was imminent.  Scared by the surging tide of
 revolution, the czarist government was forced to promulgate a "manifesto"
 on 17 October.  The people were promised certain civil rights and political
 freedom and that the legislative Duma (parliament) would be called.  While
 the situation of the revolution was rapidly developing at a tremendous pace,
 Lenin returned to St Petersburg from outside on 8 November to be in direct
 charge of the work of the CPSU Central Committee.  He directed the whole
 party to comprehensively and profoundly arouse and organize the masses,
 increasingly promote the consciousness of the democratic force which had

 the proletariat and the peasants as its mainstay and make preparations in
 ,various aspects for the armed uprising.  Lenin held that:  In order to
 strengthen the party's leadership in the revolutionary movement, the party's
 organization work, propaganda work and agitation work must be reorganized
 to meet the demands of the new situation.  No sooner had he returned to
 Russia than he published the series of such articles as "Party Organization
 and Party Literature," "The Proletariat and the Peasantry," "The Armed Forces
 and the Revolution," "Learn From the Enemy," "Revolutionary Office Routine
 and Revolutionary Action," "The Dying Autocracy and New Organs of Popular
 Rule," "The Socialist Party and the Nonparty Revolutionism" and "Socialism
 and Religion" and so on in NOVAYA ZHI2 , the first legal Bolshevik official
 newspaper.  "Party Organization and Party Literature" was one among these
 articles written at that time.  The content of these articles principally
 analyzed the situation of revolution and the political tendency of the
 various social forces, expounded the new task of struggle for the Russian
 proletariat and proposed a new form of work for the Russian Social Demo-
 cratic and Labor Party [RSDLP].
 Before returning to his country, Lenin pointed out in his letter to the
 RSDLP Central Committee that:   Since the situation of revolution develops
 rapidly, "the time is past for ideological leadership through 'whispering'
 in secret meeting places and rendezvous with agents!  Leadership should be
 through political literature" (literatura, which here means publications).
 ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 34, p 348)  In the past, there was not
 freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Russia.  It was impossible
 for the party to exercise its ideological leadership through the party's
 publications.  Now, there  was this possibility.  However, in order to make
 the party's legal newspaper become the party's publication in reality as well
 as in name and be able to shoulder the important task of ideological leader-
 ship, it was necessary to carry out the necessary reforms in written propa-
 ganda work.  Lenin's "Party Organization and Party Literature" was written
 to solve this problem.

 In this article, Lenin analyzes the situation in the country and the situa-
 tion of the party's propaganda through the newspapers and periodicals,
 proposes the party's principle of publication, discusses the position that
 the party's written propaganda occupies in the party's cause and the char-
 acteristics by which it differs from other work of the party and makes it
 clear that the relationship between the party and its propaganda organs
 (the newspapers, periodicals, the publishing houses and the publication
 departments and so on) is the relationship between the party, the sym-
 pathizers of the party and the party members who contribute articles to
 the party's publications.  Lenin makes a penetrating analysis of the char-
 acteristics of a writing career.  He points out that:  "There is no ques-
 tion, either, that in this field greater scope must undoubtedly be allowed
 for personal initiative, individual inclination, thought and fantasy, form

 Lenin repeatedly emphasized that the social democratic publications should
 become the party's publications and elaborated on the party's principle of
 publication. Lenin held that:  The written propaganda work should become
 a component of the party's cause; the party's newspapers, magazines and
 other publications should propagate the party's views with a clear-cut
 stand.  The writers who contribute articles to the party's publications,
 in particular the party member writers, should maintain unity with the
 party's views.  It is absolutely forbidden to discard the party's views.
 In,order to ensure the enforcement of the above principles, Lenin demanded
 that party member writers join one of the party organizations.  Party
 organizations were to adopt measures to handle party members who violated
 this principle or propagated views against the party until they were
 expelled from the party.  Propaganda organs such as newspapers, magazines
 and publishing houses were to be subject to the party's supervision, report
 their work to the party and appeal to the workers, the party members and
 the masses to pay close attention to and supervise this aspect of their
 work.  These views are the central theme and principal features of Lenin's
 article.
 Lenin emphasized the problem of the party character of the publications and
 the party member writers.  This was closely related to the historical stage
 in which the Russian revolution was to be found at that time, the con-
 temporary social environment and the struggle inside the Russian Social
 Democratic Party.  The 1905 Russian revolution was a bourgeois democratic
 revolution.  The revolution had an extensive social base.  In addition to
 a handful of royalists, there were all kinds of social forces which took
 part in, supported or sympathized with the revolution.  Thus, it seemed
 that the revolution was a revolution "of the whole people."  In order to
 conceal its interests and purposes,'the bourgeoisie spared no effort to
 disguise itself as the political representative "of the whole people."
 In addition, the bourgeoisie propagated the supra-class and supra-party
 "nonparty" ideology and advicated bourgeois anarchic and individualistic
 ideas such as "absolute freedom of creation" and "freedom of criticism"
 and so on.
 The proletariat and its party took part in the revolution to achieve the
 party's minimum program.  This was of course to pave the way for the
 development of capitalism, but this was not its purpose.  The proletariat
 took part in the bourgeois democratic revolution in order to thoroughly
 overthrow the feudal autocratic system, eliminate the remnants of serfdom
 and create conditions for overthrowing the bourgeoisie in the next step
 and realizing the socialist revolution.  Thus, the proletariat had to
 maintain its political independence in the bourgeois democratic revolution,
 the 'proletarian party had to adhere to a clear-cut party character, criti-
 cize the "nonparty" ideology and resist the corrosion of anarchism and
 individualism.
 The above bourgeois ideology was influential inside the RSDLP.  At that
 time, the Mensheviks were a part of the party in form, though politically,
 .they tagged behind the bourgeoisie.  In the ideological aspect, they had
 completely abandoned the struggle against the influence of the bourgeoisie

 and did not supervise their official publications and party member writers.
 The "Organizational Program" passed by the 1905 Menshevik Congress did not
 stipulate that the party member writers must have any relationship with the
 official publications.  Some Menshevik writers published their views, which
 openly violated the party program, in the publications of the liberal clique,
 Plekhanov placed himself above the party and published the "Journals of a
 Social Democrat" by himself.. In this way, a situation in which "the publi-
 cists are outside the party, above the party" and a situation of "the party
 unto itself, and the publicists unto themselves" emerged.  ("Collected Works
 of Lenin," Vol 8, p 515)  In the NOVAYA ZHIZN, the first legal Bolshevik
 official newspaper, articles'with a mystic flavor and in conflict with the
 party's world outlook had appeared.  Lenin gave an angry reprimand:  "Away
 with writers without party characteristics!  Away with superman writers!"
 Lenin said this in view of the contemporary situation.
 Lenin expected that the bourgeois intellectuals who advocated "absolute
 freedom of creation" would certainly condemn the ideas which he expounded
 concerning the party's publications.  Thus, he devoted much space to criti-
 cizing and refuting the arguments for "absolute freedom of creation."
 1) Lenin proceeded from "freedom of association," the party's organizational
 principle and organization discipline to criticize such arguments and
 clearly pointed out that the party "is also free to expel members who use
 the name-of the party to advocate antiparty views"; 2) Lenin proceeded from
 the historical materialist principle that all ideologies in the confronta-
 tion between the classes and society have class character.  He had revealed
 that?the so-called "absolute freedom of creation," which meant the freedom
 that divorced itself from social class, could not exist in a class society.
 "The arguments for absolute freedom are only hypocrisy."  Precisely in this
 place, Lenin directly touched upon the problem of the class character of
 literature and art as a component of ideology.  He pointed out that the
 freedom the bourgeois writers, painters and actresses enjoyed was the
 dependence on'the bourgeoisie in disguise and that nonparty literature and
 art could only exist in a classless society.
 Thus, we can see that Lenin's article does in fact discuss the question of
 literature and art.  In the article, the discussion on writings and the
 career of writing includes literature ana can be applied to literature.
 This is Lenin's important contribution to the Marxist theory of literature
 and art.  However, when we consider the background in which the article was
 written when reading through it all, we still cannot say that the question
 of literature is the article's central feature.
 Finally, we would like to say something about the question of translation.
 The word "literatura" runs through the entire article.  The origin of this
 word is the Latin word "litteratura."  It'is commonly used in many Western
 languages.  It is a word with more than one meaning.  Its important meanings
 include:  1) It refers to anything put into words in ageneral sense, meaning
 written works; 2) it refers to all forms of literary works which means
 "literature" in a specific sense as said in modern Chinese.  In order to
 distinguish it from other writing, in Russian, the restrictive attribute is
 sometimes added and the word is written as "khudozhestvennaya literatura"

 (artistics works, sometimes rendered as artistic literature); 3) it is the
 collective term for publications in a certain aspect or sphere of knowledge.
 "Literator" may have the combined meaning of man of letters, writer and
 author.  In modern Chinese, there is no readymade word directly correspond-
 ing to these two words.  In translating these two words, we can only depend
 on the different meanings which the two words have in different linguistic
 contexts to render "literatura" as "documents," "writings," "literature,"
 "publications," "books and periodicals" and "readers" while "literator" is
 rendered as "writer," "author," "man of letters" and "literary figure" and
 so on.  The expression "partiinaya literatura" appears many times in Lenin's
 works.  What is the meaning of it?  When we speak of its form, it means the
 newspapers, magazines, pamphlets and leaflets published by the party; when
 we talk about its nature, it means the publications which are subject to the
 political, ideological and organizational leadership and supervision of the
 party and which maintain unity with the party's views, meaning that they
 follow the party's program and constitution and implement the party's
 policies, strategy and line.  As early as in the party building period,
 Lenin had begun to use this expression.  He held that in order to overcome
 the "handicraft form" in which the small groups conducted their scattered.
 activities and build a unified party, it was necessary to establish a com-
 mon literature (literatura).                In his "A Draft, Program of Our Party" written
 in 1899, he said:  "The need for unity, for the establishment of common
 literature (literatura), for the appearance of a Russian worers' newspaper
 arises out of the real situation."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 4,  .
 p 201)  In 1900, in his "Draft of a Declaration of the Editorial Board of'
 Iskra and Azrya" and "Declaration of the Editorial Board of Iskra," Lenin
 further explained why "it is necessary to develop a common party literature
 (partiinaya literatura)," "a common literature, consistent in principle and
 capable of ideologically uniting revolutionary social democracy."  ("Collected
 Works of Lenin," Vol 4, pp 286, 316)  In 1903, Lenin wrote the "Draft Resolu-
 tion on Party Literature (Partiinaya Literatura)" for the second congress of
 the RSDLP.  In the article, he mentions that there was "the absolute and
 urgent necessity for a wide production of popular social democratic litera-
 ture for all sections of the, population and for the working class masses in
 particular."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 6, p 427)  The resolution
 "On Party Literature (0 Partinoi Literature)" passed by this congress
 pointed out that:  With the comprehensive development of the labor movement,
 we should correspondingly make the masses of workers understand the recent
 target and ultimate goal of the Social Democratic Party as clearly as
 possible.  The resolutions demanded:  1) Run the party's "central official
 newspaper" well; 2) turn the'"Azrya" into the "party's official publication";
 3) "edit and write separate editions of reading materials which are rich in
 content."  ("Collected Resolutions of the CPSU," Book 1, p 57)  In June 1905,
 in his "Preface to the Pamphlet 'Workers on the Split in the Party,"' Lenin
 pointed out that one of the organizational foundations for the combination
 of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks was that:  "All party publications (partiinaya
 literatura), both local and central, must be completely subordinate to both
 the party congress and the relevant central or local organization of the
 party.  The existence of party publications (partiinaya literatura)..uncon-
 nected with.the party is not allowed."                   ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 9,
 pp 152-153)  There are many occasions when Lenin used'the expression party
 publications.  However, no more examples will be cited here.

 In all the volumes of the Chinese translation of the "Collected Works of
 Lenin," there are many translations for the expression "partiinaya
 literatura," which are, in most cases, quite accurate.  It is translated
 as "party books and publications," "party newspapers and publications" and
 "party publications" and so on.  However, in this article, the translation
 in the past has been inherited, it is translated as "party literature."  In
 classical Chinese, the term "literature" may mean the written philosophical,
 historical and literary works in a general sense.  However, in modern
 Chinese, the term has a fixed meaning.  It refers to the art of language.
 Thus, it is inappropriate to render the expression as "party literature."
 Since Chinese and Russian are, two different languages, it is difficult to
 find words in the two languages which correspond completely with each
 other.  How to translate the word "literatura" is really a difficult prob-
 lem.  Having asked the opinions of many people and made studies on the
 problem, "literatura" is translated as "publications" and writing" in
 different contexts in the new translation.  In the case in which literature
 is discussed, the word is still translated as "literature"; "literator" is
 translated as "author."  In this way, theoretical and political writings,
 political comments and literary creations can be included.  This may be
 closer to the meaning of the word.
 Of course, if we examine the question from the angle of translation, there
 are still shortcomings:  1) Unanimity in translation has not been achieved.
 There are three translations for the word "literatura" in the same article.
 2) In the original, the word has many meanings including the meaning
 "literature," however, in the Chinese translation, it is rendered as "pub-
 lications."  In this way, it is not obvious that it has the meaning of
 literature, or it is hard to see that it has such a meaning.  In the origi-
 nal, literally, the expression "printsip partinoi literatury" is related
 to "the party character principle of literature."  However, we cannot see
 the relation from the expression "the party's principle of publications" in
 the Chinese translation.  There are doubtless limitations in translation
 caused by the differences between the two languages.  However, after weigh-
 ing up the advantages and disadvantages, we should first of all be faithful
 to the spiritual substance of Leninism.  As for the difference in linguistic
 form, under the condition that the difference cannot be settled by trans-
 lation, this should be subordinate to the content.
 The checking this time has principally corrected the translation of the
 above key words.  In addition, some other inaccuracies in the translation
 have been corrected.  Due to our limited level, it is possible that there
 are still mistakes.   Readers, please criticize them and point them out.

 HAVE FULL FAITH IN EFFECTING A FUNDAMENTAL TURN FOR THE BETTER IN PARTY
 STYLE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 9-13
 [Article by commentator]
 [Text]  The 12th CPC Congress has affirmed the general task of the party in
 the new historical period and raised the inspiring call of creating a new
 situation in all fields of socialist modernization.  Based on the demands
 of the general task of the new period in the 5 years from this congress to
 the next congress, our whole work in broad outline is to energetically
 push forward the building of socialist material civilization as well as
 spiritual civilization, unremittingly strengthen socialist democracy and
 the legal system, conscientiously rectify party style and organization and
 strive for a fundamental turn for the better in the condition of state
 finance and economy, a fundamental turn for the better in social conven-
 tion and a fundamental turn for the better in party style.  The three
 fundamental turns for the better can be described as the only road in
 proceeding from present reality toward our magnificent goal.  Among them,
 the one with crucial significance is the fundamental turn for the better in
 party style.
 Precisely because our party is armed with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong
 Thought, it is a mature and serious party which has been repeatedly tested
 by setbacks and successes.  Therefore, we have not and will not be intoxi-
 cated by the successes already achieved or remain stationary in the face of
 such successes.  We hold that there are still many shortcomings, still many
 difficulties and still all sorts of things which are not as good as expected
 in our work.  Our party is soberly aware of the gap which actually exists
 between its own position and its object of struggle, and is making great
 efforts to find practical and effective measures for solving various real
 problems.  In its field of activities, one of the greatest advantages of the
 political strategy of our party is its skill in grasping the most vital
 trend and in finding out and firmly holding the basic link which is of
 decisive significance to the overall situation.  Lenin pointed out:  "Polit-
 ical events are very confused and complicated.  They can be compared with a
 chain.  To hold the whole chain, you must grasp the main link."  ("Collected
 Works of Lenin," Vol 33, p 267)  Accordipg to him, grasping this kind of
 link could be described as the "complete art of the politician."  To achieve

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100420001-1
 a fundamental turn for the better in the whole work of our party and state
 at present is one of the basic or vital links described by Lenin.
 The report to the 12th party congress reiterated an important thesis put
 forwatd by Comrade Chen Yun long ago:  The style of a party in power deter-
 mines its very survival.  At the same time, this also has a bearing on the
 rise and fall of our whole country and nation and on the success or failure
 of the socialist cause. Our party is the leader of economic construction,
 the leader of political power and the leader of all aspects of national life
 and all aspects of socialist-undertakings.  The line, policies and prin-
 ciples of the party must pass through party members at various levels and
 through the work and exemplary role of party members found everywhere all
 over the country before they can be understood and accepted by the broad
 masses of people and become their immense strength for transforming the
 world.  Therefore, a fundamental turn for the better in the condition of our
 state finance and economy as well as social convention, even down to the
 progress and development in various fields of socialist undertakings, cannot
 be separated from the fundamental turn for the better in party style.  This
 condition also applies to a district, a department or a unit.  If the party
 organization there is strong and united and can implement the line, policies
 and principles of the party in the light of its own specific conditions and
 if the party members and especially the party cadres holding leading posts
 can modestly listen to the voices of the people, serve the people whole-
 heartedly, put others before themselves, show integrity and public spirit
 and work diligently and conscientiously with a spirit of dedication, then
 their work will certainly be very outstanding.  Conversely, in places where
 little or no success has bee achieved in work and in places where issues
 are tangled up and mistakes.are often made, some of the reasons for this
 kind of situation can always be traced to the conditions of party style
 there.  Party leadership is not just issuing instructions and giving orders.
 It can never be separated from the exemplary vanguard role of the party mem-
 bers and the leading party cadres in particular.  If the party members
 themselves are unwilling to do good work, then it is very difficult to
 arouse the masses to do so.~ If-the party members themselves are unwilling
 to correct mistakes, then it is very difficult to help others correct mis-
 takes.  This exemplary vanguard role of party members is an unshirkable duty
 in party leadership and it is an inseparable as well as extremely important
 part of adhering to and improving party leadership.  "To correct others one
 must first correct oneself."  This old maxim expressed by our people is a
 popular as well as profound truth.  In a big country with 1 billion people,
 as long as the 40 million party members who form the vanguard of the working
 class and above all the comrades holding leading posts among them are
 worthy of the historical responsibility entrusted them by the people and
 if they really can become the quintessence and mainstay of socialist mod-
 ernization and show a high degree of political consciousness, lofty com-
 munist ethics, strict discipline and an-ability to cope with work in
 various fields, then a good work style of everybody united as one from top
 to bottom and working with one heart and one mind will appear.  The broad
 masses of people will certainly closely finite round the party and will join
 us in overcoming various difficulties and obstacles on the path of advance,

 triumphing over all sorts of enemies and making a success of socialist
 modernization.
 The task of effecting a fundamental turn for the better in party style
 solemnly affirmed by our party at its 12th congress has explained that not
 just a handful of comrades, but those from the highest leading body to the
 broad masses of party members have already fully understood its important
 significance.  The party has noticed that inside the Communist Party, an
 extremely small section of the members, the absolute number of whom is not
 small, have demonstrated by their own deeds and words that they do not
 deserve the glorious title of Communist Party members.  At present, it is
 true'that inside the Communist Party, there is the problem of ideological
 and organizational impurity and impure work style.  Facts have illustrated
 that not all veteran party members can in the same way withstand the tests
 of.defeat and success or of bayonets and flattery.  Under peaceful circum-
 stances, along with the change of the party's position in the entire
 national life, certain people with evil designs have used joining the party
 as the ladder to acquiring personal gains, gratifying their lust for power
 and enjoying material comforts.  Some people with selfish motives and even
 speculators and careerists, have quite easily wormed their way into the
 party and quite easily concealed their identity.  The effect of the serious
 damage caused ideologically, politically and organizationally to the party
 during the 10 years of the "Great Cultural Revolution" can never be elimi-
 nated within a short time.  A handful of remnant elements are even now
 unjustly occupying certain leading posts and waiting for an opportunity to
 make trouble.  To those people in the party whose will is not strong, the
 policy of promoting economic exchanges with foreign countries and livening
 up the economy at home in recent years has provided them with objective
 conditions for becoming corrupt.  Some party organizations have become weak
 and lax, and some basic level organizations are paralyzed.  A handful of
 cadres have gone in for bilreaucratism, privileged style and factional
 activities.  Some have practiced corruption and graft, engaged in malprac-
 tice for selfish ends and committed serious economic crimes.  All these
 have caused great resentment among the broad masses of party members and
 people, greatly hindered the healthy development of modernization and
 damaged the image of the party.  If such conditions are allowed to exist
 and spread unchecked, the destiny of the socialist cause would be dreadful
 to contemplate.  This cannot be tolerated by the party and the people of
 various nationalities.
 We should also see that the new historical conditions and task not only
 require us to clean ourselves and show not the slightest mercy to various
 unhealthy tendencies, but they also require us to make new discoveries and
 breakthroughs in the series of work.  The party must become the leader of
 socialist modernization and every party member must advance along the foot-
 prints of time.  In restoring, upholding and developing the various fine
 traditions, we must keep on heightening our communist consciousness, open up
 new fields of knowledge, create new work methods and cultivate a new style.
 In short, the accumulated problems left behind over the years have yet to be
 solved and the gap between the higher demands put to us by the historical

 tasks and-the existing conditions must be filled.  This means that we can-
 not but give the highest priority to carrying out party consolidation step
 by step in a planned manner.  The 12th party congress has decided that
 beginning from the second half of next year, 3 years will be spent in
 carrying out a' comprehensive rectification of party work style and party
 organization by stages and in groups.  In the party consolidation, we must
 of course strive to eliminate the dark side, but at the same time, we must
 also strive to consolidate, develop and keep on opening up the bright side.
 This decision of the 12th party congress not only has the support of the
 comrades of the whole party, but it has also further strengthened the
 confidence of people of various nationalities throughout the country in
 the party.
 Some comrades do not have enough confidence that the party style will make
 a fundamental turn for the better.  They hold that the Central Committee has
 made repeated injunctions in recent years and even after the "guiding prin-
 ciples for internal party political life" has been transmitted and the
 "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the
 Founding of the PRC" has been adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee, some people still pay no heed to the instruc-
 tions of the Central Committee and still stick to the old way of doing
 things and there is still not much change in the unhealthy tendency of
 using one's power to seek personal gain among the cadres, including the
 leading party cadres.  In a certain sense, these comrades are soberly
 aware of the present condition in party style and have an urgent desire to
 effect a turn for the better in party style as quickly as possible.  This
 is a good point.  Compared with the Yanan period and the early period of the
 founding of the People's Republic, there is obviously still quite a gap in
 the condition of the present party style in many respects.  However, there
 is definitely an improvement in the present party style compared with the
 "Great Cultural Revolution" and the 2 years immediately after the "Great
 Cultural Revolution."  It has neither gone backward nor regained its
 original tempo.  The reason why party style has so far not made a funda-
 mental turn for the better only explains the seriousness of the longstand-
 ing malpractice and explains the need to make greater efforts because of
 'this, but it cannot illustrate that it is impossible to effect a fundamental
 turn for the better in party style.  All Communist Party members and espe-
 cially party members holding leading posts, should not only use practical
 actions to overcome their own unhealthy tendencies, but they also have no
 right whatsoever to adopt an attitude of cool detachment toward the
 unhealthy tendencies of other people, or', apart from expressing appropriate
 indignation, only moan and sigh without doing anything.  The important
 matter is not only in understanding the world but also in transforming the
 world.  Transforming old work style and habits detrimental to the healthy
 development of the cause of the people, including the phenomenon of improper
 party style, is the sacred duty as well as responsibility of communists.  We
 believe that even among comrades without sufficient confidence that the party
 style will make a fundamental turn for the better, most of them still support
 the line, policies and principles of the party, observe discipline and law
 and work conscientiously for the people.  If these comrades will truly set a
 strict demand on themselves, uphold principles and wage an effective struggle

 together with the broad masses of party members and people against the
 phenomenon of improper party style, the power to carry forward healthy
 tendencies will be greatly enhanced.
 This effecting a fundamental turn for the better in party style in the 5
 years from this party congress to the next party congress is not just an
 inspiring slogan, but is also a solemn fighting task that should and must
 be .fulfilled.  This is not something prompted by a sudden impulse or
 thought up on the spur of the moment, but it is a goal determined by the
 CPC Central Committee as a result of making careful considerations,
 centralizing the common aspirations of the comrades of the whole party as
 well as the people of various nationalities and scientifically analyzing
 various subjective and objective factors.  We can study the possibility and
 inevitability of this goal from many directions.  What this article refers
 to are only its main points.
 1.  The leadership of the CPC Central Committee is correct, firm and united.
 In addition, a Marxist line and a series of policies and principles have
 been formulated.  In the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of
 Our Party Since the Foundingtof the PRC," our party has affirmed the
 criteria for determining important historical rights and wrongs of the
 last 30 years and in the report of the 12th party congress, further summed
 up the work carried out since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee and set our various grand tasks in line with objective
 foundations.  After several years of effort, the leading bodies of the
 state at various levels have been readjusted, restructured and improved.
 Generally speaking, the power of leadership of organizations at various
 levels has already been basically placed in the hands of cadres loyal to
 the party and the people.
 2.  The masses of Communist Party members, regardless of whether prole-
 tarian revolutionaries of the older generation or comrades who joined the
 party at different periods after the founding of the People's Republic,
 including most of the comrades who joined the party during the "Great
 Cultural Revolution," have all stood severe positive and negative tests
 and they have learned much from history and actual practice.  The party is
 making progress, and'the party members are also making progress.  Since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the masses of party
 members have resolutely implemented the line, policies and principles of
 the party, worked together with the masses in labor, work and battle posts
 and played the hardcore role and exemplary role in the building of socialist
 material civilization as well as spiritual civilization and in the struggle
 against unhealthy tendencies and criminal activities.  This is the main
 aspect of the ranks of our party.
 3.  The state is beginning to take the road to a truly healthy socialist
 system.  Various laws, decrees and regulations for promoting orderly pro-
 duction, work and study as well as normalization of all aspects of social
 life,have been promulgated or are being formulated and have been made more
 and more complete.  We have already the first set of criminal law as well

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 as law of criminal procedure since the founding of the People's Republic,
 and the fifth session of the Fifth National People's Congress will also
 approve the new party constitution.  We should say that how to become a
 qualified citizen, a qualified party. member and a qualified party cadre
 is no longer restricted to a general appeal, but we have a series of
 clearly defined provisions imbued with the binding force of law and party
 regulation which can be followed.  The party upholds the principle that
 party members and nonparty members are all equal before the state law and
 all party members are equal before the party constitution.  On the basis of
 carrying out full investigation and study and respecting facts, we have
 adhered to the chosen course of safeguarding the interests of the people
 as well as the political dignity of the party and seriously dealt with many
 cases of violation of law and discipline.
 4.  As our party is in the position of leading the political power as well
 as all aspects of work of the whole country, the question of party style
 is particularly important for it has a bearing on the party and the masses.
 Under the difficult circumstances of the revolutionary war and peaceful
 construction in the 60 years since its founding, our party has developed a
 profound feeling for the people of various nationalities in China.  The
 people warmly love, respect and trust the party and they place great hopes
 on the party.  If we apply to China the words which Lenin used in appraising
 the Bolshevik Party, then we can say that the great CPC has indeed become
 the wisdom, honor and conscience of our era.  The line, policies and prin-
 ciples of the party in recent years have greatly heightened the socialist
 enthusiasm as well as initiative of the masses.  These lines, policies and
 principles have been formulated by our party by respecting the creative
 spirit of the people, summing up the experiences of creative labor carried
 out by the people and complying with the demands of the people and the
 trend of historical development.  Their implementation has consequently
 produced outstanding results, and they have not only restored but also
 enhanced the prestige of the party.  More and more workers, peasants and
 intellectuals are supporting the party and more and more people have linked
 their destiny with the party.  Their political consciousness, creative
 spirit and historical responsibility are increasingly promoted.  In this
 way, in promoting party work and supervising every party member, they play
 an increasingly important role.  This has become a tremendous force for
 effecting a fundamental turn for the better in party style.
 5.   Since the 3d Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, the focal
 point of our work has been shifted to the track of building socialist
 modernization.  Just as Marx said:  "The coincidence of the changing of
 circumstances and of human activity can only be conceived and rationally
 understood as revolutionary practice."  ("Selected Works of Marx and
 Engels," Vol 1, p 17)  He also strongly criticized the idealist concept of
 splitting individual transformation from social development and blindly
 seeking historical dynamics in spiritual and moral self-perfection.
 According to the founder of Marxism, only by changing circumstances could
 the proletariat no longer be "old people" and "in the revolutionary
 activity of changing circumstances, they will at the same time also trans-
 form themselves."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 234)  The

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100420001-1
 great significance of this strategic policy-decision of shifting the focus
 of work will not only enable all our work to be henceforth placed on the
 correct track, but it will also inevitably lead to a profound change in
 the mode of activity and mode of thinking of the whole society including
 everyone.  This inexorable trend of historical development cannot but
 demand a fundamental turn for the better in party style and also cannot
 but promote a fundamental turn for the better in party style.
 6.  The CPC Central Committee not only has resolute determination and care-
 ful policies, but also effective measures and clear steps for effecting a
 fundamental turn for the better in party style.  This will be mainly
 achieved through party consolidation.  The report of the 12th party con-
 gress pointed out:  The overall rectification of party style and consolida-
 tion of party organizations can only be achieved on the basis of thorough-
 going ideological education.  The consolidation will start with the leading
 organs and cadres. We must follow the principles of "learning from past
 mistakes to avoid future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient"
 and "clarity in ideology and unity among comrades," conscientiously develop
 criticism and self-criticism and take appropriate measures to solicitate
 opinions from the masses.  In the final stage there will be a reregistration
 of all party members.  We must take necessary organization measures to expel
 from the party those who still fail to meet the requirements for membership
 after education.  At the same time, we must work out concrete methods to
 strengthen and improve party leadership so as to effect an improvement in
 the work of party organizations at all levels.  These policies and measures
 summed up from the experiences of both the positive as well as negative
 aspects in our party history will certainly produce the desired result in
 practice.
 People are learning from history and from the practice of the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.  We can gladly say that the
 serious damage to the prestige of socialism and Marxism has to a great
 extent been reversed.  The so-called question of "confidence crisis,"
 which created a racket for some time, has not been able to stop the
 progress of our cause.  Apart from a handful of people who stand against
 the cause of the people, more and more of those among our comrades who lack
 sufficient confidence of effecting a fundamental turn for the better in
 party style, will doubtless, after patient and fully convincing ideological
 education, gradually change in the face of reality.  A true communist does
 not require cheap confidence.  He needs actual confidence.  The most con-
 vincing education is the conscientious implementation of the guidelines of
 the 12th party congress and the action of the party members and party
 cadres themselves.  On the other hand, we should admit that there has been
 a dark side in the past in the work of our party and government, there is a
 dark side at present and there will also be a dark side in the future.  How-
 ever,;in the history of the 60 years and more since the founding of the
 party, the history of the 30 years and more since the founding of the
 People's Republic and the history of the 4 years since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the history has always been that
 of the bright side triumphing over the dark side and the bright side con-
 stantly expanding.  This is the history of the glorious chapter written by

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 tens of thousands of party members in their selfless struggle for the lib-
 eration cause of the nation and people.  The entire history of the past has
 proved that our people are undefeatable.  Precisely the opposite, all
 enemies and difficulties will suffer defeat before our party and people.
 During the 10 years of the "Great Cultural Revolution," the Lin Biao-Jiang
 Qing counterrevolutionary cliques usurped an important part of party and
 state power and their influence spread all over the country.  However,
 final victory did not belong to them but to our party and people.  Judging
 from the angle of party style alone, no problem has been more serious than
 that decade in the 30 years and more since the founding of the People's
 Republic.  The situation at present is entirely different from the past.
 The unfavorable factors are being overcome by us one by one, and more and
 more favorable factors have appeared.  Under this kind of situation, there
 is no basis whatsoever for losing confidence in the party style making
 a fundamental turn for the better.  We not only must accurately recognize
 the existing state of affairs, but we must also accurately see the
 inexorable trend of its development.   If we ignore and cannot fully
 appraise the bright side of our work, or if we are not adept at observing
 the process of the bright side triumphing-over the dark side in life, this
 at least is a reflection of one-sidedness in understanding.  From the 3d
 Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee to the 12th party con-
 gress.and since the 12th party congress, the unremitting progress in all our
 work is actually playing an increasingly important role in effecting a
 fundamental turn for the better in party style.  This is our reality and
 this is where our hopes lie.
 Effecting a fundamental turn for the better in party style within 5 years
 is the prerequisite as well as basis for the flourishing development of our
 socialist cause in the next decade and more.  Without, the success of these
 5 years, we cannot talk about future successes.  We should and must, during
 the fundamental turn for the better in party style, create a new situation
 in the building of socialist modernization.   We profoundly believe that
 under the guidance of the 12th party congress, the broad masses of party
 members will struggle resolutely and persistently together with the broad
 masses of people and make proper contributions in way of changing the
 ideological and organizational impurity and impure work style in the party
 at present, and in way of bringing the cadre ranks more in line with the
 demands of socialist modernization.

 PARTY CONSOLIDATION IS A MATTER OF PRIME IMPORTANCE TO OUR PARTY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 14-19
 [Article by Duan Junyi [3008 0689 3015]]
 [Text]  While setting forth the fighting program for the new historical
 period to the whole party and the people of all nationalities throughout
 the country, it was solemnly declared at the 12th CPC Congress that:  "To
 achieve a fundamental turn for the better in our party style, the CPC
 Central Committee has decided-on an overall rectification of party style
 and consolidation of party organizations, which will proceed by stages and
 by groups over a period of 3 years beginning from the latter half of 1983."
 This is a matter of prime importance to our party and a pressing strategic
 task entrusted to it by history since the development of the communist
 movement.  The 1942 Yanan rectification movement was carried out after the
 historic change of our party during the democratic revolution period, and
 resulted in greatly raising the Marxist-Leninist level of the whole party
 and promoting unprecedented unity throughout the whole party.  It enabled
 our party to grow to maturity and thus win victory in the war of resistance
 against Japan and the liberation war, and establish a new China.  The
 present party rectification is to be carried out after another historic
 change of our party in the socialist period, and at a time when the party
 has gained a more mature understanding of the cause of socialist revolution
 and construction.  We are sure that this rectification will heal the deep
 wounds inflicted on our party by the decade of internal disorder and bring
 about the fundamental turn for the better in our party style, so that our
 party will be more vigorous and, in the new historical period, hold high
 the banner of communism and lead the people of all nationalities throughout
 the country to achieve a triumphant victory in creating a new situation in
 all fields of socialist modernization.
 In his report to the 12th CPC Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang's exposition on
 party rectification and his analysis on the situation'within the party was
 absolutely correct.  In the light of my own understanding, linked with the
 conditions of Beijing municipality, there follow some of my opinions on the
 work of party consolidation.

 The Necessity and Great Significance of Party Consolidation
 Our party is the vanguard of the working class, armed with Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  In the struggle to lead the Chinese people
 in their fight to realize the communist ideal, and through repeated temper"
 ing and all kinds of severe tests, our party has gained the mettle and
 capability to bring about a radical change in the situation.  Since the
 smashing of the Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique in 1976, and par-
 ticularly since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,
 our party has accomplished in a few years:  the arduous task of bringing
 order out of chaos in its guiding ideology, achieved major victories in
 setting things right in its practical work on various fronts and effected
 a historic change.  History has once again proved that the CPC is worthy
 of its role as a solid core leading the people of all nationalities of
 China, and is sure to lead this huge vessel of China's socialism to sur-
 mount numerous difficulties under all kinds of complicated situations,
 and brave wind and waves to advance toward the brilliant future of com-
 munism.
 Why then has the party solemnly set forth the task of party consolidation
 again, after it has led the people of the whole country in effecting this
 historic change?  What is it's necessity, and its great significance?
 First, the key to fulfilling the fighting program put forward by the 12th
 CPC Congress in the new historical period is to consolidate the party well.
 Historical experience teaches us that whenever the communist movement has
 developed to a new historical stage, particularly after effecting a historic
 change, there is bound to emerge a new period of vigorous development.
 Under these circumstances, for the sake Of creating a new situation able to
 meet the needs of the new development of-history, it is imperative to con-
 centratedly and universally conduct education in Marxism throughout the
 party, rectify its ideology and style and consolidate its organization,
 solve all the contradictions that do not comply with the new historic
 development, arm the whole party with the line, principles and policies of
 the new period, deepen our understanding, unify our thinking, enhance our
 fighting capacity and lead the broad masses of people in their struggle to
 attain the magnificent new task.
 The consolidation of the party we are faced with at present has the sole
 purpose, of further eliminating the negative consequences left over by the
 10 years of internal disorder, creating ,a new situation in all fields of
 socialist modernization and attaining the fighting program put forward by
 the 12th CPC Congress.  In order to attain the three  fundamental turns
 for the better in the state's financial situation, social mood and party
 style, we must first of all strive to attain the fundamental turn for the
 better in p rty style.  Because only through consolidating the party and
 attaining the fundamental turn for the better in party style can we lead
 the fundamental turn for the better in social mood, which is also conducive
 to promoting the fundamental betterment'6f the state's financial situation.
 In order to create a new situation in all fields of socialist modernization

 and do a good job in the building of socialist economy, politics and
 spiritual civilization with communist ideology as its core, it is necessary
 hbove all to build well the CPC, which is the core leading our cause,
 through rectifying party style and consolidating party organization.  Under
 the leadership of the party, only by carrying forward the spirit of crea-
 tiveness, innovation and forging ahead proper for a party member, setting an
 example and leading the broad masses of people in fighting with one heart
 and mind and exerting themselves in the struggle, can we attain the new,
 great task put forward by the 12th CPC Congress.  In,~working for the four
 political guarantees of socialist modernization, the fundamental guarantee
 is to consolidate the party.
 Second, in view of the problems existing within the party and the historical
 conditions facing us, it is imperative to consolidate the party.
 Due to the decade of internal disorder caused by the "Great Cultural Revolu-
 tion," the ideological and organizational building of the party were seri-
 ously sabotaged.  The party organization of Beijing municipality suffered
 serious destruction.  Through the restoration and consolidation carried out
 in the past few years, particularly the readjustment carried out at all
 levels of leadership bodies, the situation has greatly improved.  Most of
 the party organizations and leadership bodies are good, and better than
 they were.  They have resolutely supported and implemented the party's line,
 principles and policies since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee and made tremendous efforts in the arduous struggle to
 set things right.  They have achieved marked results and played the role of
 proletarian vanguards.  The party organizations of the Shoudu Iron and
 Steel Company, Beijing coking plant, Beijing optical instrument factory,
 Beijing machinery factory, Beijing second cotton mill and other units are
 the outstanding representatives among them.  But there still exist a lot of
 problems of ideology, organization and style in some of the party organiza-
 tions and leadership bodies.  According to an investigation and analysis
 made on 3,658 party branches in Beijing municipality, less than one-third of
 advanced party branches were correct in their line, united in their leading
 bodies and able to play the role of a fighting force.  Around 60 percent of
 the branches were in a mediocre condition, 10 percent were backward, and
 among them, some branches were in a state of paralysis or semiparalysis.
 The main problems existing in the backward branches were:  1) Leading
 members were not united, each had cliques of their own engaged in factional-
 ism, and tried to seize power and blame others; 2) their ideological lines
 were not correct.  They had a cynical and resistant attitude toward party
 policies, were despondent and did not properly do their work; 3) they made
 use of their authority to seek private gains and privileges and even formed
 cliques to pursue selfish interests.  They practiced dishonest methods and
 violated the law and discipline; and 4) they practiced decentralism with
 regard to the higher levels by doing things in their own way and practiced
 "what. I say goes" toward lower levels.  Similar states of affairs also
 existed to a certain extent in the party organizations of a number of units,
 and particularly the problems of leading bodies being weak, slack and low
 in revolutionary enthusiasm were quite serious.  It will be impossible to
 fundamentally restore and enhance the fighting capacity of the party

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 organizations if we do not find a remedy to these cases and treat all of
 them by consolidating the party.
 In view of the conditions of the broad masses of party members, among the
 650,000 party members in Beijing municipality, 310,000 joined the party
 before the "Great Cultural Revolution," 250,000 joined the party during the
 "Great Cultural Revolution" and 90,000 were admitted to the party after the
 downfall of the Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique.  The majority of
 the party members are good and relatively good.  Many of our outstanding
 party members have, played an exemplary vanguard role on various fronts,
 united the masses in working hard for the socialist cause and firmly stood
 in the forefront of setting things right.  Among them there were people
 praised by the masses, such as the advanced activist who "worked ahead of
 time," the "iron man" who continuously worked in the first line down a mine,
 although he suffered from cancer and was injured while on duty, the salesman
 who worked for more than 20 years in supply and marketing but remained honest
 and upright, the forest guard who protected trees for his collective, the
 fine cadre who wholeheartedly served the'people and so on.  In 1981, of the
 1,027 model workers of the municipality, 818 were party members, 79.6 per-
 cent of the total.  As Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out:  "All the splendid
 successes of the party and the people have been achieved precisely through
 the inspiring example given by such fine core members of the party."  This
 is the main trend among the broad masses of party members.  Meanwhile, we
 must be clear about the fact that due to the remaining consequences of the:
 sabotage caused by the decade of internal disorder and the increasing
 invasion of bourgeois ideology under the new conditions, there still exist
 the problems'of impure ideology and style among some of our party members;
 there also exists the phenomenon of decadence, which we must be fully alert
 to.  Some party members resist the line, principles and policies formulated
 by the party since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,
 are doubtful and hesitant about communism; even up to now, some still stick
 to the ideological system of Lin Biao and the "gang of four" and resent the
 party; some party members are imbued with bureaucratism and irresponsible
 in their work or seek for personal privileges by making use of their
 authority to pursue private interests; some party members practice anarchism
 and ultra-individualism, and impair the party's organizational discipline,
 some have carried the decadent and vulgar stuff of the bourgeoisie into the
 party, as if nothing can be done without inviting people for dinner.  They
 pursue a bourgeois lifestyle and some even engage in smuggling, offering and
 accepting bribes and engaging in corruption.  Although these people were
 only a few in number, they have seriously corroded the body of the party,
 impaired the prestige of the party among the masses of people and to an
 extent affected the people's confidence in the cause of socialism.  We must
 also be aware that nearly 40 percent of the party members of the whole
 municipality were admitted to the party, during the "Great Cultural Revolu-
 tion."- Among them, many still lack training in the party's program and the
 basic knowledge of the party.  They do not understand, or do not fully
 understand, how to be a qualified Communist Party member.  Some party mem-
 bers even say:  "Why is it that we party members and not the masses must
 take the lead in our work?"  Some were even admitted to or drafted into the
 party at the "battlefront" of rebellion and up to the present still fail to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100420001-1
 conform to the requirements of a party member.  There also exist various
 problems among veteran party members.  So, without consolidating the party,
 it will be impossible to fundamentally change the above state of affairs.
 We must be aware that due to a variety of domestic and international con-
 ditions, the struggle between capitalist corrosion and socialist anti-
 corrosion will exist for a long time in our country and sometimes even be
 acute.  At present, we have already exposed many shocking facts.  Some
 party members who were not firm enough have been attacked by and succumbed
 to the material or spiritual "sugar-coated bullets" of capitalism; some
 others have to a certain extent been corroded by bourgeois ideas and
 invaded by the trend of bourgeois liberalism.  Although we have achieved
 good results in carrying out education against this corrosion combined with
 combating serious criminal activities in the economic field, we have still
 not fundamentally solved the problem.  Only through consolidating the party
 and building a steel wall with communist ideology and strict discipline
 resistant to the corrosive influence of capitalist ideology, can the vast
 number of our party organizations become a powerful fighting force and the
 broad masses of party members become firm, sober-minded and worthy vanguard
 fighters of the proletariat.  Under the conditions of the new historical
 period, this is a fundamental measure for maintaining the purity and fight-
 ing effectiveness of the Communist Party, so that it can maintain an
 invincible position.
 Third, it is imperative to consolidate the party well if the Communist Party
 in power intends to always keep its revolutionary spirit young.
 The position of a proletarian revolutionary political party after seizing
 political power is quite different from before.. This change of position
 will inevitably bring about a series of new problems in building the party.
 From the development of the communist movement up to the present, one of
 the major theoretical and practical problems that must be properly solved
 is how to always keep the revolutionary spirit of the Communist Party in
 power and its party members young, how to strive forever for the realiza
 tion of communist ideals, forever keep in close connection with the masses
 of the people and forever work for their well-being.  At present, the
 majority of our party members were admitted to the party after it seized
 power.  They have joined the party in a peaceful environment and it is
 easy for them to be cadres after they have joined the party.  After they
 become cadres, they have power and authority.  If they do not work for com-
 munism and the well-being of the people but become individualist, then they
 are bound to make use of their authority to gain advantages from the state,
 collective and masses, or even form a clique to pursue selfish interests,
 undermine the foundations of socialism, and turn from being the people's
 servant to being a lord over them.  In the light of the experiences of our
 party, in solving this problem, we must carefully admit party members
 strictly according to.the stipulations of the party constitution, strengthen
 education and supervision over them, constantly carry on criticism and self-
 criticism, strictly observe party discipline, work out all kinds of neces-
 sary rules and regulations; we must also conduct large-scale party rectifi-
 cation over a certain period, universally, systematically and profoundly
 carry out education in Marxism, consolidate our organization and, rectify

 our ideology and style, raise the quality and level of all party members and
 expel from the party those members who have morally degenerated and who are
 still not qualified after education, or persuade them to withdraw from the
 party. This is an important strategic measure for'the construction of the
 Communist Party in power.  Today, at a time when the whole party and the
 people of all nationalities of our country are working for the great task
 put forward by the 12th CPC Congress, we have lost no'-time in conducting
 party consolidation.  This will inevitably have far-reaching historical
 significance in creating a new situation in all fields of socialist
 modernization and in the vigorous development of the communist movement
 in the days to come.
 Conditions Are Ripe for Consolidating the Party
 After the smashing of the Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique, consoli-
 dating the party became a historical mission confronting us due to the
 serious damage to our party caused by the 10 years of domestic turmoil.
 Without consolidating the party, the situation in which the party's style
 of work is impure cannot fundamentally change. However, there had to be a
 process between the needs arising from the development of history and the
 actual implementation of party consolidation.  In the wake of the 12th
 party congress, the conditions for consolidating the party became completely
 ripe.
 1.  We have successfully fulfilled the historical mission of setting the
 party's guiding ideology to rights.  The party's line, principles and poli-
 cies followed since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee
 have been proved correct by practice.  The thinking of the whole party has
 been unified on the basis of the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the
 History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC."  The 12th party con-
 gress' report and the new party constitution have further explicitly laid
 down the programs for China's socialist modernization construction and for
 the building of the party and have stipulated more strict requirements for
 party members and the basic guiding principles to be followed by the coming
 movement of consolidating the party.  All this has laid a solid ideological
 foundation for the coming movement.
 2.  Now we have the firm and unified leadership of the party Central Com-
 mittee.  The leadership of party organizations at all levels is now mainly
 controlled by people who support the party's line, principles and policies
 since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.  So long as
 we make.careful and meticulous preparations and conduct proper guidance and
 organization, the consolidation of the party is guaranteed to develop
 steadily and healthily along a correct course.
 3.  The broad masses of party members have a strong desire to consolidate
 the party, and the masses of. the people also cherish great expectations of
 the coming consolidation.
 4.  We have been making preparations for consolidating the party in many
 fields for a long time.  Since the implementation of the "principles on

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100420001-1
 inner party political life," some activities with the purpose of consoli-
 dating the party have been carried out step by step to a profound degree in
 connection with major political study, the implementation of the principles
 and policies laid down by the central authorities and the reorganization of
 softie leading groups.  Taking the work in Beijing as an example, over the
 past year, the Beijing municipal authorities have conducted discussions on
 the. topic of "serving the people and bearing responsibility to the people"
 in connection with the study and implementation of the "principles on inner
 party political life"; they have checked unhealthy tendencies such as
 spending public money on extravagant eating and drinking, and forming
 special ties between units so as to facilitate the private giving and
 accepting of gifts; have inspected education among cadre's children; have
 required leading groups at all levels to review their work of the last year,
 and have universally carried out democratic elections in grassroots party
 branches.  Recently, Beijing also carried out activities opposing the cor-
 ruption of capitalist ideology and strengthening education in communist
 ideology.  All this embodies the spirit of rectifying the work style of the
 party.  The education in consolidating the party has been consciously car-
 ried out in all these activities.  In fact, they were all preparatory
 measures for consolidating the party.  Especially in the recent education
 on the subject of opposing corruption, all party members in Beijing have
 received training in rotation. Among the party cadres at county, district
 and bureau levels, 569 people have given party lectures, accounting for
 over 40 percent of the total number of cadres at this level.  Besides this,
 more than 5,000 leaders of grassroots party committees have given party
 lectures.  A good start has been made on the whole party concentrating on
 party building throughout Beijing.  Though these education activities
 differed in scale and depth, they all provided important ideological,
 organizational experience and public opinion preparations for consolidating
 the party. On the basis. of studying the 12th party congress documents and
 through experiments in some units and the summing. up of experience, these
 activities will be developed into the official consolidation of the party
 in a methodical way.
 We Must Fulfill the Task of Consolidating the Party With High Standards and
 High Quality
 How shall we do a good job in consolidating the party, in accordance with
 the stipulation of the new party constitution and the requirements on con-
 solidating the party set forth in the congress report and in connection with
 the conditions in Beijing?
 First, we must clearly realize the objective and requirements of this move-
 ment of consolidating the party.
 The'new party constitution has set forth more stringent demands on party
 members and has laid down explicit stipulations on enhancing the fighting
 power of party organizations, upholding and improving the party's leader-
 ship.  This should be taken,as a yardstick in consolidating the party.  In
 line with this yardstick, we will carry out an overall rectification of the
 work style and organizations of the party and turn party members into ones

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 who are qualified and conform to the requirements of the new party consti-
 tution.  At the same time, we will effectively improve the state of affairs
 in party organizations at all levels so as to turn grassroots party organi-
 zations into staunch fighting bastions which conform to the requirements of
 maintaining good relations with the masses laid down in the new party
 constitution and turn leading groups at all levels into cores of leader-
 ship in conformity with the requirements of the new party constitution.
 Since the coming consolidation of the party will be an overall rectifica-
 tion, according to the stipulations of the new party constitution, its main
 specific requirements in all aspects should be as follows:  In the field of
 ideology, party members and cadres should be required to bear in mind that
 the objective of struggle is communism and that the principle is to serve
 the people wholeheartedly.  They will be required to eliminate the bureau-
 cratic style of work and mentality of enjoying privileges which can easily
 appear among party members and particularly party cadres.  The shameful
 conduct of abusing powers to seek private interests and encroaching upon
 the interests of the state, the collectives and the masses for private
 benefits as well as the unhealthy tendencies of violating the people's
 interests and divorcing oneself from the masses should all be criticized
 and overcome.  Party members and cadres will be required to form a com-
 munist. attitude toward work, a revolutionary spirit of selflessness and
 to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of being ambitious and willing
 to do pioneering work, making innovation, and being dedicated.  They should
 be willing to sacrifice all their personal benefits and struggle for com-
 munism all their lives.  In the field of politics, party members and cadres
 are required to maintain a political stand in line with that of the party
 central leadership, to uphold the four basic principles, to correctly
 implement the party's line, principles and policies since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and to struggle for  the great
 tasks set forth by the 12th party congress.  The problem that some party
 members and organizations refuse to implement instructions issued by the
 central authorities and take a dissenting attitude toward the party for
 feigning compliance while acting in opposition should be solved.  In the
 field of organization, party organizations at all levels will be consoli-
 dated and perfected.  Party members and cadres will be required to uphold
 the principle of democratic centralism.  The party's collective leadership
 will be strengthened.  The practice that one person decides everything, and
 that of decentralism, will be opposed.  The spirit of uniting people from
 all corners of the country will be carried forward so as to strengthen
 party'unity and oppose the sectarianism within the party.  Party discipline
 must be strictly enforced by strengthening the attitude of bearing in mind
 the party's interests.  Extreme individualism, anarchism and all kinds of
 illegal behavior will be criticized and eliminated.  It is absolutely
 impermissible to maintain the following people in the leading posts:  those
 who gained their powers through rebellion; those who harbor a seriously
 sectarian attitude; those who have participated in beating, smashing and
 looting; those who oppose the line taken by the party central leadership
 since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee; and those
 who have committed various serious criminal activities.  These people will
 be dealt with one after another once they. are discovered still to occupy

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 leading posts.  In the field of work style, party members and cadres will be
 required-to restore and carry forward the party's good tradition and the
 three major styles of work namely, combining theory with practice, maintain-
 ing close ties with the masses and carrying out criticism and self-criticism.
 the dirt of subjectivism and bureaucratism as well as the bad style of
 casting aside principles, concealing faults and glossing over wrongs,
 boasting and toadying and fearing to offend other people should all be
 eliminated.  At the end of this movement, when party members are asked to
 register, we, must strictly follow the new party constitution's stipulations
 and expel those members who fail to meet the requirements even after educa-
 tion, or persuade them to withdraw from the party.
 Second, the work of consolidating the party must constantly uphold the
 correct guiding principles.
 In the history of our party, there exist rich experiences in both positive
 and negative aspects.  We should carry forward the spirit of the Yanan
 rectification movement and adhere to the principles of "learning from past
 mistakes,to avoid future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient"
 and "achieving the two-fold objective of clarity in ideology and unity
 among comrades."  When approaching party members who have committed errors,
 we should, starting from the desire for unity, through serious criticism
 and self-criticism and by adopting suitable ways to listen to the opinions
 of the masses outside the party, help them genuinely realize and correct
 their mistakes so as to achieve unity on a new basis.  We must prevent and
 oppose the erroneous principle and method of "cruel struggle and merciless
 blows" which have in the past been used by the party.  Furthermore, we must
 prevent evil persons from taking advantage of this opportunity to frame up
 and attack good comrades.  At the same time, we should also prevent per-
 functory attitudes which makes the movement a sham.
 Third, the work of consolidating the party must be brought under the leader-
 ship of the party central authorities, must be treated very prudently, be
 prepared in a very meticulous way and be carried out in a planned and
 methodical manner.
 According to conditions in Beijing city, our initial plan is first to
 organize party members and cadres to seriously study the 12th party con-
 gress report and the new party constitution and then go in for consolida-
 tion in the fields of ideology and organization on the basis of general
 education.  We will start work in some selected units to gain experience
 this winter and next spring.  The overall movement will start in the second
 half of next year by stages and groups in a planned and methodical manner
 under leadership from top to bottom.  The consolidation of the party will
 be linked with the administrative structural reform and reorganization of
 enterprises and institutions.
 Carrying out ideological education for party members in a universal,
 systematical and thorough way is the essential measure for doing a good job
 of consolidating the party.  When studying the 12th congress report and
 the new party constitution, we should simultaneously study the "Resolution
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the
 PRC" and the "principles on inner party political life."  We must particu-
 larly emphasize education in communist ideology for party members and
 basic' theoretical education in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  We
 should educate them in communist ideals and in the party's line, principles
 and policies.  We should also educate them in the basic knowledge of the
 party, in the requirements for party members, party spirit, style of work
 and discipline.  We should place stress on making all party members clearly
 realize the party's character, position and function and be aware that only
 the people who are willing to struggle for communism throughout their lives
 and to sacrifice their all for the revolution can be qualified members of
 the CPC so that they can consciously compare themselves to the requirements
 of the new party constitution for party members and find out their defi-
 ciencies.  At the same time, we should be good at educating party members
 with both positive and negative lessons so as to arouse their revolutionary
 enthusiasm and make them profoundly realize the necessity of consolidating
 the party, and determine to dedicate their all to the party, the people and
 the communist cause.  This method has been adopted in some Beijing units
 when carrying out the recent education in opposing corruption.  This lively
 and concrete method has achieved marked results and should be carried
 forward on a larger scale.  Historical experience shows that only by hold-
 ing up a clear-cut communist banner and unswervingly implementing the
 party's current policies in a down-to-earth manner, can we gather the vast
 number of'party members and progressives outside the party to carry out
 arduous struggles under the communist banner and to unite the whole nation
 to win victories in revolution and construction.  When smelting steel we
 need to keep the furnace burning, and only when the communist enthusiasm
 of the vast number of party members is fully aroused can all kinds of non-
 proletarian ideological dregs be washed out of the minds of party members.'
 Only thus can we achieve success in consolidating the party.
 The experimental work of consolidating the party in a few selected units is
 a preparatory step for smoothly carrying out the movement in an all-round
 way.  Though we have accumulated rich experiences in carrying out the
 movement of consolidating the party, the current conditions are very dif-
 ferent from those in the past and the situation inside the party has also
 changed.  Apart from this, many party members and cadres at middle and
 grassroots levels do not have practical experience in this field due to
 the fact that we have not consolidated the party.for many years.  There-
 fore, the experimental work in selected units is very important.                       We can
 gain experience there and use it to guide general work.  This winter and
 next spring the Beijing municipal authorities will select a number of units
 in organs subordinate to the municipal party committee, industrial, capital
 construction and financial departments and in both rural and urban areas as
 the experiment points for consolidating the party.  The relevant depart-
 ments of the municipal party committee and party committees (or party
 groups) at district, county and bureau levels will send leading cadres to
 take part in the experimental work and will pay attention to study the
 experience and problems in consolidating the party so as to make prepara-
 tions for the work of all-round consolidation.

 Carrying out the work of consolidating the party by stages and in groups in
 a planned and methodical way under a unified leadership is an important
 guarantee for the healthy development of the work of consolidating the party.
 This work should be started in the municipal party committee and then
 gradually develop to leading groups at district, county and bureau level.
 After this, the consolidation of grassroots party organizations can be
 carried out by stages and in groups.  In this way, the movement will develop
 from top to bottom at one level after another under the leadership of the
 upper party organizations.  As for those party organizations which have
 been paralyzed or corrupted,, their senior organizations should send work
 teams there to bring the party work directly under control.
 Furthermore, the work of consolidating the party should be linked with
 administrative structural reform and the reorganization of enterprises and
 institutions.  A unified arrangement should be worked out.  In the course
 of consolidating the party, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the
 building of leading groups at all levels.  It is necessary, by upholding
 the principle of appointing people on their merits and giving priority to
 their political integrity, to promote those young and middle-aged cadres,
 who have'comparatively high education level, strong professional ability
 and organization and leadership capabilities and who can open up new
 prospects in work, to leading positions in place of those incompetent
 cadres who cannot do so.  Reformative measures should be taken as the work
 of consolidating the party is carried on.  Concrete measures for strength-
 ening and improving the party leadership should be worked out so as to
 consolidate and develop the achievements of the movement.  It is necessary
 to lead the revolutionary enthusiasm of party members emerging after the
 work of consolidating the party into their professional work and production
 so as to promote work and production and to create a new situation in which
 the'work in all fields is going full steam ahead.
 Our era has sounded the clarion call to create a new situation in all fields
 of socialist modernization.  We must, in the course of studying, publicizing
 and implementing the 12th party congress' documents, do a good job of con-
 solidating the party and build all party organizations in Beijing city into
 vigorous fighting command posts able to create new situations, which will
 unite and lead the people throughout the city, under the leadership of the
 party Central Committee and in accordance with the four-point instructions
 on the building of the capital issued by the party Central Secretariat, to
 build Beijing into a modern capital of our socialist country with a high
 degree of civilization and democracy, and to continuously advance our work
 in all fields in concentrated, enthusiastic and orderly manner.

 COMMENTS ON DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING PLANNED ECONOMY AND MARKET REGULATION
 MECHANISM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 20-22
 [Article by Jing Ping [2529 1627]; preface by the editor of the RED FLAG
 Publishing House to the book "Collections of Theoretical Essays on Planned
 Economy and the Market Regulation Mechanism"; which collects articles on
 this topic published in major newspapers and magazines from the publication
 of the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since
 the Founding of the PRC" to June 1982]
 [Text]  The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party
 Since the Founding of the PRC" adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee points out:  ."It is necessary to practice plan-
 ned economy on the basis of public ownership and at the same time, give
 play to the supplementary role of regulation by market mechanism."  Both
 the historical experience and current situation of China's socialist
 economic construction have shown us the fact that whether the national
 economy can healthily develop and whether the socialist economic system
 can be further consolidated depend on whether this basic principle is put
 into effect in an all-round way.
 Since the publication of the resolution, theoretical and actual workers in
 the economic field have widely discussed the problem concerning planned
 economy and the market regulation mechanism and have published many articles
 on this topic.  Over the past year, the people's understanding of this prob-
 lem has.been raised to a new level and the discussions have achieved useful
 results.
 As we know, when discussing the reform of China's economic institutions a
 few years ago, people generally felt that there existed many maladies in
 our economic institutions, such as the overcentralization of power, rigidly
 planned management which covered too wide a range and'exerted too.rigid a
 control, the lack of decisionmaking powers in enterprises and the neglect
 of the function of the market mechanism..  Undoubtedly, it is correct to
 point out these maladies and seek ways to solve these problems and this has
 played an active role in promoting the reform of our economic institutions.
 At the same time, there being no need for reticence, some improper and even
 erroneous viewpoints have also come up in the discussions.  For a certain

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 period, many comrades did not take seriously the state of affairs.  In the
 wake of the publication of the resolution, Comrade Chen Yun repeatedly
 emphasized that it is necessary to adhere to the principle of "giving the
 leading role to planned economy and the supplementary role to the market
 regulation mechanism."  Since then, a new situation has been brought about.
 In the articles published in the past year, many comrades on the one hand
 fully.affirmed the great achievements of the theoretical discussions con-
 cerning the reform of our economic institutions and on the other hand,
 seriously analyzed the problems existing in the discussions a few years
 ago.  Apart from inappropriate wording and inaccurate propositions, which
 were problems that were hard to avoid and should not be taken seriously,
 they mainly pointed out the following erroneous viewpoints:  Considering
 that the law of planned development of the national economy does not exist
 under the socialist system; considering that our country at present is not
 provided with the material conditions for practicing. a planned economy;
 considering that inefficient management and poor economic results are
 inevitable outcomes of the planned economy; considering that mandatory
 plans should be abolished and that state plans should only be treated as
 references and should not have a binding force; considering that planning
 regulation mechanism is only suited to the management of macroeconomy while
 microeconomy, that is, the activities of enterprises, should be subject to
 the market regulation mechanism; considering that all enterprises, includ.-
 -ing those owned by all the people, should be economic entities which are
 completely independent and are provided with all the characteristics and
 rights of commodity producers and should thus have the power to inde-
 pendently'handle production, exchange and other economic activities; con-
 sidering that only by relying on the law of value, can production and
 other economic activities be properly regulated; and considering that
 market economy is much superior to planned economy.  Among these view-
 points, some were only the ideas of a few individuals, but others were
 supported by a number of comrades.  Seriously and objectively pointing out
 these' viewpoints which negate and are detrimental or may at least lead to
 the weakening of our socialist planned economy and then analyzing and
 criticizing them, rather than remaining indifferent toward them, represents
 an earnest and scientific attitude.  This shows that our economic theoreti-
 cal workers have made progress and improvement in their understanding.  This
 is a good thing.  Launching discussions around these substantial issues of
 principle will never hinder the scientific study of theories but instead,
 it will only promote this study.   This will not impede the reform of the
 economic institutions, rather, it will benefit the healthy development of
 this reform.
 In the articles published in the past year, many comrades started from the
 actual conditions of our country, applied the basic principles of Marxism
 to the socialist economy to sum up positive and negative experiences in
 China's economic construction.  They made some concrete expositions on the
 important issue of "giving the leading role to planned economy and the
 supplementary role to market regulation mechanism" and further explicitly
 affirmed the following viewpoints:             .

 1.  The national economy developing in a planned way is a basic charac-
 teristic of the socialist economy.  Only by practicing planned economy
 on the basis of public ownership, can we guarantee the proportionate and
 coordinated development of various branches of the national economy and
 Various links of social reproduction and guarantee the growth of production
 in conformity with the interests of the whole society.  In this way, the
 practicing of planned economy embodies the requirement of the socialist
 basic economic law.  Abandoning planned economy will inevitably lead to
 anarchy in social production and to the destruction of the socialist public
 ownership system.
 2.  Our country has been provided with the conditions for practicing plan-
 ned economy.  The superiority of planned economy has been proved in the
 past 30 years' practice of economic construction.  It is true that maladies
 existed in the specific systems of planned management in China and many
 major mistakes did occur in our planning work, but all this can be improved
 and corrected.  We should never suspect and negate the basic system of
 planned economy for these reasons.
 3.  Practicing mandatory plans is a basic sign of the socialist planned
 economy and is also an important embodiment of China's socialist system of
 ownership by all the people.  If mandatory plans, the state's direct
 management of the production and distribution of the means of production
 and consumption with a bearing on the national economy and the people's
 livelihood and the state's direct command over backbone enterprises were to
 be completely abolished, our plans would, like plans in capitalist coun-
 tries, only play a coordinating role in the enterprises' productive and
 economic activities.  In this case, it would be hard for the state to
 control necessary economic strength to guarantee the national economy
 developing in accordance with the interests and demands of the entire
 society.  This would inevitably lead to confusion in the social economic
 life and would not guarantee. the advance of our economy as a whole along
 the socialist course.
 4.  As for the forms of planned management, apart from direct plans, or
 mandatory plans, many products and enterprises may and should be subject
 to indirect plans, or guidance plans, which mainly rely on prices, taxes,
 credits and other economic levers to guide enterprises to the fulfillment
 of state plans.  The attempt- to exclusively practice mandatory plans with-
 out regard to actual conditions and necessity is also unfavorable to the
 proportionate development of the economy. and unfavorable to the improvement
 of economic results.
 5.  Under the conditions of the planned economy playing a dominant role,
 it is also necessary to define a certain scope in accordance with the
 specific situation of various periods and allow enterprises to conduct free
 production and exchange within this scope, that is, to allow the production
 and exchange of a section of products to be regulated spontaneously accord-
 ing to the law of value.  In this way, this market regulation mechanism is
 subordinate to the planned economy and just plays a secondary role, but it
 is essential and serves as a useful supplement to the planned economy.  When

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 emphasizing the importance of the planned economy, we should not neglect the
 supplementary role of market regulation mechanism.
 6.  In order to properly organize the socialist economy, it is necessary to
 thake.all efforts to follow objective economic laws and first of all, the
 specific laws of the socialist economy, such as the socialist basic
 economic law and the law of proportionate development.  At the same time,
 it is necessary to follow the basic law governing commodity production,
 that is, the law of value.  When practicing both mandatory plans and
 guidance plans, we must take into account the situation of market supply
 and demand and the requirements of the law of value.  It is wrong to deny
 that the socialist basic economic law and the law of planned development
 are the principal regulators in social production and to exaggerate the
 regulatory role of the law of value.  It is also wrong to deny the regula-
 tory role of the law of value and to think that emphasizing the planned
 economy means negating the necessity of developing commodity production and
 exchange.
 7.  We must reform China's economic planning institutions.  The basic prin-
 ciple and orientation of this reform must be:  1) socialist in character;
 and 2) Chinese in style.  The result of the reform must be to strengthen
 and consolidate rather than destroy the socialist economy.  Measures
 adopted in some capitalist countries, including some effective measures in
 those. countries, are not certainly applicable in our country.  We should
 not mechanically copy even the measures of other socialist countries
 because our conditions are different from theirs.  We must seriously sum
 up our own experience and only take foreign experience and ideas as ref-
 erences, rather than foundations.
 8.  The central problem of institutional economic reform is the imple-
 menting of the principle of giving the leading role to the planned economy
 and the supplementary role to the market regulation mechanism.  It is
 necessary to correctly define the scope and limits of mandatory plans,
 guidance plans and market regulation mechanism.  Different degrees of
 decisionmaking power should be vested in different types of enterprises
 so that their business results can be linked with their material benefits,
 and responsibility, power and interests can be combined together.  Both
 administrative means,and economic levers should be put into practice.  This
 reform involves a wide range and should not be treated as some nonessential
 amelioration.  Many problems in this reform need to be solved and we must
 not take this as an easy ;thing.  We must take an active attitude, work out
 feasible programs and put the reform measures into effect step by step.
 9.  We must improve our planning work and place our plans on a better
 scientific base.  We should always maintain our guiding ideology and prin-
 ciples in the economic field in conformity with objective reality and try
 our best to maintain the overall balance in the national economy.  We should
 properly arrange various major ratios in the economy and take into account
 the interests of the three aspects, namely, the state, the collective and
 the individual.   We need to draw up a plan system which combines long-term
 plans with short-term plans and to set up a rational system of indicators.

 It is necessary to strengthen economic forecast and statistical work and
 adopt a scientific method for planning.  The application of prices, taxes,
 credits and other economic levers should be included in state plans and
 taken as an important component of the plans.  Only by continuously
 improving the level of our planning work and making our plans more scien-
 tific, can we firmly consolidate the authoritativeness of our plans.
 10.  We must protect the solemnity of the state unified plans and oppose
 various behaviors of weakening and shaking off the state planned management.
 Localities, departments and enterprises should have the notion of taking
 the interests of the whole nation into account.  Selfish departmentalism,
 decentralism and the liberalist tendency must not be allowed to go unchecked.
 The state should use both administrative and economic means and perfect
 economic legislation and carry out inspection and supervision so as to
 guarantee economic activities being handled in accordance with state plans.
 Over the past year, the discussions concerning planned economy and market
 regulation mechanism have achieved useful results.  Of course, not all
 questions have received unanimous replies.  On the implications of some
 concepts, on the expression and exposition of some viewpoints and even on
 some essential problems, writers still have different opinions.  These
 differences of opinion remain to be solved in the future discussions.  As
 for how to turn the principle of giving the leading role to the planned
 economy and the supplementary role to market regulation mechanism into
 concrete measures and how to set up a concrete system in accordance with
 this principle, it requires us to make a great deal of investigation and
 study of China's reality and carry out thorough theoretical discussion.
 In order to facilitate economic theoretical and practical workers and other
 cadres and masses to acquainting themselves with and studying the issue of
 planned economy and market mechanism, we compile this collection of
 theoretical essays.  This book collects some articles published in major
 newspapers and magazines during the year from the publication of the
 resolution on the party's historical questions to June 1982.  These
 articles are arranged in the sequence of their publishing time.  In addi-
 tion, the book also includes a few articles which have not been published
 before.  The editor has revised the topic.of a few articles.  An index of
 the articles on planned economy and market regulation mechanism is attached
 at the back of this book.  This is the first collection.  A follow-up will
 be compiled and published according to the progress of the discussions.  We
 hope writers and readers will offer help to our editorial work.

 SAFEGUARD THE SOCIALIST PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF LAND
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 23-26, 32
 [Article by Yi Zhi [2496 0037]]
 [Text]  On the ownership of land in China, the draft of the revised con-
 stitution of the PRC clearly defined:  "Land in the cities is the property
 of the state."  "Land in villages, towns and the suburban areas is the
 property of the collectives, except for the portion which belongs to the
 state according to provisions of the law; house sites and private plots of
 cropland and hilly land are also owned by collectives."  "The state may
 in the public interest take over land for its use in accordance with the
 law."  "No organization or individual may appropriate, buy, sell or lease
 land, or unlawfully transfer land in other ways."  This has affirmed that
 the present stage of China accords with the public ownership of the means
 of production and there exist two kinds of socialist ownership of land;
 further, it has confirmed the principle that the land owned by the state
 and the collective is inviolable and cannot be regarded as a commodity to
 be sold, bought or leased.  These principles affirmed by the fundamental
 law of the state which has supreme legal effect have great immediate
 significance in safeguarding the socialist economic basis of our country
 and promoting the management of land.
 Land is the basic means of production for industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction, and cannot be substituted.  It is closely linked with the people's
 life and the existence and reproduction of mankind.  Socialism is incom-
 patible with the private ownership of land.  In their:"Manifesto of the
 Communist Party," Marx and Engels pointed out:  "Wielding its political
 domination, the proletariat" "expropriates landed property and provides
 land rent to the state for its expenditures."  ("Collected Works of Marx
 and Engels," Vol 4, pp 489, 490)  In "places where there are large number
 of peasants who own the land," Marx proposed to "promote the transition
 from private ownership to collective ownership of land."  ("Collected Works
 of Marx and Engels," Vol 18, pp 694, 695)  After the victory of the demo-
 cratic revolution, China abolished the feudal ownership of land in rural
 areas and carried out the principle that those who till own their land.
 The collective ownership of land in rural areas was gradually established

 during the cooperative transformation of agriculture and finally realized
 with the establishment of the advanced agricultural producers' cooperative;
 whereas the state ownership of land was gradually set up and strengthened
 through expropriation, confiscation, taking over (of unowned land in town
 and country), redemption (of capitalist estates), requisition and other
 methods.  The establishment of the two kinds of public ownership of land
 eliminated an important source of exploitation and oppression that the
 Chinese people had suffered from, cleared away the obstacles and paved the
 way for China to become a prosperous, strong and modernized country.  These
 are the great achievements gained by the Chinese people in the struggle to
 solve the land problem in the past decades under the leadership of the CPC.
 The establishment of the two kinds of socialist public ownership of land
 was widely supported and respected by various organs, organizations, state-
 owned enterprises and institutions, collective economic organizations and
 the vast numbers of civilians in cities and villages.  On the whole, it
 was relatively stable.  But in recent years this system has been encroached
 upon to varying degrees.  In rural areas, it has been mainly a case of some
 cadres and commune members building their own houses and willfully occupy-
 ing cultivated land belonging to the collective; in city suburbs, it has
 mainly been some production teams, organs and enterprises illegally buying,
 selling or leasing land; and in cities,.-there have also been serious cases
 of illegal land grabbing.  The practices of violating rules and occupying
 land are also rather serious.  Some units and individuals try every possible
 way to occupy open spaces, green plots, parks, public roads and residential
 courtyards.  Land under construction is also forcibly occupied.  What
 merits special attention is that when some units owned by the whole people
 apply for land for the purpose of construction, they budget liberally but
 spend sparingly.  After they have got the land which the state paid a high
 price for in taking over, if they do not or cannot use it, they exchange it
 for houses or materials, or sell, lease or transfer it at a high price.  If
 we allow all the above practices of violating state or collective ownership
 of land to spread unchecked, the socialist economic basis of our country
 will be seriously impaired and a great deal of valuable land will continue
 to be ruined and wasted; this will lead to consequences dreadful to con-
 template.
 Although land is a means of production, it is somewhat different from that
 of machinery equipment, factory buildings, raw materials, fuel and other
 means of production.   It cannot be reproduced.   One mu occupied will be
 1 mu less.  Moreover, its position is fixed and cannot be moved.  China has
 a large population with limited land and the distribution of our population
 is seriously uneven.   At present, in many cities and rural areas, there
 have been a shortage in usable land.  Along with the increase of population
 and the' development of the construction cause, this situation of shortage
 will be more and more intensified.  Therefore, to cherish every inch of
 land is our existing national policy and- also the bounden responsibility
 of all organs, organizations, enterprises and institutions, economic organi-
 zations of the collectives and the residents of cities and villages.  It is
 stipulated in the draft of the revised constitution of the PRC that "social-
 ist public property is sacred and inviolable."  The land owned by the state

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 and the collective is sacred and inviolable.  The establishment of socialist
 public ownership of land offered the possibility for the rational exploita-
 tion and utilization of land in a planned way.  But by applying this possi-
 bility to reality, we still need to rely on the people of the whole country
 and particularly all cadres to safeguard the socialist public ownership of
 land.  Recently, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and the State
 Council emphasized:  In the past few years, the situation in rural areas of
 occupation of cultivated land and building of houses was quite serious, and
 in addition, more land is found to be occupied by the state every year for
 its construction.  This further accelerates the contradiction of the large
 population and limited land of our country becoming more striking.  If we
 do not attach great importance to this situation and take drastic measures
 to stop it, it is bound to have serious consequences.  Therefore, it is
 demanded to strictly control the occupation of land and building of houses,
 and resolutely check the trend of cadres taking the lead in grabbing land
 and building houses.  This instruction is very important.
 In order to safeguard the socialist public ownership of land, we must
 further perfect the land legislation, study and improve the system of land
 management and make clear the problem of ideological understanding con-
 cerning the public ownership of land.
 One of the important reasons why our socialist public land has frequently
 been violated in the past was that our country's land laws were not com-
 plete and there were no legal guidelines when problems concerning land
 management occurred.  For instance, since the cooperative transformation
 of agriculture, although the-party and government time and again reaffirmed
 in its policy documents that buying, selling and leasing of land were for-
 bidden, people nevertheless bought, sold and leased the land, and there
 were no clear-cut laws statipg what responsibility the culprits should bear.
 Consequently, even if the cases of selling, buying and leasing of land were
 investigated, those guilty were not duly punished.  A culprit who offended
 the law "made self-criticism for a short spell but got benefits throughout
 his life."  This then created a precedent for future illegal activities.
 Here is another example:  We criticized the rural grassroot level cadres
 for arbitrarily distributing house sites.  But for a long time we did not
 suggest any way to properly distribute the house sites, with the result that
 each locality chose their own way.  Some even competed with others, keeping
 pace with a "high standard."
 Socialist land law is a powerful weapon for us to protect the socialist
 public ownership of land.  It is inconceivable for such a big country as
 ours with a large population and limited land not to have complete land
 laws.
 It is gratifying that in the past 12 months or so, the State Council has
 successively promulgated several important land decrees.  A number of
 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have'also formulated their
 own local land regulations.  There has been great progress in the land

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 legislation work of our country.  But we still do not have our own land law.
 There are some details of the newly promulgated land decree that need to be
 formulated and put in force.  We must continue to firmly grasp the work in
 land legislation.  The clear and perfect stipulation laid down in the new
 constitution for the ownership of land for our country at the present stage
 will establish a prerequisite for the land law of China.
 To make a law is not easy but, in a certain sense, to carry it out is even
 more difficult.  A special feature of many cases of illegal land dealings
 is that both parties received benefits at the expense of the state.  There-
 fore, these cases are not easily discovered in advance.  When it is investi-
 gated, it has already become a fact.  There are also great obstacles and
 difficulties in dealing with these cases.  Moreover, there are the phenomena
 of too many opinions and, ambiguous responsibility in land management at
 present which meant that land appeared to be managed but in fact was not;
 this seriously hindered the development of land management work.  Urban land
 should of course be managed by the real estate departments.  But too many
 heads involved in the management cause it to be in a confused state.
 Therefore, after we have laid down a series of land decrees, it is neces-
 sary to further perfect the administrative organs of land management and
 earnestly grasp the work of enforcing the law.  It is imperative to have
 a full understanding of the difficulty of enforcing the law.  We must
 educate the comrades of judicial and land-management departments to bear
 the spirit of responsibility to the state and our later generations, act
 according to the law and enforce it strictly.
 One of the main defects in the economic management system of our country is
 the idea of eating out of the "big communal pot."  This is also true in our
 land management system, and in the management system in the state-owned
 land in particular.
 At present, when land is needed by enterprises and institution units owned
 by the whole people, provided that the construction or extension project
 is approved, the construction unit can in the name of a state representa-
 tive take over land for its use, no matter how high the expenses, because
 they are allocated, paid and reimbursed by the state.  After the land is
 taken over, it is owned by the state and used by the construction unit.
 Prior to the "Great Cultural' Revolution," the units owned by the whole
 people had to pay to the state a small fee for the use of land.  During
 the "Cultural Revolution," this symbolic payment was also revoked.  Now,
 the units of the ownership of the whole people gratuitously use state land.
 Although this kind of system conforms with the simplified tax system, it
 has also brought a lot of problems.  Among them the most typical one is
 gratuitous use of land.  Everybody rushes in sharing from the "big pot" of
 state land, thus causing a shocking waste in the use of land.  In requisi-
 tioning land, we often find cases of requisitioning more land than needed,
 or requisitioning it much earlier than it is used, or even not using it at
 all.  The crux of the matter is that land owned by the state is free.  At
 present, the reason why the capitalists of foreign countries rush day and

 night and seize every minute to build factories is that every inch of land
 is extremely expensive there.  The capitalists wish to finish it as quick
 as possible in order to recover the cost of purchasing the land at an
 early date.  But in our metropolis, when houses are demolished, it is
 usually the case that after several years they are still in ruins.  There
 is no choice but to erect an advertisement board to cover up the sight.
 If land is not used gratuitously, but must be paid for, and if whoever
 takes. over the land and does.not use it, will be levied heavy taxes by the
 state, or the land be taken back in due time, then the situation may be far
 better than the present.
 In socialist society there still exists differential land rent.  The land
 rent of construction sites is mainly determined by the position of the land.
 Whether or not the enterprises are situated near the sources of raw mate-
 rials, markets and water and electric supply centers, and whether or not
 the communication and transportation and coordinative conditions are con-
 venient, have great influence on the operation of their businesses.  It is
 not because of good operation of business or large amount of labor put in
 that some of the enterprises'make a good income, but mainly because they
 benefit by the position of the factory (or shop; the mines benefit from rich
 resources).  At present, wherever the land used by the state-owned enter-
 prises is situated, it is free; therefore, the differential land rent is
 then distributed to enterprises that are situated in a good location.  This
 not only causes uneven income, advantages and hardships, it also encourages
 people to crowd into the metropolis and particularly to seize the land in
 the center of the city and the vegetable plots in the suburbs.
 In the past, when the management system of the entire planning, finance,
 supply and marketing and others were all sharing from the "communal pot,"
 the above defects of free use of land did not arouse the attention of the
 people.  Now, the initiative power of enterprises have been extended and we
 have instituted the economic responsibility system.  When the other fields
 began to actively solve the problem of "communal pot," the problem of
 "communal pot" in the state-owned land became more conspicuous and its
 defects exposed more clearly.  This is an important problem that calls for
 a solution in reforming the land management system.
 In order to make the construction units use land more economically and change
 the free occupation of state-owned land to a paid one, it is absolutely
 necessary for the state to levy land-use tax on private house sites and
 land used by units for construction purpose, according to the quality and
 quantity of land.  The state must pay relevant fees for requisitioning,
 exploiting and managing land.  At present, the expenses in requisitioning
 land constitute a large amount of every capital construction investment
 allocated by the state.  This sum of money is not part of the social
 reproduction process and does not form fixed assets.  It cannot be grad-
 ually withdrawn, depreciated or recouped, and is not included in the rent;
 therefore the state is not reasonably compensated.  It is necessary to levy
 a certain amount of tax on the units that use land to'compensate the expenses
 used in requisitioning, exploiting and managing land.

 It seems that the state charging the state-run enterprises for using land
 is like collecting a sum of money from one side but reducing the profits
 that should be turned over on the other; the wool comes from the sheep's
 back. In fact, collecting and not collecting are quite different, and the
 results of the wool coming from this or that sheep's back are also quite
 different.  Collecting is advantageous for maintaining the state ownership
 of land and prevents the reduction of state ownership of land to unit
 ownership.  Under the condition of extending the initiative power of enter-
 prises and the enterprises having relatively independent economic rights
 and interests, it is a very beneficial thing for the state to levy tax on
 using land and levying a higher tax on the well located land and suburban
 vegetable plots according to the principle of differential land rent.  This
 reflects a series of policies of the party and government in valuing land,
 readjusting the income of enterprises, controlling the population increase
 in cities, protecting the environment and so on.
 In order to do a good job in land management in rural areas and city
 suburbs and safeguard the socialist collective ownership of land, at
 present, it is necessary to clarify some ideological understanding on the
 problems concerning the collective ownership of land.
 The first problem is forbidding the buying and selling of land.  The con-
 stitution and law of China has a stipulation forbidding the buying and
 selling of land.  It not only forbids the units owned by the whole people
 to sell state-owned land, but also forbids the units owned by the collective
 to sell collectively owned.  This is not a willful stipulation, but a
 scientific one.  Some comrades hold that since land belongs to the collec-
 tive, they have the right to sell.  They do not understand the reasoning
 behind this stipulation.
 The buying and selling of land is an outcome of private ownership of land
 and it is an important reason why in history, land has been monopolized and
 annexed by a handful of people.  In the old society, the rich had fields
 from north to south, but the poor did not even possess a speck of land.
 In addition to the rulers plundering land from the laboring people by means
 of political and military power, this was also caused by the rich buying
 land from the impoverished peasants.  Through the democratic and socialist
 revolutions, China abolished the private ownership of land and nobody was
 allowed to use land to exploit others.  We had the objective conditions for
 forbidding the buying and selling of land.  In order to protect the social-
 ist public ownership of land, the law of our country has a stipulation for-
 bidding the buying and selling of land.  The state recognizes the proprietary
 rights of the collective units over the land and legally protects collec-
 tively owned land from being encroached upon.  Collective units are by no
 means allowed to sell land at will.  If the collective units are allowed to
 sell land at will, it will inevitably mean giving the green light to a few
 people to engage in speculation, and conversely, all bad deeds will come
 one after another.  This is not safeguarding but sabotaging the collective
 ownership of land.

 In socialist society, there exist the production and exchange of commodi-
 ties, but land is not a commodity.  Further, viewed from the development
 of the causes of production and construction, it is not necessary to carry
 out a policy of free buying and selling of land.  If the state needs land
 for capital construction, it can requisition land from the production teams
 through legal procedures after approval by the land management organs.  The
 state does not have to purchase it.  If the commune enterprises need land
 for construction, they can also requisition land from the production teams
 through legal procedures after approval by the state; they do not have to
 purchase it either.  At present, those who intend to purchase land are
 mainly units who want to extend their capital construction which is not
 under the planning of, or approved by, the higher levels.  If the free
 buying and selling of land is allowed, it will be impossible to control the
 planning of cities, capital construction and land utilization.
 The second is the problem of bounds between the public ownership of land
 and the system of production-responsibility, that is, the bounds between
 proprietary rights and utilization rights of land.
 After land reform was carried out in China, the proprietary rights and
 utilization rights of land were always connected together.  After land
 reform,. land was returned to the individual peasants.  The individual
 peasants were the owners and users of land.  After a considerable time
 after the setting up of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives in
 rural areas, the land was cultivated by the collective and therefore, the
 collective was the owner and user of land.  Because the "two rights" were
 combined together for a long period, this caused some of the peasants and
 cadres to be mixed up about the bounds.  After the implementation of the
 responsibility system of fixing output quotas for individual households
 and assigning land to each household in exchange for fixed levies,
 proprietary rights and utilization rights were separated or partly sepa-
 rated.  Therefore, some people misunderstood it as "dividing the fields
 among' individual households" and "land has returned back to its original
 owner."  In the past few years, some.people have built houses and grave-
 yards and used the soil to bake bricks on contract land, private plots and
 fodder fields.  This is related to the mixing up of the bounds between
 proprietary rights and utilization rights of land.  What we have to do is
 to'do more propagation and explanation work, and lead the peasants and
 cadres to draw a clear line of demarcation on this issue.  We must realize
 that in our socialist society, it is normal to separate the proprietary
 right and utilization right of land.  We must help the cadres and commune
 members to draw a clear line of demarcation between proprietary right and'
 utilization right, so that they can understand that they have the right to
 use contract land, private plots, hilly land and fodder fields to a certain
 limited extent, and that they do not have the proprietary right over this
 land.  This is advantageous for maintaining the collective ownership of
 land and also for perfecting the system of production responsibility in
 rural areas.
 Marx predicted 110 years ago that "the ownership of land is the primitive
 source of all wealth.  Now it has become a big problem.  The future of the

 working class depends on how this problem is properly solved."  t"Collected
 Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 18, p 64)  This big problem has basically
 been solved in our country.  The problem we face today is to consolidate
 our achievements and perfect our public ownership of land.  With the
 efforts of all of us, we believe that our socialist public ownership of
 land will constantly be perfect and further definitely manifest its
 superiority.

 LAUNCH THE ADVANCED PRODUCERS MOVEMENT ON A LARGER SCALE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 27-32
 [Article by Yu Yannan [2456 3601 0589]]
 [Text]  The advanced producers movement is a mighty endeavor undertaken by
 the working class and other working people of our country in their estab-
 lishment of socialism and march forward toward the gigantic objective of
 the realization of communism.  This movement is entirely different. from
 past political movements, particularly those so-called "political move-
 ments" during the 10 years of civil disorder.  We use the word "movement"
 here to indicate that it is a popular campaign which is organized, pur-
 poseful and rather prestigious.  And the advanced producers movement is a
 popular production emulation movement which is led by the party and the
 government, lies within the jurisdiction of the law and statutes, possesses
 the definite objectives of establishing material civilization and socialist
 spiritual civilization, both of a high degree of development, and is con-
 scientiously and voluntarily participated in by the working class and other
 laboring people.
 The advanced producers movement is a major part of the workers' movement
 of a new historical era in the establishment of socialism in our country.
 A working class still exists in a socialist era.  Since there is a working
 class in existence, naturally there is a workers' movement.  Following the
 seizure of political power by the working class, it may be said that the
 first step has been taken insofar as the realization of its ultimate
 objective, namely, communism, is concerned.  Hence, the workers' movement
 has not, and cannot, come to a standstill.  But since the tasks and the
 pivotal points of work taken on by the working class before their seizure
 of political power were different from those shouldered by them after the
 seizure, the workers' movement necessarily has suffered vast changes in
 content and form.  Before the birth of new China, the central tasks of our
 working class were, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,
 to form a close alliance with the peasant class and other laboring people,
 to overthrow the rule of imperialism, the landlord class and the bureau-
 cratic. capitalist class, and to liberate the social productive force.

 Hence, during the revolutionary period of new democratism, the basic con-
 tent of our workers' movement was to engage in class struggles to destroy
 corrupt production relations and their upper structures which had impeded
 the development of the social productive force.  In this context, during
 this petiod, the workers' movement resorted to such measures as strikes,
 parades and demonstrations and even engaged in more violent and hostile
 action such as armed struggles.  Following the birth of new China, the
 political ar%d economic status of,the working class suffered a basic change.
 They have become the leadership class of new China and the masters of the
 new society.  Particularly after the basic completion of the socialist
 transformation of the ownership system of the means of production and the
 elimination of the class status of the exploiting class, the central task
 and the pivotal points of work of the working class, generally speaking,
 were to devote their utmost efforts to socialist construction concur-
 rently with raising the social productive force, to reform certain portions
 and links of the production relations and their upper structures which were
 not in conformity with the development of the productive force, in order to
 enable the socialist system to gradually become perfect.  During this new
 historical period, the basic content of the workers' movement was to
 establish a modern, powerful socialist nation which was highly civilized
 and highly democratic.  In other words, the content of the workers' move-
 ment shifted from the past liberation of the social productive force to the
 proper protection and development of the social productive force.  Hence,
 under the new historical conditions, the workers' movement has taken the
 form of being democratic and emulative and not brutal and hostile.
 Some comrades have frequently entertained too narrow a concept of the
 workers' movement.  They seem to believe that the workers' movement
 existed only before the seizure of political power by the working class
 and that the workers' movement could exist only when the workers were
 engaged in struggles with the capitalist class, with or without, the
 shedding of blood.  Such a concept is one-sided, and does not realize that
 the workers' movement necessarily possesses a different content and a dif-
 ferent form in different historical periods.  For the same reason, it does
 not conform to objective reality if we confine the workers' movement merely
 to political struggles and do not take it as embodying the important con-
 tents of the actual practices in production and in the study and renovation
 of science and technology engaged in by the working class during the
 socialist period.  In reality, certain noted political activists of the
 proletarian class long ago took socialist labor emulation in the male and
 female workers' movement as one of the most glorious chapters in the
 history of socialist construction.
 A large-scale development of the advanced producers movement carries an
 enormous significance and role in promoting the establishment of a material
 civilization and socialist spiritual civilization in our country.
 The history of mankind's production development tells us that at any period
 in history and in any production department there existed a small number of

 relatively advanced producers who adopted relatively advanced production
 techniques and created relatively advanced production norms.  Subsequently,
 an increasing number of producers have learned their techniques and measured
 up to their norms until finally what had been originally the production
 level of-the ,small number of advanced producers became the production level
 of'society at large and, as a result, production of the entire society
 increased.  By that time, producers of an even more advanced level began to
 appear.  They adopted techniques of an even more advanced level and created
 norms of an even more advanced character.  They influenced and led many more
 producers to join the ranks of the advanced.  In this way, the snow-balling
 effect gathered momentum.  In general, this may be said to be a picture of
 the development of socialist social production and demonstrates the general
 law governing the development of socialist social production.  In the
 interval, if any big and important invention in production technique is
 made, then it will lead to an important reform in production technique and
 promote a big increase in production.  One of the chief superior points of
 socialism is that it provides various advantageous conditions and opens up
 unlimited extensive prospects for the growth of millions of advanced pro-
 ducers, for the full display of their subjective initiative in production,
 and for the utilization and propagation of their advanced experiences and,
 their various kinds of inventions and creations.  No other social system
 can provide such advantageous conditions.
 As early as at the end of 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong had brought forth a
 proposal to start a socialist emulation campaign in our country.  On the
 basis of this proposal, in March next year the CPC Central Committee issued
 a 'circular entitled:  "Notice Concerning Active Leadership Over the Advanced
 Producers Movement."   Thus,. 17 years before the "Great Cultural Revolution,"
 our country had already started the advanced producers movement.  Although
 in the interval there were certain setbacks Sand errors, generally speaking,
 it had played an important role particularly during the period of the
 recovery of the national economy and the period of the completion of the
 First Five-Year Plan.  After the smashing of the "gang of four," especially
 since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, popular
 activities striving to become various kinds of advanced producers were
 again rampant.  This was a result of the implementation of the policy
 eulogizing advanced people on various frontlines, development of labor
 campaigns in various forms, an upsurge of such activities as technical
 renovation and making rational suggestions, and the "learn from, and
 surpass, the advanced" campaign which had for a time been interrupted dur-
 ing the 10 years of internal disturbance.  According to statistics compiled
 by relevant departments in an investigation of 11 large-size backbone
 enterprises, in recent years roughly 20 percent of their staff members have
 won such meritorious titles of labor as labor model, advanced producer,
 shock worker in the new Long March, 8th March Red Banner pacesetter, and
 contributor of meritorious services to the four modernizations.  Since the
 founding of the PRC, for every thousand staff members, roughly five have
 been awarded, at one time or another, titles of labor models of various
 grades.  At the moment, in various localities, departments and enterprise
 units, the development of the advanced producers movement is still uneven
 and varying results have been attained.  For example, at the end of each

 year, Daqing oil field carried out a campaign to "appraise advanced workers,
 compare contributions, elect models, and exemplify pacesetters."  This has
 played an important role in the development of construction of the oil
 field and in stabilizing its. high yield in recent years.  The Daqing Oil
 Well Drilling Corporation combined labor emulation simultaneously with
 implementing the economic responsibility system.  Last year, its oil well
 drilling footage was more than 600,000 meters, and its entire year's pro-
 duction tasks were filled 28 days ahead of schedule.  Since last year, the
 Shanghai No 5 steel plant has promoted activities to solicit rational
 proposals from its staff members and in this way has enhanced economic
 benefits to the enterprise.  This plant has a steel rolling workshop with
 over 700 workers.  Last year, from July to the end of the year, roughly 10
 percent of its workers made some 116 rational suggestions.  Following
 investigation, 36 of these proposals were accepted.  An investment of
 31,000 yuan was required to carry out these proposals and awards amounting
 to 141 yuan were made.   Implementation of these proposals will yield
 profits of 1.65 million yuan a year.  This is equivalent to 8.7 percent of
 the total profits received yearly from this workshop at present.  Of these
 36 proposals, 19 were carried out before the end of last year.  An invest-
 ment of 5,000 yuan was made but the profits realized that year amounted to
 420,000 yuan.  A team leader in this workshop made a suggestion on "improv-
 ing the productivity rate."  The making of the suggestion, its examination
 and eventual implementation took only 2 days:.  Not a cent was spent; each
 year, 360 more tons of steel can be rolled, increasing profits by 45,000
 yuan.  Innumerable facts have shown that the vigorous development of
 socialist labor emulation to "compare, learn from, catch up, help and
 surpass" can readily be transformed into a powerful popular movement in
 which everybody learns from the advanced and catches up with the advanced.
 It can vigorously arouse people's enthusiasm and urge for improvement,
 change people's spiritual consciousness, promote technical rebuilding in
 the various departments of the national economy, and improve the labor
 productivity rate, work efficiency and economic effect of various trades
 .and industries.  In this way, the prosperous development of socialist
 economic construction in our country can be promoted.
 The central theme of the current large-scale development of the advanced
 producers movement is to greatly increase the labor productivity rate and
 the economic effect to the enterprises.  Development of the movement
 enables the rapid development of social production and in this way can
 provide to society even more plentiful products to satisfy the daily
 increasing material and cultural needs of the people.  This is a special
 characteristic of the socialist system's superiority over capitalism.
 Therefore, vigorous development of the advanced producers movement helps
 in consolidating and developing the socialist system.-
 In the various departments of the national economy, the carrying out of
 widespread, penetrating and sustained labor emulation activities of a
 popular nature and the attraction of an increasing number of employees and
 workers into the movement to learn from and to catch up with the advanced
 not only can produce enormous economic benefits but also possesses an
 inestimable significance and importance in improving the cultural and

 technical quality of the entire working class, in gradually reducing the
 differential between physical labor and mental labor and in nurturing and
 raising the class consciousness and good virtues of the working class,
 particularly the young workers.
 According to relevant investigation statistics, there are in our country
 some 60 million young workers and employees under the age of 35.  The main-
 stream and quality of these youthful workers and employees are good.  They
 represent an exceedingly hopeful new generation of our country's working
 class.  But for various reasons, for the time being a rather large propor-
 tion of these youthful workers are not imbued with the revolutionary spirit
 and superior virtues of the industrial proletarian class.  Frequently they
 lack the far-sighted ideology of the working class, lack the enterprising
 spirit, and sometimes look for momentary "comforts" and "material enjoy-
 ment."                   They often fail to put their exuberant vitality to good use and
 devote too much of it on petty household affairs.  A small minority may
 even make trouble out of nothing, engage in brawls and fights, and even
 step on the dangerous road of lawbreaking.  Under the present conditions
 of the great majority of workers being young people, we urgently need to
 vigorously develop popular activities which are of service to this great
 enterprise of the working class so as to attract these young workers, to
 make them strive to become the advanced and to do their utmost to fulfill
 their own wishes by means of creative labor and so that they can effectively
 display and put to good use their exuberant vitality and precious time via
 beneficial channels.  And the advanced producers movement is precisely the
 type of good popular activity which can meet immeasurably well the above
 demands.  The advanced producers movement not only possesses an extensively
 popular character but also has a highly competitive and emulative nature.
 All this. is extremely suitable to young people's special temperament.  Like
 competition in sports, labor emulation can immensely arouse the ideology,
 enthusiasm, fighting spirit, and wisdom of the young workers, and can turn
 a'dull daily work routine into ever-surging waves and undulations, full of
 excitement and steam.  It can place young workers in a lively atmosphere and
 rhythms of strain, excitement, enjoyment and gladness.  This makes them feel
 the fullness of life, the beauty of ideologies, and the bright prospects of
 .the future.  When they reap good results in their technical training, in
 technical renovation, in making rational propositions and in such activities
 as production emulation and pacesetting competition, when they are aware of
 their own importance and role in socialized production, and when they enjoy
 the fruits of glory and happiness of their creative labor, they will become
 increasingly interested and will even conscientiously regulate their own
 actions in conformity with the countenance of the working class.  In short,
 vigorous development of the advanced producers movement and enthusiastic
 mobilization of the extensive masses of young workers to join the movement
 will make the young workers more readily accept the rigid training of
 socialized production, rapidly cultivate the revolutionary character and
 superior quality of the proletarian class in industry, and become truly
 worthy successors to the working class.
 Advanced producers represent.an advanced level of the productive force.
 On the one hand, they utilize their own advanced technique, advanced

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 experiences and advanced norms to help and to teach the producers around
 them to learn and handle these advanced technology and experiences and to
 fulfill the advanced norms, in this way directly promoting the development
 of the productive force.  On the other hand, by means of their exemplary
 deeds, their advanced thinking and brand-new lifestyle, they wash away the
 dirt and poison of the old ideologies of old society, introduce new styles
 and behavior to the age of socialism and communism, attract and encourage
 millions-of people to adopt a new labor attitude and to undertake new
 fields of work, and thereby promote the onward development of the produc-
 tive force.  Since the founding of the PRC, on the various production fronts
 of our country a large number of celebrated advanced producers (workers) and
 model workers have appeared, such as Meng Tai, Shang Xiuli, Zhao Mengtao,
 Shi Chuanxiang, Wang Jinxi, Peng Haimu, Luan Fu and Zhao Chune, and those
 well-known labor models up to now are still diligently laboring on various
 fronts for the socialist enterprise.  In addition, we may mention the
 nationally known advanced production teams and units such as the "Mao
 Zedong locomotive unit," Ma Hengchang subgroup, Ma Wanshui engineering
 team, and Daqing Nos 1202 and 1205 drilling teams.  This large number of
 celebrated advanced individuals and advanced groups, plus thousands of
 advanced producers (workers), individuals and advanced units, demonstrating
 in their own selves the lofty spirit of loyalty to communist enterprises,
 their good professional virtue and their brand-new socialist lifestyle,
 truly constitute the pillar of our country's socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.  Hence the further large-scale development of the advanced producers
 movement and an increasing number of employees and workers joining it cer-
 tainly will form an extremely colorful and noble atmosphere which will wipe
 away the various kinds of evil habits and ways which corrode the socialist
 enterprises on our motherland.
 Since the founding of the PRC, as a result of the vigorous development of
 the advanced producers movement, the working class has enhanced its polit-
 ical consciousness and improved the quality of its culture and technology.
 The ranks of advanced elements in the working class have also continuously
 expanded and improved and large numbers of advanced producers and labor
 models have grown up-to become superior engineering and technical personnel,
 or administrative cadres, or leadership cadres, in the party and government
 circles.  All this categorically shows that the advanced producers movement
 is in the nature of a big school for the working class to learn communism,
 is a large melting pot for the steeling of advanced elements among the
 working class, and at the same time constitutes an extremely important road
 and form, under the new historical conditions, for the self-rebuilding and
 self-development of the working class.
 There is little doubt that the development of the advanced producers move-
 ment embodies an important significance and role in the construction of our
 country's socialist material civilization' and spiritual civilization.  How-
 ever, at present, many leadership cadres have not yet given the matter the
 importance it deserves.  In organizing the advanced producers movement, the
 leadership circles concerned are full of worries.  They seem to have their

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 hands and feet tied and can hardly do anything.  In such enterprise units,
 the trouble lies in not having attached enough importance to the movement,
 to the lack of a precise objective and concrete procedural measures, and
 an inability to envision definite results.  It often happens that after
 vainly propagating for a while, the movement came to a halt.  Naturally,
 conditions of this kind must be rapidly rectified.  In addition, there
 exist causes which impede and adversely influence our development of the
 advanced producers movement on an even larger scale.  For example, many
 enterprises to varying degrees display a bad tendency to isolate or to
 attack the advanced.  This has seriously disrupted the development of the
 "learn from the advanced" campaign.  Also, certain problems and evil prac-
 tices have been found in such phases as selection, use and propagation of
 the advanced producers.
 According to an investigation made by.relevant departments, out of the 126
 nationally known cotton spinning and weaving experts, 66, or 52 percent,
 have been taunted or criticized.  At the Yinchuan Cotton Weaving Mill in
 the Ningxia Autonomous Region, a national labor model, working as a weaver
 recently overfulfilled his spinning and weaving tasks each year.  He has
 been in the habit of using his rest hours to teach new workers his tech-
 niques.  Somebody actually wrote, words on the blackboard taunting him and
 urging him "not to show his stuff any more."  In some localities and
 enterprise units, it is difficult for the backward to become advanced.  In
 the Changsha Restaurant in H?nan Province, a young pacesetter used to have
 participated in evil ways in her early life.  After the smashing of the
 "gang of four," she was "reborn."  She was found reliable in her work and
 finally won the honor of being a pacesetter in the new Long March.  She was
 elected to the municipal political consultative committee.  Unfortunately,
 very soon, doubts, taunts and rumors were cast on her.  This was a serious
 spiritual blow to this youth who had just begun a new life.  She was so
 depressed that she thought of committing suicide.  Again, for example,
 according to an investigation made by a certain department store in
 Shanghai, it was found that of 65 advanced producers investigated, 17 felt
 that taunts, jeers and attacks were the main impediments to, their continued
 advancement.  A large number of facts show that the evil wind of isolating
 and attacking the advanced is blowing in varying degrees of severity in
 many localities and units and that this is more or less a general phenomenon.
 The various levels of leadership in the relevant departments must therefore
 pay special attention to this problem and make serious efforts to rectify it.
 The.reason why the evil wind of isolating and attacking the advanced has not
 been effectively stifled in time is basically because of the weak and loose
 disposition of the party leadership in the organizations concerned.  Iso-
 lating and attacking the advanced is basically incompatible with the
 advanced character of the working class and its political party, the nature
 of the socialist system, and the construction of the socialist spiritual
 civilization.  The firm rectification of such an abnormal phenomenon has a
 direct bearing on the consolidation and development of the leading position
 of the working class in advanced thought and the expansion and development
 of the enterprise of the working class.  Hence, our party and government
 leadership at'various levels should take a clear-cut stand in representing
 and supporting the advanced and make a thorough investigation of the plight

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 of the advanced producers and other advanced people in their respective
 localities, departments and units.  They should educate the medium-level
 and backward workers and employees on how to correctly treat the advanced
 people and criticize the erroneous ideology of not seeking advancement for
 oneself and also keeping others from advancing.  At the same time, they
 should firmly rectify the erroneous viewpoint and behavior which considers
 that all advanced producers must be advanced in everything and all through
 their lives and thus foster a demand for perfection on the advanced pro-
 ducers.  Acts which falsely accuse and attack the advanced must be sternly
 investigated and dealt with.  Serious cases involving a breach of criminal
 codes must be prosecuted.  Only in this way is it possible to foster a
 good social and political environment in which everybody learns from the.
 advanced and strives for advancement.   .
 In the final analysis, whether or not an employee or worker should be con-
 ferred a labor honor and with what kind of labor honor should be deter-
 mined by whether or not he has made any contribution and the extent of his
 contribution, if any, to the cause of promoting the development of the
 social productive force and the construction of socialist material civili-
 zation and spiritual civilization.  This should be our fundamental criterion
 for the selection of advanced producers.  Following the development of
 socialist. modern construction enterprises in our country, there should be
 an increasing number of advanced producers standing in the front ranks of
 holding, promoting and creating modern technology.   This represents an
 objective demand made on us by the passage of time.  According to an
 investigation, last year a certain machine-building plant in Shaanxi
 Province elected 96 advanced producers and 45 advanced teams at factory
 grade.  By far the great majority of them had been commended on doing
 overtime work, overfulfilling production quotas, enduring great hardships
 and undergoing extremely hard labor.  However, lacking were such advanced
 examples as the trial production of new products, renovation of tools and
 equipment, adoption of advanced technological processes and advanced tech-
 niques, strengthening of scientific management and improvement of the
 economic benefits to the enterprises.  Conditions of this kind are fairly
 common in other enterprises.  The advanced model of the "old cattle type,"
 the name of one of the categories of advanced models, represents one of the
 treasures of our party and people.  The "old cattle spirit" it exhibits is
 the revolutionary spirit of fighting hard struggles, daring to sacrifice,
 and giving one's all until one's dying day.  It is a vivid representation
 of communist ideology and is an enormous spiritual force supporting our
 construction of a modern powerful country.  Therefore, from now on, we
 should have still more of this type of advanced model.  But if only this
 one type of advanced model is available, then certainly it is not suffi-
 cient and can hardly meet the development needs of socialist modern con-
 struction.  Hence, concurrently with training and bringing up, with great
 warmth, the existing advanced people (pa"rticularly creating the necessary
 conditions for them to learn and control scientific and cultural knowledge),
 we must pay adequate attention to the discovery, nurturing and support of
 advanced models who possess the special features of being new and con-
 forming to the existing era's requirements.  At present, the number of
 young labor models is small.  This has directly reduced their influence
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 and role among the vast masses of workers.  According to an investigation
 made by relevant departments on 11 large-size backbone enterprises, of over
 90,000 young workers, only 330 workers have been selected as labor models.
 This is 0.3 percent of the total number of young workers, whereas of over
 50,000 elderly workers and middle-age workers, 397 people have been selected
 as labor models, or roughly 0.8 percent of the total number of elderly work-
 ers and middle-aged workers.  The latter proportion was nearly 300 percent
 of that for young workers.  Of course, there are various reasons for the
 small number of labor models among young workers, including the erroneous
 thought of exacting the demand for perfection among the young workers.
 Therefore, from now on, simultaneously with propagating the advanced and
 selecting labor models of the old and middle ages, we must break through
 the bondage of conservative ideology and boldly post up young advanced
 model personages so as to lover the average age of the contingents of labor
 models.  We must also hold more single-item emulations for advanced ranking.
 This will make it possible for more workers and employees to take part.
 Moreover, in order to correctly and sufficiently bring the role which labor
 models should possess into full play, we must firmly rectify the current
 phenomenon of the current labor models occupying concurrent posts, partici-
 pating in too many conferences and engaging in.too many conferences and
 engaging in too many social activities.  This will ensure that they have
 sufficient time at their disposal for production and at the same time
 strengthen their relations and contact with the masses.  We must concretely
 solve the practical problems of the work burden of a portion of the labor
 models being too heavy, of their difficulties in finding adequate time for
 studies and making advanced studies as well as their individual problems of
 daily life.  This will foster the growth of labor models.  We must in a big
 way and practically and realistically propagate the advanced ideology and
 deeds of labor models.  We must, by means of real hard work, enable
 thousands by thousands of workers and employees to continuously join the
 ranks'of the advanced and strive for achieving the objective of making, in
 the next 3-5 years, the size of the contingents of truly qualified advanced
 producers much bigger, and their quality much better, than is the case today.
 Over the more than 30 years since the founding of the PRC, we have gathered
 and accumulated many valuable experiences in organizing the advanced pro-
 ducers movement and, at the same time, we have learned many painful and
 penetrating lessons.  One of the important experiences gained is that in
 our work we must rigidly abide by the natural laws and economic laws.  We
 must,be practical and realistic no matter whether we are determining the
 emulating contents or targets or whether we are setting up advanced models
 or promoting advanced experiences.  In our country, there are nearly 400,000
 industrial and communications enterprise units.  They differ in thousands of
 ways.  In learning from the advanced and promoting advanced experiences, if
 we adopt or stick to one model or form, copy or apply mechanically, and bring
 compulsion to bear by means of the issuance of orders and directives, the
 consequence will-only be setbacks in or failure of our advanced producers
 movement.  Since the advanced producers movement is agigantic undertaking
 participated in by millions of people, it simply won't do to have only a few

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 people engaged in that work.  Hence, we must be great in strength and
 impetus and, through all necessary means, mobilize and organize the vast
 masses of people.  But we must also watch the actual results and be deter-
 mined to avoid formalism.  The way of doing things by raising a hue and cry,
 going in for ostentation and extravagance, and attending only to form has
 all along been hated and rejected by the vast masses of workers and
 employees.  It must be firmly avoided and rectified.
 We may also note that in our country at present conditions have become
 increasingly ripe for developing the advanced producers movement on an even
 larger scale than before.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee, we have implemented a series of new and important guide-
 lines and policies.  This gigantic reform of historical significance has
 lasted for 4 years. It has demonstrated to people of the whole country not
 only its political achievements but. also its material benefits.  In fact,
 the actual standard of living of the great proportion of the workers by far
 has been improved to a certain extent and everybody is living more happily.
 The improvement in the material and cultural life of the vast masses of
 workers sooner or later will be reflected in their production work and more
 or less bring about an. upsurge in their labor enthusiasm and creativeness.
 In.recent years, we have done much work in the direction of reorganizing the
 leadership ranks of the enterprises, setting up the economic responsibility
 system and training workers and employees.  In the enterprises, various
 kinds of management work such as quota control, business accounting and so
 on have been put on the right track.   If we combine the above with other
 conditions, such as strengthening ideological and political work, we can
 entirely anticipate that there will emerge, in our country an advanced
 producers movement of a gigantic scale which has the objective of building
 our country into a highly civilized and highly democratic socialist modern
 powerful nation.  Within the working class, and within the entire popula-
 tion, an increasing number of people will strive to become advanced pro-
 ducers and more and more people will indeed become advanced producers.  This
 in itself is an important symbol of the continuous elevation of our country's
 socialist spiritual civilization.  The advanced producers movement will
 surely become an enormous force promoting the modernization of our country's
 industry, agriculture, national defense and science and technology and
 pushing forward the healthy development of the entire socialist undertaking.

 THE PARTY'S CAUSE, THE PARTY'S WORK ON LITERATURE AND ART AND NONPARTY
 LITERARY AND ART WORKERS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 33-36
 [Article by Qi Fang [2058 2455]]
 [Text]  While talking about the two basic problems of audience, namely, the
 people for whom our works of literature and art are produced and the way to
 serve them, "Talks at the Yanan Forum on Literature and Art" specially
 discusses inner-party relations, namely, the relations between literary
 and art work of the party and the entire work of the party, and in addi-
 tion, a problem of the party's external relations, namely, the relations
 between the party's work on literature and art and nonparty literary and
 art workers.  For a considerably long period in the past, not many of our
 literary and art works specially discussed and analyzed Comrade Mao
 Zedong's views in this respect.  The reason why we suffered setbacks and
 made deviations in our literary and art movement was closely attributed to
 our failure to pay attention and properly deal with this view.  Therefore,
 to restudy such a view is an important subject for bringing order out of
 chaos on the literary and art front.
 As proletarian revolutionaries, politicians and theoreticians, Comrades
 Lenin and Mao Zedong observed the problems of literature and art from the
 angle of'the strategy and tactics of the entire proletarian revolutionary
 movement.  They maintained that the proletarian literary and art movement
 should not be separated from the general track of the proletarian revolu-
 tionary movement and the Marxist and Leninist leadership of the party.  With
 regard to Communist Party members who are engaged in literary and art under-
 takings, literature and art are their specific fighting posts at which they
 devote themselves to the proletarian revolutionary cause.  First of all,
 party member literary and art workers should not forget that they are
 Communist Party members.  They should implement the party's resolutions,
 guiding principles and policies and abide by the party's discipline.  They
 should on no account regard their work as an individual thing which has
 nothing to do with the general cause of the proletariat.  It was precisely

 tion and Publications":  "The work of writing should be a part of the
 general cause of the proletariat."

 Lenin's article, which was written for the party's newspaper, journal,
 publication and propaganda work, is, of course, suitable for the party's
 literary and art work.  So far as literary and art undertaking are con-
 cerned, it raises and answers the problem of inner-party relationships,
 that is, the relations between the party's literary and art work and the
 party's entire cause on the one hand and the relations between party-
 member writers and the party's organizations on the other.  Comrade Mao
 Zedong's "Talks" and other relevant works also carry forward Lenin's basic
 ideas on this subject.  It is not in accord with the basic spirit of
 Lenin's article to regard Lenin's demands on party-member artists and
 writers as demands on all artists and writers.  This would also cause,
 serious consequences in practice.
 Lenin's remarks "Writers without party spirit, get out!" referred to writers
 who had organizationally joined the party and all inner-party publication
 and propaganda workers, rather than nonparty writers and authors in general.
 After the October Revolution, while leading the struggle against the
 "proletarian cultural faction," Lenin mercilessly taunted the sectarian and
 closed door views which thought that the task of building proletarian culture
 could only be accomplished by relying on the efforts of the proletariat it-
 self together with scientists, artists and engineers who were of proletarian
 origins.  Lenin said that this was a wholesale fabrication.  He explicitly
 pointed out:  "In the activities in various fields, if we fail to form an
 alliance with nonparty personnel, we cannot begin to talk about successful
 communist construction."  ("On the Significance of Combating Materialism")
 While. affirming that the party's literary and art work is part of the
 party's entire cause, Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks" profoundly expounded the
 relations between the party's literary and art work and the nonparty lit-
 erary and art work and regarded these party's external relations as a
 problem of a united front in the literary and art circles.
 Our country's revolutionary literary and art movement is led by the party
 and attended by party member writers and artists.  This gives rise to the
 relations between the party's literary and art workers and the party.
 Revolutionary literary and art undertaking is an extensive activity of the
 masses which is closely connected with almost every member of society.
 Apart from Communist Party members, it needs the participation of a number
 of literary and art workers who sympathize with and support the revolu-
 tionary cause to varying degrees and have different ideological tendencies
 and literary and art viewpoints.  This gives rise to the problem of how our
 party should handle well its relations with nonparty literary and art work-
 ers, that is, the party's external relations.  With regard to the party,
 this actually means how our party should exercise its correct leadership
 over literature and art and arouse the enthusiasm of all positive factors
 to promote the development of literary and art undertakings.  Whether at
 the stage of democratic revolution or socialist revolution and construction,
 if the party fails to adopt correct policy to extensively cooperate with
 the masses outside the party, to fully arouse their enthusiasm and give
 play to their wisdom, talent and specialty, it is impossible to carry out
 the proletarian revolutionary literary and art movement in the true sense.

 Handling well the relations between the party and nonparty literary and art
 workers is, very often, related to the party policy toward intellectuals.
 The broad masses of intellectuals in China are full of revolutionary spirit.
 Very often, they play a vanguard and linking role in the Chinese revolution.
 Comrade Mao Zedong attached full importance to the essential role played by
 intellectuals in the process of the Chinese revolution.  In his article
 "Recruit Large Numbers of Intellectuals," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:
 "In the long and ruthless war of national liberation, in the great struggle
 to build a new China, the Communist Party must be good at winning intellec-
 tuals, for only in this way will it be able to organize great strength for
 the war of resistance, organize the millions of peasants, develop the
 revolutionary cultural movement and expand the revolutionary united front.
 Without the participation of the intellectuals victory in the revolution is
 impossible."  If we fail to unite with nonparty literary and art workers, it
 is impossible for us to correctly implement policy toward intellectuals on
 the cultural front.
 It was on the basis of such fundamental estimation and specific analysis
 that Comrade Mao Zedong expounded a series of policies and guiding prin-
 ciples for correctly handling the relations between the party and nonparty
 literary and art workers in. the literary and art work.  In his "Talks," he
 emphasized:  "Our party writers and artists must:  1) unite on this issue of
 resistance against Japan with all nonparty writers and artists (ranging from
 party sympathizers and petty bourgeois writers and artists to all those
 writers and artists of the bourgeoisie and landlord classes who are in favor
 of resistance to Japan); 2) we should unite with them on the issue of
 democracy...; 3) we should unite with them with regard to the special issue
 of method and style in literature and art."  With respect to the criterion
 for literary and art criticism, he again pointed out:  "Subject to the
 general principle of unity of resistance against Japan, we should tolerate
 literary and art works with a variety of political attitudes," "our criti-
 cism ought to permit the free competition of all varieties of works of art."
 In the meantime, he stressed,:  "In a united front, all unity and no struggle
 and all struggle and no unity are both wrong policies--as with the right
 capitulationism and tailism, or the 'left' exclusivism and sectarianism,
 practiced by some comrades in the past.  This is as true in literature and
 art as in politics."  With regard to artistic works, Comrade Mao Zedong
 maintained that we should correctly appraise them according to artistic
 criterion in a scientific way.  He said:  "We must severely criticize and
 repudiate all works of literature and art expressing views in opposition to
 the nation, to science, to the masses and to the Communist Party."  Here,-
 .Comrade Mao Zedong talked about the problem of united front and relations'
 between the party and nonparty literary and art workers.  On the literary
 and art front, the cooperation between the party and nonparty literary and
 art workers is not without principles.  Instead, it is based on the common
 great objective (defending basic interests of the masses and the nation) and
 respecting artistic law.  Instead of keeping on the right side of everyone,
 this cooperation is guided by Marxism and includes serious ideological
 struggle.  However, to strive for the common great objective and artistic
 development, we should not set the criterion for party members on nonparty
 literary and art workers and implement a closed door policy toward them.

 We should sincerely cooperate with them and bring their enthusiasm into full
 play.
 Because Comrade Mao Zedong correctly handled the relations between the
 party and nonparty literary and art workers with respect to theoretical
 principles and specific policies and correctly cooperated with all possible
 allies in the literary and art circles, we made brilliant achievements in
 our revolutionary literary and art movement at the democratic revolutionary
 stage.  On the eve of the founding of new China in 1949, the two great
 literary and art contingents from the KMT-ruled areas and the liberated
 areas successfully joined forces at the First National Congress of Literary
 and Art Workers, which marked an unprecedented and great unity of the
 Chinese literary and art movement.  At that time, almost all well-known
 writers and artists (regardless of their schooling or world. outlook)
 assembled together in the contingent of the cultural construction in new
 China led by the party.   This was a wonderful and magnificent page in the
 history of our country's revolutionary literature and art.  This was also
 a victory for the party policy for literature and art and a successful
 example of the united front work in literary and art circles.
 Under the conditions that the proletariat has succeeded in snatching state
 power and becoming a national rural party, are Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas
 quoted above still valid?  Do they still have guiding significance in
 practice?
 The answer to these questions is in the affirmative.
 After the proletariat has succeeded in snatching state power in the whole
 country, fundamental changes have taken place in class relationships and
 revolutionary tasks:  The Chinese' Communist Party has become a ruling party.
 With the accomplishment of the socialist reform of the ownership of the
 means of production, the exploiting class as a class has been eliminated and
 intellectuals, including literary and art workers, have become part of the
 laboring people and forces on which socialist construction relies.   If we
 neglect or negate such historical changes and still use the old viewpoints
 to formulate our policy toward intellectuals, we are bound to commit grave
 mistakes.  The fact that following the founding of new China, we suffered
 defeat in our guiding thought for literary and art work and committed
 "leftist" mistakes in discriminating against intellectuals was closely
 connected with our negligence of these basic changes.
 The task and scope of the literary and art movement in the socialist period
 are greater than those of the left-wing literary and art movement and the
 art movement in the liberated area.  The number of our writers and artists
 and the size of our literary and art contingent exceedingly surpass those
 made before the victory of the revolution.  Despite the fact that the number
 of party members in the literary and art circles has increased by the dozens,
 they are still the majority in the literary and art contingent.  We should
 not rely on party members alone in the literary and art circles to promote
 and develop socialist literature and art and build socialist spiritual
 civilization.  On the contrary, we should, under the leadership of the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100420001-1
 party, unite with all nonparty literary and art workers who love socialism
 and the motherland to accomplish the task together.
 Since the founding of new China, "leftist" mistakes occurred in the literary
 attd Art movement on several occasions.  We unilaterally, mechanically and
 arbitrarily dealt with the relations between the party's literary and art
 work and the party's entire work, simply regarded literary and art creativ-
 ity. as a weapon for political 'propaganda and used political movement and
 struggle to solve the matter of right and wrong in the literary and art
 movement.  Apart from that, the distinctions between the party and nonparty
 literary and art workers were obscured.  In so doing, we weakened not only
 the mass foundation of literary and art work, but also the party's leader-
 ship over literature and art and ideological work.  When such "leftist"
 ideology went to extremes, cultural autocracy and nihilism in the "Great
 Cultural Revolution" occurred.  The Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolu-
 tionary cliques not only brutally attacked nonparty literary and art workers,
 but also treated a number of literary and art workers inside the party as
 enemies.  The direct result brought about by such act was that in the
 literary,field of a big country with a population of 1 billion, only a few
 "revolutionary writers" survived.  In a civilized ancient country with a
 long history of 5,000 years, there were only 8 "model operas."  On the
 other hand, the practice of the literary and art movement in our country
 following the founding of new China has also shown us that we should guard
 against another danger:  If we give up necessary ideological struggle on the
 literary and art front and the leading role of Marxism in the ideological
 and cultural fields, underestimate the corrosion of the ideological influ-
 ence of the old society and various bourgeois ideological trends from
 foreign countries and attach importance to unity alone without carrying out
 necessary ideological struggle, our actions will give rise to the bourgeois
 liberalization and the spread of bourgeois ideology.  In so doing, Marxism
 will lose its ideological front and the socialist nature of the literary and
 art movement and its role in. the socialist superstructure will also diminish.
 In the new historical period, the conditions of the party organizations and
 party members in the literary. and art contingent are matters of fundamental
 significance for upholding the orientation of the socialist literature and
 art, because we rely on them to implement the party's line, guiding prin-
 ciple and policies.  Because party organizations in the literary and art
 contingent were sabotaged and weakened during the 10 years of internal
 disorder, the sense of responsibility to the party of some party-member
 literary and art workers has been dulled.  This has become a major problem
 which adversely affects the healthy development of the literary and art
 movement.  Therefore, we should stress. that party organizations in the
 literary and art contingent should maintain their political and ideological
 purity and that party-member writers should strengthen their party spirit.
 All party members who are engaged in literary and art work should, first of
 all, realize that they are Communist Party members before they regard them-
 selves as writers or artists.   In this respect, all Communist Party members
 should do so without exception.  In other words, all party-member literary
 and art workers should be bound not only by constitution and law, but also
 by the party's program and constitution.  They should conscientiously abide

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 by the party's discipline and implement the party's guiding principles,
 policies and resolutions.  They should unequivocally keep in line polit-
 ically with the CPC Central Committee, maintain the party's ideological
 and organizational purity and resolutely fight against all ideology and
 acts which run counter to the party's interests.  They should not conceal
 their political features as Communist Party members and contaminate the
 communist banner.  They should influence the masses around them with their
 own exemplary acts and excellent communist characters.  They should neither
 lower the standard for themselves and slacken their efforts to set strict
 demands on themselves nor stand above the masses, separate themselves from
 the masses and consider themselves to be reformers.  Writers enjoy freedom
 of literary and artistic creativity.  However, party-member writers should
 not set their creative freedom against their duties as party members.  The
 party has conferred full rights on them so that inside the party they can
 present their opinions to the party organizations or even the CPC Central
 Committee.  Outside the party organizations, they are not allowed to make
 use of their social status as writers to express ideas and remarks which
 are not in accord with the party's principle or violate the party's line,
 guiding principles and policies.  Party-member writers and artists should
 take part in the activities of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a
 hundred schools of thought contend."  However, they should take part in
 such activities as Communist Party members rather than-as writers and
 artists in general.  In the activities of letting a hundred schools of
 thought contend, they should expand the ideological front of Marxism, but
 not the opposite.  If we fail to solve this problem, we will not be able
 to retain the socialist nature of the literary and art movement, ensure the
 party's leadership over literary and artistic undertaking or correctly arouse
 the enthusiasm of nonparty literary and art workers.
 In the new historical period, the handling of the relations between the
 party and nonparty literary and art workers is actually a problem of how
 our party should correctly exercise its leadership over literary and art
 undertaking.  To solve this problem, in-depth study and exploration are
 needed.
 First, we should amply trust the majority of our literary and art workers.
 We should not regard them as alien forces or reject them because some of
 them have made certain mistakes and/or have shortcomings in certain respects.
 Otherwise, we will commit "leftist" mistakes.  The fact that literary and
 art workers have become part of the laboring people does not mean that they
 have all become Marxists.  This is also the case with workers and peasants
 who can'also be influenced by nonproletarian and non-Marxist ideology.  The
 main work we should do is that on the basis of trusting them, we should
 gradually guide, help and educate them.
 Furthermore, we should realize that in the new historical period, the
 cooperation between the party and nonparty literary and art workers on the
 literary and art front is still very extensive.  For instance, in our
 endeavor to realize the socialist modernization of the motherland and
 getting rid of poverty and backwardness, our literary'and art workers have
 more common language.  We are now facing.the task of returning Taiwan to the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100420001-1
 motherland and of opposing imperialism and hegemonism.  Under the slogan
 of uniting the motherland and reinvigorating China, we should not only
 arouse the enthusiasm of the broad masses of literary and art workers on
 the mainland, but also unite with all patriotic literary and art workers
 and artistic schools, including Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao
 compatriots and Overseas Chinese to promote the prosperity, richness and
 colorfulness of our socialist literature and art.
 What guiding principle and methods should we adopt to arouse the socialist
 enthusiasm of the broad masses of intellectuals, including literary and art
 workers?  We should pursue the principle of distinguishing the two kinds of
 contradictions with different nature, including that of "letting a hundred
 flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend."  Comrade Mao
 Zedong regarded the "double hundred" policy as a principle for promoting
 and developing literary and artistic creation and sciences.  To implement
 this policy, we should encourage works of various artistic styles and
 schools and various literary and art viewpoints to compare, contend, compete
 and argue with one another.  This includes ideological struggle.  The idea
 of regarding the "double hundred" policy as a practice devoid of criticism
 and struggle runs counter to the policy.  Of course, it is harmful to adopt
 crude'and repressive measures to deal with an ideological problem.  We
 should learn to overcome various erroneous ideas by the method of persuasion
 and education.
 Due to the sabotaging activities carried out by the "gang of four" in the
 ideological field and the attack of the bourgeois ideological, literary and
 artistic trends, our literary and art circles are faced not only with the
 task of continuing to fight against the pernicious influence of "leftist"
 mistakes, but also with the task of fighting against, to varying degrees,
 bourgeois liberalization.  This problem not only exists inside the party,
 but also involves nonparty literary and art workers.  In recent years, under
 the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee, we have been carrying
 out an ideological struggle on the two fronts in the literary and art
 circles.  While upholding the Marxist principle, we also help and educate
 the broad masses of literary and art workers and arouse their enthusiasm to
 the greatest possible extent.  This is a successful practice for dealing
 with ideological struggle in the literary and art field.  Summing up new
 experience in this respect is a matter of guiding significance for the
 development of the literary and art movement in the future.

 MAKE GREAT EFFORTS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ESSENCE OF THE DOCUMENTS AND
 SEEK IDEOLOGICAL UNITY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 37-38
 ["Short" commentary]
 [Text]  There has already been massive enthusiasm throughout China in
 studying the documents of the 12th CPC National Congress.  Everything
 points toward relatively clear and effective results as a consequence of
 the importance being attached to the documents by party members at every
 level in every region and the resultant enthusiasm to study the documents
 by cadres in general.  Many cadres have seen their understanding and con-
 sciousness raised as well as their political enthusiasm.
 In terms of the overall process, study has only just begun, profound study
 is still to follow.  According to the plans of the party Central Committee,
 the first stage of study mainly concentrates on learning and grasping the
 spirit of the documents, elevating one's understanding and uniting ideology
 in the direction of the plans and policies laid down by the 12th CPC
 National Congress.  The contents of the documents of the 12th congress are
 rich and abundant.  It supports the principle integrating the universal
 truth of Marxism with the objective facts concerning China's present con-
 ditions so that through our study we can bring together the experiences we
 have gathered from socialist construction in China and produce a mass of
 new, correct policies and directions which will open up a new era in the
 socialist modernization construction program.  Using our theories we can
 make clearer elucidations of Marxism, thereby embodying the new leap that
 the party is making in terms of understanding and appreciating the rules
 of China's socialist construction.  The documents are the development of
 Maoism under new historical conditions and they represent the compass for
 all our future work.   Only by fully and completely understanding and
 grasping the spirit of the documents is it possible to correctly initiate
 and implement our plans and our work and to avoid making mistakes.  Thus,
 we must be earnest in our study of the documents, we must examine them
 closely and deeply and not be satisfied with only a superficial under-
 standing.  We must avoid anything which influences our full and thorough
 understanding of the documents, such as'insufficient analysis of the docu-
 ments or insufficient examination of the situation before drawing up work
 plans'; deviation from the contents of the documents to discuss nothing

 but generalities; using supplementary reading material instead of the
 essence of the documents during study, and so forth.  In the past, some
 cadres have made such mistakes as these, that is, they did not study the
 documents sufficiently and therefore were not able to grasp their essence,
 the result being that their behavior ran opposite to the spirit of the
 documents, causing them to make mistakes.  We should remember this.
 A full understanding of the spirit of the documents allows us to increase
 our understanding, seek ideological unity and guide our work.  A key link
 here is to bring together ideology and reality, to make comparisons with
 the documents and overcome such thinking which does not correspond with the
 essence of the 12th congress documents.  We must understand that by ignor-
 ing this step, it is impossible for the essence of the documents to truly
 take root in our minds.  The documents of the 12th congress cleared up a
 series of problems which needed rectification in order to establish this
 new stage in the socialist modernization construction program.  For exam-
 ple, it counteracted "leftist" tendencies as well as rightist tendencies;
 it clarified the tactical targets for socialist modernization construction;
 accumulated funds to carry out important construction work; developed many
 different economic styles and implemented the system of responsibility in
 management and administration; took the implementation of a planned economy
 as being.of utmost importance and market readjustments as supplementary;
 outlined education and science as being the most important strategies for
 development of the economy; strengthened the education of communist
 ideology; established socialist spiritual civilization; successfully
 attacked corruption and crime in the economic, political and cultural
 spheres; restructured the system of leadership; and activated revolu-
 tionarism, youthfulness, expertise and perception among the cadre ranks.
 We all have our own opinions of these problems; some are correct, some are
 not so correct or accurate.  Only on the basis of understanding the essence
 of the documents and carrying out intercadre discussions and meetings can
 we hope to unite our ideology and understanding.
 Studying documents and uniting ideology represent a glorious tradition in
 our party, but during the 10 years of internal disorder, this tradition
 was severely damaged.  The "gang of four" used unity of ideology as one of
 their means with the result that this present readvocation of the idea as a
 means of study has met with'some doubt from some comrades.  If this situa-
 tion is not rectified, then we will be unable to continue our study work
 in any depth.  Leaders on all levels should work hard to implement the
 unity of ideology and reality, such an important link in the chain, and in
 doing so bring about a restoration of one of the party's glorious study
 methods.
 Understanding and grasping the essence of the documents, raising our
 appreciation and perception and unifying our ideology are all extremely
 important steps to be taken.  Only by thoroughly carrying out this step can
 one go on to the next step involving the linking up of all this with the
 actual work situation in each individual region, department or work unit,
 collating and learning from experience and examining and implementing the
 measures and plans outlined in the essence of the 12th CPC National Congress.

 The key to carrying out deeper study lies in strengthening leadership.  Now,
 we should take a look at the study process, at the understanding of the
 essence of the documents, the linking of ideology and reality, the unifica-
 tion of our understanding with the demands of the essence of the 12th CPC
 National Congress and ask ourselves how well were these things carried out!
 What experiences have been gained from doing so?  What problems exist?
 How can we improve things?  And so forth.
 Our first major task today is to study the 12th congress documents.  This
 then demands that we have a concrete order to our work, that we ensure
 definite work periods and that we ensure that the cadres study in earnest.
 We should not consider our task of studying the congress documents as some-
 thing outside our work.  Studying the party line, policies and direction is
 itself our work and is indeed the very first part of any of our work.  Link-
 ing this with the workers must first be seen in terms of a blueprint.                     The
 tactical program drawn up in the documents until the end of this century
 are a great blueprint for work and only by first studying it carefully can
 we arduously struggle to construct the great modernized tower of socialism
 with clear direction, great determination, correct methodology and aware-
 ness.

 IS THE PRACTICE OF DISTRIBUTION ACCORDING TO WORK CONTRADICTORY TO THE
 PROMOTION OF A COMMUNIST WORK ATTITUDE?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 38-40
 [Article by Xue Yan [5641 1693]]
 [Text]  In their study of the 12th national congress reports, some comrades
 made.the point that on the one hand they were carrying out policies of
 distribution according to work while on the other hand advocating a com-
 munist attitude toward work and were these two policies not contradictory?
 How should we come to understand this problem?
 Distribution according to work is socialism's distribution principle.  It
 sets out that everyone receives remuneration according to the quantity and
 quality of their own work, so that more work produces more pay and less work
 produces less pay while no work produces no pay.  A communist attitude
 toward work means carrying out work of one's own free will regardless of
 quotas or remuneration.  Both of these two concepts are very different but
 both are vital to this present stage we find ourselves in.  A correct
 handling of the relations between these two concepts is of great signifi-
 cance to the promotion of the socialist modernized construction program.
 Distribution relations in society are decided by the situation relating to
 the means of production.  In a capitalist society where the means of produc-
 tion are privately owned, the exploitive classes rely on the means of pro-
 duction that they own to exploit the surplus labor of the workers and thus
 pass their days earning money but without having to work while, at the same
 time, the workers are economically exploited and politically suppressed.
 In a socialist society the workers are the masters of the state.  Under
 conditions of socialist public ownership of the means of production, the
 people have equal rights of possession of the means of production and
 distribution of consumer products is carried out according to the principle
 of distribution according to work.  This is the greatest advance in history
 ever made by human societies.  Although the communist principle of distribu-
 tion according to need continues to develop and become more ideal it can
 only be truly achieved in a communist society with a highly developed
 productive force, and with a population with a highly' developed conscious-,
 ness.  During the stage of socialism it is only possible to implement
 distribution according to work.  As far as China''s present situation is
 64

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 concerned, industrious implementation of the principles of distribution
 according to work is today still a problem which has not been completely
 solved whether it be in the industrial sector, the agricultural sector or
 any other sector and it thus still requires active and concentrated work.
 There is still a great deal of work to be.done including the structuring
 of the system of economic management.  Correct implementation of the prin-
 ciples of distribution according to work allows us, to actually see and feel
 material benefits in the process of constructing socialism, so that as
 production develops so too do our individual contributions to the cause
 and thus, at the same time, the standards of living both materially and
 culturally gradually improve for everyone, thereby activating everyone's
 enthusiasm to construct socialism and to work even harder for society and
 also promoting the ever faster development of the productive forces as well
 as technology and culture.  This is a question of essential importance to
 the construction of socialism.
 While distribution according to work is socialism's distribution principle,
 it is also an objective rule for the development of socialist economics.
 We must recognize it, take advantage of it but on no account abuse it or
 destroy it, otherwise we just-,accept punishment.  We all still remember how
 in 1958 some comrades, under the guidance of mistaken "leftist" thinking,
 went against the principles of distribution according to work subjectively
 believing they could hasten the advent of communism in this way by blowing
 "the wind of communism" and eating "the largest portions of rice."  The
 result was serious damage to production, while people's living standards
 were also seriously affected.  During the 10 years of social chaos,
 "leftist" tendencies and mistakes reached their pinnacle with the result
 that not only was distribution according to work no longer conscientiously
 practiced, it was also criticized so that the end result was serious damage
 to the workers' enthusiasm and the creating of one of the main factors
 blocking the development of the economy.  These experiences should not be
 forgotten.
 Why, then, in this stage of socialism is the communist attitude toward
 labor again being advocated?
 1.  A socialist society represents the initial stage of communism with
 society's basic means of production already under public ownership and
 with society already having produced common benefits for all.  Thus, a
 significant portion of the work advocated for socialist workers is for
 society.  This portion of work must be deducted and is dissimilar to that
 in other societies and is designed to consolidate and'develop the system
 of public ownership of the means of production as well as fulfilling the
 demands of common benefits and long-term benefits.  For these reasons,
 therefore, it contains elements of communist labor. As far as society's
 total line of products is concerned,. what products should be included in
 this portion of labor?  In his "Critique of Gothe's Program" Marx dis-
 cussed the question of distribution during the primary stage of communism
 and listed the following few items.  The portion of labor which goes toward
 making up for means of production lost in consumption--if that portion is
 not deducted then even simple reproduction in society cannot be maintained.

 The portion of labor added to increase production; the portion used to pay
 for foreseen mishaps; general management costs not directly related to
 production; the portion used to satisfy common needs, such as schools and
 health facilities; these accurate divisions drawn up by Marx were developed
 by taking an objective look at the real situation and carrying out theoreti-
 cal analysis of future societies.  If we integrate the practicalities of the
 communist movement and China's present social situation, then we can see
 that. there is still a portion of China's products which must be seen as
 national defense costs.  Only after deducting these can society distribute
 the means of subsistence according to the quantity of work preferred by
 each worker.  Obviously, socialist workers should not work merely to
 receive their money, in addition they should have a concrete communist
 attitude toward labor and they should work with enthusiasm for socialist
 production as well as the above few items so closely connected to common
 benefits.  Otherwise, not only will the socialist society be unable to
 progress and develop, it will also no longer be able to exist.
 2.  As far as advocating a communist attitude toward labor is concerned,
 there are several questions of significance worth asking.  One is the
 question of how a socialist worker should treat his own work tasks and the
 other is what level of consciousness a worker should have.  The principles
 of distribution of consumer products can only be achieved according to the
 principles of distribution according to work, but all workers would say
 there should be no adoption of such attitudes as "work according to pay,"
 "work only as much as the pay is worth" and so on.  The reasons for this
 are that since the workers are already the masters of their society, work
 is both for the society and oneself, regardless of whether it is paid or
 unpaid work.  This is totally different from the capitalist and master/
 worker type work of the old society.  Every worker must fully appreciate
 his or her position.  Of course, this communist attitude toward work that.
 is being advocated is not mainly designed to promote unpaid work, but
 instead, is most importantly demanding that everyone take full responsi-
 bility for their own work and constantly keep improving themselves.  Prac-
 tical experience shows that if when we practice distribution according to
 labor we only concern ourselves with how much money we get for how much
 work, then, without carrying out any ideological and political work and
 without advocating the principles of a communist attitude toward labor, it
 is very easy to go astray and produce tendencies of concerning ourselves
 solely with money.  In his report to the 12th national congress, Comrade
 Hu Yaobang said:  "If, under the guidance of communist ideology, we ignore
 this great task of constructing socialist spiritual civilization throughout
 society, then the people's understanding and perception of socialism will
 become one-sided with the result that the people's attention will only be
 drawn to the construction of a material civilization or even only to the
 search for material benefits.  If this happens, our modernized construction
 will no longer be able to guarantee a socialist direction with the result
 that our socialist society will lose its ideals and its targets as well as
 the force of its spirit and its fighting will, with the result that it will
 not be able to resist corruption by many corrosive factors and may even see
 lopsided development or deterioration."

 By educating the masses with communism, it will even be easier to imple-
 ment policies of distribution according to labor and solve the contradic-
 tions between distribution according to work and the communist attitude
 toward work.  We already have many examples of this having taken place in
 our present-day life.  Such advanced and developed people as Lei Feng,
 Wang Jie, Qiao Yulu and Zhao Qune represent models for the correct resolu-
 tion of this kind of contradiction.  They were able to carry out their
 work and the labor for both the party and the people and they gave their
 all until the end.  They are exemplary figures who displayed a communist
 attitude toward work.
 China has already had 30 years of socialist public ownership of the means
 of production and after a long period of education the masses are grad-
 ually beginning to establish a philosophy of being masters of their world
 and as a result we are achieving great victories for socialist construc-
 tion.  Nevertheless, we must remember that because of new increase in the
 composition of the workers as well as the destructive effect of the 10
 years of social disorder and various weaknesses in our present work, there
 still exists today a not insignificant number of people who do lack the
 philosophy of being masters of their own society and who lack a communist
 attitude toward work.  Some people continue to enjoy the great benefits
 provided,as a result of the socialist public ownership of the means of
 production without putting any effort into working or laboring for social-
 ism, indeed some even loaf around at work and do nothing.  In our present
 work of educating the masses in correct communist ideology we must stress
 the importance of learning how to be masters of their society in line with
 the socialist public ownership of the means of production.  Undergoing this
 kind of education will make the working classes and other workers come to
 understand the historical duty they are to bear and thus give full expres-
 sion to the advantages of the socialist system.
 Teaching cadres and the masses to adopt a communist attitude toward work
 is a long-term process, but as far as Communist Party members are con-
 cerned it is a very immediate problem.  In his report to the 12th CPC
 National Congress, Hu Yaobang said:  "Of course we cannot expect every
 member of society to become a communist, but we must make use of communist
 ideology to aim at Communist Party members, CYL members and all advanced
 members of society and through them educate and influence the masses."  As
 far as a true and correct communist is concerned, he or she should'not by
 any means be a revolutionary only for the sake of distribution according to
 work.  A Communist Party member should on the one hand work hard to imple-
 ment party policies, such as distribution according to work, but on the
 other hand he or she should not on any account make distribution according
 to work a final and advanced target or aim.  In this way their work and
 their labors will not be completely money oriented but will be selfless
 and altruistic, making the benefits of the party and the people the most
 important thing to work for.  When contradictions arise between individual
 interests and those of the state or between short-term and long-term
 interests, then these people will be able to consciously subordinate
 individual interests to those of the state and subordinate short-term

 interests to those of a long-term nature and even, should it come to it,
 sacrifice themselves for the cause, even to the extent of giving their
 lives.  Only in this way can we hope to activate the masses and promote
 the development of the socialist modernized construction program and move
 onutard toward our glorious aim of communism.

 WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT COMMUNIST IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION AT THE
 SOCIALIST STAGE?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 41-43
 [Article by An Tung [1344 0681]]
 [Text]   In his report to the 12th CPC National Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang
 proposed:   "At the present stage, we must adhere to the system of to each
 according to one's work and to all socialist principles.  Of course, we
 cannot wish everyone to be a communist, but we must measure CPC members,
 CYL members and all advanced elements by communist ideological standards,
 and through them, educate and influence the broad masses."
 Viewed from the angle of the socialist economic system or from the angle
 of the socialist political structure, there is a major difference between
 China's socialist system and the past private ownership system.  China's
 socialist system is a product under the guidance of the communist
 ideological system.  It has to be gradually improved in practice.  How-
 ever, it will undoubtedly lead China's society into the advanced stage of
 communism.  Although for many years some Communist Party members have been
 doing the specific work of the socialist and communist cause, have been
 practicing communist ideology in action, have been living in the communist
 movement and have been facing the increasing communist factors, they do not
 consciously or not too consciously understand the communist nature of our
 cause.  Under such circumstances, although they work faithfully and dili-
 gently, it is often difficult for them to do a good job in their work, in
 particular it is difficult for them to meet the increasing requirements in
 socialist modernization.  Some comrades shoulder the heavy responsibilities
 entrusted by the party and the people, but-they think that the present
 policies and work have nothing to do with communism.  When we emphasize
 that we must carry out communist ideological education, they feel strange
 and are upset.  They even think that it is queer to carry out communist
 ideological education in the course of building socialism.  Such a
 phenomenon shows that it is a pressing task to educate party members,
 particularly leading cadres at all levels, to understand well the com-
 munist nature of our cause in the course of socialist modernization, to
 always remember guidance concerning the communist ideological system and
 to always remember the great aim of communism.

 Some comrades are worried that the "leftist" erroneous tendency will emerge
 again and that the "communist wind" will prevail again, as did in 1958.  In
 particular, they are afraid that the country will be plunged into the
 fallacy of communism which was practiced by Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-
 revolutionary cliques during the "Cultural Revolution."  In order to dispel
 such misgivings, it is necessary for us to seriously review the history of
 the party and the situation since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee.  Everyone knows that we have corrected the mistakes of
 the "Cultural Revolution," that we have corrected the past "leftist"
 erroneous tendency, that we have completed the task of bringing order out
 of chaos in our. guiding thinking, that we have achieved the great victory
 of bringing order out of chaos. in our practical work on various fronts and
 that we have worked out and implemented a Marxist line and a series of
 principles and policies to guarantee that our country's socialist construc-
 tion will go forward along a correct road.  Battling for the realization of
 communism is the duty and job of all communists. We should hold high the
 banner of communism.  But it does not mean practicing a "leftist" erroneous
 line.  Now we can see more and more clearly that not only was the "leftist"
 erroneous tendency not the product of the communist ideological system, but
 on the contrary, that it was the result of violating the communist ideologi-
 cal system.  The purpose of emphasizing the carrying out of communist
 ideological education and of arming all the party members and the people
 of all nationalities throughout the country with communist ideology is, in
 the light of specific conditions and under the guidance of the communist
 ideological system, to resolutely implement all the present socialist poli-
 cies and to conscientiously understand the relationship between our present
 work and the great aim of communism.  In addition, this also enables us to
 constantly overcome and correct the erroneous tendency that distorts, from
 various aspects and in various manners, communist ideology and the party's
 principles and policies.  It not only opposes bourgeois liberalization and
 prevents Communist Party members from being corrupted by the decadent capi-
 talist ideology, but also opposes an ossified way of thinking and prevents
 any "leftist" erroneous line from emerging.
 History is a kind of connection, an objective course which has its own
 internal law.  The wisdom of communists lies in the fact that they can use
 Marxism, which is the most scientific and the most revolutionary ideology,
 to observe and tackle problems and that they can do practical work together
 with the people with a firm belief for the future and in the great spirit
 of historical optimism to bring our society toward the predicted goal.
 They are the conscious creators of history.  Our party's line and all its
 various principles and policies are the products of correctly understanding
 China's situation under the guidance of the communist; ideological system,
 and they can only be correctly understood and implemented under that
 guidance.  In his opening speech delivered to the 12th CPC National Con-
 gress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:  "The line put forward by the 8th CPC
 National Congress was correct.  But at that time, the party was not suffi-
 ciently mentally prepared for overall socialist construction, and the line
 and. many correct suggestions put forward by the 8th CPC National Congress
 could not be persistently carried out in practice."  This was directly
 related to our being unable to understand and handle well the various

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 problems in socialist construction under the guidance of the communist
 ideological system.  The results of the implementation of the correct line,
 principles and policies in different regions, departments and units are
 often greatly different, some are even different to what is expected.  One
 important reason is that communist ideology in the minds of some leading
 cadres is not firm enough and that they do not adopt a serious attitude
 with regard to the party's line, principles and policies.
 The reason why the social policies formulated by the party at a certain
 historical stage are correct is that these policies are in line with
 actual conditions; at the same time, they also promote the development of
 our cause toward the communist goal.  So long as the social status of a
 policy in a certain historical period is not fundamentally changed, such a
 policy must be continued so as to maintain relative stability.  We must
 understand the relationship between each.stage of the communist movement
 and its various stages from a high plane of the whole course of the
 historical development of such a movement.  Only in this way, can we imple-
 ment well policies which are suited to the actual conditions of a certain
 historical stage, and can we,implement well policies which are suited to:a
 new historical stage when the situation fundamentally changes and history
 enters a new stage.  Only in this way can we have an overall understanding
 of the present policies, see that we must conscientiously implement the
 policies for a fairly long time to come and realize that by comparing with
 the final target of communists, the stability of policies is necessary and
 relative.  Only in this way can we always remember the great target and
 highest ideal of communists and avoid becoming short-sighted persons who
 rest content with the present situation.  For instance, the policy of to
 each according to his work is a social policy our party must adhere to and
 gradually perfect during the socialist period.  Communist Party members
 should become models who can guarantee the implementation of this policy.
 If we do not implement the policy of to each according to his work, we will
 not be able to realize the tasks set by the party for the socialist period,
 and only by resolutely implementing this policy can socialist construction
 develop healthily and can the necessary social conditions be created for
 the future implementation of the policy of to each according to his needs.
 On the other hand, Communist Party members must do their work without
 thinking too much about remuneration.  They must, in the communist spirit,
 handle well various social problems and social contradictions which cannot
 be appropriately solved by merely implementing the policy of to each
 according to his work.  At the present stage, like safeguarding the policy
 of to each according to his work, this is the need for the people's interests,
 as well as the need for historical development.
 In the final analysis, what should we rely on to bring into play the
 people's initiative for carrying out socialist modernization?  Some people
 say that we should rely on material incentives, bonuses and "material
 benefit."  Material incentives, including bonuses, can, to a certain extent,
 bring the people's initiative into play, so long as it is applied in a
 correct manner.  In enabling the people to consistently maintain a high
 level of initiative and in giving such initiative a correct direction,
 obviously, it will not do just to rely on material incentives.  Material

 living conditions and material production are the prerequisite to the
 existence of human beings.  But the life and production of a society or of
 an individual have never been without purpose, they must have a certain
 ideal as their spiritual mainstay.  In material life and material production,
 the people always gradually form their appraisal and attitude with regard to
 actual social life and social productive activities and thus form their
 social ideals.  Correct ideology and beautiful ideals are not only the
 indispensable part of the people's social life, but also guarantee that the
 people's social life can develop healthily and guarantee that the level of
 social material production keeps rising.  Communist theory correctly
 explains the people's material life and material productive activities.
 Therefore only if we are under its guidance can we understand and handle
 the problem of material benefit, set a lofty target for our life and under-
 stand well the present social, value and its historical significance, and
 obtain the greatest encouragement.  Only communist ideals can make us fear
 neither hardship nor setbacks and enable us to maintain full enthusiasm and
 the confidence to be successful in our revolutionary cause.  When necessary
 one must sacrifice one's life without any hesitation.  The reason why we
 emphasize the necessity for bringing the people's initiative into play by
 carrying out communist ideological education is that within the sphere of
 the whole society, we will enable the people to have a communist work atti-
 tude, social relations based on love and unity and the noble character of
 wholehearted dedication to the people's cause so as to bring forward the
 smooth development of our socialist modernization and to meet in a better
 manner the daily increasing needs for material and cultural life of all
 the members of society.
 Energetically carrying out communist ideological education in the course of
 socialist modernization is a motive force for bringing the people's initia-
 tive into full play, as well as a motive force for victoriously developing
 our cause.  With this motive force, our cause will cert4Lily,have a bright
 future and unlimited prospects.

 WHY MUST PLANS OF A MANDATORY NATURE BE ENFORCED WITH REGARD TO IMPORTANT
 PRODUCTS AND KEY ENTERPRISES?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 43-44
 [Article by Zhao Mu [0340 3603]],
 [Text] Plans of a mandatory nature are those which have a binding force
 and are transmitted by the state to the lower levels.  They are worked out
 by the state's planning departments and are transmitted to enterprises and
 departments, which should seriously execute them and complete them as
 scheduled.  They are an important. form of planned management of the
 national economy in a socialist state through the conscious implementation
 of economic principles.
 In view of the actual situation of our planned economy, plans of a manda-
 tory nature should be enforced with regard to the production and distribu-
 tion of production means and means of subsistence which are vital to the,
 state-owned economy, in particular key enterprises which are vital to the
 entire economy.  This is an important reflection of the organization and
 management of production in socialist ownership by the whole people.  Under
 the ownership by the whole people, the production means and products of
 enterprises do not belong to the enterprises, but to the state, which
 represents the entire nation.  The state is the organizer and leader of the
 economic system of ownership by the whole people.  Based on existing
 resources and productivity, and on the objective demand for various scales
 of socialized mass production, the state coordinates and directs the
 economic, activities of enterprises under the ownership by the whole people
 through state plans.  At the same time, a certain amount of independence
 and autonomy are given to such enterprises.  These enterprises are not the
 independent owners of production means, but economic units which are under
 the state and enjoy a certain autonomy.  They have the responsibility and
 obligation to carry out mandatory plans transmitted by the state.  Only in
 this way can the completion of state plans and the state's control over the
 production means and products of state-run enterprises be ensured.
 The fact that plans of a mandatory nature must be enforced with regard to
 important products and key enterprises which are vital to the state-owned
 economy is a prerequisite for the successful development of the entire
 national economy.  Why?

 Socialist economy is a planned economy.  The execution of mandatory plans
 is the main body of the planned economy.  The adherence to mandatory plans
 is the key to the adherence to the planned economy.  State-owned economy
 plays a leading role in the national economy.  Because of their significance
 and production value, products under mandatory plans constitute a major
 portion of the national economy although they only constitute a small por-
 tion in terms of variety.  Mandatory plans ensure the state's control of the
 entire economy and the production and supply of key industrial raw materials,
 facilities, energy and basic necessities, so that the basic stability of
 market and price can be maintained and chaos in the whole of economic life
 can be avoided.  Plans of a mandatory nature constitute a restriction over
 the economic activities of enterprises.  At the same time, they serve as an
 assurance, for they provide the enterprises with key facilities, raw mate-
 rials, energy and external conditions for the sale of products.
 Through mandatory plans, the state directly adjusts the main body of social
 production, ensures that key constructions and urgent social needs are pro-
 vided with vital industrial raw materials and energy, increases short-term
 products and put restrictions on long-term ones, so that proportion and
 balance among departments can be maintained.  Under circumstances in which
 prices are unreasonable and basic readjustment is impossible in the short
 tun, the effect of mandatory plans becomes more significant.  Enterprises'
 partial and immediate interests are often in contradiction with the state's
 overall and long-term interests.  Mandatory plans are often required to
 resolve such contradictions.  They can directly reflect the objective
 demands of basic socialist economic principles and those of the principles
 of planned development.  Cancelling or diminishing the necessary realm of
 mandatory plans will give rise to blind and repetitive construction and
 production, incur loss and affect economic development.
 The enforcement of mandatory plans brings the efficiency of guiding plans
 into full play so that under the condition that planned economy takes the
 lead, they help regulate the market, thus serving as an effective supple-
 ment to the planned economy.  In the past we one-sidedly emphasized manda-
 tory plans, doing so strictly and excessively that we neglected the effect
 of economic lever and market regulation.  This was one of the causes of
 drawbacks such as production being out of line with demand and poor economic
 results in enterprises.  The economic system reform under way also aims to
 work out.a solution to this problem.  In his report made at the 12th CPC
 Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out that, apart from plans of a manda-
 tory nature, economic levers would primarily be applied to quite a few
 products and enterprises, to ensure the implementation of guiding plans.
 The production of various minor commodities would be freely arranged by
 enterprises in accordance with changes in supply and demand.  Since these
 three forms of management are in harmony with the level of our productivity
 and. the coexistence of various economic forms, they should be combined
 organically so that each has a role to play.  In this way our economic
 development will be concentrated, united, flexible and multifarious.  Basing
 on experience gained in the fifties, the fact that thQ state is in control
 of the'economic lifelines, leading the planned production and circulation of
 major industrial and agricultural products and the free production and

 circulation of minor ones is a prerequisite for the prevention of overall
 economic confusion.
 Staple.food, cotton', oil and other major agricultural by-products are basic
 necessities for major industrial raw materials and for the people in cities
 and rural areas.  Due to our huge population, insufficient arable land and
 backward agricultural production, such agricultural by-products are always
 in acute shortage.  The state should, therefore, set some mandatory targets
 for collective ownership economy, to ensure that the state is in possession
 of considerable amount of grain and other major agricultural by-products to
 satisfy the needs for national construction and the people's livelihood.
 The collective economy in the rural areas is collective ownership by the
 laboring masses who have the right to freely utilize their own production
 means and to distribute their own products.  The state should respect the
 autonomy of units under collective ownership and of the peasants.  It
 should, however, ensure that the interests of such units and peasants are
 basically in harmony with those of the masses.  The development of national
 construction and the economic development of ownership by the entire people
 will benefit the agricultural population:  Therefore, the state should
 respect the autonomy of the collective economic units and should also set
 mandatory targets for the purchase and distribution of staple foods and
 other major agricultural by-products.  Consequently, not only the urban
 residents but also the masses of peasants will be benefited.

 the provincial government and leading comrades at all levels who took the
 lead in the study.
 The provincial party committee supported our decision to hold the examina-
 tion.  Prefectural and municipal party committees and leading comrades of
 various provincial government departments also paid great attention to the
 examination. Many units held special meetings to check the situation of
 study and work out revision plans.  Effective measures were taken to
 supplement the study and revision so as to ensure that the majority of the
 cadres could sit the examination and gain better results.  Fuzhou prefec-
 tural party committee decided to join the provincial regular and unified
 examination and consequently it arranged a certain time for reviewing
 even though the prefecture was at the time seriously hit by floods and
 was busily engaged in relief work.  Senior leading comrades of Zhangzhou
 prefectural party committee and two other leading comrades had official
 duty on the day of the examination; consequently they sat the examination
 at 8:11 pm that day.  Some provincial government departments were having
 meetings that day, so the leadership made special arrangements and sat the
 examination before they began their own meetings.  Without-the attention
 of.the party committees at various levels and support from leading com-
 rades, it would not have been possible for the examination to draw so many
 cadres and achieve such good results.
 The examination is our trial project for setting up a system for cadres'
 official theoretical study, and there were a number of shortcomings to
 this work due to the lack of experience.  We will continue to spare no
 efforts and in the process of studying the documents of the 12th party
 congress, we will gradually set up and perfect the cadres' study and
 examination system so as to promote cadres' theoretical study in our

 IN STUDYING THE 12TH PARTY CONGRESS WE MUST GET FIRMLY TO GRIPS WITH ITS
 BASIC SPIRIT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 p 47
 [Article by Li Ping [3810 1627]; reprinted from Sichuan's XUEXI [STUDY]
 magazine, No 4, 1982]
 [Text]  In the report delivered by the CPC Central Committee to the Central
 Propaganda Department entitled "Arranging the Study and Dissemination of the
 Documents of the 12th National Congress of the CPC," it was stated that in
 his opening speech to the 12th national congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
 gave an overall clarification of the historical position of the 12th
 national congress, the tasks of the congress and the essence of the docu-
 ments of the 12th national congress.  All levels of the party committee
 should use this opening speech as their guiding ideology and get fully to
 grips with studying and disseminating of the documents of the 12th national
 congress and studiously organize their implementation.  This general guid-
 ing ideology provided by the Central Committee points us in an extremely
 clear direction in our organization of the study and dissemination of the
 party's 12th national congress documents.
 The party's 12th national congress documents represent shining examples of
 Marxist literature, rich and profound in content and crystallizing the
 assimilation of historical experience. and the collective knowledge of the
 party.  In his opening speech, Deng Xiaoping stressed that "our modernized
 construction must be carried out with China's present actual situation in
 mind," "to construct socialism of a Chinese nature," "and we must rely on
 the strength of the Chinese people in order to carry out our work," "and
 cherish our rights of independence and initiative which we have struggled
 so long to gain.  No foreign country may ever try and make China their
 vassal, nor should they imagine that China shall eat any bitter fruit
 which would damage the national interests of our country."  While stressing
 his support for China's open door policy he went on to say that we must
 "continue to resist the corruption resulting from decadent foreign ideology
 and on no account should we permit the spreading of bourgeois life styles in
 China."  We must gain a profound comprehension of the essence of this speech
 and diligently propagate it, to stimulate an enormous increase in patriotic
 fervor throughout the party and the masses.  In his opening speech, after
 clarifying the three major tasks of the people during the 1980's, Deng

 Xiaoping listed the four items of work which must, as of today, be tackled
 immediately by the entire party for a long time to come; namely, to carry
 out restructuring of mechanization and of the economic system:  implement
 revolutionarism, youthfulness, increased knowledge and expertise amongst
 cadre groups; establish a socialist spiritual civilization; crack down on
 and break up antisocialist corruption and crime in the economic and other
 sectors; on the basis of thorough study of the new party constitution
 reorganize party style and organization.  These are the most important
 guarantees of our support for the socialist direction and the joining
 together of our forces to carry out modernized construction.  The general
 outline of the basic essence of the 12th national congress documents also
 states that it is under the guidance of communist ideology that we support
 the socialist direction and join together our force to carry out modernized
 construction and get firmly to grips with the four major items of work.  The
 full documents and all the activities of the 12th national congress com-
 pletely embody this point and in our study and dissemination of the docu-
 ments of the 12th national congress it is vital that we fully grasp its
 fundamental essence.

 RAISE THE COMMUNIST SPIRIT, STUDY WELL THE 12TH PARTY CONGRESS DOCUMENTS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 pp 47-48
 [Commentator's article by XIN CHANGZHENG-from Jilin's XIN CHANGZHENG [NEW
 LONG MARCH] No 9, 1982]
 [Text] An utterance, an article and a meeting are all very refreshing
 things.   The most refreshing thing about the 12th national congress may be
 summed up in one word--communism.  Communist targets, communist practice
 and communist ideology were interwoven through the documents and decisions
 of the 12th national congress like a red ribbon.  Thus, when we study the
 12th national congress we must bring out this communist spirit.  In other
 words we must stand on the high level of communism to understand and
 comprehend the essential spirit of the documents'of the 12th national con-
 gress and get to grips with the fundamental direction of every policy and
 task outlined and decided upon in the 12th national congress.
 Comrade Hu Yaobang made it very clear in his report when he said:  "In
 order for communism to achieve full realization as a social system in
 China we. still face several generations of long and arduous struggle.  But
 communism is first and foremost a movement-and the final aim of a movement
 such as this is to achieve a communist social system."  Thus we must inte-
 grate closely our present practice with our future aims and take the 12th
 national congress as the correct road for establishing a new phase in the
 socialist modernization program and integrate it and its policies closely
 with our long-term ideal of achieving communism.  We must both keep this in
 mind and adhere to it.  Since the establishment of the PRC, the problems
 that we have come up against during the course of our socialist construc-
 tion work have many different causes behind them but we can in essence say
 that they were all the result of insufficient or inept handling of just
 this relation.  Thus, during the stage of socialism we must support and
 believe in guidance by communist ideology and improve and strengthen the
 teaching of communist ideology without hesitation or faltering.  Further-
 more, under guidance by communist ideology we must draw up policies and
 plans based on our present situation and then fully support and endorse
 their implementation.  In other words, we should not separate communism
 and socialism either on a theoretical or a practical basis, nor should we
 oppose them to one another.  Furthermore we should not confuse socialism
 and communism in their developed stages nor equate the two of them on this

 level.  Only in this way can we keep our feet on solid ground but have a
 clear view into the long-term future.  And only in this way can we ensure
 that the communist movement progresses along correct lines and with healthy
 development from the beginning to the very end.
 An'important lesson that we have learned in the past is that sometimes our
 understanding of socialist society becomes'very one-sided and biased.
 History has proven to us that'vacuous politics, setting up "spiritual
 omnipotence" or aiming for similar extremes and thereby ignoring and
 weakening political and ideological work, thus seeing only material factors
 and ignoring the human ones, only tends to obstruct the progression of our
 cause and can even create serious damage.  Thus it was that Comrade Hu
 Yaobang pointed out in his report, that socialism is constantly moving
 nearer its high level target of communism and this progression cannot only
 rely on increases in material wealth, it must also rely-on the constant
 elevation of the people's communist ideological consciousness and the
 constant activation of the revolutionary spirit.  If under the guidance
 of communist ideology we ignore the great task of establishing a socialist
 spiritual civilization throughout society then it is impossible to guarantee
 a socialist direction for our modernized construction program and thus our
 socialist society will lose its ideals and its aims as well as its spiritual
 force and fighting will with the result that we will be unable to resist
 corruption by all kinds of degenerate factors and we may even end up seeing
 lopsided development and the appearance of decadence and evil ways.

 THE INTELLECTUALS ARE A FORCE ON WHICH THE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM DEPENDS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 p 48
 [Article by Zhang De [4545 1795]--reprinted from Jiangsu's QUNZHONG [THE
 MASSES] No 19, 1982]
 [Text]   In order to fully get to grips with such vital tactical points for
 the development of the economy as education and science, to allow full
 expression to intellectuals during the process of constructing the two
 kinds of civilization, and to struggle for the realization of our tactical
 aims, the following items of work must constantly appear on the agendas of
 every level of party and government bodies.
 1.  While studying and disseminating the spirit of the documents of the
 12th national congress we.must remember to study and promote the policy
 toward intellectuals.  In this way the entire party and the masses will
 come to understand and appreciate that the key to realizing the four
 modernizations program lies in the modernization of science and technology
 while the foundations lie in establishing a sound education.
 2.  We must continue to implement the party's policy on intellectuals.
 This includes rectifying leftover problems of cases of injustice, carrying
 out communist ideological education among intellectuals, study by intel-
 lectuals of their tasks and duties and gradual improvements in the working
 and living conditions of intellectuals, based on feasibility and necessity.
 3.  Draw up 5 to 10 year plans and clear targets for such cultural under-
 takings as education, science, culture, hygiene and physical education on
 the basis of overall balance.
 4.  Take care to develop and foster activists amongst intellectuals, par-
 ticularly middle-aged intellectuals, to develop party members and thus
 strengthen the party ranks.  Furthermore we should take care to select
 cadres from amongst the intellectuals to enrich every level of the leader-
 ship bodies and thus improve the intellectual structure of party and
 government bodies as well as leading cadres in enterprise and work units.
 People generally dislike it when confused orders are issued but cold and
 objective analysis shows us that the issuing of confused and wrong orders
 by leading bodies and cadres cannot always entirely be traced back to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 intentions and morals of the individual leaders; more importantly, such
 events are the result of two objectively existing factors.  One is that
 they have the power to issue orders.  The other is that they lack the
 necessary intellectual knowledge for their area of leadership.  Let us use
 a formula to explain this:  power plus lack of knowledge equals the issuirig
 of confused and incorrect orders.  Production needs unified leadership and
 leadership needs authority.  Authority thus requires that someone submits
 to the authority since authority can only exist under the premise of having
 someone to submit to it.  In order to avoid the issuing of confused or
 incorrect orders the leadership bodies should be made up of people "in the
 know."  Leading cadres must be "in the know" and an important condition
 for being in the know is that one has the specialized knowledge to carry
 out one's own work.
 5.  We must make use of all methods acceptable to intellectuals to con-
 stantly urge them to consciously raise their political consciousness and
 to consciously make use of new knowledge to enrich themselves.  Further-
 more they should consciously make use of the principles of socialism to
 correctly handle all kinds of relations including the relations between
 the individual and the collective, the intellectual, the worker and the
 peasant, and the internal relations between old, middle-aged and young
 intellectuals and the relations between work responsibility and glory,
 and treatment.

 RANDOM TALKS ON PROFESSIONAL,ETHICS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 22, 16 Nov 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Lin Wenshan [2651 2429 1472]]
 [Text]  As everyone strives to promote.the establishment of a spiritual
 civilization, joyous reports,of good deeds have been pouring in.  Two
 such reports, concerning scientists, can be seen in the YANGCHENG WANBAO.
 One is:  Comrade Xiong Jincheng and Comrade Zhou Zuoling'were both sepa-
 rately engaged in research but arrived at the same results.  In assessing
 his "honor of being first" to arrive at the results, Comrade Xiong Jincheng,
 who was first to publish his thesis, openly stated that the honor of being
 first to arrive at the results should go to Comrade Zhou Zuoling, who pub-
 lished his thesis later.  Seeking truth. from facts, Comrade Xiong Jincheng
 stated that he only entered this field of work after being introduced into
 it by Comrade Zhou Zuoling.  Although Zhou Zuoling's thesis was published
 only later, it was actually sent off 3 months earlier.  As a result it was
 Comrade Zhou Zuoling who received the research results award.  Another is:
 Researcher Lou Tongmao, head of the geomorphology department of the
 Guangzhou Geographical Research Institute, put all of his major efforts
 into supporting the work done by his middle-aged and young researchers.
 The amount. of work that Comrade Lou Tongmao put into many theses from
 their inception to the final draft was frequently no less than that of the
 actual writer.  When people put his name at the front, he always crossed it
 out.  Under such motivation as his, unity and cooperation became the order
 of the day throughout the entire department and as a result, last year they
 made three relatively important scientific achievements, publishing 15
 scientific articles.
 Of course we are not by any means advocating avoidance of publicity.  When
 listing references and acknowledgements in a scientific thesis or publica-
 tion, apart from stating whose work the publication involved, it should
 also state the name of the person in charge and responsible for the line
 of thinking or the material behind the work.  But, let us be honest here,
 as far as some intellectuals are concerned, acknowledgements do have a
 great deal of attraction.  Comrade Xiong Jincheng and what he did are both
 worthy of respect for he need only have stayed silent and "the honor of
 being first" would of course have been his.  But he stood up and spoke the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 truth.  For Comrade Lou Tongmao to put his name in the acknowledgements
 would have been both reasonable and legal.  But he did not agree with doing
 things this way.  Using himself he fully embodied the spirit of the so-
 called "human ladder or chain" thereby encouraging his followers to aim
 for equally lofty realms.  Both of the comrades are not only educated but
 truly ethical.
 It is said that in theatrical troupes in the old society there was a saying,
 "backbiting art" meaning that between the performers there was often
 jealousy, struggle for fame and jockeying for position.  There was obvious
 backbiting and covert backbiting--backbiting on and off stage.  Obviously
 all this backbiting gave rise to a great deal of lost energy and a lowering
 of the artistic effect of performances.  This terrible phenomenon of "back-
 biting" did not of course only exist amongst theatrical troupes, it was
 also to be found in scientific and various other fields.  Such people,
 fearing that the achievements of others would surpass their own would do
 everything in their power, using all their authority and connections to
 stifle the opposition and even going to the extent of confounding the
 achievements of others.  Untalented and uneducated people would use all
 sorts of means such as plagiarizing and lifting of work in order to take
 the credit for something.  Often the theory would be someone else's, the
 writing anther's, and yet those who had authority would put their names
 on the work, even at the head of the work.  Some people even went so far
 as to satirize and joke about the true contributors and writers of a piece
 of work by claiming to be "above material and worldly pursuits."
 Under the influence of such a lack of professional ethics, being adept in
 the,"study of contacts and string-pulling" allowed people to enjoy juggling
 things so that they could profit without working, gaining both fame and
 wealth, while those who really spent their time working hard on various
 pieces of work found their lives beset with problems and lived in perpetual
 terror.  Today, enterprises and work places have all expressed the need to
 lay down a code of professional ethics, and from what we have discussed it
 is obviously very necessary.  Around 100 of China's greatest scientists
 and experts in technology including Mao Yisheng and Zhou Peiyuan have
 drawn up a "code of professional ethics in science for workers in science
 and technology," and this publication includes one criterion for profes-
 sional ethics as follows:  Support creative invention and encourage others
 to do better than oneself.  Such an aspect of professional ethics is a
 very, good thing and embodies the country's and the people's future expecta-
 tions of workers in science and technology as well as giving voice to all
 the demands of true and correct scientific workers in China.
 Science seeks to establish the truth from facts and without this central
 aim, what contributions can science make?  Liang Qichao wrote a book
 called "Science in the Qing Dynasty" and it is very well worth reading,
 both for natural and social scientists.  In addition to discussing scien-
 tific research during the Qing dynasty it also discusses the scientific
 mood and professional ethics of that time and there are a few lines which
 are still relevant to us today.  For example:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR0001 00420001 -1
 Everyone considers it immoral to hide or twist facts and proof.
 Whoever speaks must prove his words-plagiarization is a greater immorality.
 In terms of this question, overbearing manner, incoherent writing or those
 insinuating ridicule are also immoral.
 If we take these few lines and with them examine the situation in science
 and technology over the last few years we can see that for a variety of
 reasons this Qing dynasty scientist's methods of evaluating immorality are
 still to some extent pertinent to some of our scientific books.  Thus we
 must resolve'this situation if we wish to see further development to our
 science and technology.
 After the ideological confusion caused by the 10 years of social chaos we
 must now work hard to make respect of professional ethics common practice.
 This means that every line of work and research must draw up individual
 codes of professional ethics and praise good people and good deeds while
 criticizing bad people and bad deeds.  In this way the domain of ideology
 will once again take up a forward position.  Let us hope that from today
 we receive more and more reports of good deeds and that we hear no more of
 cases of people in power signing their names to work with which they had
 nothing to do.
