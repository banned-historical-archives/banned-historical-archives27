 LEBANON
 Syria took its first steps this week to
 carry out the cease-fire provisions en-
 dorsed at last month's Arab summit in
 Cairo. Syrian army units, in their role as
 the principal component of the enlarged
 Arab League peacekeeping force, moved
 on November 10 into the Christian and
 Muslim suburbs of Beirut and took up
 positions near the airport and in the hills
 overlooking the Christian port of Juniyah.
 The Syrian moves secured their control
 over the main north and south access
 routes to the capital.
 The Syrians are expected to enter west
 Beirut soon and to begin to fan out from
 the capital to open up the Sidon-Beirut
 and Beirut-Tripoli roads. Earlier in the
 week, Syrian forces gained control over
 some key road junctions in the central
 mountains, occupying positions near the
 leftist stronghold of Alayli on the main
 Tripoli
 Beirut-Damascus highway and within the
 much fought over Christian villages of
 Mutayn and Anyturah.
 Both Christian and Muslim militias
 have complied with orders from their
 leaders to pull back in the face of the
 Syrian advance, but are stockpiling their
 heavy weapons to avoid confiscation.
 Palestinian guerrillas and Lebanese lef-
 tists are reportedly also stockpiling their
 heavy weapons.
 None of the combatants is prepared to
 give up their weapons voluntarily. They
 do not trust each other or the Syrians and
 are afraid that they would weaken their
 bargaining position by handing over their
 weapons before negotiations over
 Lebanon's future have even begun.
 The Syrians thus face the prospect of
 having at some point to disarm these
 groups by force or of policing an armed
 truce that could deteriorate again and
 jeopardize Syrian efforts to restore
 political stability. For the present, the
 Syrians are likely to move cautiously,
 hoping first to limit these groups' access
 to outside sources of resupply. In that
 way, Damascus probably hopes to disarm
 these groups one at a time, eliminating
 some of them, thereby leaving the
 Lebanese little choice but to seek a
 political solution.

 P
 President Sadat discusses new cabinet with Prime Minister Salim (c) and Vice President Mubarak
 President Sadat and Prime Minister
 Salim announced a cabinet shuffle on
 November 9 following receipt of
 parliamentary election returns giving the
 pro-government slate a large majority.
 The cabinet reorganization may help to
 strengthen the management of Egypt's
 shaky economy;  no  significant  port-
 folios outside the economic sector were
 affected.
 Final returns in the parliamentary elec-
 tion-held initially on October 28 with a
 runoff on November 4-give the
 pro-government organization within the
 Arab Socialist Union 280 of the 342
 elected  People's Assembly  seats.
 Members of the Arab Socialist Union's
 leftist organization  took  only two
 seats; candidates of the rightist organ-
 ization won 12. Independents running
 outside the sponsorship of any Socialist
 Union group won 48 seats.
 Probably a sizable number of the in-
 dependents will take an opposition stance.
 No serious challenge to government
 policies is expected from the new
 Assembly, but it may not be as easy to
 manipulate as were its predecessors.
 The new cabinet will bring prominent
 economist Abdul Munim Qaysuni to the
 newly created post of deputy prime
 minister for financial and economic af-
 fairs-a portfolio that will give him
 overall supervision of the large number of
 ministries dealing with economic matters.
 These have previously reported directly to
 Salim,  who has  no, economic back-
 ground and little feel for Egypt's eco-
 nomic needs.
 Qaysuni-who originally formulated
 the economic liberalization policy that
 Sadat instituted a few years ago-will re-
 tain the chairmanship of two banks and
 may thus not have adequate time to watch
 over the economy. On the other hand, the
 two key economic ministries have gone to
 Qaysuni proteges, and this may help
 assure more centralized and competent
 direction of economic affairs without his
 direct oversight.
 Qaysuni has a long-standing reputation
 as a capable economist and may be able to
 attract  back  into government service
 some of the reputable Egyptian
 economists who have left over the years.
 IRAQ-USSR  J Z 16
 The Iraqi air force exfects to receive
 some MIG-25 Foxbat aircraft from the
 USSR, according to           the US
 interests section in Ba hdad.
 decided not to purchase Mirage intercep-
 tors from France. A deal for about 50
 Mirages had been under discussion for
 more than a year
 buying high-performance aircraft from a
 Western supplier at this time might upset
 its relationship with the USSR. Iraq
 reportedly is also concerned that France
 may prove an unreliable supplier in time
 of crisis, such as another Arab-Israeli
 war.
 The Soviets have not yet exported the
 MIG-25, and Egypt is the only country
 outside the Warsaw Pact in which Fox-
 bats have been based. Several Foxbat
 reconnaissance aircraft were temporarily
 sent to Egypt in 1970 and again during the
 Middle East war in 1973, but they were
 flown only by Soviet pilots and remained
 under Soviet control.
 The USSR has not given Iraq

 everything it wants in types and quantities
 of military hardware, but the Soviets have
 demonstrated the high priority they place
 on relations with Iraq by supplying
 military equipment that had not previous-
 ly been exported.
 Iraq was the first country to receive the
 TU-22 medium bomber and the Osa 11
 guided-missile boat. Iraq also has more
 MIG-23 Floggers than any country out-
 side the Warsaw Pact. The Iraqi govern-
 ment evidently hopes that, because the re-
 cent defection of a Soviet pilot with his
 MIG-25 to Japan has given the West
 detailed information about the plane's
 capabilities, the USSR will now be even
 more forthcoming toward Iraq.
 If Iraq does receive the MIG-25, it
 would be many months before the country
 would have sufficient personnel adequate-
 ly trained to fly and maintain the aircraft.
 We have no reports that such training is
 under way. Even after the Iraqis are train-
 ed, a Soviet contingent would probably be
 necessary to help operate and main-
 tain  the  Foxbats.
 CHINA-USSR  36 -5 2"
 China marked the 59th anniversary of
 the Russian  Revolution in a routine
 fashion this week with a restrained
 message of congratulations-the first
 public message to the Soviets since Chair-
 man Mao's death-and low-level protocol
 appearances at official functions in Pek-
 ing, Moscow, and at Soviet embassies
 abroad.
 The message broke no new ground,
 stating the Chinese people's support for
 "defending the path" of the October
 Revolution and, as in the past, asserting
 that differences of principle should not
 stand in the way of normal state relations.
 IRAQ        ~_-, /U
 Kurdish guerrilla activity in northern
 Iraq appears to be increasing somewhat
 as winter sets in-a time when govern-
 ment troops are at a disadvantage in the
 rough terrain. The rebels' main area of
 operations has now expanded from
 western Iraq to the mountainous territory
 near the Iranian border, scene of the
 heaviest fighting during the full-scale Kur-
 dish rebellion two years ago.
 The present, limited Kurdish insurgen-
 cy is not the work of the followers of
 Mulla Mustafa Barzani, who fled to Iran
 after the collapse of their rebellion in
 March 1975 and who are apparently still
 held in check by the Shah. The guerrillas
 now active are members of leftist Jalal
 Talabani's Kurdisian National Union,
 which is based in the border area of
 northeastern Syria.
 The upsurge in activity by the Talabani
 Kurds over the past few months suggests
 that Syria may have encouraged them in
 retaliation for Iraq's military buildup
 along the Syrian border last June.
 The note did not, however, repeat last
 year's call for settling the long-standing
 border dispute between the two countries,
 a sign that China is in no mood to take up
 this complicated question, at least for the
 time being.
 Peking's top diplomat in Moscow sat
 through the Kremlin's annual reception
 for the first time in several years, ap-
 parently because Politburo member
 Kulakov's comments on Sino-Soviet
 relations did not contain the sharply
 worded criticism of China that had
 prompted Chinese walkouts in the past.
 Vice Foreign Minister Yu Chan, who
 again this year was China's highest rank-
 ing guest at the Soviet embassy ceremony
 in Peking, reportedly stayed longer than
 usual for a "sharp exchange" with Soviet
 Ambassador Tolstikov. The Soviet
 diplomat told US officials later that Yu
 Any strengthening of Kurdish guerrilla
 capability will to a great extent depend on
 whether the Syrians decide to increase
 their support to the estimated 3,500 Iraqi
 Kurds based in Syria.
 Iraqi strongman Saddam Husayn is
 treating the resurgence of rebel activity as
 a politically sensitive matter. The
 Baghdad press has not acknowledged
 either the rash of rebel attacks against
 military and police forces since June or
 earlier Kurdish-instigated sabotage
 operations in Iraqi oil fields.
 Baghdad probably recognizes that its
 recent policy of resettling Kurds in areas
 remote from their tribal homelands has
 created recruits for the Kurdish guerrilla
 organizations. Tribesmen dispersed to the
 south-an  estimated  50,000-are
 reportedly neither adjusting to the
 warmer climate nor being accepted by
 their Arab neighbors. Saddam Husayn
 implicitly acknowledged the failure of the
 resettlement policy by abruptly ending it
 last July, but by then large segments of
 the Kurdish population had been an-
 tagonized.
 had reiterated standard Chinese positions
 on Sino-Soviet relations and implied that
 Moscow does not anticipate any early
 change in Peking's policies toward the
 Soviet Union.
 Soviet commentary on China at an-
 niversary celebrations in Moscow was in
 keeping with the ostensibly conciliatory
 stance the Soviets have adopted since
 Mao's death. In his Kremlin speech,
 Kulakov reiterated Moscow's desire for
 the restoration of good neighborly
 relations in line with "the principles of
 proletarian internationalism." In his dis-
 cussion of Soviet relations with other
 communist countries, he gave China a
 higher precedence than it has had in re-
 cent years. On the anniversary itself,
 Defense Minister Ustinov did not mention
 China at all; last year Grechko did.

 NAMIBIA  2 5- 2 9
 Some sensitive political Tissues that
 Prime Minister Vorster has previously
 avoided may be brought to a head soon at
 the multiracial Namibian constitutional
 conference, which began one of its
 periodic plenary sessions this week in
 Windhoek, the territorial capital.
 The session will consider a resolution,
 adopted by the conference's constitutional
 committee two weeks ago, calling for
 creation of a multiracial interim govern-
 ment within a few months to manage the

 transfer of functions from the existing
 territorial administration to an indepen-
 dent Namibian government. A target date
 for independence of December 31, 1978,
 was proposed by the constitutional com-
 mittee last August.
 Both the proposal for a target date and
 the call for an early interim government
 were intended to gloss over disagreements
 among the 11 delegations to the con-
 ference; the delegations represent the
 whites and the 10 nonwhite ethnic groups
 inhabiting the territory.
 The white group and Pretoria apparent-
 ly want Namibian independence under a
 loose federal system that would enable the
 whites to maintain control of Namibia's
 mineral resources even though they com-
 pose only 12 percent of the population.
 Most of the nonwhite delegations, on the
 other hand, want a central government
 responsive to the nonwhite majority to
 have ultimate control of the territory's
 natural resources.
 The nonwhite delegates are unlikely to
 accept any interim arrangements that
 tend to perpetuate the existing ethnic
 homelands without making a start toward
 setting up a strong central government.
 Vorster has said that his government
 will consider favorably any draft constitu-
 tion or interim recommendation that is
 adopted by a plenary session of the con-
 ference. He may be so anxious to avert a
 collapse of the conference that he will go
 further toward accommodating the non-
 whites than he previously intended. So
 far, however, he has not clearly backed
 the lone moderate member of the white
 delegation, who has served as mediator
 between his hard-line colleagues and the
 nonwhite delegates.
 ANGOLA   2 g-2
 Angolan President Agostinho Neto is
 assuming the functions of prime minister,
 thereby becoming head of government as
 well as chief of state and party leader of
 the Popular Movement. This announce-
 ment was included in a lengthy statement
 President Agostinho Neto and party chief Breznnev exchange
 Soviet-Angolan documents following signing in October
 issued after a recently concluded central
 committee plenary session. No new posi-
 tion has been announced for former prime
 minister Nascimento.
 The statement also sets forth a broad-
 ranging program for Angola's political
 and economic development that carries a
 strong Marxist thrust, calling for goals to
 be pursued in the context of "scientific
 socialism." This follows Neto's signature
 in  Moscow  last  month  of  a
 Soviet-Angolan "friendship treaty" and a
 party-to-party agreement.
 The new program and Neto's enhanced
 status may have constituted a package put
 together to accommodate factional
 differences within the Popular Movement.
 Some elements of the program differ con-
 siderably from policies that Neto earlier
 espoused.
 Heretofore, Neto has been identified
 with efforts to broaden Angola's
 economic and political ties with the West
 and to follow a policy of nonalignment.
 The statement includes references to such
 policies, but places heavy stress on
 Angola's special relations with the USSR
 and Cuba.
 In the economic sector, the new
 program calls for strong state control over
 the economy through nationalization and
 centralized planning. Provision is made
 for a private sector, but it is to be sub-
 jected to strict controls. Until now, the
 Angolan government has appeared anx-
 ious to maintain Angola's access to
 Western markets and technology.
 The Popular Movement is charged with
 a major role in mobilizing popular sup-
 port for the regime. It will have direct
 authority over all mass organizations and
 will assume the functions of the informa-
 tion ministry, which is to be abolished. It
 is possible that other changes in the struc-
 ture of the government may be in the of-
 fing. Rumors to this effect have been cir-
 culating in Luanda since Neto returned
 from Moscow.
 The central committee also approved a
 five-year plan for reorganizing and up-
 grading the country's armed forces. This
 will undoubtedly be carried out under
 Soviet  and  Cuban  direction.

 USSR-YUGOSLAVIA
 Yugoslav President Tito and Soviet
 party leader Brezhnev will probably seek
 to stabilize further the often mercurial
 relationship between their countries when
 they meet in Yugoslavia on November 15,
 16, and 17.
 The task will not be easy, primarily
 because of ideological differences and a
 deep-seated  mutual distrust.  The
 Yugoslav press, for example, is now
 trumpeting Belgrade's independent course
 in world affairs and its espousal of
 polycentrism in the communist move-
 ment. Moscow, on the other hand, wants
 the Yugoslavs to help advance the idea of
 a "socialist community" by more openly
 and consistently supporting Soviet goals.
 A Soviet diplomat in Belgrade recently
 admitted that one of Brezhnev's tasks will
 be to try to get Yugoslavia to mute its
 polemics against the USSR. Comments
 from members of the local diplomatic
 community  suggest  that  the
 USSR-Yugoslavia's  largest trading
 partner-will offer economic incentives
 for increased Yugoslav cooperation. Dur-
 ing Brezhnev's 1971 visit, he offered a
 $540 million development credit, but only
 a little of it has so far been used. Belgrade
 is not likely to make fundamental changes
 in its independent foreign policy, nor do
 the Soviets expect any.
 Yugoslavs have expressed their concern
 that the 84-year-old President has grown
 increasingly susceptible to Brezhnev's ca-
 jolery. They fear he may grant the Soviets
 greater  access  to  Yugoslavia's  naval
 facilities on the Adriatic.
 The last bilateral visit between the two
 leaders took place three years ago in Kiev.
 Since then, relations were soured by
 Yugoslav  apprehensions about Soviet
 support  for   Yugoslav  subversives.
 Although trials of the major pro-Soviet
 "Cominformists" ended last July, the
 Yugoslavs will press Brezhnev to reaffirm
 public Soviet promises of noninterference
 in Belgrade's internal affairs. Brezhnev
 will make this gesture, but the Yugoslavs,
 in light of their past experience, will take
 these assurances with a grain of salt.

 Soviet party leader Brezhnev has given
 his personal endorsement to visiting
 Polish party chief Gierek, who is leading a
 party-state delegation on an official
 week-long visit to the USSR. Gierek is
 seeking a public show of Moscow's
 political and economic support at a time
 when his regime is being severely tested at
 home.
 In a Kremlin speech on November 9,
 Brezhnev referred to Gierek as the "true
 son of People's Poland," an "eminent
 statesman" of the international com-
 munist movement and a great friend of
 the Soviet Union. He endorsed Gierek's
 policy of "radical modernization of all
 Polish industry" and implied that
 Moscow would give some additional help.
 Brezhnev  expressed  confidence  that
 despite "tricky problems" Warsaw would
 successfully implement its programs.
 Gierek emphasized Poland's close and
 growing cooperation with the USSR and
 Poland's contributions to the strength of
 the socialist community. The official talks
 were concluded on November 10 with the
 signing of a joint declaration on coopera-
 tion.                          25X1
 No details have been released yet on
 what the Soviets are prepared to do to

 Polish diplomat had indicated earlier that
 "significant" economic agreements would
 be signed, and a Soviet diplomat in War-
 saw had asserted that the Poles will get 90
 percent of what they want. These
 agreements were probably hammered out
 during a visit to Moscow by Prim'
 Minister Jaroszewicz on October 22

 Andean Pact: Chile Withdraws
 Chile's withdrawal from the Andean
 Pact on October 30 will open new
 economic opportunities but at the cost of
 losing some privileges it enjoyed under the
 pact with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador,
 Peru, and Venezuela.
 Unfettered by Pact restrictions, Chile is
 now free to reduce tariffs and to court
 direct foreign investment on any terms it
 can get. Chile wants foreign capital and
 cheaper imports to increase economic
 growth and to help reduce inflation. As a
 price of withdrawal, Chile forfeits future
 exclusive manufacturing rights for supply-
 ing the member countries under the Pact's
 petrochemical and light engineering
 programs.
 A joint Andean Pact - Chilean com-
 mittee has been established to oversee
 Chilean cooperation with the Pact in
 production,  trade,  finance,  and
 technology. Chile has agreed to imple-
 ment the planned Andean road transpor-
 tation system and to honor Pact policies
 promoting local multinational enter-
 prises. Chile's access to loans from the
 Andean Development Corporation will
 not be affected.
 Chile believes its economic and political
 interests can better be served by associa-
 tion with the River Plate Basin coun-
 tries-Argentina,  Bolivia,  Brazil,
 Paraguay, and Uruguay. Over the past
 three years, Chile's trade with these
 nations has been twice that of its trade
 with the Andean Pact countries, excluding
 Bolivia, a member of both groups. Chile
 has already accepted observer status in
 the  River  Plate  Basin  Group.

 GREECE-TURKEY
 Talks between Greece and Turkey over
 control of the Aegean continental shelf
 and airspace have so far been moving
 smoothly. The negotiators are still skir-
 ting the most important aspects of both
 controversies, however, and the Greeks,
 who feel buoyed by the US election
 results, may now be more inclined to stall
 on the most important issues.
 In the continental shelf talks, which
 began in Bern on November 2, the two
 sides are moving toward an agreement to
 establish a committee of experts to for-
 mulate procedures for substantive
 negotiations. According to a Greek
 Foreign Ministry official, this agreement
 will be referred to the Greek and Turkish
 foreign ministers for approval, probably
 when they meet at the NATO minis-
 terial meetings next month. The ex-
 perts  would  commence  their  work
 thereafter.
 The airspace talks that are going on
 simultaneously in Paris have produced an
 agreement to establish a hot line between
 the Greek and Turkish air defense centers.
 Each side has also agreed to provide the
 other with schedules of its military exer-
 cises in the Aegean six months in advance.
 The negotiators have yet to agree,
 however, on terms for the advance
 notification  of  military  flights  over
 the Aegean. This has been the main block
 to a settlement in previous consul-
 tations.
 The Greeks, who only reluctantly
 agreed earlier this fall to direct
 negotiations on the continental shelf dis-
 pute, seem to believe that the new US ad-
 ministration will be more responsive to
 the Greek position on the Aegean and also
 on Cyprus. They may therefore be more
 inclined than before to resist Turkish
 demands, or at least to stall on the sub-
 stantive questions.
 ALBANIA
 4~ (~, (; y
 Hoxha delivered a marathon 14-hour
 speech-spaced out over two days-that
 vigorously defended his leadership.
 Appealing to the strong sense of
 nationalism inherent in the Albanians,
 Hoxha proudly boasted that Albania's
 isolation protected the country from "the
 invasion of enslaving credits, tourists and
 spies, and decadent culture and
 degeneration." These assertions did not
 keep him from declaring Albania's inten-
 tion to pursue economic and commercial
 ties with the West.
 Acknowledging the strong role played
 by China in assisting Albania's economic
 development,  Hoxha was nonetheless
 somewhat reserved, and his remarks
 probably reflected his uncertainty about
 recent developments in Peking.
 Hoxha's comments on foreign policy
 included the predictable denunciation of
 everything the USSR stands for and
 enthusiastic praise for progress in
 Albanian-French relations. His remarks
 on the Balkan countries broke no new
 ground, and his continuing, adamant con-
 demnation of the nonaligned movement
 will not sit well with China, which has
 been urging Albania to adopt a more ac-
 Party leader Enver Hoxha last week set
 a firm course of continued isolation and
 self-reliance at the Albanian Communist
 Party's seventh congress. The country's
 serious economic problems, however, ap-
 parently dictated several personnel shifts
 and a note of cautious pragmatism re-
 garding foreign economic contacts.
 At the national level, the leadership of
 Hoxha and Premier Mehinet Shehu
 appears as entrenched as ever, and the size
 of the Politburo remains at 12 full
 members. The number of candidate
 members on the ruling body was expand-
 ed to five and includes two new faces.
 The new candidate Politburo members
 are Lenka Cuko and Simon Stefani. They
 typify the sort of young party leaders with
 technical backgrounds and proven ad-
 ministrative ability on the district level
 that Hoxha has advanced in recent years.
 Stefani has a strong economic
 background. Additions to the Central
 Committee  include  the  new
 ministers-such as education and
 agriculture-who figured prominently in
 Hoxha's apparent efforts in recent years
 to rejuvenate the Albanian party
 hierarchy.

 China's new leaders are pragmatic men, keenly aware of
 the importance of foreign trade and technology to the country's
 modernization program. Long-standing economic problems,
 which had been entangled in political struggles for years, may
 now be more susceptible to solution.
 The shakeup of China's top policy
 makers last month greatly increases the
 chance of early moves to solve long-
 standing economic problems.
 Should Chairman Hua Kuo-feng
 relinquish his post as Premier, as is likely,
 Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien is the most
 logical replacement. Li, a long-time
 specialist in economic affairs, is
 pragmatic and politically astute much in
 the mold of the late Chou En-lai.
 The ouster of China's most prominent
 leftists leaves moderates like Li with more
 China: Economic Policy
 power than they have had in over a decade
 and removes a major obstacle to solving
 economic problems that had become inex-
 tricably entangled in the political struggle.
 Legacy of 1960s
 The wholesale purge of veteran ad-
 ministrators during the cultural revolu-
 tion from 1966 to 1968 created such
 animosity and so fractured the Chinese
 leadership that consensus on economic
 policy became all but impossible. Peking
 has since been faced with a growing list of
 unresolved economic problems: structural
 imbalances in industry, bottlenecks in
 transport, lagging labor productivity, and
 slow  agricultural growth.  Some
 problems-notably in agriculture-were
 addressed in the fourth five-year plan
 (1971-1975), but most were dealt with in a
 temporizing fashion.
 In early 1975, Chou En-lai-in his last
 major address-announced a 25-year
 program aimed at the modernization of
 agriculture, industry, national defense,
 and science and technology. As Chou's
 health deteriorated, the task of overseeing
 this program fell to Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping,  who  had just  been
 rehabilitated after being a victim of the
 cultural revolution.
 The program ran afoul of leftist attacks
 on Teng, however. By April 1976, the lef-
 tists had succeeded in banishing Teng
 from all positions of authority; Hua
 Kuo-feng took over as China's chief ad-
 ministrator. Meanwhile, the fragile con-
 sensus of early 1975 disintegrated, and
 drafting of a new fifth five-year plan
 (1976-1980) was postponed.
 Apart from firming up the five-year
 plan, the two items of immediate concern
 to the new Hua regime are the role foreign
 trade is to play in China's economic
 development and the extent to which
 greater material incentives are needed.
 There also are decisions on the revitaliza-
 tion of scientific and technical education
 and research and the degree of centraliza-
 tion in planning and management.

 New Dynamism
 With the moderate faction now domi-
 nant, we expect a more dynamic foreign
 trade policy, emphasizing imports of
 whole plants and high-technology items.
 Whether this policy will be pursued as ac-
 tively as in the early 1970s remains to be
 seen.
 Opposition to greater foreign trade has
 not come from leftists alone. For exam-
 ple, coal shortages have led to complaints
 from some ministerial and provincial
 authorities that exports of crude oil have
 been excessive and responsible in part for
 the poor overall showing of the economy
 in recent years. Since problems with the
 coal industry are expected to persist, the
 level of oil exports will continue to be a
 point of contention, even within the new
 leadership.
 Despite this controversy, China will
 probably again have to push oil exports.
 Foreign Trade Minister Li Chiang, in
 mid-October talks with Italian trade of-
 ficials,  reportedly  acknowledged  that
 "China certainly needs technology"; he
 went on to say that, although China's raw
 materials will increasingly be required for
 domestic industry, "there will also always
 be a certain share available for foreign
 buyers." While these statements stop
 short of a freewheeling trade policy based
 on oil exports, they point to a return to
 more liberal trade practices.
 The next few months should also bring
 a greater stress on material incentives, in-
 cluding the prospect of a wage increase
 for the urban work force. After more than
 a decade of stagnating money incomes,
 China's urban workers have in recent
 years shown a growing dissatisfaction
 with wages. Serious discontent surfaced in
 1974, when worker absenteeism and slow-
 downs were widespread, and has con-
 tinued in less dramatic forms in 1975 and
 1976 at some cost to economic growth.
 Peking's divided leadership initially
 promised action on wage reform; later,
 under pressure from the leftists, the
 leaders backtracked and denounced
 material incentives as "bourgeois."
 The inability of the leadership to deal
 with grievances over eroding living stan-
 Posters in Peking rolling stock plant call on workers to
 increase production in memory of Mao Tse-tung.
 dards has been the source of widespread
 worker ill feeling toward the four ousted
 leftists. The unprecedented jubilation dis-
 played  in the mass  demonstrations
 celebrating Hua's appointment and
 denouncing the leftists partly reflects a
 belief that the new leadership will address
 the economic condition of urban workers.
 Whatever wage relief is forthcoming, it
 probably will be small. A large general
 wage increase would require a bigger
 reduction in investment than the
 moderates would be willing to accept.
 Even a small wage increase, however,
 should greatly improve worker morale
 and increase productivity.
 Other Possible Reforms
 The new leadership is keenly aware of
 the importance of scientific and technical
 work to China's modernization. The
 moderates view most policy in education
 and research since the cultural revolution
 as impeding progress and believe that
 more traditional institutions will better
 serve China's needs.
 The moderates are likely to attempt to
 return leadership positions in science and
 technology to qualified scientists and
 engineers, reducing the party's role to that
 of providing general policy guidance. All
 leadership factions advocate "self-
 reliance," but the moderates assert that
 leftist education changes are destroying
 the country's ability to develop the human
 capital that can make China
 technologically independent.
 Reforms in planning and management
 most likely will deal with inadequate plan-

 ping at the local levels, excessive party in-

 The moderates will have to proceed
 with care; many of the cultural revolution
 innovations are popular. Extending cen-

 on the power of local authorities and

 economic recovery. They seem to be moving toward the adop-
 tion of measures to stimulate the economy.
 D
 Japan probably will soon adopt mildly
 stimulative economic measures as con-
 cern increases over the slowdown in
 economic recovery.
 Recent industrial production figures
 show output down in September for the
 second straight month; the decline almost
 certainly continued in October as well.
 Consumer spending has been lackluster
 in recent months. Business investment has
 not rebounded despite measures taken
 earlier this year to increase investment by
 the electric power industry.
 Government  spending  has  slowed
 because of serious  delays in imple-
 menting              rate        increases for govern-
 ment monopolies, as well as delays in
 passing legislation that would allow
 the government to borrow needed funds.
 Consumer prices are rising faster than
 the government had anticipated. Prices
 were up nearly 10 percent in September
 and October over 1975 levels. Upward
 pressures will continue because of hikes in
 public utility rates and railway fares, as
 well as increases in import prices, par-
 ticularly for oil. Inflation on an annual
 basis probably will continue at roughly 10

 percent through early 1977; the govern-
 ment had hoped to keep it to 8 percent by
 next March.
 Japan's  Ministry of International
 Trade and Industry recently proposed a
 reflationary package that would provide
 loans to increase housing starts by 50,000
 units and new funds for business in the
 form of low-interest loans from govern-
 ment financial institutions.
 The ministry also is encouraging the
 government to promote capital spending
 by the oil and electric power industries, to
 lower long-term interest rates, and to
 assure a continued boom in whole plant
 exports. Because of concern over worsen-
 ing inflation, the ministry did not propose
 increased public works spending, normal-
 ly Japan's most effective pump-priming
 tool.
 Prospects for Next Year
 Without some new stimulative moves,
 Japanese economic growth could fall
 short of Tokyo's 5.6-percent target for the
 year ending in March 1977. Most
 economists in and out of the Japanese
 government agree, however, that growth
 for the 1977 calendar year will be higher
 than it was this year.
 Corporate profits reportedly increased
 30  to  40  percent  in  the  April-
 to-September period over the previous
 six-month period, making a strong
 recovery in investment likely for the next
 year. Inventory accumulation and delayed
 government spending also should resume
 in the next few months.
 Over the past several years, Japanese
 industrial production has followed US in-
 dustrial production trends because of
 close trade and financial ties between the
 two countries. If Japan views the US
 economic slowdown as only temporary,
 the council is even more likely to adopt
 only cautious reflationary measures.
 The general election, which probably
 will be scheduled for December 5, adds a
 sense of urgency to the economic

 Independence may come to the last European colony in
 Africa by the middle of next year. The prospect has already
 heightened the conflict in interests and ambitions between
 neighboring Ethiopia and Somalia.
 French Territory of the Afars and Issas
 France is moving ahead with plans to
 sponsor next spring a referendum on in-
 dependence in the French Territory of the
 Afars and Issas. This would be followed
 by the drafting of a constitution and the
 election of a new government. A transfer
 of power could take place as early as
 mid-1977.
 There is little room for optimism that
 the transition will be peaceful or that the
 independence of the FTAI can be main-
 tained, especially if France decides to
 withdraw its military forces from the
 territory.
 At first glance it appears France has
 made some progress in the past few
 months in reconciling antagonistic
 political forces and ethnic groups in the
 FTAI. A widely held sense of nationalism
 that would contribute to stability when
 the territory becomes independent has not
 developed, however. Somalia has not
 abandoned its historic goal of annexing
 the FTAI, and Ethiopia remains deter-
 mined to prevent a Somali takeover.
 Somalia and Ethiopia are meddling in
 territorial affairs and could upset French
 efforts to arrange a peaceful transfer of
 power.
 France's primary concern is that the
 new government of the territory be
 recognized and guaranteed by the states in
 the region-at least long enough for
 France to avoid blame for any conflict
 that might arise.
 The French government now seems op-
 timistic that the situation will be stable
 enough to allow it to retain a military
 presence of some sort in the territory for a
 while after independence. Officials have
 told US embassy officers in Paris,
 however, that they are not yet certain
 what military arrangements they will be
 able to make.
 Neither the French nor the territory's
 new government would be likely to press
 for a large military force. The local
 government would not want to com-
 promise its independence, and the French

 defense. They especially want to avoid
 any activity that would risk substantial
 French casualties.
 The French appear to be making plans
 against the possibility of losing their naval
 base at Djibouti-the most important one
 they now have in the Indian Ocean. For
 example, they recently transferred a
 maintenance and supply ship from their
 Atlantic fleet to the Indian Ocean fleet.
 The ship would augment facilities at the
 French island of La Reunion if the
 Djibouti base is closed.
 The Territorial Government
 Abdallah Mohamed Kamil, who
 became head of the government in FTAI
 last July with French connivance, is
 attempting to rally the territory's conten-
 tious political and ethnic groups behind
 his regime. Kamil is appealing for support
 from both his fellow Afars and their
 traditional enemies-the territory's ethnic
 Somalis, the bulk of whom are Issas.
 Kamil's efforts toward ethnic recon-
 ciliation are in accord with an agreement
 providing for greater political representa-
 tion of ethnic Somalis reached last June
 between France and the FTAI's three
 major political groups: The African
 People's Independence League, the
 National Independence Union, and a bloc
 of unaffiliated parliamentary deputies
 who support the present government.
 France sponsored the agreement in the
 belief that a government reflecting the ac-
 tual composition of the population would
 be better able to resist Somalia's efforts to
 annex the territory.
 Ethnic Somalis constitute a majority of
 the population, but restrictive nationality
 laws and the rigging of elections have per-
 mitted the Afars-the long-time French
 surrogates-to dominate local politics.
 The agreement called for the creation of a .
 national unity government and for en-
 franchising additional ethnic Somalis, vir-
 tually assuring their dominance after in-
 dependence.
 Kamil, 39, was a high-level civil servant
 before being hand-picked by the French to
 lead the government. Kamil's policies
 appear to be pro-Western. His political
 savvy and ability to balance the contend-
 ing forces of the territory's factional
 politics have yet to be tested.
 Kamil has said little about his inten-
 tions. In his public statements, he fre-
 quently gives the impression that his
 government intends to hold power only
 until independence is achieved. On the key
 question of whether an independent FTAI
 will conclude military agreements with
 France, Kamil has said that the decision
 will have to be made by the post-
 independencegovernment.
 In recent public statements, Kamil has
 gone out of his way to accuse Ethiopia of
 meddling in FTAI affairs. At the same
 time, he has tried to assure Addis Ababa
 that an independent FTAI will not block
 Ethiopian access to the port or railhead at
 Djibouti, a vital Ethiopian interest.
 The Ethiopians, who supported Ali
 Aref, the leader of the National
 Independence Union, when he was in of-
 fice and had hoped to work in tandem
 with  France to protect the FTAI's
 SECRET
 territorial integrity against Somalia, have
 sharply criticized Paris' recent moves.
 They share Aref's belief that French
 policy-either deliberately or because of
 misguided assumptions-is playing into
 the hands of Somalia.
 The Ethiopians believe that the Paris
 accords, and France's support for the
 Kamil government, are at best based on
 the false hope that Somalia will support
 the FTAI's integrity if the Issas are given
 greater  political  representation.
 Ethiopia's suspicions have not been ended
 by French assurances that Paris is
 attempting to establish a strong govern-
 ment that will protect Ethiopia's interest
 in the territory.
 League Influence
 The African People's Independence
 League has been the chief beneficiary of
 recent political developments in the
 FTAI.  The broadening of the Issa
 franchise will give it even more political
 power. The League is better organized
 than the other political groups in the
 territory; it will probably control the first
 independent government.
 League leader Hassan Gouled, an Issa,
 is thus widely regarded as having the best
 chance to head the first post-independence
 government. He is personally committed
 to independence, but he has moved closer
 of late to Somalia and the militant Front
 for the Liberation of the Somali Coast, a
 Somali-puppet organization.
 Gouled says he has sought Somali sup-
 port-Somalia has supplied the League
 with money-only as a means to secure
 the territory's independence, and he
 professes to believe the Somali President's
 assertion that he will support that in-
 dependence.
 Somalia Watching
 Somali President Siad has apparently
 concluded that the recent developments in
 the FTAI have enhanced the chances of a
 pro-Somali government coming to power
 legally. Over the next few months,
 Somalia will probably continue to support
 the trends now under way in the territory.
 It is unlikely to risk initiating terrorism or
 guerrilla activity until it has a clearer no-
 tion of French intentions.

 Siad has been very successful in draw-

 Somalia. With Somali encouragement,

 banded together as the "United Front,"
 the purpose of which is to confront France

 Since the ouster of Ali Aref, with whom
 Ethiopia closely collaborated, Addis
 Ababa has seemed resigned to the
 likelihood of conflict with Somalia over
 the FTAI. The ruling council has been
 trying to prepare the public for this even-
 tuality  by  frequent reminders of
 traditional Ethiopian-Somali antipathy.
 Ethiopia recently has attempted to im-
 prove its military capability in border
 areas. It has equipped armored units there
 with new M-60 tanks and moved in new
 units.
 Ethiopia's military, however, has been
 weakened by the continuing guerrilla war
 in Eritrea and other provinces. Morale
 and discipline have declined steadily and
 many of the units along the Somali and
 FTAI borders are understrength. Ethio-
 pian forces in those areas number about
 6,000 men.
 Ethiopia has sought to enlist Moscow's
 aid to restrain Somalia from moving into
 the FTAI. The hope for such support is
 one reason Ethiopia has attempted to
 strengthen ties with Moscow and solicit
 Soviet military aid.
 The Ethiopians say they have received
 some assurances from the Soviets, but
 they consider them "less than satisfac-
 tory." In fact, the Soviets' overriding in-
 terest in protecting their heavy political
 and military investment in Somalia allows
 them little room for accommodating such
 Ethiopian overtures.
 Ethiopia rejects the idea, fostered by
 France, that key Arab countries can be
 relied on to restrain the irredentist policies
 of Somalia, an Arab League member.
 Ethiopia is aware that most Arab
 governments  support  the  Eritrean
 separatists. Addis Ababa is not likely to
 cooperate even with those Arab countries,
 like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, that are
 anxious to keep the FTAI out of the
 Somali orbit in order to prevent what they
 believe would be an inevitable expansion
 of Soviet influence in the area.
 open a consulate in Djibouti in order to
 provide a means for funneling support to
 "moderate" groups. Saudi Arabia is
 reluctant to commit itself to giving major
 financial  assistance in the future,
 however, because it believes France
 should bear the major burden of sup-
 porting an independent FTAI.
 Saudi Arabia would probably find it
 difficult  to  influence  political
 developments in the territory. For the
 Saudis to wean the major political groups
 away from Somalia probably would take
 more money than the Saudis are willing to
 spend and a greater sophistication about
 FTAI politics than the Saudis possess.
 It is doubtful that Saudi efforts to
 strengthen FTAI nationalists, even if
 applied with maximum effectiveness,
 would be able significantly to influence
 events in the area during the next year or
 so. Somalia, because of the subversive and
 guerrilla capabilities at its disposal, will
 probably be able to manipulate events to
 its advantage.

 A Warsaw Pact summit meeting scheduled for late this
 month in Romania will give the USSR an opportunity to
 reassert the "unity" of its views with those of its East European
 allies.
 S
 Warsaw Pact: Summit Meeting This Month
 The Warsaw Pact nations have sched-
 uled                  a political summit  meeting  in
 Bucharest for late November. This will be
 the first meeting of the Pact's Political
 Consultative Committee-which con-
 venes at the party-leader level-since
 April 1974 and the first held in Romania
 in more than a decade.
 Moscow has for some time been
 trumpeting the virtues of the Pact's
 political arm as an instrument of East
 European political unity and cohesion.
 'The Soviets have tried to use the Political
 Consultative Committee as a mechanism
 to secure formal, multilateral endorse-
 ment of Soviet foreign policy views. In
 effect, the Soviets use the Warsaw Pact to
 provide a facade of legitimacy for both
 Soviet political and military dominance in
 Eastern Europe.
 Within the Pact, the Political Con-
 sultative Committee is the leading formal
 body for political coordination and
 overall direction of the alliance. The
 irregularity of its infrequent meetings
 reveals, however, that it is not the pri-
 mary vehicle for political consultation
 among the Pact members.
 Although the Committee is supposed to
 meet semiannually, it has met only 14
 times in the 21 years of its existence. The
 formal nature of its sessions, the require-
 ment for unanimity, and the often conten-
 tious nature of the issues under review
 have all contributed to the Committee's
 reduced role. Meetings of the Pact's
 foreign ministers have been convened only
 7 times since 1966.
 The Soviets have had to resort to other
 forums as substitutes for meetings of the
 Political Consultative Committee. These
 have included bilateral meetings between
 party leaders of individual states and ad
 hoc meetings outside of the Warsaw
 Pact's formal structure to coordinate
 foreign policy.
 Formal high-level consultation within
 the Warsaw Pact has been much less in-
 tense than in the period before the Euro-
 pean Security Conference last year.
 Before Helsinki, the gatherings of foreign
 ministers, party first secretaries, and the
 Committee itself were devoted largely to
 the general subject of the security con-
 ference. Specific differences did crop up
 during these discussions, but the Soviets
 managed to avoid substantial dishar-
 mony.
 There are signs, however, that in the
 aftermath of the European communist
 party conference in East Berlin last June,
 Moscow wishes to reaffirm its control
 over the other members of the Pact. The
 USSR gave greater weight last summer
 than in former years to the bilateral
 meetings usually held in the Crimea
 between  Soviet  General  Secretary
 Brezhnev and East European leaders.
 This year was the first time since 1973
 that all the Warsaw Pact party leaders
 showed up for separate talks with the
 Soviet leader.
 Preparing for Belgrade Meeting
 With the European security and com-
 munist conferences now behind them, the
 Soviet leaders are concerned with
 preparations for the meeting in Belgrade
 next year to discuss implementation of the
 security conference principles. The special
 emphasis recently given to the role played
 by the Political Consultative Committee
 in European security matters suggests
 that Moscow has obtained broad agree-
 ment from the other Pact members to the
 guidelines it wants adopted in Bucharest.
 Differences exist among the East Euro-
 peans on the pace of East European
 compliance  with  some  provisions  of
 the security conference's final document.
 All indications suggest, however, that the
 East European party chiefs share a com-
 mon interest with Moscow in avoiding
 recriminations at Belgrade and blunting
 Western criticism of their lack of progress
 in implementing the conference prin-
 ciples.
 Committee meetings normally rotate
 from capital to capital, and it presumably
 is Romania's turn to serve as host.
 Nevertheless, the Romanian willingness
 to be host at the summit meeting is just
 the display of fraternal solidarity the
 USSR wishes to foster. The meeting will
 enable Soviet leaders to demonstrate to
 the West that, despite some differences
 between Moscow and Bucharest over the
 nature of interparty relations, they can
 agree on the broad questions relating to
 European security matters.

 Coordinating foreign policy within the
 formal political machinery of the Warsaw
 Pact has frequently been a vexing chore
 for the Soviets. On the meeting in
 Yugoslavia next year, however, the in-
 terests of the East European Pact
 members broadly coincide with those of
 the Soviet Union. Party leaders will
 probably hammer out a joint statement
 defending their claim to have fulfilled the
 Helsinki accords.
 Romania's willingness to serve as host
 for the Political Consultative Committee
 meeting fits in with the generally con-
 ciliatory  attitude that  Bucharest has
 recently adopted toward the Soviets.
 President Ceausescu will probably use this
 gesture in an effort to convince the USSR
 that he is seriously committed to easing
 bilateral tensions.
 Bucharest has resisted Moscow's effort
 to gain greater Romanian participation in
 the Pact. Since the early 1960s Romania
 has permitted joint Pact maneuvers on its
 soil only once-in 1962-and has taken
 only a token role in staff and map exer-
 cises, usually within a Balkan context.
 Ceausescu probably sought Soviet
 assurances that the Political Consultative
 Committee agenda would not include con-
 troversial topics and that Moscow would
 not seek to use this forum to discuss
 Romania's limited participation in the
 Pact.
 Soviet Purposes
 Moscow may believe that the Bucharest
 meeting will be an appropriate forum in
 which to make a conciliatory appeal to
 the new Chinese leadership. Soviet leaders
 would welcome an opportunity to show
 that they can enlist the support of their
 European allies under the aegis of the
 Warsaw Pact in party matters as well.
 There are some signs that the USSR
 might try to revive its proposal for
 strengthening the Pact's political con-
 sultative machinery. Moscow wants to set
 up a permanent secretariat-similar to
 NATO's political organization-headed
 by a Soviet secretary general.
 This idea was most recently re-
 jected-reportedly because of Romanian
 objections-during a meeting of Warsaw
 Pact foreign ministers in Moscow in
 December 1975. Bucharest has always
 been wary of Moscow's effort to establish
 a permanent supranational Pact
 mechanism that would speak for Pact
 members, and it is not likely to alter its
 long-standing objections.
 Bucharest may now, however, be more
 willing to seek a compromise on the issue.
 A Romanian party secretary has in-
 formed US officials that the summit
 meeting will consider earlier Romanian
 proposals such as the establishment of a
 periodic consultative mechanism at the
 foreign minister level. This may be an
 attempt to sidestep a broader Soviet
 proposal. The Romanian added that the
 Political Consultative Committee meeting
 fits in with Bucharest's desire to
 emphasize the political-rather than
 military-aspects  of the  Pact.
