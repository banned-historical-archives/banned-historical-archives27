 DCI REMARKS TO PFIAB
 13 January 1982
 - Familiar surroundings - familiar faces
 - We look forward to doing important constructive work together
 - PFIAB has a distinguished record and tradition in prompting and
 supporting the CIA in photographic reconnaissance and communications
 intelligence where Bill Baker and Johnny Foster were towers of strength, in
 extending its work from largely military matters to currencies and fuels
 and minerals where Leo Cherne and John Connally played a leading role, and in
 resisting restrictions which Ed Williams pronounced unconstitutional.  I remember
 more than one shootout in the Cabinet Room between Ed and Justice Department
 officials.
 Your outside experience can similarly help us appreciate the evolution
 of events and needs in today's world and how intelligence should adjust to
 accommodate to these needs.
 - In December, Admiral Inman and I presented to the NSC a 6-month study
 which the Intelligence Community did on the challenges we see during 1985-90
 and the emerging technologies available and the capabilities and resources
 needed to meet those challenges.  I will  touch on these capabilities as I go along.
 - Great deal to be done - challenges intensify - rebuilding job long-tern one
 - The Intelligence Community lost 40% of its funding* and 50% of its people**
 between 1968 and 1980***.
 The Board can help validate large capital requirements to modernize an
 increasingly obsolete worldwide communications system and to erect a new building
 *In constant dollars--real purchasing power.
 **Attributed mostly to closing of large SIGI14T bases overseas.

 - You can endorse and encourage legislation to make it a crime to disclose

 of the time of our experienced operational people is consumed in seeing that
 we don't let out information which would endanger our people or damage cur sources
 in response to Freedom of Information queries.  Worse still, we don't know how
 much friendly intelligence services hold back for fear that our expos4re to
 the Freedom of Information Act will compromise them., Nor do we know hovi many
 agents have left us or won't have anything to do with us because they won't
 risk their lives and reputations with an intelligence service whose adversaries
 have a legal right to poke into its files.  We do know that no other intelligence
 service in the world operates under this kind of a handicap.  The only other

 their intelligence services.  That's what we're asking for.
 - Feel pretty good about the first year.  Not battering from Congress and
 media but denial of resources, hesitation to make use of capabilities and
 imposition of restrictions which had dampened spirits.  Recognition that new
 Administration intended to use the Intelligence Community and support it with
 renewed resources quickly lifted spirits and morale.

 The Reagan Executive Order, while fully preserving the requirement to
 meet the requirements of the Constitution and all the laws, carried a positive
 mandate.  What was most important, it permitted us to reduce the operating
 guidelines which officers around the world need to consult from 130 pages of
 legalisms to 30 pages of reasonably clear instructions.  When you consider that

 strongly that all our human collection can be improved substantially. if the
 Freedom of Information Act is removed as a deterent for both agents and liaison
 services to work with us.
 So we are now getting and can expect an increasing flood of facts.
 These are only as good as our ability to cross-check and verify them, weave
 them into a mosaic and understand their meaning.  That's the task of our
 analytical apparatus.
 For over a quarter of a century this analytical. apparatus had been.
 .organized along functional lines.. When I found-it, divisions for strategic
 analysis, for political analysis, for economic analysis, for geographic and
 societal analysis and for science and weapons.  We have converted this to a
 geographic organization.  Problems and crises almost always come up on a national
 or regional--basis.-  State and Defense, NSC and our own operational directorate
 are organized on a geographic basis.  Under a functional organization, a new
 problem would have to be attacked in separate duchies in its military, economic,
 political and technical aspects.  The normal thing would be.for specialists in

 each duchy to have a go at it, form their conclusions, and get then approved
 at the top.   Then the interdisciplinary evaluation would be thrashed out,
 coordinated and negotiated by busy office directors.  These are analysts who
 turned administrators, overburdened, pressed for time and too frequently grown
 thin on substance.  Under the new organization, working analysts attack the
 problem in a multi-disciplinary manner from the beginning.  When it is worked
 out, the analysis is approved in one chain of command.  Political, economic
 and military analysts are sharing information on a constant basis.  We already
 find this bringing more effective and coherent analysis, more speedily done,
 and saving large amounts of coordinating time.  We expect it to enable us to
 restore some analysts turned administrators back into analysts.
 The logic of this organization has been recognized before.  It's an enormous
 task and no one was willing to tackle it until we switched John McMahon from
 chief of the operational directorate to chief of the intelligence directorate.
 He analyzed where and how the work was done in great detail and bit the bullet.
 His reward has been appointment as Executive Director.  One of the problems with
 CIA is that it has tended to be four separate duchies, the Operations Directorate,
 the Analytical Directorate, the Science and Technology Directorate, and the
 Directorate of Administration rather than one integrated organization..  McMahon
 has a track record, unique in CIA history, for. being a strong and versatile...
 manager running the clandestine service, reorganizing the analytical service,
 developing or running technical collection capabilities in both the photographic
 and signals area.  As Executive Director, his mission is to make the directorates
 more cohesive and mutually supportive.-
 Reorganizing the analytical apparatus provides a fresh opportunity to
 improve both the quality of analysis and its relevance to decisionmaking.

 for the Soviet Union and as a member of the NSC Staff under Scowcroft,
 Kissinger and Brzezinski, has become chief of the analytical apparatus which
 is no longer called NFAC, for National Foreign Assessment Center.  That was a
 little pretentious and created the appearance and perhaps a sense of being some-
 thing apart-and separate from CIA.  So Bob Gates is DDI, chief of the Directorate
 of Intelligence as it's always been called except for the last few years.
 More important, Bob is full of fresh, bold and innovative ideas for improving
 the quality and relevance of our analysis of the Niagara of-facts that come
 pouring in from the cameras and recording capabilities and the stations we have
 around the world.  Bob moved, in his first week on the job, to establish that in'
 the future all present and prospective division chiefs will have at least one
 year of experience in a non-intelligence consumer of intelligence products
 (State, Defense, NSC or other).  Each analyst will be required to refresh his
 substantive knowledge and perspective through regular outside training.  All
 DDI research programs are to be re-evaluated.  All analysts will be evaluated
 and promoted on the quality of their work, and each piece of work will be
 considered in terms of its relevance, timeliness, quality in writing and presen-
 tation, innovativeness and imagination, and above all its accuracy.  These evalu-
 ations, accompanied by comment by the head of the unit, will be kept in a career-long
 production file for each analyst.  To assure input and challenge from outside,
 each office will be required to develop an aggressive program of contacts,
 conferences, and seminars on important subjects.  A roster of outside contacts
 and consultants on each country or general subject area who will be asked
 :-regularly to review drafts and provide critical commentary.
 In this business, intelligence estimates are the bottom line.  The
 highest-duty of a Director of Central Intelligence is to produce solid and
 roved For Release 20(099Z6R
 Approved For Release 2006/09/20: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102700002-4
 perceptive national intelligence estimates relevant to the issues with which
 the President and the National Security Council need to concern themselves.
 When General Bedell Smith took office as Director of Central Intelligence,
 he was told that President Truman was leaving in 20 hours to consult with
 General MacArthur at Wake Island and, that he would want intelligence estimates
 on seven issues to study on the plane.  Smith assembled the chiefs of the
 intelligence community in the Pentagon at 4 p.m., divided them and their
 staffs into seven groups, told them they would work all night and have their
 assigned estimate ready for delivery at 8 a.m.  President Truman had. his
 estimates as he took -off for his discussions with General MacArthur.
 We haven't yet attained that tempo--but we get them out a lot faster
 than previously.  First thing I did was ask what Cuba is up to.  I was told
 an estimate was in process.  When it carr;e it was weak and short on Soviet
 support and influence.  I sent it back.. All in all, it took something
 like four months to get it out.  When I looked into it, I found that the___
 first draft of that estimate was done in June of 1980, almost a year earlier.
 It was better than the 6 or 7 drafts that followed_  This first draft did
 predict a now aggressiveness from Cuba.  This perception was diluted and
 toned down in the subsequent drafts.  Earlier there was a draft on Nicaragua
 which predicted what happened there, but never got out at all.  This work was
 available at a time when those developments certainly should have been
 carefully considered.  Sadly, these perceptions were strangled in the clearance
 and coordinating process so that in the case of Nicaragua they never reached
 policymakers in a-national estimate and' in Cuba they were delayed while Cuba's
 new aggressiveness .inflamed Central America and would have reached polic}rakers
 in diluted form if the final draft had been approved.  Estimates don't linger
 around any more.  We established an accelerated time table for producing an
 TOP SECRq
 Approved For Release 2006/09/20: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102700002-4
 estimate which gets factual input from all elements of the community and
 bringing it to the table at the National Foreign Intelligence Board as within
 a couple of weeks and faster if necessary.  At this table the chiefs of each
 element of the Intelligence Community--DIA, NSA, CIA, the military services,
 FBI, Energy, Treasury--sit as a board of estimates.  Everyone can and does
 speak up with the assurance that it is my responsibility to both frame those
 estimates and reflect significantly different views that may exist in the
 intelligence community.  Thus we have done away with conclusions by consensus
 and negotiation.  Policymakers get a full range of credible and substantiated
 conclusions.
 During the.summer we produced comprehensive estimates which became the
 basis for comprehensive policy initiatives on the threat to Central America,
 Soviet Potential to Respond to U.S. Strategic Force Improvements, the Persian
 Gulf, the Middle East, and the China-Taiwan problem.  Ile broke new ground with
 first time estimates on technology transfer, the decline of the Soviet economy
 and the dependence of the Soviet military on western trade and technology.
 You have alist of key estimates issued during our firstyear and the
 conclusions of our' Senior Review Panel after a detailed study of the
 relationship between-Nation al Intelligence Estimates and policy issues
 addressed by the NSC during 1979 and 1980 and those issued in 1981.  (Appendix A)
 What do these estimates tell us about where we stand in the world and
 the threats we face?  They lay out a sobering if not frightening picture
 of Soviet capability and forward movement on a broad, but ominously inter-
 related, variety of fronts.
 Strategic - within a couple of years of being able to knock out our land
 based missiles.  (We estimate they could now destroy 80%--in a few years 90_)

 -Superior conventional forces and intermediate range missiles on the central
 .front in Europe.
 Ability to project power as first seen in moving tanks and other heavy weapons
 to link up with Cubans in Angola and Ethiopia and currently reflected in ready
 airborne divisions, in plans and exercises to run through Iran very quickly
 and tanks and other mobile weapons prepositioned in Yemen, Libya and possibly
 Syria.
 Military Assistance is a more subtle but nevertheless effective Soviet tool for
 creating Third World dependency.  Two years ago we sold twice as much arms
 to the Third World as the Soviets.  Today.they offer better terms and delivery
 to sell 50% more than we do.  Their provision of a growing preponderance of
 military advisors is both cause and effect of this.
 Propaganda - we have had difficulty in getting attention to yello?:r rain in
 Indo-China and Afghanistan, to the rapid pace which SS-20s targeted at Europe
 are being installed and to Soviet and Soviet proxy supply of weapons and training
 of insurgents in Central America.  At the same time, the Soviets have had success
 in proclaiming their peaceful intentions and denouncing us in mass demonstrations
 against U.S. weapons in Europe and against our assistance to legitimate governments
 in Central America.  The Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty
 are being shaken out of their long lethargy to tell the truth about real issues
 but they need more and better facilities to overcome Soviet jamming and do an
 adequate job of offsetting a far stronger Soviet effort.  CIA special activities
 are providing an increasing effective response to Soviet propaganda.
 Subversion and Insurgency - while we've put the great bulk of our effort into fol-
 lowing the Soviet military threat, over the last six to seven years we've been more
 "Approved For Release 2006/09/2
 severely damaged by destabilization and economic aggression.  Events have
 demonstrated that we could not safely renounce assistance to our friends
 against subversion by our adversaries.  In the aftermath of Vietnam, the Soviet
 Union soon began to test whether the U.S. would resist foreign-provoked and
 supported instability and insurgence elsewhere in the Third World.  Fully
 aware of the political climate in this country, in the mid-1970s they developed
 an aggressive strategy in the Third World.  It avoided direct confrontation
 with the U.S. and instead exploited local and regional circumstances to take
 maximum advantage of third-country forces (or surrogates) to attain Soviet
 objectives.  This enabled Moscow to deny involvement, to label all such conflicts
 as internal, and to warn self-righteously against "outside interference."  There
 is little disagreement among our analysts that Soviet and proxy successes in the
 mid- to late 1970s in Angola, Ethiopia, Cambodia, South Yemen, Nicaragua, and
 elsewhere have encouraged the Soviets to work with the Cubans, Vietnamese and,
 .recently, the Libyans ever more aggressively to threaten new targets, notably
 in Africa, Central America and the Middle East.
 Our capability to provide clandestine paramilitary support, which functioned
 well in the Iranian hostage crisis, would have disappeared with a few more
 capability and a program to rebuild and to cooperate with the Pentagon in a
 common effort to maintain paramilitary and anti-terrorist capabilities, with
 CIA handling the clandestine aspect and the military the overt aspect.- We've
 done an estimate identifying stability factors in countries where actual or
 potential instability is a matter of concern and rating them according-to
 the degree of this threat.  To keep a continuing watch on this and to develop
 assessments and evaluate strategy to deal with these threats, a Center for
 Instability, Insurgency and Terrorism is being established in the DDI.

 The Technological Race
 The Soviets have a far-flung effort, far beyond ours, to perfect missile
 defense, develop laser and directed energy weapons, anti-satellite weapons,
 permanent space stations and anti-missile defense.  They have well over a
 hundred new systems in development, much of it based on our technology.
 One of the first things I did was call for an evaluation of what the
 Soviets had gained in acquiring technology from the West.  The facts accumulated
 in such alarming proportions that we established a Technology Transfer Center
 around mid-year.  By early October we had established that the increasing
 sophistication, accuracy, power, impenetrability and countermeasure capability
 of Soviet weapons, against which we must defend ourselves, was based on our
 own expenditures in research and development to .a far greater degree than we
 had ever dreamed.  We established that the Soviets were conducting a--massive
 far-flung and well organized effort to get technology from the Hest through
 trade, theft, illegal purchase, espionage, scientific exchanges and study
 programs                                        Ithe Soviets had 15 years ago
 started to hire and train about. 100 young scientists a year.  This now has
 produced an organization of about a thousand experts who identify Soviet
 technology needs, target where they might be acquired in the hest and roan
 the world to search out details and samples of targeted Western technology.
 This has been enormously successful.  The Soviets have had a huge free ride
 on our R&D military and our civilian technology.  We have paid for much of
 the vastly increased military threat which will now require us to increase
 our military spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the years
 immediately ahead.
 vex  For Release 2869: CIA-RDP84BOOd49RO01102700002-4
 There is the constant threat of a breakthrough which could tip the
 strategic balance against us, particularly in laser and directed energy and
 in space systems where massive programs are under way.  We have identified
 some 40 design bureaus and research centers working on lasers and directed
 energy.  From photography of their space facilities we know that during the
 mid-80s there will be a huge increase in their space launchings aimed at
 establishing permanent manned stations in space.  Recently they began to
 encrypt their communications to men in space.  All this is ominous in
 indicating possible military use of space.
 Warning
 To meet the challenge of Soviet weapon development, we need additional
 technical capabilities which will take years to develop.  In the meantime,
 to prevent technological surprise we must count on extending our huan
 intelligence.
 To maintain adequate warning capability and attack verification, we
 will also need new technical capabilities.  These are specified in the future
 capabilities study which I described earlier.  Meanwhile, we are upgrading
 our warning machinery.  In the early days of CIA, much of the intelligence
 operation was built around..a weekly watch report.. This has disappeared..
 Over the last few years, there has been only a monthly warning Meeting of
 officers at a relatively low level.  We have returned to a weekly indications
 and warning meeting conducted by the top officials of the CIA's Intelligence
 Directorate, NSA, DIA, and State.  They will be charged with reevaluating
 each trouble spot and producing a watch report for the President, Secretary
 of State, Secretary of Defense, and the President's National Security Advisor
 at the end of each week.  We are presenting next week to the National Foreign
 Approved For Release 2006/09/20: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102700002-4
 Intelligence Board the report of a working group on warning which will be
 the basis for improvements in the warning process and which I believe can
 result in a more effective networking of the warning capabilities of the various
 elements of the Intelligence Community, a more aggressive and persistent search
 for warning indicators, a more frequent and systematic challenging of previous
 judgments, and improved and automatic intelligence input to crisis management.
 Counterintelligence
 Finally, we are taking a broad new look at how we can develop more
 adequate protection against the intensified espionage, disinformation and
 terrorist activities conducted, more or less in concert, by the intelligence
 services of the Soviets, Cubans, East Germans, Libyans, and their other proxies
 and partners in crime, including a large number of terrorist organizations.
 The working relationship between FBI and CIA, as Judge Webster said this week:
 in a letter to the Post, is close and fully cooperative.  Still, the challenge
 is a large and growing one and a counterintelligence subcommittee chaired by
 Senator Chafee has shown great interest.in how we_can meet_it_better._We.have
 organized and have started-to pursue an evaluation of the counterintelligence
 challenges and capabilities required during the balance of the decade, paralleling-
 the capability study completed this year on intelligence challenges and c:,,c.Silities._
 So, you see there is a lot going on, on which we will welcome your assistance

 NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES (1981)
 ivuu in relevance, tempo and quality.  They reported that in 1979-80 there
 was substantially less use of the Community and a dearth of interagency
 estimates directly pointed to critical policy issues in the manner followed
 since the late spring of this year under revised NIC procedures.      Timeliness
 of intelligence advice and rapidity of response time has much improved in 1981.
 Design of analysis/estimates--in content shaped more closely to specific policy
 problems and in forms more useful to policymakers--has also been significantly
 enhanced.                                 o
 Finally, in 1979-80, there was substantial evidence of capacity for
 pertinent anticipatory analysis going unused because of insufficient linkage
 between the policy and the intelligence communities.  Some of these cases
 later developed into major policy issues involving instability in Eastern
 Europe, the Middle East, and Central America.  Our impression is that, in
 1981, performance in converting perceptive basic studies in NFAC into effective
 inputs for policymakers has been materially improved.
