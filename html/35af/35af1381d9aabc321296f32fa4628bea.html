 Western countries that can be of help.
 The Sino-Soviet relationship has evolved in recent years into a broad
 range of economic, trade, and scientific contacts, although the
 Chinese continue to avoid party-to-party ties. The Soviets have good
 reason to be pleased because the progress to date has been made
 without any Soviet give on China's "three obstacles" to normalized
 relations. Moscow hopes that a normalization of relations will bring
 improvements in the political/strategic dimensions of the relation-
 ship but recognizes that China will be an adversary for a long time
 to come. In the short term, the interest that both sides have in
 building their domestic economies leads them to seek to reduce the
 military tensions between them, to put their relationship on a more
 sound economic footing, and, at the same time, to reach out to

 The Soviets seem to be taking a more subtle approach toward
 China-becoming a bit less heavyhanded in their direct dealings
 with Beijing, while maneuvering within a number of triangular
 relationships, including the Sino-Soviet-US strategic triangle, to
 apply pressure on the Chinese to move their relationship forward.
 Most of Gorbachev's top experts on China apparently still believe
 they can work around Beijing's three obstacles to a significant
 improvement in bilateral relations-Afghanistan, Cambodia, and
 the Soviet military buildup along China's northern border-and
 need not make any major concessions on those points. The Chinese
 have become increasingly outspoken in expressing their irritation
 with Gorbachev's inflexibility on those issues, but they also have
 demonstrated that they are determined to keep Sino-Soviet tensions
 within manageable limits. They want to have as much breathing
 space as possible to pursue their economic reforms and to leave open
 the possibility of a breakthrough in Sino-Soviet relations, in part so

 China: Trying To Beat the Odds Along the Soviet Border)           11                    25X1
 Beijing has adopted a forward-defense strategy designed to deter a
 Soviet attack by raising the costs of an incursion into northeastern
 China. The Chinese intend to meet Soviet thrusts close to the border
 where they hope to shock Moscow into reassessing its attack.
 However, it will take years for China to field enough advanced
 weapons to adequately equip its forces for this mission. We have
 seen no signs that Moscow considers recent Chinese modernization
 efforts an immediate threat.
 Since Mikhail Gorbachev's election as General Secretary, the
 Soviets have increased the frequency and the objectivity of their
 media commentary on the reforms under way in the Chinese
 economy. This shift, however, reflects the leadership's desire to
 widen the boundaries of permissible domestic debate on economic
 reform and to improve Sino-Soviet ties, rather than approval of
 China's actions. Most Soviet officials and scholars are disturbed by
 the political riskiness and ideological unorthodoxy of the Chinese
 reforms, dismiss their applicability to the Soviet economy, and see
 them as posing an implicit challenge to Soviet leadership of the
 Communist camp.

 positions in the Third World.
 In recent months the Soviets have used the term "neoglobalism" to
 describe a supposed new US doctrine for the Third World. The
 concept serves as a useful propaganda vehicle, an explanation of
 recent events in the Third World, and possibly as an argument for a
 Soviet external policy that concentrates on consolidating existing

 Faced with slow labor force growth, the Soviet leadership is taking
 measures to improve the utilization of labor. In an effort to reduce
 labor hoarding and eliminate low-productivity job slots, Soviet
 enterprises have been tasked with a comprehensive inventory and

 The Gorbachev regime's most visible move to promote women to
 leadership positions was the appointment of Aleksandra Biryukova
 to the CPSU Secretariat. To some extent, this move has been echoed
 by the increased participation of women at many levels of party
 leadership. These are token gestures for now, although perhaps the
 beginning of a more significant trend. Because it is one means for
 Gorbachev to revitalize party cadres, we can expect the trend of
 increasing the role of women in party leadership to continue. The
 pace, however, is likely to be slow, consistent with the low priority

 Viewpoint              Moscow's Stake in the Berlin Access Challenge
 The Soviets have exploited, in our judgment, the GDR's challenge to
 Western access to Berlin even though they apparently did not
 initiate it. Its timing, the diversion of attention from recent Soviet
 setbacks in Chernobyl' and Libya, and the fit with the Soviets'
 objectives in both their German and overall European policies
 suggest to us that Moscow gave the East Germans a contingent go-
 ahead for the challenge. By doing so, Moscow probably also hoped
 to avoid Soviet-East German friction and to compensate the GDR
 somewhat for Gorbachev's evident refusal to let Honecker visit Bonn
 this year. We believe Soviet willingness to "intercede" with the East
 Germans to modify some of the proposed control measures was
 intended to seize the high ground of reasonable compromise and
 portray the three NATO occupying powers as being inflexible

 "socialist" state for the first time since 1966.
 When China's leader Mao Zedong died in 1976, the Soviets made a bid to
 improve relations that was quickly rejected by the Chinese as an attempt to
 meddle in the uncertain domestic situation. The tables turned when
 Chernenko died in 1985 and Gorbachev came to power: the Chinese
 signaled their interest in improved relations by calling the USSR a
 consulates in the other's country.
 The relationship has evolved into a broad range of exchanges in the trade,
 economic, and scientific fields. The two sides signed a long-term trade
 agreement last summer, for example, and, despite the Chernobyl' incident,
 China apparently sent a delegation to the USSR this summer to see
 whether Soviet nuclear power facilities might be suitable for China's need.
 Although the eight rounds of regularly scheduled discussions about
 "normalization" of bilateral relations have gone nowhere, the two sides
 have opened a separate set of discussions on international issues that so far
 have covered Asia and disarmament. Chinese Foreign Minister Wu has
 accepted an invitation to Moscow, and each side will be reopening
 The Soviets have consistently exaggerated the pace of progress in the
 relationship, while the Chinese have just as consistently expressed a
 gloomier view-both sides with an eye on Washington's reactions as they
 jockey for position in the Sino-US-Soviet triangle. Despite Soviet overstate-
 ments, however, Moscow has good reason to be pleased with the progress to
 date, especially because it has cost the Soviets next to nothing. The Soviets
 have shown no give on China's "three obstacles" to normalized relations-
 the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, Moscow's support to Vietnam for the
 Cambodia intervention, and the military buildup along the border and in
 Mongolia. The Soviets have long contended that the obstacles were

 artificial barriers that the Chinese would ignore when it suited them, and
 events to date have proved them right. The Chinese will undoubtedly
 continue to cite the three obstacles as a statement in principle of their
 concerns, as a way to reassure Washington that they remain wary of the
 Soviets, and as a means of letting the Chinese domestic audience know that
 they have not sold out to the Soviets. But the Soviets are confident that the
 "obstacles" will not stand in the way
 In any case, the Soviets undoubtedly believe the costs of making a major
 move on any of the three obstacles would be too high. It is unlikely, for ex-
 ample, that the China factor alone would lead the Soviets to pull out of Af-
 ghanistan without securing a regime that is both receptive to Soviet
 direction and capable of containing the insurgency. They would not
 damage their important relationship with Vietnam-and risk losing their
 base at Cam Ranh Bay-by stopping support for Hanoi's venture in
 Cambodia without a political arrangement in Phnom Penh that is accept-
 able to Hanoi and that brings an end to the resistance. Vietnam ties down
 Chinese troops along China's southern borders, and the Soviets have no
 interest in letting Cambodia's Heng Samrin regime fall to the resistance.
 On the issue of Soviet troops and missiles along the border with China,
 there is some room for maneuver, but this room is narrowing as China im-
 proves its own forces in these regions. The Soviets could withdraw a small
 number of troops, or pull them back farther from the border, with
 relatively little risk. But the Chinese are modernizing their forces along the
 border and are deploying them closer to the border rather than relying on
 their old strategy of luring the enemy in deep. They have also improved
 their capability to monitor Soviet activity along the border, reducing
 somewhat the element of surprise. If the Soviets ever considered making
 some adjustments along the border to placate the Chinese-and we have
 no evidence that they did-there is less incentive for them to do so now that
 the Chinese are becoming a more credible threat.
 In fact, the Soviets have continued to modernize their own forces along the
 border. Since the late 1970s, when the Soviets sharply increased the
 number of troops in the area to coincide with China's invasion of Vietnam
 and its establishment of relations with the United States, the troop buildup
 has been gradual but steady. The Soviets continue to send better quality
 equipment to the Sino-Soviet border after it has first been used by Soviet
 forces in the west. The pace of Chinese force modernization along the
 border will dictate to some extent the rate at which Soviet forces are
 modernized, but for now the Soviets seem satisfied to modernize gradually.

 ideological war-of-words of the past.
 With China not raising the three obstacles as consistently as in the past,
 the prospects for the relationship would seem brighter. It is fair to ask,
 however, what "normalization" would look like and whether in fact it
 would be very different from the situation that obtains today. It might be
 argued, convincingly, that for all intents and purposes, relations have been
 "normalized," even if they are not cordial. Economic relations are
 improving, with the Soviets set to help modernize a number of plants that
 they built in China in the 1950s and the Chinese prepared to enter the So-
 viet market with textiles and other products. Two sets of regularly
 scheduled meetings at the deputy-minister level allow the Soviets and
 Chinese to discuss numerous economic and political issues. Both sides
 publicly acknowledge one another as "socialists," thus muting the fierce
 For the Soviets, however, "normalization" would include several objectives
 still not within reach:
 ? Establishing party-to-party relations with China, while more important
 symbolically than substantively, would give Moscow an avenue that the
 United States cannot duplicate in its relations with Beijing.
 ? Resolving the longstanding border dispute would reduce the need for the
 military buildup on both sides of the border and could help lower tensions
 in a concrete, rather than atmospheric, sense.
 maneuverability within the Sino-US-Soviet triangle.
 ? Getting a formal commitment from China, in some sort of treaty, not to
 engage in strategic cooperation with the United States at Soviet expense
 is perhaps the least realistic objective, as the Soviets in effect are asking
 the Chinese to abandon their "independent" foreign policy and limit their
 for Deng to leave the scene.
 For the short term, both the Soviets and the Chinese seem satisified with
 the current state of relations. The Soviets, recognizing that the Chinese
 have eased back from the three obstacles, can afford to be patient, waiting
 for Beijing to make another move toward improving ties when it is ready.
 In Moscow's eyes, Deng Xiaoping poses perhaps the most important
 obstacle to further movement by Beijing, as the Soviets believe he is the
 least enthusiastic of China's top leaders about better relations. Being well
 satisfied with the progress in the relationship to date, the Soviets can wait
 Personalities are an obstacle on the Soviet side as well. Some individuals in
 the policymaking apparatus in both Beijing and Moscow probably see

 as an impediment to improved relations. Kapitsa has repeatedly antago-
 nized the Chinese and other Asian interlocutors with his arrogance and
 heavyhandedness and has been rumored to be on the way out as Moscow
 pays more attention to Asia
 Soviet patience is probably reinforced by a realization that China is likely
 to be an adversary for a long time to come, regardless of the formal state of
 relations. Distrust and suspicion are deep rooted on both sides, fueled only
 partly by ethnic animosities. The Soviets and the Chinese are competitors
 for influence, particularly in Asia, and with China's modernization pro-
 gram taking a path that breaks sharply with Soviet practice, the two offer
 starkly different models for socialist development.
 Since Gorbachev came to power, however, Soviet media commentary on
 the Chinese reforms has been more frequent and less critical. The Soviets
 probably intend this as a signal to China of their desire to improve
 relations. More important, it is a signal to the domestic audience that the
 range of permissible discussion of the USSR's own economic moderniza-
 tion program is getting broader. Indeed, the Soviets since Brezhnev's time
 have sought to improve ties to China but did not see fit until launching
 their own economic program to comment positively on China's reforms.
 Although the Chinese undoubtedly believe their program could be a model
 for the USSR, most Soviets find the Chinese approach too politically risky
 and not suitable to conditions in the USSR. The interest that both sides
 have in building their domestic economies, however, plays a large role in
 their efforts to reduce the military tensions between them, to put their
 relationship on a more sound economic footing, and, at the same time, to
 reach out to Western countries that can be of help economically.
 Moscow's revitalized interest in Japan, for example, fits into the latter
 category and also could help to advance Soviet interests vis-a-vis China.
 The Soviets want to show the Chinese that they have other options in Asia,
 and their efforts to improve relations with Tokyo and with P'yongyang are
 intended, in part, to serve that end. The Chinese, for their part, are
 improving relations with Moscow's East European allies, also with the
 same goal in mind. The Sino-US-Soviet triangular relationship, still
 critical in the calculations of both Moscow and Beijing, has nevertheless
 become only one of several triangular relationships that both the Soviets
 and Chinese are trying to set up as they seek to put pressure on one another
 even as they move closer together.

 Sino-Soviet Relations:
 The Gorbachev Policy
 same time, more dynamic manner.
 There has been considerable speculation during the
 past year about the possibility of a major shift in
 Soviet policy, with the new Gorbachev regime making
 a more determined effort to improve the USSR's
 position in Asia. The replacement of Foreign Minister
 Gromyko by Shevardnadze helped fuel thinking along
 this line last summer, as did the hopes and aspirations
 of a number of Moscow's would-be negotiating part-
 ners in Asia. Recent personnel changes and rumors of
 more to come at several offices dealing with Asian
 affairs suggest that Gorbachev and Shevardnadze
 have indeed started to assemble a new "Asia team."
 In the meantime, the Soviets have already become
 more outspoken in expressing their unhappiness with
 the extent to which they have been frozen out of the
 action in East Asia and the Western Pacific, despite
 their growing military presence in that part of the
 world. The Soviets also have begun to deal with some
 of their Asian neighbors in a smoother and, at the
 New Approach to the China Problem
 Soviet behavior toward China is a case in point. After
 years of trying to force the pace at which their
 relations with Beijing improved, the Soviets have
 recently become somewhat less heavyhanded in their
 courtship. This may be partly due to general Soviet
 satisfaction with the extent to which the two sides
 have expanded their contacts and their dialogue with-
 out any concessions on Beijing's "three obstacles"-
 Afghanistan, Cambodia, and the Soviet military
 buildup along China's northern border. But it also
 suggests that the Soviets now recognize that they have
 made some mistakes with the Chinese over the past
 few years and believe that a more subtle approach will
 be more effective in getting Beijing to make the next
 move.
 More Adroit Management of Bilateral Relations.
 Gorbachev reportedly made precisely that point in a
 wide-ranging critique of Soviet foreign policy at a
 conference held at the Foreign Ministry in late May.
 Gorbachev
 called for a more flexible and pragmatic approach,
 better relations with all countries, and an improved
 style of work in Soviet embassies.
 =Gorbachev had specifically stressed the need for
 better relations with the Chinese and had warned his
 audience against unrealistic expectations that the
 relationship could return to the golden days of the
 1950s, observing that the Soviets must accept China
 as it is today. A Chinese diplomat in Moscow told the
 US Embassy that, according to his sources, Gorba-
 chev also had spoken about the importance of recog-
 nizing that mistakes had been made and must be
 corrected.
 By then, the Soviets had already shown a heightened
 awareness of Chinese sensitivities on one or two
 occasions. For example, the Soviets had a Central
 Committee member-rather than a candidate mem-
 ber of the Politburo-head their team at the first
 session of the joint committee on economic coopera-
 tion, held in Beijing in mid-March. The Chinese had
 already turned down an invitation to the 27th CPSU
 Congress, and Gorbachev and his colleagues must
 have realized that to proceed with their original plan
 to send First Deputy Premier Talyzin, who had
 become a candidate member of the Politburo last
 October, was likely to reinforce Beijing's opposition to
 a resumption of formal party-to-party ties. First Dep-
 uty Premier Arkhipov, who is only a member of the
 Central Committee, was a much safer choice, and he
 seems to have made a conscious effort to avoid
 making any public statements that would add to
 Chinese irritation over the way the Soviets have
 exaggerated the progress that the two sides have made
 on key political issues.
 The Soviets have displayed similar caution while
 taking advantage of an agreement reached while
 Deputy Foreign Minister Kapitsa was in Beijing early

 last December for more bilateral consultations on
 international issues. Igor Rogachev-chief of the For-
 eign Ministry department responsible for relations
 with China, Mongolia, and North Korea-accompa-
 nied Arkhipov to Beijing in March without any
 fanfare. Both sides announced that Rogachev had two
 meetings with the head of the International Organiza-
 tions Department at the Chinese Foreign Ministry to
 discuss the UN General Assembly session last fall,
 and the Soviet media added that their talks had
 focused on arms control issues. Neither side has said a
 word about any other talks that Rogachev might have
 had in Beijing, but he must have asked some questions
 about Sino-US cooperation, especially in the military
 sphere. He also would have been a logical choice to
 explain any new Soviet "ground rules" for Chinese
 relations with Mongolia or with certain East Europe-
 an countries, or to answer any Chinese questions
 about Soviet-North Korean relations.
 Maneuvering With Third Parties. A second aspect of
 the new approach toward Beijing has been the in-
 creased attention Moscow has devoted to third parties
 in triangular relationships that include China and the
 USSR. The Soviets have worked hard to improve
 relations with Japan, for example, and have stated
 publicly that their current goal is to convince Tokyo to
 put Soviet-Japanese relations on a par with Sino-
 Japanese relations. Moscow also has taken additional
 steps to strengthen its ties to P'yongyang. While these
 contacts can be beneficial in their own right, they
 remind the Chinese that Moscow has other options in
 East Asia and that Beijing could be left behind if it
 continues to drag its feet in dealing with Moscow.
 They are, in that respect, part of a broader effort
 aimed at getting the Chinese to move forward on
 relations and not just an attempt to isolate and
 encircle China, as the Soviets tried to do during the
 1960s and 1970s.
 Moscow has adopted a more balanced approach in its
 maneuvering within the Sino-Soviet-US strategic tri-
 angle, instead of just focusing on the development of a
 "China card" to play against the United States. This
 is clear from the Soviets' willingness to reopen the
 Geneva arms talks in January 1985, to meet with
 President Reagan in Geneva last November, and to
 hold out the prospect of another Gorbachev-Reagan
 meeting this year despite increased criticism of the
 United States over the past few months. Moscow's
 contacts with Washington go well beyond those that
 the Soviets and Chinese have resumed to date, and
 thus help underscore the extent to which relations
 with the United States remain at the top of the Soviet
 foreign policy agenda, with China a distant second at
 best. The Soviets probably hope this strategy will help
 them convince Beijing that, to maintain its leverage in
 the triangle, it will have to move forward in its
 dealings with Moscow.
 The Soviets also are trying to appear more accommo-
 dating and flexible, and for this reason have made
 additional positive gestures within the past six
 months. Although still determined to keep the Chi-
 nese from acquiring too much influence in Eastern
 Europe, especially with their ideas on economic re-
 forms, Moscow has allowed the Chinese dialogue with
 the East Germans and Hungarians to go as far as
 Beijing wishes. The dialogue has even included a
 discussion of the resumption of party-to-party rela-
 tions, which the Chinese have not been willing to
 explore with the Soviets. Moscow also apparently has
 given the Mongolians a "green light" on seeking
 further improvement in their relations with Beijing,
 judging from the recent reports that the Chinese plan
 to send a deputy foreign minister to Mongolia in
 August, the first visit by a Chinese official at that
 level in more than 20 years.
 Working Around the "Three Obstacles. " Gorbachev
 probably had several motives in receiving Vice Pre-
 mier Li Peng at the Kremlin in late December. He
 reportedly restated to Li his interest in party-to-party
 ties and a Sino-Soviet summit. Gorbachev also appar-
 ently used the occasion to make it clear that "third
 country" issues such as those raised by Beijing's three
 obstacles have nothing to do with Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions. Nevertheless, his session with Li underscored
 the Soviet leader's interest in improved relations with
 Beijing and readiness to get directly involved in the
 dialogue.

 Kapitsa and a number of Moscow's other top experts
 on China still insist in private discussions that Bei-
 jing's three obstacles to improved relations are merely
 artificial devices that Beijing uses to slow the normal-
 ization of Sino-Soviet ties. Few experts seem to
 question the prevailing Soviet wisdom that the Chi-
 nese will abandon those issues in time and that
 Moscow, in the interim, should try to work around
 them rather than offer Beijing significant concessions.
 That attitude may change to some degree now that
 Gorbachev has said his piece to the foreign policy
 professionals, but Kapitsa and many of the other top
 experts on China probably will have to be replaced
 before Moscow will offer Beijing more than rhetoric
 or token gestures.
 The Chinese Response
 Chinese frustration with Gorbachev's smooth style
 but inflexibility on the issues that matter to them has
 become increasingly evident. Over the past several
 months, Beijing has once more turned up the volume
 of its criticism of Soviet policy and reemphasized its
 demand for progress on the so-called three obstacles
 as a precondition for normalizing relations. The down-
 turn on the political side, however, has not slowed the
 expansion in economic cooperation. This fact alone
 demonstrates, in our view, that the Chinese are
 determined to keep Sino-Soviet tensions within man-
 ageable limits to give themselves as much breathing
 space as possible to pursue their economic reform
 program
 Initial Courtship of New Soviet Leadership. China's
 approach to the new Soviet regime has gone through a
 number of phases. Beijing, anticipating a change in
 the Soviet leadership last spring, was clearly anxious
 then to give new impetus to Sino-Soviet relations, in
 part, we suspect, to avoid losing ground in the Sino-
 Soviet-US strategic triangle. Indeed, even before Gor-
 bachev's accession, the Chinese had welcomed Arkhi-
 pov to Beijing in December 1984 for talks on
 economic cooperation, had begun playing down the
 three obstacles, and had resumed referring to Soviet
 leaders as "comrade" for the first time since the
 1960s. Once Gorbachev had assumed power, the
 Chinese expanded their efforts to ameliorate rela-
 tions-agreeing to resume long-suspended trade union
 and parliamentary relations and to exchange visits by
 Foreign Ministers Shevardnadze and Wu this year.
 We think Beijing offered such inducements to encour-
 age Gorbachev to reassess Moscow's hardline policies
 toward China's security concerns. The Chinese un-
 doubtedly also saw an opportunity to increase their
 leverage with Washington, especially if they succeed-
 ed in inducing Moscow to be more accommodating.
 Return to a Tougher Political Stance. The Chinese
 probably have been disappointed-but not sur-
 prised-by the continued Soviet intransigence. As
 best we can determine, the discussions at the last
 three rounds of Sino-Soviet consultations-which the
 Chinese use as a forum for raising the three obsta-
 cles-have been as sterile as previous rounds. More-
 over, the Chinese probably are chagrined about the
 way Moscow has tried to use the improved atmo-
 sphere of Sino-Soviet relations to enhance the Soviet
 position vis-a-vis the United States. Chinese officials
 appear to have been particularly upset by Kapitsa's
 efforts to do so in early January, a month after his
 most recent visit to Beijing, by leaking a Soviet
 proposal for a nonaggression treaty. Foreign Minister
 Wu subsequently denounced Kapitsa as a "liar"
 before a group of West European diplomats for
 prematurely announcing that the two sides had agreed
 on a date for Wu's visit to Moscow this year.
 By then, the Chinese were almost going out of their
 way to single out one or another aspect of Soviet    25X1
 foreign policy for criticism. Wu, for example, took
 Moscow sharply to task over Afghanistan and Indo-
 china in a speech at the Chinese National People's
 Congress in mid-January. Chinese foreign ministry
 officials subsequently dismissed Gorbachev's renewed
 expressions, at the 27th Congress, of a desire for
 better relations with China, characterizing them as
 nothing new and mainly "tactical."
 the Chinese privately turned
 down an invitation to the 27th Congress from Gorba-
 ence would be seen as a major concession to the
 Soviets and only encourage the Kremlin to continue to
 refuse to discuss their security differences.

 Secret
 The Chinese have been equally negative in responding
 to Soviet overtures for a summit of some kind without
 any preconditions-that is, without Soviet concessions
 in advance on the obstacles, especially on the Cambo-
 dian problem. At a press conference in Beijing only
 one day after Deputy Foreign Minister Qian had
 returned from the April round of political talks, a
 Chinese official said it would be "unrealistic" to hold
 such meetings while the obstacles to a normalization
 of relations remain. The Chinese have taken the same
 line on a number of occasions since then, both publicly
 and in their private talks with US representatives and
 officials of other interested third countries
 on Foreign Minister Wu's visit to the USSR.
 the two sides did agree in
 early December on a general time frame for the visit
 this spring, and on a Shevardnadze visit to China
 toward the end of this year. We believe the Chinese
 subsequently backed out of the deal for a number of
 reasons-involving leadership politics as well as Bei-
 jing's position within the Sino-Soviet-US triangular
 relationship. In late December, soon after Gorbachev
 had seen Li at the Kremlin, Chinese officials began to
 insist in private that Wu would not go to Moscow
 until there had been some Soviet movement on the
 three obstacles, and General Secretary Hu Yaobang
 made the same point in an interview in late January.
 The Chinese have stuck to that position over the past
 few months and apparently plan to hold the exchange
 of foreign minister visits hostage until they believe the
 visits will serve Chinese as well as Soviet purposes.
 In our view, the Chinese have adopted a tougher
 stance to try to disabuse Moscow of the notion that
 China will eventually drop its political demands and
 move incrementally toward a normalization of party-
 to-party as well as state-to-state relations. Even more
 important, perhaps, the Chinese do not want to
 jeopardize their growing economic links to the West,
 and thus feel compelled periodically-in our view-to
 reassure the United States and its allies that Beijing is
 not prepared to cut a deal with Moscow at the expense
 of Western security interests. The Chinese also want
 to encourage their Pakistani and Thai allies to contin-
 ue to resist the Soviets and their Afghan and Viet-
 namese clients.
 the Vietnamese and their Soviet patron.
 Keeping the Doors Open in Other Channels. Beijing
 has not, however, let the impasse in political relations
 stand in the way of expanding economic ties. Bilateral
 trade increased to almost $2 billion last year-the
 highest level since the late 1950s. (This figure still
 represents less than 3 percent of China's total foreign
 trade and slightly more than 1 percent of Soviet
 foreign trade.) Beijing also welcomed Arkhipov for the
 first session of the new joint commission on economic
 cooperation. At the same time, however, the Chinese
 received a group of Cambodian resistance leaders and
 endorsed their latest negotiating offer in an obvious
 display of solidarity with the resistance forces against
 The Arkhipov visit reflects Chinese as well as Soviet
 interest in keeping the relationship on track. Indeed,
 we believe the Chinese-despite continued Soviet
 unwillingness to address their main security con-
 cerns-see the steady expansion of economic ties to
 the Soviet Union and its East European allies as
 serving their interests in several ways. It helps to
 reduce Sino-Soviet tensions somewhat, and thus
 makes it a bit easier for top Chinese leaders to
 subordinate military modernization to their broader
 economic modernization drive. It leaves open the
 possibility at some point of a breakthrough in Sino-
 Soviet relations, in part so the United States does not
 take Chinese hostility toward the USSR for granted.
 Finally, it gives China access to Soviet and East
 European markets and technology.
 The USSR and China have already agreed to work
 together on modernizing 17 factories built with Soviet
 help in the 1950s and on the development of seven
 new projects-including coal mining, thermal energy
 production, and possibly railroad electrification. The
 Chinese also sent some of their experts to Moscow this
 summer to look at Soviet nuclear power technology,
 despite the accident at Chernobyl'. An agreement to
 double the civilian flights between Moscow and Beij-
 ing might be even more significant, if there is any
 basis to the story-said to have originated with East
 European diplomats in Beijing-that the extra Soviet
 flights will continue to Hanoi and Vientiane, while the
 Chinese flights will go on to Warsaw and Berlin.

 Moreover, the Chinese-according to one Soviet dip-
 lomat in Beijing-were already pushing in early May
 for yet another visit to China by a Soviet deputy
 premier, to reciprocate Vice Premier Yao's trip to the
 USSR in July 1985. The Chinese position reportedly
 was that Arkhipov had not paid the debt with his visit
 in March, because that was strictly in connection with
 the first session of the joint economic committee. The
 Soviet diplomat also told the US Embassy that the
 most likely candidates to visit Beijing this fall were
 First Deputy Premier Aliyev, a full member of the
 CPSU Politburo, or First Deputy Premier Talyzin, a
 candidate member. The Chinese have said nothing
 about the possibility of such a visit, but they might see
 it as a way to raise the level of the Sino-Soviet
 dialogue without abandoning their terms for a visit to
 Moscow by Foreign Minister Wu, a resumption of
 formal party-to-party ties, or some kind of summit.

 China: Trying To Beat the
 Odds Along the Soviet Border
 Beijing has discarded the Maoist strategy of luring
 Soviet forces deep into Chinese territory-trading
 land for the time needed to organize large guerrilla
 assaults on overextended Soviet forces-in favor of a
 more forward, conventional defense plan for industri-
 alized northeast China. This change in strategy was
 apparently driven by the impressive buildup of Soviet
 forces in the Far East and Chinese determination not
 to yield readily key industrial areas to the Soviets in
 wartime. Prior to 1964, 11 active Soviet ground-
 combat divisions with fewer than 3,500 tanks and
 armored vehicles were positioned opposite China.
 Today, there are 49 active Soviet ground-combat
 divisions and over 30,000 tanks and armored vehicles
 along the Sino-Soviet border
 Beijing now labels the
 Maoist strategy as inadequate and unworkable, and
 today's strategy of "active defense" holds that any
 invasion must be met early and repulsed to preserve
 the national government and prevent the occupation
 of Chinese cities. By embracing active defense,
 China's leaders have abandoned the long-held belief
 that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) could stage
 a strategic retreat from the northeast and form a new
 defensive perimeter south of the Huang He River in
 the initial stages of a conventional war with the Soviet
 Union.
 Aware that Soviet strength and China's new strategy
 require far greater levels of readiness in the standing
 army, Chinese military leaders-led by Military
 Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping-have moved
 decisively to restructure the PLA for modern combat
 by:
 ? Reorganizing maneuver armies into more powerful
 combined-arms armies-called group armies.
 ? Strengthening border-defense forces by creating
 more divisions and increasing their armor and artil-
 lery holdings.
 ? Renovating defense industries by acquiring foreign
 technology to build more advanced weapons.
 ? Acquiring selected advanced armaments from the
 West.
 ? Trimming the armed forces by dismissing at least 2
 million redundant personnel from military payrolls.
 ? Promoting younger officers with recent combat
 experience against Vietnam to prominent positions
 in regional and national commands.
 The Active Defense Takes Shape
 Eleven of the 17 field armies in northern China were   25X1
 reorganized into group armies in 1982 and 1983.
 Notably larger than the field armies, group armies     25X1
 added previously independent artillery, armor, and
 garrison divisions. This change enhances combined-
 arms operations and training, and forces infantry
 commanders to learn to use armor and long-range
 artillery support effectively. In the 1979 war with
 Vietnam, infantry commanders often failed to take
 objectives because they lacked contact with, or were
 unaware of, available fire support.
 In 1985 Beijing completed the transition to group
 armies, disestablishing some field armies and redis-    25X1
 tributing their manpower and equipment to group
 armies. In northern China, four of the 17 armies were
 abolished, and those not converted to group armies in
 the period 1982-83 were upgraded to group army
 status. Although still in the formative stages, most of
 the 15 group armies in the north now have over
 70,000 men-compared to some 50,000 prior to reor-
 ganization-and control four instead of three infantry
 divisions.                                      25X1

 Secret
 On the basis of                      geograph-
 ic considerations, we expect that the group armies
 would fight as cohesive units. If a Soviet attack
 appeared imminent, group army divisions would prob-
 ably move forward to prepared defensive positions,
 blocking likely avenues of approach-such as those
 opposite Soviet troop concentrations near Vladivostok
 or along the rail line from Mongolia. Forward deploy-
 ment of other group armies would depend on the
 scope, direction, and success of a Soviet incursion.
 The Need for New Weapons
 Hardware shortcomings add to the significant risks
 imposed by a more aggressive defense posture, and
 Beijing is attempting to solve them with largely
 indigenous weapon programs and some foreign assis-
 tance. In order to redirect the limited defense budget
 into research and development, Beijing has ceased
 production of many obsolete weapons and trimmed
 the PLA from perhaps 7 million soldiers in 1980 to
 about 5 million today. Over the past six years, many
 defense plants have produced almost exclusively for
 export, reaping sizable profits from over $6 billion in
 sales.
 this emphasis on
 weapons development is paying dividends in areas of
 greatest need:
 ? The most critical deficiency the Chinese face is the
 inability to counter Soviet tanks and armored vehi-
 Iles arrayed against China.
 in mid-1985 the Chinese began produc-
 ing an improved tank. It is equipped with a British-
 designed 105-mm main gun and an advanced fire-
 control system-both probably acquired from
 Israel. If, in the next three years, China builds some
 1,000 tanks as expected and begins to retrofit its
 remaining 6,000 Type 59 tanks with the new sys-
 tems, it will help to reduce some of the qualitative
 armor edge now held by Soviet forces along the
 border.
 Before 1978, 11 poorly equipped and severely under-
 strength border-defense garrison divisions provided a
 first line of defense in the mountain passes along the
 most likely Soviet invasion corridors. Today there
 are 15 such divisions, and most have been converted
 into five-regiment divisions-with a tank and artil-
 lery regiment as well as three infantry regiments-
 similar to firstline, main-force divisions. In the past,
 Soviet forces could expect to meet only token resis-
 tance in northeastern Shenyang until they reached
 Harbin. Now there are garrison divisions at Bei'an
 and Jiamusi with well-constructed defensive positions
 just south of the cities                      25X1
 25X1
 Strengthening border garrisons and consolidating
 units into group armies have not, however, redressed
 the glaring imbalance in combat power between Sovi-
 et and Chinese units. The Chinese thus are beginning
 to mechanize their armies to give them a rapid
 striking power. In 1980, China created its first mech-
 anized infantry regiment, armed with 120 armored
 personnel carriers. Since then, Beijing has mecha-
 nized another full division, as well as other selected
 units deployed in the border region. According to
 articles in China's military newspaper, the Chinese
 envision using these elite units to isolate and annihi-

 late a single Soviet unit, hoping to shock Moscow int25X 1
 reassessing its attack. Completely equipping one  25X1
 group army with mechanized infantry divisions, how-
 ever, will require over 1,400 armored personnel carri-
 ers-more than China now produces in two years.
 The majority of Chinese main-force units, therefore,
 will continue to plan to fight from positional defenses
 in advantageous terrain.

 ? Beijing also needs to upgrade its ground-based air
 defenses and improve its early warning capabilities.
 By 1984 the Chinese placed their copy of the Soviet
 SA-7 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile in series
 production, providing some protection to group ar-
 mies from attack helicopters and slow-flying air-
 craft.                       Beijing also is
 trying to develop a mobile surface-to-air missile
 based on a French Crotale battery acquired from
 Pakistan in 1981.
 In addition to these programs, Beijing is shopping for
 Western technology to produce more advanced mili-
 tary hardware. Last fall, the Chinese held an armed
 helicopter flyoff near Beijing to compare US and
 French attack helicopters and helicopter-borne anti-
 tank missiles. The Swiss recently conducted live-fire
 demonstrations of their mobile, radar-guided antiair-
 craft guns in China as well. This summer the Chinese
 are expected to sign a foreign military sales agree-
 ment to equip 50 of their F-8-2 fighter aircraft with a
 US avionics package and are exploring the possibility
 of mounting the Italian Aspide 57-km-range, radar-
 guided, air-to-air missile on this aircraft as well.

 constrained, China's dealings with the Israelis show
 that Beijing will spend to procure selected advanced
 systems from the West, particularly if the sales

 China's leaders acknowledge this weakness (see inset)
 and continue to see talks with Moscow as the key to
 managing tensions. Indeed, Beijing faces a major
 balancing act in bolstering its deterrent-in part
 through military cooperation and arms acquisition
 from the West-without unduly increasing friction
 with its powerful adversary. To this end, we expect
 Beijing to continue to exchange visits and sign eco-
 nomic and technical agreements with Moscow-with-
 out fundamentally altering its assessment of the Sovi-
 et threat or significantly slowing the pace of military
 modernization.
 China clearly believes that the possibility of a major
 conflict with the Soviet Union is small and will
 remain so for at least the 10 years needed to modern-
 ize its armed forces. In the interim, we believe Beijing
 has made an impressive start, implementing a new
 military strategy that adds to the deterrence value of
 China's large but dated ground army. Such a strategy
 ensures that the Soviet Union would be faced with a
 include transfer of the production technology.

 protracted conflict if it made any incursion into
 northern China. The strategy has already revitalized
 the discussion of tactics in the PLA and forced
 officers to think realistically about war on the modern
 battlefield. Moreover, the strategy and new force
 structure are well suited to the incorporation of new
 weapons as they become available, and ongoing train-
 ing will ensure that units understand the combined-
 arms requirements of modern warfare.
 The Soviet Reaction
 The Soviets probably have a reasonably accurate view
 of China's progress toward modernizing its armed
 forces because the Chinese have publicly announced
 their plans to increase the war-fighting abilities of
 their army and have openly displayed their new
 weapons developments for the export market. Still, we
 have not detected any shift in Soviet force trends in
 response to these developments, nor is there any
 evidence that Moscow perceives these Chinese pro-
 grams to be a grave threat to its security in the
 immediate future. The Soviets have recently tried to
 avoid direct confrontation over military issues in their
 foreign policy toward China, and are attempting to
 accelerate their rapprochement with the Chinese by
 calling for meetings between high-level officials and
 greater economic cooperation. Although Moscow has
 been critical of the military aspects of China's "Four
 Modernizations" in the past, it is currently directing
 its attacks mainly at the United States-alleging that
 Washington is promoting anti-Soviet sentiment in
 China and aiding Chinese military modernization for
 economic gain.
 The Soviets have viewed the Chinese as a potential
 offensive threat throughout the past 20 years and
 have structured their forces in the Far East accord-
 ingly. Their forces opposite China are positioned to
 protect the territorial integrity of the USSR and to
 deter the Chinese from attacking developed areas and
 lines of communication (LOCs) near the border. Given
 the proximity of Soviet LOCs and other important
 installations to the border, the fact that most LOCs
 run parallel rather than perpendicular to the border,
 and the vast length of the border itself, defense in
 depth is not a viable strategy. Thus, Soviet strategy in
 the Far East probably is to respond to any Chinese
 offensive with a counteroffensive. Because the Chi-
 nese forces lack mobility, the Soviets have been able
 to rely upon having early warning and a relatively
 long reaction time to mobilize their forces before any
 Chinese attack. Until now, they could also expect
 weak initial Chinese opposition to Soviet offensive
 operations in northern China because of China's
 "luring deep" strategy. Therefore, Moscow will seek,
 at a minimum, to maintain forces along the border
 strong enough both to mount effective counterattacks
 to push back any surprise Chinese incursions and to
 launch preemptive attacks into Chinese territory to
 destroy offensive troop concentrations and secure
 buffer zones near the border.
 The Soviets would react more dramatically toward
 Chinese military modernization if they believed the
 Chinese were becoming more offensively oriented-
 through the positioning of large numbers of mobile
 units closer to the border where they would pose a
 greater threat to Soviet LOCs or strategically impor-
 tant population centers such as Vladivostok. They also
 would perceive the situation in the Far East as more
 threatening if the Chinese began to modernize their
 military forces at an accelerated rate that threatened
 the effectiveness of Soviet border defense strategy.
 Chinese plans do not currently call for garrisoning
 new divisions near the border, only for strengthening
 the few that are already there. Despite recent pro-
 gress, Chinese modernization programs also have not
 yet placed large amounts of modern equipment in the
 hands of Chinese soldiers. Thus, the Soviets have been
 able to maintain their overwhelming offensive superi-
 ority over the Chinese in recent years. If current
 Chinese equipment production programs proceed at
 the relatively slow rate we project, Moscow should be
 able to prevent the balance of forces on the Sino-
 Soviet border from being radically altered. Given
 their continuing qualitative superiority, plus their
 manpower and equipment constraints, the Soviets
 probably will defer any further major buildup of their
 forces opposite China-at least for the next 10
 years-and instead continue to follow the pattern of
 moderate growth and equipment modernization that
 has characterized their force development in the Far
 East in the 1980s

 Moscow's View of China's
 Economic Reforms
 Since Mikhail Gorbachev's election as General Secre-
 tary, the Soviets have increased the frequency and the
 objectivity of their media commentary on the reforms
 under way in the Chinese economy. This shift, howev-
 er, reflects the leadership's desire to widen the bound-
 aries of permissible domestic debate on economic
 reform and to improve Sino-Soviet ties, rather than
 approval of China's actions. Many Soviet economists
 privately express admiration for the ambitiousness
 and determination of the Chinese reform effort, but
 few advocate Beijing's actual policies. Most Soviet
 officials and scholars are disturbed by the political
 riskiness and ideological unorthodoxy of the Chinese
 reforms, dismiss their applicability to the Soviet econ-
 omy, and see them as posing an implicit challenge to
 Soviet leadership of the Communist camp.
 "Socialism With Chinese Characteristics"
 The Chinese leadership has described its reform
 program as an effort to "bring the superiority of the
 socialist system into full play" by aligning it more
 closely with conditions unique to present-day China.
 The reform effort's primary focus initially was on the
 agrarian sector. In late 1978, a "contract responsibil-
 ity system" was introduced that gave farmers effec-
 tive control but not ownership of most of the land. By
 the mid-1980s, communal farming had disappeared in
 China. The same period witnessed a revision of state
 procurement practices that allowed farmers to sell
 above-quota production at negotiated prices to the
 state or in free markets. Because of such changes,
 agricultural production grew at an average annual
 rate of 8 percent between 1979 and 1983.
 After this initial success, the Third Plenum of the
 12th Chinese Communist Party Congress in October
 1984 instituted a broad set of measures aimed at
 similar improvement in industrial performance (see
 inset). Greater use of wage and bonus incentives,
 partial decentralization of the foreign trade appara-
 tus, and reform of the banking system to allow state
 banks greater autonomy in lending decisions have also
 been important facets of the reform program.
 Measures approved at the Third Plenum of China's
 12th Party Congress included:
 ? Reduced use of mandatory production plans and
 more emphasis on "guidance" plans that enable
 enterprises to respond to changing market
 conditions.
 ? Reduced use of administered prices and the intro-
 duction offloating prices for some products to bring
 supply and demand into balance.
 ? Less involvement of the government and the party in
 day-to-day business operations.
 ? Encouragement of many enterprises to compete
 against each other for profits, but with the state
 still controlling production and distribution of es-
 sential commodities and making major investment
 decisions.
 ? Allowing enterprises to retain a larger share of their
 earnings and giving the management of industrial
 enterprises greater control over wages, bonuses, and
 investment spending.
 The initial results of China's industrial reform effort
 have been mixed. Growth in output and productivity
 have been impressive. Figures on last year's economic
 performance released by the State Statistical Bureau
 show a spectacular 18-percent growth in industrial
 output and a 12-percent rise in national income.F_
 But this economic success has exacted a price. The
 yearend statistical report also acknowledged 9-percent
 inflation (triple the rate in 1984) and, according to

 Secret
 CIA estimates, China had an $8.2 billion trade deficit
 in 1985. The drive to make the economy more
 efficient has resulted in widening income disparities
 and consumer grumbling over rising food prices.
 Relaxing economic controls and opening the economic
 system to foreign trade and investment have sparked
 widespread economic corruption.
 All of these "negative phenomena" have been meticu-
 lously chronicled by "in-house" critics of the reforms
 and openly acknowledged by Deng and his fellow
 reformers. But self-criticism and periods of retrench-
 ment have not been allowed to obscure the ultimate
 goal. The current throttling-back of the reform drive
 was decreed late last year to allow the economic
 system to adjust to the reforms already introduced,
 but Beijing has made it clear that further reforms are
 in the offing. The session of the Sixth National
 People's Congress that ended on 12 April endorsed
 further ambitious reforms to be implemented from
 1987 to 1990 and generally enhanced the political
 position of proreform party leaders.
 The Soviet Perspective
 Gorbachev's election as General Secretary brought a
 qualitative and quantitative change in Soviet media
 treatment of the Chinese economy. According to a
 noted Soviet political commentator, predominant
 "conservative thinking" under Chernenko had led to a
 virtual ban on publishing assessments of the Chinese
 reforms. The new General Secretary's calls for im-
 provements in the Soviet economy and his evident
 interest in economic changes made by other Commu-
 nist countries effectively lifted that ban.
 Soviet commentary on the Chinese reforms since
 March 1985 has been comparatively plentiful and
 fairly balanced, at times noting with apparent envy
 the impressive growth figures of Chinese industry and
 agriculture. On occasion media comment has gone
 even further-to draw vignettes of a happier and
 more prosperous Chinese population or to treat con-
 troversial subjects such as the growth of the private
 sector without negative comment
 Usually, however, Soviet media focus on inflation,
 unemployment, and the other "negative phenomena"
 produced by Beijing's sweeping economic reform
 drive. Widening income disparities, in particular, have
 figured prominently in Moscow's appraisals; one arti-
 cle even warned of imminent "kulakization" (unjust
 enrichment of certain peasants at the expense of
 others) of the Chinese countryside.
 In appraising the Chinese scene in their media, the
 Soviets employ the familiar tactic of quoting indige-
 nous critics rather than expressing criticism them-
 selves. In this way, Moscow can register a negative
 opinion without incurring risks to the bilateral politi-
 cal atmosphere. The Chinese leadership's willingness
 to permit open debate on economic and ideological
 issues provides Soviet critics with much grist for their
 mill.
 The private views of Soviet officials, economists, and
 scholars on the Chinese reforms, not surprisingly,
 cover a far broader range than those presented in the
 media. Some are openly enthusiastic about the pro-
 found changes taking place in China. Last December,
 for example, Fedor Burlatskiy, a Soviet journalist well
 known for his reformist stance, made a trip to China
 and afterwards gave US Embassy officials a
 "glowing" description of the results of the reforms,
 noting the candor with which Chinese officials ac-
 knowledged problems and their strong commitment to
 pursuing reform. Other Soviet scholars, however, have
 been scornful of the Chinese reform program. Last
 October, for example, a Soviet sinologist described it
 as "a mad rush into an unmanageable economic
 mishmash."

 have stressed the gulf between the two countries'
 levels of economic and social development (China's
 population is still 60 percent rural, for example,
 compared with the USSR's 35 percent) and other
 significant differences. A China scholar at the USA
 Institute in November 1985 noted that while China
 had too little land and too many workers, the Soviet
 Union had the opposite problem in land and too few
 workers in areas where they were most needed. Other
 experts have referred to the less highly skilled Chinese
 work force, the predominance of the agricultural
 sector in the Chinese economy, and other obstacles to
 borrowing directly from the Chinese
 Historical and cultural differences between the two
 societies and the political risks posed by Chinese-style
 reforms are also frequently cited as barriers to Soviet
 emulation of China. A prominent Soviet journalist
 told US Embassy officials, shortly after Gorbachev's
 accession, that reforms of the type introduced by
 Beijing were possible only because China was a
 "relatively new socialist country."
 Indeed, adapting Chinese reforms to Soviet conditions
 would require a significant reduction in political
 control over economic decision making, overhaul of
 official ideology, restructuring of key institutions, and
 a radical change in managerial attitudes and behav-
 ior. Any one of these would be a tall order for such a
 well-entrenched, essentially conservative elite.
 Many Soviet sinologists,
 have contended that, given the "backwardness" of
 China's economy, the Chinese would profit more from
 following the Soviet example than vice versa. Soviet
 diplomats and other officials have also made this
 point, in part apparently out of irritation that the
 Chinese may have stolen the Soviets' thunder on
 ~Ve
 Chinese believe Gorbachev is afraid that if China gets
 ahead of the Soviet Union on economic reform, the
 confidence of other "socialist" countries in Soviet
 "socialism" will be weakened.
 The Soviets clearly are unwilling to make the psycho-
 logical leap of granting China's reformed economy
 the status of a "model" that they or other Communist
 countries might emulate. From the Soviets' viewpoint,
 the scope, speed, and nature of the changes in China,
 the world's most populous Communist state, and the
 attention given these changes by foreign media must
 make Beijing's reforms appear a more formidable
 challenge to their own economic model and to their
 role as the leading Communist state than Hungary's
 20-year-old reform program.
 Another aspect of Moscow's attitude toward Beijing's
 reform program may be fear. The possibility that the
 Chinese could make a great success of their experi-
 ment, not only discrediting Moscow's more measured
 approach but also building up even more formidable
 economic and military strength and moving closer to
 the West, almost certainly is disquieting to the Sovi-

 Neoglobalism: New Soviet
 Formulation on the United States
 and the Third World
 Since mid-December Soviet journalists, international
 affairs specialists, and, on at least two occasions,
 General Secretary Gorbachev have used the term
 "neoglobalism" to describe what they assert is a new
 American philosophy and doctrine for the Third
 World. Neoglobalism is defined as the US adminis-
 tration's design to promote its interests by exploiting
 and initiating regional conflicts using a variety of
 political, economic, and military instruments. Extend-
 ed discussions of neoglobalism have focused on the
 challenge that a more activist US Third World policy
 poses for Soviet efforts to consolidate their own Third
 World gains.
 The Soviets use ideological formulations of this kind
 for several purposes, including integrating separate
 propaganda themes, defending positions staked out in
 internal policy debates, rationalizing policy decisions
 for internal and external audiences, and explaining
 their assessments of the outside world. In this in-
 stance, the concept of neoglobalism is, at the very
 least, a useful propaganda vehicle and an explanation
 of recent developments in the Third World. Taken
 more seriously, it could be intended as an argument
 for a cautious Soviet external policy designed to
 complement domestic economic revitalization and
 lower growth in military spending.
 Evolution of Soviet Assessments
 Over the past decade, Soviet formulations describing
 the US approach to the Third World have gradually
 evolved away from the generally optimistic assess-
 ments of the late 1970s, which emphasized the
 relative decline of US ability to influence events in the
 Third World due to growing military, economic, and
 domestic political constraints. More recent discussions
 have focused on the difficulties affecting Soviet pros-
 pects for exploiting openings in the Third World and
 on the challenges presented by a US administration
 intent on building its military strength and playing an
 active role in regional disputes. Such shifts in the
 Soviet line usually result from a variety of factors,
 including changes in Soviet views of the outside world,
 internal political debates, and the desire of new
 leaders to put their own stamp on theory and policy.
 The last of these factors probably played an important
 role in the recent gestation of "neoglobalism."
 Neoglobalism Defined
 According to Soviet commentators-who suggest that
 the term was taken from New York Times columnist
 Anthony Lewis-the basis of neoglobalism is a re-
 newed US insistence on defining the US sphere of
 interest as the entire world. To promote its "imperia-
 list" interests, the Reagan administration is said to be
 ready to prolong existing regional conflicts that
 threaten "progressive" and "anti-imperialist" govern-
 ments, such as Angola and Afghanistan, and to
 initiate new confrontations with countries that do not
 suit US preferences, such as Libya and Syria. The
 administration is said to justify these activities in
 terms of supporting democracy, antiterrorism, and
 anti-Communism.

 Soviet propagandists have produced a steady stream
 of articles picturing the United States as ready to use
 a wide variety of instruments in pursuit of its neoglo-
 balist objectives, including:
 ? Economic leverage that exploits Third World under-
 development and debt to increase dependency on the
 West.
 ? Political pressure intended to remove rightwing
 dictators who have become counterproductive to US
 purposes in favor of more respectable, but still
 pliable, leaders who may be able to deflect pressure
 for revolutionary change.
 ? . Covert and open military assistance for "bandits,
 terrorists, .and counterrevolutionaries."
 ? Direct US military intervention with Rapid Deploy-

 projection forces.
 Expanded Discussions
 Izvestiya political: observer Aleksandr Bovin has used
 the notion of neoglobalism as a point of departure for
 an extended political analysis of specific international
 situations that create openings for US policy. He
 notes that a variety of factors, including economic
 backwardness, the strength of tradition and religion,
 and the errors of vanguard revolutionary leaderships,
 have nurtured counterrevolution against "socialist-
 oriented" Third World states and pushed a proportion
 of the "workers and peasants" into the counterrevolu-
 tionary,camp.' Bovin claims that these developments
 provide the United States with opportunities to exploit
 the difficulties of the socialist-oriented states through
 propaganda, psychological and economic warfare, and
 military backing, for counterrevolutionary forces. C
 Bovin repeats the obligatory argument that US efforts
 are ultimately futile "in principle" since the forces of
 history cannot be reversed. However, he points out
 that US strength can, in some circumstances, retard
 or even.roll back revolutionary gains, as occurred in
 ' Moscow's list of "socialist-oriented" states changes from time to
 time but currently includes among its most prominent members

 Chile and Grenada, and warns that "we cannot yet
 exclude the possibility of its happening again." A
 socialist-oriented state must thus be vigilant and
 "know how to defend itself," a process that will be
 difficult and drawn out. He concludes optimistically
 that over the long haul imperialist interference will
 promote the consolidation of revolutionary forces and
 the buildup of internationalist aid, leading to the
 Another, extended treatment of neoglobalism was
 provided by Maj. Gen. (Reserve) F. Gontar in a
 March 1986 article in the Soviet military newspaper
 Red Star. Gontar observes that US security aid for
 reactionary regimes and counterrevolutionary forces
 is "one of the most effective and cheapest ways" of
 promoting imperialist interests. He claims that to
 cover its "aggressive" regional policies the United
 States seeks to blame the USSR for promoting re
 gional tensions and then uses these charges as an
 excuse for lack of progress in bilateral relations with
 the USSR on disarmament and other critical East-
 West issues. He asserts that the USSR believes that
 any local conflict "is fraught with the danger of
 escalating into a clash on a major, even global, scale"
 and calls on the United States to abandon its neoglo-
 balist policy and join in a collective search for settle-
 ments to regional conflicts.
 Gorbachev and Neoglobalism
 General Secretary Gorbachev has publicly mentioned
 neoglobalism on at least two occasions. First, he used
 the term in a speech during the March visit of
 Algerian President Bendjedid to tie together criticism
 of US policy in Nicaragua, Cambodia, Angola, Mo-
 zambique, Afghanistan, Grenada, and Libya. The
 second reference appeared in an interview in the
 Algerian publication Revolution Africaine, in which
 he defined neoglobalism as a "hastily devised" doc-
 trine used by the United States to "crush the liberated
 countries and halt the forces of history." He noted
 that neoglobalism "in general terms" represents noth-
 ing new, reflecting rather an attempt to return to the
 "classical brigandage" of imperialism.

 Significance of Neoglobalism
 At one level, the concept of neoglobalism offers the
 Soviets a useful vehicle for integrating many of the
 propaganda themes they have been using in recent
 months to try to discredit US policy in the interna-
 tional arena, notably accusations against Washington
 of promoting "state terrorism" and the export of
 "counterrevolution." Gorbachev's speech on the occa-
 sion of the Algerian President's visit to Moscow is one
 example of how the charge of neoglobalism is used in
 this context. Also, recent Soviet press coverage of US
 actions toward Afghanistan, Nicaragua, and Libya
 has prominently featured neoglobalism as an explana-
 tion of alleged US aggression against these states.
 The timing of neoglobalism's advent as a propaganda
 theme suggests it is in part a counter to the US
 emphasis on regional issues before and during last
 year's Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Geneva. Mos-
 cow has used the theme to castigate the alleged
 insincerity of US proposals on Third World issues,
 portraying Washington's underlying policy as one of
 interference and aggression. Moreover, at least one
 Soviet commentator has used the concept to criticize
 the United States specifically for elevating Third
 World issues to the same level of importance as arms
 control on the US-Soviet agenda and for claiming
 that there should be linkage between progress in these
 areas.
 While Soviet commentators have dealt with various
 aspects of these themes individually in the past few
 years, collecting them all under the neoglobalism
 rubric may, in part, reflect Soviet responses to several
 relatively recent developments in the international
 arena. For example, the intensification of Third
 World debt problems, especially in Latin America,
 has presented Moscow-as well as Havana-with a
 lucrative target for political exploitation. Soviet per-
 ception of US adroitness in preempting radical change
 in Haiti and the Philippines, the high-profile Ameri-
 can debates over military aid to antigovernment
 forces in Nicaragua and Angola, and the growth of
 official US interest in the problems of low-intensity
 conflict in general also probably contributed to the
 focus on the instruments of neoglobalism.
 Against the background of these developments, Soviet
 discussion of neoglobalism may also reflect a measure
 of genuine concern over US intentions and capabili-
 ties to challenge Soviet interests in the Third World.
 By contrast with more optimistic Soviet writings on
 the Third World from the 1970s and early 1980s,
 current analyses keyed to US neoglobalism paint a
 more problematic picture for Soviet interests. They:
 ? Portray the United States as holding a high degree
 of initiative in the Third World, as opposed to
 previous analyses that showed "progressive forces"
 to be in the ascendance.
 ? Acknowledge the growth of US military forces that
 could be used in Third World conflicts, where
 earlier writings focused on post-Vietnam limitations
 on US use of force abroad.
 ? Say relatively little about the domestic constraints
 on the US administration noted by many commen-
 tators in the 1970s: "realistic elements" of US
 ruling circles, public opinion, and Congress, for
 example.
 ? Fail to depict the Third World economic crisis as a
 source of easy opportunities for Soviet gains, a
 theme previously sounded by some Soviet observers
 of the debt problem.
 Between the lines, writings on US neoglobalism sug-
 gest that, at least for the moment, the global correla-
 tion of forces may not be running in Moscow's favor
 and that the Third World is going to be a difficult and
 potentially treacherous arena for Soviet interests for
 the next few years.
 This image of the United States and the Third World
 may serve Moscow as a useful rationalization of Third
 World policy in a period in which, as evidenced by the
 recent 27th Soviet Party Congress, Soviet leaders
 have apparently decided to concentrate on domestic
 economic revitalization and East-West relations and
 have warned of the limits to Soviet economic aid. In
 this context, "neoglobalism" could be used to justify

 to both internal and external audiences a relatively
 low-profile Soviet approach to the Third World-an
 approach that would not demand a major increase in
 military or economic outlays or cut across Soviet
 efforts to appeal to Western opinion on SDI, arms
 control, and other issues.
 Implications for Soviet Policy
 Neoglobalism probably will continue to be a central
 theme of Soviet propaganda activity in coming
 months. Soviet comments both on US policy toward
 particular countries or regions and on US foreign
 policy in general will play up alleged US neoglobalist
 intentions and the threat they supposedly pose to both
 Third World stability and progress in East-West
 relations. This message will be aimed not only at
 Third World audiences, but at European and Ameri-
 can ones as well. Moscow will try to use the theme to
 influence Western debates on aiding anti-Soviet in-
 surgents and on the relative priority of regional, as
 opposed to arms control, issues. In addition, we expect
 the Soviets and their Cuban allies to feature the
 concept prominently in their attempts to influence
 Third World organizations, including this summer's
 meetings of the Nonaligned Movement in Zimbabwe,
 and in materials they seek to place in the Third World
 media. Finally, Moscow will probably continue to put
 forward regional proposals of its own from time to
 time to polish its image and influence Western delib-
 erations on Third World questions, contrasting its
 initiatives with alleged US neoglobalist behavior.
 The implications of neoglobalism for Soviet operation-
 al policy in the Third World are as yet unclear: the
 concept is still quite "young" as a theoretical formula-
 tion, and the positions of Bovin, Gontar, or, for that
 matter, Gorbachev in any internal debates that may
 be under way over Soviet Third World policy cannot
 yet be fixed with precision. We believe, however, that
 the following preliminary conclusions can be drawn:
 ? The Bovin analysis echoes the arguments of one
 school of Soviet theorists that the securing of Soviet
 gains in the Third World is likely to be a lengthy
 process subject to occasional reversals.
 ? The image of a US administration currently bent on
 belligerent assertion of US interests implicitly cau-
 tions against near-term Soviet risk-taking in the
 Third World.
 ? There is no implication that the USSR ought not try
 to exploit Third World opportunities should they
 arise, particularly if risks are perceived to be low
 and payoffs substantial. There seems to be a warn-
 ing, however, that the benefits of new interventions
 in the Third World should be carefully weighed
 against the expected costs of defending new clients.
 On a broad scale, the neoglobalist focus on the
 problems of defending the revolution in "socialist-
 oriented" regimes against an activist Western chal-
 lenge suggests that at least some Soviet leaders
 believe that Moscow's Third World policy should
 presently be keyed to consolidation and incremental
 advancement rather than militant expansion. Implicit
 in this argument is the tactical prescription that the
 USSR concentrate its material resources on the mili-
 tary defense of existing Third World allies such as
 Afghanistan, Angola, and Ethiopia, while deflecting
 Western involvement in these areas by trying to
 influence international organizations and Western
 political processes.

 Work Position Certification:
 Seeking Hidden Labor Reserves
 The Soviet Union is experiencing an abrupt decline in
 labor force growth. The average annual increment to
 the civilian labor force fell from 2.1 million in the
 1970s to 1.2 million during the period 1981-85 (see
 graph). During the 12th Five-Year Plan period (1986-
 90) the labor force is expected to increase by only 4.1
 million workers, or an average of 0.8 million per year.
 Moreover, much of this increment will come from the
 Central Asian republics, which have a labor surplus,
 rather than from the highly industrialized western
 regions of the country with the greatest demand for
 new labor.
 Despite declining labor force growth, the Soviet lead-
 ership maintains that there is an adequate supply of
 workers and the problem is poor utilization of labor.
 In his report to the CPSU Central Committee on 26
 February 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev criticized "plan-
 ning and economic bodies that permit creation of
 excessive numbers of jobs" as well as enterprises that
 have "the same volume of work as similar organiza-
 tions abroad [but] have a significantly larger number
 of workers." According to an estimate recently pub-
 lished by the State Committee on Labor and Social
 Problems (Goskomtrud), in 1985 the number of job
 slots in industry exceeded the number of available
 workers by 12 percent. A new policy attempts to
 discourage the creation of excess job slots and to
 curtail the pervasive practice of hoarding labor and
 obsolete equipment. This policy-work position certi-
 fication-will compel enterprises to carefully and
 systematically document their workers' jobs and
 equipment.
 Why Soviet Managers Hoard Labor
 Enterprise managers hoard labor as a hedge against
 steadily rising plan targets and normal disruptions in
 work activity associated with erratic supply of materi-
 als and equipment, a problem inherent in the Soviet
 system. When overdue supplies finally arrive at pro-
 duction facilities, surplus workers are needed to make
 up for lost time. They also help in meeting require-
 ments to supply labor for the harvest or special civic
 projects.

 remain roughly constant and that military manpower increases gradually

 b Projected.
 The resulting high labor costs generally are not
 viewed with concern by managers. In practice, any
 savings in labor achieved by an enterprise is likely to
 be taken back by planners the following year. More-
 over, since the number of workers partly determines
 the size of wage and bonus funds, management has
 another incentive to hoard labor. An experiment      25X1
 aimed at easing this problem, begun at the Shchekino
 Chemical Combine in 1967, has achieved only limited
 success (see inset on next page).
 To justify high staffing levels, enterprise managers

 compete for new machinery and construction. This

 Secret
 In 1967 an experiment was initiated at the Shchekino
 Chemical Combine. Under the terms of the experi-
 ment, the combine was allowed to cut its staff while
 maintaining a fixed wage fund and was given the
 right to use a percentage of wage fund savings to
 reward workers who participated in laborsaving prac-
 tices such as combining jobs or taking on more
 machines. The Shchekino method scored quick suc-
 cesses. Hundreds of jobs were eliminated, productivi-
 ty and output increased, and wages rose above the
 national average. The experiment enjoyed official
 favor and spread to hundreds of other enterprises,
 albeit often in diluted form.
 After these initial gains, the Shchekino Combine ran
 into problems. The ministries began to change the
 rules. New instructions were issued a number of
 times, and some of the wage fund savings were taken
 back. Bonus money dwindled, and workers began to
 leave the plant on their own accord. A decade after
 the start of the experiment, the Shchekino Combine
 failed to meet its planned targets. Nevertheless, the
 Shchekino method and new variations of the method
 continue to be promoted by the leadership and offered
 as an option to all enterprises.
 tendency to accumulate plant and machinery to justi-
 fy holding on to labor is reflected in several key
 indicators:
 ? A decline in the shift coefficient of equipment-the
 average number of shifts worked on a piece of
 machinery in 24 hours. (Because of the relative
 shortage of highly skilled workers, the more sophis-
 ticated the machinery, the lower its level of
 utilization.)
 ? The increasing gap between new work positions and
 increments to the supply of labor.
 An Early Attempt To Curtail Labor Hoarding
 Rising Soviet concern over poor utilization of labor in
 the 1970s led to remedial measures under a compre-
 hensive 1979 decree on planning and management.
 First, ministries and enterprises were given personnel
 ceilings and targets for the reduction of manual labor
 positions. Second, regional authorities were tasked
 with drawing up balances in supply and demand for
 workers. Soviet press reports indicated, however, that
 the effectiveness of these measures was minimal,
 largely because reliable, detailed information on labor
 resources and labor requirements was not available.
 In large part, the work position certification program
 is designed to fill the information gap.
 place.
 Work Position Certification
 After several years of preparation, including experi-
 mental application in the Ministry of Agricultural
 Machine Building, a decree on work position certifica-
 tion was issued in August 1985 by the CPSU Central
 Committee and the Central Council of Trade Unions.
 The decree tasks enterprises with preparing a compre-
 hensive inventory and evaluation of every "work
 position"-defined as the work area, materials, and
 equipment associated with the labor of one or more
 workers. The worker's skill level and the technical
 level and condition of machinery are to be evaluated
 along with health and safety conditions in the work-
 Enterprises themselves are tasked with carrying out
 the actual survey, evaluation, and upgrading of work
 positions. Certification committees, composed of en-
 terprise, party, and trade union representatives, are to
 be set up within each enterprise for this purpose.
 The decree envisions that certification data will:
 ? Allow identification of obsolete equipment that can
 be scrapped to free up valuable floorspace, lowering
 requirements for future construction and making it
 harder for managers to justify overstaffing.
 ? Give republic-level government and party officials
 the data needed to plan regional labor balances.
 ? Allow identification of work positions that could be
 converted to part-time or home work for pensioners,
 women with children, and the handicapped.

 Problems in Implementation
 The work certification program has run into a number
 of administrative problems, including foot-dragging
 by managers and poor communications. There have
 been several complaints in the Soviet press about the
 failure of enterprises to conduct work position certifi-
 cation properly. Some enterprise managers have false-
 ly reported completion of the process. Others have
 skipped over auxiliary work positions, which are diffi-
 cult to certify because such workers often do not use
 equipment or have a fixed work station.
 pacities with future labor availability.
 Existing placement bureaus are to relieve the enter-
 prises of much of the burden of retraining and placing
 workers. While workers are not required to accept the
 services of the bureaus, the number of workers placed
 through this system has increased steadily in recent
 years. If successfully implemented, work position cer-
 tification should accelerate this trend.
 Implementation
 We have only limited information about the process of
 implementing the work certification program. Ac-
 cording to Goskomtrud, it was to be extended first
 throughout the machine-building industry, reflecting
 the sector's increased priority under Gorbachev. The
 program was then to move on to other industrial
 enterprises and be fully applied throughout the rest of
 the economy by the end of 1987. According to the
 decree, enterprises must conduct the certification
 process at least twice during each five-year plan
 period.
 In February 1986 Goskomtrud reported that 38 per-
 cent of industrial enterprises had completed, or nearly
 completed, work position certification. According to
 the same report, the program has been successful in
 enterprises where certification "is conducted in a
 businesslike fashion, and not as a mere formality." It
 is not clear what percentage of enterprises fit into this
 category. No other figures have been given to indicate
 the overall progress of the program.
 The Soviets have published information on the pro-
 gress of implementation within some ministries. The
 Ministry of Agricultural Machine Building was cited
 as a positive example for having eliminated 25,000
 work positions, released 35,000 workers, and retired
 60 million rubles' worth of equipment. The Ministry
 of Machine Building for Animal Husbandry and
 Fodder Production achieved far less success. Only
 25.5 percent of the work positions in this ministry
 were surveyed, and of the 22,500 positions surveyed,
 only 250 were eliminated. Moreover, some press
 articles charge that many of the workers reportedly
 "freed up" by the elimination of work positions were
 moved to another shift or to other jobs within the
 same factory.
 Enterprise managers find it disadvantageous to carry
 out the certification process properly for a number of
 reasons. The process itself is labor intensive. The
 inventory and evaluation, if done according to the
 rules, takes weeks to complete. Workers serving on
 certification committees are taken away from their
 regular duties. Once the inventory is complete, there
 are further problems. Substandard work positions
 must be upgraded, new equipment and parts ordered,
 and construction workers and assemblers engaged.
 Here, again, there are delays and shortages of materi-
 als and equipment.
 According to press articles, the flow of information on
 the certification program between enterprises, minis-
 tries, departments, and research institutes has been
 anything but smooth. There have been complaints of
 confusion, conflicting and incomplete guidelines, and
 missing documents. Plans to improve communication
 and ease the administrative burden by automating the
 processing of certification data are not likely to be
 realized in the near future. Finally, there has been a
 lack of coordination between the planners who are
 supposed to use the results of certification and the
 administrators who draw up guidelines for the pro-
 gram in each industry. The specifics of how planners
 are to use certification data have yet to be worked out.
 Prospects
 The work position certification program will continue
 to face substantial implementation problems, which
 may even increase as the program spreads into work

 activities inherently difficult to define, such as those
 in consumer services and agriculture. Although enter-
 prises can be denied access to investment funds if they
 do not certify work positions, the absence of effective
 penalties for failure to conduct the process properly
 threatens not only the pace of implementation but also
 the quality of the information collected. Clearly,
 unreliable data would be of little use to planners in
 determining labor requirements and could even lead
 to decisions that would increase the misallocation of
 labor. Moreover, even if the program were to lead to
 the release of substantial numbers of workers, it is not
 clear that they could be effectively reallocated. The
 workers released are likely to be the least skilled and
 least motivated. Placing them in new jobs may be
 difficult without extensive retraining and an improved
 system for matching jobs with workers.

 Soviet Leadership?
 Many new, energetic workers of the modern mold
 have recently been put forward into responsible
 posts ... Women are being more actively brought
 forward into leadership positions. There are now
 more of them in party and soviet organs.
 Mikhail S. Gorbachev
 at the 27th CPSU Congress
 Historical Legacy
 Since the revolution, Soviet women have made up an
 increasing percentage of the work force and the party
 apparatus; they have not, however, managed to play
 more than a token role in the top leadership. Lenin's
 wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, was the first Soviet wom-
 an to hold a position of power, serving briefly as a
 member of the Secretariat of the Bolshevik Party.
 Krupskaya remained essentially an adjunct of Lenin
 during his lifetime, and, after his death, retained
 prestige but little power. Yekaterina Furtseva, a
 favorite of Khrushchev, was the only woman ever to
 serve on the Politburo, and she was relegated to the
 less vital duties of the ministry of culture. Her career
 ended ignominiously with charges of corruption and
 her sudden death.
 A Matter of Policy
 The issue of promoting women to leadership positions
 has been raised as a matter of policy by the Gorba-
 chev regime in a series of official documents and
 speeches. The CPSU Program adopted at the 27th
 Congress called for the party to "more actively nomi-
 nate women for leadership work." This phrase put an
 official stamp on a concern that Gorbachev had
 expressed previously at the April 1985 plenum, name-
 ly the need to engender "more active movement of
 leading cadres" by means that would include promot-
 ing women "to responsible posts with greater bold-
 ness." In the February 1986 Political Report of the
 Central Committee, Gorbachev again addressed this
 matter in speaking of "invigorating the party leader-
 ship," claiming that "women are being more actively
 brought forward into leadership positions" and adding
 that "there are now more of them in party and soviet
 organs."
 goods, domestic trade, and labor affairs.
 Biryukova: A Member in Her Own Right
 The regime's most visible move to expand the number
 of women in the leadership was the promotion to the
 Secretariat of Aleksandra Biryukova.' Although Bir-
 yukova will undoubtedly be expected to serve as a
 spokesperson on women's issues, she also has an
 important portfolio. Her responsibilities appear to
 include light industry and the production of consumer
 In addressing women's issues, Biryukova breaks no
 new ground. She praises Soviet women for their
 progress and achievements to date. She promises no
 more than what already has been outlined in the latest
 five-year plan. She compares favorably the conditions
 faced by Soviet women with those faced by women in
 other countries, specifically lauding the Soviet
 woman's supposed equal opportunity in education, her
 right to work, and her right to equal pay. Finally, as
 befits Soviet tradition, Biryukova reserves her greatest
 praise for the Soviet woman in that "lofty and fine
 mission-to be a mother."
 Since her appointment to the Secretariat, Biryukova's
 only public speeches have been made on International
 Women's Day and, therefore, have centered around
 women's issues. However, she has taken part in a
 fairly wide range of public activities. In a recent
 Moscow radio interview, Biryukova credited herself
 with a role in the development of a "new economic
 mechanism" designed to dramatically improve the
 quality and assortment of consumer goods and ser-
 vices but described her main task in the Secretariat as
 overseeing the "technical retooling of the sector."
 ' It is possible that Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, has influenced her
 husband in his deliberations regarding the appointment of women
 to leadership positions. She herself has a doctorate in philosophical
 science from the prestigious Moscow State University. Also, since
 Gorbachev became General Secretary, she and the wives of other

 Aleksandra Pavlovna Biryu-
 kova (Phonetic: beeryooKOvah)
 Secretary, Central Committee
 CPSU (since March 1986)
 Biryukova has boasted of her humble origins, saying
 that her ancestors for many generations were "peas-
 ants of the lowest rank. " She herself grew up learning
 farm work.
 Her future took a more urban turn as she graduated
 from the Moscow Textile Institute, wrote her doctor-
 al dissertation, and joined the ranks of the engineer-
 ing profession. In 1964, at the age of 35, Biryukova
 became chief engineer at the Trekhgornaya Moscow
 Cotton Combine. In 1968 she became a secretary of
 the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions
 (AUCCTU), and in 1985, its deputy chairman.
 Biryukova was elected a candidate member of the
 Central Committee in 1971, and a member in 1976.
 She has participated in many conferences on women's
 issues, including a 1984 meeting in New York of the
 UN Commission on Elimination of Discrimination
 Toward Women and the 1985 UN Decade for Women
 Conference in Nairobi.
 Competition for the Top Spot
 There were apparently few contenders for the top spot
 accorded to Biryukova. According to the US Embassy
 in Moscow, a Soviet correspondent claims that Gorba-
 chev demanded that a woman be represented in the
 Secretariat, and Biryukova was his choice. There were
 reportedly two other candidates: Valentina Shev-
 chenko and Valentina Tereshkova. Before the 27th
 Congress, Shevchenko was the highest ranking Soviet
 woman because of her position as chairman of the
 Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and deputy chairman of
 the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet. Teresh-
 kova's claim to fame was her role as cosmonaut, a role
 to which she was propelled on the basis of her
 experience as an amateur parachutist. According to
 the correspondent, Gorbachev personally picked Bir-
 yukova over Shevchenko and Tereshkova because
 Biryukova was more "dynamic and aggressive."
 Getting the Numbers Up
 The regime also has taken steps below the level of the
 Secretariat to demonstrate that it intends to fulfill its
 promise to place more women in senior positions. In a
 report to the CPSU congress, Georgiy Razumovskiy,
 the new CPSU secretary in charge of personnel
 appointments, described the increasing number of
 women in party leadership positions:
 The number of women in the party increases
 from year to year, from congress to congress;
 there are more of them within the elective party
 bodies; more of them are rising to the leader-
 ship of various sectors in the building of Com-
 munism. Their number among the delegates of
 the party congresses, too, is increasing constant-
 ly: 1,352 women have been elected to the 27th
 Congress; this is 27 percent of all delegates.
 This is the highest number-in absolute as well
 as in percentage terms-in the whole history of
 the CPSU.
 barely enough to justify the claim of progress.
 On the basis of figures cited at the 26th Congress by
 Ivan Kapitonov, then secretary for party personnel,
 the number of female delegates shows an increase of
 1.7 percent from the 1,329 female delegates in 1981,
 This increase in the number of female congress
 delegates reflects in part the expanding but still
 limited number of women in the party. According to
 published data, 8 percent of party members in 1920

 very few women: eight in 1981 and nine in 1986. For
 the most part, the same women who held positions at
 this level in 1981 continued to do so in 1986, the
 difference being that in 1981 most of the women were

 most became full bureau members and/or members
 of the secretariat.
 Women in the Labor Force
 The dearth of women of substance at various levels of
 the party structure or in management positions in the
 labor force is a reflection of the role of women in
 Soviet society. Soviet women have enjoyed substantial
 achievement in terms of education and participation
 in the labor force. About 85 percent of women 16 to
 55 years old work, probably the highest rate in the
 world. However, despite the achievements, there tends
 to be an inverse relationship between rate of pay and
 the proportion of women in a particular occupation or
 sector. Women tend to predominate in sectors with
 relatively low pay.
 Soviet women are expected to be mothers first and
 foremost, and to work all the while. Party propaganda
 reinforces the characterization of women as mother-
 workers, with the purpose of fostering an increase in
 the labor supply. Statements on the rewards of moth-
 erhood, in particular, are much more voluminous than
 the few references to women in leadership. Moreover,
 the persistence of traditional male attitudes toward
 women is likely to restrict their advancement. Soviet

 males generally expect women to take full care of the
 home and the family, while holding less prestigious
 and less powerful positions in the work force.
 Outlook: Tokens at the Top
 The regime has taken concrete, if limited, measures to
 expand the role of women in the leadership. If the
 issue of the promotion of women were being raised
 simply in the context of improving the lot of women,
 we might easily assume that the talk was propaganda.
 But the fact that the promotion of women is described
 as one means of achieving a revitalized party cadre, a
 cadre that is to invigorate the economy, suggests` that
 we may be seeing the beginnings of a new policy
 approach.
 Biryukova conceivably could be moved up further, to
 the Politburo, if Gorbachev wants to show he means
 business. There are few women at the top, however, in
 a position to ride on her coattails. Outside of Shev-
 chenko and Tereshkova, the only other. women who
 are full members of the Central Committee and
 whose jobs have some political substance are Yevdo-

 government/party apparatus.
 At the Central Committee level, we have so far
 witnessed largely token efforts to increase the partici-
 pation of women. If the regime is to take up the
 banner of the advancement of women, it will need to
 do something more substantial than adding a few
 milkmaids and spinners. After all, membership in the
 Central Committee is largely contingent on holding
 leadership positions in the ministries of the regional
 long-term problem.
 If Gorbachev were seriously to tackle the issue of
 promoting women to the leadership, he would need to
 address the root of the matter, which is societal in
 nature. Constrained by the demands of work, family,
 and household duties, Soviet women have little time
 or energy left to devote to the party. One recent Soviet
 survey shows that working women spend more than 30
 hours a week on shopping and housework, while on
 average men spend only 15 hours a week on household
 chores. Two steps which could be taken to alleviate
 some of these burdens would be to increase the
 availability of consumer goods and foodstuffs and
 improve child care facilities. However, the signs point
 in the opposite direction. The yardstick for the econo-
 my continues to be that traditionally male bastion,
 heavy industry, while light industry and consumer
 matters are left in the hands of a woman, Biryukova.
 As for child care, rather than lessening the demands
 on women by improving child care facilities, the new
 five-year plan promises more maternity leave to allow
 women to stay with their newborn a little longer,
 thereby providing only a temporary respite from a
 mote women only where it serves that purpose.
 Overall, the prospects for moving beyond the token-
 ism of women in the leadership are limited by the
 relatively low position that the issue probably holds on
 Gorbachev's agenda. Gorbachev's priority is to im-
 prove the economy, and he can be expected to pro-

 Viewpoint
 The views expressed in the following article are the authors' and do not
 necessarily represent a CIA consensus.
 Access Challenge
 The Soviets have traditionally welcomed, if they have
 not initiated, GDR probes to erode Allied rights in
 Berlin, granted in wartime, in immediate postwar
 agreements, and under the Quadripartite Agreement
 (QA) of 1971. Nevertheless, they have customarily
 avoided letting events approach a crisis.
 The current challenge to Western rights in Berlin
 began on 21 May 1986, when the East Germans
 announced that as of 26 May accredited diplomats
 crossing to and from West Berlin would have to
 present their passports instead of identity documents
 ("red cards") from the GDR Foreign Ministry. All
 diplomats not accredited to the GDR entering East
 Berlin after the 26th would have to have an East
 German visa unless there was a prior agreement it
 was not needed. Ambiguous wording in the GDR
 announcement left open the possibility that the three
 Western QA military missions in West Berlin and
 their embassies in East Berlin would be exempt from
 the new controls. On 23 May, in response to a US
 demarche, a Soviet spokesman noted that "military
 administrations" would not be affected.
 The new controls went into effect on the 26th.
 Western military mission access was not affected, and
 US, British, and French diplomats accredited to the
 GDR were allowed to cross sector boundaries in
 Berlin using their red cards. They were warned,
 however, that they would have to show passports in
 the future. All other diplomats were turned back
 unless they showed passports. On the 29th the East
 Germans formally exempted US, UK, and French
 officials stationed in both East and West Berlin from
 the new passport controls. To avoid showing passports
 at Berlin sector crossings, nonexempt NATO diplo-
 mats began to take circuitous routes through recog-
 nized East German territory to enter East Berlin. The
 Soviets stated that they had interceded with the East
 Germans to the extent they were able and that the
 GDR was competent to decide the documentation it
 required for travel into East Berlin.
 On 7 June, in a major retreat, the East German
 Foreign Ministry announced that it would issue new
 "forgery-proof" diplomatic ID cards to replace the
 red cards and would drop the passport requirement.
 The announcement, however, did not explicitly re-
 scind the visa requirement for Allied officials other
 than US, British, or French traveling from West
 Berlin-most notably from military missions and
 consulates accredited to the Allies there. Recently the
 East Germans allowed military officers from Den-
 mark and Belgium to cross sector points without visas,
 a concession that suggests they will also compromise
 on these remaining controls. The GDR announce-
 ment, however, continued to refer to the sector cross-
 ing sites as "border crossing points," upholding the
 East German view that East Berlin is part of the
 GDR rather than part of a greater Berlin subject to
 the QA.
 We do not yet have sufficient evidence to reconstruct
 Soviet-East German handling of the Berlin access
 challenge. Privately, representatives from both coun-
 tries provided the disingenuous explanation that the
 new controls were only an effort to meet Western

 concerns about terrorists crossing between the sectors.
 It is more likely that the GDR seized the opportunity
 offered by the La Belle discotheque bombing in West
 Berlin and intense US pressure regarding Libyan
 activities in East Berlin to assert its long-claimed
 sovereign right to demand formal travel documenta-
 tion at the Berlin crossing points. We believe the East
 Germans received approval for a challenge during
 talks between Gorbachev and Honecker during the
 latter's visit to East Berlin in late April. We also
 believe that the decision to act on the access question
 became increasingly attractive in both Moscow and
 East Berlin because of their growing isolation on the
 terrorist issue as West European states took action
 against the Libyan People's Bureaus.
 Moscow and the Germanies
 The timing of the recent challenge, following earlier
 Soviet willingness to defuse a dispute involving man-
 agement of the Berlin traffic air corridor in February
 1986, supports                  that the East
 Germans took the lead in instigating the current
 confrontation. Embassy             reporting
 also indicates a growing sense of
 East German assertiveness in the Bloc, which the
 Soviets themselves have inadvertently fed with public
 praise of Honecker's economic policy. East German
 self-congratulation reached a new peak at the East
 German Communist (SED) Party Congress in April,
 which Gorbachev attended.
 Gorbachev's presence signified Moscow's strong sup-
 port for Honecker and the East German "model."
 Nevertheless, Gorbachev's harsh public criticism of
 the FRG at the party congress suggests he also
 carried the deflating message that the Soviets had
 decided not to permit Honecker to visit Bonn this
 year. Such a message would have deprived Honecker's
 regime of a politically important gain and would have
 diminished the impact of Gorbachev's visit to the
 GDR. Further, by implication, Gorbachev's criticism
 of the FRG suggested that Honecker, whose criticism
 had been much milder, had been too friendly with the
 other Germany. By pushing the new controls, the East
 Germans may have hoped to convince Moscow that
 they too could be hard on Kohl.
 We speculate that, to placate ruffled East German
 feelings, the Soviets probably gave Honecker the
 green light to push for recognition of East German
 sovereignty by the West at a traditional pressure
 point-West Berlin-
 going to take the lead
 We doubt, however, that
 Honecker and Gorbachev would have discussed the
 actual details of this challenge, and almost certainly
 neither anticipated an evolution leading to a signifi-
 cant GDR retreat. A general discussion, however,
 would fit well with Gorbachev's new leadership style
 in Eastern Europe, which combines firmness in laying
 down markers in face-to-face bilateral talks with
 restraint regarding micromanagement of detail. He
 probably also told Honecker that, while the Soviets
 would rhetorically support the GDR, they wanted no
 crisis in Berlin that could call into question their own
 privileges under the QA. The implication would have
 been that the GDR would have to take the political
 consequences of its action.
 Moscow probably also saw the GDR challenge as a
 chance to create mischief for the Kohl government.-
 The Soviets had already stiffened their criticism of
 Kohl for support of SDI and the US binary chemical
 weapons program. They undoubtedly welcomed a new
 opportunity to embarrass him by underscoring West
 Germany's lack of leverage in Berlin and by forcing
 him to choose between rigid support for the QA or ar
 "reasonable" position on control of terrorism.
 Moscow might also have calculated that the challenge
 had the potential to create political problems for Kohl
 during an election campaign. He is already under fire
 by the opposition SPD for an unimaginative German
 policy. Moscow must indeed have been cheered by
 public assertions by senior SPD opposition politi-
 cians-principally Egon Bahr-that the current pass-
 port issue could have been resolved, essentially on
 GDR terms. Thus, from Moscow's view, the current
 challenge in a single stroke promised to bring discom-
 fort to Kohl while permitting the SPD to line up on
 the side of the "angels," in opposition to the CDU and

 its US "sponsor." Furthermore, while not threatening
 to cut off the intra-German dialogue so important to
 the East Germans, the challenge enhanced the impor-
 tance of the SPD as East Germany's principal inter-
 claims and drive wedges into NATO.
 Moscow's West European Policy
 and the Berlin Question
 Under Gorbachev the Soviets have emphasized to the
 West Europeans that they share a common home-
 with continental interests, apart from those of the
 United States. Moscow, however, remains aware that
 the Berlin question is a two-edged sword and, if
 allowed to develop into a crisis, tends to solidify
 NATO in defense of the status quo. By emphasizing
 "technical" issues during the challenge rather than
 fundamental principles governing Berlin's unique sta-
 tus, East Germany sought to avoid a crisis while
 attempting to undermine NATO's position on move-
 ment within Berlin. In the past such "technical"
 challenges have indeed caused disarray in NATO.
 Doubtless, both the USSR and the GDR thought they
 had a similar chance this time to slice away at Allied
 sovereignty within the divided city.
 The current challenge has magnified the status differ-
 ences between most NATO members and the three
 NATO occupying powers. The latter were initially
 "exempted" from the new passport controls, thus
 creating awkward "hierarchies" for NATO. Travel
 hardships were greatest for nonexempt NATO mem-
 bers-those who traditionally have had little stake or
 input in codifying the technical rites embodying the
 "Berlin theology." Meanwhile Moscow's intercession
 to exempt US, British, and French personnel from the
 use of passports was portrayed by the Soviets as a
 reasonable attempt to find a compromise that would
 uphold respect for the QA-but one which, neverthe-
 less, would underscore Moscow's position on GDR
 The challenge also has reminded the West Germans
 how uniquely vulnerable they are in Berlin. Indeed,
 since the GDR actions, some prominent West Ger-
 mans have advocated the use of passports for "identi-
 fication" purposes only, illustrating the extent to
 which some elements in the FRG view their Berlin
 interests as divergent from those of the three Allied
 powers. The challenge also reminded the three powers
 how vulnerable they are to an Eastern probe designed
 to divide them from Bonn. Both the USSR and GDR
 apparently misjudged the potential depth of a split
 between West Germany and the other Allies over the
 challenge. Had either the Soviets or East Germans
 realized the extent of Bonn's apparent wavering, they
 might not have backed off so quickly or so far.
 Implications
 The recent Berlin access challenge apparently sought
 to harmonize separate Soviet and East German inter-
 ests in the transcendent objective of weakening
 NATO solidarity over Berlin and dividing West Ger-
 man opinion. Moscow probably meant to provide a
 demonstration, for the Bloc, of Gorbachev's ability to
 dovetail competing Soviet-East European interests
 rather than to simply ride roughshod over East Euro-
 pean sensibilities.
 For the Soviets, the GDR challenge apparently com-
 bined opportunity with low risk. They probably made
 it clear to Honecker that any East German equities in
 a challenge could not threaten Moscow's broader
 East-West concerns. This would explain both Mos-
 cow's rather low-key backing of its ally during this
 challenge and its efforts to convince the West that it
 was not responsible for East German actions in the
 GDR's "sovereign" capital. The Soviets probably also
 remained wary of appearing too supportive of East
 German assertions of sovereignty that ran counter to
 Moscow's own demands for increased Bloc unity on
 foreign policy matters. While appearing to moderate
 the most extreme of the GDR's original demands by
 securing exemptions for the three Allied powers, the
 Soviets still subtly reminded Washington that they
 retain leverage at Berlin and can create or ameliorate
 troubling challenges there to the West almost at will.
