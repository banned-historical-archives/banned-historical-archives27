 PROPAGANDA EVIDENCES CONCERNING
 SINO-SOVIET RE1ATIO1
 (An analysis of Soviet and Chinese comment on the 1951
 and 1952 anniversaries of the Sino-Soviet treaty)
 A detailed study of Chinese and Soviet press and radio propaganda
 surrounding the 1951 and 1952 anniversaries of the Sino-Soviet
 Treaty of Friendship.. Alliance, and Mutual Assistance suggests
 that:
 1.  There are differences concerning Soviet aid to
 China.  The issue of Soviet aid is related to
 the Korean war.
 2.  There appears to be a minor struggle to determine
 China's status in the Communist orbit.  The
 evidence, however, does not point to the possibility
 of a Chinese "Titoist break."
 3.  A divergence of interests is developing with regard
 to Japan.  (The evidence is less firm here than in
 the preceding cases.)
 4.  Despite possible differences, the similarity in
 volume and direction of Chinese and Soviet propa-
 ganda indicates that relations have not deteriorated.
 5.  The Soviet Union is not making a concerted effort to
 "woo" a disgruntled China.
 6.  Soviet broadcasts to China are clearly avoiding the
 subject of Soviet advisors in China.
 7.  China is sensitive regarding the portrait of its
 ideological role which is presented to the Chinese
 people.

 GENERAL APPROACH
 FDD-FBID have proceeded on the assumption that neither Soviet nor
 Chinese propaganda would directly express annoyance or hostility to
 or about each other.  It was felt that some variations might appear
 which would indirectly reflect the existence of difficulties between
 the partners and which could not be explained away on the grounds
 of propaganda techniques.  (For example, it has been claimed that
 Soviet failure to comment on the Far Eastern situation to the same
 extent as China revealed difficulties between the two.  The fact is,
 however, that Moscow is habitually more general in its comments on
 local situations than is the propaganda of the orbit state immediately
 concerned, e.g. East Germany on Germany, the Satellites on Yugoslavia,
 China on Southeast Asia, etc.)  Therefore, FDD-FBID scrutinized the
 appearance, deletion, and shifts in emphasis on the propaganda themes
 used in the celebration of the Sino-Soviet anniversary in 1951 and 1952.
 In the absence of firm objective intelligence on the nature and
 direction of possible animosities between the Soviet Union and
 China, two methods were used in examining the propaganda evidence
 available:
 1.  The propaganda data was examined to see whether
 any of the differences in propaganda emphasis
 might suggest areas of disagreement.
 2.  The existence of differences was posited, propa-
 ganda policies were deduced in the light of these
 assumed differences (chiefly in terms of themes to
 be emphasized or avoided), and then the propaganda
 evidence was examined to see whether the patterns
 observed supported or contradicted the propaganda
 policies deduced.
 FDD-FBID has attempted herewith not only to present the propaganda
 "facts" but has also attempted to offer possible tentative explanations
 of the observed differences.  It was felt that the data would be more
 valuable if the hypotheses and inferences were presented explicitly
 ?      rather than implicitly.  The observations made in this paper are drawn
 from propaganda alone.
 This report is given in four sections:  Section I discusses possible
 areas of discord suggested by the propaganda, Section II presents the
 evidence suggesting harmonious relations, Section III outlines
 deductively what propaganda elements would be present if the Soviets
 were attempting to appease a disgruntled China and then examines the
 evidence in the light of these assumptions, and finally Section IV
 presents certain observations of general relevance to the subject of
 Sino-Soviet relations.

 SECTION I -- AREAS OF DISCORD
 The propaganda behavior of Communist China and the Soviet Union gives
 no indication of a general deterioration of relations between these
 two states.   There are indications, however, that several points of
 friction may exist (at least as of February 1952) and that these
 areas of difficulty primarily concern the interests of the Chinese
 People's Republic.
 1.   There appear to be differences concerning Soviet
 aid to China.  The issue of aid is apparently
 connected with the Korean war.
 2.   It seems possible that a struggle may be in
 process over the delineation of Communist China's
 status in the Communist world.  This struggle
 does not appear to be crucial at present; that
 is, it does not appear to warrant predictions of
 a "Titoist break."
 3.   There are indications of a possible clash of
 interests regarding Japan, but the propaganda
 evidence is less than in the preceding cases.
 1.   Indications of Differences Concerning Soviet Aid to China:  The
 most marked differences in Soviet and Chinese propaganda about the
 anniversaries of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and
 Mutual Assistance is related to Soviet aid to China.  In 1951 Chinese
 propaganda media gave somewhat more stress to this topic than did
 Soviet media.  Such propaganda behavior seems appropriate to a
 situation in which a grateful China assumes the major burden of
 publicizing the Soviet gesture.
 In 1952, however, the situation was completely reversed.  Chinese
 sources sharply reduced their attention to Soviet aid, while the
 Soviet media showed a marked rise in attention to the topic.  The
 shift appears more meaningful in view of the fact that the Sino-Soviet
 patterns of attention to most of the other categories remained
 approximately the same.
 Another significant change in the propaganda pattern concerns attention
 to "Western aggression."  In 1951, both Chinese and Soviet media gave
 major attention to this topic, Soviet sources giving it slightly
 more stress.  Again, such propaganda behavior seems appropriate to the
 objective situation.  Communist China was at war with the West in
 Korea, and for the Soviet media to make bellicose charges against the
 West in the same volume as China bespoke accord concerning the war
 in Korea.
 A year later, however, Soviet attention to Western aggression was
 considerably less, while Chinese attention remained much as it was
 in 1951.  Paralleling this development, there was a decrease in

 Soviet attention to Korea per se* while China maintained attention
 to this area at about the same level as that of 1951.
 Third, there was a sharp decline in the volume of both sides'
 references to collaboration and cooperation.      In 1951 both gave
 considerable attention to this subject; this would seem to be an
 appropriate propaganda reflection of harmonious relations between
 the two.  In 1952, both made significantly fever references to
 this subject.
 These appear to be the major differences in Communist Chinese and
 Soviet propaganda which reflect a possible area of discord between
 the two nations.  In each case, there was a shift away from that
 propaganda behavior which appeared most commensurate with mutually
 satisfactory relations.
 Assuming that the drain of the Korean war has been a major factor
 contributing to China's need for aid, these propaganda developments
 may be inter-related.  The decrease of attention to Soviet aid in
 the Chinese media, at a time when the Chinese audience most required
 such assurance, may reflect Chinese dissatisfaction concerning aid.
 General agreement in de-emphasizing the topic is precluded by the
 increased Soviet attention.  The increased Soviet attention to the
 subject of aid suggests an attempt to appease Chinese dissatisfaction
 and to compensate for the Chinese de-emphasis.
 The drop in Soviet attention to Western aggression and to the Korean
 war and continued Chinese attention to these subjects seems to
 indicate a change of Soviet attitudes and tactics, which China,
 because of its vital interests, did not wish to parallel.  This
 inferred difference of interests regarding Korea lends itself to a
 logical construction of the propaganda picture--the Soviet audience
 hears less about China's major problem, Korea, and more about Soviet
 aid to China; the Chinese audience, on the other hand, still hears
 a great deal about China's struggle in Korea, and much less about the
 aid it is receiving.
 It therefore appears that the simultaneous decrease in attention to
 Sino-Soviet collaboration may be a consequence of the above two
 developments, and may well be a reflection of fact:  if differences
 have arisen over Soviet aid, then collaboration, at least on these
 points, has probably been reduced.  Furthermore, since declarations
 of collaboration and cooperation usually involve  an issue to be
 "collaborated on," it may be possible that both sides are reluctant
 to be committed to the other on specific matters because of their
 differing interests.
 * It should be noted that there was a general decline in attention
 to aggression charges and to the Korean war between the first quarter
 of 1951 and the first quarter of 1952.  It was not possible to
 determine whether the anniversary propaganda was directly affected
 by the general decline.

 2.   Individualization and the Struggle for Status:  Chinese media
 show a distinct tendency to focus on China     as opposed to focusing
 on mutual relations).  This individualization was developed at the
 expense of references to China and the Soviet Union as acting in
 concert or having similar or identical motives, purposes, or in-
 tentions.  It also occurred at the expense of individual references
 to the Soviet Union.   Specifically, the Chinese press and radio in
 1952 talked more about China, less about the Soviet Union, and less
 about the two together.  The Soviet press and radio in 1952, on the
 other hand, behaved as it did in 1951, maintaining and even
 increasing slightly the generally high level of mutual references.
 Soviet sources did show one marked change, however:  there was a
 sharp increase in the number of individual references to the Soviet
 Union's contributions to China.
 This tendency toward individualization and self-depiction evident
 in the Chinese media coincides with the ever-enlarging role of
 Communist China in world and orbit affairs, and as such, this co-
 incidence may reflect the Chinese leaders' awareness of China's
 world status.  The only significant change in the Soviet media was
 the increased attention to the Soviet Union itself.  Therefore, it
 appears that Soviet propaganda reacted to the drop in attention to
 the USSR in the Chinese media by coupling an emphasis on the USSR
 with its basic effort to identify the purposes and policies of the
 two countries.
 Although these developments suggest a Chinese effort to have China's
 status defined in a satisfactory measure, there are qualifying
 elements which suggest that this shift is a matter of "normal
 politiking" between China and the Communist world and the Soviet
 Union in particular.  In other words, the qualifying evidence
 contradicts the possibility that China's dissatisfaction is
 sufficiently great that it would consider rapprochement with the
 West as an alternative to decreasing its aspirations for intra-
 orbit status.  Specifically, Chinese media increase attention to
 the theme that the Soviet Union is the "teacher" or source of guidance
 for China.  This increase is within a low numerical range, but exists,
 nonetheless. Also, although Soviet sources showed a marked increase
 of individual self-references, the level of individual references to
 China was increased in 1952, and these, as in 1951, were concerned
 with the achievements of Communist China.  The fact that China pro-
 motes the idea of Soviet leadership and guidance appears to modify
 its struggle for status to a matter of"politiking'for position within
 a range whose extremes are marked by satellite status and favored
 lieutenant of the Soviet Union.  The Soviet propaganda tributes to
 China's successes indicate that the Soviet Union is certainly not
 playing down China's role in the Communist camp.  Also, the area of
 harmony in the propaganda of both nations is of sufficient breadth
 to suggest general accord.
 3.   The Difference in Attention to Japan:  In 1951 both nations de-
 voted considerable attention to Japan as a source of aggression in
 the Far East.  In 1952, on the other hand., there was a basic change
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/02 : CIA-RDP79RO1012AO01800010011-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/02 : CIA-RDP79R01012A001800010011-1
 in the pattern of attention to Japan.  In 1951 Japan received
 almost parallel attention from both Chinese and Soviet sources
 and in 1952 both nations diminished attention to Japan.  Soviet
 attention declined more sharply with Chinese sources giving it
 attention about four times as great as the Soviet media.  One
 factor accentuating this changed propaganda relationship is the
 fact that in 1951 a campaign against Japanese rearmament was in
 full swing on the Chinese mainland when the Sino-Soviet Pact
 anniversary occurred.  Therefore, some drop in attention to Japan
 could be expected from Chinese media in 1952 when no such campaign
 was in progress.  But there is no such ready explanation for the
 drop in Soviet attention to Japan.  One factor which may be related
 to the decreased Soviet attention was the Stalin message of friend-
 ship to the Japanese people which was sent only a few weeks before
 the Pact anniversary.
 Attention to Japan, as recorded in this project, appears to be a
 function of attention to the subject of aggression for the largest
 single decrease of attention to Japan occurs in the aggression
 category.  Decreased Soviet attention to Japan and aggression in
 the Japanese context, then, coincides with the over-all changes in
 Soviet propaganda and the possible changes in attitude or tactics
 which the propaganda changes may reflect.
 But China's propaganda attention suggests no change of attitude
 toward Japan.  Therefore, it appears that Soviet attitudes or
 tactics may diverge from the Chinese pattern.  This in turn suggests
 the possibility of a shift away from the compatibility which formerly
 marked Sino-Soviet attitudes toward Japan.

 SECTION II -- EVIDENCES OF SINO-SOVIET ACCORD
 While there is some propaganda evidence to suggest the above-
 mentioned areas of discord in Sino-Soviet relations, the primary
 characteristics of the comment suggest general accord between the
 two nations.  At least they do not indicate a state of general
 discord between them.  Both nations give comparable and high-level
 attention to Sino-Soviet friendship.  Chinese attention underwent
 a slight decline, but remained at a high level, while Soviet
 attention increased within a high-level range.  The treatment of
 strength, peaceful intent, and resistance to aggression was
 basically the same in Soviet and Chinese propaganda in 1951 and
 1952.  More significant, perhaps, is the fact that China increased
 attention to the leadership and guidance of the Soviet Union.
 Also significant is the decline in the media of both nations of
 references to equality.
 Although the increased Chinese tendency toward individualization
 suggests some friction stemming from China's desire for individual
 status, the total pictureespecially the elements listed above-seems
 to indicate basic agreement.  This is substantiated by the Soviet
 sources' endorsement of China's self-praise, that is, both sides
 gave comparable, high-level attention to Chinese achievements.  The
 failure of China to sustain or increase references to the topic of
 equality coincides with Soviet de-emphasis on this subject and
 suggests, therefore, some measure of agreement between the two on
 the exploitation of this significant theme.

 SECTION III -- THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH
 Because of the lack of time, this section will not attempt to out-
 line all the major possible combinations of annoyance or accord
 between the two partners.  Rather, one particular situation has been
 assumed for purposes of analysis and has been elaborated for
 illustrative purposes.  The situation chosen seemed at least as
 plausible as others that might have been chosen.
 On the purely hypothetical assumption that there were difficulties
 between the USSR and China of a serious enough nature to be
 reflected in the propaganda, an attempt has been made to posit how
 the Soviet Union might alter its themes in order to appeal to its
 partner.  For this purpose, it is specifically assumed that the
 Chinese Communists are annoyed with their Soviet partners and that
 the latter are attempting to ameliorate this feeling.
 1.  Statements Which Moscow Might Play Down or Completely Ignore:
 a.  The USSR is the teacher, model or guide for China (in
 order to avoid offending Chinese nationalist sentiments.)
 While this category is low, it remains remark-
 ably level with last year's attention.  More-
 over, in three elite sources* it has increased
 slightly but consistently from 1950 through
 1952.  The absence of a decrease does not
 suggest a Soviet desire to avoid the possibility
 of offending its partner.
 b.  "Need" statements, namely, that Soviet backing of China is
 a prerequisite to Chinese advance, current and historical.
 While such claims are extremely infrequent
 (less than 1%), there has been a slight
 increase (although the difference is not
 statistically significant.)  In any event,
 they do not disappear from Soviet output
 entirely.  In one case, however, a "need"
 statement was edited out of a Home Service
 commentary when the commentary was broadcast
 in Mandarin.  Again, the fact that Soviet
 propaganda does not take pains to completely
 eliminate these statements does not demonstrate
 extreme sensitivity to Chinese feelings.
 * A comparison was made of the same three sources--editorials in
 PRAVDA, IZVESTIA, and LITERARY GAZETTE--over a three-year period,
 thus including comment on the occasion of the signing of the
 original pact.  This allows a more reliable perspective on the
 nature of the comment.

 c.                           Claims that the two powers' "interests"* are served by the
 Pact (in order to avoid the implication that China's alliance
 with the Soviet Union results from necessity rather than
 choice.)
 Soviet references to "interests" almost disappeared
 in 1952, although they had been present (at a
 very low level) in the previous two years.  How-
 ever, the importance of this seems diminished
 by the fact that the equally infrequent Chinese
 references to this category last year disappeared
 entirely in 1952.
 There is little evidence that Moscow appreciably
 and in general played down Stalin as the
 inspiration for Chinese successes as compared to
 last year's anniversary.  It is true, however,
 that the effusive praise usually accorded him
 in most contexts is generally lower in dis-
 cussion of the USSR's relations with China.
 And in at least one verified case there seems to
 be a clear toning down of praise for Stalin.
 This instance occurs in a commentary broadcast
 both to the home audience and to China, both
 versions of which are available.  The version
 heard by Russian listeners says (albeit quoting
 a Chinese source):  "'Every single one of our
 achievements we owe to the Soviet Union and the
 great Stalin."'  In the Mandarin-language
 version, this statement becomes "The Chinese
 people are grateful for the just aid of the
 USSR and voice their praise of Comrade Stalin."
 * Soviet propaganda habitually avoids references to the "interests"
 of the USSR, probably because most of its propaganda themes are framed
 in "moral" rather than "pragmatic" terms.  Moreover, references to
 "interests" tend to suggest self-involvement; this is a picture that
 Moscow avoids.  (For example, the recent Soviet popular protest
 meetings over bacterial warfare were only the third round of such
 meetings since the war, as contrasted to innumerable Satellite
 "protests."

 0                               .
 2. Statements Which Moscow Might Emphasize or Play Up:
 a.   Explicit references to "equality" (in order to reassure the
 Chinese of their coordinate rather than subordinate role
 in the Pact.)
 The evidence on this point is negative.  Total
 references to equality decline in 1952.
 Judging by the three editorials, attention to
 this category was about the same in 1950 and
 1951 but declined in 1952.  Chinese references
 to equality also declined in 1952.  This seems
 contrary to the presumption that they would
 increase if the Chinese desired to remind the
 USSR of China's coordinate rights.
 b. Celebrations of the anniversary by the Soviet people (in
 order to imply equality of the relationship)
 There is some evidence suggesting that Radio
 Moscow broadcast several programs in 1952--
 apparently absent in 1951--which actually
 described (rather than merely claiming the
 occurrence of) anniversary celebrations in
 Soviet cities.  They were broadcast to the
 Chinese people only.  Thus on 15 February,
 Moscow's Mandarin shows contained reports
 describing anniversary celebrations,
 exhibits of Chinese books in Moscow, Chinese
 motion pictures shown, and lectures and
 parties held in various parts of the USSR.
 It might be added that these elements were
 broadcast only in Mandarin, and that similar
 celebration material is not usual in the
 propaganda surrounding anniversaries with
 other Satellites.  The interjection of this
 type of propaganda seems particularly
 calculated to present a picture of a mutual
 partnership.
 c.  Prrise for China's specific contributions to the USSR (in
 order to defer to Chinese nationalism and prestige).  The
 manner in which the propaganda refers to Chinese-Soviet
 relations can take three forms.  For example, in discussing
 collaboration, the propagandists can allude to mutual
 collaboration, Soviet collaboration with China or vice
 versa.

 While most of the references in both years are framed in
 terms of mutual relationships (closely followed by the
 Soviet-to-China relationship), it is at least plausible
 that the smaller category of China-to-Soviet relation-
 ship might increase in 1952, given a Soviet desire to
 appeal to China.
 An examination of the evidence, however, does
 not reveal this to be the case.  In fact in the
 largest single category--Chinese achievements--
 Soviet sources show no hesitancy in attributing
 Chinese advances to Soviet help and inspiration.
 Specific discussions of Chinese aid,* friendship,
 collaboration and trade with the USSR show, if
 anything, a slight decrease in 1952 as compared
 with 1951.
 Thus, there is no apparent effort by the USSR to
 institute even a minimal appeal to Chinese pride.
 d.  Discussions of cultural relations, particularly from China to
 the USSR.  (Emphasis on the latter would represent a
 gratuitous compliment to Chinese culture and its impact on
 the USSR; presumably it would appeal to Chinese nationalism.)
 Within the sample of material measured, Soviet
 sources increased only slightly their references
 to culture.  On the specific issue of China's
 cultural contributions to the USSR, there was
 no increase during the second year.  Rather,
 there was an increase in the number of
 acknowledgements of Soviet cultural contri-
 butions to China.  The 1952 increase was of
 small magnitude however.**
 An examination of the titles of the 1952 Soviet
 broadcasts to China--not included in the sample
 because they were unavailable in Washington--
 would indicate that there was more stress on
 culture this year than last.  Although no firm
 observation can be made as to the direction of
 cultural flow, it is perhaps indicative that
 Radio Moscow broadcast a program covering the
 celebration of the anniversary by a group of
 "Chinese actors now in the Soviet Union."
 * Only five such references occurred, and then in a 1952 radio
 commentary broadcast only in Mandarin.
 ** The PRAVDA editorials in both years are careful not to allude
 to Soviet cultural contributions to China without immediately
 alluding to contributions in the other direction.

 It is interesting that Chinese sources
 gave some attention to both their own cultural
 achievements and their own cultural impact on
 Russia.;  both were absent last year.
 e.  Praise for Chinese achievements (in order to appeal to Chinese
 nationalism).
 The evidence on this point favors the hypothesis
 that the Soviets are gratuitously playing to
 Chinese pride more this year than last.*
 Not only does this category show an increase
 but most of that increase reflects Soviet
 statements about Chinese successes unrelated
 to Soviet aid and guidance.
 f.  Praise of Mao (in order to appease wounded pride).
 The propaganda gives no evidence that Mao is
 singled out for even the mildest heroization.
 Not only do the total number of references
 remain small, but the manner in which Mao is
 characterized remains restrained--thus the
 PRAVDA editorial calls him "experienced" but
 calls the Chinese Communist Party "glorious."
 Not even in the comment beamed to China is
 there any apparent effort to play up Mao.
 3.  Comparison of the Propaganda Evidence:
 Assuming the correctness of the hypotheses postulated above, there
 is no clear and consistent pattern suggesting a Soviet attempt
 to appeal to a China which is clearly at odds with the Soviet Union.
 While there is some data which could be interpreted as an attempt
 to play up to Chinese sensibilities (by stressing Soviet celebrations,
 Chinese cultural contributions to the USSR, and Chinese achievements),
 no extreme avoidances of presumably more sensitive themes (Stalin,
 interests, needs, and teacher) are noted this year.
 *  The chart in Tab B concerning the category of achievements shows a
 broken line for Soviet references to the category in 1951.  This was
 done because one item in the sample--a single voice commentary broadcast
 in Mandarin-contained such a large number of references to Chinese
 achievements as to make it completely unrepresentative.  A correction
 made for this bias would reduce the incidence of this category to about
 5.9%, indicated on the chart as a plus line.

 SECTION IV -- OTHER OBSERVATIONS
 1.   Soviet Sensitivity Displayed in Discussing "Advisors":  There
 is clear evidence that the Soviet radio is carefully avoiding the
 whole question of Soviet experts in China in the commentaries it
 beams to Chinese listeners. The evidence is based on the following
 points:
 a.    On 7 February, Radio Moscow broadcast a commentary
 by Vysokov, a PRAVDA correspondent in China.  It
 was broadcast to China and to the Soviet home
 audience only; FBID was able to obtain both versions.
 Whereas the Home Service version contained 13
 allusions to the work of Soviet advisors in China
 (more than a third of the entire commentary), the
 version beamed to China contained only one such
 reference.  This marked reduction in emphasis does
 not appear to be the result of mere chance editing.
 b.  Another commentary beamed to China gave very heavy
 emphasis (over half) to the subject of Soviet aid
 but completely avoided any references to Soviet
 advisors.   Most of the references to advisors which
 did occur in the press and radio were made in the
 context of aid, a fact which points up the omission
 of advisors in this case.
 c.  The omission of allusions to advisors cannot be
 explained on the ground that Soviet media generally
 played the subject down, for a PRAVDA correspondent
 in China devotes almost half of his article to
 praising the assistance rendered China by Soviet
 experts.  This commentary, however, was beamed only to
 two European Satellite audiences (of interest in it-
 self, as Moscow rarely discusses its advisors there).
 d.  Almost all of the little comment on advisors occurs
 in quotations from Chinese workers and newspapers.
 While there is firm evidence that Soviet sources are sensitive on
 the subject of advisors, the facts suggest that this sensitivity
 results from a Soviet desire not to offend the Chinese people
 rather than the Chinese leaders.  While it is true that elite
 sources (i.e. speeches by prominent leaders and major newspaper
 editorials) on both sides allude to advisors a very few times,*
 Chinese regional sources and secondary Soviet material do not
 demonstrate anything like an extreme avoidance of the subject.
 Assuming the subject was a sore point with Chinese leaders, it might
 be expected that Soviet leaders would eliminate virtually all refer-
 ences to advisors from all of their propaganda.  This they have
 done only in their Mandarin-language broadcasts.
 * It is plausible to expect that these sources, which receive greater
 international attention than does routine local propaganda, would lean
 over backwards to avoid any implication that the USSR dominates China
 via-its "experts."

 2.  Chinefie Sensitivity Concerning its Ideological Role:  There is
 some indication that the Communist Chinese elite is sensitive about
 the depiction of its role in the ideological framework of Communism.
 FBID was able to obtain two versions of a 1951 Peking commentary on
 the dissemination of ideological literature in Sinkiang, one in
 English Morse to North America and one in Chinese Numeral Code to the
 Chinese press.  In the version beamed to the West, reference was
 made to the dissemination of the works of "Marx, Engels, Lenin and
 Stalin."  In the version directed to the Chinese audience, Peking
 changed the passage to include "Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao  s -
 tung,and Liu Shao-chi. "
 This differentiation in the text of the same commentary, released by
 the same source, NCNA, appears to be more than happenstance.  This
 occurence suggests a desire on the part of the Chinese radio to
 strengthen the prestige of Communist Chinese ideological development
 in the eyes of the Chinese public by presenting it on a par with
 traditional Communist ideology.

 PROPOSED ANALYSIS OF SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS
 The analytical method employed in attempting to determine the state of re-
 lations existing between the Soviet Union and Communist China takes into
 consideration what (content) is said by these two nations (communicators
 about each other (actors) or about significant issues or areas (contexts)
 on the occasion of Sino-Soviet Pact anniversaries (events), and also   w mu
 (quantity) these factors appear in content directed to specific audiences.
 In order to gather such information and to group it into meaningful patterns
 it is proposed that the analysis should include the recording of all means
 units (each idea represented in a sentence by a subject and predicate) con-
 tained in the sample of text materials which fall into one of the categories
 of content listed below.
 I.   Sam le:  The sample will include press materials from leading newspapers
 and periodicals of China and the Soviet Union.  Insofar as possible, the
 same newspapers and periodicals will be compared for the different years
 as will be speeches and articles by the same personages.  Similar treat-
 ment will be afforded to broadcast materials, although analysis of the
 beaming of rebroadcasts to different audiences will be limited since
 most of this information is unavailable.  (Such information, however, can
 be obtained for future periods if there is advance planning in sample
 selection.)
 II.  Categories of Content:
 Collaboration:  Statements of mutual endeavor or agreement and statements
 of one's support for the other.  Such statements are commitments of support.
 ExamT)le:  "We cooperate with each other"; "The USSR has steadfastly
 upheld China's right to sit in the U.N." (cooperation, support, unity,
 solidarity; not concrete aid, trade, etc.)
 Possible Significance:  If China were annoyed at the USSR, it would not
 emphasize Soviet support of China, while the USSR, if attempting to
 ease friction, would emphasize its support of China.  If the Soviets
 were reluctant to enter the Far East conflict, the USSR would not
 emphasize mutual collaboration in.-military matters, while China
 might go ahead and do so to appear strong before its opponents.
 (Other information would be derived from considering to whom such
 statements are directed, concerning what areas, etc.)
 Teacher:  Acknowledgments by one (primarily China) that the other is a
 guide or leader.  Implicitly acknowledges different levels of status.
 Presence indicates that nationalistic considerations are subordinate.
 xam le:  "The USSR is a model for China"; "China learns from the
 USSR" (model, learn, teach, use experience of, etc.)
 Possible Significance:  China would not be expected to emphasize
 Soviet superior knowledge or progress if China were dissatisfied
 with the USSR.  The USSR would not be expected to remind China of
 the Soviets' teacher status if amiable relations were such that
 China itself emphasized this line.

 SECRET           ?
 -ii-                        Tab A continued
 Equality:  Somewhat counter to the "teacher" category.          Declarations of
 equality in status, relations, dealings or treatment.  Implicit denial
 of different levels of status.  Presence suggests consideration of
 nationalistic factors.  Code only explicit references.
 Example:  "Our relations are an example of true equality"; not:
 "The October Revolution and the Chinese People's Revolution were
 two great forces affecting world history."
 Possible Significance:  This category, even more than the others,
 is meaningful when  t changes.  It is difficult to postulate a
 high or low volume of references, so that shifts in volume of
 this category when related to the volume of "teacher" references
 would indicate a changing degree of sensitivity to status in the
 Communist orbit.
 Friendship:  Explicit declarations of friendship.  Absence or decreased
 volume mi' ht indicate annoyance, or preoccupation with a contrary way
 of discussing Sino-Soviet relations (e.g. in terms of national interests).
 Example:  "Sino-Soviet friendship grows each day"; "Chinese friend-
 ship for Soviet people" (love, sympathy, affection, etc.).
 Possible Significance:  If China is displeased at the Soviet Union,
 will decrease   a number of friendship references, especially
 in comment directed to rural China.
 Interests:  Statements referring to the interests of China and/or the
 ovi$ et union.  (Not characteristic of Communist propaganda.)  Implies a
 different and probably a greater effort to sell a point.  Somewhat of
 a counterpart to "friendship," though it may be purely a supplement to
 "friendship."   Code only references where interests is clearly the
 central point.
 Example:  "It is in China's interest to have Soviet friendship";
 'C h    gains from trade with the USSR."
 Possible Significance:  If China emphasizes its own interests when
 Talking oo      _ nno  o iet relations to its own people, then there is
 suggested a serious effort to convince its audience of desirability
 of Sino-Soviet collusion.  The effort suggests a resistance that
 must be overcome.  If it talks in terms of mutual interests, then
 there is still the suggestion of an effort to convince.  If it
 talks in terms of friendship, without emphasis on interests, then
 there is apparently no serious resistance to be met by propaganda.
 Aid:  Statements pertaining to the rendering of concrete aid, one to the
 osier, or mutual.  Explicit statements of aid have implications of
 obligation.  Reluctance to emphasize aid suggests a reluctance to emphasize
 ensuing obligations.
 Example:
 General Aid:    "We have received great assistance from the USSR."
 Equipment (and raw materials):  "China has sent cotton to the
 USSR"; "Soviet tractors have arrived in China."
 Advisors:  (Closely akin to teacher, but actual presence of
 advisors or experts seem to make this a form of
 aid) "Soviet advisors help us."

 -iii-               Tab A continued
 Possible Significance:  If China is dissatisfied at the amount of
 Soviet aid, it will not publicize what Soviet aid is forthcoming.
 If the Soviets are annoyed at Chinese increased demands, or want to
 alleviate Chinese avoidance of this issue, they will emphasize
 Soviet aid to China, especially in content directed~to Chinese
 audiences.
 Trade:  Explicit references to trade either with each other or with other
 nations.  This is an important concrete type of relation between the two
 nations Which may reflect to a considerable degree the state of political
 relations between the two.
 Example: "The exchange of goods between China and the Soviet
 Union has expepded"; "the trade ties between Japan and China...."
 Possible Significance:  If the Soviets are unable to supply China
 with appreciable amounts )f required goods, then an increasing
 number of references to trade with other nations might well be
 expected from Chinese sources, especially in content directed to
 external audiences. Soviet media on the other hand might well
 underplay this subject with references only to the interflow of
 available goods.
 Achievements:  Positive statements referring-to the successes and achieve-
 ments of themselves or the other.  Praise for the other is a declaration
 of good relations, implying support.  Maybe a category where one nation
 would attempt to "woo" the other, thus implying a current state of dis-
 pleasure on the part of the other.  Self-praise has implications of nation-
 alism and the-necessity of standing alone on certain issues.
 Example:  "The Chinese economy is flourishing"; "the elimination
 of corruption has paved the way for production successes."
 Possible Significance:  If China were displeased at the amount of
 Soviet aid forthcoming, the USSR might praise the Chinese for their
 reconstruction successes.  China would probably compensate for the
 dearth of aid by stressing its own successes.
 If China were pleased with the Soviets, it would emphasize Soviet
 achievements. The Soviets would probably divide attention between
 their own achievements and those of China.
 General Strength:  References to the might of either, including those to the
 might of the Pact. Declarations of mutual strength are testimonials of
 united opposition to the enemy, and in this sense are commitments by one
 of the other.  Most of the implications of the category "achievements"
 apply here.
 ~Zamplg: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty is a bastion of strength"; the
 power of 700 million people..."; "China defeated America in Korea."
 Possible Significance:  If both are in accord on combined opposition
 to or aggression against the enemy, both will stress mutual strength.
 JU one is reluctant in this regard it will stress the strength of the
 other, while the less reluctant one will stress mutual strength with
 its entailed commitment of the other.

 -iv-                  Tab A continued
 Military Strength:  Explicit references to the military strength of
 either or both; the military aspects of the Alliance.
 Example:  "The Chinese People's Volunteers will surely
 defeat the aggressors"; "the Soviet and Chinese Armies are
 the most formidable in the world."
 Possible Significance:  Similar to "general strength,"
 but of greater import because of explicit military context.
 Culture:  Statements pertaining to the influences or development of
 culture; movement of cultural delegations; cultural displays (movies,
 books, etc.).  This might well be another category where one of the
 nations would seek to alleviate the annoyance of the other by inter-
 jecting praises and declarations of support (neglected in other
 categories) in the cultural sphere.  The treatment of the subject
 of culture may well be governed by nationalistic sentiments and as
 such may reflect objective deterrents to closer Sino-Soviet ties.
 Example:  "The Soviet people are enthusiastic about learning
 the Chinese language"; "a Chinese cultural delegation arrived
 in Moscow"; "the Soviet Union can profit from the study of
 Chinese literature."
 Possible Significance:  If China is annoyed, it will avoid
 stressing Soviet cultural achievements, and USSR will emphasize
 Chinese culture to "woo" China.  Both will avoid if there is
 much Chinese sensitivity.
 Resistance-to-Aggression:  Declarations of-steadfastness or resolve
 to resist aggression (the explicit reference to aggression must
 be made).  Major importance of this category lies in the fact that
 it focuses attention on areas and issues.  These attention points
 we must know.
 Example:  "The Pact provides that both parties will resist
 the remilitarization of Japan"; "China is resolved to prevent
 an extension of the Korean War by the Americans."
 Possible Significance:  If both nations are in accord on
 measures to be taken in given areas, both will probably
 commit the other (in references of mutual resolve, etc.) to
 resist aggression in that area.  If one is reluctant, it will
 refrain from making this type of comment in terms of that
 area.  If one is adamant against being involved in a given
 area or on a given issue, it may force the other to also
 refrain from making mutual commitments regarding the issue
 or area at stake.  Thus, one nation will probably avoid
 stressing the issue, while the other's comment will commit
 only itself.

 Warnings:  A particularized and intense sub-category of "resistance-
 o-aggression."
 Ugression:  The actual charges that the United States and/or one of
 its cohorts intends to aggress against either or both China and the
 Soviet Union or elsewhere.  This category serves pretty much the same
 purpose as "resistance-to-aggression," i.e. focuses attention on
 areas and issues, and also is most meaningful in terms of who is
 aggressing against whoa.
 Example:  "The United States is planning to attack China and the
 So     Union."
 Peaceful Intent:  Declarations by either or both nations that they
 do not intend to aggress nor desire to aggress; that they seek peaceful
 coexistence; that it is known that they do not intend to aggress, etc.
 Example:  "China does not want war with any country"; "It is well
 that the United States lies when it says that China intends
 to intervene in Vietnam."
 NOT:   "China wants peace"; "The Soviet Union is a bulwark of
 peace"; "China and the Soviet Union work for peace"; "China has
 acquired 300,000,000 signatures to the peace appeal."
 Possible Significance:  If China were to stress its peaceful
 intent by  en  ng Its aggressive intent while the USSR stressed
 Western Aggression and not declarations of Soviet and/or Chinese
 peaceful intent, it might well indicate that China and the USSR
 did not see eye to eye on the subject of future aggressive
 measures.  This category, however, will probably take on most
 meaning from its relation to the pattern revealed by attention
 given to the other categories.  This is true of all, these
 categories, but more especially of "peaceful intent" Which will
 be more valuable after the other categories have been analyzed.
 III. Contexts and Characterizations: In addition to determining what
 Communist C ina and the Soviet  non say which might throw light on
 the state of relations existing between them, it is essential that
 ]gyr they say these things be noted. When they charge the United
 States with planning aggression, do they both cite the same locale
 for the intended aggression?  Do they do so consistently and with the
 same amount of emphasis?  When either speaks of Mao Tse-tung or
 Stalin, do they do so in the same fashion, attributing similar
 characteristics to these Communist leaders and affording them similar
 praises?  Are they consistent in this?  Do they speak of Mao regularly
 when they speak of Soviet aid, or does this usually occur when the
 topic of discussion is the achievements of China?

 Such questions essentially ask, "what are the contexts in which the
 contentions (categories) occur and in what manner are these
 contentions presented?"  To answer this question requires that
 notations be made of those contentions which are presented in such
 a fashion or context as to contribute to their meaning.  Therefore,
 the following contexts and characterization categories are proposed
 to determine the focus of attention of each of the sources, and also
 to record some of the significant manners in which the content is
 presented.
 Contexts                               Characterizations
 Treaty Provisions                             Mao, Stalin
 Collateral Agreements (loan, Dairen, etc.)    Need (e.g. Chinese success
 Korean War                                        depended on Soviet aid)
 United Nations  Chinese Admission)            Obligations (parties to
 United Nations  Embargo)                          Pact must support Japanese
 Ideological     October Revolution, etc.)         resistance)
 Kuomintang      Chiang, Taiwan, etc.)         Gratitude (Chinese grateful
 Areas           Burma, Japan, Hong Kong, etc.)  ,for aid)
 IV.   Actor Relations:  If an article in a Chinese newspaper contends
 that China is grateful for Soviet aid, then under the precedure
 guiding this analysis it would be recorded that a Chinese source made
 reference to the subject of "aid."  But much more than this simple
 relation of a source to a topic would be noted, for the content itself
 contained reference to the sources under study (China and the Soviet
 Union).  Such references in the content itself to nations or symbols
 for nations are termed references to "actors."  For example, if the
 contention is made that "China will resist American aggression,"
 two actors are involved:  China and America.   Just as sources of
 content are noted to record who makes the contentions; and just as the
 audiences are noted to record to whom the contentions are directed; so
 the actors in a contention are noted in order to record ]Lho is said to be
 doing what to whom.
 It is apparent that what nations are spoken about in any contention vitally
 affects the meaning of that contention, for it is here that the source's
 description of the state of relations existing between the various nations
 under study is found.  For example, if China frequently refers to joint
 Chinese and Soviet resolve to resist aggression in Vietnam, while the USSR
 consistently alludes only to Chinese steadfastness on this issue, then there
 is an apparent effort on the part of China to present a united show of
 strength on Vietnam, and an apparent reluctance on the part of the Soviets
 to become involved in this issue.
 It may be inferred, then, that the concentration of references to joint
 endeavors on the part of China and the Soviet Union, and references to the
 individual actions of each, may vary considerably with each source, and
 when these differences are related to the issues and categories involved,
 there may well be reflected facets of the relations existing between the two
 countries.

 V.   Conclusion:  Since the state of relations between China and the
 Soviet Union cannot be assessed for any given period, there is no
 precedent for relating propaganda to this problem. Therefore, there
 is no alternative but to postulate the propaganda conditions for
 assumed states of relations between the two countries.  This operation
 is now in progress.  For the purposes of this analysis, three basic
 characterizations of the relations between China and the USSR have
 been assumed:  excellent, poor, and a middle ground, called "normal."
 It is further assumed that either country may consider that relations
 are characterized by any one of the three conditions.  This leaves
 nine alternative states of relations existing between China and the
 USSR.  (The USSR may feel that relations are excellent, while China is
 dissatisfied; both may feel that relations are poor, etc.)
 Until "norms" of propaganda behavior (in terms of the categories,
 contexts, etc. of this analysis) can be established over a period of
 time, the chances are poor for ascertaining any but the more extreme
 conditions.  However, the analysis of what is said by China and the
 USSR to whom, in what context, and in what manner in the propaganda
 surrounding the Sino-Soviet Pact anniversaries should contribute in
 some measure to determining the existing state of relations between the
 two and should have an excellent chance of revealing the more extreme
 changes in the condition of relations between them.
