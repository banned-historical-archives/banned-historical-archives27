THE HEROIC ARMY OF A BROTHER PEOPLE 
The Chinese people are marking a glorious historical date. Thirty years of the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army haye been completed.. This is a day of great 
joy, not only to our Chinese friends, but also to every Soviet individual, to all hon-
est people on earth who follow the immense progress of New China with respect and 
love. 
For many hundreds of years the vast country which spreads from the Pacific 
Ocean to the snow-clad. summits of Karakorum and the shifting sands of the Gobi s 
desert was under the yoke of Chinese and. foreign exploiters. The national resourc-
es were plundered. by greedy predatory imperialists and. their Chiang Kai-shekiit ac-
complices. Workers and farmers, all of China's people endured terrible tortures ? 
and. suffering at the hands of feudal lords and militarists, who mad.e fabulous pro-
fits from the people's misery. But the hour of great battles had come. The Com-
munist Party roused. the mass of people to a war of liberation. The Peoples Libera-
tion Army was the mighty force by which the Chinese people crushed. the Kuomintang 
hordes and the imperialistic armies, and. won the freedom and independence of their 
native land. 
The Chinese Peoples Liberation Army came into being in the fire of the Nanchang 
insurrection on 1 August 1927. In that period the troops of the Nationalist army, 
among whom the Communists were carrying on large-scale orientation work, turned 
their weapons against the reactionary Kuomintang government and went over to the 
Revolution. That was a great victory for China's revolutionary forces. A powerful 
uprising of peasants soon took place in the provinces of Hunan, Hupeh, Shansi and 
others. As a result of these events the first units of the Chinese Revolutionary 
Army were organized. under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. 
The history of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army has had four periods of devel-
opment. During the first period (1927 - 1936) the Chinese people, relying on this 
Army, waged. a revolutionary civil war against the large landowners and the bour- , 
geoisie. In carrying out this task, the army did. not limit itself to armed struggle 
alone, but also organized the mass of people and. carried on extensive political pro-
paganda for China's Communist Party. During the second. period (1937 - 1945) the' 
Peoples Liberation Army of China fought as a unitednational front against the Japa-
nese invaders. After the defeat of imperialistic Japan the third. period began. On 
its way to victory, the Chinese Army had to endure the most difficult trials in its 
struggle against the reactionary Kuomintang clique, which wanted. to turn back the 
Peoples Revolution with the help of its for masters. And finally, in 1949, the 
fourth period. began. New tasks now confronted. the Chinese Peoples Liberation 
Army: to defend the building-up of socialism in their native land; to safeguard the 
sovereignty, the territorial integrity, and. the safety of the country; to be ready at 
any time to liberate the island of Taiwan where the followers of Chang Kai-shek 
are still entrenched.; to stand vigilantly guarding peace and security.

is closely connected. with the names of Mao Tse-tung, Chu Teh, Peng Teh-huai, and. 
other outstanding leaders of the Chinese people. "This Army," says Comrade Mao 
Tse-tung, "is strong in that the people who joined, it are self-disciplined people. They 
joined, together and. are fighting not for the mercenary interests of a few men or of 
some small group, but for the interests of broad masses of the people, for the in-
terests of the entire nation. To coalesce closely with China's ma.ssee, to serve the 
Chinese people devotedly --- such is the only aspiration motivating this Army." 
The fact that the army has become a true Peoples Army has made it indestructible. 
China's young Peoples Liberation Army had to overcome enormous difficulties. The 
enemy had guns, tanks, and. aircraft. The American imperialists were not chary 
with loans and armament supplies for the Kuomintang factions. In only a single 
campaign against the Chinese Liberation Army there were 150 American and. Cana-
dian pilots participating, whereas the Peoples Army was lacking in even the simplest 
weapons which had. to be taken in battle. 
The enemy had. a considerable numerical superiority. There was a time when 
160,000 soldiers of the Peoples Liberation Army fought against an army of 700,000 
on the side of Chiang Kai-shek. However, even this could. not stop the aroused 
people. Through fire and. smoke marched. the units of New China. They d.id. not 
weaken in battle; on the contrary, they became even stronger as more and, more 
soldiers joined their ranks. By the beginning of 1932 the Peoples Liberation Army 
had. grown to 300,000 men, and. later there were more than a million. In the course 
of crushing the Kuomintang hordes, the number of men in the Peoples Liberation 
Army reached almost folur million. This is the most striking evidence of the draw-
ing power of the ideas for which the soldiers of New China were fighting under the 
leadership of the Communist Party. 
The struggle was very hard.. Fearing the growth of the revolutionary forces, the 
counterrevolutionary Kuomintang clique tried, in every way to strangle the Peoples 
Liberation Army., Using its numerical and. technical advantages, and. enrolling 
Ge man and American generals as advisers, -it blockaded, the revolutionary units 
maAy times., but to no avail. 
The Great March to the Northwest is inscribed in golden letters in the history of 
the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army. Having broken through the ring of the 
Kuomintang blockade, the soldiers covered. about 13,000 km, fighting along the way. 
They traversed uninhabited steppes and mountains covered with eternal snow, forced 
7ossings over dozens of rivers, and repeatedly broke out of encirclements, con-
tinuously repelling enemy attacks. The successful completion of the Great North-
western March proved, convincingly the invincibility of a people aroused in the cause 
of their liberation. 
In 1946 theChiang Kai-shek clique controlled. 80% of China's territory including 
all the large cities and the greater part of the railroad lines. By this time the 
United States had equipped. 166 Kuomintang divisions. From 'October 1945 to July 
1946 alone, they gave to the Kuomintang, besides infantry and artillery armament, 
800 aircraft, 200 naval vessels of various classes, 12,000 armored. vehicles and. 
trucks, and other armament. Nevertheless this new venture of the trouble-makers 
also collapsed before the all-conquering wave of the people's wrath. 
The Chinese people frustrated. the enemy's plans. Again, as before, the Peoples 
Liberation Army increased its ranks while advancing, improved, its combat and. moral 
Editorial 
and. political qualities. In only three years of war the Kuomintang losses amounted. 
to several million men. The losses in armament were also enormous: 50,000 field 
pieces, more than 300,000 machine guns, over one thousand. tanks and. armored cars, 
and many airplanes. 
Now all these events are part of the past, but the people will never forget the 
great campaigns. They will never forget how the young peasants went to 'the front 
equipped. with the most primitive weapons such as scythes and.pitchforks. The peo-
ple will never forget the fifteen young soldiers of the Peoples Liberation Army who, 
having donned. enemy uniforms, secretly penetrated. into the enemy camp, created a 
panic there and took a whole company of Kuomintang soldiers captive. "This is not 
an exceptional case in my division," wrote the division comman.der. "Every Red.. 
Army man is just waiting for an opportunity to show heroism." 
No matter under what conditions the people of' China and. their Peoples Liberation 
Army found. themselves, the Soviet Union always rendered. thein active and. diversi-
fied, assistance. After the signing of the Sino-Soviet non-aggression pact in 1938, 
Soviet volunteer pilots and other military specialists came to China to offer help in 
military operations. Their arrival took the arrogance out of the Japanese pilots. 
The Japanese command. quickly transferred its air bases 500-600 km to the rear. 
Soviet pilots accomplished, immortal feats of heroism in the skies of China. Es-
pecially memorable to the Chinese people are the victories won by our pilots on 18 
February 1938 in an air battle over the city of Wuhan and. on 23 April of the same 
year over the island. of Taiwan when Soviet military aircraft bombed remote Japanese 
air bases. The air battle of 29 April 1938 will also be remembered. The Soviet 
fliers engaged. in combat with 36 enemy planes. In this air battle 12 Japanese bom-
bers and. 9 fighters were downed and. the rest were put to flight. In 40 months of 
war against the Japanese invaders, 986 Japanese aircraft were d.owned. and. destroyed 
with the help of Soviet fliers. 
In the course of WW II, the Soviet people helped. the Chinese people-to defeat utter-
ly the Japanese Fascist invaders. The soldiers of the Soviet Army fought heroical-
ly for the liberation of the Chinese people, as though they were defending their native, 
land.. Thus, Soviet and. Chinese brotherly friendship in combat was molded. and 
strengthened.. 
A Peoples Republic was proclaimed in China on 1 October 1949. Comrade Mao. 
Tse-tung said. at that time: "Our national defense will be strengthened., and. no im-
perialist will be permitted to invade our territory again. The armed forces of the 
people have to be preserved, and. developed, on the basis of the heroic and. well-temper-
ed Peoples Liberation Army. We shall have not only a powerful land. army but a 
powerful air force and a powerful navy as well." 
How has the Peoples Liberation Army of China developed, in the 30 years of its 
existence? Now it has all branches of service. Its personnel is persistently 
mastering military science and. new combat technology. During training exercises 
the officers and. men demonstrate their increased c.ombat skill. There was a time 
when the Peoples Liberation Army of China had. at its disposal a very small number 
of aircraft. Now they have their own Air Force supplied with the best combat equip-
ment. 
The Chinese military pilots, as well as all the men of the Peoples Liberation Ar-
my, must be on the alert all the time. The imperialists have not relaxed... The

growing strength of Peoples china infuriates them. Again and again they ,provoke 
new military actions against Peoples China. But they cannot break the will of a 
people bent on building socialism. The events of recent years have proved, this 
most convincingly. 
When the American imperialists invaded. Korea, thus creating a direct threat to 
China on its northeastern border, Chinese peoples volunteers came to help the 
brother Korean people. The long-suffering Korean land. was burning from enemy 
bombings a.n.d. artillery fire. But in the fire of the conflagrations true heroes were 
born. For example, there is Chinese pilot Cheng Chang-hua. He was not yet fif-
teen when he joined, the ranks of the men fighting for the freedom of their people. 
He became a private and, later, a commander. The ottfit in which Cheng Chang-
hua served destroyed. 47 enemy planes. 
Air battles went on day and night both close to the ground. and. in the stratosphere. 
The defenders of Korea were learning to act decisively and. to stand fast before the 
hateful, enemy under any conditions. There were days when even the American 
yellow press panicked.: 11100% losses"? such was the headline in a reactionary 
American magazine which told. about the results of an air battle. In this battle the 
Chinese pilots attacked. a group of "Flying Fortresses." Three of them were downed., 
and. the remaining five were heavily damaged,. 
Both in the air and. on the ground. victory over the enemy was being forged. Dur-
ing the military operations in Korea more than 300,000 Chinese Peoples Volunteers 
were decorated. with titles of heroes, exemplary fighters, and fighters who had. ac-
compliihed. heroic deeds. Many thousand.s of soldiers were awarded orders and 
medals of the Korean Peoples Democratic Republic. 
The Chinese land. is still exposed. to the attacks of Chiang Kai- shekist bands and. 
American aggressors. Recently, for instance, the press reported, new violations 
of Chinese air space by Chiang Kai- shekist and. American aircraft. Planes of the 
aggressors not only break into the territory of China but in a gangster-like way fire 
at and. bomb the peaceful population. 
Chinese pilots and all the men of the Peoples Liberation Army are constantly in 
combat readiness. Their faces are hard., their eyes are vigilant, and their hands 
hold firmly the weapons given to them. by the people. They give the aggressors the 
rebuff they deserve. 
The Peoples Liberation Army has reached. its Thirtieth Anniversary strong and. 
hardened.. Under the leadership of the Communist Party it is a reliable defender 
of the revolutionary achievements of the Chinese people. It is an army of the new 
type, imbued. with a spirit of patriotism and internationalism. It reliably guards the 
interests of the Chinese Peoples Republic and. vigilantly protects the bord.ers of its 
country.

NIGHT TRAINING OF PILOT AND NAVIGATOR 
Night flying is one of the most complex aspects of combat training. Its difficulty 
is caused. by the fact that night flying is primarily instrument flying, which requires 
intensified, attention on the part of the flying personnel, as well as a great exertion of 
moral and, physical energies. Piloting an aircraft at.night, even und.er normal 
weather conditions, has, in contradistinction to daytime flying, a number of charac-
teristic features which complicate carrying out a mission. Among these are: the 
considerable difficulty of determining visually the aircraft's position in space; the 
artificial illumination of the flight and. navigation instruments and equipment in the 
pilot's compartment and that of other members of the crew; the absence of visibility 
or the distortion of the natural horizon on a dark night; the difficulty in determining 
the distance to the pinpoint and area light check points; the reflections on the glass 
surfaces of the cockpit enclosure. 
The flying personnel encounters even greater difficulties if night flying is carried. 
out under adverse weather conditions, when the possibility of visual piloting is com-
pletely precluded. At this time air navigation is carried, out only through the use of 
electronic and. astronomical facilities, while bomb sighting is carried, out only by 
means of electronic facilities. 
Night flying is within the capacity of every pilot and. navigator. But there are 
many difficulties of all kinds on the path towards combat skill. In order to surmount 
them, the pilots, navigators, radio-gunners, technical personnel, and all specialists 
must exercise a maximum of persistence and tenacity, high discipline and. good or-
ganization, and,? above all they must have an excellent knowledge of their work 
and. systematic training. 
There are many commanders in the Air Force, who regard. seriously the organi-
zation of training classes for the flying personnel. For example, such classes have 
been well organized in the group commanded by officer Ye.I.Kravtsov. They are 
conducted by experienced, leaders on a high methodological level, with perfect simu-
lation of all the operations of the pilot and the navigator in the scheduled flight. A 
great deal. of attention is given here to the development of the correct sequence of 
operations by the crew members in special cases of flying. The classes are very 
useful; consequently it is not fortuitous that every officer is interested in them. 
The practical training of flying personnel at night begins with the development of 
the elements of piloting technique under normal weather conditions. And this is 
understandable. Faultless piloting technique is not an end. in itself but rather a 
means for mastering the elements of combat application. 
At every one of the stages in training it must be remembered that an error oc-
curring there which is not eliminated can lead. to grave consequences later on. Let 
us examine at least one such instance where a pilot, taking off in an I1-28 aircraft, 
raises the nose wheel, sometimes too soon and. sometimes too late. Let US assume 
that the instructor noticed. this error but attached no significance to it. Then in a

solo night flight it can give rise to a more serious error, and. that will be sufficient 
basis for a flying accident. 
Or another example. While training a pilot to make a landing approach with the 
aircraft landing lights switched. on and. without any illumination from below by the 
ground. floodlights, the instructor noticed. that the pilot had. a tendency, while making 
his landing computation, to descend. lower than the prescribed. altitude; but the in-
structor paid no attention to it. Yet, during solo flights, the pilot may commit the 
error of descending. even lower and. the glid.e path will be very shallow. As a re-
sult, at the very beginning of round-out, the light beam of the landing lights will 
turn out to be directed almost horizontally towards the runway and, will illuminate it 
inadequately. Such ,an error will result in starting the round-out at too high an alti-
tude, in violating the landing profile, and, as a rule, in a rough landing. 
Lack of know-how in taking into account the peculiarities of the red light of the 
landing system signals is usually the cause of premature loss of altitud.e by individual 
pilots as they approach for a landing at night. The actual distance to those lights 
is deceptive at night and. a false picture of the distance to the runway is created.. The 
task of the commander lies not only in analyzing some error or other by the pilot on 
the ground. but also in pointing out during flight how he must operate, and in giving 
him confidence in carrying out a given element of flight. At the same time one 
must not be guilty of such a dangerous practice during training as that of thinking: 
"He'll get it by himself", or "He'll get there with practice". 
The same thing must also be said. with regard. to the training of flying personnel 
for instrument flying. Only the pilot who has perfectly mastered. piloting technique 
visually and. by instruments can be consid.ered as trained, for solo night flying. That 
is why it is important to organize the systematic training of the flying personnel even 
before the beginning of night flying. For this purpose, maximum use must be made 
of the TL-1 trainer. 
After, acquiring firm habits of flying on instruments on a TL-1, the pilot will more 
readily master the program of flying in a closed cockpit or in the cloud cover on a 
combat trainer and in a combat aircraft. Training on a TL-1 is particularly im-. 
portant for fighters, upon whom d.emand.s are made, as upon no one else,for excep-
tional speed. of reaction as well as for swiftness of operations and the ability to spot, 
attack, and. destroy the enemy under the most adverse conditions. 
The technique, of instrument flying is identical for both nighttime and the daytime. 
'However, in order not to' disrupt the flight regime, it must be remembered that at 
night turning one's attention away from the instruments for the sake of getting one's 
bearing visually and. for the sake of caution is possible only for a very short time. 
Otherwise, on a ,dark night or over the sea, poorly experienced, pilots may get a 
false impression of the position of the aircraft. In all instances the pilot must guid.e 
himself only by his instrument readings to determine the aircraft's position in space. 
Slowness and. indecision are inadmissible here, for they may entail loss of one's 
orientation in space. The following example is typical,. In unit X, pilot A. M. Shu-
bin was carrying out his first solo flight along a flight route on a dark night at an 
altitude of 4500 m. Being without adequate experience, he tried, to facilitate pilot-
ing by frequently turning his attention away from the in in ord.er to deter-
mine the position of the aircraft by the light check points of which there were very 
few. As a result,' it appeared, to him that the craft was turning to the left. In 01'-
50-Yr 2013/10/31: CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050009-7  
ainin? of Pilot and Navi ator 
d.er to correct the apparent turn he banked the craft to the right and., absorbed. in 
making his course correction, came down too low. His subsequent actions were 
also wrong. He kept reestablishing the aircraft's position in accordance with the 
light check points. It must be observed, that even the crew navigator was not able 
to help the pilot; he lost his head. and. displayed. lack of discipline, and. that compli-
cated. the situation even further. 
That incident shows that piloting an aircraft on a dark night must be carried, out 
only on instruments and the flying personnel must be so taught. 
By training only individual crews in the technique of night flying it is impossible, 
of course, to solve all the problems of night training completely. One of the most 
complicated. features of such training is flying in a group under normal and. adverse 
weather .conditions. Commanders must be very careful in granting permission for 
pilots to fly in a pair or in an element. It is not precluded, that some pilots will not 
be able to master flying in a group and. they should not be assigned. such a task. 
As a consequence of the great difficulty of visually determining and maintaining 
interval and. distance between aircraft, the technique of group flying at night is 
markedly different from daytime flying. Group teamwork in flying must be develop-
ed, among the personnel of permanent crews. Before the beginning of night flying, 
the commanders must organize detailed, ground. training of the flying personnel. Spe-
cial attention should be given to such questions as adjusting the intensity of cockpit 
illumination, the illumination of the radio-gunner's compartment in the lead. plane 
and. his duties during the flight, the duties of the group leader on the ground and. in 
the air, the actions of the lead. pilot and. of the wingmen during special cases of 
flight, studying the flight route with an indication of the place and order of assembly 
and breakup of the group. 
In the solution of the problems of the night training of flying personnel, a great 
d.eal d.epend.s on the personal qualities of the commander-instructors. Above all, 
the instructor himself must know how to fly, bomb, and. fire in an outstanding man-
ner under any conditions. In the units and. outfits of the Air Force there are many 
commanders who .have mastered the skill of training flying personnel in night flying. 
Thus, officer A. I. Romanov successfully imparts his experience to his pilots. A 
high level of flying skill and a methodological background. make it possible for him to 
show the trainee correctly how one element or another of flying must be carried out, 
how to analyze his actions, how to d.etermine his inad.equacies, and. how to point out 
ways for eliminating them quickly. 
It should. be pointed, out that successful execution of the combat training tasks of 
night training of pilot and. navigator is unthinkable without a high d.egree of coordina-
tion in the crew, and. the firm friendship. and. close cooperation of all its members. 
During a flight, it is very important for the actions of one member of the crew to 
complement those of another. In addition to the pilot and the navigator, there is a 
radio-gunner in the crew who, during any flight, from the time the engines are started. 
up to the time of taxiing in to the parking area, carries out complex and. varied, duties, 
and is the combat assistant of the pilot and navigator. 
The engineer, aviation technicians, mechanics, and. all the specialists bear respon-
sibility for the good. working ord.er of the aircraft. They must always remember that 
when they service an aircraft for a sortie there is nothing that is of secondary impor-
tance; that the slightest defect is the potential cause of a flying accident. Perfect

functioning of all the assemblies of the aircraft inspires the flying personnel with con-
fidence in carrying out their mission. The special features of night flying require 
precise functioning of all the instruments and other equipment of the aircraft, since 
the pilot notices any error during night flying later than he would during the daytime. 
Failure of even, one instrument hampers the execution of the mission and. frequently 
even makes it impossible. Consequently, the mechanics and. instrument technicians 
must prepare all the instruments with special care. 
Important and. crucial tasks also face the personnel which services the ground. faci-
lities for air navigation. It is well known that not a single flight is possible without 
suitable ZOS [ground. aids to navigation] facilities. Facilities for landing, vectoring, 
and. control must always function efficiently, without any interruptions. Even brief 
interruptions in the functioning of ZOS facilities may have a negative effect on execu-
tion of the as-signed mission. On the skill of the men servicing the ZOS facilities, 
on the accuracy of determining the target location depend. the outcome of vectoring the 
fighters to the aerial target, the accuracy of bombing, and flying safety. 
Great responsibility for carrying out night flying is placed upon the flight control-
ler. Poor visibility hampers not only the flights but also control over them. In 
order to carry out his duties, the flight controller must have a good understanding of 
the entire procedure and. of all the special features of night flying; he must, while at 
his place of work, feel the entire dynamics of the flight, and. for this purpose, he 
must know hovv to fly under any conditions. 
To control a matter without being familiar with its essence means to control 
blindly. The flight controller is a highly disciplined, and exacting commander who 
does not allow the slightest infringement of the rules and. requirements of flight serv-
ice 
The outfit commanded. by officer I. I. Yefremov serves as an example of good train-
ing and. efficient control of flying by day and by night. He thinks over carefully the 
order for carrying out each flight scheduled. in the planning table, and. provides for 
everything down to the last detail. In getting ready for flights, the commander 
makes a detailed study of the weather situation, of the special features of the flight 
area and of the alternate is.irfield.s, and takes into account the possibilities of utiliz-
ing electronic facilities. 
While controlling the flights, officer Yefremov never forgets the main task of the 
flight controller to guarantee complete flying safety and. strict Order on the ground. 
and in the air. By making active use of electronic facilities he always knows the 
location of each aircraft. Information on changes in the weather and. in flight condi-
tions has been organized in an exemplary fashion in the outfit. Furthermore, the 
flight controller has good. radio contact with the alternate airfield.s and the bombing 
range. Since he knows the special features of night flying and. the swiftly changing 
climatic conditions in the area of his airfield, Yefremov follows all changes in the 
weather situation attentively. Efficiency and strictness in controlling flights, with-
out a shadow of rud.eness or panic, discipline the pilots and. inspire confid.ence in 
them. The pilots know that in a difficult moment during the flight they will receive 
help in good time and will be able to get out of the serious situation. It must be ob-
served that during the organization and. control of flights in this outfit, particularly 
serious attention is given to stacking the aircraft, not only on the flight route but also 
in the area of the airfield.. 
- 
N ht Trainin of Pilot and Navi ator 
But unfortunately we also still have among us flight controllers who allow flagrant 
violations of the rules of flight service and. who, by their actions, fail to guarantee 
flying safety. For example, a whole number of. deviations from the rules of flight 
service was committed. by Officer Z.G.Finkel'shteyn while he was night flight con-
troller.. His irresponsible attitud.e towards execution of his service duties resulted 
in the unsuccessful termination of the flights that. night. 
The night training of flying personnel must not even for a minute escape the field. 
of vision of the Political Agencies and. Party Organizations. The "Instructions to. 
the Organizations of the CPSU in the Soviet Army and. Navy", 'confirmed. by the cen-
tral Committee of. the CPSU, require that the Party Organizations have a deep under-
standing of all aspects of combat training. That means that the guarantee of 4 solu-
tion for the complex tasks of night training must attract the special attention of the 
Party Organizations. 
Training the flying personnel to fly in an outstanding manner, to fire and. bomb 
accurately, to intercept aerio.7 targets and. to destroy them at night, means solving 
a problem of great State imprtance. A high level of night training intensifies the 
combat readiness of the units and. outfits of the Air Force and. makes it possible for 
our Air Force to operate under any conditions by day and. by night.

A FIGHTER ATTACK IS REPULSED 
(At Air Force Exercises) 
Lt. Col. V. P. Kopylov 
Bombers are d.esigned. for striking blows against ground. objectives. In the interest 
of carrying out their basic mission they usually strive to avoid, aerial combat, for 
which purpose, as a rule, provision is mad.e for a fighter evasion maneuver ? flight 
along a broken course with a change in speed. and. altitude. If, however, they do not 
succeed in avoiding an encounter with the enemy, bombers are forced to conduct ac-
tive defensive combat, attempting to disrupt fighter attacks and., if possible, to hit 
them with precision fire. For this they use speed, direction and flight altitud.e ma-
neuvers, and. closing or opening the combat formation along the front and. in depth. 
However, the possibilities of a fighter evasion maneuver by bombers are limited. 
After assembling the group and, gaining the required altitud.e on the flight route, the 
navigator determines the wind., for which a specified. flight regime is maintained.. 
Maintenance of the flight regime is also necessary before reaching. the NBP [initial 
point, of bomb run], when the crew switches on and. adjusts in the automatic pilot. 
The carrying out on the bombing run of any maneuver unrelated. to the lateral course 
setting is out of the question. 
Thus, in the majority of cases, a fighter evasion maneuver can be executed only 
on the flight route, long before the target approach, when the probability of an en-
counter with enemy fighters is still small. But if flight is mad.e to the maximum, 
operational radius, then it is also not desirable to carry out the maneuver, since it 
shortens the flight range. A change in course and. speed., for the purpose of disrupt-
ing fighter attacks and. not provided. f or by the flight plan, considerably hinders spot-
ting the target and approaching it at the required. time. 
I , /

A Fighter Attack is Repulsed 11 
But what is to be done if an encounter with fighters, nevertheless, takes place? 
The answer i.s simple ? know how to combine maneuvering with precision firing. 
Only thus is it possible to overcome successfully the countermeasures of enemy 
fighters. 
In one exercise a group of bombers was assigned. the mission of striking a blow 
against an "enemy" objective at a prescribed. time. Analyzing the tactical and. 
aerial situation, the commander established, the fact that fighters can intercept their 
group even prior to their approach to the "front" line. It was not possible to use a 
fighter evasion maneuver since they were flying with maximum radius. Consequent-
ly, it was necessary to prepare for repulsing the attacks. 
Preparing for flight, the crews acquainted themselves in detail with. the conditions 
under which they were to carry out their mission. The commander thought out in 
detail the organization of air observation and. warning of the "enemy's" approach, 
and. outlimd variants of the combat formation while repulsing fighter attacks, especi-
ally emphasizing the importance of precision aimed. fire by radio gunners and of 
mutual fire support among the crews. 
After taking off and. gaining the required. altitud.e the bombers intercepted, the 
flight route, where they found. themselves in broken cirrus overcast. Under these 
conditions they were intercepted, by fighters 15-20 km from the "front" line and. were 
attacked. successively by pairs. However, despite limited, visibility, the bomber 
crews spotted. the "enemy" in good. time, thanks to which the pilots took up the posi-
tions in the combat formation assigned by the commander, and. the aerial radio gun-
ners got read.y to fire. The radio gunners of aircraft directly subject to attack con-
ducted. tracking fire, and, the others supported them with obstruction fire. The 
fighters were repulsed by simultaneous well-aimed. fire. 
The bombers won this air battle because air observation was well organized., the 
crews were warned, in good. time of the threat of attack, and. precise and. uninterrupted. 
control was established. The commander mad.e a correct choice of combat forma-
tion, guaranteeing mutual fire support among the aircraft for repulsing "enemy" at-
tacks. The crews quickly took up their position in formation. 
But even when observing all these provisions, fighters can inflict considerable - 
losses on bombers when aerial radio gunners are poorly trained. in conducting pre-
cision aimed fire. The interpretation of photostrips showed. high accuracy of fire. 
In the evaluation of it only the bursts delivered, from the range of effective fire were 
considered., along with the organization of fire coordination and. support within the 
group. The precision fire of aerial rad.io gunners and. its correct organization are 
the main prerequisites for the defense of combat formations. 
It is well known that aerial combat is brief. In this short period, of time the will 
and. training of crews are put to the severest test. Only courage, discipline, high 
morale and. excellent training of flying personnel for the defense of combat forma-
tions will bring success to bombers in aerial combat. 
Insofar as the deciding factor in repulsing fighters is precision fire, we subordi-
nate the entire process of training aerial radio gunners to the main task ? inculcat-
ing in them the habits of sniper fire at aerial targets., Training in precision fire is 
not an easy task. It includes training for aerial gunnery on the ground., photo gun-
nery, combat gunnery in the air, and., finally, aerial combat with fighters. 
All ground. training is directed. toward. ensuring flight training. On the ground.

fixed practical habits are cultivated in. determining initial data for firing, in aircraft 
Identification, in working with sight setting, and. in sighting aerial targets. 
It is very important that the habits acquired be consolidated and. perfected.. There-
fore we strive to avoid long breaks between training on the various gunnery trainers 
and directly in an aircraft. Regardless of whether aerial gunnery is planned. for an 
impending flying day or not, aerial radio gunners are required. to undergo training 
on gunnery trainers. On a flying day, if the nature of the flights permits, flight 
personnel conduct photogunnery from the ground against aircraft which are taking off. 
For this purpose,_ special trainers mounted on. tripods, were provided for the pilots 
and aerial radio gunners. Gunners, by training constantly in sighting, acquire hab-
its of precision firing. 
No less important' is a thorough analysis of each air battle, bringing out the errors 
committed. During one training flight a bomber element was subjected. to three at-
tacks by fighter pairs. Among the crews in trail Were young aerial radio gunner, 
Privates N. A. Goncharov and V. I. Zamaziy. After landing, the gunners reported 
that all three fighter attacks, in their opinion, were successfully repulsed. But 
when the photogunnery films were interpreted it became clear that both aerial gun-
ners had. begun delivering fire from distances .exceeding the range of effective fire, 
and. had. used up the entire supply of FKP [camera machine gun film while repuls-
ing the first attack. Thus, analyzing the firing results we ascertained, that the gun-
ners were not able to estimate properly the distance to the target and. delivered, their 
camera' fire too hastily. 
For those aerial radio gunners for whom certain elements of gunnery d.o not come 
easily we organize supplementary training. During the first period of instruction 
some gunners were not able to track the target and. to frame it correctly at the.same 
time. Thus the habits of simultaneous target tracking and. framing in aerial photo-
gunnery did not come easily to Sergeant N. P.Svistunov for a long time. If he tried. 
to frame the target correctly, then he would forget about tracking and. vice versa. 
It was necessary to place the gunner under special supervision, to conduct supple-
mentary training in photogunnery from the ground against aircraft taking off, and. on 
a ,trainer under the direct guidance of an officer of the aerial gunnery service. Each 
photo firing was thoroughly analyzed. and. the errors were explained. The results 
soon became apparent. Whereas at first N. P. Svistunov had only poor and satisfac-
tory evaluations, good ones subsequently began to appear, and. lately he has been 
carrying out excellent photogunnery and combat gunnery. 
Flights for firing from a camera machine gun. are a stage of preparation for com-
bat gunnery. They are conducted in order to cultivate in young gunners the habits of 
working in the air with sight settings and with the sight, and to give them practice in 
sighting aerial targets. In practice firing from combat weapons in the air they ac-
quire habits of the combat application of aircraft artillery weapons and. prepare them-
selves for conducting defensive aerial combat. 
However, practice aerial gunnery is carried. out under conditions far different 
from those wider which actual combat takes place.. A most complete picture of 
actual combat can be reproduced during the process of practice aerial combat, con-
ducted jointly with fighters -- provided., of course, it is correctly organized.. There-
fore, we organize practice aerial combat with particular care; we attempt to keep 
the crews participating in a sortie from knowing beforehand. by how many fighters and. 
DecI 
A Fi hter Attack is-Re ulsed 
13 
on what leg of the flight course they will be attacked.. At the same time we require 
fighters to conduct active combat with bombers, utilizing various tactical methods. 
It is at times difficult to organize aerial combat between bombers and. :fighters 
based on different airfields. Because of the lack of coincidence between flight days 
and between the different weather conditions in the areas where the fighters and bom-
bers are based., flights are often aborted.. The organization of aerial combat between 
individual crews is particularly complicated. 
In order for all crews to obtain practice in conducting defensive aerial combat 
singly and. within the composition of small groups, it is possible to practice the peri-
odical landing of a fighter pair or flight on. a bomber airfield. This will considerab-
ly simplify the organization of joint flights. However, while organizing joint aerial 
combat sorties from one airfield., we cannot simplify the air situation. For bom-
bers the element of surprise in. an encounter with fighters must be preserved., and. 
the same is true for fighters training in the interception of aerial targets. 
The organization of aerial combat in formation represents a certain amount of 
difficulty. For this the flying personnel must be skilled in air observation while 
flying in formation, in giving rapid and clear warning of the enemy; they must be 
skilled, in the execution of maneuvers within the group by planes in trail as well as 
by the entire group, and. also in mutual fire support among crews and components. 
However, it is possible to drill in. these elements not only in aerial combat flights. 
For example, flight personnel must undergo training in circumspection during each 
flight. In order to cultivate the habit of constant air observation we require crew 
commanders to listen periodically in flight to reports by gunners on the air situation. 
In group flights, whether it he a flight for purposes of formation drill or for com-
bat application without aerial combat, the formation leaders train the wingmen in 
combat change of formation along the front and in. depth with prescribed distances 
and. intervals, and in group maneuvering. 
Aerial radio gunners of lead crews are trained in fire control on the ground. For 
this purpose the instructor creates from bombers and fighter mockups in the class-
room different variants of the air situation. The radio gunners are stationed in ac-
cordance with combat considerations. The instructor, imitating with the aid of 
mockups the different stages and variants of aerial combat, trains the gunners in 
giving warning of the enemy, and. instructs the leaders in giving commands and in 
fire control. 
If the training process is set up in this way, then practice aerial, combat will be 
the final stage in the tactical preparation of bomber crews. 
During a sortie for carrying out a regular exercise, "enemy" fighters (coming 
in out of the sun) attacked a bomber group. Because of poorly organized warning 
and. fire control within the group, some of the aerial radio gunners could not quick-
ly join in combat. The gunners opened. "fire" from different ranges and. some did 
not succeed in firing at all. Analyzing this battle, we became definitely convinced 
that it is necessary to shift the training of aerial radio gunners over to group aerial 
combat. 
We have begun to devote great attention to crew coordination. There are cases 
in which insufficiently experienced, aerial radio gunners forget before firing to set 
in the initial firing data or to set the sight on. "gyre. In the course of combat, 
flight speed and altitud.e often change and the gunner may not notice this and may not

Introduce the correction into the mechanisms for computing .altitud.e and. speed. If 
the pilot or navigator does not inform him in time of the change in flight regime, an 
error in firing is inevitable. 
Our pilots and navigatcirs know which operations a radio gunner must carry out 
prior to firing in flight, and, inquiring b.y SPU [aircraft interphone system], they 
check the correctness of armament preparation for firing, and. the radio gunners 
report on their .operations. to the crew commander. 
Certain comrades, campaigning for the sequence of training to proceed. from the 
less complicated to the more complicated, consider that aerial combat flights should. 
be carried out at first by an individual crew and. later in a group. 
It is not possible to agree with this opinion. It is difficult to determine before-. 
hand which type of aerial combat that of an individual bomber or that of a group ? 
will turn out to be more complex. Much here depends on existing conditions. If 
a pilot knows how to pilot an aircraft in a group, then we consider'it senseless to 
establish such a sequence in aerial combat training. 
In order to inculcate flight personnel with confidence in their technique,, it is 
useful to organize aerial sham battles between a bomber and. one or a pair of fighters, 
choosing for this purpose the better crews with perfect mastery of piloting technique 
and experienced in conducting aerial combat. It is best to conduct sham battles over 
the airfield so that flight personnel can observe from the ground the dynamics of the 
entire combat. For fighters this combat must be free and. creative. The aerial 
radio gunner while observing fighter operations, is constantly required. to inform 
the crew commander of their intentions and. of the air situation. Attempting to dis-
rupt or hamper a fighter attack, the pilot, taking account of the specific situation, 
uses a particular maneuver. General direction of the engagement (by radio from 
the alert command po.st) is entrusted to the commander organizing the aerial sham 
battle. 
After conducting an aerial sham battle, a detailed. analysis of it is conducted in 
the presence of all flight personnel with a report of ground. observations, an analysis 
of crew reports and of camera firing results, and with the showing of films. This 
will aid in finding the most effective methods of conducting defensive' combat with 
bombers. 
Present-day systems of detecting aerial targets and the high flight speeds of 
fighters do not always permit bombers to avoid an encounter and. combat with them. 
A high degree of crew coordination, the ability to conduct combat with tactical com-
petence, and. to repulse fighter attacks with precision fire will make it possible for 
bomber crews. to overcome enemy countermeasures and to carry out the assigned. 
mission succetssfully.

THE COMBAT CAPABILITIES OF FIGHTERS 
AND A METHOD FOR DETERMINING THEM 
Candidate of Military Sciences Col. V Ya.Kudryashov, 
Lt. Col. P. G. Nikitin 
For the correct utilization of fighter strength and an objective evaluation of the 
anticipated, results of operations it is necessary to know the fighters' combat capa-
bilities in the execution of a definite combat mission and in a .specific situation. 
However, until this time it has not been possible,, in our, opinion, to consider the 
question of a method for determining combat capabilities as completely solved. 
There is no uniformity of interpretation of the term "the combat capabilities of 
fighters." Various .meanings are included in this concept. Thus, the probability 
of hitting the enemy in aerial combat, determined by the ballistic prediction or by 
the correlation of rounds per second from the weapons of the fighter and. of the air-
craft attacked by him, is sometimes taken as the basis of the combat capabilities 
of fighters. 
The essence of this concept, it seems to us, is bound up with the result of carry-
ing out a specific mission, the outcome of which is conditioned by various factors ? 
the utilization of the aircraft's characteristics, the pilot's morale and. training ? 
constituting, as a whole, the combat potential. We believe that by the combat capa-
bilities of fighters is rightly meant only that anticipated result which can be attained 
by carrying out a mission in its entirety more precisely, the losses which can be 
inflicted, on the enemy in the air. 
The quantity representing the combat capabilities of an individual aircraft or of 
a group of fighters must answer the following questions: What is the magnitude of 
the mission which they are capable of carrying out? Or what results can be ex-
pected from the operations of a single aircraft or a group of them in a definite com-
bat situation? Therefore, for example, the combat capabilities of a certain fighter 
unit in repulsing an enemy bomber raid. will be. represented by the number of bombers 
which it is capable of repulsing in a given situation. 
Generally the carrying out of any combat mission will, in the last analysis, be 
conditioned by the fighters' capabilities of inflicting such losses against the air ene-
my as will force him to give up his intentions. 
For the exact determination of the combat capabilities of fighters, all the factors 
on which they depend must be taken into consideration. Unfortunately, up to the 
present there is no such method and apparently it is extremely difficult to work one 
out. 
Anticipated., results of aerial combat, determined, by a comparison of only the 
probability of a hit, or of the fighter and enemy aircraft rounds per second, are not 
borne out by reality. This is not accidental. As is well known, aerial combat is 
basically a combination of maneuvering and. firing. Therefore, its result is deter-
mined. mainly by the firing and maneuvering characteristics of aircraft. But in

determining the result of a fighter's action against the enemy by a comparison of 
rounds per second or of the possibilities of mutual destruction, only the aircraft's 
firing capabilities are taken into consideration. But a fighter plane is a unique car-
rier of the arms mounted on it. Therefore, its capabilities of destroying aerial 
targets depend on how favorable the conditions created. for the use of these arms are. 
All this can be corroborated by means of an example. Let us suppose that the 
attacking side has jet aircraft at its disposal with a combat ceiling of 15 km and. a 
maximum flight speed of 1200 km/hr. For the purpose of offering countermeasures, 
the side defending itself has fighters with rate of fire per second considerably ex-
ceeding the rate of fire? per second from the weapons of the enemy aircraft, but is 
inferior to them in flight and. tactical characteristics (combat ceiling 12 km, maxi-
mum speed 1000 km/hr). The question arises: Will the fighters of the defending side 
be able to repulse the enemy air raid with the enemy operating at altitudes of 14-15 
km or at lower altitudes, but at maximum speed.? 
In the first case, without a doubt, the fighters of the defending side will not be 
able to repulse the enemy, regardless of their great firing capabilities. In the 
second, the execution of the mission Will be limited., since the fighters will not be 
able to use their weapons effectively. In fact, even if they are vectored to an ad-
vantageous position for attacking the enemy aircraft, to a range of 1000 m in the 
rear hemisphere, in order to fire, it will be necessary for them to sight first. If 
only 3 seconds are spent on this, then by the moment of opening fire, taking into ac-
count the time of flight of the missiles, the target will have moved approximately 
240-250 m away. Taking into account the initial range, this constitutes approximate-
ly. 1200 m, i. e., the target will have alread.y left the zone of effective fire of the 
fighters with more powerful artillery weapons. Practically speaking, it is very 
unlikely that they will hit it. 
In determining a fighter'a capabilities of hitting a target, it is impossible not to 
take into consideration as well the existing aerial situation and. the pilot's morale 
and combat qualities. Consequently, the probability of a hit and a fighter's fire 
superiority over enemy aircraft still do not entirely characterize the fighter' s capa-
bilities of destroying aerial targets. This means that these data are not the only 
and final criterion for determining the anticipated result. 
in order to find, a criterion for determining the fighters' capabilities of destroying 
aerial targets, let us analyze aerial combat as a physical phenomenon. From this 
point of view it is possible to present it as a clash of two opposing forces. It is 
well known that in principle the greater force wins. This means that in aerial com-
bat as well the one who is stronger, who has or attains superiority in the course of 
battle, Wins. 
It may be objected that in actual combat a weak enemy sometimes defeats a strong 
opponent. Such cases are very rare. But even if they are encountered., then, in 
the last analysis, it is, nevertheless, the result of a manifestation of greater force. 
Besides this, it is not possible to consider the forces clashing in aerial combat 
as ssomething homogeneous. They are an intricate complex of such component part $ 
as the characteristics of the aircraft and of the weapons, the pilot's physical condi-
tion and morale, and. his skill. 
The objective factors conditioning the attainment of superiority by a fighter over 
the enemy in aerial combat are, above all, the aircraft's flight and tactical. character-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
The Combat Capabilities of Fighters 17 
istics: maximum speed., rate of climb, service ceiling, braking time and time of 
acceleration to maximum speed., and. maneuverability in the horizontal and vertical 
planes. 
Obviously, the higher these fighter qualities are in comparison with those of the 
enemy, the greater the superiority over him will be and the easier it will be for the 
fighter to be able to overcome the enemy's countermeasures, to implement subjective 
factors more completely, and, as a result of all this, to use his weapons more suc-
cessfully. 
Therefore, we may assert that a fighter's superiority over an enemy aircraft in 
aerial combat determines the capability and degree of utilization of the power of the ? 
weapons mounted on it, i. e., it conditions the d.egree to which its firing capabilities 
may be realized.. These capabilities, under given firing conditions, are determined 
by the ballistic prediction along with consideration of the nature of the target, of fir-
ing and sighting conditions, of the effectiveness of the ammunition and. of the level* 
of the pilots' training; and they are expressed by the probability of a hit. If the 
probabilities of a hit (W) and. the degree of the fighter's superiority over the enemy 
(C) are known, then the fighter's capability of destroying aerial targets (B) can. be 
found. by the equation B = CW. 
Thus, to determine a fighter's capability of destroying aerial targets it is neces-
sary to know the probability of a hit (firing capabilities) and the degree of superiority 
of his flight and tactical characteristics over those of the target under attack. 
In order to establish a method for determining the degree of a fighter's superiori-
ty in aerial combat, let us return to the analysis of the essence of aerial combat. 
The superiority of one oppositely directed, force over another is equal to the dif-
ference of these forces. And. the surplus of greater force will characterize the 
degree of manifestation of its ascendancy over the lesser force. That part of the 
greater force which is equal to the lesser will be neutralized. 
Considering aerial combat as a clash of oppositely directed. forces, it is not dif-
ficult to establish that these forces are determined by the characteristics of the air-
craft and. pilots. The general result of a manifestation of superiority is an algebraic 
sum of the relations of the performance margins of a certain flight and. tactical char-
acteristic of a fighter to the corresponding characteristic of an opposing aircraft. 
For example, an air battle is taking place between two fighters possessing the 
following characteristics: F1 has a speed. of 1100 km/hr, a maximum angular speed 
of 9?/sec, and, a maximum vertical speed. of 60 m/sec; F2 has a speed of 1000 km/hr, 
a maximum angular speed of 100/sec, and. a maximum vertical speed. of 60 al/sec. 
The fighters met under identical tactical conditions. 
Let us determine the degree of superiority of one of them over the other: 
a comparison of these characteristics one can see that the speed of fighter F1 is 
greater than the speed of fighter F2 by 100 km/hr and that fighter F2 surpasses 
fighter Fi in angular speed. by 1?/sec. Making use of the explanation cited. above, 
let us find, the degree of superiority C. Solving the problem with regardto aircraft 
F1 we get: 
From 
1100- 1000  _ 10 - 9 60  - 60 _ 1 
1000 9 60 90 
If we solve the problem with respect to fighter F2 , we get the same quantity, but

18 V Ya. Kudr a shay P. G. Nikitin

of the opposite sign. The value of the degree of superiority shows that, in a tactical 
air battle, overall superiority will be on the side of fighter F. This can guarantee 
him the possibility of realizing his fire power in aerial combat with fighter F1 to 
.1190 of its maximum value. 
? But if the first fighter does not enter into tactical aerial combat and avoids tacti-
cal errors, then fighter F2, even with the above-mentioned. degree of superiority, 
will not attain victory, since fighter F1, possessing the superiority in speed, can 
prevent fighter F2 from approaching the range of effective fire. This means that 
in aerial combat fighters must competenly utilize those aircraft characteristics in 
which they surpass the enemy aircraft. 
It should be noted that the degree of a fighter's superiority over a target under 
attack may considerably exceed. unity, as, for example, in combat with transport 
plane's. It would. seem that in such cases fighter capabilities of hitting aerial tar-
gets can be very great. However, this is not the case. A fighter's superiority 
over a target does not increase his fire power but only d.etermines the degree of its 
utilization, by virtue of which the fighter's capabilities of hitting aerial targets can-
not be numerically greater than the probability of a hit under the given firing condi-
tions. A degree of fighter superiority greater than unity over a target under attack 
means that the fighter's firing capabilities may be used. to their full extent. 
Consequently, in those cases where the degree of a fighter's superiority over a 
target under attack exceed.s unity, the fighter s capability of hitting aerial targets 
will be numerically equal to the probability of hitting these targets under the given 
firing conditions. 
But if the degree of superiority is equal to zero, i. e., if the enemy plane's (fight-
ers, for example) d.o not have at their disposal the necessary superiority and cannot 
create it in the course of combat, they .will not attain victory. In fact, when C is 
equal to zero, even with a great value of W, the possibility of a hit will be equal to 
zero, since 0 ? W = 0. 
The same picture i.s obtained, in an inverse correlation of superiority and. of the 
probability of a hit. The latter gives U.S the right to conclud.e that a fighter has at 
his disposal the greatest capability of destroying aerial targets when he has high 
firing characteristics and a degree of superiority not less than unity. 
Experience shows that in order to obtain success in present-day fighter combat, 
'superiority must be created. early, before establishing direct contact with the target. 
This is .explained. by the fact that enemy planes can observe each other at considerable 
distances. .When it is possible to control the closing in of fighters on an aerial tar-
get, they, without a doubt, will endeavor to attain superiority before entering into 
combat. 
Thus, we have established that the criterion of the combat capabilities of fighters 
is their ability to inflict defeat on the enemy, which in turn depends on the probabili-
ty of hitting the aerial target and. on. the degree of superiority of the fighter 's flight 
and tactical characteristics over those of the enemy aircraft. 
'Knowing one fighter's capabilities, it is easy to find the anticipated result of4c-
tion against the enemy for any group of.fighters carrying out a specific combat mis-
sion. If the general composition of a group of fighters is designated. by Nf , and 
the relation of the number of active fighters to the general composition of the group

enemy (N) will be: 
N = BKNf or N = CWKNf 
where N is the number of destroyed. enemy aircraft. 
From the possible result of the action of a group of_fighters against enemy air-
craft in a given situation (N), and from the losses which it is necessary to inflict 
upon the enemy in ord.er to force him to give up carrying out his combat mission 
(Pn in %), it is possible to determine the combat capability of a given group of fight-
ers in repulsing a bomber raid.. 
It will be expressed by the ratio N %. 
Pn 
It should be noted. that it is rather difficult to establish exactly the number (in 
percentages) of enemy aircraft which it is necessary to destroy in. order to attain 
the above-mentioned, objective, for the latter depends on the specific aerial situation 
and the morale and. combat qualities of the flight personnel. Not excluded, is the fact 
that the repulsion of a group of enemy aircraft will take place after it loses 25-30% 
of its general composition, as often happened. during the years of WWII and the Great 
Patriotic War. In general there can be no guarantee that under definite conditions 
the enemy will not make great sacrifices, if only to reach his objective. As regards 
the repulsion of pilotless facilities for aerial attack or of individual aircraft at night 
and. in the daytime under adverse weather conditions, here it is generally senseless 
to compute any sort of percentage of destruction, since all targets must be destroyed.. 
Thus, the combat capabilities of fighters, like the ability to carry out a specific 
combat mission of repulsing enemy aircraft raids, will be expressed. by the function 
CWICNf with Pn % as the losses necessary for repulsing the enemy. Knowing the 
Pn 
composition of a group of enemy aircraft, the number of active friendly fighters and. 
the capabilities of one fighter, and. the losses which it is necessary to inflict upon the 
enemy, it is possible to determine the number of fighters necessary for carrying out 
a specific combat mission Nf. , n = Ne' Pn  , where N fin is the number of fighters 
CWK 
necessary for carrying out .a combat mission, and. where Ne is the composition of the 
enemy group. 
Let us determine the combat capabilities of a fighter element in repulsing a bomber 
raid, if the capability of each of them in the destruction of aircraft of a given type cor-
respond.s to a value equal, for example, to 0.9. Let us take the number of active 
fighters in the element as equal to three, i. e. , out of four fighters three fire direct-
ly at the target. Let us assume that in order to repulse the raid it is necessary to 
destroy 50% of the bombers. 
On the basis of the aforementioned, formula we get combat capabilities of the 
element  0. 9 ? 0. 56 ? 0. 75 ? 4 = 3. This means that the fighter element under the 
0.5 
given conditions is able to repulse a group of bombers composed of three aircraft. 
Consequently, if one takes the mean values of such quantities as the number of 
attacks, the amount of bursts per attack, the range and. angle-off of fire, the per-
centage of aircraft destruction necessary to disrupt the enemy's combat mission for

a definite group composition of friendly fighters and. enemy aircraft, then it is possible 
to determine the mean Values of their combat capabilities in carrying out specific mis-
sions. These data may be taken as tactical norms for planning the combat operations 
of fighters. At the same time, of course, the morale, combat qualities and experience 
of the flight personnel should. not be neglected..

THE MORAL MAKE'-UP OF THE SOVIET PILOT 
V.I. Lenin, the founder of the Communist Party, the Soviet State, and its Armed. 
Forces, taught that in every war victory depends to a large d.egree on the moral 
staunchness of the troops. Under modern conditions, at a time when the imperialis-
tic aggressors are preparing intensively for war with the use of atomic weapons and. 
other means of mass destruction, the role of the moral factor has increased, even 
more. Tile Minister of Defense, Marshal of the Soviet Union G. K. Zhukov, while 
delivering a speech at the All-Army Conference. of Outstanding Men, said emphatical-
ly: "No matter what powerful weapons armies possess, the decisive role in achieving 
victory over the enemy belongs to the people who have high moral and, combat.quali-
ties, and. who know how to apply the entire strength of weapons and. equipment." 
And. who is to implant such qualities in the men? First of all, the officer person-
nel. The body of officers is the skeleton of the army, which holds together the 
troops as one disciplined military organism. 
In the Air Force every pilot, while being an air fighter, is at the same time a 
commander. He is responsible for the training and education, of the personnel of the 
crew, sub-unit, or unit. Successful solution of all the problems depends -on his poli-
tical maturity, his military and technical culture, and, his ability for organization. 
That is why our officers above all must themselves possess high moral and. combat 
qualities. Such qualities are implanted. in them by the Communist Party and. the 
Soviet Government, which are constantly concerned, with strengthening our valiant 
Armed Forces and their most important component ? military aviation. 
The Soviet officer has devoted, his life to the glorious military prof.ession, which 
is respected. in or country and which demands from him definite moral and combat

qualities. Their aggregate is what we call the moral make-up of a Soviet officer. 
Such qualities as a high ideology, a deep devotion to the cause of Communism, an 
ardent love for their socialist Motherland and a burning hatred for its enemies, a 
Communist attitude toward labor and its results ? socialist property, collectivism, 
b.umanitarianism, and strict observance of the . rules of a socialist community ? are 
Inherent in the Soviet people who have been brought up in a Communist spirit by our 
Patti. These remarkable moral qualities, typical of Soviet man, are being d.evelop-
ed in him on the basis of a progressive social and. state system with its new social-
istic relations among people. 
The noble moral qualities inculcated by the Party in the Soviet people are embodied. 
in hill measure in its faithful sons ? the officers of the Armed. Forces. 
Selfless devotion to his socialist Motherland and unquenchable hatred for its ene-
mies are the main features of the moral make-up of the Soviet officer. 
Our officer is an ardent patriot. He is proud to be entrusted. with the defense of 
the most just social and state system in the world., and. of the great cause Of building 
Communism. It is exactly this Soviet patriotism which was the powerful source of 
the mass heroism displayed. by the personnel of our Army, Air Force, and Navy in 
the difficult years of the Great Patriotic War. 
This feeling drove N. F. Gastello to direct his burning bomber at a column of ene-
my tanks; it gave strength to A. P. Mares'yev, to L. G. Belousov, and. Z.A. Sorokin 
to return to the ranks of combat pilots even after they had. lost their legs; it inspired. 
M. P. Devyatayev and his comrades to continue their courageous struggle with the 
enemy under the hard. conditions of captivity and. to accomplish their bold flight home 
on an aircraft captured from the Hitle rites. 
The many thousands, many millions of heroes who bravely defended, their native 
land in times of severe trial in. the last war showed, the greatest devotion to their 
Fatherland.. 
It is typical of officers in capitalistic armies that the choice of military service, 
for the overwhelming majority, is dictated not by patriotism at all but by career and, 
business interests. Brought up in the spirit of bourgeois morality they place materi-
al interests above everything. American flyer Donald. S. Searman, whose plane was 
brought down in the Korean war, frankly declared: "I became a pilot because it pays 
well. " 
Such indifference toward one' a native land. is typical of the American Armed. Forc-
es ? not only in individual cases. In connection with this, an article published, in. 
the American magazine "Liberty" under the curious title "Aren't Americans Cowards?" 
is very characteristic. The author of the article, William Bradford. Huie, analyz-
ing the facts which showed. how the Americans avoided military service and. fighting 
at the front during WWII, informs us that 10% of all the commissioned, officers of the 
U. S. Army were court-marshalled during the war for avoiding participation in battle, 
and. that 4000 commissioned officers dodged. combat by inflicting injuries on them-
selves. In conclusion, Huie writes: "If you sum up the total of all 'psychos', 
'cowards', 'parasites' and. those who 'do not care', then, according to the most cauti-
ous calculations, you will have to admit that at least four million physically healthy 
Americans of military age turned out to be either incapable or unwilling to fight for 
their native country during WWII." 
The Soviet soldier is ready to give his life for his Motherland.. While in wartime

? 
The Moral Make-up of the Soviet Pilot 23 
the Soviet officer's patriotism has shown itself in a selfless struggle against the 
enemy, in peacetime his patriotism is seen in his concern for strengthening the com-
bat preparedness of his sub-unit and. his unit, in preparing Outstanding Men in. com-
bat and. political training, in persistent striving to attain the honorable title of Out-
standing Man. 
The Soviet patriot combines an.ardent love for his Motherland with an unquench-
able hatred. for its enemies. Is it-not a legitimate hatred that arises in each one of 
us when we see how brazenly the American imperialists and their accomplices act 
against the Soviet Union and against all peace-loving countries? Can there be any-. 
thing but indignation when we see them openly appropriating hundreds of millions 
of dollars for "secret war" against the countries of the socialist camp, organizing 
espionage, diversions, and. even armed provocations? But our hatred. for the Pre-
datory imperialists has nothing in common with the animal hatred cultivated in the 
bourgeois armies. There they try to waken beastly instincts in men and officers, 
making ravishers and. killers of them and. preaching to them their racial superiority 
over other nations. An ideology of racial hatred toward men is alien to us. We 
are internationalists. We do not and. cannot have hatred toward other nations,. but 
we do hate those who oppress and. exploit the workers, those who are enemies of 
freedom and. progress, and those who cherish a delirious hope of establishing their 
supremacy over the whole world.. 
Hatred. toward enemies is not an abstract emotion. During times of military 
stress it demands from the Soviet officer the achievement of victory over the enemy 
even at the cost of his life. During the past war our pilots,too, fought against their 
enemies to the d.eath. 
On 22 June 1941, Komsomol member,Flight Commander Junior Lt. L. G. Butelin 
took off for a combat mission. He attacked. Hitlerite troops and waged. aerial com-
bat until his ammunition gave out. On his return he met a Fascist Ju-88 bomber 
near our airfield,. Leonid. Butelin boldly rushed, to the attack and rammed the ene-
my aircraft with the propeller of his fighting machine. This took place at 0515. 
Butelin died a hero's Oath but destroyed the Fascist pirate. Thus, at the very be-
ginning of the Great Patriotic War an air ramming was accomplished. On. the same 
day around. 1000, yet another Soviet-pilot; Peter Ryabtsev, executed a ramming near 
Brest. 
Only exceptionally courageous pilots are capable of such exploits,. pilots who- . 
deeply realize their personal responsibility for the cause of their Motherland's pro-
tection and who hate their enemies mortally. 
In time of peace the soldiers' hatred. for the enemies shows itself in a high revo-
lutionary vigilance. 
What does it mean for an officer to be vigilant? 
It means to fulfill unflinchingly all the demand.s of the oath and the regulations 
on keeping State and. military secrets, to observe strictly the procedure established. 
for keeping documents. - It means being scrupulous in the choice of acquaintances ? 
and of places for relaxation and entertainment, not talking too muchwhen at work 
and even less when not at work, But the most important thing is to organize the 
life of a =it or outfit so as to achieve a high degree of constant combat readiness. 
The way to achieve this is to maintain strict order and. iron discipline. 
Discipline is the basis of the combat readiness and. fighting efficiency of troops

in Peacetime, it is the mother of victory in wartime: Discipline is one of the most 
necessary moral and. combat qualities .of an officer. GUards Capt. G. P. Maslovskiy, 
a 'Communist and a hero of the Great Patriotic War, stated. this remarkably .in a let-
ter to his son just' before he died: "...Well, my dear son,we won't see each other 
anymore. An hour ago, I received. from the d.ivision commander an assignment from 
which I. shall not return alive. Don't be afraid. of this, my lad, and don't lose heart. 
Be as proud. as. your daddy is in going to his death, because not everyone is permitted 
to die for Es Motherland... 
"Lenin's glorious city ? the cradle of the Revolution is in danger. Its future 
welfare depends on the fulfilment of my mission. For the sake of this great good 
I shall carry out my mission to my last breath, to the last drop of my blood.. I have 
no intention of refusing such a mission; on the contrary, I am burning with the de-
sire to accomplish it as soon as possible. 
"...What is the power that helps to accomplish such a heroic deed.?" ? asks 
Maslovskiy. And he answers: 
"Military discipline and obedience to the Party. It is true what they say: there 
is only one step from discipline to heroism. Keep this in your mind., son, once and 
for all...I am telling you about everything in detail, because I want you to know what 
kind of a person your father was, what he gave his life for and. how. When you grow 
up, you will understand., you will care for your Motherland.. It is good., it is very 
good. to cherish one's Motherland! ? .. " 
A pilot needs strict discipline not only during war or flying. Discipline is in-
dispensable everywhere. 
Lack of discipline is a sign of a person's weak will. He who has a strong will 
always controls his actions wisely. A strong-willed. officer is notable not only for 
his high discipline but also for his presence of mind, in a difficult situation. It is 
when exposed to danger that he shows audacity, courage, and. valor. 
Courage is the ability to overcome fear, to subordinate fear to sense of duty; it 
is a willingness to give, if necessary, one's life for one's Motherland. V. I. Lenin 
used. tO say that courage 'and. daring, the .absence of fear in battle, and. willingness 
to fight together with?one's people against the enemy must constitute the basic quali-
ties of the Soviet people. 
Coward.s do not conquer. We despise cowards. Coward.ice is akin to panic, 
and panic inevitably leads to defeat. But courage increases a man's strength ten-
fold. Hundred.s and thousand.s of courageous men, brave champions of the Soviet 
skies, are nurtured in our Air Force. The name of pilot A. K. Gorovets ? a Corn- , 
munist and. Hero .of the Soviet Union? occupies an honorable placeamong those of 
legendary heroes who are the pride of the Soviet people. All by himself he engaged. 
in combat against a group of enemy aircraft and. managed. to destroy nine German 
bombers! 
A pilot can be a hero in peacetime too! Here is one of many excellent examples 
of serving one's country well. Col. F. F. Opad.chiy has been working in the Air Force 
for 27 years, of these more than 20 as a test pilot. His willpower, courage, and. 
skill helped him more than once to acquit himself with honor in the most difficult 
situation. Quite recently pilot Opadchiy was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet 
Union for his courage and resourcefulness shown in testing new planes. 
The soldier is an armed. defender of his Motherland.. Consequently, he is regard.-

ed first of all as an expert in military affairs. In aviation, the success of the battle 
depends on the- skill and. initiative of the pilot, who at the same time is a soldier. As 
is kn.own, a pilot's skill is mad.e up of an irreproachable knowledge of aviation equip-
ment and. the ability to use it under any conditions. It is not necessary to prove that 
superficial knowledge or careless application of the rules for use of equipment can-
not be tolerated. Aircraft equipment is a mighty force, but only in the hand.s of a 
skillful soldier. 
The enormous advantage of the Soviet army over bourgeois armied lies in the fact 
that its personnel is brought up in the spirit of socialist collectivism. In military 
circles this manifests itself in combat friendship and. camaraderie among the 
troops. These remarkable qualities of the personnel of our army, a new type of 
army, are based on the moral and political unity of Soviet society and. on the inde-
structible friendship among the peoples of the Soviet country. 
What does it mean for our soldier to be a true comrade and friend? The answer 
to this question is given in the Regulations of the Internal Service, which demand 
that every service manilas sist his comrades by word and. deed., restrain them from 
untoward actions, and help them out in times of crisis without regard. for personal 
safety." 
Mutual help and support in combat:these are the main signs of true friendship. 
Soviet officers have risked, their lives to save their comrades who were facing dif-
ficulties. Many such feats could. be mentioned. 
Pilot and Communist Capt. I. G. Shkondin recently showed an exciting example of 
faithfulness to military camaraderie. During a flight mission a fire broke out on a 
heavy bomber. It was impossible to extinguish it. The navigator was severely 
burned and lost consciousness. 
The commander ordered the crew to bail out. An incoming burst of air dispersed 
the smoke. Shkondin noticed. that, the navigator had not left the plane and. was not 
able to do so. What was there to do? Save himself and abandon his comrade? No, 
Communists do not act this way. Capt. Shkondin made up his mind, to land. the burn-
ing plane on a field. Soldiers who happened to be near-43y came running to the site 
of the emergency landing and quickly put out the fire. The comracte's life was saved. 
Another indication of troop camaraderie is devotion to Communist principles. A 
true friend, will not be indifferent to the errors and shortcomings of his comrade but 
will try to restrain him from any untoward actions which disgrace the honor of the 
outfit or unit, will help him correct shortcomings in his .studies and. behavior. He 
will not be afraid to tell his friend candidly of his faults and., if this does not help, 
he will criticize him sharply in public. 
Socialist collectivism with its principle, "man is friend to man," is not to be 
separated. from socialist humanism. Humanism,. e., love of mankind., is one of 
the typical traits of the Soviet officer's moral make-up. This noble quality shows 
itself in respect for people, in tactfulness to subordinates, and. in concern for them. 
How often our men and officers lovingly call their strict and. demanding but never-
theless just ? superior "father"! With such a commander they will go through 
thick and thin. 
A superior 's respect for and humane treatment of his subordinates inspire the 
soldier to fulfill his duties even better. It was not without reason that M. I. Kalinin 
said in one of his speeches before a- military audience: "If you have the opportunity 
50-Yr 2013/10/31: CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050009-7 
The Moral Make -u' of the Soviet Pilot 27 
to be a superior, ,then be not only a superior but also a friend to your subordinates." 
The superior is the friend, of his subordinates! This is possible only in the army 
of a socialist state. He0 who violates this principle in. his relations to his subordi-
nates, who is rud.e and insults their civil dignity, undermines his authority as a -corn-
mand.er of the Soviet Armed. Forces. 
Very important moral qualities of the Soviet officer are ,also his truthfulness and. 
honesty. Any d.eception on the part of the commander or of companions-in-arrns 
even in peacetime, to say nothing about wartime, causes serious damage to the in-
terests of the cause. 
Think, for, instance, about the relations between the pilot and the technician, or 
between the pilot and. the mechanic. Is it not clear that the safety of the flight and. 
sometimes even the crew's lives depend. very much on the technician's or mechanic's 
honesty? Consequently, relations of mutual. trustbetween them are necessary. 
And what happens if a pilot begins to act against his conscience before his com-
mander? For instance, a pilot makes a mistake, even though to him it Seems a 
most insignificant one in the technique of piloting, but holds it back in his report to 
the commander about his operations in the air. It is clear that this error will not 
be corrected; but,repeated. many times,it can become a harmful habit and. may lead. 
to a serious accident. Under conditions of war the pilot's untruthfulness can lead. 
to the sacrifice of innocent victims. 
More often than not, a soldier's untruthfulness can be explained, by a feeling of 
false shame, by anunwillingness to place himself in an =favorable light before his 
commander and. his comrades. But who can say about himself that he has never 
been wrong? V.I. Lenin said that the intelligent person i not the one who makes 
no mistakes. There are not and. can not be such people. Only he is intelligent who, 
having mad.e a mistake, bravely admits it and. is able to set it right. 
The description of the moral make-up of the Soviet soldier will not be complete 
if nothing is said about his behavior in everyday life. , With a healthy mode of living, 
normal family relations, and. well-brought-up. children, a man feels cheerful; has ? 
more energy, and works successfully. Without this a man is restless and. nervous, 
all of which is reflected. in his service activity. 
Some officers still think that their behavior in. everyday life is their private affair. 
It is not hard. to understand. how wrong and harmful such ideas are. 
The main and decisive role in indoctrinating officers,with high moral and 'combat 
qualities belongs to the commander. The Party and the government have made him 
wholly responsible for the combat readiness of the unit and, the, outfit, for the training. 
and. indoctrination of the personnel. It is in the process of training and. indoctrina-
tion that the moral and combat qualities indispensable to the aviator are formed.. The 
more a commander relies in his work upon the political apparatus, upon the Party 
and. Komsomol organizations, the greater his success as a military leader and educa-
tor. 
At. one time M. I. Kalinin pointed, out that the indoctrination of people, especially 
of military people, is a complicated, and. delicate affair. There is no prescription 
or pattern for it. Required. of commanders is a consideration. of the specific pecu-
liarities of the situation and the problems to be solved, a tactful approach to the 
men,' an. ability to utilize all means and. forms of indoctrination. -

Force Commander A. 1. Sokolov. The commanders and political workers subordi-
nated. to him do their work not formally but with all their heart. First of all the of-
ficers go through the process of combat training. During flights the commanders 
do not tolerate any leniency or conventionality but try to create a setup very close 
to a combat situation. 
To Increase the sense of responsibility for carrying out official duties and to 
inculcate a conscientious attitude toward., work, all forms and. means of Party and 
political work are used: lectures, group and individual discussions, meetings, 
theoretical discussions, the press, visual propaganda, and mass-cultural projects. 
in the work of the ideological and political indoctrination ofthe officers, the 
leader personnel takes an active part. Thus, to assist officers studying Marxist-
Leninitt doctrine on war and the army, comrade A. I. Sokolov delivered a lecture 
on the subject: "The role of V.I. Lenin in the creation of the Soviet Armed. Forces"; 
officer D. I. Lyapinkov delivered a lecture on "Soviet military science and. its advan-
tages over bourgeois military science," etc. Our leader officers do not avoid con-
tact with their subordinates in off-duty hours. This brings them closer to the mass 
of officers, and gives the officers an opportunity to speak freely about everything 
that worries them and. to get advice from their older comrades who have more ex-
perience in aviation and. in everyday life. Unfortunately, one cannot say that all our 
commanders have already appreciated the importance and. the necessity of contact 
with their subordinates in off-duty hours. 
The experience of the commander and. political workers in working with the young 
officers deserves attention. Recently the command., together with the most active 
members of the Party, organized a check on and a study of the work with. young of-
ficers. It turned out that here and. there little work had. been done with the young 
people, that they had not always been helped in integrating themselves into the ranks 
of combat pilots fast enough, the proper concern had not been given them in arrang-
ing their everyday life. The results of the check were discussed with the leader of-
ficer personnel, and. measures were taken to correct the shortcomings revealed. The 
young officers were inspired with hope, their mood became better, and discipline im-
proved. 
In the Soviet Armed. Forces great and. honarable tasks are 'entrusted to Party orga-
nizations. Their first and. foremost duty is: indoctrinating Communists in the 
spirit of the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, of irreconcilability with shortcomings; 
ensuring that Party members and candidates set a personal example in combat train-
ing and discipline, in. observance of the military oath and in carrying out the require-
ments of military regulations and orders; comprehensive strengthening of one-man 
control and. authority of the commanders. But the role of Army and Party organi-
zations is not limited to this alone. They are obliged, to guid.e the Komsomol organi-
zations constantly, to take care of the political and military training of the members 
of VLKS,M [All-Union Leninist Young Communist League] . At the same time, as the 
"Instructions to the CPSU Organizations in the Soviet Army and. Navy" emphasize, they 
have to know all the needs and temperaments of all the personnel, to try to understand. 
all aspects of life in the unit, to assist the commander and. his political deputy in solv-
ing the ,problems of political and military training of the personnel, and to popularize 
the experience of outstanding officers, sergeants, and. men.

The Moral Make-up of the Soviet Pilot 29 
 'VEINS 
to raise their ideological-theoretical level. A person's behavior d.epend.s after all 
on his convictions. The high ideals of the Soviet officer, his profound, conviction 
of the righteousness and. invincibility of the Party's great cause ? Communism ---
these are what determine the noble traits of his moral make-up. 
These Communist convictions of the officer manifest themselves in his ability 
to evaluate the phenomena and. events of social life, the activities and. actions of the 
people around. him and. of himself, from the standpoint of the Party. Such ability is 
developed by studying Marxism-Leninism. 
Studying Marxism-Leninism thoroughly, our officers not only enrich themselves 
ideologically but also master the true scientific method., which permits them to do - 
their practical work Successfully. It is impossible to master Soviet military, science 
to perfection without mastering Marxist-Leninist theory, and. without this one can-
not become a valuable military specialist. 
While explaining daily the wise policy of the Communist Party to all officers and. 
men and. showing them the progress in building Communism achieved. in 40 years 
of Soviet rule under the leadership of the Party, the commanders, political workers, 
and. Party and Komsomol organizations develop in them a pride in their mighty' so-
cialist Motherland and increase their sense of personal responsibility for defending 
its state interests. 
The constant combat readiness of Soviet officers serves as the basic criterion 
for the conscientious performance of their official duties. It is necessary to in-
crease their military knowledge continuously, to strive for perfect mastery of the 
newest combat equipment, of all way.s and. method.s of conducting modern warfare and 
methods of training subordinates. 
The leading principle in the training and indoctrination of officer cadres, as of all 
the men, is to teach the troops everything that is necessary during a war. 
The heroic history of our Armed. Forces offers very rich material for the train-
ing and. indoctrination of our officer cadres. Lectures and. discussions about the 
combat traditions of the Soviet Army, of One's own unit or group, meetings of the 
young officers with the unit's veterans, with participants, in the Great Patriotic War, 
with Heroes of the Soviet Union, and. with' Heroes of Socialist Labor all these and. 
many other things are an effective form of patriotic indoctrination of the soldiers. 
All the time, more and more new names are being added to the annals of the Soviet 
Air Force; these are the names of people whose loyal service to their socialist 
Motherland have earned nationwid.e recognition. 
These are the names of outstanding test pilots: Yu.A.Antipov, S. M. Antonov, 
D. V. Gaponenko, V. G. Ivanov, N. A. Korovin, N. I. Korovushkin, V. S. Kotlov, L. M. 
Kuvshinov, V. G. Romanyuk, A. V. Sarigin, and. A. K. Starikov. 
The life at of these famous pilots who have tested. hundr ed.s of aircraft are 
worthy examples for young aviators. It is from the veterans that the young people 
have to learn selflessness in fulfilling their military duty, heroism and. endurance, 
Bel- control and resourcefulness, precise skill, and. readiness to overcome the 'most 
difficult obstacles on the way to the goal assigned.. 
Comprehensive improvement in the work of commanders, political organs, Party 
and. Komsomol organizations in ideological political and. military training of the of-
ficer personnel is the key to the further progress of combat readiness.

FORTY YEARS IN THE RANKS 
News about the victory of the October Socialist Revo-
lution spreading quickly all over the country reached. the 
front. The news was received joyfully by S.A. Krasovskiy, 
a young Belorussian peasant dressed in a soldier's great-
coat-. Even after the February Revolution he had felt and. 
understood that the Bolshevik slogans were nearest and. 
dearest to him. Now he, immediately took the proletariat's 
side and. took an. active part in the struggle for strengthen-
ing the Soviet regime. He was electedl. chairman of the 
soldier's' committee of the 25th Corps iair detachment. Soon 
Stepan Akimovich joined the ranks of the Red Guards and, 
with weapon in hand.,participated in the battles against ,the 
German invaders who were trying to smother the young 
Soviet republic. 
After February 1918 S.A. Krasovskiy, in different 
air detachments of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, 
participated in battles on the Eastern front, at Astra-
khan' and Tsaritsyn, and in the Caucasus; he headed. 
Communist groups in the struggle with the counter-
revolutionary rebellions of the kulaks. As an active 
and fighting member of the Communist Party (he was 
accepted. in its ranks in August 1918) in 1920 S.A. 
Krasovskiy was appointed military commissar of the 
detachment and later commissar of the Field HQ of 
the Air Force of the Eleventh Army on the Caucasian 
front. 
After the Civil War Stepan Akimovich improved. 
his military knowledge, completed. the higher academ-
ic courses for the improvement of Air Force command. 
cadres, and. later graduated. from the operations de-
partment of the VVA [Air Force Academy]. He held. 
a series of command. posts -- from squad.ron corn-
mand.er to commander of an Air Force district. S. A. 
Krasovskiy applied, all his knowledge and energy to 
the training and indoctrination of the personnel and. 
strove resolutely for its high combat readiness. 
Then the Great Patriotic War started.. General S. A. Krasovskiy was one of those 
who went through both the bitterness of failure in the first year of the Hitlerite in-
vasion and. the joy of victory over the Fascist barbarians, In the fall of 1941, as 
Air Force commander of the 56th Army, he organized combat activities of the air 
units at Rostov. Stalingrad., Voronezh, the Kursk bulge,Kiyev, L'vov, the Oder 
River, Berlin, Prague ? these are the places where the pilots of the Air Force 
fought under the command of Gen. Krasovskiy, one of the most talented. Air Force 
commanders, destroying the enemy's aviation in the air and. delivering powerful 
blows at his ground forces. Their contribution to the crushing of Hitlerite Germany 
was highly valued. The personnel of this Army received more than 35 commendations 
from the Supreme Commander-in-Chief for their participation in the liberation of 
cities and. large settlements and for surrounding and. eliminating large forces' of the 
enemy. Many units and. formations were decorated., scores of pilots were honored. 
with the lofty title of "Hero of the Soviet Union", and. thousands received. ord.ers and. 
The awarding to Col. Gen. S. A. Krasovskiy of the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union", 
medals. 
three Orders of Lenin, three Orders of the Red. Banner, orders of Suvorov, Second. 
Class and. of Bogdan Khmelnitskiy First Class, and. of the Red. Star is a recognition 
of his valor and. military talent. S.A. Krasovskiy also received the Czechoslovak 
ord.er of the "White Lion" and. the Polish cross "Grunwald. First Class.' 
Col. Gen. of the Air Force Stepan Akimovich Krasovskiy is 60 years old.. All 
his rich experience accumulated. in forty years of service in the Soviet Army and. 
Air Force, in battles against the enemies of our Motherland, he now gives to the train-
ing and indoctrination of aviation cadres.

READYING FIGHTERS FOR NIGHT OPERATIONS 
Military Pilot First Class, Col. Y e. V. Sukhorukov 
1. Landing of a Fighter Aircraft 
It is far from being always possible 
at Night With the Aid of a Landing Light under combat conditions to bring in an 
aircraft at night, hilly utilizing airfield 
lighting equipment, since an illuminated. airfield. will be visible from a distance of 
dozens of kilometers on a cloudless night. Landing on an airfield. whose landing-
area floodlights are in operation, with the runway brightly lit, with its approach 
lights and. light beacon on, is of course much easier than landing on a blacked-out 
- 
airfield. 
The aircraft landing light enables the pilot to be independent of ground sources of 
light. In this lies the tremendous advantage of landing with the aid of a landing light. 
We can borrow an example from our transport aviation. It is common knowledge 
that such landings have received, widespread acceptance there. On training and. 
scheduled flights, on flights entailing landing at other airfields, the flying personnel 
of transport aircraft, as a rule, makes landings solely with the aid. of a landing light, 
without the landing-area floodlights switched on. 
Transport aircraft are equipped with a more powerful lighting system and. the 
landing technique itself is easier than it is in the case of a jet fighter aircraft. How-
ever, the experience of best fighter pilots with night training proves convincingly 
that, even though landing on an unilluminated runway can be successfully mastered, 
it can only be done in those outfits where the pilots undergo regular training, instead 
of confining themselves to. using the landing light solely for additional illumination 
during taxiing and for designating their position in the air. Therefore pilots and of-
ficers who try to introduce this method into everyday practice must be encouraged 
in every way. The training must have a systematic, organized and methodically 
well-thought out character. 
Organization and operation of flights with the aid of a landing light does not re-
quire any additional expenditure of time or money. The training of the flying per-
sonnel in landing on a runway unillurninated by floodlights proceeds in the usual or-
der, from the simple to the difficult. Flights are preceded. by brief training on the 
ground.. Techniques of making the approach and. landing computation and., particu-
larly, of landing on a blacked-out runway are studied in the classroom. During 
preliminary training, the flying personnel work out the sequence of operating the 
aircraft cabin equipment, become acquainted with the problems peculiar to course 
plotting, the approach and. landing computation, and with special situations in flight. 
Training in the air begins with flying in a circular pattern in a two-place aircraft 
accompanied, by an instructor. At first the regular runway lighting is used., and 
later the brightness of the airfield lights is reduced. until they are completely extin-
guished.. From personal experience I can say that flying in a circular pattern at 
night is somewhat more difficult than it is during the day. The ground. is not visible, 
F hters for Ni ht 0 erations 33 
it is difficult to estimate the distance to light check points, and. it is often necessary 
to fly the aircraft by instruments alone. Flying in a circular pattern and Making a 
landing approach on a completely blacked-out airfield. is even more complicated. The 
pilot cannot make use of light check points to plot his course. A landing approach 
can be performed. more easily by instruments, making use of the landing system. To 
cut the time required. and. to make an accurate directional approach to the runway, it 
is better to approach it by making two 1800 turns. In doing this the pilot ignores 
light points in the vicinity of the airfield; he orientS himself entirely by the readings 
of the radio and magnetic compass, maintaining his position in space by the artificial 
horizon, the variometer, the speed. and. altitude'indicators. The methods of approach 
are the same as those in usual instrument flight. Once the aircraft is 'on the landing 
course, however, and, later, after it approaches the homing radio station., certain 
peculiarities are encountered. 
The fact is that in approaching the outer homing radio station the pilot already 
sees the approach lights and, later, the runway lights. Maintaining the heading 
under such conditions presents no difficulty. It is more complicated, to estimate the 
distance to these lights and to make the necessary calculations for let-down from an 
altitude of 200-300 meters over the outer homing radio station. 
The aircraft approaches the inner homing radio station at an altitude 'of 80-100 
meters with a constant gliding speed. The point where rounding out commences, 
located at 400-500 meters from the runway, must be approached by the aircraft at an 
altitud.e of 7-8 meters. Being well acquainted, with the altitude of these control points 
and their distance from the aircraft's touchdown position, the pilot makes a landing 
computation as if he were descending from step to step. If the pilot observes such 
a sequence, his computations will always be correct. The only correction he would 
have to make every time would be that for wind. 
Such a sequence of operations is due to the' fact that the distances between the 
homing radio station, the initial rounding-out point, and. the point of touchdown permit 
a corresponding decrease of flight speed.. Altitudes at which the stations are passed 
and at Which the initial rounding out is made enables the aircraft to descend in a grad-
ual glide with small vertical velocities at given engine. rpm. Since rounding out be-
gins at a definite distance from the runway, the aircraft touches down at a designated 
spot. 
The procedure described above of computing the landing is the same both for day 
and night, when rounding out is planned and begun in. the zone of obstruction lights or 
in the beam of the first floodlight. 
However, the approach and computation for landing with a landing ,light are per-
formed in a different manner. This is due first of all to the fact that it is harder for 
the pilot to keep track of the point of initiating the round-. out,' even though it is located. 
on the level of the obstruction lights which are quite visible from the air. The area 
on which the aircraft must be landed. is not illuminated; hence a certain tenseness on 
the part of the pilot. 
I usually carry out landing with a landing light in the following sequence. Having 
passed. the inner homing radio station at an altitud.e,of 50-60 m, I switch on the light 
and while continuing the descent I begin to distinguish the illuminated spot =the , 
ground, which becomes brighter as the aircraft approaches the ground.. If the land.-

will not be visible, while the light itself wears out consid.erably faster. In switching 
on the light later, the vision of the pilot has no time to adapt itself to following the 
illuminated, surface of the earth and. he may not have enough time to prepare for land.-
ing. 
After the landing light is switched on, the glance is transferred in the direction 
of the beam to the ground.. As the descent progresses, the illuminated, spot becomes 
brighter, the ground. is easier to discern. Now it must be 'determined, whether the 
time has come to start rounding out. A glance at the altimeter will not give a pre-
cise answer, but rather will distract attention and. can lead. to an error. Consisten-
cy in computations, gained previously by the pilot, is of great importance. With 
correct computations the aircraft must approach the line of obstruction lights at an 
altitude of 7-10 meters. From this altitud.e the ground. can, already be quite clearly 
seen and. the altitud.e is estimated. visually. But the ground is perceived, differently 
depending on whether the night is. dark or light. On a dark night the ray of light is 
brighter, the surface stands out better, and. is visible from a greater altitud.e, on a 
bright night, on the other hand, the beam is scattered., the ground is illuminated, less 
brightly, and. it may be hard.er to jud.ge accurately the altitud.e of the initial round.-out. 
Sometimes even when flying two or three nights in a row, difficulties are experienced. 
in landing because one night differs so much from another. This is where experience 
and. good. training ? which d.epend. on the regularity of night flying und.er different 
conditions ? corn e in handy. 
In making a landing with flood, lights', the pilot sees a white strip of uniformly il-
luminated ground. The glance travels along it and. the sensations at this stage of 
landing are about the same as they are in the daytime. There is virtually no dark-
ness in the field. of vision. A different picture is presented. in landing with a landing 
light. Its beam, picking out a limited, area from the surrounding darkness, provides 
sufficient illumination for perceiving the surface, and. it is possible to make a correct 
estimate of the aircraft's true altitud.e above the ground.. But the illuminated, spot 
moves with the aircraft, skims along the surface of the earth, and this in some meas-
ure distracts the attention and makes the landing more difficult. The duration of the 
process of the aircraft's rounding out and. floating above the ground., up to the moment 
of touchd.own,is short. As speed. is decreased. and the aircraft smoothly approaches 
the ground., one must look constantly in the direction of the beam. However, because 
of the increase in the aircraft's angle of ,attack, in the process of rounding out this 
beam rises, the illuminated spot on the ground. and., consequently, the direction of 
the glance, advance, and. this creates one of the difficulties. 
After landing and. the commencement of steady taxiing on the main and the front 
wheels, the landing light must be switched. off in order to prevent premature dis-
charge of the batteries. In general it must be remembered that landing illumination 
should be used. while the engine is running, thus ensuring that the generator is cut in. 
In taxiing with landing illumination pilots sometimes forget about this.. Instead, of 
taxiing with a definite speed. with corresponding engine rpm, they first speed up the 
aircraft by revving the engine, then later continue taxiing with rpm cut off. The 
landing light in such cases is fed. by the energy of the batteries and. rapidly dis-
charges them. 
The main thing required. for successful landing with a landing light is to learn to 
judge the rounding-out altitude accurately. Errors committed. in this case as a rule

make the situation more difficult further on. Indeed., the aircraft d.escend.s rapidly, 
the attention of the pilot is divid.ed, between checking the correctness of his computa-
tion and. the correct time for leveling out the aircraft. The ground. is less clearly 
visible than during an approach to an area illuminated, by floodlights, and. definitely 
worse than it is during the day. Most often under these conditions pilots begin 
rounding out prematurely. An experienced, pilot will notice this but sometimes 
the landing ends with a rough touchdown. 
In rounding out the aircraft at an altitude of less than 7 m, touchdown sometimes 
occurs at too high a speed. simultaneously on the main and. the front wheels. 
In training flights, to facilitate the directional approach after the aircraft passes 
the outer homing radio station, the lights on the runway can b.e blinked, a few times 
or switched. on for a short time. The approach is also considerably facilitated, by 
temporarily switching on several lights, making up a light line, and, d.enoting the 
width of the runway. In the area where the round-out is started., light points must 
be installed, of such brilliance as to permit the pilot to observe them from an altitude 
of 100 meters over the inner homing radio station. These lights are switched. on 
when necessary, after the aircraft passes the outer homing radio station. In prin-
ciple, it is possible to make the landing computation and. to determine the place and 
altitude for starting the round.-out by these light points. 
Pilots with experience in night flying master without special difficulties the ap-
proach to and. landing on a blacked.-out runway with illumination provided, only by 
the aircraft's landing light. Flights with the lights completely off on the airfield. 
and. on the approaches to it require great experience and continuous practice. With 
correct organization and. training methods, with a gradual transition from the simple 
to the complicated., the flying personnel will successfully master flying at night un-
d.er normal and. adverse weather conditions. 
Now a few remarks addressed. to our designers. It is well known how important 
the location of the landing light on the aircraft is. However, it is located. now on dif-
ferent types and even different aeries of aircraft of the same type in a different way: 
in the nose, under the left wing, and. on the left sid.e of the fuselage. , -There are - 
stationary landing lights as well as those which are extended. when. switched. on., Such 
variety is hardly dictated. by any special requirements. It is desirable that the land-
ing light on fighter aircraft of all types be in one place. It wouldn.'t be bad if the 
instruments, knobs, and. toggle switches in the aircraft cockpit were always located, 
in the same place. Pilots in the process of getting acquainted, with equipment fly 
different aircraft, and. are compelled, every time to get used. to a new location of in-
struments in the cockpit. Naturally it creates additional difficulties in night flying.? 
The direction of the landing-light beam in all cases and. on all aircraft must be the 
same, since the pilot is always looking at the ground. in the forward direction and. at 
a definite angle to the direction of landing. The beam of the landing light must W.u-
minate the ground. during round-out for a distance of 20-40 m ahead of the aircraft. 
If the ground. is illuminated, closer to the aircraft or further from it, errors. are un-
avoidable. Cases are known when the location of the landing light was so unfortunate 
that the beam illuminated, only the air above the ground. or created. only a small illu-
minated. spot on the ground, and. that too far ahead. of the aircraft. 
It must be noted, that the installation of a landing light so far has not created the 
best conditions under which the pilot could. make a landing with those modern aircraft

whose descent in a glide path takes place with the front of the fuselage raised. to a 
high position. 
2. Flying in a Pair ands in 
an Element on a Bright Night 
I would. also like to express my opinion on 
what seems to me an important question. 
Flying fighter aircraft on a bright night is a 
rather, complicated, form of flight training. Usually 
the pilot, before undertaking night flying, is put through a long and. hard training 
course. At first he gains practical habits in flying an aircraft on instruments in a 
closed cockpit and. Under adverse weather conditions by day and, later, by night. 
I must at this point explain that I speak of flights of a fighter pair or element on-
ly on a bright night; since on a dark night, when visibility and search are rather 
difficult and the target can actually only be located by aircraft equipped. with radar 
devices, the aircraft are flown on instruments. On a dark night the pilot d.oesn't 
see well. He can spot another aircraft only when the latter is distinguished. by air 
navigation lights. The silhouette, the shadow, and the contrail are completely un-
noticeable under these conditions. Furtherm.ore, one cannot divert one's attention 
for long from the instruments for the purpose of visual observation and. target search. 
Flights of a fighter pair or element on a bright night are quite feasible. They 
are difficult, it's true; but they give the pilots good. training under difficult condi-
tions and. can have rather extensive combat application. 
Recently I had an occasion to become acquainted, with the organization of flight 
training in unit X. They fly on prescribed route, at night in pairs only. Flying 
is necessarily done over water and over terrain unmarked. by checkpoints far from 
populated. areas. Under such conditions the commanders quite justifiably think that 
flying in pairs is less dangerous since the pilots can help each other when the neces-
sity arises. The availability of two radio compasses considerably improves orienta-
tion, instills confidence in. the pilots, and. insures reliable navigation. 
Besides, it should be clear to everyone that the combat application of fighter 
groups at night is also of practical importance. In taking off in groups, it is possi-
ble to concentrate a large number of aircraft in night patrol zones. Further em-
ployment of groups' will give a considerable advantage in comparison with operations 
by single fighters. 
If aerial combat at day and at night are compared., it is easy to notice how much 
more difficult the conditions of night combat are. In the day the enemy is spotted. 
at a -greater distance, can be seen well, and. can be attacked until completely destroy-
ed.. There are enough forces present to effect total destruction of the target, since 
it is attacked by at least a pair of fighters. 
The picture is different at night. The target is spotted. not at a great distance, 
the visibility is poor, the attack maneuver is limited,. The combat is itself brief: 
most often only one attack is made. When the target maneuvers ? or when. the pi-
lot interrupts observation? it is easily lost. 
Thus the target can be hit with certainty only by a successive introduction into 
the combat of several fighters. In introducing the fighters one by one into the com-
bat the action against the enemy will be extended. over a considerable time, and. 
vectoring to the target must be effected anew every time. If, on the other hand., a 
pair or an element of fighters is vectored to the target, a greater effect may be 
achieved. Upon spotting the target, the pilots attack it in succession; then each one 
a 
4

returns to his base or to his patrol zone by himself. 
On a bright night the following variant of the combat employment of fighters is 
possible when the leader is an aircraft equipped with a radar sight. After the group 
is vectored, to the target and, closes with it, the actions of the leader (group leader) 
facilitate spotting the enemy. 
Great possibilities are offered by the inclusion. in the makeup of a group of fight-
ers of aircraft which carry flare bombs. After the group is vectored to the target 
by ground. radar, or better yet, upon the target's detection by fighters, the carriers 
of SAB [illuminating aerial bombs] illuminate the target, while the others attack it 
one by one. 
Sometimes, especially at low altitudes, an aircraft can find itself in a zone of 
weak reception of ground. radio stations. Control is disrupted.. In such a case it 
is also advantageous to send out a fighter pair. Before the onset of unreliable com-
munications they fly together, then one of them climbs and repeats the commands as 
a relay station for the ground. radio station in vectoring the fighter to the target. 
From the above discussion, it can be seen that combat employment of fighter 
groups on a bright night has great possibilities and. can lead. to real successes in a 
sp ecific situation. 
What are the ways and methods of practical training of flying personnel for such 
flights? I will refer to the experience of the same unit X. Pilots who have ex-
perience in independent night flying are trained, in night flying in. a pair or in an 
element. Training begins with flying in a pair in which the leader is followed by 
a two-place aircraft. The instructor demonstrates techniques of closure, of format-
ing on the leader, of keeping the given distances and. intervals. The pilot masters 
the control of the aircraft under conditions of horizontal flight, climbing, descent, 
and. executing turns. 
Later the training is continued, in a combat aircraft. At first the instructor is 
the leader and. the trainee is the wingman. They take off singly. It is best to take 
up formation on a straight leg before the first turn at an altitude of 600-700 m. This 
is simpler and safer than taking up formation on a leg between the second and the third 
turns, because the wingman does not execute turns and. is not distracted by the neces-
sity of searching for the leader. 
At first it seems very difficult to fly the plane so as to keep the leader in the field 
of vision and, to formate on him. During first flights, the pilots make mistakes. In 
trying to close in on the leader as fast as possible they accelerate the aircraft and. 
experience difficulties in taking up formation. The leaders also act incorrectly 
when they make the first turn early (at an altitude of 200-300 meters), without giving 
the wingman a chance to take up his position in formation in a normal way. Upon 
seeing the leader turn, the wingman also begins to turn while still at a lower altitude, 
and cuts across the flight route. The attention of the pilot is directed. at the leader 
in order not to lose him from view. At low altitudes such actions are dangerous, 
even for very experienced pilots. 
? All flying is done with air navigation lights switched. on. On some aircraft the 
brightness of the air navigation lights can be regulated.. Depending on the visibility 
and. night conditions the pilots select the most convenient intensity (on a bright night 
they use the greatest brightness, on a dark night the least). 
Illumination of the cockpit is also of great importance. Flying in pair or element

when the cockpit is brightly lit is generally impossible since the space beyond. it is 
very hard. to see through. The best way is to observe the leader when the wingman's 
cockpit is completely dark. But this is not permissible since the pilot must clearly 
see the instruments. Therefore the most acceptable alternative is to fly with the 
instrument lighting bulbs Switched. to minimum brightness. 
Other light interference is observed in flight for instance, light reflections on 
the glass ofthe cockpit canopy. The pilot's scanning of the space outsid.e and. ob-
serving the lead plane is adversely affected. by signal lamps and. illumination of the 
instrument dials. 
The training should be conducted. on a bright night when the horizon is clearly 
visible. ? This facilitates navigation of the aircraft by the wingman, since in addi-
tion to the horizon and. the air navigation lights he also sees the silhouette of the 
lead. plane against the background. of the sky. 
It is hard. to judge the distance to a point of light at night. Therefore, in first 
flights, distance and interval are kept somewhat greater (80-100 meters). This 
facilitates formation; and. any deviations in keeping distances to the lead plane do 
not imperil the safety of the flight. In addition to observing the leader, the pilot 
can observe the horizon and. the instruments to aid him in keeping distance. Col-
lision is precluded since the distance between the aircraft is sufficiently great. 
In the first stage of training, as is shown by experience, the most difficult thing 
is formating on the leader. Taking up formation should. not be done with great ex-
cess speed; one should. not be precisly on the tail of the leader, or deviate any dist-
ance to the side. Closure in this case takes more time, but there is sufficient 
time for its execution before the first turn at an altitud.e of 600-700 m. The leader 
climbs with prescribed. forward, and vertical speeds, gives command.s to commence 
the turn, and, carries out the turn with a 20-30? bank. Taking up formation is 
facilitated if the wingman knows the speed. and. flight course of the leader. Such in-
formation is obtained on the ground or is requested, from the leader by radio. 
The training usually begins with working out flights in the right bearing. The 
wingman, located, to the rear and. on the right keeps somewhat below, which makes 
it easier for him to see the leader against the background. of the lighter sky. Fly-
ing with the wingman above is not possible, since the leader is not as easily visible 
and is easily lost. 
Conditions for flight on a moonlit night are best, since the aircraft are easily 
visible information. 
The pilot practices in. keeping prescribed, distances and intervals even before the 
commencement of flights. Aircraft are positioned. on the ground at prescribed 
distances. Pilots climb into cockpits and memorize how the aircraft look in rela-
tion to each other. They must remember what position and. dimensions the aircraft 
has on the glass of the cockpit canopy. Sometimes the position is outlined, by 
colored lines. By keeping the lead. plane within the borders of these lines, distance 
and interval are easily maintained. 
The training takes place not only in the day but also in darkness. The pilot mem-
orizes distances, gets used to orientation by air navigation lights. It is recommend.-
ed that the training be repeated. and be always given after a lapse in formation flying. 
In later flights it is better to take off in pairs. For pilots who take off in pairs 
by day and. who regularly fly by night this presents no additional difficulties. Distance 
Read. in F hters for Ni ht 0 erationS 39 
and. interval are more easily kept when they are equal to 2-3 times the length of the 
fuselage and. the span of the aircraft. 
The leader maintains accurate heading on the takeoff run, beginning the run with-
out sudden release of brakes at high engine rpm. Takeoff in pairs iii contrast to 
taking off singly, should. be somewhat prolonged.. This makes it easier for the wing-
man to keep his position during the run. After lift-off, 'while climbing, the leader 
keeps a prescribed flight regime and. flies the aircraft on instruments. The wing-
man both flies the aircraft and. keeps his distance by observing the leader. 
In practice it is more convenient to maintain formation when the distance is some-
what greater and. the interval somewhat smaller. The wingman. in such a case, in 
addition to the air navigation lights, also sees the glow of the lead plane's exhaust 
nozzle. Formating on and. taking up his position are the hardest points for the wing-
man to master. In our opinion, existing recommendations on the procedures for 
formating on the leader are not the best. They recommend that the wingmen, start-
ing from afar, approach from the direction of their bearing to a prescribed. dista.nce 
and then, by a smooth closure, establish the required interval. In this connection, 
the wingman must move sideways in the direction of the lead plane ? which is not 
without its dangers even in the daytime. 
Considerably easier and. safer is the procedure of closing in almost on the leader's 
tail, being somewhat below him and. to the side. 
If the interval is increased, excessively, it is better to continue the flight in the 
established. position. If it must be decreased, however, the' aircraft must pull back 
somewhat, shorten the interval, come up to the required. distance, and. then, by mov-
ing outward, take up the required. interval. Engine revolutions must be controlled 
smoothly without a sharp increase or decrease of thrust. 
Closure or change of formation should under no circumstances be attempted. when 
the leader is executing a turn. Closure and. formating on are only executed. on the 
straight leg during a climb or in horizontal flight. 
Sometimes it is necessary to continue the flight with extinguished air navigation 
lights. These are the most difficult conditions. It goes without saying that such a 
flight on a dark night is actually impossible in an aircraft without special equipment. 
On a bright night, by observing the lead plane, the wingman can continue flying in 
formation. His approach in the direction of the target and. his spotting of the target 
depend. on the actions of the leader. 
On the flight route or in the patrol zone orientation is mainly effected by the leader. 
He resets the radio compass to the frequency of the turning point or the paint of desti-
nation, and, keeps track of the light check points on the ground.. The wingman carries 
out the entire flight with the radio compass set to the frequency of the' airfield. from 
which he took off, keeps track of the aircraft's position by instruments, and carries 
out overall orientation. 
Night flights of an element can be made in close pairs. Distances between these 
must be great enough to enable the leader of the pair to observe the air and. to. ma-' 
neuver. Breakup of the group for landing is carried out in the same way as it is 
during the day, over the flight line, but without any sharp peeloff. Approaches and. 
landings are mad.e only singly in all cases. Despite considerable difficulties, night 
flying under adverse weather conditions is not impossible. After takeoff the pair 
penetrates the cloud, base in tight formation and. flies on the flight route. Intercep-

is in the daytime. The fact is that in the .daytime, in flying in,tight formation, the 
pilot sees the lead. plane, and this makes his flying easier. If the wingman falls 
back of the leader or moves off to one side, he rapidly loses him. Then the wing-
man peels off and. continues penetrating the cloud, cover independently, flying on in-
struments alone. Transition to instrument observation presents certain difficulties 
and cannot be mastered by all pilots right away. 
At night, the wingman does not see the configuration of the lead. plane, but orients 
himself as to his p(0,sition in space only by the leader's air navigation lights. This 
is entirely sufficient for safe aircraft piloting. 
Indisputably, mastery of the technique of flying in a pair and in an element on a 
bright night is necessary for fighter pilots. The endurance, fearlessness, and. 
initiative which are inculcated, in the flight personnel are well worth the intensive 
effort expended in the period. of training.

SOME SPECIAL FEATURES OF AIR NAVIGATION IN NIGHT FLYENti 
Military Navigator First Class, Guards Lt. Col. N. P. Nepomnyashchiy 
One of the navigators of our group was assigned. the mission of bombing a non-
illuminated, target. The approach to the bomb run had to be mad,e not by homing 
radio station but by corner reflectors. The navigator, by means of the PSBN-m, 
course-line computing sight], picked up the rad.ar blips, brought the aircraft onto 
the bomb run, sighted., and. released the bomb which fell.. .far from the target. 
What had happened.? Is it possible that the navigator's errors in his computations 
were so large? No. The reason was altogether different. The primary cause of 
the gross error in bombing was inaccuracy in piloting. The pilot had, deviated. some-
what from the required. course, and. the navigator did not notice it because he had. not 
studied. the area of the target sufficiently. The target blips had. actually not been 
picked. up (the target had. passed. by on the side, beyond. the effective range of the ra-
dar sight), and. similar blips of objects lying in the flight path of the aircraft had. 
been mistaken for the target. The navigator's main error was that he had used. 
only the PSBN for navigation on the last leg of the flight route before the target and. 
had neglected. other facilities. In this connection, it is not irrelevant to repeat the 
first and most fundamental rule: air navigation under any conditions, and particular-
ly at night, should be effected by the combined. use (actively) of the compass and. the 
watch, utilizing electronic facilities as well as navigational computing instruments. 
In night flying the navigator must work under conditions of artificial lighting in 
the cabin, which is very difficult. Therefore all his actions must be more accurate 
and more deliberate. Sometimes certain instrument controls must be operated. by 
touch, "blindly". For an experienced, navigator this is no problem. But the inex-
perienced. must gradually develop habits in operating the instruments under condi-
tions of artificial lighting in the cabin in order to operate in night flying just as ac-
curately and. confidently as in daytime flying. 
When a flight is mad.e in daytime, the navigator, even in bad. weather, can usually 
check the map with the locality, through "windows" in the clouds, for example. At 
night, especially on dark nights, in the absence of any light check points (which is 
typical of combat conditions), such a possibility is excluded. This means that all 
attention must be concentrated. on utilization of instrument and. electronic navigation-
al facilities, using them, as already mentioned, in combination. 
During twilight flights, because of the so-called. "night effect", it is very difficult 
to use the radio compass and. ground. direction finders operating on short wave. This 
effect is sometimes so strong that, for example, the radio compass begins function-
ing late at a distance from the radio station 3-4 times less than is usually the case. 
Sometimes even through the crackling and. noise in the earphones the call signs of the 
radio station can be heard. quite well, but the needle of the ARK [automatic radio 
compass] does not give the required. reading. In consideration of this circumstance, 
our navigators, during a period. when "night effect" is present, select for navigation

the earth's surface behind the conventional symbols on the flight chart. 
The same thing can also be said. of preparation for flight .utilizing a panoramic 
radar station. Before going out on the flight the navigator studies the route and. 
the system of check points, and. evaluates the objects shown on the map from the 
viewpoint of their use as radar check points. It must notbe forgotten, for example, 
that highways and railroads may serve as excellent linear check points in visual 
orientation, whereas the images, not only of these objects but even of much larger 
.area checkpoints, cannot be seen on the IKO sCope., This means that they should 
not be relied..on for night flying. The same thing can be said, of small rivers, the 
majority of which cannot be seen on the scope. Of the many check points on the 
map, the navigator should. know how to select the most important and. most reliable 
ones, of which it can be said. with the greatest probability that they can be clearly 
seen on the scope. 
Certain limits should. be set for the use of the PSBN in drawing up the navigator's 
flight plan. The possibilities of the sight must not be overestimated as regard.s 
the range of check-point visibility and. the clarity of check-point reproduction on the 
scope. For this purpose, the visibility boundaries of this or that check point may 
be marked. out on the map by a circle, the radius of which corresponds to the pre-
sumed. range of perception of the check point. 
In. order to confirm the possibility of utilizing the proposed. radar check points 
in flight and. of discovering other check points not marked. on the map, a radar re-
connaissance is mad.e of the flight route.. The pictures of the PSBN scope obtained 
in such a flight, mounted. on positive film with some interpretative inscriptions and. 
legends, make it considerably easier for the navigator to recognize a terrain on the 
scope and. are reliable material in. training the crew for a flight using the PSBN for 
navigation. 
The heading on the PSBN scope is established, on the basis of the determined drift 
angles, the angle of approach, and the compass bearing. The course angle is de-
termined with the azimuth stabilization switched off. At such time either the auto-
matic pilot is on, or the pilot hold.s the course precisely for 1-2 minutes. For mark-
ing off the course angle, the mean sighting line is superimposed on the check point 
image, and the value of the KU [angle of approach] to the check point is read. off the 
scale. 
The distance to the check points is determined, by the range marks or by means of 
a calibrated band. (for a distance not exceeding 30 km). In using the range marks, 
It is recommended that the distance on the PSBN scope be measured without any con-
tinuous delay in the scanning, and. the range scale should. be selected. so that the 
check point to which the distance is being determined, is approximately in the middle 
of the scope (half the radius of the TKO ['PPI tube face] ). 
For accurate measurement of distance with the SRP [computer] the "10-60" 
scale is set in and., after the appropriate knob is rotated., the range marker aligned. 
with the check point, while the ND [ slant range] to the check point is read. on the 
slant range scale of the SRP. 
In determining the distance to check points, it must be remembered. that if it is 
greater than three times the flight altitude, the ND is assumed to be equal to the 
horizontal range. If the distance is less than three times the altitude, the slant 
range must definitely be converted. to horizontal range, since the former will be

considerably different from and. greater than the latter. 
The position of the aircraft can. be found. by means of the PSBN by several meth-
ods: by a check point under the aircraft or in its vicinity; by two bearings of two, 
check points; by two distances to two check points; by the distance and. bearing to 
one check point. The latter method. has found. widespread application in practice 
among Air Force units as the simplest and. most convenient method, requiring no 
additional computations. 
The drift angle is also computed. by several methods. However, the radar check 
point by which the US is determined. should. meet the following requirement: that in 
moving across the scope it does not change its configuration and. does not disappear 
from the field. of vision of the sight. To this end., "reliable" check points are 
selected,: a bridge, a characteristic bend. in a river, lake, or shoreline. If an in-
habited. place or some point in a hilly terrain is selected. as the check point, the 
outline of such a check point may change drastically as the aircraft moves, or it 
may disappear entirely, and it will be difficult to follow it across the scope. 
Each. of the methods of determining the drift angle by means of the PSBN requires 
a particular sequence in operating the sight, has its own positive features, and. its 
own shortcomings. All this is known to the navigator per sormel. Only some speci-
fic conclusions mad,e by our navigators on the basis of numerous night flights are in 
order. Let us assume that the drift angle is determined, by the movement of the 
radar check point on the scope near the line of flight. If the check point is of small 
size and produces a bright pip on the scope, the movement of 4ft. 1417 
41-Irtnrfet on the 42,,f1110 
can be followed by the afterglow it leaves behind, as it skips across the scope. 
If on the scope there are no check points near the line of flight or the course line, 
but there are such check points to the right or left of the aircraft, then the US is 
determined, by taking two bearings of one check point. 
Finally, the US can be found, by two measurements of the slant range to a check 
point situated. near the course line. Our navigators frequently use the following 
variant of this method. If the check point is observed, in front at a small KU %=:-. 5-6?, 
then the navigator should. without any additional turn of the aircraft read. the KUi at 
the moment the check point is. at ND =40-30 km. After the check point' gets to half 
the distance, 20-15 km for example, the navigator reads the KU2 and. calculates the 
US by the formula: US = 2KUi - KU. 
And. how do things stand. with computation of the ground speed.? 
It is known that to determine W it is necessary to know the time during which the 
aircraft covers, some segment of the path from the check point. The navigator's 
mode of operation is selected. accord.ing to the position of the radar check point re-
lative to the line of flight. 
The ground. speed. can be calculated. by the time two identified. check points pass 
under the aircraft. This method. is simple, but the check points identified. on the 
scope d.o not always appear under the aircraft. 
If the ground. speed is measured. by the time of passing one check point, identifi-
cation of the check point is not obligatory. Speed. is determined, by the time the Check 
point passes through two range marks. To reduce error it is necessary to increase. 
the flight base to 30-40 km, to know the US, to pick a check point along the line of 
flight, and. to compute S by means of the marker of the timing signal and. not by the 
range marks.

Very convenient is the method. of determining ground. speed. when the radar check 
point is located, to the sid.e of the line of flight. This makes it possible to find. the 
W and. the US at the ?same time. The accuracy of this method. is high enough, and 
in addition side radar check points are encountered much more frequently in flight 
than are check points along the line of flight or along the aircraft's course line. 
These are some of the special features of air navigation in night flying and. meth-

A DIFFICULT EXAMINATION 
G.uard.s Maj. A N. Kiselev 
This was a hard., but long-awaited, day for Capt. Pavel Petrovich Dlyakov,one for 
which he had been preparing for a long time. More exactly it was a night, a flying 
night. 
He, as squadron.. commander, was in for a night flight under adverse weather con-
ditions in order to confirm his right to become a military pilot first class. He was 
being checked. out by the piloting technique inspector who had. arrived at the unit. 
Several months of strenuous work preced.ed. this flight. And although everything 
indicated that it would. go well, still D'yakov was as nervous as he had. been some time 
ago before his most crucial examination. He considered that in the final analysis 
the forthcoming flight would. not only sum up the work of perfecting his personal fly-
ing skills, hut also resolve a fundamental question on which, it seemed. to him, d.e-
pend.ed. his further activity as squadron commander. 
Even before his appointment to the unit D'yakov had. to perform for some time the 
functions of political deputy to the squadron commander, and, later he was transferred 
to the post of squadron commander. He coped. quite well with his work and received 
a number of commendations from the command. 
But when he reported to the same duty in a new unit the situation became rather 
unique. Really, what is to be d.one if in the squadron of which you are appointed. 
commander, your future deputy, the flight commanders, and. even the senior pilots 
have a first class rating while you have only a second. class? And. even your ex-
perience. as squadron command.er is not very great. Are you morally entitled to 
assume such a responsibility? Will you .be able to cope with it? Would it not be 
better to perform ,first the duty of deputy rather, than that of coMmander, to adapt 
yourself, to test your capabilities? 
Not only D'yakov had doubts but, quite naturally, the unit commander too, since 
he wanted to entrust the squadron to safe hands. 
Finally the senior officer approved. Capt. D'yakov as squadron commander. That 
is when D'yakov promised himself that he would d.o everything to justify this confi-
d.ence, to catch up with the best trained, pilots of the squadron, and to obtain in the, 
shortest time the rank of military pilot first class. 
What had. happened. since then? 
From the very first days in the new outfit Capt.D'yakov had. much and serious 
work to d.o. Besides his desire to raise himself to the level of pilot first class he 
had, to get fully into shape in the shortest possible time after an interruption in fly-
ing. Indeed, the flight training of an Air Force unit commander is closely tied. up 
with his activity as commander and. in the end. determines the success of all the work. 
What was the actual situation in the squadron at first? The scheduled. dates for 
checking out the piloting technique of the flying personnel were approaching. Usual-
ly this is d.one by the commander himself. But D'yakov was not entitled. to check

out the pilots since after the interruption he had. not yet been allowed to d.o this type 
of flying. This meant that the checking of the piloting technique had. to be assigned 
to the deputy. Or there is the matter of analyzing the scheduled. exercise. The corn-
mand.er himself did. not carry out this task; he only watched the operations of his sub-
'ordinates from the starting line. Again the flight would. be analyzed, chiefly by his 
deputy, Capt. N. I. Mityashin, and. by the best-trained, flight commanders ? most 
often by S. Z. Bukchin. 
Officers Mityashin and Bukchin were experienced pilots. They Und.er stood. well 
the difficulties with which their commander was confronted. and, they tried, to encourage 
him, to ,help him in any way they could. without at the same time stressing their super 
iority in the individual elements of flight training. It was clear that such a situation 
could not continue long. D'yakov realized, this well; besides, he was not used. to work-
ing in such a way. 
That is why he himself wished. to fly as soon as possible, to master the flying pro-
gram, to stand. on the same level as the best pilots of the outfit. The unit command.-
er fully understood. his d.e sire but nevertheless he could. not allow the quality of flight 
training to suffer in the slightest degree as the result of haste. His remarks follow-
ing each sortie for a check of piloting technique seemed. to stress that Capt. D'yakov 
ought not to hurry. 
The unit commander was exacting. The very first check-out flight into the zone 
by day under normal weather conditions showed. that even the least omission in the 
air did. not pass unnoticed.. The pilot carried, out the assignment. But the command.-
er merely mentioned. in passing the positive aspects of the flight, remarking that in 
the zone D'yakov piloted, calmly and with confidence. He put the main stress on the 
defects, drawing D' yakov's attention to the fact that the vertical figures were not 
being made clearly enough ("cleanly" .as the commander put it) and. that, in subse-
quent solo flights, he would. have to polish up his piloting technique. 
The officer went up again and again, carrying out the scheduled. exercises and 
working, on the elimination of the defects which had. been pointed, out to him. 
Spring came and went before the following entry appeared. in Ca.pt. D'yakov' s flight 
,log after a scheduled check-out flight into the zone for advanced flying practice: "Pi-
loting energetic, competent, confident. Has mastered. methods of teaching. I per-
mit instruction flights by day under normal weather conditions." 
It was only later that the officer understood and. really appreciated, the genuine 
care which the unit commander was taking Of him. Knowing that there was some - 
one in the squadron to rely on, the unit commander was in no hurry. He wanted. 
D 'yakov to act with dead certainty after he got into the instructor's seat in the air-
craft, to act as a real mentor and skillful teacher of his subordinates. 
Affairs in the outfit were taking their normal course. P. P. D'yakov was firmly 
getting into the routine of his multiple duties. A commander's exactingnes s, the 
experience of a political worker, the ability to approach people, to direct their ener-
gy toward, solving the most important tasks ? all this gave him real authority. But 
the main thing was that he was persistently mastering the flight program. 
D 'yakov stubbornly went on perfecting himself in group flying teamwork, in carry-
ing on air combat, in firing at air and. ground. targets, in flying at night and. under ad-
verse weather conditions. Soon he was allowed, to fly as an instructor by day under 
minimum weather conditions for that airfield and. later on also by night.

A Difficult Examination 51 
A large group of pilots arriving from military school reported. to the unit. The 
command., deciding to whom it might entrust their training and education as well as ? 
their integration into the unit, chose the outfit commanded by Capt. D'yakov. In this 
choice by far not the least of the considerations were the personal qualities of the 
officer and. the fact that this squadron was firmly established as one of the topnotch 
outfits. The ranks of its best men were constantly being augmented by new Outstand-
ing Men in combat and. political training. 
Despite the fact that some of the best-trained, pilots. had. been called to other units, 
the remaining officers were fully prepared. for coping with the new task. Capt. Mi-
tyashin, the commander's deputy, rendered true assistance to his squadron ,command-
er . In the two flights commanded by officers S. Z. Bukchin and. N. V. Kuznetsov all. 
the pilots, technicians and. mechanics were Outstanding Men. 
Among the best officers of the outfit who by rights should be mentioned are N. P.. 
Limonov, N. L. Ustavich, A. S. Shurygin, G. I. Kurotopov, G. I. Plotnikov, V. A. Smol'-
yakov, A. A. Shavrin and. many others on whom the commander could. fully rely. Most 
of the junior Air Force specialists have be-
come Outstanding Men in combat and. political 
training, as, for example, senior aircraft 
mechanics N. A. Aref lyev and. L. A. R eznik, 
and private first class A. I. Mamadaliyev and. 
M. M. Landa. 
Owing to the selfless efforts of the fly-
ing personnel, the flight training plans are 
always carried, out successfully. Intensive 
training in the air goes off without any flying 
accidents. The technical personnel ensures 
reliable and. unfailing operation of equipment. 
Military discipline is at a high level. Offi-
cers, sergeants, and privates work as a team 
at raising the level of political knowledge. 
The experienced hand of the commander is 
felt everywhere; he acts as a skillful organ-
izer and, thoughtful tutor of his subordinates. 
The confidence of the command, which 
entrusted to thernthe integration into the unit 
of young pilots, is a wo/rthy evaluation of the 
work of the squadron personnel and its corn-
Capt. P P. D 'yakov before flight. mander. ,But at the same time it placed a 
special responsibility upon the entire team. 
Ha:Ving consulted. his d.eputy and. flight commanders and having evaluated the actual 
possibilities, D'yakov decided to carry out the task as soon as possible. Even dur-
ing the first months of the young men's presence in the squadron much was done .in 
this line. 
Ground. training went off exceptionally well. The young officers learned all that 
was included, in the program: the flying area, instructions concerning carrying out 
the flights and. navigational duties. They concluded their technical training. At the 
appointed, time all passed their examinations and.'soon they .started. flying., It is

enough to say that the young pilots logged. 6 - 7 times more hours in a few months, 
than in the course of the entire previous .year. 
A typical feature of Capt. D' yakov' s work is his faith in youth. But his faith is 
combined with the strictest exactingness and. unremitting control. 
From the very first days of service the young officers felt that in the outfit 
everything was subjected. to a definitely fixed. order and. no deviation from it would 
go unnoticed.. Once flying was scheduled. for a Monday. In the squadron one rule 
is punctually observed: on the eve of flying the flight personnel must always get a 
? 
normal rest. The commander strictly enforces this rule. So it was this time also. 
At 1100 hours the commander dropped in on the young pilots in the barracks. Two 
of them ? Lieutenants K.I.Shust' and. B. I. Sirota ? were still absent. And although 
afterwards they asserted. that they were only a few minutes late, Capt. D'yakov d.id. 
not alter his decision: both pilots were not permitted. to fly. Thus, from the very 
first moments of their stay in the squadron young officers get used. to following a 
fixed. order in everything. 
Another case was also the source of serious conclusions drawn by all the young 
pilots. Lt.N.I.Ippolitovmastered the flying program quite quickly. Despite the 
fact that the young pilots in the squad.ron are assigned. approximately the same a-
mount of flying time, he was one of the first to take up the concluding flying exercises 
in individual training. 
This slight advantage over the rest of his comrades turned. Ippolitov's head. a little. 
The legitimate wish to go on being in the forefront almost brought directly opposite 
results. The lieutenant took off to the zone to carry out an ordinary flight maneuver 
at an altitude of 9000 m. He tried to carry out the mission as well as possible and 
got carried away. 
The flight control officer warned, him over the radio tha.t,the time being up, it was 
time to return to the airfield.. The pilot replied, that he had. understood. the command,. 
But looking around he .suddenly could. not determine which way to go. 
If he had admitted this immediately and reported it to the command post, all would, 
have been corrected very easily. Yet pride prevailed, together with a false feeling 
of shame before his comrades for his oversight. Ippolitov decided ,to conceal that 
he was not 'sure where the airfield was located and. did. not know what course to take. 
For this reason the situation immediately became complicated.. 
When,five minutes later, the flight controller inquired, about the position of the 
plane, Ippolitov replied that he was approaching the second turn. Actually he was 
flying' on a course away from the airfield. He had lost his bearings. 
The unit commander, who was in the air at this time, helped. the pilot to alter his 
course, to fly towards his airfield and. to land. But there was hardly any fuel left 
in the tanks of Ippolitov' a plane. Flying had. to be stopped immediately and. this case 
had. to be analyzed. with the flying personnel. A punishment was inflicted. on the cul-
prit. 
As an exacting and. tactful commander, Capt.Diyakov was convinced. that Ippolitov 
himself as well as all the officers, realized, to what end. insincerity and. lack of truth-
fulness may lead, and that from this they had. learned a lesson. Nevertheless, he 
ordered that once more a thorough Check be made of how well Lt. Ippolitov knew the 
Navigation Regulations, the flying area and the instructions on regaining one's bear-
ings. After this he personnally flew with the pilot on a check-out flight for practical

A Difficult Examination 53 
regaining of bearings. The pilot handled. the mission well and. the commander again 
allowed him to undertake independent flights, thus showing him that he trusted the 
pilot and. thought that he would not make a similar mistake again. 
This is how the weekdays of intense creative work pass in officer D'yakov's out-
fit. And. after many difficulties had. been overcome, after merited. recognition and. 
true authority had come and. after he virtually rose to the level of military pilot 
first class in his personal training, Capt.D'yakov no less than before, and perhaps 
more, wished. to have the formal right to bear this honorable title. That is why he 
was so nervous on that flying night with-which this narrative started.. 
However, the test which seemed. so difficult to the pilot, went off without any com-
plications. D'yakov's training did. not arouse any doubts and. the piloting technique 
inspector who checked. his flying skill was quite satisfied. with the flight. He' did. not 
make any remarks and gave the evaluation: "excellent". 
Only just a few days passed. and. the next night flight became a most serious ,test 
of Capt. D'yakov's maturity and. skill. 
This time flights were assigned. according to the group commander's plan. As 
is usual under such conditions, he personally led the preflight briefing exercises. 
The peculiarity of this briefing was that in the course of it the officers' preparedness 
to carry out the forthcoming mission was not checked. in all its details, but it also 
served, as a model assignment, as an example, which had. to be followed, by each of 
the commanders participating in the flights. That is why the entire assignment was 
discussed. in such detail. The headquarters had. prepared all the diagrams and. vis-
ual aids rtprpQaary for the use of the officers. 
The group commander suggested. that Capt. D'yakov tell about the object of the 
flight mission. Next they started. discussing the actions of the pilots in special 
cases of flight. It might even seem that the commander was asking too much ab.out 
how one ought to act, should. the engine stop in the air or should. a fire break out, or 
how to substitute the readings of some instruments for those of others. After all, 
these were experienced, pilots who had, gathered for the flying and not novices. 
But it might seem so only to a detached onlooker. He who knows flying and he 
who has to do with aviation equipment must be ready at any moment and In. any situa-
tion to rapidly find. the correct solution in the most unexpected. and. complex circum-
stances. That is why the pilots discussed. each problem so thoroughly, again and. 
again repeating the rules in the flying regulations and instructions. 
Night came. Flying started.. At first D 'yakov took off on a combat trainer with 
a check pilot. Then came the. solo flight. The plane was in the air. The power-
ful engine worked rhythmically, lifting the machine rapidly. Suddenly a violent 
shock shook the plane and. broke the usual climbing tempo. A glance at the instru-
ment ? altitude 4000 m. The cabin quickly filled, with smoke. 
"What has happened.?" flashed. through his mind., but even before the thoughtwith 
movements trained, to the point of automatism,the pilot was already trying to open 
the cockpit canopy. At the moment that was the main thing. D'yakov reported on 
whrt had happened. by radio and. took measures'. 
The fuel valve has already been shut off ancl the engine stopped.. Again a glance 
at the instruments and. the plane was pulled up to level flight. Mere seconds had 
passed. and. 2000 m of altitud.e were already lost. The pilot made a decision: 
"I will land on the airfield.:"

The flight controller replied by radio that all the measures had been taken to en-
sure landing. All the pilots present at the flight line realized, perfectly well what 
it means to land. a fighter plane' with a stalled. engine at night. Orders had been given, 
everything was ready. 
D'yakov's plane approached. the airfield, but it was coming in on a course opposite 
the flight line, Which meant that the floodlights were useless. It was also clear 
that a repeat approach in order to correct the landing computation was also impossi-
ble. There was still one more means to facilitate landing at D'yakov's disposal ? 
the landing light. At an altitude of 100-150 m he switched, it on, let down the flaps 
and. landed. 
People approached the plane, ,but the pilot had already extricated himself from the 
safetybelt , got out of the cabin, walked. around. the plane and., convinced. that the 
machine was intact, went to meet them. 
He passed the difficult examination with flying colors. 
The chief of staff was reading an order from the Air Force Commander in Chief 
concerning him who, to the glory of his unit, whose battle standard was decorated. 
with orders for the exploits of its members during the Great Patriotic War, had. 
added one more courageous feat worthy of this glory in the days of peacetime train-
ing. This deed. was made possible because Capt. D'yakov, a Soviet pilot. and. com-
mander, combines the moral and combat qualities of a citizen of the USSR with unim-
peachable flying skill. 
The brief, laconic sentences of the military order told of all this: 
"Compliments and. a valuable gift are awarded. to Capt. D'yakov, P.P. , for self-
lessness and a high d.egree of flying skill d.emOnstrated in a complex situation, and. 
for .saving a combat plane." 
The day which had. begun so solemnly in the regiment closed, with a festive party 
in the club, where the unit commander read. the Decree of the Presidium. of the Su-
preme Council of the USSR on the award. of orders and. medals and. handed. the .decora-
tions to the soldiers of the regiment. Capt.D'yakov was awarded. the Order of the 
Red. Banner for irreprioachable service of many years standing. 
Finally one more pleasant surprise was reserved, by the commander for his sub-
ordinates. At the festive meeting he read. a telegram and. congratulated Capt. D'ya.-
kov, two of his flight commanders, A.V.Kokhanov, M. I. Poluektov, and. other of-
ficers on their promotion to a first class -rating. 
Now in Capt. D'yakovi s squadron, which is truly knitted. and. firmly welded. together, 
the entire flying personnel bears the honorable rating of military pilot first class, 
except for those who recently joined. it after flying school. A fighting squadron! 
Great tasks confront it. The personnel, headed. by their commander, fights with 
renewed strength for their successful solution.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE 
CLIMBING IN INTERCEPTION 
Docent, Candidate of Technical Sciences, 
Engineer Lt. Col. A. M. Tarasenkov 
\ ? ? 9:: 
???? 
In flying interception, altitud.e must be gained, in such a manner as to remove the 
line of interception as far as possible from the object d.efend.ed.. For this purpose, 
a combat or augmented operation Of the engine is utilized.. In order to cut the time, 
it is recommended that altitude be gained, at a speed. along a trajectory that corres-
ponds to the greatest possible rate of climb. This speed is determined as follows. 
The vertical component of the flight speed. Vy should. be plotted on a graph as the 
function of the. speed. along the trajectory V at a prescribed altitude. 
For each altitud.e it is possible to establish an appropriate speed along the trajec-
tory corresponding to maximum rate of climb; it increases with altitude. However, 
for convenience in remembering the parameters of the flight it is accepted. practice 
to give a constant true speed. along the trajectory. Let us assume that it is 750 km/ 
hr. Because of the sloping course of V along V, climbing at a constant speed, along 
the trajectory does not lead. to any significant reduction of the rate of climb as coin-
pared. to the maximum. 
In the interception of high-altitud.e targets it is not always advantageous to gain 
altitud.e at the highest rate of climb, i. e. , in a minimum of time. In a number of 
cases, to move the line of interception away from the objective, for example, in a 
plane of the MIG type, altitud.e is gained, at a speed, considerably greater than 750 km/ 
hr. What causes this and. how is the climbing speed. required in interception to-be 
determined.?

The flight trajectory in interception generally includes a sloping and a horizontal 
portion (Fig. 1). After the altitude has been reached at the highest rate of climb, it 
may be necessary to fly horizontally for a longer or shorter period, to meet the tar-
get. If several planes take off. simultaneously for interception, that one will be 
closest to the target that gained altitude at the highest speed and had the shortest ? 
horizontal portion of. the trajectory. This is due to the fact that an increase in speed 
along the trajectory increases the climbing time relatively little, but the aircraft 
nevertheless travels a considerably longer path. 
Figure 1 shows the relative. positions of 
H two planes that climbed to an altitude of 10,000 
m with rpm n = 11,560 the first at a speed of 
.49 700 km/hr, the second at 1000 km/hr. By the 
time the second plane has gained altitude, the 
first has succeeded in traveling some distance 
along the horizontal; nevertheless the second 
plane was 30 km ahead of the first. The greater 
the speed along the trajectory, the greater the 
gain in the path traveled. 
nfl With changes in climbing speed, the line of 
i0 50 
interception will also change. The method of 
gaining altitude will have the greatest effect on 
the position of the line in interception by pursuit. 
In this case, a gain in the path AL km will lead to a shift in the line of interception 
by a value: 
Fig. 1. Climb trajectory.

Art 
where Va and Vt are the speed of the aircraft and the target, respectively. 
When the ratio Va = 1, 1, a lag behind the target of, for example, 10 km will 
vt 
require an additional pursuit of 100 km. 
Figure 2 shows the gain in the line of interception LLiine of a target flying at an

Fig. 3. Zones of the position of the target relative 
to the fighter's takeoff point. 
Relative to the fighter's point of takeoff there are three zones of target position--
A,. B, and C, as shown in Figure 3. If the target at the moment of the fighter's take-
off is in zone A, i. e., left of point 1, then altitude must be gained at high speed to 
meet the target. Point 1 shows the position of the target when, in climbing in mini-
mum time, the fighter which is flying to meet it reaches the required altitude at 
point 2 at the beginning of his turn. For every position of the target at the time of 
fighter takeoff left of point 1, the speed along the climb trajectory can be selected 
so that the fighter will reach the given altitude at the point for beginning his turn. The 
farther the target is from point 1, the greater must be the speed. of the fighter, and 
the farther from the objective will be the interception. 
If, at the moment of the fighter's takeoff, the target is in zone B between points 
1 and 3 ? then altitude must be gained at the highest possible rate of climb along a 
curvilinear trajectory (in plane view). At the beginning of the climb, the flight is 
mad.e to meet the target. At the end. of the climb the pilot must guide the aircraft 
to the attack line, I. e., turn it at an angle of /80?.

right of point 4 then altitude must be gained at a speed. increasing proportionately 
with the distance to the target. Let U.S determine the speed. of climb, as su.ming that 
in flying to the target the fighter has a minimum horizontal section of the trajectory. 
We will thereby also find, the flight regime that will put the line of interception as 
far as possible from the objective. Let us assume that from the time it is spotted. 
the target moves in a. straight line and. uniformly. In the process of the ground, con-
troller's preliminary calculations on the plotting board, it is necessary to determine 
the course and speed for interception. 
Let us take a case where the target is flying toward. the takeoff airfield.. We 
determine the fighter's course independently of its speed. We will then find a speed 
such that the fighter has a minimum horizontal section of the trajectory, and. at the 
same time, such that the given altitud,e is reached. at the point of beginning his turn 
or at firing distance. To avoid, slipping past the target underneath, it can be re-
commended that the target's flight altitude be assumed in the calculations as 0. 3-0. 5 
km higher than it is. 
Let us suppose that the target is spotted in good. time and. it is required. that the 
line of its interception be kept at a distance. Then. the speed. for interception can 
be found by superimposing two graphs drawn on tracing paper (Fig. 4) on the plotting 
board. in a definite way. Figures 4a and 4b show the paths followed, in gaining dif-
ferent altitudes, beginning with 5 km, at different speed,s with combat (Fig. 4a) and 
augmented (Fig. 4b) operation of the engine. Each ray drawn from point T corres-
ponds to a specific flight altitude. The dotted lines depict the segments of the track 
traveled at any given speed. along the trajectory. The solid, curves correspond. to 
uniform time intervals from the moment of takeoff. Figure 4c shows the path trav-
eled by the target as a function of the speed. and. time of flight. Each rectilinear 
ray correspond.s to a definite flight speed. The curves plotted, on the graph are 
shown by equal time markings. 
It is desirable to construct the graphs on tracing paper to the scale of the map. 
Then graph I (Fig. 4a or 4b) is placed on the plotting board so that point T coincides 
with the ITN [ initial vectoring point] (the takeoff airfield.). The ray, marked. by 
the altitude equal to the altitude at which the target is flying, is pointed, along the 
course of the target. Graph II (Fig. 4c) is superimposed on the plotting board. in 
such a way that the ray marking the speed equal to the speed, of the target is pointed 
along the target's course. The designation of the target cn the map should. coincide 
with the time mark on the graph corresponding to the sum of the turning time and 
the passive time: tt + tpass, as shown in Figure 5. 
It is now easy to find, the computed point of beginning the turn and the speed. re-
quired to attain altitude. For this, we find, on the target flight line the point at 
which the lines of equal time intervals on both graphs converge. In our case, the 
lines of the 7-minute intervals converged. This will be the projection of the point 
of beginning the turn on the target path line. By interpolation between the dotted, 
lines we determine the flight speed. corresponding to the point found.. In the exam-
ple given in Figure 5 it is 910 km/hr. It may happen that the lines of equal time 
intervals do not converge at all; then two lines with the closest time intervals 
should be found, and the desired. point should. be taken in the center of the distance 
between them. 
If the target is spotted far from the airfield. or has a low flying speed, then even

the lines of the greatest time intervals may not converge (the graphs will"diverge"). 
This will mean that it is necessary to gain.,4titude at the highest speed, 1000 km/hr 
for example, and then fly horizontally to meet the target. If the target is spotted 
late, it may be found that even the lines with the smallest time intervals will not con-
verge (graphs I and. II "overlap" each other). This means that the target is in. zone 
B (Fig. 3) and altitude must be gained, at the highest rate of climb with simultaneous 
turn. 
However, sharp turns are not advantageous in this case, since they increase 
greatly the drag of the aircraft, thus slowing the climb. The turn should be made 
as gently as possible; then the required altitud.e will be attained, more quickly. Sharp 
turns are, however, disadvantageous. We shall prove this by an example. Suppose 
the aircraft is climbing to an altitude of AH. 2000 m by two methods: (a) a climb to 
= 1000 m, a sharp turn of 1800, and a further climb to All= 2000 in; (b) a climb 
to A H 2000 m with a simultaneous sloping turn of 180?. The time of the maneuver 
will be 40 seconds less in the second case 
than in the first. 
If, the target is spotted late and inter-
ception is possible only by pursuit --- which 
is entirely possible under combat condi-
tions -- the procedure for using the graphs 
is just the same. But graph I must be

viates considerably from the takeoff airfield, then the problem is more complicated 
and it is necessary to determine the required course of the fighter in. gaining altitude 
as well as its speed. The speed and the course of the fighter will then be interre-
lated. and can be determined only jointly. We shall show the method of solving this 
more general and more complex problem. 
It is expedient that the fighter's course and. speed. be selected so that the horizon-
tal section of the trajectory is at a minimum. It may be required, for example, 
that the fighter reach the given altitude at the point of beginrirg his turn, 1. e., eli-
minate any straight horizontal section. We determine the speed and. course for 
interception by the following method,. 
We lay out on the map the presumed flight heading of the target. From point B' 
where the target is spotted, we lay off a segment B'B equal to the path of the target 
(Fig. 6). B'B = Vt(tpass+tt), Relative to point B we draw the trajectory of the turn 
required to get to the target with a given angle-off and draw a tangent to it from the 
initial point of vectoring T (the takeoff airfield). Line TK will show the relative 
trajectory of the fighter's closing in on the target from the moment of takeoff to the 
point of beginning the turn K. With sufficient accuracy for practical purposes, line 
TB can be drawn instead of TK and considered as the relative trajectory of closure. 
Thus, we arbitrarily make the point of the beginning of the turn coincide with the 
position of the target. 
We find the true course for interception and. 
the required speed of the fighter by solving the 
interception triangle. From point T parallel 
to the line of the target path we lay off on a cer-
tain scale the vector of target speed. Vt. From 
the end of this vector we draw a line parallel to 
TB, i, e., one showing the direction of the re-
lative speed. of closure. 
We take a series of fighter speeds Val, Va2s 
and Va3 and lay them off from point T on the 
scale adopted in such a way that the end.s touch

turn.

can be obtained. directly from the graphs in. Figures 4a or 4b. The portions TE1,

shows the position of the fighter in climbing to the target altitude at different speeds 
and on different courses. The point E where this line intersects the line of target 
flight shows the actual course for interception heading TE. . At the point where 
TE intersects the line of heading relative to the speed of closure we find, the end. of 
the vector of the speed. required. in the climb. 
This method can be simplified considerably by using the simple device shown in 
Figure 7: In form' it is a hinged parallelogram ABCD, whose apex A can be fixed 
at a given position on the vectoring plotting board. Side AD is extended.; links AB 
and DC serve as guides for moving the rod. mm, which always holds a position paral-
lel to line AD. A scale of target speeds should. be marked. off on side DC. or AB so 
that rod. mm moves 'away from side AD for a distance corresponding to the target 
speed in the scale we have arbitrarily adopted. Fixed at the apex A is a hinged. 
scale nn marked. off in. fighter speed.s according to the scale adopted. Such a device 
makes. it possible to determine the relationship between the fighter speed and. the 
true course for interception, i. e., to. solve the interception triangle. 
This device can be used as follows. The parallelogram is laid. on the vectoring 
plot so that apex A coincides with point T (ITN). Side AD is pointed along line TB' 
(or TK if a turn trajectory has been constructed.); sid.e AB is pointed along the target 
flight speed; and rod mm is set by means of the scale in a position corresponding to 
the taiget speed. Then we assign to scale nn a number of positions, each of which 
is related to a certain fighter speed. We read. the speed on the scale of fighter 
speeds at the intersection of rods. mm and. nn. Having the target's flight altitude, 
we find, the distance TE and mark it off in the appropriate direction. Thus we ob-
tain a number of points El, Ez, E3..., and. at the intersection of the line connecting 
them with the line of target flight we find the required point E. Segment TE shows 
the true course for interception, while scale nn set on this course makes it possible 
to find the ,speed. of the fighter in gaining altitude. It is convenient to make all parts 
of the parallelogram out of some transparent material ? celluloid, for example. 
The temperature of the ambient air affects the rate of climb of jet aircraft. If, 
for example, the temperature is increased by 10? over the standard surface tem-
perature of 15? C, the maximum vertical speed will be reduced. by approximately 
10%. A, proportionate reduction in temperature increases the rate of climb. 
A substantial deviation from the standard temperature must be taken into account 
in the recommended preliminary ground-controller's calculations for interception. 
If it deviates uniformly from the standard at all altitudes, then in interception at 
altitudes around. 10, 000.m the following correction must be made in. the calculations 
in the target flight altitude as determined by radar. For every 10?rise in tempera-
ture over the standard., the 'calculated target flight altitud.e must be increased, by 
1000 m, otherwise the fighter will not have attained the required. altitude when he 
closes in on the target. For every 10? drop in the temperature of the ambient air 
below the standard, the calculated target flight altitude must be reduced. by 1000 m. 
Otherwise, the fighter will have to fly horizontally along the do sur e trajectory' for 
quite some time, and this is disadvantageous. 
The above operations in determining the speed and course of the fighter in inter-
ception must b.e performed in the time interval between the moment the d.ata on. the 
target (position, altitude, course, apeed)are received and. the time the fighter take.s 
off, i. e., in the passive time. To do this in such a short time is quite difficult. 
Climb in in Inter ce tion 63 
Therefore, computations for the most probable speeds and altitudes of target flight 
should. be prepared. in advance and. prepared. graphs such as the one shown in Figure 
8 should. be used. directly in the vectoring. 
The spotting line.is shown by an arc of a given. radius. The graph should. be lo-
cated. on the vectoring plot so that the pointer indicating the direction of target flight 
coincides with its actual course. Then for several points on the spotting line marked. 
off by the method.s outlined, above (see Figs. 5 and. 6) we find point E ? the arrival 
at the target flight altitude and the beginning of the turn? and. also the climbing' speed. 
The direction of TE will show the true course for interception, while the vector Va 
will show the speed of the fighter to scal 
as follows. It is placed on the vector-
ing plot in such a way that point T coin-
cides with the ITN and. the pointer for 
the target flight heading coincides with 
the target course. The position of the 
target is located, on the spotting line and 
a line is drawn for its anticipated course 
to the. intersection with the line of arriv-
al at the target flight altitude. ,Here the 
point E for the beginning of the turn. is 
found.. The direction TE will show the 
course the fighter must take for inter-
ception, and. the required. speed in gain-
ing altitud.e is determined, on. the polar 
diagram of speeds. 
In constructing Figure 8, the follow-
ing were used. as initial data: target flight 
altitude ? 8 km; true target speed. ? 
600 kmihr; range at which target is de-
tected by ground. radar ? 170 km; sum of the passive and turning time 4 minutes. 
As can be seen from the drawing, a change in the target direction of from 0 to 45? 
changes the required. fighter course by 90?, and. the speed. required to attain the alti-
tude will change correspondingly from 800 to 1000 km/hr. It is quite understand-
able that for attacking a slow-moving target at a high climbing speed. the fighter will 
have to be braked. energetically on the turn and. while closing in. 
Thus, it becomes evident how important is the proper selection of the fighter 
flight regime in climbing for moving the line of interception. away from the objective-. 
Use of the methods discussed. makes it possible to find. the required. climb regime by 
means of preliminary ground. controller calculations on the vectoring plot. The neces-
sary command. for the course and. speed. of the fighter should be transmitted to the 
pilot before takeoff or immediately thereafter. Further vectoring must be effected 
with the aid of the IKO [PPI]. 
We have not attempted. in this article to give instructions in interception but have 
merely tried to show how, important it is to choose correctly the climbing regime in 
interception. These recommendations can be used for solving the problem of inter-
cepting aerial targets.
