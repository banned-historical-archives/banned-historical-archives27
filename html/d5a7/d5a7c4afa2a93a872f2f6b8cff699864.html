 The Challenge China Faces:
 Identifying Resource Constraints
 on Economic Growth
 Scope Note         This paper identifies potential constraints to China's economic develop-
 ment and offers a sense of the sweeping challenge Beijing faces. As an in-
 ventory of problems lurking in China's future, the paper's tone is necessar-
 ily negative. It speculates on how those constraints may slow China's
 advancement. It does not attempt to measure their precise impact or even
 predict China's ability to overcome them. More detailed assessments of the
 constraints, their impact, and China's chances of resolving them will be the
 subject of future research.

 next 15 years and to challenge Beijing's ability to achieve qualitative
 targets. Though typical of the problems with resources, people, and
 technology absorption that face any developing economy, these challenges
 may be particularly daunting to China because of its size and its ambitious
 timetable.
 Beijing's plans through the end of the century and beyond will impose
 competing demands on China's infrastructure, industry, financial re-
 sources, social services, management, and education:
 ? The transportation system is already overburdened, and, even with
 improvements, it will probably fall far short of needs for domestic
 distribution of goods. Problems moving freight will inhibit domestic
 commerce and foreign trade.
 ? Railroad shortcomings will hinder deliveries of coal-which accounts for
 more than 70 percent of China's energy-and will hurt China's attempts
 to increase energy output. Energy shortages idle 30 percent of industry
 now, and by the end of the century demand could be twice available
 supplies.
 ? China lacks the communications systems necessary to support computer
 networks, industrial interfaces, and education; progress in improving
 civilian communications will be slow.
 ? Water supplies are already inadequate for industrial and human needs;
 water and air pollution go untreated and will worsen, threatening both
 human health and those industries that require clean supplies for their
 processes.
 ? China lacks the business environment-such as laws and legal services,
 product research, and marketing-as well as the streamlined decision-
 making and management criteria that would encourage the entrepre-
 neurship and risk taking that help developing economies make rapid
 strides.

 ? Until the education system can supplement narrow, applications-oriented
 training with broader programs for planning and managing, improve-
 ment in the business environment will be slow and will probably divert
 technically qualified Chinese from industries where their skills are
 needed.
 ? The role of the factory and the party-longstanding institutions in
 Chinese industry-will have to change to support quality, efficiency, and
 profits.
 ? China will face critical challenges in the absorption of technology and
 labor. Workers must be trained to use modern technologies effectively,
 and the unemployed and underemployed must be directed to new jobs to
 avoid a potentially serious social problem.
 ? Financial needs will be enormous-exceeding $1 trillion-and China will
 look to the West to provide low-cost loans, increase direct investment,
 import more Chinese goods, and use more Chinese services.
 In our judgment, although Beijing has acknowledged each of these issues,
 the leadership has taken little action to forestall the cumulative effects of
 these shortcomings, and may be forced to pare plans for qualitative
 improvements in industry and society. Disruptions from these problems will
 drive national economic policy making. Impatient localities will probably
 try to improve their economies and services on their own, and this may un-
 dermine national plans for integrated energy, transportation, communica-
 tions, and industrial systems. Interregional tensions stemming from un-
 equal rates of development could become more contentious as the gaps
 between rich and poor grow. We believe, however, that Beijing will remain
 committed to its reform program and that it will turn outward for solutions
 to its problems.
 Indeed, China's reforms and development will offer many opportunities for
 Western industries, academics, lenders, and governments to offer equip-
 ment, expertise, money, and advice. US firms have been more willing than
 others to transfer know-how as well as equipment and, therefore, may be
 competitive in the China market; however, other nations offer better
 financing and could thereby undercut US sales.

 China also will strengthen as an exporter, competing primarily with
 industrializing nations and with declining industries in the United States
 and other developed countries. Chinese competition probably will prompt
 calls for greater protection of US industries, guaranteed access for US
 firms in the China market, and assistance to compete against China in
 third-country markets. At the same time, China will continue to demand
 greater market access in the United States and balanced bilateral trade,
 suggesting that trade friction will be a key characteristic of US-Chinese re-
 lations through the rest of the century.

 Resources: Limited Supply,
 Immeasurable Demand
 temic shortcomings become more limiting.
 China has undertaken ambitious economic reforms,
 the scope of which is unprecedented in Chinese
 history (see inset). We have been surprised by the
 degree of success Beijing has achieved in the face of
 both political and economic obstacles. In our judg-
 ment, much of China's rapid growth in recent years
 has come as a result of both increased efficiency and
 fortuitous circumstances. Although the Chinese have
 been versatile and resourceful in coping with the
 obstacles to economic development, we believe that
 sustaining growth will become more difficult as sys-
 economic growth.
 We believe China's ambition to quadruple 1980 out-
 put by the end of the century is well within reach. But
 we are less certain about Beijing's ability to advance
 toward other, more qualititative goals. Leaving aside
 political problems and social costs, we believe there
 are significant resource constraints on China's future
 China has limited capacity at best.
 China's plans for the next 15 to 20 years place
 competing demands on virtually every facet of the
 economy. The total requirement for industrial raw
 materials, services, skills, and financing will prove
 awesome. China will need such construction materials
 and supplies as cement, lumber, fabricated metal and
 pipe, glass, plumbing, and elevators-already in short
 supply-for new industrial and residential buildings.
 Factories producing high-technology goods or prod-
 ucts with strict quality control specifications will
 require specialized instruments, automated equip-
 ment, and environmental monitoring and cleansing
 equipment to keep production facilities free of con-
 tamination. New or upgraded industries will call for
 reliable supplies of nonferrous metals, steel alloys,
 composite materials, and other substances for which
 The Scope of Reform Objectives
 The reform program engineered by Deng Xiaoping
 and his proteges embraces broad targets guided by
 Zhou Enlai's 1975 proposal to modernize industry,
 agriculture, science and technology, and defense.
 According to press and commercial sources, lower
 level Chinese planners, policymakers, and academics
 identify more discrete tasks such as:
 ? Improve the standard of living:
 - Offer better and broader educational
 opportunity.
 - Build more and better housing.
 - Market more and greater varieties of food and
 other consumer goods.
 ? Increase the quantity and quality of industrial
 output:
 - Improve productivity and quality control.
 - Manage factories more effectively.
 - Develop industrial specialization.
 - Upgrade industrial technology.
 - Match Western production capabilities in se-
 lected goods.
 ? Earn more foreign exchange:
 - Expand exports.
 - Offer more international services.
 The Chinese, moreover, face costs-pollution, labor
 displacement, lifestyle changes, regional polarity, and
 social frictions-for which their own assessments
 suggest they may not be fully prepared. Further
 beyond Beijing's control, the strength of the world
 economy will influence China's trade, the willingness
 of foreigners to invest in China, and the availability of

 international financing. Problems-with inputs, peo-
 ple, and absorption-typify those facing any develop-
 ing economy, but China in particular may find them
 daunting because of its sheer size and its ambitious
 timetable. Economic planners and policy makers will
 be especially concerned if regional disparities in
 growth undermine their attempts to develop national-
 ly integrated networks of industries and services and
 heighten tensions between have and have-not sections
 of the country.
 The Need To Upgrade an
 Inadequate Infrastructure
 Chinese planners and policymakers readily acknowl-
 edge that China's development plans are hostage to its
 infrastructural weaknesses.
 Massive Transport Needs. Inadequate transport facil-
 ities-especially in the highway sector-will be a key
 restraint to growth over the remainder of the century,
 restricting China's international trade as well as its
 domestic distribution of goods. China needs to expand
 its highway sector for short-haul freight, thereby
 freeing the overburdened rail system for long-
 distance requirements. Moreover, attempts to develop
 industrial specialization and new suburban or rural
 population centers-requiring timely delivery of parts
 and supplies-will heighten demand for dependable
 intercity trucking. But that will siphon petroleum
 products from exports and highway construction ma-
 congestion. For some products, air freight may be an
 alternative, but China would have to upgrade its air
 cargo capacity
 Energy Shortfalls. The transport situation also will
 hamper China's attempts to meet energy demand; rail
 freight capacity is inadequate to move coal-which
 accounts for 40 percent of rail freight-from the
 mines to power plants, leaving 54 million tons (more
 than 5 percent of output) stockpiled at mines last year.
 According to press reports, transportation authorities
 plan to spend about $21 billion on railroad moderniza-
 tion efforts over the next five years, mainly to increase
 coal-carrying capacity.
 Press)              also report that as much as 30
 percent of China's industrial capacity is idled by
 shortages of electricity,2 and Chinese experts estimate
 that, by the end of the century, demand could be
 twice available supplies. Chinese planners'call for
 more coal-fired power plants at mines to reduce coal
 transportation requirements, new hydroelectric sta-
 tions in the southwest with long-distance transmission
 lines to deliver electricity, and substantial increases in
 energy efficiency effected through replacement of
 antiquated power-generating and power-consuming
 equipment.
 We do not expect China to meet its energy goals.
 Coal, which now fuels 70 percent of China's electric-
 ity production, is slated only to double in output, while
 electric power is to quadruple. And to build the new
 plants and equipment needed will require staggering
 25X1
 terials from other important projects.
 Beijing's plans for highway construc-
 tion call for the provinces to assume responsibility,
 and the central government to fund only 20 percent or
 less; we believe this is a serious flaw. In the past,
 provinces have preferred to devote their resources to
 the development of industries that expand their tax
 base rather than to expensive but nonremunerative
 services.
 Inadequate inland distribution systems also will cause
 freight. storage problems and continued port conges-
 tion, especially if Chinese traders try to quadruple
 trade, as Beijing Plans. And although China is under-
 taking an extensive expansion of port facilities, con-
 tinuing silt problems-which restrict port access to
 medium size oceangoing vessels-will exacerbate

 Telephones as Luxury Goods
 China's telephone system is woefully inadequate.
 Switching and lines are generally archaic and, as
 travelers can attest, service is mediocre to poor, but
 the most telling and visible indicator of problems is
 the simple lack of telephones. Shanghai, for example,
 receives 5,000 requests monthly for telephones, but
 installs only about 17,000 per year. Nationwide,
 China installed 1.3 million telephones in 1981-85, or
 260,000 units yearly, bringing the total inventory to
 5 million. By 2000, the leadership's plan calls for 28
 million new installations-a total of 33 million
 phones-or nearly 2 million yearly, representing a
 tremendous amount of equipment, money, and skilled

 Water: The Forgotten Utility. We believe water sup-
 plies will be another major problem for China's
 industrial modernization. Water availability is al-
 ready a concern; the water table in many urban areas
 has become dangerously low, even causing subsidence
 in some locations-Tianjin has dropped more than six
 feet since 1959, according to Chinese press reports.
 One Chinese expert estimates that water consumption
 needs in 2000 will exceed 725 billion cubic meters,
 with a supply of only 650 billion. Without massive
 conservation efforts and investment in water treat-
 ment plants, China will have inadequate water to
 meet industry and public needs. Yet Beijing is only
 beginning to recognize the magnitude of the problem
 Inadequate Communications. China will need more
 and improved communications services to meet ad-
 ministrative, commercial, and social needs: data com-
 munications for computer networks used in state
 planning, transportation, energy, and other sectors;
 telephone and telex services to link factories, suppli-
 ers, and markets; and broadcast facilities to expand
 educational services. China's inadequate telecom-
 munications services are based on largely outmoded
 or obsolete equipment. The increase in demand far
 outstrips growth in services, and that situation is
 unlikely to change for a long time; China is still trying
 to meet basic telephone service demand, for example
 (see inset). China's efforts to develop a fiber-optic

 network will probably improve some intercity commu-
 nications, but we anticipate that problems in produc-
 tion and installation will prevent completion of a
 nationwide system within the next 10 years.
 Problems With Business Services
 To facilitate the development of a modern economy,
 China needs to develop business services that facili-
 tate day-to-day operations and provide a standardized
 system on which businessmen can rely. Beijing knows
 that such services are not widely available in China
 and that their absence slows the economy and weak-
 ens business confidence. Consequently, to enforce
 accountability and to assure investors of a sound
 business environment, China is evolving a legal frame-
 work covering contracts, investment safety, and other
 issues. Current laws are often vague, but Beijing is
 issuing clarifying regulations and new, more explicit
 laws as it becomes aware of needs.

 Secret
 China also must further develop its insurance, com-
 puter software,' engineering, product research, mar-
 keting, and other industries over the next 15 years.
 Because these services are not capital intensive, we do
 not expect them to be a major financial burden, but
 their shortcomings could curb risk taking, new prod-
 uct development, and industrial modernization, and
 thereby interfere with growth. In addition, they will
 create conflicting demand for China's technical and
 business graduates whose skills will also be needed in
 the industrial sector.
 Finances: Needs Versus Realities
 A key concern for Beijing will be financing its
 modernization and growth, but, we believe that, un-
 less international financial markets tighten, China
 should be able to find funds if it is willing to acce t
 lenders' terms.
 China's cumulative
 investment needs for the 10-year period from 1985 to
 1995 will exceed $1 trillion, outpacing savings by
 some $160 billion. In the past, China has been
 reluctant to turn abroad for funds because it wants to
 avoid dependence on foreign sources for commercial
 loans at nonconcessionary interest rates. However, we
 anticipate that its needs will force a rise in China's
 borrowing levels through the remainder of the centu-
 ma in 1986-90 will nee $50 billion from
 oreign sources to maintain planned 7-percent annual
 growth. Western bankers view China as a low-risk
 borrower and appear willing to provide considerable
 funding
 Trade: Export Promotion for Revenues. China also
 hopes to finance modernization through exports, not
 only of goods, but also of services. Indeed, without
 these sources of foreign exchange, China will be
 unable to fund the technology and equipment imports
 it needs to upgrade industry. We anticipate that
 China will encounter considerable resistance as it tries
 to expand its role in international export and service
 markets over the next 15 years. Increasing protection-
 ism in the West and a sluggish oil market are limiting
 export growth. The quality of many Chinese-manu-
 factured goods-the most likely growth sector for
 trade-is inadequate to ensure strong sales in devel-
 oped nations, and less developed countries do not have
 the financial resources to buy enough from China to
 raise export revenues significantly. China will proba-
 bly earn more foreign exchange through its develop-
 ment of international services, which, according to the
 State Statistical Bureau, earned $890 million in 1985.
 Beijing is pressing its merchant fleet, labor exports,
 overseas construction contracting, and other sectors to
 raise revenues. However, China's success with service
 exports will depend largely on the state of the world
 economy; for example, demand for overseas Chinese
 labor and construction is largely in the Middle East
 and has declined in reaction to falling oil prices.F_
 People Problems: Too Many Folks
 With Too Few Skills
 A key factor affecting the demands that will be made
 on China's resources is population growth and dispers-
 al. Beijing is pressing rural communities to establish
 industrial facilities that would absorb excess labor
 from agriculture.' Planners hope that, as a result, new
 towns will develop and prevent unmanageable migra-
 tion to already overcrowded cities. As these towns
 evolve into small cities, new demands will arise for
 energy, transportation, and services, in addition to the
 resource demands imposed by the development of
 additional industry. Moreover, although their share of
 the total population will drop, the number of very
 young and very old Chinese will rise by 2000, accord-
 ing to studies by the US Bureau of the Census, and
 the need for social services-schools, housing, medical
 care, food, transportation-to support the nonworking
 population will grow.

 tries that in 1985 accounted for two-thirds of the gross output of the

 Secret
 Decisionmaking: Everybody Wants
 To Get Into the Act
 China's economy seems at times to function in spite of
 the bureaucracy that runs it, suggesting that a failure
 to streamline decisionmaking may inhibit but not
 undermine growth. Nonetheless, although markets
 regulate more goods each year, the central and local
 governments still manage huge sectors of the economy
 and monitor others, and the overlap in responsibilities
 is debilitating. For example, squabbles between the
 Ministry of Nuclear Industry and the Ministry of
 Water Resources and Electric Power over the devel-
 opment of China's civilian nuclear energy program
 have confused Western vendors and delayed progress
 on planned construction, perhaps by several years. But
 Clearly, one resource China does not lack is people.
 As a resource, however, the critical aspect is the
 severe shortage of talent willing and able to drive
 Beijing's modernization programs. But sociopolitical
 factors have inhibited the development of skilled
 decisionmakers, entrepreneurs, managers, and techni-
 cians, and the institutional framework that brings
 their abilities together into a smoothly functioning
 system. The legacies of the Cultural Revolution' and
 the Soviet-style planning bureaucracy China adopted
 in the 1950s-with its overlapping responsibilities and
 its need for consensus before action-have slowed
 implementation of Beijing's plans. For example, the
 Three Gorges hydropower project-proposed in the
 early 1950s to alleviate electricity shortages-is still
 under debate among national, provincial, and local
 authorities in spite of the urgent need for power.
 the leadership has also not been pleased with the
 effect of market forces without central guidance; in
 1984 Beijing decentralized trade and encouraged
 exports, but the resultant competition among new
 trading firms drove Chinese export prices down, forc-
 ing the government to restore some controls.
 6 The Cultural Revolution (1966-76) featured violent repudiation of
 education and technical competence. Bureaucrats, factory manag-
 ers, academics, and technicians alike were persecuted. At least a
 full decade of training and development was lost. Moreover, some
 individuals affected by the torment of that period have been
 reluctant to embrace the new leadership's reform program for fear
 Beijing has begun appointing so-called Leading
 Groups to bring together the involved bureaucracies
 and develop cohesive policies. We are skeptical that
 Leading Groups will solve the problem, however. To
 date, a variety of Leading Groups have emerged to
 oversee such issues as energy demand and supply and
 science and technology policy. But the memberships
 often feature the same leaders, suggesting that some
 key figures are involved in too many bodies to be
 effective. Moreover, the proliferation of Leading
 Groups suggests that they may be better at highlight-
 ing problems than at implementing solutions and may,
 in fact, be little more than an added layer of bureau-
 cracy. Indeed, some groups do not include all of the
 actors necessary to be effective. For example, the
 group for electronics development does not include
 representatives from Shanghai, the site of important
 electronics industries and a major competitor with the
 rest of the country for electronics resources and
 imported technology.
 Another mechanism introduced to improve industrial
 management and decisionmaking is horizontal inte-
 gration-the breakup of fully self-reliant factories
 into independent producers of parts, subassemblies,
 and finished goods to increase specialization, efficien-
 cy, and quality control. Chinese academics writing
 over the past two years have criticized vertical deci-
 sionmaking as a top-down command system that
 functions without regard to needs, resources, or abili-
 ties. On the other hand, supporters of horizontal
 integration say it permits factories to assess demand
 and determine output; encourages industry and re-
 searchers to work together to develop new products;
 and limits government resource management to issues
 too large or commodities too scarce for independent
 market methods to satisfy national needs. In our
 judgment, however, the introduction of horizontal
 management is premature; the transportation and
 communications systems are not prepared to support
 the added burden; and most Chinese factory manag-
 ers lack the skill to analyze markets and make
 production decisions on the basis of their analysis. For
 example, a recent Embassy report of a Chinese

 Secret
 industrial survey suggests that some manufacturers of
 finished goods have pared output in response to lower
 demand, but that parts suppliers have not, resulting in
 costly and wasteful inventory buildups.
 The Education Gap
 A more critical shortcoming of China's program is
 education. Beijing only recently mandated nine years
 of education for all Chinese. But press articles and
 other public sources suggest that reform programs,
 especially in rural areas, may have resulted in a
 shorter average education because families prefer to
 have their children in the fields or shops helping to
 earn a living.
 According to a study by the World Bank, China's
 advanced education programs tend to focus on narrow
 applications, with few institutions offering liberal arts
 programs. On the face of it, that should be helpful in
 filling China's need for specialists and technicians.
 But China also needs people who are more broadly
 educated, who can think abstractly, who have fore-
 sight and can plan projects and see them to fruition,
 and who can become the industrial and political
 leaders of tomorrow. Western observers see a genera-
 tion of leaders in their seventies and eighties now
 passing the torch to men and women in their fifties.
 The follow-on generation of 30-to-40-year-olds were
 scarred by the Cultural Revolution, however, and,
 though we are unsure of the long-run impact, the
 disruption in their educations certainly undercut their
 opportunities to develop qualifications for positions
 that could put them in contention for future leader-
 ship roles.
 Management Shortfalls
 If-as Beijing expects-initiative, innovation, and
 profit motivation are to be important sources of
 economic growth and development, then China has a
 formidable chore ahead retraining managers for its
 400,000-plus enterprises and bureaucracies. China's
 needs are wide ranging, from a consistent accounting
 system to new attitudes. For example, many Western
 observers expect China-because of its centralized
 economy-to have a well-developed statistical system
 for reporting production and imposing quotas. But
 management instructors at the Dalian Training
 School, a US-backed joint program to train Chinese
 factory managers in Western techniques, have found
 their Chinese students unable to conceptualize bal-
 ance sheets, production costs, depreciation, and other
 standard accounting methods. Beijing apparently has
 accepted the need to adopt at least some Western
 accounting practices; a recent press article announced
 that China would attempt to train 10,000 certified
 accountants by the end of the century. The article
 failed to note, however, that China lacks procedures
 as well as personnel.
 To professionalize its industrial leadership, China has
 imposed new requirements for factory managers, in-
 cluding courses and examinations. But a key element
 in successful industrial reforms will be much more
 difficult to achieve. In our judgment, Beijing must
 determine-and probably redefine-the role of the
 factory, and that will require some major changes of
 attitudes:
 ? Plant managers once considered successful for
 meeting quantitative goals must adjust to new crite-
 ria demanding quality, innovation, marketing skills,
 and profits.
 ? Although reforms have nominally reduced the role
 of the party, the central authority at many enter-
 prises is still the party secretary, and key decisions
 are still based on party line rather than on the
 factory's business environment.
 ? Enterprises will have to consider trimming their

 Achieving Progress and Coping With Its Fallout
 Implementing reforms has been and will continue to
 be awkward for Beijing because the results-some-
 times unanticipated-pose philosophical as well as
 practical dilemmas. The introduction of such reforms
 as free markets for some goods, for example, evoked
 Western claims that China was adopting capitalism,

 The Sociopolitical Role of the Factory:
 Another Constraint?
 of its other social roles as well.
 Factories in China have considerable responsibilities
 beyond simple production of goods. They provide
 employees with a full range of social services such as
 housing, medical care, and child care. Because fac-
 tories generally do not fire unneeded employees, they
 provide a de facto social security system as well.
 According to Embassy reporting, Beijing will begin
 this summer to introduce a social safety net including
 retirement and unemployment benefits that will re-
 lieve factories of some of the burden. However, to
 improve efficiency over the next several years, fac-
 tories also may press the government to assume more
 diminution of that role would cause friction.
 Redefining the functions of factories may change
 their political role as well, which may cause tension
 between factory management and party officials. The
 party has long been involved in factory management
 and used meetings of the work force to foster and
 enforce party policies. Beijing has called for a lower
 party profile at the factory level, however, to permit
 economic forces to drive decisionmaking. But because
 party officials may view their role at the enterprise
 level as their main source of power, we expect that
 claims that Beijing found embarrassing. The leader-
 ship is sometimes hardpressed to justify its policies
 within the framework of its political heritage. "Social-
 ism with Chinese characteristics" has been only
 murkily defined, leaving vague the role of traditional
 Communist or socialist institutions such as the party,
 the planning process, and state-set prices. The practi-
 cal issues-technology absorption, unemployment,
 and social and resource pollution-however, could
 undo much of the progress China has made.
 disproportionately large share of Chinese are
 term concerns.
 At the core of many of these reported inadequacies
 are a lack of training for labor and management and
 weaknesses in the industrial structure-both long-
 trained not by vocational schools but by their fac-
 tories, where they are given very narrow instruction
 on particular tasks, with no attempt to promote
 understanding of their jobs in the context of the whole
 product or the factory's production to instill pride and
 motivation. Without these, we doubt that Chinese
 workers will have the ability to understand new
 technologies, and, thus, absorptive capacity will con-
 tinue to be weak.
 Absorbing Technology: Now That We've
 Got it, What Do We Do?
 Statements by Chinese officials
 make clear that
 China has deep-rooted problems using advanced
 equipment and technology in civilian applications.
 Stories of poorly maintained, incorrectly operated, or
 Beijing is aware-as indicated by
 official press articles calling for improvement-that
 technology absorption is one of the most critical
 challenges China faces. Until workers can use modern
 technologies effectively, we believe-on the basis of
 the experiences of other developing nations-that
 China's economic modernization plans will be ham-
 pered.
 Absorbing Excess Labor: Now That We
 Don't Need It, What Do We Do?
 And if China successfully introduces advanced tech-
 nologies and more efficient machinery, what happens
 to displaced unskilled and semiskilled laborers? The
 Chinese acknowledge that unemployment is an issue
 in large urban areas such as Shanghai, where rising
 crime is frequently attributed to street gangs of
 jobless youths. According to the US Census Bureau,
 at least 10 million jobs must be created annually
 through 2000. Moreover, the Census Bureau has
 identified a striking discrepancy between Beijing's
 planning for urban population growth and for urban
 employment, with jobseekers far outnumbering job
 creation.

 According to China's State Statistical Bureau, at
 yearend 1984 China had 3.5 million persons "await-
 ing employment." More than 63 million worked in
 industry, of whom nearly one-third were in the ma-
 chine-building sector, where underemployment is re-
 ported to be high.
 unemployment and underemployment in
 machine building is growing rapidly because factories
 are having trouble developing new markets.
 1.5 million defense workers have
 been put on half pay because their factories cannot
 adjust to new demands to produce civilian goods.
 Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect
 that unemployment and underemployment will be a
 major concern for Beijing over the next 15 years and
 that this could be a disruptive social issue.
 The Price of Industrialization: Pollution
 Takes Many Forms
 China's campaign against spiritual pollution' reflect-
 ed the leadership's somewhat schizophrenic attitudes
 toward the balance of Western and socialist influ-
 ences, and greater involvement in the international
 economy will heighten the tension. Environmental
 pollution will be of greater importance to industry,
 however. Already short of water, China persists in
 managing its water supplies cavalierly, dumping un-
 processed human and industrial wastes indiscrimi-
 nately. Beijing is becoming more aware of the prob-
 lem; a recent China Daily article, for example, urged
 purification of industrial waste water and domestic
 sewage for reuse and protection of water resources
 from pollution. But we have no evidence that Beijing
 has established a policy on water use and pollution or
 has tried to protect industrial and drinking water. We
 believe China's water resources will become an alarm-
 ing social and economic issue by the end of the
 century-and probably earlier-and that Beijing will
 have to begin construction of water treatment plants
 on a massive scale.
 ' Building on remarks made by Deng Xiaoping in September 1983,
 conservative party propagandists initiated the anti-spiritual-pollu-
 tion campaign, ostensibly to attack corrosive aspects of Western
 "bourgeois" culture. As it gained momentum in late 1983, conser-
 vatives used the campaign to criticize elements of Deng's reform
 program. Alarmed at this development, Deng cut off the campaign
 in early 1984, silencing conservative critics and at least temporarily
 forbidding the use of the term "spiritual pollution" in the official
 media. The episode demonstrates the continuing volatility of the
 Air pollution will similarly test Beijing's ability to
 marshal resources to treat a major national problem.
 In spite of China's best efforts to diversify energy
 sources, coal will continue to be the primary fuel for
 industry. Conversion of urban households to gas, if
 accomplished, would stanch a major source of air                25X1
 pollution, but power plants and industry would contin-          25X1
 ue to belch smoke. Diplomats                who          25X1
 have lived in Chinese cities, especially Beijing, specu-        25X1
 late that winter air 10 years from now will be all but          25X1
 unbreathable, indeed nearly solid with particulates, if
 action is not taken now. Chinese officials, though they
 acknowledge the problem, have done little. Some
 factories are experimenting with solutions.                   25X1
 certain factories      25X1
 have installed water and exhaust filtration systems.
 Because Beijing's industrial policies often evolve from
 the actions of advanced factories, we believe Beijing
 may within the next few years laud these enterprises
 and press others to emulate them.
 At present, our best guess is that Beijing will muddle
 through the next 15 years using a crisis management
 approach to ameliorate-but not eliminate-major
 bottlenecks as they threaten to hobble the economy.
 We believe, however, that Beijing will remain com-
 mitted to reform and will turn increasingly outward
 for solutions, seeking technological, managerial, and
 financial assistance from the West.
 Clearly, China's development plans leave no sector
 untouched, offering many commercial opportunities
 for US and other Western firms, as well as openings
 for cooperation on a government-to-government basis.
 In fact, we believe that China must become further
 integrated into the world economy for its moderniza-
 tion program to work, and that imports of technology
 and materials as well as massive foreign credit will be
 necessary.
 US firms could be of critical importance to China if
 they can gain and take advantage of market access. In
 particular, US firms have high potential for commer-
 cial links in energy-including coal, oil, hydropower,

 more low-cost financing than will be available. Those

 seemingly limitless, we expect to see increasing use of
 unconventional financing methods and compensation
 trade to enter and remain in China's markets.
 At the same time, as the Chinese economy strength-

 competitive primarily with today's industrializing na-

 and posing a threat to firms in declining US indus-
 tries, such as furniture, metal products, and consumer
 electronics. The result will be new demands by US
 industry for protection from less expensive imports.
 Moreover, China hopes to increase substantially ex-
 ports of agricultural and other products that would
 compete directly with US goods in third-country
 markets. US policymakers can expect, then, contin-
 ued conflicting demands from exporting industries
 that want guaranteed access to the Chinese market,
 exporting industries that want assistance to compete
 against China in other markets, and domestic indus-
 tries that want to prevent Chinese access to the US
 market. In addition, China will continue to demand
 market access and a bilateral trade balance, suggest-
 ing that trade friction will be a key characteristic of
 US-Chinese relations at the turn of the century.
