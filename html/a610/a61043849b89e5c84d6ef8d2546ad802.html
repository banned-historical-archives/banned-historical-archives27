 The UN: 25th General Assembly To Open
 The silver anniversary UN General Assembly
 meeting opening on 15 September will be a major
 diplomatic event, highlighted by the presence of
 at least 80 heads of government at a special com-
 memorative session in mid-October. In addition
 to considering such perennial issues as the Middle
 East conflict, Chinese representation, and colo-
 nialism and racism, the delegates will probably
 concentrate on recent developments in arms con-
 trol areas and on various proposals intended to
 revitalize the UN's institutional machinery.
 Assembly debate on the Arab-Israeli im-
 broglio is likely to be acerbic, especially if the
 90-day cease-fire breaks down or ends before ne-
 gotiations under the auspices of Gunnar Jarring,
 Secretary General Thant's Middle East envoy, suc-
 ceed. A potential casualty of the debate is the UN
 Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which des-
 perately needs Assembly assistance in overcoming
 its estimated $9-million deficit for 1969-70 wel-
 fare services in the Middle East refugee camps.
 Preliminary estimates of the voting pattern
 on Chinese representation indicate that the tradi-
 tional Albanian resolution to seat Peking and ex-
 pel Taiwan will once again be considered an Im-
 portant Question requiring a two-thirds vote and
 subsequently will fail to obtain even a straight
 majority. The usual surfeit of African-sponsored
 proposals on Rhodesia, the Portuguese territories,
 and South Africa apparently will be offered, and
 sensitivities may be inflamed should the British
 UN: Soviets Oppose "Two Chinas "Plan
 The Soviets are pressing the Belgians not to
 advance their "two Chinas" draft resolution at
 the coming session of the General Assembly. The
 Belgian proposal would give Taiwan's seat on the
 Security Council to Peking while allowing the
 Nationalists to remain in the Assembly. The So-
 Government make a final decision to sell mari-
 time defense equipment to Pretoria.
 Recent changes in the US-USSR draft sea-
 beds treaty designed to bolster its verification
 provisions appear likely to win an Assembly en-
 dorsement of the document. Caught in the vortex
 of Assembly debate, however, may be the vexing
 problem of chemical and biological warfare. Last
 year the Assembly challenged, by an 82-3 vote,
 the US contention that the Geneva Protocol of
 1925 does not ban the use of tear gas and herbi-
 cides in war. Concurrent with this year's As-
 sembly session the US Senate will consider the
 White House request for endorsement of the Pro-
 tocol with the understanding that it does not ban
 such usage. International critics of the US posi-
 tion may attempt to prevent Senate endorsement
 by applying pressure through the Assembly. Both
 superpowers could also come under fire from the
 less advanced countries as a result of the inde-
 terminate nature of the first two rounds of SALT.
 Colombia has succeeded in having review of
 the UN Charter, a dormant subject for several
 years, placed on this year's agenda, but major
 power opposition probably will prevent any sub-
 stantive accomplishments on this issue. More
 likely to achieve some meaningful reforms is the
 Canadian initiative on methods to upgrade the
 efficiency of Assembly committees. The less ad-25X1
 vanced countries may press hard to gain greater
 powers and allocations for UN agencies dis ensin
 economic assistance.
 viets have told Brussels they would be "embar-
 rassed" by Peking's presence on the Security
 Council and have threatened to work against
 Belgium's candidacy for a Council seat should it
 persist with its proposal.

 Moscow's strong-arm  tactics  represent  a
 change from the soft sell it has been using for the
 last few years to make known its opposition to
 Peking's admission. Last year, for example, the
 Soviets voted for the Albanian resolution, which
 calls for Taiwan's ouster from the UN, but for the
 first time did not speak in favor of Peking's ad-
 mission.
 The Belgian initiative has not garnered wide-
 spread support and may not even be formally
 introduced. Moscow appears concerned over its
 possible appeal, however, and probably wants to

 Vietnam: Military Flare-up Subsides
 The flurry of Communist military activity
 which began in late August apparently now is
 slacking off. There are indications, however, that
 enemy units in South Vietnam's northern prov-
 inces and in scattered locations elsewhere in the
 country may be preparing to launch another
 round before the end of the month.
 Although the widespread shellings of out-
 posts and some district towns started to taper oft
 after the first 48 hours, they nevertheless con-
 tinued at a higher than normal level through the
 early part of this week. On several occasions be-
 tween 4 and 8 September, such shellings were
 followed by small but sharp guerrilla and sapper
 raids; these inflicted substantial government and
 civilian casualties at negligible or no known cost
 to enemy troops. Particularly hard hit were a
 district headquarters and nearby Ranger camp in
 the north, a civilian self-defense training center
 along the central coast, a Popular Forces training
 center in the highlands and some Territorial Se-
 curity Forces outposts in the lower delta.
 There is some evidence that the recent up-
 surge  signaled  the start of the Communists'
 "autumn-winter campaign" and is to be followed
 b  a second phase in a few weeks.
 The character and targets of the enemy's
 actions in the recent phase suggest that the Com-
 munists are still trying to find ways to reverse the
 government's progress in pacification over the
 past year without departing from their own pres-
 ent economy of force tactics. The em
 uerrilla and local force activit
 ~ prooaoiy
 foreshadows more of the same low-keyed, stag-
 gered types of actions in coming weeks, perhaps
 with increased political as well as military harass-
 ment of those elements that serve as the back-
 bone of the government's pacification effort.
 Increasing violence in the protest activities
 of disabled veterans has forced the government to
 abandon its restraint in dealing with them for a
 more severe crackdown. The Thieu government
 has been reluctant to take forceful measures
 against the veterans because of sympathy for their
 plight within the armed forces, but public sym-
 pathy has been somewhat blunted by the extor-
 tion and opportunism practiced by some of the
 veterans. The increasing lawlessness of the more
 militant agitators erupted in two armed clashes on
 3 September, in which several veterans and police
 were wounded, as well as three American MPs.      25X1

 The prime minister had ordered the police and
 Capital District military commanders to take any
 measures necessary to put down the disorders, a
 policy publicly reaffirmed on TV by the director
 general of National Police on 4 September. Simi-
 lar orders now have been given to province chiefs
 and mayors.
 As part of the government crackdown, po-
 lice and military units have torn down several
 hundred illegally built shacks in various parts of
 Saigon. The government, however, plans to try to
 meet legitimate housing needs of the veterans by
 the end of the year.
 The government's harsher tactics appear to
 have dampened the situation, at least for the
 moment. New disorders may emerge, however,
 from the demands of former members of paramil-
 itary units, some of whom have recently gathered
 in Saigon complaining of their exclusion from
 veterans' benefits now extended to the regular
 armed forces.
 To add to the government's problems, stu-
 dent unrest also continues to simmer. Most of the
 students arrested during a demonstration on 30
 August have since been released except for several
 leaders, including controversial Saigon Student
 Union chairman Huynh Tan Mam, who will be
 brought to trial. Mam was previously convicted of
 Communist activities by a military court last
 March, but released when the Supreme Court
 declared his trial unconstitutional; his rearrest
 could provide a source of new agitation.
 Meanwhile, a number of serious problems
 plaguing the South Vietnamese police were aired
 at a recent meeting in Saigon. The police have
 been heavily burdened by new responsibilities be-
 Page 3
 ing thrust on them while they are still critically
 short of personnel and hampered in attracting
 new recruits. The National Police originally had
 hoped to expand to 122,000 by the end of the
 year, but they will have difficulty reaching even
 105,000.
 In addition, the lack of coordination be-
 tween the police and other security forces has
 continued to undercut the pacification program.
 In the effort to combat the Viet Cong infrastruc-
 ture, the army generally has ignored the police,
 while the Special Police generally have ignored
 the government committees tasked with over-all
 coordination. Morale has suffered under low pay
 and rising living costs, which in turn have stimu-
 lated police corruption. The police have also
 chafed under the restrictions that were placed on
 their handling of demonstrations,  but their
 morale should get a boost from the new guide-
 lines that permit them to take any necessary
 measures.
 North Vietnam's chief delegate to the Paris
 talks, Xuan Thuy, was back at the table last week
 for the first time in eight months; his deputy, Ha
 Van Lau, and the top Viet Cong negotiator,
 Madame Binh, may soon follow. It was clear from
 Thuy's remarks in Paris, nonetheless, that the
 Communist position is as hard as ever.
 He told newsmen at a reception on 2 Sep-
 tember that the Communists were standing pat
 and awaiting allied initiatives to move the confer-
 ence along. When asked about private talks, for
 instance, Thuy said that the US must call for
 them and then he would "consider the matter."
 He turned aside a proposal made by a group of
 US Senators for a standstill cease-fire in Vietnam,
 saying that "fundamental issues" would have to
 be settled before -the Communists would accept a

 stand down. Thuy claimed that this was spelled
 out in the Viet Cong ten-point proposal, but in
 fact the ten points are ambiguous about the
 timing for a cease-fire. Thuy is not apt to make
 such formulations lightly, particularly since rank-
 ing Communist spokesmen rarely are so specitic
 about cease-fire prospects. He may have adopted
 a hard-line posture in public to underscore the
 toughness of Hanoi's terms.
 Thuy told a Western diplomat that Lau
 would return to Paris, but he did not say when.
 Lau left the talks last spring presumably as part of
 COMMUNIST CHINA: The bland communique
 issued at the close of the plenum of the party
 central committee last week failed to propose any
 new policy guidelines, strongly suggesting that
 behind-the-scenes disagreements still pose a se-
 rious obstacle to governmental reconstruction.
 The plenum, which met from 23 August to 6
 September, was addressed by both Mao Tse-tung
 and heir-designate Lin Piao, but neither their re-
 marks nor much of the plenum agenda were re-
 vealed. One major topic of consideration appar-
 ently was the convening of the Fourth National
 People's Congress. Although affirming the re-
 gime's desire to hold a congress, however, the
 communique was pointedly vague on a timetable
 even though pre-congress preparations have been
 Hanoi's effort to protest the US failure to replace
 Ambassador Lodge. He was quite active in diplo-
 matic contacts outside the conference room, but
 it is hard to read anything into his return at this
 point. Madame Binh, meanwhile, stopped off in
 Lusaka to lobby for full representation for the
 Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) at
 the Nonaligned Conference, but without notable
 success. Like Sihanouk's government-in-exile, the
 PRG was finessed into "observer" status. Her
 next stop probably will be Paris, although Com-
 munist spokesmen have not yet announced her
 under way at the local level for some months. In
 all likelihood, the plenum grappled with the var-
 ious controversial issues requiring approval by the
 rubber stamp congress, such as revising the state
 constitution, selecting a new chief of state, and
 formally restaffing the various central government
 ministries and bureaus. But the communique was
 notably silent on these points, and it left other
 questions unanswered such as current political
 standing of the 23 central committee members
 who failed to attend the plenum. For example, it
 remains unclear whether public security minister
 and politburo member Hsieh  Fu-chih--out of
 sight since 19 March--was present and whether his
 status was an issue at the session.

 The Thai Insurgency: A Mixed Bag
 Bangkok has struck hard at the insurgency in
 the north. In one of the most successful counter-
 insurgency operations ever waged by government
 forces, a 450-man Thai Army task force con-
 ducted a series of raids in late August against the
 principal insurgent stronghold area in northern
 Nan Province along the Thai-Lao border. The
 well-coordinated and executed operation, which
 involved night movem n   i ht  helicopter sunnort_
 took the insurgents
 completely by surprise. Fourteen enemy cadre
 were captured and several others killed without
 significant loss to government forces.
 The operation should help boost Thai mo-
 rale in an area where the insurgents had enjoyed
 consistent tactical success-which they had begun
 to exploit politically-and where the government
 has been at a loss to develop a coherent strategy.
 The insurgency in the north continues to spread,
 however. Small enemy units have recently been
 spotted farther from the Lao border than hereto-
 fore, and it will take a good deal more than one
 success to rectify the situation.
 I n the northeast, on the other hand, the
 insurgent movement is continuing to rebound
 from the setbacks it suffered during 1967-68. The
 Communists there have maintained a level of
 activity markedly higher this rainy season than
 last. Most of this increased activity has been or-
 ganizational rather than military, with the Com-
 munists seeking to strengthen their support base
 and extend their writ into new areas of the in-
 terior. In contrast to their focus this spring on
 Nakhon Phanom and Sakhon Nakhon provinces,
 insurgent activity now affects portions of at least
 eight northeastern provinces.
 Bangkok's growing preoccupation with de-
 velopments in Cambodia may be contributing to
 rising insurgent fortunes in the northeast. In an
 effort to counter the potential threat to its border
 posed by recent Communist advances in northern
 and western Cambodia, the government has reas-
 signed seven of the 15 Thai Army companies
 normally committed to counterinsurgency tasks
 in the northeast to security missions along the
 Cambodian frontier. This evidently has  contrib-
 uted to a winding down of government pressure
 against the insurgents in the northeast.
 The fundamental problem, however, is the
 top Thai leaders' continued discounting of the
 insurgent threat in the northeast. Based on the
 experience of 1967-68-when the overextended
 insurgents were forced to retrench in the face of
 government pressure-and the continuing weak-
 ness of insurgent leadership and appeal, the Thai
 are convinced that they can keep the insurgency
 in the northeast within manageable proportions.
 For their part, the insurgents can profitably use
 an extended period free from serious harassment,
 which is likely if they choose to avoid the kind of
 flamboyant actions that force the government to

 Cambodia: Phnom Penh Launches an Offensive
 The government's most ambitious military
 operation of the war attained initial success when
 a government amphibious relief convoy reached
 Kompong Thom this week. Advance elements of
 a second Cambodian Army task force headed
 north from Skoun on Route 6 in a parallel effort
 to reinforce and resupply the embattled defenders
 of Kompong Thom city. This task force is spear-
 headed by six infantry (battalions recently re-
 turned from retraining in South Vietnam. Five
 other  battalions are  moving  westward  from
 Kompong Cham to provide route security behind
 the advance elements. The government's advance
 has  been slowed by destroyed bridges along
 Route 6 and the numerous obstacles placed across
 it by the enemy. The Communists have so far
 offered only token resistance.
 he major area of Communist military ac-
 tivity shifted during the last week from east of
 Phnom Penh to areas south of the capital. Gov-
 ernment forces recaptured Srang, 25 miles south-
 west of Phnom Penh, when the enemy withdrew
 after holding the town for five days. The Cam-
 bodian  Army,  however,  continues  to  report
 sizable enemy troop concentrations nearby and in
 areas around the nearby towns of Tram Khnar
 and Saang to the east, both of which came under
 repeated enemy harassing attacks.
 Elsewhere, the Communists launched light:
 harassing attacks near several provincial capitals in
 the south and southeast. I n the northwest, the
 enemy increased its harassment of government
 defensive positions at isolated Siem Reap city.
 Cambodian troops clashed with Communist units
 north and west of the city., and in one encounter
 13 Cambodian soldiers were killed by Commu-
 nists wearing uniforms similar to those of Cam-
 bodian paratroop units.
 Status of Communist Supply Routes
 Recent aerial  hoto ra h
 provide no evidence of major
 ogistic activity in enemy-controlled provinces in
 northern and northeastern Cambodia. Several of
 the major routes are impassable for trucks be-
 cause of destroyed bridges and deteriorated roads,
 with few signs of repair activity in evidence.
 Route 19, the main road from northeastern Cam-
 bodia into South Vietnam, is in good condition
 but little traffic or other logistics activity was
 observed                                in  mid-
 no significant enemy activity
 was observed on the major rivers in the area
 during late August.
 Vacancy at Lusaka
 The Nonaligned Conference formally opened
 on 8 September, and as anticipated neither the
 Lon Nol nor the Sihanouk delegation was seated.
 more
 e egations supporte   i anou  than Lon      of at
 the preparatory foreign ministers' conference on

 favored seating neither, and believed that Cam-

 without  official  representation  in attendance.
 This ministerial compromise was apparently ac-

 Communist China: New Watchdog for the Military
 Peking's decision to fill the long-vacant post
 of chief political commissar for the armed forces
 marks the final step in normalizing China's mili-
 tary high command in the wake of the Cultural
 Revolution. At a reception in Peking last. week,
 alternate  politburo  member  Li Te-shenq was
 identified as the director of the General Political
 t)r;oartment, once the top watchdog of the army's
 rea,ity to the Chinese Communist Party. During
 lhr Cultural Revolution, the department had be-
 ?_orne a battleground for forces seeking to purge
 hi;h military officers, and it has not functioned
 n;rmally since .1967.
 l._; le-sheng's appointment reinforces other
 c: nt indications that the General Political De-
 , tment is beginning to resume at least some of
 it-, pre - Cultural Revolution duties, which in?
 l,!Ied overseeing the armed forces' party come
 ;'.lees as  well  as  political control  over al
 rulitary personnel. Representatives of the depart-
 appeared at important regional military
 .., derences last week.
 Li Te-sheng
 Watching the army
 there are fresh signs of
 di ;satisfaction in Peking
 with the performance of
 many of the military of-
 fix.ers who dominate the
 present administrative
 machinery  in  China's
 provinces. Such discon-
 tent is implicit  in the
 current campaign to re-
 study two past resolu-
 tions                                       authored  respec-
 tively by Mao Tse-tung
 and Lin Piao which dealt
 with army-civilian rela-
 tions, military indiscipline, and deficiencies in
 party work within the army. More openly, wide
 publicity has been given to recent speeches by
 local army men decrying indications in their ranks
 of irresponsibility toward the party's cause and
 weak political indoctrination.
 These strictures reinforce the notion that an
 intense debate over the military's role in day-to-
 day politics is far from resolved. The issues are
 complex, ranging from Peking's desire to ensure
 centralized control over its most viable governing
 instrument to concern over the fitness of some
 officers for holding party posts vithin the army
 and by extension, on nascent civilian party com-
 mittees. Such unusual public criticism suggests
 that the new director of the General Political
 Department  may  come  under  considerable
 pressure from forces within the top leadership
 who are at odds over the extent of the army's
 future  responsibilities in provincial adminis-
 tration.
 Relatively little is known o  Li Te-sheng's
 personal political inclinations but he may be a
 skilled opportunist who was deemed a suitable
 compromise candidate for his sensitive new post.
 Nevertheless, as both a military district com-
 mander and head of the government of Anhwei
 Province, Li's acceptability to China's powerful
 provincial military figures was probably an im-
 portant consideration in his appointment. His
 background as a tactical commander rather than a
 political officer and his record of opposing Cul-
 tural Revolution excesses in his bailiwick also
 suggest that his appointment does not signal an

 EUROPE
 Competition for Eastern Trade Within EC
 Concern over a possible commercial agree-
 ment between Bonn and Moscow in the wake of
 the recently signed nonaggression treaty may be
 spurring increasing competition among the Euro-
 pean Community countries for such  bilateral
 agreements. Belgian officials, for example, last
 week cited the possibility of a West German -
 USSR trade agreement, as well as recent Soviet
 bilateral agreements with France and Italy, as
 obliging the Benelux states to "protect their own
 interests." Belgium will head a Benelux nego-
 tiating team visit to Moscow in October.
 The EC Council decided last year that bi-
 lateral negotiations between Community mem-
 bers and East European states could be author-
 ized through 1972. The Belgians fear, however,
 that, although the original delays in establishing a
 common EC commercial policy resulted primarily
 from a French desire for bilateral deals with East-
 ern Europe, other countries will now develop
 vested interests in the existing situation, thus
 making a common policy even more difficult to
 work out.
 Most European officials and businessmen
 probably do not have exaggerated hopes for the
 immediate prospects of trade with Eastern Eu-
 rope. One Belgian official doubted that a Bene-
 lux-Soviet  treaty-which,  as envisaged, would
 specify most-favored-nation treatment and raise
 import quotas for some Soviet products-would
 make much difference to Belgian trade with the
 USSR. The competition among Western countries
 stems in part, however, from their interest in
 longer term prospects as consumer goods exports
 to Eastern Europe increase. In the absence of a
 comprehensive common commercial policy and as
 trade grows between the EC and Eastern Europe,
 Western competition increasingly takes the form
 of "outbidding" on credit terms for exports.
 Increasing headaches are also being caused
 by the exceptional status granted trade between
 the Federal Republic and East Germany. Since
 such trade is considered "inner-German," East
 German  products-or third-country goods im-
 ported through East Germany-can enter the en-
 tire Common Market duty-free through West Ger-
 many.
 Bonn seems well aware of the need to avoid
 engendering the fears of its EC partners that it
 seeks a special position in trade with the East.
 West German industrialists, for example, want to
 enlarge to at least Community scale the German
 part of a prospective truck-manufacturing agree-
 ment between Daimler-Benz and the USSR. It
 remains to be seen, however, whether Bonn will
 attempt to use Moscow's apparent desire for in-
 creased economic cooperation not only to further
 German Ostpolitik but also to encourage Soviet
 recognition of the EC as a whole as a valid inter-
 locutor on trade matters. Bonn's partners will be

 man intentions toward a bilateral trade pact with

 Soviet Improvement Plans for Comsat Network
 I he Soviets are engaged in a program to
 develop new satellites and ground stations that
 could substantially improve their communications
 satellite (comsat) network within the next year or
 two. For six years, their comsat program has been
 dependent upon "first generation" technology,
 which  lagged significantly behind that of the
 Western-based Intelsat consortium.
 Fourteen Molniya-1 satellites have been suc-
 cessfully orbited since April  1965. They have
 been used mainly to relay one TV channel from
 Moscow to all parts of the country, creating the
 world's only domestic satellite TV distribution
 system. The highly elliptical orbit of Molniya-1
 provides excellent coverage of the northern lat-
 itudes. It requires at least two satellites in orbit
 simultaneously to provide continual coverage of
 the Soviet Union, however, and has contributed
 to the short operational lifetime of the satellites,
 increasinq the costs of the Soviet program-
 1-he USSR plans to launch two new types of
 satellites-Molniya-2  and  Statsionar-that  will
 operate  with  an  expanded  potential   channel
 capacity and will allow the simultaneous relay of
 both TV and multichannel voice transmission.
 Moreover, the Statsionar will have a geostationary
 orbit, which parks it over the point of the globe.
 1 his should increase its lifetime and thereby re-
 duce long-run system costs.
 Two types of Soviet ground stations pres-
 ently operate with Molniya-1. The Orbita sta-
 tions, of which there are 29 with eight more
 under construction, are capable only of receiving
 one channel of TV. The Molniya stations, in Mos-
 cow and Vladivostok, can both transmit and re-
 ceive, and are used for relaying telephone and
 telegraph traffic as well as TV between the two
 cities. The Soviets apparently plan to modify 18
 of the present Orbita stations and build three new
 stations  for  operation  with  Molniya-2  and
 Statsionar. All Orbita stations probably will be
 modified to operate in the internationally recom-
 nended frequency range and selected Orbita sta-
 OnS, will be equipped for both transmission and
 reception  of multichannel telephone and tele-
 graph traffic.
 Through mid-1970. total monetary outlays
 for the Molniya-1 program are estimated to have
 been about $700-750  million. The plans for
 Molniya-2 and Statsionar, as well as continued
 expansion of the ground segment and  main-
 tenance of the system during the next two years,
 probably will  require $300-350 million more.
 Even so, the system has brought TV to remote
 crrts of the country at a fraction of the cost that
 would have been required by conventional cable
 and/or microwave radio relay lines.
 Intersputnik,
 the Soviet-sponsored interna-
 tional  comsat  organization,  has remained es-
 sentially a  "paper tiger" since its announced
 formation in 1967. Its membership has never in-
 creased beyond the original eight signatories-all
 Communist countries-and of late its existence is
 only infrequently mentioned. It is possible that
 soviet  authorities  are reluctant to undertake
 major initiatives in this direction until their new
 generation satellites have been successfully tried,
 or they may be holding Intersputnik as a bar-
 gaining  point  in                                                                       future  dealings  with  Intel-

 Hungary: Liberal Domestic Policy Outlines for the 70s
 The Hungarian party's outline for the party
 congress later this year calls for a "grand social
 program" aimed at widening popular support by
 granting cautious political reforms and extending
 the liberal economic policies of the 60s.
 The outline, published as the "guiding prin-
 ciples of the tenth party congress," ushers in a
 new political phase in Kadar's attempt to make
 socialism workable in Hungary. The program of-
 fers new opportunities for Hungarians to take
 part in local political life and tangible financial
 incentives to active supporters of the regime. At
 the same time, the document insists on the in-
 violability of party prerogatives in setting national
 goals and interfering directly in any "politically
 important matters."
 The incentives offered are multifaceted but
 probably too limited in scope to have any im-
 mediate effect on the quality of political life. A
 more liberal electoral system, greater independ-
 ence of local government, and final institutionali-
 zation, via constitutional reform, of the post-
 Stalinist  era  are the more important general
 changes. There are also specific concessions to the
 nation's youth--more appointments to leading po-
 sitions (including party membership at 18 years
 of age)-and to those intellectuals willing to be-
 come "active champions of socialism." While the
 document warns sternly against "reactionary, na-
 tionalist and idealist views," it clearly does not
 contradict Kadar's past disavowal of "administra-
 tive measures" as tools in cultural policy.
 The party leadership also intends to give the
 organization's image a face-lifting. Amendments
 to the party statutes attack its most visible fail-
 ures, such as local demogoguery, protected cor-
 ruption, and general abuse of power, and orders
 closer attention to public opinion, via a compre-
 hensive system of polling. Internally, the new
 statutes promise the rank and file more authority
 to criticize bureaucratic abuses.
 The new approach includes some potentially
 disruptive issues, not the least of which will be
 the intellectuals' reaction to the new "socialist
 champion" criteria. The party has already denied
 that Kadar's eight-year-old alliance policy, "he
 who  is not against us is with us," has been
 changed. There has also been a sensitive reaction
 to charges that Kadar is introducing "a Hungarian
 way to Communism," so it is likely that Stalinists
 at home, and possibly in more conservative Pact
 regimes, are unhappy with the concessions to
 "bourgeoise parliamentarianism."
 It is highly unlikely that Kadar will leave
 himself open to serious charges from any side. He
 is too realistic to risk the current stability in
 overly ambitious liberalization schemes or ad-
 venturous ideological purification programs hav-
 ing no chance of success. Behind the increased
 rhetoric idealizing socialist morals, he will almost
 certainly continue to use well-proven material in-
 centives as the core of his program for gradually
 uniting the party and the nation.
 In the economic sphere, Hungary's fourth
 five-year plan will be even more flexible than
 previous  plans.  Under  the  economic  reform
 (NEM), which was introduced in 1968, enter-
 prises are free for the most part from centrally
 imposed targets, and stated goals are labeled
 "indicators" as distinct from previous "direc-
 tives." One indication of the change in planning is
 the apparent provision for a larger than usual
 reserve of unallocated output. Consumption and
 investment are planned to grow at a slower rate
 than  output-giving  the  government  a  hedge
 against excessive increases in demand.
 The keynotes of the new plan are increased
 quality of output and greater efficiency, as else-
 where in Eastern Europe. Moreover, there will be
 added stress on increasing the standard of living.
 The projected 6-7 percent annual gain in indus-
 trial output is to come more from modernization

 than from large new projects. Labor productivity
 is expected to account for 75-80 percent of the
 increase in national income. The people will wel-
 come the fact that consumption is planned to
 grow at the same rate as national income (5.4-5.7
 percent); it had declined as a share of national
 income during most of the previous plan period.
 In addition, sharp increases are planned for invest-
 raments in housing and in public services.
 Continued prevention of inflation and un-
 employment                     is  needed for success  in  imple-
 menting the NEM, and the regime will therefore
 move slowly in freeing controls on prices and
 imports. Progress is expected, however, in improv-
 ing incentives by modifying the system of profit
 taxation and wage regulation, and in removing
 some subsidies to enterprises.
 In foreign trade, key problems will continue
 to be those of increasing exports to the West and
 stabilizing Hungary's hard currency balance of
 payments.  Hungary, already the leader within
 CEMA in promoting cooperation agreements and
 licensing with Western firms, intends to break
 new ground  by attempting to attract limited

 to putting finishing touches on a new treaty of
 friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance,
 replacing the one that expired in 1968. Bucha-
 rest's renewal of such treaties with its Warsaw
 Pact allies apparently awaited signature of the

 MIDDLE EAST-AFRICA
 Middle East: Fedayeen Hijackings Cap Week of Drama
 Five aircraft hijacking attempts, four of
 them successful, by the radical Popular Front for
 the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) headed by
 George Habbash  highlighted another week of
 feverish activity in the Middle East.
 Acting almost simultaneously on 6 Septem-
 ber, PFLP terrorists captured Pan Am, TWA, and
 Swissair flights over Europe. A fourth attempt
 that day was thwarted by the crew of an Israeli El
 Al plane; one of the hijackers was killed and his
 female associate, who had participated in the suc-
 cessful hijacking of a TWA plane to Damascus last
 September, was arrested by British authorities
 when the aircraft landed in London.
 All three planes hijacked on the 6th were
 originally diverted to Beirut. The Pan Am flight
 George Habbash
 PFLP Leader
 then went on to Cairo, where the passengers
 barely managed to get out before the terrorists
 blew up the plane. The TWA and Swiss planes
 were flown to Dawson's Landing, a remote air-
 strip north of Amman, Jordan. Some 120 of the
 passengers and crew-all non-Jewish women and
 children-were evacuated to a hotel in Amman.
 Some 180 others-males and Jewish women and
 children-were still being held captive at the air-
 strip as of noon 10 September.
 The fifth hijacking came on 9 September
 when a British BOAC airliner was grabbed after
 leaving Bahrain. It too was flown temporarily to
 Beirut and then went on to the so-called "Revolu-
 tion Airport" where the other two aircraft were
 held. Some passengers of this plane were still
 being held at Dawson's Landing al: latest report;
 22 "non-Westerners" were taken to Amman early
 on 10 September.
 As its price for freeing the captive aircraft
 and passengers, the PFLP has demanded the re-
 lease of commandos in prison in Switzerland,
 West Germany, and Israel, and the woman being
 held by British authorities. The fedayeen set an
 original deadline of 2200 EDT 9 September, but
 have since extended this for 72 hours while nego-
 tiations continue. The US is attempting to work
 through the International Committee of the Red
 Cross with Swiss, German, Israeli, and British
 officials to arrange for the release of the passen-
 gers and aircraft.
 Within the Palestinian terrorist movement,
 the PFLPs extreme actions appear to have again
 taken the ball away from Fatah, the more mod-
 erate group led by Yasir Arafat. Although the
 PFLP espouses the same objectives as Fatah-the
 eradication of Israel and the restoration of Pal-
 estine as an Arab state-it has generally taken a
 more violent course and has carried out interna-
 tional activities. Early in its existence, the group
 had ties to Egypt, but after the 1967 war it

 branded President Nasir a reactionary. Since then,
 Iraq has afforded both financial and logistical
 support, although the PFLP has not become
 Baghdad's puppet. The group can be expected to
 carry out additional violent acts in the future,
 including kidnapings, bombings and even assassi-
 nations.
 For Jordan's King Husayn, meanwhile, the
 hijackings have brought little but further trouble.
 Already knee-deep in problems created by the
 fedayeen, Husayn this week saw Amman all but
 come under the control of the Palestinian com-
 mandos. Several attempts to ease the situation
 through agreements between the security forces
 and the fedayeen leaders were quickly overtaken
 by the outbreak of new fighting. Early in the
 Libya: Oil Agreement; Soviet Arms
 Premier Qaddafi's speech in Benghazi on 4
 September raised the ante on Libya's relationship
 with the oil companies. He announced an agree-
 ment with Occidental to raise the posted price by
 30 cents per barrel to $2.53. In addition, the
 posted price will rise by two cents per barrel
 annually until it reaches $2.63. In return, Occi-
 dental  will  be  permitted  to  produce up to
 700,000 barrels per day, about twice the current
 rate and somewhat less than its peak production
 last April. Occidental's agreement will have a sig-
 nificant impact on the negotiations of the other
 companies, although they have not yet indicated
 just how much.
 Qaddafi's other remarks generally tollowed
 the line of his coup anniversary speech on 1
 September. He boasted about the nationalization
 of Italian property, and came down heavily on his
 week Husayn tried to work through the cabinet,
 but by Wednesday he had granted full authority
 to his military chief of staff to end the crisis.
 The possibility of bringing any real order to

 Israel-Egypt: The Cease-Fire Falters
 The Israeli cabinet announced on 6 Sep-
 tember its decision to suspend participation in the
 Jarring talks until after a rollback of the Egyptian
 missiles that the Israelis allege were moved into
 the standstill zone since the cease-fire began. The
 action effectively stalled the US effort to restore
 some movement to the process of achieving a
 political settlement in the Middle East. State-
 ments to the press by Prime Minister Meir, For-
 eign Minister Eban, and Defense Minister Dayan
 left open the possibility that Israel might seek to
 "rectify" the Egyptian violations by unilateral
 action, but the general impression was left that
 Israel would wait to see if diplomatic action could
 restore the bargaining advantages it held when the
 cease-fire began.
 The move appears to have been a compro-
 mise reached mainly to propitiate Defense Minis-
 ter Dayan. Dayan may well have been pressing for
 even stronger measures, such as a formal state-
 ment that Israel no longer considers itself bound
 by the cease-fire. In any event, the defense minis-
 ler has profited politically as a result of the deci-
 sion; both Dayan's supporters and the local press
 are portraying him to the public as the one man
 who stood firm  and  saved Israel from being
 forced into concessions dangerous to its security.
 Egypt, meanwhile, continues to deny the
 Israeli charges that it is expanding its missile
 system in the area near the canal. Cairo's UN
 representative in New York described the Israeli
 allegations as a feeble pretext for boycotting the
 peace contacts. Following an Egyptian cabinet
 meeting on 7 September, Cairo radio reported
 that the ministers heard "definite information
 showing that the Israeli claims are lies spread by
 Israel and supported by the United States." The
 Israeli accusations were premeditated, the radio
 continued, and were intended to pave the way for
 more arms for Israel and to serve "as advance
 justification for any action Israel may carry out."
 This view will probably be trumpeted as proven
 correct by news reports on Wednesday that the
 US has agreed to sell Israel additional Phantom
 fighter-bombers.
 moment.
 The Egyptians are not likely to agree to any
 rollback of surface-to-air missiles under any con-
 ditions, even if the peace initiative appears to be
 in danger of foundering completely. Although
 Cairo would like the US initiative to succeed in
 arranging for a political solution to the Middle
 East impasse, the Egyptians apparently consider a
 stronger defensive posture along the Suez Canal as
 a more immediate and overriding necessity at the

 India: Political Problems and Maharajahs
 Government action to abolish the annual
 payments made to former rulers of princely states
 and remove the rajahs' traditional privileges has
 become the latest point of contention between
 Prime  Minister  Gandhi and her  political  op-
 ponents. A constitutional amendment to elimi-
 nate the payments and privileges passed the lower
 house of the Indian pariiament last week, but
 failed by one vote to win the two thirds approval
 required in the upper house. Mrs. Gandhi, who
 has staked her prestige on the issue, immediately
 arranged for President Giri to withdraw official
 recognition from all 320 rajahs. The government
 asserts that this automatically ends any claims by
 the princes to their traditional allowances and
 privileges. For their part, the rajahs are preparing
 a court challenge to the legality of the President's
 action.
 Because the Indian constitution gives the
 President authority to recognize a prince, the
 government argues that he also has the right to
 withdraw that recognition. Constitutional power
 to withdraw recognition is a carryover from the
 British authority to  remove unsuitable native
 rulers; its use in individual instances has been
 upheld by Indian courts. Giri chose to "derecog-
 nize" each prince separately, but in effect he
 "dethroned" the entire lot and his right to do so
 remains open to question. Since Girl also acted in
 defiance of parliament, the government is taking
 special care to plug all the legal loopholes.
 With the approach  of national elections,
 which must be called by February 1972, Mrs.
 Gandhi has found it increasingly difficult to re-
 tain the support of other parties for her minority
 government. The issue of the princes' subsidies
 has an emotional appeal for the country's numer-
 ous poor, and Mrs. Gandhi had hoped to use it to
 draw into her camp all politicans not wishing to
 be tarred as "reactionaries." These tactics drew
 some outside support, and also provoked a certain
 amount of dissension within opposition parties,
 some of whose members were loath to take a
 stand against a popular issue simply to thwart the
 prime minister. Conversely, however, Mrs. Gandhi
 angered conservative supporters in her ruling Con-
 gress Party.
 It is important now that her party do well in
 local elections to vindicate her stand and to retain
 her political momentum. The first test will come
 on 17 September, when the southwestern state of
 Kerala goes to the polls. Local issues are likely to
 prove more important there than national ideo-.
 logical wrangles, but the election may still give
 some indication of her success in developing an
 issue with a vote-getting, all-India appeal.
 Parliament is in recess now for about two
 months, and Mrs. Gandhi has a breathing space in
 which to woo new supporters and placate dis-
 gruntled  old ones. India's politicians are very
 much aware that national elections may be called
 early, however, and are anxious to spot the vic-
 tory bandwagon.  In this atmosphere, even  a
 minor political setback, such as a local election
 defeat or an adverse court verdict, could have a
 damaging effect on Mrs. Gandhi's future.           25X1

 OAU: Seventh Annual Meeting Concludes in Addis Ababa
 The yearly meeting of the Organization of
 African Unity (OAU) ended ahead of schedule in
 Addis Ababa last week. In contrast to past divi-
 sive sessions, this year's gathering ran quickly and
 efficiently as the heads of state approved virtually
 without change the resolutions prepared for them
 at the pre-summit foreign ministers' meetings.
 A major event at this seventh annual session
 was the highly publicized reconciliation of Nigeria
 with the four African governments-Tanzania,
 Zambia, Gabon, and Ivory Coast-that supported
 Biafra during the civil war. Much of the pre-
 liminary diplomatic spadework for the reconcilia-
 tion was accomplished by the Kenyans, who also
 played an unusually active role at Addis Ababa.
 Nigeria intends to establish diplomatic rela-
 tions soon with Zambia, and probably also with
 Tanzania. Nigerian-Gabonese diplomatic ties will
 probably not be established until the two govern-
 ments can agree on arrangements for the repatria-
 tion of Biafran children evacuated to Gabon
 during the war. It will probably also be some time
 before formal ties are restored with Ivory Coast,
 where former secessionist leader Ojukwu is now
 living.
 On the issue of actual or intended arms sales
 to South Africa, a major item on the agenda, the
 heads of state specifically condemned the UK,
 France, and West Germany. This resolution-also
 the work of the Kenyans-was approved by the
 OAU leaders despite intense lobbying by Paris
 with  help  from  some  Francophone  African
 delegations.
 The OAU plans to follow up its condemna-
 tion by mounting a campaign to deter these coun-
 tries from dealing with South Africa. It author-

 ministers of Kenya, Mali, Algeria, and Cameroon
 as members. The OAU also hopes to assist the
 African liberation movements !in Angola and
 Mozambique by applying pressure on those coun-

 the US because of its NATO ties with Lisbon. The

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Salvador Allende Moves Toward the Chilean Presidency
 Marxist Salvador Allende is already assuming
 the role of Chilean president-elect, although he
 won a plurality of only 36.3 percent in the elec-
 tion on 4 September. His opponents, who view
 his coming to power as a disaster, are wallowing
 in indecision.
 Allende is moving quickly and assertively to
 consolidate his slim 1.4-percent lead over con-
 servative former president Jorge Alessandri and
 thus ensure his choice in the congressional runoff
 between the two on 24 October. In a major -press
 conference on 5 September Allende
 reiterated his
 intention to make far-reaching changes in Chilean
 economic, political, and social systems. Simul-
 taneously he emphasized the political variations
 of his key advisers within the Communist-led
 Popular Union coalition which nominated him.
 Allende also visited President Frei to demand
 immediate measures to control bank withdrawals
 and flight of capital. Frei concurred and also
 agreed to accept an economic liaison representa-
 tive from Allende; he refused a similar political
 arrangement.
 Political opposition to congressional valida-
 tion of Allende's claim to the presidency is not
 yet either cohesive or effective. Alessandri's back-
 ers were overcome by his unexpected defeat and
 seem panicked, particularly over economic pros-
 pects. Alessandri has not conceded. On 9 Septem-
 ber he announced that if he were elected by the
 Congress he would resign in order to bring about
 new elections, in which he would not run. Mean-
 while, his partisans must present proof of their
 claim of electoral fraud to the National Electoral
 Court by 14 September.
 President Frei's deep aversion to the implica-
 tions of an Allende government has long been
 apparent. Nonetheless, he has been reluctant to
 become the rallying point or even a participant in
 schemes to head it off. Efforts by moderate lead-
 ers of his Christian Democratic Party to block
 Allende's approval by Congress have begun, but
 will require discipline unusual in the PDC. Mean-
 while, defeated candidate Radomiro Tomic and a
 few leftist Christian Democrats virtually joined
 Allende, raising only minimal bargaining points
 for their cooperation. Some reportedly will join
 his cabinet with the almost certainly unfounded
 idea that they could prevent the disciplined Com-
 munist Party from dominating Allende's adminis-
 tration.

 Colombia: Government Reacts to Guerrilla Ambush
 The military's quick response to a guerrilla
 ambush that left seven soldiers dead and eight
 wounded may discourage further guerrilla attacks,
 at least for the time being. Communist forces
 remain capable of causing high local tensions,
 however.  The  insurgents have been generally

 was the most serious in more than a year. The

 The ELN, which consists of four groups, suffers

 disarray. ELN policy in the past has been to avoid
 action with large groups of soldiers while attack-
 ing small patrols or outposts. It is too early to tell
 whether the recent action represents a change in
 tactics. The ELN appears to be dedicated to im-

 Bolivia-Gulf Settlement Near
 In a press conference on 7 September Presi-
 dent Ovando explained the principal provisions of
 the settlement negotiated for Gulf Oil Company's
 property that was expropriated last October. He
 said that the remaining details would be worked
 out in the next 15 days. Gulf's chief negotiator
 told the US Embassy that he was pleased with the
 arrangements and confident that the government
 would follow through with the settlement.
 The negotiated settlement calls for Gulf to
 receive about $78.7 million in compensation for
 its lost property, plus an additional $14-15 mil-
 lion in repayment of debts owed the company.
 The compensation is acceptable to Gulf, although
 ;t is some $20 million less than the approximately
 $101 million calculated value of Gulf's invest-
 ment in Bolivia. Gulf will receive a percentage of
 proceeds from petroleum exports until the $78.7
 million is paid, but the method of repaying the
 debt has not yet been determined.
 President Ovando indicated in his press con-
 ference that the sticky problem of the Spanish
 state oil company's role in the settlement had also
 been settled. The Spanish company, under the
 SECRET
 name of CAMBA, was originally brought into the
 negotiations as an intermediary for the company
 and the government when dealing directly with
 Gulf seemed politically impossible for the Ovando
 government. CAMBA was to receive a 20-year
 contract to operate the expropriated fields and
 market Bolivian petroleum. When the settlement
 seemed near, however, the Bolivian Government
 sought to exclude CAMBA altogether. A com-
 promise apparently now has been reached
 wherein CAMBA will provide technical assistance
 for three years and marketing assistance for five
 years. It will receive $400,000 for the first three
 years and a reduced rate later.
 President Ovanclo and members of the nego-
 tiating commission appear prepared to face up to
 the political difficulty and public criticism the
 settlement is expected to arouse. Extensive public
 objection to the settlement, however, could cause
 further delays in the final agreement. Gulf already
 has consented to a decrease of $800,000 in the
 total compensation so that the government could
 avoid paying for a concession that was sure to
 raise public question because of legal doubts
 about  the  validity  of  the  title.

 Guyana: Danger of Setback in 1970 Sugar Crop
 Prime Minister Burnham faces political ob-
 stacles in efforts to avoid a serious shortfall in the
 important sugar harvest. Labor strife and pro-
 longed bad weather threaten the 1970 sugar har-
 vest, already behind schedule.
 A struggle between the two leading sugar
 workers unions-the Communist-led Guyana Agri-
 cultural Workers Union (GAWU) and the Man-
 power Citizens Association (MPCA)-over sugar
 worker representation may cause additional de-
 lays in the current harvest, which is approxi-
 mately half over. Sugar last year accounted for
 US $41.3 million in export earnings and is of vital
 importance to the Guyanese economy.

 GAWU "workers' representatives," but Jagan ap-
 parently is not willing to accept anything short of
 full "recognition." The government may be will-
 ing to accord full recognition if it is the only way
 to avoid losing the 1970 crop.
 The only officially recognized sugar workers
 union, the MPCA, which represents about 58 per-
 cent of the workers has reacted strongly to the
 government's proposal. Although the MPCA has
 lost considerable ground in the past year, it could
 precipitate a fight for control and  is strong
 enough to cause a serious loss of production if it

 Cheddi Jagan, Communist leader of the
 People's Progressive Party, which controls GAWU,
 is taking advantage of the situation and his
 union's increased strength and better discipline to
 make a strong bid for government recognition.
 Jagan, whose popularity has been in decline, ap-
 parently believes that he has found an area in
 which to regain some of his lost status.

 save the harvest, has shown willingness to give

 An  oft-quoted cabinet minister's
 complaint around the turn of the cen-
 tury-"The Belgians, they do not exist"-
 reflects a political problem that has been
 assuming ever greater importance over the
 last generation. When the great powers
 created Belgium in 1830, they threw to-
 gether two populations with differing cul-
 tural  backgrounds, the Dutch-speaking
 Flemings and the French-speaking Wal-
 loons. With the awakening of Flemish cul-
 tural consciousness, the now more nu-
 merous Flemings have been demanding
 equal status within the state, a demand
 ultimately requiring that the old constitu-
 tion be revised. In May and June of this
 year, Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens came
 closer than any other Belgian prime minis-
 ter to achieving this elusive goal. He prob-
 ably will continue the quest during the
 coming legislative year, though he has not

 Although the French- and Dutch-speaking

 status in the judiciary and military as well in the
 late 1930s. The possibility that population shifts
 could alter the primary language in any locale was
 finally eliminated in 1963, when a series of four
 Linguistic Laws drew a definitive boundary across
 Belgium.
 Demographic and economic changes have
 complicated the drive for parity between the two

 citizens. In contrast to the gradual decline of the
 Walloon iron and steel industries, the basis of
 Belgium's economic strength in the 19th Century,
 Flemish commerce and industry have been pros-
 pering and now provide the bulk of the national
 economic wealth. For these reasons, the Franco-

 Flemish bid for equality as a drive to dominate,
 and  a  militant             Francophone     movement  has
 emerged demanding protection for Walloon inter-
 ests.
 Given the depth of the division between the
 two major communities, it is perhaps surprising
 that there has been relatively little civil strife.
 There have been only a few riots associated with
 the problem, and numerous mass demonstrations
 did not lead to violence. But the potential for
 civic disorder has always been present, and many
 moderates believe this potential has increased in
 the last decade with the emergence and growth of
 militant political parties in both camps.
 The struggle to accommodate the conflicting
 cultural, economic, and political interests of the
 two communities, once the postwar reconstruc-
 tion was completed in the 1950s, became the
 dominating political  issue of the 1960s. This

 accommodation could only be accomplished
 through revision of the constitution, a process
 requiring the approval of two thirds of the two
 houses of parliament. This approval has so far
 been impossible to obtain because of the division
 of the electorate into three major parties and a
 host of minor ones, most of which cut across
 ethnic lines. A succession of governments through
 the 1960s could not find the required majority in
 parliament for any reform package.
 Stability Through Reform
 The first major reform effort in the 1960s
 came shortly after passage of the 1963 Linguistic
 Laws, themselves an  important achievement.
 Bickering in parliament finally led the leaders of
 the three largest parties in early 1965 to discuss
 the issues outside of parliament in a series of
 "Round Table" meetings. Substantial agreement
 was reached on many issues, but the meetings
 foundered when the conservative, Brussels-based
 Liberals, the smallest of the three parties, with-
 drew because of disagreements over the future of
 the Brussels region.
 In 1966 a new government emerged, a coali-
 tion of Social Christians (Catholics) and Liberals,
 led by Social Christian leader Pierre Vanden
 Boeynants, and a respite from linguistic quarrel-
 ing followed in the form of a two-year truce
 subscribed to by all major parties. This fragile
 agreement broke down, however, in the face of
 demonstrations by militant Flemish students at
 the prestigious University of Louvain in January
 1968. The government resigned the following
 month when it was unable to agree on handling
 student demands that a beginning be made on

 relocating the university's French-speaking de-
 partments on a site in Wallonia.
 The parliamentary election campaign in Feb-
 ruary and March was dominated by the linguistic
 issue. The small, militant nationalistic parties-the
 Flemish Volksunie and its Francophone counter-
 parts, the Walloon Rally and the Francophone
 Democratic Front-trumpeted regional autonomy
 within a new federal state structure; the three
 major parties continued to uphold the principle
 of seeking reform within the present unitary state
 system. The major parties were obviously on the
 defensive, however, and it quickly became appar-
 ent as the campaign unfolded that their internal
 unity was fragile.
 To the surprise of few, the election on 28
 March  1968 showed a  remarkable growth in
 strength of the militant national parties. The
 Flemish and Walloon militants cornered 15.7 per-
 cent of the popular vote, as compared with only
 8.9 percent in the 1965 election. More impor-
 tantly, these parties increased their seats in the
 212-seat Chamber of Representatives from 15 to
 32. These gains came at the expense of the major
 parties; the Social Christians lost eight seats, the
 Socialists five, and the Liberals one.
 Although the elections left the major parties
 in their traditional position of strength, their lead-
 ers were gloomy. The Social Christians emerged
 from the contest with their Flemish and Walloon
 wings functioning as separate entities having only
 a tenuous loyalty to their national headquarters.
 Regional centrifugalism in the other two parties,
 although less strong than in the Social Christian
 Party, inhibited incisive leadership. At the same
 time, the major party leaders saw the elections as
 evidence of an increasing polarization of the elec-
 torate which could benefit only the small militant
 parties. This feeling led to the conclusion that, as
 indecisive as the March elections had been, an
 effort to win a clearer mandate from the people
 in a new election would lead only to further gains
 by the minor parties.

 The only chance at this point to achieve
 constitutional reform lay in the formation of a
 grand coalition of the three major parties, for any
 combination of only two big parties would not
 command the 142 seats in the Chamber-two-
 thirds of the total--required for constitutional
 amendments.  Even  a grand coalition was of
 doubtful efficacy, for most observers were skepti-
 cal that the leaders could enforce discipline, given
 the ugly mood of recriminations prevailing in the
 parties. In any event, the grand coalition was
 never put to the test, for the Socialists decided
 that they were too doctrinally opposed to the
 Liberals to participate in any coalition with them.
 The signs pointed, therefore, to the creation
 of a weak caretaker government, which, while
 formally charged with seeking constitutional re-
 form, would in fact undertake no major initiatives

 toward this end. Still, the search for a viable
 combination of forces proved quite protracted. It
 was not until the end of June 1968-after the
 longest interregnum in Belgian history-that Gas-
 ton Eyskens, a moderate Social Christian, was
 able to patch together a coalition with the Social-
 ists. With 128 deputies, this coalition enjoyed a
 majority, but lacked 14 seats of a two-thirds
 majority.
 By October, nevertheless, the Eyskens coali-
 tion had drawn up a legislative program encom-
 passing constitutional revision that was destined
 to remain largely unchanged up to the present.
 One major provision called for recognition in the
 constitution that the country is composed of four
 linguistic regions, the Dutch  (Flanders), the
 French (Wallonia), the bilingual Brussels area, and
 the tiny German-language region in eastern Bel-
 gium. The first two regions were also to be
 granted  "cultural  autonomy,"  including  such
 fields as education, arts and letters, museums and
 libraries, radio and television cultural activities for
 youth, cultural relations between the communi-
 ties, and, with certain restrictions, cultural rela-
 tions with foreign countries.
 The second major provision of the reform
 package called for the creation of Dutch-speaking
 and French-speaking linguistic groups in each
 house of parliament. These groups were to have
 the power to suspend parliamentary action on
 any bill if three quarters of either group decided
 the bill would be detrimental to the interests of
 its community.
 Along  with  constitutional  reform, the
 Eyskens government also drafted a program to
 decentralize decision-making in economic devel-
 opment. This program provided for the creation
 of Flemish, Walloon, and Brussels sections in the
 national Economic Planning Bureau, the creation
 of an Economic Council for Brabant (which in-
 cludes Brussels) alongside of the existing eco-
 nomic councils for Flanders and Wallonia, and the
 creation of regional development corporations.
 Special Report
 This economic decentralization program was
 intended by the government as a concession to
 the Walloons, who had long believed something of
 this nature was required to combat their region's
 economic decay. The government hoped that Wal-
 loon members of parliament would support pas-
 sage of the constitutional reforms, in which the
 Flemings were greatly interested, in exchange for
 Flemish support for economic decentralization.
 Progress toward enactment of all these meas-
 ures was glacial. They were subjected to the
 scrutiny of special parliamentary committees for
 months, while behind the scenes the power blocks
 worked out new concessions and refinements. A
 major stumbling block was the status of Brussels.
 Historically and geographically a Flemish city,
 Brussels in fact is heavily Francophone because of
 its national role since 1830. Under the Linguistic
 Laws of 1963, bilingual Brussels is defined as
 comprising 19 urban central communes, while the
 surrounding suburban communes remain legally
 Flemish. As more and more Francophones moved
 to the suburbs, they brought with them their
 French language and culture, creating pressure to
 expand the officially bilingual area of the capital
 to include these communes. At the same time,
 holding the line of the "French island" of Brus-
 sels at 19 urban communes became a rallying cry
 and a test for Flemings of all political stripes.
 A second major problem involved the mech-
 anics of passage. The economic decentralization
 program could be passed in each house of parlia-
 ment by a simple majority, which the coalition in
 theory possessed, because such a program did not
 require amending the constitution. But Flemish
 deputies in both coalition parties refused to enact
 the program until the way was clear for action on
 the constitutional reform package.
 The prospects of achieving a two-thirds ma-
 jority on the constitutional reforms seemed as
 remote as ever. The Liberals, left out of the
 government at the Socialists' insistence and re-
 fused even an unofficial role in drafting the

 legislation, threatened to boycott parliamentary
 consideration of the package, an action that
 would have denied the coalition a quorum. The
 militant Flemish and Francophone deputies, on
 the other hand, were certain to vote against the
 package because each group felt the other had
 been granted too many concessions. Finally, coa-
 lition deputies from  Brussels, particularly the
 Brussels Socialists, might break party discipline to
 vote against the bills because Brussels' plight was
 overlooked.
 By Easter 1969, several constitutional re-
 form measures were reported out of the special
 committees, where a simple majority sufficed.
 But, rather than force a showdown on the floor
 of either chamber, the government procrastinated
 until the approach of the summer recess, thereby
 reducing the politicians' appetite for protracted
 haggling or their willingness to force the govern-
 ment out of office.
 By mid-June, the government increased pres-
 sure on the Senate to act on constitutional revi-
 sion by demanding that  it remain in session
 through August if necessary. In the Chamber,
 meanwhile, it decided to move ahead on eco-
 nomic decentralization. On 19 June, the decen-
 tralization bill was passed after Eyskens promised
 publicly not to submit the bill to the Senate until
 that body had made progress on constitutional
 reform. No amount of pressure, however, could
 force the Senate to take action, and it too ad-
 journed in mid-July.
 By the time parliament resumed in the fall,
 it was clear to Eyskens that he had reached an
 impasse: he could not convince the opposition
 parties to give their blessing to proposals on con-
 stitutional reform in which they had been refused
 any hand in drafting. Although the Socialists had
 earlier refused to permit the opposition Liberals
 to participate in the drafting process, Eyskens was
 able to cajole his coalition partners by early Sep-
 tember into accepting a series of extraparlia-
 mentary discussions among representatives of five
 parties-the two coalition partners, the opposition
 Liberals, and the two important militant parties.
 These discussions, close in spirit to the Round
 Table talks of 1964-65, would hopefully lead to a
 compromise package of constitutional reforms to
 which all parties would be committed.
 The Committee of 28, popularly dubbed the
 Eyskens Committee, began meeting in September.
 It consisted of Eyskens, the two ministers for
 community relations, and parliamentarians from
 the five parties. On 30 October, to no one's
 surprise,  the  three  Volksunie  representatives
 walked out of the committee, arguing that their
 party remained opposed to any constitutional
 limitation on the rule of the Flemish majority. On
 12 November, the remainder of the committee
 had completed its final report. It was a statement
 of agreement on principles, most of which had
 been spelled out before, but it did not point
 clearly toward detailed legislation. Most impor-
 tantly, it failed to reflect any agreement on the
 status of Brussels.
 The problem of Brussels was then handed
 over to a special commission, with largely the
 same membership as the Committee of 28, amid a
 rising tide of public debate. Some Belgians argued
 that parliament should enact those compromises
 already in sight; others believed that parliament
 should enact a series of principles, leaving the
 details to a later period when agreement might be
 easier to reach. But the Volksunie and Liberals
 reiterated their threats to deny a parliamentary
 quorum on any legislation on the subject unless a
 package covering all  aspects-a  "global" solu-
 tion-were submitted. Several Francophone Social
 Christian leaders demanded in mid-December that
 Eyskens draft such a solution for presentation to
 parliament as the price for their continued partici-
 pation in the government. Although the special
 commission considered several compromise sug-
 gestions on the Brussels problem, it broke up
 shortly before Christmas after 15 sessions without
 reaching agreement.
 The cabinet was diverted in January of this
 year by other issues, chief of which was a wildcat

 strike in the Limburg coal mines, but Eyskens
 continued his patient efforts, first to obtain agree-
 ment in the cabinet on a global solution, and then
 to obtain a two-thirds quorum in parliament. He
 was spurred on by his Francophone colleagues,
 who refined their threats to leave the cabinet by
 demanding cabinet agreement on a global solution
 by 31 January and submission to parliament no
 later than 15 February. He missed the January
 deadline, but on 15 February announced to a
 surprised nation that the cabinet had unani-
 mously agreed on a community relations pro-
 gram.
 The program turned out to be a broad-brush
 formula that parliament would have to flesh out.
 The keystone was to be Francophone agreement
 to only minor changes in the Brussels situation in
 exchange for Flemish agreement to ample protec-
 tion of minority (Francophone) interests in the
 government, including parity in the distribution
 of ministerial portfolios and the right of either
 linguistic group in parliament to block legislation.
 The  package  would  not  please the  Brussels
 Francophones, but the cabinet may have cal-
 culated that the opposition Liberals would not
 dare to oppose such important legislation, which
 the majority of Belgians, supported. The Liberal
 leaders had just announced abandonment of their
 parliamentary boycott, a decision many assumed
 was taken with an eye toward communal elec-
 tions upcoming in the fall of 1970.
 Parliament did not begin to act until May.
 On the 15th, Eyskens announced that he was
 submitting to the Senate the economic decentrali-
 zation bill passed by the Chamber the previous
 June. At the same time, he was submitting a new
 bill defining the geographic scope of the new
 regional economic councils, a task left undone the
 year before because of disagreement on Brussels.
 The new bill would ensure that the six suburban
 communes around Brussels would remain under
 Flemish jurisdiction.
 On 28 May, the Senate passed three of four
 critical constitutional  amendments, one estab-
 Special Report
 lishing the linguistic groups in both houses of
 parliament, one prescribing parity in ministerial
 portfolios, and a minor bill on subministerial cabi-
 net  posts.  The important fourth amendment
 failed because of Liberal opposition. This amend-
 ment would have specified the size of the major-
 ity in either linguistic bloc in parliament that
 would be required to block proposed legislation.
 The Liberals wanted a two-thirds majority, which
 would give them virtual veto power. When the
 Liberal proposal was rejected in favor of a simple
 majority, the Liberals voted against the entire bill
 and threatened to resume their boycott of future
 consideration of legislation on constitutional revi-
 sion.
 Eyskens' fortunes seemed to take a sudden
 turn for the better when, on 9 June, the Senate

 approved the basic amendment creating the Flem-

 exhibit a heretofore unknown unity-only five
 Socialist senators from Brussels voted against the
 amendment-but the solid front of the promised
 Liberal opposition failed to materialize. All but
 one Flemish Liberal senator voted for the govern-
 ment  amendment.  If  the government parties

 could continue to maintain discipline, and if
 Flemish Liberals would support them, the re-
 mainder of the amendments could pass the Senate
 and the entire program could pass the Chamber.
 The limiting of Brussels to the 19 urban
 communes evoked a quick response from the cap-
 ital's Francophone community. On 25 June, a
 hastily  constituted  "Committee of Public
 Safety," including leaders from several political
 parties, conducted a protest demonstration in the
 center of the city. Attended by about 12,000
 people, the demonstration demanded "liberty"
 for Brussels and denounced "the iron collar" im-
 posed by the political settlement. There was no
 violence.
 Shipwreck within Sight of'Port
 Lyskens was to be denied his success in
 parliament. On 25 June, when the Senate was
 passing the 13th and final amendment having
 substantive importance for community relation,;,
 the government fell two deputies short of a
 quorum in the Chamber on an amendment con-
 cerning the organization of the Brussels metro-
 politan government. This lack of a quorum re-
 sulted from a boycott of the proceedings by the
 20 Volksunie deputies, who felt too many conces-
 sions had been made to the Francophones, and by
 45 Francophone deputies. These politicians in-

 cluded the Communists, the Walloon militants,
 the five Brussels Socialists, and several Franco-
 phone Liberals. The fate of the economic decen-
 tralization bill in the Senate, which had been
 introduced in May and was then nearing a final
 vote, was also endangered, for the Social Christian
 senators threatened to vote it down in return for
 the persisting Socialist defections on constitu-
 tional amendments.
 The decentralization bill finally passed the
 Senate by a narrow margin on 2 July after the
 Social Christian threat evaporated in a cloud of
 bitter verbiage. The next day the bill went back
 to the Chamber for final vote. The government
 again failed to raise a quorum in the Chamber for
 considering any of the constitutional amend-
 ments, and these bills currently are in limbo as a
 consequence. The government was able, however,
 to muster enough votes to pass the decentraliza-
 tion bill with a last-minute change. Ironically, this
 change involved deleting the definition of the
 geographical boundaries of Brussels. The defini-
 tion will now be accomplished by a royal decree;
 the king presumably will decide according to the
 advice of the prime minister and what he believes
 to be the majority opinion in the nation. This will
 likely be to limit Brussels to the 19 urban com-
 munes, as the Senate had defined it in May.
 The Future for Revision
 Criticized by friend and foe alike, compared
 unfavorably with other Belgian politicians past
 and present, and frustrated repeatedly in his legis-
 lative efforts, Eyskens has had ample justification
 and opportunity to resign. His failure to step
 aside suggests that he has much more courage
 than most people have given him credit for. Com-
 ing as close to success as he did near the end of
 the last parliamentary session has enhanced the
 stature of his Fabian efforts to compromise the
 irreconcilable. Chances are that Eyskens hopes to
 last out his government's mandate until 1972, and
 that he intends to press onward with constitu-
 tional revision.

 Eyskens has not revealed his tactics for the
 future, and he apparently has more than one
 option open. With parliament due to convene
 shortly after the communal elections in October,
 he may resume the battle over revision where it
 left off in July, using as leverage a threat to
 precipitate parliamentary elections by resigning.
 Because the militant nationalist parties are ex-
 pected to do well in the communal elections at
 the expense of the large parties, most observers
 believe that cumulative and reciprocal damage to
 the large parties would be the greater the closer
 communal and parliamentary elections are to
 each other. The threat of early parliamentary
 elections, therefore, might goad the leaders of the
 larger parties into greater pliability.
 Eyskens could also choose, however, to let
 the dust settle for some months, meanwhile
 patiently striving for new compromises behind
 the scenes. He may well find himself forced into
 marking time, for there is no guarantee that his
 jury-rigged scaffolding of political support for the
 revision and decentralization plans will not col-
 lapse at any time. If his political framework holds
 up, he may still opt to divert the nation's atten-
 tion for a while to other pressing problems before
 returning to revision. Chief among such problems
 is the means of financing the country's dual sys-
 tems of public and Catholic schools.
 This issue was a major domestic political
 problem from the time of Belgian independence
 until 1958, when the three major parties arrived
 at a 12-year pact under which both systems re-
 ceive state financial support. The pact expires this
 year, and will most likely simply be renewed. The
 pact has not generated much public attention so
 far, and Belgian reaction to the religious-based
 civil strife in Northern Ireland suggests the Bel-
 gian public today has little stomach for such
 controversy. Yet pact renewal could conceivably
 provoke a new crisis of sorts between strong
 Catholics, mostly in the Social Christian Party,
 and the anticlericalists in the Socialist and Liberal
 parties.
 Special Report
 If and when Eyskens returns to the battle
 over revision, one of the first decisions he will
 have to make will be whether to push for a new
 compromise over Brussels-the point of conten-
 tion which wrecked his plans earlier this year-or
 to try anew to enlist Liberal support for his old
 plans. These two alternatives need not be mu-
 tually exclusive, but either by itself might suffice
 to give his program the necessary support in par-
 liament.
 The Brussels question at this point appears
 insoluble, and whatever compromise is most
 palatable in parliament is likely to be the one
 adopted and pursued by the government. In the
 past year there has been no dearth of Brussels
 plans floated by individuals in and out of public
 life, and the Belgians' proverbial preference for
 compromise should continue to generate other
 schemes.
 The quest to line up Liberal support for
 revision and decentralization depends largely on
 the extent of the party's unity. If it emerges from
 the communal elections with its current tenuous
 degree of unity, coalition strategists may con-
 clude that the government bills can hope to pick
 up support in parliament from dissident Liberal
 elements, even though this strategy did not give
 the government victory last spring. In the unlikely
 event the Liberal image is improved by the elec-
 tions, and its unity strengthened, Social Christians
 would have to face again the task of trying to
 convince their Socialist partners to admit the Lib-
 erals into a tripartite coalition or, at least, work
 with the Liberals in another Round Table con-
 ference.
 Some Belgian political commentators, des-
 pairing of any solution at this time, believe that
 constitutional revision is a task for future genera-
 tions. If it should prove elusive in the near future,
 the government and parties will have to continue
 making such ad hoc adjustments in the country's
 political, economic, and social structure as they
 have been doing over the past few years. The
