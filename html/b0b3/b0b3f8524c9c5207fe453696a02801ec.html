 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 On the eve of President
 Eisenhower's trip to Western
 Europe, Soviet propaganda, while
 continuing to welcome the Khru-
 shchev-Eisenhower visits and the
 possibility of a relaxation of
 tensions, laid increased empha-
 sis on the differences among the
 Western powers and on the opposi-
 tion in certain Western circles,
 to the visits and to an East-
 West detente.
 Earlier charges of a "Bonn-
 Paris axis" determined to fore-
 stall any such detente have been
 revived.  Commentators have as-
 serted that Britain, in view of
 the success of Macmillan's trip
 to Moscow; favors the exchange
 of visits, while France and West
 Germany, as well as "certain
 business and military leaders"
 in the United States, are op-
 posed.   Propagandists allege
 that Adenauer intends to use
 the President's trip to Bonn to
 prevent an East-West agreement
 on disarmament and a nuclear
 weapons ban.   France's intention
 to carry out nuclear tests in
 the Sahara is laid to its de-
 sire to "poison the political
 atmosphere."
 Khrushchev'e recent person-
 al messages to several world
 leaders apparently were designed
 mainly to encourage the impres-
 sion that his exchange of visits
 with President Eisenhower is only
 the opening phase of a long se-
 ries of top-level meetings.
 Pravda has termed the exchange
 of visits the "beginning of great
 negotiations between East and
 West."  The Soviet leader prob-
 ably also hoped to minimize the
 unifying effects of President
 Eisenhower's trip to the three
 Western capitals.
 The British press has car-
 ried reports of a letter from
 Khrushchev to Prime Minister Mac-
 millan with the speculation that
 it also referred to the Khru-
 shchev-Eisenhower exchange of
 visits and to the Berlin and
 German issues.
 In an unusually lengthy
 message to Chancellor Adenauer
 dated 18 August but-not pub-
 lished until the day of Presi-
 dent Eisenhower's arrival in
 Bonn, Khrushchev reiterated in
 moderate language the Soviet
 position on Berlin and Germany
 and urged the chancellor to re-
 consider his entire policy.   He
 pointed out that the economies
 of the USSR and the Federal Re-
 public are complementary and
 stressed the advantages to both
 of increased trade.
 Stating that the USSR at-
 taches great importance to the
 forthcoming exchange of visits
 with President Eisenhower, the
 Soviet premier declared, "We
 are probably on the eve of a
 historical turning point in the
 policy of the two existing blocs
 --from further estrangement to
 gradual rapprochement and the
 settlement of outstanding is-
 sues."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 August 1959
 In addressing letters to
 UAR President Nasir and Iraqi
 Prime Minister Qasim,Khrushchev
 evidently hoped to reap the
 benefits in good will that could
 be obtained by this demonstra-
 tion of Soviet concern for their
 interests and desire to obtain
 their views on international
 issues.  He solicited Qasim's
 opinions on Middle Eastern prob-
 lems and assured him he would
 emphasize to  President Eisen-
 hower the  Soviet Union's de-
 termination to                         prevent "im-
 perialist conspiracies" against
 Iraq.
 The Soviet ambassador to
 Yugoslavia called on President
 Tito on 17 August and may have
 brought Tito similar verbal or
 written assurances from Khru-
 shchev  regarding the forthcom-
 ing talks.
 Replying on 12 August to
 a message from Indian Presi-
 dent Nehru, Khrushchev stated
 he shared Nehru's belief that
 the   visits  will have "posi-
 tive significance"  and "help
 to relieve international ten-
 sion and achieve necessary
 agreements."
 COMMUNIST CHINA CUTS BACK 1959 TARGETS
 Peiping has "readjusted"
 downward to a significant de-
 gree China's four main produc-
 tion targets for 1959--for coal,
 steel, grain, and cotton.  The
 Chinese admit "over-assessments"
 of agricultural production fig-
 ures in 1958--grain and cotton
 output claims are reduced drag-
 tically, and 1959 targets for
 both were lowered to only one
 half the original goals.  The
 readjustments of 1959 targets
 are a setback for the prestige
 of Mao Tse-tung and his lieu-
 tenants who encouraged the most
 extravagant expectations of
 rapid economic development. The
 leadership's call for further
 intensive effort on the economic
 front indicates there is to be
 no relaxation of "leap forward"
 pressures on the masses.
 Peiping's decision was con-
 tained in a communique issued
 on 26 August by the Chinese Com-
 munist party central committee,
 following its eighth plenary
 session at Lushan during the
 first two weeks in August.  The
 communique attributes the "read-
 justment" to a reassessment of
 last year's production claims
 and recent serious floods and
 droughts over large areas.
 Official investigations
 during the first half of this
 year revealed exaggerated re-
 ports from statistical units
 and hasty harvesting and stor-
 age because of inadequate labor.
 The findings enabled final

 tons had been claimed earlier
 --and 2,100,000 tons of cotton

 more than 220,000,000  tons.

 for 1958, is no long-
 er included in the
 national plan, and
 steel output for 1959
 is scaled down by 33
 percent.  The Chinese
 Communists have ap-
 parently accepted the
 fact that production
 of steel by other

 feasible.

 bilities in 1958.   Publication

 Revision of the coal target
 probably reflects a planned cut-
 back in production by the small
 local mines.  The cutback in
 total coal production for 1959
 should have no retarding effect
 on China's industrialization,
 and the new target is much more
 realistic.
 The communique confirms ear-
 lier indications that the slogans
 "great leap forward" and "leap
 forward" have been redefined in
 much more modest terms.   A Pei-

 proposed in 1956, previously
 set aside as too conservative,
 have been revived and proffered
 as realistic goals for 1959
 which can be overfulfilled by
 sustained maximum effort...
 The admission of false
 claims for 1958 and the read-
 justment of goals for 1959 en-
 tail a loss of prestige for Mao
 Tse-tung and his lieutenants
 who were most prominent in the
 "leap forward" from its incep-
 tion.  The latter group of par-
 ty-machine leaders--including
 Liu Shao-chi, the party's sec-
 ond-ranking figure; Teng Hsiao-
 ping, the party secretary oen-
 eral; and Tan Chen-lin, the
 secretariat's specialist in
 agriculture since 1957--had
 taken the lead with Mao in ex-
 horting the "leap" and in
 threatening those opposed to a
 headlong course.   For example,
 Liu, during the height of the
 program in the spring of 1958,
 denounced those who still had
 misgivings and were waiting for
 the autumn harvest to prove
 them right; "they will lose
 out in the end," he said. Sim-
 ilarly, Tan in Febrary 1959
 threatened those who felt that
 "leap" figures were "not reli-
 able," and told them to solve
 their "ideological problems"
 before they damaged the whole
 program.
 Another group of party
 leaders--principally senior ad-
 ministrators and economic spe-
 cialists, possibly including
 Premier Chou En-lai--appeared
 to have varying degres of res-
 ervation about the "leap" from
 the beginning.   Although they
 too foresaw a period of rapid
 economic advance, they seemed
 to disapprove of some features
 of the program, such as the very
 heavy reliance on exhortation
 and coercion in general, and in
 particular the incitement to
 unrealistic agricultural goals.
 The views of these leaders were
 to some degree reflected in
 those of the "gloomy clique,"
 which was periodically assailed
 in the party press and whose
 position now has been vindicated.
 Despite this latest in a
 series of reverses which his
 policies--both domestic and for-
 eign--have suffered in recent
 years, Mao apparently continues
 to dominate the party.   The com-
 muniqu6 on the "leap" notes that
 the party plenum was held un-
 der Mao's "guidance" and it con-
 cludes by urging the party and
 people to unite under Moo's
 leadership.   Similarly,   the
 central committee resolution
 affirms at several points the
 general wisdom of Mao, "the
 great leader of our party."
 Chinese Communist pronounce-
 ments to date do not suggest
 that Mao will fix the  blame
 for the "leap's" shortfall on
 the    party-machine leaders,
 despite their failure to de-
 liver what they promised. The
 resolution attempts to save
 face for this group by assert-
 ing that the "great victories"
 of 1958 and thus far in 1959
 have resulted from the increased 25X1
 role of the party machine and
 the principle of "puttin    ol-
 itics  in command."

 Communist partisan forces
 retain the initiative and are
 circulating throughout large
 areas of northern Laos,  propa-
 gandizing and intimidating the
 population.   The Communists are
 still operating in small bands
 but can concentrate adequate
 strength to seize individual
 posts..  Elements of the former
 Pathet Lao battalion that re-
 belled in May- have arrived in Sam

 there are already some 14,000
 Vietnamese living in southern
 Laos, many of whom might be
 susceptible to Communist propa-

 Morale in some Laotian Army
 fighting units is believed low,
 and the poorly informed civilian
 population in the provinces is
 extremely susceptible to rumors
 and propaganda spread by Com-
 munist cadres.   At the top levels
 of the government and the army,
 however, morale is high and
 there is'confidence that Laos
 will receive external assistance
 if the situation worsens.
 Insurgency has spread to
 eastern Luang Prabang Province,
 where the Communists are re-
 ported to have executed a num-
 ber of progovernment village
 chiefs and forcibly indoctri-
 nated the villagers.   The fam-
 ilies of government adminis-
 trators and the affluent have
 been entering the royal capital
 at Luang Prabang in a steady
 stream from these areas.
 There have been several
 incidents in areas only 60 miles
 northeast of Vientiane,  the ad-
 ministrative capital, and there
 are reports from other provinces
 that small bands have infiltrated
 to propagandize and organize
 potential guerrilla forces.
 These activities may be in prep-
 aration for a country-wide ex-

 "repudiating" the Geneva agree-
 ments,             "provoking" the civil
 war, and "betraying" the former
 Pathet Lao.   The statement also
 asserted that "as a signatory
 of the Geneva agreements and
 a country neighboring on Laos,"
 North Vietnam cannot remain
 indifferent to the serious sit-
 uation which directly threatens
 the security of North Vietnam
 and the peace in Indochina and
 Southeast Asia.   Rejecting any
 consideration of UN  action,
 Hanoi again called for reactiva-
 tion of the ICC and strict ad-
 herence to the Geneva agree-
 ments as the only solution to
 the present situation.
 The Foreign Ministry state-
 ment differs  in emphasis from
 statements attributed to the
 Laotian Neo Lao Hak Zat   (NLHZ)
 leadership by not making demands
 for domestic reforms which
 would automatically result in
 giving the Communists a privi-
 leged status in the Laotian
 community; it may therefore
 represent minimum Communist ob-
 jectives.   The domestic demands
 made by NLHZ spokesmen include
 the creation of a coalition gov-
 ernment with Communist partici-
 pation, the realignment of Laos'
 pro-Western foreign policy,  and
 would constitute,  in effect, a
 return to the privileged posi-
 tion secured in the 1957 unifica-
 tion settlement.
 UN Moves
 UN Secretary General Ham-
 marskjold, with the concurrence
 of the Laotian emissary to the
 UN,  in a letter to Nehru on 22
 August suggested that the Indian
 prime minister approach Hanoi
 and Vientiane in an effort to
 work out a "mediation formula"
 leading to the appointment of
 a "neutral" mediator.
 Hammarskjold considers the
 most logical way to appoint a
 mediator would be for the ICC
 to request him to appoint one.
 The secretary general would
 probably choose a Swiss, since
 he believes the mediator should
 be an "absolute neutral" and
 non-Asian.   Although Hammar-
 skjold admits that his plan
 might require a formal meeting
 of the ICC outside Laos to ap-
 prove a request for a mediator,
 he does not believe one such
 meeting would reactivate the
 commission.
 In reply to Hammarskjold's
 proposal, Nehru suggested that
 assurances of "active support"
 would be needed from Britain
 and the USSR, as Geneva cochair-
 men, and from Poland and Canada,
 as members of the ICC.   While
 not rejecting the proposal,
 Nehru apparently wants to en-
 sure that there is agreement
 among all concerned before In-
 dia commits its good offices.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 CARIBBEAN HIGHLIGHTS
 The situation in Haiti is
 the most pressing element in
 the continuing tension in the
 Caribbean area which led to the
 recent conference of the Amer-
 ican foreign ministers in San-
 tiago.   The newly strengthened
 Inter-American Peace Committee
 (IAPC) has been requested to
 come to.Haiti to investigate
 the 13 August landing there of
 a small, rebel force from Cuba.
 The invasion force, which
 never posed a serious military
 threat. to the Duvalier regime,
 has apparently been dissipated,
 with only a few members still
 at large in the hills of Haiti's
 southern peninsula.   Government
 officials identified four pris-
 oners taken to Port-au-Prince
 as Cubans.' The Haitian Govern-
 ment continues to maintain that
 all the invaders' except the
 leader, a French national of
 Algerian origin, were Cubans.
 Other invasions antici-
 pated by President Duvalier
 have failed to materialize.
 With the IAPC now focusing its
 attention on Haiti, the external
 threat to the government has
 abated at least temporarily.
 :The current outbreak of hostil-
 ity toward the Catholic Church,
 .however, could sharpen internal
 opposition to Duvalier and, ac-
 cording to US Ambassador Drew,
 constitutes "an act of politi-
 cal folly which could well lead
 to his downfall."
 Although nominally a Cath-
 olic, Duvalier has long been at
 loggerheads with the church,
 which he has charged with en-
 gaging in "subversive" activi-
 ties against the government.   The
 general belief that Duvalier has
 practiced voodoo rites in the
 presidential palace has also ex-
 acerbated his relations with the
 church, which has long combated
 pagan cults in Haiti.
 Duvalier has apparently
 averted a possible break with the
 'Vatican by reversing his decision
 to arrest or request the recall
 of Archbishop Poirier, a French
 citizen who had been ordered
 arrested for having protested
 the expulsion last week of two
 French priests.   The Vatican had
 threatened to excommunicate all
 connected with the arrest.
 The public has reacted
 calmly to this affair as well
 as to an incident earlier this
 year when government troops and
 police broke up a religious
 funeral procession and seized the
 body of opposition  leader
 Clement Jumelle.   Haiti's con-
 cordat with the Vatican comes
 up for renewal next year, how-
 ever, and popular opposition
 could be aroused by further
 antichurch actions which oppo-
 sition elements could construe
 as 'indicative that  Duvalier
 may not  renew the    concor-
 dat.

 conference claiming a "historic

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 August 1959
 MIDDLE EAST HIGHLIGHTS
 Iraq
 Political tensions in
 Baghdad remain acute amid the
 uncertainties created'by waves
 of conflicting rumors.        The
 anti-Communist "nationalists"
 are embittered by Prime.Minis
 ter  Qasim's maneuvering but,
 at the same time, are heart-
 tined by Brigadier Tabaqchali's
 vigorous attack on the Commu-
 nists and on Communist influ-
 ence in the Iraqi Government
 during his televised trial
 this week before the "peoples
 court.
 The Communists seem  to
 have little to gain at the mo-
 ment from provoking new dis-
 orders, since this might well
 serve only to alienate Qasim
 further.  Fear of   Communist
 violence, however, appears to
 be real, and this probably ac-
 counts for the apparently
 grossly exaggerated assertions
 of wide-scale violence last
 week in the Kurdish area of
 Sulaymaniya in eastern Iraq.
 Economic difficulties,
 which have been given relative-
 ly little publicity amid  the
 political turmoil, are becoming
 more immediate problems for the
 Qasim regime.   Grain, barley in
 particular, has skyrocketed in
 price, and with the slowing,or
 stoppage of imports from Iraq's
 normal Western sources, the
 stage has been set for danger-
 ous inflation and corruption.
 "Expediters" in Baghdad are al-
 ready reported to be selling
 import licenses for grain at a
 rate of $2.80 per ton.
 The president of the Bagh-
 dad chamber of commerce has an-
 nounced that, because of bad
 weather and confusion in  the
 agrarian reform, the harvest
 has been only 45 to 55 percent
 of normal.   The regime is seek-
 ing to facilitate imports, but
 grain shortages, added to  the
 now chronic unemployment,  may
 still further complicate  the
 political situation.
 Arab League Conference
 Arab diplomatic activity
 has been concentrated this week
 on setting the stage for the
 Arab League conference which is
 to open in Casablanca on 1 Sep-
 tember.   Iraq, piqued over the
 rejection of Baghdad as the con-
 ference site, appears to have
 decided finally not to send a
 delegation.   This decision re-
 duces the importance of the
 meeting, which it was  hoped
 might provide the means of pro-
 moting a modus vivendi between
 the Qasim and Nasir regimes.
 The Arab diplomats  will
 vary considerably in   status,
 since Jordan, for example, will
 be represented by Prime Minister
 Majalli, while Saudi Arabia's
 delegation will be headed merely
 by the education minister. Never-
 theless, the delegates are ex-
 pected to produce some new mani-
 festo on the Palestine refugee
 problem as well as to hash over
 Algeria and other old issues.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 August 1959
 Discussion of Palestine
 results from the need for a re-
 ply to UN Secretary General
 Hammarskjold's recent proposals
 for the continuation of         the
 United Nations relief program
 in a drastically modified form,
 but a new pronouncement on the
 area will not necessarily be
 arrived at easily.
 The Jordanian Government
 is already irritated by "sug-
 gestions" from Lebanese Chris-
 tian leader Peirre Jumayyal
 and from the notorious fanatic
 Haj Amin al-Husayni, ex-grand
 mufti of Jerusalem, calling
 for the creation of a Palestine
 government and the concentra-
 tion of all refugees in West
 Jordan.   Such a government
 would most logically be set up
 there because it is the former
 eastern area of Palestine and
 contains the largest number of
 refugees.

 Saudi Arabia and the UAR
 apparently are continuing to
 stand firm against Ceylon's de-
 sire to send Ceylonese crews to
 Eilat in the Gulf of Aqaba to

 27 August 1959
 Domestically, the Israelis
 are preparing for parliamentary
 elections which are scheduled
 for mid-November.   There has
 been serious unrest and grow-
 ing political consciousness
 among the Jews of North Afri-
 can and other so-called "Ori-
 ental" origin in Israel, who
 feel they are being discrimi-
 nated against by the dominant,
 better educated Israelis  of
 European background.   This has
 made the elections appear less
 predictable in outcome than
 previously.
 Most Israeli parties  are
 making special efforts to ap-
 peal to the Orientals, although
 the conservative General Zion-
 ists are seeking to reassure
 their members of European back-
 ground that their party will
 resist the lowering of economic
 and cultural standards which
 might result from a sudden sur-
 render to the demands of the
 Oriental community.   The elec-
 tion campaign so far is quiet,
 however, so much so that a num-
 ber of stalwarts of the domi-
 nant Mapai party were observed
 sleeping during an election
 rally address by Foreign Min-
 ister Meir at a Tel Aviv the-
 ater last week.
 Lebanon
 The recent departure from
 Lebanon of Christian ex-Presi-
 dent Chamoun on an Aegean cruise,
 the embarkation of extremist Mos
 lem leader Saib Salaam on a Euro-
 pean tour, and the seclusion of
 Druze leader Kamil Jumblatt in
 his castle in southern Lebanon
 add::: assurance that the country
 is returning to a period of po-
 litical peace unknown since the
 spring of 1958.   Chamoun's fail-
 ure in particular to derive capi-
 tal from the assassination in
 July of his principal lieutenant
 has seriously weakened his hold
 over the Lebanese Christian com-
 munity, although some unexpected
 incident of violence could en-
 able him to resecure his fol-
 lowing.
 Concurrently with Chamoun's
 temporary retirement and loss of
 influence, there has been a some-
 what parallel reduction in the
 standing and influence of the
 UAR.   Part of this decline re-
 sults from the shift in Communist
 tactics from supporting Nasir to
 favoring Iraq's Qasim as the mod-
 el Arab leader.   Communist in-
 fluence in this respect is par--
 ticularly impressive to Prime
 i Minister Karami, much of whose
 support in his home area of
 Tripoli in northern Lebanon de-
 pends on the Communists.
 The multiplicity of pro-
 UAR groups operating within
 Lebanon has also adversely af-
 fected the UAR position, since
 the UAR Embassy and UAR intelli-
 gence frequently appear to be at
 odds with each other while
 Nasir's Syrian hatchetman, Abd
 al-Hamid Sarraj, operates inde-
 pendently of both and at times,
 it would appear, even in conflict
 with Cairo's policy.   In conse-
 quence, several former Lebanese
 rebel leaders now speak openly
 against Nasir.
 The general public's weari-
 j                                                        ness with conflict and its dis-
 illusion with its former heroes
 may smooth a cabinet change
 scheduled for October.   The re-
 organization is necessitated by
 the illness of Foreign Minister
 Uwayni, now hospitalized in
 Paris with a heart ailment.
 Ambitious politicians, maneu-
 vering behind the' traditional
 desire of religious minorities
 for cabinet representation, are
 seeking to expand the cabinet
 beyond its present four-man size.
 The major contest seems likely
 to occur over the Druze seat,
 since the Druze remain sharply
 divided between the supporters
 of the traditionalist Majid
 Arslan and the "socialist"
 Jumblatt.

 Moscow   is  renewing  its

 Soviet leaders apparently hope

 CONSULTATIONS AMONG ASIAN COMMUNIST LEADERS
 During  July  and  part
 of   August,  when Communist
 China's  leaders were    absent
 from Peiping,   two of   the
 three other   Asian Communist

 Union, Ho made a leisurely trip
 through Communist China, partly
 by train, during which an un-
 explained gap in his schedule
 could have allowed time for a
 conference with Chinese leaders.
 He was given an official recep-
 tion in Peiping on 21 August by
 government Chairman Liu Shao-
 chi and Premier Chou En-lai and
 left for Hanoi on 25 August.
 On 20 August, while Ho was
 in Peiping,   Soviet 'Premier
 Khrushchev received Mongolian
 -First Secretary Tsedenbal in
 Yalta for  "friendly   cordial
 talks," according to Moscow
 newspapers.   Furthermore, Ulan
 Bator announced that  Tseden-
 bal would visit Hanoi shortly
 in response to an invitation
 from the North Vietnamese party
 and government.   Since Tsedenbal
 is not known to have visited
 Communist China since 1952, he
 may stop off at Peiping en route
 to or from Hanoi for a meeting'
 with Chinese leaders.
 While North Korea's Kim I1-
 sung is not known to have partic-
 ipated in the putative meeting
 of Chinese leaders nor to have
 journeyed outside the country
 during the summer, he was absent
 from Pyongyang for a period of
 about five weeks coincident with
 the absence of Communist China's
 leaders from Peiping, and could
 thus have joined their meeting
 or visited other bloc nations.
 There has been no public
 report of the topics discussed
 at the announced meetings in-
 volving Asian Communist leaders.
 The meeting of Chinese leaders
 was probably concerned largely
 with domestic matters, but the
 Laotian situation must have been
 considered.   In view of Ho Chi
 Minh's prior contacts with So-
 viet leaders, it is possible
 that he served as intermediary
 in a move to coordinate bloc
 policy on Laos. Five members of
 the Chinese Communist party po-
 litburo believed responsible for
 military affairs were not re-
 ported present at a Supreme
 State Conference in Peiping on
 24 August and may still be dis-
 cussing military problems.
 Khrushchev's meetings with
 at least two Asian Communists
 suggest that another motive in
 these recent contacts may have
 been his desire to reassure
 Asian members of the bloc that
 their interests would not be
 slighted during the forthcoming
 exchange of visits between him-
 self and President Eisenhower.
 Peiping continues to be
 plagued with armed resistance
 in Tibetan areas and possibly
 faces a new flare-up of rebel
 activity.   Tibetans in India
 seem fairly well informed on
 the present situation in Tibet.
 Areas of combat have been pin-
 pointed in recent statements by
 the Dalai Lama's brother.
 Chinese Communist troops,
 which may number over 100,000
 in Tibet alone, appear to be at-
 tempting to eliminate armed dis-
 sident groups by cutting them
 off from money, food, and sup-
 plies, by eliminating elements
 of the population friendly to
 rebels, and by carrying out mass
 trials of "reactionaries" op-
 posed to the reform program.

 JAPANESE - SOUTH KOREAN RELATIONS
 Negotiations which began
 between Japan and South Korea
 on 12 August for the settlement
 of outstanding differences have
 only limited prospects for im-
 proving relations between the
 two countries as long as Seoul
 persists in its efforts to block
 the repatriation of Korean resi-
 dents in Japan to North Korea.
 Seoul is continuing to delay
 the exchange of Japanese fisher-
 men held in Korea for violations
 of the Rhee Line for those Ko-
 reans detained for illegal en-
 try into Japan, has not resumed
 trade with Japan, or stopped
 the seizures of Japanese fish-
 ing boats.
 Seoul is insisting that the
 settlement of the legal status
 of Korean residents in Japan be
 given priority over the numerous
 other issues, claiming that un-
 less, Japan agrees to remove al-
 leged legal and other forms of
 discrimination, these Koreans
 will not have a "free choice"
 of residence.   The South Korean
 press is continuing to urge that
 the talks be used to block re-
 patriation to North Korea, and
 has commented favorably on Presi-
 dent Rhee's statement that all
 Korean residents are South Ko-
 rean citizens and cannot be sent
 anywhere without Seoul's consent.
 Tokyo is willing to dis-
 cuss the legal status of  Ko-
 rean residents provided this
 will not prejudice the repatri-
 ation to North Korea and that
 Seoul is prepared to exchange
 detainees immediately. Although
 irritated by the recently re-
 sumed seizures of  Japanese
 fishing boats, Tokyo is unlike-
 ly to use force in patrolling
 the Rhee Line.
 Meanwhile, steps are being
 taken to carry out the repatri-

 president of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross,
 arrived  in Tokyo on 23 August
 to oversee the repatriation
 processing.   The Japanese Red
 Cross will soon undertake ini-
 tial repatriation procedures,     25X1
 and the first repatriation ship
 is expected to depart for North
 Korea in early November.

 BLOC RENEWING ECONOMIC AID. ACTIVITY IN INDONESIA
 The signing of additional
 protocols for implementing the
 Soviet Union's $117,500,000
 aid program in Indonesia sug-
 gests that Moscow intends to
 revitalize the bloc's lagging
 economic efforts there.
 According to a recent an-
 nouncement, top priority under
 present implementation contracts
 will be assigned to the Asian
 Games stadium project to be
 built with $12,500,000 in So-
 viet credits.  This stadium
 reportedly will seat some 100,-
 000 persons,and, although dif-
 ficult to justify in the light
 of Djakarta's pressing economic
 needs, is calculated to provide
 the maximum psychological im-
 pact on Indonesia's population.
 Although the Indonesian
 Government wanted a recent
 credit of $5,000,000 for educa-
 tional purposes to be split
 among various educational insti-
 tutions already in existence,
 the Soviet Union insisted that
 it be used to establish a tech-
 nological institute at Ambon,
 the capital of the Moluccas--an
 area in which Soviet influence
 has been negligible.  Construc-
 tion has reportedly been post-
 poned indefinitely by the Indo-
 nesian Government, increasingly
 concerned over Soviet motives
 in this area.
 Of the more than $240,-
 000,000 in economic aid ex-
 tended to Indonesia by the bloc
 since 1955, some $135,000,000
 has been obligated but only
 about $60,000,000 utilized.
 Most of the credits used have
 been delivered in the form of
 equipment, foodstuffs, and con-
 sumer goods, and only about
 $13,000,000 has been used on
 economic development projects.
 The good will generated
 by such projects has been off-
 set to a large extent by dif-
 ficulties and misfortunes.  A
 tire and rubber plant, con-
 tracted early in 1956 from
 Czechoslovakia, was not formal-
 ly inaugurated until 6 May 1959
 --one and one-half years behind
 schedule;  it is the first bloc
 project successfully completed
 in Indonesia.
 The East German sugar mill
 in Jogjakarta, after having
 broken down last year, was re-
 opened in May and apparently is
 operating successfully, but only

 after incurring the wrath of
 local sugar producers who suf-
 fered during the delay.   Com-
 plaints of faulty bloc equip-
 ment, continue to be heard among
 Indonesian officials, who gen-
 erally prefer Western equipment.
 These difficulties, however,   .
 also reflect Indonesia's short-
 age of trained technicians and
 the absence of a sound mainte-
 nance system.
 Other bloc projects in
 Indonesia, most of which are
 still in preliminary stages,
 include a $5,000,000 shipyard
 built with Polish help, a So-

 under construction, two steel
 plants, and a large Soviet pro-

 INDONESIAN INTERNAL PROBLEMS
 The new Indonesian Govern-
 ment, faced with mounting infla-
 tion and a scarcity of essen-
 tial goods, took its first ma-
 jor remedial measures on 24 Au-
 gust when it took over 90 per-
 cent of the deposits in bank
 accounts exceeding 25,000 rupi-
 ahs (approximately $555 at the
 new rate of exchange)   and  de-
 valuated by 90 percent 500- and
 1,000-rupiah bank notes.   Im-
 port taxes on luxury goods were
 increased, a complicated export-
 certificate system introduced
 two years ago was abolished,
 and the exchange rate was fixed
 at 45 rupiahs to the  dollar,
 replacing the former  rate  of
 11.4 to the dollar.
 The government reportedly
 expects the withdrawal of 8.5
 billion rupiahs from  the  31
 billion formerly in circula-
 tion as a result of the currency
 reform, and the withdrawal of
 3.5 billion from the freezing
 of accounts.   The measures will
 probably be principally effec-
 tive, however, in undercutting
 extensive black-market opera-
 tions rather than in reducing
 general price levels.   The
 government also hopes the re-
 forms will hurt the Sumatran
 and Celebes rebels by forcing
 their counterfeit notes,mostly
 of high denomination,  out  of
 circulation.
 The reforms, involving an
 obvious effort to protect low-
 income groups from the effects
 of devaluation, will seriously
 damage Indonesia's business and
 moneyed classes, with the Chi-
 nese probably the principal
 victims.   The currency losses,
 combined with the freezing of
 bank accounts, will make  the
 operation of much large private
 enterprise virtually impossible.
 Provision has been made, how-
 ever, for exemptions from  the
 freeze for certain categories
 of institutions and for pur-
 poses consistent with govern-
 ment financial and economic
 policy.
 The Communists apparently
 have scored a victory in gain-
 ing the army's reluctant ap-
 proval for the convening of the
 party's sixth national congress
 on 7 September. The explanation
 for their success appears to be

 a combination of Communist
 bluff, an army mistake, and
 interference by President Su-
 karno on behalf of the party.
 The party had earlier ap-
 plied for and received army
 permission--granted apparently
 in ignorance of the scope of
 the meeting--to convene the con-
 gress on 22 August.  Party Sec-
 retary General Aidit ignored
 a later army request for "indef-
 inite postponement" of the con-`
 gress,claiming that permission
 had already, been granted. There
 are indications that at this
 point President Sukarno over-
 ruled army efforts to cancel
 the meeting and possibly sug-
 gested the compromise date of
 7 September.
 The party is anxious to
 hold the congress, having re-
 peatedly postponed it from its
 initially scheduled date in
 mid-1958, largely because of
 army pressures.  With an in-
 creased membership and a do-
 mestic situation less favor-
 able to Communist interests,
 party leaders wish to brief
 cadres and lay down revised
 tactical lines.
 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 Various control measures
 and the absence of organized
 political opposition assure a
 victory for the Diem government
 in South Vietnam's National As-
 sembly elections on 30 August.
 The administration:'s  political
 apparatus is even more encom-:
 passing today than in March
 1956, when the nation's first
 general elections produced a
 solid pro-Diem legislature.
 Less certain, however, is the
 smoothness with which the elec-
 tions will take place, particu-
 larly in view of possible dis-
 ruptive tactics by the Commu-
 nist underground,
 The majority of the 123
 assembly seats at stake will
 probably be filled by members
 of the National Revolutionary
 Movement (NRM), the govern-
 ment's instrument for political
 control of the masses and the
 only significant party partici-
 pating in the elections.   "In-
 dependent" candidates enjoying
 covert government support are
 expected to win the bulk of
 the remaining seats.  Govern-
 ment favorites probably face
 their most serious challenge
 in Saigon, where an average of
 ten candidates are competing
 for each of the prefecture's
 nine seats.   In the absence of
 real policy issues, the ten-day
 campaign period has been waged
 largely on personalities.  A
 new factor in the elections will
 be the votes of the approximate-
 ly 100,000 Chinese naturalized
 by decree since 1957.
 President Diem is anxious
 for the elections to appear as
 democratic as possible for
 reasons of international pres-
 tige, particularly with the
 psychological impact on the North
 Vietnamese masses in mind.  The
 government, however, apparently
 is prepared to resort to intimi-
 dation and to marshal military
 votes to defeat candidates con-
 sidered inimical to'national
 interests.   Included in this
 category are several candidates
 backed by the labor unions,
 which are believed to have been
 penetrated by Communists,   Aside
 from considerations of political
 reliability, Diem is interested
 in improving the quality of the
 unicameral legislature's member-
 ship.

 RULING ALLIANCE PARTY SWEEPS NATIONAL ELECTIONS IN MALAYA
 The more than two-thirds
 majority in the House of Repre-
 sentatives won by. the ruling Al-
 liance party in the 19 August
 general` elections improves im-
 mediate prospects for political
 stability in the Federation of
 Malaya and apparently assures
 the continuation of the feder-
 ation's pro-Western orientation
 and moderate domestic policies.
 The Alliance won 73 of the 104
 seats in the House, which re-
 places the partially elected
 Legislative Council formed prior
 to Malayan independence. Of the
 principal opposition parties,
 the Pan-Malayan Islamic party
 won 13 seats, the Socialist
 Front, eight, and the People's
 Progressive party, four,
 The sweeping victory is a
 personal  triumph for Abdul

 minister in mid-April to devote
 full time to campaigning and to
 strengthening the Alliance or-
 ganization.  Rahman resumed of-

 NORTH AFRICAN STATES BID FOR ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE
 Morocco and Tunisia, hav-
 ing reached stalemates in eco-
 nomic negotiations with France,
 apparently are consulting on
 measures to resist French eco-
 nomic pressures.   Following a
 first round of talks in Rabat,
 Moroccan Deputy Premier Boua-
 bid is spending several days
 this week in Tunis.  The two
 governments may be considering
 simultaneous announcement of
 their withdrawal from the French
 franc zone.
 Since midyear the Moroccan
 Government has been beset by
 financial paralysis, partly re-.
 suiting from the cumulative ef-
 fects of Paris' devaluation of
 the franc in December and from
 its freezing on 1 July of Mor-
 occo's foreign exchange balances
 --a maneuver aimed at forcing
 Morocco also to devaluate its
 currency.   Ultranationalistic
 groups of both left- and right-
 wing tendencies have been press-
 ing the government to break
 away completely from economic
 and .financial dependence on
 France, and they consequently
 oppose devaluation.
 The Ibrahim government, al-
 ready split regarding the eco-
 nomic need to devaluate, is re-
 ported to have decided on 19
 August to leave-the franc zone.
 It may hope that the fanfare of
 such an announcement would blunt
 the political repercussions of
 devaluation.   Exploring alterna-
 tives to devaluation, the Ibra-
 him government has discussed
 economic aid with the USSR, pos-
 sibly including short-term for-
 eign exchange assistance.   It
 is also pressing the United
 States for retroactive payment
 of duties on materials imported
 into Morocco in connection with
 the American air bases.
 Tunisia, which also refused
 to ~align'.itS' dinar  with the
 French currency last December,
 seems to have fared somewhat
 better financially than has Mo-
 rocco.   President Bourguiba has
 accompanied his many threats to
 leave the franc zone with a more
 effective fiscal policy and a
 concerted effort to expand Tu-
 nisia's foreign trade with non-
 franc areas, including the So-
 viet bloc.
 Most recently, on 20 August,
 Bourguiba announced the abroga-
 tion effective 1 October of the
 Tunisian-French customs union..

 to curb domestic criticism that

 tures.
 ETHIOPIAN RELATIONS WITH US MAY DETERIORATE
 Ethiopian officials deny
 that the recent agreements
 reached by Emperor Haile Selas-
 sie in Moscow and Prague signify
 a change in Ethiopia's tradi-
 tional pro-Western orientation.
 Nevertheless, an apparent change
 in the attitude of Ethiopian
 officials toward the Kremlin
 and the veiled threats directed
 at the United States by Acting
 Prime Minister Aklilou and For-
 eign.Minister Deressa suggest
 that American interests in
 Ethiopia face difficulties.
 The American Embassy in
 Addis Ababa believes the "red-
 carpet" treatment accorded the
 Emperor and his aides:. by their
 Communist hosts contributed to
 a considerable change in their
 attitude toward Moscow.   Aklilou
 told the embassy that he had
 seen in the Soviet Union "real
 personal liberty," and "millions
 of gay, well-dressed, and well-
 fed Russians."  Furthermore, he
 is convinced that the leaders
 of the Kremlin want peace.
 Both Aklilou and Deressa
 have reiterated that Ethiopia's
 acceptance of bloc assistance
 indicates no change in its re-
 lations with the United States;
 they insist that the credits
 were accepted, for economic rea-
 sons.   Deressa reasons that
 since the amount and direction
 of assistance from the United
 States is insufficient for Ethi-
 opia's needs, aid from other
 sources is necessary.   He as-
 serts that Ethiopia's reliance
 on private enterprise--both
 foreign and domestic--has failed
 to industrialize the country
 and that a study of the move-
 ment of investment capital to
 underdeveloped economies through-
 out the world convinces Addis
 Ababa that economic progress
 must be directed by the state,as
 in the Soviet Union.
 Aklilou and Deressa declare
 that continued good relations
 between Addis Ababa and Wash-
 ington depend on the degree of
 American support in the UN.
 They claim that'Addis Ababa
 has been. subjected to consider-
 able political embarrassment
 over its support of US positions
 in the . UN,.especially from the
 Afro-Asian nations.   They warn
 that unless the United States
 supports issues of primary im-
 portance to Ethiopia, such as
 its border dispute with Somalia
 and the Greater Somali issue,
 Addis Ababa will be forced to

 and with 'the Soviet bloc.

 BRITISH LABOR PARTY'S VIEWS ON EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 The ten-day visit to the
 USSR   by  British  Labor  party
 leaders Galtskell and Bevan will
 provide an opportunity to test
 Khrushchev's reactions to their
 proposals for easing East-West
 tensions.   Since preparations
 for the Eisenhower-Khrushchev
 exchange will overshadow their
 own trip--beginning 29 August--
 the Labor leaders may be eager
 to dramatize their meetings with
 the Soviet leaders in view of
 the general election campaign
 expected this fall.   Labor is
 especially concerned about the
 Conservative party's popular

 posals for easing East-West ten-
 sions retain a distinct charac-
 ter, nevertheless--mainly the
 "Gaitskell Plan" for a broad
 central European neutral belt.
 As described in conversations
 with American Embassy officials,
 Bevan's and Gaitskell's views
 stem partly from a conviction
 that normalization of relations
 --with the satellites as well
 as with Moscow--may prove more
 important in preserving peace
 than maintaining the West's
 present military stature.
 1.  Gradual  withdrawal of  all  foreign  military
 forces from a  "neutral zone" of West and East Germany,
 Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.
 2.  Establtahment of controls over  national armed
 forces in this zone.

 4.  Guarantee of territorial  integrity of neutral
 zone  states by  themselves  and by  the United States,
 Britain, and the Soviet Union.
 5.  Withdrawal of Germany from NATO and of Poland,

 While believing the West
 would gain propaganda advantage
 from appearing more "flexible,"
 the Labor party leaders insist
 that only "self-enforcing" agree-

 give full credence to Russian
 fears of German military resur-

 UN MEMBERS CRITICAL OF PROPOSED DISARMAMENT GROUP
 The negative reaction of
 the 20 Latin American countries
 to the Geneva foreign minis-
 ters, proposal for a ten-member
 disarmament group--consisting
 of representatives of five West-
 ern and Soviet bloc countries
 --will be shared by many other
 UN members resentful of their
 exclusion from disarmament ne-
 gotiations.  The Latin Ameri-
 can bloc,.which in the past has
 strongly opposed the USSR's de-
 mand for parity between East
 and West in UN bodies, now
 feels "let down and exposed"
 and will be reluctant to take
 a similar strong stand in the
 future.
 On  20  August  the Latin
 American group was briefed by
 Ambassador Lodge on the pro-
 posed new disarmament group.
 The reaction was immediate and
 negative.   While most of the
 ambassadors remained "glum and
 silent," the Brazilian, Argen-
 tine, and Ecuadoran ambassadors
 spoke out strongly.  The Bra-
 zilian said the proposal com-
 pletely ignored the UN charter
 and warned that some "essence"
 of the UN must be injected in-
 to the proposed group or "we
 could expect a bad vote on dis-
 armament" from the General As-
 sembly.
 The group objected to the
 exclusion of Asian and Latin
 American members from disarma-
 ment discussions and regretted
 the inclusion of only NATO coun-
 tries on the Western side.   Ac-
 ceptance of parity was charac-
 terized as a "premature conces-
 sion" to the USSR.  The Ecuador-
 an ambassador believes this will
 seriously undermine the West's
 stand against parity in other
 UN bodies.
 Many other UN members, such
 as India, which has desired ac-
 tive participation in disarma-
 ment negotiations for many years,
 probably share these views.. Some
 have already objected to the
 proposal because of the lack of
 an effective link to the UN.
 To meet this criticism and
 make the proposal more palatable
 to the majority of UN members,
 Secretary General Hammarskjold
 has agreed to call a meeting of
 the 82-member UN Disarmament
 Commission just prior to the
 opening of the next session of
 the General Assembly. There he
 will state his willingness to
 appoint an observer, presumably
 a high-ranking member of the
 secretariat, to the proposed
 group.    Although  Hammarskjold
 basically does not like the
 composition of the new group or
 its lack of effective ties to
 the UN, he is willing to. lend     25X1
 the full weight of his office
 to break the impasse in disar-
 mament negotiations.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 August 1959
 The harmony in Polish-
 Soviet relations demonstrated
 during Khrushchev:'s tour of
 Poland in mid-July contrasts
 sharply with the hostility evi-
 dent in October 1956, when Khru-
 shchev arrived in Warsaw fearing
 Gomulka's accession to power
 might lead to an attempt to
 withdraw Poland from the Com-
 munist bloc.   There are many
 indications, as Khrushchev
 claimed in his speech on 21
 July, that the Polish and So-
 viet leaders have overcome their
 differences. Khrushchev has de-
 cided that Soviet purposes will
 best be served by permitting
 the Polish party and state a
 substantial degree of internal
 autonomy--within the general
 framework of Communist ide-
 ology--to satisfy Polish so-
 cial, economic, and cultural
 requirements.
 Gradual Change
 This improvement in rela-
 tions has been a gradual proc-
 ess.   By 1958, Gomulka.'s al-
 tered attitude on such issues
 as the Hungarian revolution,
 Yugoslavia, and the role of the
 Soviet Union in the "socialist
 camp" apparently had dispelled
 most of Khrushchev's reserva-
 tions.  The consolidation of
 Gomulka's,position within the
 Polish party and the relative
 success of his policies, to-
 gether with his position on
 revisionism, seemed to vindi-
 cate Khrushchev's acceptance
 of the Polish leader in 1956.
 At the same time, the
 greater rigidity demonstrated
 by other Communist leaders--
 including the Chinese--strength-
 ened the belief of many Polish
 Communists that Khrushchev was
 the only bloc leader with whom
 they could deal.  This belief
 apparently was bolstered by
 the effusive cordiality with
 which Khrushchev received Go-
 mulka and the Polish delega-
 tion during their lengthy visit
 to the USSR in October and No-
 vember 1958. There is evidence
 that Khrushchev used this visit
 to "sell" the Polish leadership
 to influential circles of the
 Soviet party apparatus.   On his
 return to Poland, armed with
 Khrushchev's qualified accept-
 ance, Gomulka was able to deal
 more effectively with his oppo-
 nents in the party and to con-
 solidate his position in prep-
 aration for the party congress
 in March 1959.
 If there are elements of
 Gomulka's brand of Communism
 that Khrushchev does not like--
 and presumably there are--it
 appears certain that he has re-
 solved to tolerate them for the
 sake of harmonious relations.
 Khrushchev probably views con-
 ditions in Poland today as the
 best that can be expected un-
 der the circumstances and far
 better than he anticipated in
 1956.
 The Two Leaders
 Gomulka's own character
 appears to have been an impor-
 tant factor in the present state
 of relations between Poland and
 the Soviet Union.   In his ap-
 proach to difficult problems,
 the Polish leader has repeat-
 edly demonstrated great strength
 of character, combined with a
 keen sense of political realism,
 and, within the framework of
 Marxism-Leninism, a singularly
 undogmatic flexibility.   The
 speed with which Gomulka gained
 control of and revived the Pol-
 i.s:ht party heightened Khru-
 shchev's respect for him.
 Reports of the development
 of mutual respect--if not actual
 friendship--between Khrushchev
 and Gomulka appear borne out by

 the Soviet leader's
 warm praise of Go-

 tour of Poland last
 month.
 For his part,
 Gomulka frequently
 praised Khrushchev
 and the Kremlin dur-
 ing the July visit.
 He apparently had
 lost his former dis-
 trust of Khrushchev,
 probably because he
 has come to believe
 that the Soviet lead-
 er is a pragmatist
 who realizes that
 Gomulka's approach
 is the only effec-
 tive way to "build

 land.   At any rate,
 in the numerous
 speeches throughout
 the visit there were

 Danzig (Gdansk; now under Polish administration

 no indications of a divergence
 of views, such as was noted on
 previous occasions.  Gomulka
 has declared full support for
 Soviet policy on a German
 peace treaty, a settlement of
 the Berlin problem, Communist
 China's right to Taiwan, and
 nuclear testing.
 The Oder-Neisse
 International recognition
 of the Oder-Neisse line as
 Poland's legitimate western
 boundary is a major preoccu-
 pation of Polish foreign pol-
 icy, and Warsaw realizes that
 only the USSR can guarantee
 the boundary, in view of the
 Western powers' refusal to
 recognize its validity until
 there is a peace treaty with
 Germany.
 Khrushchev chose Szczecin
 --the former German port of
 Stettin--as the locale for his
 speech pledging support for the
 Oder-Neisse line.  There he re-
 iterated Soviet determination
 to maintain the boundary and
 promised that the USSR would
 fight to defend it if neces-
 sary.   Aware of the Polish

 feeling that the Western Terri-
 tories are irrevocably Polish,
 Khrushchev could not have
 missed the significance of the
 fact that he received more en-
 thusiastic applause for this
 speech than on any other occa-
 sion during his tour.
 Approval of Gomulka's Road
 In his 21 July speech in
 Warsaw on the occasion of the
 15th anniversary of Poland's
 "liberation," Khrushchev ap-
 proved Poland's right to handle
 its domestic affairs in its
 own way.  He stated, "One can-
 not demand that the Polish
 party, in solving any question
 of the internal life of Poland,
 pursue a policy which coin-
 cides fully with the policy of
 the Communist party of the So-
 viet Union.  Each country must
 build socialism and advance
 toward Communism by taking into
 consideration its national, cul-
 tural, and ideological peculi-
 arities."   In none of his
 speeches was there any evi-
 dence of pressure on Poland
 to adhere more closely to the
 Soviet pattern.

 of other bloc countries;       thus
 it is a potential source of
 trouble for their leaders, al-
 ways concerned lest the intel-
 lectuals use the Polish example
 to demand greater freedom of
 expression.
 An accord with the Soviet
 Union has many implications for
 the Polish domestic scene.   Go-
 mulka can,  for the time being
 at least, pursue his own inter-
 nal policies without fear of
 Soviet pressure.   Regime pol-
 icies toward the church, the
 peasantry, and the press may
 harden somewhat, but Gomulka
 is unlikely to go so far as
 vigorous persecution of the
 church or excessive oppression
 of the peasants.   While he
 probably would like to cur-
 tail some freedom of expres-
 sion, he is strongly opposed
 to any return to police-state
 methods.
 Polish Agriculture
 Perhaps the most impor-
 tant of Khrushchev's statements
 dealt with the most crucial is-
 sue in Soviet-Polish, and in-
 deed Polish-bloc, relations--
 collectivization of agricul-
 ture.   Warsaw's refusal to
 make any determined efforts to
 push collectivization since
 Polish agriculture reverted al-
 most entirely to private farm-
 ing after Gomulka's return to
 power in 1956 is a particularly
 serious deviation from standard
 bloc policy at a time when all
 other bloc countries are accel-
 erating their drives for col-
 lectivization.
 Nevertheless, Khrushchev
 explicitly endorsed the Polish
 regime's unorthodox agricul-
 tural course.                     His speech at
 the Plawce cooperative farm
 near Poznan was a folksy at-
 tempt to convince the peas-
 ants of the superiorities and
 benefits of collectivized as
 opposed to private farming.
 At the same time, however,
 he repeated that "you cannot
 forcibly drag people into co-
 operatives" and that in a few
 years these same peasants would
 agree with him on the virtues
 of collectivization.  His em-
 phasis on persuasion and his
 rejection of the use of force
 in collectivization--while hypo-
 critical  in  the light of
 Soviet and bloc practice and
 perhaps carrying overtones of
 pressure for greater speed--ap-
 pear to eliminate for the time
 being the likelihood of friction
 between Poland and the USSR
 over the collectivization issue.
 Effect on the Bloc
 Although the pragmatic So-
 viet approach to Poland may be
 designed for that country alone,
 it is possible that other satel-
 lite regimes may consider that
 Khrushchev's statements on free-
 dom to determine internal pol-
 icies have a general application.
 Many of his statements in Poland
 could be seized on by leaders or
 factions in other bloc countries
 to justify independent or diver-
 gent policies.   Poland's devia-
 tion from orthodox Communist or-
 ganization in the countryside--
 apparently with Soviet approval
 --is a striking anomaly within
 the bloc and may heighten what-
 ever difficulties other bloc
 countries are encountering in
 pursuing the universally unpop-
 ular policy of collectivization.
 Khrushchev may not be great-
 ly concerned over the potential-
 ly disruptive effect of his tol-
 eration of Polish differences
 from other bloc countries. He
 may hope that he can exert pres-
 sure on other satellite leaders
 to minimize any disruptive ef-
 fects of the Polish practices
 during the next few years, while
 Poland's deviation will in time
 diminish.   Khrushchev may ex-
 pect Gomulka to step up the tem-
 po of socialization in Poland,
 narrowing the differences between
 that country and the other Com-
 munist countries.
 On the other hand,  if the
 gulf between Poland and the re-
 mainder of the bloc continues to
 widen,  it may cause such difficul-
 ties that Khrushchev might de-
 cide the risks of forcing great-
 er conformity on Poland are not as
 dangerous as permitting Poland to25X1

 27 August 1959
 The Seventh World Youth
 Festival held in Vienna from
 26 July to 4 August--the first
 one outside the bloc--appar-
 ently fell far short of Commu-
 nist expectations,  and its
 failure to realize objectives
 can be regarded as a major prop-
 aganda setback for the bloc.   In
 holding the meeting in Austria,
 the USSR hoped to demonstrate
 that it was not a Communist-
 dominated front and to further
 the bloc's posture as advocate
 of peaceful coexistence,  par-
 ticularly among delegates from
 underdeveloped areas.
 The festival had a moder-
 ately successful beginning,  but
 a series of unpleasant develop-
 ments,  outbreaks of physical
 violence,  well-organized anti-
 festival activities,                       and an ap-
 parent miscalculation by the
 planners regarding anti-Commu-
 nist feelings caused the atmos-
 phere to degenerate until the
 close,  which was marked by dis-
 illusionment for many.   The
 brutal and violent tactics em-
 ployed by local Communist "goon
 squads" and bloc security of-
 ficers against any antifestival
 demonstration,  =incipient hos-
 tility, and even anti-Communist
 sentiment did most to thwart the
 Communists'  objectives and dam-
 age their cause.
 The festival organizers
 seem to have miscalculated the
 nature of anti-Communist activ -
 it would appear that the festi-
 val authorities were prepared
 to put down hostile demonstra-
 tions and physical violence;
 they were not prepared,  how-
 ever,  for the large,  well-or-
 ganized,  and effectively ex-
 ecuted counterpropaganda cam-
 paign of the anti-Communist
 elements.   They apparently real-
 ized their error too late to de-
 vise effective countermeasures.
 Handicaps
 Bloc efforts to ensure that
 the event would live up to its
 advance notices were hindered
 by the absence of a favorable
 atmosphere such as prevailed at
 the previous festival held in
 Moscow in 1957.   The Communists
 could not control either the
 apathy  of the Austrian people
 or the antipathy   of Austrian
 youth groups,  who not only re-
 fused to participate but set up
 counterattractions throughout
 the city.   An anti-Communist
 daily newspaper was published
 in seven languages and distributed
 to the delegates.   There was
 strong opposition from the Aus-
 trian church, and the boycott of
 festival news by the non-Commu-
 nist Austrian press minimized
 popular interest and limited
 local attendance at cultural
 events.
 On the surface,  Austrian
 officials displayed a relatively
 "correct" approach:          they were
 generally cooperative; pro-
 ,vided facilities;  attempted to
 discourage the more provocative
 antifestival activities; af-
 :Eorded excellent police pro-
 tection;  and,  at the last mo-
 ment,  sent a top.-ranking civil
 servant to represent the gov-
 ernment at the opening cer-
 emonies.
 Many antifestival activ-
 ities of the Austrian youth
 organizations,  however,  were
 both actively and tacitly sup-
 ported by local officialdom;
 considerable problems for the
 festival organizers also devel-
 oped because of lack of organ-
 ization,  inefficient adminis-
 trative arrangements  and Aus-
 trian lethargy.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 August 1959
 Heavy rains, mediocre to
 poor housing--some in remote
 areas--bad food, and transpor-
 tation difficulties (despite
 an influx of bloc buses) dis-
 comfited the delegates.   With
 few exceptions, the events
 were neither well nor enthu-
 siastically attended.      Activ-
 ities were decentralized, and
 on only three occasions were
 mass rallies held.   Some sem-
 inars were effectively dis-
 rupted by anti-Communists who
 insisted on presenting non-
 Communist points of view. The
 interplay of pro- and antifesti-
 val elements was an underlying
 current.
 Bloc Protective Measures
 To minimize the dangers
 of exposure to Western influ-
 ences, bloc delegations were
 made up of hand-picked, loyal
 Communists, cultural perform-
 ers, and athletes.   Contrary to
 figures in the Western press,
 there are reports--still uncon-
 firmed--of only three defec-
 tions among bloc delegates.
 Bloc delegates were isolated
 from other festival partici-
 pants--billeted in Soviet in-
 stallations in restricted and
 distant areas, including house-
 boats on the Danube,  and trans-
 ported to and from events in
 bloc buses.   They discussed sub-
 jects and answered questions
 with an inflexible Communist
 line.
 Polish delegates were the
 freest in discussions with
 Westerners, Rumanians the most
 carefully controlled, and Chinese
 Communists the most ideologi-
 cally hidebound.   The well-
 disciplined Czechs often  o-
 liced festival functions.?
 The true nature of the
 festival became clear to many
 of the delegates early, when
 initial attempts at free dis-
 cussion and expression of ideas
 met with strong ideological re-
 sponses or complete silence.
 African-Asian delegates at a
 special gathering on the sec-
 ond day of the festival were
 emphatically told by the Chi-
 nese Communists that Tibet
 was "an internal matter" and
 would not be discussed.
 The split among the ap-
 proximately 350 American del-
 egates was a large factor in
 setting the tone.  The non-
 Communist majority--denied
 recognition in favor of the pro-
 Communist faction--publicized
 the "rigged" leadership of the
 US delegation and used the is-
 sue to point up the undemocratic
 direction of the festival.
 Moscow radio gave consider-
 ably less propaganda attention
 to the Vienna festival than to
 the 1957 event--790 items com-
 pared with 3,048.   A sizable
 proportion of broadcasts to
 'Western Europe concentrated on
 rebutting Western "slanders"
 against the festival.   Early
 propaganda charged that "reac-
 tionaries" had tried to make
 the festival impossible through
 pressures on the Austrian Gov-
 ernment; later broadcasts, how-
 ever, placed primary blame for
 "obstructionist" tactics on the
 United States and West Germany,
 accusing them of financing the
 "wrecking activities," includ-
 ing the use of "antifestival
 publications" and "paid agents."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 August 1959
 Evaluation
 The communiqu6 at the
 close of the festival claimed
 18,000 participants from 112
 countries; Western sources es-
 timated a total of about 14,000
 delegates. Some nations--includ-
 ing Ghana, the UAR, Burma, Sudan,
 the Philippines, and Thailand--
 banned participation, and a
 number of others took steps to
 prevent attendance. The image
 of the festival as depicted by
 the free-world press was one of
 dissension, conflict, and vio-
 lence, and the festival's repu-
 tation certainly suffered from
 this publicity.
 the organizing cam=   ee
 was "horribly chastised" by
 Soviet officials and told that
 the festival was "not half as
 successful as expected."   The
 committee was criticized for
 being too defensive against
 Western measures and repri-
 manded for having lost control
 of festival participants--al-
 lowing them to roam over the
 city, to engage in discussions,
 and to be provoked by Western
 reactionaries who were not
 "exposed or attacked with suf-
 ficient vehemence."
 The bloc has already be-
 gun its effort to offset the
 unfavorable publicity by ex-
 aggerated and distorted praise
 for the festival.   The Soviet
 press widely publicized the
 5 August communiqu6 which pro-
 claimed the "success" of the
 meeting, made possible by the
 "profound belief in progress,
 freedom, and peace among na-
 tions" brought to Vienna by
 "millions of young people
 throughout the world." Pravda
 on 6 August set the propaganda
 stage by stating that the fes-
 tival demonstrated the unity
 and solidarity of the youths
 of all continents,  "in spite
 of the efforts of international
 reaction to hinder it."
 The head of the Hungarian
 delegation, in a speech on his
 return to Budapest, proclaimed
 the meeting "a complete suc-
 cess, exceeding all expecta-
 tions."  He admitted that the
 "difficulties of a political
 nature were many times greater
 than financial obstacles;' but
 asserted that they "did not ham-
 per or even reduce the world-
 wide success of the festival."
 He stated that the "hackneyed
 and discredited propaganda
 slogans of the other side" had
 failed, and that "the accusa-
 tion that the festival is an
 exclusive Communist affair only
 to carry out propaganda" had
 "collapsed irrevocably" before
 the display of peace and friend-
 ship.
 It is unlikely that the
 festival will again be held in
 a Western European city. Since
 a return to a bloc location
 would generally be regarded in
 the free world as a retreat, the
 Communists may seek a neutral
 Asian cite. The Preparatory Com-
 mittee reportedly hopes to hold   25X1
 the next festival in Colombo,
 Ceylon, which had offers  to be
 host for the 1959 event.

 Afghanistan is becoming
 increasingly dependent on the
 USSR for spare parts for  its
 weapons as it modernizes its
 army and air force.   The USSR
 now accounts for over 40 per-
 cent of the country's foreign
 trade, and the Afghans would
 find it costly to shift their
 markets in a short time should
 they be threatened by a less
 friendly Soviet trade policy.
 Soviet projects are implemented,
 as well as by the favorable terms
 offered by the USSR.   In addi-
 tion,   the  Afghan Government
 seems to feel it can safely ac-
 cept a large increase in Soviet
 assistance without endangering
 its own control of the country,
 since there has been no apparent
 effort by Soviet technicians
 to propagandize or engage  in
 subversion.

 the comparatively slight show
 of high-level official  US in-
 terest in Afghanistan as com-
 pared with the frequent and ex-
 tensive displays of interest by
 Moscow.   Since the visit by
 Bulganin and Khrushchev to Ka-
 bul in December 1955, there have
 been frequent exchanges of cul-
 tural delegations and high-level
 visits, featuring lavish red-
 carpet receptions in the USSR
 for the Afghan King and a num-
 ber of his ministers.
 Present Position
 The Afghans have reacted
 toward what they consider the
 hardened attitude of the Paki-
 stani military regime and the
 cooling interest of the West by
 stepping up their propaganda
 against Karachi's "oppression"
 of Pushtu tribesmen living in
 Pakistan and by an occasional
 commentary critical of the United
 States.   Most recently, Kabul'-s
 propaganda has even claimed that
 US-Pakistani defense agreements
 are intended to convert Paki-
 stan's Pushtu region into   an
 American military base.
 On the other hand, Afghani-
 stan's leaders have in the past
 clearly shown they are aware that
 Soviet friendship is motivated
 by world-wide aggressive ambi-
 tions.   They probably believe
 the controls of their own police
 state will provide protection
 against any attempts at subver-
 sion.   They probably also hope
 that Moscow's goals will fall

 redress the local balance of
 power.
 Subsequently,  there have
 been complaints in Kabul that
 the United States is not genu-
 inely interested in helping Af-
 ghan economic development and
 that it is deliberately employ-
 ing a "go-slow" policy in im-
 plementing its assistance proj-
 ects in Afghanistan.
 Daud and his colleagues
 probably also see as an indica-
 tion of American indifference
 the comparatively slight show
 of high-level official  US in-
 terest in Afghanistan as com-
 pared with the frequent and ex-
 tensive displays of interest by
 Moscow.   Since the visit by
 Bulganin and Khrushchev to Ka-
 bul in December 1955, there have
 been frequent exchanges of cul-
 tural delegations and high-level
 visits,  featuring lavish red-
 carpet receptions in the USSR
 for the Afghan King and a num-
 ber of his ministers.
 The Afghans have reacted
 toward what they consider the
 hardened attitude of the Paki-
 stani military regime and the
 cooling interest of the West by
 stepping up their propaganda
 against Karachi's "oppression"
 of Pushtu tribesmen living in
 Pakistan and by an occasional
 commentary critical of the United
 States.   Most recently, Kabul's
 propaganda has even claimed that
 US-Pakistani defense agreements
 are intended to convert Paki-
 stan's Pushtu region into   an
 American military base.
 On the other hand,  Afghani-
 stan's leaders have in the past
 clearly shown they are aware that
 Soviet friendship is motivated
 by world-wide aggressive ambi-
 tions.   They probably believe
 the controls of their own police
 state will provide protection
 against any attempts at subver-
 sion.   They probably also hope
 that Moscow's goals will fall

 short of making Afghanistan a
 Soviet satellite and   remain
 limited to keeping Western in-
 fluence in Afghanistan to a
 minimum.   Although the Afghans
 are still sensitive to infringe-
 ments on their independence,
 they may find that the sheer
 magnitude of their  growing
 ties with the USSR  will  make
 it  increasingly  difficult to
 set   national   policy  with-
 out reference to Soviet wishes.
