 THE "SOCIALIST COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS":
 1.     The crisis which shook International Communism
 in 1956 - from the "secret" speech of Khrushchev denouncing
 Stalin to the bloody suppression of the Hungarian revolt - was
 met by the Communist leaders with a concerted drive for sta-
 bilization within the movement. 1  Two great Moscow conclaves
 have marked the successive advances and triumphs of this cam-
 paign:  the Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties
 assembled in celebration of the Fortieth. Anniversary of the
 October Revolution (November 1957), and the XXI Congress
 of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (January-February
 1959). Although the Congress was signalized primarily by the
 emergence of a new "personality cult" - that of Nikita Khrush-
 chev - by the glorification of the new Seven Year Plan, and by
 the formulation of the "transition from socialism to commu-
 nism, " it was also the occasion for reaffirming the monolithic
 unity of International Communism and projecting the future
 pattern of governance of the "world socialist system. "
 2.     The emergence of this "system., " according to
 Communist statements, is a direct result of World War II; it
 is held to have brought about a. "decisive shift" in the world
 balance of power.  Prior to the War, there had been only one
 Communist state, the USSR, and International Communism
 consisted not of a system of states, but of a world-wide array
 of subservient parties, some operating legally, others clan-
 destinely, under the general control of the Soviet-dominated

 of Crisis and Stabilization (16 September 1957).

 Comintern.  The dissolution of the Comintern in 1943 was
 primarily a gesture to mollify the Soviet Union's wartime
 allies; it was also the recognition that post-war Communism
 would require a new form of direction, not yet clear in outline.
 3. Indeed,, the prospects confronting Stalin in the
 first post-war years may well have surpassed his earlier
 dreams.  Whereas during the previous fifteen ;years he had
 been engrossed in "building socialism in one country, " he
 was note about to extend his writ over the expanded empire
 of the European satellites in which, under the guise of "peoples'
 democracies, " Communist governments were coming to power
 in rapid succession.  China, sweeping toward conquest of the
 mainland, and already casting its shadow over the future Asiatic
 satellites - North Korea and North Vietnam - would soon be
 pressing for a share in the control of the Bloc.
 4.     To cope with the expansion of the "socialist
 system, " a successor to the Comintern was devised, the
 Cominform (1947) which disseminated the directives of the
 Kremlin through the more restricted medium of an authori-
 tative Journal, "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Demqc-
 racy. " But, in a shorter space of time than its predecessor,
 the Cominform outlived its usefulness and was dissolved (1956)
 both as a concession to its critics and as a measure of prepa-
 ration for a new dis:pensation.
 5.     The past two years may be regarded as a sort
 of interregnum.  The classic links and phannels of the move-
 ment - embassies, Communist parties, front organizations
 and cultural or economic missions - have been reinfbrced
 by the extensive use of bilateral and multilateral party meet-
 ings, highlighted by dramatic Communist "summit" conferences.
 But a formal governing entity has not emerged.
 6.    In the :Light of the most recent development it has
 become increasingly apparent that the leaders of the movement

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 are seeking a new and more effective mechanism for main-
 taining unity and control.  After the 1956 upheavals, the
 Kremlin appeared for a time to favor the establishment of a
 Comintern-type of organization, or at least a modified Corn-
 inform, but this met with considerable opposition, especially
 among Communist leaders outside the Bloc.  It would seem
 that Moscow, acknowledging the validity of these objections,
 has cast about for some new form of association which would
 emphasize the "sovereign" and "independent" nature of the
 participant states.
 7.     In pursuit of this objective, the Kremlin has
 given currency to a relatively new term, the Commonwealth
 of Socialist Nations - sodruzhestvo sotsialisticheskikh stran -
 or states - gosudarstv.  The term sodruzhestvo is derived
 from a-Stalinist usage limited in application to the USSR; its
 extension to the international sphere dates from the end of
 1955, and its official propagation from the height of the 1956
 crisis.  The concept has been elaborated with a degree of
 subtlety and circumspection which has resulted in its being
 generally ignored or overlooked in the Free World.  And yet,
 it appears to contain the germ of an institutional form within
 which the Marxist-Leninist imperiurn may move toward the
 goal of the "world socialist system, " a nascent Communist
 "United Nations" as the organizational framework for the
 "transition from socialism to Communism. "
 8.     This essay is a contribution to the historical,
 semantic, organizational and ideological study of the Social-
 ist Commonwealth.   In our judgment, this analysis justifies
 the speculative conclusion that the Soviet Union, and possibly
 Communist China, may in the not too distant future utilize
 this concept to establish some form of federative union with
 their satellites which would pose questions of vital signifi-
 cance to the security of the United States and the Free World.

 9.     The idea of an international revolutionary asso-
 ciation is not an exclusive property of the Communists.  Even
 before the unrest of 1848, French, Italian and German groups,
 led by Blanqui, Mazzini and Marx-Engels respectively, at-
 tempted to create a revolutionary International.  It was not,
 however, until 1864: that the International Working Men's
 Association was founded under the organizational direction
 and theoretical guidance of Marx and Engels and with the sup-
 port of British trade unions.  This, the First International,
 was destined to last only eight years and to achieve nothing
 beyond creating a historic precedent.  A split between Marx-
 ists and the Bakuninists (Anarchists) proved disastrous, al-
 though the Bakuninist faction showed remarkable stamina,
 collapsing only at the end of the Spanish Civil War (1939).
 10.   Established in Paris in 1889, the Second "Social-
 ist" International adopted what amounted to the "national roads
 to socialism" principle.  It was both a representative organi-
 zation of the ever stronger trade unions and a debating asso-,
 ciationfor orthodox Marxists (Bebel), revisionists (Bernstein),
 and extreme leftists (Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg).  As the
 events of the Paris Commune (1871) had led to the undoing of
 the First International, so World War I contributed to the de-
 cline of the Second :[nternational.  For most Socialists the
 call of national patriotism triumphed over international solidar-
 ity, though many condemned and opposed the war.                                In the 1920
 Vienna Congress a split occurred between the patriots and the
 pacifists.  The former reconstituted the International, the lat-
 ter established a competing organization.  In spite of the Com-
 intern's divisive tactics, the two factions merged in 1923, but

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 the Second International was already in a decline.  Breaking
 down entirely during World War II it was gradually restored
 after 1946.  In 1947 a Committee of the International Social-
 ist Conference (Comisco) was set up in England, consisting
 of one representative of each member party.  In 1951, the
 Socialist International itself was reconstituted in Frankfurt,
 Germany.    Its program was "democratic socialism. " In
 1953 the Asian Socialist Conference was established in Ran-
 goon, following the model of Comisco.
 The Third International, (Comintern)
 11.   The Third Communist International (Comintern),
 which had been advocated by Lenin as early as 1914, was
 founded in Moscow in 1919.  Since, at the time of its estab-
 lishment, the Socialist parties eligible to participate were
 all but bankrupt throughout Europe, the Russian section of
 the Comintern became dominant at the outset.  The "twenty-
 one conditions" of membership, outlining radical Leninist
 tactics, were laid down and a frontal assault against the Vienna
 International was begun.  Since the Comintern 'a original impact
 had greatly diminished by 1922, United Front tactics, aimed at
 absorbing the Socialists, were initiated by the Communists.
 From Lenin's incapacitation to Stalin's consolidation of power -
 roughly 1922 to 1928 - internecine struggles within the Russian
 factions and among Russian and non-Russian Communists all
 but crippled the Comintern.  The struggle between Stalin and
 the Trotsky-Zinoviev "left wing, " which had dominated the
 Moscow World Congress in 1924, led to the victory of the former
 and the ouster of the "left wings" in all Communist parties as
 "Trotskyite. " From then on, the Comintern's development
 followed Stalinist lines until its dissolution in 1943.
 12.   As noted above, the dissolution of the Comintern
 cost the Kremlin little and paid handsomely in terms of world
 propaganda at a critical stage of World War II.  The explana-
 tion of the Comintern Presidium that "the organizational form"

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 of the Comintern had "more and more become outgrown by
 the movement's development and by the increasing complex-
 ity of its problem in various countries" was euphemistic but
 basically true.  Interparty communications were dislocated.
 Resistance to Comintern policies outside the USSR and Soviet
 occupied territory could not be dealt with effectively.  More-
 over, the Bolsheviks probably had not expected the non-Soviet
 Communist parties to emerge from the war with unimpaired
 strength, and may have felt that in the immediate post-war
 period World Communism could be ruled from Moscow with-
 out formal organization.  From the Western point of view,
 the dissolution of the Comintern promised an end to the two
 pronged Soviet offensive - governmental and party - and ap-
 peared to the unwary to indicate that the Kremlin was no
 longer planning world revolution.  This of course was far
 from being the case.
 13.   Indeed, the prospects for the expansion of the
 Communist imperium which the Kremlin faced in 1945 pre-
 sented both a challenge and a. new set of organizational prob-
 lems.  Whereas in the past the Soviet Communist Party had
 been the only party governing a national state, Communist
 parties in Eastern Europe were put in charge by the USSR
 and were given, at least to some degree, the responsibili-
 ties                          of government.  In Western Europe, the French and
 Italian Communist parties had emerged from the war with
 a mass following and an acceptance by the voters so wide
 that their taking over authority was not inconceivable; they
 remained formidable even after their chance of staging a
 successful revolution had passed.  On the China mainland,
 the Communists were rapidly coming to power through mili-
 tary victory.  In short, the prospect of a Communist empire
 stretching from the Atlantic across Eurasia to the Pacific
 was bright, yet no adequate organizational provisions for
 central control of a monolithic Communist bloc had been
 made.

 14.   The problem of directing Communist activity
 from Moscow was not serious in the countries under Soviet
 military occupation.  Behind the lowered Iron Curtain, the
 Kremlin proceeded to apply the rules of the book, and before
 long the local Communists became effective instruments of
 Soviet rule.
 15.   As this process advanced, Stalin decided to
 establish a new international organization to further the con-
 solidation of World Communism.  As charter members along
 ,Ninth the East European satellites, he included the French and
 Italian parties, unquestionably in deference to their potential-
 ities for advancing the Communist cause in Europe.  Estab-
 lished in 1947 under Zhdanov's leadership, the Communist
 Information Bureau (Cominform) initiated a new phase of
 aggressive revolutionary actions, notably the Czech coup
 (February 1948) and the wave of political strikes in France.
 The initial activities of the Cominform quickly disabused
 those who might have regarded the Comintern's dissolution
 as signalling the end of the world revolutionary drive of
 International Communism.
 16.   Yet the Cominform as an instrument for strength-
 ening and guiding the Soviet empire had a short life.  After the
 expulsion of Yugoslavia following the break between Stalin and
 Tito in 1948, the Cominform subsided into a device for trans-
 mitting Communist propaganda directives.  The strategy and
 tactics of International Communism remained under the direct
 control of the Kremlin, which utilized the customary channels
 of instruction and supervision.  In April 1956, the Cominform
 was officially dissolved.  Its demise may be attributed in part
 to the desire of the post-Stalin Soviet leaders both to heal the
 rift in the Communist camp caused by Tito's deviation and to

 please certain neutralists such as Nehru and U Nu.  Moscow
 probably also recognized that the Cominform had become a
 rump organization, lacking the potentiality of exploiting the
 opportunities for Communist proselyting among the uncom-
 mitted countries.  An ostensible reason for the dissolution
 was provided by the policy, set forth at the XX CPSU Con-
 gress (February 1956), of permitting "national roads to
 socialism. 11
 17.   The Comintern and the Cominform - each in its
 time and within the context of existing conditions - had been
 fully exploited by the Kremlin.  When their usefulness had
 dwindled, they were liquidated.  However, this did not imply
 a belief that International Communism could dispense with a
 mechanism for international control.  The question was only
 what type of organization would be most suitable.

 III.     PROSPECTS FOR NEW COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONS
 18.   We may assume that the Soviet leaders have
 seriously considered the establishment of a new organization
 along Comintern lines.  It would conform to their classic
 pattern of control and might perpetuate the dominance of the
 CPSU in the movement.  Yet, there is evidence that realistic
 considerations have led to the adoption of a more cautious and
 tentative course.   Since the primary effort of 1957 and 1958
 was toward stabilization of the international movement, any
 attempt to reimpose an institution which had been associated
 with Stalinist dictation would be certain to create new diffi-
 culties and perhaps even upheavals.
 19.   A number of major parties were clearly opposed
 to a revived Comintern or Cominform.  China, which had been
 accorded a sort of co-equality with the USSR as early as Feb-
 ruary 1955 would probably not have joined any new organiza-
 tion which implied Soviet hegemony, and this would have elim-
 inated the Far Eastern satellites as well.  Yugoslavia obvious-
 ly could not be persuaded to participate. Poland was intent on
 pursuing its own "road to socialism. " Outside the Bloc, Togli-
 atti, who had been shaken by Khrushchev's revelation of Stalin's
 crimes and who had played with the idea of "polycentrism, "
 was clearly unenthusiastic over the prospect that ('foreign"
 - specifically, Moscow - direction would complicate his task
 of maintaining the PCI as the leading :mass party in the Free
 World. 1  On the other hand, there were Communist leaders
 1
 In an interesting description of the session of the Comintern
 Presidium at which Stalin dictated the dissolution of the body,
 Veljko Vlakhovitch, a Yugoslav Communist, states that Togli-
 atti had already raised the idea of "polycentrism, " i. e. region-
 al cooperation of parties in similar situations, such as the
 French, Spanish and Italian, the Scandinavian, or the Central
 European Communist Parties.  Kommunist (Belgrade, 20 April
 1959) quoted in BEIPI (1630 May 1959), p.8.

 who reportedly advocated the creation of a new world organ-
 ization, notably Ulbricht (East Germany), Novotny (Czecho-
 slovakia) and Hoxha (Albania).  The French Communists,
 under their Stalinist leader Thorez, and the Spanish Commu-
 nists in exile, were also in favor of tighter central direction.
 Some of the minor parties, such as the Dutch and the Danish,
 suffered factional splits over the issue of Moscow control.
 20.   Possible international repercussions outside the
 Communist Parties may also have weighed in the decision not
 to create a new organization at this time.  Any reinstitution
 of a Comintern, or even of a Cominform, dominated by the
 USSR, would imply a reaffirmation of the immutable objective
 of world revolution, arousing thereby the suspicions and fears
 of the highly nationalistic "uncommitted" nations and defeat-
 ing the theme of "relaxation of tensions" and progress toward
 the "summit. " Soviet foreign policy objectives would be bet-
 ter served by prospective successes in the political, economic
 and technological fields.  These could be counted on to provide
 a telling admonition to wavering Communists to hew to the line
 if they wished to participate in the fruits of victory.  The appeal
 of "different roads to socialism" to fellow travelers and to
 leftist-oriented governments outside the Bloc was not to be
 sacrificed out of hand.
 21.   It must have appeared to the Soviet leaders,
 moreover, that a potential lay before them, broader and
 more alluring than, any accession of power which a reversion
 to Stalinist methods could attain.  With the Sino-Soviet Bloc
 now comprising nearly a third of the earth's population, and
 dominating most of the Eurasian land mass, the geopolitical
 factors were auspicious.  A new confidence infused both the
 Soviet and the Chinese leadership.   The problem was to estab-
 lish a conceptual framework sufficiently vast and flexible to
 contain the organizational structure within which World Com-
 munism could be achieved.  It is apparently with this vision
 in mind that the Soviet leaders and theorists have gradually
 unfolded the idea of a Commonwealth of Socialist Nations.

 IV.     THE CONCEPT OF SODRUZHESTVO
 22.   The concept of sodruzhestvo requires careful
 historical and semantic analysis.  Soviet theorists do not use
 words casually, especially when they indicate trends or inten-
 tions.                   An attempt will be made to demonstrate in detail that
 this...term is pregnant with ideological and political content,
 even though its organizational form is as yet imperfectly
 delineated.
 23.   The word itself is of relatively recent origin
 and has been derived as a perfective form druzhestvo from
 druzhba - friendship.   The prefix so denotes association.
 The compound, therefore, indicates association in friend-
 ship.                   As such, the word sodruzhestvo is quite different
 from the English term commonwealth, which implies a com-
 monalty of welfare.  Nevertheless, the latter is the official
 communist translation of the former, and, for the purpose
 of our analysis, will be treated as its equivalent. 1
 24.   It is of some interest to note that Soviet political
 glossaries, dictionaries and encyclopedias.:; until quite recent-
 ly have not introduced the term in its broad connotation.  Thus
 in Ushakov's dictionary of 1940 sodruzhestvo is defined as
 "friendship" of the "socialist nations. "   There is no refer-
 ence to the British Commonwealth of Nations.  On the other
 hand, Smirnitsky's dictionary, while following Ushakov's
 interpretation of "collaboration, cooperation, friendship of
 socialist nations" also defines the British.Commonwealth3
 as a sodruzhestvo.  The second edition of the Great Soviet
 IIn non-Communist translations, sodruzhestvo is sometimes
 incorrectly rendered as community, family, etc.

 Encyclopedia uses the word druzhba to describe the "fraternal
 collaboration, political, economic, cultural and military
 mutual assistance of peoples of the USSR, enjoying equal
 rights and voluntarily;'associated into a single socialist state.
 In general, Soviet writers avoid referring to the British Com-
 monwealth as a sodruzhestvo and prefer to call it the "British
 Empire. "
 25.   The word sodruzhestvo as an extension of druzhba
 appears to have been given some currency by Stalin during
 World War II.  Subsequently its use was further generalized
 and extended, initially, however, only with reference to the
 USSR as a "sodruzhestvo (friendship) of Socialist peoples. "
 26.   The broader application of the term to include
 all socialist countries appears to date from the post-Stalin
 period.  In this connection it is important to note that its
 primary application, at least initially, was to the associa-
 tion of nations (natsii), countries (strany), or people (narody),
 rather than of governments or states (gosudarstva).  In no
 case is it applicable to "capitalist" nations or states, whose
 collaboration is usually described in negative terms as mil-
 itary blocs or as agreement for the exploitation of backward
 countries.
 27.   One may recall that Communists - including
 Trotskyites and Titoists, as well as orthodox Leninists
 have generally accepted Stalin's definition of a nation as
 a historically constituted, stable community of
 a people, formed on the basis of the common posses-
 sion of four principal characteristics, namely:  a
 common language, a common territory, a common

 economic life and a common psychological make-up
 manifested in common specific features of national
 culture. I
 28.   Pursuing the terminological analysis somewhat
 deeper, we may recall that Stalin, developing and supplement-
 ing Lenin's doctrine, introduced the subdivisions of F1capitalist"
 and "socialist" nations.  The latter are "nations of a new type,
 of which the Soviet Union is the "fatherland. "  They arose "on
 the basis of the old capitalist nations by a process of basic
 transformation. " This process has created the "peoples' democ-
 racies" of Europe and Asia, each of which follows a course of
 development peculiar to its concrete historical, social and politi-
 cal conditions.  It has been elaborated by Communist literature
 with a wealth of reference material.
 29.   The ideological root of the sodruzhestvo concept
 is Marxist-Leninist "proletarian internationalism, 11 which com-
 bats "bourgeois nationalism" and aims at its overthrow through-
 out the world.   The unfolding of the concept may be traced through
 three major historical stages:
 a.  The revolutionary stage (1917-22), character-
 ized by the destruction of the former capitalist-imperial-
 ist state of Czarist Russia and launching the slogan of the
 "right of nations to self-determination. "  This was the
 period of constructing a transitory internal federation
 based on the unity of the proletariat under the leader-
 ship of its vanguard, the Communist party, and the prep-
 aration for the emergence of a united socialist state. The
 First Congrers:s of the Soviets of the Union, on 30 Decem-
 ber 1922, declared:
 1 "The National Question and Leninism, " Works, II, 348.  Of
 course, Stalin's definition is not in conflict withtthat which
 has been generally accepted by Western political scientists.

 "The peoples of the Soviet Republics met recently in
 the congresses of their respective Soviets and unan-
 imously adopted resolutions to form a Union of Soviet
 Socialist Republics.  Their decision, as peoples exer-
 cising equal rights, is conclusive proof of the volun-
 tary nature of their unification.  The resolutions give
 every republic the right to secede from the Union, and
 allow all other Soviet Socialist Republics, both present
 and future, to join it if they choose.  The new Union
 state will be a worthy expression of the basic principles
 of peaceful coexistence and fraternal cooperation laid
 down in October 1917.  It will be a true bulwark against
 world capitalism, and a new and decisive step toward

 front, the Comintern continued to work in the interests
 of the CPSU, preparing the way for extension of the
 revolution within the capitalist system.

 V.      THE POST-STALIN DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA
 OF SODRUZHESTVO.
 30.   Stalin's contribution to the idea of a Socialist
 Commonwealth - a-s' we have noted above - appears to have
 been confined largely to the development of the Soviet 'Union
 as an association of co-friendship among its numerous nation-
 alities. 1  Nevertheless, he laid the groundwork for the inter-
 national extension of the concept, especially in his statements
 at the XIX CPSU Congress (1952) on the consequences of the
 existence of the two rival "world systems" - socialism and
 capitalism.
 31.   At the end of 1955 this broader concept was
 explicitly stated by the CPSU in connection with the castiga-
 tion of Molotov's ideological "error":
 The foreign. policy of the CPSU is based on Leninist
 principles - the struggle for peace and t# e peaceful
 coexistence of socialist and capitalist systems.  The
 policy is formulated with full consideration for the
 profound changes which have occurred as the result
 of the second World War and post-war developments
 and which are reflected in the deepening general
 crisis of capitalism, in the formation of the great
 commonwealth of socialist states, in the disintegra-
 tion of the colonial system and the powerful move-
 ment of the peoples for strengthening peace . . .
 The formation of a mighty commonwealth of socialist
 states represented a great, universally historical
 achievement of the peoples of these countries . . .

 The commonwealth of socialist states is the mighty
 bulwark of all laboring humanity.
 32.   The XX CPSU Congress, though it did not stress
 the term sodruzhestvo, contributed basic themes to the expan-
 sion of the "world socialist system. "  Strengthening "fraternal
 relations with the peoples democracies" would lead to the
 'Hevelopment and fortification of fraternal ties with the toilers
 of all countries. " Acknowledgment of "different roads to
 socialism, " which contributed so powerfully to the Polish and
 Hungarian crises, laid the basis for the theme of "unity in
 diversity, " which, with variations of emphasis - chiefly on
 unity - , has informed communist utterances ever since.
 33.   As the crisis over Stalin sharpened, and Com-
 munists throughout the world demanded a "Marxist explanation"
 of his crimes, the CPSU was forced to respond with an ideo-
 logical stopgap, the 30 June 1956 Resolution of the Central
 Committee. This Resolution reaffirmed the principal theses
 of the XX CPSU Congress, and specifically mentioned in the
 first sentence the sodruzhestvo.
 34.   The 30 October 1956 "Declaration of the Govern-
 ment of the USSR on the Basic Factors in the Development and
 Further Consolidation of Friendship and Cooperation among
 the Soviet Union and other Socialist States" - written in appar-
 ent haste to quiet the upheavals in Hungary and Poland
 presented the first official definition of sodruzhestvo:
 1
 Kommunist, No. 14 (October 1955), pp.4-7 (emphasis on
 commonwealth supplied here and in subsequent quotations).
 This is the same issue which contains Molotov's own recanta-
 tion of his "error" in not recognizing that the "building of
 socialism" had been completed in the USSR, the first step
 in his decline.

 United by the common ideal of building a socialist
 society and by the principles of proletarianism, the
 countries of the great commonwealth of socialist
 nations can build their relations only on the basis of
 complete equality, respect for territorial integrity,
 national independence and sovereignty and non-inter-
 ference in each other's internal affairs.  This does
 not preclude, but on the contrary, presupposes close
 fraternal cooperation and mutual understanding among
 the countries of the socialist commonwealth in the
 economic, political and cultural fields.
 35.   The next stage in the unfolding of the Common-
 wealth called for a statement, not merely of the CPSU, but
 of all Communist parties of the Bloc.  The occasion was pro-
 vided by the celebration of the Fortieth Anniversary of the
 Bolshevik Revolution (Moscow, November 1957).  The "Decla-
 ration of the Conference of the Reprefiantatives of Commu-,
 nist and Workers' Parties of the Socialist Countries" pro-
 claimed:
 The Socialist states are united into one sodruzhestvo,
 by having entered upon the common path to socialism,
 by a common class substance of their social and
 economic system and state authority, and by the need
 for mutual support and aid, by a community of inter-
 ests and objectives in the struggle against imperial-
 ism and for the victory of socialism and communism,
 and by a Marxist-Leninist ideology common to them
 all.
 36.   It is apparent that this Commonwealth now in-
 cludes the Peoples' Democracies and is no longer restricted
 to the one state which had completed the "building of social-
 ism, " the USSR.  All of these twelve states are governed by
 certain "common laws,  r'  which the Declaration spelled out

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 in classic Communist terms.  With this formal definition in
 solemn conclave, the Commonwealth may be said to have been
 officially launched, not as an institution with precise organiza-
 tional contours, but as a broad, vague concept susceptible of
 varying interpretation and emphasis.
 37.   During the first few months of 1958, there
 appears to have been relative silence on the sodruzhestvo in
 the press and official statements, but, since June of that
 year there has been a steady flow of utterances by authori-
 tative Soviet leaders and theorists.  A number of citations
 are presented in Annex I to establish the currency of the
 term and to illustrate its Protean aspects.
 38.   Inevitably, in the wake of such an authoritative
 statement as that of the November 1957 Declaration, the line
 of theory, agitation and propaganda has systematically eulo-
 gized the Commonwealth theme.  Numerous books and articles
 have appeared, amplifying and bringing the changes on the
 basic theme laid down by the 1957 Moscow Declaration.  A
 number of these are summarized or listed in Annex II.
 39.   It may be significant that several recent articles
 in Pravda have featured the word sodruzhestvo in the title,
 while using it scarcely or not at all in the text.  This is par-
 ticularly striking in the case of an article by A. Kosygin,
 Chief of Gosplan.  Although the title reads "The Great Com-
 monwealth of the Socialist Countries, " all references are to
 the "world socialist system" or the "camp" except for the
 last sentence which speaks of the "great sodruzhestvo of the
 socialist states (gosudarstv). 1   On the other hand, Y. Andro-
 pov in a discussion of the "Theoretical Problems  f the Con-
 struction of Communism" under the title "Development and

 Strengthening of the World Socialist System" describes the
 system as a commonwealth, using almost verbatim the lan-
 guage of the 1957 Moscow Declaration. 1
 40.   One of the most reliable indications of the weight
 attached to a term or concept is to be found in the slogans
 which appear in connection with the anniversary of the October
 Revolution and the May Day celebration.  Subtle, tactically
 significant variations of emphasis characterize these semi-
 annual exercises, and the use of sodruzhestvo is no excep-
 tion to the rule.  In Annex III there are listed the slogans
 since 1957 in which it is hailed.  The wording of the latest
 May Day slogan (No. 12) is as follows:
 Hail to the world socialist system, the indestructible
 bulwark of peace and the security of the peoples!
 May the great commonwealth of the countries 6f the
 socialist camp grow stronger and flourish!

 VI.     THE RELATIONSHIP OF "SYSTEM, " "CAMP, " AND
 'COMMONWEALTH"
 41.   It is apparent that the "world socialist system, "
 the "camp, "' and the sodruzhestvo are to a certain extent over-
 lapping or interchangeable terms.  T aey constitute a triad, a
 sort of unity in trinity, in which the specific differentiae are
 not always immediately clear.  Indeed, one is tempted to
 assume that in many cases the usage of an individual writer
 or speaker may be dictated by habit rather than by precise
 intention.
 42.   The close interrelation of the three terms can
 be illustrated from numerous recent theoretical writings.
 A single example will suffice:
 The transformation of socialism into a world system,
 the formation and consolidation of the great socialist
 camp, is the defining factor of the present-day stage
 of social relations . . . In this lies the source of
 strength and the inviolability of the socialist Com-
 monwealth.
 Nevertheless, the three terms have distinct connotations,
 which are carefully pondered in theoretical statements and
 in propaganda.
 43.   The "world socialist system" is variously des-
 cribed as "a fact, "" as an historic event of crucial importance,
 as the product of a transformation in which the first two or
 three post-war years were decisive.  In the broadest sense,

 of Peace and the Security of Peoples, " Pravda, 21 April
 1959.

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 it is perhaps best to view it as an ideological framework, the
 incorporation and consolidation of nations under the aegis of
 a "secular religion" which aspires to world totality.  As such,
 the term is charged with a sort of "mystique, " but it is not
 vested with a specific organizational form.
 44.   Similarly, the "socialist camp" is not conceived
 as a concrete organization.  Rather, as its origin in the Ger-
 man word Lager implies, it is an expression of militancy.
 One body of fighters faces another in hostile array.  The
 "socialist camp!' is portrayed both defensively and aggres-
 sively.                                   It is a monolithic unity of "peace-loving" peoples
 confronted by an implacable and aggressive adversary..
 Against the provocations and aggressions of the "imperialists,  "
 the "socialist camp" will deliver a "decisive rebuff. " It is
 within this concept that the communists have developed their
 now classic tactic of alternating military threats with blan-
 dishments and professions of "peaceful coexistence.
 45.   Unlike the other two, the sodruzhestvo contains
 an implicit principle of organizational unity, a nascent struc-
 tural concept.  Its usefulness is still being explored, its
 specific forms are being derived empirically, and its propa-
 gation is still tentative.
 46.   One may be tempted to evaluate the significance
 of these three concepts in terms of the relative frequency
 with which they are used.  On the basis of a statistical sam-
 ple of Soviet editorials, articles and speeches it is apparent
 that both the "system" and the "camp" predominate heavily ::
 over "commonwealth. " Nevertheless, the relative infrequency
 of the term sodruzhestvo does not indicate that it is less sig-
 nificant.  The fact, which we have noted above, that it is in.,
 creasingly featured in headlines or book titles,  even though
 its use in the text may be sparing, suggests that it is being

 47.   From the analysis and quotations already pre-
 sented, it is possible to sketch the broad outlines of the
 Socialist Commonwealth, as Soviet propagandists would have
 it apprehended.
 48.   The guiding ideological principle is,of course,
 ''proletarian internationalism, " first worked out by Marx and
 Engels, and "creatively" developed by Lenin.  Under this
 principle, there is no room for "bourgeois nationalism,  1'  the
 false patriotism instilled by capitalist exploiters into the
 working class of their countries.  Soviet propaganda extols
 the special form of "nationalism" which has been cultivated
 within the USSR, and which is held to be the prototype of the
 broader relationship that will one day flourish among all
 countries.  Thus Khrushchev, in his keynote speech at the
 XXI CPSU Congress, declared:
 The Soviet Union is a multinational socialist state
 based on the friendship of equal peoples united by a
 single will . . . The commonwealth of socialist
 nations is the source of the growth of strength and
 might of the multinational socialist state.
 The Uzbek Mukhiditnov - the Presidium's expert on national
 minorities - in his 30 January speech at the Congress echoed
 the theme-,
 In a multinational country like ours, one of the most
 important conditions for successful struggle for the
 victory of communism is the consistent pursuit of an
 internationalist national policy . . . In our country
 national relations have been harmoniously developing
 on the basis of the principles of the great common-
 wealth of all nations, the inviolable foundation of the
 Soviet state.

 49.   Soviet doctrinal writings on the Commonwealth
 rely heavily on the so-called Pancha--Shila or Five Points of
 the Bandung Conference (1955).  The relations of the states
 in the sodruzhestvo are based on "equality, respect for ter-
 ritorial integrity, political independence and sovereignty and
 non-intervention in each other's affairs. "1 In the atmosphere
 of "peaceful coexistence, " all countries, big and small, are
 equal, regardless of their advance or backwardness on the
 road to socialism.  No country enjoys any special privileges.
 The concern of all. is with fraternal cooperation and mutual
 assistance.
 50.   Soviet propagandists of course cannot refrain
 from stressing the leading role of the USSR, its wealth of
 revolutionary experience, and its "great ideological strength"
 as the "guard and citidel of the liberation movement through-
 out the world. "  This theme is interwoven with praise of
 Soviet economic power, second only to that of the United
 States, which enables the USSR to set aside "substantial re-
 sources for the allocation of the aid which the Socialist coun-
 tries need, without pursuing commercial self-interest. "
 51.   But the theme of Soviet pre-eminence, which is
 strong in discussions of the "camp" is relatively muted in the
 Commonwealth.  Rather, the emphasis is on the bonds of
 Marxist-Leninist ideology which tie together the aspiring
 peoples of socialism in their striving to create a "glorious
 future for mankind. " In this sense, sodruzhestvo is pre-
 sented as the embodiment of humanity's fondest dreams.

 VIII.    CURRENT FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST
 ORGANIZATION
 52.   Having presented evidence that the concept of
 sodruzhestvo is being consciously developed by the Commu-
 nist leaders as a matrix for the international organization
 of the "world socialist system, " we shall now discuss the
 principal concrete forms which have been utilized so far,
 and then endeavor to project them into the future.  It is
 understood that both party and government institutional
 forms are under discussion; these may merge, overlap and
 diverge according to the situation.  The important role which
 China plays in manipulating these organizational develop-
 ments must also be considered.
 53.   Three principal topics will be analyzed:  (a)
 The use of the system of bilateral and multilateral confer-
 ences; (b) The creation of an international journal; (c) Adap-
 tation of existing Bloc institutions - the Council of Economic
 Mutual Assistance (CEMA) and the Warsaw Pact.
 A.       The Conference System
 54.   The 30 October 1956 Declaration, as observed
 above, marked the first official proclamation by the CPSU
 of the sodruzhestvo concept, and at the same time it may be
 said to have constituted the first step in the campaign to
 stabilize the International Communist Movement after the
 disturbance created by de-Stalinization and the upheavals in
 Poland and Hungary.  The Declaration was also a concession
 to the pressure for more nearly equal treatment of the in-
 dividual states and Communist parties of the Bloc.
 55.   During the year which followed the Declara-
 tion, more than one hundred and fifty bilateral and multi-
 lateral conferences were held, for the most part in capitals
 of the Bloc.   Many of these were attended by representatives
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 of Free World Communist parties, who in turn. passed on
 the line to other parties outside the Bloc.
 56.   The effectiveness of this series of conferences
 soon became apparent.  In monotonous succession they pro-
 duced declarations of "identity of views  on the Hungarian
 "counter-revolution, " on the need for loyal cooperation with
 the CPSU and other parties, and on the insidious dangers of
 Titoism and "revisionism" in general. The ideological and
 organizational campaign was intensified, spurred on by
 promises of economic assistance to the sometimes hard-
 pressed satellite regimes.
 57.   With the growing manifestation of cohesion and
 solidarity in the parties and front organizations, the ques-
 tion of a central Comintern type of organization was thor-
 oughly canvassed., and, as noted above, at least temporarily
 set aside.  The Moscow Conference of Communist and Work-
 ers' Parties of November 1957, reportedly decided that the
 system of bilateral, multilateral and "plenary" conferences
 was sufficient to insure coordination. 1  This decision was
 duly reflected in subsequent theoretical utterances:
 It is natural that the Communist and Workers' Parties
 in the socialist camp deem it their duty to formulate
 a single point of view on the most important problems
 of socialist construction and on the struggle for peace.
 They are unanimous in believing that, in line with bi-
 lateral meetings of leaders and the exchange of in-
 Cf. V. M. Churayev, On Party Unity (Moscow, 1958):  The
 participants in the Moscow Conference "exchanging opinions,
 decided that there! is no current need for creating any kind
 of international body of communism like the past Comintern
 or Cominform" (emphasis supplied).

 formation, it is expedient as far as possible, to
 conduct even more extensive conferences of Com-
 munist and Workers' Parties to deliberate on actual
 problems, to exchange experiences and to coordin-
 ate action in the joint struggle for peace, democ-
 racy and socialism. 1
 B.      The Creation of an International Journal
 58.   Although the establishment of a new Comintern.
 or  Cominform was deemed inadvisable, a decision was made,
 probably at the Moscow Conference, to establish an author-
 itative international journal in order to provide guidance for
 the movement. It is not known whether there was any serious
 opposition to this step.  According to Pravda (7-8 March 1958)
 the organization meeting at Prague was attended by represen-
 tatives of "some" Communist countries.  Those parties which
 did not partake in the founding meeting are to be given "an
 opportunity to join on an equal footing or take part in the pub-
 lication and work of the journal in any form that suits them. "
 59.   The new journal is now being published in fif-
 teen langua'es and bears the title Problems of Peace and
 Socialism.    Its editor is Alexei Rumyantsev, .,.a Khrush-
 chev protege, who is a member of the Central Committee
 of the CPSU and a former editor of the authoritative Soviet
 theoretical journal, Kommunist.

 order, in a new economic structure. "

 60.   It is still too early to evaluate this successor
 to For a Lasting Peace!  For a People l s Democracy!
 So far its impact appears to have been slight, and its
 approach is more cautious than that of the defunct Comin-
 form journal.                                  Nevertheless, it provides a medium to dis-
 play the leading personalities and theorists of International
 Communism on an implied footing of equality.  It does set
 forth a-cexitral line, though hardly one which differs from
 that appearing in Pravda, Kommunist, International Affairs,
 New Times, and other readily available Soviet periodicals.
 In time, it may become more than a merely "theoretical
 and informative" organ of the movement and provide an
 authoritative interpretation of Soviet policies, a guidance
 for the "socialist camp" and a cement of ideological unity.
 So far, its articles have not emphasized the Commonwealth.
 C.      The Utilization of Existing Bloc Organizations
 61.   Although the establishment of a formal inter-
 national control mechanism remains in abeyance, the
 economic, political and military aspects of cooperation
 and mutual assistance are being vigorously developed under
 the guidance of two existing Bloc organizations, the Council
 for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA) and the Warsaw
 Pact.  Created in 1949 and 1955, respectively, their cur-
 rent burst of activity beginning in May 1958 and continuing
 to the present was unquestionably stimulated by the Moscow
 "summit" conference of November 1957, which, as we have
 seen, launched the concept of the Commonwealth on an inter-
 national basis.   These two primary and permanent organ-
 izations are supplemented by continuing development of bilat-
 eral and multilateral meetings, and by some degree of tacti-
 cal coordination at regional levels.
 62.   CEMMIA - or as it is sometimes called,
 COMECON - has only within the last year begun to place
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 heavy emphasis on the coordination of the separate economies
 of the member countries.  Whereas under Stalin, each of the
 European satellites had patterned its economy after the Soviet
 model, seeking to create a heavy industry base even in such
 predominantly agricultural countries as Bulgaria and Albania,
 Stalin's successors have increasingly recognized the need for
 diversification and specialization.  The turning point seems
 to have been reached in the meeting of CEMA which was held
 in Moscow in May 1958.  There is evidence that the Kremlin,
 at that time, undertook the gradual transformation of the Coun-
 cil into a major organization for long range economic coordin-
 ation, leading perhaps eventually to the full economic integra-
 tion of the Bloc.
 63.   A climax in this development was marked by the
 celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of CEMA (May 13-16,
 1959).  It is not without significance that the meeting took
 place in Tirana, Albania, and was immediately followed by
 the twelve-day visit of Khrushchev and by the appearance of
 the Chinese Defense Minister, Marshal Peng Teh-huai.  The
 intertwining of military, political and economic motifs, the
 presence of the supreme leader of the Bloc in its tiniest cap-
 ital, the representation of China - to be sure, by a military
 rather than an economic or political leader - all seem to
 present the emergent Commonwealth in epitome.
 64.   There have been many adumbrations of the fu-
 ture role which CEMA may be expected to play.  A single
 example will serve to illustrate it:
 The socialist camp presents itself, not only as a
 political Commonwealth of socialist countries, but
 as a definite economic unity.  It would be premature
 to consider the world system of socialist economies
 at the present stage as a single economy directed by
 a common plan.  Such a stage in the development of
 world socialism has not yet been reached.  The ten-

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 dency to the formation of a single world socialist
 economy has still not reached its culmination.  The
 world socialist economic system now appears as an
 association of mutually connected (sokupnost' vzaimos-
 vyazannikh) national economic systems of the social-
 ist states, the political, economic and cultural devel-
 opment of which proceeds on the base of self-subsistence
 and independence. 1
 65.   This citation - others could be adduced - reveals
 clearly the caution with which the subject is being handled. It
 is only natural that the European satellites should be appre-
 hensive over the restrictions which, in the name of "special-
 ization" may be placed over their economic expansion.  They
 have grown used to having their economic activity controlled
 by Moscow on a direct bilateral basis, and their relations with
 other satellites have been conducted through an often untidy
 complex of multilateral arrangements.  There is some evi-
 dence that the satellite leaders have not adjusted their think-
 ing and practice to the idea that a new order lies before them.
 Even up to the tenth. anniversary session, Polish, Czech, and
 East German officials are reported to have dismissed the idea
 that CEMA could become a significant factor in their economic
 dealings with the other satellites and especially with Moscow.
 There is still a tendency to view the current outburst of prop-
 aganda as unrelated to the reality of short range, largely ex-
 ploitative control of Bloc economies by the Kremlin overlords.
 66.   It is the general contention of this paper that
 the long range prospects of the Commonwealth must be taken
 seriously,  particularly with regard to economic planning.

 For that reason we impute high significance to both the
 ceremonial and the theoretical activity surrounding the
 Tirana celebration. 1
 The Warsaw Pact
 67.   The role of the Warsaw Pact in the future organ-
 ization of International Communism must also be considered
 in the framework of sodruzhestvo.  Although this sham alli-
 ance was a mere creation of the Soviet Union, obviously de-
 signed as a formal military counter to NATO, it has been
 increasingly presented as a political unity of sovereign and
 equal states.  The Political Consultative Committee of the
 Warsaw Treaty Organization has been enlisted in major Com-
 munist propaganda campaigns, especially in support of "peace"
 and the banning of nuclear tests.  Its  communique of 26 May
 1958 - three days after that of CEMA - strictly followed the
 overall Soviet line.
 68.   Although the Warsaw Pact, being a military
 alliance, tends to invite presentation as a "monolithic camp, "
 its Political Consultative Committee is suffused, in:.,recent
 writings, with the aura of the Commonwealth.  Its
 program for consolidating peace . . , expresses the
 interest of all humanity, and consequently obtained
 the approval of the widest circles in the international
 community.
 IThe significance of the CEMA developments is beginning to
 be noted in the Western press; cf. Paul Wohl "Soviet Talks
 in Tirana Conclude, " Christian Science Monitor (27 May 1959)
 who observes that "the new plan highlighted Moscow's decision
 in favor of joint economic development of the European end of
 the 'socialist commonwealth'. ''

 The use of the Warsaw Pact framework for political purposes
 was demonstrated by a meeting of Bloc Foreign Ministers in
 April 1959, ostensibly for the coordination of policy prior to
 the Geneva Conference.   For the first time in the history of
 the Pact, Communist China participated.
 Multilateral Meetings Outside the Bloc
 69.   Concentration on strengthening the unity and co-
 hesion of the Bloc has not led the Kremlin to neglect the
 parties of the Free World.  Here, too, the device of the mul-
 tilateral meeting has been employed, and again the theoretical
 conception is that of sodruzhestvo.  At the end of June 1958, a
 conference "For Peace in Europe" was convoked in East Ber-
 lin, ostensibly by the West German Communist Party (KPD).
 Of the fifteen participating parties, only three were from the
 Bloc - East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia and all-of
 the remainder were from Western Europe.  The Communique
 of the conference, following the line of the Warsaw Pact meet-
 ing, called for the cooperation of the working class against
 the "adventurous course of American and German imperial-
 ism" on behalf of the "world-wide peace movement. " Soviet
 praise of this meeting, as demonstrating the "fraternal sup-
 port of the working class throughout the world" for the coun-,
 tries of the Socialist Commonwealth shows clearly the direct-
 ing hand of the Kremlin center. 1
 70.   Other multilateral meetings of Free World Com-
 munist parties have been held.  On the occasion of the XXICPSU
 Congress in Moscow, both Western European and Latin Amer-
 ican party leaders are reported to have met in secret sessions
 under the chairmanship of Suslov, and to have received bind-
 ing tactical directives.  Subsequently a group of the Latin Amer-
 ican delegates visited Peiping' where they are believed to have
 listened to advice from Mao Tse-tung on the conduct of revolu-
 tion in the Western hemisphere.

 Regional Coordination
 71.   A number of indications point to an increasing
 use of regional control points for International Communism.
 These are not intended to function autonomously, in the spirit
 of Togliatti's "polycentrism." They are primarily centers
 to facilitate communications, travel, and coordination of
 matters common to the area.  The strongest and most signi-
 ficant Communist Party is assigned certain limited functions
 which it must carry out in strict subordination to Moscow. If
 a substantial change of strategy is called for, this is still
 likely to be laid down in Moscow, behind the scenes at an
 International Communist conclave, such as the XXI CPSU
 Congress.  So far, the emphasis of this regional activity
 appears to be more of a Cominform than a sodruzhestvo type.
 72.   The clearest evidence that this practice is well
 established comes from Latin America.  Several factors ap-
 pear to have dictated the use of regional control centers:
 distance from Moscow, difficulty and expense of secure
 travel and communications, relative weakness and in many
 cases illegality of Communist Parties, and sparsity of Soviet
 and satellite diplomatic establishments.
 73.   In the Middle East, the situation is in flux.  The
 creation of an Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee (December
 1957) with its seat in Cairo appears to have had the dual pur-
 pose of exploiting the "spirit of Bandung" for regional'prop-
 aganda and marshalling Communist and fellow travelling
 elements for the penetration of the area.  Subsequent develop-
 ments, especially the revolution in Iraq and the repression of
 Egyptian Communists by Nasser appear to have reduced the
 value of this instrumentality to International Communism.
 Moscow may be developing a limited form of regional party
 coordination, utilizing the Syrian Communist Khalid Bakdash
 and his apparatus to facilitate communications and tactical
 operations among the Arab countries.  Addis Ababa., plays a
 coordinating role for East Africa.

 74.   In Europe, the Italian Communist Party appears
 to have taken on new responsibilities vis-a-vis the hard-
 pressed French party, and possibly in the Mediterranean area
 generally.  At the beginning of April 1959 a meeting of six
 Western European Communist Party leaders was held in Brus-
 sels for the purpose of discussing the problems presented by
 the Common Market and European integration.  There is no
 clear indication, however, that a West European Cominform
 is in being.
 75.   Relatively little is known about the coordination
 of Communist Party activities in South and Southeast Asia.
 There must be some division of function between the Soviet
 and the Chinese parties.  The fact that the USSR and the
 European satellites are more widely represented diplomat-
 ically than Communist China undoubtedly favors a preemin-
 ence of Soviet influence, although the Chinese economic
 "model" is generally held to be more pertinent for the coun-
 tries of that region than that of the USSR.

 IX.     COMMUNIST CHINA AND THE FUTURE OF INTER-
 NATIONAL. COMMUNIST ORGANIZATION
 76.   The growing power of Communist China assures
 it a major voice in the future organization of the International
 Movement. Since the crisis of 1956 the long shadow of Mao
 has hovered over every aspect of World Communism, and,
 at the Moscow meeting of November 1957, he stepped direct-
 ly into the limelight.  No attempt will be made to review the
 entire course of interplay between the two leaderships - the
 more so since it is inevitably obscure at many key turns -
 but there will be offered a speculative appraisal of the atti-
 tude which China appears to hold toward the developments
 described above.  This attitude may be examined in its two
 components of party and state organization.
 77.   We may be certain that Mao yields to no one in
 his advocacy of unity and harmony among the Communist
 parties of the world.  But he is equally determined to pre-
 serve the principle of specific national differences within
 this prevailing unity, and to resist any tendencies toward
 absolute hegemony on the part of the Soviet Union,  The
 classic statement of these principles is contained in a funda-
 mental document of the stabilization campaign, "More on the
 Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
 (28 December 1956):
 Marxism-Leninism holds that there are common basic
 laws in the development of human society, but each
 state and nation has features different from those of
 others.  Thus nations pass through the class struggle,
 and will eventually arrive at Communism by roads
 that are the same in essence but different in their
 specific forms . . . All the experience of the Soviet
 Union, including its fundamental experience, is bound
 up with definite national characteristics and no other
 country should copy it mechanically. I

 These are carefully measured words, and Mao has elaborated
 them elsewhere in reproof both of deviationist tendencies among
 the satellites, especially Poland and Hungary, and of "great
 nation chauvinism" of the Russians.  The Chinese have, of
 course, been particularly bitter in denouncing the "revision-
 ist" position of the Yugoslavs.
 78.   The corollaries of this theory of International
 Communist solidarity are two:
 (a)  should the Communist parties maintain relations
 of equality among themselves and reach common
 understanding . . . through genuine, and not nominal
 exchange of views, their unity will be strengthened;
 (b)  conversely, if in their mutual relations, one party
 imposes its views on others, or if the parties use the
 method of interference in each other's internal affairs
 . . . their unity will be impaired. 1
 79.   Applied to party organization, the Chinese posi-
 tion is incompatible with the reinstitution of a new Comintern.
 Although Peking recognizes the ideological pre-eminence of
 Moscow, it is unwilling to permit outside determination of its
 own party policies.  Moscow's leadership, which Mao person-
 ally reaffirmed in 'November 1957, results in part from its
 historic role in the world revolution, in part from the recog-
 nition of its guiding role in strategy, and in part from its
 economic aid and military support. It is not absolute.
 80.   In general, it would appear that during the past
 two years harmony has prevailed in the relations of the Soviet
 and the Chinese parties.  It cannot be denied, however, that
 there have been manifestations of sensitivity, which, at least
 to non-Communist eyes,    seem to reveal considerable areas
 of actual or potential friction.  Besides rebuking "great nation
 chauvinism, " Mao has set forth a doctrine of "non-antagonistic
 contradictions" between the ruling party and the masses which

 Khrushchev has criticized with visible pique.  The over-
 zealous ideological claims which attended the launching of
 the communes on mainland China were received with initial
 frostiness and then were quickly rebutted by Soviet leaders.
 Yet both sides have decided not to "wash their dirty linen in
 public" and have made adjustments in their positions which
 restored equanimity.  It is impossible to say how much
 underlying resentment persists, but harmony seems to have
 been restored.
 81.   Against this background of party amity, it is
 probable that Communist China will adapt itself to the con-
 cept of relations among socialist states which the Soviet Lead-
 ers have been elaborating.  Whether this will lead to an accept-
 ance of the sodruzhestvo in any concrete organizational terms
 remains to be seen.  There has been a rather noticeable reti-
 cence on the subject in Chinese statements.  So far, the Chi-
 nese Communists have made no effort to provide a theoretical
 discussion of the Commonwealth comparable to that which
 Soviet publicists have put forth.  Indeed, there appears to be
 no precise equivalent to the term sodruzhestvo.  The usual
 translation is to chia t'ing (great-house-court) which may be
 rendered as the "great family" of socialist nations.  Political
 commonwealths, such as the British?are designated by the
 term lien pang which means a "federated form of government. "
 82.   In the field of intra-Bloc economic organization,
 Peking has maintained an ambivalent position.  Together with
 its satellites, it has participated in meetings of CEMA in an
 observer capacity, but there is no evidence that it has become
 more deeply involved.  The communique of the tenth anniver-
 sary session in Tirana has been duly reported in the Chinese
 press, but without the enthusiasm which characterized the
 attendant propaganda in the Soviet Bloc countries.  It has in-
 deed been apparent for some time that China, like the Euro-
 pean satellites, is mistrustful of CEMA's program of "co-
 ordination" and "specialization, " but unlike the latter it is

 powerful enough to assert its reservations.  It is inevitable
 that China, with its aspiration to achieve a fully developed,
 balanced modern socialist economy, "outstripping Britain"
 and other advanced capitalist economies, cannot accept
 restrictions on any of its fields of expansion.  In 1956 Chou
 En-lai spoke out against the application of "specialization"
 to China.  Continuing difficulties in the progress of trade
 negotiations with the USSR indicate that Peking has no inten-
 tion of remaining indefinitely a mere supplier of agricultural
 products and raw materials to the Bloc.  Although it will
 remain dependent on the USSR and the European satellites
 for the sinews of heavy industry for years to come, it will
 not cease to strive for a more equitable balance in the com-
 position of its trade, and for a growing role in the economic
 penetration of the underdeveloped countries.  Recent Soviet
 statements have been careful not to indicate any desire to
 restrict this striving.
 83.   On the political side, the tradition of Chinese
 Communist theory has much in common with the line which
 the Soviet Union has been developing.  Liu Shao-chi, now
 second in command to Mao, wrote as early as 1948:
 The proletariat firmly opposes all national oppression.
 It firmly opposes both the oppression of its own nation
 by any other nation and the oppression of any other
 nation by its own nation; it advocates complete free-
 dom of federation or of separation from all nations.
 This concept of "free federation" lies close to the flexible
 approach to Bloc relations which the Socialist Commonwealth
 is designed to provide.  We have noted above the close paral-
 lel between the guiding principles of the latter and the Pancha
 I"On Internationalism and Nationalism, " China Digest,
 (14 December 1958), emphasis supplied.

 Shila or Five Points of Bandung, developed by Nehru and U Nu,
 which Chou En-lai enthusiastically espoused.
 84.   In practical terms, Communist China on more
 than one occasion has intervened in Bloc affairs in the spirit
 of sodruzhestvo.   At the height of the 1956 crisis, Chou En-
 lai toured Eastern Europe, seeking to calm the rebellious
 mood of Poland and to moderate the resentment against Soviet
 dictation in the satellites.  At the same time, he - and Mao
 in "More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of
 the Proletariat" ! - made it plain that the Chinese Communists
 were firmly opposed to "national communism" in the sense
 which Tito had given it.  Any hope that China would e spouse
 "polycentrism" or would condone excessive emphasis on
 ''national roads to socialism" has been effectively dashed.
 85.   Within China itself, the possibility of creating
 a sodruzhestvo patterned after the USSR scarcely arises.
 China, with its thousands of years of culture, has always re-
 garded itself more as a civilization than as a nation.  The
 national minorities are small, constituting only about six
 percent of the entire population, and their assimilation pre-
 sents much simpler problems than is the case with the minor-
 ities of the USSR.  During the past ten years Chinese policy
 toward the minority groups has generally been cautious, al-
 though1within the past year there has been a noticeable hard-
 ening.    The brutal treatment of Tibet has evoked protests
 from China's Asiatic neighbors.  Peking, however, probably
 feels that it has no choice but to proceed with the extirpation
 of "reaction,  "  counting on time to blur the sense of outrage.
 lAn excellent summary of the changes in this policy is
 presented by Roderick MacFarquhar, "Communist China's
 First Decade:     The Minorities, " New Leader, (8 June 1959),
 p. 21.

 86.   In sum, the Chinese Communist attitude toward
 the organization of International Communism follows orthodox
 Marxist-Leninist tradition.  Unity comes first, but it must
 not be imposed arbitrarily.  On the party side, the pre-emin-
 ence of Moscow must be respected, but it cannot be allowed
 to dictate through a Comintern.  On the governmental side,
 the co-equality of states must be recognized, and their rela-
 tions must be developed on the basis of mutuality of interest.
 Thus, it appears that Peking might be willing to participate
 in a Socialist Commonwealth in which it would share with
 Moscow a benevolent condominium of superior power over
 the satellites but would not permit the exercise of hegemony.

 X.      POSSIBLE TACTICS IMPLEMENTING INTERNATION-
 AL COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY
 87.   We have seen that in the aftermath of the 1956
 crisis, the leaders of International Communism, in their
 drive for stabilization and ideological conformity, have at-
 tached the highest priority to restoring the unity of the Bloc
 on both the party and the government levels.  In this process,
 no major sacrifice of Marxist-Leninist doctrine to political
 expedience has been permitted.     "Reactionary" and "revision-
 ist" elements - Tito, Nagy, the Dalai Lama - have been
 crushed by force, where this was possible, or have been
 expelled from the fold.  The maintenance of ideological purity
 is integral with the preservation of order and cohesion in the
 Communist movement.      The key to its dynamism is organi-
 zation, dedicated to a social vision of enormous and ominous
 aspect.
 88.   If, as this paper contends, the Commonwealth
 of Socialist States is being readied for a future role of great
 importance, the question naturally arises what shape it may
 be expected to take.  In all strategic steps the "creative"
 elaboration of Marxism-Leninism proceeds on a basis of
 multiple objectives.  Tactical requirements may obscure
 for a time the primary direction, and resistance may lead
 to temporary retreats.  Hence, in assessing the sodruzhest-
 vo, we must project our scrutiny beyond current vicissitudes
 and seek to penetrate the deeper confines of its potential.
 A.      A Temporary Continuation of the Conference System
 89.   As noted above, Communist leaders and the-
 orists have proclaimed the virtues of bilateral and multi-
 lateral meetings of both parties and governments.  They
 have been resourceful in finding occasions for staging inter-
 national "get-togethers " - an anniversary or a plenary ses-
 sion of a leading Party.  These may be switched from one

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 end of the Bloc to the other, dramatizing the vastness of the
 land mass over which Communism holds direct sway, or even
 the strategic significance of its tiny exclave, Albania.  The
 profusion of ceremonial speeches and propaganda outpourings
 builds up an image of power and activity, while providing a
 convenient screen for closed discussions of tactics and policy.
 90.   And yet, the conference system can hardly be
 regarded by the Communist leaders as an adequate mechanism
 for directing the movement.  It does not provide those proper
 organizational weapons which Lenin consistently argued are
 essential to the triumph of the world revolution.  The confer-
 ence system lacks the continuity which a powerful core of
 permanent executives gave to the Comintern.  Instead, the
 central leadership must rely on an assortment of channels
 and "transmission belts, " diplomatic establishments, polit-
 ical, economic and. cultural missions, international journals
 and front organizations.  We may question whether this com-
 plex system would appear adequate, in the eyes of the Krem-
 lin, to cope with a repetition of the crisis of 1956, or even to
 provide the necessary dynamics of advance in a prolonged
 relaxing period of "'peaceful co-existence. IT
 B.      Exploitation of the Commonwealth to Promote a
 United Front
 91.   Although the sodruzhestvo concept is applied at
 present primarily to the twelve existing nations of the Bloc,
 it also is being projected, tentatively at least, on a global
 scale.  An appeal is constantly being made, over the govern-
 ments of the Free World, to the rank and file of workers and
 "peace-loving peoples" and to some of the left-wing political
 parties.  In time, the Commonwealth concept may be exploit-
 ed as a lure to entrap sympathetic governments and people
 in a vast United Front.  The appeal is couched in vague,
 idealistic terms:

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 As yet the international relations of a new type are
 completely dominant in only one part of the world -
 the Socialist World.  However, the existence of these
 most humane and lofty relations between peoples and
 countries in mankind's many-centuries long history
 exercises a great positive influence upon the whole
 system of relations between countries and upon all
 the processes taking place in the world today. I
 This "wave of the future" is presented to all the workers of
 the world in a spirit "combining internationalism and patriot-
 ism. "
 92.   This is, of course, only a part of the untiring
 campaign of blandishment which International Communism
 directs to the Socialist parties.  Although these appeals
 usually fall on deaf ears or meet sharp rebuff:, Moscow may
 feel that, couched in the terminology of the sndruzhestvo,
 they will gradually gain. greater acceptance.  By subtle analogy
 with the British. Commonwealth, the Communists convey an
 image of unfettered association, free from apprehension of
 imperial dominion. 2  The peoples which may be tempted to
 participate are given the promise of "true" national indepen-
 dence.
 93.   The Social Democratic parties of Western coun-
 tries are, of course, much too experienced in Communist
 deviousness to be taken in by professions of "non-interference"'
 and "fraternal mutual assistance. "  But in other areas of the
 1Sanakoyev, op. cit., p. 33.
 2The Communists, of course, repudiate any basic similarity
 of the two institutions:  "The imperialists . . . term as
 'commonwealths' the aggressive blocs created for war prep-
 aration, NATO, SEATO, and the Baghdad Pact, which are
 entirely subject to US policy.  But they are not a common-
 wealth of nations.  They are rather unions of predatory im-
 perialists. " Kuskov, p..26. ~,                             See Annex IV an differences
 between the two commonwealths.

 world, especially the Afro-Asian, more susceptible mater-
 ial is at hand.  By nurturing the virulent nationalism of the
 newly independent countries, by offering them arms and
 economic aid, and above all by professing to be satisfied
 with their "neutralism" and not demanding positive support,
 the Communists are preparing the ground to embrace them
 in an eventual Socialist Commonwealth.
 C.       The Development of Inter-CP Coordination - A New
 Comintern?
 94.   The past few years have been marked by a
 cautious attitude toward the coordination of the activities of
 international Communist parties.  There is every reason to
 assume that this will continue to be the case for some time
 to come.  The objections of many Communists to the reviv-
 al of a visible Comintern, together with the adverse impact
 which such a step would have on the neutralist and uncom-
 mitted nations, probably remain decisive.
 95.   On the other hand some measure of demonstra-
 tive action, some display of solidarity and universality will
 always seem desirable to a movement with the essential
 characteristics of a "secular religion. " The outward evi-
 dence of comradely cooperation and harmony - however
 fraught with tensions it may be beneath the surface - is an
 organic requirement for the vitality and dynamism of the
 movement.
 96.   The opinion is sometimes expressed that a
 Comintern is - and indeed always has been - in being, des-
 pite the absence of tangible institutional form.  The Confer-
 ence of Communist and Workers' Parties is regarded as the
 "present form" of the "International Communist organiza-
 tion, formerly represented by the Comintern and the Com-

 inform."'  Its November 1957 Declaration - quoted above
 is viewed as the manifesto of a permanent body, continuity
 with the past being represented in the person of O.V. Kuu-
 sinen who was Secretary of the Executive Committee of the
 Comintern from 1921 to 1939 and who is now a member of
 the Soviet Presidium.
 97.   There is much to be said in support of this view.
 Nevertheless, we incline to believe that this Conference of
 Communist and Workers' Parties is as yet an "organization
 without an organization. "  Although such  an arrangement
 cannot be entirely satisfactory to the top leaders of the move-
 ment, it probably commends itself at this time as a comprom-
 ise between the hard, rigid, undeviating dictation which was
 possible under Stalin and the more flexible assertion of power,
 working through consensus which is the professed"style" of
 Khrushchev.
 98.   The Conference of Communist and Workers'
 Parties and the Commonwealth of Socialist Nations may be
 viewed as a loose but vast apparatus serving the function of
 welding the "monolith" of parties and states.  They are the
 twin engines of world revolution, guided and dominated by
 one principle, "proletarian internationalism. " Neither has
 achieved clear institutional delineation, yet both appear to
 meet the actual needs of the movement.  Their roles to some
 extent overlap.  Either or both can be expanded as opportun-
 ity arises, or reduced if tactical expedience so dictates.
 But as strategic instruments - whatever form they eventually

 XI,    CONCLUSION AND FORECAST
 99.        Having analyzed - so far as possible, within the
 Communist frame of reference - the emergence and develop-
 ment of the concept of a Socialist Commonwealth and its rela-
 tion to other conceptual and organizational aspects of the
 "world socialist system, " we address ourselves to the vital
 questions of concern to the Free World and the United States:
 what are the long range prospects for the Commonwealth?
 Do the Communist leaders really believe in the concept and
 intend to give it tangible shape and form?
 100.  Although it is obviously impossible to project
 with confidence over the time span which these questions em-
 brace, it is at least possible to venture a prediction of what
 may happen to the "world socialist system" over the next ten
 to fifteen years, unless there is a more vigorous reaction by
 the Free World to the challenge of the "Commonwealth " than
 is now being displayed.  Put in simple terms, unless it is
 vigorously countered by bold, positive and imaginative meas-
 ures, in our opinion the sodruzhestvo has good prospects of
 making major advances outside the present Communist Bloc.
 101.  What we are witnessing may prove to be another
 brazen, brilliant and successful attempt of International Com-
 munism to appropriate a noble concept of freedom, precisely
 as it has grasped and debased other treasures of our heritage
 - Peace, Democracy, Humanity, and even Freedom itself.
 The British Commonwealth has set the pattern for the peace-
 ful transformation of an Empire into a harmonious associa-
 tion of widely disparate but equal and sovereign nations. Com-
 munism, declaring this institution corrupt and moribund,
 issues the challenge of its own "co-friendship. "
 102.  One may derive some reassurance from point-
 ing out the obstacles which the Communists are bound to

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 encounter, but, if we are to avoid dangerous complacency, we
 must try to project ourselves into their consciousness and
 measure the dynamics of will power which they can focus and
 the historic processes which they expect to work in their be-
 half.  Such a projection is very sobering.
 103.  We have seen that Communist spokesmen present
 the Socialist Commonwealth as a step toward realizing the unity
 of mankind, a kind of "kingdom of heaven on earth. " In polit-
 ical terms, this implies that the nation state is already regard-
 ed as obsolete.  As the embodiment of "bourgeois nationalism"
 it has become the major source of socio-economic evil. Against
 it, under the banner of "proletarian internationalism" a world
 community consisting of nationalities is to be created.
 In the long run, national interests in one country not
 only coincide with internationalism, but international
 interests supersede national ones, and the state which
 acts to the detriment of the harmonious correlations
 and common interests of the Commonwealth (sodruz-
 hestvo) is neither internationalist nor patriotic. 1
 104. The Communists are not unaware of the danger
 of Utopianism, and inveigh against it, as, for example, in the
 case of the exaggerated claims which accompanied the launch-
 ing of the Chinese communes.  They have prescribed a long,
 painful. struggle to achieve the "transition from socialism to
 communism. " They recognize that it will not be won unless
 they can enjoy "peaceful coexistence" over an extended period,
 not between the two ideologies which are mortally at war, but
 between the two "systems" of states which have and will retain

 the physical power to destroy each other.  Their ideology
 gives them the assurance that the outcome is inevitable
 triumph:  this, of course, is a matter of faith, but, in their
 conviction, of faith that moves mountains.
 105.  One might be willing to believe that the roseate
 vision of the Commonwealth could, over a long period of time,
 come to be accepted by a group of states possessing some
 ethnic or historical factors in common, such as the Soviet
 Union and the East European satellites.  But could it be ex-
 tended to comprehend the masses of China and to project
 outward among other remote and dissimilar peoples?  Will
 not the population explosion of China engulf the Soviet Union?
 Are not rivalry and conflict between the forces led by Mao
 and Khrushchev and their successors inevitable?
 106.  These questions cannot be dismissed with cate-
 gorical answers.  That there are frictions between the two
 chief countries of the Bloc is certain.  But the ties drawing
 and holding them together, their economic, military and
 foreign policy interests, are strongly cemented by common
 ideology and common interests.
 107.  Duumvirates are notoriously unstable.  Never-
 theless, whatever disruptive issues may arise, Mao and
 Khrushchev appear determined to resolve them before they
 become dangerous.     Both men are imbued with the sense of
 historic mission, and are conscious of the limited time'.ly-
 ing before them.  They have been compared to twin Moses,
 glimpsing from afar the Promised Land of Communism which
 their successors will enter.  As time-bound humans, they
 may prefer that the vanguard of the "chosen people" be Chinese
 or Russian, but their vision, however clouded, is turned toward
 future generations of all mankind.

 108.  The sodruzhestvo concept, of course, is far from
 being inspired uniquely by such "lofty and humane considera-
 tions" as the Communist theorists and propagandists invoke.
 As a logical development of Marxism-Leninism applied to
 organization, it must be regarded by the Kremlin as an em-
 inently practical instrumentality.  It can be made to serve
 the broad purposes of foreign. policy, such as the promotion
 of "peaceful coexistence. " It can be used to invest a demon-
 strative gesture, such as the recent Tirana gathering, with
 symbolism      "unto the least of these" - and portent - missile
 bases in Greece and Italy. 1 It can be propagated as a global
 United Front tactic.
 109.  The tempo of the Commonwealth is adjustable.
 There is no deadline for its inauguration, and there are ad-
 vantages to delay and deliberation.  But the development of
 inter-state Communist association is self-propelling.  What-
 ever the tactical divagations, the strategic goal is steady.
 110.  The specific interim form which the Common-
 wealth would be most likely to take would be a federation of
 Socialist states.  At a solemn conclave, for example, at the
 Fiftieth Anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution (1967) - or
 much earlier - the Conference of Communist and Workers'
 Party might "unanimously" approve a constitution which
 could, for form's sake, be presented by one of the satellite
 party leaders.  The Constitution might establish a Congress,
 1
 It is interesting to note that the Tirana meeting extended at
 least an olive twig in the direction of Tito.  Premier Hoxha
 of Albania used a sodruzhestvo type of language in offering
 to develop relations with Yugoslavia on the basis of "mutual
 respect, equal rights, and non-interference in internal af-
 fairs. " (FBIS,  1 June 1959, AA 3).

 meeting at specified intervals, rotating through the capitals
 of the Commonwealth.  At each Congress a hierarchy might
 be elected, a Chairman, a Presidium or Directorate. and a
 Central Committee.  All member nations would be equally
 represented, and would be eligible to share the highest of-
 fices.  Existing central organizations, such as the Warsaw
 Pact and CEMA, would be assimilated into the central insti-
 tution on the same principle of equality.  Existing local or-
 ganizations would be maintained in each member country.
 111. We do not believe it unrealistic to think that the
 Soviet Union could accept such a governance with its formal
 principle of equality of the greatest and the least.  For a long
 time to come, it could afford to rely on its total power -
 ideological, political, economic, military - to insure its ef-
 fective predominance and control.  Eventually it might hope
 that this Commonwealth would realize what the Soviet Union
 has gone far toward achieving in prototype, the fusion of dis-
 parate nationalities into a single political entity.
 112.  Whether the Chinese Communist leaders would
 find such a development compatible with their own interest
 is perhaps more problematical.  The sense of military and
 economic dependence on the Soviet Union will continue to en-
 gender ambivalent reactions probably for many years.  But
 the growing consciousness of power, unless it is checked by
 some unforeseen crisis, should gradually lead to. a more re-
 laxed attitude toward the Soviet Union, and produce greater
 willingness to dilute the de facto condominium with the Soviet
 Union over the lesser nations of the `isocialist system.
 113.  If the Soviet Union pressed for an actual federa-
 tion with its own satellites - a partial rather than a compre-
 hensive sodruzhestvo - China might develop a similar rela-
 tionship with North Korea, r.Nbr.th;.Vietiiatn: and Outer Mongolia
 - not to mention other countries which might be lured or

 forced to join.  Thus, it is possible that the present Bloc
 might be organized. into two Commonwealths remaining
 juridically separate for some time, While maintaining har-
 mony and cooperation under their common Marxist-Leninist
 banner.  On the practical level such an arrangement might
 provide a useful Illegal" basis for direct interventions by
 force - as in the case of Hungary - to repress rebellious
 members of the federation, whether Asiatic or European.
 This would provide a pretext for circumventing the United
 Nations.
 114.  The idea of a federation of Bloc countries,
 eliminating existing national boundaries, is close to, if not
 at the surface of public awareness.  In his speech to the
 German workers at Leipzig (7 March 1959) Khrushchev ex-
 pressed the hope that border problems "will disappear in the
 future with the worldwide victory of Communism . . . fron-
 tiers as they are understood today will gradually cease to
 exist." As might be expected, this cryptic but authoritative
 utterance did not go unnoticed in the satellites.  A Budapest
 article has significantly echoed the theme:
 The quick economic development of certain countries
 has resulted in a natural lessening by degrees of the
 importance of existing economic and outmoded ties
 among us.  This, for example, can have repercussions
 on the development of certain countries which, because
 of the victory of communism, can lead to the end of
 the importance of borders.  Under these conditions
 the old conceptions of borders will gradually disappear.
 Comrade Khrushchev stressed recently in a speech at
 the Ninth All-German Workers' Conference that these
 borders will simply determine the historical settle-

 ment of one or another country.  Their significance
 will not be economic it political, but rather ethno-
 graphic and cultural.
 115.  We have suggested that the ultimate goal of fed-
 eration within the Bloc would be to create the matrix for a
 sort of "Communist United Nations. " If such an organization
 were to emerge, it would undoubtedly have to be acknowledged
 initially by the Communists to be standing in "antithesis" to
 the existing United Nations.  They would justify this "counter"
 organization by alleging the corruption of the UN resulting
 from imperialist - specifically American - domination.  From
 the confrontation of the two, they might claim that a new
 "synthesis" would arise, a "true" world federation.  Through
 the process of "transition from socialism" such an entity

 SOVIET AND SATELLITE STATEMENTS
 ON THE SODRUZHESTVO
 Presidium member Al. .Kirichenko, who is held to
 be next in rank after Khrushchev and Mikoyan, in an address
 to the XI Congress of the Czech Communist Party described
 the socialist camp as:
 . . . this great Commonwealth of truly independent,
 truly equal nations, united by the high and noble aims
 of building a new rich life free of the evils of the cap-
 italist 'paradise'.  In this Commonwealth each nation
 strives to help the others, and each regards the suc-
 cesses of the others as his own.  (Pravda, June 20,
 1958).
 At a meeting of the Czech-Soviet Friendship Society
 (12 July 1958) Khrushchev dealt with the mutual relations of
 the Socialist countries primarily in the context of the "social-
 ist camp";                    he also, however, dwelt on the Commonwealth
 theme:
 The rallying of the socialist countries into a brother-
 ly Commonwealth of states with equal rights is dice
 tated by vital necessity . . . It is fully understandable
 that such a Commonwealth, established on the basis
 of the identity of the social-economic and political
 regime of the socialist countries, identity of their
 Marxist-Leninist ideology, and unity of aims in the
 struggle for the victory of socialism and peace, has
 nothing in common with the aggressive imperialist
 blocs aimed against the freedom and independence of
 the peoples, and against peace and socialism . . .

 On the anniversary of the 1957 Declaration of Repre-
 sentatives of Communist and Workers' Parties, Presidium
 member O. V. Kuusinen stressed the need for socialist
 solidarity:
 The Declaration emphasized that in the current situa-
 tion, it is especially important to strengthen the unity
 and brotherly cooperation of the socialist states.
 This recommendation of the Declaration could not
 have been more timely.  The fact of the matter is
 that in recent years world reaction has led concen-
 trated attacks on the Commonwealth of socialist
 countries.  And the unity of the countries and com-
 munist parties of the socialist camp has been one of
 the main targets at which contemporary revisionists
 aim their poisoned arrows . . .I
 Again at an international party conclave, the XXI
 Congress, Khrushchev repeated the theme of the Moscow
 Declaration.  In enumerating the tasks confronting socialist
 foreign policy, he stated:
 It is essential to strive for the cessation of the cold
 war and for relaxation of tension, and to do every-
 thing possible to strengthen the world socialist system
 and the commonwealth of fraternal peoples.
 It is perhaps significant that against this Soviet cres-
 cendo, the satellite leaders, generally Stalinist by tradition,
 appear to have clung to the more familiar image of the "camp. "
 Nevertheless, even Antonin Novotny, President of the People's
 Republic of Czechoslovakia and First Secretary of the Czech
 Party, paid homage to the new concept.  In an address to the
 Central Committee he declared:

 The Socialist camp led by the Soviet Union today
 represents a mighty Commonwealth of Socialist
 States, united by the strong ties of proletarian inter-
 nationalism, based on closest brotherly support,
 and solidified in their position by new socialist inter-
 national relations.  (Mlada Front, 12 December 1958).
 As might be expected, Gomulka appears to have wel-
 comed the new concept.  In a speech to the Polish shipbuild-
 ers at Gdansk (28 June 1958) he hailed the "unshakeable
 Componwealth of socialist countries" as the outgrowth of
 Soviet economic aid and the mutual assistance of the Bloc
 members.  Criticizing Yugoslavia for its ambiguous posi-
 tion toward the two rival camps, he remarked:
 One could say,  'There are thirteen socialist countries,
 but only twelve belong to the socialist camp.  One. of
 the countries - Yugoslavia - does not, and does not
 wish to, belong to the socialist camp. '  The imperial-
 ist peoples say that they are not attacking Yugoslavia;
 that they allow her to build socialism although she is
 isolated.  The reply to this is simple. Yugoslavia as
 a socialist state can exist only because there exists
 a Commonwealth of twelve socialist countries . . .
 More recently in his report to the Third Polish Work-
 ers' Party Congress (10 March 1959) Gomulka declared:
 When we speak today, as we did in the past, about
 the world socialist revolution and the inevitability
 of the world victory of socialism, we must - without
 detracting one iota from the importance of Marxist-
 Leninist theory for the development and success of
 this revolution, but on the contrary developing and
 enriching this theory - we must realize that at the

 ANNEX II
 In 1958, an immense number of books, pamphlets, and
 articles were devoted by Soviet and Communist literature to
 the question of "world socialist system, " the "camp, " and
 the "sodruzhestvo. " From this mass of material the follow-
 ing three books may be selected as probably performing the
 role of authoritative directives-
 1.                              "SODRUZHESTVO STRAN SOTSIALIZMA" ("The
 Co-friendship of the Countries of Socialism") issued by
 the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences
 of the USSR in the summer of 1958 (338 pages);
 2.  "MIROVAYA SOTSIALISTICHESKAYA SISTEMA
 KHOZYAISTVA" ("World Socialist System of Economy")
 published at the end of 1958 by the Institute of Economics
 of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (559 pages);
 3.  "VOPROSY VNESHNEI POLITIKI STRAN SOTSIAL-
 ISTICHESKOGO LAGERYA" ("Questions of Foreign
 Policy of the Countries of the Socialist Camp") pub-
 lished at the end of 1958 by the Institute of International
 Relations (254 pages).
 The most striking theses of the three books are summarized
 below.
 Published by the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy
 of Sciences of the USSR, the book under the title of "SODRUZ-
 HESTVO STRAN SOTSIALIZMA" consists of articles by si,x
 important Soviet Marxist philosophers (M. B. Mitin, Ts. A.
 Stepanian, F. T. Konstantinov, I. S. Shcherbakov, A. I.
 Arnoldov, and A. K. Azizyan) followed by an editorial from
 Pravda (May 9,  1958) entitled:  "In the unity and solidarity

 of the Marxist-Leninist parties lies the guaranty of the further
 victories of the world socialist system. "  The book presented
 the following theses:
 1.  The October Revolution came as a natural conse-
 quence of the conflicts of imperialism and the growth
 and development of the Russian and international labor
 movements.  It was of world wide historical significance.
 2.  As a result of the October Revolution social and
 economic changes based on socialist principles were
 made in the USSR, exemplary socialism was construct-
 ed in one country, and the road toward liberation from
 capitalism was defined.
 3.  "The victory of revolution within one country is at
 one and the same time the beginning and premise for
 world revolution which is continuing to develop as a
 result of the revolutionary withdrawal of countries from
 the system of imperialist states. " (P. 123).
 4.  The experience gained by the CPSU and the Soviet
 state is of international significance and is utilized in
 the first place by the People's democracies; this exper
 ience has confirmed the influence of the Marxist-:Lenin-
 ist doctrine on the dictatorship of the proletariat and the
 role of the Communist party.
 5.  The October revolution gave an impulse to the revol-
 utionary movement in the entire world and to the move-
 ment for national liberation of the countries of Asia and
 Africa, by initiating the organization of Communist
 parties and of the Communist International.
 6.  The formation of a "world system" of socialism
 fundamentally reconstructed the relationship which
 existed between capitalism and socialism.  This system
 had its beginning in the October revolution and in the
 successes of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet state has

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 played a major role in creating and developing the People's
 democracies.
 7.     Transition to socialism produces multiple forms but
 retains one substance which is the dictatorship of the prole-
 tariat.  Regularly appearing phenomena which unite the coun-
 tries of socialism into one camp exist in the historical devel-
 opment of all countries.  The laws of revolutionary trans-
 formation common to all, and the principles of socialist con-
 struction arising therefrom do not permit the appearance of
 varieties of socialism ("national socialisms"JLand communism
 (''national communisms'.').
 8.     The communist and labor parties directing socialist
 countries play a dominant role in the unification of these
 countries.  Therefore, the conference of Representatives of
 Communist and Labor Parties of Socialist Countries held in
 Moscow on November 14- 16,  1957, was a development of his-
 torical significance.
 9.    "The Soviet Union has been historically formed into the
 center of the Communist movement of the world.  The in-
 destructible camp of socialist states is led by the Soviet
 Union."  (p. 29).
 10.   The manner in which revolution occurs in individual
 countries of the socialist camp differs in each case.  This
 leads to variations in the political forms assumed by the
 leadership of society, as well as in the economic methods
 used for the transformation of society.
 11.   Individual countries belonging to the socialist camp are
 not isolated in their development but mature in close com-
 munion and coordination with other socialist countries.  The
 development of the Communist regime proceeds under many
 forms but is unique in its social and economic contents.
 12.   The countries of socialism are interlinked by the form
 of. authority which they enjoy ("Dictatorship of the proletariat").

 13.   There is complete "unity of views and actions" between
 the Communist party of China and the CPSU.
 14.   The common enemy of the countries of the socialist camp
 is "revisionism. It
 15.   "Proletarian internationalism" is the basis of interrela-
 tions between socialist countries.
 16.   The fortification of the socialist camp is the fortification
 of socialism as a whole.  "In the unity and solidarity of Marx-
 ist-Leninist parties lies the guaranty for the further victories
 of the world socialist system. " (p. 317).
 "MIROVAYA SOTSIALISTICHESKAYA SISTEMA
 KHOZYAISTVA, " a publication of the Institute of Economy of
 the Academy of Sciences of the USSR issued about the end of
 1958, is a compilation of instructions covering Communist
 propaganda and information.  The contents are, apparently,
 the outcome of conferences of the institutes of economy of the
 USSR and the People's Democracies, held in Warsaw in 1956,
 and subsequently reviewed at a conference of economists of
 Socialist countries which met in Moscow on November Z6-30,
 1957.  The book includes five studies by Soviet authors (K.
 OSTROVITYANOV, L. GATOVSKI, A. KOZIK, A. ALEKSEEV,
 V. KUVARIN, and A. LOSHCHAKOV), and twelve by economists
 of other countries in the Socialist camp.  These countries are:
 YUI GUAN-YUAN (China), B. MINTS (Poland), G. KO1 MEN
 (East Germany), two studies by V. KAIGL and K. SVOBODA-
 L. SHPIRK (Czechoslovakia), I. FRISH (Hungary), N. N.
 CONSTANTINESCU (Rumania), T. CHERNOKOLEV (Bulgaria),
 Kh. MARA (Albania), LI MEN SO (Korea), N. ZHAGVARAL
 (Mongolia), and BUI KONG CHING (Vietnam).  In substance
 all these studies reflect the economic program set forth by
 the "Declaration of the Conference of Representatives of Com-
 munist and Labor Parties of the Socialist Countries" (Novem-
 ber 14-16,  1957).

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100150001-1
 The following theses serve as foundation to the entire
 compilation:
 1.     The October Revolution ended the existence of a single
 and all-embracing capitalist system.  A new socialist system
 of economy arose and was developed in the USSR.
 2.     The successes' of socialism in the USSR demonstrated
 the advantages of the socialist over the capitalist system and
 created in the Soviet Union conditions favorable to the con-
 struction of a material foundation for communism, as well as
 a base of production.
 3.     The formation of a Soviet Socialist state led to socialist
 changes in other European and Asiatic countries and launched
 the formation of a "world socialist system" now developing on
 the basis of economic socialist laws identical to those operat-
 ing in the USSR.
 4.     The interrelationship existing between the countries of
 the socialist system presents a new type of international re-
 lationship built on principles of economic cooperation, brother-
 ly mutual assistance, and socialist (proletarian) international-
 ism.                        The coordination of plans of people's economy lies at the
 base of economic cooperation and has resulted in the establish-
 ment of a new international market of socialist countries.  A
 decisive premise to the successful construction of socialism
 in all countries belonging to the socialist system is the inviol-
 able unity of these countries.
 5.     The interests of the peoples adhering to the socialist
 system are tied in with the fundamental interests of the toilers
 of the whole world.  The expansion of economic ties between
 the socialist system and countries poorly developed from the
 economic point of view is of the utmost importance.
 6.     The construction of socialism in the countries within the
 socialist system is founded on important laws common, oblig-
 atory, and inherent to each country which is in process of

 building socialism; they include state centralism and single-
 minded planification of people's economy, as well as constant
 strengthening of the unity existing between the countries of the
 socialist camp.  ("It is impossible to march singly to Com-
 munism" .- Khruehiche:v).  An important role in achieving
 this unity is played by the distribution of labor between states,
 and by specialization and cooperation of industry among the
 interconnected branches of the economy of countries adhering
 to the socialist system.
 7.     The successes of the "world socialist system" exercise
 increasing influence over the international environment and
 multiply to an ever greater extent the number of followers of
 socialism in capitalist countries.  "The forces of the socialist
 world are not limited to the territories and the population of
 countries within the socialist camp." (P. 89).
 8.   Economic collaboration between the countries adhering
 to the socialist camp is developing according to principles
 identical with those which inspired the co-friendship -
 sodruzhestvo - of the peoples of the USSR.
 9.   The principal economic task of the Soviet Union which is
 "to overtake and surpass in output per head of the population
 the more highly developed capitalist countries" is the nsain
 condition for the further expansion and fortification of social-
 ism in all the countries of the socialist camp.
 10.   The experience of the Soviet Union in the construction
 of a socialist society and the aid which socialist countries find
 therein are a decisive factor in promoting the construction and
 successes of socialism throughout the socialist camp.
 11.   Of exceptional. significance for a more rapid develop-
 ment of industrial forces in all socialist countries is the con-
 tinuous perfecting of the forms of economic collaboration, as
 well as a more profound specialization and cooperation of
 industry within the interconnected branches of the people's

 economy, as stipulated by the decisions of the conference of
 representatives of the Communist and labor parties of coun-
 tries who participated in the Council for Economic Mutual
 Assistance (CEMA) on May 20-25,  1958.
 "VOPROSY VNESHNEI POLITIKI STRAN SOTSIALISTI-
 CHESKOGO LAGERYA" published by the Institute for Interna-
 tional Relations of the USSR at the end of 1958 presents the
 first attempt in Soviet'.literature to show the foreign policy of
 the Socialist "camp" as forming an integral whole.  The book
 contains thirteen separate articles, two of which (N. PAVLOV
 and A. GRIGORIEV-A. POPOV) are devoted to the foreign
 policy of the USSR and socialist camp as one unit, and the
 remaining eleven (M. KHOSHEV, M. GOSTEV, V. LARIN,
 M. SATURIN, N. SIDOROV, L. KUTAKOV, V. LEZIN, V.
 TITKOV, G. ROZANOV, N. LEBEDEV, and P. YANIN) exam-
 ine the principles followed in foreign policy by the individual
 countries forming the socialist camp.
 "Unity of the socialist stratum" which is dependent upon
 the regularity in the construction process of socialism and
 upon the application of the principles of "proletarian interna-
 tionalism" lies at the foundation of the foreign policy line
 maintained by the socialist "camp. IT 'The Declaration of the
 Conference of the Representatives of Communist and Labor
 Parties of the Socialist Countries" maybe regarded as a con-
 crete expression of such unity.
 In the foreign policy whicih it follows, the socialist
 '"camp" finds support in certain principles including:
 (1)  Peaceful coexistence and economic competition of
 the "two systems. ""
 (2) Assistance to countries which are fighting to
 fortify their national independence and sovereignty.
 (3)  Aid to underdeveloped countries.
 (4)  Work for peace.

 principles of the rule of law,
 free elections and individual
 liberty are a British inheritance
 which all wish to share and to
 preserve,.
 All members are under the
 monolithic rule of the "dic-
 tatorship of the proletariat. "
 Their political affinities are
 forced upon them by the Com-
 munist parties which, in turn,
 are guided by the doctrines
 of Marxism-Leninism. There
 are no liberties; there are no
 free elections.  They must
 follow the Soviet Party line
 implicitly.
 The future of the Commonwealth
 is uncertain.  No member will
 sacrifice what it considers its
 national interests; the Union of
 South Africa's policy, for exam-
 ple, may make it eventually in-
 compatible with the multi-racial
 commonwealth.  So long as there
 are no major crises, the Com-
 monwealth will continue to bene-
 fit.it:s.members, but in a world
 crisis a split may occur between
 the Western-oriented and the
 neutralist-minded members.
 Although there is at present
 no organizational control
 apparatus, the "Socialist
 Commonwealth" is held to--
 gether by common ideology
 and economic dependency on
 the USSR to an extent which
 makes secession impossible.
 It is possible that this modus
 operandi will suffice for the
 time being, but the establish-
 ment of a tight-knit organiza-
 tional superstructure in the
 future also is a distince pos-
 sibility.  So long as the two
 great Communist states, pre-
 dominantly the USSR, are
 still powerful executors of
 the Communist heritage, the
 "Commonwealth" ties probably
 will tend to become stronger.
