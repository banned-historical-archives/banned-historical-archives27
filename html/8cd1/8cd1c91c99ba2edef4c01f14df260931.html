 Managing Change        Perspective: Gorbachev's Program Builds Momentum
 Despite stiff resistance from the bureaucracy, Gorbachev's
 ambitious program for "restructuring" the Soviet system has gained
 demonstrable momentum in Politburo decisions and government
 legislation since the Soviet party congress.
 Gorbachev's freedom to maneuver is constrained by the Politburo,
 which must endorse all his policy initiatives and ultimately has the
 power to remove him. Of the dozen full Politburo members, a
 minority are probably loyal supporters, another minority old-guard
 skeptics, and the central majority a mix of allies and independents
 who must be persuaded on the merits of each issue. At this critical
 juncture in consolidating his power, further progress on his agenda
 probably depends on his ability to reshape the Politburo and make it
 more responsive to his will.
 Gorbachev's incremental approach to reform limits our ability to
 predict how far he will be willing, or able, to push his ideas. If
 pushed to their extremes, they would create a radically different
 Soviet economy. The evidence thus far, however, suggests that his
 efforts to improve the system will be something of a trial-and-error
 process and that the dimensions of the reform ultimately will be
 determined by a combination of the economic results he obtains and
 his own political abilities.

 General Secretary Gorbachev has assigned a high priority to
 restructuring the government, a task that he views as essential to the
 success of his economic revitalization program. He has taken steps
 to gain more effective control over the main direction of the
 economy, while at the same time leaving more of the day-to-day
 management to the local and enterprise levels. New interministerial
 coordinating bodies have been established for key sectors of the
 economy. The central bureaucracy is being reduced, and some
 layers of management are being eliminated. These measures should
 help the regime focus on broad economic tasks but will do little to
 reduce the temptation for ministries to interfere in enterprise
 management.
 General Secretary Gorbachev has launched a far-reaching policy of
 glasnost (openness) and cultural revitalization to counter the
 attraction of "bourgeois" culture and Western propaganda, to
 overcome widespread apathy and alienation, and to increase his own
 freedom for maneuver in addressing the nation's problems. He is
 meeting resistance from conservatives among media officials,
 cultural figures, and midlevel bureaucrats, but so far there are no
 signs of serious disagreement at the top level. Expanding the limits
 of the permissible in culture and propaganda harbors major risks for
 the regime and for Gorbachev personally. On the other hand, a
 crackdown would risk killing the esprit Gorbachev wants to foster
 and might lead to greater popular cynicism than existed before.

 Gorbachev's Economic Program: Monitoring Progress
 In its efforts to revitalize economic performance, the Soviet regime
 has focused on improving the existing system and temporized on the
 need for politically risky basic economic reforms. Soviet leaders,
 however, cannot afford to await the full impact of current initiatives
 before deciding on whether further changes are required. They are
 likely to base their judgments on demonstrated progress in a few
 critical areas. We have identified a number of "progress indicators"
 with respect to four major themes of Gorbachev's economic strategy:
 industrial modernization, economic efficiency, economic discipline,
 and consumer welfare.
 Other Topics          The Dilemma of Moscow's Policy To Curtail
 Illegal Private Activity
 Moscow's latest crackdown on the second economy has created
 confusion among officials and the populace and has increased
 consumer frustration by making privately provided consumer goods
 and services harder to obtain. New legislation on individual labor
 activity attempts to clarify the situation by specifying what types of
 activities may legally be pursued; however, it contains little that is
 new.
 Viewpoint             Ligachev, Gorbachev, and the Configuration of Power
 in the Current Soviet Leadership
 Historically, the relationship between the number-two man in the
 Soviet party leadership and the General Secretary has been marked
 by tension and competition. Although Gorbachev's relationship to
 his second secretary, Yegor Ligachev, is probably not as
 antagonistic as that of his immediate predecessors, Ligachev
 appears to be an independent political force, seeking to limit
 Gorbachev's power.

 Managing Change
 Perspective: Gorbachev's Program Builds Momentum                25X1
 When the 27th Soviet Party Congress adjourned in March 1986, General
 Secretary Gorbachev had already moved with unprecedented speed to
 reshape the senior leadership, but his ability to translate personnel changes
 into action on his domestic agenda remained uncertain. Since then, his
 ambitious program for "restructuring" the Soviet system has gained
 demonstrable momentum in Politburo decisions and government legisla-
 tion. He clearly has encountered more resistance than he anticipated,
 however, and that resistance is reflected in the kind of changes he has been
 able to make in economic management-highly impressive when compared
 to the accomplishments of his recent predecessors, but something less than
 the "radical reform" he has said is needed to revitalize the economy (see
 "Gorbachev's `Radical Reform': A Progress Report").
 The pace of domestic policy initiatives has picked up noticeably since the
 congress, and the regime has already taken initial steps to implement most
 of Gorbachev's directives:
 ? To help shift the bureaucracy's focus from micromanagement to strategic
 planning and coordination, central coordinating bodies have been estab-
 lished to oversee the energy, construction, "social development," and
 foreign trade sectors, in addition to those for agro-industry and machine
 building announced before the congress (see "Restructuring the Govern-
 ment Apparatus").
 ? In response to Gorbachev's criticism of the wage-leveling trend of the
 Brezhnev years, a reform was enacted in August that is designed to
 widen substantially the disparity in wages between workers who perform
 well and those who do not.

 ? Gorbachev's promise to provide greater scope for individual initiative has
 already brought new legislation sanctioning a limited expansion of
 business opportunities for individuals and small groups outside the state
 sector, especially in consumer goods and services. An October decree
 allows the formation of profit-sharing cooperatives to collect and sell
 recycled materials, and a new law passed in November sanctions
 moonlighting by individuals in a range of activities from cottage
 industries to medical services.
 ? An ambitious five-year legislative program was announced in August. If
 implemented, it will address most of the economic and social problem
 areas Gorbachev has identified. The program includes specific target
 deadlines designed to keep up the pressure for further action.
 One of the most dramatic developments has been the new momentum    25X1
 acquired by his glasnost (openness) policy, which is making the Soviet
 cultural scene more lively than at any time since Khrushchev's cultural
 "thaw" in the 1950s. Films, books, and plays are now being released that
 deal explicitly with such sensitive issues as Stalin's crimes, and commenta-
 tors are openly discussing contemporary problems, such as drug abuse, that
 were once taboo (see "Gorbachev's New Directions in Propaganda and
 Culture").                                                     25X1
 Signs of progress on the issue he placed squarely at the center of his
 agenda-economic performance-have further strengthened his position.
 Industrial production as a whole is expected to grow faster this year than at
 any other time since the mid-1970s, and agricultural output seems headed
 for a recovery from its two-year slump.
 Gorbachev also has established increased personal control over foreign
 policy decision making during this period. He has largely succeeded in
 putting his own foreign policy team in place and has vigorously pushed
 policy initiatives that depart from previous Soviet diplomatic practice.
 Signs of Resistance
 Despite these successes, Gorbachev's own comments
 indicate that he has run into more resistance
 throughout the system than he initially anticipated. His frustration with
 this resistance has been evident in his increasingly bitter public criticisms
 of the party and government bureaucracies. The core of Gorbachev's
 immediate problem is the vast party and government apparatus that has

 successfully stifled previous efforts to change the system. At the lower
 levels, Gorbachev has had considerable difficulty in making the regional
 party organizations responsive to the demands of the center, thanks in part
 to Brezhnev's lax personnel policies that allowed them to become virtually
 independent fiefdoms.
 Resistance from the bureaucracy is reflected in the economic reform
 decrees that have been issued thus far, which have fallen short of the
 "radical reform" Gorbachev has called for in his speeches. His reforms
 have encountered resistance from ideological conservatives and foot-
 dragging from government bureaucrats worried that the changes he
 proposes will undermine their traditional privileges and status. Gorbachev's
 efforts to restrain the growth of defense spending and modify Soviet
 positions on security issues also have caused            uneasiness
 within the military.
 25X1
 25X1
 one short-term effect of Gorbachev's reforms 25X1
 has been to produce widespread confusion and disarray in the bureaucracy.
 Many Soviet officials         are finding it difficult to adjust to the 25X1
 pressure from Gorbachev for improved performance while trying to follow
 vague and often conflicting new instructions.         25X1
 Such lower-level resistance will become even more significant if Gorba-
 chev's ability to command a consensus at the top is in question. Gorbachev
 still faces a Politburo composed of a few loyalists who support him on most
 issues, a few opponents who tend to object to most of his ideas, and a group
 in the middle whose members are persuaded one way or another on the
 merits of the issue or on the basis of their perceived interests (see
 "Gorbachev and the Politburo").
 The problems Gorbachev is encountering are an inevitable response to the
 changes he is attempting to impose on the system. They have not yet stalled
 his program or diminished his determination to improve the system. He
 acknowledges that he is facing a long-term task that could take "genera-
 tions" to complete. But even his Soviet supporters are concerned that he
 will need to show new gains against his opponents soon if he is to sustain
 the momentum for change he has generated.

 Looking Ahead
 Several developments over the next few months will provide clues to
 Gorbachev's progress in dealing with the resistance:
 ? Adherence to published target dates for reform legislation and how
 closely that legislation reflects his ideas. Those targets have been met so
 far, and significant delays or the passage of legislation that lacks
 substance would signal increased resistance.
 ? Trends in the reform debate. A resurgence of publications by conserva-
 tive officials, who have been rendered largely silent by the current
 political atmosphere, would suggest that Gorbachev's reforms are coming
 under increased attack in the Politburo.
 ? The momentum of Gorbachev's glasnost campaign. A retreat from the
 decision to deal more openly with sensitive issues would suggest a
 strengthened position for the conservatives, who believe such openness
 could undermine the regime's legitimacy, and would be a serious blow to
 Gorbachev's effort to attack the root problems of the system.
 ? How vigorously Gorbachev's social policies are implemented. If his
 antialcoholism measures eventually are ignored or significantly scaled
 back, for example, the failure of that campaign could reflect an erosion of
 his political strength.
 Gorbachev also will need to demonstrate progress in meeting his goals of 25X1
 modernizing Soviet industry, increasing economic efficiency and discipline,
 and improving the quality, quantity, and variety of consumer goods and
 services. Published Soviet economic data,
 will help determine whether Gorbachev is         25X1
 obtaining the kind of early positive returns in these areas that he will need
 to sustain the current momentum of his economic program (see "Gorba-
 chev's Economic Program: Monitoring Progress").

 Gorbachev and the Politburo
 General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev has made rap-
 id progress consolidating power and appears to be in a
 strong position, but, like other post-Stalin Soviet
 leaders, he faces major constraints on his freedom to
 maneuver. The most important of these come from
 the Politburo, which must endorse all of his policy
 initiatives and ultimately has the power to remove him
 if he acts too independently. At present, few of its
 members are politically beholden to Gorbachev, and
 there can be little doubt that in many cases he must
 Leadership Changes
 Gorbachev has not yet made a number of leadership
 changes that he surely wants. His protege Vsevolod
 Murakhovskiy, head of the agro-industrial bureaucra-
 cy since November 1985, is the only one of the three
 first deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers who
 does not have at least a candidate seat on the
 Politburo. Gorbachev's ally Boris Yel'tsin has not
 attained the full Politburo membership enjoyed by his
 predecessors as Moscow party boss.
 bend to its collective will.
 Although as its chairman the General Secretary has a
 distinct advantage in influencing its decisions, the
 Politburo operates collectively with each full member
 having an equal vote. Unlike Brezhnev's Politburo,
 which was packed with his cronies, Gorbachev's Polit-
 buro is made up of mostly independent-minded lead-
 ers who are likely to have their own agendas that
 sometimes diverge from the party leader's agenda.
 Few members are politically dependent on Gorba-
 chev; so he must forge a consensus among them. A
 number of comments by Politburo members suggest
 that this is not always easy:
 ? At the 27th CPSU Congress Yegor Ligachev noted
 the "frank exchange of opinions" that now takes
 place in the Politburo, and Eduard Shevardnadze
 stressed the "freedom to discuss all issues."
 ? Its decisions are argued vigorously.
 Gorbachev mentioned "conflicts"
 Regional Resistance
 Regional leaders who are members of the Politburo
 have shown a surprising degree of independence from
 the center. Under Gorbachev this was dramatically
 demonstrated by the difficulty he had ousting former
 Moscow party boss Viktor Grishin (see inset). Similar-
 ly, Gorbachev's success in removing Kazakh party
 leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev from his republic post
 was marred by severe political disturbances. And
 Ukrainian party boss Vladimir Shcherbitskiy remains
 in place despite Gorbachev's apparent efforts over the
 past year to undermine him.
 Leadership Differences
 There have been persistent indications of differences
 within the leadership over key issues. At the 27th
 Party Congress there were signs of differences over
 elite privileges. In May                     Gor-
 bachev could not initially win approval for making the
 details of the Chernobyl' nuclear accident public.
 Over the past year there have been some hints of
 dissatisfaction with Gorbachev's policy toward the
 United States.

 The constraints imposed on Gorbachev by his Politbu-

 Probably no member of the Politburo can be charac-

 Power and Its Limits:
 The Grishin Affair
 Gorbachev's struggle to remove Viktor Grishin illus-
 trates the problem the General Secretary has in
 exercising his power over Politburo members who
 control large regional party organizations.
 On 24 December 1985, Grishin was removed as chief
 of the Moscow City Party Committee at an acrimoni-
 ous city plenum. Several Soviet contacts of the US
 Embassy in Moscow, some citing eyewitness infor-
 mants, reported that there was a sharp conflict at the
 plenum between Grishin and Gorbachev. Grishin ap-
 parently defied Gorbachev's efforts to remove him
 and mobilized his supporters to block Gorbachev's
 candidate Boris Yel'tsin, forcing the latter to sum-
 mon Gorbachev to help. Even after Gorbachev an-
 nounced his backing for Yel'tsin, Grishin still got
 chev later told a foreign Communist leader about his
 "sharp confrontation" with Grishin, noting that be-
 fore being removed Grishin had boasted that the
 Moscow party organization would not repudiate his
 leadership.
 Although Gorbachev won an important victory-
 removing a member of the Brezhnev old guard and
 promoting a supporter in his stead-limits to Gorba-
 chev's power were revealed. First, hundreds of party
 members witnessed defiance of the General Secretary
 instead of deferential obedience. Second, Gorbachev
 found it not so simple to attack a Politburo member
 on his own turf.
 The latter point helps account for the prolonged
 survival of old guard members Shcherbitskiy and
 Kunayev. Ukrainian and Kazakh Central Committee
 members, bound to those party leaders by longstand-
 ing close ties, face removal themselves after the
 leaders step down, and can be expected to put up stiff
 resistance.
 likely Shevardnadze and Lev Zaykov. At the other
 end of the spectrum, the Brezhnev holdovers-Gro-
 myko, Shcherbitskiy, and, for the time being, Kun-
 ayev-have good reason to worry about Gorbachev's
 assault on the old guard and are likely to be most
 skeptical of Gorbachev's programs. The majority,
 however, appear to be a mix of allies and indepen-
 dents who must be persuaded on the merits of the
 issues or on the basis of their perceived interests.
 Some of the members of this group may find it in
 their interest to keep Brezhnev holdovers in the
 Politburo, thus increasing their own influence as the
 critical swing votes in the center.
 Loyalists
 Lev Zaykov. All evidence indicates that party secre-
 tary Zaykov, who is responsible for economic policy
 generally and defense industry policy particularly, is a
 loyal supporter of Gorbachev. He is the only full
 member of the Politburo to have gotten all his central
 leadership promotions under Gorbachev. Although
 there are no past career ties between them, Gorbachev
 oversaw his installation as Leningrad party chief in
 June 1983. Gorbachev returned to Leningrad on an
 inspection tour in May 1985 and praised Zaykov's
 accomplishments. He was apparently impressed
 enough with his performance to promote him to the
 Secretariat two months later.
 With his promotion to full Politburo membership in
 March 1986, Zaykov became a political counter-
 weight to the party's number-two man, Yegor Liga-
 chev. Zaykov has publicly echoed Gorbachev's main
 policy preferences. In a tour of Irkutsk last June, for
 example, he declared that defense industries would
 have to help the civilian sector to retool, and he said
 that five-year-plan targets would have to be made
 "tougher" and the deadlines for meeting them short-
 ened.
 Eduard Shevardnadze. More than any other Politbu-
 ro member, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze appears
 to rely on Gorbachev's protection and patronage, and
 there is no question that he is a loyal supporter of the

 General Secretary. Cut off from his home base of
 Georgia and an interloper at the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs, Shevardnadze has no independent political
 base. Before he became party leader, Gorbachev
 regularly vacationed in Georgia, and Shevardnadze
 has indicated to Western officials that he and Gorba-
 chev have been friends for a long time.
 By making Shevardnadze the Foreign Minister and a
 full Politburo member in July 1985, Gorbachev also
 gained a strong advocate for his domestic policy
 agenda. Under Brezhnev, Shevardnadze was an out-
 spoken advocate for domestic change and turned his
 republic into a testing ground for economic, agricul-
 tural, and management reforms, many of which are
 now being promoted by the Gorbachev regime on a
 national scale.
 Allies and Independents
 All the members of this group entered the Politburo
 after Brezhnev's death. Although they probably share
 a perception that the problems they inherited must be
 addressed, there are indications that they may differ
 on what needs to be done. As Ligachev, the leading
 figure in this group, pointed out at the 27th Congress,
 the Politburo is no longer willing to accept "delays
 and procrastination" in addressing problems. Mem-
 bers of this center group are likely to overcome
 differences and rally behind Gorbachev when he
 presents proposals they think will work, but they must
 be convinced of the merits.
 Yegor Ligachev. Ligachev became "second secretary"
 of the party under Gorbachev and appears to support
 him on many issues. As the number-two man in the
 party, he is the most obvious potential alternative to
 Gorbachev. If he were trying to challenge Gorbachev,
 we would expect him to distance himself from the
 more controversial aspects of Gorbachev's program.
 Instead, in the key areas he oversees-cadres, ideolo-
 gy, and culture-he appears to be on board.

 Secret
 At the same time, some of Ligachev's remarks should
 reassure conservatives. At a social science conference
 in October he criticized Soviet writers for flirting with
 religious themes and warned against allowing slander-
 ers and demagogues to take advantage of the new
 openness. In the October Revolution address, he
 appeared to rule out proposals being advanced by
 reformers to allow unemployment.
 Nikolay Ryzhkov. Premier Ryzhkov appears to fully
 support the steps taken so far in the economic sphere,
 but in his public statements he has not gone as far as
 Gorbachev in discussing further measures, suggesting
 that he may be more cautious about more radical
 economic reforms. As a former economic planner, he
 may have an appreciation for the difficulties involved
 in such a course. Although he achieved his current
 position under Gorbachev, as head of the government
 he has had an opportunity to build an independent
 power base.
 At the same time, Ryzhkov has played a key role in
 Gorbachev's efforts to wrest control of the ministerial
 bureaucracy from the old guard. After being appoint-
 ed Premier in September 1985, he oversaw a massive
 purge of the Council of Ministers, including nine of 12
 deputy premiers, and 40 other officials of ministry
 rank among the 90 ministries and state committees.
 Ryzhkov's public rhetoric on ministry shortcomings is
 often tougher than Gorbachev's. At the Supreme
 Soviet session in June 1986, for example, he was
 blunter than Gorbachev in attacking government offi-
 cials for blocking change and spoke more forcefully on
 the need for restructuring economic management.
 Mikhail Solomentsev. Party Control Committee
 Chairman Mikhail Solomentsev probably supports
 Gorbachev on issues of party discipline and economic
 reform, but he is not beholden to him, having obtained
 his position under Andropov. Under Solomentsev's
 charge, the Party Control Committee has been a
 major weapon in Gorbachev's discipline campaign,
 helping to bring the ministries and regional party
 organizations into line. In August 1986, for example,
 Solomentsev's committee took strong action to disci-
 pline lagging ministries in the machine-building sec-
 tor: two ministers were replaced shortly after the
 publication of its findings on their shortcomings.
 Solomentsev appears to have long seen the need to
 break out of the Brezhnevian economic straitjacket.
 One emigre claimed that under Brezhnev Soloment-
 sev was frustrated by the inability to examine alterna-
 tives during the planning process and once asked an
 institute to draw up an alternate national economic
 plan. At the 27th Congress, Solomentsev was the only
 leader to declare that the Brezhnev leadership should
 have seen the bankruptcy of its extensive economic
 development as early as "the end of the 1960s," rather
 than the late 1970s cited by Gorbachev. Nevertheless, 25X1
 his age (73) and experience give him reason to sympa-
 thize with the old guard on other issues.
 Vitaliy Vorotnikov. RSFSR Premier Vitaliy Vorotni-
 kov owes his present position to Andropov. Some
 Soviet officials expected Vorotnikov to become pre-
 mier when Tikhonov retired. He was also passed over
 for the post of senior economic secretary that went to
 Zaykov. That Vorotnikov was selected for neither of
 these positions suggests that he is not as close to
 Gorbachev as he was to Andropov.
 Nevertheless, there have been no reports of friction
 between him and Gorbachev. Before his elevation to
 the central leadership, Vorotnikov spearheaded a
 drive to clean up Krasnodar Kray, indicating that he
 represents a break with Brezhnev-era toleration of
 corruption and excessive privilege.
 Chebrikov's elevation to full Politburo membership at
 the first opportunity after Gorbachev came to power
 may have been a reward for this support.

 Secret
 Despite Chebrikov's apparent support, Gorbachev
 may eventually want to put his own man in the
 sensitive post of KGB chairman. There have been
 several recent indications of possible friction between
 the two. Two well-informed, third-country contacts of
 the US Embassy in Moscow independently said re-
 cently that Chebrikov and Gorbachev had become
 opponents. One said that the source of disagreement
 was Gorbachev's plans for economic reorganization,
 which might weaken internal security controls. C
 Chebrikov may be trans-
 new policy directions. With each younger member
 brought into the Politburo, their positions grow less
 secure.
 ferred to another post.
 Geydar Aliyev. First Deputy Premier Aliyev may
 have more in common with the Brezhnevite old guard
 than with Gorbachev. One knowledgeable Soviet told
 a Western embassy officer that Aliyev initially hung
 back in the March 1985 Politburo discussions of
 Chernenko's successor as party leader, supporting
 Gorbachev only when he saw the discussion going in
 his favor. Aliyev has kept a low profile since Gorba-
 chev took over, not taking a strong stand on any policy
 issue.
 Although he was made a full Politburo member under
 Andropov,                                 his
 promotion from Azerbaijan party boss to the central
 leadership had been agreed on under Brezhnev. =
 Aliyev made lavish gifts to the
 Brezhnev family. Some contacts of the US Embassy
 in Moscow assert that a Pravda article early this year
 attacking sycophancy and fawning servility was aimed
 at Aliyev and had been written on orders from
 someone in Gorbachev's Secretariat.
 Aliyev may be dropped from the
 leadership. He was the only full Politburo member
 who did not speak at the 27th Congress, and in recent
 group appearances he has slipped in protocol ranking.
 The Old Guard
 Other than Gorbachev himself, Gromyko, Kunayev,
 and Shcherbitskiy are the only remaining Politburo
 members from the Brezhnev era. To them, Gorbachev
 is a newcomer. Because they are what is left of the
 Brezhnev leadership, they are more closely associated
 with its policies and therefore less likely to support
 Andrey Gromyko. President Gromyko apears to have
 an ambivalent view of Gorbachev: on the one hand,
 his speech nominating Gorbachev as party leader in
 March 1985 indicated that he sees the need for a
 vigorous national leader; on the other hand, his
 remarks at the 27th Congress suggest he also sees a     25X1
 danger in moving too fast.                              25X1
 25X1
 Although Gromyko may generally back Gorbachev's
 policies of openness and discipline, he has repeatedly
 stressed the need for unity in the face of hostile forces
 abroad and warned that the current bold exposures of
 scandal may be viewed by the West as signs of
 weakness. Under Andropov,
 Gromyko objected
 to wholesale revelations of corruption in high places
 and was influential in slowing the replacement of
 offending officials.
 Gromyko also has reason to object to Gorbachev's
 indirect criticism of his tenure as Foreign Minister.
 His reputation was sullied by Gorbachev's attack on
 the foreign policy apparatus at a closed party confer-
 ence in May 1986.

 As long as he remains in the leadership, Gromyko is 25X1
 likely to be viewed as an elder statesman and a 25X1
 rallying point for the old guard. His role as their
 protector was dramatically underscored by official
 lists indicating that former Politburo members
 Tikhonov and Grishin now serve on Gromyko's staff.
 Vladimir Shcherbitskiy. As the most obvious vestige
 of Brezhnev's Dnepropetrovsk clique, Ukrainian party
 boss Shcherbitskiy is a logical target for removal by
 Gorbachev.                        Gorbachev    25X1
 would like to remove him, and articles in the central
 press have highlighted shortcomings in some of his

 subordinates and, thus, implicitly criticized his leader-
 ship. But his methodical implementation of Ukrainian
 economic and industrial programs that support the
 main lines of Gorbachev's policies, plus his strong
 leadership of that republic, make him a difficult
 target. Soviet officials in Moscow have told the US
 Embassy that Shcherbitskiy in fact has arrived at a
 private understanding with Gorbachev on his contin-
 ued tenure.
 Nevertheless, Shcherbitskiy's public remarks suggest
 he differs with Gorbachev on consumer price subsi-
 dies, defense policy, and East-West relations. Further-
 more, Shcherbitskiy's protection of his Ukrainian
 party lieutenants has at times conveyed the impres-
 sion of defiance. For example, he defended the Cher-
 kassy Oblast party leader who had been criticized
 directly by Gorbachev and later in Pravda for his
 delay in reinstating a local official fired for using
 innovative methods.
 Dinmukhamed Kunayev. Kunayev's removal as Ka-
 zakh First Secretary in December 1986 makes his
 removal from the Politburo a foregone conclusion, but
 at this writing he has not been officially removed from
 the latter. Kunayev, like Shcherbitskiy, is a former
 Brezhnev crony. He ran his republic as a personal
 fiefdom for over 20 years, allowing the growth of
 nepotism, laxity, and corruption. The long delay in
 removing him-almost a year-after serious criticism
 in the press demonstrates that he had a solid base of
 support in the republic              suggests that
 his supporters instigated the riots that erupted when
 he was removed.
 Gorbachev has emerged as-the most forceful party
 leader in over 20 years, but he is still at a critical
 juncture in consolidating his power. Further progress
 on his agenda probably depends on his ability to
 reshape the Politburo and make it more responsive to
 his will. There are a number of directions the leader-
 ship situation could take:
 ? Gains by Gorbachev. Gorbachev will be working
 hard to increase his power in the Politburo by
 adding supporters and removing members who op-
 pose him. If he succeeds in bringing Yel'tsin or some
 junior members of the Secretariat like Anatoliy
 Dobrynin, Georgiy Razumovskiy, or Aleksandr Ya-
 kovlev into full Politburo membership, prospects for
 pushing his agenda forward will improve.
 ? Curtailment of power. Gorbachev may be blocked in
 his future efforts to change the Politburo more to his
 liking, making it more difficult to advance his
 agenda. If he does not achieve some results from his
 policy initiatives over the next few years, Politburo
 apprehensions and disagreements could increase,
 resulting in curtailment of his authority, increased
 collectivity in the leadership, and a slowdown or
 diversion of his program. Bureaucratic resistance at
 lower levels would increase if officials perceived
 fluidity at the top.
 ? Outright removal. If Gorbachev insists on pushing
 programs that are not producing results and are
 beginning to create serious negative consequences,
 such as economic disruptions, or if the openness and
 criticism he advocates begin to reduce the regime's
 ability to control society, Politburo members might
 join together to remove him. We see no evidence,
 however, that Politburo members currently look to
 Ligachev or any other potential successor. For the
 time being Gorbachev appears
 "irreplaceable."

 Gorbachev's "Radical Reform":
 A Progress Report
 Taken together, the management reform decisions
 issued since the party congress in March 1986 give
 Soviet policy a strong push in directions that Gorba-
 chev and reform-minded economists have recom-
 mended. But they also reveal the magnitude and
 complexity of the challenge Gorbachev faces and the
 degree of political compromise required in what he
 himself has described as a long, "step by step"
 process.
 Gorbachev's call for a "radical reform" of Soviet
 economic management at the party congress marked
 the first time such a dramatic remedy had been
 prescribed by any Soviet official in recent years. In
 the months since the congress, he has further escalat-
 ed his rhetoric, comparing the reform to a "revolu-
 tion" and describing it as a major turning point in
 Soviet history. His strong commitment to reform also
 is reflected in a changed political environment that
 has turned economists whose ideas were once consid-
 ered outside the mainstream into establishment
 figures.
 Precisely what Gorbachev means by "radical reform,"
 however, remains unclear. He has described the goals
 of his reform only in the broadest terms, calling it an
 attempt to make the economy "function dynamically,
 like a self-regulating system." Abel Aganbegyan, one
 of his chief economic advisers, has used similar
 language, telling Westerners that the reform will
 eliminate the "dictatorship of the producer" and
 make the economy more responsive to demand.F_
 Such statements make the thrust of Gorbachev's
 reform effort fairly straightforward but tell us little
 about its intended dimensions. When combined with
 his references to the primacy of centralized planning
 and the continued adoption of taut plans, they leave
 considerable ambiguities about how large a role mar-
 ket forces might be allowed to play and how much
 "self-regulation" is to be introduced. And Gorba-
 chev's assertion that the reform is to be conducted "on
 the march, as we go along" suggests that he himself
 has not yet fully come to grips with such questions.
 Gorbachev's Vision
 Although Gorbachev has yet to present a detailed
 blueprint for reform, he already has embraced many
 of the reform economists' ideas and called for a
 number of changes that, when pieced together, pro-
 vide a clearer picture of the kind of reform he has in
 mind. Briefly stated, the changes he has been advocat-
 ing would:
 ? Streamline the central bureaucracy and shift its
 focus from day-to-day management to strategic
 planning and coordination.
 ? Increase the authority and responsibility of industri-
 al and agricultural enterprises.
 ? Improve workers' incentives.
 ? Increase the flexibility of prices.
 ? Expand the role of personal initiative in both the
 state and private sectors.
 Enacting the Reform
 An impressive number of economic management deci-
 sions have been issued since the party congress, and
 almost all of them bear this Gorbachev imprint (see
 inset). Few of these decisions go as far as the bold
 ideas advanced in his speeches, however, suggesting
 that he may have initially underestimated both the
 complexity of the issues involved and the bureaucra-
 cy's capacity for resistance to change.
 Reorganizing the Bureaucracy. A cornerstone of Gor-
 bachev's reform effort has been his attempt to reorga-
 nize and streamline the central economic bureaucra-
 cy. His insistence that this bureaucracy shift its focus
 from day-to-day management to strategic planning
 and coordination has been reflected in a number of
 organizational changes since the congress. Central
 coordinating bodies-in the form of bureaus, state
 committees, and commissions-have been established

 Key Economic Management Decisions
 Since the Soviet Party Congress
 Establishment of a Fuel and Energy Bureau
 under the Council of Ministers.
 Instructions to speed up the conversion to a two-
 tier management structure in all government
 agencies.
 Creation of a new State Committee for Computer
 Technology and Information Science.
 Decision to allow selected enterprises to engage
 in "wholesale trade" in means of production.
 Decree on improving the management of the
 agro-industrial sector.
 Changes in the management of consumer goods
 production in light industry.
 Decrees prescribing penalties for "unearned
 income. "
 Measures to increase supplies for individual gar-
 den plots.
 Management changes designed to improve the
 quality of industrial output.
 Decisions to expand the financial autonomy ex-
 periments at enterprises in Sumy and Tolyatti to
 encompass additional plants (July, August,
 September).
 Establishment of a new Ministry of Atomic
 Engineering.
 Reorganization of the construction sector.
 Announcement of plans for new legislation during
 1986-90, encompassing a broad range of activi-
 ties from pricing to individual labor.
 September       Reorganization of foreign trade.
 Reform of the wage structure.
 Approval of the financial autonomy experiment
 at the Kuban Agro-Industrial Combine and an
 announcement that 14 similar combines are to be
 established.
 Establishment of a Social Development Bureau
 under the Council of Ministers.
 Regulations authorizing the formation of self-
 financing cooperatives for the collection and uti-
 lization of recycled material.
 November        Law on individual labor activity
 to oversee ministries responsible for energy, construc-
 tion, "social development," and foreign trade. Two
 new organizations-the State Committee for Com-
 puter Technology and Information Science and the
 Ministry of Atomic Energy-also have been estab-
 lished to perform work that previously had been
 scattered among several different agencies.'
 These moves all seem aimed at improving Moscow's    25X1
 ability to coordinate activities in a given economic
 sector, but they also have created yet another man-
 agement layer and, unlike the earlier reorganization
 of the agro-industrial sector, have done little to meet
 Gorbachev's stated goal of paring the size of the
 economic bureaucracy. The agro-industrial reorgani-
 zation, which eliminated a number of ministries,
 proved to be highly disruptive, and hopes for reducing
 the size of the bureaucracy now appear to rest on the
 completion of conversion to a "two-tier" management
 structure advocated by Gorbachev. This step elimi-
 nates the all-union industrial associations-the bu-
 reaucratic layer between the ministries' higher man-
 agement and the production enterprises.
 Increasing Enterprise Autonomy. In his effort to       25X1
 increase the authority and responsibility of industrial
 enterprises, Gorbachev's most significant achievement
 may turn out to be a new law, scheduled to be adopted
 at the next session of the Supreme Soviet, that
 codifies the enterprises' rights and gives them legal
 protection from bureaucratic meddling. (It remains to
 be seen, of course, how strictly the law's provisions
 will be enforced.) Other measures are more limited in
 their coverage. They give selected enterprises the
 right to:
 ? Deal more directly with their suppliers, rather than
 funneling their requirements through authorities in
 Moscow.
 ? Trade directly with foreign firms.
 ? Base their production plans on trade orders from
 customers.
 ' Two important organizational changes preceded the congress. The
 Machine Building Bureau was established in October 1985 to
 oversee the work of the ministries in that sector, and the State
 Agro-Industrial Committee was created the following month by
 merging the ministries and state committees responsible for agricul-

 Although these measures represent a significant step
 toward increased enterprise autonomy, many of them
 apply to only a small number of enterprises or contain
 other restrictions that limit their impact:
 ? The decree allowing enterprises to acquire their
 supplies through "wholesale trade" applies primari-
 ly to enterprises of "nonproduction" ministries, like
 the Ministry of Culture, and excludes most of those
 in the industrial sector, where the supply problems
 Gorbachev has complained about have been most
 acute.
 ? Although 70 enterprises have been given the right to
 engage directly in foreign trade, that right is limited
 to "above-plan" production, and the enterprises can
 keep part of the resulting revenues only if the
 Foreign Trade Bank approves of their intended use
 of the funds.
 ? The decree allowing enterprises to base their pro-
 duction plans on orders from their customers applies
 only to the light industry sector and is weakened by
 its failure to allow enterprises to choose their own
 suppliers and by the continued priority assigned to
 centrally set targets.
 ? Only a limited number of enterprises will switch
 next year to the kind of "complete financial autono-
 my" now exercised by plants in Sumy and Tol'yatti,
 and that autonomy will not include any price-setting
 authority.'
 Decentralizing Agricultural Authority. As part of his
 effort to decentralize authority in the agricultural
 sector, Gorbachev told the party congress that collec-
 tive and state farms should be given greater control
 over the sale of their above-plan production. He
 conveyed the impression that a major reform on this
 issue was in the works by calling it a contemporary
 version of Lenin's "tax in kind"-a historic measure
 'The Volga Automobile Plant in Tol'yatti is allowed to keep 52.5
 percent of its profits, while the Frunze Machine-Building Produc-
 tion Association in Sumy can keep 71 percent. Both have been
 given discretionary authority in the allocation of their profits for

 When the decree was published in March, its chief
 decentralizing effect was to allow local officials to set
 their own targets for produce intended for "local
 supply" and to exchange food products with other
 regions, instead of channeling their requests through
 Moscow. Farms were also given the right to sell an
 increased percentage of their planned production at
 collective farm markets and through consumer coop-
 eratives. The tax-in-kind symbolism was completely
 absent from the language of the decree, however, and
 there were no indications that the state's procurement
 targets would be significantly lowered-a necessary
 step for any major decentralization of production
 controls.
 Another step toward agricultural decentralization
 came in September, when Gorbachev visited the
 Kuban Agro-Industrial Combine-the site of a well-
 known experiment in agricultural self-financing-to
 give the experiment his personal endorsement.' His
 visit was followed by Politburo approval of the experi-
 ment and an announcement that 14 similar combines
 would be formed. Here, too, however, the continua-
 tion of high state procurement targets serves to limit
 the discretionary authority that can be exercised by
 such combines, even on an experimental basis. F_

 will depend on whether the enterprises can raise
 productivity enough to finance these increases from
 their own resources.
 Increasing Price Flexibility. Although Gorbachev has
 never suggested abandoning the system of adminis-
 tered prices, he has called for more "flexible" prices
 that reflect not only the costs of production but also
 other factors such as social utility and demand. The
 agro-industrial decree takes a modest step in that
 direction by allowing republic officials to set their own
 procurement prices for individual farm products, as
 long as the total budget is not exceeded. The timidity
 of this move and the fact that it has had no parallel in
 remains a highly contentious issue.
 pricing policy
 Encouraging Personal Initiative. Gorbachev's en-
 dorsements of family farms, individual garden plots,
 and the broader use of cooperatives in consumer
 services also have offered encouragement to those
 economists who favor an expansion of personal initia-
 tive. His promise to provide greater scope for individ-
 ual initiative has already brought new legislation
 sanctioning expanded business opportunities for indi-
 viduals and small groups outside the state sector,
 especially in consumer goods and services. An Octo-
 ber decree allows the formation of profit-sharing
 cooperatives to collect and sell recycled materials, and
 a new law passed in November sanctions moonlight-
 ing by individuals in a range of activities from cottage
 industries to medical services. The impact of the
 decree on cooperatives is limited, however, by its
 emphasis on the "experimental" nature of the cooper-
 atives and by restrictions on the categories of people
 allowed to form them.' And it remains to be seen
 whether the new law on individual labor activity can
 undo the damage caused by earlier decrees on "un-
 earned income" that have caused widespread confu-
 sion about the legalities of certain activities and have
 served to discourage individual initiative.
 ' These newly established cooperatives are to be composed primarily
 of retired people, housewives, and students. Factory and office
 Implementing the Reform
 Many of these measures have proved even more
 difficult to implement than they were to enact. Gorba-
 chev's reorganization of the economic bureaucracy,
 for example, has not gone smoothly. The dust has yet
 to settle from the agro-industrial reorganization that
 started nearly a year ago, and the foreign trade
 bureaucracy is said to be in considerable disarray.
 the Fuel and Energy
 Bureau established in March still has no clear man-
 date. And the State Planning Committee (Gosplan)
 has been slow to restructure its work.
 Gorbachev complained that Gosplan officials were
 continuing to "do what they want to do" and seemed
 to recognize "no general secretaries or central com-
 mittees."

 Conclusions: An Incremental Reform
 Despite these problems, Gorbachev seems determined
 to persevere, and a published list of future measures
 now in the pipeline-from regulations governing Gos-
 plan's operations to a revised pricing system-sug-
 gests no scaling down of long-term objectives. His
 economic advisers and other Soviet economists have
 estimated that the "first phase" of the reform will not
 be complete until 1990, and Gorbachev
 it could take "genera-
 tions" for the restructuring process to be completed.
 With that kind of timetable, he probably regards the
 measures adopted thus far as steps that lay the
 necessary groundwork for more far-reaching change.

 Secret
 Gorbachev's announced plans to expand and put more
 teeth in some of the decrees initially adopted (such as
 those on wholesale trade and agro-industrial manage-
 ment) clearly indicate that he views this reform as an
 incremental process. Whether dictated by political
 realities or his own uncertainties, such an approach
 has both benefits and drawbacks:
 ? By moving at a gradual and deliberate pace, he can
 avoid charges of recklessness and comparisons with
 Khrushchev's "harebrained" schemes.
 ? On the other hand, this incremental approach may
 cost him some of his reformist supporters and
 produce only marginal near-term results, providing
 more ammunition to the opposition.
 This incrementalism also severely limits our ability to
 predict how far Gorbachev will be willing, or able, to
 push his ideas. If pushed to their extremes, they would
 create a radically different Soviet economy. The
 evidence thus far, however, suggests that his efforts to
 improve the system will be something of a trial-and-
 error process (he has openly predicted that "mistakes
 will be made") and that the dimensions of the reform
 ultimately will be determined by a combination of the
 economic results he obtains and his own political
 abilities.

 Restructuring the Government
 Apparatus
 General Secretary Gorbachev has assigned a high
 priority to restructuring the government, a task that
 he views as essential to the success of his economic
 revitalization program. He has singled out the minis-
 terial bureaucracy-with its organization along nar-
 row departmental lines and its addiction to detailed
 management of the economy-as the main obstacle to
 his plans to stimulate the kind of initiative that he
 believes is needed to spur productivity, accelerate
 growth, and make Soviet products competitive in the
 world market.
 Gorbachev's Strategy
 Gorbachev's strategy is at once centralizing and de-
 centralizing: he wants more effective central control
 over the main directions of the economy, while leaving
 more of the day-to-day management to lower levels
 where it can be most effectively exercised. His pro-
 gram includes the creation of superagencies answer-
 ing directly to the Council of Ministers to oversee
 complexes of related ministries, a major reduction in
 the size of the ministerial apparatus, and a change in
 the ministry's role from a supervisor of enterprise
 operations to a scientific and technological center.
 The expansion of enterprise autonomy and the estab-
 lishment of new interministerial bodies are also in-
 tended to free the State Planning Committee (Gos-
 plan) from detailed planning and enable it to
 concentrate on long-term strategic issues.
 the regime intends to
 take a differentiated approach to decentralizing deci-
 sionmaking authority, with some sectors affected
 more than others:
 ? Basic industries such as energy resources and the
 extraction of raw materials will continue to be
 subject to a high degree of centralized direction and
 assigned production quotas.
 ? Enterprises of the machine-building and manufac-
 turing branches are to be allowed considerably more
 managerial and financial autonomy and assessed on
 the basis of contract fulfillment, not gross output
 indicators.
 ? Light industry, food, and other consumer-oriented
 branches would be the most decentralized. Enter-
 prises in this sector are to be allowed to shape their
 own plans in response to consumer demands, and
 some role for market forces permitted.
 Gorbachev has also pushed the restructuring of man-
 agement with an eye to political goals. It should
 provide a useful tool for rooting out personnel wedded
 to traditional ways of managing the economy and
 replacing them with officials who are more open to
 new approaches and more loyal to Gorbachev.
 Carrying Out the Plan
 As was the case with the last major effort to restruc-
 ture the bureaucracy in 1965, the centralizing aspects
 of Gorbachev's plan are being accomplished first. The
 decentralizing measures remain mostly on the books.
 Superministries headed by deputy chairmen of the
 USSR Council of Ministers have been established for
 a number of key sectors of the economy, including
 machine building, agro-industry, construction, fuel
 and energy, and foreign trade.
 ed for the foreign trade sector.
 The regime does not appear to have a standard
 organizational model in mind for these overarching
 bodies. State committees with broad planning and
 managerial authority have been created for the agro-
 industrial and construction sectors; bureaus with more
 limited authority have been established for the ma-
 chine-building and energy sectors; and a commission
 that apparently serves as a policy-coordinating body
 but has no managerial responsibilities has been creat-

 Secret
 The reorganization has been under way for more than
 a year and is far from complete. Gorbachev and his
 allies have moved cautiously in carrying it out, proba-
 bly to minimize confusion and the possibility of
 conservative backlash. Gorbachev's repeated com-
 plaints about the pace of change, and the limited
 nature of some of the measures taken, strongly sug-
 gest that bureaucratic foot-dragging has contributed
 to the evident compromise and delay.
 Agro-Industrial Sector. The agro-industrial reorgani-
 zation, one of the first undertaken, still stands as the
 most far reaching. A state agro-industrial committee,
 Gosagroprom, was set up in November 1985, merging
 five ministries, one state committee, and components
 of two other ministries. A close Gorbachev associate
 from Stavropol', Vsevolod Murakhovskiy, was ap-
 pointed head of the state committee and also named a
 first deputy premier. Within several months the ad-
 ministrative apparatus had reportedly been reduced
 by 47 percent; 250 main administrations and associa-
 tions had been consolidated into 10 departments, each
 with several scientific-production associations at-
 tached. A similar reorganization was undertaken at
 the regional levels, and greater responsibility for
 planning and managing the local food supply is
 scheduled to be transferred to local officials in 1987.
 The gross inefficiencies existing in agriculture and the
 clear advantages of decentralized management made
 this sector a prime target for reform. Moreover,
 Gorbachev's long and close identification with agri-
 culture and his strong political authority in the area
 probably made it possible for him to initiate changes
 here that would have been difficult to sell in other
 parts of the economy. Soviet spokesmen say that
 agriculture will continue to lead the way in the
 introduction of reforms.
 Machine Building. The civilian machine-building sec-
 tor-a sector critical to Gorbachev's attempt to mod-
 ernize antiquated plant and equipment-was reorga-
 nized at the same time. A new bureau overseeing the
 sector was announced in late September 1985, but, in
 contrast to the speed with which Gosagroprom was
 formed, it was more than three months before the new
 arrangement began to take shape. None of the 11
 civilian machine-building ministries was abolished as
 in the case of Gosagroprom, nor does the bureau
 appear to have comparable managerial authority. The
 bureau is empowered to distribute resources within
 the machine-building sector but reportedly will not
 have decisionmaking and planning responsibilities ex-
 cept for major projects that individual ministries have
 difficulty coordinating.
 The newly appointed head of the bureau, Ivan Si-
 layev, said in an interview last March that the bureau
 would be small and organized along functional lines to
 enable it to concentrate on ensuring a unified techno-
 logical policy industrywide. A knowledgeable Soviet
 economist, explaining why a "bureau" was chosen
 rather than the Gosagroprom-type structure, stated
 that the problem in machine building is not that there
 are 11 ministries, but that the ministries do not
 specialize. Too many are engaged in making basic
 products and the bureau's job would reportedly be to
 correct this.
 Silayev also reported that the all-union industrial
 associations-a level of management between the
 ministries and enterprises that Gorbachev claims did
 little more than generate paperwork-had been abol-
 ished and the numerical strength of the management
 apparatus reduced. Soviet economist Abel Aganbe-
 gyan-a reputed adviser to Gorbachev-told Western
 journalists in a July interview that there had been an
 18-percent reduction in the machine-building bureau-
 cracy.
 Fuel and Energy. A Bureau for the Fuel and Energy
 Complex was established in March 1986.
 lit would have a trouble-
 shooting role and that its main functions would be to
 ensure effective coordination between ministries in
 carrying out energy-sector projects. There has been
 little mention of its activities 0 since. As
 recently as last September, a Soviet economist
 claimed that the bureau was still in the initial phase of
 organization and its responsibilities had not yet been
 decided.

 Construction. A reorganization of the construction
 sector was unveiled in August, apparently after much
 debate.
 plans for reorganizing the construction
 sector were undergoing the fourth draft. Gorbachev
 later said there had been 10 different versions. The
 reorganization marks the first serious attempt in more
 than 20 years to introduce some order into the
 management structure of this much criticized and
 troubled sector. The existence of hundreds of irratio-
 nally organized construction organizations has con-
 tributed to perennial problems of duplication of effort,
 poor project selection, wasted investment, and shoddy
 quality.
 The reorganization appears aimed at strengthening
 centralized direction while allowing regional authori-
 ties more control over local projects. Three existing
 construction ministries were reorganized into region-
 ally focused ministries-one for the Urals and west-
 ern Siberia, one for the northern and western regions,
 and one for the southern regions. The Ministry for
 Construction in the Far East and Transbaikal Regions
 was renamed the Ministry of Construction in the
 Eastern Regions of the USSR. The regional ministries
 apparently were created to reduce the number of
 conflicting and overlapping agencies with which local
 officials must deal. Four specialized construction min-
 istries remained unchanged.
 The role of the State Committee for Construction
 Affairs (Gosstroy) was expanded to resemble that of
 Gosagroprom. Previously,
 JGosstroy had virtually no power and was ignored
 by the construction ministries. Clear lines of responsi-
 bilityhave been established, and now the
 ministries will be reporting to the committee. Party
 secretary Lev Zaykov emphasized the same point in a
 recent Leningrad speech. The committee's decisions,
 are "mandatory" for all participants in the
 Foreign Trade. A reorganization of this sector in
 August 1986 brought an end to the Ministry of
 Foreign Trade's (MFT) long-held monopoly over all
 foreign trade activities. The move reportedly was
 strongly opposed by the ministry and came only after
 months of heated debate. A state commission for
 foreign trade was established under the Council of
 Ministers. It is made up of the heads of the major
 ministries and departments engaged in foreign trade
 activities. The commission is to serve as a policy-
 coordinating body and is chaired by recently appoint-
 ed Deputy Premier Viktor Kamentsev.
 At the same time, more than 20 ministries and 70
 production enterprises have now been granted the
 right-although one that is fairly limited-to engage
 directly in foreign trade. To carry out this trade, they
 will have foreign trade organizations placed under
 their jurisdiction, many of which will be transferred
 from the MFT. The ministry will retain its function of
 trading in the most important raw materials and
 foodstuffs and continue to oversee much of the foreign
 trade activity.
 Breaking the MFT's monoply over foreign trade is
 tied to Soviet efforts to expand exports of manufac-
 tured goods and force Soviet producers to be competi-
 tive in the world market. In addition, it is designed to
 improve the efficiency of importing Western technol-
 ogy by giving end users more say in contract negotia-
 tions. Under the current system, negotations are
 drawn out and purchases often do not meet the
 requirements of end users.
 Social Development. In the most recent development,
 the Council of Ministers established a Bureau for
 Social Development in November 1986, headed by
 First Deputy Premier and Politburo member Geydar
 Aliyev. While there has been no formal announce-
 ment of its responsibilites, Gosplan chief Nikolay
 Talyzin implied in his November Supreme Soviet
 speech that the bureau would have broad oversight
 over the various ministries and institutes concerned
 with consumer goods and services, health, education,
 and social policy.
 Only the Beginning

 the beginning of a more protracted and extensive

 need for deep cuts. Some of Gorbachev's colleagues
 may in fact be more zealous in wielding the ax than
 he is-or at least that is the impression that he may
 be trying to leave, perhaps because there has been a
 storm of complaints from bureaucrats whose jobs are
 individual ministries.
 Gosplan overcome its "narrowly sectorial and depart-
 mental approach" and allow it to concentrate on long-
 term strategic planning. In the future, he said, Gos-

 each complex as a whole, while the responsibility for
 detailed branch plans would be shifted to the leader-
 ship of the complexes to be worked out with the

 Superagencies overseeing other major sectors of the
 economy are evidently planned. Party secretary and
 Politburo member Lev Zaykov, in a recent speech in
 Leningrad, strongly implied that the regime was
 considering extending the superministry structure
 throughout the government. He mentioned four other
 complexes in addition to the ones that already have
 oversight bodies: metallurgy, chemical industry,
 transportation, and communications.
 Transportation. The transportation sector is a prime
 target. It has frequently been mentioned by Soviet
 officials as one of the sectors needing better coordina-

 been a hitch.                       there is strong

 vided some information on plans for the reorganiza-

 Gorbachev's overall strategy for restructuring the
 management of the economy but which has been slow
 in getting under way. Zaykov indicated that subdivi-

 Assessing the Results
 It is too soon to judge with any certainty how well the
 organizational restructuring will ultimately measure
 up to the goals Gorbachev has set for it. Much still
 remains to be put in place, and important decisions on
 the functions and structure of some of the new
 agencies are still to be made. Past efforts to curb the
 power of the central bureaucracy have been short
 lived. The ministries and other defenders of central-
 ization demonstrated great tenacity in rebounding
 from Nikita Khrushchev's 1957 attempt to replace
 the central economic ministries with regional planning
 and management councils and in frustrating Aleksey
 Kosygin's 1965 effort to increase the autonomy of

 surprisingly, has produced reports of considerable

 Some streamlining of the bureaucratic structure has
 also been achieved. One layer of management-the
 all-union industrial associations-is being eliminated,
 not just in machine-building ministries but through-
 out the industrial ministries. The net gain achieved by
 the elimination of this layer may be debatable, given
 the simultaneous creation of a layer of oversight
 bodies above the ministries. In addition, the functions
 of the all-union industrial associations and many of its
 personnel have in some cases simply been shifted to
 the ministries. Only the Gosagroprom reorganization
 appears to fully qualify as the kind of "radical"
 restructuring that Gorbachev has called for.
 As the new superministries begin to function more
 smoothly and the reorganization takes shape, it could
 well produce some of the hoped-for improvement in
 interbranch coordination and assist central authorities
 in getting a grip on broad economic tasks. Whether it
 will ever produce the larger and more elusive goal-
 redirecting the center away from detailed involvement
 in day-to-day management and significantly expand-
 ing enterprise authority-is another matter. Soviet
 spokesmen contend that with fewer bureaucrats at the
 center they will no longer be able to interfere in the
 day-to-day running of the enterprises. The experience
 of Gosagroprom, however, offers little encouragement
 that the reorganization is producing such an effect in
 the near term. Party secretary Nikonov, in his journal
 article last summer, charged that the new committee
 was continuing to decide questions that should be
 resolved at the local level, just as the former ministries
 had. Some economists are arguing that the only way
 to prevent the branch ministries from doing this is to
 abolish them, leaving only functional ministries and a
 few broad intersectoral bodies.
 Expanding the rights and responsibilities of enter-
 prises, moreover, will require progress on other ele-
 ments of Gorbachev's program that are likely to prove
 just as controversial and disruptive as the bureaucrat-
 ic restructuring:
 ? New legislation to strengthen enterprise legal rights,
 due to be published for nationwide discussion soon,
 will have to give enterprises an effective mechanism
 for the redress of grievances against the ministries.
 ? The regime will have to make more use of economic
 levers such as finance and credit, establish a flexible
 price mechanism, and solve the problem of chronic
 supply shortages if enterprises are to function effec-
 tively in a less centrally structured environment.
 Ultimately none of these measures may be sufficient
 if the leadership continues to make contradictory
 demands on the ministries, directing that they refrain
 from micromanagement of enterprises while still hold-
 ing them responsible for enterprise performance. Gor-
 bachev himself will probably have to stake out a more
 unambiguous position on ministerial responsibilities
 than he has so far in order to save his reform program

 Gorbachev's New Directions in
 Propaganda and Culture
 Top Kremlin leaders have recognized for some time
 that greater candor in the media and increased cultur-
 al excellence are needed to make regime indoctrina-
 tion more effective. Andropov initiated publication of
 reports on Politburo meetings during his brief tenure,
 and Chernenko talked about the need to discuss
 regime shortcomings more frankly. Gorbachev, how-
 ever, has promoted a much more systematic and far-
 reaching implementation of a policy of glasnost (open-
 ness) and cultural revitalization to counter the
 attraction of "bourgeois" culture and Western propa-
 ganda and to increase his own freedom for maneuver
 in addressing the nation's problems. Publicly castigat-
 ing Soviet propaganda as "stagnant" and much of the
 culture as "dull," he has taken steps in less than two
 years as General Secretary to loosen ideological con-
 straints on cultural life, to replace most of the key
 personnel in the bureaucracies controlling propaganda
 and the arts, and to open up a limited discussion of
 domestic problems in Soviet media.
 Glasnost in the Media
 Gorbachev has encouraged the media to engage in
 investigative reporting and to solicit criticisms from
 concerned citizens in order to provide more factual
 accounts of "negative" domestic events and to pro-
 mote more responsible discussion of social problems.
 As a result, the Soviet public now receives much more
 information than was previously provided by official
 sources on such sensitive topics as crime, the black
 market, and alcohol abuse. Official statistics for 1985
 recently released by the Central Statistical Adminis-
 tration included figures on the grain harvest for the
 first time in five years and on infant mortality for the
 first time in 12 years. Officials told US Embassy
 officers that Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and
 accelerating economic growth require the publication
 of more data.                          censor-
 ship practices have been changed: journalists can now
 express opinions that do not reflect official views, and
 editors are themselves completely responsible for what
 they print without approval from external censoring
 organizations.
 Gorbachev's widely publicized informal conversations
 with citizens in streets and workplaces during his
 visits to various areas of the USSR have given the
 public a graphic impression of glasnost in action as he
 calls local officials on the mat and hears the com-
 plaints of the man in the street. There are many news
 stories about incompetent and corrupt officials and
 more extensive explanations of their malfeasance and
 punishments. The media also are providing more
 discussion of Soviet troop activity in Afghanistan and
 live coverage of such events as a space launch. In
 recent months Soviet television has carried several
 programs that offered Western spokesmen the rare
 opportunity to advance their viewpoints on interna-
 tional affairs in some detail. The television program
 International Panorama on 19 October-devoted to a
 Soviet-West German roundtable on arms control-
 featured substantial statements by editors and govern-
 ment figures from both countries.
 The Soviet media have become more informative with
 respect to internal natural disasters and catastrophic
 accidents since the Chernobyl' events. The regime's
 inability to control information about the accident
 may have heightened debate within the Politburo and
 ultimately led the leadership to conclude that suppres-
 sion of negative information is counterproductive. In
 ensuing months the Soviet media have reported
 promptly not only such incidents as the sinking of a
 Soviet submarine in the Atlantic-an event indepen-
 dently publicized in the West-but also a fatal bridge
 collapse in Latvia, a serious fire with casualties at the
 Russian Orthodox seminary at Zagorsk, and the
 attempted hijacking of an Aeroflot plane near a
 remote city in the Urals. None of the latter events
 involved foreigners, nor was it likely that they would
 become known in the West.
 Certain themes that have for many years been taboo
 in the Soviet media and never mentioned in public by
 officials have quite suddenly become subjects of open

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/14: CIA-RDP88T00799R000200130003-4
 discussion and intense public concern. After years of
 denying that a drug problem exists in the Soviet
 Union, the regime has in recent months promoted a
 press and television blitz on the horrors of drug abuse,
 particularly as it affects Soviet youth. For example,
 Moscow Komsomol in mid-April presented harrowing
 portraits of young addicts, and Moscow television
 aired a scheduled 90-minute live phone-in program on
 25 October, concerning drug addiction in schools, that
 featured questions from troubled parents and frank
 answers from experts in medicine, psychology, and
 law. At the end of the program, the moderator
 commented that during the hour and a half, calls had
 been received from 536 people from 39 cities and
 towns.
 The role of religion in Russian history and culture,
 and its place in modern Soviet society, are now being
 more openly-and sometimes positively-examined,
 particularly in the arts. A number of recently released
 books and films use religious symbolism quite openly
 to depict a moral rectitude that is badly needed in a
 corrupt and spiritually empty society. Several promi-
 nent writers have been accused of "flirting with
 religion" because their work contains a positive treat-
 ment of religion and believers.
 support is growing among artists and
 intellectuals and in the bureaucracy for the ideas of
 Russian nationalist writers who glorify traditional
 institutions, including the Orthodox Church.
 In a closely related development, there have been a
 number of signs that the writing of the history of the
 USSR is also under review: favorable references to
 Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP)-as a positive
 move rather than a maligned necessary evil-have
 appeared prominently in the press, and Gorbachev
 himself mentioned Lenin's determination to push
 NEP in a 31 July speech. A recent letter to Sovetska-
 ya Rossiya from a historian and party member
 demanded that Soviet historians of the October Revo-
 lution stop writing "threadbare and inexpressive"
 works that hedge sensitive questions and aid the
 USSR's "ideological enemies."
 The treatment of the emigration question has also
 become more open and sophisticated. This fall the
 play 40, Shalom Aleichem Street-revolving around
 the split of a Jewish family of the 1970s over the
 issue-began its second successful year on the Mos-
 cow stage. Although the play clearly presents emigra-
 tion as wrong and foolish, the choice is shown to be a
 difficult and complex one, and Jewish characters are
 portrayed in a positive manner. Even more striking
 was the uncut and uncensored airing by Moscow
 television on two occasions in September of a 1983
 American documentary film concerning Jewish immi-
 grants from the USSR in Brooklyn. The emigres'
 confusing and often negative experiences have been
 portrayed in Soviet media on a number of occasions,
 but The Russians Are Here broke new ground by
 showing many positive features of the United States.
 Gorbachev's argument that problems, if denied, only
 become worse was spelled out in a 24 September
 Literaturnaya Gazeta article stating that "until re-
 cently" the "lack of frankness" was one reason that
 "Western propaganda" had been able to lure many
 Soviets to emigrate.
 A Cultural Renaissance
 The cultural scene in the Soviet Union is now more
 lively than at any time since Khrushchev's cultural
 "thaw" during the height of de-Stalinization in the
 1950s. The sense of deja vu is heightened by reis-
 suance of works by leading liberal authors of that
 period and the renewed public prominence of several
 literary figures from those years-Yevgeniy Yevtu-
 shenko, Andrey Voznesensky, and Bulat Okudz-
 hava-who were long in political disfavor. A number
 of Soviet journals are publishing excerpts from the
 novel White Clothes written in the mid-1960s by
 Vladimir Dudintsev, which exposes the charlatan
 biologist Trofim Lysenko, a favorite of Stalin. Dudint-
 sev's reemergence into the limelight is an important
 signal because he played a major role in the 1950s
 thaw. He has been linked with the new head of the
 Central Committee's Culture Department, Yuriy
 Voronov. Persistent campaigns by the liberal cultural
 and intellectual communities have led to the rehabili-
 tation of a number of controversial artists suppressed
 by Stalin-notably the poets Anna Akhmatova and
 Nikolay Gumilev-as well as publication of works by
 more recent giants Boris Pasternak and Vladimir
 Nabokov, whose writings have until now been avail-
 able to Soviet readers only in samizdat.

 Controversial Films, Books, and Plays
 Released Under Gorbachev
 Films
 ? Agonia-released after many years on the shelf.
 Portrays the 1917 Revolution as a spontaneous
 popular rebellion rather than a triumph of Bolshe-
 vik organization. Striking for its tones of Russian
 nationalism and even monarchism.
 ? Roadblock-made in 1971 but never before re-
 leased. Depicts the persecution of a returning Soviet
 partisan who had been forced to join the Nazis.
 ? Double Trap-a realistic crime drama that shows
 the corruption of a group of Latvian youths and
 includes pornography.
 ? Fouette-a complex psychological study of the
 world of ballet that portrays a choreographer's
 struggle against official censors and recalls Mik-
 hail Bulgakov's controversial novel Master and
 Margarita.
 ? Repentance-a stunning Georgian film, replete with
 religious motifs, made in 1984 and recently pre-
 miered for select audiences. The first Soviet film to
 portray Stalin and Beria as responsible for the
 purges of the 1930s. Production of the film was
 reportedly supported by Shevardnadze, then party
 chief in Georgia, and-according to film sources-
 its  lease was personally authorized by Ligachev.
 ? The New Appointment-a novel by Aleksandr Bek
 (deceased) originally scheduled for publication in
 1966. A thinly disguised portrayal of Stalin's lieu-
 tenants that unmistakably asserts Stalin's primary
 responsibility for the terror.
 ? The Children of the Arbat-Anatoly Rybakov's
 novel about the year 1934 and the onset of the
 purges. Written 20 years ago and scheduled for
 publication next spring, it features Stalin as a
 major character.
 Theatre
 ? Silver Anniversary-a morality play that depicts a
 corrupt party official, a muckraking journalist who
 is fired for exposing a scandal, and other unsavory
 functionaries. Attended by Gorbachev, Yel'tsin, Li-
 gachev, and reportedly made mandatory viewing for
 party congress delegates.
 ? Dictatorship of Conscience-a mock trial of Lenin
 that exposes various tyrannical figures, drawn from
 fiction and history, as having distorted socialist
 principles by their brutality.
 ? Speak Out!-based on the 1950s writings of Valen-
 tin Ovechkin (a popular writer on the rural scene
 and a Khrushchev favorite). Calls for open discus-
 sion of past party wrongdoings. The action takes
 place in front of a gigantic statue of Stalin.
 Literature
 ? Two-volume collected works of Boris Pasternak,
 whose controversial novel, Doctor Zhivago, will
 also be published in the "next couple of years,"
 according to a Soviet writer.
 ? A collection of stories by the Village Writers, a
 group of authors popular in the 1950s and 1960s
 because of the forthright treatment of rural prob-
 lems and overtones of traditional Russian national-
 ism in their writings.
 ? Works of several important writers of the early
 20th century who have been rehabilitated, including
 Marina Tsvetaeva, Velimir Khlebnikov, and Mik-
 hail Bulgakov.
 ? Brothers and Sisters-raises the specter of Stalin's
 repressions against the backdrop of popular war-
 time heroism and suffering.
 ? Sarcophogus-title alludes to the entombment of
 the Chernobyl' reactor. A searing indictment of
 incompetence and cowardice of some plant officials
 and local authorities. Its appearance so soon after
 the plant disaster suggests high-level support.

 Gorbachev's Goals ...
 Gorbachev's reasons for moving toward glasnost in
 propaganda and culture are pragmatic. He is using
 frankness to marshal public opinion in support of
 policy initiatives, combat widespread popular cyni-
 cism and alienation from the system, raise citizens'
 awareness, open up debate on economic reform, and
 promote the "radical change" in attitudes essential to
 economic progress. Gorbachev apparently also recog-
 nizes that Soviet society is vulnerable to outside
 influences, that Soviet artistic offerings must be inter-
 esting if they are to compete with Western culture for
 the Soviet audience, and that necessary technological
 advances now make it impossible for central authori-
 ties to control information flow within the country.
 There are also political motivations in Gorbachev's
 espousal of glasnost. Media exposes of corrupt and
 incompetent officials and Gorbachev's well-publicized
 personal jibes during walkabouts serve to pressure
 foot-dragging midlevel officials to support his policy
 initiatives. He may also expect that loosening controls
 on artists and the media may favorably impress
 foreign opinion.
 ... And Methods
 Gorbachev appears to be relying on interrelated
 changes in policy and personnel to achieve his goals
 for franker discussion of tough issues and higher
 quality cultural offerings. In addition to relaxing
 ideological strictures and initiating measures to
 increase media and artistic outspokenness, he pushed
 forward an experimental reorganization of Soviet
 theatres that moves control over repertoire and
 finances from the center to individual theatre man-
 agement. He has created new societies for music and
 theatre, evidently to circumvent a reluctant bureau-
 cracy. The regime has also established a new
 "self-governed" Cultural Foundation, run on public
 donations, to promote amateur, youth, and rural
 institutions of the arts and preserve cultural and
 historical monuments.
 Gorbachev has replaced most key Brezhnev holdovers
 in media, propaganda, and cultural bureaucracies.
 New heads of the Central Committee Cultural and
 Propaganda Departments and a new Minister of
 Culture have been named. More liberal and outspo-
 ken editors have been appointed to head 13 important
 central newspapers and journals-including Kom-
 munist, the party's major ideological journal, and
 Novyy Mir, the country's most prestigious literary
 journal. Since Gorbachev's accession to power, the
 news agency Novosti, the Soviet Copyright Agency,
 the State Committee for Television and Radio, and
 the government publishing agency have all been given
 new chiefs. And-in the first open debates since the
 1930s at congresses of writers' and filmmakers'
 unions-liberals took control of the union leaderships
 and set up commissions to review all productions
 bottled up by the censors. These shifts at the center of
 the system have been reflected in a number of similar
 personnel changes at republic and regional levels.
 Resistance and Risks
 There is ample evidence-in the Soviet press=
 and in statements by Gorbachev
 and his supporters-that glasnost is neither universal-
 ly acclaimed nor practiced. At the highest level,
 Gorbachev's principal supporters and spokesmen for
 this policy are "second secretary" Yegor Ligachev,
 Moscow party boss Boris Yel'tsin, and propaganda
 secretary Aleksandr Yakovlev. Yel'tsin and Yakovlev
 were promoted into the top leadership by Gorbachev,
 and Ligachev was brought to Moscow, where he
 worked under Gorbachev's supervision, by Andropov.
 Yakovlev reportedly is a close Gorbachev adviser and
 has played a key role in the large number of personnel
 changes in the media. He recently told a conference of
 cultural officials at the Central Committee that the
 best weapon against the inroads of "mass culture"
 from the West is better Soviet art. Yel'tsin acted as
 Gorbachev's point man on the arts at the 27th CPSU
 Congress in February 1986 and has continued in
 Moscow a pattern of frank discussion that he set
 earlier in his career.
 Ligachev's position appears to be more complex. He
 has forcefully articulated Gorbachev's cultural and
 information policy at a series of conferences with
 propaganda and media functionaries; reportedly has

 vetted and approved many controversial plays and
 films for public showing, including the stunning "Re-
 pentance," a staged critique of Stalinism; and over-
 seen the purge of propaganda personnel. On the other
 hand, he has tempered his calls for glasnost with stiff
 warnings to theatrical figures and media officials that
 "criticism of negative phenomena" must be only of a
 "creative, constructive nature," that radio and televi-
 sion broadcasting must be "wholly political," and that
 artistic works must feature the active Soviet hero, the
 "real fighter" for the Soviet lifestyle. Soviet cultural
 figures, he warns, must display "incomparably greater
 and questioning of the system. Foot-dragging, muz-
 zling of whistle-blowers, and various forms of sabo-
 aggressiveness" in fighting "bourgeois ideology."
 Although we have not seen signs of serious disagree-
 ment about glasnost at the top level, the continued
 presence of Andrey Gromyko and Vladimir Shcher-
 bitsky, who are less than enthusiastic on the issue,
 could in the future provide a focus for disaffected
 informational and cultural elites and officials who
 fear that Gorbachev's policies threaten their privi-
 leged positions. KGB Chairman Viktor Chebrikov
 may also have mixed feelings about this approach.
 While he is probably allied with Gorbachev on most
 political and economic questions, and was reportedly
 one of only two Politburo members to support the
 General Secretary's relatively frank information poli-
 cy on Chernobyl', his functional responsibilities as
 head of the secret police may make him wary of any
 loosening of controls over the spread of unorthodox
 ideas. In an article published in Kommunist (No. 9,
 1985), Chebrikov came down hard on domestic critics
 of the Soviet system as tools of foreign intelligence
 services and failed even to mention Gorbachev's call
 for constructive criticism.
 Ideological and stylistic conservatives among media
 officials, cultural figures, and midlevel bureaucrats
 have recently become more devious in their resistance,
 and their arguments are more muted. They insist that
 more open discussion of social problems and official
 shortcomings weakens popular confidence in the par-
 ty, provides ammunition to foreign enemies, and
 encourages deviant behavior among impressionable
 youth-in short, it opens a Pandora's box of anarchy
 tage evidently continue to plague Gorbachev.
 The central media and regime spokesmen increasingly
 are hitting out directly at local press and party
 officials who flout the policy. A 12 November Pravda
 editorial attacked "some leaders" who are "frightened
 of the glare of publicity" and "some people" who
 "still believe that criticism from below is incompatible
 with strict order." It ridiculed "would-be criticism
 from people who are only playing up to the restructur-
 ing." The editorial also revealed the regime's concern
 about the number of anonymous letters to higher     25X1
 authorities smearing whistle-blowers and "strong lea-
 ders" who have "introduced stricter responsibility."
 There are complaints in the literary press that some
 editors-and not just those in the provinces-are
 overcautious in exercising their new authority and
 continue to suppress anything that appears unortho-
 dox. A Soviet poet recently wrote sardonically that all
 references to "beer" and "wine" had been deleted
 from his verses by an overzealous editor.
 Expanding the limits of the permissible in culture and 25X1
 propaganda harbors major risks for the regime and
 for Gorbachev personally. Public airing of social
 problems could stimulate a process of ferment within
 the intelligentsia and criticism from below that could
 get out of hand-as happened during Khrushchev's
 "thaw" in the late 1950s. The breaching, in recent
 weeks, of two extremely sensitive taboos-concerning
 Stalin and religion-could, for example, lead to sym-
 bolic questioning of the legitimacy of the Soviet
 system. If the campaign goes too far, it could
 strengthen the hand of Politburo hardliners and pro-
 duce a swing back to more repressive policies. On the  25X1
 other hand, a crackdown would risk killing the esprit
 Gorbachev wants to foster and might lead to greater
 popular cynicism than existed before.
 Prospects
 Gorbachev evidently believes that the policy of a
 franker confrontation with "past mistakes" and con-
 temporary social and economic problems is needed to
 address and solve those shortcomings and to overcome

 widespread apathy and alienation, particularly among
 the intelligentsia. He seems confident that he can
 control the scope and process of glasnost and avoid
 either a runaway intellectual ferment or a backlash by
 rightwing officials that would cripple the momentum
 and esprit he is trying to build.
 Regime spokesmen have begun an attempt to articu-
 late a balanced formula as guidance, but it is impre-
 cise and ambiguous. For example, the new head of the
 USSR Writers Union, Vladimir Karpov, told a TASS
 correspondent that writers are no longer bound by
 rules forbidding "certain themes" and that "we must
 tell the truth" even if it is sad. "But," he added, "to
 write only of shortcomings is incomplete truth." And
 the handling of the highly controversial film Repen-
 tance, about Stalin's terror, provides a graphic exam-
 ple of Gorbachev's dilemma in trying to predict and

 contain the impact of newly released works. Limited
 screenings in Georgia and Moscow have sparked
 highly emotional reactions, and since the film's direc-
 tor distributed leaflets to cultural organizations an-
 nouncing further showings, there have been rumors
 that the Central Committee had decided to postpone
 or perhaps to cancel the public opening and the
 planned nationwide television showing. A showing in
 Leningrad was canceled, reportedly at the direction of
 the local KGB.
 Gorbachev's dual goals of artistic creativity and polit-
 ical reliability are irreconcilable, and managing the
 process of glasnost will increasingly tax his political
 skill. If, in the short run, he continues to resist
 defining more precise limits as a way of giving himself
 more room to maneuver, the demands and hopes of
 liberal intellectuals will continue to escalate. In the
 long run, he will ultimately have to set firm bounds to
 prevent a conservative reaction within the leadership.

 Gorbachev's Economic Program:
 Monitoring Progress
 General Secretary Gorbachev has made economic
 revitalization the central focus of his regime. His
 obvious dissatisfaction with existing economic condi-
 tions and performance has led him to take a number
 of initiatives to turn the situation around. The credi-
 bility of Gorbachev and his regime will depend, in no
 small measure, on the degree of success he and his
 colleagues achieve in the economic arena. The regime
 has focused its efforts on improvements within the
 existing system while fostering a wider debate about
 economic problems that could lead to more risky and
 destabilizing systemic change should current initia-
 tives fail. Monitoring economic performance and
 leadership perceptions of and reactions to "progress"
 is therefore central to our understanding of Soviet
 political and economic dynamics.
 Given the long leadtimes and, in some cases, short-
 term disruptions associated with many of Gorbachev's
 initiatives, the full effect of regime policies on eco-
 nomic performance will not be manifest for several
 years. The leadership, however, probably has neither
 the time nor the patience to let the dynamics of
 current initiatives play out fully before deciding on
 their efficacy and sufficiency. More likely, its progno-
 sis for effective modernization will be based over the
 next two years on demonstrated progress in those
 areas-such as machine building-viewed as critical
 prerequisites to overall economic improvement. Re-
 cent events make it clear that Gorbachev and his
 lieutenants are closely watching-and taking action
 on the basis of-even more preliminary returns.
 Performance against major macroeconomic mea-
 sures-national income, industrial production, labor
 productivity-will be monitored closely by Soviet
 leaders and planners, who will be quick to point to
 increases in the growth rates of these variables as
 indicators of success. But, because of their highly
 aggregated nature, such measures are of limited
 utility in short-run assessments of progress or prob-
 lems in Gorbachev's economic programs. For exam-
 ple, the upturn in many of these indicators this year is
 due more to a surge in the quantity of goods and
 services produced than to any increase in quality or
 variety of production-the base on which successful
 modernization will ultimately depend. Because
 changes in quality and product variety are inherently
 difficult to identify through shifts in aggregate eco-
 nomic variables, it is necessary to look for additional
 indicators that will give a clearer sense of how
 enthusiastically Gorbachev's program is being re-
 ceived, how well it is being implemented, and how it is
 being modified. We have identified a number of
 surrogate "progress indicators" with respect to the
 following four major themes of Gorbachev's economic
 strategy: industrial modernization, economic efficien-
 cy, economic discipline, and consumer welfare. Al-
 though performance in some of these indicators will
 be known only after annual data are published, others
 can be tracked more or less continuously.
 Industrial Modernization
 Gorbachev has made modernizing the economy one of
 his top priorities with good reason. Unless substantial
 quantities of high-quality, modern-technology equip-
 ment are produced and assimilated, the gap between
 Western and Soviet technology is likely to widen.
 Equally important, the foundation for meaningful
 improvements in the quality and efficiency of Soviet
 industrial production will not materialize. The regime
 appears well aware of this imperative and intends to
 pursue modernization through actions to accelerate
 the development and assimilation of new technology,
 (that is, S&T progress) and through shifts in invest-
 ment allocations.
 Accelerating S& T Progress. The Soviets publish a
 variety of information that will help us track progress
 against specific modernization goals (see inset). Much
 of this information is available only on an annual
 basis, and then with roughly a six-month to one-year
 lag. Moscow has begun to publish some new data
 series on efficiency of metals and energy use, and on

 use of modern production technologies, that appear to
 stem directly from efforts to monitor progress in
 modernization. Both Soviet and partner country trade
 data will be useful in tracking the competitiveness of
 Soviet manufactured goods exports in the world mar-
 ket. Increased competitiveness of Soviet manufactures
 would be a sure indicator of gains from moderniza-
 tion. Measures of political pressure to speed up S&T
 progress, such as turnover of key ministers and party
 criticisms, are available on a more or less continuous
 basis from the Soviet press. These latter indicators
 will be particularly useful in suggesting the level of
 tensions Gorbachev's policies and exhortations are
 creating and regime "commitment" to keeping the
 pressure on
 Shifting Investment Allocations. Premier Ryzhkov, in
 his speech to the party congress, stated that the new
 element of investment policy in the 1986-90 Five-
 Year Plan is its focus on promoting S&T progress.
 The most evident indication of this is the 80-percent
 increase in investment slated for the civilian machine-
 building sector-"the complex where the achieve-
 ments of scientific and technical progress material-
 ize." This priority, however, implies greatly increased
 tension among competing claimants for investment
 resources, particularly given the rising needs of ener-
 gy, transportation, the consumer sector, and the tradi-
 tional heavy demands of defense.
 Over the short term, we will be especially interested in
 evidence of tensions and imbalances in the investment
 plan that could lead to a reordering of priorities-
 perhaps threatening the implementation of Gorba-

 Economic Efficiency
 The increasing scarcity of many of the basic resources
 needed to support economic revitalization has led
 Gorbachev to make improved economic efficiency one
 of his major objectives. Publication of new Soviet data
 on efficiency of energy and metals use suggests
 increasing interest by Moscow in tracking efficiency
 gains for these critical resources. For the most part,
 data on the indicators listed in the inset on page 34
 will appear only with a considerable lag.
 A shift to a market-based system for rationing goods
 and services might be the most effective step Moscow
 could take to increase economic efficiency. As yet,
 there is no indication the regime is even considering
 such a radical move. The most important indicators
 that such a step could be in the offing would be
 references to markets, supply and demand, prices, and
 the need for slack plans in the leadership's speeches.
 References that appear in the party journals and
 newspapers also would be indicative but would carry
 less weight. Finally, references appearing in academic
 journals would at a minimum indicate an expanded
 arena for debate and perhaps represent the first
 indications of increasing interest in considering a role
 for markets.' References to raising prices of key
 consumer goods subject to large excess demand, such
 as bread, housing, and medical services, would also be
 relevant although not necessarily a step toward mar-
 kets.
 Economic Discipline
 Eliciting greater and more effective work effort from
 the labor force is one of Gorbachev's key goals. He
 already has taken major steps in this direction: the
 antialcohol campaign, a number of major reorganiza-
 tions, and numerous replacements of ministers and
 other high-level economic managers. It is inherently
 difficult to measure changes in the degree of labor
 ' Soviet officials have suggested that "more flexible" price-setting
 mechanisms could be instituted or that enterprises could be given
 greater freedom to negotiate with each other directly, especially in
 the area of above-plan output. Such discussions also may indicate
 an expanded arena for economic debate, but by stepping around the
 notion of moving toward markets per se they probably carry little

 discipline. The best indication would be changes in
 labor productivity that cannot be attributed to other
 factors, such as better equipment. However, because
 such changes are very difficult to isolate, most of the
 evidence indicating increased discipline must reflect
 the input side of the equation-that is, the number
 and range of policies taken to improve discipline and
 the extent to which they are implemented (see inset,
 page 35). For example, the intensity of the antialcohol
 campaign can be measured by the trend in availability
 of state-produced alcoholic beverages, and changes in
 store hours for selling them. While the effect of this
 campaign on labor productivity would be difficult to
 quantify, we can monitor official statements and press
 reports that comment on reduced drinking on the job,
 the incidence of alcohol-related accidents, and worker
 attitudes toward the campaign.
 Consumer Welfare
 Gorbachev's "wager on the strong" will unravel if he
 fails to make demonstrable progress in improving the
 quality, quantity, and variety of consumer goods and
 services, especially for some key product groups. He
 has called for a sharp increase in per capita consump-
 tion, but this is only a summary indicator of consumer
 welfare.' Measures that gauge improvements in the
 supply of subcategories of consumption and their
 distribution among socioeconomic groups are more
 relevant, particularly in assessing the possible impact
 of a given change in consumption on worker produc-
 tivity. For example, food-especially meat-and
 housing weigh most heavily in the Soviet consumer's
 perception of his standard of living. Gains concentrat-
 ed in these sectors might earn the regime more points
 with the consumer than increases in other goods and
 services.
 Similarly, the distribution of scarce goods and services
 to favor certain interest groups is in the regime's
 interest. For example, consumer rationing schemes
 that give priority to the most productive workers in
 ' Per capita consumption, as we define it, encompasses all household
 expenditures on goods and services and government expenditures on

 the sectors crucial to modernization could raise mo-
 rale and possibly productivity for key groups of
 workers.
 The usual Soviet rationing system of queues and
 bribes to distribute valued consumer goods and ser-
 vices is a source of frustration to much of the work
 force. Although the political costs could be substan-
 tial, increasing prices of selected consumer goods and
 services, if accompanied by a greater role for private
 producers, would relieve some of this frustration.

 Impact on the Leadership
 Gorbachev and his colleagues will also be closely
 scrutinizing the data described above. Politically, it is
 important that his strategy begin to show some posi-
 tive early returns in order to sustain momentum in
 implementing them. Economically, some gains are
 needed to ease the resource tension created by the
 industrial modernization program. The military, for
 example, may grow increasingly restive if Gorba-
 chev's program for modernization squeezes their
 share of the resource pie without showing demonstra-
 ble progress. The populace, whose expectations have
 been raised by Gorbachev's rhetoric, may also become
 restive and uncooperative if some tangible results are
 not forthcoming.
 Moscow realizes that the most salient indicators are
 the macromeasures, but that even good performance
 in these measures only implies partial success. For
 example, while the nine-month plan fulfillment report
 highlights the faster growth in a number of macroeco-
 nomic variables in 1986, it also emphasizes that
 targets for quality, product mix, and resource saving
 were not met. The direction and magnitude of
 changes in these latter indicators and others will play
 a large role in shaping the perceptions of individual
 interest groups (for example, consumers, economic
 managers, and military leaders) and their support for
 Gorbachev's economic program.
 Poor performance in indicators of economic perfor-
 mance could be risky, both for Gorbachev's own
 power and his economic program. This is not the only
 possible outcome, however. Gorbachev could use lag-
 ging performance as proof that more basic and perva-
 sive changes are needed to make his program fully
 effective. So far the changes he has called for in the
 area of reorganization and management are meant to
 improve the existing economic system. Even these
 changes have been slowed by resistance from the

 The Dilemma of Moscow's
 Policy To Curtail Illegal
 Private Activity
 Gorbachev's campaign against "unearned incomes"
 initiated this past summer-in part to curtail activity
 in the second economy-is creating confusion among
 officials and the populace and is increasing consumer
 frustration.' The campaign calls for stricter enforce-
 ment of state restrictions and regulations on the
 private sector.
 the campaign has driven some private-
 sector activit further underground, raised prices of
 some consumer goods and services, and reduced their
 availability. The leadership-reluctant to allow a
 decline in consumption levels-is concerned about
 these results and is taking steps to resolve the dilem-
 ma but so far has not come up with a solution.
 New legislation on individual labor activity attempts
 to clarify the situation by specifying what types of
 activities may legally be pursued and under what
 conditions. Moscow hopes the law will capture some
 of the private activity heretofore undertaken illegally
 as well as increase the supply of consumer goods and
 ' We define the second economy as all production and exchange
 that meets both the following conditions: (a) being directly for
 private gain; and (b) being knowingly in contravention of existing
 law. Although a wide range of private activity is considered legal,
 much of this activity actually takes place under illegal conditions
 because participants fail to register or pay taxes or use materials
 stolen from the state. This article argues that regime determination
 to reduce such activity, the target of the "unearned incomes"
 campaign, will place limits on legal private activity, despite state-
 ments by Soviet officials that the campaign is not intended to curb
 services that are legally available.' At the same time,
 the law calls for strict state regulation of individual
 labor activity through restrictions on participation,
 taxes, licensing, and probably price controls, all of
 which tend to constrain personal initiative. The essen-
 tial dilemma that Moscow faces has not been re-
 solved: the leadership wishes to rein in the second
 economy but without reducing its contribution to the
 supply of goods and services, goals that are to a large
 extent mutually exclusive within the Soviet system.
 The "Unearned Incomes" Campaign
 The Council of Ministers and the Central Committee
 issued resolutions and the Supreme Soviet approved
 legislation on "unearned incomes" in late May. New
 legislation that took effect on 1 July takes aim at
 corruption such as bribery, embezzlement, and theft
 and/or misuse of state property. It condemns activity
 conducted for the purpose of obtaining "unearned
 income," vaguely defined as income incommensurate
 with the individual's labor contribution. The cam-
 paign also targets "speculation"-the charging of
 ] While the new law makes clear that its major purposes are to
 increase labor activity and encourage greater production of goods
 and services, it also is meant to bring the second economy above
 ground by encouraging participants to register with the state and
 come under state regulation.

 "unfair" prices that results in "unearned incomes."
 Specific measures in the resolutions and the law that
 affect private activity include:
 ? Closer monitoring of individual income by the state
 in order to identify persons engaged in illegal activi-
 ty. For example, citizens conducting transactions
 worth more than 10,000 rubles must now submit to
 state authorities declarations indicating their source
 of income.
 ? Increased financial penalties for violation of laws on
 taxation and licensing of private artisans and
 craftsmen.
 ? More detailed accounting by state enterprises of
 supplies used by them. This is to curtail theft of
 state property by state personnel.
 Soviet press reports suggest that the campaign has
 made it harder for individuals operating in the private
 sector-usually illegally-to conduct business. The
 clampdown has reduced access to inputs that are often
 stolen from the state-such as use of state vehicles-
 and has in many localities created a climate in which
 all economic activity outside the state sector is viewed
 with suspicion. Press reports also indicate that the
 crackdown has led, at least in some areas, to higher
 prices and reduced supplies of foods in collective farm
 markets (CFMs). For example:
 ? A July Pravda article noted that spot checks by
 local militia at a CFM in Perm' frightened off a
 number of vendors and that the few intrepid sales-
 men remaining tripled their prices.
 ? In Krasnoyarsk, according to the same Pravda
 article, police barred farmers from hauling their
 produce to market, and, as a result, supplies there
 were scanty.
 ? A July article in the Armenian party journal Kom-
 munist complained that a clampdown on illegal
 personal use of state vehicles had resulted in a
 decline in availability of taxi services.
 ? Izvestiya in late August reported that in Kuybyshev
 efforts to curb nonofficial use of state vehicles
 included clamping down on gypsy cabbies who
 transport peasants from farm to market.
 ? A September Pravda article described citizens' let-
 ters expressing confusion over the goals and results
 of the campaign. Some 49 people from Krasnodar
 Kray complained that they had been charged with
 making unearned income on their private plots.
 Some received fines and others had their plot rights
 taken from them, even a family that largely depend-
 ed on the plot for its own food.
 supplies in Tyumen'      25X1
 Oblast CFMs were down because of restrictions of
 the unearned incomes campaign that hamper trans-
 port of produce from one area to another.
 ? A Soviet official during a Moscow radio interview in
 November cited a letter from a pensioner who
 wondered whether income earned on the side as a
 photographer would be seen as unearned income.
 Two other citizens were concerned that income from
 sale of private-plot produce represented unearned
 income.
 The Dilemma
 A July Pravda editorial blames local officials for
 misinterpreting the new legislation and carrying the
 campaign too far. In fact, however, the fault probably
 lies with conflicting policies that reflect the ambiva-
 lent nature of regime policy toward the second econo-
 my (see figure). On the one hand, the leadership wants
 to tighten control over resources needed for modern-
 ization of the economy. The crackdown on unearned
 incomes is, in part, an attempt to regain control over
 state resources such as vehicles, materials, and labor
 time that are often used for nonofficial purposes.
 However, these resources are not wasted but make a
 substantial contribution to production of various con-
 sumer goods and services. Restrictions on the sources
 of materials and transport needed by peasants to farm

 Any crackdown-such as the unearned incomes campaign-
 that restricts the flow of resources to the private sector will

 policy is liberalized.
 their private plots, for example, have led to reduced
 marketings in CFMs. The dilemma is that at a time of
 slowing growth in consumption and increasing re-
 source stringencies, the leadership is reluctant to
 allow a decline in consumption levels that an attack
 on the second economy involves.
 The leadership's concern with some of the results of
 the campaign suggests it is trying to come to grips
 with the inherent contradiction in its policies that is
 causing confusion among officials and the populace.
 Solutions suggested in the press provide little practical
 guidance. For example, a Pravda editorial empha-
 sized that local officials must distinguish carefully
 between the shady earnings of "speculators and mon-
 ey grubbers" and the earnings of "honest toilers
 engaging in auxiliary farming." How this is to be
 done was not made clear. An August Izvestiya edito-
 rial called for "legal norms defining the status of a

 Secret
 citizen running a subsidiary plot." But it is doubtful
 that establishment of more norms would prevent
 officials from using the concept of "unearned in-
 comes" to crack down on even officially sanctioned
 private activity. Most important, such norms would
 not solve the practical resource problems that peas-
 ants face unless accompanied by greater access to
 needed equipment, materials, and transportation.
 Approval in late November of legislation regulating
 individual work activity could be expected to clear up
 some of the confusion brought on by the unearned
 incomes campaign. It lists, for example, individual
 activities that are considered legal as well as those
 deemed against the law. The new legislation, however,
 does not expand the range of activities that individ-
 uals may legally engage in, with the exception of
 private taxi services and the use of private homes for
 boarding, which were previously considered illegal. As
 in the past, republics are given the right to add to or
 delete from the list of legal activities.
 Like the unearned incomes legislation, the law makes
 clear that individual labor activity must be conducted
 under close state supervision. For example:
 ? All who work in the private sector must obtain
 licenses and pay taxes on their income.
 ? The law restricts participation in private-sector ac-
 tivity by limiting it to pensioners, housewives, stu-
 dents, and moonlighters, and by forbidding the
 hiring of labor.
 ? Between now and 1 May 1987, when the law comes
 into force, detailed regulations concerning taxes and
 prices are to be developed.
 Thus, it is not clear whether even the individual labor
 law clarifies the regime's position on private activity
 either for the local authorities charged to regulate it
 or for participants, who will have to wait for further
 clarification of where the regime stands on the issue.
 L _]the official interviewed over Moscow radio sug-
 gested that the prices that individuals may charge for
 their output will be determined by the state. The
 judicial official said that the law will not allow
 unjustifiably high earnings through "profiteering."
 Overregulation has restricted private activity in the
 past and could pose a threat to personal initiative now.
 More vigorous enforcement of existing regulations on
 taxation and licensing could, in fact, reduce private
 activity or drive it further underground. A Soviet
 official interviewed on Moscow radio said that the
 penalties for repeat violations of the individual labor
 law are two years in a labor camp or a fine up to 1,000
 rubles.
 Just as important, though, limited access to needed
 materials, labor, and supplies will remain a key
 constraint to any expansion of the private sector.
 Enforcement of the unearned incomes campaign will
 continue to limit individuals' access to supplies
 through the second economy. While the leadership
 continues to promise to provide more supplies through
 legal channels, any actual shifts to the private sector
 must compete with the resource needs of Gorbachev's
 effort to modernize the economy, and the state sector
 almost certainly will come out ahead.'
 the law on individual labor
 activity is designed to prevent an outflow of labor
 from state employment.
 Outlook
 An easing of the currently high marginal tax rates on
 privately earned income could encourage personal
 initiative.
 taxation and pricing of private individual
 labor activity are being debated now. However, F
 Gorbachev's comments in Krasnodar in September
 suggest that the regime unrealistically still hopes to
 pursue the crackdown on the second economy while
 ' The lack of willingness by the leadership to increase supplies to
 individuals is illustrated by a Council of Ministers decree published
 in October encouraging the formation of cooperative organizations
 for small-scale production of consumer goods and services. The
 decree emphasizes use of byproducts and scrap materials from state
 enterprises rather than the provision of new materials. The regime
 is hoping to make more efficient use of these secondary resources

 somehow maintaining (and even increasing) the bene-
 fits that flow from legal private activity. Touching on
 the unearned incomes campaign, the General Secre-
 tary stated:
 We condemn the practice whereby certain people
 act to the detriment of the interests of society and
 all others by not participating in public affairs,
 make no contribution to the work of enterprises,
 the kolkhoz, or the sovkhoz and want to develop
 their private ownership aspirations. At the same
 time, we must support all who grow products by
 their own labor activity and those who combine
 work in social production and on their own plot.
 With continuing mixed signals coming from the lead-
 ership, all that may be achieved from Soviet measures
 in this area is increased uncertainty, which-while
 making second-economy participants more wary-
 will also tend to restrict their production activity.
 Clarification of the leadership's policy on the second
 economy will be required for any expansion of legal
 private activity.

 Viewpoint
 The views expressed in the following article are the
 author's and do not necessarily represent a CIA
 consensus.
 Ligachev, Gorbachev, and the
 Configuration of Power in the
 Current Soviet Leadership
 A central question of Soviet politics today is the
 relation of the putative second secretary, Yegor Liga-
 chev, to the General Secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev.'
 Crudely put, is Ligachev basically Gorbachev's agent,
 striving to carry out Gorbachev's program of renewal?
 Or does Ligachev seek to limit Gorbachev's personal
 power and to build a power base of his own?
 First and Second Secretaries:
 A Historical Perspective
 Before examining Ligachev's circumstances and his
 words and actions as they bear on these questions, it is
 useful to consider the historical record of second
 secretaries in relation to the top leader. Nikita Khru-
 shchev, who by 1958 had established himself as the
 effective ruler of the Soviet Union, had three second
 secretaries: Aleksey Kirichenko, who was ousted from
 the leadership in 1960; Frol Kozlov, who opposed
 Khrushchev in 1963 and was soon replaced; and
 Leonid Brezhnev, who conspired against Khrushchev
 and succeeded in ousting him. The record of the East
 European regimes modeled on the USSR is not very
 different: among established leaders, that is, men
 more powerful than Gorbachev is today, the second
 secretary generally has either conspired against the
 general secretary-for example, Erick Honecker (East
 Germany), Eduard Gierek (Poland), Jari Hendryk
 (Czechoslovakia), Todor Zhivkov (Bulgaria)-or been
 replaced by him-for example, Franz Dahlem (East
 Germany), Aleksandr Rankovich (Yugoslavia), Bela
 Biszku (Hungary). Communist China's experience is
 equally striking: Mao Zedong in turn removed Liu
 Shaoqi and Lin Biao, both of whom had held posts
 equivalent to that of second secretary and had been
 designated heir
 The recent experience of Soviet second secretaries
 tends to prove the rule, for their relation to the
 general secretary has been marked by turbulence.
 Although Andrey Kirilenko loyally served Brezhnev
 as second secretary, he lost Brezhnev's favor and was
 replaced by Konstantin Chernenko. Chernenko in
 turn was ousted as second secretary by Yuriy Andro-
 pov, who on Brezhnev's death became General Secre-
 tary. Under Andropov, Chernenko once again became
 second secretary and survived in the post long enough
 (15 months) to succeed Andropov. Gorbachev there-
 upon became second secretary and, when Chernenko
 died a year later, General Secretary. None of the
 three second secretaries before Ligachev-Andropov,

 Gorbachev's Role in Ligachev's Career
 Gorbachev's relationship to his second secretary prob-
 ably is not as antagonistic as that of his immediate
 predecessors. Nevertheless, Ligachev-an Andropov
 protege-was not freely chosen by Gorbachev as
 second secretary. A little over three years ago Liga-
 chev was the party leader in Tomsk, a secondary
 oblast far from Moscow. Why Ligachev was brought
 to Moscow in 1983 to head the cadres department in
 the Central Committee-a key position in effecting
 personnel assignments and policy implementation-is
 not clear. Although he had engaged in cadre work in
 Moscow under Ivan Kapitonov in 1963 and 1964,
 Ligachev did not benefit from Kapitonov's subsequent
 rise. (Moreover, Kapitonov's career was in decline in
 1983, so he was hardly in a position to choose his
 replacement.) Kapitonov's former boss, Kirilenko,
 head of the Bureau for the RSFSR in the first half of
 the 1960s and evidently an unofficial adviser to
 Andropov 20 years later, may have recommended
 Ligachev. At a high point in Andropov's campaign
 against corruption in Brezhnev's family, Ligachev
 called attention, in Pravda, to every leader's responsi-
 bility to set an example in suppressing violations of
 party rules, suggesting he may have played a part in
 the campaign. If so, Andropov, impressed by his
 abilities, might have rewarded Ligachev by bringing
 him to Moscow. In any case, Ligachev, raised from
 relative obscurity to a powerful post under Andropov's
 aegis, was promoted along with other Andropov prote-
 cadres department. Gorbachev apparently lacked the
 power, however, to make such an appointment. He
 was stuck with Ligachev.
 ges in December 1983 to the Secretariat.
 Ligachev's elevation to full member of the Politburo
 occurred after Gorbachev had become General Secre-
 tary in April 1985, but Gorbachev's involvement in
 this promotion is unclear. By then Ligachev had
 played a key role in numerous appointments and had
 helped indoctrinate rising regional leaders who had
 been rotated to Moscow for training, enabling him to
 establish an independent power base. Ligachev evi-
 dently was not Gorbachev's preferred choice as senior
 secretary for cadres. Had he possessed the power, he
 would have done well to emulate Andropov, choosing
 from among regional party secretaries a protege who
 would be dependent upon him. A suitable candidate,
 for example, might have been Georgiy Razumovskiy,
 party first secretary in Krasnodar, who later replaced
 Ligachev in the subordinate position of head of the
 That Ligachev rapidly acquired substantial power and
 authority, hence early recognition as the second secre-
 tary, suggests that he may have been supported by
 other top leaders with the object of limiting Gorba-
 chev's power. For a few months, in fact, Ligachev was
 the only other senior secretary besides Gorbachev. To
 avert the emergence of a duarchy, Gorbachev subse-
 quently succeeded in diluting Ligachev's power by
 making party secretary Lev Zaykov a full Politburo
 member, hence a third senior secretary.' Subsequently
 Gorbachev further strengthened his position in the
 Secretariat by appointing a number of junior secretar-
 ies (Aleksandra Biryukova, Anatoliy Dobrynin, Va-
 dim Medvedev, Viktor Nikonov, Georgiy Razumovs-
 kiy, and Aleksandr Yakovlev) and ousting Brezhnev's
 old associates, Konstantin Rusakov and Boris Pono-
 marev. At present, Gorbachev clearly exerts substan-
 tial influence in the Secretariat, but Ligachev remains
 responsible for cadres, ideology, and aspects of foreign
 and economic policy; roughly half the Central Com-
 mittee's departments work in areas in which he is
 directly engaged. Ligachev's capacity to obstruct Gor-
 bachev's programs, were he so inclined, is substantial.
 Importance of a Reliable Second Secretary
 Gorbachev's interest in having a close adherent man-
 age the Secretariat stems from his ambitious program
 to reform the Soviet system even before he has fully
 consolidated his power. In their first years in office,
 Khrushchev and Brezhnev (like Stalin in the 1920s)
 concentrated on winning control of the party appara-
 tus, and especially the Secretariat, before involving
 themselves deeply in a broad range of policy ques-
 tions. Brezhnev, for example, in the first eight years of
 l Gorbachev and Grigoriy Romanov had also for a short time been
 the only two senior secretaries, a situation that ended in July 1985
 with Romanov's retirement. Thus a pattern is discernible. To the
 two existing senior secretaries, the general secretary and the second
 secretary (in 1985, Gorbachev and Romanov; in 1986, Gorbachev
 and Ligachev), a third is added (in 1985, Ligachev; in 1986,

 his tenure, worked in the party's headquarters Central
 Committee building, not in the Kremlin. Gorbachev,
 on the other hand, has focused on the country's
 problems, which for too long had been allowed to
 deepen and multiply. He is attempting to change
 Soviet foreign policy, economic administration, and
 social policy before he has won control of the party
 machine. Moreover, he is making severe demands on
 party and government officials.
 These weighty demands have met with resistance.
 Malcontents in the party apparatus make up a constit-
 uency to whom an ambitious leader can appeal, and
 who in any case may actively solicit his support. As
 Gorbachev becomes increasingly active in diplomacy,
 he must leave Moscow and rely on the second secre-
 tary to chair meetings of the Politburo and Secretari-
 at. In such circumstances, it is crucial that Gorba-
 chev's second secretary can be relied on to run the
 Secretariat and the party apparatus on Gorbachev's
 behalf while he concentrates on the elaboration and
 refinement of policy and the remaking of the bureau-
 cracy and society.
 Is Ligachev a Reliable Supporter of Gorbachev?
 What manner of man is Ligachev? In his two decades
 in Tomsk, Ligachev's responsibilities were limited to
 running a second-rank province,' and he was not
 directly involved in the making of national policy.
 (Gorbachev had the advantage of sitting in the Polit-
 buro after 1979, where he could at least listen to
 policy debates and read the relevant documents.)
 Unless Ligachev's mind is characterized by unusual
 breadth and imagination, the habits of thought incul-
 cated by long party work may have left him skeptical
 of radical changes in Soviet institutions.` In his long
 career he has displayed a willingness to support
 unconventional ideas on occasion, but has done so
 ' Ligachev as Tomsk's first secretary had to wait 10 years to
 become a full Central Committee member, a status normally held
 by first secretaries in Russian oblasts.
 ' It should be noted, however, that Ligachev had responsible
 contacts with intellectuals and scientists at the founding of Aka-
 demgorodok in the mid-1950s and was actively engaged with
 cautiously, reticently. A Soviet reviewer of his writ-
 ings once accused him of practicing esoteric
 communication:
 In Ye. Ligachev's small book you will not find
 any contradiction to that which is new. He is not
 against it. But he is not speaking out strongly in
 favor of it, either.... Among the tasks of
 centralized planning he fails to mention the
 direct distribution of production and sale of
 output in the products list. And he did so
 correctly! On the basis of this detail an attentive
 and knowledgeable reader will understand what
 the author's position is but the unknowledge-
 able reader will not notice anything.'
 This mode of expressing himself, assuming he still
 practices it 20 years later, suggests that it would be a
 mistake to limit our perception of Ligachev's views to
 what he says explicitly. He may signal his disagree-
 ments with Gorbachev softly, by esoteric communica-
 tions, so that one may learn of them only by being "an
 attentive and knowledgeable reader."
 Having been rescued from Tomsk, Ligachev experi-
 enced a meteoric rise over the last three years that
 brings to mind that of the Bolsheviks in 1917. To what
 does he now aspire? Did he still harbor hopes of
 reaching the centers of power in Moscow while he
 languished in Tomsk at age 62? Having become the
 second most powerful leader in the USSR at age 64,
 how far does he intend to impose his will on events?
 These are crucial questions on which direct evidence
 is lacking. Judged by his actions, however, Ligachev's
 ambitions are not narrowly constrained by advanced
 age. Despite repeated injunctions, voiced by him and
 others in the top leadership, that personal relations
 must not influence cadre appointments, he has pro-
 moted numerous former colleagues, including Alek-
 sandr Mel'nikov, formerly his Tomsk deputy.

 Secret
 Gorbachev may have found his 65-year-old subordi-
 nate acceptable as the second secretary since they
 hold many views in common. They were united in the
 campaign to remove Brezhnev's close lieutenants,
 including Viktor Grishin and Nikolay Tikhonov, and
 in the effort to oust Romanov. (Ligachev benefited
 directly from the removal of Romanov, gaining re-
 sponsibility for the powerful Administrative Organs
 Department. Its head, Nikolay Savinkin, is among the
 few Brezhnev-era department heads who have not yet
 been replaced, perhaps because the major Politburo
 figures have had difficulty in agreeing on a candi-
 date.) Ligachev, even more than Gorbachev, is some-
 thing of an ,ascetic and a moralizer, determined to
 fight alcoholism and corruption. Both see the need to
 modernize Soviet industry, and to improve manage-
 ment by increasing enterprise autonomy and strength-
 ening the planning machinery. They agree on the need
 to eliminate corrupt, alcoholic, and incompetent offi-
 cials. They agree that the Soviet system has deterio-
 rated and are determined to reverse the country's
 downward course. They also agree on a broad pro-
 gram of action to accomplish all this.
 But there are significant differences as well. Gorba-
 chev seems determined to root out inefficiency at
 almost any cost and to remove officials who are not
 wholehearted supporters of his reforms. Ligachev, on
 the other hand, sees a need to preserve the morale of
 the party apparatus and seems to be cultivating the
 good will of its healthy elements. At the 27th Party
 Congress, Ligachev evidently defended the party ap-
 paratus's performance and privileges against sweeping
 criticism by Gorbachev's protege, Boris Yel'tsin, and
 by letters published in Pravda. In a sense, Ligachev
 may have inherited from Chernenko the party appara-
 tus, or a portion of it, as his personal base of power.
 (Ligachev not only survived Chernenko's short period
 in office, but may have benefited from it.) Ligachev
 does not seem as committed as Gorbachev to replac-
 ing incumbents with younger cadres. In his speeches,
 Ligachev has appeared less sanguine about US-Soviet
 relations, more convinced of the need for increased
 defense spending. He has at times seemed somewhat
 skeptical of Gorbachev's optimistic growth targets
 and may have opted for more realistic ones. His
 commitment to Gorbachev's strategy of incremental
 radical reform of the economy may depend on its
 producing substantial successes early.
 While Ligachev is not an opponent or rival of Gorba-
 chev and has acknowledged his position of authority,
 he has sought to limit Gorbachev's power. He has
 specifically called for collective leadership in the
 Politburo and Secretariat, while Gorbachev has large-
 ly avoided the term. Moreover, a number of develop-
 ments adverse to Gorbachev's interests seem most
 readily explained by Ligachev's involvement. Some
 provincial followers of Brezhnev, such as Vladimir
 Shcherbitskiy and, until recently, Dinmukhamed
 Kunayev, have managed to hold on to important posts
 despite repeated Moscow rumors that they were about
 to be purged, which suggests that they have found
 defenders in the leadership. Ligachev appears to have
 established factional alignments with particular re-
 gional leaders, Shcherbitskiy in the Ukraine and
 Kunayev in Kazakhstan, and perhaps with new party
 leaders in the Central Asian republics who have
 replaced Brezhnev's men purged for corruption.
 Meanwhile, Gorbachev has not been accorded the
 offices and ritualistic acknowledgement of authority
 that Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko received
 and that were becoming institutionalized as attributes
 of the general secretary. He has not been chosen
 chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, nor
 has anyone identified him in the central press as
 chairman of the Defense Council. He is rarely called
 head of the Politburo, as his predecessors were. While
 these omissions have been rationalized by Gorba-
 chev's partisans as due to a "cult of modesty," his
 failure to receive these trappings of authority neces-
 sarily raises a question as to the extent of his power.
 Ligachev, the strong advocate of collective leadership
 in the top party organs, may well have had a role in
 denying them to Gorbachev.
 While Ligachev has accumulated considerable power
 in the party apparatus, his influence is circumscribed
 in important ways. As noted, his power in the Secre-
 tariat is limited by that of Gorbachev (to the extent he
 finds time to be active in the Secretariat's affairs), and
 by the presence of Gorbachev's proteges among the
 junior secretaries and department chiefs. Moreover,
 he clearly is not in a position to command the entire
 regional apparatus, but must rely on alliances (for

 secret
 example, in the Ukraine) and persuasion to effect his
 will. The Moscow party organization under Boris
 Yel'tsin is outside his control, and his relationship
 with the party leader in Leningrad, Yuriy Solov'yev,
 is unclear. He has elevated several figures from
 Tomsk to important positions, but the Tomsk party
 organization itself came under attack in the central
 press before the 27th Party Congress.'
 While the configuration of forces in the Secretariat
 leaves Gorbachev dependent on Ligachev for the
 implementation of his policies, this need not imply
 that Ligachev is in a position to challenge Gorbachev
 for the post of general secretary. Gorbachev's impres-
 sive display of political strength at the time of the
 Chernenko succession and subsequently in bringing
 about major changes in the Politburo and Secretariat
 and in gaining the adoption of major new programs
 underlines the danger of underestimating his sources
 of power. Just as Ligachev may have inherited the
 support of elements of the party apparatus from
 Chernenko, Gorbachev appears to have inherited from
 Andropov the support of the KGB. Moreover, Liga-
 chev's colleagues may see him as an apparatchik, a
 technician, rather than a statesman capable of devel-
 oping a program to solve the country's deep problems.
 Hence they might be reluctant to abort the programs
 that are now under way. By this reading of the
 current political situation, then, Ligachev appears to
 be an uncertain ally in realizing Gorbachev's highly
 ambitious policies, even a potential obstacle to them,
 but not a rival for supreme power.
 But what if Gorbachev should falter? While Gorba-
 chev clearly played a key role in bringing down
 Romanov, Tikhonov, and Grishin, this was the work
 not of an individual but of a faction, the faction that
 Andropov had created in his struggle against Brezh-
 nev and in his brief tenure as general secretary. Its
 key members included: Gorbachev, a successful appa-
 ratchik, who subsequently gained much added
 strength from Andropov's support; Ligachev, a rela-
 tively unsuccessful apparatchik who was suddenly
 raised from obscurity by Andropov to manage the
 renewal of the party apparatus; Nikolay Ryzhkov and
 Yel'tsin, two former Sverdlovsk managers and subse-
 quently central administrators whom Andropov
 brought into the party apparatus at a high level to
 improve the economy; Vitaliy Vorotnikov, a victim of
 the Brezhnev-Chernenko faction whom Andropov re-
 called from abroad to help clean up corruption;
 Andrey Gromyko, who deserted Brezhnev for Andro-
 pov; and Viktor Chebrikov, a career party official
 whom Brezhnev brought into the KGB to keep an eye
 on Andropov, but who was instead co-opted by Andro-
 pov and made KGB head.
 While all of these men benefited from Andropov's
 patronage, their backgrounds differ widely and the
 faction's cohesion is questionable. Ligachev has the
 strongest independent power base and represents a
 potential pole of attraction for Gorbachev's oppo-
 nents. Ryzhkov, although he served three years in the
 party Secretariat, appears to be a technocrat assigned
 to administer the economy as head of the government.
 Ryzhkov's commitment to economic reform seems
 lukewarm, and his loyalty to Gorbachev may be
 subject to erosion. (In Soviet history at least four
 government heads turned against the party leader:
 Aleksey Rykov, Georgiy Malenkov, Nikolay Bulga-
 nin, and Aleksey Kosygin.) Yel'tsin currently seems
 closest to Gorbachev politically, but his impatience to
 push through economic and party reforms could an-
 tagonize party apparatchiks on whom Gorbachev
 depends to implement his program. Moreover,
 Yel' tsin's emphasis on collective leadership could
 ultimately bring him into conflict with Gorbachev.
 Vorotnikov, head of the government of the RSFSR,
 earlier appeared slated for higher things, but he was
 overleaped in turn by Ryzhkov, Yel'tsin, and Zaykov.
 (Zaykov is a client of Gorbachev, who raised him from
 obscurity in Leningrad.) The KGB head, Chebrikov,
 currently appears to be a strong supporter of Gorba-
 chev's interests. Inasmuch as both Khrushchev and
 Brezhnev fell victim to the political defection of their
 respective KGB chiefs (Vladimir Semichastny and
 Andropov), Chebrikov's loyalty to Gorbachev could be
 crucial for Gorbachev's extended tenure in office.
 Gromyko's rise to the defense of the party apparatus
 at the 27th Party Congress suggests that, if he is not
 already aligned with Ligachev, he might readily
 become so if the leadership became more factiona-
 lized. Other figures who might influence the outcome

 of a future crisis are Shcherbitskiy, party boss in the
 Ukraine, and Mikhail Solomentsev, head of the Party
 Control Commission, each of whom might ally him-
 self with Ligachev in a confrontation with Gorbachev.
 Gorbachev assuredly has reason to fear the formation
 of a faction centered on Ligachev and involving
 powerful elements.' If Gorbachev's program encoun-
 ters serious setbacks, they could readily give rise to
 turbulence in Soviet politics, perhaps leading Liga-
 chev to challenge Gorbachev's power.
 ' The reduced political weight of the military establishment at
 present, and Gorbachev's evident slighting of its interests, could be
 remedied in the near term perhaps only by its alliance with a
 faction headed by Ligachev. Evidence of the formation of such an
