Foreword (u) 
This volume continues the effort of the CIA History Staff and the 
Center for the Study of Intelligence to make the history of the Central 
Intelligence Agency more accessible and understandable to Agency 
employees and other members of the Intelligence Community. The ed-
itors, both members of the History Staff, have compiled the first collec-
tion of classified, scholarly essays on CIA history to be published in 
book form. Scholars and journalists have tried to interpret the Agency's 
past without having access to its records. Some Agency officers with 
such access have also set down their reflections or penned chronicles of 
various offices and operations. This collection combines the best of 
both approaches; its essays meet academic standards of historical re-
search and presentation, and were prepared from relevant CIA and US 
Government records. (u) 
The editors have attempted to present a balanced picture of the 
Agency's functions and its performance in carrying out its essential 
missions. Successes and setbacks are described here to help the reader 
gain an appreciation of the full historical context in which the Agency 
aided the United States in winning the Cold War and then in adapting to 
new and uncertain international realities. The volume includes essays 
on the work of all four directorates and the major functional tasks of the 
Agency as a whole, spanning the five decades of the Agency's existence 
(but naturally weighted toward the earlier years because of the avail-
ability or sensitivity of sources). They touch on the Agency's presence 
in almost all of the main geographic areas of its work. Many of the es-
says show how the Agency's components worked alongside their coun-
terparts in various parts of the Intelligence Community, the military, 
and other agencies of the US Government. The editors have also taken 
pains to show the many ways in which CIA has served the interests of 
and interacted with policymakers in the White House and Congress. (u) 
The editors have included an explanatory introduction that ties 
the various essays together. It should be read carefully, as it can stand 
alone as a worthy contribution to the interpretive literature on the 
Agency's past. The introduction explains the dynamic tension between

the Agency's several missions, from analysis to collection to covert op-
erations, and highlights the ways in which the fourteen historical arti-
cles in this volume illustrate the problems and the advantages that have 
historically resulted from the combination of such varied responsibili-
ties and capabilities in a single intelligence organization. (u) 
Four of the essays have been previously published; all the rest are 
being made available to a wider readership for the first time here. Most 
were adapted from manuscript histories at various stages of preparation 
under the supervision of the CIA History Staff. Two articles were ex-
cerpted from limited-circulation histories prepared in the 1970s and 
now held in the History Staff's files. A note on the contributors and es-
says, which follows the introduction, explains the origin of each essay 
and summarizes the backgrounds and Agency careers of the respective 
authors. (u)

Introduction (u) 
Almost since its founding, the Central Intelligence Agency has at-
tempted to preserve and interpret its past. As part of this effort, Agency 
officers and historians drafted several hundred historical studies of CIA 
offices and operations. Although concentrating on clandestine activi-
ties, those studies touch on every major field of Agency work. Most of 
these studies have tended to concentrate on the accomplishments of 
Agency leaders, on specific projects, or on individual offices. These 
early histories preserve a wealth of detail about CIA's origins and de-
velopment, but they offer comparatively few insights into the function-
ing of the CIA as a whole and the Agency's role and place in the 
evolving intelligence, foreign policy, and security structures of the US 
Government. (Li) 
In recent years the Agency has sponsored a different way of study-
ing its past. Using newly available files and benefiting from wider de-
classification of US and foreign records, scholars employed by CIA 
have adopted a more comprehensive approach, looking at Agency lead-
ers, activities, and offices as part of US Government policies and oper-
ations and of America's role in the Cold War. The new approach 
examines what the Agency did or did not accomplish in its historical 
setting, instead of merely chronicling the activities of specific individu-
als or offices. (u) 
What these new studies have shown is a tension between the 
Agency's major missions of strategic warning and clandestine activi-
ties. For half a century the Central intelligence Agency has been the na-
tion's primary agency for both missions. Strategic warning entails the 
concentration of information available to the US Government so that 
the discrete bits of publicly and covertly acquired data can be assessed 
for whatever they might reveal of an enemy's or potential adversary's 
intentions and capabilities. Clandestine activities are simply those ac-
tions that the US Government wishes, for reasons of national security, 
to undertake in ways that conceal an official US hand. America, and ev-
ery other nation, has always had some requirement and capability to

perform both missions. Before World War II, however, both functions 
were performed in the breach by the president himself and a few trusted 
advisers, with no controlling authority short of the Oval Office. (u) 
The relationship between these two missions has formed the cen-
tral dynamic in the Agency's unfolding history. No law of nature or in-
telligence practice dictates the same organization provide strategic 
warning and manage covert activities, and these two missions have not 
always fitted together comfortably, as several essays in this volume 
demonstrate. They are not mutually exclusive activities, but it takes a 
conscious effort to make them work harmoniously. Left to their own, 
they often go their separate ways. Nevertheless, conducting both mis-
sions from under the same organizational roof has occasionally given 
rise to opportunities and inspirations that might otherwise have been 
missed. (u) 
These two missions actually came together in the same agency as 
much by accident as by design. The Agency began its statutory exist-
ence in September 1947, but this event in a sense merely ratified a series 
of decisions taken after the end of the Second World War. When Presi-
dent Truman dissolved the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS) 
in September 1945, he had no clear idea how to proceed in building the 
modern peacetime intelligence structure that he and his advisers be-
lieved they needed in an atomic age. Over the course of 1946, the White 
House created a small staff�the Central Intelligence Group (CIG)�to 
collate intelligence reports from the armed services and civilian depart-
ments, and allowed CIG to absorb the espionage and counterintelli-
gence offices left over from OSS (which had been preserved in the War 
Department). Initially these disparate components in the new CIG 
shared little in common except an interest in foreign secrets and a sense 
that both strategic warning and clandestine activities abroad required 
"central" coordination. (u) 
Under a series of capable Directors of Central Intelligence, CIG 
and the Truman administration came to realize how strategic warning 
and clandestine activities complemented one another. This realization 
was codified in the National Security Act of 1947, which renamed CIG 
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and gave it a statutory basis. The 
new CIA's performance in the worsening Cold War in Europe and East 
Asia would soon prove the flexibility and strength of the government's 
new intelligence arm. (u)

President Truman's first mission for the Agency was to collate and 
analyze the pile of cables and reports that daily filled his inbox. Most of 
official Washington remembered all too vividly the surprise attack on 
Pearl Harbor, and the President and many of his aides believed (with 
some justification) that that disaster could have been averted if the var-
ious departments had simply shared their intelligence. This view of in-
telligence analysis had to be modified when it encountered everyday 
reality. Woodrow Kuhns's essay on the Office of Reports and Estimates 
(ORE)�CIA's first analytic arm�explains how the new office spent 
its five-year existence interpreting the intelligence pouring into Wash-
ington. That was no easy task. The capability itself had to be built al-
most from the ground up (in part because the OSS' s pioneering 
Research and Analysis Branch had been disbanded after the war), po-
tential analysts were scarce, and the sources available to CIA were of-
ten, for various reasons, lacking. Dr. Kuhns shows how ORE, before 
DCI Walter Bedell Smith replaced it with a new Directorate of Intelli-
gence, nonetheless built a credible analytic record, particularly in divin-
ing Stalin's unwillingness to risk war to secure Soviet ambitions in 
Europe and Asia. (u) 
The Cold War also placed new demands on CIA's clandestine ser-
vices. Nicholas Dujmovic separately illustrate the 
Agency's attempts under very different conditions to gather intelli-
gence on the growing Communist threat. In Western China, 
 Douglas Mackiernan reported on the deteriorating situation and 
opened contacts with anti-Communist forces before tragically losing 
his life in April 1950 the first CIA officer to die in the line of duty  
Covert action for a time became perhaps the Agency's preeminent 
mission during the Korean war and throughout the tenure of DCI Allen 
Dulles (1953-61). As the ideological battlelines stabilized in Europe 
and the Korean war ended, the main stage of superpower contention 
began shifting to developing nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,

Bold CIA operations convinced President Eisenhower and Agency 
leaders that covert action offered a cheap, effective, and safe means of 
reversing Communist gains in what would come to be called the Third 
World. One of those operations, TPAJAX, is known to scholars and the 
public, but Scott Koch reveals important details of the project. (s) 
Technological advances during the 1950s for the first time permit-
ted Agency officers to surmount the Soviet Union's security systems 
and collect accurate information on deployments and capabilities. Sovi-
et deception measures combined with incomplete intelligence, howev-
er, to convince many US Government officials that the USSR was 
outstripping the United States in the production of jet bombers and 
long-range missiles. This faulty intelligence produced the "bomber 
gap" and "missile gap" controversies. The missile gap in particular 
loomed large after the Soviets' 1957 launch of the Sputnik satellites, 
and even became an issue in the 1960 presidential campaign. According 
to Leonard Parkinson and Logan Potter, hard analytical labor using a 
variety sources�from human agents to manned reconnaissance aircraft 
to the first imagery satellites�proved the missile gap illusory. Accurate 
data from these sources about the scope and pace of Soviet missile de-
ployments may well have saved billions of dollars. From these sources 
President Kennedy soon received Intelligence Community information 
and assessments on the strategic balance that would prove invaluable a 
year later as he sought a peaceful solution to the Cuban Missile Crisis�
the closest the superpowers ever came to nuclear war. (u) 
The growing importance of satellites and other technological 
means prompted DCI John McCone to reorganize and enhance the 
Agency's scientific capabilities in the early 1960s. David Robarge 
shows how McCone ultimately recruited a brilliant young physicist, Al-
bert (Bud) Wheelon, to run the new Directorate of Science and Technol-
ogy (DST). Under Wheelon's leadership, the Directorate during the 
1960s played a major role in the National Reconnaissance Program and 
the development of new collection technologies. Although full consol-
idation of Agency scientific and technical functions would not take 
place until the early 1970s, the DST took primary responsibility for col-
lecting information vital to the Agency's strategic warning mission. (c) 
The conflict in Vietnam consumed much of CIA's operational and 
analytic energies in the 1960s. Tom Ahern's description of the plots 
against President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam in 1963 demon-
strates the importance that CIA's Saigon station played in the direction 
of the war�and the importance that an individual case officer could

suddenly assume in the deliberations in Washington. Harold P. Ford's 
evaluation of the Intelligence Community's analysis of the warning in-
dicators before the Communists' 1968 Tet offensive shows again how 
hard it has been for analysts to anticipate sudden shifts in an opponent's 
strategy. Some CIA and Community officers read the signs and predict-
ed an attack, but the uncertain evidence and the debates among ana-
lysts�and policymakers themselves�prevented a clear warning from 
reaching the White House and commanders in the field. (u) 
The nationwide debates over the Vietnam war fractured the politi-
cal consensus that had long underlain bipartisan support for a strongly 
anti-Communist foreign policy and an activist Central Intelligence 
Agency. The Watergate scandal in the mid-1970s�itself partly a prod-
uct of President Nixon's response to criticism over Vietnam�briefly 
threatened to engulf the Agency. Revelations emerging in conjunction 
with Watergate and allegations of CIA wrongdoing prompted far-
reaching Congressional probes of CIA and the entire Intelligence 
Community. Gerald Haines examines one of the most important of these 
investigations, led by Representative Otis Pike of New York. The Pike 
Committee investigation is not as well-known today as Senator Frank 
Church's Select Committee, but Dr. Haines shows that the House's ef-
fort was, despite its ultimate failure, actually the more insightful of the 
two probes. As such it heralded a new era of Congressional oversight for 
CIA, and a new legal climate for Agency operations. (u) 
The revival of Cold War tensions after the Soviet invasion of Af-

Introduction 
With the end of the Cold War in early 1990s, CIA found itself fac-
ing new challenges. Ironically, some of the problems analysts and oper-
ators faced in this new era look much like those confronting their 
predecessors two generations earlier. Michael Warner's essay on Agen-
cy analysis of Iraqi intentions and capabilities in the Gulf war argues 
that predicting sudden, dramatic shifts in opposition strategy is still as 
difficult as it had been in 1941 or 1968. Technological and political 
changes, however, have added new wrinkles to CIA' s analytical mis-
sion. Dr. Warner explains that "smart weapons" and improved national 
reconnaissance capabilities opened new means of support to American 
military forces in the field, while Congress's growing role as a consum-
er of finished intelligence brought continued questions as well as oppor-
tunities for the Agency. (C) 
Throughout its five decades of operation, the Agency's dedicated 
and sometimes gifted personnel have labored in strange and even dan-
gerous conditions all over the world. Sacrifices were also made by 
employees who labored in safe but nevertheless cramped and uncomfort-
able temporary quarters scattered around downtown Washington during 
the Agency's early years, until the opening of a modern headquarters 
compound in Langley, Virginia, in September 1961. Peyton Anderson 
and Jack Pfeiffer explain how the Original Headquarters Building was 
built, and in the process they explain how and why much of the physical 
environment familiar to so many Agency veterans came to be. Their 
essay chronicles, in particular, the enormous contributions of the Direc-
torate of Support (now the Directorate of Administration), and especially

Few government departments so quickly have the opportunity to 
assess objectively how well they have performed their missions. The 
end of the Cold War provided just such a moment for the Central Intel-
ligence Agency when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1997. Viewed from 
the present, the CIA made a palpable difference in bringing about the 
end of the Soviet empire. The Cold War was in many ways an intelli-
gence struggle, drawing upon the Agency's expertise in foreign collec-
tion, analysis, covert action, counterintelligence, and technological 
innovation. CIA did not win every confrontation, or every battle, but it 
won often enough. The awkward fit between CIA' s primary missions�
strategic warning and clandestine operations abroad�sometimes 
caused problems. That same tension, however, also gave rise to inspira-
tions and innovations that helped to provide the ultimate margin of vic-
tory in the Cold War. (u)

The Creation of the 
Central Intelligence Group (U) 
Michael Warner 
January 1996 marked the 50th anniversary of President Harry 
Truman's appointment of the first Director of Central Intelligence and 
the creation of the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), CIA's institution-
al predecessor. The office diary of the President's chief military advis-
er, Fit. Adm. William D. Leahy, records a rather unexpected event on 
24 January 1946: 
At lunch today in the White House, with only members of the 
Staff present, Rear Admiral Sidney Souers and I were presented 
[by President Truman] with black cloaks, black hats, and wooden 
daggers, and the President read an amusing directive to us outlin-
ing some of our duties in the Central Intelligence Agency [sic], 
"Cloak and Dagger Group of Snoopers."' 
With this whimsical ceremony, President Truman christened 
Sidney W. Souers as the first Director of Central Intelligence. (u) 
The humor and symbolism of this inauguration must have been 
lost on many veterans of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the big 
intelligence and covert action agency that President Truman had sud-
denly dismantled at the end of World War II, only four months earlier. 
CIG inevitably suffered (and still suffers) from comparisons with OSS. 
The Group began its brief existence as a bureaucratic anomaly, with no 
independent budget, no statutory mandate, and staffers loaned from the 
permanent departments of the government. Nevertheless, CIG grew 
rapidly and soon gained a fair measure of organizational autonomy. 
The Truman administration vested it with two basic missions�strate-
gic warning, and the collection of foreign intelligence�although inter-
departmental rivalries prevented the Group from performing either

simultaneously designated the President's representative to the new, four-member Na-

retaries of State, War, and Navy. (6)

mission to the fullest. Strategic warning and clandestine collection are 
the two basic duties of today's CIA.2 (u) 
Historical accounts of President Truman's dissolution of OSS and 
creation of CIG have concentrated on assigning credit to certain actors 
and blame to their opponents and rivals.' The passage of time and the 
gradually expanding availability of sources, however, promise to foster 
more holistic approaches to this subject. (u) 
The problem for the Truman administration that autumn of 1945 
was that no one, including the President, knew just what he wanted, 
while each department and intelligence service knew full well what 
sorts of results it wanted to avoid. With this context in mind, it is infor-
mative to view the gestation of Central Intelligence Group in the fall of 
1945 with an eye toward the way in which Truman administration offi-
cials preserved certain essential functions of OSS and brought them to-
gether again in a centralized, peacetime foreign intelligence agency. 
Those decisions created a peacetime intelligence structure that, while 
still incomplete, preserved some of the most useful capabilities of the 
old OSS while resting on a firmer institutional foundation. (u) 
From War to Peace (u) 
Before World War II, the US Government had not seen fit to cen-
tralize either strategic warning or clandestine activities, let alone combine 
both missions in a single organization. The exigencies of global conflict 
persuaded Washington to build a formidable intelligence apparatus in 
A recent unclassified statement to CIA employees entitled "Vision, Mission, and Val-
ues of the Central Intelligence Agency" identified the following as the CIA's basic mis-
sions: "We support the President, the National Security Council, and all who make and 
execute US national security policy by: 
� Providing accurate, evidence-based comprehensive and timely foreign intelligence 
related to national security; and 
� Conducting counterintelligence activities, special activities, and other functions 
related to foreign intelligence and national security as directed by the President." (u) 
Several authors describe the founding and institutional arrangements of CIG. Three 
CIA officers had wide access to the relevant records in writing their accounts; see 
Arthur B. Darling, The Central Intelligence Agency: An Instrument of Government, to 
1950, (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1990); Thomas F.

Maj. Gen. William J. Donovan (u) 
Maj. Gen. William J. Donovan's Office of Strategic Services. OSS's

Investigation (FBI) and the Military Intelligence Division of the War De-
partment General Staff (better known as the G-2). (Li) 
General Donovan advocated the creation of a permanent foreign 
intelligence service after victory, mentioning the idea at several points 
during the war. President Franklin D. Roosevelt made no promises, 
however, and after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 and the German sur-
render that May, President Truman felt no compulsion to keep OSS 
alive. Mr. Truman apparently disliked Donovan (perhaps fearing that 
Donovan's proposed intelligence establishment might one day be used 
against Americans).5 More importantly, the President and his top mili-
tary advisers knew that America's wartime intelligence success had 
been based not on human sources but on cryptologic breakthroughs�in 
which OSS had played only a supporting role. Signals intelligence was 
the province of the Army and Navy, two jealous rivals that only barely 
cooperated; not even General Donovan contemplated centralized, civil-
ian control of this field. (u) 
President Truman could have tried to transform OSS into a central 
intelligence service conducting clandestine collection, analysis and op-
erations abroad. He declined the opportunity and dismantled OSS in-
stead. Within three years, however, Truman had overseen the creation 
of a central intelligence service conducting clandestine collection, anal-
ysis, and operations abroad. Several authors have concluded from the 
juxtaposition of these facts that Truman dissolved OSS out of igno-
rance, haste, and pique, and that he tacitly admitted his mistake when he 
endorsed the reassembly of many OSS functions in the new CIA. Even 
Presidential aide Clark Clifford has complained that Mr. Truman "pre-
maturely, abruptly and unwisely disbanded the OSS."6 (it) 
A look at the mood in Washington, however, places President Tru-
man's decision in a more favorable light. At the onset of the postwar 
era, the nation and Congress wanted demobilization�fast. OSS was 
already marked for huge reductions in any event because so many of its 
personnel served with guerrilla, commando, and propaganda units 
considered extraneous in peacetime. Congress regarded OSS as a tem-
porary "war agency," one of many bureaucratic hybrids raised for the

national emergency that would have to be weeded out after victory.' 
Indeed, early in 1945 Congress passed a law requiring the White House 
to seek a specific Congressional appropriation for any new agency op-
erating for longer than 12 months.' This obstacle alone might have 
blocked a Presidential attempt to preserve OSS or to create a permanent 
peacetime intelligence agency along the lines of General Donovan's 
plan, especially given the wide circulation of innuendo, planted by 
Donovan's rivals, that the General was urging the creation of an "Amer-
ican Gestapo."9 (ti) 
Truman had barely moved into the Oval Office when he received 
a scathing report on OSS. (Indeed, this same report might well have 
been the primary source for the above-mentioned innuendo.) A few 
months before he died, President Roosevelt had asked an aide, Col. 
Richard Park, Jr., to conduct an informal investigation of OSS and Gen-
eral Donovan. Colonel Park completed his report in March, but appar-
ently Roosevelt never read it. The day after Roosevelt's death, Park 
attended an Oval Office meeting with President Truman. Although no 
minutes of their discussion survived, Colonel Park probably summa-
rized his findings for the new President; in any event, he sent Truman a 
copy of his report on OSS at about that time. That document castigated 
OSS for bumbling and lax security, and complained that Donovan's 
proposed intelligence reform had "all the earmarks of a Gestapo sys-
tem." Colonel Park recommended abolishing OSS, although he conced-
ed that some of the Office's personnel and activities were worth 
preserving in other agencies. OSS's Research and Analysis Branch, in 
particular, could be "salvaged" and given to the State Department. 
Donovan himself hardly helped his own cause. OSS was attached 
to the Executive Office of the President, but technically drew its orders 
and pay from the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Donovan refused to 
compromise on his proposals with JCS representatives delegated to 
study postwar intelligence needs. The General insisted that a permanent 
intelligence arm ought to answer directly to the President and not to his

advisers." The Joint Chiefs had already rescued Donovan once, when 
the Army's G-2 had tried to subsume OSS in 1943. This time the White 
House did not ask the Joint Chiefs' opinion. The JCS stood aside and let 
the Office meet its fate. (u) 
Taking the Initiative (u) 
The White House evidently concluded that the problem was how 
to create a new peacetime intelligence organization without Donovan 
and his Office. Many senior advisers in the Roosevelt and Truman ad-
ministrations believed that the nation needed some sort of permanent in-
telligence establishment; that it could not return to its pre-1941 ways. 
The White House's Bureau of the Budget took up this issue shortly 
before the death of President Roosevelt in April 1945, presenting itself 
to Roosevelt as a disinterested observer, and creating a small team to 
study the government's intelligence requirements and recommend pos-
sible reforms. Soon after he took office, President Truman endorsed the 
Budget Bureau's effort. '2 (U) 
In August, the Budget Bureau began drafting liquidation plans for 
OSS and other war agencies, but initially the Bureau assumed that liq-
uidation could be stretched over a period of time sufficient to preserve 
OSS' s most valuable assets while the Office liquidated functions and 
released personnel no longer needed in peacetime. On 27 or 28 August, 
however, the President or his principal "reconversion" advisers (Budget 
Director Harold D. Smith, Special Counsel Samuel Rosenman, and 
Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion John W. Snyder) sud-
denly recommended dissolving OSS almost immediately.13 Bureau 
staffers had already conceived the idea of giving a part of OSS, the 
Research and Analysis Branch (R&A), to the State Department as "a 
going concern." The imminent dissolution of OSS meant that some-
thing had to be done quickly about the rest of the Office; someone in the

Budget Bureau (probably the Assistant Director for Administrative 
Management, Donald C. Stone) quickly decided that the War Depart-
ment could receive the remainder of OSS "for salvage and liquida-
tion."4 Stone told frustrated OSS officers on 29 August that important 
functions of the Office might survive: 
Stone stated that he felt that the secret and counterintelligence 
activities of OSS should probably be continued at a fairly high 
level for probably another year. He said he would support such a 
program. '5 (U) 
The reconversion trio of Smith, Snyder and Rosenman endorsed 
the Budget Bureau's general plan for intelligence reorganization and 
passed it to President Truman on 4 September 1945.6 Donovan predict-
ably exploded when he learned of the plan, but the President ignored 
Donovan's protests, telling Harold Smith on 13 September to "recom-
mend the dissolution of Donovan's outfit even if Donovan did not like 
it." Within a week the Budget Bureau had the requisite papers ready 
for the President's signature. Executive Order 9621 on 20 September 
dissolved OSS as of 1 October 1945, sending R&A to State and every-
thing else to the War Department. The Order also directed the Secretary 
of War to liquidate OSS activities "whenever he deems it compatible 
with the national interest." � That same day, President Truman sent a let-
ter of appreciation (drafted by Donald Stone) to General Donovan.�

would maintain certain OSS components providing "services of a mili-
tary nature the need for which will continue for some time."2� (U) 
OSS was through, but what would survive the wreck? The Presi-
dent probably gave little thought to those ostensibly necessary "services 
of a military nature" that would somehow continue under War Depart-
ment auspices. Truman shared the widespread feeling that the govern-
ment needed better intelligence, although he provided little positive 
guidance on the matter and said even less about intelligence collection 
(as opposed to its collation). He commented to Budget Director Harold 
Smith in September 1945 that he had in mind "a different kind of intel-
ligence service from what this country has had in the past"; a "broad in-
telligence service attached to the President's office."21 Later remarks 
clarify these comments slightly. Speaking to an audience of CIA em-
ployees in 1952, President Truman reminisced that, when he first took 
office, there had been "no concentration of information for the benefit 
of the President. Each Department and each organization had its own in-
formation service, and that information service was walled off from 
every other service."22 (U) 
Mr. Truman's memoirs subsequently expanded on this point, 
explaining what was at stake: 
I have often thought that if there had been something like coordi-
nation of information in the government it would have been more 
difficult, if not impossible, for the Japanese to succeed in the 
sneak attack at Pearl Harbor. In those days [1941] the military did 
not know everything the State Department knew, and the diplo-
mats did not have access to all the Army and Navy knew. 23 
These comments suggest that President Truman viewed strategic 
warning�preserving the United States from another Pearl Harbor in a 
nuclear age�as the primary mission of his new intelligence establish-
ment, and as a function that had to be handled centrally. His remarks 
also suggest that he viewed intelligence analysis as largely a matter of

collation; the facts would speak for themselves, if only they could be 
gathered in one place. That is what he wanted his new intelligence ser-
vice to do. (u) 
The Budget Bureau itself had not proposed anything that 
looked much clearer. Bureau staffers wanted the State Department to 
serve as the president's "principal staff agency" in developing "high-
level intelligence," after taking the lead in establishing the "integrat-
ed Government-wide program."24 At the same time, however, Bud-
get Bureau officers wanted the departments to continue to conduct 
their own intelligence functions, rather than relegating this duty to 
"any single central agency." A small interagency group, "under the 
leadership of the State Department," would coordinate the depart-
mental intelligence operations.25 This proposed program rested on 
two assumptions that would soon be tested: that the State Depart-
ment was ready to take the lead, and that the armed services were 
willing to follow. (u) 
In the meantime, General Donovan fumed about the President's 
decision yet again to Budget Bureau staffers who met with him (on 
22 September) to arrange the details of the Office's dissolution. An 
oversight in the drafting of EO 9621 had left the originally proposed ter-
mination date of 1 October unchanged in the final signed version, and 
now Donovan had less than two weeks to dismantle his sprawling agen-
cy. One official of the Budget Bureau subsequently suggested to Donald 
Stone that the War Department might ease the transition by keeping its 
portion of OSS functioning "for the time being," perhaps even with 
Donovan in charge. Stone preferred someone other than Donovan for 
this job, and promised to discuss the idea with Assistant Secretary of 
War John J. McCloy on 24 September.26 (u) 
Two days later, McCloy stepped into the breach. Where Donald 
Stone had simply ensured that pieces of OSS kept a temporary lease on 
life in the War Department, McCloy glimpsed an opportunity to do 
much more: to save these components as the nucleus of a peacetime 
intelligence service. McCloy was a friend of Donovan's and had long 
promoted an improved national intelligence capability.27He interpreted

The Creation 
the President's directive as broadly as possible by ordering OSS ' s Dep-
uty Director for Intelligence, Brig. Gen. John Magruder, to preserve his 
Secret Intelligence (SI) and counterespionage (X-2) Branches "as a go-
ing operation" in a new office that McCloy dubbed the "Strategic Ser-
vices Unit" (ssu): 
This assignment of the OSS activities.. .is a method of carrying 
out the desire of the President, as indicated by representatives of 
the Bureau of the Budget, that these facilities of OSS be examined 
over the next three months with a view to determining their appro-
priate disposition. Obviously this will demand close liaison with 
the Bureau of the Budget, the State Department and other agen-
cies of the War Department, to insure that the facilities and assets 
of OSS are preserved for any possible future use.... The situation 
is one in which the facilities of an organization, normally shrink-
ing in size as a result of the end of fighting, must be preserved so 
far as potentially of future usefulness to the country." (U) 
The following day, the new Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, 
confirmed this directive and implicitly endorsed Assistant Secretary 
McCloy's interpretation, formally ordering Magruder to report to Mc-
Cloy and to "preserve as a unit such of these functions and facilities as 
are valuable for permanent peacetime purposes" [emphasis added].29 
With this order, Patterson postponed indefinitely the assimilation of 
OSS ' s records and personnel into the War Department's own intelli-
gence arm, the G-2. (u) 
General Magruder soon had to explain this unorthodox arrange-
ment to sharp-eyed Congressmen and staff. Rep. Clarence Cannon, 
chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, asked the 
General on 2 October about the OSS contingents sent to the State and 
War Departments and the plans for disposing of OSS ' s unspent funds 
(roughly $4.5 million). Magruder explained that he did not quite know 
what State would do with R&A; when Cannon asked about the War De-
partment's contingent (SSU), the General read aloud from the Secretary 
of War's order to preserve OSS' s more valuable functions "as a unit."3�

Two weeks later, staffers from the House Military Affairs Committee 
asked why the War Department suddenly needed both SSU and the G-2: 
General Magruder explained that he had no orders to liquidate 
OSS (other than, of course, those functions without any peace 
time significance) and that only the Assistant Secretary of War 
[McCloyl could explain why OSS had been absorbed into the War 
Department on the basis indicated. He said he felt, however,... 
that the objective was to retain SSU intact until the Secretary of 
State had surveyed the intelligence field and made recommenda-
tions to the President. 
Committee staff implicitly conceded that the arrangement made 
sense, but hinted that both SSU and the remnant of R&A in the State 
Department ought to be "considerably reduced in size."3 (u) 
Reducing SSU is just what was occupying the Unit's new Execu-
tive Officer, Col. William W. Quinn: 
The orders that General Magruder received from the Secretary of 
War were very simple. He was charged with preserving the intelli-
gence assets created and held by OSS during its existence and the 
disbandment of paramilitary units, which included the 101 detach-
ment in Burma and Southeast Asia, and other forms of intelli-
gence units, like the Jedburgh teams, and morale operations, et 
cetera. My initial business was primarily liquidation. The main 
problem was the discharge of literally thousands of people. Con-
sequently, the intelligence collection effort more-or-less came to a 
standstill." (U) 
Magruder did his best to sustain morale in the Unit, keeping his 
deputies informed about high-level debates over "the holy cause of 
central intelligence," as he jocularly dubbed it. He suggested optimisti-
cally that SSU would survive its current exile: 
In the meantime I can assure you there is a great deal of serious 
thinking in high places regarding the solution that will be made for 
OSS ESSIJ1. I hope it will prove fruitful. There is a very serious

aspects of our work." (U) 
Despite Magruder's and Quinn's efforts, the House of Represen-
tatives on 17 October lopped $2 million from the OSS terminal budget 
that SSU shared with the Interim Research and Intelligence Service 
(IRIS), its erstwhile sister branch now set in the Department of State. 
The cut directly threatened both SSU and IRIS. The Truman adminis-
tration eventually convinced Congress to drop the House's recision and 
even increase funding for both pieces of OSS, but not until after several 
anxious weeks in SSU and the War Department. 34 
Institutional enemies closer to hand also seemed to threaten SSU's 
independence that fall. Just before Thanksgiving, McCloy warned Sec-
retary Patterson that only "close supervision" could prevent the Depart-
ment from taking "the course of least resistance by merely putting 
[SSU] into what I think is a very unimaginative section of G-2 and thus 
los[ing] a very valuable and necessary military asset."35 General 
Magruder told his lieutenants that SSU was quietly winning friends in 
high places, but repeatedly reminded staffers of the need for discretion, 
noting that "some people" did not like SSU "and the less said about [the 
Unit] the better."36 (U) 
Controversy and Compromise (u) 
McCloy (with Stone's help) had precipitated an inspired bureau-
cratic initiative that would eventually expand the Truman administra-

subsequent interagency debates over the new intelligence agency's 
structure and authorities that autumn, SSU preserved OSS' s foreign in-

responsibility. The Truman administration waged a heated internal ar-
gument over which powers to give to the new intelligence service. The 
Secretaries of State, War, and Navy, who quickly agreed that they 
should oversee the proposed office, stood together against rival plans 
proposed by the Bureau of the Budget and the FBI. The Army and Na-
vy, however, would not accept the State Department's insistence that 
the new office's director be selected by and accountable to the Secretary 
of State. The armed services instead preferred a plan outlined by the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff back in September, which proposed lifting the new 
intelligence agency outside the Cabinet departments by placing it under 
a proposed National Intelligence Authority.31 (U) 
This was the plan that would soon settle the question of where to 
place SSU. The JCS had been working on this plan for months, having 
been spurred to action by General Donovan's 1944 campaigning for a 
permanent peacetime intelligence agency. In September, JCS Chairman 
William Leahy had transmitted the plan (JCS 1181/5) to the Secretary 
of the Navy and the Secretary of War, who sent it on to the State De-
partment, where it languished for several weeks. The plan proposed, 
among other things, that a new "Central Intelligence Agency" should, 
among its duties, perform "such services of common concern as the Na-
tional Intelligence Authority determines can be more efficiently accom-
plished by a common agency, including the direct procurement of 
intelligence." This artful ambiguity�"services of common con-
cern"�meant espionage and liaison with foreign intelligence services, 
the core of clandestine foreign intelligence. Everyone involved knew 
this, but no one in the administration or the military wanted to say such 
things out loud; hence the obfuscation.39 In any case, here was another 
function that the drafters of the JCS plan felt had to be performed, or at 
least coordinated, "centrally." (U) 
In December 1945 an impatient President Truman asked to see 
both the State Department's and the Joint Chiefs' proposals and decided 
that the latter looked simpler and more workable. This decision dashed 
the Budget Bureau's original hope that the State Department would lead 
the government's foreign intelligence program. Early in the new year, 
Truman created the Central Intelligence Group, implementing what was

in essence a modification of the JCS 1181/5 proposal. President Truman 
persuaded Capt. (soon to be Rear Admiral) Sidney Souers, the Assistant 
Chief of Naval Intelligence and a friend of Navy Secretary Forrestal 
(and Presidential aide Clark Clifford) who had advised the White House 
on the intelligence debate, to serve for a few months as the first Director 
of Central Intelligence.40 The CIG formally came into being with the 
President's directive of 22 January 1946. Cribbing text from JCS 1181/ 
5, the President authorized CIG to "perform, for the benefit of said in-
telligence agencies, such services of common concern as the National 
Intelligence Authority determines can be more efficiently accomplished 
centrally."4' Here was the loaded phrase "services of common concern" 
again, only this time the telltale clause "including the direct procure-
ment of intelligence" had discreetly disappeared. (With minor editing, 
the phrase would reappear again in the CIA's enabling legislation, the 
National Security Act of 1947.) (U) 
Two days later, on 24 January, President Truman invited Sidney 
Souers to the White House to award him his black cape and wooden 
dagger. Thanks in part to McCloy' s order to preserve OSS' s SI and X-
2 Branches, the "cloak and dagger" capability�the "services of com-
mon concern" mentioned in the President's directive�was waiting in 
the War Department for transfer to the new CIG. General Magruder qui-
etly applauded Souers's appointment as DCI, explaining to his deputies 
that SSU might soon be moving: 
With respect to SSU, we and the War Department are thinking 
along the same lines: that at such time as the Director [of Central 
Intelligence] is ready to start operating, this Unit, its activities, 
personnel, and facilities will become available to the Director, but 
as you know, the intent of the President's [22 January] directive 
was to avoid setting up an independent agency. Therefore, the 
Central Intelligence Group, purposely called the Group, will uti-
lize the facilities of several Departments. This Unit will become 
something in the way of a contribution furnished by the War 
Department.42 (u)

The Creation 
From Small Beginnings (u) 
An eminent historian once remarked that the crowning achieve-
ment of historical research is to attain an understanding of how things 
do not happen. To put it simply, history rarely offers up tidy events and 
clear motivations. President Truman did not follow a neat plan in found-
ing the Central Intelligence Group. He implicitly imposed two broad re-
quirements on his advisers and departments in the fall of 1945: to create 
a structure that could collate the best intelligence held by the various de-
partments, and to make that structure operate, at least initially, on funds 
derived from the established agencies. Indeed, the friction and waste of 
the process that resulted from this vague guidance prompted the com-
plaint that the President had acted rashly in dissolving OSS and ignoring 
the advice of intelligence professionals like William J. Donovan. (u) 
In the fall of 1945, the President vaguely wanted a new kind of 
centralized intelligence service, but his Cabinet departments and exist-
ing services knew fairly specifically what kinds of central intelligence 
they did not want. Between these two realities lay the gray area in which 
the Central Intelligence Group was founded and grew in 1946. Truman 
always took credit for assigning CIG the task of providing timely stra-
tegic warning and guarding against another Pearl Harbor. CIG acquired 
its second mission�the conduct of clandestine activities abroad�in 
large part through the foresight of Donald Stone and John J. McCloy. 
These two appointees ensured that trained personnel stayed together as 
a unit ready to join the new peacetime intelligence service. Within 
months of its creation, CIG had become the nation's primary agency for 
strategic warning and the management of clandestine activities abroad, 
and within two years the Group would bequeath both missions to its 
successor, the Central Intelligence Agency. (u) 
The relationship�and tension�between the two missions (strate-
gic warning and clandestine activities) formed the central dynamic in 
unfolding early history of CIA. Many officials thought that the two 
should be handled "centrally," although not necessarily by a single 
agency. That they ultimately were combined under one organization 
(CIG and then CIA) was due largely to the efforts of McCloy and 
Magruder. Nevertheless, it is clear from the history of the SSU that 
high-level Truman administration officials acted with the tacit assent of 
the White House in preserving OSS' s most valuable components to be-
come the nucleus of the nation's foreign intelligence capability. Presi-
dent Truman's actions do not deserve the charge of incompetence that

yet 
has been leveled against them, but it does seem justified to conclude that 
Truman's military advisers deserve most of the credit for the creation of 
a CIG that collected as well as collated foreign intelligence. (u)

The Office of Reports and Estimates (U) 
Woodrow J. Kuhns 
During World War II, the United States made one of its few orig-
inal contributions to the craft of intelligence: the invention of multi-
source, nondepartmental analysis. The Research and Analysis (R&A) 
Branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) assembled a talented 
cadre of analysts and experts to comb through publications and intelli-
gence reports for clues to the capabilities and intentions of the Axis 
powers. R&A's contributions to the war effort impressed even the 
harshest critics of the soon-to-be dismantled OSS. President Truman 
paid implicit tribute to R&A in late 1945 when he directed that it be 
transplanted bodily into the State Department at a time when most of 
OSS was being demobilized. The transplant failed, however, and the in-
dependent analytical capability patiently constructed during the war had 
all but vanished when Truman moved to reorganize the nation's peace-
time intelligence establishment at the beginning of 1946. (u) 
Current Intelligence Versus National Intelligence (u) 
The Central Reports Staff, home to the analysts in the Central In-
telligence Group (CIG), was born under a cloud of confusion in January 
1946. ' Specifically, no consensus existed on what its mission was to be, 
although the President's concerns in creating CIG were clear enough. In 
the uncertain aftermath of the war, he wanted to be sure that all relevant 
information available to the US Government on any given issue of na-
tional security would be correlated and evaluated centrally so that the 
' The name of the Central Reports Staff was changed in July 1946 to the Office of Re-
search and Evaluations, and again in October 1946 to the Office of Reports and Esti-
mates (ORE), by which name it was known until it was abolished in November 1950. 
CIA veterans typically use "ORE" as the shorthand name for the analytical office for 
the whole period 1946-1950. (u)

country would never again have to suffer a devastating surprise attack 
as it had at Pearl Harbor.' (u) 
How this was to be accomplished, however, was less clear. The 
President himself wanted a daily summary that would relieve him of the 
chore of reading the mounds of cables, reports, and other papers that 
constantly cascaded onto his desk. Some of these were important, but 
many were duplicative and even contradictory.' In the jargon of intelli-
gence analysis, Truman wanted CIG to produce a "current intelligence" 
daily publication that would contain all information of immediate inter-
est to him.4 
Truman's aides and advisers, however, either did not understand 
this or disagreed with him, for the presidential directive of 22 January 
1946 authorizing the creation of CIG did not mention current intelli-
gence. The directive ordered CIG to "accomplish the correlation and 
evaluation of intelligence relating to the national security, and the ap-
propriate dissemination within the Government of the resulting strate-
gic and national policy intelligence."5 Moreover, at the first meeting of 
the National Intelligence Authority (NIA) on 5 February, Secretary of 
State Byrnes objected to the President's idea of a current intelligence 
summary from CIG, claiming that it was his responsibility as Secretary 
of State to furnish the President with information on foreign affairs.6 (u) 
Truman wrote in his memoirs that he had "often thought that if there had been some-
thing like coordination of information in the government it would have been more dif-
ficult, if not impossible, for the Japanese to succeed in the sneak attack at Pearl Harbor."

to 1950 (University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1990), p. 81. (U) 
Current intelligence was defined in National Security Council Intelligence Directive 
No. 3, "Coordination of Intelligence Production," 13 January 1948, as "that spot infor-
mation or intelligence of all types and forms of immediate interest and value to operat-
ing or policy staffs, which is used by them usually without the delays incident to 
complete evaluation or interpretation." See United States Department of State, Foreign 
Relations of the United States 1945-1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment

Byrnes apparently then went to Truman and asked him to recon-
sider. Adm. Sidney Souers, the first Director of Central Intelligence 
(DCI), told a CIA historian that Byrnes' argument: 
ran along the line that such information was not intelligence 
within the jurisdiction of the Central Intelligence Group and the 
Director of Central Intelligence]. President Truman conceded 
that it might not be generally considered intelligence, but it was 
information which he needed and therefore it was intelligence to 
him. The result was agreement that the daily summaries should be 
"factual statements." The Department of State prepared its own 
digest, and so the President had two summaries on his desk.' 
This uneasy compromise was reflected in the NIA directives that 
outlined CIG' s duties. Directive No. 1, issued on 8 February 1946, 
ordered CIG to "furnish strategic and national policy intelligence to the 
President and the State, War, and Navy Departments."' National Intel-
ligence Authority Directive No. 2, issued the same day, ordered the DCI 
to give "first priority" to the "production of daily summaries containing 
factual statements of the significant developments in the field of intelli-
gence and operations related to the national security and to foreign 
events for the use of the President." 9 (U) 
In practice, this approach proved unworkable. Without any com-
mentary to place a report in context, or to make a judgment on its likely 
veracity, the early Daily Summaries probably did little but confuse the 
'Darling, The Central Intelligence Agency, pp. 81, 82. (u) 
'National Intelligence Authority Directive No. 1, "Policies and Procedures Governing 
the Central Intelligence Group," 8 February 1946, Emergence of the Intelligence Estab-
lishment, pp. 329-331. After CIA was established, National Security Council Intelli-
gence Directive No. 1, "Duties and Responsibilities," issued on 12 December 1947, 
again ordered the DCI to produce national intelligence, which the Directive stated 
should be "officially concurred in by the Intelligence Agencies or shall carry an agreed 
statement of substantial dissent." National Security Council Intelligence Directive No. 
3, 13 January 1948, gave CIA the authority to produce current intelligence: "The CIA 
and the several agencies shall produce and disseminate such current intelligence as may 
be necessary to meet their own internal requirements or external responsibilities." See 
Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, pp. 1119-1122; 1109-1112. (u) 
9 National Intelligence Authority Directive No. 2, "Organization and Functions of the 
Central Intelligence Group," 8 February 1946, Emergence of the Intelligence Establish-
ment, pp. 331-333. Interestingly, Souers, who drafted both NIA Directive 1 and Direc-
tive 2, continued to believe that CIG's principal responsibility was the production of 
strategic and national policy intelligence. In a memorandum to the NIA on 7 June 1946, 
Souers wrote that the "primary function of C.I.G. in the production of intelligence... 
will be the preparation and dissemination of definitive estimates of the capabilities and 
intentions of foreign countries as they affect the national security of the United States."

President. An alarming report one day on Soviet troop movements in 
Eastern Europe, for example, would be contradicted the next day by a 
report from another source. Everyone involved eventually realized the 
folly of this situation, and analytical commentaries began to appear in 
the Daily Summaries in December 1946�episodically at first, and then 
regularly during 1947. The Weekly Summary, first published in June 
1946 on the initiative of the Central Reports Staff itself, was also sup-
posed to avoid interpretative commentary, but its format made such a 
stricture difficult to enforce. From its inception, the Weekly Summary 
proved to be more analytical than its Daily counterpart. (U) 
The Confusion Surrounding National Intelligence (U) 
Similar disarray surrounded CIG' s responsibilities in the produc-
tion of "strategic and national policy intelligence." The members of the 
Intelligence Community simply could not agree on the policies and pro-
cedures that governed the production of this type of intelligence. Most 
of those involved seemed to believe that national intelligence should be 
coordinated among all the members of the Intelligence Community, that 
it should be based on all available information, that it should try to esti-
mate the intentions and capabilities of other countries toward the United 
States, and that it should be of value to the highest policymaking bodies. 
(U) 
The devil was in the details. High-ranking members of the intelli-
gence and policy communities debated, without coming to a consensus, 
most aspects of the estimate production process, including who should 
write them, how other agencies should participate in the process if at all, 
and how dissents should be handled. Some of this reflected genuine dis-
agreement over the best way to organize and run the Intelligence Com-
munity, but it also involved concerns about bureaucratic power and 
prerogatives, especially those of the DCI and his Office of Reports and 
Estimates (ORE), both newcomers to the Intelligence Community. 
Even the definition of "strategic and national intelligence" had implica-
tions for the authority of the DCI and thus was carefully argued over by 
others in the Community. '� (U) 
DCI Vandenberg eventually got the NIA to agree to a definition in 
February 1947, but it was so general that it did little to solve the problems

that abounded at the working level." Ray Cline, a participant in the pro-
cess of producing the early estimates, wrote in his memoirs that: 
It cannot honestly be said that it [ORE] coordinated either intelli-
gence activities or intelligence judgments; these were guarded 
closely by Army, Navy, Air Force, State, and the FBI. When 
attempts were made to prepare agreed national estimates on the 
basis of intelligence available to all, the coordination process was 
interminable, dissents were the rule rather than the exception, and 
every policymaking official took his own agency's intelligence 
appreciations along to the White House to argue his case. The pre-
war chaos was largely recreated with only a little more lip service 
to central coordination.12 (u) 
In practice, much of the intelligence produced by ORE was not 
coordinated with the other agencies; nor was it based on all information 
available to the US Government. The Daily and Weekly Summaries 
were not coordinated products, and, like the other publications 
produced by ORE, they did not contain information derived from 
"The NIA agreed that "strategic and national policy intelligence is that composite in-
telligence, interdepartmental in character, which is required by the President and other 
high officers and staffs to assist them in determining policies with respect to national 
planning and security.... It is in that political-economic-military area of concern to more 
than one agency, must be objective, and must transcend the exclusive competence of 
any one department." "Minutes of the 9th Meeting of the National Intelligence Author-
ity," 12 February 1947, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, p. 492. After the 
establishment of CIA, National Security Council Intelligence Directive No. 3, 13 Janu-
ary 1948, similarly defined national intelligence as "integrated departmental intelli-
gence that covers the broad aspects of national policy and national security, is of 
concern to more than one Department... and transcends the exclusive competence of a 
single department." See Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, p. 1111. (u) 
12 Ray S. Cline, Secrets, Spies, and Scholars: Blueprint of the Essential CIA (Washing-
ton, D.C.: Acropolis Books, 1976), pp. 91, 92. Cline rose to become Deputy Director 
for Intelligence (DDI) between 1962 and 1966. Another veteran of the period, R. Jack 
Smith, who edited the Daily Sununary, made the same point in his memoirs, The Un-
known CIA (Washington: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1989), p. 42: "We were not fulfilling 
our primary task of combining Pentagon, State Department, and CIA judgments into na-
tional intelligence estimates.... To say it succinctly, CIA lacked clout. The military and 
diplomatic people ignored our statutory authority in these matters, and the CIA leader-
ship lacked the power to compel compliance." Smith also served as DDI, from 1966 to 
1971. (u)

communications intelligence. '3 The Review of the World Situation, 
which was distributed each month at meetings of the National Security 
Council, became a unilateral publication of ORE after the first two is-
sues.14 The office's ad hoc publications, such as the Special Evaluations 
and Intelligence Memoranda, were rarely coordinated with the other 
agencies. By contrast, the ORE series of Special Estimates were coor-
dinated, but critics nonetheless condemned many of them for contain-
ing trivial subjects that fell outside the realm of "strategic and national 
policy intelligence." (o) 
Whatever CIG' s written orders, in practice the President's interest 
in the Daily Summaries, coupled with the limited resources of the Cen-
tral Reports Staff, meant that the production of current intelligence 
came to dominate the Staff and its culture. National estimative intelli-
gence was reduced to also-ran status. An internal CIG memo stated 
frankly that "ORE Special Estimates are produced on specific subjects 
as the occasion arises and within the limits of ORE capabilities after 
current intelligence requirements are met." It went on to note, "Many 
significant developments worthy of ORE Special Estimates have not 
been covered...because of priority production of current intelligence, 
insufficient personnel, or inadequate information."16 This remained true 
even after the Central Reports Staff evolved into the Office of Reports 
and Estimates in CIA. " (u) 
If the analysts in CIG, and then CIA, had only to balance the com-
peting demands of current and national intelligence, their performance 
might have benefited. As it happened, however, NIA Directive No. 5 
Smith, The Unknown CIA, pp. 34, 35. ORE began receiving signals intelligence in 
1946 and was able to use it as a check against the articles it included in the Summaries. 
Security concerns prevented its broader use. Signals intelligence was sent to the White 
House by the Army Security Agency (from 1949 on, the Armed Forces Security Agen-
cy) during this period. CIA did not begin including communications intelligence in the 
successor to the Daily until 1951. (u)

soon gave the analysts the additional responsibility of performing "such 
research and analysis activities" as might "be more efficiently or effec-
tively accomplished centrally." '8 In practice, this meant that the analysts 
became responsible for performing basic research as well as wide-
ranging political and economic analysis. To accommodate this 
enhanced mission, functional analysis branches for economics, science, 
transportation, and map intelligence were established alongside the 
existing regional branches. (u) 
A high-ranking ORE officer of the period, Ludwell Montague, 
wrote that this: 
was a deliberate, but covert, attempt to transform ORE (or CRS, a 
staff designed expressly for the production of coordinated national 
intelligence) into an omn i competent ...central research agency. 
This attempt failed, leaving ORE neither the one thing nor the 
other. Since then, much ORE production has proceeded, not from 
any clear concept of mission, but from the mere existence of a 
nondescript contrivance for the production of nondescript intelli-
gence. All our efforts to secure a clear definition of our mission 
have been in vain.20 (u) 
Another veteran of the period, George S. Jackson, agreed with 
Montague's assessment: "It would not be correct.. .to say that the 
Office...had failed utterly to do what it was designed to do; a more ac-
curate statement would be that it had done not only what was planned 
for it but much that was not planned and need not have been done. In

Intelligence," 8 July 1946, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, p. 392. (U) 
The Scientific Intelligence Branch of ORE was established in January 1947 and short-
ly thereafter incorporated the Nuclear Energy Group, which had been in charge of atom-
ic energy intelligence in the Manhattan Project, within its ranks. At the end of 1948, the 
branch was separated from ORE and elevated to office status, becoming the Office of 
Scientific Intelligence. (u)

"deliberate but covert" attempt to increase the responsibility of ORE refers to the efforts 
of DCI Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg to boost himself, and CIG as a whole, into a dominant 
position in the Intelligence Community. Opposition from the other departments largely 
scuttled his attempts in this direction. See Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment,

consequence, the Office had unnecessarily dissipated its energies to the 
detriment of its main function."21 He noted that: 
Requests [for studies] came frequently from many sources, not all 
of them of equal importance, but there seemed not to be anyone in 
authority [in ORE] who would probe beneath any of them to make 
sure that they merited a reply. Nor was there anyone who took it 
upon himself to decline requests�no matter from what source�
when they were clearly for a type of material not called for under 
the responsibilities of the Office of Reports and Estimates.22 (u) 
A Mixed Reception (U) 
NIA Directive No. 5 opened the door to proliferation of various 
kinds of publications and, consequently, to a dilution of analysts' efforts 
in the fields of current and national intelligence.23 Perhaps as a conse-
quence of the confusion over the analytical mission, these products 
received mixed reviews. The President was happy with his Daily Sum-
mary, and that fact alone made it sacrosanct. Rear Adm. James H. 
Foskett, the President's Naval Aide, told ORE in 1947 that, "the Presi-
dent considers that he personally originated the Daily, that it is prepared 
in accordance with his own specifications, that it is well done, and that 
in its present form it satisfies his requirements."24 President Truman's 
views on the Weekly Summary were less clear, but lack of criticism was 
construed as approval by ORE: "It appears that the Weekly in its present 
form is acceptable at the White House and is used to an undetermined 
extent without exciting comment indicative of a desire for any particu-
lar change."25 (u) 
Other policymakers were less impressed with the current intelli-
gence publications. Secretary of State George Marshall stopped reading 
the Daily Summary after two weeks, and thereafter he had his aide flag 
only the most important items for him to read. The aide did this only two 
"Jackson, Office of Reports and Estimates, 1946-1951, vol. 1, p. 95. (U) 
" Ibid., p. 98. (u) 
" In addition to the publications mentioned above, ORE produced Situation Reports 
(exhaustive studies of individual countries and areas) and a variety of branch-level pub-
lications (daily summaries, weekly summaries, monthly summaries, branch "esti-
mates," and reports of various types). (u)

or three times a week, telling a CIG interviewer that "most of the 
information in the Dailies is taken from State Department sources and 
is furnished the Secretary through State Department channels."26 Mar-
shall also stopped reading the Weekly after the first issue.27 The Secre-
tary of the Navy, James Forrestal, considered both Summaries "valuable 
but not...indispensable," according to one of his advisers.28 By contrast, 
an aide to Secretary of War Robert Patterson reported that the Secretary 
read both the Daily and Weekly Summaries "avidly and regularly."29(U) 
The analytical office's work came in for the most severe criticism 
in the so-called Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report of January 1949, which 
assessed both the performance of CIA and its role in the Intelligence 
Community.3" This report, commissioned by the National Security 
Council in early 1948, was prepared by a trio of prominent intelligence 
veterans who had left government service after the war: Allen Dulles, 
William Jackson, and Mathias Correa. (U) 
Their report candidly admitted that "There is confusion as to the 
proper role of the Central Intelligence Agency in the preparation of in-
telligence reports and estimates," and that "The principle of the author-
itative national intelligence estimate does not yet have established 
acceptance in the Government."31 They nevertheless took ORE to task 
for failing to perform better in the production of national intelligence, 
noting that although ORE had been given responsibility for production 
of national estimates, "It has.. .been concerned with a wide variety of 
activities and with the production of miscellaneous reports and summa-
ries which by no stretch of the imagination could be considered national 
estimates."-" (u) 
The trio found unacceptable ORE' s practice of drafting the esti-
mates "on the basis of its own research and analysis" and then circulat-
ing them among the other intelligence agencies to obtain notes of 
dissent or concurrence. 33 "Under this procedure, none of the agencies

mended that a "small group of specialists" be used "in lieu of the present 
Office of Reports and Estimates" to "review the intelligence products of 
other intelligence agencies and of the Central Intelligence Agency" and 
to "prepare drafts of national intelligence estimates for consideration by 
the Intelligence Advisory Committee." (U) 
The three also were not impressed with ORE's efforts in the field 
of current intelligence: "Approximately ninety per cent of the contents 
of the Daily Summary is derived from State Department sources.... 
There are occasional comments by the Central Intelligence Agency on 
portions of the Summary, but these, for the most part, appear gratuitous 
and lend little weight to the material itself."16 They concluded, "As both 
Summaries consume an inordinate amount of time and effort and appear 
to be outside of the domain of the Central Intelligence Agency, we be-
lieve that the Daily, and possibly the Weekly, Summary should be dis-
continued in their present form."" (U) 
The trio concluded disapprovingly that "the Central Intelligence 
Agency has tended to become just one more intelligence agency pro-
ducing intelligence in competition with older established agencies of 
the Government departments." (u) 
The Analysts (u) 
The Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report was extremely, perhaps un-
fairly, critical of ORE' s production record. Intelligence analysis is not 
an easy job in the best of times�the available information on any given 
analytical problem is invariably incomplete, or contradictory, or 
flawed in some other important way�and these clearly were not the 
best of times. Signals intelligence, which had proven devastatingly ef-
fective against the Axis powers in the war, was less effective against 
the security-conscious Soviets, and, as noted above, in any event could 
not yet be cited directly in CIA publications, even in those sent to the

President." 9 The sophisticated aircraft and satellites that would one day 
open the whole interior of the USSR to surveillance were not yet on the 
drawing board, and the intelligence collection arm of the new CIA was 
finding it impossibly difficult to penetrate Stalin's paranoid police state 
with agents. In the end, the analysts had little to rely on but diplomatic 
and military attache reporting, media accounts, and their own judg-
ment. (u) 
The paucity of hard intelligence about the Soviet Union placed a 
premium on the recruitment of topnotch analysts. Unfortunately, CIG 
and CIA had trouble landing the best and the brightest. CIG was in a 
particularly difficult situation; it had little authority to hire its own staff 
employees and thus depended on the Departments of State, War, and 
Navy for both its funding and personne1.40 Ludwell Montague com-
plained to DCI Vandenberg in September 1946 that these departments 
were not cooperating: "From the beginning the crucial problem... has 
been the procurement of key personnel qualified by aptitude and expe-
rience to anticipate intelligence needs, to exercise critical judgment re-
garding the material at hand, and to discern emergent trends. Such 
persons are rare indeed and hard to come by, [and] the recruitment of 
them is necessarily slow."4' Montague was particularly bitter about 
Army intelligence's (G-2) efforts to fob off on CIG what he termed 
"low-grade personnel."''' (u) 
The establishment of CIA in September 1947 ended the Office's 
dependence on other departments for personnel and funds. It permit-
ted the rapid expansion of ORE from 60 employees in June 1946 to 
" From unsecured Soviet communications, signals intelligence provided reliable infor-
mation on such things as foreign trade, consumer goods policies, gold production, pe-
troleum shipments, shipbuilding, aircraft production, and civil defense. A weekly all-
source publication that did contain COMINT, the Situation Summary, was created in 
July 1950 and sent to the White House. The Situation Summary's purpose was to warn, 
in the wake of the North Korean invasion of South Korea, of other potential acts of ag-
gression by Communist forces. See George S. Jackson and Martin P. Claussen, Orga-

problem, quality remained an issue. (U) 
Hanson W. Baldwin of The New York Times in 1948 noted that: 
personnel weaknesses undoubtedly are the clue to the history of 
frustration and disappointment, of friction and fiasco, which have 
been, too largely, the story of our intelligence services since the 
war. Present personnel, including many of those in the office of 
research and estimates [sic] of the Central Intelligence Agency, 
suffer from inexperience and inadequacy of background. Some of 
them do not possess the "global" objective mind needed to evalu-
ate intelligence, coldly, logically and definitively. 44 (U) 
A senior ORE officer, R. Jack Smith, shared Baldwin's view, 
noting that: 
We felt obliged to give the White House the best judgment we 
could command, and we continued to try as the years passed by. 
Eventually.. .the cumulative experience of this persistent effort, 
combined with the recruitment of some genuine specialists and 
scholars, produced a level of expertise that had no counterpart 
elsewhere in the government. But this was a decade or more 
away.45 (u) 
Ray Cline agreed with Smith's views. Cline wrote that "the expan-
sion under [DCI] Vandenberg made the agency a little bigger than be-
fore but not much better. It was filled largely with military men who did 
not want to leave the service at the end of the war but were not in great 
demand in the military services. The quality was mediocre."46 (U)

Of those with college expe-
rience, a surprising number majored in fields far removed from their 
work with CIG/CIA: civil engineering, agriculture, and library science, 
for example. Far from being stereotypical well-heeled graduates of the 
Ivy League, many had attended colleges that, at least in that period, 
were undistinguished. Although military experience was widespread, 
had served in the OSS.47 (U) 
To be fair, the analysts faced a number of impediments that made 
it difficult for their work to match expectations. The information at their 
disposal was, for the most part, shared by others in the policy and intel-
ligence communities. Moreover, the pace of the working day was hec-
tic, and the analysts were under constant pressure. The pressure came 
from outside�from government officials who demanded immediate 
support�and within, from individuals who realized that career ad-
vancement rested on quantity of production. Consequently, analysts had 
precious little time for reflection. In perhaps the best-known example, 
Ludwell Montague in July 1946 was given only three days in which to 
research, write, and coordinate with the other agencies ORE-1, "Soviet 
Foreign and Military Policy," the first estimate produced by CIG." (u) 
Nowhere was the pressure greater than in the production of the 
Daily Summaries. Each morning, at nine o'clock, couriers would arrive 
at CIA headquarters with the previous day's cable traffic from State and 
the Pentagon. Between nine and 10, an editor would read the cables, 
write comments on those he thought worthy of using in the Daily Sum-
mary, and sort them according to ORE' s branch organization. The ana-
lysts had on average only one hour, between 10 and 11, to draft their 
articles. Between 11 and noon, the articles were edited, and at noon, the 
branch chiefs, editors, and office leadership met to decide which articles 
should be published. "By one o'clock, the Daily was usually dittoed, as-
sembled, enclosed in blue folders, packaged, receipted for, and on its 
way by couriers to its approximately 15 official recipients."49 (u) 
Because there were few contacts between the analysts and editors 
on the one hand and senior policymakers on the other, choosing which 
stories to include in the Daily was a shot in the dark. As R. Jack Smith, 
then editor of the Daily recalled: 
The comic backdrop to this daily turmoil was that in actuality 
nobody knew what President Truman wanted to see or not see....

Reports and Estimates 
How were we supposed to judge, sitting in a rundown temporary 
building on the edge of the Potomac, what was fit for the Presi-
dent's eyes?" 
After gaining experience on the job, Smith decided that: 
Intelligence of immediate value to the president falls essentially 
into two categories: developments impinging directly on the secu-
rity of the United States; and developments bearing on major U.S. 
policy concerns. These cover possible military attacks, fluctua-
tions in relationships among potential adversaries, or anything 
likely to threaten or enhance the success of major U.S. policy pro-
grams worldwide." (u) 
The combination of uncertainty over what the President needed to 
see and the analysts' need to publish as much as possible brought edi-
tors, analysts, and branch chiefs into frequent conflict. The analysts and 
their branch chiefs believed that they, as the substantive experts, should 
have the final say on the content of the Summaries, while the editors felt 
that the experts were too parochial in outlook to make such decisions." 
Neither side held command authority, so the disputes had to be settled 
through argument and compromise. The most intractable cases would 
be bucked up to the office leadership to decide. This situation remained 
a source of tension within the office throughout ORE' s existence. (U) 
The Threat of War in Europe... (u) 
From the beginning, the current intelligence sent to the White 
House contained numerous alarming reports about Soviet behavior 
from nearly all corners of the globe: the Middle East, Eastern Europe, 
Western Europe, and Korea in particular. A policymaker reading the 
Summaries, or the original reports on which the Summaries were based, 
could easily have concluded that Soviet military aggression was an im-
minent possibility. (U) 
The most consistent�and perhaps most important�theme of 
CIG/CIA analysis during this period, however, was that Soviet moves, 
no matter how menacing they might appear in isolation, were unlikely 
to lead to an attack against the West. This judgment looks even bolder

in light of President Truman's evident intention that ORE was to warn 
the US Government of another Pearl Harbor�that is, a sudden surprise 
attack on American forces or allies. Denied the ability to make com-
ments in the Summaries for most of 1946, CIG' s first opportunity to put 
these reports into perspective was ORE-1, "Soviet Foreign and Military 
Policy," published on 23 July 1946. It noted that although "the Soviet 
Government anticipates an inevitable conflict with the capitalist world," 
Moscow "needs to avoid such a conflict for an indefinite period."52 (U) 
Similarly, a Special Study published a month later and sent to the 
President noted that "during the past two weeks there has been a series 
of developments which suggest that some consideration should be given 
to the possibility of near-term Soviet military action."" The authors 
judged, however, that: 
The most plausible conclusion would appear to be that, until there 
is some specific evidence that the Soviets are making the neces-
sary military preparations and dispositions for offensive opera-
tions, the recent disturbing developments can be interpreted as 
constituting no more than an intensive war of nerves. The purpose 
may be to test US determination to support its objectives at the 
[Paris] peace conference and to sustain its commitments in Euro-
pean affairs." (t) 
Subsequent crises did not shake this assessment. During the 
March 1948 "war scare," touched off when Gen. Lucius Clay, the US 
military governor in Germany, sent a message to the Pentagon warn-
ing of the likelihood of a sudden Soviet attack, CIA analysts bluntly

struction of two US aircraft, and a vicious Soviet propaganda campaign and internal 
crackdown (the Zhdanovshchina) against Western influences. On the Zhdanovshchina,

rejected the notion.55 During the scare, the State Department reported, 
in separate cables, that senior members of the Czechoslovak and Turk-
ish Governments also feared the Soviet Union was prepared to risk an 
imminent attack. In comments on these reports made in the Daily 
Summary on 16 March 1948, analysts said "CIA does not believe that 
the USSR is presently prepared to risk war in the pursuit of its aims in 
Europe." On the following day, they added that "CIA does not believe 
that the USSR plans a military venture in the immediate future in ei-
ther Europe or the Middle East."56 (U) 
During the Berlin blockade, CIA's position remained the same. 
"The Soviet action.. .has two possible objectives: either to force the 
western powers to negotiate on Soviet terms regarding Germany, or 
failing that, to force a western power withdrawal from Berlin. The 
USSR does not seem ready to force a definite showdown."57 The ex-
plosion of the Soviet Union's first atomic bomb, on 29 August 1949, 
similarly failed to change the analysts' judgment: "No immediate 
change in Soviet policy or tactics is expected" was the verdict in the 
Weekly Summary.58 (U) 
...and in the Far East (u) 
ORE initially deemed the possibility of aggression by the Soviet 
client regime in North Korea as more likely. 
An armed invasion of South Korea by the North Korean Peoples' 
Army is not likely until US troops have been withdrawn from the 
area or before the Communists have attempted to "unify" Korea 
by some sort of coup. Eventual armed conflict between the North 
and South Korean governments appears probable, however, in the 
light of such recent events as Soviet withdrawal from North 
Korea, intensified improvement of North Korean roads leading 
south, Peoples' Army troop movements to areas nearer the 38th 
parallel and from Manchuria to North Korea, and combined 
maneuvers." (0) 
" Clay's message, sent on 5 March 1948, stated that "For many months... I have felt

felt a subtle change in Soviet attitude which I cannot define but which now gives me a 
feeling that it may come with dramatic suddenness." Quoted in Frank Kofsky, Harry S.

ORE earlier had predicted that Soviet withdrawal from North Korea 
would be followed by "renewed pressure for the withdrawal of all occu-
pation forces. The Soviet aim will be to deprive the United States of an 
opportunity to establish a native security force in South Korea adequate 
to deal with aggression from the North Korean People's Army.''60 (t) 
Unfortunately for ORE and the policymakers who read its analy-
sis, this line was revised in early 1950. "The continuing southward 
movement of the expanding Korean People's Army toward the thirty-
eighth parallel probably constitutes a defensive measure to offset the 
growing strength of the offensively minded South Korean Army," read 
the Weekly Summary of 13 January. ORE further stated that "an inva-
sion of South Korea is unlikely unless North Korean forces can develop 
a clear-cut superiority over the increasingly efficient South Korean Ar-
my."6' Although this assessment appears naive in retrospect, it actually 
fit in well with the views held by senior American military officers, who 
believed the South Korean Army was sufficiently strong and no longer 
required US military aid. South Korean strongman Syngman Rhee, 
moreover, had begun making noises to American officials about reuni-
fying Korea under his control; the possibility of South Korean provoca-
tion thus was not as remote at the time as it seems now.62 (u) 
The day after the North Korean attack on 25 June 1950, the Daily 
Summary counseled that "successful aggression in Korea will encour-
age the USSR to launch similar ventures elsewhere in the Far East. In 
sponsoring the aggression in Korea, the Kremlin probably calculated 
that no firm or effective countermeasures would be taken by the West. 
However, the Kremlin is not willing to undertake a global war at this 
time."63 (U) 
After initially suggesting that "firm and effective countermeasures 
by the West would probably lead the Kremlin to permit a settlement to 
be negotiated between the North and South Koreans," the analysts with-
in days concluded that "It is probable.. .that a concerted attempt will be

made to make the US effort in Korea as difficult and costly as possi-
ble." 64 A week later, the analysts amplified this theme: 
All evidence available leads to the conclusion that the USSR is 
not ready for war. Nevertheless, the USSR has substantial capabil-
ities, without directly involving Soviet troops, for prolonging the 
fighting in Korea, as well as for initiating hostilities elsewhere. 
Thus, although the USSR would prefer to confine the conflict to 
Korea, a reversal there might impel the USSR to take greater risks 
of starting a global war either by committing substantial Chinese 
Communist forces in Korea or by sanctioning aggressive actions 
by Satellite forces in other areas of the world. 6' (u) 
ORE analysts quickly concluded, however, that Chinese interven-
tion was not likely. They reasoned that, although a North Korean defeat 
would "have obvious disadvantages" for the Soviet Union, "the com-
mitment of Chinese Communist forces would not necessarily prevent 
such a defeat and a defeat under these circumstances would be far more 
disastrous, not only because it would be a greater blow to Soviet pres-
tige throughout the world, but because it would seriously threaten Sovi-
et control over the Chinese Communist regime." Moreover, if the 
Chinese were to emerge victorious, "the presence of Chinese Commu-
nist troops in Korea would complicate if not jeopardize Soviet direction 
of Korean affairs; Chinese Communist prestige, as opposed to that of 
the USSR, would be enhanced; and Peiping might be tempted as a result 
of success in Korea to challenge Soviet leadership in Asia." Finally, the 
analysts believed that Chinese intervention was unlikely because "the 
use of Chinese Communist forces in Korea would increase the risk of 
global war, not only because of possible UN or US reaction but because 
the USSR itself would be under greater compulsion to assure a victory 
in Korea, possibly by committing Soviet troops."66 (u)

The Weekly Summary of 15 September 1950 briefly described the 
evidence that suggested Chinese intervention was likely but still con-
cluded that Beijing would not risk war with the United States: 
Numerous reports of Chinese Communist troop movements in 
Manchuria, coupled with Peiping's recent charges of US aggres-
sion and violations of Chinese territory, have increased specula-
tion concerning both Chinese Communist intervention in Korea 
and disagreement between the USSR and China on matters of mil-
itary policy. It is being argued that victory in Korea can only be 
achieved by using Chinese Communist (or Soviet) forces, that the 
USSR desires to weaken the US by involving it in a protracted 
struggle with China, and that the Chinese Communists are blam-
ing the USSR for initiating the Korean venture and thus postpon-
ing the invasion of Taiwan. Despite the apparent logic of this 
reasoning, there is no evidence indicating a Chinese-Soviet dis-
agreement, and cogent political and military considerations make 
it unlikely that Chinese Communist forces will be directly and 
openly committed in Korea.� (u) 
The first Chinese warnings of intervention in the war if UN forces 
crossed the 38th parallel were published in the Daily Summary on 30 
September without comment, perhaps because they were downplayed 
by the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, to whom others in the Mos-
cow diplomatic corps had passed the warnings." On 3 October, the an-
alysts drew on a similar report from the US Embassy in London to state 
that "CIA estimates... that the Chinese Communists would not consider 
it in their interests to intervene openly in Korea if, as now seems likely, 
they anticipate that war with the UN nations [sic] would result." 69 In the 
same article, the analysts warned, as they had before and would again, 
that "The Chinese Communists have long had the capability for military 
intervention in Korea on a scale sufficient to materially affect the course 
of events." Nevertheless, in eight subsequent Daily Summaries, CIA 
analysts restated their belief that China would, first, not intervene, and 
then�as the intervention got under way�that it would not develop into 
a large scale attack. The last Summary containing this judgment came

The Danger of Subversion in Europe (u) 
Throughout this period, ORE analysts were far more concerned 
about Soviet use of local Communist parties to subvert pro-Western 
governments than they were about the possibility of armed aggression 
by the USSR or one of its Communist allies. As ORE expressed it in 
September 1947, "The USSR is unlikely to resort to open military ag-
gression in present circumstances. Its policy is to avoid war, to build up 
its war potential, and to extend its influence and control by political, 
economic, and psychological methods."" (U) 
CIG had reached a very similar conclusion about the first serious 
postwar confrontation with the Soviet Union�its refusal to withdraw 
its forces from northern Iran and its subsequent support for the break-
away Iranian provinces of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan.'" After the worst 
of the Iran crisis had passed, the first Weekly Summary warned that the 
Soviets, having recognized that their policy toward Iran was "heavy-
handed and over-hasty" would rely on "gradual penetration." It de-
clared that "the Soviets clearly feel that 'time is on their side' in Iran and 
that the general economic backwardness of the country and the unpop-
ular labor policy of the British oil companies will forward their cause."74 
"Their cause" was identified as "gaining control over Iranian oil and 
blocking closer military ties between Iran and the West."75 (u) 
ORE tracked the gradual but inexorable consolidation of Commu-
nist power across Eastern Europe, as brought about through a combina-
tion of political manipulation by local Communists and pressure from 
the Soviet occupation forces. The political and economic undermining 
of the prospects for democracy in Eastern Europe reinforced the ana-
lysts' conclusion that this type of subversion was the greatest danger 
from the Soviet Union. The analysts observed that Moscow's objective

In December 1945, Iranian rebels under the protection of Soviet forces proclaimed an

ment of Iran protested this Soviet interference in its internal affairs before the UN Se-

in the region was to "establish permanent safeguards for their strategic, 
political, and economic interests, including ..stable and subservient, or 
at least friendly, regime[s]."76 (u) 
The analysts were most troubled by the consolidation of Commu-
nist power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, judging that it would 
diminish: 
the possibility of a compromise in Europe between the ideologies 
of the Kremlin and the principles of western democracy and indi-
vidual freedom. Such a compromise had apparently been achieved 
in Czechoslovakia.... The coup...reflects the refusal of the Com-
munists to settle for anything less than complete control and their 
conviction that such dominance could never have been achieved 
under a freely operating parliamentary form of government." (u) 
On Germany, ORE anticipated that Stalin would use subversive 
tactics to try to create a unified German state from the occupied ruins of 
the Third Reich: "A German administration strongly centralized in Ber-
lin will be much more susceptible than a loose federation to Soviet pres-
sures.... Posing thus as the champions of German nationalism and 
rehabilitation, the Soviets can attempt to discredit the policy of the 
western powers and to facilitate the Communist penetration of their 
zones."" The analysts warned that the removal of zonal barriers would 
place the Soviets in a "position to launch a vigorous campaign to com-
munize the Western zone." (u) 
After the Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) conference in Mos-
cow in the spring of 1947 failed to reach agreement on Germany's fu-
ture, ORE analysts advised that the Soviets may be trying to (1) 
"prolong the unsettled conditions in Europe conducive to Communism; 
and (2) to encourage the US to expend its patience and energy in a vain 
quest for agreement until forced by its internal economic and political 
conditions to curtail its foreign commitments and to leave Europe to the 
USSR by default."'" (u)

ORE noted that Soviet efforts to penetrate the Western zones of 
Germany focused on attempts to "extend the SED [Socialist Unity Par-
ty, the Communist's stalking horse in the Eastern zone] political struc-
ture to the West, while, simultaneously, efforts are made to establish 
Communist front organizations, such as the Freie Deutsche Jugend 
(FDJ), and to penetrate Western Zone labor unions."81 ORE warned that 
if "Soviet efforts at the [November 1947] CFM fail to achieve a united 
Germany on Soviet terms, the USSR will attempt to blame the Western 
Powers for failure of the conference. At the same time, the Kremlin may 
announce the recognition of a 'German Republic' east of the Elbe and 
attempt to secure the removal of the Western allies from Berlin."" (U) 
Once the first signs of the Berlin blockade emerged in April 1948, 
ORE analysts advised that Stalin wanted "a negotiated settlement.. .on 
terms which would permit ultimate Soviet control of Berlin and Com-
munist penetration of Western Germany."" After the blockade was lift-
ed in the spring of 1949, CIA assessed that Soviet objectives in 
Germany remained unchanged: "Soviet agreement to lift the Berlin 
blockade and enter into four-power discussions on Germany does not 
represent any change in the Soviet objective to establish a Germany 
which will eventually fall under Soviet domination."84 (U) 
The analysts also highlighted the Communist threat in France and 
Italy. Both countries had emerged from the war with widespread devas-
tation and strong Communist parties sharing power in coalition govern-
ments. After the French and Italian prime ministers expelled the 
Communist ministers from their governments in the spring of 1947, 
ORE predicted that: 
The Kremlin apparently proposes for countries such as France and 
Italy: (1) intensive agitation against their present governments and 
against non-Communist liberals; and (2) the development of 
highly-disciplined Communist cores which, at the proper 
moment, could assume control. Such a program is well-adapted to 
the current situation in France where, [now] relieved of govern-
mental responsibility, the Communists are in a position to threaten 
(by propaganda, subversion, and trade-union agitation) the stabil-
ity of the present Government. Where Communism is less power-
ful, the Kremlin desires to concentrate on gaining control of trade 
unions and other liberal organizations." (u)

ORE warned in September 1947 that "the sudden overthrow of the 
De Gasperi Government [in Italy] by Communist-sponsored armed 
force, following [the December 1947] withdrawal of Allied troops," 
was "within the realm of possibility" because of the Italian Army's 
weakness. But the analysts thought that outcome was unlikely. They 
wrote that "the USSR is unwilling to support directly such a step be-
cause it might involve war with the US" and because the potential fail-
ure of the much-anticipated European Recovery Program (better known 
today as the Marshall Plan) could deliver Italy into the hands of the 
Communists in the April 1948 elections. ORE worried more that a 
Communist-inspired general strike could paralyze the important north-
ern Italian industrial area; such an event could "defeat the operation of 
the European recovery program and eventually throw not only Italy into 
the Soviet orbit, but possibly France as well."86 (u) 
A Special Evaluation published on 13 October 1947 concluded 
that Moscow's establishment of the Communist Information Bureau in 
September 1947: 
suggests strongly that the USSR recognizes that it has reached a 
point of diminishing returns in the attempts of the Communist 
parties of Western Europe to rise to power through parliamentary 
means and that, consequently, it intends to revert to subversive 
activities, such as strikes and sabotage, in an effort to undermine 
the stability of Western European governments. This move like-
wise tends to substantiate the contention that the USSR considers 
international subversive and revolutionary action, rather than mili-
tary aggression, as the primary instrument for obtaining its world-
wide objectives." (U) 
ORE concluded that, "In its efforts to sabotage the European re-
covery program, which is the USSR's immediate and primary target, 
the Kremlin will be willing even to risk the sacrifice of the French and 
Italian Communist Parties" by ordering them to use sabotage and vio-
lence against the Marshall Plan. "If these Parties are defeated and driven 
underground, the USSR will have lost no more than it would lose by the 
success of the European recovery program. CIA believes that the unex-
pectedly rapid progress of the [proposed] Marshall program has upset

the timetable of the Kremlin and forced this desperate action as the last 
available countermeasures." (u) 
The unexpectedly severe defeat of the Italian Communists in the 
April 1948 national election considerably eased the concerns of ORE' s 
analysts. Noting that the election results had "vastly improved the mo-
rale and confidence of the anti-Communists in both Italy and France," 
the analysts predicted that "for the immediate future, Communist activ-
ities in western Europe are likely to be directed toward rebuilding the 
popular front rather than an early or determined bid for power." Never-
theless, "the Communists are not expected to relax their efforts to pre-
vent recovery in Europe.... Strikes and industrial sabotage...therefore 
can be expected." (u) 
The civil war in Greece, which had begun in 1946, received rela-
tively little attention in the current intelligence publications until the 
British Government announced in early 1947 that it would have to with-
draw its forces from the country and significantly reduce its assistance 
to Greece's non-Communist government. The Weekly Summary of 28 
February, published seven days after the British announcement, sum-
marized the dire situation facing Greece: 
Alone, Greece cannot save itself. Militarily, the country needs aid 
in the form of equipment and training. Politically, Greece's 
diehard politicians need to be convinced of the necessity of a 
housecleaning, and the prostrate Center.. requires bolstering. 
Economically, it needs gifts or loans of commodities, food, for-
eign exchange, and gold to check inflation. Of these needs, the 
economic are the most vital.... Without immediate economic 
aid.. .there would appear to be imminent danger that the Soviet-
dominated Left will seize control of the country, which would 
result in the loss of Greece as a democracy." (u) 
ORE analysts believed the chain of command for the Communist 
forces in Greece started in Moscow and ran through Yugoslav leader 
Josip Broz-Tito to Bulgaria and Albania before reaching the Greek

Communists." Nevertheless, they rejected the possibility that armies of 
those countries would assist the Greek guerrillas, despite numerous ru-
mors to the contrary: 
CIG considers direct participation by the Albanian, Yugoslav, and 
Bulgarian armies unlikely. Such action would obviously have far-
reaching international repercussions and might even involve the 
USSR in a world war for which it is unprepared. The likelihood of 
direct participation by Soviet troops in Greece or Turkey at this 
time is so remote that it need not seriously be considered." (u) 
In July 1948, ORE advised the President that Tito's rift with 
Stalin, which appeared in March, would considerably lessen the pres-
sure against Greece." it soon followed with a report of slackening Bul-
garian support for the guerrillas, although ORE was unable to specify 
the cause of the change." (0) 
The Threat From Revolution in the Far East (U) 
In their coverage of the Chinese civil war in the late 1940s, ORE 
analysts noted that "the Soviet Union has scrupulously avoided identi-
fying the Chinese Communist Party with Moscow, and it is highly im-
probable that the Soviet leaders would at this time jeopardize the 
Chinese Communist Party by acknowledging its connection with the 
world Communist movement."'" They later affirmed that the USSR had 
"given renewed indications that it is not ready to abandon its 'correct' 
attitude toward the Nanking Government in favor of open aid to the 
Communists in China's civil war."9" Moreover, "Because of the intense-
ly nationalistic spirit of the Chinese people.. .the [Chinese] Communists 
are most anxious to protect themselves from the charge of Soviet dom-
inance."97 (0) 
Not until the end of 1948 did ORE analysts begin to worry about 
what a Communist victory in China might mean for the global balance 
of power: "A tremendously increased Soviet war potential in the Far

East may result eventually from Communist control of Manchuria and 
north China."98 At the same time, the analysts began warning that "Re-
cent statements from authoritative Chinese Communist sources empha-
size the strong ideological affinity existing between the USSR and the 
Chinese Communist party...and indicate that Soviet leadership, espe-
cially in foreign affairs, will probably be faithfully followed by any 
Communist-dominated government in China."99 (U) 
After the Communists' final victory over Chiang Kai-shek's 
Nationalist regime in the autumn of 1949, the analysts doubted that 
Mao's protracted stay in Moscow, which began in December 1949 and 
lasted for nine weeks, was a sign of potential trouble in the alliance: 
"Although the length of Mao's visit may be the result of difficulties in 
reaching agreement on a revised Sino-Soviet treaty... it is unlikely that 
Mao is proving dangerously intractable. Mao is a genuine and orthodox 
Stalinist, [and] is in firm control of the Chinese Communist Party."10� 
The analysts believed that "The USSR can be expected to gradually 
strengthen its grip on the Chinese Communist Party apparatus, on the 
armed forces, on the secret police, and on communications and informa-
tional media."1�1 (U) 
ORE initially devoted little attention to the French struggle in In-
dochina against the Viet Minh independence movement led by Ho Chi 
Minh�in fact, the office devoted much more coverage to the problems 
the Dutch were having in their colony in Indonesia. Although most of 
ORE' s information came from French officials, the analysts were skep-
tical that Paris would be able to put down the rebellion.'�' They conclud-
ed that "Any Vietnam government which does not include Ho Chi Minh 
or his more moderate followers will...be limited in scope of authority 
by the perimeters of French military control and will be open to wide-
spread popular opposition and sabotage."�3 (U) 
Ho was not at first portrayed by ORE as either a Communist or 
a Soviet ally. The analysts referred to him as "President Ho."�4 The 
first mention of a tie to Moscow, made in May 1948, was a grudging 
one: "Ho Chi Minh.. .is supported by 80% of the population and.. .is 
allegedly loyal to Soviet foreign policy."105 As late as September 1949,

analysts wrote that "Ho's relationship with the Kremlin and the Chi-
nese Communists remains obscure....Ho has stated his willingness to 
accept military equipment from the Chinese Communists. On the oth-
er hand, Ho still maintains that neutrality between the US and the 
USSR is both possible and desirable." " (u) 
Moscow's recognition of Ho's government on 31 January 1950 
prompted the analysts to change their stance dramatically, however." 
They saw the likelihood of a series of regional governments falling in 
turn under Soviet influence: 
If France is driven from Indochina, the resulting emergence of an 
indigenous Communist-dominated regime in Vietnam, together 
with pressures exerted by Peiping and Moscow, would probably 
bring about the orientation of adjacent Thailand and Burma 
toward the Communist orbit. Under these circumstances, other 
Asian states Malaya and Indonesia, particularly�would 
become highly vulnerable to the extension of Communist influ-
ence.... Meanwhile, by recognizing the Ho regime, the USSR has 
revealed its determination to force France completely out of 
Indochina and to install a Communist government. Alone, France 
is incapable of preventing such a development."' (u) 
The analysts concluded that, although only the United States could 
help France avoid defeat, the "Asian nations... would tend to interpret 
such US action as support of continued Western colonialism."" (u) 
Soviet Aims in Israel (u) 
Like many in the State Department and elsewhere in the US Gov-
ernment, ORE, worried by reports that the Soviets were funneling arms 
and money to Zionist guerrillas, suggested that the creation of Israel 
could give the USSR a client state in the Middle East."� 
Formation of a Jewish state in Palestine will enable the USSR to 
intensify its efforts to expand Soviet influence in the Near East 
and to perpetuate a chaotic condition there.... In any event, the

flow of men and munitions to Palestine from the Soviet bloc can 
be expected to increase substantially. The USSR will undoubtedly 
take advantage of the removal of immigration restrictions to 
increase the influx of trained Soviet agents from eastern and cen-
tral Europe into Palestine where they have already had consider-
able success penetrating the Stern Gang, Irgun, and, to a lesser 
extent, Haganah.'" (u) 
Not until November 1948, five months after Israel declared its in-
dependence and defeated a coalition of Arab opponents, did ORE sug-
gest that events might turn out otherwise: "There is some evidence that 
Soviet.. enthusiasm for the support of Israel is diminishing." "2 ORE 
later suggested that the change in attitude stemmed from a Soviet esti-
mate "that the establishment of Israel as a disruptive force in the Arab 
world has now been accomplished and that further military aid to a 
country of basically pro-western sympathies would ultimately prove 
prejudicial to Soviet interests in the Near East."3 (U) 
Conclusion (u) 
ORE met its end shortly after Lt. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith and 
William H. Jackson, of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa survey team, arrived 
in late 1950 as Director of Central Intelligence and Deputy Director, re-
spectively. They abolished ORE that November and replaced it with 
three new units: the Office of National Estimates, the Office of Re-
search and Reports, and the Office of Current Intelligence. These steps 
finally ended the confusion over the analytical mission, primarily by 
splitting the competing functions of national, current, and basic intelli-
gence into three offices. (u) 
Much maligned by insiders and outsiders alike, ORE' s record is 
perhaps not as bad as its reputation. Its analysis holds up well when 
compared to both the views held by other agencies at the time and our 
current understanding of events in that period. Of course, ORE, like all 
intelligence organizations in all eras, had its failures. Dramatic, sweep-
ing events, such as wars and revolutions, are far too complex to predict 
or analyze perfectly. Even with the benefit of unprecedented access to 
Russian and Chinese sources, for example, contemporary historians are

unable to conclusively pinpoint when and why Mao decided to inter-
vene in the Korean War. "4 (u) 
Gaps also exist in our knowledge about what intelligence Presi-
dent Truman saw, understood, believed, and used. Judging the impact 
of intelligence on policy is difficult always, and especially so from a 
distance of fifty years. On many issues, such as the Communist threat 
to Italy, ORE's work tended to reinforce what many policymakers in the 
Administration and officials in the field already believed. (u) 
It does seem fair to conclude, however, that ORE' s repeated, cor-
rect assurances that a Soviet attack in Europe was unlikely must have 
had a steadying influence when tensions were high and some feared a 
Soviet onslaught. In this, the analysts of ORE served President Truman 
well, and their accurate assessment ultimately must be considered 
ORE' s most important contribution in those early, fearful years of the 
Cold War. (u)

The First Star: 
Douglas Mackiernan in China and Tibet (C) 
Nicholas Dujmovic 
"Don't shoot," called Douglas Mackiernan, American vice consul. 
Moments later, he was dead, killed in a fusillade of bullets fired by ner-
vous guards on the border between China and then independent Tibet. 
It was April, 1950. Mackiernan received posthumous honors from the 
Secretary of State, and his name would grace the State Department's 
memorial to fallen Foreign Service officers. (U) 
Forty seven years later and half a world away, Acting Director of 
Central Intelligence George J. Tenet stood in front of CIA's Memorial 
Wall, with its seventy stars. He spoke before a large audience that had 
packed the lobby of CIA's Original Headquarters Building for the an-
nual Memorial Ceremony. To the hushed crowd, which included Mac-
kiernan's widow, Acting Director Tenet acknowledged Mackiernan as 
the first CIA officer to die in the line of duty: "He is the first star on that 
Wall, and the space in the book where his name should be is blank... 
but we claim Doug Mackiernan as one of our own.. .now, in a sense, 
we've brought him home." (s) 
The story of Douglas (Mack) Mackiernan is the story of a brave 
and resourceful officer working for his country in a desolate, isolated 
foreign land undergoing a Communist revolution. It demonstrates the 
continuity of US foreign intelligence from the War Department's 
Strategic Services Unit, through the Central Intelligence Group, to the 
' The earliest account of Mackiernan's death was told by the American who survived 
the attack, Frank Bessac, "This Was the Perilous Trek to Tragedy," Life, 13 November 
1950. Other well known sources include Heinrich Harrer, Seven Years in Tibet (Lon-
don: Hart-Davis, 1953), pp 237-38; Godfrey Lias, Kazak Exodus (London: Evans, 
1956), pp. 170-72; and Fred Donner, "Overland from China," Foreign Service Journal, 
April 1985, pp. 38-41. All these accounts preserved cover for both Mackiernan and 
Bessac. Last year, however, a Tibet scholar published a history that exposes their CIA 
affiliation; see Warren W. Smith, Jr., The Tibetan Nation (Boulder: Westview, 1996), 
pp. 278-79. More recently, Mackiernan's widow cooperated with a Washington Post re-
porter: Ted Gup's article, "Star Agents: Covert Lives and Covert Deaths at the CIA" 
(The Washington Post Magazine, 7 September 1997), is replete with errors but tells the 
main part of Mackiernan's story all too correctly that he was a CIA officer operating 
under cover in far western China from 1947 through 1949. (u)

Central Intelligence Agency. It shows an early friction between the 
practice of intelligence and the world of diplomacy. It illuminates the 
fears held by US officials during the initial stages of the Cold War. 
Above all, it reminds us of the peculiar kind of secrecy demanded by in-
telligence, which insists that the heroic mission of Doug Mackiernan, 
who died in the service of this country far from home, should remain in 
a shroud of secrecy even after five decades. (s) 
An Extremely Capable Operative (u) 
Douglas Mackiernan was born in 1913, attended high school in 
Stoughton, Massachusetts and studied physics at the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology. He was an expert in both radio and meteorology; 
he was fluent in Spanish and had proficiency in French, German, and 
Russian. In April 1942, Mackiernan became a US Army meteorologist, 
which allowed him to serve his country while indulging his love of trav-
el. He deployed to Greenland, Alaska, and then China. Mackiernan 
spent almost two and a half years with the US Army's 10th Weather 
Squadron in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang province in far western China, 
on the Soviet border.2 In the spring of 1946, Mackiernan headed home 
for his discharge from the Army.' (0) 
But Mackiernan wanted to return to Urumqi. He found the Xin-
jiang province�with its extremes of desert and mountain, its volatile 
ethnic mix, and its frontier character�fascinating. The War Depart-
ment's Strategic Services Unit (SSU�which housed remnants of the 
OSS) expressed an interest in Mackiernan' s talents and knowledge.4 
SSU was particularly interested in Xinjiang province because it was 
widely believed that local uprisings against Nationalist Chinese author-
ity in the Sino-Soviet border region were instigated by Moscow.' Soviet 
influence and inroads were believed to stem in part from a desire to con-
trol important mineral deposits of the region�especially uranium. It 
Names and spellings are problematic for this region. For this article I use the current 
Chinese "pinyin" usage for Urumqi and Xinjiang, rather than the older forms Urumchi 
and Sinkiang. Complicating matters is the fact that Mackiernan and his contemporaries 
called Urumqi, the ancient Uighur name for the provincial capital, by its Chinese name, 
Tihwa or Tihua. DO records reflect all these usages and more. (u) 
See Linda Benson, The Ili Rebellion: The Moslem Challenge to Chinese Authority in 
Xinjiang, 1944-1949 (London: Sharpe, 1990), passim. (u)

also made sense for Moscow to keep tabs on the nationalist and inde-
pendence movements of Xinjiang, as these could affect minorities in 
neighboring Soviet Central Asia. All this was speculation; what was 
known for sure was that the Soviets had five consulates in the province. 
What American intelligence needed was an astute observer on the 
ground, and Mackiernan seemed ideal. (s) 
SSU officers interviewed Mackiernan in China and judged him a 
trainable intelligence officer ideally suited to operations in Xinjiang. Be-
sides his knowledge of radio, he knew a lot about photography. He already 
spoke Russian, and be was also studying Chinese and Mongolian.' (S) 
On his arrival in Washington, SSU made an employment offer, 
and

Expectations regarding Mackiernan were high 
Indeed, the highest intelligence priority concerned 
Soviet activities and influence in Xinjiang, especially intelligence relat-
ed to Soviet efforts to construct an atomic bomb. Mackiernan was di-
rected to discover where the Soviets might find uranium in the province, 
whether they were mining it, and whether any "atomic recearrh" w2C

Urumqi that would monitor signs of a Soviet nuclear explosion. The Air

The Air Force, for its part, made it known that it wanted Mackier-
nan to continue monitoring for signs of a Soviet atomic test. In response 
to a query from Headquarters, Mackiernan cabled on 11 August that his 
Air Force equipment was in operation and that his instructions were to 
make a report only for an "unusual event of which none so far."36 (s) 
On the morning of 16 August, Consul General Paxton, his wife, 
and several Consulate employees left Urumqi on an arduous journey 
that would take them west across Xinjiang and into India by late Octo-
ber; Paxton would make it back to the United States in mid-November." 
As Vice Consul and the only American presence left in Urumqi, Mac-
kiernan proceeded to destroy the Consulate's files and turn US property 
over to the British Consulate Genera1.38 (S) 
The doors to Mackiernan's future began to shut. On 25 August, he 
cabled to Headquarters that the western route to India had been closed 
by the provincial government. On 3 September, Mackiernan reported 
that Nationalist Chinese forces were beginning to evacuate Urumqi, and 
the city was in a panic." CIA cabled back, saying that under no circum-
stances should Mackiernan remain in Urumqi if a Communist takeover 
was imminent.40 Mackiernan then heard that the main mountain passes 
from western Xinjiang into both India and Afghanistan had been sealed. 
For a possible return to Urumqi, Mackiernan spent many of his remain-

gold reserves (b)(1)

Amidst this activity, CIA sent Mackiernan the 
following cable: "Report priority all info and rumors on atomic explo-

1949. Handle with greatest discretion." (S) 
The Soviet Union, of course, had exploded its first atomic device 
in neighboring Kazakhstan, about 650 miles to the north west of Urum-
qi, on 29 August. For reasons unknown, the Air Force equipment had 
not registered anything unusual. It is likely that Mackiernan' s equip-
ment�which the Air Force had intended primarily for baseline 
barographic, seismic, and radiological readings for the region and 
which was supposed to be replaced with more sophisticated equip-
ment�was not sufficiently sensitive to detect the changes produced by 
the Soviet explosion. Through no fault of his own, Mackiernan had 
missed his chance to become part of the history of the nuclear arms race. 
On 15 September he ceased monitoring and destroyed the equipment.42

On the morning of 29 April 1950, at a place in northern Tibet

quickly retreated to a small rock shelter, ready to fire. Anxious to dem-

Mackiernan ordered the party to pitch camp in the open near a small

Communists. What is less clear is whether this delay mattered in 
Mackiernan's death. In Lhasa, the Tibetan Government told 
that all Tibetan outposts received the message about the party by mid-
April all except the outpost at Shigarhung Lung, due to the failure of 
one messenger to pass the information.64 (s) 
A greater factor in the tragedy was probably Mackiernan's own 
misjudgment. Believing himself to be farther north than he actually 
was, he may have been less cautious about the endemic violence in the 
region about which Headquarters had warned him.65 Mackiernan was 
perhaps a victim of his own naivete about Tibetans, who are often 
viewed romantically by Westerners as peaceful and gentle, but who can 
be as brutal and capricious as any other people. Mackiernan, knowing 
he could shoot his way out of a difficult situation, gambled on a peaceful 
approach and lost. In the end, it was an accident, a tragic happenstance 
that took the life of the first CIA officer to die in the line of duty. (s) 
The bodies of Mackiernan and his companions were 
buried at Shigarhung Lung by a contrite Tibetan Government, horrified 
at the tragedy.   three crosses that were built in Lhasa 
and sent back to stand over their graves. A photograph of the site was 
supposed to be taken and provided to the US Embassy at New Delhi, but 
there is no record that this happened. Douglas Mackiernan's grave, for 
all we know, is unmarked as well as forgotten. (s) 
The question asks itself: could his remains be found? If so, does 
the Agency owe Doug Mackiernan the effort to locate his grave and 
bring his remains back to the United States? The US Government 
mounts extraordinary efforts to find and return the remains of US sol-
diers, sailors and airmen who are lost in the most distant lands. Though 
it would be difficult logistically, not to mention politically, to succeed 
in bringing Doug Mackiernan back home to the country he served so 
faithfully, the effort would seem appropriate for all he gave. (s)

CIA and TPAJAX: The Tension Between 
Analysis and Operations (S) 
Scott A. Koch 
In the summer of 1953, the US Government saw what it thought 
were unmistakable signs that Iran was about to fall behind the Iron Cur-
tain. Prime Minister Dr. Mohammed Mossadeq had broken off negoti-
ations with Britain concerning compensation for the assets of the 
Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), which Iran nationalized in 1951. 
Mossadeq, having ridden to power on a wave of nationalism, exploited 
the anti-British sentiment of the population and made political and 
diplomatic overtures to the Soviet Union. To Washington's alarm, he 
considered taking members of the Tudeh (Iranian Communist Party) 
into his Eovernment (u)  
Washington's view changed when Dwight Eisenhower took 
the Presidential oath of office in January 1953. Secretary of State John 
Foster Dulles did not think Mossadeq was a guarantor of political sta-
bility, and events bore him out. Mossadeq's popular political support 
was almost gone by the summer of 1953. His allies in the Iranian Par-
liament (the Majlis) had deserted him to protest his increasingly dicta-
torial behavior. The Iranian economy was in shambles as the effects of 
a British boycott on Iranian oil took hold. The Prime Minister seemed 
unwilling or unable to exert the authority of the central government 
against growing crowds of Tudeh-inspired demonstrators. The State 
Department thought Mossadeq vulnerable to Tudeh subversion or even 
' Mossadeq's negotiating style baffled most Westerners. He frequently wept, fainted, 
and conducted business while in his pajamas. British author L.P. Elwell-Sutton captured 
the attitude of British foreign policy officials when he wrote, "Really, it seemed hardly 
fair that dignified and correct western statesmanship should be defeated by the antics of 
incomprehensible Orientals." L.P. Elwell-Sutton, Persian Oil: A Study in Power Poli-
tics (London: Lawrence and Wishart Ltd., 1955), p. 258. (u)

CIA's role in Mossadeq's fall quickly became an open secret and

The Office of National Estimates and TPAJAX (s) 
The Board of National Estimates (BNE) in the Office of National 
Estimates (ONE) was CIA's analytical component responsible for pro-
ducing long-range appraisals of world events. These appraisals, known 
as National Intelligence Estimates, ideally represented the Intelligence 
Community's best thinking on a particular topic. Under the leadership 
first of Harvard historian William Langer, and then Yale historian Sher-
man Kent, ONE took the long view and did not concern itself with day-
to-day events or crises. Instead, it concentrated on trends and probable 
future courses of action of other nations. Primarily because the Soviet 
Union was the focus of its attention, ONE paid little attention to Iran. 
These priorities changed when Mossadeq's Iran became a critical issue 
in US foreign policy.' (U)

ONE did not always have the cooperation of the clandestine ser-
vices when drafting an estimate. In 1951, the year before DCI Walter 
Bedell Smith merged the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC, the of-
fice responsible for covert action) and the Office of Special Operations 
(OSO, the office responsible for espionage) into the new Directorate of 
Plans, Dr. William Langer, head of BNE, asked OSO for its views for 
an upcoming national intelligence estimate on Iran. OSO management 
resisted the request on several grounds: (1) OSO had too many similar 
requests from ONE, (2) OSO personnel "were not paid to 'estimate,' but 
to produce facts," and (3) OSO personnel could barely keep up with 
their assigned duties, much less help ONE do its job.4 OSO clearly was 
not interested in dialogue with analytical components for the purpose of 
producing a superior analytical product. (s) 
ONE' s ability to produce accurate national intelligence estimates 
on Iran in the early 1950s suffered because the office knew next to noth-
ing about the Tudeh. 
(s) 
the OSO Iranian desk officer, admitted that his field 
people had only a handful of low-level contacts within the Tudeh Party 
 Hewitt did not think the absence ot intelligence on the ludeh 
reflected OSO' s lack of interest; as he explained to Kent, that office had 
been preoccupied almost exclusively with the Soviet Union and could 
not divert scarce resources to working the Iranian problem. Even if OSO 
had turned immediately to Iran, the office faced significant obstacles 
recruiting Iranian informants who  could provide the sort of high-level, 
reliable information ONE needed.

Yet in March 1953 it was clear that 
I 
(b)(1) 
(b)(3) 
had made giant strides in collecting information from Iranian sources. 
Acting Division Chief Miles Copeland assured Deputy Director (Plans) 
Frank Wisner that "when we report on the activities of an important in-
dividual such as Mossadegh or the Shah, we are in almost all cases get-
ting our information directly from a dependable espionage agent in 
intimate contact with the individual reported upon."' Copeland's mem-
orandum noted that intelligence reporting on Iran had greatly improved 
but did not mention whether the analytical components were receiving 
these reports. In all likelihood the analysts never saw most of them, 
which helps explain why ONE found it difficult to draft satisfactory 
NIEs on Iran. (c) 
The Office of Current Intelligence and TPAJAX (S) 
The tension between ONE and the clandestine services was unfor-
tunate but not potentially crippling to American policymakers during 
fast-breaking events. ONE concentrated on larger perspectives that 
were not sensitive to daily crises. The Office of Current Intelligence 
(OCI), on the other hand, analyzed events as they happened. OCI ana-
lysts could help shape policymakers' views and decisions during crises. 
Their writing could have an immediate impact. (u) 
In the summer of 1953, OCT was responsible for keeping the Pres-
ident informed about daily events that might affect US foreign policy.

maybe simply kept our mouth shut about it until it went off."i� (C) 
After TPAJAX tried to develop closer personal ties with his 
counterparts in the DDP. He did not expect the operators in the Iran 
Branch to tell him what was going on all the time, but he wanted to de-
velop a relationship so that "they would trust me enough that they might 
tell me things that otherwise wouldn't get on paper, and so on. And by 
the same token to demonstrate to them that we could help them."" (S) 
gradually built a rapport with DDP officers that he says paid 
off for both sides. Nonetheless, he thinks that more cooperation could 
have improved the intelligence product immensely. When he trans-
ferred to the DDP in 1957 "and started clawing through the files, one 
thing that struck me was how much useful intelligence information was 
in the operational files but had never made it out into intelligence 
reports because the reports officer or whoever had just not spotted it as 
intelligence report material." 12 (C) 
(b)(3) is philosophical about the limited contact that he and the oth-
er analysts in his branch had with the people on the Iranian desk in the 
Directorate of Plans. There was, he says, "indeed a very deep gulf, 
institutionally, and policywise," and he speculates that the reason lay in 
differences between overt and covert employees. He and his fellow 
analysts were overt; many DDP employees were covert. From the

DDP's perspective, overt employees were not sufficiently sensitive to 
security issues. "There was a measure of distrust," believes, "on 
the DDP side against these overt analysts who probably had loose 
tongues and if we [in DDP] talk too much they'll [OCI analysts] go 
blabbing around town."" (c)  
John Waller makes the 
same assessment of the relationship between the analysts and operators. 
In a July 1995 interview, Waller suggested two additional reasons for 
the unofficial separation between the two directorates. First, most Irani-
an specialists in the DDP were OSS veterans who had spent substantial 
amounts of time in the Middle East. They had acquired their knowledge 
from practical experience and thought that knowledge acquired this way 
was superior to the academic knowledge that Directorate of Intelligence 
(DI) analysts prized. Second, the DDP officers' relationships with the 
DI analysts were informal. "There was a lot of time," Waller said, 
"before you sort of had a wiring diagram that put us [DDP] together 
with the DI. It was all based on if you need their help, go get it, but 
you'd better know who you were talking to. There's no point in talking 
to a man who's only read the books you've read."4 (u) 
Bureaucratic differences probably played an important part in 
reinforcing the separation between the DDP and the DI. DDP officers 
may have thought that if the DI were included in covert action planning, 
analysts would begin to challenge DDP' s preeminence in covert opera-
tions. Similarly, DI analysts may have feared that DDP operators would 
question their analytical preeminence and that close association with a 
covert action would raise questions about their objectivity. Philosophi-
cal, organizational, and physical separation ensured that these kinds of 
issues seldom touched off bureaucratic warfare. (u) 
At least in the case of TPAJAX, the relationship between the DDP 
and the DI contrasted sharply with the relationship between DDP and 
the State Department. After the operation, John Stutesman, former 
Second Secretary of the American Embassy in Tehran, wrote to Roy 
Melbourne, First Secretary of the Embassy in Tehran, telling him of the 
close personal relationship he had developed with CIA's John Waller 
and Roger Goiran. "John Waller and (b)(1)

Allen Dulles's Personal Directorate of Intelligence (U) 
The highest levels of management in CIA did nothing to discour-
age the estrangement of the Directorate of Plans and the Directorate of 
Intelligence, and in fact reinforced it. Allen Dulles ignored the Agen-
cy's analytical arm during TPAJAX, preferring to use personal acquain-
tances as sources of information. I6 He had numerous contacts across the 
world and throughout American society from his prewar days as an 
attorney and his wartime service in the Office of Strategic Services. 
Personal relationships were important to Dulles, and he tended to trust 
the information he got from people he knew. On Iran, much of this in-
formation came from Brig. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and Max 
Thornburg, an oil industry consultant. There is no evidence that Dulles 
ever passed on information from these sources to analysts in ONE or 
OCI. (S) 
Schwarzkopf had spent considerable time in Iran, had trained the 
Iranian Gendarmerie during World War II, and knew the Shah well. 
Through his work with this police force, which maintained a presence 
in all the provinces, Schwarzkopf became a storehouse of knowledge 
about Iran and was happy to share it with Dulles." (0) 
Max Thornburg ran Overseas Consultants, Inc., a firm that 
advised Middle Eastern governments on oil and economic questions. In 
1950 he was in Iran as a consultant to the government, advising Iranian  
officials about the country's seven-year economic plan. 
ft Peter Grose's biography of Dulles captures this characteristic well. "Institutional ties 
never inhibited Allen from nurturing his own private networks of diverse colleagues and 
friends, many dating back decades, upon whom he would call in his regular trips to Eu-
rope for civilized exchanges among men and, increasingly, women of the world." Peter

Thornburg gained unusual access to then-Deputy Director (Plans) 
Allen Dulles and key State Department officials. He maintained a 
steady correspondence with both CIA and State about events in the 
Middle East. Thornburg was not shy about telling "Allen" what he 
thought should be done, and consistently urged that the United States 
had to change the psychological climate in the Middle East. He also ar-
gued that the Shah was not weak, but only "young, beaten-down and un-
derstandably skeptical about any real support coming from the United 
States or Britain."19 Thornburg sat in on several sessions with Dulles 
and drafted some papers for CIA. (5) 
The Operation (U) 
(b)(3) 
The initial plan depended upon a military coup to remove Mossa-
deq. Planners in CIA's Iran Branch in the Near East and Africa Division 
of the Directorate of Plans (DDP, the forerunner of the current Director-
ate of Operations), hoped that Mossadeq's arrest would lead to a blood( b)(1 ) 
less change of leadership. After prompting from (b)(3) 
Americans, such as Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf2� and NEA Divison 
Chief Kermit Roosevelt, the Shah signed orders dismissing Mossadeq 
and replacing him with Zahedi. With the Shah's signed decrees, or fir-
mans, in hand, Col. Nematollah Nassiri of the Shah's Imperial Guard ar-
rived at Mossadeq' s Tehran home on the night of 15/16 August 1953. 
Mossadeq, however, had been tipped off that Nassiri was coming and

was prepared. When Nassiri attempted to deliver the papers, troops 
loyal to Mossadeq arrested him.21 
Early in the morning of the 16th, Radio Tehran broadcast the news 
that a military plot against the government had been uncovered and 
foiled. It appeared that Mossadeq had triumphed, for the anti-Mossadeq 
officers' resolve melted as soon as Nassiri was arrested. They failed to 
seize their assigned objectives and many simply hid, hoping the whole 
thing would blow over. It did not. The Shah left his summer palace in 
the suburbs of Tehran and flew to Baghdad. The Iranian Communist 
Party took to the streets challenging the authority of Mossadeq's gov-
ernment, demanding the Shah's life, and toppling statutes of the Shah's 
father. Mossadeq stood by and did nothing to suppress the Communist 
mobs." (ti) 
Kermit Roosevelt, who had arrived in Tehran to take field com-
mand of the operation, was momentarily at a loss. Nassiri's arrest forced 
him to improvise and he beaan by 2etting in touch with his assets. 
(S) 
On the night of 18 August 1953, Mossadeq finally ordered securi-
ty forces to clear the streets of Tudeh demonstrators. Some did so with 
a will, and forced the bloodied Iranian Communists to shout pro-Shah 
slogans as they were being beaten. On Wednesday morning, 19 August, 
the tide began to turn irreversibly against Mossadeq. A small pro-Shah

 -began at about 0900 in the bazaar of Tehran. 
The crowd milled aimlessly until several people went into a small print 
shop and returned with copies of the Shah's firmans. The firmans were 
the spark the crowd needed. Eager hands reached for copies and the 
supply soon ran out.25 (S) 
At this point members of Iranian Zuhrkaneh (exercise clubs) ap-
peared at the head of the crowd. Weightlifters, tumblers, and acrobats  i 
exercised in unison while shouting pro-Shah slogans. (b)(1) 
 (b)(3) 
 iThe enthusiasm was infectious, and 
spread quickly. The crowds surged toward the offices of the pro-Mos-
sadeq and anti-American newspaper Bakhtar Emruz and destroyed 
them as security forces watched.26 (s) 
During this time the military had remained quiet. Although many 
members of the officer corps opposed Mossadeq, they hesitated to move 
against the Prime Minister until they saw which way public opinion 
would swing. By 1130 there was no longer any doubt about Tehran's 
pro-Shah sentiment, and truckloads of soldiers sped through the streets 
waving the monarch's picture. Radio Tehran fell into royalist hands and 
at 1530 was broadcasting what Roosevelt later called "deliriously pro-
Zahedi" messages. Tanks from the Imperial Guard escorted Fazlollah 
Zahedi to Radio Tehran, where he declared that he was the legitimate 
Prime Minister. By the late afternoon of the 19th, Zahedi had consoli-
dated his hold on the government, Mossadeq was under arrest, and forc-
es loyal to the former leader were in jail or in hiding. The Shah returned 
to a tumultuous welcome in Tehran on 22 August 1953, where he re-
mained until the Iranian revolution and establishment of the Islamic 
Republic in 1979.27 (u) 
The Consequences of Analytical Exclusion (u) 
TPAJAX illustrates the philosophical tension inherent in planning 
covert operations. Preparation must balance the need for fully informed 
decisionmaking with the need for strict operational security. The former 
requires that those with knowledge relevant to the operation be 
intimately involved from the start, while the latter requires that the 
number of people involved be kept to a minimum. (s)

CIA and TPAJAX Nitret 
An ideal operation is at neither extreme and acknowledges the in-
evitability of tradeoffs. Covert actions might have to be planned on im-
perfect knowledge to ensure that they remain covert, and there may 
have to be compromises on absolute security in order to take advantage 
of relevant available expertise. How to balance these conflicting re-
quirements has been a recurring issue throughout the history of CIA's 
covert operations. TPAJAX offers some clues on how this tension 
might be resolved in some cases. (S) 
TPAJAX was planned and executed with far greater concern for 
operational security than for ensuring that the planners had all relevant 
information. There is no evidence that operators in the Iran Branch of 
Kermit Roosevelt's Near East and Africa Division consulted either 
ONE or OCT at any stage of the operation. ONE and OCT might not have 
been able to provide much help because they had chronic difficulty get-
ting intelligence reporting from DDP (the component responsible for 
espionage and covert action)�a problem that itself reflects poor com-
munication between the analysts and collectors. (S) 
The consequences of the analysts' exclusion from TPAJAX can be 
examined from its effect on analysis itself (product and process), and on 
the preparation and execution of the operation. Exclusion damaged the 
analytical product because it prevented OCT analysts from basing their 
judgments on complete information. Exclusion harmed the analytical 
process because it impeded the creation of a valid framework for assess-
ing future developments. (5) 
Had they been apprised of the US role in deposing Mossadeq, an-
alysts probably would have been more circumspect in concluding that, 
because the Iranian Prime Minister had turned back coup attempts in the 
past, he was likely to prevail again. Knowledge that this time the United 
States was supporting Mossadeq' s opponents with extraordinary mea-
sures might have changed or tempered this judgment. Inclusion in TPA-
TAX planning might have made analysts more inclined to recognize the 
operation's potential for success. (s) 
Whether the segregation of analysis from operational planning af-
fected the conception and execution of TPAJAX is less certain. The 
analysis was essentially incompati-
ble with the planned covert political action, but did 
not dissuade the President, the Secretary of State, and the DCI from 
executing TPAJAX. Under these circumstances, one can make a strong 
argument that analytical exclusion had negligible consequences for 
TPAJAX. (s)

Fully informed analysis, nevertheless, might have enhanced the 
operation. The Dl's more scholarly and detached perspective and its 
methodology for assessing a dynamic situation perhaps could have 
helped NEA clarify the assumptions upon which TPAJAX was based, 
and how changes in those assumptions might affect the operation. (s) 
The operation's initial failure on 15 August 1953 provides the 
most conspicuous evidence that the absence of analytical expertise may 
have been detrimental. When Col. Nematollah Nassiri of the Shah's 
Imperial Guard arrived at Mossadeq's home to arrest him, Mossadeq 
arrested him. The Prime Minister had been informed that an attempt to 
depose him was underway, and had acted vigorously to head off the 
threat by calling on troops loyal to him. Col. Nassiri's arrest disheart-
ened the other anti-Mossadeq officers, and the military challenge to 
Mossadeq melted away. Headquarters wanted to call off the operation. 
Had operational planning taken into account the possibility�even the 
likelihood�that segments of the Iranian military would react this way, 
DDP could have prepared contingency plans. (u) 
Incorporating analytical products into the planning for TPAJAX 
might not have guaranteed success�which owed much to Kermit 
Roosevelt's flexibility and initiative�but it would have forced the op-
erators to question their assumptions and recognize that things might go 
wrong. If someone other than Roosevelt had been on the scene, things 
might have gone differently. (s) 
Advances in collection technology have given today's analysts ac-
cess to an almost bewildering array of sources inconceivable to their 
colleagues of 44 years ago. The exponential growth of information from 
signals intelligence, imagery, and exotic collection platforms supple-
ments but cannot replace clandestine reporting. Analytical products will 
be much richer if they add clandestine reporting to these sources; in 
turn, clandestine operators will have analysis that is fully informed and 
therefore more useful (u).

Closing the Missile Gap (U) 
Leonard F. Parkinson and Logan H. Potter 
The search for information on the Soviet missile program became 
the most critical and elusive intelligence problem and the most demand-
ing in terms of approach and management of the many substantive issues 
encountered in the first 20 years of strategic research at CIA. The Agen-
cy drafted its first national intelligence estimate on Soviet guided missile 
development in 1954. Nonetheless, it was not until 1957 that American 
policymakers, military planners, and intelligence analysts began to wor-
ry that the Soviet missile program had outstripped US development ef-
forts. TASS' announcement of a successful flight test of an 
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in August 1957, followed in the 
next few weeks by the launches of Sputniks I and II�the world's first 
artificial satellites�prompted the Intelligence Community to draft its 
fourth estimate of the Soviet missile program in as many years. Special 
National Intelligence Estimate 11-10-57 can be considered the begin-
ning of the "missile gap" controversy; its judgment that the Soviet SS-6 
ICBM flight test program had "an extremely high priority.., if indeed it 
is not presently on a 'crash' basis," would be reconsidered and hotly 
debated for several more years.' At the heart of the dispute was an infor-
mation gap of major proportions that was closed in late 1961 by those 
sources that at the beginning were thought to have the greatest prom-
ise clandestine, communications, and photographic intelligence. (S)

400 German scientists and technicians to the USSR. Using this German 
base, the USSR created a large research and development program for 
rockets of all types, including ballistic missiles. Almost all of the indus-
trial effort supporting this activity was obscured from the West by high-
ly effective security procedures. (0) 
On 5 February 1959 Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev an-
nounced to the world that the Soviet Union "now has the means to de-
liver a blow to aggressors in any part of the world. It is not just rhetoric 
when we say that we have organized the mass production of interconti-
nental ballistic missiles; nor do we say this as a threat to anyone, but to 
make clear the real situation."' US analysts had watched Soviet missile 
development for years, and this was not the first of Khrushchev's many 
boasts. Nonetheless, his new threat, along with others in the winter of 
1958-59, had commanded the attention of DCI Allen Dulles and the 
new United States Intelligence Board (USIB) of the National Security 
Council. USIB assigned the drafting of an assessment for the DCI to the 
Guided Missiles Branch of the Directorate of Intelligence's Office of 
Research and Reports (ORR). The task of reevaluating the evidence fell 
to Roland Inlow, Chief of ORR' s Guided Missiles Branch. His branch's 
report that winter noted that only limited new evidence on Soviet ICBM 
development had appeared, and was still being evaluated.' (s) 
Meanwhile, interest in Soviet ICBM statements continued at a 
high level through the first half of 1959, a period in which Khrushchev's 
first Berlin campaign withered away in the face of NATO's united re-
sponse to his six-month deadline for a one-sided German peace treaty. 
In February or March, Inlow requested an analysis of Moscow's rocket 
claims from the DDI' s Radio Propaganda Branch of the Foreign Broad-
cast Information Division (FBID). In June, at the request of DDI Robert 
Amory, Edward Proctor and Inlow collaborated on a paper assessing 
FBID's assessment of the Soviet statements. The June paper, like In-
low's January memorandum for the White House, accepted as fact the 
assertion that the USSR had commenced mass production of interconti-
nental ballistic missiles.4 (C)

Closing the Missile Gap Siserct 
In response to White House and Congressional concern that de-
ployment and series production were under way somewhere in the 
USSR, CIA scheduled three major estimates for late 1959 on the Soviet 
program. In retrospect, these stood as the crucial NIEs of the entire mis-
sile controversy; they established a realistic forecast for the beginning 
of deployment of the first operational missiles. Two estimates projected 
numbers of launchers, and, for the first time, subordinated total numbers 
of missiles to the militarily more important number of launchers. 
Finally, the same two NIEs marked the beginning of the Intelligence 
Community's internal controversy over the intended size and pace of 
the Soviet ICBM program. (u) 
Controversy With the Air Force (u) 
Sherman Kent, chairman of the Board of National Estimates, 
asked that Edward Proctor be made available to work full time on the 
three estimates. Proctor was detailed to the Office of National Estimates 
(ONE) in South Building that August. In the meantime, the interagency 
Guided Missile and Astronautics Intelligence Committee (GMAIC), the 
Office of Scientific Intelligence's (OSI) Guided Missile Division, and 
ORR' s Guided Missiles Branch spent all of August preparing contribu-
tions. Supplementary contributions for the estimates and memoranda on 
ICBM production for senior officials in the Eisenhower administration 
and for DCI Allen Dulles took the rest of the year. (C) 
To support this research and analysis, Dulles called on the 
"Hyland panel" to try to answer a more refined set of questions.' The 
panel comprised Laurence Hyland of Hughes Aircraft, Charles R. Irvine 
of Advanced Research Projects Agency, and Brig. Gen. Osmond J. Rit-
land of the Air Force's Ballistic Missile Division. These holdovers from 
the previous year's three-day meeting were joined by Maj. Gen. John B. 
Medaris of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, OSI' s consultant Dr. W. 
H. Pickering of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Rear Adm. William F. 
Raborn, Jr., Director of Navy's Special Projects (Raborn, then working 
on the Polaris nuclear submarine program, would become DCI in 1965), 
Dr. Albert D. Wheelon of Space Technology Laboratory, and Dr.

its attention to some critical questions:

what progress toward development of an operational weapon 
system are the Soviets likely to have made to date from test 
activities at Tyura Tam?6 Is there evidence of support to this 
program in activities at Kapustin Yar? 
� What is the likelihood that the program has already been suc-
cessful enough to permit the USSR to establish an initial opera-
tional capability? What characteristics might an operational 
ICBM system have at present? 
� What is the likelihood that the Soviets have or are now flight 
testing more than one generation of ICBM? 
� Is there any evidence to support the present existence of or 
preparation for an operational ICBM capability in the USSR? 
Or a production program for ICBMs and system equipment? 
Would such evidence be detectable by current US collection 
capabilities?

the tests, now evaluated as ICBMs, may in reality be develop-
ment of space vehicle propulsion systems? 
� What changes, if any, are required in the panel's November 1958 
report regarding ICBM production quantities and timing?' (S) 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/27 C05500084 
The panel came up with some tentative answers. The members 
correctly concluded that the SS-6 weighed about 500,000 pounds, and 
came close to the mark with an estimate of 750,000 pounds of initial 
thrust (its thrust was one million pounds). On the basis of continued SS-
6 testing and the lack of evidence of the development of a second--
generation ICBM, the panel members did not doubt that the SS-6 would 
be deployed. They had doubts, however, regarding the configuration of 
the missile, and could not choose between a "parallel stage" or a "one-
and-a-half stage." Like the rest of the contemporary Intelligence 
Community, the panel was right in its estimation of a 6,000-pound 
warhead.' (s) 
The Hyland panel's conclusion that the pace of the Soviet program 
was "deliberate" was a sharp turn from the community's earlier belief 
in a crash program. This key conclusion was largely based on the small 
number of tests that the USSR had conducted since the panel's last 
meeting in November 1958. Up to that time, 10 tests had taken place at 
Tyuratam. The panel expected 20 to 30 more would be conducted by 
July 1959, but by the time the panel met in August, the Soviets had test-
ed only 15 more. Thus, the total was 25, instead of the panel's anticipat-
ed 30 to 40. In light of this limited testing, the panel concluded that the 
only short-term development could be a deployment of 10 ICBMs. The 
operational site the panel picked was at Polyarnyy Ural in northern Rus-
sia. The Intelligence Community had detected construction activity at

Closing the Missile Gap 
The premise of a deliberate pace in the Soviet testing program led the 
panel to conclude that the Soviets would deploy no more than 400 to 500 
missiles and that these could be operational by late 1962.'0 This premise 
and conclusion had a major impact on the next three national intelligence 
estimates. The first was NIE 11-5-59, a reference aid designed to display 
all available intelligence data on the capabilities of Soviet missiles and 
space vehicles. The estimate formally endorsed the panel's premise�
based on a smaller number of tests than had been anticipated�that the So-
viet ICBM program was proceeding in an orderly fashion. Initial opera-
tional capability would be, the NIE assumed for planning purposes, 1 
January 1960. But the estimate did not restate the panel's conclusion on 
operational ICBM levels; it made no effort to project force levels." (S) 
NIE 11-8-59 did and, in so doing, formally inaugurated the Intelli-
gence Community controversy. For the first time, missiles on launchers 
became the central measure of force levels. But in the range of projec-
tions, the low side was directly keyed to the output of a single plant, the 
high side to two plants. Army and Navy opted for the low side; State, Air 
Force, and the Pentagon chose the high side out to mid-1961. Beyond that 
period, a formal dissent from the Air Force's Assistant Chief of Staff, In-
telligence, Maj. Gen. James H. Walsh, provided still higher figures (see 
table below).

The Air Force did not object to the community's new conclusion 
that the Soviet ICBM effort was "not a crash program." Rather, Walsh 
attacked the idea that "The goal of the [Soviet ICBM] program is prob-
ably an ICBM force as large as Soviet planners deem necessary to 
provide a substantial deterrent and preemptive attack capability." In his 
view, the Soviet Union was trying to attain decisive military superiority 
over the United States and would not be satisfied either with deterrence 
or a preemptive attack capability. 12 (u) 
NIE 11-4-59 followed 11-8-59, although formal USIB concur-
rence for both came on 9 February 1960. NIE 11-4-59 differed sharply 
from the Air Force's belief that the Soviet program was aimed at all-out 
superiority. The estimate held that, while the USSR would build a 
"substantial long-range missile force," uncertainties, risks, and high 
economic costs would prevent it from constructing a force powerful 
enough to "permit them to plan attacks on Western retaliatory forces 
with the degree and certainty of success required to insure that the 
USSR could win a general war without incurring unacceptable dam-
age." n (U) 
Of the three estimates, NlE 11-8-59 was by far the most important, 
because of the controversy surrounding its quantitative projections of 
ICBM force levels. Its major flaw was the lack of knowledge of the So-
viet decision to limit deployment of SS-6 ICBMs, an analytical mistake 
that the Intelligence Community made on the basis of the strongest 
evidence available�the continued testing of the SS-6. NIE 11-8-59 was 
mainly Proctor's effort, and DDI Robert Amory and ONE' s Sherman 
Kent commended him for it. Proctor briefed DCI Dulles in December 
on the draft estimate. The NIE became the basis for Dulles' s testimony 
in the acrimonious joint Senate committee hearing on Friday, 29 
January 1960.'4 (C)

followed the hearing. DCI Dulles appeared as the prime witness before 
the Senate's Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and the Pre-
paredness Investigating Subcommittee of the Committee on Armed Ser-
vices, both chaired by Senator Lyndon B. Johnson (D-TX). (u) 
Johnson called the committees to order and announced that its 
members intended to "interrogate (Allen Dulles) not only as to the na-
ture and magnitude of the threat, but also to determine why the yardstick 
for measuring this threat was changed, and the extent to which it has 
been changed." Johnson noted that Secretary of Defense Neil H. McEl-
roy had testified the previous year that the Soviets "could have a 3-to-1 
missile superiority in the near future." In a January 1960 hearing only a 
week before Dulles's testimony, the new Secretary of Defense, Thomas 
S. Gates, Jr., said that there was no "missile gap" because the analytical 
assumptions had changed. According to Gates, the US Intelligence 
Community now looked at the issue from the perspective of what the 
Soviets intended to do rather than what they could do. '5 (s) 
In his testimony on 29 January, DCI Dulles repeatedly explained 
that the latest estimate did not rely exclusively on a "new yardstick," but 
that as more and more evidence on the Soviet ballistic-missile program 
came into CIA, Agency analysts were able to get a hold on Soviet pro-
gramming decisions.16 (s) 
Dulles used a chart to point out that 15 of the 21 successful Soviet 
ICBM firings to 3,500 nautical miles or more had taken place in 1959. 
"Somewhere in the range of 20 percent" of the tests failed after launch, 
but the CIA did not know the number of failures before launch.17 The 
DCI then discussed the more recent tests, and concluded that the Soviet 
Union had made "very real progress in ballistic missiles during 1959," 
with a measured and orderly test-firing program. "For planning purpos-
es," he said, the USSR had an initial operating capability of "a few, say 
ten" operational ICBMs at completed launching facilities. is (s)

7- - 
After a brief treatment of the community's reexamination of Sovi-
et ICBM accuracy and reliability, Dulles turned to the projected ICBM 
force goals over the next two years, using another chart to explain the 
changes from the 1958 estimate. He observed that such deployments 
could be accomplished by the middle of the next year without apprecia-
bly hindering other Soviet military programs or civil programs relating 
to the goals of the USSR's Seven-Year Plan. At this point, Dulles 
acknowledged that there was a conflict with Air Force Intelligence, 
which "believes that the growth of the missile force, particularly after 
1962, will be considerably greater than this."'" (s) 
Dulles then spelled out the Intelligence Community's generally 
agreed position on Soviet strategic intentions. The figures he used 
assumed that the Soviets were not engaged in a "crash" ICBM develop-
ment program and were not subordinating everything else to it. Dulles 
explained that Khrushchev was persuaded that he had the ability to take 
over the Free World without war, and "therefore he is straining his 
resources and his capabilities in many ways to promote his ability to 
take over the free world in this way."2" (S) 
Dulles had to endure a vigorous cross-examination from Special 
Counsel Edwin L. Weisl, lasting until the hearing recessed at 1735. The 
Senate's skeptical response to Dulles's testimony at this hearing would 
influence the next several national estimates as well as Edward Proc-
tor's and Roland Inlow's work days (and nights) in ways that they and 
about 30 other CIA officers would long remember. (s) 
The Guided Missile Task Force (U) 
Angry over the course and tone of the Senate hearing, Dulles im-
mediately intensified CIA's intelligence effort against Soviet ICBMs. 
He ordered a briefing to learn in detail the activities of each component 
in the Intelligence Community dealing with the enigma of Soviet ICBM 
deployment. (U) 
Within CIA, the onus was initially on Inlow, who reported to 
Dulles by 5 February 1960 not only on ORR' s but also on OSI' s activ-
ities related to the problem of deployment. With time only to complete

Closing the Missile Gap 
a rough draft, Inlow's defense emphasized that not a single Soviet 
ICBM launch site had yet been identified. He reported that NIE 11-8-59 
was controversial mainly because USIB member agencies could not 
agree about their views on the Soviet ICBM goal: military superiority, 
a high level of deterrence, or a modest capability with the principal 
emphasis on space. Because of the paucity of data on intentions and 
capabilities, most of the DDI activity, Inlow wrote, "had been focused 
on stimulating and guiding collection activity."" (s) 
Inlow's briefing described the analytic effort of the past two years. 
He highlighted twelve major research areas, described their results, and 
noted the number of manhours committed to the projects thus far." The 
total DDI analytical manpower allocated directly or indirectly to the 
specific problem of ICBM deployment probably represented no more 
than 10-to-12 full-time research analysts. Moreover, it had only been 
since mid-1959 that ORR had as many as five or six analysts working 
exclusively on deployment of the 15 or so Soviet missile systems CIA 
believed operational. Resource limitations, extremely heavy demands 
for intelligence support of all kinds, and the complexity of the problem 
made it impossible to ensure systematic and comprehensive exploita-
tion of all of the material already available in the community. On the 
other hand, doubling or tripling the analytical resources devoted to the 
problem probably would not materially improve the rate of progress in 
the next year or two. (s) 
Dulles responded to Inlow' s briefing by ordering USIB members 
to cooperate in a reexamination of deployment data and to resolve the 
differences between the Air Force and the rest of the community. In 
February, USIB once again directed the GMAIC to rework the evidence 
on production and deployment. To accomplish this "highest priority" 
task as quickly as possible, USIB approved temporary working groups 
on production and deployment. GMAIC appointed Inlow chairman of 
the Production Working Group, and assigned an Army officer the chair 
on the Deployment Working Group." (s) 
The specific question before GMAIC was whether NIE 11-8-59 
had accurately estimated the pace of the Soviet ICBM program.

GMAIC' s two new working groups were to evaluate the evidence on 
every potential launch site and production facility, and each working-
group member was required to divulge the evidence his intelligence 
component held. For the effort, Inlow committed about half of the ana-
lysts in his branch plus the support of three other branches in ORR.24 (S) 
At issue was a closely held, extensive Air Force list of suspected 
ICBM launch sites. A dispute arose when Air Force, probably in late 
February 1960, briefed US1B on its isolated position. Because data 
backing up this briefing had not been made available to GMAIC, Col. 
Earl F. McFarland, Jr., USAF, reported to USIB that he had served, in 
effect, a summons on his own career component: GMAIC requested a 
written version of the briefing, with graphics, that the Air Force gave 
USIB.25 (S) 
Air Force eventually supplied the list, and by 4 April 1960 the 
Deployment Working Group completed its report. Judging from a later 
GMAIC study, the group had evaluated about 95 potential launch loca-
tions and divided these into six categories: one confirmed site 
(Tyuratam), no probable sites, and four possible sites (Kapustin Yar, 
Plesetsk, Polyarnyy Ural, and Ust' -Ukhta). Twelve other locations were 
undetermined and the remainder fell into the doubtful or negative cate-
gories. Outside the test range, not a single operational ICBM could be 
conclusively identified.2" (s) 
For Proctor and lnlow the substantive problem was baffling. They 
had evidence of continuing testing, but no evidence on deployment. The 
latter could be (and was) explained away with the argument that large 
areas of the USSR still had not been covered by the U-2 program. The 
absence of telltale signs of a substantial program, however, could not be 
explained away. US contractors had informed Proctor, Inlow, and Clar-
ence Baier of the numerous factors involved in US missile deployment, 
and these DDI officers had, in turn, used this information to determine 
the features of a substantial Soviet ICBM program (defined, as early as 
SNIE 11-10-57, as 500 operational missiles). The analogy suggested 
that the number of workers and telltale signals would have to be almost 
astronomical. Inlow assessed that hundreds of thousands�up to 
500,000 construction workers and numerous manufacturing plants

would have to be involved in a support effort to acquire this substantial 
operational ICBM capability at the times projected in the NIEs." (s) 
For the Air Force, the substantive problem was simple: the Intel-
ligence Community's collection efforts were missing critical evidence 
of a substantial Soviet ICBM program. Air Force generals, like Thomas 
S. Powers of the Strategic Air Command, publicly asserted that the 
USSR could destroy US retaliatory forces, frequently challenged the 
Eisenhower Administration's defense policy, and even more frequently 
received congressional support from influential Senators, including 
Stuart Symington, Henry Jackson, Lyndon Johnson, and John Kennedy. 
Thus, when new estimates would be made later in the year, the Air 
Force would increase its projections of deployed Soviet ICBM launch-
ers while the rest of the community would make substantial reduc-
tions�although even these overestimated the scope of the Soviet 
deployment program." (s) 
To ensure that it had not missed something, CIA undertook the 
first DDI consolidation of missile research in the Agency's history. In 
February 1960, DDI Amory suggested the idea of establishing an ad hoc 
DDI Guided Missile Task Force (GMTF), and DCI Dulles promptly 
agreed to his proposal. A single temporary component with Proctor as 
chief and Inlow as his deputy included OSI and ORR expertise. Not 
only did this arrangement reflect Agency senior officials' confidence in 
Proctor and Inlow, it also gave de facto recognition to ORR that it had 
the primary responsibility for CIA intelligence analysis on the building 
and fielding of rockets (with OSI retaining responsibility for analysis of 
research and development).29 (C) 
The GMTF included about 30 analysts when it began operations 
in April 1960. The Task Force dispensed with standard administrative 
chores and occupied itself with substantive and methodological prob-
lems. Even the title of the group did not apparently concern its admin-
istrators. It was, for example, sometimes referred to in its own reports 
as the "DD/I Task Force on Long-Range Ballistic Missiles," or the 
"DD/I Task Force on Ballistic Missiles," or just the "DD/I Task Force."

Proctor's and Inlow's GMTF produced detailed and comprehen-
sive reports on both ICBM production and deployment. The principal 
objectives of the task force were spelled out in Proctor's first six-month 
status report the following October: 
� The allocation of adequate personnel resources and their inte-
gration into an effective research team on the problems of pro-
duction and deployment of long-range ballistic missiles. 
� A more intensive focusing of the research effort on the substan-
tive areas most likely to yield definite results. 
� Assurance that all available evidence is being thoroughly and 
systematically exploited. 
� Development of new approaches to both research and collection 
problems. (s) 
His summation of the results of the first six months was honest, his 
forecast for a breakthrough (a view which apparently reflected his con-
cern about the trouble-plagued CORONA project) was pessimistic, and 
his strategy was simply to try harder: "The fact that we have not 
achieved and cannot yet anticipate major breakthroughs," Proctor not-
ed, "has further increased our sense of urgency in seeking solutions to 
this critical problem."'" (s) 
The "missile gap" controversy that Spring led directly to a spec-
tacular failure�the Soviet shootdown of Francis Gary Powers's U-2 on 
1 May 1960. The primary targets for the Powers mission were 
Tyuratam, Severodvinsk, and the suspect ICBM complexes at Plesetsk 
and Yur'ya. The planned mission would have identified launch facili-
ties at Plesetsk and Yur'ya. More importantly, Yur'ya and Complex C 
at Tyuratam could have been identified with a second-generation 
ICBM, thereby questioning the basis of the NIEs that had opened the 
dispute in the first place. But the U-2's crash and Powers's capture 
marked the abrupt end of the U-2 program over the USSR, and contrib-
uted to Proctor's forecast that major breakthroughs could not be antici-
pated.'' (c)

overlooked anything. In June, GMAIC' s ad hoc Production Working 
Group completed a 109-page supplement to its earlier evaluation of po-
tential ICBM production plants.32 The supplement supported earlier 
findings that the Scientific Research Institute (NII 88) in Kaliningrad 
"probably" fabricated ICBMs for the test range (it did) and that Design 
Bureau (OKB) Plant 456 in Chimki "very probably" developed the en-
gines used in the Soviet ICBMs (as it did as well). Four categories of 
missile production (airframe, production and final assembly, propul-
sion, and ground-rail transport) and some 50 individual plants had been 
evaluated in the process of preparing the group's supplement. The De-
ployment Working Group used this study as part of its review (which 
could confirm only Tyuratam as an ICBM launch area), completed in 
September." (s) 
The two GMAIC reports formed the base for the extensive support 
the GMTF provided on NIE 11-8-60. The task force took four major ap-
proaches. First, GMTF Deployment Group attempt- (b)(3) 
ed to determine the most likely Soviet concepts for ICBM deployment. 
In this endeavor, the group used data from the Soviet test ranges, infor-
mation on missile characteristics, and (with support from Space Tech-
nology Laboratory) relevant analogies from the US missile business. 
Second, Baier' s GMTF Production Group reviewed Soviet long-range 
missile programs to identify the kinds of activity taking place at various 
phases of each program and to determine the extent of interrelation-
ships. Third, Baier' s group tried to develop a methodology for estimat-
ing the production capacity of a final assembly plant. Finally, the same 
group prepared a detailed analysis of the major ballistic missile proto-
type production centers located in the Moscow area. 34 (s) 
None of the GMTF studies was complete by the time the Intelli-
gence Community published NIE 11-8-60, but then none was expected 
to improve the projection on ICBM deployment because U-2 photo-

controversy over Soviet ICBMs got out of hand and the NIE of 1960 
increased rather than reduced uncertainty. (U) 
The End of the Dark Era (U) 
With the circulation of NIE 11-8-60 on 1 August 1960, the contro-
versy over Soviet ICBMs hit an historic level of acrimony. Unable to re-
solve any significant differences regarding projected force levels, the 
estimate illustrated individual departmental and agency positions in a 
chart. Program "A," estimating a Soviet force of 400 ICBMs by mid-
1963, was the DCP s pick as the nearest approximation of the actual So-
viet program. The Air Force's Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, ar-
gued for the more ambitious program "B," estimating a Soviet force of 
700 ICBMs by mid-1963, and complained in a footnote that the rates of 
increase shown in its projection should be continued through 1965. The 
Director of Intelligence and Research of the State Department, the As-
sistant to the Secretary of Defense for Special Operations, and the Di-
rector for Intelligence of the Joint Staff picked an undefined area within 
the "A-B" range. The Army's and Navy's intelligence services believed 
that program "C" (a Soviet force of 200 ICBMs by mid-1963) most 
nearly reflected the actual Soviet effort. Most participants agreed, how-
ever, that the Soviet Union had only "a few�say 10" deployed 
ICBMs.36 (U) 
Thirty-six dissenting departmental footnotes to the estimate sup-
ported the short-term interests of the individual services. The estimate's 
summary highlighted that the threat programs "A" and "B" posed was 
practically the same through the end of 1960; that is, before the year's 
end, either projection would give the Soviets the capability to destroy 
major US metropolitan areas. At the beginning of the next year, "A" or 
"B" would pose a threat to SAC' s operational airbase system. By mid-
1961, the Air Force's projection would give Soviet planners "high as-
surance" of being able to damage most of the SAC airbase system in an 
initial salvo, whereas CIA' s projected program would reach this hypo-
thetical capability late in the year. Navy's and Army's low projection 
for 1961 (which in fact was too high) gave the Soviets the capability to 
inflict massive destruction only on US urban areas. NIE 11-8-60

above catastrophes was imminent." (U) 
Shortly after the dissemination of this extraordinarily dissent-
ridden NIE, a series of closely spaced breakthroughs marked the begin-
ning of the end of the "missile gap" controversy. The first involved CO-
RONA. After months in a standdown, a successful diagnostic flight test 
of Discoverer XIII took place on 10 August 1960. Discoverer XIV, 
launched a week later, carried a camera and 20 pounds of film. This 
mission gave the Intelligence Community its first usable satellite pho-
tographic coverage of the USSR. Although the photographs did not pro-
vide direct evidence on ICBM deployment, the next mission, launched 
on 10 December, provided the first coverage of an ICBM site. The res-
olution was much lower than that obtained from the U-2' s cameras, but 
the area of coverage was much greater and the interpretability of the 
product soon improved. This source of overhead reconnaissance would 
provide masses of highly classified information on Soviet development 
programs and deployments, but was modestly�and appropriately�
codenamed "KEYHOLE." Proctor and Inlow's task force prepared the 
first report based on KEYHOLE photography. "An Assessment of an 
Installation at Plesetsk, USSR, as an ICBM Site" represented the first of 
the all-source, in-depth studies that would become a standard item in the 
new era. (S)

On 25 October 1960, Moscow Radio reported the death ("as the 
result of an air crash" on the 24th) of Marshal Mitrofan Nedelin, the 
Commander in Chief of the recently formed Soviet Strategic Rocket 
Forces. Later analysis in the GMTF confirmed that beginning on the 
25th an unusually large number of aircraft from Moscow and Dnepro-
petrovsk had flown into the Tyuratam area. These flights could not be

sultants, and medical personne1.4� (s) 
When all the data were assembled, the disaster appeared to result 
from a malfunction of a quite different ICBM undergoing its initial range 
test. Data on ICBM launches on 2 February and 3 March 1961 confirmed 
that a new missile, later designated the SS-7, had entered the test-range 
phase. Beginning in June 1961, improved KEYHOLE photography 
exposed the progress of SS-7 deployment. Then data from a launch on 9 
April confirmed the arrival of another new missile, the SS-8. The Soviets 
had two second-generation ICBMs under development. (s) 
The third breakthrough involved Soviet Col. Oleg Vladimirovich 
Penkovskiy. In August 1960, Penkovskiy, a high-ranking official in the 
Chief Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the Red Army General Staff, 
established contact with the CIA and the British. The case would cover 
the period of August 1960 through August 1962 and provide more than 
8,000 pages of translated reporting, the bulk of which carried the code-
name IRONBARK. Most of these reports constituted highly classified 
Soviet Ministry of Defense documents. During this period, three series 
of lengthy debriefing and briefing sessions were held with Colonel Pen-
kovskiy. According to Richard Helms, then the Deputy Director for 
Plans, "Every Western intelligence requirement of any priority was 
covered with him during this time and all aspects of his knowledgeabil-
ity and access were explored." Over 90 percent of the approximately 
5,000 pages of Russian-language documentary information provided by 
Penkovskiy concerned military subjects. Roughly half of this informa-
tion came from the Chief Intelligence Directorate library, while the re-
mainder he photographed either in the missile and artillery headquarters 
of Marshal Varentsov or at the Dzerzhinskiy Academy.41 (s) 
The IRONBARK documents gave strategic researchers their first 
comprehensive look into Soviet strategic thinking. They also provided 
a wealth of information on Soviet ballistic missiles. The top secret pub-
lication of the Soviet's newly formed Strategic Rocket Forces, The 
Information Bulletin of the Missile Troops, permitted Agency analysts 
to learn the organization and structure of the USSR's strategic missile 
units, the functions of the various staffs in each unit, how these units 
were linked to the military high command in Moscow, and the activities 
of missile units at different levels of combat readiness. Through three 
sessions with Colonel Penkovskiy in England and France, sessions

which, when written up in clandestine reports, generally carried the 
innocent-sounding codename CHICKADEE, Agency analysts received 
detailed technical information on the missiles themselves, the yields of 
their warheads, targeting methods, and targets.42 (C) 
In April 1961, Penkovskiy had his first face-to-face sessions with 
his British and American case officers. In an Information Report of 16 
May 1961, Penkovskiy described the "missile gap" as a hoax. Khrus-
chev, he said, was more interested in fostering the impression that the 
Soviet Union already had a tremendous ICBM program when in fact it 
was practically nonexistent. Penkovskiy cautioned that the USSR 
would eventually have many missiles because "millions of men's ef-
forts are directed to this work," and the "entire economy of a nation is 
directed by a one-party system to which all is subordinate."43 (S) 
Penkovskiy's testimony alone was not enough to close the "mis-
sile gap," but it tentatively supported the almost heretical argument for 
a limited Soviet ICBM program. Inlow's reaction to the first CHICKA-
DEE report was to recognize that, after all the urgent collection efforts 
of the past three years, the evidence on ICBM production, deployment, 
and training "really hadn't been much."44 (s) 
Force projections in the previous estimates had been based on the 
empirically supported assumption that the Soviets would widely deploy 
the SS-6. Penkovskiy's report, following the tape of the SS-7 missile di-
saster, weakened this assumption.45 (c) 
The SS-6, though a good rocket, was in the later words of the Hyland 
Panel "a large and difficult-to-handle missile." The SS-6 used cryogenic 
fuel, which could not be stored in the missile for long. Built in Kalinin-
grad's Nil 881, the SS-6 system was reliable and no doubt met original 
design specifications, and it remained the prime booster for the Soviet 
space program. But from a technical standpoint, the inability to store fuel 
on the SS-6 (and the enormous amount of support facilities it required) 
made the cryogenic technology less desirable for military applications.

viets would deploy the SS-6 as an interim measure until second-generation missiles be-
came available. The Air Force also predicted that accelerated deployment would follow 
at a far faster pace and larger scale than did the majority of the Intelligence Community.

Closing the Missile Gap 
The smaller SS-7, built at the Dnepropetrovsk Missile Development and 
Production Center, used storable liquid fuel and did not require anywhere 
near the support facilities of the first-generation system. 46 
With new information derived from virtually every area of the 
classic and modern intelligence collection spectrum, the majority 
USIB' s NIE 11-8-61 of June 1961, Soviet Capabilities For Long-Range 
Attack, started to close the "gap" by substantially reducing projected 
force levels. But not all the revolutionary findings had been fully appre-
ciated. Only hinting that fundamental improvements in collection were 
within grasp, the estimate cautiously concluded that the evidence at 
hand was not sufficient to "establish with certainty even the present 
strength of the ICBM force." Thus the range of projection remained 
wide, but most of the estimates (save the Air Force's) were reasonable, 
and the Army's and Navy's came close to the mark (see table below).

The estimate, in a veiled reference to KEYHOLE photography of 
Plesetsk, noted that US intelligence, "through intensive collection ef-
forts by all available means," had achieved partial coverage of the re-
gions best suited to the deployment of Soviet ICBMs.� (u)

include an estimate of the largest ICBM force which the USSR could have in mid-
1961... and the probable Soviet force level in mid-1961. (Emphasis in original.) (0)

Most importantly, NIE 11-8-61 formally opened up the case for 
limited near-term deployment. Its authors were not sure whether "The 
inadequacy of confirming evidence regarding deployment is attribut-
able either to (a) the limitations of our coverage, combined with the suc-
cess of Soviet security measures, or (b) the fact that deployment has 
been on a relatively small scale to date." 48 (U) 
The Hyland Panel reconvened to try to clarify the uncertainty. The 
members for the panel's third meeting included Hyland and Perry (the 
only carryovers from the 1959 meeting); Dr. Hendrik W. Bode, the Vice 
President of Bell Telephone Laboratories; Lt. Gen. Howell M. Estes, 
the Deputy Commander of Air Force's Aerospace Systems; Dr. George 
B. Kistiakowsky from Harvard (by then a veteran in the missile contro-
versy who, from July 1959 to January 1961, had succeeded Killian as 
the President's Special Assistant for Science and Technology); Arthur 
E. Raymond, RAND Corporation's Vice President and its Director of 
Research; and Navy's Special Projects Technical Director, Rear Adm. 
Levering Smith. In early September 1961 the members heard briefings 
on the new data leading up to the new estimate and on recent determi-
nations that KEYHOLE photography of June and July 1961 had identi-
fied two ICBM complexes.4" (s) 
After considering all the evidence, the panel members decided 
that, while "there may be as many as 50 ICBM launch pads under con-
struction or in use in the USSR," there were no more than 25 operational 
launching pads. The panel concluded that the threat to the United States 
from Soviet ICBMs should be materially downgraded, and that the mis-
siles did not represent an adequate first strike capability.50 (S) 
The "missile-gap" issue was over, but it required an NIE to put it 
to final rest. NIE 11-8/1-61 of 21 September 1961 did just that in its two 
opening sentences. "New information, providing a much firmer base for 
estimates on Soviet long-range ballistic missiles, has caused a sharp 
downward revision in our estimate of present Soviet ICBM strength,"

ICBMs had come next, the panel could only describe the SS-7 as the "Category B or C" 
vehicle. The SS-8 was described, for a time, as the "Category C or B" missile. (s)

recalculation the maximum number of ICBMs that the Soviets were thought to have at 
this time was on the order of 200�just about enough to permit the Soviets to consider 
a surprise attack on the United States. The maximum has now been drastically reduced, 
however, to less than a quarter of the former figure�well under 50 ICBMs and, there-
fore, not nearly enough to allow the Soviets to consider a surprise attack on this coun-
try"; "Facts About the Missile Balance," The Washington Post, 25 September 1961. (u)

NOFORN-
The Construction of the Original 
Headquarters Building (U) 
Peyton F. Anderson and Jack B. Pfeiffer 
The Central Intelligence Agency inherited its original quarters 
from its wartime predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services. The effort 
to provide CIA with a headquarters building�acquisition, planning, 
construction, and occupancy stretched over a period of about 15 years 
(1947-62), during which Agency components in the Washington area 
were stuffed, crammed, or otherwise deployed in a variety of structures 
that never quite became "home." Congress appropriated money in 1951 
for a headquarters facility, but it still took four more years to pick a site. 
By then the funds appropriated earlier were insufficient. In the Summer 
of 1955 Congress authorized $51.5 million for the purchase of land in 
Langley, Virginia, for the extension of the George Washington Parkway, 
and the planning and construction of the new building. Once the archi-
tectural and engineering contractor was selected in July 1956, responsi-
bility for the Agency's new headquarters fell to the Real Estate and 
Construction Division (RECD) of the Office of Logistics in the Director-
ate of Support (now the Directorate of Administration). For much of the 
construction phase, RECD was succeeded in this task by the Building 
Planning Staff (BPS), an ad hoc group operating directly under James A. 
Garrison, Director of the Office of Logistics.' The entire planning, con-
struction, and moving effort also benefited from the close attention of 
Deputy Director for Support Lawrence K. White. 
Construction Begins (u) 
The first significant construction contract was for the clearing and 
grubbing of the site. This meant the removal of trees and brush from 
about half of the acreage and the clearing or removal of dead trees and 
underbrush from the rest of the tract. The contract bid opening date was 
12 September 1957. Morrison and Johnson, Inc., of Bethesda,

The Construction 
Maryland, had the low bid: $31,450.2 Work was started in October 1957 
and completed in March 1958. By this time another contract had been 
let for grading the site to bring it to the proper elevations determined by 
the site planners and for the installation of site drainage structures to 
carry off the accumulation of surface water. Under this contract, prelim-
inary roads, site parking, and storage areas were being graded and given 
a gravel-surface treatment to accommodate the building contractor's 
supplies and equipment. (c) 
The summer and fall of 1957 were marked by long dry spells for 
construction work, but almost as soon as the clearing and grubbing op-
erations started, heavy rains began to fall. The weather continued to be 
unfavorable through most of the winter of 1957-58, although perhaps 
not unfavorable enough to block completely the public relations ploy 
that the Deputy Director for Support Lawrence K. White had in mind: 
I also told him [H. S. Chandler] that I wanted to make every possi-
ble effort not only to let the grading contract as soon as possible, 
but to have some grading actually done before Congress returns to 
town on the first of January.' 
Although snowstorms were the worst for the Washington area in 
many years and the spring and summer rainfall in 1958 was well above 
normal, the grading and drainage contract was substantially finished by 
October 1958. The excavation and foundation contract, with a base bid 
of $2,289,000, was opened on 9 October 1958; and on 21 October 1958, 
the notice to proceed was issued to the Roscoe Engineering Corporation 
and the Ajax Construction Co., Inc. of Washington, D.C., as a joint ven-
ture. 
Up to this point the contracting work had been performed on the 
site as a whole. Now the job of excavating and pouring the massive con-
crete foundations for the Headquarters Building itself was split into 
three separate contracts, saving perhaps nine months to a year. While 
the work was in progress, the chief architects and engineers at Harrison 
and Abramovitz (H&A) in New York worked with BPS to pr pare the 
complex and detailed plans required for the main building. 
The high bid was $102,000! Col. Lawrence K. "Red" White, Deputy Director for Sup-
port, for many years kept a detailed log of his activities, which the authors relied on ex-
tensively in the preparation of this analysis. The relevant extracts from White's log, 
hereafter cited as Diary Notes, reside in History Staff Source Collection, HS/HC-849, 
History Staff Job 84-00499R, Box 1. The citation above is at Diary Notes, 12 September 
57. (g5 
The low and high bids for grading and drainage were $460,000 and $1,113,000, re-
spectively. The low figure was less than half the amount ($1,030,000) that had been al-
located. Ibid., 19 December 1957. SO

Even as the plans and work proceeded, Agency representatives 
were frequently harassed by Defense Department and civil defense of-
ficials about the need to incorporate expensive features intended to en-
hance protection from atomic blast and fallout. The Deputy Director of 
Support personally endured considerable badgering for his reluctance to 
take drastic steps to "harden" to facility against nuclear attack�such as 
the idea that the Agency should mine a deep shelter in the basalt bed-
rock beneath the foundation�but Colonel White held firm in his refusal 
to complicate the project any further. 4 
Additional work began at about the same time in the area of the 
Langley compound. The new four-lane George Washington Memorial 
Parkway leading to the site's north gatehouse entrance had been com-
pletely graded. Piers for the several bridges on this parkway were com-
pleted. The entire parkway project was paved and ready for use early in 
1960, well in advance of CIA's actual moving date; and as early as July 
1958 construction work had been started to widen Virginia Route 123 
leading to the south gatehouse entrance. 
The negotiations related to the access roadway situation�partic-
ularly the problems of the George Washington Parkway and the Cabin 
John bridge�were complex. The Agency was involved with the De-
partment of the Interior, the Bureau of Public Roads, the National Park 
Service, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the highway commis-
sions and engineers of the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, 
and Fairfax County.' Some of the difficulties were ironed out by the 
"old school tie": Colonel White did not hesitate to draw on his broad net 
of military acquaintances to influence the various engineering contin-
gents, many of which were headed by former Army officers. At other 
times he found opportunities for some quid pro quo. In March of 1961, 
for example, he noted: 
General Clarke, the District Engineer, and Mr. Aitken, his High-
way Supervisor, were over for lunch; however, General Clarke 
and Mr. Aitken are very much concerned about the traffic problem 
in connection with getting to and from our new building. They 
feel that the selection of Chantilly particularly is going to jam up 
the roads very much and that we may have some congestion. They 
are looking for some support to get the Chain Bridge double-
decked and to get another bridge built at the Three Sisters Island

the position of not having made an adequate transportation study 
at the time we selected this site. Gen. Clarke and Mr. Aitken said 
they both fully appreciated this and that their emphasis would all 
be on developments since the site was selected. 
Fairfax County officials were proceeding with the plans for ex-
tending water and sewer lines, and the pumping stations required for 
these facilities were under construction. Plans for the electric power 
substation to supply the Headquarters Building were well along by the 
spring of 1959. ,Ter) 
The problems of physical security during the construction of the 
new building were complex. A contract had been let for the erection of 
the security fence in August 1958, and by the middle of November the 
site was under security patrol and badges had been issued to the contrac-
tors.8 Between the fall of 1958 and February 1961, bona fides were 
obtained for about 15,000 construction workers�this in addition to the 
requirements to plan building security, badging, guard force, and the 
host of other security projects with which the Office of Security was 
charged.9f,reri 
The main building contract�that is, the superstructure contract�
had been advertised on 18 December 1958, and bids were opened on 25 
February 1959. Thirteen bids were received, and on 25 March the con-
tract was awarded to the Charles H. Tompkins Co. and the J. A. Jones

9 It was not until after the building was occupied, however, that serious attention was 
paid to the potential security risk posed by the four privately owned tracts of land adja-
cent to the new building area. Shortly after he became DCI, John A. McCone ordered 
that a study of the feasibility of purchase be undertaken; Diary Notes, 15, 19 November, 
and 14, 21 December 1962, feg). Consequently, White appointed a committee to review 
this matter; and their findings disclosed that the building was vulnerable to penetration 
by surveillance. Photographs taken in the wooded area adjacent to the front of the build-
ing indicated the feasibility of identifying personnel, with the possibility of identifying 
documents. After considerable coordination by the DDS and the DCI�with Congres-
sional committees, the Fairfax County Executive, and the Bureau of the Budget�acqui-
sition of the perimeter property was ccomplished by the mid-1960s at a cost of 
approximately half a million dollars.

Construction Co. The low bid was $33,287,600, somewhat less than had 
been expected.ikj 
The contract had gone on the construction market at an opportune 
time, in the midst of a nationwide economic recession. Business 
conditions were favorable to the Government and to the Agency. In-
deed, the money saved was soon put to good use. Of the $54,500,000 
appropriated, $8.5 million was transferred to the National Park Service 
for the extension of the George Washington Parkway to the site. The su-
perstructure and site work contract ($33,287,600), the contract with the 
Otis Elevator Co. ($1,122,669), plus other fees and contingency re-
quirements, approximated $43 million, leaving an unobligated balance 
of approximately $3 million. This amount was considered "no year 
funds," and used to purchaseoproperties adjoining the site and to con-
struct the new printing plant. 
Superstructure work started in May 1959. The contractor's first ef-
forts were directed toward organizing his work forces and executing the 
numerous subcontracts required for the project. Shop drawings�com-
pletely detailed plans based on the contract drawings and used for fab-
ricating and installing structural steel, duct work, plumbing, and 
electrical and mechanical facilities were being prepared. The forms 
for the ground-floor concrete walls and for the first-floor slab of the 
north half of the building were nearly completed by midsummer. Gov-
ernment and H&A representatives were on the site every working day 
and checked each step in the construction. They also reviewed all shop 
drawings, along with samples of the materials to be used." 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the site in November 
1959 for the ceremonial laying of the building's cornerstone. A US Air 
Force band and the Chaplain of the US Senate also graced the occasion, 
and DCI Allen Dulles made certain beforehand that a large contingent 
of the Agency's female employees had reserved seats "in order to high-
light the vital role which women play in the Agency." Accompanied by 
Dulles and a host of Washington dignitaries, the President briefly 
wielded an engraved silver trowel to set the stone in place:2 Inside the

site�but no classified documents. 3 
Steady Progress (u) 
The contract called for completion of the building by the middle 
of 1961, but a reasonable amount of delay�frequently caused by con-
ditions beyond the contractor's control�was expected on a project such 
as this. For example, there was a strike in the steel industry in August 
1959. Had this strike lasted much longer, it would have delayed con-
struction. There was every reason to believe, however, that the building 
would be completed some time during the last half of 1961. Meanwhile, 
BPS was reviewing space layout plans for the purpose of adjusting them 
to fit changes in the Agency's requirements. 
As of 31 March 1960 the contractor was slightly behind schedule, 
even though the winter weather had been reasonably favorable. There 
had been a considerable number of relatively small change orders, and 
it did not appear that completion of the contract would be extended ma-
terially. In fact, such excellent progress was being made that a portion 
of the concrete roof of the north penthouse had been poured. As was 
customary when the highest point on the construction project was 
reached, the workmen held an impromptu flag-raising ceremony, and 
for a day or two a flag flew from this rooftop. (0) 
In May, progress was marred by the only serious accident that 
occurred during the entire course of the construction. In the words of 
Colonel White: 
There was an accident today at Langley; apparently a cable broke 
allowing the scaffolding at the power building to fall. Ten people 
were hurt, seven of them very seriously. At this point one of the 
ten has died and another remains on the critical list. fjel 
Workers had been removing wooden forms from the power plant's 
concrete ceiling when one of three cables suspending the scaffolding 
snapped, tumbling the men and the forms to the boiler room floor

stance it added $60,000 to the bill. I8 (C) 
By the end of September 1960 the superstructure contractor had 
completed 54 percent of his work. The contractor was slightly behind 
schedule, but this was mainly a continuance of the earlier delays. The 
north half of the building was expected to be ready for occupancy by 
September 1961. It was almost completely enclosed, and plastering of 
the interior walls was progressing on the lower floors. Except for the 
seventh-floor roof of wings 1 and 2, and the penthouse roof, all of the 
structural slabs had been poured for the south half of the building, and 
precast concrete window panels had been installed up to the fourth-floor 
level. The structural steel covering for the cafeteria roof had been erect-
ed and installed. 
Plans were being developed with the telephone company to begin 
installing equipment for the north half of the building. Space layouts 
were being used by Agency components to plan requirements for unit-
ized furniture, location of floor outlets, and determination of the neces-
sary types of telephone service:9 Normal telephone installation was 
complicated by the additional requirements for a secure internal system 
and an intercom among the offices of the Director, the Deputy Direc-
tors, and the Office/Division Chiefs.2� 
The superstructure contract was 78 percent complete as of 31

Met with Jim Garrison and H. S. Chandler to discuss landscaping changes at the new 
building. There are three large areas in which trees are growing in a considerable de-
pression. Water collects to such an extent that drains are plugged up; consequently, 
the areas are not only unsightly but in all probability the trees are going to die before 
we move into the building. . . . It is now estimated that it will cost some $60,000 to 
rectify it, especially in view of the fact that there is not sufficient dirt available to fill 
in all three of the holes. I authorized H. S. Chandler to go ahead and negotiate to fill 
in one of them�for which we do have ample dirt�and to contemplate, at least for 
the moment, on filling in the other two if and when we construct an auxiliary build-
ing, at which time we will again have plenty of "fill" available without buying it.

drawings involving partition revisions, medical, X-ray, and projection 
equipment, and the instantaneous generator for the signal centers. The 
floorplans were retemplated from standard to unitized furniture. 
Telephone service orders and wiring diagrams were completed for 50 
percent of the north half of the building.- The building was ready for its 
first occupants. 
Moving Days Xri 
The Headquarters Building was originally scheduled to be com-
pleted by the spring of 1962, but sufficient progress had been made on 
the north half of the building to permit the first phase of the move�that 
of some DDI elements to begin on 19 September 1961. This permitted 
all components housed in Washington in the vicinity of the Theodore 
Roosevelt Bridge to be moved by 21 October. Three separate Federal 
Works Agency contracts were let to accommodate the move of CIA fur-
nishings and equipment to the new headquarters. Merchants Transfer 
and Storage Co. was awarded two, and the Roy M. Hamilton Co. of 
Cincinnati, Ohio, won the third. Xiiefj 
The planners must have breathed a collective sigh of relief once 
the DDI elements began to move into the new building. Beginning in 
1957 and continuing even after the completion of the move, the Deputy 
Director for Intelligence Robert Amory engaged the planners in a series 
of disputes over the space allocations and floorplans for the DDI area. 
Amory had legitimate grounds for objecting to the location and the lay-
out of the library, but he was less justified in his vacillating over deci-
sions to include or exclude various other DDI components in the new 
building. Amory's indecision disrupted Colonel White's equanimity. 
White noted at one point: 
21 
Had a discussion both on the squawk box and later in the day with 
Bob Amory about the new building. Bob is, in my judgment, 
somewhat irrational about his desires to close up the library deal, 
put the Office of Basic Intelligence back into the building, etc. At 
his suggestion that we thrash the whole thing out with [DCI 
Dulles] I readily agreed, at which point he backed water 
considerably. I told him that I was fed up with his threatening to

go to the Director at any time he didn't get what he wanted in con-
nection with the new building and that I wanted him to understand 
fully that I was prepared to meet with him and the Director at any 
hour of the day or night, without any advance notice, on his or any 
aspect of the building. I also told him that the DD/I area was 
slower than any other component in supplying the information 
that we needed to pass on to the architect and that unless we got 
his information very soon it would be necessary to stop work on 
the building again.n (u) 
The Construction 
Amory also complained to White�and in some cases even to DCI 
Dulles�about plans for ground floor windows, about the use of asphalt 
tile rather than more expensive flooring in the library, about the morn-
ing rush hour traffic pattern over Key Bridge, about the temperature in 
the new building, about the empty vending machines, and about the 
hours of the credit union. 23 
Other directorates had their own complaints at the time of the 
planned move to the new building. The question of adequate space for 
the Directorate of Plans (DDP�now the Directorate of Operations) 
contingent was the subject of serious discussion from 1959 until the ac-
tual move. The basic problem was to determine the actual number of 
bodies that were to be accommodated and whether or not the entire DDP 
should be moved into the new building, even at the expense of space for 
the DDI or DDS. 24 DCI Dulles and the President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board decided in June 1961 that the Directorate of Plans 
would not, in fact, be moved in its entirety to the new building. 
As components moved into their new quarters, they found that 
new unitized furniture had replaced all Class C furniture, and had been 
pre-positioned with telephones in place ready to be cut over to the new 
numbers.25 For mechanical and security reasons, certain facilities 
(principally the pneumatic tube and conveyor systems) were not 
available until the entire building was occupied. Although incinerator

unitized furnishings.

the period of interim occupancy, the material could not be burned in the 
building until later.2' 
Concurrent with the start of the move�on the night of 18 Septem-
ber 1961�the new headquarters telephone switchboard facility was put 
into service. The operators were instructed to answer incoming calls 
with "Central Intelligence Agency" instead of "Executive 3-6115." This 
change in procedure attracted attention; extensive publicity was already 
being given by the news media to the CIA relocation, and this departure 
from secrecy was grist for the journalistic mills. The previous method 
of answering calls was resumed after a few weeks. 
By 13 November 1961 the move into the north half of the building 
was completed, and by 15 May 1962 the entire move had been accom-
plished. Problems of winter weather, security escorts, communications, 
transportation, supplies and supply operations, had largely been over-
come!' Decorating and decor, including the planned sculptures for the 
main entrance area, and office and hallway colors, hangings, and the 
like, were a continuing problem.:' Heating, ventilating, and air condi-
tioning also presented problems. (u) 
Mail and courier deliveries posed special difficulties because of 
widespread confusion over the address of the new Agency building. 
"Langley" was and is the local name for a part of Fairfax County and 
has no political or corporate identity. Some mail addressed to Langley, 
particularly when posted in the Washington Metropolitan area, would 
be sent by the Postal Service to McLean, Virginia�the nearest post of-
fice. The McLean postmaster reported, however, that most "Langley 
Mail" went first to Langley Air Force Base at Hampton Roads, Virginia, 
and was then forwarded to McLean. Relocation Bulletin No. 33 correct-
ed the problem. 
The cafeteria was not completed until 28 February 1962, but in 
October 1961 necessary kitchen facilities, operated by Guest Services, 
Inc., were available to permit a limited operation in the table-service 
area. Vending machine rooms were put into operation on the floors be-
ing occupied, and the Virginia Society for the Blind was granted per-
mission to operate two snack bars. The combination of ongoing

At the time of the first move, I think the far end of the DDP part of 
the building was still partially open so that heavy equipment could 
be brought in.... As cold weather approached...the building 
became infested with the cutest collection of field mice you [will] 
ever see. In the course of serious dictation, soberminded DDI'ers 
would be interrupted by piercing shrieks [sic] from their secretar-
ies which would herald the fact that another mouse had just 
appeared. In the Historical Intelligence Collection we were con-
tinually setting mousetraps with devastating effect, including the 
fact that the Curator's extremely squeamish secretaries would not 
empty them, and that task fell on the Curator himself. Not only 
was the building open at the far end, but the cafeteria was not yet 
open, and everyone was eating out of the vending machines or 
"brown bagging it." Thus the mice had a never-ending supply of 
food. The mice also had the habit of chewing through telephone

phone wires, creating a security problem which resulted in having 
to have the mice cleared!'' 
When the move was in its initial stages, the presence of the DCI-
designate John A. McCone�who was not noted as a particularly patient 
or tactful individual�provided an added fillip for the planners and 
movers. Reportedly "very well pleased with the building" on his first 
visit to the site, he began to throw his weight around even before his 
swearing in and taking over as DCI on 29 November 1961.32 Furniture 
had to be switched; he wanted a closed circuit television link with the 
White House; he asked for comparative construction costs with the new 
Atomic Energy Commission and Department of State headquarters 
buildings; and he complained that the movers were defacing the walls.33 
The new DCI and his staff moved to the new building on the day he was 
sworn in. He occupied temporary quarters on the third floor until his 
seventh-floor suite was ready in the first week of March 1962.- (u) 
The HSLA office at the building site was closed on 2 February 
1962; the auditorium roof tile installation was finally completed during 
May 1963; and the final payment for architectural and engineering ser-
vices was made to H&A on 24 October 1963. The total construction 
time for the project, including change orders, corrections, and omis-
sions, was six years and one month, from October 1957 to November 
1963. At a total cost of about $43.7 million, the Agency had acquired a 
new, modern building with just over 1.3 million gross square feet of 
space, including some 837,000 net square feet of "office-type" space. In 
the spring of 1963, the new building housed nearly personnel, and 
at least more remained quartered in 13 other buildings in the 
Washington area.35 (C)

John A. McCone, Bud Wheelon, and the 
Wizards of Langley: 
The Creation of the DS&T and the 
Battle Over Spy Satellites (U) 
David Robarge 
CIA officers and intelligence scholars widely regard John A. 
McCone' s tenure as Director of Central Intelligence during 1961-1965 
as among the most effective in the Agency's history. His term is partic-
ularly notable for its two main achievements in science and technology: 
the creation of a directorate dedicated to those fields, and the protection 
of the CIA's role in satellite reconnaissance from takeover by the De-
fense Department. McCone's background as an engineer and manager 
of large technology, military, and energy organizations in the private 
and public sectors well suited him to reorganize the Agency's melange 
of scientific and technical offices. He believed strongly that to compete 
with an aggressive Air Force in the area of space reconnaissance, the 
CIA had to strengthen its scientific and technical capabilities. He and 
his first Deputy Director of Science and Technology (DDS&T), Albert 
Wheelon, gave the new Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T) 
the personnel, budget, and mission to assert influence inside the Agency 
and the Intelligence Community. By successfully carrying out the larg-
est rearrangement of human, financial, and material resources of his 
tenure, McCone�with Wheelon's indispensable help�went far 
toward regaining for the CIA the stature it had lost after the Bay of Pigs 
disaster. The two technically minded outsiders also initiated a change in 
the Agency's culture that diluted the influence of clandestine operators 
and Eastern-educated intellectuals and raised the profile of experts in 
esoteric disciplines who entered the secret world from outside the usual 
social and professional circles. (c)

The Seeds of the DS&T (U) 
The idea that the CIA needed a separate science and technology 
component originated with a little known but influential study group 
called the Technological Capabilities Panel (TCP), convened in 1954 
by President Dwight Eisenhower out of concern that the United States 
was vulnerable to a Soviet surprise nuclear attack. He authorized the 
president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, James R. Kil-
lian, to organize a group of experts to study the problem. One of the 
S/e t 148

1-17 
group's subcommittees, headed by Polaroid's chairman Edwin Land, 
investigated the nation's intelligence capabilities. The TCP report, enti-
tled "Meeting the Threat of Surprise Attack," declared up front that "We 
obtain little significant information from classical covert operations in-
side Russia.... We cannot hope to circumvent these elaborate [Soviet se-
curity] measures in an easy way. But we can use the ultimate in science 
and technology to improve our intelligence take." The TCP recom-
mended "adoption of a vigorous program for the extensive use, in many 
intelligence procedures, of the most advanced knowledge in science and 
technology.. .a research program producing a stream of new intelligence 
tools and techniques." Land's subcommittee encouraged construction 
of a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, a proposal that soon led to the 
development of the U-2. ' (s) 
The CIA responded to the TCP's recommendation by forming a 
Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) comprising mainly former members 
of the TCP. The board, which came to be called the Land Panel after its 
chairman, substantially influenced the Agency's scientific and technical 
activities, especially in the area of overhead reconnaissance. Adminis-
tratively, the SAB was attached to the office of the DCP s Special As-
sistant for Planning and Coordination, Richard Bissell. Bissell ran the 
Development Projects Staff and oversaw the U-2, CORONA, and OX-
CART programs. He was the CIA's point man in exploiting science and 
technology for collection purposes and got along well with the SAB.2 
Nonetheless, the Agency did not have a distinct entity to coordinate sci-
entific and technical intelligence activities that the three existing direc-
torates were pursuing independently. DC1 Allen Dulles did not act on a 
proposal made in 1957 to create a science and technology directorate�
probably because it got no support from Bissell, who wanted to keep 
tight control over his projects and opposed any such consolidation as 
long as he remained at the Agency.' (s) 
When Bissell became Deputy Director of Plans (DDP) in 1958, he 
took the Development Projects Staff with him, renamed it the Develop-
ment Projects Division, and used it�along with the Technical Services

Killian's urging, the PFIAB strongly advocated centralizing all CIA sci-
entific and technical programs in one component and separating 
scientific collection from covert operations. Bissell resisted, but his 
position grew untenable after his chief ally, DCI Dulles, was forced to 
resign in December 1961 and was replaced by John A. McCone.4 (S) 
The DCI With a Slide Rule Mind (U) 
John A. McCone was better prepared than any previous DCI to 
lead the Agency fully into the realm of science and technology because 
he had experience managing large engineering and transportation enter-
prises and US military and energy bureaucracies. President John 
Kennedy chose McCone, a wealthy Republican from California, to be 
DCI because of his reputation as a decisive executive who could control 
farflung organizations, and his connections to the GOP that would help 
protect the CIA from attacks by the Administration's critics in 
Congress. McCone had graduated from the University of California's 
College of Engineering in 1922. Classmates regarded him as hard-
working and humorless; one of them described him as "a man with a 
slide-rule mind." After working for the next 15 years in the steel indus-
try, he and fellow California graduate Stephen Bechtel formed the engi-
neering firm Bechtel-McCone and designed and built factories, 
refineries, and power plants. Astute investments in shipbuilding, lucra-
tive war contracts, and hard-driving management made McCone a mil-
lionaire by 1945, and as of the late 1940s, he was one of the world's 
premiere shipping magnates.' (U) 
Nonetheless, McCone found himself, in his own words, "a little 
restless" and increasingly attracted to government work�particularly 
involving national security and technology. In 1947 he accepted an in-
vitation to serve on the presidential Air Policy Commission, charged 
with devising ways to revive the moribund postwar aircraft industry. 
McCone wrote the military recommendations in the Commission's re-
port, published in January 1948 with the attention-grabbing title

"Survival in the Air Age." He suggested that American aviation scrap 
the piston engine and convert to jet propulsion, and that the United 
States start stockpiling nuclear weapons.6 (u) 
McCone's brief tenure as Under Secretary of the Air Force (1950-
51) helped him learn how to run a public organization, but the bureau-
cratic controversy and personal tension he engendered demonstrated the 
limits of his brusque leadership style. His dealings as a defense contrac-
tor during World War II enabled him to exert some control over the Air 
Force's byzantine procurement system and public works budget. He 
pushed for intensive research and development in missiles and wanted 
to reorganize the armed services' separate missile programs according 
to a Manhattan Project model under the direction of a "missile czar." 
McCone overreached with this proposal, however; interservice rivalries 
precluded it, and President Truman rejected it. Moreover, McCone, who 
saw his primary role as the Air Force Secretary's general manager, ran-
kled Air Force officials and commanders when he tried to employ the 
same strict administrative techniques he used to run his own companies. 
According to one assistant secretary, McCone was guilty of "throwing 
his weight around," and a senior member of the Air Staff regarded him 
as a "know-it-all" who treated high-ranking officers with contempt. 
McCone returned to the private sector after less than a year-and-a-half, 
ostensibly for personal reasons. Presumably he took with him some les-
sons about how, and how not, to shake up a federal bureaucracy.' (U) 
McCone's technical background and conservative Republican 
credentials recommended him to the Eisenhower Administration for the 
post of Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), vacated by 
the controversial Lewis Strauss in early 1958. Strauss had battled con-
tinually with New Deal Democrats in Congress over issues ranging 
from public development of nuclear energy to a nuclear test ban. The 
Administration saw McCone as a strong-willed pacificator who would 
espouse the GOP's pro-business policies without antagonizing congres-
sional Democrats. Like Strauss, McCone preferred that the private 
sector take the lead in developing nuclear power, but he was not as doc-
trinaire or pugnacious as his predecessor. He viewed the Commission's 
business largely in technical and economic terms, sought ideas from 
many sources, and successfully avoided most of the political and per-
sonal controversies that marked Strauss's tenure. According to the de-
finitive study of the AEC during the 1950s, McCone "made significant

strides in in bringing systematic evaluation and planning to bear on the 
Commission's amorphous and inflated programs." He also directed the 
AEC's scientists to conduct applied research that advanced the Com-
mission's objectives instead of investigating pet ideas and projects. The 
AEC study notes that: 
lais an engineer, McCone tended to take a jaundiced view of sci-
entists...he understood the indispensable role that scientists 
played in establishing the base for technological innovation, but 
he did not quite accept the idea that turning scientists loose in the 
laboratory to pursue their own interests in basic research was 
always a good investment for the federal government.' (u) 
McCone's attitude would prove useful in ensuring that the CIA di-
rected its scientific and technical efforts toward intelligence collection 
and operational support. By the time he became DCI, traditional forms 
of intelligence collection�covert agents and clandestine operations�
were losing their primacy to technical means. The CIA's achievements 
with the U-2 and CORONA in targeting the Soviet Union and Cuba 
demonstrated the value of technical collection and underscored the lim-
itations of HUMINT. McCone knew little about espionage and counter-
intelligence, doubted the efficacy of covert action, and delegated more 
responsibility to his deputies in those areas than in any others. In con-
trast, he regarded technical systems as more vital to the Agency's mis-
sion and set out to overhaul the CIA' s scientific and technical programs, 
which he regarded as inefficiently organized and suffering from poor 
management by Agency leaders captivated by clandestine operations. 
His preference for technical intelligence fit neatly with the White 
House's predisposition after the Cuban missile crisis to trust "hard in-
telligence," such as photographs and signals intelligence, more than hu-
man sources and experts' assessments.9 (u)

changes at Langley. As an outsider taking over at a time of leadership 
disarray and low morale, however, he had to act with due deliberation. 
Land and Killian could remain above the fray, expressing dissatisfac-
tion at the pace with which McCone implemented their ex cathedra 
recommendations, but the DCI knew he had to move cautiously to pre-
serve his authority. (s) 
McCone found the CIA' s scientific and technological operations 
scattered among several offices. The reconnaissance program was in the 
Directorate of Plans (DDP) under the Development Projects Division 
(DPD). The Technical Services Division (TSD), 
 was also part  of the DDP, as was 
 The Office of Scien-
tific Intelligence (OS I) in the Directorate of Intelligence (DDI) analyzed 
foreign research. Under McCone' s original conception, a new director-
ate for scientific research would pull together all of these components 
in one place where the Agency's technical talent could exchange ideas 
and information, interact with private industry and other government 
agencies, and serve as a large organizational "magnet" to attract highly 
qualified personnel to careers in technical intelligence." (S) 
In one of his first meetings with the PFIAB, McCone heard Killian 
and Land strongly express their concern that continued association with 
the DDP would harm the CIA's scientific and technical development 
programs. After this meeting, McCone set up the Working Group on 
Organization and Activities, chaired by Inspector General Lyman Kirk-
patrick, to review the Agency's structure and activities. The Working 
Group gave special attention to the idea of setting up a new directorate 
of research and development. The DCI asked all deputy directors to 
comment on the idea. Bissell vehemently opposed it. Among other  
points, he argued that

1961, had asked Bissell to delay resigning�indicating that the new DCI 
needed the veteran DDP's judgment and influence. 12 (S) 
McCone soon decided to stay on, however, and in late January�
unconvinced and undaunted by Bissell's dissent�he told PFIAB that 
he intended to appoint a new deputy director to supervise technical col-
lection and consolidate CIA's scientific activities. Bissell sent the DCI 
additional objections in early February that, along with those he had 
raised earlier, presaged the internal opposition McCone would soon 
face. The DDP now criticized the proposed movement of the OSI and 
the National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) from the DDI 
to the new directorate. He also contended that activities that appropri-
ately could be taken from the DDP and DDI�aerial and space recon-
naissance�could be assigned to a special assistant and did not require 
the attention of a deputy director. Responding to McCone's earlier re-
quest that he run the new directorate, Bissell now said that accepting the 
offer "would mean a long step backward," and he resigned from CIA in 
mid-February. '3 (S) 
On 16 February, McCone issued a Headquarters Notice creating 
the Directorate of Research (DDR), effective on the 19th. He appointed 
Herbert "Pete" Scoville, then Assistant Director of the OSI, as the first 
Deputy Director for Research. Before joining CIA in 1955, Scoville had 
been a senior scientist at Los Alamos and technical director of the 
Armed Forces Special Weapons Project; colleagues considered him one 
of the nation's leading experts on warheads. He lacked Bissell's force-
ful character and bureaucratic clout, however, and soon found himself 
in the middle of an organizational conflict without the means or support 
to wage it effectively.'4 (s) 
McCone' s 16 February notice stated "other activities in Research 
and Development will be placed under DD/R as appropriate." What "as 
appropriate" meant soon became apparent when Scoville circulated a 
draft proposal describing the responsibilities and structure of the new 
directorate. He recommended placing three types of activity in the 
DDR: research and development on technical collection and data reduc-
tion systems, production of intelligence on foreign scientific and tech-
nical capabilities, and operations that used either technical collection

Scoville specifically wanted the DDR to take over the Special Projects 
Branch of the DDP's Development Projects Division; the research, 
development, and laboratory component of the DDP's Technical Ser-
vices Division; the DDI's Office of Scientific Intelligence; all ELINT 
activities; and the Office of Communication's research and develop-
ment work on COMINT and agent communications.'s (S) 
McCone's notice establishing the DDR and Scoville's proposed 
restructuring evoked such intense reactions from several senior Agency 
managers that the DCI had to curtail the pace and scope of his plan. The 
most vigorous resistance came from DDI Robert Amory and his succes-
sor, Ray Cline. They opposed the transfer of the OSI, maintaining that 
jurisdiction for intelligence assessments of foreign countries�particu-
larly the Soviet Union�should not be subdivided, and that another of-
fice would have to be created to replace the OSI' s intelligence 
production and contributions to estimates. Cline, well known for his 
bluntness, contended later that McCone wanted to put the OSI in the 
DDR "to give some warm bodies and an appearance of bulk to the Di-
rectorate," and that because of the shift, "CIA advocacy of its own sci-
entific collection techniques became mixed up with its objective 
analysis of all scientific and technical developments. The appearance of 
objectivity was hard to maintain when analysis and collection were su-
pervised by the same staff." After the reorganization went into effect, 
Cline fought what he called a "rearguard action" to regain the OSI' s an-
alytic function. Kirkpatrick's Working Group also weighed in on the is-
sue in its report in early April, recommending that the DDI keep the OSI 
but give up NPIC to the new directorate. IS (s) 
McCone's new DDP, Richard Helms�known in the Agency as a 
calculating intellicrat apparently saw early compromise as the best 
tactic. He agreed to relinquish elements of the TSD 
but fought tenaciously to retain those that 
did. Helms may have figured that McCone contrary to the Kirkpatrick

Group's recommendation that the DDR be given some operational re-
sponsibilities�would defer to his judgment on this issue as on others 
related to clandestine activities. � (S) 
After three months of high-level opposition, Lyman Kirkpatrick, 
the new Executive Director, recommended to McCone that he accept 
less than a full measure of success. Kirkpatrick had spent several 
fruitless weeks working with Scoville on a draft Headquarters Notice 
setting forth the DDR's terms of reference. In the face of the Amory-
Cline-Helms resistance, the Executive Director concluded that it was 
"preferable to allow the DD/R to grow by evolution and accretion rather 
than any drastic surgery on either DD/I or DD/P." Kirkpatrick's group 
regarded OXCART, the projected successor to the U-2, as the DDR's 
most important project and warned that the new directorate "must be re-
strained from taking on collateral activities so fast that OXCART will 
suffer." (S) 
A few more weeks of piecemeal progress followed. McCone ap-
proved personnel allocations for the DDR staff and the appointment of 
an Assistant Director, Col. Edward B. Giller. Giller was trained as an 
engineer, worked on Air Force weapons projects in the 1950s, and most 
recently was deputy chief of TSD. McCone and Scoville may have se-
lected Giller�his qualifications notwithstanding�as a way to placate 
the DDP.'9 (S) 
By this time, the DCI and the DDR wanted to get the new director-
ate up and running and deferred action on unresolved issues. McCone 
later wrote that forcing the DDI and DDP to turn over the OSI and TSD, 
respectively, "would incur great risk of impairing the [directorates'] fun-
damental missions." The long-awaited Headquarters Notice describing 
the DDR' s mission and responsibilities came out in late July. The DDR 
would have authority over scientific and technical research and develop-
ment that supported intelligence collection, but the DDP 
The DDR would provide overall guidance of ELINT activities but would 
not delve into related operational matters. Three new components were

created: the Offices of Research and Development (ORD), Electronic 
Collection (OEL), and Special Activities (OSA).2� (S) 
McCone' s actions during the DDR' s several months of gestation 
typified an important element of his leadership style. According to his 
executive assistant, Walter Elder, McCone was much less interested in 
the formal structure of the Agency than in the results it produced. As in 
most of his prior management positions, he was content to lay down 
general guidelines at the outset and leave administrative details�
especially jurisdictional conflicts�to others. McCone regarded this de-
tachment as consistent with his successful approach to running his 
sprawling corporate enterprises and more appropriate to his function as 
DCI. As an industrialist, he operated more in the manner of a chairman 
of the board than a chief executive officer, delegating administration to 
handpicked subordinates, and he adopted the same approach as DCI. He 
took his responsibilities as head of the Intelligence Community very se-
riously and made sure soon after his appointment that President 
Kennedy explicitly gave him all the authority he thought he needed to 
be a true coordinator of national intelligence. According to an informal 
time study conducted after he took office, McCone spent 80 percent of 
his workday on Intelligence Community matters and only 20 percent on 
subjects specific to the CIA. Consequently, he did not believe he should 
involve himself in day-to-day administration of the Agency, including 
the implementation of the DDR directive. Instead, as he told 
Kirkpatrick, one of his management objectives was "assigning respon-
sibilities and then insisting that subordinates measure up."2 (s) 
McCone was willing to take bureaucratic risks, but in a way that 
helped contain potential damage. Creating the DDR inevitably would 
be controversial because, as Elder later put it, "you could do it only by 
carving it out of the flesh and blood of existing components."22 By del-
egating turf battles to his DDCI, Gen. Marshall Carter, and Kirkpatrick, 
McCone gave the new directorate's critics, such as Cline and Helms, 
opportunities to obstruct implementation and mobilize allies. However,

placed on the concept and the clamor it raised, the notice was issued under DDCI Mar-
shall Carter's signature, not McCone's. The DCI probably was busy preparing for his 
upcoming wedding. (s)

the DCI�belying his reputation as a brusque, heavy-handed boss�ap-
pears in this case to have concluded that a major organizational change 
could best be achieved by letting bureaucratic politics and tempers run 
their course instead of imposing the new arrangement by fiat. McCone 
took a more guarded approach than in the management shuffle he quick-
ly carried out during his first hundred days because far more serious and 
extensive equities now were at stake. (s) 
Disarray, Distractions, and Disputes (U) 
The new arrangement that McCone's deputies had worked out 
soon proved unsatisfactory. Even with its more limited mandate, the 
DDR as approved by McCone in July 1962 "never had a fighting 
chance," a former CIA historian and DS&T officer has concluded. 
"Pete Scoville's writ ran long on the tasks his new directorate was sup-
posed to accomplish and short on the manpower needed to achieve such 
goals." Besides some officers in the OSA, which took responsibility for 
the old DPD' s reconnaissance projects, most of the Agency's scientific 
and technical talent remained in the OSI. In addition, delays in securing 
enough space in the new Headquarters Building, transferring personnel 
from other components, and setting up a new career service with a 
special pay structure made the DDR seem like an organizational step-
child.23 (s) 
Difficult, high-profile technical intelligence problems that arose 
during the DDR's first months diverted McCone's and Scoville's time 
and attention from building the new directorate. Most important was the 
discovery of Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba in October 1962. The 
DCI, the DDR, and the ADDR�along with NPIC director Arthur Lun-
dahl�were the primary Agency participants in numerous briefings and 
discussions with the Kennedy Administration on the fast-breaking cri-
sis. A less well-known distraction was determining whether a newly 
discovered Soviet missile installation near Tallinn, Estonia was intend-
ed to shoot down aircraft or missiles.24 (s)

Moreover, throughout late 1962 and early 1963 McCone and

of the recently created National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the 
nature of the satellite reconnaissance program. The high-level, informal

with Under Secretary Joseph Charyk�that had existed during the first 
years of the CORONA program ended with the establishment of the 
NRO in September 1961 and the leadership changes at the CIA soon 
after. The departure of Bissell, then-DDCI Charles Cabe11, and other 
senior CIA officers removed the Agency's top representatives in the re-
connaissance area. Combined with the CIA's low prestige after the Bay 
of Pigs, this situation gave the Air Force�which provided most re-
sources for the satellite program�a chance to seize the NRO and direct 
space reconnaissance toward tactical military uses. McCone, however, 
saw the NRO as a national strategic asset, not just as a military tool, and 
he resolved to keep the CIA's hand in developing, tasking, and manag-
ing reconnaissance satellites and assessing their intelligence take. DDI 
Ray Cline recalls that "only a few people really understood what [satel-
lite collection' was all about, but [McCone] understood it. He never lost 
sight of it." Scoville, unaware of the personal involvement Bissell had 
enjoyed with the Air Force, delegated Agency representation to depu-
ties who found themselves outmatched by their uniformed counterparts. 
In the short term, the development of the new directorate and Scoville' s 
standing with McCone suffered from this steadily escalating conflict 
with the Defense Department." (S) 
High-level Frustrations (u) 
By late 1962 the halting development of the DDR and Scoville's 
ineffectiveness plainly displeased McCone. He thought that the CIA's 
entire scientific effort was unimaginative and sluggish, and that Scov-
ille was too passive in projecting the Agency's viewpoint in the Intelli-
gence Community. He thought, for example, that the DDR' s diffidence

caused the White House to assign responsibility for evaluating Soviet 
nuclear tests to an outside group of experts, the Bethe Panel, instead of 
to Agency officers. The DDP' s and DDI' s footdragging over the reor-
ganization also annoyed McCone, and he complained that the two dep-
uty directors never raised scientific matters with him. He later said he 
had told Helms and Cline: 
If you would only come in and talk to me just once about science 
I'd feel better about [the] scientific end of your business. But you 
come in and talk to me about clandestine operations, and about 
reports, and about studies, and about every other damn thing, but 
you never come in and talk to me about science.... Ray [Cline] 
will sit up all night and talk about history, but he won't talk about 
[science]. 
For his part, Scoville was frustrated at what he regarded as McCone's 
lack of support, and he was weary of all the turf battles. Some DDR staff 
members considered Scoville "too gentlemanly" to be assertive in his 
Agency and Intelligence Community roles, but he believed that 
McCone had undercut his position by failing to resolve the feud with the 
Air Force over the NRO. The DDR thought that he could not simulta-
neously represent the CIA's interests in governmentwide programs and 
administer its own scientific and technical activities without the full 
backing of the Agency's top managers, especially the DCI.26 (s) 
Killian and Land of the PFIAB were not satisfied with the DDR ei-
ther and raised their concerns with McCone in January 1963. The DCI 
explained that under current circumstances, the massive organization 
Killian had in mind could not be brought about "unless by direct order 
from me against the objections from [DDCI] General Carter and virtual-
ly the entire organization within CIA." Two months later, the PFIAB is-
sued a paper, "Recommendations on Technical Capabilities," which 
criticized the Intelligence Community for inadequately exploiting sci-
ence and technology. Two of the board's many detailed proposals related 
directly to the new directorate's shortcomings. Establishing "an admin-
istrative arrangement in the CIA whereby the whole spectrum of modern 
science and technology can be brought into contact with major programs 
and projects of the Agency," would remedy "present fragmentation and

compartmentation." The board also called for "clear vesting of these 
broadened responsibilities in the top technical official of the CIA, oper-
ating at the level of Deputy Director." In effect, Killian and Land were 
telling McCone how to overhaul the Agency's scientific and technical 
efforts. In April McCone responded to the PFIAB report through Presi-
dent Kennedy's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, Mc-
George Bundy. He could only make some general claims of progress but 
declared that the "period of observation" of internal reaction "has now 
lapsed," and that he would "move ahead with additional changes" that in-
cluded giving the DDR "expanded responsibilities."27 (S) 
Ten days after McCone replied to the PFIAB, Scoville resigned. At 
the time he cited the other deputy directors' intransigence and the DCI' s 
indecisiveness. Years later, Scoville added that he left because McCone 
held him responsible for the performance of scientific and technical 
components over which he had no authority. "McCone would go around 
town saying I was responsible for all scientific activity in the Agency, 
and yet he refused to transfer to me the biggest scientific group, my old 
group of people with whom I had worked [the �Si]." The DDR asked 
that his resignation take effect 1 June (later extended to the 14th).28 (s) 
McCone's New Chief Wizard (U) 
McCone earlier had said he did not care who ran the DDR as long 
as it was organized and managed properly, and after Scoville's resigna-
tion he moved to ensure that it was by asking Albert Wheelon, the acting 
director of the OSI, to take charge of it. Wheelon, a technical wunder-
kind who earned a doctorate in physics from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology at age 23, had worked as a space reconnaissance design 
engineer at TRW and as a consultant to US Government scientific 
boards before joining the Agency as the OSI' s deputy director in June 
1962. He had impressed the Agency's leadership with briefings on the 
nuclear test ban negotiations that he gave at morning staff meetings.

Albert Wheelon (t) 
Wheelon told McCone that "we shouldn't screw a good light bulb into 
a burned out socket"�i.e., he was not interested unless the directorate 
controlled all of the CIA's scientific and technical efforts�and made 
several demands before he would agree to serve. He did not want the 
DDR to be a staff component, like the research and engineering compo-
nent of the Defense Department, but "a real honest-to-God line organi-
zation to carry out assigned responsibilities." He insisted on bringing 
the OSI with him, wanted full authority over research and development, 
and asked for a computer center and a missile intelligence center. 
Wheelon may have believed that he could drive a hard bargain because

the DCI' s aide, Walter Elder, had already assured him that McCone 
would back him against the other deputy directors.29(s) 
McCone saw "great advantages" in Wheelon' s general plan, which 
fit his own preference for centralizing Agency scientific and technical 
functions, but also "dangers...unless Cline, Helms, and [Deputy Direc-
tor for Support Lawrence K.] White are all aboard 100%." The DCI 
again left the details and negotiations to the DDCI and the Executive 
Director�Cline once more proved the most implacable�but by the end 
of July an agreement was ready. Wheelon got most of what he initially 
wanted, and a few other things besides. At his insistence the DDR would 
be renamed the Directorate of Science and Technology, and the 
PFIAB ' s March 1963 recommendations would constitute its charter of 
operation. The reorganization went into effect on 5 August.3� (s) 
In Wheelon, McCone had the hard-driving, steely infighter he 
needed to make the new directorate work. Wheelon saw officials in the 
Intelligence Community either as colleagues with whom he could coop-
erate or as adversaries against whom he must compete, and during his 
rapid ascent through academe and the defense industry he had rarely ex-
perienced defeat. He consistently outmaneuvered his Agency rivals in 
internal empire building. One colleague recalled that "When you take 
on Bud Wheelon, you're taking on a bureaucratic master, and Bud 
Wheelon ripped Ray [Cline] to shreds" in the dispute over the OSI. 
Agency veterans viewed Wheelon as an upstart outsider, but he did not 
seem to care. Before he joined the Agency, he told McCone and Kirk-
patrick that he did not plan to make a career at Langley and was not 
bothered at the prospect of antagonizing colleagues at the Agency and 
in the Intelligence Community. McCone, perhaps seeing some of his 
own traits reflected in his assertive new deputy director, must have 
judged that Wheelon's determination and intelligence outweighed his 
faults and helped the intelligence process produce the results that he and 
policymakers demanded always the DCI' s ultimate test of how well 
programs or personnel worked. Wheelon, in turn, thought McCone had

"the finest analytical mind I had ever seen" and regarded him less as a 
manager than as "an extraordinarily intelligent entrepreneur, accus-
tomed to changing course rapidly as events and opportunities presented 
themselves."" (s) 
Wheelon achieved several of McCone's goals during nearly two 
years of service under him (McCone resigned in April 1965). Using the 
DS&T's expanded charter and special pay scale, Wheelon fashioned 
what possibly was the nation's most powerful development and 
engineering establishment, which by the end of the decade would de-
sign, build, and deploy technical collection systems that gave the United 
States a substantial intelligence advantage over its adversaries. During 
his first year, Wheelon integrated the DDI's OSI and the DDS's Office 
of Computer Support into his directorate; established a missile and 
space analysis center over the vituperative opposition of powerful Air 
Force commanders, including Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay; recruited 
senior personnel, mostly from industry; acquired sufficient space and 
budget during a period of fiscal stringency; organized a network of sci-
entific boards and panels; and produced a new internal publication on 
current scientific intelligence, the Daily Surveyor. By 1964 the DS&T 
comprised six offices: Computer Services, ELINT (renamed SIGINT 
Operations in 1978), Research and Development, Special Activities (re-
named Development and Engineering in 1973), Scientific Intelligence, 
and the Foreign Missile and Space Analysis Center. (The two principal 
scientific and technical components still not included within the direc-
torate were the DDP's TSD and the DDI's NPIC.) DS&T personnel re-
spected Wheelon's brilliance, drive, and watchful oversight, but his 
demanding and sometimes harsh management and zealous protection of 
directorate prerogatives alienated many subordinates, officers else-
where in the Agency (especially in the DDI), and other Intelligence 
Community components. McCone supported Wheelon' s ends (in the 
same position he probably would have used most of the same means), 
backed his DDS&T in most internal disputes, and favorably represented 
Wheelon's accomplishments to the PFIAB.32 (s)

The creation of the Foreign Missile and Space Analysis Center 
(FMSAC) exemplifies McCone's resolute way of getting what he want-
ed. He was dissatisfied with the Intelligence Community's analysis of 
foreign missile and space activity and in late 1962 discussed forming a 
joint intelligence center with the Defense Department. The DCI partic-
ularly was irked because he first learned of a Soviet space event from a 
wire service, not Agency intelligence sources. The Pentagon raised 
jurisdictional objections, so after a few months McCone told Defense 
officials that the CIA would establish its own all-source analysis facility 
that would serve as a national component and not duplicate any other 
organization's activities. The FMSAC came into existence on 7 Novem-
ber 1963 under the direction of Carl Duckett, who came to the Agency 
from the Army's Redstone Arsenal. Not to be outdone, the DOD estab-
lished the Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center in April 
1964, but McCone spurned McNamara' s suggestion that the two agen-
cies form a joint committee. By the following March, FMSAC operated 
24 hours a day, and in 1965 it was elevated to Office status." (s) 
Fight for the Sky Spies (U) 
McCone, with Wheelon's assistance, turned back the Air Force's 
attempt to take over space reconnaissance for tactical intelligence pur-
poses. According to Walter Elder, no issue besides Cuba and Vietnam 
occupied more of McCone' s time as DCI than the protracted dispute 
over managing the National Reconnaissance Program (NRP) and the 
National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). McCone regarded the CIA-Air 
Force conflict as one of the low points of his tenure as DCI; he once de-
scribed the bureaucratic row as "confusing... and absolutely disgust-
ing." McCone and Wheelon hewed to the principle that overhead 
reconnaissance is the responsibility of the DCI in the discharge of his 
statutory duties. Moreover, they believed the fate of satellite reconnais-
sance�widely viewed then as the future foundation of US intelligence 
collection�was at stake, and they were determined to overcome what 
McCone termed the Air Force's "almost unbelievable phobia over [its] 
position in space." The DCI was well-versed in the engineering areana 
of the NRP, such as camera apertures and booster rocket thrust, and

Wizards of Langley 
sought to enhance the program's technical accomplishments as well as 
its organizational protocols.34 (s) 
By the time McCone became DCI, the Air Force was developing 
its own reconnaissance satellite, the SAMOS, and working to establish 
itself as the primary player in the field.35 From its perspective, the Air 
Force saw much more at stake in the NRO controversy than control of 
a single program: it was fighting for an essential primary mission. The 
manned bomber was losing its importance in the age of intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion had been assigned at least a coequal role in space. The Air Force 
was reluctant to have satellite reconnaissance taken away from it, 
especially by a civilian agency, and feared losing the ability to use sat-
ellites to gather targeting intelligence for its strategic bombers. As Mc-
Cone later observed, "the Air Force, having suffered from being 
removed from any space activities except military [ones]...had to scoop 
up everything they could.. .and one of the things was to become a single 
instrument in this [overhead reconnaissance] field."35 (s) 
McCone's limited authority over the Intelligence Community 
complicated the Agency's standing. McCone did not have the final say 
over all intelligence matters, notwithstanding the power he believed 
President Kennedy had given him in early 1962. He shared responsibil-
ity for space reconnaissance with the Defense Department. Under the 
first NRP agreement in 1961, the Under Secretary of the Air Force and 
the DDP jointly managed the program�an arrangement that Bissell's

" The Air Force's mission-building carried over from satellites into aircraft reconnais-
sance. Arguing that the CIA's cover for the U-2 Cuban overflight program was weak, it 
succeeded in taking over the flights in the days before the Cuban missile crisis. McCone 
kept CIA control of overflights of other denied areas. In late 1962 and early 1963, the 
Air Force pressed for surfacing a fighter version of the OXCART. At first the Agency 
believed doing so would compromise its own reconnaissance version, but by early 1963 
McCone had come to accept the Air force's arguments. Pedlow and Welzenbach, CIA

departure in early 1962 rendered moot. In May 1962, McCone and Dep-
uty Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric, who had known each other 
since McCone's stint at the Pentagon over a decade earlier, signed a sec-
ond NRP agreement that more clearly enumerated the responsibilities of 
the NRO and established a single NRO director (DNRO) to be appoint-
ed by the Secretary of Defense and the DCI. McCone regarded Under 
Secretary of the Air Force Joseph Charyk as "unusually capable" and 
consented to have him as the first DNRO, but he was reluctant to let any 
successors come from the Defense Department. In exchange, McCone 
demanded assurances that the CIA would continue to control research, 
development, contracting, and targeting of the satellites. The new 
agreement did not provide for a deputy director, which McCone appar-
ently thought would create a superfluous layer of management. Without 
that position, however, the CIA had no senior representative at the 
NRO. At first the Agency's position in the NRP seemed secure because 
of its successes with the U-2, CORONA, and OXCART, but the DCI 
soon recognized that the program's center of gravity was shifting to-
ward the Pentagon. McCone suggested to McNamara that the only way 
to end the dispute was to remove the NRO from the purview of the 
Under Secretary of the Air Force and put it under either the Deputy Sec-
retary of Defense for Research and Engineering or a new Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Intelligence. McNamara responded positively, but 
nothing came of McCone' s ideas at that time.37 (s) 
After DNRO Charyk set up several programs that appeared to lim-
it the CIA, McCone and Wheelon questioned the ability of the Air Force 
and the NRO to run satellite reconnaissance. They pointed out that the 
Air Force was responsible for most launch mishaps in the CORONA 
program and had failed to develop the SAMOS. McCone accused Mc-
Namara and Gilpatric of being "entirely preoccupied" with defending 
weapons systems on Capitol Hill instead of managing the complex 
space intelligence program.35 Longstanding animosity between

Wizards of Langley 
Wheelon and Brockway McMillan, Charyk's successor as Under Sec-
retary of the Air Force and DNRO, further roiled the waters. McMillan 
came to the Pentagon in March 1963 from Bell Telephone Laboratories 
determined to break the CIA's hold on designing and procuring satel-
lites; ultimately, he wanted to take over all management of space recon-
naissance. He proceeded to undercut DDR Herbert Scoville, with whom 
he had served on Killian's Technological Capabilities Panel in the mid-
1950s, and then took on Wheelon after the embittered Scoville left. 
McMillan and Wheelon�both smart, strong-willed, prideful, and am-
bitious�let an old disagreement about a technical subject grow into a 
personal feud that distorted their perspective on the bureaucratic contro-
versy. Richard Bissell recalled Wheelon' s conflict with McMillan and 
the Air Force: 
Bud Wheelon, essentially, was battling to maintain the [A]gency's 
influence in the reconnaissance programs, and also to have the 
[Algeney designated by the NRO as the procurement agency for a 
lot of the payloads. The Air Force was battling for the exact oppo-
site. They wanted to do as much as possible of the procurement 
and have as much influence as possible on the technical decisions 
and operational matters. And that was really the essence of Bud's 
continuing battles. What kind of programs will receive what kind 
of funding? Who will be the procurement agency for this or that? 
And [the battles] went on, and on, and on....39 (s) 
McCone's relationship with McMillan became just as acrimoni-
ous as Wheelon's and hampered implementation of the third NRP 
agreement that McCone and Gilpatric had signed in March 1963. That 
accord established a deputy director position (with the expectation that 
a CIA officer would fill the slot)40 and gave both the DCI and Secretary 
of Defense responsibility for managing the NRO, with the latter having

ened�Elder recalled the DCI accusing the DNRO of "lying.. .deceit 
and fraud"�and caused disabling conflicts over contracting, funding, 
and delegating tasks. McCone chastised McMillan for being too obedi-
ent to the Defense Department, turning the program into a "handmaid-
en" of the Air Force, failing to include CIA in decisionmaking, and 
giving priority to development projects over intelligence collection. He 
asserted that McMillan could not properly manage the NRO while serv-
ing simultaneously as Air Force Under Secretary and called one of the 
DNRO' s management proposals "damned foolishness." After months 
of futile infighting, McCone complained to the Deputy Secretary of 
Defense for Research and Engineering, Eugene Fubini, that: 
I never knew the first damn thing that's going on. I have yet to see

at all as I anticipated in any respect and as near as I can see the 
whole thing is moving ever and ever closer and closer into becom-
ing an instrument of the Air Force. 
McCone threatened to see Defense Secretary McNamara and the Presi-
dent about getting McMillan removed unless matters changed to his

The situation appeared to improve in January 1964 when McCone 
agreed to Fubini's compromise proposal, under which CIA would have 
responsibility for research, development, engineering, and early flights 
of new reconnaissance payloads and then would turn over their opera-
tion to the Air Force. The DCI and the Secretary of Defense (through 
the DNRO) would share authority over the satellite program. It was 
soon evident, however, that the agreement was failing, largely because 
personal rancor kept the principals apart. McMillan and Wheelon con-
tinued to blame each other for communication lapses. McCone lost his 
temper in a phone conversation with Fubini, saying he was "just about

ready to tell the Secretary of Defense and the President [that] they can 
take NRO and shove it.. my patience is gone!" In a contentious meeting 
with the DNRO, McCone called McMillan's failure to include Agency 
officers in his investigation of recent CORONA failures "criminal" and 
said the DNRO was "just grabbing for power.. .you don't want to work 
with people�all you want to do is say, 'Give it to me and the hell with 
you.'" 42 (s) 
The PFIAB weighed into the controversy with an investigation, 
begun in March 1964 and completed the following June. McCone usu-
ally regarded the board's monitoring activities as a nuisance, and, much 
to his consternation, it did not reach the conclusions he had wanted.43 
Although the board acknowledged the need for the DCI to have a voice 
in NRO matters, it recommended that the Air Force receive substantial-
ly greater authority�relegating the DCI' s role "maybe to be advised 
about something someplace along the line," as McCone deprecatingly 
put it. He thought that implementing PFIAB' s conclusions would re-
duce the space reconnaissance program to "a single instrument resting 
with the Air Force." He countered with his own set of recommenda-
tions, assigning program decisions and the allocation of responsibility 
to the DCI and Secretary of Defense, and placing the DNRO organiza-
tionally under the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In June and July 
McCone discussed his ideas with Bundy, McNamara, and the Deputy 
Secretary of Defense, Cyrus Vance. They all supported his general po-
sition, but the latter two had reservations about the potential bureaucrat-
ic and political fallout of his proposals:" (S)

Despite the policy-level concord on the need for change, nothing 
had improved by mid-1964. The CIA and the NRO�the latter echoing 
the Air Force's position�still differed fundamentally on the purpose of 
satellite reconnaissance. McCone and Wheelon were concerned with 
collecting strategic intelligence and husbanding the intelligence budget, 
so they stressed lower cost, lower resolution systems. The DCI told the 
DNRO that "left in the hands of the Air Force, [the space reconnais-
sance program] would not be taking a picture of the Soviet Union to-
day." McMillan and Fubini, less worried about funding and focused on 
the military's tactical mission, argued for more expensive, higher reso-
lution satellites. They saw Wheelon's entry into developmental engi-
neering a field the Air Force had hitherto considered its own�as 
especially threatening, and so McMillan tried even harder to limit CIA 
involvement in space reconnaissance. The DCI became especially ran-
kled when he learned that the DNRO had obligated funds to meet the 
military's requirements without discussing the matter with him. To 
Land, he vented his frustration over his lack of authority to resolve these 
wearisome bureaucratic battles: 
Hell! I was the Director of the Standard Oil of California and we 
had no problems of this type with that company. I was also Direc-
tor of Caltex, which is owned jointly by the Standard Oil of Cali-
fornia and the Texas Company, and there the Directors spent all 
their time on allocating responsibilities: who's going to be respon-
sible for the sales in France.... Who's going to be responsible for 
the next group of tankers? [Now] I can tell you in the six compa-
nies when we built the Boulder Dam, this is what we had to do: 
who is going to be responsible for the gravel plant, is it going to 
be Kaiser, is it going to be Shay? This is the kind of thing that the 
Directors of the six companies had to deal with. Wherever you've 
got an integrated company you don't have that problem. Manage-
ment can handle the problem." (s) 
McCone finally ran out of patience in late June 1964 when Mc-
Millan told him that he wanted to transfer CORONA' s systems engi-
neering contract from Lockheed to an NRO-managed research center

called Aerospace. Claiming he was through trying to work with Fubini 
and McMillan, the DCI went to McNamara and Vance to plead his case. 
He charged that the DNRO ignored intelligence considerations, did not 
communicate with the Agency or use the DDNRO meaningfully, 
"lacked integrity," and exhibited "an element of dishonesty [that] made 
him totally unsatisfactory." McNamara conceded that the DNRO' s be-
havior was "indefensible," and at last agreed to McCone's recommen-
dation to take NRO out of the Air Force and make it a coordinating 
rather than a line organization. He told McCone, however, that he would 
do nothing until after the November elections. Meanwhile, McMillan 
temporarily backed down, suspending the transfer of the Lockheed con-
tract.46 (S) 
Shortly afterward, in a last-ditch attempt to make the current ar-
rangement work, McCone, Vance, Fubini, McMillan, and DDCI Carter 
began meeting weekly as an NRO Executive Committee�a format 
McCone supported but which, he commented to Vance, would not be 
necessary if "a properly oriented DNRO was running the show." At the 
first meeting, it quickly became clear that McMillan and Fubini resent-
ed the DS&T's aggressive personnel recruitment and overall dynamism 
under Wheelon; Fubini went so far as to insinuate that the CIA was "try-
ing to create another NASA." McCone tried to quell this suspicion, al-
though he conceded later that the Agency's growing in-house capability 
seemed to be "worrying a lot of people around town." He informed the 
committee that much of the CIA' s recent effort responded to PFIAB 'S 
recommendations after the Cuban missile crisis. The DCI, however, lost 
out on the transfer of the CORONA contract from Lockheed to Aero-
space when Vance and Fubini sided with McMillan. At a later meeting,

and all of CIA's technical capability," including Wheelon and his staff, 
to assist the DNRO in finding out why the failure rate of CORONA 
missions had increased recently. McMillan did not respond, as McCone 
presumably had expected.''' (s) 
Following the elections, McCone pushed for the idea, promised by 
McNamara in August, of putting the NRO under the Defense Secre-
tary's office. Besides raising it with Vance, he also tried to gain support 
on Capitol Hill, particularly from Congressman Mendel Rivers, the new 
Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Vance was unre-
sponsive, however, and Rivers did not commit himself. By this time, 
McCone had set a date for leaving the CIA and was preparing to turn 
the problem over to his successor. He nevertheless continued to com-
plain about McMillan's actions to Vance and McNamara. In January 
1965, for example, he told them that McMillan had released money to 
a contractor without informing him and had warned the contractor not 
to divulge the arrangement to the CIA. The DCI said this was the "last 
straw" and that if the top two officials in the Defense Department would 
not straighten out the NRO, he "intend[edl to take it to higher authori-
ty."" (s) 
McCone had hoped that McMillan would become frustrated with 
the infighting and leave, and, according to Walter Elder, did what he 
could to bring that day closer. (Elder has denied, however, that McCone 
and Vance agreed that Vance would fire McMillan if McCone fired 
Wheelon.) As it turned out, the DNRO outlasted the DCI on the job. 
McCone had most of the last word on the NRO, however, as his reorga-
nization scheme became the basis for a fourth, and much longer lasting, 
NRP agreement signed in August 1965 by his successor, Vice Adm. 
William Raborn, and Vance. It established the NRO as a separate agen-
cy within the Defense Department; designated the Secretary of Defense 
as the executive branch agent of the space reconnaissance program; set 
up a new Executive Committee, to include the DCI, that would manage 
the program and report to the Secretary of Defense; and recognized the

DCI' s right as head of the Intelligence Community to establish collec-
tion requirements for spy satellites. The DNRO and DDS&T were 
excluded as voting members of the Executive Committee, and two per-
sonnel changes eliminated much of the rancor: Wheelon, although still 
DDS&T, would no longer be the Agency's NRO representative, and 
McMillan stepped down as DNRO in September 1965. The agreement, 
a compromise between the CIA and the Air Force, led to their success-
ful cooperation on several satellite collection projects and worked well 
as a decisionmaking structure. The two organizations still competed and 
occasionally overreacted to real or perceived slights, and the Agency 
still was underrepresented in the NRO. Despite the history of distrust, 
however, the CIA and the Air Force gradually smoothed out the rough-
est spots in their relationship and avoided the internecine fighting and 
personal clashes that had threatened to derail the US space reconnais-
sance effort. 49 (s) 
McCone's and Wheelon's Legacy (U) 
McCone resigned and returned to the private sector in 1965, and 
Wheelon did so the next year. The CIA's "chairman of the board" and 
his "chief technology officer" left it with a science and technology 
directorate much like what Killian and Land had called for more than a 
decade before: a bureaucratically formidable concentration of research, 
development, collection, and analysis that secured the Agency's inter-
national preeminence in technical espionage and strategic assessment. 
McCone's and Wheelon's organizational and administrative changes 
proved vital to the development of generations of satellites that enabled 
the Intelligence Community to monitor events in denied areas, provide 
warning to policymakers, watch unfolding crises, and oversee arms 
control. The styles and personalities of the DCI and the DDS&T�ac-
tivist and determined to their allies, aggressive and intractable to their 
opponents�helped preserve the CIA's role in technical collection. It is 
not at all clear that a more conciliatory approach would have accom-
plished as much against the concerted effort of the NRO and the Air 
Force to take over the satellite reconnaissance program. (C)

McCone and Wheelon, two technically minded outsiders, also ef-
fected a culture change at the Agency by diluting the influence of the 
"bold Easterners," "prudent professionals," and Ivy League 
intellectuals who dominated its clandestine and analytical components. 
With the emergence of the DS&T, "New men, with family names un-
familiar to the Eastern establishment, began to move into positions of 
prominence in the Agency," NPIC analyst Dino Brugioni has written. 
"They were experts in such disciplines as optics, electronics, chemistry, 
physics, engineering, and photography. Many were World War II vet-
erans educated under the provisions of the GI Bill." OSS veterans, ca-
reer spyhandlers, and graduates of elite liberal arts schools still set the 
social and intellectual tone at Langley, but the growing emphasis on 
technical collection ensured that the Agency would have a more diverse 
cadre of experts than ever before.'" (c) 
Looking back from the vantage point of nearly a quarter century, 
McCone expressed some reservations about selecting Wheelon as his 
head wizard: "I would have been more comfortable with a man that 
could be more reasonably adjusted to changes." The structure they de-
veloped for the new directorate worked inside and outside the Agency, 
however, and in 1973, when the DS&T acquired the TSD from the 
Directorate of Operations and NPIC from the DI, it finally assumed the 
shape its creators had envisioned years before.51 (s)
