 G ROMP KO  f?9 I DEAST  V I S I T
 Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's current visits to Damascus artd
 Cairo clearly seem to reflect Moscow's continuing cor-r,ern to
 assure thac the United States does not play the sole dtplomar:rc
 role in efforts toward an Arab-Israeli settlement.  Tt -!s noY:~t-
 worthy that Gromyko's trip to Cairo was r-ot announced by TAS;.~
 until 26 January (the Damascus visit was announced on the 29';h),
 after Israeli Foreign Minister A_lon's l7 January announceme:~t
 in Washington that Secretary Kissinger would be poying anot!:er
 visit to the area.  This follows the pattern last year, whc~~i.
 Gromyko made visits to Cairo and Damascus in late February~rarly
 March and to Damascus twice in May during the Secretary's rli.sengage-
 ment talks in the area.~ti  The omission of Baghdad--the third capital
 on Brezhnev's postponed Mideast tour--from Gromyko's itinf:ra2.y
 further underscores the fact that the visit was connecter.4 with
 the Arab-Israeli iss~ie.
 Gromyko's Damascus visit was notable for the first speciricat:ion--
 frota either Moscow or Damascus--of a deadline for the resumption of
 the Geneva conference no later than the end of February or beginning
 of March.  Cairo failed to support this deadline, the point Soviet-
 Egyptian statement calling only for "immediate resumption" of the
 talks.  Egypt did renew its March 1974 endorsement of Soviet partici-
 pation in all aspects and stages of a Mideast settlement including
 in "~11 working committees" of the Geneva conference,
 Gromyko'S Cairo talks apparently did not resolve bilateral issues;
 the point statement ambiguously noted the importance of an unspecified
 "exchange of views" between as-Sadat and Brezhnev on "most important
 aspects" of bilatera?. relations.  While Cairo media reported President
 as-Sadat and Gromyko as saying that Brezhnev's Mideast trip would be
 rescheduled, no confirmation of this has been received from Soviet
 media thus far.
 USSR, SYRIA SET GENEVA DEADLINE, EGYPT FAILS TO ENDORSE
 Moscow has been pressing in recent weeks for a return to the Geneva
 conference, at the same time sniping at U.S. diplomatic efforts to
 bring about new "phased agreements" between Israel and Arab states.
 *  Gromyko visited Damascus last year on a split tr::p on 27 Febr.uary-
 1 March and 5-7 March, interrupted by talks in Cairo 1-5 March, while
 Secretary Kissinger was also in the region.  He paid two more visits
 to Damascus in May, also meeting Secretary Kissinger in Cyprus on
 7 May and in Damascus on 25 May.

 5 FEBRUARY 1975
 Now, in tl~e 3 February Soviet-Syrian statement on Gromyko's
 Damascus talks, both sides have gone on record for the first
 time in setting a time frame for reconvening the Geneva conference,
 urging that it be resumed "immediately, in any case not later than
 February-begirming of March,"  For its part, Damascus had
 previously joined with Moscow in a 27 September 1974 statement--
 issued after a two-day visit by 1'r.esident al-Asad to Moscow while
 en roue to North Korea--stressing the "necessity of resuming the
 Geneva Mideast peace conference at the earliest date."  An earlier
 series of joint Soviet-Syrian conununiques, issued during Gromyko's
 three visits to Damascus last spring, had omitted any mention of
 tli'~' Geneva conference, reflecting Syria's reluctance at that time
 to commit itself to attendance at the conference.
 GROMYKO S'iATEMENTS       Both in his Cairo arrival remarks and in his
 Cairo banquet speech ran the 3d Gromyko urged
 resumption of the Geneva talks at the earliest late.  He called it
 necess:~.ry for "all who can make a contribution" to settlement of the
 problem to sit at a conference table, and, in what appeared to be
 a swipe at Secretary Kissinger's negotiating efforts, he added that
 "considerat?ons of sheer prestige and the more so vanity should be
 brushed aside."  He professed .*.o be pleased to see that "on this
 question, just as on many others," tine Egyptian and Soviet views
 coincide, "if we see Egypt's position corr.ectly."  The MENA version
 of Gromyko's statement omitted Gromyko's understanding of a
 coincidence of views--the only MENA variation from the TA5S account
 of the speech.
 SOVIET-EGYPTIAN STATEPIENT     Cairo declined to endorse the Soviet-
 Syrian deadline for resumption of the
 Geneva talks.  The joint statement instead advocated "immediate"
 resumption, in line with the calls for "early" or "earliest"
 resumption in the December and October 1974 statements on Fahmi's
 Moscow visits.  As in the December communique, the sides expressed
 the view that the Geneva conference was the most suitable forum
 for discussing all aspects of a Mideast settlement.  The Eg}?ptian
 side reaffirmed its view on "importance and necessity" of Soviet
 participation in all stages of. a Mideast settlement, including
 participation in all working organs which might be set up at the
 Geneva conference.  An identical statement in the 5 Marcli 1974
 communique on Gromyko's last visit to Egypt had been attributed to
 both sides.

 SADAT REMARKS    As-Sadat has frequently expressed his acceptance
 of both the Soviet call for resuming the Ceneva
 talks and the U.S. "advocacy of a step-by-step solution," remaining
 evasive on the date when "we will all go to Geneva."  Speaking to
 journalists on 4 February after leis meeting with Gromyko, he
 again balanced his remarlcs.  He said he was loolcing forward to
 Brezhnev's visit and then, responda.ng to a question, eaid ho
 welcomed Dr. Kissinger's visi~:, adding that "we maintain the
 best of relations with the two big powers," and are always ready
 to hold discussions with them.  He said he had discussed the
 Mideast problem frankly "with my friend Gromyko," and remarkad
 that "the international momentum is slow and speed is a must."
 iie disagreed with the term "partial steps" since, he said, it
 was interpreted as if Egypt were preparing to conclude a partial
 agreement with Israel, when it was "urgent" that Israel t~ithdr4~a
 on all three fronts.  In support of the Geneva talks, as-Sadat
 recalled that "I was the first to call for convening the Geneva
 conference," and added everything concerning peace would be agreed
 on there.
 As-Sadat has mentioned no specific date for resumption of the
 Geneva *_alks, but in a 2 February meeting with Egyptian journalists
 and information officials, he indicated that he regarded the
 expiration of the UN Disengagement Observer Force mandate on
 the Golan Front at the end of i~iay as the critical period.  "Unless
 the situation changes before this date," he said, the situation
 might become "explosive," and he called on the United States--"the
 one which can influence Israel"--to "make a quick decision in
 this connection."
 USSR-EGYPT S?AT6MENT AMBIGUOUS ON BRE7J-INEV-SADAT "EXCHANGE~~
 The joint statement on Gromyko's 3-5 February visit to Cairo, taken
 with as-Sadat's rer.~arks on matters to be discussed during Brezhnev's
 "coming" visit to Cairo, seem to suggest that problems in bilateral
 relations remain.  Ho~;aever, the statement did not specify a meeting
 between the two.  It ;seemed deliberately ambiguous in saying that
 as-Sadat and Gromyko, in discussing bilateral relations, "stressed
 the great importance of the exchange of  opinions" between Brezhnev
 and as-Sadat "on the most important questions of these relations."
 The statement thus left it unclear whether such an exchange had
 already occurred or was still pending.  Soviet media thus far have
 not mentioned, much less conf firmed, than. Brezhnev's Middle East
 visit is to be rescheduled; statements by as-Sadat and Gromyko to
 the effect were reported by Cairo media.

 lioscow has provided virtually nothing_in the way oL- upbeat
 coverage of Gromyko's Cairo visit, the first in almost a year,
 other than Y.o note that in the final. Fahmi-Gromyko talks on the
 4th the foreign ministers expressed "complete satisfaction"
 with the "exchange of views" on bilateral relations and lcey
 issues of  the Piideast  situation.         T~:SS'  brief  report on Gromylco's
 four-hour meeting with as-Sadat on the 4tlt said the conversation
 took place in a "businessl.ilce and friendly" atmosphere--the
 same characterization used in the joint statement--and the two
 "thoroughly discussed the state" of bilateral relations.  In
 contrast,  TASS' 2 February account of Gromylco's "warm and
 friendly" conversation with Syrian President al-Asad had said
 they expressed "satisfaction" with the progress of Soviet-Syrian
 relations.  TASS said Gromyko and as-Sadat "exchanged opinions"
 on the complex and tense Mideast situation; in Damascus, Gromyko
 and al-Asad gave "much consideration" to this issue, and al_-Asad
 expressed appreciation for the role of the USSR "which renders
 all-round assistance" to the Arabs.
 SADAT, GROMYKO REMARKS      TASS gave no indication that as-Sadat
 ON BREZHNEV VISIT           and Gromyko had met with journalists
 after their talk; Cairo radio and ;iENA
 reports cited as-Sadat as telling reporters that political, economic
 and military subjects had been surveyed and "I believe tae are
 starting a ne~?~ page" in Soviet-Egyptian relations on a "realistic"
 basis.  Foreshadowing the phrase in the joint statement on a
 summit-level exchange of opinions, as-Sadat said that di~cu~sion
 of "certain topics" had been completed "after reaching an under-
 standing and a decision" on them and "other topics" would be
 discussed "during Brezhnev's coming visit to Cairo."  Gror..yko
 affirmed, according to the P4ENA account, that Brezhnev's visit
 "would take place shortly," but said the date would be set later.
 Asked whether Brezhnev's Cairo visit would precede or follow hip
 visit to the United ~tates, Gromyko said that had not been decided:
 "Brezhnev's visit to the United States is scheduled, and its date
 will be fixed later."
 The Cairo radio report cited Gromyko as calling the talks "extremely
 useful and constructive."  He also mentioned discussion of bilateral
 cooperation "particularly in the political and economic spheres, and
 military cooperation between the two countries"--seemingly relegating
 the military aspect to second place.  The joint statement on the visit,
 as reported by Moscow's domestic service on the 5th, did not specify
 military subjects in noting that questions  concerning further
 development of relations in the "political, trade, economic, and other
 fields" were discussed.

 FAHMI-GROMYKO TALKS       Prior to Gromylco's meeting with as-Sadat,
 remarks by Gromylco and Foreign Minister
 Fahmi had indicated that their talks had not ironed out Sovi.et-
 Egyptian differences.  PI~NA reported Gromyko as saying, at the
 end of the first session of talics on the 3d, that they were held
 in a "constructive" atmosphere (TABS described them as "warm
 and :Friendly") and dealt with "one topic--a review of certain
 problems" in Soviet-Egyptian relations, with attention centered
 on the 1`lideast  situation "within  this framework."    Gr~~mylco added
 that one meeting was not- enough to deal in depth with "practical
 matters concerning what steps can be taken or discussed."
 In his banquet speech on the 3d Gromyxo in effect acknowledged
 Soviet-Egyptian differences, observing that "any setbacks,
 blemishes in our relations" pleased those who from the beginning
 did not want friendly Soviet-Egyptian relations to develop.  He
 asserted that the two countries "must be guided by their own
 interests," which he termed inseparable from the broader interests
 of  the struggle  for toor.ld peace.
 In reporting Foreign ??inister Fahmi's banquet speech, TABS
 pointedly deleted his reference to Arab military strength, citing
 him as saying that the Axab countries had to "strengthen their
 forces in all fields''---Fahmi here added "and particularly to
 double their defensive capacity"--to be able to deter aggression.
 TABS did report Fahmi as saying that Egypt wanted the USSR to
 have an effective role in supporting the Arab cause, but omitted
 his statement that in talics in Moscow, including the 26 llecember
 meeting with Brezhnev, "I was careful tv underline this point."
 Nor did TASS include Fahmi's statement that as-Sadat, in defining
 the basis of Egyptian policy, had said that Cairo was "quite
 prepared to establish the best relations with the Soviet Union."
 SOVIET-EGYPTIAN TREATY       Perhaps in an implicit rejoinder to
 recent remarks by President as-Sadat
 about the 1971 Soviet-Egyptian treaty, Gromyko mentioned the
 treaty both in his arrival remarks, ~.s reported by PRAVDA on
 the 14th, and in his Cairo banquet speech, when he termed it
 of "special significance" since the "high level" of Soviet-
 Egyptian relations depended on it.  TASS' report on the
 as-Sadat/Gromylco meeting also noted that the sides had resolved
 to "widen and deepen" their bilateral relatiions on the basis
 of the treaty.  A reference to the treaty in this same context

 also appeared in the point statement- on the visit as carried
 by Cairo media.  While I?ioscow versions of the statement available
 thus far made no mention of the treaty, it presumably will appear
 in the text when published i.n PRAWA, fudging by similar Soviet
 media treatment of the same passage in the "announcement" on
 Fahmi's meeting with Brezhnev last October.
 In recent irit~rviews, as-Sadat has suggested some doubts about
 the effectiveness of the treaty. He was reported as saying in
 a 12 January ROSE AL-YUSUF interview that he expelled the Soviet
 experts in 1972 because the USSR had not L-ulfilled its obligation
 under Article 8 of the treaty, which refers to strengthening
 Egypt's "defense capacity."  iJhen he was asked in his 20 January
 LE I~10NDE interview if he would denounce the treaty if Moscow
 did not deliver requested arms, as-Sadat said he "cannot rule
 out such a possibility, but it is very difficult to take a
 decision which would run counter to Egypt's interests and those
 of the Arab eTOrld generally."  He would have to "reflect a
 great deal before taking such a decisive step," he said, adding
 that no other power was in a position to replace the USSR :in
 this sphere but that "nevertheless, my patience has limits."
 Asked again, in a French TV interview reported by I?fENA on
 27 January, whether he had lost the "strategic reserve" represented
 by the treaty, as-Sadat replied that this had not happened "yet,"
 and said the treaty was "still effective and absolutely no change
 occurred in this regard."
 GROMYKO REFERS TO PALESTINIAN ~~STATE," MEETS PLO LEADEF~
 Previous Soviet leadership usage of various formulations acknow-
 ledging Soviet support for some forn- of Palestinian "statehood"
 (gosudarstvennost') since September 1974 suggests that little
 special importance should be attached to Gromyko's reference to
 a Palestinian "state" (gosudarstvo) in his dinner speech at
 Damascus, reported by PRAVDA on the 3d.  Gromyko made the first
 known reference by a top Soviet official to "state" in affirming
 Moscow's support of legitimate Palestinian rights, "in keeping
 with their national aspirations right up ~o the establishment of
 a state of their own."  However, Podgornyy, in an 8 September 1974
 speech, had made the first Soviet elite reference to some form of
 Palestinian "statehood," and Moscow since then has used, inter-
 changeably, a variety of formulations that reveal no particular
 pattern.

 Tt seems doubtf:u.1 Moscow assigns much  significance  to  or draws
 any distinction among the various formulations, having once gone
 on record in support of some sort of Palestinian entity.  Brezhnev
 followed up Pod~ornyy by stating in an 11 October speech that i t
 was necessary to satisfy the 1'alestini ans' right to their own
 "national home" (ochag).  Since then, Soviet comment has used
 statehood and national home, separately or together, and has
 also used such expressions as "nationa 1 entity" and "national
 authority," while some TASS English reports have cited Egyptian
 officials and Palestinian leaders on the question of a Palestinian
 "state."
 As an exampla of Moscow's inconsistency or this matter, TASS'
 4 February report on Gromylco's Cairo dinner speech cited him
 as referring to the Palestinians' right to statehood; a Pioscow
 Arabic-language report on the same speech said Gromyko had
 expressed Soviet support for the Palestinians' right to establish
 their "national authority" (as-sultah  al-wataniyah).  Still
 another variation appeared in the Soviet-Egyptian s~atement,
 which referred to Palestinian national  rights including their
 right to self-determination and "their own national home."
 Curiously, the Soviet-Syrian statement made no mention of any
 Palestinian entity, merely advocating assurance of Palestinian
 "national rights."
 GROMYKO-'ARAFP,T MEETING   Gromyko again met with Palestine
 Liberation  Organization (PLO)
 chairman 'Arafat ~~hile in llamascu~, as he had during his trips
 to the area last year.  A Moscow domes tic service report on the
 "warm and friendly" talk on 2 February said particular attention
 was devoted to the problem of safeguarding the Palestinians'
 legitimate national rights and their rights to self-determination
 and statehood.  The report indicated that one topic of discussion
 was the question of PLO participation in the Geneva peace
 conference, Gromyko calling for attendance of "a PLO representative"
 with "the full rights of a delegation."  No mention was made of
 'Arafat's position.  The final statements on Gromyko's visits
 in both pamascus and Cairo called for PLO representation at
 Geneva.  Suggestive of PLO footdragging on this issue, an P.rabic -
 language commentary broadcast by Moscow on the 4th asserted tha t
 "Geneva alone will provide the PLO the  opportunity to participate
 in efforts to achieve a Mideast settlement," warning that Israe 1
 "aims  to exclude the PLO" from these efforts.

 USSR-PORTUGAL
 MOSCOW CITES LISBON DENIAL THAT USSR SOUGHT PORT FACILITIES
 Moscow media have reported the Portuguese Foreign Ministry's denial
 that the USSR had asked Portugal to provide port facilities for the
 Soviet  fishing  fleet.  But  the wording of  the Ivloscow media report:;
 and differences between Moscow Radio and TASS accou^ts hsve left
 some confusion as to whether the issue in contention is the use
 of port facilities or a more permanent establishment of "bases"
 for the Soviet fishing fleet.
 I~ioscow Radio on 2 February briefly reported the Portuguese Foreign
 Ministry's denial that the USSR had asked permission for its
 fishing fleet "to call at Portuguese ports."  Coming two days after
 initial Western press agency reports of such a Soviet request, the
 terse, two-sentence Moscow Radio item avoided any attribution to
 the Soviet government while noting that the Portuguese Foreign
 Ministry had described the reports as "totally unfounded."
 Moscow Radio's account of the Portuguese Foreign Ministry denial
 was carried in several of :its African and European broadcasts at
 midday and on the evening of the 2d.  TASS did not carry the
 Portuguese denial until the 4th, when its English service trans-
 mitted essentially the same report, although the TASS account
 stated that "allegations" by the Western news agencies suggested
 the USSR was asking for "bases" for its fishing boats.
 Moscow refrained from commenting directly on Western press
 s pe;.ulation concerning the alleged Soviet request until the 4th,
 when TASS com'nentator V. Goncharov ridiculed the New York TIMES
 :~isbon correspondent for reaching the "wise" conclusion that
 there exists a "Soviet threat" to the NATO states.  While citing
 the Portuguese Foreign Ministry's denial  that  t'he USSR had requested
 "bases for its fishing vessels," Goncharov pointed out that it was
 normal practice for Soviet fishing boats to use "the services of
 many foreign ports" to replenish fresh water and food supplies and
 sometimes make repairs."  Arguing that this is a "generally
 accepted practice of long st~.nding," Goncharov maintained that
 it has "never occurred  to anyone to make a sensation out cif  this."
 Iie concluded that in light of the Fortuguese denial, the "provocative
 campaign" by the  "American" media has  "failed miserably."

 VIETP~Af~I
 DRV FIRST' SECRETARY LE DUAN SPEAKS ON 45TH PARTY ANNIVERSARY
 The 45th anniversary of the Vietnam Workers Party (VWP) on 3 February
 was marked in standard fashion by a Hanoi meeting at which First
 Secretary Le Duan delivered the main address.  The first secretary's
 address was most notable for its detailed recounting of the
 importance of political struggle in the Vietnamese revolution.  In
 outlining conditions for a settlement in South. Vietnam, he called
 for a new Saigon regime, but stopped short of recent PRG and
 authoritative Hanoi pronouncements demanding the overthrow of
 President Thieu.  In discussing party tasks for the coming year,
 the first secretary maintained Hanoi's silence on the party's long-
 delayed fourth party congress, suggesting that North Vietnam is
 stj.ll not prepared to set a date for the national party gath~?ring,~'
 The party anniversary is the first of the DRV's long-heralded
 "three major anniversaries" to be celebrated in 1975, and will be
 followed by the 85th anniversary of Ho Chi M~.nh's birth, on 19 May,
 ~Znd the 30th anniversary of the founding of the DRV, on 2 September.
 F.s in the case of previous quinquennial anniversaries, the party
 landmark was observed with emulation campaigns, editorial comment,
 and the publication of a revised party history.  Le Duan had also
 addressed the 40th anniversary meeting in 1970, and 10 days later
 North Vietnamese media publicized a major article by the first
 secretary marking the anniversary, describing the work as a "very
 important and very basic documen~."
 The traditional Hanoi meeting prompted the turnout of the entire
 North Vietnamese Politburo, with the usual exception of Pham Hung
 who has not been reported by the media to ha~~e been in North Vietnam
 since 1967.  The Politburo similarly appeared in full force at the
 1970 anniversary meeting, except for Le Duc Tho ?~aho was in Paris fo r
 a French Communist Party congress.  Politburo member Truong Chinh
 gave the brief opening and  dosing remarks at this year's meeting--
 a task assumed five years ago by DRV President Ton Duc Thang, who,
 this year, was merely listed in the presidium of the meeting.
 *  The Third VWP congress in September 1960 was preceded by more
 than a year of reports of provincial preparations and other
 publicity.

 LE UUAN SPEECH       Keeping to the general outline of his anniversary
 speech ir. 1970, Le lluan devoted the greater part
 of 1-is remarks to summarizing the "revolutionary" achievements in
 Vietnam since the inception of  the party  in .1930.     In  this  context,
 he dwelt upon the tactics of political struggle and the historical
 lessons to be drawn from their use in the 1945 August Revolution,
 While Le Duan did nit directly link these tactics of the past to the
 present-day situation in the South, his implication is clear that
 they would be. equally effective now and should be used g9ven tY~e
 proper opportunity.  Le Duan noted that the VW1' had always employed
 violence to obtain its revolutionary goals, but pointed out that
 this did not imply that only armed struggle was invo)ved.
 According to Le Duan, the party "from the outset attached paramount
 importance to political struggles, to building a 'mass
 political army' of the revolution ."  Terming the August
 Revolution "a general insurrection ingeniously combining political
 struggle with armed struggle," he argued that its development in
 Hanoi,  llue,  aiad  Saigon was  the consequence, n:~t  only of  armed
 struggle in the countryside, but the result of hav~.ng thrown "all
 of the political and armed forces into do-or-die at*_acks on the
 nerve centers of  the enemy  trl the cities  and  t~~~~ns."        i~ithout
 utilizing these tactics, Le Duan claimed that a "unique opportunity"
 would have been lost.
 It is unclear whether Le Duan's historical discussion reflects his
 current views on strategy in South Vietnam, but it is notable that
 an historical passage in his 1970 party anniversary speech see?._a,
 in retrospect, to have been related to his views on the strategy
 to be pursued then,  In the 1970 speech he gave unusual attention
 to the party's "flexible" tactics in dealing w?.th Nationalist
 Chinese and French forces in 1946--involving temporary "reconcilia-
 tion" with first one and then tlic other to gain time to prepare for
 the resistance war.  His historical allusion then--three years
 before the Paris peace agreement--could well have reflected his
 s?ipport for Hanoi's policy of seeking an agreement short of the
 final communist goals, in order to remove U..ri. forces and gain a
 respite in the struggle in South Vietnam.
 Le Duan's discussion of the situation in `'mouth Vietnam, in his
 current speech, did not include the strident demands that have
 become standard since the 8 October 1974 PRG statement.  The 1:'RG
 statement--focusing on. the reec? to overthrow Thieu "and his gazlg"
 before there can be negotiations for d settlement--has been recalled
 in recent authoritative DRV comment, including that ~n til:' anniversary

 1~10SCGW, HAVANA Bl~4ME "RIrHTISTS" FOR CP MEI~ER ~S DEATH
 Soviet and Cuban media have protested the death--announced on
 5 January--of long-time Mexican Communist Party (PCM) member
 llilarl.o Moreno while in Mexican police custody  and the incarcer-
 ation of other PCM members.  Moscow and llavana  have shown caution
 in treating the Mexican incident and have followed the lead of
 the PCM in blaming Moreno's death on "rightist forces" said
 to have infiltrated the police, rather than on  the government
 of President Luis Echeverria, whom Fidel Castro recently
 described as the "Mexican president who has been most friendly
 with Cuba" since the success of Castro's revolu *_ion in 1959.
 The Soviet and Cuban reactions in the Mexican case contrast
 sharply with their wholesale condemnation of the Guatemalan
 Government following the recent death of Guatemalan Communist
 Party chief Humberto Alvarado.*
 TREATMENT OF           lluring the early years after Castro came to
 ADMINISTRATION         power, relations between Cuba and Mexico,
 the only OAS member which never broke diplomatic
 ties with the Castro regime, often were formall y correct rather
 than o~arm.         However,  conununist media  characterizations of Mexico
 have become more flattering since the 1970 inauguration of Luis
 Echeverria, whose Third World-style politics and dialogue with
 leftists iu his counl-ry have won a considerable measure of
 approval from Moscow and llavana.  The PCM, a Moscow-line party,
 also backs the president's foreign policy, although still
 occasionally chastising him for an "antipopular" approach in
 maintaining tight control over domestic politics.
 In the past few months Echeverria's "firm" posture toward the
 United States has been given special attention, PRAVDA noting
 on 23 October 1974 that his border meeting with President Ford
 demonstrated the iviexican president's determination to "uphold
 an independent line."  Mexico's increasingly critical attitude
 toward the Chilean regime also was praised, and  on ::7 November,
 Cuban comr,Rentator David  Nunez Segura touted Mexico's rupture
 of relations with Chile as "an important contribution to moral
 uprightness."  Mexican support for the lifting of OAS sanctions

 against Cuba won further accolades from communist officialdom,
 and, on 10 Jaz-uary during a visit to Cuba by a Mexica:z delegation
 led by Mrs. Echeverria, Castro told reporters that Lcheverria
 was Mexico's "most progressive chief of stat~.e" since 1940 and
 "the moat friendly toward Cuba "
 PCM           A potential test of these close relations was
 EVENTS        by L-he arrest of PCM activists Hilario Moreno andJided
 Eusebio Martinez on 29 December last year and the
 subsequent announcement by the Mexican police that Moreno had
 committed suicide in his cell and that the PGM was implicated
 in a plot to subvert central American governments.  Further
 complicating matters was the later arrest of at leaPh one PCM
 leader and oilier leftists in connection with a series of bombings
 which leave been 'variously attributed to guerrilla groups and
 to rightwing elements in league with the CIA.
 In an 18 January PRAVDA article--Moscow's only public response
 to the recent events--writer K. Kurin views the incidents as
 a "campaign of provocat9on" by reactionaries and imperialists
 seeming to "goad the official authorities to anticommunist
 aci.ions."  Izi phraseology typical of Moscow's treatment of
 left--of-center Latin governments, the writer asserted that
 Mexico's "secret police" had used the "absurd pretext" of a
 suppose-3 plot to strike against the PCM and the "constructive
 foreign policy of President Luis Echeverria."  Kurin played down
 the death of Moreno--noting only that the police had "alleged"
 suicide--possibly because the Mexican government had already
 appointed "an observer of the presidency" to monitor the
 continuing investigation of the death.
 P:sNSA LATINA reports, like PRAVDA, have avoided direct criticism
 of  tl~e Nierican government and have viewed  the events as a
 "provocatory campaign" of "anticommunist slander" that has
 been denounced by the country's leaders.  Thus, on 17 January
 the Cuban agency reported that Mexico's ruling Institutional
 Revolutionary Party had "backed the PCM demand" tha*_ the
 police end their "persecution"  of communists.  Going a step
 further than Moscow, Havana quoted Mexican sources who associated
 the CIA with the "persecution," noting on the 23d that the
 Mexican socialist party had described recent events as "an
 escalation started by the CIA to drive the country into a situation
 of violence."

 NOTES
 U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS:  Soviet comment in the walce of Mosco~~'s
 cancellation of the 1972. U.S.-Soviet trade agreement has included
 sporadic hints of retaliatj.on against the "discriminatory" U.S.
 trade bill.  At the same time, the cormnent has continued to stress
 the desirability of U.S.-Soviet detente, and there have also been
 references to Brezltnev's scheduled trip to the United States this
 year.  According to a 1 February Budapest radio report, PR.AVDA's
 authoritative political commentator Yuriy Zhukov in a receni.
 Moscow TV talk cited Brezhnev's scheduled LT .S. trip as, like the
 Vladivostok summit, a significant step in consolidating detente.
 And a 25 January PRAVDA report of President Ford's meeting with
 a group of yo!~ng Soviet journalists included his statement that
 he expected Brezhnev to visit the United States this summer.
 Zhu'.cov's Moscow TV talk also reportedly included a remark that
 in view of the cancellation of the trade agreement, "the Soviet
 Union was not paying, among other things, the Lend-Lease debts
 outstanding from World filar II."  As has happened occasionally in
 the past, Zhukov's talk apparently was not reported by the
 Moscow radio or press.  His statement on Lend-Lase had been
 foreshadowed in an 18 January IZVESTIYA commentary by Bovin,
 which had implied that the compromise reached ors this issue in
 the 1972 trade agreement was no longer operative.  Bovin had
 also hinted that the present moment would be propitious for
 West Europe to intensify its econpmic cooperation with the
 Soviet Union, a hint that was reinfozced in NEW TIMES on the
 24th and IZVESTIYA on the 28th, both of which cited American
 publications for the conjecture that the U.S. trade bill would
 lead the USSR to transfer its orders from *_ile United States to
 other ~destern countries.  Implied criticis*.i of the trade bill
 by President Ford in his 21 January press conference was noted
 in several commentaries that buttressed Moscow's demand for a
 revision of the bill's objectionably features.

 MOSCOW ON PORTUGUESE DEVELOPMENTS:  Moscow has continued its relatively
 low-Iceyed and selective reporting of recent events in Portugal at a
 time of heightening tension prior to the scheduled constituent assembly
 elections.  Two constant Moscow themes suggest that "reaction" has
 not yet g:?.ven up in its attempts to reverse the gains of the past
 nine months and that all "progressive" forces must fight to continue
 their unity with the Armed Forces Movement (MTA).  Moscow has reported
 the increasing difficulties between the Portuguese Communist Party
 (PCP) and the Socialist Party (FSP) and has cited PCP statements
 on the alleged "movement to the right" by PSP leaders.  But Moscow
 has not acknowledged the recent strong attacks by Socialist leader
 and Foreign Minister Soares linlcing the PCP to the Soviet Union.
 Similarly, Soviet media have generally ignored the charges by the
 PSP and ethers that the Communist Party has "conspiratorial" plans
 to carry out a coup in Portugal.  Instead, Moscow has reiterated
 PCP leader Cunhal's urgings that the socialists and communists
 cooperate and remain united with MFA in order to advance the "demo-
 cratization" of Portugal.  Thus, typically, TASS on 1 February
 reported that the situation in Lisbon was "tranquil" following the
 agreement by the PCP and PSP to cancel their planned demonstrations
 at the r.?equest of the PEA and the "fiasco" of the attempt by "left
 extremists and reactionaries" to cause disturbances in Lisbon.  At
 the same time, Moscow has issued its usual swipes at NATO for its
 "concerns" over the situation in Portugal and Spain, with a TASS
 summary of a 4 February PRAVDA article asserting that the current
 NATO naval maneuvers reflect the concerns of the NATO "strategiF:.s"
 over the outcome of the upcoming elections in Portugal a:~d the
 development of the "democratic struggle in Spain."
