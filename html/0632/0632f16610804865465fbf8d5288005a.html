 was used in this report.
 This directory is designed as a reference aid for the policymaker or analyst
 interested in charting the course of the Islamic revival since the Iranian
 revolution in countries with significant Muslim populations. We have
 chronicled the extent to which Islam, especially in its militant and radical
 forms, is an influence on the politics of those countries and offer a brief
 prognosis of each nation's prospects for future stability, with emphasis on
 the role of Islamic fundamentalism.                                  25X1
 Our study examines all countries with Muslim populations that comprise a
 significant part of the social fabric. Although the Muslim heartland of the
 Middle East is undoubtedly the locus of the most politically active
 fundamentalist movements, it contains less than one-fourth of the world's
 nearly 1 billion believers. We did not set a minimum percentage of
 Muslims to total country population for inclusion in the study; such a
 restriction would have eliminated the approximately 80 million Muslims
 who live and practice their faith in China and the Soviet Union. We did
 omit many countries with small pockets of Muslims that are statistically as
 well as politically insignificant                         25X1
 We examined a large number of intelligence reports and State Department
 communications received over the past five years. Academic monographs
 and foreign and US press reports provided additional details and often
 useful analysis. Population statistics were estimated as of July 1983 by the
 Center for International Research, US Bureau of the Census. In many
 countries, we estimated the Muslim populations based on the best available
 data because their governments have not enumerated their populations by
 sect or released statistics on them.)                             25X1

 Unity, Diversity, and Turmoil
 in the Islamic Mosaic
 The latest Islamic revival, begun in the early 1970s,
 reached its apogee with the revolution in Iran in 1979
 and now affects the lives of close to 1 billion people
 and more than 60 governments worldwide. Although
 Islam increasingly thrives as a set of social and
 religious values transcending national boundaries, its
 political content has often meant domestic pressure on
 the government establishment and tensions between
 Islam has developed a confrontational dimension that
 has both invigorated its reassertion and alarmed
 Western policymakers. In many countries with signif-
 icant Muslim populations, disillusionment with alien,
 secular ideologies such as democracy, Communism,
 and socialism is widespread. Military setbacks in the
 Arab heartland states have added to a sentiment of
 failure, despite the fact that colonial domination is
 over.F      I
 Fundamentalist Goals
 Fundamentalist Islam is, according to academics, an
 offshoot of the overall phenomenon of religious revival
 and has increasingly taken on both militant and
 radical forms. Based on our analysis of fundamental-
 ist organizations in 71 countries with sizable Muslim
 populations, we see common philosophical goals
 among them:
 ? Constitutional Reform. All groups press for a return
 to preeminence of the Shariah (Islamic legal system)
 rather than civil codes for the rule of the state.
 ? Search for Social and Economic Justice. Funda-
 mentalists want society restructured to protect the
 underprivileged and to institutionalize an equitable
 distribution of the fruits of labor.
 ? Reform of Leadership. The "just ruler" who serves
 his populace before himself is a consistent theme in
 fundamentalist belief.
 dietary prohibitions of Islam, the immodest dress of
 females, and the mingling of the sexes in school and
 commerce.)                             25X1
 Despite these common goals and attempts to inter-
 nationalize the scope of fundamentalism through
 associations, havens in exile, and external funding of
 small radical cells, international links between fun-
 damentalist groups are hampered by mutual intoler-
 ance and domestic issuesF       I    25X1
 A Third World Phenomenon
 Although Muslims exist under democracies, monar-
 chies, sultanates, and socialist and Communist    25X1
 states-virtually every form of government-we see
 the revival principally as a developing country phe-
 nomenon. It is born out of the anxieties and frustra-
 tions of the disproportionately youthful Third World
 countries striving to demonstrate their autonomy from
 the postcolonial influences of the developed world. We
 believe that the revival was partly fueled by the oil-
 rich Muslim heartland countries in the mid-1970s,
 but it also exists indigenously without external assist-
 ance and will continue even if the world petroleum
 market declines or collapses.               25X1
 Our analysis shows that all governments in the Mus-
 lim world, whatever their political ideology, are vul-
 nerable to the destabilizing criticism made by domes-
 tic opposition or by imported Islamic activists. Many
 of these governments are debt ridden and lack the
 resources for independent economic development.
 They must seek funds from radical Muslim states yet
 cultivate the financial largess of both superpowers.
 Internally, they must provide their youthful popula-
 tion with employment and their masses with social
 welfare programsF_____1      25X1

 Within the Arab world, the Muslim Brotherhood (al-
 Ikhwan al-Muslimun) is the most prominent funda-
 mentalist Islamic organization. Founded in 1928 by
 Shaykh Hassan al-Banna, it became an important
 political group in Egypt in the 1940s. After World
 War II it spread to other Arab states, both through
 returning Arab students who had studied in Egypt
 and through Egyptian exiles who sought haven in
 other states, especially in Syria, Jordan, Saudi Ara-
 bia, and the Gulf states. Many Egyptian Brothers
 remain as teachers of Arabic in neighboring nations,
 conveying their philosophy along with their academic

 at the other extreme, byfghting underground as
 terrorist groups, infiltrating armies, co-opting student
 organizations, and publishing propaganda. This flexi-
 bility of tactics and the clandestine nature of its
 methods have perhaps given the Brotherhood a more
 sinister reputation than it deserves. Only in the
 Syrian "branch" is the Brotherhood a declared revo-

 such non-Arab countries as West Germany, United
 Kingdom, Switzerland, and Malaysia are linked in
 any way. It may only be the name that is a common
 feature.
 A common set of objectives, as opposed to true
 fraternal links, underlies Brotherhood pronounce-
 ments in all countries:
 ? Substitution of the Shariah for Western legal
 systems.
 ? An economy based on Koranic principles, including
 the abolition of interest and the replacement of tax
 codes by the traditional zakat (alms tax) to help the
 poor.                              25X1

 We expect the Brotherhood's ideology to remain
 attractive, especially among disadvantaged youth in
 developing countries, as an Islamic fundamentalist

 Reaffirmation and Purification
 We believe the Islamic revival has been principally a
 reaffirming and purifying force sweeping nominally
 Muslim societies rather than a proselytizing force
 attempting to convert nonbelievers as it was in past
 centuries. The lax practice and distortion of orthodox
 Islam has been moderated as both governments and
 the opposition have used Islamic terminology and
 symbols to introduce reforms in society. This attitudi-
 nal change has spurred an unprecedented intellectual
 revival in Islamic centers, international dialogues and
 disputations, and a plethora of publications and study
 groups. The profound communications and transpor-
 tation explosion of the late 20th century has sparked
 almost instantaneous awareness of the powerful mes-
 sage of Islam by millions of villagers on the ubiquitous
 Islam has undergone numerous splits, rivalries, and
 conflicts over the interpretation of the Koran and
 Muhammad's messages on social and religious be-
 havior among believers. The major division is be-
 tween the two branches, Sunni and Shia. Numerous
 subsects or schools of interpretation are included in
 Sunni
 More than 80 percent of all Muslims are Sunnis.
 They are followers of the Sunnah, the way of the
 Prophet, and recognize the first four caliphs (succes-
 sors to Muhammad) as temporal leaders of Islam.
 Within two centuries after the death of Muhammad,
 however, no central authority interpreted Islamic
 religious law. Instead, four schools of interpretation
 evolved, based on the individuals who first espoused a
 doctrinal version of the hadiths, the "six books" of
 traditions under the Prophet. These schools (Hanbali,
 Hanafi, ShafIi, and Maliki) are considered equally
 valid, and a Sunni Muslim may follow any one of
 Although Sunni Muslims have religious scholars and
 clerics, they place greater stress on community con-
 sensus than on the pronouncements of religious el-
 ders. The religious establishments in Sunni states
 have rarely posed a political threat to the regime, as
 they accept a secular leader's right to rule the state.
 They have often legitimized authoritarian rule by
 their support and, at the same time, moderated the
 leader's secular policies.
 Shia
 Shia Islam is based on the belief that the legitimate
 leadership of the Islamic community rests exclusively
 The purification element of Islamic activism has
 omitted, almost without exception, any condemnation
 of the concurrent technological revolution within the
 Third World. Instead, it exists alongside knowledge
 and control of advanced scientific techniques, agricul-
 tural and industrial modernization, and, more omi-
 nously, nuclear knowledge and sophisticated military

 Ali, who was the fourth infallible imam. Over time
 the line of succession came into dispute, with Shia
 Islam dividing and subdividing into innumerable
 sects, usually over interpretation of when a new
 infallible imam would appear to bestow true knowl-
 edge upon mankind.                    25X1 25X1
 Shias accept the doctrine of the indivisibility of
 religious and political decision making in a literal
 sense. This makes it easy for Shia adherents to
 accept authoritative figures who interpret all laws-

 Political Repercussions of the Split
 The Sunni-Shia split has, throughout the history of
 Islam, been one of its most divisive and, at times,
 most bloody characteristics. In the 19th century this
 split produced "reformist " or 'fundamentalist"
 movements. In the last decade, Shias-who are a
 minority except in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, and North 25X1
 Yemen-have fared poorly politically against the
 more flexible Sunni majority. But, with Iran's revo-
 lution, its proselytizing convictions, and the funds to
 support its missionizing, new sectarian tensions have
 come to other Muslim communities. To the Sunni or
 secular leadership in countries such as Lebanon,
 Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Kuwait, Shias
 have been perceived as a politically destabilizing
 threat that must be dealt with-sometimes delicate-
 ly, sometimes with political repression.

 Sufism is a variant on orthodox Islam with broad
 appeal, particularly in Africa. Sufi elements also
 appear in the Soviet Union and in South and South-
 east Asia. Sufism is not a "sect" as such but rather

 Sufi religious orders in North Africa evolved into
 numerous groups who believed that religious power
 came from saints, tombs, and the descendants of
 original teachers. In the rest of Africa, Surfraterni-
 ties have stressed special rituals and charms and
 have given cohesion and social order, especially in
 rural areas. They have often represented particular
 ethnic interests and, in some cases, commercial ties.
 Qadiriya and TiJaniya are the two most popular Sufi
 orders in Africa:
 ? Qadiriya. Abd al-Qadir al Jilani was a Persian
 mystic and miracle worker who died in 1166 in
 Baghdad after attracting hundreds of disciples and
 followers. His conservative teachings came to be      25X1
 laced with Sur mysticism and ecstasy producing
 ceremonies through the centuries.
 ? Tijaniya. The TiJaniya Brotherhood sprang up in
 the 19th century partly as a rival to the powerful
 Qadiriyahs. Founded by a Moroccan cleric, Ahmad
 al-Tifani (1737-1815), it spread through Islamic
 Africa spearheaded through territorial conquests
 by specific Sufi leaders. After waning, it reemerged
 in the 20th century. It now is probably the largest
 brotherhood in Africa with many largely autono-
 mous branches ranging from western Upper Volta to

 Politically, the Sul orders have had little influence
 on the predominantly secular leadership of African
 states. Sufism, however, has proved to be a resilient
 restraining factor against the proselytizing of either   25X1
 Saudi Wa'hhabis, radical Libyans, or fundamentalist
 Iranians, all of whom regard Sufism as a heretical
 form of Islam. rI                    25X1
 The Threat to Stability
 Our analysis of fundamentalist groups worldwide
 indicates that many of them, frustrated by their
 inability to participate in their own domestic political
 process, have turned to militancy and terrorism to
 unseat unpopular secular leaders or "impure" Muslim
 leaders. The ideologically motivated battle of the
 fundamentalists against indigenous leaders who have
 associated themselves too closely with Western secu-
 larism is often bloody and dangerous-as irrational or
 destructive as the assassination of Egypt's Sadat or
 the terrorist bombing of peacekeeping forces in Bei-
 Although fundamentalist groups can cause national
 crises overnight with terrorist acts, they usually lose
 more than they gain as the government undertakes
 repressive measures against them.)               25X1

 ? Engage in widespread building of mosques and
 Islamic educational institutions.
 ? Establish Ministries of Religion, Islamic Affairs, or
 similar structures in which religious figures can be
 co-opted into the government establishment.
 ? Nationalize the clerics by making them civil
 servants.
 ? Sponsor Islamic cultural events such as Koran
 reading contests.
 ? Mandate more stringent observance of the Islamic
 social code such as banning gambling, alcohol, and
 nightclubs.
 ? Send religious leaders on representational trips to
 In our view, these steps have short-range usefulness in
 legitimizing the political leader and his regime but
 have done little to dampen fundamentalist zeal. Co-

 Repression
 The alternative government response has been repres-

 ? Banning of radical literature, censorship of publica-

 ? Disbanding student organizations and banning

 ? Trying, jailing, and even executing fundamentalist

 ? Targeting fundamentalist groups for security sur-

 Ruthless suppression has had its successes, most
 noticeably in the Communist states. Other secular

 found that repression keeps opposition manageable.

 against Sadat in Egypt. Increasing numbers of funda-
 mentalists may form extremist groups in exile, gain
 financial assistance from Libya or Iran, and increase
 their terrorist acts against secular or even moderate
 The Future: Fundamentalism Limited
 as a Political Force
 We expect the Islamic revival to continue to exert
 pressure on the leaders of Muslim countries but not to
 create revolutionary changes either within the state or
 in the relations between countries. Governments,
 which can exploit Islam for political expediency,
 economic enhancement, and genuine social change,
 probably will continue a course of pragmatic accom-
 modation with it. No government ignores its political-
 ly divisive implications. Although we believe that 25X1
 violent acts by Muslim extremists will continue to
 plague the states of the Muslim world over the near
 term, we do not expect the forces of fundamentalism
 to unite in the unique conditions that produced the
 Islamic Republic of Iran.O        25X1
 Although the Iranian revolution unquestionably
 strengthened the Islamic revival, we believe that the
 inherent divisiveness and multisectarian and mutually
 intolerant character of the Muslim world, including 25X1
 the presence of ethnic, tribal, and national rivalries,
 will work against a unified movement that could
 coalesce against US interests. We know of no charis-
 matic leader who transcends national lines. Although
 we expect Iran and Libya to continue their efforts to
 export a more militant brand of Islam and Saudi
 Arabian coffers to spill out millions to support friend-
 ly, conservative states, we believe their influence will
 continue to be limited, especially where the two
 superpowers are largely inimical to their aims
 Our analysis shows that Islamic resurgence has often
 generated anti-Western attitudes and policies and a
 suspicion of Western intentions. The fundamentalists
 are hostile to the United States on several counts:
 ? It is a predominantly Christian country with a
 constitutionally mandated separation between
 church and state.
 ? Its materialism and immorality (as perceived by the
 fundamentalists) are offensive.

 ,Ivt
 ? It is a benefactor to the power elite of regimes
 throughout the Muslim world. For Islamic militants
 opposing their own rulers, the United States shares
 the role of villain.
 ? The fundamentalists see the United States as favor-
 ing Israel in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
 ? Fundamentalists blame the United States for failing
 to propose an equitable solution to the Palestinian
 Most militant fundamentalist groups display a xeno-
 phobic fear that the West, specifically the United
 States, will translate what the groups see as disdain
 for Islam into active interference and confrontation.
 This perception has impaired US initiatives for peace
 in the Middle East and has bred an intransigence and
 intolerance among the fundamentalists that we be-
 lieve is a legacy of years of Islamic animosity to the
 Christian world's predominance in world affairs.
 "Neither East nor West" is a recurrent and popular
 theme in current Islamic ideology, but the fundamen-
 talists usually find the Soviet Union's message more
 appealing than that of the United States because of its
 stronger support for revolutionary change against
 entrenched regimes. The Soviet invasion of Afghani-
 We believe that the Islamic factor will be a potential-
 ly destabilizing force for many Muslim nations with
 which the United States has strategic relations and
 that it will require increased sensitivity on the part of
 US policy to contain subversion by fundamentalists.
 Although we do not believe that extremist religious
 groups will be able to seize control of governments
 anywhere in the Islamic world in the near term, they
 are capable-as evidenced by the assassination of
 Sadat-of taking violent action against close US
 An attempt by the government of a Muslim country
 to diminish Islam's normally important role in govern-
 ment decisionmaking could obscure important indica-
 tors of a serious challenge to the government. For
 example, the stilled voice of the clerics under the Shah
 in Iran contributed to a US misassessment of the
 Shah's staying power. On the other hand, an overreac-
 tion to our problems with predicting the Iranian
 revolution might lead us to misperceive a threat to US
 interests resulting from Islamic resurgence. In most
 cases, governments probably will continue to co-opt

 The Middle. East:
 Crisis at the Epicenter
 The Islamic revival has had its greatest impact in the
 Middle East, the birthplace of Islam. In its radical
 fundamentalist forms, it provides a divinely inspired
 Islamic answer to the social dislocations of modern-
 ization. In states where religious expression is inextri-
 cably associated with political action, moreover, Is-
 lamic radicalism and militancy are paths for social
 change. Petroleum wealth has added to the equa-
 tion-as both the engine of rapid modernization and
 In foreign relations, Islam provides the cement bind-
 ing disparate societies together in their rhetorical, if
 not actual, conflict with the Jewish state of Israel in
 their midst. Common Islamic bonds intensify the
 Middle Eastern fixation on the Palestinian dilemma.
 Despite these bonds, Islamic unity is perennially
 wracked by the region's theological variations of
 fundamentalist belief, variations that have led from
 Two nations in the Middle East can claim to be
 genuinely fundamentalist. Saudi Arabia, a tribal
 kingdom ruled by the Saud family, which united with
 the religious hierarchy a century ago, contains the
 holiest shrines of Islam, proclaims the Shariah as its
 legal system, and, using its oil wealth, has attempted
 to influence other Muslim nations with its version of
 fundamentalist principles. The second, Iran, is not
 Arab but underwent a revolution in 1979, which is
 considered by all experts to be by far the most serious
 Islamic movement of the 20th century. The successful
 Shia assumption of political power, wrested by the
 masses from an entrenched autocrat and powerful
 military, has evolved into a theocracy that continues
 to attempt to influence and destabilize neighboring
 Muslim states{
 The religious policies of most other regimes in the
 region range from orthodox to modernist, seeking
 policies by which the leadership can retain political
 power yet accommodate, co-opt, and even coerce the
 common religion. Jordan and Egypt have set out
 ambitious modernization plans, heavily dependent on
 Saudi and US financial aid, while the rulers empha-
 size their Islamic credentials and fully support "estab-
 lishment" Islam. The lesser Gulf monarchies, starting
 from the basis of highly traditional and underdevel-
 oped societies, are heavily dependent on foreigners for
 technological advancement, which makes them vul-
 nerable to militant Islam and its rejection of the West.
 Within the last few years, these rulers have tried to
 balance Westernization with traditional values by
 stricter enforcement of Islam's social and ethical
 codes and increased linkages with other Muslim
 states. North Yemen has proclaimed itself an Islamic
 Arab socialist republic but has had only marginal
 success at mixing modernization with traditional
 The Arab secular regimes, which have never recog-
 nized Islam as a basis for government-the Ba'thist
 socialists of Syria and Iraq, the embattled regime of
 divided and war-torn Lebanon, and Marxist South 25X1
 Yemen-all face in varying degrees the threat of
 politicized Islam undermining their unpopular
 Ideological failures and a crisis of legitimacy continue
 to provide fertile ground for Islamic militancy
 throughout the region. Shaped by the postcolonial
 demarcations of foreign powers, without genuine wars
 of independence to hone true nationalism, most Mid-
 dle Eastern countries are searching for an identity to
 match their cultural roots. Most reformist political
 trends-Islamic socialism, Arab nationalism, Marx-
 ism-have failed to bring about lasting peace and
 stability. To increasing numbers of youth (more than
 half of the populations of almost all countries are
 under 20), Islamic ideals are appealing. Radical revo-
 lutionary criticism of the country's leadership and its
 hypocrisy, corruption, failure to spread the wealth,
 and inability to bring about social justice is increas-
 ing. Since political channels of expression are few in
 states that are either monarchical, authoritarian, or
 feudal, opposition isincreasin ly expressed in reli-

 Young activists who see deep-rooted Islamic values
 being challenged or abandoned by their rulers are

 ? It was a Third World victory in which both super-

 ? Regardless of its subsequent tarnish theologically, it
 was an Islamic victory after decades of defeat in the

 Consequently, most Arab nations have rated "funda-

 curity threats. Arab calls for militant unity against
 Israel and solutions for Palestine remain popular, but

 Secret
 Religious Policies of Government: Secular govern-
 ment. President Nasir subordinated the role of the
 ulema, reduced their power and wealth by making
 them civil servants, secularized religious courts, and
 banned the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood. The
 military defeat by Israel in 1967 resulted in a popular
 revival of religion among Egyptians. In 1970 Sadat
 took political advantage of this trend by supporting
 Islamic fundamentalists to counter leftist influence in
 government and among youth. The government con-
 tinued its sponsorship of official forms of Islam,
 extensive mosque building, and co-opting the religious
 hierarchy until September 1981 when Sadat sharply
 reduced his tolerance for fundamentalism and ordered
 massive arrests of extremist leaders. Mubarak has
 continued official ban of Islamic radicals but main-
 tains a truce with the Muslim Brotherhood. He has
 also moved to install moderates in religious institu-
 tions and to improve strained relations with other
 Muslim states caused by the peace treaty with Israel.
 Relation of Islam/Religious Establishment to
 Government: Egypt is the intellectual center of Islam.
 A wide spectrum of Islamic thought exists, and, as a
 result, numerous groups have proliferated. The offi-
 cial Muslim establishment is employed directly or
 dominated by the state and has no separate power
 base. The Grand Shaykh of Al Azhar, a presidential
 appointee, oversees Al Azhar University, the center of
 Islamic intellectual activity. The Ministry for Reli-
 gious Trusts controls the purse strings for both Mus-
 lim and Coptic welfare activities. The Grand Mufti,
 another presidential appointee, is theoretically highest
 authority on Islamic law but performs largely ceremo-
 nial role. Both are highly esteemed moderates. The
 relatively moderate fundamentalist Muslim Brother-
 Status of Fundamentalism: Religious revival has gone
 on in Egypt sporadically in the 20th century. Latest
 revival opposed Sadat's liberal social and economic
 policies and has strong antiregime flavor that appears
 destined to affect any government's future social and
 economic policies. Islamic fundamentalism finds par-
 ticular appeal among educated youth, both urban and
 rural, and is even common in the lower levels of
 Fundamentalist Organizations: There are two major
 moderate organizations and a large number of ex-
 tremist offshoots that have gone underground:
 ? Muslim Brotherhood (MB): Egypt's earliest Islamic
 fundamentalist organization, has evolved from early
 radicalism of 1930s into a moderate organization
 dedicated to development of an Islamic state. Mem-
 bership is estimated at 500,000; organization ap-
 pears tight and disciplined; name of nominal leader
 is Umar Talmasana. MB is banned but unofficially
 tolerated because it poses no threat to government.
 ? Jama'iyat al-Shari'ah (Legal Society): A smaller,
 moderate offshoot from Muslim Brotherhood which
 Extremist Groups: They range from small groups of
 less than 100 to groups up t6 5,000 strong. All      25X1
 advocate violent overthrow of the government. Mem-
 bership is drawn mostly from young professionals and
 students. Activities range from pamphleteering to
 violent confrontations with Coptic Christian minority.
 The following is a partial list of known groups:
 ? Al-Taktir Wa al-Hijrah (Repentance and Holy
 Flight).
 ? Al-Jihad (Holy Struggle).
 ? Al-Jihad al-Jadid (The New Holy Struggle): The
 name of an umbrella organization of radicals who
 assassinated President Sadat. Most members arrest-
 ed, some executed.
 ? Hizb al-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Liberation Party)
 with its youth wing, Shabab Muhammad (Youth of
 Muhammad), is part of a multistate network found-
 ed in 1948 and dedicated to establishing a caliphate
 in Islamic countries. Clandestine, underground
 group whose leadership in Egypt was arrested.

 Government: The government is run by clerics who are
 divided along theological, political, geographic, gener-

 clerics who support Ayatollah Khomeini's regime are
 divided roughly into three groups: the Line-of-the-
 Imam (Khat-elman) and Hojatieh factions and oppor-
 tunists like Assembly Speaker Rafsanjani, who are
 not firmly affiliated with either group. Other senior
 ayatollahs oppose the Khomeini regime in varying
 degrees, but they have been outmaneuvered by
 Khomeini's supporters. The Islamic Republic Party

 faction favoring strict Islamic law, use of Western

 favors good relations with the USSR, centralized

 theological capital who maintain links to clerics
 throughout the country.
 Foreign Involvement: Foreign involvement in Iran by

 Relation ofIslam/Religious Establishment to

 Foreign Involvement: Iranians continue to try to
 subvert Shins in Eastern Province. Saudi Arabia is, on
 the other hand, heavily involved in other countries as
 the original exporter of Islam (in a conservative
 version) to the less developed world. It is the founder
 of the Muslim World League, the Islamic Conference,
 and the World Association of Muslim Youth. The
 government uses its wealth to encourage and some-
 times press other Islamic states to institute more
 conservative social and political measures and to
 promote solidarity against leftist movements and
 Israel. It provides sanctuary to Muslim Brotherhood
 members exiled from other Middle Eastern countries.
 Recent Developments:
 ? November 1979: Attack on the Great Mosque in
 Mecca, the holiest Islamic shrine, by antiregime,
 radical fundamentalist youth. Government forces
 recaptured the Mosque after two weeks of fighting
 and executed 30 militants, both Saudis and
 foreigners.

 by the numerically dominant urban Sunnis as a
 vehicle to undermine rule by what they consider to be
 a small, rural heretical minority of Alawitesl
 Fundamentalist Organizations:
 ? Muslim Brotherhood (MB): Spread from Egypt in
 1940s; fought for independence against French;
 then fought against secularism and Westernization;
 outlawed during Syrian union with Egypt, 1958-61;
 reappeared in late 1970s to early 1980 in more
 militant role; it stepped up opposition tactics and
 tried to assassinate Assad; it was again forced
 underground in 1980. MB is the principal source of
 antiregime activity. Many MB members went into
 exile to neighboring Arab states and Europe. Mem-
 bership is concentrated among Sunni students and
 merchants.

 offshoot of the MB. It wants an Islamic republic

 Government: Republic founded in 1923 after the
 collapse of the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Mustafa
 Kemal (Ataturk), the first President, turned country
 into Western, secular, one-party state. He died in
 1938. Civilian and military governments have alter-

 over the government in 1980. President Gen. Kenan
 Evren held legislative elections in November 1983,
 signaling another return to "civilian" rule.F_
 Religious Policies tf Government: Ataturk radically
 altered the role of Islam in Turkey by converting a
 Muslim society into a secular state. He smashed the
 Shariah courts; abolished the Sufi brotherhoods, the
 caliphate, and Muslim schools; and replaced Arabic
 with Turkish and Muslim dress with Western garb.

 Maghreb:
 The Arab Edge of Africa
 Until a few years ago, Islam was a moderate unifying
 force along the northern tier of Africa, where regimes
 range in ideology from the traditional Islamic Repub-
 lic of Mauritania to Libya's "Islamic Socialism" to
 avowedly secular Tunisia. Since then, fundamentalist
 Islam has taken root, especially among the urbanized
 middle-class youth, and is causing increasing security
 problems for three of the five sovereign Maghreb
 states-Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. The other
 two, Libya and Mauritania, are ruled by military

 independence and autonomy by electing a new

 a small pro-Soviet intellectual group, to make it the,
 officially sanctioned opposition for the late 1981

 against fundamentalist leader Ghodbani and rumors

 Islam in South Asia:
 Faith Without Fervor
 South Asia, with nearly 300 million Muslims, about
 three times as many as in the entire Arab heartland,
 has witnessed a perceptible upswing in revival of
 personal piety, some governmental tolerance and even
 encouragement of Islamic ritual observances, but no
 significant role for Islamic fundamentalism outside of
 President Zia's "Islamization" experiment in Paki-
 stan. Several reasons are behind this lack of Islamic
 militancy:
 of oil wealth has precluded modernization on the
 scale of most other Islamic countries. The issue of
 Islamic traditionalism versus Westernized moderni-
 ty and its attendant debasement of Islamic values
 has not evolved.                          25X1
 Not only has fundamentalism failed to become a
 major political force in most of South Asia, in many
 respects it has been more divisive than unifying.
 ? Politically and geographically, the region is domi-
 nated by India, the second most populous nation in
 the world and overwhelmingly Hindu. In most states
 of the subcontinent, secularism and nationalism
 take precedence over religious beliefs among the
 people. Islamic fundamentalism has been unable to
 inspire resistance to forms of political control-
 whether military or civilian-which continue to
 restrain and sometimes restrict oppositionist
 movement.
 ? Culturally, Islam was superimposed by Muslim
 conquerors on ancient beliefs among populations
 whose cultural identities remain tied to ethnic and
 tribal loyalties predating the arrival of Islam in the
 eighth century. The resulting religious and cultural
 diversity has worked against a cohesive Islamic
 fundamentalist movement. Linguistically, the sub-
 continent is a mosaic of non-Arabic languages that
 have accentuated the ethnic differences. The sense
 of umma, a larger Islamic community transcending
 national boundaries and united by the shared use of
 the Arabic language, is missing. Pakistan's breakup
 in 1971 demonstrated this weakness in South Asia.
 ? Economically, South Asia's poverty is not conducive
 to fundamentalist activity. Overall, per capita in-
 come is only 2 percent of Saudi Arabia's, 6 percent
 of the average for the entire Arab heartland. Large-
 ly illiterate peasant farmers eking out a meager
 subsistence have little time-or inclination-for re-
 ligious agitation. The lack of wealth may, at least
 according to some academic theories, limit the
 funds to spawn Islamic activism. Moreover, the lack
 ? In Pakistan no consensus exists as to what an
 "Islamic state" should be. This problem, which has
 dogged the nation since its birth, helped cause a civil
 war and eventual dismemberment of the country
 and still hinders efforts to attain national integra-
 tion. Zia's "Islamization" program, intended to
 convert Pakistan into a purer version of an "Islamic
 state," has even contributed to destabilizing sectari-
 an strife between Sunnis and Shias and may be a
 contributing factor to the disturbances in Sind
 Province.
 ? In Afghanistan, Islam has been so integral a part of
 society that, until the Communist coup in 1978 and
 the Soviet invasion in 1979, the country had not
 been touched by the politicization of Islam. After
 the Soviet invasion, resistance groups rallied under
 an Islamic banner, although even Islam has been
 unable to unite the disparate and mutually hostile
 tribes. None of the champions of Islamic unity
 (Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Iran) have openly mobi-
 lized support for the resistance fighters.
 ? In India recurrent communal strife, including Hin-
 du-Muslim confrontations, threaten to undo Prime
 Minister Gandhi's skillful and sustained political

 Pakistan President Zia presses
 ahead with Islamization poll-
 President Zia is restructuring Pakistan to conform to
 his version of an Islamic state. He also uses Islam to
 legitimitize military rule and to justify banning all
 political party activity.-Governmentally decreed Is-
 lamization includes: return of hudud (stoning, flog-
 ging, amputation) punishment; Islamic prohibitions
 such as ban on alcohol, night clubs, Western dress by
 government workers, gambling; Shariah form of legal
 system; revision of textbooks; compulsory zakat tax;
 Islamic banking system; and curtailment of women's
 Relation ofIslam/Religious Establishment to
 Government: Zia's appointed legislative body, the
 Federal Advisory Council, is dominated by religious
 figures but has no authority. The Islamic Ideology
 Council (IIC), comprised of fundamentalists, recom-
 mends measures (often revolutionary and radical) to
 steer the country toward a more Islamic course, but
 its recommendations are not binding on Zia. Jamaat-
 i-Islami (JI), a semiautonomous political force with
 deeply fundamentalist values, has links to the govern-
 ment, influences labor affairs, student activity, and
 refugee affairs and is used as an informal link with
 other Islamic states. Mainline Muslim clergy, al-

 Fundamentalist Organizations: Jamaat-i-Islami, a 25X1
 former fundamentalist political party founded in the
 1930s by Maulana Abdul Maudoodi, dominates the
 fundamentalist scene. It is now headed by Mian
 Tufail Mohammad, a distant relative of President
 Zia. It has a membership of several thousand, but
 active sympathizers and supporters may number I
 million. It appeals to middle- and lower-class mer-
 chants, civil servants, students, and mullahs. Its youth
 wing, Islami Jamaat Tulaba (IJT), provided the
 shock troops to begin the agitation that toppled
 Bhutto and remain militant radicals who have great
 influence on college campus organizations. Nonpoliti-
 cal fundamentalist organizations also abound, most
 important of which include:
 ? Ahl-e-Hadis (People of the Traditions): Most puri-
 tanical of Islamic sects; it has had members on both
 the Islamic Ideology Council and the Federal Advi-
 sory Council.
 ? Nadvis (The Association): It seeks moderate course

 Recent Developments:

 relented and exempted them from payment.

 Prognosis: Zia's vision of Islamization is not matched
 by the realities of his society, which still suffers an
 identity crisis, troubled by regional rivalries and
 increasing sectarian conflict. Zia is beset by opposi-

 has compromised too much in Islamic terms, and by
 the remnants of the Westernized elite and the socialist
 left who see his Islamization as nothing but an excuse
 for military rule. Unless he can bring real economic
 benefits to the lower and middle classes and avoid

 death and injuries. The government quickly imposed
 a state of emergency and press censorship.

 years evolved from Tamil terrorist attacks. During

 Southeast Asia and Islam:
 A Secondary Force
 Islam, practiced in Southeast Asia by either a major-
 ity or an entrenched minority in all countries, cannot
 compete with nationalism as the preeminent political
 force. Independence from Western colonial powers
 created a series of states propelled by a sense of
 national identity. The majority established secular
 forms of government that provided for religious ex-
 pression but excluded the clerical establishment from
 About 200 million Muslims live in the region. The
 range of Islamic fervor ranges from sporadic armed
 resistance to the central government (in southern
 Thailand, the southern Philippines, northern Sumatra
 in Indonesia, and border areas in Burma) to newly
 independent Brunei, which, until January 1984, had
 been one of the world's few remaining sultanates.
 Despite this overall religious enthusiasm, Malaysia is
 the only state where fundamentalism has influenced
 the government to modify its domestic policies to
 accommodate Islamic sensitivities and to actively
 Throughout the region, resurgence of personal piety
 has been widespread among Muslims since the Irani-
 an revolution-and the injection of Middle Eastern
 petrodollars-and is found in all social groups, partic-
 ularly among the young. As a social phenomenon, the
 revival is growing among those states with Muslim
 majorities (Indonesia and Malaysia). Even in two key
 states where the Muslims are a troublesome minority
 (Thailand and the Philippines), the government has
 had to adopt a series of cosmetic measures to demon-
 strate its tolerance of the minority's religious beliefs.
 Islam also is a key destabilizing force among the
 ethnic groups of Southeast Asia, where communal
 disturbances often have roots in tensions between
 Muslims and non-Muslims, usually the Chinese mi-
 nority. Tensions between Malaysia and both the
 Philippines and Thailand continue over alleged Ma-
 laysian assistance to Muslim insurgent groups. In
 newly independent Brunei, a quiet exodus of the
 Chinese professional class is going on in anticipation
 that. anti-Chinese feelings may erupt into confronta-
 tion or, at a minimum, increased discrimination
 against non-Muslims. Burma's new minority laws, on
 the other hand, discriminate against Muslims and
 Governments of the region have so far suppressed the
 resistance of Muslim secessionist groups-Thailand's 25X1
 new policy of "Peace in the South," Marcos's manipu-
 lation of a badly fragmented Moro (Muslim) secession
 movement, and Soeharto's virtual elimination of Mus-
 lim rebels seeking greater autonomy in northern
 Sumatra. Few of the rebellions have gained signifi-
 cant assistance from the international Muslim com-
 munity except for rhetorical support in Islamic Con-
 ference gatherings. Regional internal security forces
 have cooperated to cut off funds, arms shipments, and
 rebel leader movements, although they cannot stem
 the flow of some youths going abroad for trainin in
 the radical Middle Eastern states.                25X1
 With the exception of Malaysia, all states in the
 region are pursuing secular policies designed to ensure
 rapid economic development. The models range from
 an outright love feast with Western capitalism in
 Singapore, to authoritarian mixed economies in Indo-
 nesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, to Burma's inept
 and uneven march to socialism, and to the Communist

 The two Muslim majority states have dealt with
 politicized Islam in diametrically different fashions.
 Indonesia, numerically the world's largest Muslim    25X1
 state, has been depoliticized under the 19-year rule of
 ex-General Soeharto in the name of stability and
 economic development. In three successive national
 elections, Muslim parties have received close to 30
 percent of the vote, yet Soeharto has not allowed
 meaningful political participation by them. Instead,
 he has co-opted the Muslim establishment, built

 In Malaysia, where the politically preeminent Malays
 barely outnumber the Chinese, the largely ethnic
 issue of Malayanization of government is inextricably
 linked with Islam. When Mahathir bin Mohamad
 became Prime Minister in 1981, he embarked on a
 program of institutionalizing Islam throughout society
 which has created a curious coexistence of personal,
 social Islamic revival, government-sponsored ortho-
 doxy, and the constant threat of communal break-
 down. To quiet fundamentalist demands of a strident
 minority party of rural Malays, he co-opted into a
 government post the most popular leader of a Muslim
 youth group with mass appeal. The result has been a
 split between the old-guard orthodox Muslims and the
 frustrated fundamentalists.

 Fundamentalist Organizations:
 ? Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF): Separat-

 for a Muslim autonomous region. It was formed in
 the 1960s from numerous armed bandit gangs.
 Armed strength currently estimated by the govern-
 ment at 12,000 to 17,000 but largely inactive.
 Movement is on the decline because of combat
 losses and loss of the international support that it
 had in the mid-1970s. Exile leader Nur Misuari
 claims to head movement, although his claim is
 contested by other rebels, some of whom are more
 willing to negotiate with Marcos for limited
 autonomy.
 Recent Developments:
 ? January 1979: Marcos held elections as way to
 fulfill 1976 agreement to grant more autonomy to
 Muslim regions. MNLF boycotted elections.

 to relocate 30,000 Muslims in south.

 Sub-Saharan Africa:
 Mostly Moderate Islam
 In Africa 27 countries outside the Arab-dominated
 northern tier contain approximately 120 million Mus-
 lims, ranging up to 100 percent in Somalia. The
 remaining Sub-Saharan African nations outside our
 survey contain only negligible Muslim populations,
 usually non-African immigrants.
 The forms of African Islam are almost as wide
 ranging as the percentages. Devotees of mystic Sufism
 intertwined with pre-Islamic animism prevail in the
 region, while, at the other extreme, a vocal minority
 of Muslims in Nigeria are strongly influenced by
 militant fundamentalism. Although the political voice
 of Islam is generally weak and fundamentalists are a
 tiny minority of all Muslims in the region, a limited
 Islamic revival is under way in several states.F_~

 Status of Fundamentalism: Following the Iranian
 revolution, Shia fundamentalism gained greater sup-
 port in the Colored community, especially among
 university and secondary school students. Pro-Kho-
 meini rallies were held at the Universities of Cape
 Town and Western Cape in February 1980. The
 Muslim News took an increasingly pro-Khomeini and

 against government reforms that gave political
 rights to Coloreds and Indians but not to Africans.

 banned in 1969. Leader Sadiq al-Mahdi, jailed and
 exiled several times since 1969, returned from self-
 imposed exile in September 1982. Sadiq and several
 top aides were arrested in September 1983 after he
 made statements critical of the government.

 at least 100,000. Led by Hasan al-Turabi; elitist,
 urban based. MB espouses a gradualist approach to

 Foreign Involvement: Saudis have actively bankrolled
 the government, while Libya's Qadhafi has sworn to

 Islam in the Communist States:
 A Policy of Accommodation
 Orthodox Communist doctrine theoretically clashes
 head-on with an organized religion such as Islam.
 Despite the incompatibility, however; pockets of Mus-
 lims (overt and clandestine) persist in many Commu-
 nist states. Muslims or direct descendants of Muslims
 total about 80 million throughout the Communist
 world. They range from about 3 percent of China's
 population to approximately 70 percent of Albania's.
 Most Communist governments have adopted an ac-
 commodative policy toward their Muslim minorities
 after years of experimenting with both assimilative
 and sometimes brutally repressive policies. Most of
 them allow Muslims to continue the social practices of
 ritual Islam, perhaps because they cannot entirely
 stamp out those practices and would risk radicalized
 resistance if they did. Both the USSR and China have
 co-opted the Muslim establishment and avoid direct
 interference in Islamic practices. Albania remains the
 major exception to an accommodative approach as it
 continues its unique status as a totally atheistic state
 that represses all religious practice.)
 With the exception of Albania, Communist states
 supervise their Muslim minorities by installing official
 Islamic hierarchies that have limited political power
 and by restricting the number of mosques, Muslim
 schools, and religious teachers so that, so far as
 possible, the Muslim populace is sheltered from the
 theological revival elsewhere in the Muslim world.fl
 Relations with other Muslim (principally Arab) states
 and fears of internal dissent or civil unrest have been
 major factors in this accommodation. Both China and
 the Soviet Union seek influence and trade among the
 oil-rich Arab states and try to outdo each other in
 professing tolerance now that their own revolutions
 are reaching middle age. In Yugoslavia and Bulgaria
 the governments continue to manipulate their reli-
 gious establishments to gain credibility among the
 Muslim states and to stimulate more trade and aid.fl
 The major risk that these accommodative practices
 might incur is that the Muslim minorities may one
 day agitate for more autonomy. So far, there are only
 a few faint clues that a clandestine religious revival is
 spreading among the Muslim minorities of the Com-
 munist countries, and this "revival" is probably more
 a reaction by ethnic minorities to preserve their
 identities against unsympathetic rulers than a legiti?25X1

 granted the minorities more freedom under a cultural
 autonomy policy. It reversed this policy in the 1970s
 and renewed harassment and persecution. Currently,
 the government tends to ignore the Muslims as an
 unassimilated minority, although it uses Muslim
 Turks as pawns in bilateral relations with Turkey.
 Although constitutionally protected, the Muslims re-

 to category of "Muslim" nationality. In the 1970s the

 nonaligned credentials and to get favor of Middle

 Egypt), it built new mosques, financed education of
 youth overseas in Muslim countries, and in 1979 also
 built a Muslim theological college in Sarajevo. Islam-

 supplement secular education. By Communist stand-

 Islam in the Western Hemisphere:
 Backwater Bastion
 Islam has never played a significant role on the
 political scene in the tiny nations that make up the
 Caribbean and line the northern tier of Latin Ameri-

 Javanese plantation workers, although a few are

 The last few years have seen the first glimmerings of a
 connection between the Middle East and the region as
 the small island and coastal countries have sought
 economic aid to stave off bankruptcy. They have had
 no takers among the moderate Arab countries. Only

 own goals. It has sought to establish "Islamic Cultural
 Centers" throughout the region in an effort to attract
 radical youth and establish a base from which to
 mount anti-American campaigns. The results of these
