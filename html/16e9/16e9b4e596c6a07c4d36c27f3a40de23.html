 National Intelligence Officers
 I want to express my appreciation for your response to our
 invitation to address participants at a symposium on Japan in April.
 As I noted over the phone, our intent is to use the conference
 and the report taken therefrom to assist Community analysts and
 desk officers in projecting lines of research and analysis on Japan
 over the next few years.
 Please note from the attached program that you are scheduled
 to speak during lunch on 11 April.   I am sure your comments will
 inspire a good deal.of interest and hope you might allow time to
 take a few questions.   Clearly, your views and your assessment of
 how the Congress would characterize the status and prospects for
 the alliance with Japan will contribute in an important way to the
 quality of the discussion.

 Dear Evelyn:
 Herewith is the study on Soviet fisheries activities in the
 South Pacific which you wanted way back last December.   I am afraid
 it is a bit thin, but I suppose this represents the sum total of
 whatever new information we have obtained since the previous study
 on this same

 MIgnt require more resources than we care to commit at this time.
 apologies for the delay -- she has been assi ned

 Thank you for your letter of 11 March informing me of the
 part I will play in the 12 April schedule.   I am looking forward
 very much to this session and I am sure it will prove to be
 very stimulating.
 Concerning your suggestion that I might wish to offer a
 commentary on the address by General Jones, I am sure that my
 comments would be rather redundant -- as an active member of the
 US Government, I could hardly add to the points General Jones
 would be making.  Perhaps you might wish to have someone who is
 not part of the US Government assume this role.
 I will see if I can obtain a photo for you.

 ASEAN REACTIONS TO EVENTS IN INDOCHINA AND AFGHANISTAN
 1.  ASEAN has shown remarkable unity over past few years in
 face of crisis in Indochina.  ASEAN's main concern now:  preserve
 unity as result of changing -- and sometimes differing -- perceptions
 of threat to regional security.
 2.  ASEAN states collectively now view Soviets, plus Soviet-
 backed Vietnam, as emerging, alternative threat.   Recent ASEAN-EEC
 Foreign Ministers meeting communique strongly worded at ASEAN
 insistence:   Specifically links Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to
 Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and thus stronger wording than
 ASEAN-sponsored resolution in UN last Fall.
 3.   However, Malaysia and Indonesia retain strong reservations
 re chief threat.   Because of important domestic Chinese populations,
 seen as internal security threat, Malaysia and Indonesia perceive
 China as principal long-term danger.   Visceral anti-Chinese sentiments
 in both countries will remain for foreseeable future, although this
 at present balanced (but not replaced) by anti-Soviet feelings by
 Muslim populations.   Some Malaysian and Indonesian leaders still
 feel that a strong Indochina,  dominated by Vietnam, is a necessary
 buffer to Chinese expansionism if it isn't hostile to ASEAN.
 4.   Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines, on the other hand,
 are not so concerned with China and see Soviets, plus Vietnam, as
 chief threat.   Thailand, of course, has already tilted towards China
 over Vietnamese presence in Kampuchea; this worries Malaysia and
 Indonesia who fear if Thailand tilts too far might jeopardize ASEAN
 unity, invite superpower intervention in region.  President Marcos has
 become much more direct in faulting the Soviets for producing the crisis
 in Kampuchea; more recently, in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of
 Afghanistan, he has linked the importance of the Philippine bases to
 an expanded US military role in Southwest Asia.   Ironically, Marcos'
 expressions of support have been followed by a $5 million cut in
 in security assistance voted.by HFAC.
 5.   Thus ASEAN defense and foreign policies in process of
 transition:  Wants to retain strong US presence in area (especially
 after Afghanistan) as deterrent.  US role central to preservation of
 ASEAN unity: military/econ aid to build up ASEAN defenses, help with
 massive refugee problem, and in general maintain confidence.   But
 ASEAN ambivalent re US:
 -- US needs to reestablish credibility as durable and consistent
 deterrent.  ASEAN sees diminution of bilateral programs over past few
 years (FINS, MAP, PL480 grain shipments), plus human rights criticism,
 as reflecting lack of US interest in region.  ASEAN also suspects US
 weak in military power, perhaps unable to project massive power overseas
 ASEAN leaders question, for instance, whether US could come to aid in

 event of emergency in SEAsia if US involved simultaneously in conflict
 elsewhere.  Any extended drawdown of US forces in Pacific to
 strengthen forces in Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean would confirm these
 suspicions.
 -- Moreover, Malaysia and Indonesia are active members of 3rd
 World groups like Non-Aligned Movement, Group of 77.   Both want to
 maintain non-aligned credentials.   Both have important Muslim
 populations, so especially reluctant to do anything to jeopardize
 relations with Muslim countries of Middle East.   Fearful that US
 might get involved in conflict there (i.e., Iran) -- this would
 severely strain their relations with US and perhaps give domestic
 anti-government Muslim extremists opportunity to exploit situation.
 -- All ASEAN states have lucrative trade with Soviets.  Don't
 want to impair this.  Also some may believe that Soviet dependence
 on SEAsian primary commodities (rubber, tin etc) might act as brake
 on Soviet adventurism.
 6.  ASEAN thus not unified on best means to meet new emerging
 Soviet/VN threat.  Not even willing to turn itself into explicit
 defense grouping lest this might provoke VN.  Will only cooperate
 with US in way acceptable to all ASEAN members and will not 'go out
 front' for fear or US drawback from present strong stand.   Certainly
 ASEAN as group doesn't seek explicit defense links to US (Thailand
 and Philippines already have these of course) but will seek large
 amounts military/econ aid to bolster own defenses, and might consider
 joint defense exercises with US on bilateral basis, plus intelligence
 exchanges.   Individual states -- Thailand, Singapore, Philippines
 --
 might offer facilities to US in event of emergency but outside of
 ASEAN rubric.
 7.  ASEAN perspectives not static.  Reluctant to cooperate
 explicitly with US on defense and to form itself into defense
 grouping. Could change it
 -- Hanoi invades Thailand
 -- Soviets get permanent warm-water base in VN and thereafter
 built up forces in region.
 8.  Despite conflicting pressures and potential disagreements,
 ASEAN has held together remarkably well as a political institution.
 It has publicly maintained a united front on the Kampuchean issue,
 and recently unanimously condemned the USSR both for its encouragement
 of. the SRV and for Afghanistan.   This public unanimity (despite
 private indications of differences in perspective) is more than we
 would have predicted a year ago.

 The following items were discussed by the Community Repre
 1.   Analysts expressed the view that the recent party plenum
 had provided a stable basis for further development (particularly
 economic) in China:  Some analysts noted that there were still
 outstanding political problems to be overcome, but there was a general
 consensus that although troublesome, none of these problems -- that
 of dealing with recalcitrant bureaucracy was particularly stressed --
 was insurmountable, or at least uncontainable. The question of
 succession to the present leadership was also addressed.  All analysts
 agreed that Deng Xiaoping had done very well in putting his supporters
 into key positions, and most believed that Hua Guofeng had at the same
 time lost ground.   Deng was now likely to have greater latitude in
 pushing his programs. r
 2.   After some discussion, analysts generally concluded that
 the Sino-Soviet border remained quiet -- some thought exceptionally
 quiet -- and that there had been little discernible movement in any
 direction in Sino-Soviet relations.   Soviet command and control

 that the US was prepared to sell military equipment to China.
 Moreover, while Moscow had not moved any military units away from

 3.  Participants in the meeting generally concluded that China
 was worried but not panicked by the situation regarding Pakistan.
 They noted that there were indications that the Chinese had run into
 problems parallel with those the US faced in its relations with
 Islamabad. From the Chinese perspective the situation in both
 Pakistan and Afghanistan seemed to be dangerous but not critical, and
 most analysts believed that the Chinese would act cautiously as the
 situation developed.   Reference was made to the scheduled visit of
 a Chinese military delegation to Pakistan, but ability of the Chinese
 Chinese approach to the Indochina question.   There continued to be
 no sign that Beijing was preparing to initiate major hostilities
 along the Vietnamese border or the border with Laos; the Chinese
 seemed to continue in a holding pattern, hoping that time would work
 for their advantage.  Although most analysts felt that the weather
 would not be a major factor along those borders until late summer,
 all agreed that once the rainy season in western Kampuchea began the
 odds on a Chinese attack this year would fall still further.   There
 was some discussion of the Soviet naval combatants now gathered off
 Vietnam, but while there were differences among analysts as to
 whether or not these ships were primarily meant to reassure Hanoi
 or were related to US naval moves in the Indian Ocean, there was
 unanimous agreement that their presence off Vietnam was not
 particularly ominous at this juncture.  A fuller report on the
 Soviet military presence in Vietnam was requested for the next
 meeting. III

 5.  Analysts generally agree that there had been no major change
 in the overall situation in the past month.   The famous Vietnamese
 offensive in Western Kampuchea still had not taken place, and most
 analysts thought it unlikely that any such offensive would occur this
 year.  Analysts noted with interest in this connection that the

 Vietnamese appeared to be building defensive positions in the area.
 Some thought this might be preparatory to new sweep operations but
 all agreed that the season was getting late for a major offensive.
 There was general agreement that the Pol Pot forces remained much
 stronger than had been expected at this point in the dry season;
 several analysts noted that the DK forces were likely to enter the
 rainy season no weaker than they had been when the dry season began.
 LI
 6.   There was considerable exploration of possible reasons for the
 relative Vietnamese quiescence.  One possible explanation was that the
 Soviets had not offered expected support, but the evidence for this
 was inconclusive.   The best clue pointing to this explanation was
 the temporary stand down on Soviet support flights within Indochina,
 which began at the time of the Afghan invasion; flights had been
 resumed but on a less extensive scale.
