 The security situation in Iran is deteriorating
 rapidly.   Iranian press reports indicate that there have
 been clashes in Tehran, Tabriz and Qazvin between forces
 Zo aZ to the Bazar an government and various opponents.
 //The attack on the US Embassy yesterday was the work
 of a radical leftist terrorist group, the Chariks, ac-
 cording to fragmentary reports.   They have denied respon-
 sibility but the sophistication of the operation suggests
 they were involved.   Prime Minister Bazargan told the
 British Ambassador that the attack was clearly aimed at
 undermining the authority of his government, but he did
 not identify the attackers.//F                                   I   25X1
 I                          Ireported considerable fighting in
 the capital yesterday; at one point, Tehran radio briefly
 reported that it was under attack and appealed to
 Ayatollah Khomeini's forces to defend it.   In Tabriz, the
 government radio station reported fighting between                   25X1
 Khomeini supporters and former employees of the security
 forces and other alleged monarchists.
 In addition to coping with the breakdown in secu-
 rity, the Bazargan government will test its ability to
 restart the economy on Saturday, when both Khomeini and
 Bazargan have called on workers to return to their jobs
 and end their "strikes,  resistance, and deprivations."
 In the critical oil sector, however, the new govern-
 ment is likely to have great difficulty resuming produc-
 tion for export because of the resistance of entrenched
 radical leftists.   Some workers--particularly in the
 public sector--have grown accustomed to receiving pay-
 checks without doing any work.   Others will be forced out
 of their jobs because of curtailed operations or be
 forced out of business entirely following months of fuel
 shortages, bank closures, and non-delivery of essential
 imported goods.

 nese could attack at any time.   Moreover,  with the re-
 turn of Vice Premier  (and Chief of Staff) Deng Xiaoping
 to China,  some political restraints deriving from his
 presence in the US and Japan have now been removed.
 i-nue to   e zeve  that from a military viewpoint the Chi-
 There remain political,  economic, and military argu-
 ments against an attack.   The Chinese must consider US
 and Japanese advice to exercise restraint, possible So-
 viet reaction,  the demonstrated ability of the Pol Pot
 forces to bleed Vietnam in Kampuchea without direct Chi-
 nese intervention, as well as the impact of major fight-
 ing on Beijing's cherished modernization campaign.   More-
 over, Chinese forces have not engaged in extended combat
 since 1953 and may not be fully efficient.   In the past
 week, a number of Chinese officials have adduced some
 of these factors as reasons for China not to strike
 against Vietnam,  and some of these officials appeared
 to be speaking on foreign ministry guidance.   Neverthe-
 less, Deng Xiaoping himself has repeatedly stated in
 public and in private that Vietnam must be "taught a
 lesson," and this theme was echoed in a Chinese response
 to a US demarche in Beijing on 10 February, which cau-
 tioned against Chinese military action.

 I On balance we believe
 there is about a 60 percent chance that the Chinese will
 in fact attack in res onse to real or contrived provoca-
 tion.
 The size of the buildup on the border suggests if
 the Chinese attack it would be on a scope larger than
 we had originally thought likely--a brief and shallow
 incursion.   The Chinese have a wide range of options
 open to them, beginning with a limited cross border at-
 tack designed to inflict heavy casualties on Vietnamese
 border defense forces.   One likely option would be to
 rout the border forces and drive far enough into Vietnam
 to threaten but not actually attack Hanoi, with a view
 to withdrawal after several weeks.   We cannot exclude an
 attack on the capital itself, but we think this unlikely
 for both political and military reasons  (the Chinese
 probably could not achieve air superiority in the vicin-
 ity of Hanoi).

 We continue to believe that the eventual Soviet
 choice in reacting to any Chinese attack on Vietnam will
 be contingent on the extent and severity of the Chinese
 action and its political effects.   In response to rela-
 tively small-scale and shallow Chinese attacks,  the So-
 viets are likely to restrict their active response to
 Vietnam proper, consulting under the Treaty, making con-
 spicuous deliveries of military assistance,  and probably
 issuing strong warnings.   Against Chinese attacks in the
 middle range--which went so far as to begin to threaten
 Hanoi--the Soviets would increase their aid in Vietnam
 but might in addition mount military demonstrations on
 the Sino-Soviet border,  seize islands in the border
 rivers, or even make quick small raids across the fron-
 tier, all of which they could do without reinforcements.
 25X1
 A severe dilemma would confront them in the event
 of a massive, direct Chinese attack on Hanoi,  the least
 likely Chinese option.   Against such a contingency,  the
 above Soviet measures would not relieve the postulated
 threat to Vietnam and would be perceived by world opin-
 ion as a Soviet failure of nerve.   Even in these extreme
 circumstances,  the Soviets would wish to avoid large-
 scale cross-border ground operations to any substantial
 depth that would risk enmeshing the USSR in protracting
 fighting inside China and might instead consider air
 25X1    attacks.
 In any event,  the Soviets continue to be careful
 not to commit themselves in advance to any particular
 course of action. An authoritative Pravda article of
 10 February on the Chinese buildup was notable for its
 failure to mention the Soviet-Vietnamese treaty or to
 allude to the possibility of a Soviet response if the
 25X1    Chinese attacked Vietnam.

 AFGHANISTAN:   Death of Ambassador Dubs
 The killing of Ambassador Dubs yesterday appears to
 have been incidental to a continuing conflict in Afghan-
 istan between the Soviet-backed regime and its conserva-
 tive Muslim opponents.                                                                                     25X1
 So far, we have no information linking the four ter-
 rorists--now all presumably dead--with a larger dissident
 organization, and we cannot identify the persons the ter-
 rorists demanded be freed in exchange for the Ambassa-
 dor's life.   The Muslim Brotherhood claimed responsibil-
 ity for several assassinations and acts of sabotage last
 year.   At least two Pakistani-based dissident groups are
 said to support continuing unrest by Muslim tribesmen in
 several parts of the country.                                       25X1
 The Afghan Government describes the kidnappers as
 "anarchists" and asserts that the individuals whose re-
 lease was sought were not under detention.   These indivi-
 duals may, however, have been among the approximately
 150 Muslim leaders who were rounded up earlier this
 month.
 The government's refusal to prolong negotiations
 with the terrorists and its decision to ignore US pleas
 to avoid precipitate action may have been intended as a
 warning to the many opponents of the regime.   The police
 chief,  the Deputy Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister
 Hafizullah Amin all refused to talk with Embassy person-
 nel throughout the episode.

 VIETNAM:    Oil Exploration Renewed
 Offshore oil exploration in Vietnam has resumed
 after a four-year hiatus.   Exploration conducted by US
 firms in Zate 1974 indicated commercially exploitable
 oil,   but drilling halted with the coZZapse of South Viet-
 nam in April 1975.   Vietnam hopes oil revenues will
 boost the country's dismal post-1975 economic performance
 and give Hanoi some foreign policy flexibility.
 A group of Canadian companies will probably complete
 its first well. in the South China Sea,  200 miles south of
 Ho Chi Minh City,  in three weeks.   West German and Italian
 firms are likely to begin drilling soon.   Hanoi would
 like US firms to participate, but US law prohibits it.
 Some industry sources believe potential oil reserves
 could eventually lead to a production capacity of 500,000
 to 1 million barrels per day.   Available data do not as
 yet support this high a level.   Even small amounts of ex-
 portable oil could have an impact on Vietnam's economy
 within several years.   If large amounts are discovered,
 Vietnam over the longer run would be able to finance
 a major share of its economic development and reduce its
 25X1     dependence on the USSR.

 PORTUGAL:   Budget Vote
 Prime Minister Mota Pinto's budget may squeak by in
 Parliament today, but the political parties have been
 angered by his insensitive tactics; pressures to oust
 him will continue to grow.                                                  25X1
 Since taking office last December as a prime minister
 independent of any political party, Mota Pinto has upset
 the parties by his determination to move forcefully on
 unpopular economic issues and by his abrasive style.   The
 budget controversy seems more a reflection of the par-                      25X1
 ties' political disenchantment than of their objections
 to the Prime Minister's economic policies.
 Only the Center Democrats seem committed to vote for
 the budget, which means that Mota Pinto must win support
 at least from the Social Democrats to achieve the nec-
 essary simple majority.                                              25X1
 //The Social Democrats are torn between the hardline
 opposition of their party leader, Sa Carneiro, and mod-
 erates, who are sympathetic to the Prime Minister.
 Even if Mota Pinto survives the budget vote, his
 reprieve may be short-lived.   As lower real wages, higher
 taxes, and reduced government services take their toll
 among lower income groups, both the Socialists and Social
 Democrats will see greater political advantage in oppos-  25X1
 ing him.   The temptation to replace Mota Pinto with a
 more innocuous government until after the re ular elec-
 tion in 1980 may become difficult to resist.

 President Amin evidently is coming under increased
 domestic pressure as Tanzania moves its forces farther
 into Uganda.
 25X1                                   icers or   u anese origin--the'
 nucleus of Amin's power base in the army--told Amin re-
 cently they want to quit and go home.   This and other
 reports of disaffection in the Uqandan Army may have
 been triggered by a meeting of military personnel in
 Kampala late last week.   Amin evidently has smoothed
 over his immediate problems with the officers, but they
 may become less cooperative if conditions continue to
 worsen.   Uganda's renewed appeal this week to the UN for
 a Security Council discussion of the border situation
 reflects Amin's efforts to end the conflict without fur-
 ther loss of face.   Despite Ugandan charges of partisan-
 ship by the US and the UK, the Ugandan Foreign Minister
 assured the diplomatic corps in Kampala that US and
 British citizens in Uganda are safe.
 CHILE:   Foreign Investment
 Chile's economy is becoming increasingly attractive
 to foreign investors.   A US firm recently organized a
 consortium of local and international companies to con-
 struct a $130 million ethylene plant in southern Chile--
 the largest foreign investment in Chile since the Pino-
 chet government took power in 1973.   It nearly equals
 the $150 million in direct investments recorded last
 year.   Bank financing for the project has been committed,
 and construction could start within 90 days.   The US
 firm is also eyeing investments in Chile's rapidly ex-
 25X1          panding forestry sector. F7               I

 //Prime Minister Manley's government may be provoking

 the murder and has called for an independent investiga-

 The attack on the US Embassy in Tehran yesterday
 dramatically illustrated the growing power of the left
 in Iran.   There is no one organization of the  left and
 its  leadership is largely anonymous.   The leftists have
 long drawn much of their support from students and are
 usually highly dedicated.   In some cases,  they operate
 in well-organized clandestine groups.
 The left has been very active in recruitina  war
 in the oilfields.
 Founded in 1971 as an outgrowth of earlier Marxist
 guerrilla organizations, the Chariks have long engaged
 in attacks on Iranian police stations  and  aar-iai- +., ,-.o,.--
 In the early 1970s, the Chariks cooperated with the
 Islamic terrorist group known as the People's Strugglers
 or Mujahiddin, which is cl     y tied to Ayatollah
 Khomeini.
 The Chariks espouse a vague philosophy they call
 Islamic Marxism.   They use a good deal of Marxist termi-
 nology but also stress their commitment to traditional
 Islamic religious principles.  We have no information
 that the pro-Soviet Communist Tudeh Party is in contact
 with the Chariks but we do not rule ou   some clandestine
 25X1    communications.
 The Chariks have received training in the past from
 the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and

 from South Yemen.   The current extent of foreign support
 for the Chariks is unknown.                                                25X1
 Late last year, the Chariks stepped up their attacks
 on police stations and SAVAK posts in widely separated
 parts of Iran.   The terrorists were clearly prepared to                  25X1
 capitalize on the confusion last weekend and they parti-
 cipated in several attacks on security positions, obtain-
 ing large amounts of arms in the process.
 The Tudeh has markedly increased its activities in
 recent weeks.   It staged its first demonstration on the
 streets of Tehran in many years on 21 January drawing      25X1
 about 5,000 people.   Communists probably have cells on
 nearly all university campuses and they now compete openly
 with other groups for support.
 Tudeh organizers have not appeared openly on any of
 the "workers'  councils"  that now exercise control in such
 key areas of the economy as the Central Bank.  Unidenti-    25X1
 fied leftists who may be party members, however,  seem to
 provide leadership for some of the councils.
 Policy statements from the Tudeh Party leaders in
 exile in East Germany suggest that a decision was taken
 several weeks ago that the party should become more ag-
 gressive in sponsoring activities independent of
 Khomeini's Islamic movement.   The party has continued to
 stress cooperation in a "united front" but a statement
 issued in mid-January warned that the Islamic movement
 should not seek to dominate other groups.   Starting on
 13 January, the Tudeh specifically called for the people
 to begin an armed struggle.                                        25X1
 The recent increase in Tudeh activities coincides
 with a change in party leadership.   Iraj Eskandari, who
 had been first secretary since 1971, was replaced on
 4 January by Nur-ed-Din Kianuri,  formerly second secre-           25X1
 tary.   Kianuri, who at 63 is one of the youngest Tudeh
 leaders, is said to be the foremost Tudeh theoretician.
 He is virtually unknown outside party circles.
 The USSR has always been the Tudeh's principal
 patron.   Given this close connection it can be assumed

 that Tudeh policies have at least tacit Soviet backing,
 but reporting on actual Soviet involvement is not ex-
 25X1         tensive.r                                                       -1
 At the far left of the political spectrum is the
 Revolutionary Oraanization of the Tudeh Party, a Maoist
 offshoot that broke away from the official party in the
 late 1960s.   This group--and possibly other Maoist organ-
 izations--is active among students in Europe and probably
 also in Iran.   It views the official party as too con-
 servative and does not eschew the use of revolutionary
 25X1    violence.
 Other leftist groups are sprouting up rapidly:
 25X1
 -- A new Marxist party called the Communist
 Party of Iran claiming 2,000 members was
 announced to the press on 6 February.
 -- Press reports yesterday mentioned the
 existence of a leftist terrorist  rouo
 calling itself the "Red Dawn."
 The collapse of SAVAK and other internal security
 forces in Iran has allowed the left to make considerable
 progress in organizing itself.   The confusion of recent
 days and the widespread distribution of arms in the
 capital has enormously benefited various leftist forces,
 25X1    especially the Chariks.
 The rapidly weakening cohesion of the Iranian mili-
 tary is also benefiting the left.   The desertion rate
 continues to grow in the military and the command struc-
 ture has been upset by the recent purges Khomeini has or-
 25X1         dered.
 Khomeini's own followers are disorganized and have
 clearly been unable to restore order to the capital.   In
 some provincial capitals there appears to be a state of
 25X1    near anarchy,

 At this stage the Chariks appear to pose the prin-
 cipal obstacle to restoring order.   We anticipate further
 provocations by the Chariks aimed at weakening the
 Bazargan government; they can be expected to resist any
 attempt to disarm them.   If the government delays forcing
 a confrontation with the Chariks, they are likely to
 grow stronger and their successful resistance to govern-
 ment authority would embolden other terrorist groups.
 The ultimate goal of the Chariks appears to be a leftist
 government.   A Charik spokesman said yesterday the
 Chariks are "ready to fight against any regime that is
 not sufficiently progressive."
