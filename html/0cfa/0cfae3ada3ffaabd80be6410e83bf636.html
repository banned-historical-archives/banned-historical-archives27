 USSR.  Kosvgin visit to Tashkent related to poor cotton harvest:  The
 US Embassy in Moscow believes that the presence of A.! N. Kosygin at
 the 7 November celebration in Tashkent may be related to difficulties
 encountered with the cotton harvest in the Uzbek SSR.  The Embassy
 observes that Kosygin, as Minister of Light Industry, is probably the
 Politburo member most concerned with the cotton harvest, which is
 closely connected with the development of textile production.  This
 action recalls a similar visit of trouble-shooter Kaganovitch to the
 Uzbek 25th anniversary celebration in Tashkent following a bad cotton
 year.  (R Moscow 506, 23 Nov 51)
 RUMANIA.  Rumanian labor frozen:  A 20 November decree by the Rumanian
 Government places new restrictions on workers' transfers.  Management
 may now release them from contracts only for specified reasons, such
 as conclusion of work, health, transfer of spouse, etc.  St:ii   penalties
 are provided for violating the decree by forging medical certificates
 or by hiring workers without proper separation documents; management
 may also be penalized for refusing separations where valid reasons
 exist.  (R Bucharest 222, 23 Nov 51)
 Comments  The Rumanian regime is attempting to consolidate further
 its control over manpower.  The creation in April of a General Directorate
 of Labor Reserves (OCI Daily Digest, 28 May 51) provided for recruiting,
 training and distribution of the labor force; the new decree is directed
 at reducing turnover.
 YUGOSLAVIA.  Yugoslavia appeals for additional financial assistance:
 In an informal. appeal to the Tripartite delegations for assistance,
 the Yugoslavs estimate that $70-SO million will be needed to complete
 the present investment program in addition to the International Bank
 loan of 28 million dollars and excluding compensation loans now being
 discussed in Washington.
 Tripartite delegates believe that the IBRD should provide a second
 loan of 30 million dollars, which would leave an additional 50 million
 dollars needed to fulfill the needs of the Yugoslav investment program.
 (S Belgrade TOECA 239, 26 Nov 51)
 Comment:  The US Embassy in Belgrade warned ECA officials last week
 that Yugoslavia urgently needs additional funds for capital investment
 over and above the new IBRD loan.

 Last June the US, UK and France made the assumption that the IBRD
 would furnish sufficient capital development funds.  The Yugoslav economic
 position, however, is such that unless additional capital is provided,
 certain key investments will not be completed and production will not be
 realized.  In the abitence of this production, the trade deficit will not
 be balanced without raising by some 35 million dollars the 125 million
 dollar ceiling agreed to last June.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1.   SYRIA.   Military coup d'etat engineered on 29 November;  The day-old
 Sian Caine     of  aruf al-Dawalibi .     was arrested earl  on,29,November
 when the government was taken over by the army under the leadership of
 the Chief of Staff, Colonel Adib al-Shishakli.  According to the US
 Legation in Damascus, the immediate occasion for the coup was the as-
 sumption by the deposed Premier of the defense portfolio.  Shishakli
 apparently believed that his own position was threatened and decided to
 force a showdown with the populist Party.  (C Damascus 306, 29 Nov 51)
 Comments  The military coup d'etat in Damascus, an essentially in-
 ternal a  air, re-emphasizes the dominant position of the Syrian Chief
 of Staff, Col. ah.shakli, -who for the past two years"w'ha''riaintained `a behind-
 the-scenes control over governmental affairs.   his sudden military ac-
 tion will probably put an indefinite clamp on influential Populist Party
 leaders, who have been attempting to eliminate military control of the
 country.
 Shishakli is essentially an opportunist, intent on maintaining his.
 own strong position in Syria.  Since neutralism is strong in this country,
 he:is not likely to direct Syria into a closer relationship with the West.
 Shishakli has been appreciative of French arms shipments, but annoyed over
 the lack of similar military supplies from America and Britain.  He is not
 believed to be sympathetic to the USSR.  He is opposed to a Syrian-Iraqi
 Union and has friendly relations with both Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
 This coup d'etat, the fourth in the last two and a half years, under-
 scores the instability of Syria.  Even though the military-controlled
 government may, in the short run, prevent Syria from embarking on an anti-
 Western foreign policy, the establishment of a dictatorship encourages
 further violence.
 2.   IRAN.  Mossade  victory anticipated in Iranian Parliamentary elections:  The
 Iranian Prime Minister has announced that the coming elections will be "free"
 and that the government will not support any particular candidate.  Neverthe-
 less, Mossadeqts National Front, through its sympathizers now established in
 the provincial_governmefits, is in a position to control the electoral mach-
 inery.                        The Shah, who reportedly fears that M?ssadeq will allow dissident
 elements to enter the next Parliament, has extended support to some of
 Mossadeq's opponents among the tribes.  (S Tehran 1973, 28 Nov 51)
 Comments  Iranian tradition and electoral law make it impossible to
 hold freelections in the American sense of the word.  The coming elections
 are unlikely to depart from the traditional pattern.  Pressure from the

 army, the landowners.  and the British will influence the outcome, but all
 indications now point to a National Front victory..  The Shahs fear that the
 Communists and their sympathizers may gain a foothold in Parliament is not
 unfounded, for the Tudeh Party is reportedly actively attempting to engineer
 the elections of its members, disguised as National Frontists, and Mossa-
 deq's lenient attitude toward the TuAeh suggests that it may succeed.

 Comments  The Shah is undoubtedly depressed by the fear that the elec--

 want the Shah to replace Mossadeq with Qvam, who. they consider
 wou      a more amenable on the oil issue, and their threat to do nothing to
 support the monarchy probably represents a last effort to spur the Shah to
 some action.  However, abdication in the near future is not anticipated.
 Prime Minister justifies government's actions by blaming British;
 Prime Minister Mossadeq's 25 Novem  r roper   o Parliament on his  rip to
 the US was consistently anti-British in tone.  Blaming the British for the
 failure of the Washington talks and for Iran's economic deterioration, the
 Prime Minister emphasized that oil nationalization was only the first step
 of the fight to end British influence, and that the government's future
 program would be to balance the budget, exploit its oil, and hold free
 elections.  (C Tbhran 1939, 26 Nov; C Tehran 1935, 26 Nov 51)
 Comments  Mossad,eq is now in a position where he must raise his anti-
 Britissh   mpaign.to new heights in order to gain continued support and to
 escape blame for Iran's economic difficulties..  His tactics are currently
 successful -- Parliamentary opposition has again collapsed -- but they
 pose serious problems for Iran's relations with the West.  Without rebe-
 nues from oil, Iran must have foreign aid if it is not to collapse econom-
 ically.  Mossadeq has led the Iranians to believe that they will receive
 extensive assistance from the United States; if they do not obtain this
 aid, Mossadeq may be forced by the strength of nationalist sentiment to
 hold the US, as well as the UK, repponsible for his woes.  The Prime
 Minister is neither Communist nor pro-Communist.  Nevertheless,, there is a
 possibility that he may, through his current policy, out himself off from
 the West..

 INDIA /NEPAL-  Indian Prime Minister effects changes in government of Nepal:
 According to the Nepalese Ambassador in New Delhi, Prime Minister Nehru o
 India was instrumental in effecting the recent changes in the government of
 Nepal, which culminated in the ousting of the century-old, hereditary Rana
 regime and its replacement by a "popular" government.  Nehru was also re-
 sponsible for the appointment of-the Nepal Congress Party leader as Prime
 Minister.  (S New Delhi 1877, 27 Nov 51)
 Comment:  India has been intimately, though covertly, connected with
 politics  maneuvers in Nepal since the Indian-supported "democratic" revo-
 lution of January 1951-  Much of this maneuvering has resulted in lessening
 the power of the Rarias and in strengthening Indian influence.  India is
 increasingly concerned with the security of its northern frontiers adjacent
 to Tibet.  It may be expected to continue its interest in Nepalese affairs,
 possibly to the point of obtaining outright control of their administration.
 Growing Indian influence in Nepal may also cause a delay in the open-
 ing of a US Embassy there, since Nehru is reportedly unsympathetic to US
 aims.
 INDIA. Indian Ambassador to Peiping allegedly heads Indian Communist move-
 m                         s A Bri is  source in     Delhi repoRs   a-K.M. Pane  ar, Indian
 Ambassador to Communist China and member of the Indian delegation.to the cur-
 rent UN General Assembly, has assumed leadership.of the Indian Communist
 movement.  (S Paris Delga 281, 17 Nov 51)
 Comments  Though Panikkar is known to be inclined toward Communism, it
 is unlikely that this report will be confirmed.  It probably stems from the
 facts that Panikkar recently returned to India and that he has made several
 public remarks complimentary to Communist China since his return.  Panikkar
 himself states that he hopes to be appointed Ambassador to Egypt in the
 near future..
 THAI LAND.  Coup dletat reported:  Press reports indicate that a nine-man
 pro     nal executive commi  eeID" composed of leading military personalities
 and headed by Army Commander Phin, has assumed control of the Thai Govern-
 ment.                   This committee has announced the return of the 1932 Constitution and
 has appointed an "interim cabinet" headed by Premier Phibun.  (U US press
 reports, 29 Nov 51)
 Comment:  It appears from these reports that the military element in
 Thailand, w ose .influence over the political scene was enhanced following
 the abortive coup of June 1951, have now assumed full control of the govern-
 ment.  While they will probably continue the country's pro-Western foreign
 policy and are not expected significantly to alter domestic policy, their
 high-handed seizure of power will alienate large numbers of civilian

 leaders and thus contribute further to Thai political instability.
 The military committee which now possesses de facto atathority,  is
 riven with personal rivalries.    Jockeying for position by its members
 will also cause instability and may eventually lead to an open clash.
 MALAYA..  Conservatives may remove Malcolm MaoDonalds  The US Consul in
 ua a Lumpur notes     a , no-     s an  ng press references to Commissioner-
 General MacDonald's popularity among Indians and Chinese, anti-MacDonald
 sentiment remains widespread and strong.  Both conservative Malays and the
 British planter-merchant community oppose him largely because of his kid
 gloves policy toward local Chinese.  General Briggs told the US Consul in
 confidence that his most urgent recommendation to Colonial Secretary
 Lyttelton will be the removal of MacDonald's influence from Federation of
 Malaya activities.  (S Kuala Lumpur 93, 27-Nov 51)
 Comments  Since MacDonald reportedly does not enjoy the esteem of
 Churc               here is a strong possibility that he will be-removed in the
 near future.  His removal, if it occurs, is not likely to be accompanied
 by any basic'ohange in British policy, which attempts to balance severity
 with suasion.
 INDOCHINA.          Vietnamese Premier reportedly moderates views on French Unions
 Premier  ran  an Huu arrived in Paris as head o   ss country s.delega ion
 to the High Council of the French Union simultaneously with an AP despatch
 from Saigon quoting Huu as stating he would insist that the French Union
 be modeled on the British Commonwealth.  Immediately afterward, a Paris
 newspaper quoted Huu as denying this report and stating that Vietnamese
 independence had been achieved, that he was determined to strengthen the
 French Union, and that there was no intention of repudiating agreements
 with France.   French authorities in Saigon, however, continue to  affirm that
 Huu did indeed make the remarks attributed to him by the AP despatch.  (C
 Paris 31L~, 26 and 27 Nov 51)
 Comment:  Huups "denial" as spelled out above is not necessarily in-
 consistent with the position., attributed to him by the AP despatch.                              The
 Vietnamese will attempt, in the name of the French Union, to reduce the
 power of. the French to intervene in Vietnamese affairs.  With the French
 in effective military control of Indochina the Vietnamese have no weapon
 but pure diplomacy with which to struggle toward this end.

 addresses were made respectively by Tong Hsiao-ping, Teng Tzu-hui and
 Jao Shu-ship.  (R FBIS, 27 Nov 51)
 Comment;. In each regional government of Communist China, authority
 is divi edibetween the military leader of the area, who is usually
 Chairman of the military and administrative council and commander of the
 Field Army stationed in the region,,, and a political watchdog, who is the
 Party's regional secretary and political commissioner of the Field Army.
 The three persons named above are the political leaders of their respective
 areas?  The military leaders of these areas--respectively Liu Po-cheng,
 Lin Piao and Chen Yi--would ordinarily be expected to deliver the major
 addresses at general meetings of their councils.  Although no firm
 thesis can be constructed on the basis of this one occasion, it is possible
 that the regional political bosses are now definitely superior to the
 military leaders,
 Ill         Students are found "indifferent" to  oliticss  Chungking radio asserts
 that a  universa  disregard of politics" has been observed among uni
 versity,and high school students in two.major cities of the Southwest
 region, The broadcast states that the students have defended'this
 "indifference" with the argument that they are "very busy" with their
 academic assignments,  (R FBIS, 28 Nov 51)
 Comment.- Only two months ago the Communist authorities publicly
 lamented -the "chaotic situation" in education, admittedly the partial
 result of excessive mobilization of students for political projects.
 The regime has evidently not yet solved the dilemma presented by its
 great need for educated personnel and its simultaneous insistence upon
 time-consuming political activity,  Peiping may thus deprive itself,
 in large part, of both well-trained personnel and the support of student
 youth,. one of the few segments of society still generally favorable to
 the regime,

 13.  KOREA. UN carrier-based aircraft attacked by enemy jets on east coast:
 On 27 November, four UN carrier based aircraft were attacked by two Com-
 munist NIG-15 jet aircraft north of the east coast city of Wonsan,' Some
 damage was inflicted on one UN plane..
 The Far East Air Force observes that since the UN aircraft were
 engaged in a rail cutting mission, this enemy interception may indicate
 an "increased sensitivity to naval interdiction of rail traffic in this
 area."  (S FEAF AX 7226, 28 Nov 51)
 Comment: A more serious implication to be derived from this latest
 enemy  n terception of UN aircraft is that the Communist air force has
 now begun to expand its air defense activities over the Korean east coast.
 14,          ROK Government attempting to silence opposition presst  The US
 Military  ttache in Pusan reports that the   ee Government's attempt to
 silence the-opposition press  threatens to become a major issue in the
 ROK."  Indignation among members of the press and the opposition
 Democratic Nationalist Party (DNP) is mounting over the recent indictment
 of the editor and a reporter of a DNP-controlled newspaper.  The Government
 contends that the paper printed information "conducive to pyschological
 ,panic" and "injured foreign relations",of South Korea.  (S Pusan Weeka 16,
 28 November 51)
 Comment: The charges against the opposition newspaper are reported
 as being extremely weak.  Moreover, the indictment is based on laws
 imposed by the Japanese during World War II and clearly violates the
 spirit, if not the letter, of the current constitution.

 Created to "raise the mateFial and cultural life of the people by raising
 the quality'and quantity of production," the establishment of these co-
 operatives should be completed by the end of November, a full month ahead
 of"schedule.  This system has reportedly resulted in an increase of 200 to
 400 percent in the production of textiles and foodstuffs and greatly "over-
 fulfilled" quotas in other consumer items.  (U FBID, 28 Nov 51)

 the living standard of the North Korean civilian population.  The strengthening

 16.          South Korean Ambassador to Ja an recalleds  ROK Foreign Minister
 Pyun a vised    assa or Muccio on 28  ovember that the South Korean.
 Government has decided to recall Ambassador Sihn Sung-mo, Chief of the
 ROK Mission in Japan.  The Embassy has learned informally that the chief
 prosecutors involved in the National Defense Army scandal and the Kochang
 Massacre trials left Pusan for Tokyo on 19 November presumably to investi-
 gate Sihn's involvement in the scandals.  (C Pusan 494, 28 Nov 51)
 Comment;  Sinn was forced out of his previous office of Defense banis-
 ter large y due to momentary presidential pique over his alleged responsi-
 bility for the scandals.  As one of South Korea's most powerful political
 figures, Sihn has disdained for several months, probably with Rheets tacit
 approval, invitations to return home to testify at the scandal trials.  Pre-
 sumably sufficient pressure has now developed to force Rhee's hand and order
 Sihn's return?
 17.  JAPAN KOREA,  Korean Government claims island in Ja an Seas  The US Embassy
 in   san reports that an  officia  spokesman  of the ROK Government claimed,
 via the local press, that_Takeshima Island belongs to Korea.  The press re-
 lease was inspired by a report indicating that seven Japanese correspondents
 had visited the island and asserted it belonged to Japan.  (P Pusan 495, 28
 Nov 51)
 Comment;  Takeshima Island consists of an uninhabited group of rocky
 islets in t e Japan Sea, lying approximately midway between Japan and Korea.
 Despite an official ROK request to include Takeshima among the group of
 islands renounced by Japan in the peace treaty, this was not done--a de-
 cision undoubtedly considered final by the Japanese.  The islands were in-
 corporated into a Japanese prefecture in 1905, but Korean claims were stimu-
 lated by the fact that they were specifically excluded from the SOAP 1946
 definition of "Japan."

 19.         Electrical Workers to  o on nationwide strikes  The AU-Japan Elec-
 tricalorers Union decided on 28 November to go on full strike for an
 indefinite period starting 1 December.  The union has been conducting par-
 tial work stoppages for the past week in an unsuccessful effort to gain a
 50 percent wage increase.  (R FBI Ss Tokyo Jiji 29 Nov 51)
 Comments &  Electric power shortages are the primary deterrent, to an
 expansion of Japants industrial output. This strike; which will not affect
 Occupation installations or production for the Korean war, is serious enough
 to require'possible government intervention.  The government, in a similar
 strike last December, took the position that any serious interference with
 the economy would be illegal.

 American officials in Paris have warned that even after proper allow-

 calculating the figures above, the remaining discrepancies are so great that
 the various national estimates should not be considered merely as initial
 negotiating positions which can easily be brought up to levels desired by
 the US.
 In view of their growing economic difficulties, the European countries
 involved will probably lose their earlier optimism and refuse to make
 substantially larger commitments to the defense effort than those now sub-
 mitted,  This, plus the publicized US intention not to increase economic
 or military aid to Europe in the current fiscal year, makes sizeable modi

 French auments that political union is essential to the European Army
 concept.  Should the European Defense Community fail to materialize, German

 Asmyecare   a                 it would be "difficult to exaggerate the unfavorable impacts of sensational
 American journalism on French public opinion and warned that the proposed
 reprint in French of the Collier's Atomic War issue would be harmful to US'
 interests abroad.  In urging the discontinuance of this project, the delegate
 statt1 that unfavorable agitation about the article continues to grow and
 that a protest is being raised in a General Assembly committee against the
 magazine's use of the UN flag and symbol.  At the recent Council of Europe
 meeting,. French Socialist leader Guy Mollet told US' Congressmen that such
 lurid journalism, epitomized by the Collier's issue, "could only serve
 Communist propaganda ends and increase European tensions,"  (C Paris DELGA
 )400, 28 Nov 51)
 Comment:.  This latest statement corroborates and strengthens earlier
 reports from the US Embassy in Paris of the depressing and confusing effects
 upon informed public opinion in Western Europe of sensational US articles on
 war.  It is probable that translation and greater circulation of any articles
 describing the horrors of a third world war would revive the trend toward
 neutralism in France and would continue to aid the Soviet peace campaign
 by associating the US with war mongering,  These articles are particularly
 ill-timed in view of the lukewarm French attitude toward costly rearmament.

 5.      FRANCE.  French Union High Council will not consider Chinese internees:
 Repatriation o  Chinese Nationalist  roops from In ochina will not appear
 on the agenda of the High Council of the French Union because of General
 de Lattre's strong objections.  According to a French Foreign office spokes-
 man, however, this decision may be reversed if French need for Chinese
 support in the UN makes such action desirable.  (C Paris 3176, 26 Nov 51)
 Comment:  The French will be anxious to avoid any discussion of the
 interned Chinese as long as'the Korean negotiations are in progress.  If a
 settlement is reached in Korea, the resulting relationship of Communist China
 to the UN will probably determine the French attitude.
 AUSTRIA,  West East transit shipments through Austria decrease:  Statistics
 recently made available: by the Austrian Federal  ailways show that shipments
 of Western goods, probably including embargo items, transiting Austria by
 rail to Eastern bloc destinations are levelling off at a sharply reduced
 volume.   While transit shipments of 11,212 metric tons in July represented
 a slight increase over the figure for May, the July total is little more
 than one-third of the monthly average for the period from November 1950 to
 May 1951, and less than one-half the total shipments in February, when the
 monthly figure fell from 414,000 to 28,000 metric tons.
 Italy and Switzerland remained the primary sources. of goods reaching
 Eastern orbit countries via Austrian railways.  French, Belgian, Dutch,
 British, and.Turkish shipments were insignificant in quantitative terms,
 and French shipments through Austria were only one-tenth of the previous
 November May average,  Hungary and Czechoslgvakia received the largest
 amounts of Western goods.  It should be noted, however, that the bulk of
 Italian shipments to Hungary in July (4,390' metric tons) was apparently
 fertilizer.
 While Austria is only one of a number of transit areas for East-West
 trade and Austrian railways only one means of transport, the sharp decline
 in the volume of such shipments may be an indication of the declining availa-
 bility of Western goods for Eastern shipment and/or a measure of effectiveness
 of Western trade controls.  The consequences for the Satellite countries of
 the declining volume.ofWestern goods may be responsible for reported efforts to
 cooi'nate Satellite procurement activities in Vienna and to make increased
 use of Soviet.--controlled trade agencies in that city.  (Statistical data from:

 accepted the dismissal of 3,000 workers, of whom 250'. are, to be rehired

 The Communists and the left-wing Socialist papers claimed that the

 the stands taken by the Italian Confederation of Labor Unions (CISL), which
 first accepted the original terms offered by the managements  (S Rome.
 Joint Weeka 1i 7, 2L Nov 51)
 Comment:  The dismissals at Breda illustrate the unutilized Italian
 economic pootential for defense production.  The amount of idle industrial
 plant capacity is particularly important in the armaments and munitions
 industries.
 Another important aspect of the strike at Breda is the fact that
 apparently the pro-government labor union, CISL, again unwittingly forced
 the moderate Socialist-labor unionists into joint action with. the Communists.

 councillors representing heads of families took place. on 25 November,
 apparently without major incidents.  The Spanish press reported that 80 to
 90 percent of those eligible voted but admitted that only about 60 percent
 voted in certain northern areas.
 There was a general lack of interest and the large vote was probably
 due chiefly to a radio announcement urging retention of certificates of
 having voted for use.in renewing ration cards,  The Embassy concludes that
 most Spaniards view voting in this election as a chore and a necessary
 .precaution against government sanctions,  (C Madrid 550, 26 Nov 51)
 Comment:  This was the first in a series of three nation-wide elections
 of new mun cipal councillors.  There will be elections on 2 December for
 councillors representing the Falange labor syndicates and on 9 December
 for representatives of economic, cultural, and professional entities.  Only
 government-approved candidates may run, no campaigning on partisan lines
 is permitted, and the electorate is restricted,
 Tl  Basque clandestine radio has urged Spaniards to show their contempt
 for the Franco government by not voting.  The lighter vote reported in

 Comment: The sicance of this decision is unknown.,  However, if the
 Soviet  urpose is other than the support of its legitimate commercial
 interests in Spitsbergen, it is doubtful that they would have notified the
 Norwegian authorities of their decision.  Also, it has been previously
 repo rted'that (1) shipping to Spitsbergen continued until late November in
 1948 and during that winter the Russians requested additional navigational
 .aids to continue shipping in the area :of their claims, and (2) the Soviet
 icebreaker Leningrad (10,000 tons) was in Spitsbergen waters throughout the
 winter of 1         ,  While ice conditions normally terminate shipping to
 Spitsbergen by mid-November,`complete icing precluding entrance to the Isfjord

 10,   UNITED KINGDOM.  Israeli request to finance pipeline o  osed:  Both the UK
 ffMn      o Fuel and Power and the British oil companies have agreed that
 construction of a pipeline from Elath, Israel, on the Gulf of Agabo,to Haifa
 is not a commercially attractive proposition,  Oil transported by such a
 pipeline would cost only a shilling less per ton than oil transported through
 the Suez Canal.  In addition, the Foreign Office is not inclined to take
 the political risk involved in supplying the Haifa refinery with Persian
 Gulf oil in the face of strong Arab opposition. (C London 2512, 27 Nov 51)
 Comment::  Israel felt that the closing of the Abadan refinery would
 prove a goo! talking point for the construction of this pipeline, which
 would permit the full-scale operation of the Haifa refinery., However., the
 British Government-.s reluctance to antagonize the Arab world further by
 supplying Middle Eastern oil to a refinery in Israel has already been shown
 by its refusal to send British tankers through the Suez Canal with oil for
 the Haifa refinery, despite its present military control of the canal zone,

 .100 Labor MPTs'were opposed to ratification and that the majority of these
 abstained at the second reading in order to avoid committing themselves.
 Many members of both parties who later voted for ratification indulged in
 vigorous criticism for the record.  This criticism was generally directed
 at the treaty's lack of safeguards against a resurgence of Japanese trade
 competition.

 The Bevan group based its opposition on claims that the treaty had
 been dictated by the US and would handicap a general settlement in the Far
 East, Former Foreign Secretary Morrison, however, emphasized that there
 was a clear understanding with the US that the Japanese were to decide their
 own relations with China,  (U NY Times, 29 Nov 51; R London 2517, 27 Nov 51)
 Comment.-  A division forced at thQ second reading had resulted in a
 382 to    vote favoring ratification.
 The debate suggests the prevalence in Britain of the belief that
 Japanese economic revival is likely to be rapid and expansive*  The fact
 that British textiles and pottery interests have already experienced mild
 Japanese competition appears to have strengthened this belief,  On the other
 hand, the Churchill government has as yet given no indication of unusual
 concern,.
 12,    MEXICO.  US' Embassy foxesees 'possibility of Mexican neutrality in event of
 wor   war:  In commenting upon the acceptance speech or Adolfo Ruiz  ortines
 as pres ential candidate of the official administration party for the July
 1952 elections, the US Embassy in Mexico City states  it would seem that
 Ruiz Cortines, if elected, will not deviate from Alemants foreign policy,
 Hence, in all probability, as far as we can now envisage, Mexico's attitude
 towards the free nations in the fight against the growing danger of Soviet
 aggression will continue to be one of cautious detachment,  That Mexico may
 decide to remain neutral and play the part of a mediator in case of a world
 war should not be' overlooked,"  (C Mexico City D-968, 15 Oct 51)
 Comment:  Ruiz Cortines is virtually assured of the presidency for
 the term 752-195$9.  As a reputedly honest but colorless politician who "has
 never outshone his political sponsors," who has been trusted "never to make
 any move without consulting his political leaders," and to whom party
 loyalty is the chief concern, he will probably be prone to follow con-
 ciliatory policies which will preclude strong support of the U5 in inter-
 national affairs.  The recent election of a Mexican, Luis Padilla Nervo,
 as President of the UN General Assembly increases the possibility that Mexico
 may choose to remain aloof from international conflicts,

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1.   SOUTHEAST ASIA.  British considering Southeast Asia defense problem:
 According to the Foreign Office, the problem of the defense of Southeast
 Asia is being reconsidered within the British Government.  It is realized
 that obtaining the most competent military advice is a prerequisite to high
 level political consideration.  The current thinking is that the US and UK
 should exchange views before the French are consulted.  A formal defense
 arrangement, such as an extension of the Pacific Pact, is considered pre-
 mature at this time.  (TS S/S London 2].67;' 28 Nov 51) .
 SECTION 3 (WESTERN)
 2.    GE.   SHAPE progress report presented to NAC Meeting:  In a SHAPE report
 to the North Atlantic Council Meeting in Rome, General Gruenther gave the
 following estimate of the readiness and effectiveness of NATO forces:
 Required to Contain Forces as of Forces as of
 Soviet Thrust       31 Dec 51     31 Dec 52
 Ground force divisions on
 D-day                         46              24           30
 Ground force divisions on
 D ~ 30
 97              44           55
 Aircraft                          7600
 1580         3250
 Present NATO ground forces are not fully effective, however, due to
 deficiencies in training and equipment; and the air force suffers from
 shortages of spares, pilots and airfields.  Of the 51 airfields promised by
 the end of 1951, only 16 are now operational; but 35 are expected by March
 1952.
 If war occurs before NATO forces have grown adequate for containment, an
 emergency plan exists for the use of present forces.  The role of navy
 carriers was emphasized, particularly in the operation of the emergency plan,
 A total of 16 carriers is needed to operate in NATO waters.  (TS 6/S Rome 88,
 27 Nov 51).
 Comment:  Highlighting of present NATO deficiiicies in this report has
 led to a resolution that the special Harriman committee on reconciling
 economic capabilities with military requirements submit its report sufficiently
 in advance of the expected February council meeting to permit action by govern-
 ments at that meeting.

 UNITED KINGDOM.  Libyan, independence prior to 1 January unlikely,  The UK
 Foreign Office considers it probably impossible to have arrangements for
 Libyan independence completed before 1 January 1952.  The UK hopes, however,
 that agreement will have been reached by then for an interim military arrange-
 ment with the federal government of Libya so that its signature can immediately
 follow achievement of independence on that date. Possibly the general treaty
 of alliance between the UK and Libya will also be ready for signature at the
 same time.  (S, S/S London 2490, 24 Nov 51).
 Comment:  The UN General Assembly resolution specifies 1 January 1952
 as the date for Libya to attain its independence.  However, some efforts had
 been made to accomplish this earlier.
 With the end of the British administration their influence will still be
 maintained through the continued presence of British troops and through a UK
 guarantee to.underwrite the budgetary deficit of the federal government.
