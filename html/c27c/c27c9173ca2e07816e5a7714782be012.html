 At the end of the text of this compilation will be found:
 1. A listing of the abbreviations used in, this text and the
 organizations for which they stand showing the page in the
 text where they are described and their officials named.  (See
 Appendix A.)
 2. An alphabetical tabulation of Chinese named in this com-
 pilation (non-Chinese are not included). This list shows the
 organizations and activities within the framework of this com-
 pilation with which the persons named are connected.                                    (See
 Appendix B.)
 The alphabetical tabulation is not to be considered as providing
 full biographical data.  It is intended only to indicate the rela-
 tions of leaders with the organizations and activities with which
 this compilation is concerned.  In only a few instances have the
 connections of individuals with organs of the Chinese Communist
 Party or the Chinese People's Government been included. Mem-
 bership in the executive or central committees of the various
 political parties, All China federations, and front organizations
 appears only when such membership is head by persons listed for
 other reasons within the scope of this paper.
 Use of the alphabetical tabulation in conjunction with the list
 of abbreviated organizational titles will enhance its usefulness.
 For example, the list of abbreviations shows ACFLAC as the code
 used for the All China Federation of Literature and Art Circles
 discussed (together with its leaders, who are named) on page 44.
 Page 45 shows KUO Mo-jo as chairman of the ACFLAC.  A
 reference to KUO in the alphabetical listing, will show his other
 connections with organizations discussed in this compilation.
 Although some of the organizations coded after KUO's name are
 not included in this compilation (WPC - World Peace Council;
 Japan FA - China-Japan Friendship Association), the identity
 of these organizations may be determined from the list of abbre-
 viations; and the scope of KUO's participation in non-CCP, non-
 government activities will be indicated.  It should be understood
 that the organizations shown after each name represent only
 those more important ones with which the individual is known
 to be associated.

 INTRODUCTION
 How is the Chinese Communist Party (COP), an organization
 of less than 11,000,000 members (approximately 1.8 percent of
 the population of China), able to control so effectively non-Com-
 munist masses in excess of 600,000,000 and to mobilize them in
 support of its important domestic and foreign programs?
 Like other Communist parties in power, the CCP relies heavily
 on state security organs.  Thus far these organs have been suc-
 cessful in overcoming internal resistance to Chinese Communism.
 The CCP is not satisfied, however, with preventive measures alone.
 It is endeavoring to enlist more positive forces in support of the
 internal security system. The CCP is seeking not only to protect
 itself from the non-Communist masses but also to mobilize the
 energies of these masses in support of its foreign and domestic
 policies.  For this reason it has organized. a vast and complex
 network of unofficial (non-Party, non-government) organs. The
 name given to this network is the united front.
 This paper explains what is meant by the united front and
 describes its various component organizations in terms of their
 functions, subordination to the CCP, and key personalities. In
 a subsequent paper the role of the united front and of the persons
 involved in extending Chinese Communist influence abroad and
 in conducting international relations will be discussed.  Specifi-
 cally, the participation of the united front components in the
 world Communist movement and their relations with non-Com-
 munist countries will be described.
 Only Chinese Communist sources have been used in preparing
 this compilation.  They consist chiefly of press releases and radio
 broadcasts.

 PART I
 THE UNITED FRONT IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 The Communist Concept of a United Front
 According to the traditional Communist concept, a united
 national front is a coalition of a Communist Party and other
 political parties having at least some objectives consistent with
 the immediate aims of the Communist Party.  Such a coalition
 must be subject to immediate or eventual control by the Commu-
 nist Party.  In industrial countries united fronts usually include
 labor and socialist parties, whereas in agrarian countries the
 Communist Party allies itself with nationalist and peasant bodies.
 The united front serves a twofold purpose.  It enables the Chi-
 nese Communist Party (CCP) to gain organized, non-Communist
 support for its so-called minimum program.   It also provides the
 Communist Party with a screen behind which its members can
 penetrate and eventually gain control of the united front's non-
 Communist affiliates.
 The CCP's Use of the United Front
 Since it was founded in 1921, the CCP has used the united front
 to establish a foothold among the masses, undermine the influ-
 ence of other political parties, defeat the warlords, gain support
 of the victims of Japanese aggression, and aid in the seizure of
 state power.  Since forming a government in 1949, the CCP has
 employed the united front to extend its control over the non-
 Communist masses and to mobilize these masses in support of
 its foreign and domestic programs.
 The CPPCC - Organization of the United-Front
 The basic structure in the united front is the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).  Chart 1 is an
 organizational chart of the CPPCC.  The first full session of
 the CPPCC was convened by the CCP on 21 September 1949
 for the purpose of forming a "coalition" government.  It was

 attended by more than 600 delegates representing various politi-
 cal parties, mass organizations, geographical regions, overseas
 Chinese, the "People's Liberation Army," and ex-KMT members.
 Its composition and the fact that less than a third of the dele-
 gates were CCP members gave the CPPCC the appearance of
 being a truly representative body having broad non-Communist
 support.  The CPPCC was not, however, as broadly based or as
 representative as it appeared.  The directive of its preparatory
 committee defining qualifications for representation in the
 CPPCC excluded automatically all those not in basic agreement
 with the CCP's so-called minimum or "common" program.
 Almost immediately after it had been convened, the first
 CPPCC adopted unanimously the basic Chinese Communist proc-
 lamations, which, taken together, served as the law of the land
 until 1954, when a formal constitution was enacted. These docu-
 ments identified the CPPCC as the organization of the united
 front, empowered to enact or amend laws, elect the Central
 People's Government Council, and submit resolutions concern-
 ing policies or measures of the Central People's Government
 Council. However, because the first CPPCC adjourned on 30
 September 1949 and never again met in plenary session, it obvi-
 ously never exercised these powers.  Between 1949 and 1953 the
 CPPCC National Committee met four times and was used by
 the government to place the popular stamp of approval on impor-
 tant regulations, laws, and decisions.
 Since 1954, when a National People's Congress was elected and
 a full-fledged constitution adopted, the CPPCC has had no legis-
 lative powers.  It remains, however, the organization of the
 united front.  In January 1956 the second CPPCC was convened,
 and subsequently resolutions defining its new role were adopted.
 According to these resolutions, the CPPCC is charged with the
 responsibility for indoctrinating its non-Communist affiliates
 and publicizing important government and party programs.
 Components of the United Front
 The basic components of the united front (and, therefore, of
 the CPPCC) are identified in the Preamble to the Constitution
 of the government of Communist China as "democratic parties,
 classes, and people's organizations."  For all intents and pur-
 poses the "democratic classes" have been absorbed by the "demo-
 cratic parties" and "people's organizations."

 NOFORN / CONTINUED CONTROL
 The "democratic parties" are non-Communist, urban, political
 groups, most of which came into being during the 1940's and
 capitulated to the CCP shortly before or upon its seizure of state
 power.  For the purposes of this paper, "people's organizations"
 have been divided into All China federations and other unofficial
 fronts. The All China federations have been formed by the Com-
 munists to mobilize all elements of the population not already
 organized by the CCP, the government, or the military.  Mem-
 bership in an All China federation is limited to those in a par-
 ticular social, professional, economic, vocational, or religious
 group. For example, only members of the laboring class are
 admitted to the All China Federation of Tirade Unions.
 Fronts other than the All China federations have been formed
 by the CCP to implement important domestic or foreign propa-
 ganda programs. Membership in the fronts cuts across the lines
 which are used to determine the composition of the All China
 federations.  For example, the Association for Cultural Relations
 with Foreign Countries (ACRFC) was formed by the CCP to
 stimulate. cultural exchanges with non-Communist countries.
 Among its members are leading figures in many of the All China
 federations and non-Communist political parties.
 Control of the United Front
 It is clear that the united front of non-Communist parties,
 All China federations, and other fronts is firmly under CCP con-
 trol - specifically, the control of its Central Committee. With-
 out exception the non-Communist parties have acknowledged
 and frequently reaffirmed their subordination to the Central
 Committee and the Chinese Communist program. The presence
 of CCP members who are responsible to the Central Committee
 at all levels of the "people's organizations"' assures Central Com-
 mittee control of these organizations. *
 Because the Central Committee meets so infrequently, it is
 also clear that control of the united front is exercised by one or
 more of its organs.  It is difficult to determine which of these
 organs controls the united front or, if more than one is involved,
 how the control is divided.
 * According to the Constitution adopted by the CCP at its 8th Party Congress,
 party members in the leading organs of "people's organizations" must obey
 the competent CCP committees - in this case the Central Committee - for
 the "people's organizations" are national in character.

 NOFORN / CONTINUED CONTROL
 The range, variety, and importance of united front activities,
 the great mass of people involved, and the emergence of new
 Central Committee organs suggest that the control is probably
 divided among the United Front, Propaganda, and perhaps other
 departments of the Central Committee.
 Policy statements on united front activity are frequently pub-
 lished in the name of the United Front Department (UFD) by
 its Director, LI Wei-han; and it appears that this department
 has primary responsibility for directing the non-Communist par-
 ties. The leading roles of the UFD Director and one of his dep-
 uty directors as, respectively, first vice-chairman and secretary
 general of the CPPCC suggest that the UFD also supervises this
 organization of the united front.
 No announcement concerning organization and personnel of
 the United Front Department was made during or since the 8th
 Chinese Communist Party Congress in September 1956, but LI
 Wei-han was identified as director of the UFD when he addressed
 the Congress on 25 September 1956.  Little has ever been publicly
 announced concerning the organizational structure or personnel
 except for references to the director and his deputies.  Latest
 reports on the organization date back to 1951, at which time the
 existence of three bureaus was reported. The First Bureau had
 three divisions.  The First Division consisted of five subdivisions
 with responsibilities for guidance of the non-Communist political
 parties and for so-called democratic non-partisans.  The Second
 Division had four subdivisions: one responsible for internal mass
 organizations, another for external or overseas Chinese organiza-
 tions, a third for ethnic minorities, and the last for religious
 groups.  The Third Division was concerned with external liaison
 through international Communist fronts and delegations sent
 abroad.  The Second Bureau had three divisions : Intelligence,
 Investigation and Research, and Communications.  The Third
 Bureau was concerned with administrative matters, files and
 records, and security.  There were United Front Departments in
 the regional Party bureaus and UFD representatives down to the
 lower party units.    Whether the UFD still retains this organiza-
 tional structure is not known.
 Control of the All China Democratic Women's Federation is
 probably in the hands of the recently identified Women's Depart-
 ment of the Central Committee.  It is possible that departments

 corresponding to other All China federations, especially the large

 The nature of their activities and the presence in their leading
 organs of CCP propaganda specialists indicate that many of the
 other fronts are directed by the Propaganda Department of the
 Central Committee.
 In the sections which follow the basic components of the united

 PART II
 NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 A. Background
 With the exception of the Chih Kung Tang, which originated
 in the early 17th century, and of the Chinese Peasants and
 Workers Democratic Party, formed in 1927, the non-Commu-
 nist parties were organized during the turbulent decade which
 preceded the seizure of power by the CC:P.  All of them were
 based on nationalism and a desire for a new and better China;
 all were highly idealistic.  Completely urban in character, they
 consisted mostly of scholars, intellectuals, businessmen, and
 others who were professionally trained.  In terms of ideology,
 total membership, and general support, none could compare with
 either the Kuomintang (KMT) or the Chinese Communist Party;
 none had military components.
 During the political skirmishing which followed the defeat of
 the Japanese, these parties stood midway between the KMT and
 the CCP, often assuming the role of mediator and offering those
 who found fault with the regime in power an alternative to join-
 ing the Communists.
 When the civil war was resumed and the tide of battle shifted in
 favor of the Communists, these parties lost their bargaining
 position and accepted the invitation of the CCP to participate
 in the formation of a coalition government.  Although the Com-
 munists dominated the government which was eventually formed,
 representatives of the other parties were appointed to a number
 of the less sensitive posts.
 Since 1949 the memberships of the non-Communist parties
 (now often referred to as "satellite parties") have greatly ex-
 panded but are still under firm CCP control.  Recent statements
 from Peking insist that their ranks will increase still further, and
 a period of long-term coexistence with the CCP has been forecast.
 In referring to these non-Communist parties, the Chinese Com-
 munists most commonly call them "democratic" parties, which

 wording is included in the titles given most of them.  The appen-
 dix to Part II presents the Chinese Communist version of these
 parties and their functions.
 B. Functions
 The non-Communist parties have been retained and encour-
 aged by the CCP to expand because of their urban character.
 They provide the CCP, which is a predominantly peasant party,
 with access to urban scientists, businessmen, educators, Chinese
 returned from overseas, and intellectuals whose skills are needed
 to handle the complex technical and administrative problems
 with which the Communists are faced.  The non-Communist
 parties are also important to the CCP for security reasons; they
 provide the Communists with a ready-made means for identify-
 ing and controlling non-Communists who are politically articu-
 late and hence potentially dangerous.
 Their primary function on behalf of the CCP is to organize
 the intelligentsia and non-Communists of importance in all major
 cities of China. The United Front Department has assigned each
 party a specific organizational target.  This fact was confirmed
 by an editorial appearing in the 24 January 1951 issue of the
 People's Daily, official organ of the CCP Central Committee. The
 editorial stated that the non-Communist parties had recently
 held simultaneous meetings at which organizational development
 was stressed as the primary task and that ". . . in full conformity
 with their own historical background ... these conferences appro-
 priately decided on their respective specific targets of organiza-
 tional development.  Thus the KMT Revolutionary Committee
 decided to adopt public functionaries who are presently in office,
 and in particular the former KMT members among them, as
 its principal organizational target . . . ; the China Democratic
 League decided to adopt intellectuals of cultural and educational
 circles . . . as its principal targets ... ; the Democratic National
 Construction Association decided, in the main, to go after the
 middle and small elements in national industry and commerce
 as well as to reach out to all kinds of trades and crafts."  Because
 targets assigned to each are not mutually exclusive, the member-
 ships and tasks of the various non-Communist parties overlap.
 The same editorial stated that the non-Communist parties
 would limit their organizing activities to the major cities.        This

 NOFORN / CONTINUED CONTROL
 principle was spelled out in most of the separate party declara-
 tions, some of which specifically rejected the possibility of work-
 ing in the small cities.  The most important implication of this
 declared principle is that the overwhelming mass of the Chinese
 population in the countryside is not to become an organizational
 target for any of the non-Communist parties.
 The non-Communist parties are also responsible for indoctri-
 nating the intellectuals in Communist ideology and mobilizing
 their support for the CCP's important domestic and foreign pro-
 grams.  In 1950 the United Front Department of the CCP ini-
 tiated study conferences for senior cadres. Joint training classes
 for lower level personnel of the various parties were instituted
 in the larger cities during the same year.  :Personnel of the non-
 Communist parties are regularly "invited" to attend symposia
 held by government offices for study of the latest government
 (party) directives.  Statements by their central committees that
 they are Marxist/Leninist parties indicates the extent to which
 indoctrination has been achieved.
 Every major CCP or government policy pronouncement is
 immediately endorsed by statements issuing from the leaders of
 the various non-Communist parties and, when required, these
 statements are followed by actions designed. to execute the policy.
 C. Subordination to the CCP
 Obviously what the Chinese Communists call political parties
 are not to be confused with political parties in the accepted,
 democratic sense - i. e., organizations seeking to influence or
 control the government by means of competitive appeals to an
 electorate.  The competition which characterizes the activities
 and aims of political parties in a free society is nonexistent in
 China.  Without exception the non-Communist parties have
 publicly acknowledged their subservience to the CCP, willingly
 accepted assignments from the CCP United Front Department,
 adopted the CCP's program as their own without the slightest
 sign of independence of action, and admitted Communists into
 their own ranks.  There is also some reason to suspect that some
 persons posing as members of one or another non-Communist
 party are actually clandestine members of the CCP.  Under con-
 tinuous pressure from the CCP, even the capacity for developing
 autonomous programs of action has been lost.

 D. Membership
 Although Peking has announced the rates at which the various
 non-Communist parties have expanded (in June 1956 a Peking
 radio broadcast stated that their memberships had expanded
 some 400 % since 1949), statistical data on their total mem-
 bership have not been released. The relatively small number
 of urban intellectuals in China, the CCP's monopoly of the
 peasantry, and the fact that the organizing activities of the
 parties have been limited to the major cities suggest that the
 non-Communist parties have relatively low membership ceilings.
 It will be remembered that the membership of the CCP was
 announced at the 8th CCP Congress in September 1956 as being
 10,700,000, certainly many times the total of all the non-Commu-
 nist parties.
 Details on the geographic distribution of membership are also
 lacking, although it is known that all parties except the Chih
 Kung Tang (CKT) and the Taiwan Democratic Self Govern-
 ment League (TDSGL) have at least pilot organizations in most
 of China's larger cities.  The KMT Revolutionary Committee
 (KMTRC) and the China Democratic League (CDL) are known
 to have organizations in Vietnam, Malaya, and Indonesia, and
 possibly in Burma.
 Within mainland China a rough north-south line can be drawn
 among the non-Communist parties.  Historically, the KMT Revo-
 lutionary Committee, the China Democratic National Construc-
 tion Association (CDNCA), and the Chih Kung Tang were strong-
 est in the south.  Several KMT Revolutionary Committee leaders
 were once influential figures in the southeastern coastal prov-
 inces, and many China Democratic National Construction Asso-
 ciation leaders were members of industrial and commercial circles
 in Shanghai. The continuing importance of the KMT and
 CDNCA south of the Yellow River is evidenced by the fact that
 several of their leaders hold posts in the provincial and municipal
 administrations in that area.  The less important Chih Kung
 Tang, which recruits among Chinese with overseas connections, is
 generally restricted to southerners and its membership is largely
 concentrated in Kwangtung and Fukien, the provinces in which
 most Chinese emigration has originated.  The Chih Kung Tang,
 which has its headquarters in Canton, is the only non-Communist
 party that does not have its central offices in Peking.

 The China Democratic League, by contrast, seems to have a
 preponderance of northerners, perhaps because its membership
 is composed largely of professors and writers who have long
 regarded the north as the cultural center of China.
 E. China Democratic League (CDL)
 Founded in 1941 as the Democratic Groups League, it is a
 consolidation of the "Association of Comrades in the War of
 Resistance and National Construction" and the "China Demo-
 cratic Parties Alliance."  Its present title was adopted in 1944.
 Many members of smaller political parties during the period
 from 1941 to date have also been members of the CDL, and some
 of the smaller groups have been completely absorbed into the
 CDL.  Dissolved in October 1947 by edict of the KMT, its leaders
 moved to Hong Kong where it reestablished headquarters and
 announced its anti-KMT and pro-Communist policy.  Its mem-
 bers worked actively in concert with the Chinese Communists
 in subversion on the mainland up to 1949, when the Communists
 gained control.  Then its headquarters moved to Peking and the
 CDL has since been one of the leading satellites in the united
 front.
 The Chinese Communists say the CDL "has close contacts
 with the intelligentsia."  Its membership is drawn largely from
 those presently or in the past connected with the fields of culture
 and education.  Chinese Communist announcements say 19.3%
 of the membership are members of the faculty and staff of
 higher institutes of learning, 26.7% from middle schools, and
 12.7%) from primary schools.  Its membership is claimed to
 have grown 276% from 1950 to March 1956. As of April 1956
 it had branches in 86 cities in Communist China.  Many of
 its members are drawn from the fields of law, journalism, and
 finance.  The membership of the former National Salvation Asso-
 ciation (Chuo Kuo Hui) appears to have been completely absorbed
 into the CDL by 1950.  Because of its dissolution by the KMT
 in 1947 and the flight of its leaders from. China, many of its
 present members spent considerable time outside the mainland
 of China, particularly in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, which
 would account for the existence of CDL branches overseas.
 CHANG Lan, first head of CDL and now deceased, was assigned
 important positions in the original CPG structure.

 CDL has played a leading role, under the Chinese Communist
 Party, in the CPPCC, and many of its members in the period
 1949-1954 held high posts in the CPG.  Its members still hold
 a large portion of the important government positions in China
 assigned to non-Communists, and there is little if anything to
 distinguish between the doctrines of the CDL and CCP.
 There is considerable evidence that there are branches of the
 CDL in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaya, Indonesia, and
 Burma.  It is believed to serve clandestinely the interests of the
 Chinese Communists in some areas where diplomatic representa-
 tion is not established and where Communist activities as such
 would meet with local government opposition.

 F. Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (KMTRC)
 The KMTRC was formed in Hong Kong in January 1948 by
 Marshal LI Chi-shen as a gesture of protest against his KMT
 political enemy CHIANG Kai-shek.  Subsequently Marshal LI
 joined forces with Communist opposition to the KMT and became
 a vice-chairman (honoris causa, to all appearances) of the gov-
 ernment organized by the Communists in 1949.
 The KMTRC organizes all ex-KMT members who are accept-
 able to the CCP.  This category includes former members of
 the KMT who are living in Southeast Asia as well as those in
 China. At the third KMTRC Congress, which was held in Feb-
 ruary 1956, LI Chi-shen announced that membership had grown
 6.5 times since 1950.

 H. China Democratic National Construction Association
 (CDNCA)
 The CDNCA originated in December 1945 as an organization
 of traders, manufacturers, and others engaged in industrial and
 commercial activity.  Although it was accepted into the coali-
 tion government which was formed in 1949, several of its mem-
 bers, including an official on its standing committee, were sub-
 sequently purged; and it was not permitted to take part in any
 formal party activities until June 1952. The tenuous stature of
 the CDNCA suggests that persons in industry and commerce have
 been more reluctant than others to rally to the support of the
 regime, and that persons in this category are not trusted by the
 Communist regime.
 It organizes industrialists and merchants. According to an
 official press release, dated 28 August 1956, membership in the
 CDNCA had grown 2.5 times in the preceding eight months.
 Seventy-six percent of its members are said to be businessmen.
 The CDNCA is charged with responsibility for eliminating
 resistance among merchants and industrialists to the CCP's pro-
 gram for nationalizing industry and commerce.
 This association is closely related' to the mass organization,
 All. China Federation of Industrial and Commercial Associations.
 There are also local branches of CDNCA in all the large munici-
 palities, such as Shanghai, Tientsin, and Peking. The CDNCA
 and the All China Federation of Industrial and Commercial Asso-
 ciations held a preparatory conference in February 1956 and
 founded a new subsidiary organization, the National Conference
 of Dependents of Industrial and Commercial Circles, Women
 Industrialists and Businesswomen, of which CHANG Yun, vice
 chairman of the All China Democratic Women's Federation, was
 named chairman.  This National Conference is illustrative of the
 numerous overlapping control and propaganda devices which
 reach out to encompass groups of persons not otherwise organized
 through the satellite parties or mass organizations.

 I. China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP)
 Originally known as the Chinese Revolutionary Party, the
 China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP) was
 founded in 1927 by petty bourgeoisie elements who opposed both
 the KMT and the Communists. In the late thirties it joined the
 KMT and the CCP in a united front against Japan. Following
 the defeat of the Japanese and the renewal of the civil war in
 China, its leaders fled to Hong Kong. In 1948 the CPWDP
 accepted the united front proposals of the CCP.  Despite its
 name, the CPWDP has no ascertainable roots among the masses
 of peasants and workers.
 In 1950 the CPWDP was assigned the task of organizing experts
 and technicians in economic departments of the government.
 After discussions in the late spring of 1953 its leaders issued a
 directive stating that the emphasis would shift to the recruit-
 ment of the middle and upper levels among public functionaries
 and educational workers, specifically intellectuals working in
 scientific, technical, educational, cultural, medical, and public
 health departments of the government. This change in targets
 followed public acknowledgements by CPWDP leaders that dur-
 ing previous periods of expansion certain non-conformist and
 undisciplined elements had been accepted by the party.
 Reports of its activities indicate that the CPWDP is especially
 concerned with indoctrination (or, as the Communists say, "rais-
 ing the political consciousness") of scientific, cultural, and edu-
 cational leaders in China.

 Founded in 1944 as the "Democracy and Science Society," the
 Chiu San Society (CSS) later took its present name, which means
 September Third Society, in commemoration of China's victory
 over Japan on that date. It was originally composed of intel-
 lectuals engaged in the cultural and educational fields and
 resulted from conferences of various university professors.  It is
 now an organization for scientists and highly skilled intellectuals.

 K. Chih Kung Tang (CKT)
 The Chih Kung Tang, as discussed herein, represents a group-

 Chinese overseas. This secret society originated in the early
 17th century in China and spread to Southeast Asia, Australia,
 and the Americas.  It has undergone many changes since its
 founding, and numerous splinter groups have sprung from it
 over the years.  Its members furnished financial and political
 aid for more than one attempt to overthrow the constituted gov-
 ernments of China.                          Two of the offshoots are still active in the
 Americas.  One group bears the title Chih Kung Tang; the other
 and larger society is the Min Chih Tang, which is at least not
 openly pro-Communist.  These two groups exert considerable
 influence among the Chinese communities in the Western
 Hemisphere.

 L. Taiwan Democratic Self Government. League (TDSGL)
 The Taiwan Democratic Self Government League (TDSGL)
 was founded in 1947 by anti-KMT Taiwanese and Chinese.  It
 organizes Taiwanese and Chinese with relatives or a special
 interest in Taiwan.
 Its primary function is to support by every means at its dis-

 APPENDIX TO PART II
 CHINESE COMMUNIST VERSION OF NON-COMMUNIST
 POLITICAL PARTIES
 The following descriptions of the satellite parties were broad-
 cast in English by Radio Peking to Europe in June 1956 "for
 the convenience of editors wishing to follow the reports of the
 National People's Congress" :
 "A survey of the political parties of China, other than the Com-
 munist Party, shows that their membership has grown by over
 400 percent since liberation.  Local organizations of the parties
 are distributed chiefly in the cities. Altogether they have some
 300 local organizations.
 "The chief parties of China are the Revolutionary Committee
 of the Kuomintang of China, the China Democratic League, the
 China Democratic National Construction Association, the China
 Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants and
 Workers Democratic Party, the China Chih Kung Tang, the
 Chiu San Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government
 League.
 "The following are brief introductions to these parties:
 "l-The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang of
 China ... was composed of democratic elements of the former
 Kuomintang who opposed CHIANG Kai-shek's dictatorship.  It
 was formally established in 1948.  It has close contact with
 former members of the Kuomintang and with upper and middle
 class elements who were, in one way or another, historically
 connected with the Kuomintang.  It attended the first plenary
 session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
 in 1949; and LI Chi-shen, its chairman, was elected Vice Chair-
 man of the Central People's Government at the conference.
 "LI Chi-shen was elected Vice Chairman of the National Com-
 mittee of the CPPCC and Vice Chairman of the Standing Com-
 mittee of the National People's Congress in 1954.

 Democratic Groups League, which it changed in 1944 to the
 China Democratic League.            Members of the League supported
 the principle of persisting in the war against Japanese aggres-
 sion and stood for the Chinese Communist Party's policy of
 democracy and unity against the Japanese invaders.  After vic-
 tory in the war, it fought against the rule of the Kuomintang
 and opposed its plots for civil war.  It was dissolved in October
 1947 under Kuomintang pressure and reestablished itself in Jan-
 uary 1948 in Hong Kong.  It declared for cooperation with the
 Chinese Communist Party at the same time.  It attended the
 first plenary session of the Chinese People's Consultative Con-
 ference in 1949; and CHANG Lan, the late chairman, was elected
 Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government.  CHANG
 Lan, the late chairman, and SHEN Chun-ju, the vice chairman,
 were elected vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
 National People's Congress and vice chairmen of the National
 Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference in
 1954.  SHEN Chun-ju is now the chairman of the League.
 "3-The China Democratic National Construction Associa-
 tion was formed in 1945. Members of the Association are mainly
 patriotic industrialists, businessmen, and intellectuals who are
 connected with those circles.  Led by HUANG Yen-p'ei and
 CHANG Nai-ch'i, the Association attended the first plenary ses-
 sion of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
 in :1949.  HUANG Yen-p'ei, the chairman, was nominated Vice
 Premier of the then Government Council, following the estab-
 lishment of the Central People's Government.
 "HUANG Yen-p'ei, the chairman, was elected Vice Chairman
 of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Con-
 gress and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chi-
 nese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1954.
 "4 - China Association for Promoting Democracy.  The mem-

 chiefly made up of people in cultural and educational circles. The
 chairman is MA Hsu-lun, and the secretary general is HSU
 Kuang-p'ing, wife of the late writer, LU Hsun.  The China Asso-

 founded in 1929 after the defeat of the first great revolution.
 Its original name was the Chung Hua Ke Ming Tang (Chinese
 Revolutionary Party).  Later it was changed to the Provisional
 Action Committee of the Kuomintang of China.  In 1935 it was
 again changed to the Chinese National Liberation Action Com-
 mittee.                         Its present name, the Chinese Peasants and Workers
 Democratic Party, was adopted in 1947.  The Party agreed with
 the policy, established by the Chinese Communist Party in 1935,
 of setting up a national united front to fight against Japan.  In
 1938 the Party proclaimed that it stood for democracy, unity,
 and a war of resistance.  Later it joined in activities against the
 Kuomintang's civil war policy and in the struggle for democracy.
 In 1949 the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party
 participated in the first plenary session of the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Conference.  The chairman of the Chinese
 Peasants and Workers Democratic Party is CHANG Po-chiin,
 who is also Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese

 nese.  It was organized by Overseas Chinese in America.  In
 1947 the Party issued its political platform advocating peace
 within the country and political democracy, and opposing the
 dictatorial rule of the Kuomintang.  The China Chih Kung Tang,
 represented by CH'EN Ch'i-yu and others, participated in the
 first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consulta-

 ALL CHINA FEDERATIONS
 A. Introduction
 All China federations, as they are called by the Chinese Com-
 munists, constitute the second major component of the "people's
 democratic united front." They are used by the Communists to
 mobilize all elements of the population not already organized
 by the Party, the Government, or the military.  Separate All
 China federations corresponding to each major social, religious,
 professional, and vocational group (e. g., workers, students,
 women, youth, scientists, businessmen, returned overseas Chi-
 nese, etc.) have been formed by the Central Committee organs
 of the CCP.  In this way the Communists (who constitute less
 than 2% of the population) are able to involve great masses
 of people in the many state-sponsored political and economic
 "movements" which characterize their technique of governing.
 Like the satellite parties, the All China federations are used
 by the Communists to organize, indoctrinate, and mobilize spe-
 cific sectors of the Chinese populace.  However, they differ from
 the satellite parties in several respects, notably in their origin,
 number, size and character of membership, relation to the CCP,
 and diverse functions.
 B. Scope and Composition
 Unlike the satellite parties, which were :formed independently
 and later absorbed by the present regime, most of the All China
 federations are creatures of the Communist Party, some of them
 founded before 1949. As emphasized previously, the satellite
 parties are relatively small, few in number, and restricted to
 work among urban intellectuals, Chinese who have returned from
 abroad, and former members of the KMT.  The All China feder-
 ations, on the other hand, vary in size, are numerous, and prac-
 tically unlimited in their combined range.
 There are over twenty major All China federations, ranging in
 size from the All China Sports Federation, consisting of several
 thousand young athletes, to the All China Democratic Women's

 Federation, which claims a membership of almost 80 million.
 Some of the larger All China federations have many components
 which are in turn organized on a national scale.  The All China
 Federation of Trade Unions has separate national unions of rail-
 road, electrical, textile, mine, and machine workers, among others;
 and the All China Federation of Literature and Art Circles encom-
 passes national associations of writers, journalists, motion-picture
 workers, etc., each of which in turn has its own local and national
 federations.
 The collective range of these federations, unlike the closely
 restricted jurisdiction of the satellite parties, is practically unlim-
 ited.  Every social, professional, vocational, and religious element
 of the population has been drawn into group activity by one or
 another of the All China federations.  These elements include
 workers, students, women, scientists, lawyers, doctors, business-
 men, Moslems, Buddhists, etc.
 Because it is not uncommon for a person to hold concurrent
 memberships in several of the All China federations (e.g., a female
 writer who has not yet reached the age of twenty-five might belong
 to the All China Democratic Women's Federation, the All China
 Federation of Democratic Youth, and the All China Federation
 of Literary and Art Circles), membership statistics which are
 released by the individual organizations are of limited value in
 attempting to reach a figure which represents the total number
 of Chinese absorbed into the federations.  Some estimates have
 placed this figure as high as 200,000,000.  In theory, at least, the
 only limit on the size of the All China federations is the total
 number of people in China, excepting, of course, those whom
 the Chinese Communists classify as counterrevolutionaries and
 those already effectively organized under the CCP, the Chinese
 Communist armed forces, and the public security forces.
 C. Organizational Structure and Subordination to the CCP
 Each of the All China federations has an organizational struc-
 ture resembling that of the CCP and the satellite parties.  The
 national congress is theoretically the highest organ; but because
 it meets very infrequently, its powers are exercised by the national
 executive committee.  Subordinate congresses and committees
 direct the work of the All China federation in the provinces and
 larger municipalities. The basic organizational unit is the small

 SECRET

 branch or group which consists of seven to ten rank-and-file
 members.
 The centralized superstructure of the All China federations,
 like that of the satellite parties, is of less importance to the
 Communists than the growth of small groups or branches under
 proper guidance.  It is within these small groups that each
 federation fulfills its primary functions of organizing the non-
 Communist masses and inculcating in them discipline, loyalty,
 and self-sacrifice in the interests of the Party and state.  Under
 constant surveillance by a fraction of CCP members or activists
 who direct the group, and faced with penalties ranging from
 social ostracism to imprisonment or even death, the individual
 non-Communist has no choice but to accept the decisions of the
 group enthusiastically.
 The various echelons described above - i. e., the national, pro-
 vincial, municipal, and basic organs of each All China federa-
 tion - are bound together in a pyramid of control operating on
 the principle of "democratic centralism," which means that
 directives issued by the national executive committee are binding
 on all lower level committees and ultimately on each of the
 basic units.
 Although ostensibly independent, and publicized as such, the
 federations are in fact controlled at the central and local levels
 by one or another of the subsidiary organs of the CCP. Their
 adherence to the "correct" Communist line is assured by a
 nucleus of CCP members in top posts, a fact which is illustrated
 in the following descriptions of the various important federations.
 Although these mass organizations were founded, or taken over,
 and nurtured under the guidance of the organs of the Central
 Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as were the satellite
 parties in their present status, there is some evidence that they
 are being phased into segments of the Chinese People's Political
 Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an overt device through which
 the United Front Department, operating behind the scenes, can
 manipulate these organizations and their leaders.
 D. Quasi-Legal Status
 The All China federations are more closely connected with the
 formal governmental apparatus than are the minor non-Com-
 munist parties, and most of the former may be regarded as para-
 governmental agencies.  Their charters are issued by the gov-

 ernment, and most of them have some sort of administrative
 functions. Labor insurance regulations of 24 March 1951, for
 example, were promulgated jointly by the government's Ministry
 of Labor and the All China Federation of Trade Unions; and the
 latter organization participated in the administration of insur-
 ance funds.  Land reform throughout the country was enforced
 by the local peasant associations, which handled all the details
 of land confiscation and redistribution.  The youth and student
 federations play important roles in the recruitment and assign-
 ment of government personnel. All of these federations, along
 with the CCP, non-Communist parties, and military, select dele-
 gates who make up the Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Conference (CPPCC), the instrument of the "people's democratic
 united front."
 E. Other Functions
 As stated previously, the primary function of each All China
 federation is to mobilize and indoctrinate a particular non-Com-
 munist social, professional, religious, or vocational sector of the
 population. The federations are also used to promote the inter-
 ests of the Peking regime internationally.
 F. Relative Status of All China Federations
 For practical reasons and because they give concrete form to
 the Chinese Communist concept of a worker-peasant alliance,
 labor and peasant organizations have played the most impor-
 tant roles since state power was seized by the CCP.
 Many of the peasant associations were formed during the war
 with Japan and utilized by the CCP in its activities in areas
 behind Japanese lines.  Others were set up on the heels of
 advancing CCP armies during the period of civil war which fol-
 lowed.  Under the present regime peasant associations were
 assigned the task of administering agrarian reform - the first
 stage in the organization, surveillance, control, and indoctrina-
 tion of China's farm population.  In addition to surveying, con-
 fiscating, and reapportioning land holdings, the peasant associa-
 tion was charged with (1) organizing the village peasantry to
 carry out the regime's social reforms, (2) organizing agricultural
 production through rural cooperatives, and (3) propagandizing
 the peasant members in order to "elevate their political and cul-
 tural level."  Unlike the All China federations, which are organ-
 ized nationally, peasant associations are local in character and,

 though tightly controlled by the CCP, apparently have never
 united under any single national organization.  In 1952 the
 Peking press reported that peasant associations in areas which
 came under the control of the Chinese Communists after 1948
 had a total membership in excess of 88 million.
 Since the land reform program has been completed, the peasant
 association has decreased in importance. The combined mem-
 bership of agricultural producer cooperatives and collectives is
 a better index to the degree of control exercised by the CCP over
 the rural population.  In June 1956 Peking claimed that 108
 million (or 90%) of the peasant households in China had joined
 cooperatives and that 60~%o of these cooperatives had been col-
 lectivized.
 Although not called federations, the Political Science and Law
 Association (PSLA), China Islamic Association (CISA), and
 China Buddhist Association (CBA) are included under this sec-
 tion on All China federations because their primary function is
 to organize members of particular groups.  Although the Chinese
 Communists publicly refer to "Christian Religious Circles" as a
 united group, it is believed this is more a title than a fact, as will
 be seen in the corresponding portion of this section.
 G. All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU)
 The urban counterpart of the peasant associations is the local
 labor unions, some 200,000 of which, representing manual work-
 ers in 23 principal industries, are united under the leadership
 of the All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).  The
 total membership of the ACFTU has reportedly increased from
 4,000,000 in 1949 to 12,450,000 in 1956. The continuation of pres-
 ent trends, would produce by the end of 1957 about 15,000,000
 trade union members out of an estimated total working force of
 16,000,000.  Supervision of the trade unions at the national and
 local levels is in the hands of the 1.5 million union leaders reported
 by Peking to be members of the CCP.
 Trade union membership includes, in addition to manual work-
 ers in the 23 principal industries, various staff employees -
 clerks, custodians, stenographers, typists, and management per-
 sonnel at the lower level.  Many working class elements are
 excluded from membership : (1) peasants; (2) small handicrafts-
 men, because they are not paid in wages; (3) handicraft work-

 ers, because handicrafts are distinguished from modern indus-
 try; and (4) certain professional workers, because they are
 regarded as non-working class elements. Those excluded from
 membership in the trade unions have been organized into other
 All China federations.
 Under the Labor Union Law (28 June 1950) the ACFTU and its
 affiliates have become adjuncts of the state with political and
 internal security functions in addition to the responsibility for
 organizing the working class.  According to this law, labor unions
 must (1) educate and organize workers in support of government
 laws and directives; (2) create new worker attitudes conducive
 to greater productivity; (3) guard against all types of waste, cor-
 ruption, and sabotage of state enterprises; and (4) exercise vigi-
 lance over private industry in the interests of the state.
 The preamble to the revised "Constitution of the Trade Unions
 of the CPR," adopted on 10 May 1953, contains some of the cur-
 rently fashionable metaphors and slogans (underlined below)
 used to describe the function of the unions:
 "The Trade Unions of China led by the Communist Party have
 rallied the broad masses of the workers around the party and
 have thus become transmission belts between the party and the
 masses.  Since the establishment of the people's democratic dic-
 tatorship, the trade unions under the leadership of the party
 have become a school of administration, a school of management,
 and. a school of Communism for the workers."
 Although trade unions are enjoined by their constitution "to
 show constant concern over the improvement of the material
 and cultural life and the working conditions of the entire body
 of workers, technical personnel, and staff members," the require-
 merits of production are given higher priority than the needs
 of the workers. Trade union cadres that become preoccupied
 with welfare projects are often subject to sharp criticism.  For
 example, ACFTU Chairman LAI Jo-yii, in a report to the Seventh
 All China Congress of Trade Unions, condemned the expansion
 of labor insurance programs as "blind adventurism out of pro-
 portion to practical requirements."
 In order to increase labor productivity, trade union programs
 for strengthening labor discipline and developing "labor emula-
 tion." (that is, the emulation of model workers who produce above
 established norms) have been initiated by the ACFTU and its
 36

 affiliates.  In 1954, for example, the ACFTU drafted and pre-
 sented to the State Council for adoption "'The Outline of Labor
 Regulations for State Operated Enterprises," the stated purpose
 of which was "to ensure and consolidate labor discipline."  The
 outline was enacted into law immediately, and strict observance
 of its regulations was made the "sacred duty" of all workers. Ten
 of the twenty-four articles deal with punitive measures.
 Labor emulation campaigns are a continuing function of the
 trade unions. They are effective not only in increasing produc-
 tion but also in raising the political consciousness of the Chinese
 worker. The ACFTU publishes the China Worker.
 The ACFTU actively participates in the direction and activities
 of the World Federation of Trade Unions and maintains relations
 with unions in non-Communist countries.

 H. All China Democratic Women's Federation (ACDWF)
 The ACDWF was formed by the Communists in 1949, ostensibly
 to emancipate China's women, whose underprivileged status
 had characterized previous Chinese history. Membership in the
 ACDWF is limited to women's organizations; there are no indi-
 vidual members of the ACDWF.  In order to be counted among
 the 80,000,000 members claimed by the ACDWF, a woman must
 first join the YWCA or some other women's organization which
 is affiliated with the ACDWF.  It is unlikely that the large mem-
 bership claimed by the ACDWF has been fully integrated.

 The People's Handbook of 1953 states that the aim of the
 ACDWF is "to rally the great mass of women of all classes and
 races to participate actively in the construction programs of the
 nation, to protect the rights of women and the welfare of chil-
 dren, to raise the consciousness and ability of women, to realize
 equality between the sexes, to achieve thorough emancipation of
 women, and to fight for the guarding of world peace in alliance
 with the peace loving women of the world."
 During the first two years of its existence the ACDWF concen-
 trated on organizational activity, implementation of agrarian
 reform, and familiarizing women with Marxism-Leninism and
 the teachings of MAO Tse-tung. Traditional Chinese attitudes
 toward women were attacked in an effort to exploit their pro-
 ductive capacity.
 Following its second National Congress, the ACDWF empha-
 sized that the central task of the women's movement was to
 mobilize women to participate actively in industrial and agri-
 tural production.  In accordance with this task several hundred
 thousand women were given jobs in industry, and others were
 appointed to government positions. Nurseries were organized
 everywhere in order to care for children of working mothers.
 As a supplement to its activities on behalf of the state, the
 ACDWF is attempting to improve the social and economic lot
 of the Chinese woman.  Communist sources report that approxi-
 mately half the students in China are women.  Under the Mar-
 riage Law wives have been given equal rights with their husbands.
 The ACDWF has been especially active in the activities of the
 world Communist movement among women (WIDF) and in pro-
 moting contacts with women in non-Communist countries. The
 ACDWF publishes Women of China, an English language publi-
 cation, and Women Workers of the New China, an illustrated
 magazine.

 1. All China Federation of Democratic Youth (ACFDY)
 The ACFDY was formed in 1949 in order to unite the youth
 throughout the country in support of the CCP's program.  It is
 a large and, by strict Communist standards;, a loosely-knit organ-
 ization.  In this respect it differs from the Chinese Young Com-
 munist League (YCL), an auxiliary of the CCP, consisting of
 young activists, most of whom are slated to become party
 members.
 Like the ACDWF, the ACFDY is composed chiefly of organized
 youth units, both national and local.  Its constitution provides,
 however, that "persons having influence over and contributions
 to the youth mass" may join as individuals.
 The upper age limit for membership in the ACFDY is stated
 to be 25. However, many of its leaders are CCP and YCL activists
 who are obviously exempt from this requirement.  Key ACFDY
 members are also active participants in affairs of the World Fed-
 eration of Democratic Youth (WFDY).

 J. All China Federation of Students (ACFS)
 Fully aware of the key political role which students in China
 have assumed over the past several decades, the Communists
 organized the All China Students' Federation (currently known
 as the All China Federation of Students) in 1949. The basic
 units in the ACFS are student associations in all middle schools
 and institutions of higher learning.
 Both the student and youth federations are used as shock
 troops in carrying out CCP campaigns. Under party direction,
 the student federations dispatch units to activate other groups -
 for example, to participate in the collectivization of agriculture
 through the cooperatives and in factory reorganization through
 the labor unions.  Activism in ACFS work often leads to mem-
 bership in the YCL and from there into the party.
 Like the ACFDY, the ACFS is active in international Commu-
 nist front activities, specifically in the activities of the Interna-
 tional Union of Students (IUS). The ACFS is also in contact
 with student groups in non-Communist countries.
 There is much cross-membership between the ACFS and the
 CYL; and of course, because of the ACFS is an organizational
 member of ACFDY, all members of the former are per se members
 of the latter.  Since its organization in 1949, at least, and perhaps
 before that time, the students' federation has sent delegates to
 conferences, to congresses of the Communist front organizations,
 and to World Congresses of Youth and the International Union
 of Students (IUS). The impressionable, volatile nature of stu-
 dents in all countries makes them prime targets for recruitment

 K. All China Federation of Industrial and Commercial Asso-
 ciations (ACFICA)
 In 1953 the ACFICA was formed as a national organization for
 private businessmen and industrialists who survived the several
 campaigns and other efforts by the Communists since 1949
 to eliminate the capitalistic trends.  The establishment of such
 an organization was discussed before the Communists formed
 their government in 1949, but businessmen were considered politi-
 cally and organizationally unfit at that time.  Local federations
 of these "national bourgeoisie" were, however, set up in all large
 cities as channels of communication between municipal govern-
 ments and private companies. A preparatory committee for
 establishing the ACFICA on the national level was finally estab-
 lished in June 1952, after the anti-corruption campaign had thor-
 oughly cowed all sectors of private business.
 In large measure the membership of this organization over-
 laps that of the Democratic National Construction Association
 (see Part II under Satellite Parties).  The federation, however,
 is not limited to China's big business; it includes associations of

 representatives of joint private-state enterprises, state-owned
 enterprises and cooperatives (also separately organized under the
 All China Federation of Cooperatives), and handicraft entrepre-
 neurs, vendors, and street hawkers.
 The primary task of the ACFICA is to impose systematically
 the various stages of "socialist transformation" upon the target
 groups named above. To the businessman "socialist transfor-
 mation" means liquidation of private enterprise in favor of state
 control or joint state-private control of all means of production
 and commerce.  Conceivably the Communists could have elimi-
 nated all vestiges of private business. Instead, they have chosen
 thus far to reform the businessman in their own image.
 In the closing months of 1955 the ACFICA was placed by the
 CC:P in the forefront of a nationwide campaign to eliminate pri-
 vate enterprise.                     In January 1956 Peking announced that private
 industry and commerce in all major cities had been converted
 to state or joint state-private ownership, and predicted that com-
 plete state ownership and control would be achieved within
 three years.

 privately owned commercial enterprises, commercial cooperatives,

 fits into the over-all picture (whether under the ACFTU or
 ACFICA) is not clearly established, although it is believed to be
 one of the associations affiliated with the ACFICA.  Sometimes,

 M. All China Federation of Cooperatives (ACFC)
 Formed in June 1951, the ACFC claimed 120,000,000 members
 in over 36,000 supply and marketing cooperatives by January
 1953.  Most of these cooperatives are in the rural areas, where
 Communist assertions claim nearly 32,000 associations serving
 the supply and marketing needs of over 95,000,000 peasant
 members.
 Cooperatives affiliated with the ACFC should be distinguished
 from state-administered agricultural producer cooperatives (the
 precursors of collective farms).  Although the functional rela-
 tionship between the two has never been clearly defined, it is
 believed that the ACFC and its affiliates support the agricultural
 producer cooperatives with basic equipment, seed, etc., and assist
 the state in marketing the latter's product.
 The ACFC also apparently encompasses groups concerned with
 the handicraft trades and with the production and marketing of
 certain industrial products.
 The All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooper-
 atives, often mentioned, is believed to be a part of, or perhaps
 identical with, the ACFC.

 N. All China Federation of Literature and Art Circles
 (ACFLAC)
 The ACFLAC, into which associations of authors, journalists,
 musicians, painters, and actors have been incorporated, was
 formed in 1949.  Because of their potentially "dangerous indi-
 vidualism" and usefulness in propaganda activities, writers and
 artists have always been of particular interest to the CCP.
 The thesis that literature and art are subordinate to and should
 be subjected to political requirements, as postulated by MAO Tse-
 tung in 1942, was endorsed by the ACFLAC at its founding and
 has served as its basic orientation ever since.
 The activities of the ACFLAC are twofold: security and propa-
 ganda.  Its primary task is to identify and control actual or
 potential dissidents among those in the fold encompassed by
 ACFLAC.  In addition, the ACFLAC through its propaganda
 organs and other channels of communication popularizes impor-
 tant programs of the party and government. To date its ranks
 have been the object of a continuous process of ideological
 remolding.
 Among its member organizations are included the national
 and local organizations of the All China Federation of Journal-
 ists (also known as the All China Journalists' Association), the
 Union of Chinese Writers, the Union of Chinese Musicians, the
 Union of Chinese Stage Artists, the Union of Chinese Dance Art-
 ists, the All China Federation of Artists, and the All China Fed-
 eration of Cinema Workers.

 Natural and social scientists have been organized under the
 ACFSS, which is composed of some 33 separate associations
 devoted to the study of everything from gardening to geophysics.
 It is not to be confused with the All China Association for the
 Dissemination of Scientific and Technical Knowledge (see Part
 IV), a broad propaganda front in which many non-scientists also
 participate.
 The China Academy of Sciences is an official organ set up
 under government control and bears a close relationship to the
 ACFSS and the ADSTK.  An International Relations Institute
 was set up under the Academy of Sciences in November 1956 to
 acquire, study, and apply scientific information from sources
 outside Communist China. Director of this institute is MENG
 Yung-ch'ien; his deputies are CHEN Han-sheng and LIU Ssu-mu.
 One of the chief affiliates of the ACFSS is the All China Asso-
 ciation of Medical Societies, the officers of which are active in
 the World Congress of Doctors (an international Communist
 front). This association has developed contacts with medical
 groups in non-Communist countries.

 On 17 June 1956, following a symposium sponsored by the

 committee to create the FROCA was formed. At a meeting of
 the National People's Congress on 8 June 1956, FANG Fang, a
 deputy director of the government's Commission of Chinese
 Affairs (COCA), suggested the, formation of a national organi-
 zation of this type as a means of strengthening local Returned
 Overseas Chinese Associations which had been set up in munici-
 palities and areas where returnees or their dependents have been
 concentrated. Membership in the FROCA is made up of the
 many local associations of returned overseas Chinese.

 V. Christian Religious Circles (CRC)
 Although Chinese Communist propaganda frequently refers
 to such a grouping as Christian Religious Circles (CRC), how
 formal this grouping may be is not clear. It has been estimated
 that there are (or were) 3.7 million Christians on the China
 mainland.  That the regime recognizes potential opposition from
 this group to the communization of China is evident from the
 repeated charges against religious leaders as "counterrevolu-
 tionaries" and from the public trials held to punish some of them.
 One Radio Peking announcement claimed that 30,000 peasants
 from 110 villages attended the public trial in a suburb of Mukden
 of a group of Roman Catholic church personalities. Although
 such arrests and trials are widely publicized, other church leaders
 are quoted in Chinese Communist propaganda releases as prais-
 ing religious freedom in China, and urging their religious groups
 to :follow the Communist lead and to expose those who do not.
 Whether such statements are correctly attributed to certain reli-
 gious leaders or whether they were obtained by threats or other
 pressures is not known.
 Shortly after the Chinese Communist take-over a three-phase
 "Christian Independent Reform Movement" was instituted,

 designed to bring religion in China in line with Communist
 objectives.  Leaders in this movement were identified as TSUI
 Hsien-hsiang and LIU Shou-pao.  This movement to stamp out
 or at least neutralize religion in China was obviously successful,
 because almost all foreign clerics and missionaries have been
 deported or jailed, or their movement and activities have been
 restricted.  Some of those who have gone along with the Com-
 munists, willingly or not, are used for propaganda purposes
 through such organizations as the CPPCC.  For example, 73-
 year-old Rev. Marcus CHENG, president of the Chungking The-
 ological Seminary and one of 21 speakers at a meeting of the
 CPPCC in February 1956, praised the "new Socialist society."
 In March 1956 the "National Committee of the Protestant
 Churches of China for Self-Determination" brought together 233
 leaders of 70 Protestant denominations to honor a group of visit-
 ing church leaders from abroad and to plan the committee's
 program for future activity. Y. T. WU (WU Yao-tsung), chair-
 man of this committee, represents Christian Religious Circles
 on the CPPCC, is a member of the China Peace Committee and
 All China Federation of Democratic Youth, and edited the Chinese
 YMCA publication in Shanghai.  WU, in his address before a
 meeting of the committee, described the "three-self movement"
 in Chinese religious circles as "self-administration, self-support,
 and self-propagation." WU described Chinese Communism as "a
 Socialistic order that is just, charitable, and in full harmony with
 our Christian belief."
 Among those publicized, with or without their consent, by the
 Chinese Communists as Christian leaders favorable to the regime
 are:
 CHAO Fu-san, Deputy Secretary, Peiping YMCA.
 CHAO Tz'u-chen, member of national committee : "Christian
 Churches in China for Realization of Self-Determination"; dean
 of the Department of Theology, Yenching University.

 APPENDIX TO PART III
 DEMOCRATIC PERSONAGES AND INTELLECTUALS
 Democratic Personages
 In Chinese Communist terminology, that group formerly most
 frequently referred to as "democratic personages" is now usually
 called "democratic nonpartisans." This designation is given to
 those persons who were leaders in their respective fields prior
 to the Chinese Communist take-over, who were not then and have
 not since become specifically identified with any of the smaller
 political parties, yet are well-known to and respected by the
 Chinese people.  Many "democratic personages" were invited to
 the first CPPCC in 1949, when the Chinese Communist program
 was adopted and a formal Chinese People's Government was set
 up.  A few were named to government posts.  Twelve "demo-
 cratic nonpartisans," among those named to the National Exec-
 utive Committee of the CPPCC in 1956, represent a larger group
 over which close scrutiny is maintained by the United Front
 Department.  These individuals represent potential rallying
 points around which groups of lesser personalities, who might
 become dissatisfied with the Chinese Communist regime, could
 gather. No attempt will be made herein to list persons falling
 in this category, because there is often a thin line of distinction
 between them and those playing the Communist game as leaders
 of the various satellite parties, people's organizations, domestic
 and international fronts.  Further, there is reason to suspect
 that many of these "democratic nonpartisans" are actually secret
 CCP members wearing a false label for propaganda and other
 purposes serving Communist objectives.
 One example (probably the most noteworthy) is the case of
 KUO Mo-jo.  Although he is called a "democratic nonpartisan,"
 the multiplicity of his connections with the government, All China
 federations, and the various domestic and international Commu-
 nist fronts may be seen by referring to his listing under the alpha-
 betical grouping at the end of this paper.
 Among other of KUO's services to the Chinese Communist
 cause, he is Chairman of the "Chinese People's Committee in
 Support of Egypt's Resistance to Aggression." He is a partici-

 pant in virtually all Chinese Communist domestic fronts and
 campaigns and is found in the forefront, parroting the Chinese
 Communist line, on all occasions.  It is obvious that there is
 no ideological distinction between his position on all important
 domestic and international issues and that of an open, ardent
 Communist.  The Communists apparently feel, however, that
 there is an advantage in obtaining the help of KUO and others
 of his type to create the illusion that those outside the CCP who
 are not affiliated with non-Communist political parties accept
 the Communist line whole-heartedly.  The grouping as "demo-
 cratic nonpartisans" does not appear to call for any formal organ-
 ization among these personages but rather to place them within
 a category requiring special handling and surveillance by the
 Party. It also conveniently groups them for propaganda purposes.
 This is another group which is not formally organized and
 cuts across lines of all other groups.  It is dealt with here only
 because of the great emphasis recently given to persons so defined
 in Chinese Communist terminology. A concerted effort is being
 made to bring them within the membership of other, more formal
 organizations which would simplify their use and control.
 Late in 1955 the campaign to "unite and reform" intellectuals
 was begun under United Front Department auspices in the form
 of speeches and discussions at special meetings of the various
 satellite political parties.  For example, at the meeting of the
 China Democratic League in December 1955, the league heard its
 vice chairman state, "It is necessary for intellectuals - particu-
 larly those who have a high social position or possess high tech-
 nical and special knowledge - to make further contribution to
 the Socialist construction and to conduct a thorough review and
 study of the various aspects of work, life, and learning among the
 intellectuals, as well as their existing problems.  This will assist
 the Party and Government in further improving the unity and
 Socialist transformation of the intellectuals."  All other satellite
 parties adopted similar proclamations. An article in People's
 Daily on 20 January 1956 told of a number of professors and
 teachers who had been admitted to Communist Party member-
 ship and urged the party to admit more to membership to
 strengthen its ideological and political leadership over intellec-
 tuals as a group.

 The CCP called a conference from January 14 to 20 to consider
 the subject, and MAO Tse-tung called on "all members to master
 scientific knowledge diligently and to unite with intellectuals
 outside the Party so that the country may quickly catch up with
 the advanced level of world science." Among 61 speeches deliv-
 ered and 29 other speeches printed and issued at the CCP con-
 ference on the subject, that of Premier CHOU En-lai called for
 an end to the policy of "closed-doorism" under which the in-
 telligentsia had been denied party membership and called for
 the party to enroll one-third of the "high-level" intellectuals
 within the next six years.  This position revealed quite a reversal
 of the attitude expressed by the campaign. against intellectuals
 in 1955 after the announced arrest of the HU Feng group and
 the conviction of members as counterrevolutionaries.  CHOU
 called for a policy of trusting intellectuals and relieving them
 of other duties so that they could concentrate on their special-
 ties, referred to them as "precious property of the state," called
 for a policy of "taking care of all old-fashioned intellectuals," and
 demanded development and mobilization of the current strength
 of the intellectuals.  CHOU estimated that there were 3.84 mil-
 lion intellectuals in China, of whom he classed 100,000 as "high-
 level."  He said that one-third of the latter have entered this
 category since 1949.  CHOU divided intellectuals into four
 groups : (1) CCP members; (2) candidates and potential candi-
 dates for party membership; (3) middle-of-the-roaders; (4) coun-
 terrevolutionary elements.  Apparently there had been many
 complaints from intellectuals, for CHOU demanded that they be
 given regular hours for their own functional work, free from
 compulsory political study and conferences; that they be relieved
 of the many concurrent jobs to which they had been assigned;
 that they should not be required to "listen to certain long lectures
 repeatedly"; that those who "have been assigned to positions
 completely alien to their past training" be reassigned to make
 better use of their talents; that their living conditions be improved
 by better food and housing for high-level persons and relief from
 having to earn a livelihood; that their ideological transformation
 be accelerated; and that they be permitted to join the CCP.
 To expedite the implementation of the new CCP line, the State
 Council was directed by the CCP Central Committee to set up a
 China Specialists Bureau responsible for "unified planning, uni-
 fied examination and supervision in questions of an administra-

 tive character concerning high-level intellectuals, having author-
 ity to correct, in accordance with established procedures, any
 improper handling of matters by various departments concerned
 relating to high-level intellectuals.  Under the supervision of
 the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee (CCP),
 the various departments concerned should take direct charge of
 questions of a political character in connection with the intel-
 lectuals, of the question of continuing ideological reform, and of
 the question of handling counterrevolutionaries."
 This CCP conference was shortly followed by a national meet-
 ing of the CPPCC, at which time the various non-Communist
 political parties competed with one another in speechmaking and
 resolutions designed to implement CCP orders on the subject.
 The programs outlined called not only for developing the poten-
 tial of "existing" intelligentsia, but also for the strengthening
 of its ranks with "new blood." The campaign has since been
 carried down to local and regional levels through organizations
 and committees of the non-Communist parties, All China federa-
 tions, other front organizations, and CPPCC organs at those levels.
 The following quotes from various broadcasts by Radio Peking
 in March and April 1956 indicate the results : "Twenty-one pro-
 fessors and assistant professors of various institutes of higher
 education in Peking were recently admitted to the Communist
 Party" . . . "During the first 21/z months of 1956, 120 highly
 trained intellectuals of Shanghai joined the Chinese Communist
 Party" . . . "A national committee for the admission of students
 to institutions of higher learning has been formed in Peking to
 strengthen the guidance in enrollment of such students this

 and instructors attended a lecture on how to strive to become
 a Communist Party member at Hsinghua University in Peking
 on March 21" . . . CHOU En-lai's report on the intelligentsia

 and Chungking a group of intellectuals recently joined the CCP.
 Many of these intellectuals were elected advanced producers and
 labor models" ... "864 intellectuals were admitted to the CCP
 in Kansu Province ... 73 of them are high-level intellectuals."
 Peking Radio stated 9 May 1956, "According to statistics for
 January through April, proper arrangements were made for some
 6,470 unemployed intellectuals in Fukien..  They are now work-
 ing in various government departments, commercial firms, fac-
 tories, schools, and agricultural cooperatives."
 Another Peking broadcast on 28 April 1956 said, "Many gov-
 ernmental organs and schools in Szechwan have improved work-
 ing conditions of highly trained intellectuals.                       The Health Bureau
 of Chengtu recently bought medical equipment for hospitals and

 PART IV
 OTHER FRONT ORGANIZATIONS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 A. General
 This section. describes people's organizations or fronts on a
 national level, other than the All China federations, inside Com-
 munist China.  An All China federation is an organizational
 device used by the CCP to mobilize, control, and channel the
 energies of all persons in a particular social, economic, profes-
 sional, religious, or vocational group. For example, the ACFTU
 was formed by the CCP for the purpose of mobilizing and direct-
 ing the energies of all members of the laboring class; the ACFLAC
 was established for the purpose of mobilizing journalists, writers,
 and other artists. Practically all elements of the population not
 already organized under the Party, the government, the military,
 or the satellite political parties have been drawn into group
 activity by one or another of the various All China federations.
 A front, other than the All China federations, is an instrument
 used by the CCP to mobilize a number of federations and impor-
 tant persons in support of an important propaganda program.
 Membership in such, front organizations cuts across the social,
 professional, and vocational lines which are used to determine
 the composition of a federation. For example, the National
 Illiteracy Elimination Association, a front organization with
 responsibility for implementing the nationwide campaign to elim-
 inate illiteracy, was formed by representatives of student, youth,
 women's, labor, and other mass organizations.  The Association
 for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, a front for increas-
 ing cultural exchange with non-Communist countries, was formed
 by the joint action of the ACFTU, ACFDY', ACSF, ACDWF, and
 other mass organizations.
 Only the important fronts have been discussed in this section.
 In the brief accounts which follow, emphasis has been placed on
 identifying key figures in each of the fronts and describing each
 organization's function.

 B. China Peace Committee (CPC)
 The CPC was formed in October 1950, when the previous China
 Peace Committee and the "Chinese People's Committee to Resist
 American Aggression and Aid Korea" were merged.  Virtually
 all important persons in the CCP, non-Communist political par-
 ties, All China federations, and other front organizations are
 said to be members of the CPC. Headquarters is in Peking, and
 branches are located in all principal regions and municipalities.
 The CPC has its own Liaison, Organization, and Propaganda
 Departments.
 Officials of the CPC include :
 Chairman            KUO Mo-jo

 C. Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with
 Foreign Countries (ACRFC)
 The ACRFC was founded on 3 May 1954 in Peking at a meeting
 of persons representing various mass and front organizations.
 According to the New China News Agency, its purpose is "to
 develop still further the friendly relations between the Chinese
 people and the people of various other countries and to promote
 cultural exchange between them." Elaborating upon the same
 theme, the 1955 People's Handbook listed the following among
 the functions of the ACRFC : (1) to pass upon joint delega-
 tions, joint exhibitions, memorial meetings, demonstrations, the
 exchange of materials and publications, and correspondence and
 liaison activities designed to introduce the achievements of Chi-
 nese culture to the peoples of other countries; (2) to introduce
 the cultural achievements of other countries to the Chinese
 people; and (3) to create closer relations with its counterparts
 abroad (i. e., other societies for cultural relations with foreign
 countries), with friendship associations, and with other organi-
 zations.

 A survey of its activities discloses that the ACRFC was formed
 to conduct the Chinese Communist cultural offensive, principally
 in non-Communist nations.           Relations with the Soviet orbit are
 provided for by numerous diplomatic agreements on cultural
 exchange and frequent government-to-government contact.

 D. Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (PIFA)
 The PIFA was established in December 1949.  Its ostensible
 function is to conduct academic research on important interna-
 tional questions. According to its constitution, the PIFA can
 make suggestions to the Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 It has been especially active in developing contacts with govern-
 ment officials, particularly legislators, in non-Communist coun-
 tries and in campaigning for recognition of the Peking govern-
 ment, or closer ties if recognition has already been extended.  In
 the past 18 months the PIFA has been host to lawmakers from
 Japan, Indonesia, India, France, Italy, Great Britain, Australia,
 New Zealand, Brazil, Finland, and other countries.  The PIFA,
 unlike other front and mass organizations in China, appears to
 be an exclusive club in which membership is limited to senior
 officials in the Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
 others who, because of previous training and experience, might
 be useful in informal diplomacy with non.-Communist countries.
 It is probable that only those above the rank of Division Director
 in the Foreign Ministry are eligible for membership on the Board
 of Directors of PIFA.  The general membership seems, however,
 to be more diversified. For example, it was announced by Radio
 Peking on 23 August 1956 that CHENG Wen-hua, a recently
 returned student who had studied international law in the United
 States, had been assigned to the working staff of the PIFA.

 E. Chinese People's Parliamentary Group (CPPG)
 In addition to participating actively in the functions of the
 international Communist front organizations, Communist China
 is attempting to gain admission to non-Communist international
 organizations.  In July 1955, at its second session, the National
 People's Congress of China formed the CPPG. Its purpose is to
 gain admission to the Interparliamentary Union (IPU), an asso-
 ciation of legislative bodies the aim of which is to promote per-
 sonal contacts between lawmakers throughout the world and
 eventually in the United Nations. The CPPG announced that a
 delegation from China, consisting of twenty-seven persons, would
 attend the 44th Conference of the IPU, which was scheduled to
 open 25 August 1955 in Helsinki. The 27 persons named to this
 delegation included P'ENG Chen as chief, CH'ENG Ch'ien and
 LIAO Ch'eng-chih as deputies, and LI I-mang as secretary.
 Only two of the delegates, LI I-mang and WU Wen-tao, actually
 made the trip. When the Conference announced its decision to
 defer the question of seating Communist China, the CPPG pro-
 tested vigorously.  The question was raised at subsequent meet-
 ings of the IPU's Executive Committee. At its meeting held in
 Dbrovnik in April 1956, the Executive Committee announced that
 it would not consider the question of admitting Communist China
 until the United Nations has resolved this problem.  Observers

 (CCPI T )
 The CCPIT was established in May 1952.  It has two main
 objectives: (1) to persuade businessmen in non-Communist coun-
 tries that strategic embargoes on trade with the Soviet bloc and
 China are detrimental to their own best interests; and (2) to
 develop trade relations with non-Communist countries. It is
 closely affiliated with the International Committee for Promo-
 tion of Trade (ICPT), a world Communist front.  The CCPIT has
 also sent numerous trade delegations to Japan, South Asia, the
 Near and Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Latin America; spon-
 sored numerous exhibits at the various international fairs; and
 concluded trade agreements with commercial groups in Great
 Britain, Japan, France, Italy, Ceylon, Egypt, Burma, India, and

 G. All China Association for Dissemination of Scientific and Tech-

 Headquarters are in Peking. ADSTK is affiliated closely with
 the All China Federation of Scientific Societies and is usually
 mentioned along with the latter. It is comparable to the Soviet
 organization known as "Association for Popularizing Political
 and Scientific Knowledge of the USSR." It produces exhibits and
 motion pictures, gives lectures, and publishes materials on popu-
 lar science. At a meeting of the association in February 1956
 it was claimed that 31 branch associations had been formed at
 regional or provincial level throughout the country and that
 110 branch associations had been established by provincial gov-
 ernments at the municipal and county level. It was also claimed
 that 36,000 specialists, professors, engineers, medical doctors, and
 other scientists and technicians had joined these associations.
 During the previous five years the associations were said to
 have sponsored over 48,000 scientific lectures and reports, pre-
 sented over 3,100 scientific exhibits, and compiled over 2,300 cate-
 gories of reading materials in popular science, of which 13 mil-
 lion copies were distributed. The association sponsors two maga-
 zines on popular science with a claimed circulation of 142,000
 copies The February 1956 announcement said : "In order to
 assist the people in establishing a materialist world outlook and
 in overcoming superstitious ideas, the Association has conducted
 publicity on the history and development of nature, the solar and
 lunar eclipse, and other subjects."
 Lectures are held on the Soviet Union and on Soviet accom-
 plishments in science and technology. The All China Federation
 of Trade Unions alone is said to have requested the association
 to present 390,000 lectures to trade-union groups in 1956, and

 the People's Liberation Army was claimed to have asked that
 each soldier and officer be given the opportunity to hear at least
 one lecture per month.  Similar requests were said to have been

 H. National Illiteracy Elimination Association (NIEA)
 The NIEA is one of those special groups set up by Communist
 China to achieve specific results and to engage in propaganda
 activities in connection with the implementation of its objectives.
 There are many of these groups. Another, for example, is the
 "National Committee for the Admission of Students to Institu-
 tions of Higher Learning."  These are ad hoc groups in that
 they exist only until their assigned tasks are uncompleted.
 The aim of this association is to assist the government to
 mobilize and organize all persons and forces available in China
 in eliminating widespread illiteracy among masses of the Chinese
 people.  Anyone willing to assist in this task may join the asso-
 ciation; membership of entire groups, such as the All China
 Federation of Trade Unions, is encouraged.  Subsidiary groups
 are organized, down to the lowest level of villages, streets, and
 roads.

 bers are drawn from persons engaged in education, propaganda,
 minority groups, religious circles, youth organizations, and the
 entire range of organizations controlling the masses. The sec-
 retary general is LIN Han-ta, representative to the National
 People's Congress from Shanghai and a member of the executive
 committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy,
 one of the satellite political parties. The association was formally
 established in March 1956 to eradicate illiteracy in China within
 five to seven years.  China New Democratic Youth League (now
 Young Communist League) organs were urged to establish illit-
 eracy-eradication teams.  Some idea of the project can be gained
 from the following summary of a news dispatch from Peking on
 3 April 1956:
 "Some 380,000 persons in Peking are now attending literacy
 classes.  They represent more than half the total number of
 people in the capital who are unable to read and write. Among
 them are practically all illiterate industrial workers, two-thirds
 of the illiterate peasants in the Peking area, workers in the com-
 mercial enterprises, and many handicraftsmen."
 If this represents approximately half the illiterate in Peking,
 the total illiterates would be 760,000 out of an approximate total
 population of less than 2,000,000, or more than one-third of the
 population of China's most advanced city.
 In Kwangtung and Tsingtao more than four million illiterates
 and semi-illiterates, representing one-third of Kwangtung's
 illiterates and semi-illiterates, were said now to be in schools.
 In Tsingtao city 154,000 illiterates and semi-illiterates, about 59
 percent of the total illiterates and semi-illiterates in that city,
 were to be given instruction.
 In a speech of 9 May 1956, CH'IEN Chun-jui, prominent mem-
 ber of various front organizations and vice-director of the Second
 Staff Office of the State Council, claimed that, as of March 1956,
 75 million peasants were attending literacy classes. He claimed
 210,000 students graduated from college in Communist China
 between 1949 and 1955. He called for effort to learn modern
 sciences and technology, not only from Communist but from
 capitalist countries as well.

 1. Sino-Soviet Friendship Association (SSFA)
 The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is in reality simply
 a front organization with a mass membership in Communist
 China and is not to be viewed in the light of the China friendship
 associations in the free, non-Sino-Soviet bloc nations.
 The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established in 1950
 after MAO Tse-tung returned from Moscow. It is a mass front
 organization claiming a membership of more than 50,000,000 (or
 perhaps more, now that the All China Federation of Democratic
 Youth, the CCP, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and others
 of the All China federations are reported to have joined the
 SSFA en bloc). Branches are in every major city and scattered
 throughout all the provinces of China. The SSFA is a major
 instrument in the over-all Communist design to Sovietize Chinese
 politics, economics, and thought and to tie the Chinese people
 solidly into the international Communist movement.  The SSFA
 is the parent and sponsor of such friendship societies as the
 Japan-Soviet Friendship Society, the Japan.-China Friendship
 Association, and similar groups in Asian countries in which the
 governments permit them to exist.  Among the advantages of
 these friendship associations are their informality of member-
 ship, simplicity of implementation, adaptability to propaganda
 use, and suitability for concealing their real objectives.
 Among the activities and functions of the SSFA as indicated
 from various reports are the following:
 a. Convincing the Chinese people of the advantages of the
 presence of Soviet advisers and praising their accomplishments
 on behalf of China.  One of the slogans is "Leaning to One Side"
 (meaning closer relations with the Soviets).
 b. Promoting and conducting annual celebrations of the sign-
 ing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual
 Assistance, and of anniversaries of the October Revolution.

 c. Adopting and spreading Communist doctrines and giving
 voice to both international Communist propaganda and that
 intended for internal consumption in China.
 d. Organizing and sending delegations to international meet-
 ings, to the Soviet Union for study, and on cultural jaunts
 throughout Asia and the iron curtain countries to foster and pro-
 mote the concept of Communist solidarity.
 e. Establishing and promoting Russian-language classes among
 all groups in China.
 f. Promoting annual Sino-Soviet Friendship Month activities.
 g. Fostering anti-American, anti-imperialist, and "peace" lines
 of propaganda as originated in Moscow.
 Ostensible objectives are described in the definition of the Sino-
 Soviet Friendship Association as given in the Guide to New China
 for 1952, in which the SSFA is listed as one of the "people's organi-
 zations," as follows: "The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a
 social organization of the Chinese people. Its aims are to develop
 and consolidate friendship and cooperation between the Chinese
 and the Soviet peoples, to accelerate the interflow of knowledge
 and experience between them, and to strengthen the close unity
 between the two nations in their common struggle for lasting
 world peace.  The Association, established on 5 October 1949, in
 Peking, has 1,260 branches, 44,778 sub-branches, and a member-
 ship of 18 million."
 Since its establishment, according to the 1952 Guide to New
 China, it has "sponsored and conducted various activities for the
 strengthening of friendship between China and the Soviet Union,
 including lectures, exhibitions, films, slides, the publication of
 pamphlets, and the exchange of cultural delegations.  During
 the past two years the Association and its branches have pub-
 lished 74 periodicals and more than 500 pamphlets; it has sent
 out 140 projection teams to present film shows to the people of
 various places. The reports of 48 teams record a total of 7,466
 cinema shows with an aggregate attendance of 12,097,000 people."
 By means of propaganda and educational activities the Asso-
 ciation seeks intensive indoctrination of the Chinese people with
 knowledge of the social and governmental systems of the Soviet
 Union, and its achievements in socialist reconstruction and pro-
 duction, thus "helping the Chinese people to understand how

 the Soviet people live and work under the socialist system and
 many other aspects of life in the Soviet Union."
 The Association has on the other hand "made available to the
 Soviet people information and material concerning the life and
 the reconstruction work of the Chinese people. A constant flow
 of books, pictorials, musical records, and films describing the new
 life of the Chinese people is sent to the Soviet Union by the
 Association."
 A Peking Chinese Home Service Broadcast of 12 February 1953
 stated, "Commemorating the third anniversary of the signing
 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual
 Assistance, the Peking Chapter of the Sino-Soviet Friendship
 Association and the Soviet VOKS in Peking held a meeting on
 the evening of February 12 at which TENG 'Tai-yuan, Minister
 of Railways of the Central People's Government, delivered a
 report.
 "Among those who attended were responsible personnel of the
 Peking SSFA chapter and SSFA members in various Government
 offices, people's organizations, factories, enterprises, and schools
 in Peking, totaling more than 1,000 people. In addition, more
 than 100 Soviet friends attended the meeting, :including the Soviet
 VOKS delegates and personnel of the Soviet :Embassy in China."
 Soviet Friendship Societies are described in Staff Study No. 3,
 "The Soviet Propaganda Program," published by the Sub-Com-
 mittee on Overseas Information Programs of the United States
 of the U. S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  A partial quo-
 tation follows: "Next to the members of the foreign Communist
 parties, the most important supporting elements for Soviet propa-
 ganda are the myriad Soviet Friendship Societies.  Originally,
 these were tiny groups virtually indistinguishable from the Com-
 munist Parties themselves....
 "The postwar pattern of the Friendship Societies in the West
 is still to serve primarily as instruments for reaching an audience
 normally unreceptive to outright Communist propaganda and
 which might be reached by appeals to peace, humanism, and
 cultural understanding.  To this end, most of their publicized
 leaders are whatever clergymen, professors, philanthropists, and
 other non-Communists that can be persuaded to participate.
 Louis Nemzer, who has written authoritatively on the subject,
 states that even if the cold war pressures make membership fall

 off more sharply than has so far been the case, these societies will
 be retained as a weapon which proved its worth in rallying for-
 eign masses to support of the U.S.S.R. in a crucial situation and
 may be able to do so again.        Within the Soviet orbit itself the
 Friendship Societies have become an important device for cement-
 ing the satellites to the Soviet Union."
