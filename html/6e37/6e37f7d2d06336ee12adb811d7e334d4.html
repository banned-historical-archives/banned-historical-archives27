 THE MARXIST WORLD
 Lure of
 Capitalism
 It's a bitter pill for them to swallow-
 yet Communist rulers almost everywhere
 are adopting free-enterprise practices
 to shore up their faltering economies.
 From the rice fields and restaurants of China to the
 boutiques of Hungary and the factories of Yugoslavia, a
 revolution is brewing in the Communist world-a free-
 enterprise revolution.
 In one Communist country after another, total state con-
 trol of the economy is being relaxed as a variety of experi-
 ments are introduced that owe little to centralized plan-
 ning and still less to Marx or Lenin.
 Already some remarkable developments are on record.
 In China, state-owned enterprises have been authorized
 to issue stocks and bonds to raise funds. Dividends are
 being paid to worker-shareholders.
 In Yugoslavia, a new law requires factories that are chron-
 ic loss takers to reduce wages to the legal minimum. In
 Hungary, officials admit openly that the country is moving
 away from the traditional Marxist goal of total social equality.
 Even in the Soviet Union, whose Communist Party is the
 most resistant to free-market reforms, the wind of change is
 starting to blow. One example: Some service industries now
 are permitted to keep any profits they earn.
 As drastic as these changes seem, the ideological about-
 face that underpins them is still more revolutionary. Stated
 a report issuedin October, 1984, by the Central Committee
 of the Chinese Communist Party: "Only when some indi-
 viduals are allowed and encouraged to get better off first,
 through diligent work, will more and more people be
 prompted to take the road of prosperity."
 Strict limits are placed on most of these reforms. No-
 where are key industries such as steel and oil slipping out of
 state control. Large, privately owned companies still are
 universally banned, and nowhere do the changes so far
 seem radical enough to threaten the ruling Communist
 Party's monopoly on political power.
 Yet what is occurring represents such a vast psychological
 break with the past for Marxist societies steeped in the
 doctrine of total state control of the economy that the long-
 term effects are incalculable. So why is the risk being taken?
 Among Western specialists, one answer is given time and
 again: The complexities of developing and operating a
 modern economy are proving incompatible with the strait-
 jacket of centralized planning and control.
 On paper, some evidence does exist that Communist states
 are pulling out of their economic slump. A recent report by
 the Economic Commission for Europe, for instance, found
 that the Soviet bloc's hard-currency debts are falling, output
 is rising and trade with the West is in surplus again.
 This turnaround, however, masks enduring problems that
 show no sign of easing. In every Communist state, long-
 term-growth prospects are poor, productivity low and inno-
 vation lacking. Almost all suffer from persistent shortages of
 basic consumer items. Black markets flourish. Often, as in
 Poland, it is the independent-minded farmers who produce
 much of their country's food supplies on private plots.
 To find out why the Communist world is reassessing
 Marxist economic practices and increasingly looking to the
 West for answers, the magazine queried its correspondents
 in five key nations. Their reports follow.
 Destroying the System to Save It
 PEKING
 For three decades, Chinese consumers' desires were san
 da jian, or "three big pieces"-a wristwatch, a bicycle and a
 foot-powered sewing machine.
 Now, in a development that mirrors the revolution in
 attitudes and policies sweeping the Communist world's most
 populous nation, the goal has
 moved up to a color-television set,
 player.
 The impact of these changes on
 Communist ideology is reflected
 in an editorial in the official Peo-
 ple's Daily newspaper published
 in December. "We cannot de-
 pend on works of Marx and Lenin
 to solve all of today's problems....
 The economy is a vast sea, and
 there are many questions that are
 not written in books. [These ques-
 tions] require us to investigate re-
 ality to find solutions."
 Behind such unlikely state-
 ments lie 35 years of fruitless
 striving by the Chinese for Marx-
 ist purity-and the conclusion by
 Peking's current leaders that
 they must now risk destroying
 the Communist system in order
 to save it.
 Today, in what amounts to the
 boldest departure from Marxist
 theory ever attempted by a rul-
 ing Communist party, free-mar-

 the first peasant to buy a privately owned automobile in the
 Chinese Communist era.
 In the cities, too, the spirit of free enterprise appears
 contagious. As if to set a proper example, Peking has an-
 nounced an end to the standard 2-hour lunch-nap-shopping
 break taken by government workers at midday. Western
 bankers in the capital complain of being importuned by
 individuals to invest in anything from auto-repair business-
 es to joint-venture airlines. An entire street in the Manchu-
 rian city of Harbin is given over to the sale of new, private-
 ly made vinyl sofas. Similar free markets can be found in
 cities such as Canton, Shanghai and Chengdu.
 Behind word pictures like these lies a sustained campaign
 by Deng Xiaoping and his political allies to reduce waste and
 inefficiency in China, stimulate innovation and foster the
 manufacture of the kind of consumer goods commonplace
 in Asian free-enterprise strongholds such as Singapore.
 Yet this explosion of entrepreneurship is not without
 problems. And it holds dangers of its own as Deng ages and
 a struggle to succeed him threatens in the future.
 Even now a gap between peasant haves and have-nots is
 emerging, with at least 22 million farmers estimated to be
 earning less than $50 a year. Already some parents are said
 to be pulling children out of school to buttress the family
 work force. Others are reported to have violated China's
 strict one-child rule for the same reason. There has also
 been a noticeable surge in corruption and fraud.
 Down the line, other difficulties loom. With the breakup
 of Mao Tse-tung's cherished commune system, many of the
 highly subsidized services once provided to rural families-
 schooling, health care, old-age welfare-are falling away.
 The easing of price controls could touch off inflationary
 pressures on the economy. Widespread fear of such an
 explosion prompted the government in January to reassure

 ket principles have become China's new orthodoxy. The
 aim: Nothing less than the quadrupling of gross national
 output and per capita income within 20 years.
 At the center of this gamble is the country's feisty 80-
 year-old leader, Deng Xiaoping-the same man once de-
 nounced by leftist zealots as a "capitalist roader." Since
 gaining ultimate authority in 1978, Deng has-
 ^ Abolished most rural communes, restored family farms
 and set up a free market in agricultural and consumer goods.
 ? Championed a bonus-pay scheme allowing managers
 tot reward good workers and penalize poor ones.
 ^ Granted the country's state-owned enterprises wide
 autonomy in the manufacture, distribution and pricing of
 consumer, industrial and agricultural products.
 ^ Opened up China's coastal regions to foreign investors
 and dispatched thousands of students to the West.
 The result? The first surge of prosperity that a generation
 of Chinese citizens born since the Communist victory in
 1949 has ever experienced.
 In six years, peasants' incomes have increased 130 per-
 ut to about $120 a year. Eighty percent of the restau-
 ants, retail stores and service shops opened since 1978 are
 privately owned. Total foreign direct investment in China
 now amounts to more than 8 billion dollars. Bank savings
 currently average $38 per person-about a month's wages
 for an average industrial worker. The self-employed-
 140,000 strong in 1978-today number 7.5 million, includ-
 ing 2 million in cities. Grain output-up 8 percent each
 year since 1979-has risen so much that China has become
 agriculturally self-sufficient.
 Beyond such statistics, personal initiative, stultified by
 decades of official hostility, is reigniting like a prairie fire
 across the length and breadth of this huge country.
 Government tour guides today bus foreigners to visit
 "rich peasants" with incomes as high as $10,000 a year.
 Newly organized farm teams are acquiring small airplanes
 for crop dusting. Farmers are being permitted to build
 spacious new homes of their own. Last year, the media
 even bestowed hero status on a chicken farmer described as
 CHINA. Street tailors in Peking are among 7.5 million workers
 self-employed under government's move to free enterprise.

 workers that prices for most goods and services
 would be held in check until wages were increased.
 Unemployment is another worry. By the turn of
 the century, 400 million people-half the peasant
 population-may be jobless if farm efficiency im-
 proves as much es planned. A similar problem
 could follow industrial modernization.
 Politically, Deng's "socialism with Chinese char-
 acteristics" must navigate some hazardous waters.
 Opponents warn, for example, that the course
 Deng is steering threatens social polarization of a
 kind that fueled the Chinese revolution more than
 50 years ago. In the Communist Party, even Deng's
 supporters fear he is pushing ahead too rapidly.
 Unease also exists among bureaucrats who stand to
 lose authority, as well as diehard Maoists in the
 party and armed forces.
 just how extensive such Opposition is cannot be
 judged accurately by outsiders. Following a nation-
 al instinct for survival developed over 35 turbulent
 years, critics hold their tongues in public. But that
 doubts are widespread is questioned by few West-

 "One fourth of mankind proclaiming that Soviet-style
 Marxism-Leninism doesn't work-that's an intellectual de-
 velopment of major importance," contends a Western dip-
 lomat here. To which most Chinese at the moment are
 inclined to reply with Deng's now famous saying: It matters
 little the color of a cat, so long as it catches mice.
 "Goulash Communism" Works
 BUDAPEST
 If there is a model for China as it spurns the once hallowed
 tenets of Marxism, it can be found in Hungary-since 1968
 the center of economic innovation in the Communist world.
 So high is the standard of living here compared with the
 rest of the Soviet bloc that each year 5 million other East-
 ern Europeans come to this country just for the shopping.
 All over this city, artisans, shopkeepers, taxi drivers and
 restaurateurs operate almost as independently as their
 display Italian designer clothes and American magazines.
 Plush hotels and a casino do a thriving business. Shortages
 are virtually unknown. The bustling atmosphere is more
 similar to Paris than to the drab gloom typical of other
 Eastern European cities.
 These Western-style realities are not limited to the retail
 sector. In agriculture, 40 percent of Hungary's food is pro-
 duced by private farmers. Half a million of the country's
 10.7-million population travel to the West each year. Hun-
 garians may now bid for unsuccessful state-owned compa-
 nies and operate them for set periods in return for a per-
 centage of any profits they make. Communist-run firms are
 issuing bonds to raise capital for investment. No longer must
 factory bosses haggle with central planners over detailed
 targets and resources. Indeed, more than half the prices in
 Hungary are now determined by supply and demand.
 Early in 1985, "goulash Communism," as I lungary's free-
 enterprise experiment is known, advances another step
 when reforms are introduced to raise prices, subject man-
 agers to tighter worker control and deter overemployment.
 In all, 400,000 people may lose their jobs because of the
 changes, and half of them could move into the thriving
 HUNGARY. Farmers selling hogs from trunks of their cars underscore fact
 that 40 percent of the nation's food is produced on private farms.
 private sector.
 How is this shift toward a market economy
 being achieved under the noses of the openly
 disapproving Soviets?
 First, say Western diplomats here, in every key
 respect Hungary is still a loyal Soviet ally. The
 country is firmly integrated into the Warsaw
 Pact. Communist control of political life is as
 tight as ever. And Janos Kadar, the pro-Moscow
 official placed in power by the Kremlin after the
 1956 uprising, retains the Soviets' confidence.
 Second, the "commanding heights" of the
 Even after a 17-year drift from Marxism, 94 per-
 cent of Hungary's industrial output still comes
 from state-owned enterprises and more than half
 the country's trade is with other Soviet-bloc na-
 tions-something that acts as a limit to free-mar-
 ket trends. As one Western observer puts it: "The
 Marxist-Leninist straitjacket may have been loos-
 cried, but it has not been removed."
 Even so, the relaxation of controls has not been

 and had to be bailed out by the International Monetary
 Fund. I lard-currency debts still are quite high. One firm in
 4 is classified as a "problem company" by the Finance
 \linister. Prices, too, have risen steeply since 1982-giving
 rise to consumer grumbling.

 tried here seems incontestable. It is this: The inspiration

 Troubled Self-Management
 BELGRADE
 Marrying Marxism and capitalism is not all smooth sail-
 ing-and no people are better placed to illustrate this than
 the ethnically divided Yugoslavs.
 For the past 37 years, a unique experiment has been
 !nder way here that attempts to be faithful to the principle
 ,i state control of the economy while operating on the
 oped at the center and each of the country's six republics has
 tended to go its own way. "Instead of one .stultifying bureau-
 cracy, there are six," explains a Western economist.
 One result has been wasteful duplication. A train crossing
 the country, for example, must change engines at each
 republic's border because of the separate jurisdictions on the
 national railroad. Investments in steel, oil and nickel mining
 often overlap. Until disaster loomed in 1982, the authorities
 in Belgrade could not even calculate the country's foreign
 debt as a result of freewheeling borrowing by regional banks.
 Other experts here in the Yugoslav capital wonder if this
 country, despite its obvious internal weaknesses, has not
 simply fallen between two chairs-one capitalist, one Marx-
 ist-as it strives to develop.
 So ingrained is the country's self-management system, for
 instance, that many factories have operated free not only of
 state control but also of market disciplines, since Belgrade, in
 most cases, also insures that losing plants stay in business.
 At the same time, self-management has eroded incentives
 to invest profits-so money is rarely set aside for capital
 improvements. In consequence, inefficient industries have

 practical basis of decentralized decision making. Perhaps
 not surprisingly, results have been mixed.
 For nearly three decades under the inspirational leader-
 ship of Josip Broz Tito, all went reasonably well. Growth
 averaged 6 percent, industrial development spread rapidly
 and living standards rose. The state managed the national
 economy, but day-to-day decisions-including wage levels,
 production quotas and marketing strategies-were made
 by worker groups at the factory level.
 In the late 1970s, this system-known as self-manage-
 ment-began to go badly awry. It has still not been corrected.
 Today, inflation hovers around 60 percent. One worker
 in 6 is jobless. Foreign debts total 20 billion dollars. Auster-
 ity measures have cut incomes by 40 percent since 1980.
 Labor unrest is pervasive. Investment is lagging.
 What went wrong?
 To some experts here, Tito's death four years ago is the key
 to the situation. Without Tito-who almost singlehandedly
 held this patchwork country together from 1945 to 1980-

 ket reforms will loosen the Communist
 Party's political grip while doing little to

 accept a more liberal economic system, we
 cannot expect to solve our problems."
 Castro Shifts Gears
 HAVANA
 It was a generation ago that this island nation fell under
 Communist control. Ever since, the state has dictated eco-
 nomic life. Now, the wheel is starting to turn.
 Once committed to rapid industrialization and
 dependence on agriculture, Fidel Castro in the past year
 has begun to adjust Cuban economic priorities to try to
 satisfy pent-up consumer demand. In doing so, he is throw-
 ing overboard many of the economic practices that have
 underpinned Communist rule here since 1959.
 Today, factory managers are being encouraged to circum-
 vent central planners in Havana and work out deals with each
 other. A new law allows Cubans to own their own homes.
 Supermarkets are opening that only sell scarce consumer
 goods at high prices-part of 'a drive to spur worker output.
 Foreign investment is being courted. So are tourists.
 What all this suggests is a more competitive, less egalitari-
 an society. To date, it is not a possibility that frightens
 Castro and his entourage.
 One high official explains that Castro deliberately is try-

 CUBA. Abandoning Communist precepts, Castro is allowing fashion shows to
 help spur consumption at home and attract foreign tourists and investments.
 ing to stimulate domestic consumption in an effort to make
 Cuban factories eventually outpace U.S. plants.
 Such rationalizations for zigzag policies fool few here.
 faced with massive debts to Moscow, the inability of the
 Soviet Union to offer much additional help and a longstand-
 ing U.S. trade embargo, Castro now has little choice but to
 shift gears or face continued stagnation.
 Also behind the Cuban leader's calculation is a concession
 to reality, unthinkable even five years ago-the tacit admis-
 sion that without access to American trade and technology,
 Cuba may never shake off its backwardness.
 Ever the political tactician, Fidel Castro is gambling that
 his new pragmatism will win recognition in Washington-
 and economic advantages. As an official close to the Cuban
 leader puts it: "We are pragmatic. Without the hostility of
 the U.S., our system would become much more pragmatic."

 The exception to the wave of economic pragmatism now
 sweeping the Communist world is provided by the Soviet
 Union

 .
 nowhere does the need
 for reform seem more urgent. And
 nowhere is there greater potential
 for development if the shackles of
 state control ever are loosened.
 Initiated by Nikita Khrushchev
 in 1957, stopped by Leonid l3rezh-
 nev in 1965, revived by Yuri An-
 dropov in 1983 and cold-shoul-
 dered by Konstantill Chernenko in
 1984, economic reform always has
 had a checkered history in the So-
 viet Union. That record now shows
 every sign of being maintained.
 Today, five industries are experi-
 menting with "reforms" designed
 to give factory managers a freer
 hand to solve problems. During
 1985, several new sectors will be
 included. But what stands out about
 this new initiative is its extreme
 caution rather than its daring.

 Communism "Doesn't Fit a
 Modern Industrial Society"
 Economic failures are just the tip of
 iceberg. A leading authority on Communist
 states says other crises also are defying
 solution by hard-line Marxist leaders.
 ZURICH
 Q Mr. Kux, one Communist state after another is introducing
 free-market reforms. Why is this happening?
 A There are two main reasons. First, the Stalinist model
 f n couunand economy is no longer able to provide the
 ,. ~ , ,nary production and services. Second, Communist
 nannies are losing the competition with capitalist econo-
 From the days of Marx, the main aim of Communism
 h:t, been to supplant capitalism and provide a better eco-
 nonnic system.
 Twenty years ago, Nikita Khrushchev predicted that the
 Soviet Union would overtake the United States. But today
 the economic gap between the two countries is greater
 than ever.
 Q How do you explain this?
 A iV larxism-Leninism just doesn't fit a modern industrial
 -u,a'ty. It has proved incapable of adapting to the scientif-
 chnological revolution of our time. So has the Stalinist
 ,del, with its stress on centralized planning, heavy indus-
 tr% and tight controls over labor. Even Soviet leaders are
 now beginning to recognize this.
 Q Is this obsolescence symptomatic of a wider crisis in the
 Communist system?
 A Of course. It's not only an economic crisis. It's also a
 crisis of ideology, of leadership, of science and culture.
 Communist systems that claim to be crisisproof and there-
 101(' superior to capitalism are now in a systemic crisis
 Lich cannot be solved with the old Marxist recipe. Coln-
 -mists are realizing that neither their Marxist-Leninist
 ,(a nce" nor totalitarian party rule is able to handle the
 Ioe,ent situation and to provide guidance into the future.
 Q What are the implications of this?
 A The main one, in lily opinion, is that the attempt to
 establish a unified socialist economic-and-market system is
 now gone forever. Yugoslavia has it different system from
 the Soviet Union. China has something different from East-
 ern Europe. In fact, there is greater economic diversity
 today in the Communist world than ever before.
 Q What impact is this having on the idea that the Soviet
 economy is some kind of model for the developing world?
 A \V'ell, most developing countries have realized that the
 Soviet Stalinist model can't bring them out of their back-
 waters. So now more and more are turning to the so-called
 capitalist way. This trend seems likely to continue.
 Q And what about the impact on Communist parties? Can
 they maintain a monopoly of political power while decentralizing
 the economies in countries where they rule?
 A Any greater economic flexibility will, of course,
 change the social and political fabric of Conununist coun-
 t rirs The rigid control of Communist parties is bound to be
 Tt'cted. Inevitably, a more pluralistic system will develop.
 We've already seen this in Poland, where the working
 class rose in revolution against the ruling elite and had to be
 crushed by a military takeover-something deemed impos-
 sible according to Marx and Lenin's theories.
 Its precisely because the Kremlin fears such develop-
 ments that it is not introducing similar reforms
 in the Soviet Union.
 Q Is the Communist system itself a barrier to
 change?
 A Yes, very much so. Up to now, every
 reform proposal-in the Soviet Union, in
 Czechoslovakia, in Yugoslavia-has been lim-
 ited by the determination of party leaders not to give up
 control over the management of the economy. As long as
 they keep this up, there will never be real reformns.
 Q Is that the only reason?
 A Not at all. Another thing I want to mention is that the
 Soviets, in particular, had little need to introduce reform
 during the I 960s and 1970s because they got a lot of input
 from Western know-how, credits, trade and grain deliver-
 ies. It wasn't so necessary then to introduce changes.
 Q How are these moves toward free enterprise working out?
 In short, are the economic reforms solving the problems beset-
 ting the Communist world?
 A None of these reforms so far has produced a socialist
 system that works better than the capitalist system in AV'est-
 ern industrial countries. But we must be clear: While the
 Communists have not achieved their purpose, they have
 produced sonic changes.
 For instance, the Ilungarian initiative, though definitely
 overstated, has relaxed the atmosphere in IIungary a little
 and improved productivity. And in Yugoslavia, the self-
 administration system has certainly produced change,
 though it has been more negative than positive.
 Q How about the Chinese reforms?
 A Deng Xiaoping is replacing the rigid Stalinist model
 by a so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics that
 combines central planning with market regulation, move-
 ment on the inside with opening to the outside world. The
 aim is to catch up with the new technical revolution on a
 global scale and to bring China into the forefront of the
 developed industrial societies.
 Q Given China's record of sudden political shifts, do you
 think Deng's policies will outlast him?
 A According to Illy observations in China, a great move-
 ment has begun and reached a point of no return. Deng's
 policy has now broad support-so much so that I don't
 believe any of Deng's successors will be able to go back to
 the old radical Maoist approach. If they tried it now, it
 would produce tensions or even uprisings.
 Deng's reforms are, of course, a great challenge to the
 other Communist countries, the Soviet Union included, and
 may induce them to try similar changes. The outlook for all
 Communist countries is to introduce reforms or to risk
 greater crises and upheavals.                           ^
