 CHNA'S PSYCHC
 SRUAN 'o3
 Is an ancient form
 of energy providing China's children with the
 miracle of second sight?
 BY MARCELLO TRUZZI
 Eleven-year-old Tang Yu and
 his friend Chen Xiaoming were on their way home from school
 in the remote mountain village of Dazhu County when they be-
 gan to wrestle. Tang brushed against Chen's coat pocket, the
 story goes, and had the sudden vision of two Chinese symbols.
 He described the vivid symbols to Chen, who pulled a package
 of Flying Wild Goose cigarettes from his pocket. The label on
 the side of.the package, the boys reported, consisted of the
 two symbols Tang Yu had "seen."
 Tang Yu was reluctant to share his discovery with Tang Kern-
 ing, his fifty-year-old peasant father. He knew his claim would
 sound like a lie. Instead, he began to play guessing games with
 the villagers. He asked them to write random characters on
 pieces of paper, crumple the paper into balls, and let him hold
 each ball in turn next to his ear. Tang then guessed the mes-
 sage within; his guesses, it was said, always proved right. Word
 of the boy spread beyond his small town to all of the Sichuan
 province in central China.
 Soon the region's science commission and its bureau of ed-
 ucation and culture had asked to examine Tang, and research-
 ers there confirmed his ability to identify words and colors on
 small wads of paper held to his ear. News reporters and awe-
 struck officials of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee quickly
 backed those results, and on March 11, 1979, this remarkable
 tale was published in the Sichuan Daily, Thus began what to-
 day is viewed-by both those in China and the West-as either
 a major breakthrough in parapsychology or a remarkable out-
 break of fraud and pathological science.
 Indeed, over the subsequent few months, as news of Tang's
 abilities spread throughout the People's Republic, more than
 ten other psychic children were supposedly discovered in Bei-

 scaled container prepared by us returned it
 with the seal undone.
 As the trip drew to an end, those in our
 group agreed that we had seen no convinc-
 ing evidence of EHF When we confronted
 our Chinese colleagues with these findings,
 they insisted that we were basing our judg-
 ment on mere demonstrations as opposed
 to valid laboratory experiments. Of course,
 children under pressure could cheat some-
 times, they claimed. But that did not mean
 that all children cheated all the time. "Our
 new research aborts the possibility of trick-
 ery." He Chongyan told us. "It concentrates
 on mechanisms and explanations."
 We'replied that until we could replicate
 these experiments in the West. we would
 have to give them low evidential weight.
 Though much has happened since we left
 China. that is still where we stand.
 On February 24, 1982. China's Academy
 of Sciences sponsored a public hearing on
 EHF Reported cases were analyzed, and in
 an extensive review, experts concluded that
 the great majority of them were unfounded.
 The following day. People's Daily summa-
 rized the criticisms and reviewed the past
 several years of reports. It too concluded
 that there was no evidence for the claims.
 Though the attempt to discredit EHF has
 been partially successful, matters remain far
 from resolved. As China's official English-
 language publication, China Reconstructs,
 put it, "The debate goes on. and experimen-
 tation continues regarding what has be-
 come a highly emotional issue."
 Soon after the Chinese Academy of Sci-
 ences issued its decree, for instance, Chen
 Hsin, vice-director of the Institute of Aero-
 space Medico-Engineering, and Mei Lei,
 vice-director of the Space Life-Science
 Commission, attended a joint meeting of the

 Thus far, that has not happened. Accord-
 ing to Paul Dong, author of The Four Major
 Mysteries of Mainland China, the Commu-
 nist party. angered by the constant wran-
 gles, ordered parapsychologists to conduct
 their research quietly They wanted no pa-
 pers, no TV shows, and no more fights.
 Still, the rumors persist. Dong's sources
 say that thousands of psychic children have
 recently come out of the wood,',ork. And
 these newly discovered children, no longer
 content just to read messages with their
 armpits, now congregate in groups, where
 leaders help them use qi to break boards.
 According to a newspaper report from late
 1984, Dr. Lin Hosheng, of Shanghai's Insti-
 tute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, can al-
 legedly use qi energy to move a ball and
 make a man whirl back and forth.
 Whether EHF is real or whether we are wit-
 nessing an extraordinary episode in collec-
 tive error, sociologists of science have much
 to learn from these remarkable events.
 If EHF turns out to be a reality, the obvious
 question will be why it took so long for sci-
 entists to become convinced. One answer
 might come from my colleague Ron Wes-
 trum, a sociologist of science at Eastern
 Michigan University. Westrum has spent
 years studying what he calls hidden events-
 phenomena once denied by orthodox sci-
 ence but today accepted as real. As late as
 the nineteenth century, for instance, scien-
 tists vehemently declared that meteorites
 could not have originated in space. Today
 we know that they do. It is possible that EHF
 falls into a similar category.
 It is, of course, far more likely that EHF will
 be rejected, forcing us to ask why so many
 scientists currently accept it as valid. One
 reason may be that Chinese science is a rel-
 atively closed system, isolated from the rest
 of the world by a language barrier and ide-
 ological pressures. As psychologist Irving
 Janis points out in Victims of Groupthink: The
 Psychological Study of Foreign Policy De-
 cisions and Fiascoes, closed systems and
 strong ties between people tend to produce
 and to maintain conformity. Given China's in-
 sulation from the West, its ancient intellec-
 tual traditions, and its dependence on key
 scientific leaders like Qian, the EHF phe-
 nomenon seems understandable. But as in-
 teraction between China and the West in-
 creases, more critical appraisal may be given
 to the EHF studies now available.
 Most philosophers of science would agree
 that there is no sharp line separating sci-
 ence from pseudoscience. The reality of EHF
 may be highly improbable, but science can-
 not tell us that it is absolutely impossible. As
 Carl Sagan says, the best antidote for pseu-
 doscience is more and better science. Only
 further controlled demonstrations will dem-
 onstrate whether EHF is real or nonsense. If
 EHF is valid after all, the payoff would be
 immense. As professor Dong Taihe, of Zhe-
 jiang University, observes, 'A whole new
 branch of science could just be waiting to
