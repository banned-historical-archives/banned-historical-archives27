 CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
 Office of Current Intelligence
 15 July 1966
 SUBJECT:  Supplement to the Monthly Political Report on
 Communist China for May and June, issued 5 July.
 Developments relating to the Chinese Communist leadership
 since 1July, cut-off date for information in the 5 July Monthly
 Political Report, suggest strongly that the leadership has
 stabili,ze,d at least for the time being.
 Since 1 July, Mao,  in his second appearance since November,,
 received a foreign visitor; Liu Shao-chi is again being repre-
 sented in major party journals as Mao's deputy; the powerful
 party secretariat has been reorganized; a new propaganda chief
 has been appointed; a large proportion of the party's Military
 Affairs Committee showed up; and five officials who dropped
 from sight before or about the time of Peng Chen's fall in
 April are again publicly active.
 These signs could mean that a new unity, however fragile,
 has been forged among the party's top leaders, who may now feel
 they can move to consideration of policy decisions held in
 abeyance for the last few months.
 The,relative standing of Mao and his, four lieutenants has
 been clarified.   Mao is still the dominant figure, Liu Shao-
 chi, though weakened,. remains his deputy, and Teng Hsiao-ping
 emerges in a stronger position.   Teng, believed to be behind
 the attack on Peng Chen, apparently has stopped pushing for
 further gains for the time being.   Defense Minister'Lin Piao's
 role is enhanced, though he remains a shadowy figure, and. Chou
 En-tai, who seems to have. stayed aloof from the fray all along,
 survives.   Nevertheless,  the recent upheaval has surely left
 a i gacy of animosities among top leaders.   The ultimate out-
 come is still murky.and will probably remain so until Mao
 leaves the scene and his successor has a, firm grip on the reins.

 Mao Tse-tung and Liu Shao-chi
 Mao Tse-tung received the Nepalese crown prince about
 8 July probably at a resort in central China.   This was Mao's
 second appearance since 26 November 1965, and first since early
 May when he met an Albanian delegation,
 The Peoples Daily on 1 July published quotes praising Mao
 by Liu Shao-c   , thou En-lai, Lin Piao, and Teng Hsiao-ping--
 in that'order.  Peoples Daily also published in a special box
 on the. fifth page a quotation from Liu, the only leader besides
 Mao who was highlighted in that manner.  On 14 July Liberation
 Army.. Journal gave front page space to a quotation from Liu   zao-
 c ,  urging  he entire party to study Mao's thinking.   The army
 journal's nod to Liu, its first since March, could be an endorse-
 ment of the Mao-Liu lineup at the top.
 The Secretariat
 25X1
 I     25X1
 At the large turnout of high officials at a 9 July meeting
 of Afro-Asian writers were eight members of the secretariat
 (possibly the entire active membership), including two off-icials
 identified for the first time as being on the secretariat.   These
 were Tao Chu, who has replaced Lu Ting-i as propaganda chief,
 and Yeh Chien-ying, a senior military officer who may have
 replaced Chief of Staff. Lo Jui-ching on the secretariat.  No
 replacement for Peng Chen, Teng Hsiao-ping's deputy on the secre-,
 tariat, has yet been indicated.
 The Military Affairs Committee
 All members of the party's Military Affairs Committee who
 normally show up in public were at a banquet held for the Afro-
 Asian writers on 9 May.  These men were Ho Lung, Nieh Jung-then,
 Hsu Hsiang-chien and Yeh Chien-ying.
 Reappearances and Absentees
 Five officials who had been out of sight for months showed
 up after 1 July.   These were Yang Yung, Deputy'Chief of Staff
 and Commander of the Peking Military Region; Nieh Jung-chen,
 a senior military officer; Tseng Shan, Minister of Interior
 (a relatively unimportant post); and two figures in the North-
 west--first secretary of Kansu, Wang Feng; and Chang Ta-chih,
 a Northwest Bureau secretary and Commander of the Lanchou
 Military Region.

 Of the 42 men whose status appeared to be in question on
 1 July, five have reappeared, and one (first secretary of
 Kwangsi) was indicated                         to have been making       25X1
 appearances in June,   Since the leadership appears to be making
 deliberate efforts to show who is running the country now, it
 is possible that the status of most of the 36 men still in
 question will be cleared up fairly soon.       That is, those already
 marked for destruction will be denounced and/or removed, and
 those who have not been in trouble or who have been on trial
 and have managed to clear themselves will reappear.
 Party Center
 None of the key men who seemed on 1 July to be in trouble
 in the party center has shown up, however.   With the fall of
 Peng Chen and Lu Ting-i and the probable dismissal of Lo.Jui-
 ching, the only member of the politburo or secretariat whose
 status still remains in question is Yang Shang-kun, director
 of the secretariat's administrative office.   The directors of
 the Organization (personnel) Department and of the Finance and
 Trade Political Work Department, and first secretary of the
 Young Communist League also are still out of public view.
 Regional Leaders  I
 The status of 13 provincial leaders is still in question.
 Although the first secretaries of Tibet, Fukien and Shansi have
 been out of public view for a. long time, their status is less
 questionable. than that of leaders in Hopeh, Shanghai, Anhwei,
 Liaoning and possibly Kweichow where "black" activities have
 been exposed but not clearly represented as having been cleaned
 The regional leaders who reappeared were in regions
 (Central-South and the Northwest) which were already relatively
 untouched.   This strengthens the hypothesis that there is a
 regional pattern.   Many key officials in the North, East and
 Northeast regions--which may have contained strongholds of
 Peng Chen supporters--still appear to be in trouble
 25X1   The Military
 Three of the 15 military leaders whose status was in
 question on l July have reappeared.   More are expected to show
 up,although military leaders in China do not seem to be as
 obliged as political leaders to make public appearances'to
 prove that they are in good standing.   The three 'who have

 CURRENT SITUATION
 Appr4
 1.    THE MILITARY SITUATION_.IN SOUTH VIETNAM.-
 1.   Early this morning, a US Marine outpost lo-
 cated about 15 miles south of Chu Lai in coastal
 Quang Ngai Province was attacked by an estimated
 75-man Viet Cong force.   A mortar and recoilless
 rifle attack against the outpost was followed by an
 assault resulting in heavy hand-to-hand combat.
 Reinforcements were flown in by helicopter and the
 guerrilla force withdrew after a two-hour battle. A
 total of five Americans were killed and 15 wounded.
 Eighteen Viet Cong were ~i11ed and miscellaneous
 weapons and ammunition were captured from the Commu-
 nists.
 2.   A US Marine patrol, participating in Op-
 eration MACON in Quang Nam Province, located an es-
 timated 300-man enemy force yesterday in an area
 about 20 miles southeast of Da Nang.   Air strikes
 and artillery fire directed on the area resulted
 in 30 Viet Cong killed.   Cumulative friendly casu-
 alties for this operation,   which began on 4 July,
 are eight killed and 35 wounded.   Viet Cong losses
 now total 169 killed and one captured.    Three US
 Marine battalions and one South Vietnamese battal-
 ion are continuing this security and pacification
 operation-;-
 3.   Operation WASHINGTON,   a reconnaissance op-
 eration conducted by one US Marine battalion in an
 area about 30 miles west of Quang Ngai,   ended yes-
 terday.    The operation,   which lasted nine days,
 established only light contact with the Viet Cong
 resulting in 15 Communists killed and four captured.
 There were no American casualties.

 4.   Yesterday three battalions of the US 25th
 Infantry Division began Operation MOKULEIA,  a
 search-and-destroy operation in Tay Ninh, Binh Duong,
 and Hau Nghia provinces.   The operational concept
 involves a series of airmobile and ground assaults,
 employing helilifts, patrols, and ambushes supported
 by artillery, tactical air, and an airmobile reserve/
 reaction force.   Elements of two Viet Cong battal-
 ions with a combined strength of 1,180 men are re-
 ported to be in or near the area of the operation.
 5.   Operation KAHANA II,  initiated in Binh Tuy
 Province yesterday by two battalions of the US 25th
 Infantry Division, will consist of a series of search-
 and-destroy operations to locate and destroy Viet
 Cong forces and tax collection points.   Two Viet Cong
 regiments--the 274th and the 275th--with a total
 strength of 3,850 men are reported in the area of
 the operation.   This operation is a continuation of
 KAHANA I,  which consists of one US battalion rein-
 forced by South Vietnamese Army forces in the vicin-
 ity of Xuan Loc in Long Khanh Province.
 6.   Operation HASTINGS,  formerly a reconnais-
 sance operation being conducted in an area about 25
 miles west of Quang Tri city in northernmost Quang
 Tri Province, has been redesignated a search-and-
 destroy operation.   It was expanded yesterday to
 include three US Marine battalions and five South
 Vietnamese battalions.
 Infiltration Across the DMZ Continues
 7.   A reconnaissance element located about 23
 miles west of Quang Tri city has reported sighting
 six enemy groups, varying in size from 10 to 150
 men infiltrating from the north.   This is in the
 same general area where a captured private from the
 812th NVA Regiment stated he crossed the Ben Hai
 River on 31 May.   There are further indications
 that the entire North Vietnamese 324B Division may
 be operating in the area.   US Marines believe they
 have located three regiments of the 324 "B" Divi-
 sion--the 803rd, the 812th, and the 90th--in north-
 ern Quang Tri Province.

 Other reports, coupled with these current sight-
 ings,  suggest that additional North Vietnamese
 Army forces may be moving across the DMZ into the
 northern I Corps area.
 Infiltration Continues in the Central Highlands
 8. MACV continues to receive reports on in-
 filtration and movement of Viet Cong/North Vietnamese
 Army units along the central infiltration route
 through Pleiku, Darlac, and Phu Bon provinces.
 Three villages were recently burned by Communist
 forces in Pleiku Province near.Route 14 about 15
 miles south of Pleiku town.   Recent observations of
 Communist units in Darlac Province indicate that the
 Viet Cong are attempting to cut Route 14 north and
 south of their infiltration route.
 9.   Several other incidents have occurred in
 this area in what may be an attempt by the Viet Cong
 to keep friendly forces out of the area.   The most
 significant of these was the action in Darlac Prov-
 ince on 8 and 9 July in which a Viet Cong force
 engaged South Vietnamese units participating in op-
 eration THANG LONG 243.   The Communists suffered a
 total of 103 killed in this action.   This encounter
 substantiates other reports of a troop build-up'in an
 area about 30 miles northeast of Ban Me Thuot.
 10.   Possible Communist units in this base area
 include the 18 "B" NVA Regiment, which may have moved
 west after Operation NATHAN HALE was terminated,  the
 49th NVA Regiment previously identified in the Chu
 Pong area, and the 95th NVA Artillery Battalion.   A
 concentration of Communist forces in this area would
 allow the enemy to attack southward into Darlac Prov-
 ince, north toward Cheo Reo and Pleiku Province or
 reinforce units in the coastal plain.

 3.   According to an unconfirmed press report,
 one of the deputy chairmen of the Buddhist Institute
 Thich Phap Tri, told newsmen that Tri Quang will
 continue his fast against the government despite
 an earlier indication from a Catholic spokesman for
 Father Hoang Quynh that the fast would soon end.
 Phap Tri was also quoted, however,  as informing the
 newsmen that Tri Quang would make his first public,,.,
 appearance in more than a month by attending a cock-
 tail party next week at the invitation of Father

 Initial reports/
 have provided
 considerable information about the operations and capa-
 bilities of the DRV Navy.   A good deal of this informa-
 tion concerns weapons and equipment utilized by North
 Vietnamese naval units.   Most of the information on the
 DRV Navy                                                             appear
 to be accurate,
 The boat is said to be equipped with a twin 14.5-mm.
 gun mount aft,  four submachine guns, and smoke pots,
 but carries no depth charges, mines, or sonar.

 2.   The only type of DRV naval craft assigned an
 offensive mission, according to one of the captured of-
 ficers,  is the P-4 - class motor torpedo boat  (iMMT3).   The
 three boats which attempted to attack a US destroyer on
 1 July were of this type.                                                    25X1
 a high-level naval'planning meeting in late
 May 1966 at the torpedo boat squadron forward headquarters on
 Cac Ba Island.        On this occasion it was established that
 in addition to a defensive coastal patrol mission,  the
 MTBs would henceforth actively engage any US ships within
 20 miles of the DRV coast.   The P-4    class  ,'T'B is capable
 of a maximum speed of 52 knots and carries torpedoes
 with a range of 5,000 meters,                                               25X1
 3.                                                information
 that the bloc has not provided the DRV Navy with mis-
 sile or rocket equipment for its boats.
 however,  that the Soviet Union had supplied North Viet-
 nam with 72 torpedoes,  six of which had been expended
 against US destroyers in the Tonkin Gulf incident of
 August 1964.   Six additional torpedoes were lost with
 the PT boats sunk on 1 July in the abortive attack on
 the USS Coontz.                                     the remain-
 ing 60 torpedoes are in a deep u.n.cd`errround storage site
 neat Van Hoa.  I                       the Russians have  "refused"
 to provide the DRV Navy with any additional offensive
 weapons.

 4.   Communist China is reported
 to have given the North Vietnamese four Shanghai-
 class patrol boats--two in late 1965 and two in
 early 1966.     These craft, the largest in the DRV in-
 ventory, were first noted in photography in April
 1966.                                     the Shanghais'
 given to North Vietnam are all-gun versions and,
 contrary to the basic design, have no torpedo capa-
 bility.   North Vietnam is said to be using these
 boats in an air defense role, deploying them in is-
 land waters near Haiphong.   Photography has con-
 firmed the presence of Shanghais near the port of
 Hon Gay. I                               the DRV Navy had
 been promised a total of 12 Shanghais by the Chi-
 nes
 5.   Swatow-class motor gunboats  (PGM)  are also
 assigned an air defense role
 The craft are used to supplement
 shore-based AAA defending the Hon Gay area and per-
 form this mission from fixed rather than mobile po-
 sitions.   Three of the PGMs are assigned to the de-
 fense of an electric power plant which, the source
 claimed, became the sole source of power for the Hon
 Gay area after the US attacks on Uong Bi.
 6.   North Vietnam's SO-1 class subchasers re-
 portedly are used as training ships for DRV naval
 personnel and are recognized as ineffective in a com-
 bat role.                                             the SO-1s,
 like the Shang ais and the  wa Tows, carry anti-
 submarine warfare weapons but that ASW exercises
 have been suspended for lack of a submarine with
 which to train.                               the two ASW
 weapons carried by DRV naval vessels as a 40-kilogram
 "hand submarine bomb" and a 175-kilogram depth charge
 effective to 80 meters.

 V.   COMMUNIST POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
 1.   Hanoi,  in some of the bluntest language
 used in recent months, has restated its determina-
 tion to press on with the war.   An editorial in the
 party daily Nhan Dan   on 14 July, commenting on the
 possibility of negotiations, declared that "so long
 as the US imperialists have not accepted all our
 terms, there can be.-only one course left to us:   to
 fight and fight until the acceptance of these terms."
 This same defiant note was sounded by Ho Chi Minh in
 a 27 June interview granted to a Soviet journal.
 2.   The 14 July editorial also acclaimed the
 "success" scored by Communist forces over the last
 six months in both North and South Vietnam.   Quot-
 ing a 6 July communique of the "Liberation Armed
 Forces"  (Viet Cong), Nhan Dan claimed these "vic-
 tories" have confirmed the-'invincibility of the
 people's war."   The editorial discounted the Ameri-
 can air superiority and asserted that even if the
 US sends 500,000 or 600,000 troops to South Vietnam
 "they will not be able to turn the tide."
