 AIR, GROUND FORCES TEST EACH OTHER IN COMBAT EXERCISES
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 12 Sep 79 p 1
 [Article by staff correspondent Liu Wenzhong [0491 2429 18131 and staff reporter Li
 Sherming [2621 1957 2494]:  "Urumqi Units Organize Air-Ground. Combat Exercise"]
 [Text]  Editor's note: We once reported on a combined arms
 training exercise organized by some units in which all arms of
 the ground forces took part and which solved problems of
 "vehicles, horses, and cannon" on ground that had not been
 encountered before that time.  This time we introduce to
 everybody an exercise in which the Urumqi Units lumped the air
 force and the army together and began to change the state of
 affairs in which the ground and air forces did not encounter
 each other.  This was a further advance in combined arms
 training.
 Training ultimately must pass the test of actual combat.
 To test oneself in the future by bloody means on the
 battlefield is not as good as to test oneself. beforehand now
 by bloody means; to "give the game away" to the enemy in the
 future when one is fighting him. is not as good as to "give
 the game away" to oneself now.  Combined air-ground training
 is a good opportunity for "heaven" and "earth" to test each
 other.  If problems are discovered during peacetime training
 and solved, then if war comes we can reduce our losses.
 The surface involved in combined air-ground training is
 wide, the departments involved in it are many, and the organ-
 ization work for it is comparatively complex.  The first
 meeting between air and ground forces is truly not easy.
 The key to good combined training lies in the command organ-
 ization's "control of heaven" and "control of earth" and in
 the leading cadres being enthusiastic and thinking in long-
 range terms.  In this way, we can frequently find opportun-
 ities for combined training and can obtain ideal results.
 One morning in the last third of August, on a certain training ground in the out-
 skirts of Urumqi, an air-ground combat exercise was being carried out.  First, four

 fighter planes screamed overhead, bombing and strafing in waves targets on the
 ground; the ground forces, making use of undulating hills and defensive works,
 rapidly dispersed and took cover; then two transport planes released 600 parachute
 targets at which all sorts of weapons on the ground opened fierce fire; soon after-
 ward, six helicopters landed on the exercise ground, and several hundred hypotheti-
 cal enemy. soldiers, dressed in white clothing and headgear, rushed out from the
 helicopter cabins and seized a nearby hill.  Soldiers of the rapid anti-airborne
 detachment, coming from six routes, quickly surrounded the hill....  This was a
 demonstration of air-ground combat put on by the Urumqi Units.
 Since mid-year, the Urumqi Units have carried out two of these air-ground combined
 training exercises.  The air force has dispatched several hundred aircraft that
 dropped over 2,400 parachute targets.  Several tens of thousands of army officers
 and men, militia, and army dependents took part in the exercises, which consisted
 of air-raid defense, shooting down aircraft, and attacking parachutists and surround-
 ing and annihilating enemy soldiers landed by aircraft.  Several tens of army and
 air force commanders at regimental level and above took part in the organizational
 command of the combat exercises.
 The air-ground combined training has broadened the horizons of the officers and men.
 The cadres and fighters said happily:  This kind of training together, which allows
 us to see, find, and learn the skills of modern warfare, is a good method.  After
 undergoing the training, they summarized its four advantages.
 It gives the trainees a taste of modern warfare and increases their confidence in
 fighting a modern war.  The past exercises in air-raid defense and anti-airborne
 operations had only consisted of blowing whistles and ringing sirens.  There was
 no basis in the trainees' minds for knowing what, in the final analysis, an air
 raid and airborne operation were like in modern warfare.  This time everybody.
 directly perceived through their senses scenes of aircraft diving, bombing, straf-
 ing, the dropping of parachutes and the landing of airborne forces, so that they
 gained experience, opened their minds, and increased their confidence in using
 existing equipment for air-raid defense and anti-airborne operations.  Learning
 through the personal experience of reality, the officers and men of the army saw in
 aircraft the aspect of their great mobility and speed, but also came to know the
 aspect of their being limited by weather and terrain, and mastered several skills
 in air-raid defense and anti-airborne operations.  The officers and men of the air
 force directly perceived through their senses the ground forces' movements of dis-
 persing, taking cover, and advancing, became familiar with the surface conditions
 of a future war zone and got to know something about how to support the army in a
 future war against aggression.
 It promotes the study of knowledge pertaining to all service arms and improves the
 cadres' organizational command capabilities in coordinated operations.  In the
 combat training, the army and air force mutually pondered methods of dealing with
 each other, and this is something that cannot be done if one doesn't understand
 the knowledge pertaining to other service arms.  Many army and air force commanders
 formed study-help pairs and during breaks in the training exercise requested in-
 struction from each other.  The air force comrades briefed the army on the types,
 combat performance, operational principles, and tactical methods of aircraft; the
 army comrades briefed the air force on the army's weaponry performance and organ-

 ization of fire as well as command sequence.  They went together to the site for
 combined training and surveyed the terrain there, and together. studied the tactics
 and techniques of air raids, airborne operations, air-raid defense, and anti-
 airborne operations.  After the exercise they together talked about what-they had
 learned from the experiences and summed up the experiences and lessons of organiza-
 tional command.  Yang Nanyuan [2799 0589 0337], commander of a certain army regi-
 ment, at first had little understanding of the knowledge pertaining to"the air arm.
 He modestly learned from Fu Wende [0265 2429 17951, deputy commander of an air
 force regiment, and gained a clear understanding of aircraft types and their combat
 performance and tactical methods, and became proficient in the organizational
 command of air-raid defense and anti-airborne operations.  Deputy regimental com-
 mander Fu also many times asked regimental commander Yang to brief him about the
 army's situation and on several occasions took part in ground force exercises con-
 sisting of dispersal and concealment and of defending against air raids and coun-
 tering airborne operations, so that he further understood the ground forces' combat
 movements at any time during a war, and how to organize groups of planes to cover
 the advance of our ground forces, to bomb important enemy targets, and to select
 safe spots for concealment, all of which is beneficial to getting a better grasp
 of the parts of a combat mission in the realm of airborne operations.
 Weak links in training are mutually discovered, and the levels of strategy and
 tactics are jointly raised.  During the exercise, a certain army regiment dis-
 covered that air force planes flying over a mountain area dove too high from the
 ground and did not attack their targets with accuracy, so it immediately made
 suggestions about this to the air force.  The comrades of the air force made a
 special study of measures to deal with this problem, and in the second exercise
 when starting their drives the planes were flying at a suitable attitude and again
 and again hit their targets.  The air force discovered that the green-colored
 camflauge clothing worn by the army soldiers was extremely conspicuous when the
 soldiers were lying prone on the barren Gobi Desert, and immediately brought this
 to the attention of the army.  Comrades of the army repeatedly studied the terrain
 and surface features in the Gobi Desert and Xinjiang and remade the camoflauge
 clothing and nets.  Thus, over a thousand soldiers can now lie prone in the Gobi
 Desert, which is without the slightest cover, and aircraft making many recon-
 naissance flights at low altitudes cannot discover the troops' hidden position.
 Savings are effected in training expenses.  In the past, when the army and the air
 force each organized training, to set up the training grounds and carry out train-
 ing exercises in shooting down aircraft and countering airborne operations cost
 the Xinjiang army units 200,000 to 300,000 yuan every year, and the shooting down
 of balloons cost them several tens of thousands of yuan.  Now that the army and
 air force carry out combined training, both sides have live targets, and it is only
 necessary to make some parachute targets to insure that the units of the whole
 region receive training, thereby effecting big savings in training expenses.
 Recently the Urumqi Units organized comrades and departments concerned who had
 taken part in the graining exercise to discuss informally the question of how to
 train well in air-ground coordination.  The participants felt that the key to good
 training in air-ground coordination was for the leaders to have a great deal of
 resolution and persoanlly grasp this question.  For the field armies and divisions,
 which do not have aircraft, and for the air force, which does not have infantry, if

 one of them thinks of something to do and the other is not enthusiastic, then the
 training will not be good.  In addition, there must be organizational work.  The
 Urumqi Units have set up a training exercise command group, composed of the respon-
 sible comrades concerned in the army and air force, which makes joint studies of
 coordination plans and clearly defines the training exercise mission; which goes
 to the training sites, organizes the carrying out of the exercises, and timely dis-
 covers problems; and which organizes exchange visits between the army and air force
 and timely sums up experiences and lessons.  In order to rationally arrange the
 training exercise content, each session of combined training must solve one or two
 problems and gradually increase the degree of difficulty in the training.  They
 realize that, in handling well the relationship between air-ground combined train-
 ing, they cannot rely solely on combined training and become lax about peacetime
 training in shooting at flying models, shooting at balloons, and shooting at ground
 targets, and must organically combine the two kinds of training.

 SHENYANG AIR REGIMENT IMPROVES TACTICAL TRAINING
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 12 Sep 79 p 2
 [Article by Wu Baoxiang [0124 0202 43821 et al.:  "A Certain Air Regiment Makes New
 Strides in Tactical Training"]
 [Text]  Members of a certain air regiment of the Shenyang Units Air Force have
 emancipated their minds, been bold in practice, and made new strides in tactical
 training.
 This regiment last year completed the most advanced training outline.  In order to
 improve its tactical training, they took three measures:  First, they changed the
 original drill training to comprehensive drill training.  In the original drill
 fighter plane training outline, there had been a total of over 300 exercises, and,
 in order to meet the demands, the pilots, after finishing the flight outline, were
 normally required to review and strengthen 35 exercises.  The content of some of
 these experiences was duplicative and time was wasted.  The regiment, integrating
 practice with experience, made'a study.   It extracted the main content from 35
 exercises and synthesized this content into 4 exercises, both maintaining funda-
 mental techniques and saving time in the tactical training and the study of tactical
 theory for modern warfare.  Second, the regiment broke through the limits prescribed
 by altitude and weather and rationally strung together interrelated parts of the
 training.  After the special skill topics were improved, on one flight there was
 training in both high-altitude and middle-altitude special skills, in both simple
 and complicated special skills, and the time that the aircraft returned to base
 was also used for firing at ground targets.  Thus, the flying weather utilization
 rate was raised and the pilots were tempered in the tactics and techniques of actual
 combat.  Third, the regiment appropriately increased the degree of difficulty in
 the training and narrowed the gap between training and actual combat.  For the
 training in attacking bombers, the regiment, focusing on the characteristics of
 the main types of enemy bombers, viz, high speed and strong regenerative capacity,
 strengthened training in entering the attack position at a wide angle and attacking
 the bombers at high speed.

 BEIJING TANK REGIMENT TRAINS CADRES IN TACTICS
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 12 Sep 79 p 2
 [Article by Wang Guizian [3769 6311 7341] et al.:  "A Certain Tank Regiment Conducts
 Tactical Training Class for New Cadres"]
 [Text]  A certain tank regiment of the Beijing Units recently focused on this pro-
 blem:  most of its company and platoon cadres had been promoted from the positions
 of tank commander, chief gunner, and driver and, although their level of specialized
 techniques was quite high they were comparatively deficient in their capacity for
 organizational command.  Therefore, the regiment started a training class for
 military cadres, political cadres, and technical cadres, stressing the study of
 single-tank attack and defense and a tank company's attack on a defending enemy
 and its own defense.  It also set aside a fixed time for studying military topo-
 graphy and knowledge pertaining to staff work and to tank communications and firing.
 Everybody said happily:  "In the past training we didn't know where to put our
 energy.  The regiment has now conducted this training class for us, so that we
 have learned methods and there is a place to put our energy!"

 [Article by Deng Jinnan [6772 6855 0589] et al.:  "2d Artillery Company Trains
 Fighters in Capacity To Handle Complex Situations"]
 [Text]  The 2d Artillery Company of Unit 32343, starting from the requirements of
 actual combat, has taken effective measures to get a good grip on the tactical
 training of artillerymen, improving their skills in coordinated operations.
 In the past, there was not sufficient attention paid to the tactical training of
 the artillerymen of this company.  They earnestly studied the experience of the
 war of self-defensive counterattack against Vietnam, and deeply felt:  Artillerymen
 must not only be proficient in special. techniques but also be proficient in tactical
 movements, so that on the battlefield they can even better wipe out the enemy and
 preserve themselves.  Therefore, they tightly grasped tactical training, stressing
 the essential tactical movements of individual soldiers, viz, the gunner dropping
 to a prone position, standing up, and moving under enemy fire.  They also paid
 attention in the training to setting up all sorts of enemy situations such as air
 raids, enemy artillery fire blocks, and attacks by atomic and chemical weapons,
 training the gunners' capacity to handle complex situations.  They got a good grip
 on coordinated tactical training of squads and platoons in order to build a good
 foundation for coordinated training of companies.  Moreover, they engaged in exer-
 cises in infantry-artillery coordination, grasped the organizational command by
 commanders at all levels and stressed the improvement of their command of coordin-
 ated operations.  Because the measures were suitable, the tactical level of the
 cadres and fighters rose very quickly.  In one live-ammunition training exercise
 of storming a heavily fortified position in a hilly area, for which infantry were
 attached to the company, the 2d Artillery Company was bold, powerful, and flexible
 in its tactical movements, for which it was commended by the commander at the
 higher level.

 [Article by special staff commentator:  "Straighten Out the Ideological Line,
 Effectively Reform Training"]
 [Text]  The discussion on "how training can meet the demands of modernized warfare"
 launched by JIEFANGJUN BAO has been going on for 10 months, from November of last
 year to the present time, and is about to be brought to a temporary close.  The
 editorial department has asked us to write a brief summary of the discussion.  We
 think that a discussion obviously must be carried out in stages and have a begin-
 ning and end, but, with regard to actual work, the inquiry into this problem is
 just beginning and the solution of this problem is a long-term task.  Therefore,
 we do not now present definitive opinions.  In one sense, by endorsing opinions in
 this discussion, we are extending the discussion of the criterion for truth into
 the realm of military training, so as to truly straighten out the ideological line
 of leaders at all levels, to emancipate their minds, and to reform training.
 Military training needs to be reformed--this is a demand imposed on us by warfare
 under modern conditions and is also the core of the discussion of this problem.  In
 modern warfare, following the developments in science and technology and their
 applications in the military field, there have been very gib changes in weaponry
 and equipment and the mode of operations of the enemy side and our side.  For
 example, modernized strategic weapons of the thermonuclear and space variety as well
 as the newest modern tactical weapons of the conventional variety have appeared,
 and they have led to an unprecedented increase in the surprise and destructiveness,
 the mobility and speed, of warfare; the target of ground operations has changed from
 being primarily infantry to being primarily tanks and armored forces.  The large
 scale of warfare, the breadth of the operational zone, the large number of service
 arms that take part in war, and the swiftness of change in the situation all surpass
 those in our previous experience of war.  These new conditions and new features make
 new demands on our military training.  At the beginning of the 1950's, Comrade Mao
 Zedong emphatically pointed out:  "In order to defend the motherland from the
 aggression of the imperialists, it is not enough to depend on the equipment and
 tactics we used in the past against the domestic.enemies.  We must master the newest
 equipment and the newest tactics that go along with it."   Military training must,
 based on the continually changing new situation, continually be reformed.  This, of
 course is a question of commonsense.  However, for many years Lin Biao and the "gang
 of four" and their ilk, under the pretext of advocating "revolutionization," wrecked
 revolutionization and modernization; advocated "mule-ization" and opposed motoriza-
 tion; and advocated "skill in fighting within 200 meters of the enemy" and opposed

 technological and tactical training under modern conditions.  This caused our army's
 training to stagnate for a long period of time and to focus on old equipment, old
 training content, and old training methods.  After the smashing of the "'gang of
 four" and through criticism of Lin Biao and the "gang of four," order was brought
 out of chaos and our army's military training made marked progress.  But this pro-
 gress, to a great degree, is still in the nature of a recovery.  Strictly speaking,
 the training is still not on the right track.
 Since the beginning of last year, the discussion on a national scale concerning the
 question of the criterion for truth has evoked a great response on all fronts, in-
 cluding the military front.  Applying the number one viewpoint, practice, people are
 thinking deeply about a severe problem:  Can we now allow this state of affairs in
 our army's training to continue? Can the training content, methods, and systems
 followed for many years pass the test of modern warfare?  Must military training be
 reformed, and how can it be reformed so as to step up combat readiness and fit in
 with actual combat?  Voices urging that the training be reformed have become even
 stronger after the war of self-defensive counterattack against Vietnam.  And it is
 precisely under'these conditions that the great number of officers and men devote a
 great deal of attention to the discussion of "how training can. meet the requirements
 of modern warfare."  Many units, drawing on the experience of the war of self-defen-
 sive counterattack against Vietnam, basing themselves on existing equipment and
 keeping in mind a future war, have boldly carried out some reforms in training, and
 some of them have already garnered some preliminary experiences.  This is extremely
 valuable.  However, we must also. see that this is only a beginning.  The major pro-
 blem at present is that minds have not been emancipated and that the training reform
 has not been set in motion.  There are many reasons; some are questions of material
 conditions, some of experience, some of the spiritual state of mind, but the main
 reason is that, in thought, the state of ossification or semi-ossification has not
 been thoroughly broken away from.  Some comrades are still habituated to get all
 their mental sustenance from "books" and make outdated experience and formulations
 their standards; some comrades are content with training in bayonet charges, hand
 grenade throwing, and in the experience of a single service arm, and do not study
 the new conditions and new problems of modern warfare; some leaders do not themselves
 grasp reform and also do not support other people making reform, and even pour cold
 water on the masses' enthusiasm.  The abovementioned variety of reasons fully demon-
 strate that the key to whether one dares to reform training is whether one's mind
 has been emancipated.  If the mind is not emancipated then training reform cannot
 take a single step and does not have the slightest hope.  A correct ideological line
 is determined on the basis of a correct political line and also on the basis of a
 correct military line.  Only by integrating military training with reality,
 straightening out the ideological line, and greatly emancipating the mind can train-
 ing reform make considerable progress.
 In emancipating the mind and reforming training, we must first of all liberate
 people from the spiritual state of going by the "book" in everything, and correctly
 handle Mao Zedong's military thought.  Comrade Mao Zedong, in leading the Chinese
 people in armed struggle over a long period of time, summed up his rich experiences
 in war, and Mao Zedong's military thought is the compass guiding the study of our
 army's strategy and tactics and the carrying out of its military training.  We can
 never be shaken on this point.  The problem is that, under the influence of the
 leftist line of Lin Biao and the "gang of four" for over 10 years, the "every sen-
 tence is true" and "every sentence must be complied with" became tight chains

 fettering people's minds and there existed a state of ossification in the realm of
 military training, as if after the great teacher of the revolution had made the
 leap from practice to theory, knowledge had stopped and we did not need to use our
 brains again.  Therefore,. reciting from memory and citing words and phrases were
 substituted for the study, probing into, and solution of actual problems; certain
 regulations, teaching materials, and manuals became loaded with the "quotations"
 and they cited principles, and new conditions and new problems were dismissed; and
 training in tactics and technology was oversimplified and imitative.  If we now
 continue to be under the influence of this way of thinking--whatever was written
 in the "books" without exception cannot be changed and whatever was not written
 without exception cannot be spoken of, cannot be done and even cannot be thought
 about--then what training reform can be discussed?  We must make clear:  First, the
 universal principles of Mao Zedong's military thought are only a compass guiding our
 study of problem and definitely should not and cannot be readymade answers for the
 solution of all sorts of actual problems; Comrade Mao Zedong did not and could not
 solve all concrete problems brought about by developmental changes.  This means that
 we can only, in line with the application of the standpoint, viewpoint, and methods
 of Comrade Mao Zedong's study of warfare, boldly inquire into and solve problems
 by using the scientific attitude.  Second, although Comrade Mao Zedong put forward
 many correct methods for the solution of many problems, he did this at a fixed time
 and place and under fixed conditions.  If we do not inquire about changes in con-
 ditions and make his'military thought a never-changing dogma that is indiscrimin-
 ately copied and used without any exception whatsoever, then we will inevitable
 suffer a setback in practice.  Since Mao Zedong's military thought is the crystal-
 lization of nonproletarian military science, we must adopt the scientific attitude
 in dealing with it.  Mao Zedong's military thought is a product of the practice of
 the revolutionary masses in their millions, and can and must be developed through
 the revolutionary practice of the masses.  The kind of attitude that makes Mao
 Zedong's military thought a panacea for all ills, or a religious creed about which
 we dare not express the slightest reservation, is antiscientific and, of course,
 runs counter to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.   Only by continuing to break
 the spiritual shackles forged by Lin Biao and the "gang of four" can we truly, with
 Mao Zedong's military thought as our compass, in the vast world of training study
 new conditions, solve new problems, "start the machinery," move about freely and
 quickly, and continually score achievements in training reform.
 In emancipating the mind and reforming training, we must extricate ourselves from
 the negative feeling that "with the existing equipment there is nothing to be
 attempted and nothing to be accomplished."  Comrade Zhu De, in "Battlefields in the
 Liberated Areas," said:  "Our view on using military forces can be summarized as
 follows:  fight with what ever guns we have, fight whatever enemy we face, fight in
 whatever time or place we have to."  What he said about weapons, the enemy's situ-
 ation, time, and place is the standpoint for using military forces in war and is
 also our standpoint for reforming training.  Proceeding from the reality of the
 enemy and ourselves, the study of using existing equipment to fight a modern war is
 the general topic of our training reform.  In the over 30-week discussion of "how
 training can meet the demands of modernized warfare," many of the questions raised
 and many of the opinions expressed have centered on this general topic.   Some com-
 rades worry:  Can we, with the existing inferior equipment, defeat an enemy who has
 superior equipment?  With the existing weapons can we train in the skills of modern
 war?  We think that a conscientious look back at the history of our army's armed

 struggle over several decades and a review of the guidance of-the great teacher
 of the revolution when he said that the decisive factor for victory or defeat in
 war is man not weapons, and a careful analysis of our existing military level with
 regard to the suitability of weaponry and equipment,. should give us the correct
 answer.  When we speak of fighting a modern war with an enemy, we are certainly
 not solely indicating a test of strength between modernized weapons, but are indi-
 cating that people's subjective activity will be brought into full play to find
 methods of using inferior equipment to defeat an enemy with superior equipment.
 One should see that when we say our weaponry and equipment are backward, we are
 comparing them with those of the principal enemy, and this definitely does not mean
 our army's existing equipment is completely backward without a single redeeming
 feature.  That would not jibe with reality.  In fact, our army has now been developed
 into a combined arms force with atomic bombs and guided missiles.  It must also be
 .recognized that the existing equipment is not being used so as to bring out its
 greatest efficacy.  The current problem is not completely that the same equipment
 is comparatively obsolete and backward, but in many aspects people's level is not
 suitable for the existing equipment.  Only if we'reform training well, accelerate
 the raising of people's tactical and technological levels, fully display the might
 of existing equipment, apply the strategy and tactics of people's war, make the most
 of our strengths and attack the enemy's weaknesses, can we have full confidence in
 obtaining victory in a future war against aggression.
 In emancipating the mind and reforming training, we must enthusiastically support
 new things that. emerge during the reform and correctly deal with problems encounter-
 ed on our advance.  Some comrades worry that mistakes will be made in the reform,
 disorder will be created, and things will be done poorly.  Full misgivings, they
 wait for "readymade food" and ignore the creative spirit of the masses in the re-
 form.  Obviously, this attitude is incorrect.  Training reform is a new problem
 for which we lack wide experience.  We urge the masses to be bold in practice and
 courageously blaze new trails.  In the process of the reform, the emergence of this
 or that mistake, setback, or failure is nothing to make a big fuss about.  What is
 so terrible about making a mistake?  Sum up experiences and try it again!  Naturally,
 by saying not to be afraid of setbacks we are not advocating disorder, by advocating
 boldness in practice we are not encouraging foolhardiness.  Revolutionary zeal and
 scientific attitude must be combined.  For some major reforms there must first be
 a "scientific experiment" at one point, and after passing through the test of
 practice, it will be decided whether to accept or reject the reform, and if it is
 accepted it will spread over a whole area from one point.
 Emancipating the mind and reforming training demands that we strengthen study.  No
 reform can depart from science, and if there is no real ability and learning the
 so-called emancipation of the mind very possibly will lead to wild flights of
 fancy.  It is unimaginable that a person who knows nothing about military theory,
 who is utterly ignorant of the reality of military operations and training, and also
 is afraid of using his brains and is unwilling to learn, can have much real know-
 ledge and deep insight with regard to reforming training.   The present situation is
 that there are really a considerable number of comrades who have little talent and
 less learning and whose ability to shoulder responsibilities is weak.  Only by
 rapidly changing this state of affairs can there truly be results in training re-
 form.  We hope that every comrade, especially the leading comrades, will conscien-
 tiously think:  In the final analysis, how much do I understand about the military

 theory of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought?  In the final analysis how much have
 I studied the characteristics and laws of modern warfare?  In the final analysis,
 how well do I comprehend the practice of troop training?  The circumstances in which
 the modernization of the armed forces is going ahead at full speed compel us to
 think and learn, and the prospect of a future war forces us to think and learn.   Our
 jobs cannot give us wisdom.  Only by arduous study, learning from books, from
 reality, from the masses and also from the enemy can we obtain the right to speak
 about and the right to lead the training reform, and can we guide the masses, be
 bold in practice, and continually push forward the training reform.

 COMMUNICATIONS PLAY VITAL ROLE IN MODERN WARFARE
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 17 Sep 79 p 2
 [Article compiled by. Tong Xinchu [4547 0207 2806] and Hong Xin [3163 0207]:  "On
 What Does a Massive Army Rely on To Stay in Contact--Compilation of Statements at
 an Experience-Exchange Meeting of Signalmen Who Had Taken Part in the War"]
 [Text]  Fighting a. War Depends on Command, Command Depends on Communications
 Deputy political commisar Yang Jian'an [2799 1696 1344] of a certain artillery
 regiment:  Having gone through this war of self-defensive counterattack against
 Vietnam, the commanders of our regiment personally experienced the status and effect
 of maintaining contact and combining forces.  Signal communications are the nerve
 system of the armed forces and the basic measure for insuring operational command.
 If the hub of this nerve system is paralyzed, then half of the armed forces' body
 will be paralyzed, and how could a war be fought!  In this war we put communications
 work in its proper place and strengthen concrete leadership over this work.  There-
 fore, under the conditions in which command posts at all levels were shifted over
 30 times, we were able to maintain smooth communications and this played an impor-
 tant role in our being victorious in battle.
 Communications section chief Zhang Guoxin [1728 0948 0207]: A unit must be dispersed
 and also drawn together, and the commander must get a tight grip on communications.
 A certain regiment of our unit received the mission of using its deep-thrust force
 to tear open a hole in the enemy line.  The regiment, spread .out over a 5-kilometer
 front, by the use of concealed communications methods was united into one body.
 The soldiers swiftly and violently engaged the enemy and rapidly stormed and cap-
 tured the enemy's main forward position.  After completely annihilating the enemy,
 at one command they immediately drew together.  What was the main reason that the
 soldiers dispersed so swiftly and drew together so well in this.battle?  Regimental
 command Zhang Zhi'an [1728 1807 1344] gave this answer:  "Fighting a war depends on
 command, and command depends on communications.  If communications are effective,
 troops can be combined to win a victory; if communications are not effective, then
 even with the best resolution, things cannot be carried out."
 Communications subsection chief Liu Zhize [0491 1807 3419]:  Precisely because
 communications are important, the commanders of combined arms forces pay the ful-
 lest attention to communications work.  Zhang Wanman [1728 8001 1628], the comman-
 der of our division, made signal communications an important duty.of his own self
 and of commanders at all levels in the division in organizational and operational
 command.  Before battle, he suggested that communications section chiefs be invited

 to take part in the party committee meeting so that they would understand the intent
 and plan for the operation, listen to the report from the communications departments,
 examine and revise the plan for insuring operational communications, and check up
 on the implementation of preparatory work.  He also, with the communications per-
 sonnel, devised 28 radio signals for the hidden command of the deep-thrust forces,
 and personally mastered the methods of using them.  On 9 March, taking advantage of
 our withdrawal, the enemy attempted to cross the (Qi Qiong) River and wait for a
 chance to make a surprise attack on Hill 390, which was being held by one of our
 companies.  Division commander Zhang immediately saw through the enemy's plot, and
 before the attack ordered the regimental chief of staff to see that a telephone line
 was connected to Hill 390 and also put in an additional walkie-talkie.  When the
 sounds of battle began, division commander Zhang kept watch beside the telephone
 and directed the company in the battle.  In a 1-day fierce battle, 177 enemy sol-
 diers were wiped out.  In the violent attack on (Zhi Ma), the capture of (Lu Ping),
 the storming and capture of (Mi Mai Shan), and the attack on the pursuing enemy--in
 all these battles, the signal communications were swift, accurate, secure, and un-
 interrupted so that in the four battles the division was victorious.
 Communications section chief Zhu Shilin [2612 0099 2651]:  From this war we see
 that a few commanders still have an inadequate understanding of the importance of
 signal communications and still do not correctly use communications instruments.
 Some are accustomed to bugles, barners, and signal flares and cannot use modern
 communications methods; some care only about getting their messages through and do
 not observe security measures so that they reveal their units'. line of march and
 its operational intent; and some only grasp the "wired" and not the "wireless,"
 thinking that wired telephones are safe and radios are dangerous, so that they
 think of the wireless but fear to use it.  A commander of a certain regiment
 followed the forces that made a deep thrust into the heart of the enemy's area, and
 when closing with the enemy he maintained radio silence in order to conceal his
 intent.  But when fire began to be exchanged, the divisional command radio station
 tried to call him and the commander, who had previously answered according.to pre-
 scribed procedures, would not answer, so that the upper level for as long as 8
 hours did not know the situation of the deep-thrust force and had no way to cor-
 rectly command it.
 Technology Equals Highly Effective Liaison
 "Heroic communications platoon" leader Chen Zhenye [7115 6966 0673]:  Courage is
 the ideological basis for completing a mission, and technology is the material
 insurance for completing a mission.   By the addition of technology, a unit's
 combat effectiveness can be brought out.  The large number of heroic signalmen
 that emerged during this war were both brave, fearless fighters and technically
 proficient crack troops, and they made a great contribution to battle victories.
 "Heroic signalman" Yang Chunhua [2799 2504 5478], wounded in five places on his
 body and with his uniform stained red with blood, still skillfully operated his
 machine and maintained uninterrupted contact from beginning to end.   "Model
 handle-talkie operator" Chang Chaomiao [1603 6389 3267], with three bullets in his
 body, staunchly kept on working for 2.5 hours, guiding artillery fire that destroyed
 eight enemy firing points in succession.  After he had sacrificed his life, his
 hand still touched his tranceiver and his right hand tightly held its microphone
 next to his mouth.   Our platoon was in the battle that surrounded and annihilated

 the enemy at (Shuo Jiang), and to'be able to satisfactorily complete its mission
 it relied on combining courage with technique.  Even if at that time our casual-
 ties were fairly heavy, no sooner had one comrade in the platoon fallen than another
 stepped into the breach without fear of the ultimate sacrifice.  The eight walkie-
 talkies kept working from first to last without stopping, and while on foot the
 signalmen transmitted over 300 battle orders..  Practice in battle clearly shows that
 there is no question of.the courage of the great number of our signalmen, and with
 the addition of technology they can surmount every difficulty and guarantee unim-
 peded communication.
 Communications section chief Wang.[character illegible] [3769      ]:  War is the
 best test of the peacetime technological level of us communications personnel.  If
 our peacetime technology is meticulous, then in wartime we can be proficient.  This
 war once again proves that if there is strict training before a war and one becomes
 skilled in the techniques of one's profession, then in war, no matter how complica-
 ted the situation, one can be equal to the occasion and insure good communications.
 With regard to our unit, the technological backbone contingent that took part in
 the war fully displayed its technological might in battle.   The great majority of
 the comrades rendered meritorious service in the war.  Many antijamming experts,
 rapid receiver-dispatchers, and other technological aces distinguished themselves
 in battle and did not let any difficulties, no matter how big, deter them.  Radio
 operator Cheng Guanyan [4453 6034 3508] in peacetime was a model soldier in rapidly
 linking up communications.   In one battle, after he had received the order to turn
 on his radio, he was responsible for 7 communications targets and in only 8 minutes
 he had linked up with all of them.  Many handie-talkie operators memorized by heart
 the encrypting code and worked side by side with the commanders, rapidly encrypting
 and transmitting their messages, reporting to higher levels and transmitting to
 lower levels, and immediately sending battle orders.  However, there were also mis-
 takes in copying and receiving messages, e.g., changing "storm and capture" to
 "defend tenaciously," which caused the troops to suffer unnecessary casualties.
 This shows that in modern warfare if there is no specialized technological contin-
 gent that has been well trained in peacetime, then it will be impossible to com-
 pletely fulfill the signal communications mission.
 "Heroic telephone exchange squad" leader Zhang Yan [1728 1484]:  By combining cour-
 age with technology, the role of existing equipment can be brought into full play
 and the effectiveness of signal communications can be continually heightened.  On
 2 March, at a critical moment in the attack on the distirct town of (Sha Ba), the
 oscillator on the generator of our telephone exchange suddenly broke down and there
 was no replacement.  Deputy squad leader Ji Li [0679 5461] suddenly hit upon a way
 out of this predicament.   Together with telephone operator Long Qun [7893 5028],
 she quickly replaced the telephone exchange's generator with a simple generator
 and in only 25 seconds restored the telephone exchange to normal working order.
 Throughout the entire battle, every member of our squad applied the 18 skills
 learned in peacetime, displaying enthusiasm and initiative so that one person did
 the work of several.   The squad opened 11 telephone centers, set up 31.5 kilometers
 of telephone line, with 155 telephone users, and connected 14,666 calls without any
 errors, thereby insuring the operational command.  After the war the squad received
 a collective citation, first class, for meritorious service.

 Adapting to Three-Dimensional Warfare, Coordinating Communications Well
 Communications section chief Su Diancheng [5685 3013 2052]:  This war was a realistic
 test for insuring the coordination of communications between infantry, artillery,
 tank, and all service arms during joint operations.  In general, the coordination
 of communications between infantry and tanks revealed quite a number of problems.
 During the battle in which (Fu He) was attacked, because communications were not
 coordinated close enough the communications medium was fragile.  After the coordin-
 ating transmitter-receiver was destroyed, the commander could not direct his tanks.
 The communications subsection chief could only use semaphore signals, but these
 did not make contact with the tanks..  The tanks did not know our infantry's position
 and the infantry did not recognize their own tanks, with the result that accidental
 casualties were caused to our side.  Infantry-artillery communications were coordin-
 ated fairly well.  When our unit was attacking (Kou Ma Shan), the natural defense
 barrier to Lang Son, communications between the infantry and artillery were coordin-
 ated smoothly, thereby insuring that artillery fire crept forward progressively,
 paving the way for the infantry assault, and the infantry successfully stormed and
 captured (Kou Ma Shan).  During the battle in which the (Tong Deng) and Lang Son
 area was attacked, several hundred large-caliber artillery pieces organized four
 25-minute barrages at over 100 targets.  In every barrage, all artillery pieces, on
 command, started and stopped firing in unison.  The infantrymen universally reported
 that the artillery fire did whatever was asked of it, coming when called and being
 accurate and fierce.  It was if the artillery shells had "eyes."
 Communications subsection chief Li Zhenren [2621 2182 0088]:  In this war, the air
 force did not directly coordinate its operations with the ground forces, but, with
 regard to the organizational preparation for air-ground coordinated communications,
 there are still many problems.  Some of the prescribed methods of distinguishing
 air and ground forces are basically awkward methods of coordination devised in the
 1930's and 1940's for propeller aircraft.  Owing to the effects of terrain and
 weather, there is no way of insuring that the air and ground forces distinguish each
 other and of calling in attack planes to hit targets for us, so that there is a
 great possibility of accidental casualties occuring in wartime.  Modern warfare
 is three-dimensional, and it requires cohesion and liaison.   One of its aspects is
 that a combined arms commander must be an expert in commanding joint operations by
 all. service arms, and at the same time must have advanced methods of communication
 so as to insure close coordination between the service arms.  Thinking of the pre-
 sent fight against the "wolf" to the future fight against the "bear," we must in-
 tensify the development of advanced electronics communications equipment for the
 purpose of coordination, and also as rapidly as possible rationally work out the
 establishment and system of the equipment used by signalmen for coordination.  In
 the unit's education and training from now on, we must strengthen the study and
 practice drills in coordinating communications between the service arms, especially
 between infantry and tanks and between ground and air forces, and rapidly improve
 their capacity to insure coordinated communications.
 Have Movement in Mind, Base Oneself on Change
 Communications section chief Sun Zhengqian [1327 2973 0578]:  In modern warfare,
 the situation on the battlefield is ever-changing and the fighting between us and
 the enemy is Intricate and complex.  Only by keeping in mind movement and basing

 oneself on change can one be prepared for any eventuality and insure uninterrupted
 signal communications.  For the mobile battle mission to which we were assigned
 this.time, the direction and area of operation were not fixed and we fought wher-
 ever we were required to fight.  The operations were very fluid and we frequently
 fought in one place after another.  How were we to adapt signal communications to
 these features of movement and change?  Our main methods were:
 1.  We formulated preliminary plans and made early preparations.  After being ordered
 to take part in the war, we immediately convened a meeting of subsection and unit
 chiefs at which the directives from the higher-level commanders and the communica-
 tions departments were relayed, the mission was clarified, and all sorts of pre-
 liminary plans were made to insure communications, so that the communications de-
 partments at all levels could make early preparations, gain time, and seize the
 initiative.
 2.  Focusing on characteristics, we made full preparation.  From the time we entered
 the assembly area until we went into battle, based on the commander's operational
 plan, we envisaged all sorts of complicated situations.  For example, how to insure
 communications for a large unit that makes a long-distance deep.thrust that splits
 the enemy; how to organize liaison with a small unit that moves by many routes; how
 to handle the situation when a road is too narrow, or has been destroyed by the
 enemy, so that communications vehicles cannot use it; and how to take remedial
 measures when the communications personnel have been made casualties or their equip-
 ment has been destroyed, etc.  We repeatedly analyzed and studied all these pro-
 blems and came up with the corresponding measures to solve them.  Thus, careful
 thought before battle led to good communications during battle.  After the troops
 went into battle, no matter how the situation changed and how complicated the envir-
 onment became, signal communications were maintained uninterrupted from beginning
 to end.
 3.  We gave priority to radio communications and put many hands to work on prepara-
 tions for it.  The communications methods we employed, in alternation, were wired,
 wireless, and courier-relay.  During a battle, if wired communication couldn't get
 through, wireless communication was used; if the radio transmitter-receiver couldn't
 get through, courier-relay communication was used; if direct means of communication
 couldn't get through indirect means were used.
 Communications section chief Li Kewan [2621 0344 2429]:  Having movement in mind and
 basing oneself on change demands that our communications departments and communica-
 tions personnel display their subjective activity; be tireless in running around
 and in using their eyes, mouths, and minds; immediately grasp situations; and
 improve'their capacity to meet all sorts of emergencies.  To meet this demand, it
 is very important:  to take the initiative to inform the commander about signal
 communications and, immediately upon obtaining the commander's instructions; to
 regularly go to the operations room to keep abreast of the progress of the battle
 in order to immediately. take measures and continually check up on the organization
 of signal communications; and to make sure that the higher and lower levels keep in
 touch and exchange reports on the situation.  If the communications departments in
 good time grasp the developments and changes in the process of a battle, then signal
 communications will be able to adapt to change without confusion and to movement
 without being disrupted.

 [Article:  "Arm the Minds of Commanders With Advanced Military Theory--Comrade Xu
 Xiangqian's Answers to Questions Put by the Editorial Department of MILITARY SCIENCE"]
 [Text]  Editor's note:  Military theory, which has its origin
 in practice and which also plays a guiding role in the practice
 of warfare, is a powerful weapon in studying warfare and its
 guiding laws.  In order to improve the quality of education and
 training so as to vanquish the enemy in a future war, and to
 make solid, steady progress in the modernization of the armed
 forces, we must not for a single moment separate ourselves from
 the scientific guidance of military theory.  In particular, under
 the conditions in which the object of our military operations has
 changed and in which the enemy's weaponry and equipment are
 superior to ours, we must as swiftly as possible study and train
 in a set of tactics that will enable an inferior force to defeat
 a superior force.  The study of military theory is thus even more
 urgent, even more important.  This conversation between Comrade
 Xu Xiangqian [minister of national defense] and the editorial
 department of MILITARY SCIENCE is rich in content and earnest.
 Its fundamental spirit is that we must make a painstaking effort
 to master military theory and to arm our minds with advanced
 military theory.  The completion of this study task is a matter
 of great urgency, but it cannot be done overnight and it requires
 painstaking effort.  At the beginning of the new year, our cadres,
 especially those at the upper and middle levels, should have this
 aspiration:  raise their own military level a notch so as to meet
 the requirements of modern warfare.
 We Must See the Importance of Military Theory
 Question:  First, please tell us:  What is the major significance of research work
 in military science with regard to the modernization of national defense?
 Answer:    This question must be discussed theoretically, but it is not good to
 discuss it in general terms.   There are no more than three aspects to modernization
 of the armed forces:  first is weaponry and equipment, and this is the material

 foundation; second is the people who skillfully master modernized weaponry, equip-
 ment, and operational methods, particularly the cadres; and third is the integra-
 tion of people with weapons, and for this there must be a scientific military
 establishment and system.  The people I am talking about here are a very important
 condition for realizing the modernization of the armed forces.  Sun Zi said, "The
 general who understands war is the minister of the people's fate" in reference to
 the importance of the commander.  Only if the commander understands the character-
 istics, strategy and tactics of modern warfare will he be able to better develop
 the role of the other two aspects and form a powerful fighting force.
 Research in military science is the work of studying the laws of warfare and of
 inquiring into military theory.  Engels said:  "The revolution will use modern
 military measures and modern military science to fight modern military measures and
 modern military science."  To modernize national defense, we must not only develop
 advanced military science and improve our weaponry and equipment, but also make a
 great effort to  study modern military science.  These two aspects complement each
 other.  We cannot just see the importance of weaponry and equipment and not see the
 importance of military theory.  If we master and apply advanced military theory,
 even if our weaponry and equipment are inferior we can vanquish an enemy who has
 superior weaponry and equipment.  Without the correct guidance of military theory,
 in wartime battles will be fought in a messy fashion and in peacetime the quality
 of the troops' education and training will not improve, the development of weaponry
 and equipment will be sidetracked, and a powerful fighting force will not be built.
 Our armed forces are good armed forces with a glorious history and a wealth of
 combat experience.  This must be affirmed.  However, it will not do to just brag
 about the past, and it is insufficient to rely only on the experience of fighting
 past wars.  Once weapons change, tactics inevitably change.  There is a great dif-
 ference in the tactics of the bow and.arrow, sword and spear "cold weapons" era and
 the tactics of the rifle and machinegun era.  And there was also a big change.in the
 tactics of World War II as compared to those of World War I.  It will not do to
 use old things to deal with new things.   The army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom
 won many victories over the Qing dynasty army, but it was defeated when it encoun-
 tered the "foreign gun corps.".  At the beginning of World War II, the Soviet Union
 had the worst of it from Hitler's blitzkrieg.  How will World War III be fought?
 How can Soviet aggression be dealt with?   It can be affirmed that thenewill be many
 new characteristics and new problems.  In war under modern conditions, equipment
 is complex, logistics are complex, and command is very complex.  This requires that
 we engage in painstaking study. Our armed forces had been at war for 22 years in
 the past, and during the.war periods, although a few military schools were run, a
 little training was done, and some strategies and tactics were taught, this was
 quite inadequate.  Therefore, generally speaking, the level of our commanders'
 military theory was not high. After the founding of the state, many military
 schools were run, and with great success, but then there were two big setbacks:  one
 was the setback caused by opposition to standardization, and the other was the set-
 back caused by opposition to "dogmatism."  The harm to our army's modernization done
 by Lin Biao and the "gang of four" was even greater.  We now must meet the situation
 head'on and catch up, i.e., we must grasp the study and learning of military theory
 and arm our commanders' minds with military theory.

 Military Science Must Study the Enemy and Ourselves
 Question:  What is the focal point of the research work in military science?
 Answer:  There are many questions that military science must study.  To put it
 briefly, it is the study of the enemy and ourselves.  We must penetratingly study
 the principal object of a future war.  How will the enemy fight?  In the air he has
 a large number of aircraft, and on the ground he has thousands of tanks and armored
 vehicles as well as powerful artillery and guided missile forces.  He also has a
 navy that can dome from the sea, and he can even use thermonuclear weapons.  How
 should we fight this kind of enemy?  Sun Zi said:  "Know the enemy and know your-
 self; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril."  How can you fight if you
 don't know the enemy's situation?  When we fought against Chiang Kai-shek, we were
 very clear about his situation and he was not clear about our situation, so that we
 held the initiative.  The study of the principal object of a future war must not
 just be of his military aspect; his political and economic aspects must both be
 studied.  Militarily, we must study his establishment and equipment, strategy and
 tactics, and command characteristics; must study the past war. experiences, history of
 war, specific examples of battle, and all sorts of organized maneuvers; and also
 must study the articles in publications.  From all of this we can see his military
 thought, can see how he prepares for war.  We must study how others control their
 military forces and how they conduct training.  As much as possible we should spread
 widely military data on the Soviet Union and other countries, and we must not seal
 ourselves off.
 We must also make a very good study of ourselves.  In studying our army's past
 experience, the main thing is to study the experience of how, with inferior equip-
 ment, we vanquished an enemy with superior equipment, and, based on the new situa-
 tion, develop the experience further and seek ways to deal with the enemy.  Compar-
 ing modern warfare with past warfare, no matter what the object of the war or the
 scale of the war, there will be many methods of war we have never encountered.   If
 we use old standards to deal with and guide modern warfare, then we will run into
 big snags and suffer a lot.  During World War II, some countries stayed in a rut,
 remained in the World War I period, and made serious mistakes in directing the war.
 We should learn a lesson from this.  In studying past experiences, we cannot remain
 at the level of principles.  For example, "Know the enemy and know yourself; in a
 hundred battles you will never be in peril" is a fundamental principle, but it will
 not do to only understand this fundamental principle.  Under specific conditions,
 the application of principles are different.  We certainly must learn, based on the
 situation, to flexibly use principles, develop principles, and originate new
 principles.
 Military History Is a Science
 Question:  Many countries are now paying a great deal of attention to the study of
 military history.  How should we understand the importance of studying military
 history?
 Answer:  The study of military history is very important.  I have said in the past
 that our military academies must teach the history of wars, including the history
 of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign wars.  Military history is a science.

 Studying military history means to study the laws of warfare from the practice of
 past wars. "History is a mirror."  By mastering military history, we can better
 draw on the war experiences of the ancients and the contemporaries.  In studying
 a future war against aggression, we can seek some laws from the history of past wars,
 especially the history of World War II.   Our war of resistance against Japan was a
 protracted war in three stages:  defense, stalemate, and counterattack.  In the
 Soviet-German war, there were also for the Soviet Union the stages of defense (or
 withdrawal), stalemate, and counterattack, but the period of stalemate was not as
 long as ours.  What kind of war will be our future one against aggression?  In my
 view, to counter, with inferior equipment, an enmey with superior equipment, we
 must still fight a people's war, must still, adopting a strategic policy of active
 defense, fight a protracted war.  Many books are now being published that relate
 to the study of World War II:  Zukhov's "Memoirs and Reflections," Vasilevskiy's
 "A Graduate's Cause," and Shtmenko's "Soviet General Staff at War."  America,
 England, and Japan also have many books. on the study of World War II.  It is very
 essential for our commanders to read some of these books.  And in particular they
 must read books concerning the Soviet-German battlefield problems during World War
 II.
 Having fought wars for so many years, we have rich experience.  We should learn from
 and study well Comrade Mao Zedong's military writings, which generalyzed our exper-
 ience to a high degree.  However, this is not enough.  There are many concrete
 experiences that have not been well and systematically summed up.  Our period of
 guerrilla war was the largest and its scale the largest, and we should say that its
 experience was the richest.  Comrades in foreign countries once wanted experience
 in this aspect, and we certainly will not take out systematic ?chings.  Besides
 Comrade Mao Zedong's military writings, there are many military treatises written
 by comrades of the older generation.   For example, there are many military writings
 by Comrade Liu Bocheng, a famous strategist and military theorist.  These people all
 reflect our army's experiences, and there are very incisive and original passages
 in their writings that are our army's precious wealth and that we should compile,
 study, and learn from.
 Cadres Must Read Many Military Treatises
 Question:   Please tell us:  what basic conditions and basic knowledge should a
 competent commander possess?
 Answer:  Some comrades say that economic work cannot be pushed forward unless
 attention is paid to fostering talented persons.  In my view, military work also
 cannot be pushed forward unless attention is paid to fostering talented persons.
 At present the level of military theory of many cadres in our army, their level of
 organizational command and management, as well as their level of scientific educa-
 tion, still cannot meet the demands of modern warfare.  This is a very big problem
 that must he solved.  Besides possessing the necessary political qualifications, a
 competent commander must certainly study in a painstaking fashion modern military
 theory, and he must possess a fixed amount of knowledge about military history and
 a fixed amount of knowledge about science and technology.   The basic method of train-
 ing cadres is to let them study.  It is important to run schools well and to provide
 good rotational training.  At the same time, we must pay attention to people develop-
 ing themselves by self-study.  Soldiers must be trained, trained, trained; cadres
 must read more books.  We must begin by enriching the knowledge of the fighters and

 the low-level cadres.  They are the basic level, and all cadres will proceed
 from the basic level.  On this basis, their gradual pursuit of advanced studies
 will be made easy.  Generally speaking, cadres at the regimental level and above
 should have comparatively rich knowledge about military affairs and other things.
 To illustrate with examples, in Chinese history there are many military treatises:
 "Sun Zi's Art of War:  is world famous; "Wu Zi ["The Art of War of Wu Qi"], "The
 Art of War of Sima Rangjiu," "The Six Arts of War," "The Three Strategies," "The
 Dialogue Between Dukes Li and Wei," etc.  Many celebrated battles should also be
 studied.  At present, the knowledge of this aspect on the part of some of our cadres
 is too small, and it is possible that some of them cannot name some of the dynasties
 in Chinese history.  Since ancient times, China has produced some military figures,
 as have foreign countries.  Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Suvorov all had some special
 traits which the cadres should know about.  If a military commander is too lacking
 in historical knowledge, he will be severely handicapped.  It was said in ancient
 times:  "Only if one is wise can one be full of strategems" and "A general who
 does not know about both ancient and modern times will be foolhardy."  These propo-
 sitions are certainly true.
 We must pay full attention to fostering middle-aged and young cadres.  Many of the
 articles in foreign military publications that I have seen were written by field-
 grade officers.  In the future, wars will mainly be fought by our middle-aged and
 young comrades, and our state and armed forces place their hopes on them.  They
 must be.cherished and encouraged.  The middle-aged and young cadres must understand
 their own responsibilities and know how valuable time is.  In my understanding, the
 time when the thirst for knowledge is the keenest is the age between the early 20's
 up to 30.  People in this age group want to read, read quickly, and have a strong
 memory; those who are older have some deficiencies in this respect.  Therefore, they
 must make the best use of this time to study.  Many of our middle-aged and young
 cadres are outstanding and use their brains a lot; it is only that their experience
 is somewhat insufficient.  Running well military publications is a very important
 measure for fostering and improving the cadres.
 Question:  What instructions do you have for running military publications well?
 Answer:  In running publications, their object must be considered Cadres of our armed
 forces are divided into initial level., middle level, and higher level.  Are not
 publications required to divide their work according to cadre levels?  How are they
 to be divided?  This is worthy of study.  I feel that we want military publications
 suitable to be read by lower-level cadres, and they should mainly be devoted to
 tactics, command, military history, and technology.  The educational level of
 fighters in companies is now much higher than it was in the past, and we should
 publish more reading materials that are suitable for these fighters to read, i.e.,
 military, political, natural science, reading materials, etc, and we can compile
 some more booklets.  The militia should also have military publications, principally
 devoted to military knowledge.  I think that to disseminate military knowledge
 throughout the army and country is a very important problem.   This must always be
 done, and if it is not done today then it must be done tomorrow, if it is not done
 now then it must be done in the future.
 These views of mine are very superficial, and what I have said is provided for
 your reference and for discussion by everybody.

 PROBATIONARY PARTY MEMBERS MUST BE GIVEN TIMELY CONSIDERATION
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 31 Dec 80 p 3
 [Article by the Party Work Office of the General Political Organization Department:
 "The Question of Probationary Party Members Becoming Full Party Members Should Be
 Timely Discussed"]
 [Text]  Comrade editor:
 The party constitution situpulates:  "When the probationary period of a probationary
 party member has expired, the party branch should timely discuss whether he is to
 become a full party member.  If he is qualified for full party membership, he should
 become'a full party member on schedule; if further investigation is required, his
 probationary period. can be extended."  However, in the party organizations of some
 units, the branch does not timely discuss whether probationary party members whose
 probationary period has expired are to become full party members, and the party com-
 mittee does not timely give an official written reply to its subordinate body, so
 that the process is slowed and the probationary period for party members is covertly
 extended.  We think party organizations at all levels ought to handle this matter
 strictly according to the party constitution and timely discuss the question of pro-
 bationary party members becoming full party members.
 Zhang Yifei [1728 0001 7378], Political Department, Unit 37002
 Comrade Zhang Yifei:
 JIEFANGJUN BAO has passed your letter on to us.  At the same time, we have also
 received some letters of similar nature, reporting that in some units the party
 organizations cannot discuss the question of probationary party members becoming
 full members.  We think this question should draw the serious attention of party
 organizations at all levels and that. they should redress this situation.
 According to the reports, there are many reasons for the inability to timely discuss
 the question or probationary party members becoming full members.  In some units,
 there is insufficient attention paid to the matter and it is not tightly grasped; in
 some units because a probationary party member is still not qualified to be a full,
 member, the party organization cannot stick to principle, and it fears that a formal
 announcement of an extension of the probationary period would make the work diffi-

 cult; and other units, in order to prevent the probationary party members among the
 fighters from not keeping their minds on active service, use the method of putting
 off the discussion so as to "block" them, or on the pretext of making more "tests"
 take another "look" so that they do not become full members on schedule, etc.
 We think these ways of doing things are incorrect.   The party constitution stipulates:
 "The probationary period of a party is 1 year" and "When the probationary period of
 a probationary party members has expired, the party branch should timely discuss
 whether he can become a full member."  Before a probationary party members enters
 the party, he is investigated and educated by the party organization.  After enter-
 ing the party, he passes through a 1-year probationary period of investigation and
 finding out about him.  If his motive in entering the party, his ideological char-
 acter, his degree of awareness, his organizational discipline, and his fulfillment
 of his duties as a party member are all comparatively clear, then the party branch
 should, based on what it has investigated and found out about him, discuss whether
 he has the qualifications to become a full member, and decide either to promote
 him to full member on schedule or to extend his probationary period or to cancel his
 qualifications as a probationary party member, and moreover to report the decision
 to the higher-level party committee for its approval.
 The timely discussion of the question of a probationary party member becoming a full
 member is an important content in the work of developing the party, and is also an
 expression of responsibility toward the comrades and a responsibility of the party
 organizations.  When a comrade becomes a probationary party member, the party
 organization's work of receiving the party member is not finished, and it must con-
 tinue to investigate and educate him, helping him to become a qualified full member
 and discussing the question of his being promoted to full member.  This is precisely
 the summation of this investigation and education.  To timely promote to full
 members qualified probationary party members, adding new strength to the party
 ranks, is also an encouragement for these people; with regard to a probationary
 party member who is temporarily not qualified to be a full member and whose proba-
 tionary period is extended, to point out his currently existing shortcomings and in
 what direction he should make efforts in the future is a responsibility toward the
 comrade; to cancel the qualifications of probationary party members who are truly
 not qualified to be full members, thus preventing some persons from entering the
 party whose motive is.not pure and who will not play the role of party members is
 the responsibility of the party organizations.  To handle probationary party members
 by the method of delaying the discussion of their becoming full members so as to
 11b.lock" them is not a correct attitude.  This is because it not only does not achieve
 the goal of education, but also could easily cause the probationary party members to
 be at a loss what to do, and even produce improper ideological problems.  We cer-
 tainly must handle this matter according to the provisions of the party constitution,
 and not only must the basic-level party branches timely discuss it, but also the
 higher level party committees must timely examine and approve the decision regard-
 ing the question of probationary party members becoming full members.
 Obviously, when we speak of "timely" we definitely are not saying that it must be
 done overnight and that we must not delay the process under ordinary conditions.
 If the probationary period of some probationary party members has expired, but
 some problems are discovered that need to be examined or are awaiting clarification
 by discussion at party branch meetings on probationary party members becoming full
 members, then a delay of the discussion is necessary and permissible, but this should

 be explained to all members of the party branch and to the persons concerned.
 Similarily, if the probationary period for a probationary party member has not
 expired, for a party organization to handle the procedures for making him a full
 member in advance of this expiration is also incorrect.

 MEDIC DOES GOOD WORK IN BORDER DEFENSE UNIT
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 31 Dec 80 p 2
 [Article by Chen Deng [7115 67721 et al.:  "He Is an Ordinary Medical Orderly"]
 [Text]  "He is a university graduate who has done quite well in border defense."
 This is how the cadres and fighters of a certain medical unit of the border defense
 forces have praised medical orderly Zhang Xiangguang [1728 4382 0342].
 In January 19-9, Zhang Xiangguang graduated from Guilin Medical School.   Just when
 he was waiting for an assignment from the state, the guns of the war of self-de-
 fensive counterattack against Vietnam sounded, and he was assigned as a medical
 orderly in a certain regiment of the border defense forces.  Like the silent burning
 of a piece of shiny black coal, from that time on he only hoped to give his "heat"
 to the people and he never pursued the glamor of an individual.  The medical unit
 and a commune hospital had the joint use of an X-ray machine, but there was no one
 to operate it.  On his own initiative, he took charge of the fluoroscopy work for
 patients.   From then on, it was unnecessary for patients to go to the county seat,
 over 60 li away, for fluorscopy.  In March of this year, in order to display Zhang
 Xiangguang's technical skill, the leadership transfered him to outpatient service
 work.  In the unit, the doctors every day took shifts in turn according to regula-
 tions, but, in ordinary circumstances, Zhang Xiangguang almost never left his post.
 In one period of time, he was the only person left in the outpatient treatment room.
 Every day he would diagnose and treat patients on more than 50 occasions, but he
 still zealously and conscientiously received patients and was not careless.  In
 order to let other comrades see motion pictures, he frequently on his own initiative
 took their shifts.  Observing his selfless work, people urged him to take a rest.
 But he said, "Everywhere there are border defense fighters.  What does this amount
 toI"
