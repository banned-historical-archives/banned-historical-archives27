 1. The Current Political Situation
 in the People's Republic of China
 Peking in recent months has devoted primary attention to putting its domestic
 house  in  order,  a  precondition  for  Carrying  out  its  Stated  ,foal  of  building a
 modernized China by the end of the Century. Repeated calls for unity and stability
 suggest that China's leaders are trying to put behind them the personal and political
 animosities that have plagued the leadership for the past nine years and have slowed
 economic  development.  Political     instability  over the    last several years  has
 contributed to an erosion of public confidence in China's leaders.                       25X1
 Major party and government meetings held last January emphasized the unity:
 theme and, more importantly, laid the groundwork for a relatively orderly
 succession to the current wing leadership. China's current leaders are essentially
 the same group that has ruled the country since the Communists came to power
 in 1949. As none of these people can be expected to survive for more than .10
 years, a priority need is the grooming of younger leaders who are capable of
 directing China's economic development program for the next 25 years.
 The succession question took on greater urgency last summer with the
 hospitalization of Premier Chou En-tai who is generally regarded as the architect
 of China's current domestic and foreign policies and the leader of the moderate
 coalition in the party. Chou remains in a rest home but seems still to be in overall
 control of affairs of state. The supervision of day-to-day affairs, which was Chou's
 primary task for more than 20 years, has now been turned over to 70-year-old
 Teng Hsiao-ping. At the meetings in January, Teng was named first deputy premier
 and is Chou's apparent successor.
 Teng seems to be in general agreement with Chou En-lai's policies and is not
 expected to make any major changes if and when he becomes premier. Teng has
 a well-earned reputation as a strict disciplinarian and an able and experienced
 administrator.  At the  meetings in  January, Teng was named to top positions in
 the party and the national military hierarchy, thereby giving him Important posts
 in China's three major bureaucracies -- the party, government, and military.
 At his age, however, 'Deng is an interim succcss.or at best. Behind him are
 several competent officials in their 40s, 50s, and GOs who were also given important
 jobs last January. The State. Council that was appointed in January consists
 primarily of these and other officials of moderate persuasion. Several are known
 proteges of Chou.

 The extreme left wing of the party, which is headed by Mao's wife, Chiang
 Chill-, was  all but excluded from the new goverlllllellt and has lost illfluellce in
 party affairs as well. The powcr.of the military, which was the dominant political
 force until a few years ago, has also been sharply reduced. Civilians have been
 named to several top military posts, and many of the most influential Military
 men in the provinces were transferred away frbm their power bases and sent to
 new areas where they have been denied top party and government positions.I
 As Peking builds toward the future, the position of China's top leader, Mao
 Tse-tung, has cone increasingly into question. Mao has been out of Peking since
 last summer, his longest absence from the capital since coming to power. Recently
 he has stopped meeting foreign visitors, and there are signs that Chinese officials.
 are beginning to take a critical view of many of Mao's former policies. Some people
 seem to hold Mao responsible for the political instability of recent years. Although
 Mao is on record as endorsing the unity and stability theme, his physical separation
 from the rest of China's leaders. raises questions about his actual view of current
 developments. Mao is kept fully informed of all major developments, but the
 Chairman's prolonged absence from the capital suggests that he may not fully
 endorse some recent decisions.

 11, The Chinese Economy
 Premier Chou En-lai in his government work report to the National Peoples
 Congress last January surveyed the mixed performance of the economy in 1974
 and suggested that the leadership expects economic growth to .be gradual for some
 time. Although  Chou  provided  few statistics op either planning or performance,
 we believe that the Chinese economy grew in 1974 by only 3`%%, -- down from
 almost 10 % in 1973. Growth in industry slowed to 4i%, froin a respectable 12%
 in 1973, and agricultural output barely matched the increase. in population
 (about 2%).
 Among the factors holding back industrial growth in 1974 were:
 e the persistence of imbalances among the extractive, processing, and
 finishing industries, highlighted by shortages of coal;
 sporadic  work  stoppages,  lowered  worker  morale,  and  reduced
 productivity created by the anti-Confucius campaign; and
 e the overburdening of the transportatiori system, particularly the railroads.
 The sharpest decline occurred in steel output, which fell by 6% in 1974 to
 about 24  million  tons. On the positive side, the petroleum industry continued its
 strong growth, with a 20% increase in crude output to the 65 million ton level
 during the year, while the production of electric power, tractors, -chemical fibers,
 and cement also showed increases.
 Agricultural  growth  during  1974  was  adversely affected by  generally
 unfavorable weather for winter wheat and for fall-harvested grains. Grain output
 exceeded the 1973 level of 250 million tons, rising to about 255 million tons.
 Nevertheless, grain production in 1974 was clearly less than the authorities hoped
 for. Imports of grain, which were 7 million tons in 1974, will continue, with 5.4.
 million tons already slated for delivery in 1975.
 In foreign trade, total exports rose last year, with the rapid expansion of
 earnings, from oil exports more than offsetting the impact of shrinking world
 markets for traditional Chinese exports. Imports grew even faster as worldwide
 inflation pushed up China's import costs. China's. hard currency trade deficit
 increased from the 1973 level of S370 million to perhaps S I.3 billion in 1974,
 in part from heavier use of medium-term credits to finance whole plant imports.

 Chou reaffirmed the development priorities of agriculture, light industry, and
 heavy industry which have prevailed since late 1972 and reiterated Chinese interest
 in expansion of trade relations with the non-Communist wVorld. The reduction of
 economic ministries and commissions - from 40 to 25 and from 12 to 3,
 respectively -, announced at the NPC. and Chou's statement that the PRC: is drawing
 up a ten-year plan in addition to five-year and annual plans suggest that the degree
 of centralized planning and management of the economy is to increase.
 C11ou also singled out the period of the Fifth hive-Year Plan (1976-80) as
 crucial to PRC attainment of economic "front rank" status in the world by the
 end of the century. The basic problem remains that of lifting the long-term rate
 of grain production above the rate of population growth. Solution of this problem
 through expanding industrial inputs to agriculture   including inputs of foreign
 tecluloloay - is clearly implied in Chou's speech. In suns. Chou En-lai appears
 to have charted a course of carefully planned but slow growth for the economy
 over the next 15 %-cars. The leadership is in transition and.. Riven the PRC's past
 experience with radical turns in economic policy, the present moderate approach
 may be difficult to maintain.

 III. China's Foreign Trade in 1974-75
 Highlights in 1974
 China's foreign trade boom fell victim in 19.74 to the growing problems of
 the world economy. Total trade increased by about 25%, to roughly S 1 2.5 billion,
 well below the 67'% increase in 1973. Most of the increase is attributable to higher
 prices, with little or no growth in volume. Worldwide inflation pushed up China's
 import bill while the economic slowdown in the West cut demand for Chinese
 exports, resulting in the largest. trade deficit in China's history - perhaps S I.3
 billion with the non-Communist world, and despite a surplus with the Communist
 world, about S 1 billion overall.
 Despite these difficulties, China's balance of payments is not in crisis. Resenves
 are well in excess of the trade deficit, the level of foreign debt is manageable,
 and Peking's credit rating is excellent.
 China began taking steps to relieve the financial squeeze last fall. Contracts
 for agricultural products were deferred or canceled. Fertilizer deliveries were
 postponed. Peking also increased its use of short- and medium-term credits.
 Trading Partners
 Trade with the non-Communist countries posted the largest gains, accounting
 for almost 85'/c, of China's total trade. Imports from the developed .West shot up
 to slightly above S5 billion from S3.4 billion in 1973, largely due to increased
 purchases of agricultural products and machinery. China's deficit with the developed
 countries was roughly S2.9 billion.
 Sino-Japanese trade jumped 50%, to S3.3 billion. China's imports, boosted
 by sizable deliveries of machinery and equipment, exceeded exports by more than
 $800 million. China's exports of 4 million tons of crude oil worth about S380
 million  more than offset the decline in its traditional exports to Japan.
 US-China trade totaled $935 million, a smaller increase than anticipated at
 mid-year because China canceled contracts for US grain worth about $300 million.
 Wheat, corn, cotton, soybeans, and other agricultural products composed about
 80;0 of total US exports of S820 million (see the table). US machinery and
 equipment exports rose as delivery began on equipment for the ammonia plants
 purchased in  1 973 and the second half of  the S150 million Boeing contract was

 completed. Growing purchases of cotton textiles helped boost
 US
 imports
 of
 Chinese goods to Si 15 million, up from S64 million in 1973.
 US-China trade encountered several problems last year. Chinese complaints
 over the quality of US grain caused delays in wheat shipments and the cancellation
 of soybean contracts. US controls on scrap steel exports prevented delivery on
 several contracts. On the import side, shipments of Chinese shrimp were rejected
 by the Food and Drug Administration, and the Chinese at the Fall Canton Fair
 were more vocal about the lack of most-favored-nation status for their exports.
 Commodity Flows
 Purchases of agricultural products, machinery, and transport equipment were
 largely responsible for the growth of China's total imports. China contracted for

 almost  10 million tons of cram in  1974. but shipping delays and contract
 cancellations  dropped actual deliveries to 7  million toils, down from 7.7 million
 in 1973. I ligher grain prices. however, pushed the cost up to over S i billion.
 Imports of soyhcan~" and cotton were up substantially from 1973. Machinery and
 equipment imports rose sharply as large-scale deliveries began on the 52.5 billion
 worth of whole plants and other equipment ordered in 1973.
 Peking signed contracts for S900 million worth of whole plants in 1974 --
 down fro.in the record S l."_' billion level in 1973. Rapid inflation and tight world
 credit markets. plus Chinas need for a breathing spell to absorb the large amount
 of technology already purchased. were the major reasons for the slowdown in
 purchases. Contracts worth S550 million for the Wu-han steel rolling complex
 composed much of the purchases, with the balance going. for additional synthetic
 fiber, fertilizer, and electric power plants. In contrast to the whole-plant program,
 new orders for machinery and transport equipment in 1974 ww.-ere off sharply from
 the record level of 1973.
 China's exports rose by roughly Si billion in 1974: petroleum accounted for
 almost half of the increase. Sales of crude oil and petroleum products. to Japan,
 the Philippines. Hong Kong. and Thailand amounted to about 4.5 million tons
 worth S440 million. Rice exports benefited from high prices, but other traditional
 Chinese exports, particularly silk and cotton textiles, faced declining demand.
 Outlook for 1975
 China's trade this year will be tempered by Peking's attempts to reduce its
 trade deficit. Export growth will be small, reflecting poor sales of traditional
 products at the 1974 Canton fairs and recession-weakened demand in the West.
 An expected doubling of petroleum exports may do little more than offset the
 decline in other exports.
 Imports of machinery and equipment will be substantial as large-scale deliveries
 continue on 1973 and 1974 contracts. The successful 1974 harvest and declining
 textile exports \\ ll permit cutbacks in grain and cotton imports. Other, less essential
 imports will be curtailed and the pace of new plant contracts may slow further.
 The S700 million surplus enjoyed by the United States in its trade with China
 in 1974 will be cut sharply in 1975. US exports to the PRC could fall to one-third
 last years level, while US imports will continue to rise. China's current low interest
 in US agricultural products stems from an adequate domestic crop last year, a
 determination to ease a tight foreign exchange situation, and dissatisfaction with

 Approved For Release 2005/07/20 : CIA-RDP80MO1389R000400070001-7
 the quality of US wheat, corn, and soybeans. Peking canceled contracts for almost
 1.0 million tons of US wheat in early 1975, thereby eliminating the United States
 as a supplier at least for the time heitig. As for cotton, contracts called for delivery
 in 1975 of 500.000 bales worth about $100 million. Chinese interest in US cotton
 has diminished, however; one contract for 200,000 bales has already been canceled
 and additional cancellations may occur.
 In contrast to farm products, US industrial exports should continue to rise
 in 1975. Although new orders for US machinery totaled only S15 million in 1974,
 deliveries under 1973 contracts -- notably equipment for the eight Kellogg ammonia
 plants - will peak in 1975. With export controls off, US sales of steel scrap could
 rebound to the 1973 level or higher. Gains are likely for such US manufactured
 goods as paper, aluminum, fertilizer, and other chemicals.
 The steady rise in US imports of Chinese goods is likely to continue - from
 $115 million in 1974 to S125-S150 million in 1975. Chinese interest in the US
 market is growing at a moderate pace. Dramatic changes in products or marketing
 arrangements are not to be expected this year.

 IV. The PRC Petroleum Situation
 Fifteen years ago, the People's Republic of China relied on the USSR for
 more than half of the oil it consumed. Today,. China is the world's 13th. largest
 oil producer and has emerged as a potentially large oil exporter. This paper briefly
 reviews the development of China's petroleum industry and the recent gyrowth of
 its oil exports and assesses the prospects for future exports.
 Energy Supply Position
 The. PRC produced an estimated 460 million tons (SF E basis)* of primary
 energy in 1974. In the late 1950s, China relied on coal for 95;% of its primary;
 energy. Since then the primary energy mix has undergone considerable change.
 As shown below, the role of coal has declined, while both oil and natural gas
 have risen in importance.

 Currently energy supplies are tight: coal production has not kept up with
 demand. Although the rapid growth of petroleum production gives Peking the
 option of substituting oil for coal, the government has taken only limited steps
 in this direction, at least partly because of China's Mtge reserves of coal. More
 important, Peking appears to believe that increasing oil supplies are better used
 to expand the petrochemical industry and to earn much-needed foreign exchange.
 Crude Oil Output, Reserves, and Exploration
 . China achieved self-sufficiency in crude. oil production in the mid-1960s and
 in 1974 was the world's 13th largest producer, behind Indonesia. Crude oil output
 grew at a rate of 22% per year during 1965-74 and reached 65 million tons (1.3
 million barrels per day) in 1974 (see the table).

 There are no authoritative estimates of oil reserves in the PRC. Proved reserves
 are thought to bL at least I billion tons. Considering that large areas have not
 been surveyed, potential reserves probably are much larger. The main thrust of
 the Chinese exploration and development effort is still on land.
 Offshore exploration has only recently begun and has been concentrated in
 the shallow Po Ilai Gulf. The Po IIai deposits, which are adjacent to and probably
 part of the oil basin underlying the important onshore Ta-kang and Sheng-li fields,
 should be n to produce significant quantities of oil in the next few years. Activity
 in the deeper water of the Yellow. East China, and South China seas has been
 limited to geological surve}'s and preliminary drilling. During the last year, however,
 China has purchased about Si 50 million worth of rim and supply ships for offshore
 exploration. Aside from the development of the Po 1Iai, which should proceed

 Approved For Release 2005/07/20 : CIA-RDP80M01389R000400070001-7
 apace, other offshore exploration and development will be deliberate.. PRC activity
 here appears to be based more on t]ie fear that foreign rivals will stake out prior
 claims on the continental shelf;, rather than on a need for additional oil.
 Oil Refining and Transportation
 The PRC has given high priority to refinery construction since the mid-] 960s.
 Current refinery capacity is probably in excess of 50 million tons, and additional
 capacity is under construction. The progress in construction and the absence of
 Chinese interest in importing refinery equipment suggests that China is able to
 construct sufficient refining capacity for its own needs.
 Transportation facilities have been pressed to keel) pace with the growth of
 crude oil production. Until recently most of China's oil was carried by rail. Now,
 tankers and newly constructed pipelines are carrying rapidly growing quantities
 of oil.
 Almost half of the domestic tanker fleet, which now totals about 600,000
 DWT, has been acquired or built since 1971. About one-fifth of the crude produced
 is moved in domestic tankers (all smaller than 50,000 DWT), mainly. from Dairen,
 Tsingtao, and Chin-huang-tao, to refineries in Shanghai and Nanking.
 In 1974, the PRC completed two major pipelines, running from the Ta-ch.'ing
 field in Manchuria to new oil-loading facilities at the port of Ch'in-huang-tao and
 from the Sheng-li field in Shantung Province to the port of Tsingtao. These pipelines
 are mainly to facilitate the export of oil, which previously moved to port by railroad
 tank cars.
 Petroleum Consumption
 Consumption of petroleum products by sector cannot be estimated with any
 precision, but it is clear that the sharply increased supply of petroleum is causing
 important changes in almost every sector of the economy. The increased use of
 petroleum in transportation and industry has characterized China's economic growth
 in recent years. The agricultural sector and the infant petrochemical industry
 particularly have benefited from plentiful oil. The leadership maintains strict control
 over the allocation of petroleum. Supplies are channeled to priority users, and
 recurrent campaigns are mounted for the conservation of petroleum.

 Petroleum Exports: 1974 and 1975
 Peking began to export crude oil in 1973 with the sale of I million tons
 of crude oil (20,000 b/d) to Japan. Prior to this, exports had been limited to
 small quantities of petroleum products for political allies such as Albania. North
 Korea,  and  North  Vietnam.  Four million tons?(80,000 b/d) Of crude Oil. worth
 about S400 million, were sold to Japan in 1974.` Another 250,000 tons of crude
 were to be shipped to the Philippines in the final quarter of 1974. China also
 exported small quantities of petroleum products to Ilong Kong (200.000 tons)
 and Thailand (50,000 tons). Crude oil exports to Japan this year should reach
 8 million tons (160,000 b/d), worth about 5700 million. The Philippines may
 receive 750,000 tons of crude oil in 1975. Hong Kong and Thailand will continue
 to receive small quantities of products.
 Crude oil is a welcome addition to China's exports. Large imports of wheat-
 and an aggressive program of whole-plant purchases, beginning in 1972, have forced
 Peking to seek new means of financing its trade. In the next few years, exports
 of petroleum will provide. more than S 1 billion in hard currency annually, thus
 contributing measurably to China's ability to pay for its rapidly expanding imports.
 Political Uses of Oil Exports
 The agreements to ship diesel fuel to Thailand and to sell crude oil to the
 Philippines are part of PRC attempts to normalize relations with these states.
 Prospects of expanded shipments of crude oil to Japan were apparently used as
 leverage in the negotiations for the Sino-Japanese civil aviation agreement concluded
 in April 1974. Soon afterwards, Pekin- told the Japanese that they were ready
 to expand oil exports up to 10 million tons (2-00,000 b/d) in 1974 and to
 50 million tons (1 million b/d) in 1980. Subsequently, several Japanese delegations
 have been to Pekin- to discuss a lonb term oil agreement. The offer also appears
 to have been used to counter Soviet influence in Japan. China in effect offered
 the Japanese twice as much oil as they would have received from the Tyumen
 project (25 million tons a year).
 Prospects for Oil Exports
 A goal of 50 million tons of crude oil for export in 1980 appears feasible.
 Reserves are large enough. If production continues to grow at 22% - the rate
 achieved during 1965-74 - the PRC could export 50 million tons in 1980 and
 *   l'RC oil imports are nominal. Some crude is imported from Albania and the Middle Last, and special
 products are imported from several other countries.

 still (lave ample supplies of oil for mochernizijw the economy. Presumably most,
 or all, of any crude oil exports would go to Japan. If an agreement with Japan
 is eventually concluded, the export of 50 million tons of oil in 1980 would provide
 Japan with 1    of its projected consumption and, at current prices, would earn
 China more than S4 billion.
 if the PRC encounters unexpected clifficulties in achieving the output of crude
 oil necessary to meet increased domestic and export requirements. it conceivably
 might Change its attitude toward foreign participation in the development of its
 petroleum industry. China presently rejects joint ventures, direct foreign investment,
 and product sharing. Nevertheless, other arrangements cannot be ruled out.
 Exploitation of the deeper waters off the Chinese coast is likely to require foreign,
 and particularly US, technology.
