 FOR BACKGROUND USE ONLY
 Principal Developments in World Communist Affairs
 (22 March to 18 April 1968)
 1.  Czechoslovakia
 a.  Exit Novotny.  The liberalizing trend in Czechoslovakia became
 noticeable late in 1967 and led to the ouster of Antonin Novotny as Party
 First Secretary on 5 January 1968.  Now more of the Stalinist "Old Guard"
 have been removed from their positions of power.  Novotny was obliged by
 public pressure to resign his remaining -- and largely ceremonial -- post
 of President on 21 March and was replaced on 30 March by 72-year old Gen-
 eral Ludvik Svoboda, who had already received some pointedly favorable pub-
 licity in the Soviet press.
 b.  The Action Program.   The Central Committee of the Czechoslovakian
 Communist Party held a Plenum which lasted a week (29 March-5 April).  The
 Plenum approved the much discussed "Action Program."  Though replete with
 typical Communist propaganda scoring imperialism, praising the Soviet Union,
 pledging support for North Vietnam, etc., it contains many promises of re-
 forms which, by totalitarian standards at least, are liberal.  These in-
 clude pledges of greater freedom of speech and press, and promises for the
 rehabilitation of both Communist and non-Communist victims of past political
 purges.  It also outlines economic and managerial reforms designed to mod-
 ernize the Czech economy which has fallen sadly behind Western European
 levels during the 20 years of Communist rule.  Significantly, the Action
 Program proclaims a two-Germanies policy, saying that "realistic forces" in
 West Germany (presumably meaning the Social Democrats) deserve Czech support.
 c. Public comment in Czechoslovakia on the Action Program was not
 universally favorable.  Some hard-liners criticized it, and so did some
 liberals who were disappointed that it did not go much further.  The most
 distinguished among the liberal critics was Professor Ivan Svitak, a lead-
 ing intellectual and former professor at the Institute of Philosophy, who
 said in a lecture, excerpts of which were published on 10 April in the
 newspaper STUDENT:   "The peculiarity of the current change is that no changes
 have occurred; the mechanism of total dictatorship remains intact."  Pro-
 fessor Svitak commented that the Action Program contains no provision for
 true opposition parties.   (It does make the statement that parties allied
 with the Communists in the National Front should be strengthened.)  Svitak
 also noted that although the Action Program calls for abolishing press cen-
 sorship, it qualifies this by saying that the state should still be able
 to determine when publication of certain information can be forbidden.   Sim-
 ilarly, the Action Program calls for freedom of speech, but with the reser-
 vation that this must be "within the framework of Socialist laws."
 d.  General Bohumir Lomsky, Defense Minister and Deputy Commander of
 the Warsaw Pact forces, resigned on 3 April,  One of the last of the No-
 votny men, Lomsky's resignation or dismissal had been expected since the
 defection to the U.S.A. in February of one of his close colleagues, Major
 General Jan Sejna.   Lomsky's deputy, Colonel General Vaclav Janko, committed
 suicide in March.

 e. New Government Formed.   An almost completely different government
 was formed shortly after the Plenum ended.  Oldrich Gernik, one of the few
 hovers from the previous government, was named Premier.  Although only
 46 years of age, he has been a member of the Central. Committee for 10 years,
 and a member of the Presidium for 2 years.  Professor Ota Sik, Director of
 the Economic Institute and author of many economic reforms instituted in
 recent years, is one of five Deputy Premiers in the new cabinet.   He was
 a prisoner of the Nazis in the notorious Mauthausen concentration camp,
 19)+0-1+5.  Dr. Jiri Hajek, 51+, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, has
 YIeen a member of the Central Committee since 1948.  He was the Czechoslo-
 vak Ambassador to Great Britain, 1955-58, and Deputy Minister of Foreign
 Affairs, 1958-62.   The Party Presidium has also been. reorganized.   Of the
 10 full members of 5 January 1968, the date Novotny was dismissed as Par-
 ty First Secretary, only 3 remained (Alexander Dubcek, Oldrich Gernik and
 Z Ira,homir Kolder). In fact not one of the old conservative (Stalinist-
 ovotnyite) members remains.
 f.   Bloc Pressure.   Within forty-eight hours after the forced resig-
 nation of Novotny, Alexander.Dubcek was summoned to Dresden on 23 March
 to explain to leaders of the other Warsaw Pactl countries exactly how far
 he and his colleagues proposed to carry the "liberalization" program.
 Dubcek apparently at least partially assuaged his colleagues' alarm and
 assured them that Czechoslovakia, remained loyal to the Soviet Union and
 to the Warsaw Pact.  The Czechs achieved a noteworthy victory at Dresden
 in dissuading other Warsaw Pact members from holing planned military
 maneuvers this summer on Czech territory, since the presence of Soviet
 and East German troops in Czechoslovakia at such a critical time would
 have put the new regime under great pressure.  The harmony was soon bro-
 ken by Kurt Hager, leading ideologist of the East German Communist Party
 and a member of its Politburo.   Speaking before a congress of Marxist
 philosophers, including some from Czechoslovakia at Karl Marx University
 in East Berlin on 26 March, Hager attacked "renewers" and revisionists,
 and singled out Josef Smrkovsky, one of the most dynamic Czech liberals,
 as a chief target.   He was also extremely critical of Austrian Communist
 Ernst Fischer, who is frequently lauded by the new Czech leaders for his
 innovative ideas and for the fact that he led the 1963 fight for the id-
 eological "rehabilitation" of Franz Kafka, celebrated Czech writer.   The
 Czech Government took a sufficiently grave view of the Hager speech to
 hake a formal diplomatic protest to the East Germans over this interfer-
 ence in Czech domestic affairs.   In addition, many Czech Party and front
 Groups rebutted the East German's criticisms and expressed complete sup-
 port for Smrkovsky.   Indicative of the current state of Czech-East German
 relations, there has been no public East German acknowledgment of the Czech
 protest in more than two weeks.
 1Except Rumania, which did not participate in the meeting in Dresden.

 2.  Poland
 a.  Gomulka in trouble.  Student unrest and widespread anti-Semitic
 campaigns continued to dominate news from Poland.  However, these appear
 to be but symptoms of a growing political crisis within the Polish Party
 and Government.  The present Party leadership under the direction of
 Wladyslaw Gomulka has now held power for nearly 12 years, and a number of
 influential Party men feel that that is long enough.  Gomulka came to pow-
 er in 1956 as a symbol of resistance to Stalinist rule, but as the years
 have passed, he backslid increasingly to a very similar system of repres-
 sive government.  During the past six months, there have been more and
 more frequent reports of pressures on-Gomulka from within the Party to
 make way for new and younger leadership.  Meanwhile, Gomulka presents the
 somewhat pathetic figure of an aging, tired man, incapable of adjusting
 to, let alone controlling, the rapid course of events.  General Mieczyslaw
 Moczar, the Minister of Interior, seems to be gathering some of the influ-
 ence and power Gomulka is losing.  Another man who also is working hard
 to improve his position in the power structure is Edward Gierek, Presid-
 ium member and boss of the Party in Upper Silesia.  Both Moczar and Gierek
 have made strongly anti-Semitic statements in recent weeks.   Short biog-
 raphies of Moczar and Gierek are attached.'
 b.  Governmental changes.  Several changes which appear to be of only
 secondary significance have been made in the Polish Government.  Edward
 Ochab, the ailing President (Chairman of the Council of State), resigned
 for reasons of health and was replaced on 11 April by General Marian
 Spychalski, previously Minister of Defense.  Lieutenant General Wojciech
 Jaruzelski, formerly Deputy Minister of Defense, was-named Minister,
 replacing Spychalski.  Spychalski's appointment was viewed as a compro-
 mise between the factions of Gomulka and Moczar and his departure from
 the Defense Ministry was considered more of a loss to the Gomulka faction
 because his replacement is thought'to be a less staunch Gomulka supporter
 than Spychalski, whose new job reduces him to a mere figurehead.
 3.  Soviet Union
 a.   Brezhnev 29 March Speech.   The CPSU line has been harder in re-
 cent months, particularly since the Budapest Conference, and on 29 March,
 at a congress of Moscow Communists, Brezhnev delivered a tough speech in
 which he declared that "Western imperialism is trying to weaken the ideo-
 logical unity of the socialist countries by relying mainly on revisionist
 and nationalist elements."  He explicitly attacked dissident Soviet intel-
 lectuals and seemed to be aiming his remarks also  at liberals and intel-
 lectuals in Eastern Europe.  He made it clear that the Party would not
 tolerate Czech-type liberalization in the USSR.  He,called for "iron dis-
 cipline" in the 13-million member CPSU and warned dissident Soviet intel-
 lectuals that they "cannot expect impunity if they fall into the net of
 Western ideologists."

 b. Central Committee Plenum.   The Central Committee of the CPSU held
 a two-day Plenum in Moscow, April 9-10.   Party chief Leonid Brezhnev gave
 the principal report of topical problems of the international situation
 and the struggle of the CPSU to rally the International Communist Movement,
 as well as the closing speech.  A number of party leaders and other public
 figures also spoke, including the Minister of Culture, the Editor-in-chief
 of Pravda, the Director of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, the First
 Secretary of the Komsomol, and the Secretary of the Board of the Union of
 Writers.
 c.   The Plenum was deeply concerned over the potential impact on So-
 viet society of the Czechoslovak program, and over the political situation
 in Poland.   The extent of Soviet concern over Czechoslovakia may be gauged
 from the fact that the Plenum was originally due to meet 20 March and, as
 promised by Brezhnev just last February, had been expected to discuss a~-
 riculture.                             The twenty-day postponement was evidently occasioned by the
 soviet CC's desire to have the benefit of the results of the Dresden Meet-
 ing of 23 March, as well as more information on the "Action Program" which
 was formally adopted by the Czech CC Plenum whose final session was held
 cp. 5 April. When the CPSU finally did give some prominence to Czech Party
 activity on 12 April in Pravda, it did so by stressing the views of the
 Czechoslovak old-guard Communists, who are worried by the current liberal-
 ization drive.
 d.   The CPSU leaders are obviously determined to isolate the Soviet
 people as much as possible, not only from the freeworld, but also from
 he ferment in Eastern Europe.   The resolution adopted by the 360-member
 central Committee"called for expansion of the entire ideological activi-
 ties of the Party" as one of the "most sacred duties of all party organi-
 zations."  The resolution endorsed Brezhnev's intensive ideological cam-
 paign "to combat subversive efforts by the West" by tightening ideological
 control over Soviet literature and art as part of a program to strengthen
 the patriotism of the Soviet people,  The resolution claimed that "the
 entire huge apparatus of anti-Communist propaganda is now directed at the
 unity of socialist countries, the international Communist movement, at
 splitting the front-ranking forces of our times, at undermining the social-
 ist society from inside."
 e.   The CC Plenum expressed "full approval" for the decision taken
 4t the Budapest Consultative Conference to hold a World Conference of Com-
 munist Parties in Moscow toward the end of this year and instructed the
 Politburo "to exert every effort" for the success of the world conference.
 The Plenum also approved Soviet actions at the Sofia summit conference of
 the Warsaw Pact in early March; it expressed support for North Vietnam
 and for the nuclear nonproliferation treaty now before the U.N.; and it
 approved Soviet actions in the Middle East.

 4.  East Germany
 New Constitution Approved in Referendum.   In a national referendum
 held with great fanfare on 6 April, the East German electorate ratified
 by a comfortable margin (9L.9% of the electorate favored it) a new Consti-
 tution drawn up by Walter Ulbricht and his colleagues on the Central., Com-
 mittee.                        The constitution attempts to legitimize the situation which has
 existed for 19 years, i.e., a separate East German state in which the So-
 cialist Unity Party (Communist) holds all political power.  The new Con-
 stitution, which replaces a 19+9 Charter, guarantees all citizens the
 right, to an education and to a job, but omits mention of somepreviously
 approved rights, notably the right to strike.  The new Constitution con-
 tains what amounts to voluntary restrictions on East German sovereignty,
 especially in Article VII, which speaks of "close brotherhood in arms
 with the armies of the Soviet Union and other socialist states."
 5.  Communist China
 a.  Army Chief Purged.   Purges of key people continue.  The latest
 victim is Yang Cheng-wu, Acting Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation
 Army.  Yang's fall is of special interest as he was said to have been Lin
 Piao's personal choice for the position when the previous Chief of Staff,
 Lo Jui-ching, was purged in May 1966.   Yang has been replaced by Huang
 Yung-sheng who had been Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee in Kwant-
 gung Province, a post he had held only since 21 February 1968.   (The rev-
 olutionary committees have been established in many provinces throughout
 the country to replace administrative bodies which either ceased to exist
 or were powerless to act as a result of the excesses of the Great Prole-
 tarian Cultural Revolution.)  Huang Yung-sheng, 62 years old, has been an
 alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
 since 1956.
 b.  Red Flag leading theoretical journal of the Chinese Communist
 Party,has apparently suspended publication, no issue having been seen since
 the first of the year.  Chen Po-ta, member of the Central Committee and
 editor of Red Flag since its inception in 1958, was MAO'S personal secre-
 tary for many years and Red Flag was considered to be MAO's mouthpiece.
 It appears that Chen's star has fallen considerably, for he has not Ap-
 peared at public functions for some time, although his name has nbt'bee.n
 mentioned among those disgraced or purged.   Red Flag has loudly and fre-
 q,uently criticized the Army during the past 2 years, and the Army is
 thought to be responsible for having forced the journal to suspend pub-
 lication.
 6.   Dissensions within the International Communist Movement
 a.  Sino-Soviet.
 (1) Radio Peace and Progress, the Soviet Union's "unofficial"
 foreign propaganda broadcasting station, claimed in a broadcast beamed

 Approved For Release 2005/04/21 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400040002-3
 to China on 3 April that China had halted all economic and military aid
 to North Vietnam and said that foreign observers attributed the cessation
 of aid to chaotic conditions prevailing in China.
 (2) Much in the manner of the North Korean detention of the
 Pueblo, the Chinese authorities in Whampoa.held a Soviet tanker for two
 weeks, accusing the Soviets of using its visit to Chinese ports to spy on
 Chinese ships and fortifications.
 b. Greece.   Yet another recent example of dissension in the World
 Communist movement is the split in the exiled Greek Communist Party (il-
 legal in Greece since 1941).   One faction under Nikos Zachariades, who
 was the Communist leader during the guerrilla war in Greece, 1946-49, is
 based in Moscow, while the other has its headquarters in Bucharest.   (The
 group in Bucharest is reported to be further divided, with some members
 favoring the Chinese.)  An important aspect of the split is the bitter
 disappointment of most Greek Communists over the surprisingly mild atti-
 tude of the Soviet Bloc towards the present military junta in Greece.                       In
 fp,ct the Soviet Union has given profitable contracts to Greece and East
 Germany has even offered the Greek government credits to the extent of
 $90,000,000.
 c.   Iraq.  The Soviets have cut off their support of the Voice of
 the Iraqi People (VOIP), a semi-clandestine broadcasting station believed
 to be based in Bulgaria, which has been broadcasting Communist propaganda
 to Iraq in Arabic and Kurdish for the past five years.   On 24 February,
 only two days prior to the opening of the Consultative Communist Confer-
 ence in Budapest, which representatives of the pro-Soviet Iraqi Communist
 Party attended, VOIP announced that, "due to changed conditions in Iraq,"
 it would cease broadcasting as of 27 February.  The "changed conditions"
 in fact applied to Soviet foreign policy, not to conditions in Iraq.   So-
 viet policy currently is to curry favor in the Moslem world, including
 the favor of such "reactionary" (by Communist standards) regimes as those
 of Jordan and Iran (both monarchies), and Iraq (a military dictatorship).
 Three days before VOIP announced its "suspension," it excoriated the Iraqi
 Government in these words:
 ."The regime's evil, reactionary whims have caused the imprison-
 ment, death, or dismissal from army ranks of thousands,of efficient
 national officers and soldiers.   During the battle against Israel in
 June 1967, the regime sent only token units and resorted to a hypo-
 critical propaganda campaign instead of mobilizing the struggling
 forces against the enemy ....  They frustrated the will of the people
 by their provocative, intimidatory policy and crushed the people's
 demonstrations by force .... Such behavior reveals their strong feel-
 ings of support for the reactionary agent regimes in the Arab coun-
 tries and their inclination to bargain with imperialism ....   Those
 who ally themselves with imperialism and its supporters are actually
 placing themselves outside the national liberation camp's struggle
 against imperialism and Israel ...."

 Such sentiments being directly contradictory to current Soviet official
 policy, it is understandable that the Soviet Government out off its support
 to VOIP.  It is merely another instance in which the Soviets have sacrificed
 a~local Communist Party to Soviet national and foreign policy interests.

 Mieczyslaw Moczar:  Poland's Minister of Interior
 Mieczyslaw Moczar (pronounced Mo-char) has frequently been mentioned
 as a possible successor to Wladyslaw Gomulka.   He has also been called a
 "king-maker" because, although he prefers to operate behind the scenes
 and does not appeal to the majority of Poles, as Minister of Interior
 he controls the powerful state security apparatus and as head of the
 Union of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (a veterans group referred
 to as ZBOWID) he controls one of Poland's largest mass organizations.
 (Moczar has expanded ZBOWID in recent years by opening up its member-
 ship to anybody affected in any way by World War II -- concentration
 camp inmates, civilian victims, fighters adhering to the anti-Nazi and
 anti-Communist Polish government in London.  To perpetuate the organi-
 zation, he now includes the sons and daughters of qualified members.)
 With these instruments, Moczar can apply considerable pressure for or
 against contenders for the leadership of Poland's Communist Party.  In
 any case, Moczar is deeply involved in Poland's current power struggle
 and will be a key figure in any decisions of that country's future.
 Moczar's background, like that of many Communist leaders, is obscure.
 He was born in Lodz on 25 December 1913.  His Ukrainian parents had him
 christened Mikolaj Demko; he was known by his Ukrainian and Russian nick-
 name of "Wanks."  He received little education, and when very young be-
 came a member of a gang of petty robbers and horse thieves.   (He was once
 caught and badly beaten by some peasants while attempting to steal some
 horses.)  He got a job in a textile factory, and became active in the Com-
 munist movement in Lodz in the 1930's.
 At the outbreak of World War II, Moczar fled to the USSR, where he
 received training from the NKVD, the predecessor of the present KGB (Com-
 mittee for State Security).   He was sent back into German-occupied Polish
 territory by the NKVD, and joined the Polish resistance.  He "miraculously"
 escaped the fate of the rest of his unit when the Germans overran the area
 and killed or captured them.  There have been rumors that he had at times
 collaborated with the Gestapo.
 After the Germans were driven from Poland, Moczar participated in
 the liquidation of thousands of non-Communists, and is credited with hav-
 ing arranged the assassination of Boleslaw Scibiurek, the leader of the
 Polish Peasant Party, in December 1945.   In fact, this particular crime
 led to the murder of a UB (Secret Police) lieutenant whom Moczar feared
 and ordered "removed" because-of'his knowledge of the affair.
 Moczar was so ruthless in his actions against any enemies of the
 Communist regime, real or imagined, that he was promoted to Colonel and
 placed in charge of the UB in Lodz.  There he continued his repressive

 activities and thousands of Poles were beaten and tortured, and many were
 killed -- usually in the same buildings previously used by the Nazi Gesta-
 po.  Moczar was responsible for the bloody suppression of workers' strikes
 at Pabjanice and Moszczenice in 1945, in Lodz in 191+7.
 Moczar's career has been narked by ruthless opportunism.  His willing-
 ness to employ force. stamped him as a "Stalinist" and was his primary quali-
 fication for the post of Minister of Interior, to which he was appointed in
 December 1961+.
 He has become particularly prominent in the news from Poland in early
 1968.  According to some reports, Moczar helped to provoke student upris-
 ings in early March by ordering that the play "Dziady"("Forefather") be
 closed in late January.   (The play contained lines which, though written
 in the 19th century and directed against the Russia of tsarist times, were
 deemed insulting to the Soviet Union.)  According to numerous reports,
 the Polish students denounced Moczar during their protests and regard him
 as the most serious obstacle to political and economic liberalization.  In
 any event, Moczar reacted harshly to the demonstrations, and his UB plain-
 clothesmen played a large role in the numerous arrests which ensued.
 Moczar is'also regarded as a driving force behind the current campaign,
 against "Zionism.". It is felt that this campaign is at least partly an ex-
 pression of his hostility toward Poland's intellectuals, from whom he re-
 ceives no significant support and with whom he has little in common even
 though he has been trying to cultivate them by such standard techniques
 as conferring honors on them, going to writers' meetings and having his
 picture taken shaking hands with them.
 The picture of Moczar which emerges from his background, career, at-
 titudes, and policies is that of a "Stalinist."  Unfortunately for Poland,
 Moczar is not an exception amongst leading Communist politicians; rather,
 he represents a sizable element of the Party.  Whether Moczar can exploit
 his present strong position for himself or for a contender of his choice
 remains to be seen.

 Edward Gierek:  A Profile
 In nationally publicized speeches of 14 and 30 March 1968, Edward
 Gierek projected himself as a serious contender for the leadership of
 Poland in the event Wladyslaw Gomulka is forced to relinquish his 12
 year hold on the country.   In those speeches Gierek gave the impres-
 sion of a cautious advocate of reforms which would appeal to the Com-
 munist Party's younger members.  Although he criticized students for
 their behavior in the riots of early March he did not endorse the re-
 gime's harsh reactions in putting the riots down, and as a general
 practice he rejected coercion as a means of solving problems.   In the
 earlier speech he attacked "Zionists", but on 30 March he omitted them
 from his list of Poland's political opponents.  Gierek also emphasized
 his strong support of the Polish-Soviet alliance.  The combination of
 these positions and his reputation as a hard-driving, successful polit-
 ical leader and industrial administrator in Katowice Province establishes
 Gierek as a person who can appeal to moderate Party members and at the
 same time assure Party conservatives that they need not fear substantial
 political and economic changes if he assumes power.
 Edward Gierek is not an ordinary Communist leader.   He spent 24 of
 his 55 years (he was born on 6 January 1913) in France and Belgium,
 where he worked as a miner.  His activities in Poland since he returned
 in 1948 have been well publicized in the press and by radio reports.   He
 turned down opportunities to live and work in comfortable circumstances
 in Warsaw, preferring a more difficult assignment in the remote province
 of Katowice, where he has been the first secretary of the Party organiza-
 tion since 1957.  Gierek is also distinguished from most of his fellow
 leaders by his success in fostering industrial development in Katowice
 and by the support he received from the workers in his province.
 Highlights of Gierek's career are:
 1948-56:   Studied engineering and economics, performed
 Party work in Katowice Province, and became the Party's lead-
 ing expert on the political administration of heavy industry.
 1956:   Headed the commission of inquiry into the Poznan
 riots in July, and supported Gomulka in the confrontation with
 Khrushchev in October.
 Since 1957:   Has headed the Party in Katowice Province.
 Since 1957:   Has been a member of the Party Politburo.

 Gierek's industrial achievements are evidenced. by statistics on

 containing

 of the population, the province accounts for 20% of the
 dustrial production.
 country's
 in-
 Gierek has shown political. shrewdness in carrying out his assign-
 ments.                    For instance, he is credited with halting a trainload of food
 bound for Germany in the winter of 1963-64, a time of food shortages,
 and distributing the contents throughout his province.   He has seen
 to it that workers in his province are paid better than in most other
 areas of Poland.   In 1966 he undercut the national policy of restrict-
 ing celebrations of the Millenium of the Catholic Church in Poland by
 hinting that he did not agree with Warsaw, and thus gained some sym-
 pathy from Church leaders in his area.   He also bolstered his image by
 appearing to oppose Gomulka's decision in the fall of 1967 to raise
 meat prices.  One measure of the response to such political gestures
 was the March 1965 parliamentary election, in which Gierek's showing
 was as impressive as Gomulka's and better than anyone else's.
 Gierek also seems to have attained significant status in foreign
 relations.   He has regularly accompanied Gomulka on major trips to
 Moscow and the Soviet press mentions him frequently.  De Gaulle, dur-
 ing his trip to Poland in September 1967, spent considerable time
 with Gierek in Katowice and made flattering remarks about the "Polish-
 ness" of one of that province's formerly German towns.
 In national affairs Gierek has steadily broadened his appeal to
 Poland's various political groupings:  the Communist Party apparatus,
 the "Partisans" (hard-line faction led by Minister of Interior Moczar),
 the moderate Catholics, the students, and the liberals.   In addition,
 Gierek has developed extensive ties with the military by virtue of be-
 ing chairman of the parliamentary Commission on National Defense.
 In short, Gierek has worked hard to pave the way for his rise
 to the pinnacle of power in Poland.   The question now seems to be
 when will he make his bid, rather than would he be able to do nation-
 ally what he has done for his province ... and for himself?

 The Japanese side points out that the great victories in China's great proletarian
 cultural revolution have greatly inspired the oppressed people and
 nations
 all over the
 world in their struggles for liberation, and have dealt heavy blows
 Soviet modern -revisionism and all reaction.
 at
 U.S.
 imperialism,
 The Chinese side warmly acclaims the Japanese people's patriotic Just, struggle against
 U.S. imperialism.  During the past year, the Japanese people have repeatedly launched
 extensive mass struggles against U.S. imperialist aggression, for national independence,
 in support of the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression and for national
 salvation, in defense of Sino-Japanese friendship and in opposition to Sato's 'criminal
 activities in visiting the U.S., Taiwan, and South Vietnam.  A new anti-U.S. storm
 recently swept the islands of Japan.  The masses of the Japanese people have waged
 heroic struggles in powerful waves against the entering into Sasebo port of the U.S.
 nuclear aircraft carrier Enterprise, against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries building.
 of a military air field in Sanrizuka, and their building of a new U.S. Army field
 hospital in Tokyo, for recovering Okinawa, for abrogation of the Japan-U.S. "security
 treaty," and against U.S. imperialism's turning Japan into the biggest base for its
 :aggression in Asia.   In the course of these struggles, a broad patriotic united front
 against U.S. imperialism is being formed and broadened.
 The Chinese side declares that the great struggles. waged by the Japanese people are a
 tremendous su pnort and inspiration to the people of China and the rest of the world.
 Chairman Alao says:    Japan is a great nation.  It will certainly not Allow U.S.
 imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long."  "Among the Japanese, except for the
 pro-U.S. monopoly capitalists and the militarists, the broad masses of the people are
 our true friends."     The Chinese side declares that the Chinese people follow the
 teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the Japanese people
 in their struggle for independence, denooragy and peace, and are convinced that final
 victory assuredly belongs to the great people of Japan.
 Both sides unanihously point out that the people's war waged' by the heroic Vietnamese
 people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is the greatest war for
 national liberation in the world today.  The brilliant victories of the South Vietnamese
 people since their recent spring offensive once again demonstrate to the world that the
 Vietnamese people have completely taken the initiative in the war, and that the U.S.
 aggressor trobps have been badly beaten into an impasse and are sinking fast.- The great
 victories of the Vietnamese people have greatly enhanced the morale of the revolutionary
 people throughout the world and have put U.S. imperialism and its lackeys into chaos and
 confusion.   The flames of the Asian, African, and Latin American people's struggles for
 national liberation are raging.  The anti-U.S. struggle of the people throughout the
 world is growing,   Tmperialism, modern revisionism, and all reaction are in a dead alley.
 :The capitalist world is sinking into an inescapable crisis.   The devaluation of the
 British pound and the U.S. dollar crisis have greatly sharpened interimperialist
 contradictions.   U.S. imperialism Is facing a serious crisis politically, economically,
 and militarily.   The entire situation, as Chairman Mao points out, is this:   "The enemy

 personages, silo; g with the lapi?nese people, develop national integrity and fight
 shoulder to ;sheu].dcr against U, S.  inpeviali.sm and its lackeys.  The Chinese side
 exprensed firm support for the friendly Japanese trade personages in their struggles
 against U,3.-Japaneso reaction and paid tribute to the friends in the friendly Japanese
 trade circles for t'., it active effort's to develop the friendly and trade relations
 between the people of .1>,ina and ;rnpan,
 The two sides affirm that the "protocol on the promotion of friendship and trade
 between the Chinei  and Japanese peoples" signed in Peking on 27 February 1967, was
 correct.   It har played a great role in developing the friendship and trade between
 China and Japan and has been welcomed and supported by the people of China and Japan.
 During the talks., the two sides considered the prospects of expanding Sina-Japanese
 friendly' trade.   They unanimously pledged that they will develop the militant spirit
 of the "protocol," continue to insist on the three political principles and the three
 principles for trade, and the principle of the indivisibility of politics and
 economics in Sino-Japanese relations and make concerted efforts to continue developing
 the friendly and trade relations between the peoples of China and Japan.  These
 obstacles come from U.S. imperialism, the Sato reactionary government, and their
 accomplices.   Therefore, the friendly contacts and trade relations between the peoples
 of China and Japan can grow smoothly only if tit for tat struggles are carried out
 against the four enemies headed by U.S. Imperialism, their various plots and subversive
 activities exposed, and the artificial obstacles they have placed removed.
 During-the talks, the two sides discussed matters concerning the strengthening of mutual
 friendly contacts, technological exchange and friendly trade, reaching a harmony of
 views, and they are determined to make further efforts for this end.
 The two sides discussed the question of holding a Japanese industrial exhibition in
 China and reached satisfactory agreement.

 and Soviet seamen rests with the CPR Government.

 arbitrariness against its crew,  There is information that armed CPR servicemen

 These actions of the Chinese authorities are of a premeditated, provocative nature
 and are a rude violation of international law.

 when Chinese inspectors made an inspection, Ponomarchuk flatly denied his crime and
 tried to expose the negatives for the purpose of destroying the evidence.   Kosyakov,
 captain of the ship, took an intolerable attitude of shielding the crime of
 Ponomarchuk,  He openly opposed the lawful detention of Second Mate Ponomarchuk by

 Hanoi's Other Fronts In Asia
 May 1968
 For the past few years world attention has been riveted so closely on
 the war in South Vietnam that the steadily increasing pressures Hanoi and
 Peking are applying against North Vietnam's other neighbors have largely by-
 passed international notice.   They have not, however, escaped the attention
 of the other Asian nations -- particularly those being subjected to such
 pressures or those who fear they might be next in line.   The "Domino Theory"
 -- that the other states of Southeast Asia would be toppled, one by one,
 if South Vietnam should be conquered by the Communists -- never accepted.
 in many areas of world opinion, has not been ignored nor rejected in Asia.
 The statements of Asian leaders increasingly reflect their alarm over pos-
 sible developments should the U.S. and its allies pull out of Vietnam.
 Their concern is justified, for, as the pattern has developed over the past
 three years, it is clear that Hanoi and Peking have more extensive ambitions
 in Asia -- ambitions not confined to Vietnam, nor for that matter to the
 former French colonial area of Indochina, but extending to Thailand and
 Burma, Malaysia and Indonesia.
 What is Happening in Laos
 The nation most affected by a spill-over of the war in Vietnam is
 Laos, which has a little war of her own blazing despite her supposed neu-
 trality.   Helping to keep that little war going are approximately 15,000
 North Vietnamese troops who have been infiltrated into Laos to help the
 local Communist and pro-Communist rebels (the Pathet Lao) fight the Royal
 Laotian Army. An estimated 25,000 additional North Vietnamese troops are
 in Laos manning the extensive supply and infiltration routes that run from
 North Vietnam through Laos into South Vietnam.   The most important of these
 routes is the famed  Ho Chi Minh trail along which as many as 9,000 North
 Vietnamese Army troops have infiltrated into South Vietnam in a single month.
 Ho Chi Minh's troops are in Laos in direct defiance of the Geneva Agreements
 of July 1962 by which 13 nations (North Vietnam, Communist China, the U.S.A.,
 Great Britian, the USSR, France, Canada, Burma, Cambodia, South Vietnam,
 India, Poland and Thailand) guaranteed the neutrality of Laos; however, the
 military terms of the Agreements, calling for the withdrawal of all foreign
 troops except a small French training force, have never been observed by
 the North Vietnamese who have just recently increased their troop strength
 in Laos.  Nor has North Vietnam cooperated with the International Control
 Commission in conducting investigations of charges of violations of their
 agreements.
 A combination of factors is probably involved in Hanoi's recent intensi-
 fication of activity in Laos:
 First, the possibility that Hanoi has decided to open a second front
 in Laos as indicated by increased troop deployments there, the
 direct attacks by North Vietnamese troops against Laotian gov-
 ernment positions and the introduction of heavier, more sophis-
 ticated field weapons into southern Laos;

 Approved For Release 2005/04/21 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400040002-3
 Second, the possibility that the North Vietnamese are enlarging or
 diversifying the Laotian routes they use to infiltrate men and
 supplies into South Vietnam, at the same time continuing to
 use areas close'to the Laotian-South Vietnam border for sanc-
 tuary, rest and food foraging;
 Third, the possibility that Hanoi plans to use Laos as a political
 pawn in the event of peace talks -- presumably by taking as
 much territory as possible in Laos to strengthen her bargain-
 ing power at the peace table.
 (See attachments 1 to 4 for Souvanna Phouma's protest speech and other de-
 tails.)
 Thailand is Also Vulnerable
 The recent increase of Communist insurgency in Northern Thailand is un-
 doubtedly connected with Hanoi's strategy in Vietnam:  Hanoi's leaders must
 calculate that the growing military action in Laos, combined with increased
 insurgency in Thailand, may concern that country's leadership enough to af-
 fect Thailand's military and other support for the Allied effort in South
 Vietnam,   Hanoi and Peking have long been implicated in Thailand's troubles
 with subversion.   In late 196+ and again in early 1965 Peking's Foreign Min-
 ister Chen Yi told a visiting European that "we may have a guerrilla war ,
 going in Thailand before this year is out."   Chen told his fascinated visitor
 that Peking would furnish Chinese arms and supplies to Thai citizens to help
 them overthrow their government.   In 1965 the Chinese Communists also spon-
 sored. the organization of the Thai Patriotic Front in Peking with the spe-
 cific aim of directing Communist subversive activities in the northeastern
 and souther provinces of Thailand.
 Prisoners and defectors have frequently testified. to guerrilla and other
 training given to Thai citizens by Hanoi and Peking.  Hanoi has been conduct-
 ing such training at least since 1.962, concentrating on Thais from the North
 and Northeast areas of Thailand -- the traditional strongholds of the
 Communist-led insurgents.   The major Communist training camp for Thais is
 reportedly near Hanoi.   As many as 500 or 600 young men recruited in Thai-
 land have been trained in this school and have then returned to Thailand to
 carry out their terrorist operations.   Documentary evidence on this training
 camp fell into the hands of Thai officials in April 1966 when a Thai guer-
 rilla, who had surrendered told about his class of 130 Thai citizens who had
 been exfiltrated from Thailand, trained by North Vietnamese Army personnel
 in guerrilla warfare and then infiltrated back into Thailand to operate
 against their government.
 Other defectors have told of being trained in Peking where they were
 taken, on tours of industrial and cultural sites, met with leaders of the
 Thai Patriotic Front, and were trained by Chinese experts in guerrilla tac-
 tics and in the use of American weapons.

 Approved For Release 2005/04/21 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400040002-3
 Some of the "Thais" recruited by the Communists in Northeast Thailand
 have reportedly come from a group of refugees from Vietnam who became Thai
 citizens and settled in Northeast Thailand to a great degree retaining their
 pro-Vietnamese leanings.   These individuals, estimated to number 30-40,000,
 furnished a convenient starting point for Peking's and Hanoi's ultimate ob-
 jective of setting up full-fledged training camps inside Thailand proper.
 Defectors have already reported a basic sabotage school in Northeast Thai-
 land whose top graduates were sent to Haiphong (North Vietnam) for advanced
 training. The number of Thais who have been trained in North Vietnam, China
 and more recently Laos is estimated to total about 2,000.   (See attachments
 5 and 6 for details.)
 Thailand's government quietly fought the insurgents for several years
 and finally protested to the United Nations, but with small success.   In
 January 1967, Deputy Prime Minister Praphat bluntly said:
 "We can see clearly that danger of aggression comes from Red China
 and North Vietnam ... they have already started aggression ... by a
 campaign of subversion and incitement inside our country as they have
 already done in other countries, such as Vietnam, Laos and Korea."
 In October 1967 Thailand's Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman told the United
 Nations' General Assembly:
 "Let us, the smaller and weaker nations, candidly face facts and
 realize that imminent dangers which may descend upon our nations are
 less likely to come from nuclear development than from combinations
 of military and political ventures which their proponents euphemist-
 ically call 'wars of national liberation'..."
 Cambodia Also Reacts to Recent Events
 Cambodia's mercurial Prince Norodom Sihanouk has also been moved to
 outbursts in the past few months protesting Communist encroachments against
 his land and people.   For the moment, at least, he has forgotten his chronic
 displeasure with the U.S. in his indignation over the stepped-up activity
 of Cambodia's home-grown Communists, the Khmer Reds.   Sihanouk claims these
 Khmer are being assisted by Thai Communist forces with Peking's backing in
 concerted attacks against widely spread areas, from Battambang on the Thai
 border to Kampot near South Vietnam.  Vicious attacks have been mounted
 atainst outlying Cambodian police posts and the Khmer have used terror tac-
 tics to compel the cooperation of local officials.   In at least one instance
 they summarily executed a loyal village chief.   On 7 March 1968 Sihanouk
 wrote a letter to Le Monde in which he stated categorically that the Battam-
 bang attacks had been launched from "outside," that evidence of this "abounds"
 and that "Asian Communism strives to overthrow our regime from within."
 Sihanouk's letter to Le Monde appeared to represent a last straw.   In
 January, it was reported that Viet Cong representatives were attempting to
 recruit Vietnamese residents in the vicinity of Phnom Penh and in rural areas

 in eastern and southeastern Cambodia.   In February, stories circulated that
 the Cambodian Navy had captured a vessel carrying munitions to Communist
 guerrillas in southwestern Cambodia.; at about the same time, foreign news-
 men gave worldwide publicity to a North Vietnamese troop encampment within
 Cambodian borders.   The Cambodian Government at that time denied that Cam-
 bodian territory was being violated by the North Vietnamese and the Viet
 Cong; but Sihanouk did say openly that "civil war is being imposed on Cam-
 bodia from outside" and ordered the execution of any hard core Communists
 captured by the Cambodian police.  Finally, in early March, Sihanouk said
 in a radio broadcast that if a pro-U.S. government should take power in Cam-
 bodia "the supplies of the Viet Cong ... will be finished ... the sanctuary
 will be finished...."  This was the first time that Sihanouk has frankly
 admitted that Cambodia is being used as a sanctuary by the Viet Cong and as
 a supply route by the North Vietnamese.   (See attachments 7 to 9 for Sihanouk's
 letter to Le Monde and other details.)
 Conclusion
 There is little doubt that Vietnam's Asian neighbors would have cause
 for alarm should the Allied forces pull out of South Vietnam without first
 concluding a peace guaranteeing the right of the people of South Vietnam to
 have a. government of their own choosing.   Those who have discarded the "Dom-
 i.n.o Theory" so lightly might do well to gather about their maps for addi-
 tionaly study.   If they sketch on the maps those areas of Vietnam's neigh-
 bors already occupied or endangered by Hanoi, they will recognize what most
 Asian nations already know:   that Hanoi and Peking have not limited their
 plans for Southeast Asia to South Vietnam.

 Vientiane Domestic Service in Lao 0130 GMT 23 Mar 68 D
 [Speech of Prince Souvanna Phouma delivered on the occasion of the Laotian National
 Armed Forces Day in Vientiane on 23 March 1968--presumably recorded]
 [Text,] His Majesty the. King, your excellencies, and dear compatriots, the national
 armed forces have just completed their 18th anniversary today.  While we are celebrating
 ,the 18th founding*anniversary of the national armed forces today, we must know that
 p
 ly
 the situation in our country is (?deteriorating) critically.  Since the earart of
 1968; external aggression and invasion and internal revolt have been increasingly
 serious by degrees because the traitors '.[the  NLHX]  with the support of some.of
 our ne ghbors, have constantly (?violated and trampled underfoot) the 1962 Geneva
 !accords [on Laos].
 ,This year the war in Laos is,getting more serious, and everybody knows very well that
 this war is undoubtedly connected with the Vietnam problem.  Therefore, we can say
 ,that the NLHX is merely the tool manipulated by its alien bosses to serve their
 interests.  They have cooperated with one another to wage a propaganda campaign by
 ,saying that the current war in Indochina is "a national liberation war."  Under the
 above-mentioned pretext, the enemy recently launched fierce attacks against the Nam
 ?8ak area, which resulted in the involuntary withdrawal of the national armed forces
 from our positions there.
 Currently, the fighting in upper and lower Laos is noticeably (?improving) in Tha Thom,
 ,Lao Ngam, Attopeu, Saravane, Pha Lane, including the recent incident at Pha Thi.
 ?Although heavily mauled and suffering heavy losses, the enemy is still obdurate and
 continues to attack our strongholds, in accordance with his plan.  The more serious the
 ;Vietnam situation becomes, the more tense the Laotian situation will become.
 This is the first time that we have seen the enemy use modern weapons,  for example,
 some 120-millimeter rockets which the Lao-Viet forces never used before.  In every
 battlefield, the enemy forces have (?deployed) a large number of modern weapons which
 some foreign countries have supplied them.  This action, which is a violation of the
 `;1962 Geneva Accords, means that they do not respect (?this) legal Government of Laos.
 All these I mentioned are the important incidents concerning our Laotian problem
 which the government would like some (?international concerns), for example the
 United Nations and the signatories of the 1962 agreement, to know and to seek ways
 to solve and (?help protect the Laotian people).
 .,In addition, the Ho Chi Minh trail also passes through Laos for the benefit of North
 Vietnam,   (?To the people who doubt what it is. I will tell you that) the trail is a
 very important route facilitating the flow of supplies, weapons, and men from North
 Vietnam to South Vietnam passing through Laos.  We see that'the war in Laos is
 getting more serious by degrees and we see no end to it.
 :(?Even though outnumbered by the Lao-Viet forces), our national armed forces have
 bravely fought against the enemy and attained a number of successive victories,
 for example at Dong Hene, Lao Ngam, and Attopeu, and even though (?suffering some
 :leases), our national armed forces have bravely weathered many battles sacrificing
 ,the blood and lives of a number of heroic fighters.
 Dear generals, officers, noncommissioned officers, and rank-and-file soldiers, the
 overnm'nt of His hajest': the King would like to laud your highly praised duty [words
 indistinct] and our nation wilinever forget your ('conduct) when our nation was in
 critical situation.  The government is concerned about and closely follows (Ithe
 prngress) of your activities every step.  And the government is also trying to

 .that the victories or defeats in battlefields are lessons for the national armed
 forces to study for military benefit.  Once soldiers, officers, including commanders
 :of every level throughout the armed forces are united as a single unit, our (?suppres-
 'sion operations) will be satisfactorily accomplished.
 The important duty of the national armed forces is to defend the independence,
 (sovereignty, and complete territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Laos without
 sany manipulation or serving the interest of any political parties.  The national
 armed forces will always be strong if everybody, whether  he is a soldier, an
 officer, or a general in the front or rear, enthusiastically carries out his
 assignment, whether hard or easy.
 Moreover, the orders of the command, especially the orders for (?troops in the
 front), must be clear and just without any personal interestaof the higher commanders.
 In accordance with the armed forces discipline and orders, all of you have the
 re:sp'nsibility to fight the enemy to the last in order to protect the honor and
 (?identity) of the national armed forces.   Particularly, every officer must carry
 out his duty and discipline strictly so that he will become the good example to
 ,his subordinates and soldiers.
 Dear officers and soldiers, your current duty is now greater than before because
 the military movement in Laos as well as in surrounding countries is now (?more
 intense).   It is a fight between the two ideologies competing to expose the influence
 of one another.   [words indistinct]  I appeal to all soldier compatriots to be united
 to fight the enemy of our nation in order to protect the territorial integrity,

 Initially, most'of the trouble was in Nan

 to be in the eastern part of Chieng Rai Prov-

 Laos.

 in the area under the command of It. Gen.

 Now, although many Thai officers admit'
 they are thin on the ground, Thai troops are',

 They have been caught in a series of ame

 have  used  airpowei,  including   napalm

 Western observers say no strikes were
 called on villages whose people had not been
 warned to leave, and who had not had time
 to get out. Certainly there has been a stream
 of Meo, Yao, and other tribesmen out of the
 mountains as Thai officials ordered them to'
 vacate. Some 3,000 of theiri now are located
 in schools and other makeshift camps in the-
 lowlands of Chieng Rii' Province.

 North Vietnam Runs Guerrilla School for Thais
 The North Vietnamese regime has been operating a secret guerrilla
 !warfare school for Thais for the past four or five years.  One training
 ;school near Hanoi gives an eight-month course; other establishments for
 ;indoctrination of Thai farmers have been located in China and in Pathet
 Lao-held territory in Laos.
 A young Thai farmer revealed details of the school near Hanoi at a
 'press conference in Bangkok in mid-October.  Like many other Thais he had
 'gone to North Vietnam, not knowing that he was to be given guerrilla instruc-
 tion.  He had joined the "Farmers' Liberation Party" at the behest of a man
 from another Thai province, not realizing that this "Party" was a Communist
 front organization.  Through this organization, he was offered a chance to
 go abroad to study, and he accepted this offer, hoping to receive medical
 training.  The man who had induced him to join the "Farmers' Liberation
 Party" conducted him and four others from Thailand into Laos.  There they
 were met and guided by Pathet Lao or Vietnamese soldiers.  After 18 days of
 travel the group reached Hanoi, and proceeded to the training school.
 Our Thai farmer was given eight months of training in Communist doctrine
 and guerrilla warfare.  A political course instructed the trainees in methods
 of persuasion to use to get villagers to "Join the revolution" and the regular

 the People of Thailand," as well as to Hanoi radio.  130 Thais attended the
 school while the farmer was there; most of them were laborers and peasants
 from the south, middle and northeasterly sections of Thailand.  The group in-
 cluded 18 women.  Trainees were paid in Vietnamese currency at a monthly rate
 equivalent to 120 Thai baht.  On leaving, they received a pair of pants and
 a final payment of 400 baht.  The farmer said that he was in the fourth group
 'of trainees, and since the school had been set up four or five years ago, his
 information indicates that there are by now a sizable number of potential
 'guerrillas in Thailand, trained by Hanoi.  They return to Thailand in the
 way they come, via Laos; the instructors tell them that they will be given
 instructions by the liberation movement after they reach home.
 In the case of this farmer, the indoctrination failed.  On arriying home
 in.March 1966, he told his parents what had happened, and on their advice he
 gave himself up to the Thai police.  Even before he got back to Thailand, he
 related, he had known that the Communists were trying to use him as a tool.
 Also, he had no desire to endanger his life for the sake of Communism.

 :t  -
 Cambodia's Internal Disturbances
 Cambodia's. Ilead of State,
 Prince Sihanouk, has  issued
 ,another sharp warning against
 the  growing  threats  to  his
 ,co(uttry's security. Address-
 ing a Phnom Penh Press con-
 ;ference, he said that a rebel
 Cambodian "Viet Minh" move-
 tnent was trying to gain -con.
 trol of strategic areas In an
 'attempt to cut Cambodia in
 'two.  Recently, he added, the
 subversives forced the 'inhabi-
 tants                      of  several  villages in
 Battambang province to leave
 their homes and take to the
 -jungle.   Subversion had also
 :occurred In central Cambodia
 ,and the "Viet Minh" were try-
 ing to re-activate old cells in,
 !]'our southern provinces.
 It is now exactly a year'
 since  the  normally  peaceful
 political climate of Cambodia
 was    disturbed  by  agitation
 fomented by the Khmer (Cam-
 bodian) Communist Party, or
 Prachenchon, which has come
 to be known as the "Khmer
 'Maoists" and  "Khmer ' Viet
 1 Minh " The Communists have
 sought   to   exploit  economic
 f discontent . In some parts  of
 the Bat.tambang province and
 i:h other areas for their own
 ?purposes,
 Phnom  Penh  Radio quoted

 Sense of Urgency Enters
 Sihanouk has been making
 such complaints for about a
 year, but officials here notice
 that a sense of urgency has en-

 he has sharply reduced the scale'
 al' his anti-American attacks,!
 which formerly were a mainstay
 of his public position.

 Tse-tung."
 The Cambodian Prime Min-

 Sihanouk said when and if a

 He also accused Communist
 guerrillas in neighboring Thai-

 Reports Ship Capture
 In a speech Monday, Sihanouk
 reported that Khmer Reds had
 arrested and shot many village

 "Therefore, I am also forced

 said.
 And today he reported the

 The first clear'sign of this occurred
 last summer when Peking incited Com-'
 munist-led Chinese citizens of Burma to
 stage violent anti-Burmese demonstra
 bons. Next came open and repeated;
 Maoist assertions wholeheartedly sup-
 porting Burma's Illegal ComMunist party
 and strongly advocating a "revolution-
 ary people's war" to overthrow Na Win's
 government and bring about the coun-
 try's communization. So It is not surpris-
 ing that the guerrillas are able to flee to
 Red China's territory to escape pursuit,
 to be given food there, and to receive
 other forms of aid - Including presuma-
 bly weapons - from their patrons. These
 insurgent forces are not large at the
 moment, but they can grow, and they
 can become dangerous indeed in a coun-
 try, that shares a 1,200-mile border with
 so hostile and aggressivela neighbor.
 This is a matter of conceen, of course,
 or at least. It should be, to'othor coun-
 tries besides Burma. Every; land on or
 near China's periphery,' Including neu-
 tralist India, has a special stake in the
 situation. That is one of the lessons
 Vietnam teaches.

 Mr. Pheng Norin at a Press Conference on
 General Situation in Laos
 On February 29, 1968, Mr. Pheng Norin, secretary of the cabinet
 meeting, gave an interview to reporters on the present military situa-
 tion resulting from the invasion of the PL and the North Vietnamese sol-
 diers. He also repeated the opinion of the Prince Premier that the war
 in Laos would be brought to an end the same time as the Vietnam war.
 Mr. Pheng Norin told reporters in French that Nambac, an important
 strategic area and a front door to the city of Luang Prabang was occupied
 in January 1968, by the PL forces with the cooperation of the North Vietna-
 mese 316th Division, a onetime famous division during the Dienbienphu bat-
 tle.                     Our forces had to retreat from the area because of the overwhelming
 forces of the enemies.   The withdrawal of the government forces from the
 area ease the contact between the PL and Hanoi and at the same time in-
 tensify the situation of the battlefield in the North.
 Moreover, the enemies increased threats by launching attacks in the
 Central and Southern parts especially the areas in Khoueng Sedone, Saravane
 and Attopeu.   In order to get more evidence, the RLG requested  the ICC
 to send a delegation to investigate the situation in Pakse and Saravane.
 The   Canadian and Indian delegates had agreed to conduct investigation
 but the Polish delegation refused to do so.
 PL Attacks:
 On February 23, 1968, 1 North Vietnamese battalions and 2 PL battalions
 attacked Lao Ngam and at 0300 hours the same day 3 PL battalions attacked
 Attopeu airfield by artillery.
 Casualties on the enemy side:
 The Headquarters in Lao Ngam which was occupied by the enemies at
 0600 hours of February 23, was reoccupied by the government forces on
 February 24+, 1968.   The enemies withdrew from the area leaving 186 dead
 soldiers, 2 antiaircrafts, 2 DK-82 cannons, 8 B-40 rocket launchers and
 more than a hundred of 'rifles and pistols.   The enemies retreated to
 the areas of Narni and Phou Tid.   95 dead soldiers of the enemies were seen
 on the battlefield in the area of Khoueng Attopeu.   The present situation
 in the area of Khoueng Saravane is in difficulty.
 General Situations:
 Tha Thom in the area of Khoueng Xieng Khouang was occupied by the
 enemies on February 21, 1968.   The enemies also attacked the areas between

 Xieng Khouang and Borikhane.   Three enemy battalions attacked and seized
 the stronghold in Sala Dendin.   At 1900 hours of February 21, the above
 mentioned battalions attacked Muong Ngan.
 Enemy Aims:
 The enemy aims of the attacks are as follows:
 1.   to promote the influence and increase the PL occupation in order
 to strike a tough bargain during the future meeting on the problems in
 Indo-China,
 2.   to occupy the area of Phou Vieng which is a flourishing area in
 order to set up their Headquarters for sending troops into South Vietnam,
 3.   to take control of strategic routes of the National Army,
 4.   to help North Vietnam protect and broaden the Ho Chi Minh Trail
 to various villages and residential areas to increase moral irritation
 against the pilots in their air raids.
 61 Prisoners captured:
 During the attacks from the enemies the National Army captured 61
 North Vietnamese prisoners.        These prisoners serve as evidences to
 confirm the North Vietnamese cooperation with the PL to infiltrate and
 invade Laos.   The ICC also acknowledged the incidents.
 The War in Laos Depends upon the Vietnam War:
 At present it is obvious that the situation in Vietnam and the sit-
 uation in Laos cannot be separated.   The Prince Premier had recently said
 that the war in Laos would be brought to an end the same as the Vietnam
 war.
 Q.  Why doesn't the government hold an interview of prisoners in
 the presence of the concerned diplomats when some countries in the
 Socialist Bloc such as the Soviet Union, Poland and Red China deny the
 presence of North Vietnamese troops?
 Q.  Mr. Pheng Norin said, "We do not care.   The fact still is the
 fact."
 Questions and answers during an interview of three Vietnamese prison-
 ers are as follows:
 Q.  Why does North Vietnam invade Laos?  Because of hatred?
 A.  (One of the prisoners answered) I don't know.  We are soldiers.
 We fight according to the order of the government.

 Q.  What will you do when the North Vietnamese Embassy does not
 recognize you as North Vietnamese soldiers being sent to fight in Laos?
 A.  We are North Vietnamese from North Vietnam.  We don't care what
 people say and we have requested the Lao government to save our lives.
 Q.  How did you feel when you were captured?
 A.  At first we were afraid of being killed.   To the contrary, we
 all have been well treated by ordinary authorities.      We don't know how
 the higher-ups will treat us.
 Q.  Were you forced to fight in Laos?  Did you volunteer to fight
 in Laos?
 Q.  Radios of Hanoi and Peking deceive the world that North Vietna-

 Q.  If you are released, what will you do?  Will you go back to
 North Vietnam?  Or will you live in Laos?
 A.  We would rather go back to see our parents.   If the Lao govern-
 ment does not allow us then we have to live here.
 Q.  How do your government and your families feel knowing that you
 are captured?
 A.  We don't know what to say because we have never been captured.
 This is the first time.  We know well that our families will feel ashamed

 7 March 1968
 A Letter from Prince Sihanouk
 We received from Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian Chief of State,
 the following letter concerning an article that our contributor, Jacques
 Decornoy, wrote on the situation in his country [Cambodia], in the
 Monde, on 2 February 1968:
 "Mr. Decornoy implied that the revolt in the southern part of Battam-
 bang was not the result of foreign instigation, but originat(d essentially
 from discontent among the people, which was caused by a lack of employ-
 ment for young intellectuals, the 'burdensome' presence of the army, and
 other reasons, among which, of course, was corruption.
 This point of view seems very far from the truth, and I should like
 to explain to your readers what the real situation is.
 First of all, the people in this part of Battambang are not at all
 unhappy.   As in the case of all inhabitants of remote areas, these
 people had received fertile land (2 to 5 hectares per family), fully
 equipped houses, animals for tilling soil and for breeding purposes,
 agricultural machinery, and seed.   I believe that Cambodia is one of the
 very few countries to do as much for their small farmers.
 Further, roads have been opened, and schools, hospitals, and co-
 operatives have been set up in this area.
 There could not be any 'uprising' under such conditions; but this
 province has been occupied for many years by the Vietminh, which has seen
 to it that it has indoctrinated certain people, and has continued to be
 in contact with them.   They are the ones who took up arms.   They are
 headed by some former professors -- and perhaps also by some deputies
 'who have disappeared.'   They are the ones who have obliged the people,
 under threat of death, to leave their villages and to go to the forests.
 Has our army behaved badly toward the people?  I should like to
 emphasize that no troops have ever been quartered in the area of Samlaut,
 which is the seat of the rebellion.   The only soldiers that could have
 been seern.,there were there only occasionally, to open roads, to build
 bridges, and to bring supplies to the villages.
 And unemployment among the young people?  There is not a single
 unemployed person in this area of small proprietors.   The people live
 more comfortably and have more means than those in other provinces.   I
 am not unaware of the problem of employment, which is of national inter-
 est.                             It is precisely in order to give work to young people that our
 government has increased the number of factories and of government
 plantations and settlements, which have furnished. some dozens of thousands
 of new jobs.   Our training is now essentially technical and professional.

 We are a nation of many students (1,053,000 young people go to school,
 to the lycee, to the university, out of 6,300,000 inhabitants), and we
 must make an even greater effort to ensure work for everyone.  One might
 ask if the other countries of the 'Third World' are resolving their
 unemployment problem better than we are.  Permit me to doubt this, in
 view of what is obviously happening elsewhere.  Whatever the case may be,
 there is not a single 'former unemployed person' among the Battambang
 rebels.
 Corruption?  I do not deny that it still exists.  It is an 'insti-
 tution' which not only afflicts our Asia, but which strikes very developed
 countries as well.  But we are fighting against this.   Our press, both
 governmental and private, denounces it with exceptional vigor.  Sanctions
 are applied against the guilty each time their offenses are proven. The
 sanctions include censure, loss of job, and even imprisonment.  It is
 precisely because we do not hide anything (in contrast to our neighbors)
 that we are accused of laisser-faire.
 The uprising in Battambang is essentially political and was started
 by outsiders.  There is abundant proof:  the discovery of propaganda
 leaflets printed in Siamese in Peking and bearing the image of Mao (this
 is material that was offered by the patriotic Thai Front who are loyal
 to the Chinese, which operates in the neighboring Thai provinces and
 supply our rebels with weapons and equipment).
 I should also like to emphasize the foreign origin of thousands of
 leaflets insulting Marshal Tito, which were distributed during the days
 preceding his arrival, of the weapons, and of the means of communication
 that were discovered among the Chinese terrorists who were preparing an
 attempt on the life of the Yugoslav Chief of State.  And it was also at
 the request of a foreigner that an illiterate mountain dweller from
 Rattanakiri -- a province near Vietnam -- recently questioned me concern-
 ing the visit of Mrs. Kennedy and of Ambassador Chester Bowles.
 It is perfectly clear that Asiatic Communism no longer permits us
 to remain neutral and outside the conflict in which the Sino-Vietnamese
 and Americans are involved.   Since they were not able to succeed in mak-
 ing us parties to unconditional surrender (we do not want to die for
 Hanoi or Peking -- nor for Washington, either), Asiatic Communism has
 attempted to overthrow our government, from within.  As long as the great
 majority of my compatriots will put their trust in me, I will pursue the
 struggle for the independence and freedom of my country.

 Communist Military and Economic Support
 Of the North Vietnamese War Effort
 May 1968
 On 23 September 1967, North Vietnam's Deputy Premier Le Than Nghi signed
 in Moscow a new agreement under which the USSR was to continue in 1968 to
 deliver military and economic goods, some free of charge and some on credit,
 to North Vietnam.   During the previous month and a half, Le Than Nghi's dele-
 gation had signed military and economic aid agreements in Peking, Pyongyang,
 Sofia, Bucharest and Havana.
 Moscow was faced with a dilemma in announcing its agreement.   For So-
 viet citizens, it was desirable to continue to tone down the military nature
 and the magnitude of the USSR's support of North Vietnam.  As part of Mos-
 cow's continuing polemics with Peking, it was desirable to create the oppo-
 site impression:   that the USSR was living up to its obligations to her em-
 battled Vietnamese ally by supplying large quantities of advanced weapons
 and armament.   The result was that, in announcing the new aid agreement, the
 Soviet press for the first time emphasized the military aspect by stating
 that, at the request of the North Vietnamese Government, the USSR would de-
 liver aircraft, antiaircraft rockets, artillery and infantry weapons, and
 ammunition.   However no figures were given, although it was indicated that
 the 1968 shipments would exceed the volume of previous years.
 Non-Communist journalists have attempted to ascertain, first, the ex-
 tent of the support the North Vietnamese were actually receiving from Com-
 munist countries, and, second, the significance of such support.
 Soviet and other Communist publications have. revealed little, because
 it would be undesirable for their citizens to be able to relate support of
 a far-away war to the shortages of goods at home.   One clue has come from
 the Soviet press.   In February 1967 Marshal Zakharov, Chief of the Soviet
 General Staff, explained the military budget's 1.1 billion ruble increase
 (from 13.4 billion rubles in 1966 to 14+.5 billion in 1967) by referring to
 military aid to North Vietnam.   Later, on 15 April 1967, Radio Moscow men-
 tioned "the current increase in Soviet weapons shipments by sea and espe-
 cially by land, to the Vietnamese Democratic Republic."
 Various estimates of the magnitude of Communist war aid have appeared
 in Western media.   The Neue Zuercher Zeitung of 29 September 1967 cited form-
 er U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara as having estimated Soviet shipments
 to North Vietnam in 1967 at $1 billion and commented that:this figure would
 appear to be too low.   On 5 November 1967, in the New York Times, Soviet aid
 in 1965, 1966 and 1967 was estimated at $1.5 billion.   Other journalists
 point out that this figure may well be low, since the Soviets price their war
 goods for export at as little as a fourth of their cost.   The USSR has pro-
 vided the preponderance of the aid to North Vietnam, perhaps three quarters
 of the total.

 The amount of materials shipped would be hard to estimate since rail
 movements from and across China can't be observed, as can ocean shipping.
 According to the New York Times of 27 December 1967, a record high of 17
 deep-draft ships reached North Vietnam in January 1966; it also reported
 that 22-25 ships arrived each month in July, August and September 1967; a
 number of ships were also observed steaming into Cambodian waters.
 The scope of military aid received by North Vietnam is indicated by
 the fact that Communist countries have provided virtually all of the mili-
 tary supplies for the estimated 800,000 men in its armed forces.   These
 forces include 7 North Vietnamese divisions in South Vietnam or on its bor-
 ders.            In addition, North Vietnam supplies most of the needs of the 9 Viet
 Cong divisions, as well as numerous irregular forces in the South.   Soviet
 shipments have included:
 -- jet bombers (IL-28)
 -- jet fighter planes (MIG-17, MIG-21)
 -- surface-to-air rockets
 -- antiaircraft artillery
 -- rifles (AK 47 and AK 50, the most modern in Soviet arsenals)
 -- 122 mm. rockets (5,000 according to one estimate)
 -- 140 mm. rockets
 -- 12.7 mm. heavy machine guns
 -- 120 mm. mortars
 -- two types of rocket-propelled grenades
 -- armored personnel carriers
 -- tanks.
 The Chinese Communists have supplied:
 -- 75 mm. pack howitzers
 -- 82 mm. mortars
 -- 102 mm. rockets
 -- AK L.7 rifles.

 Large numbers of trucks have been provided to the North Vietnamese by
 the USSR, Communist China and several Eastern European countries.  Also,
 the Chinese Communists have provided gunboats and the USSR has provided sub-
 marine chasers and motor torpedo boats to the North Vietnamese Navy,.
 Military aid has also been provided in the form of training.     Hundreds
 of North Vietnamese military personnel are said to be in the USSR and East-
 ern Europe learning to operate modern weapons such as MIG jet fighter air-
 craft and surface-to-air rockets.  Other military training 'was being given
 to many more of the 3,000 North Vietnamese in the USSR in 1967.   According
 to an agreement signed in July 1967, 6,000 North Vietnamese (including
 military, industrial and other personnel) are to be trained in the USSR
 between 1967 and 1969.   Similar agreements were reached with other Eastern
 European countries for the training of an  additional 1+,000 North Vietnamese.
 Unknown numbers of military "advisors" and instructors from several Com-
 munist countries are reportedly in North Vietnam on training missions.   Fur-
 thermore, the Chinese Communists are reported to have sent 50,000 to 100,000
 engineer troops to help repair damages to airfields, bridges, rail lines and
 roads on which military supplies are delivered and to construct new military
 support facilities.
 Non-military aid in 1967 consisted mainly of food, but also included
 civilian transport equipment and small industrial plants.  Food supplied in
 1967 amounted to about a half million tons.   The Soviets shipped flour and
 wheat (a substitute for rice and distasteful to the Vietnamese).   The Chi-
 nese Communists shipped rice and the Eastern Europeans sent beans and grain.
 In summary, the Communist countries have contributed massive military
 and economic aid to the North Vietnamese war effort.   Such aid has acceler-
 ated during the past year and, according to agreements now in force, it is
 expected to increase further.
 The significance of such outside support can be measured against the
 capability of the North Vietnamese economy to supply the wherewithal with
 which to fight the war in the South.   To do this, it is helpful to take a
 look at a few pertinent features of the North Vietnamese economy:
 First, its gross national product at its high point in 1961+ was only
 1.6 billion dollars, or less than $90 per capita.*
 Second, North Vietnam has practically no capacity to produce military
 equipment, not even small arms.  North Vietnam's industrial production con-
 sists largely of minerals, cement and coal and thus is severely limited in
 its capacity to support war.
 *Most estimates of the North Vietnamese economy are based upon Soviet sta-
 tistical compii'lations  and are believed to tend to exaggerate rather than
 to underestimate its magnitude.

 Third, North Vietnam's industry has been almost totally dependent upon
 foreign aid for its development, which lagged far behind planned goals,
 even in the period 1954-6L when it was not hindered by the bombing.
 Fourth, and of great significance, the country's agricultural produc-
 tion has been sufficient to feed its people in only one year since 1956.
 North Vietnam's rice production, for example, reached a peak in 1959; by
 1963 it had declined by 17%.   (South Vietnam outstripped North Vietnam in
 increasing rice production by a ratio of more than 4+ to 3 in the late 1950's
 and early 1960's.)
 North Vietnam's economic history from 1954 to 196+ was characterized by
 failures and disappointments which were relieved only by grants and credits
 from Communist countries amounting to approximately $1 billion.   The orga-
 nization and management of industry suffered from difficulties very similar
 to those prevailing in the Eastern European satellites during their early at-
 tempts to adopt Soviet-style economies.  As stated in September 1960 by
 Nguyen Duy Trinh, Minister of State for Economic Planning,
 "... in planning, we have been more or less subjective; some in-
 dices were too high, thereby bringing about a tense situation in the
 course of their implementation.   A number of departments did not ful-
 fill their plans, thus causing a measure of discouragement in these
 departments.   A number of concrete policies were not formulated or
 amended in time; control was not very strict; cases of corruption and
 waste are still rather numerous."
 One specific failure was witnessed in the construction of the Thai-
 Nguyen Steel Plant:   The Vietnamese reduced the size of the French-planned
 project by one half, and still hadn't completed it 7 years after construc-
 tion had begun.
 In agriculture the regime was confronted not only with serious organi-
 zational problems, but also with a peasant revolt in 1956 over the regime's
 poorly planned and clumsily executed land reform.   This revolt resulted in
 the execution of close to 50,000 people and the arrest and detention at forced
 labor of more than 100,000, according to Bernard Fall in The Two Vietnams.
 The current shakiness of the North Vietnamese economy is underscored by
 the fact that the regime has refused since 1963 to issue reports on the sta-
 tus of its economy.   Recently Far East observers have noted -North Vietnamese
 reports of labor waste in industry and agriculture caused by absenteeism,
 bad organization, inefficiency, "freedomism" (a term used pejoratively), cor-
 ruption, and an unwillingness of minor officials to work in the rural areas.
 Even from such a brief survey of the economy it is possible to conclude
 that North Vietnam falls far short of the capacity to wage or support a sus-
 tained war beyond its borders.  North Vietnam could hardly get started on
 such a war without large-scale aid; and it would certainly be obliged to
 abandon its efforts in the South if the military and economic aid of the Com-
 munist countries were stopped.

 India:  Early Russian Interest
 and Soviet Penetration
 May 1968
 In the late fifteenth century a Russian merchant named Atanasiy Nikitin
 arrived in India to explore possibilities of Indo-Russian trade.                      After
 spending four years on the sub-continent, he returned home completely dis-
 enchanted with his enterprise.  "Brethren, Russian Christians ... the infi-
 del dogs have lied to me, for there is nothing to be found in India for us;
 pepper and colors, these are cheap but bringing them by sea costs taxes
 and there are many pirates on the sea," he reported to his compatriots.
 Some years later -- in 1579 -- a Jesuit priest, Thomas Stevens, arrived
 in Goa on a Portuguese ship.  The first Englishman to set foot on Indian
 soil, he devoted the next forty years to missionary work among the natives.
 He is remembered less for his evangelistic accomplishments, however, than
 for the impetus for Eastern trade which his letters are said to have pro-
 vided to London merchants.  That interest culminated in the foundation in
 1599 of the East India Company, which-lster".became'instrumental'in:the
 British-conquest'of'.India.
 It was not until 1675 that Russia made an earnest attempt to open rela-
 tions with India.  Tsar Aleksis sent a large delegation to Emperor Aurangzeb,
 but the Moghul ruler refused to establish inter-state contacts, reasoning
 that there had never been an embassy from Russia to Delhi before, that there
 was not and never had been a dispute between the two countries, that the
 Tsar's religion was different from the Moghul's, and that the Tsar, with
 no other possible excuse for establishing an embassy in far-off India, was
 therefore interested in Indian wealth.
 Russian interest in India took a new turn under Peter the Great (1682-
 1725) with his policy of expeditious westernization and territorial expan-
 sion.                            While the English and French East India Companies were engaged in a
 contest for commercial and political supremacy in India,* the Russian Tsar
 dreamed of extending his influence toward the Oxus and the Indus, but his
 death prevented his actual quest for India's riches.  Neither Peter's aspi
 rations nor those of his successors caused any chasm in Anglo-Russian rela-
 tions until the end of the eighteenth century.  Friction developed when
 Catherine the Great (1762-1796) launched a policy of southward expansion
 *In 1664, the French formed La Compagnie des Indes under the patronage of
 Louis  XIV to begin trading operations in India.  The first French settle-
 ment was founded in Pondicherry around 1674, and for the next hundred years
 and more, Britain and France fought continuously to get the upper hand in
 India.  Portuguese influence in India was at a low ebb at the time the Bri-
 tish arrived; Dutch interest lay in the East Indies (now Indonesia).

 with the ultimate objective of seizing Constantinople from the decaying
 Ottoman Empire.   Britain, a traditional ally of Russia, viewed this as a
 threat to the balance of power in Europe and to her dominant position in the
 Levant and the Mediterranean.   Tension flared up in 1791 when. Britain unsuc-
 cessfully tried to make Russia give up to Turkey the Ochakov fortress on the
 Black Sea which the Russians had captured after costly combat, and marked the
 beginning of Anglo-Russian rivalry not only in the Near East but also in
 India:   the first Russian plan for the invasion of India was hammered out in
 the heat of the Ochakov affair.
 Incensed at Britain's opposition to her territorial ambitions, Russia
 decided to threaten the British position in India,   This strategy was fre-
 quently although never successfully employed by Russia through the ensuing
 years in the ebb and flow of Anglo--Russian rivalry.  The Russian strategy
 of keeping Britain passive in the Dardanelles by threatening the Indian Em-
 pire failed, while the British policy of defending India beyond India's
 borders on the periphery of the Russian Empire from the Pamirs to the Straits
 bore fruit.  After some sixty years of such maneuvering, the end of the
 Angle-.Sikh wars (1849) marked the extension of the British frontier to the
 mouth. of the Khyber, and the British conquest of India became complete.
 As the size and scope of Britain's commitment in India grew, the admin-
 istrative apparatus of the East India Company changed.   Its headquarters
 became the seat of governmental power, headed by a governor general respon-
 sible only to the Company's board of directors in London,   After the Sepoy
 Rebellion of 1857, which for a time threatened to bring down British rule
 in India, the colony was transferred from the Company to the Crown on 1 Igo-
 vember 1858.
 To a large extent, the foundations of present-day politics in India,
 the pattern of government and parliamentary practices, the liberalism of
 the ruling elite and its preference for representative institutions modeled
 on Western lines were laid during the next ninety years ... from 1858 until
 British rule ended with the transfer of power in August 1947.  For the Brit-
 ish, the first half of this period proved a time of consolidation and re-
 form; for the Indians, the second half was a time in which to give shape
 and substance to their growing sense of nationalism.
 In August 1907, Britain and Russia, confronted by the German threat in
 Europe, decided to bury mutual rivalries in Asia by concluding the Anglo-
 Russian Entente.,   As a result, Persia (Iran) was divided into three spheres
 of influence, China's suzerainty over Tibet was recognized and its to rri-
 torial integrity acknowledged, and Russia recognized that Afghanistan was
 within the British sphere of influence.   The entente cordiale, effected
 without consultation with or the consent of the countries concerned, re-
 mained in force until November 1917 when the Bolshevik Revolution overthrew
 the Romanov regime and annulled its treaties and commitments.

 In order to allay Indian unrest, the British dramatically announced on
 20 August 1917 their pledge to "the progressive realization of responsible
 self-government to India as an integral part'of the British Empire."
 Shortly, therefore, with the Bolsheviks' rise to power in November 1917,
 Anglo-Russian relations with regard to India underwent a radical change.
 Tsarist Russia, whose expansionist ambitions often came into conflict with
 those of Britain, had been a military threat to the security of the British
 Empire; Soviet Russia, whose Communist principles and practice clashed with
 Britain's imperialist interests, became additionally an ideological threat
 which was even more destructive to the status quo than Tsarist arms had been.
 Tis.arist Russia craved for the control of Constantinople and the Straits,
 while Soviet Russia aspired for the establishment of a Communist common-
 wealth embracing the entire globe.
 The opening gun in the propaganda,.wax over India between the Soviet Union
 and the West was fired on 7 December 1917, when the Council of People's Com-
 missars appealed to the Moslems of Russia and the East, alleging:
 "Even far-off India, that land which has been oppressed by the
 'enlightened' European robbers for so many centuries, has raised
 the standard of revolt, organizing its councils of deputies, throw-
 ing the hated yoke of slavery from its shoulders, and summoning the
 peoples of the East to the struggle and to freedom.   The empire of
 capitalist plunder and violence is falling in ruins.   The ground is
 slipping from under the feet of the imperialist robbers."
 Whether or not this early insurrectionary appeal ever reached the in-
 tended audience is debatable, but it did not pass unnoticed by the British
 Government, whose envoy in Russia issued a rejoinder to the press in which
 he commented that "Mr. Lenin spoke of us as rapacious extortioners and plun-
 derers, while he incited our Indian subjects to rebellion."
 It took forty months of tumultuous Anglo-Soviet politicking over India
 before England first established relations with the Soviet Union, marked, of
 course, by the circumstances of World War I.   While Allied statesmen were
 discussing the Russian question, Churchill's War Office, in a statement on
 15 January 1920, described the extent of Soviet threat in the East, high-
 lighting the danger to the British Empire in India.   "... The Tashkent So-
 viet ... at a recent meeting, determined to concentrate efforts first on
 India, and it is intended to open propaganda centers there as soon as pos-
 sible."
 On 16 March 1921 an Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement was signed which, in
 effect, constituted de facto recognition by Great Britain of the Soviet Gov-
 ernment.   The rapprochement between two diametrically opposed systems of gov-
 ernment which had been arch adversaries was an agreement in name only; in
 reality, it was a move which placed mutual animosity on a different footing.
 The Trade. Agreement was subject to the condition:

 "That each party refrains from hostile actions or undertakings
 against the other and from conducting outside of its own borders any
 official propaganda, direct or indirect, against the institutions of
 the British Empire or the Russian Soviet Republic respectively, and
 more particularly that the Russian Soviet Government refrains from
 any attempt, by military or diplomatic or any other form of action or
 propaganda, to encourage any of the peoples of Asia in any form of
 hostile action against British interests of the British Empire, espe-
 cially in India and the Independent State of Afghanistan...."
 Meanwhile the Soviets were not letting down their efforts to keep the
 "General Staff of World Revolution" in a state of readiness.   On 19 July
 1920, the Second World Congress of the Communist International convened in
 Moscow.  Prominent among the Asian delegates was Manabendra Nath Roy, a rev-
 olutionary Brahmin from Bengal., whc became the first Soviet link with India.
 Soon after, Roy organized the handful of Indian exiles in Europe into an
 'emigre' Communist Party of India and started his crusade against the Brit-
 ish raj, ably assisted by his American wife.
 The political situation on the Indian sub-continent became more tense
 than ever.   Gandhi was preparing India for a momentous struggle against the
 Government; under his leadership, the Indian National Congress had decided
 to support the Khalif at movement (to preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan
 of Turkey).  However, the Treaty of Sevres (June 1920), which decimated the
 Turkish Empire, inflamed extremist Moslems who decided on hijrat (religious
 migration from one country to another).  From the standpoint of Anglo-Soviet
 relations, the important sequel to this pilgrimage was the arrival in Soviet
 Central Asia of some 300 Moslems.  A small number eventually became Bolshe-
 vik converts under the tutelage of M.N. Roy.   It was these who returned to
 India to work toward the foundation of the Communist Party of India in the
 late 1920s.   Founded under the auspices of the Communist International, it
 was originally set up under the general supervision of the Communist Party
 of Great Britain and made its first appearance on the political scene as an
 autonomous organization around 1938.
 However, Indian passions did not turn to Communism, but were fixed on
 gaining national independence.   On 25 November 1922, the political Bureau of
 the Russian Communist Party issued a secret circular, signed by Stalin among
 others, which stated in part:
 "A mistake was made by the Communist International in its first
 efforts to promote a revolution in India ... the real aspirations of
 these peoples to emancipate themselves from the foreign yoke were con-
 sequently used merely as an argument to induce them to accept Commu-
 nism.   It has now been realized that Communism is completely unaccept-
 able to the Hindus in their present state of development ... and inde-
 pendence is a condition which must precede it.   Our propaganda agents
 did not realize this...."

 Relations between Great Britain and the Soviet Union did not improve.
 Nevertheless, after changes of government in Britain, and in spite of in-
 creased fears of Soviet policies and mutual accusations of having broken
 the propaganda agreement of 1921, the British Labor Government did extend
 de  ure recognition to the Soviet Government on 1 February 1924.
 Two interesting, and now familiar, diplomatic and propaganda exercises
 were instigated soon after.  On 24 May 1927, after a deliberate raid by
 London police on a Russian trade corporation and the premises of the Soviet
 Trade Delegation (in an abortive attempt to obtain incriminating documents),
 Prime Minister Baldwin charged the Soviet Government with espionage, sub-
 versive propaganda and intrigue.   Disregarding Soviet denials, the British
 Government on 26 May renounced the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement and severed
 diplomatic relations.
 Great Britain and the USSR resumed formal diplomatic relations on
 20 December 1929, allegedly with the approval of India, in spite of recur-
 ring problems over continued hostile propaganda by the Soviet Union and b
 the Comintern.  When Foreign Secretary Henderson assured Parliament in No-
 vember 1929 that cessation of propaganda was guaranteed by the Soviet Union,
 his interpretation of Soviet promises with respect to propaganda brought
 criticism from the official organ of the USSR, Izvestia:
 "It is futile ... to pretend that this undertaking in any way
 concerns the Comintern, as the Soviet Government can neither speak
 for the Comintern,nor undertake any responsibility for the Comintern's
 activity."
 (That 1929 disavowal of Soviet Government control over "unofficial" propa-
 ganda organs holds true in the current Government of India complaints about
 Moscow's Radio Peace and Progress, and over the recently concluded propa-
 ganda exchange agreement between NOV     and India's governmental Press
 Information Bureau.)
 The pattern of Anglo-Soviet relations vis-a-vis India remained more or
 less unaltered until 1934.  The Soviets and the Comintern kept'on with the
 kind of anti-British propaganda and activity they had been conducting since
 the October Revolution, while the conservative press and parliamentarians,
 who seldom ceased their own tirades against the Soviets, maintained their
 protests against Moscow's violations of the commitments not to engage in
 propaganda attacks.

 In April 1930 London and Moscow signed a temporary commercial agree-
 ment which could be extended by mutual  consent to any part of the British
 Empire including India.   In the meantime, India was once more astir with
 the Civil Disobedience Movement, and the revolutionary ferment in India
 caused the Soviet press to publish glowing accounts of the whole affair.
 At the same time the Soviets were apprehensive that the British might
 wrongly impute Indian disturbances to Soviet machinations.   The Soviet
 press (naturally) published a warning that the Indian revolutionaries
 might be found bearing Russian arms ... and warned that any such discov-
 ery would be a plot against the Soviet Government by its imperialist foes!
 A change in Soviet attitude occurred following Hitler's rise to power
 in 1933:  the danger of Fascism took the place of the much-advertised
 threat of an imperialist offensive against the Soviet Union.   In February
 1934 Great Britain and the USSR signed a new trade agreement; seven months
 later, the Soviet Union was admitted to the League of Nations.   In the
 summer of 1935, the Comintern inaugurated the policy of the United Front
 Against Fascism; instructions went to the CPI, which had been declared
 illegal in July 1934 (and remained illegal until 1942), to give up its
 "left-sectarian" policy and to adopt the new line.  This policy remained
 in full force until the conclusion of a Treaty of Non-Agression between
 Germany and the Soviet Union on 23 August 1939.   It was then that Winston
 Churchill said (October 1939) that the key to the Soviet policy, which he
 described as a "riddle wrapped in mystery inside an enigma," was "Russian
 national interests."
 In spite of all the twists and turns in domestic and foreign policies
 of Soviet Russia, there was but one determining factor behind them all ...
 to safeguard and increase the power of the Soviet State.  Moreover, the
 increase in tempo of the Indian nationalist movement under Mahatma Gandhi,
 from .1919 on, provided circumstances hand-tailored for the penetration of
 skillful propaganda from the Soviet Union.  When most other countries were
 negative or neutral in their support of the Indian nationalist aims, the
 Soviet leaders were firm supporters -- at least until the Nazi attack upon
 the Soviet Union in 1941. when the Soviets again became British allies.
 Soviet leadership then decreed that all communists within the British Em-
 pire should support the British war effort, a demand that was very unpop-
 ular in India; today the Soviet Union is doing all it can to consign these
 events to oblivion.
 At the end of World War II, the Indian Communists tried to lessen the
 gap between them and the Congress Party.  They supported Nehru, hoping this
 would make him adopt policies friendly to the Soviets.   But Moscow did not
 approve this policy -- and it had to be abandoned.  The Soviet press criti-
 cized the cooperation of the Congress Party with the British authorities
 during the independence preliminaries.  Moscow then suggested the formation
 of an anti-imperialist front to mobilize public opinion against Great Brit-
 ain and the U.S.

 This was consistent with Soviet interest at the time:   in 19+7  the So-
 viets started the Cold War, broke their wartime alliances with the West and
 started to consolidate the Communist satellite empire in Eastern Europe,
 and the new governments of India and Pakistan were promised Communist sup-
 port.

 The Russians Are Coming
 Their "goodwill" call at the ports of
 Madras and Bombay at an end, three
 Russian warships-including the Drnitri
 Pozhar:skiy, flagship 'of the Soviet Far
 Eastern  fleet-pulled  up  anchor and
 headed home to Vladivostok last week.
 Scarcely had they cleared Indian waters
 before the New Delhi government pub-
 ' licly denied rumors that it might grant
 the Russian Navy refueling rights in In-
 dian ports. But the disclaimer in no way
 lessened the long-term significance of
 the visit. Not only did it mark the first
 time Soviet warships had appeared in
 Indian harbors; it was also the first oc-
 casion on which the Rod Navy had
 shown the flag in the Indian Ocean.
 All this was part of a little-noticed
 aspect of the growing Soviet effort to
 rival the U.S. as a conventional global
 power. Over the past few years, without
 fuss or fanfare, the Russians have been
 determinedly seeking to expand their
 influence throughout Southeast Asia and
 the western Pacific. And now, with all
 British military forces save the Hong
 Kong garrison scheduled to leave Asia
 by 1971, the Soviet drive cast of Suez
 is stepping up.
 The primary purpose of the Soviet ef-
 fort in Asia is presumably to counter the
 influence of Connnurhist China. In any
 case, much of that effort has been mili-
 tary. The Soviet Pacific fleet, with more
 than 100 submarines, 50 destroyers and
 destroyer escorts and some 250 shore-
 based navy planes, now regularly ma-
 neuvers in  the western  Pacific, once
 regarded as a "U.S. lake." The Rus-
 sians have also mended their fences
 in Communist North Korea and North
 Vietnam, sending them massive amounts
 of military aid, including some of the
 most sophisticated weapons in the So-
 vict arsenal,
 At the same time, the Russians are also
 making an energetic attempt  to will
 friends among the. 'neutral" nations of
 Asia. Cone are the days when Moscow
 supported local Communist movements
 in Iheir attempts to overthrow Asian gov-
 ermnents by force. Now, while Peking-
 backed Corm unists  air. in the field
 against the governments of Cambodia
 and Burma, the Russians are sending
 significant amounts of aid to both coun-
 tries. And in Laos, they have serupu-
 lousiy refrained from interfering with
 the efforts of the U.S.-backed govern-
 ment of Souvasna Phouma to fend off
 the Communist-led Pathet Lao.
 It is, however, in the avowedly "pro-
 Western" countries of the area that the
 Soviet Union is slaking its biggest pitch-
 and that is primarily an economic one.
 More and more, Russian consumer goods
 from marmalade to matches are appear-
 ing in the markets from Tokyo to Bom-
 bay, and, in return, Soviet imports from
 the area are soaring. The Soviet Union,
 for example, is now the largest single im-
 porter of Malaysi:uh raw rubber, and re-
 Gently \loscow contracted for an enor-
 mous purchase of Indian manufactured
 goods. Trade with Singapore, Hong Kong
 and Japan has also risen significanth', and
 recently the Russians have shown an in-
 terest in working out joint-venthn?e deals
 with private and  public Asian capital.
 For the past eight months, in fact, Japan
 Air Lines and Russia's Aeroflot have
 been cooperating amicably in the opera-
 tion of a trans-Siberian route.
 Along with all this economic activi-
 ty, the Soviets have also been busily
 strengthening their diplomatic network
 in the area. In the past year. they have
 set up new embassies in Malaysia and
 Singapore, both of which have strongly
 and-Communist governments. And so cor-
 rect has Soviet diplomatic behavior been
 that even the Philippirws, one of the most
 outspoken anti-Communist nations in the
 world, is said to he considering the estab-
 lishment of relations with .Moscow.
 Rivalry: What this expansion of Soviet
 influence will ultimately mean for the
 U.S. is still uncertain. Quite conceivably,
 if the U.S. were to withdraw its troops
 from Vietnam, Moscow might bid for an
 even larger role in Southeast Asia. But
 this is a prospect which appears to leave
 many U.S. diplomats supremely nncon-
 eerned. In the foh?esccable future, they
 contend, Russia simply will not have the
 power, prestige or money to replace the
 U.S. as the major outside power there,
 No doubt, these diplomats add, there
 will he a heightening of the economic
 and diplomatic rivalry between the U.S.
 and the U.S.S.R. in Asia over the year's
 ahead. Still, as one perhaps overoptimis-
 tic U.S. official noted last week: "The
 major hostile force in Asia is China. And,
 the Russians can be a counterweight to
 the Chinese along with us. They can
 help us promote stability in the area.
 They may make life more complex for
 us, but 1. hardly think they are going to
 make it more dangerous."

 WHAT CHANGE

 meat treasures Were not really a -

 had been debated long in advance, and
 proposals  and  counter-proposals  had
 been aired in the press and over the ra-
 dio and TV. Yet when Prime Minister
 Wilson told a packed House on Janua-
 ry 16 that under the economy programme
 the British bases in   SouLlicast  Asia
 and the Persian Gulf would be given
 up and British troops withdrawn from
 these areas by the and of 1971, he creat-

 been said earlier from the same parlict-

 sence Last of Suerr_
 For two days Parliament was in tur-
 moll. The government was  criticized
 from the Right and from the?Left. But
 it carried the day. The 1)10118 became
 law. Now a detailed exposition of them
 id available In the Defence White Book
 .published on February 22.
 The history of the British presence in
 the area from Suez to Singapore dates
 back to the clays of which Kipling sang,
 "Ship me somewheres Post of Suez,"
 and when Britannia ruled not only the
 waves but vast possessions stretching
 from Cairo to Hongkong.  In those
 years it was not merely a facet of po-
 licy but intrinsic in Britain's over-all
 policy of empire.
 ' With the disintegration of the  Brl-
 llsh Empire and the liberation of Bri-
 Lain's Asian and African colonies, the
 formula "East-of-Suez policy" came to
 denote specifically the complex of mili-
 tary and political measures in Asia
 constituting a new "imperial defence"
 system designer[ to protect the inte-
 rests of British imperialism in the liar
 slan Gulf and Southeast Asian coun-
 tries rich in oil, tin, rubber and other
 resources.
 One might have  thought  that   the
 breakdown of the colonial system would
 introduce far-coaching changes in Lon-
 don's military and political strategy. Ac-
 tudilly,  however,                     only  the  tactical
 methods were  refurbished and  Kip-
 ling's poetry was supplanted by                      the
 prose of agreements with Washington.
 In recent years Britain's last-o1-Suez
 policy came to hinge on her "overseas
 commitments" arising from participation
 In the Scale and Canto blocs and her
 bilateral military treaties with Malay-
 sia, Singapore, the Sultanate of Biunci,
 the South  Arabian sheikhdoms  and
 Saudi Arabia.       .
 There were also the "coatntitments" to

 An important factor too was her "spe-

 counter criticism emanating from some
 WVest-European  capitals,  it  wad . Said
 that the East-of-Suez policy was design

 ' Christopher Mayhew,, former Navy
 Minister, makes the relevant point in
 his book "Britain's Role Tomorrow,"
 published last year, that the British mi-
 litary. presence in the 101ddie East and
 Southeast Asia  "hinders rather than
 helps, commercial 'interest."
 "The cost of military presence there,"
 ,he said In the house of Commons in
 ,January ?1967, "is far greater than any
 economic benefits received from our
 military presence east of Suez."
 What has prompted the Labour go-

 for such a conclusion. True, Wilson did

 Britain's role in the world and "reali-

 outgoings to our true capacities." But
 at the same time Foreign Secretary

 The atmosphere of peace and stability in tho
 north of the Moslem East contrasts sharply with
 the tense situation in the south in the wake of
 the Israeli aggression against the Arab states.
 Israel continues to threaten the Arabs, and-they'
 can see who are their true friends. During King
 Hussein's visit to the Soviet Union-the first
 .ever paid by a king of Jordan- the Amman Al.
 Fajr el Jadid wrote editorially that recent events
 in the Middle East had "radically altered pre-
 vious political conceptions, clarified Arab rela-
 tions v-r! th different countries, and shown the
 Arabs who is their friend and who their enemy."
 Amman, the paper said, had "come to appreciate
 the importance of a policy of non-alignment and
 the fact that the Soviet Union and the socialist
 states are friends of the Arab and his liberation
 struggle against. imperialism."
 The joint Soviet-Jordanian communiqu6 is-
 .sued at the end of the visit states that "the Jor-~
 danian side is deeply grateful to the people and
 government of the Soviet Union for the genuine
 and valuable support and assistance which the
 U.S.S.R. has rendered and actively continues to
 render to the Arab victims of aggression."
 The communique: describes the Israeli ag-
 gression as being imperialist in character. And
 as the earnest of the Arab countries' success, it
 proclaims their unity on an "anti-imperialist and
 anti-colonial basis." It also says that "the Soviet
 Union, like other socialist states, will continue
 to render the Arab states the necessary support
 in' their just struggle for their lawful rights, in
 the rehabilitation and development of their eco
 nomy, and in strengthening their defences."
 The young developing nations have had many,
 opportunities to see the invariable friendliness of
 the Soviet people and government towards them.

 statesmen of our southern neighbour countries

 Castro's Continued Attempts to Export His Revolution
 Background of Failure
 Since 1959 Castro has tried to export his revolution throughout much
 of Latin America, or, as he himself has said, to convert the Andes into
 the Sierra Maestra of South America.   Since 1959 Castro's doctrine of rev-
 olutionary war, or guerrilla warfare, has been tried in sixteen or seven-
 teen countries, and it has failed in all of them.   Only a small, extrem-
 ist minority has heeded Castro's and the late Ernesto "Che" Guevara's
 call for "two, three or many Vietnams."
 Inherent in the guerrilla failures have been deficient leadership,
 inadequate training, poor support mechanisms and frequent internal strug-
 gles over leadership or tactics which, among other reasons, have led to
 disillusionment, low morale and desertions from the ranks.  External fac-
 tors in these failures have been the increasingly effective counter-action
 of the. threatened government security forces, and the complete lack of
 support, or even interest, on the part of the local peasant population.
 On a broader level, the Castroite movement in Latin America has been
 generally weakened by the increasing strains and, in some cases, outright
 breaks in cooperation between the pro-Cuban elements and the orthodox Com-
 munist groups, especially since the 1967 LASO Conference -- when Castro
 attacked the pro-Soviet parties as being in the "rearguard of the struggle
 against imperialism" -- which caused strains even within the orthodox
 parties themselves.   Since then, Castro's continued insistence that Latin
 America is ripe for revolutionary war, and his continued attacks on the
 old-line Communist parties have further strained relations and weakened
 his cause.
 Castro's Calls for Revolution
 In spite of the basic handicaps of the guerrilla groups and their
 repeated failures, and notwithstanding the apparent lull in guerrilla activ-
 ities following the spectacular failure and death of "Che" Guevara in
 Bolivia, the Castro forces are clearly determined to continue their ef-
 forts to create periodic, if not sustained, unrest throughout a number of
 countries in the area.
 Castro himself, in fact, announced his intention to continue export-
 ing his revolution even as he delivered his eulogy of Guevara in October
 1967.   Although he acknowledged the "tremendous blow to the revolutionary
 movement" of "Che's" death, at the same time he said, "they are mistaken
 who believe that his death is the defeat of his ideas, the defeat of his
 tactics, the defeat of his guerrilla concepts, the defeat of his theses...."
 Likewise, Castro's use of the January 1968 Havana Cultural Congress to
 propagandize the Cuban revolutionary theme, and his vow to "fulfill his
 duty of solidarity" with revolutionaries throughout the world was yet
 another demonstration of his intent to export the revolution.

 Bolivia:  Guerrilla Activity Continues
 After the death of "Che" Guevara in October 1967, the remnants of
 his guerrilla band went into hiding.   The three surviving Cubans crossed
 the Andes into northern Chile during February and were arrested by Chilean
 authorities at the village of Camina.   Although extreme leftists in Chile
 demanded the group be granted political asylum, they were deported to
 Cuba.   Because of the absence from the group of Guido "Inti" Peredo, the
 leading Bolivian member, it wasn't clear whether he had escaped arrest in
 Chile or had remained in Bolivia, but the Chilean left-wing newspaper, Las
 Noticias de Ultima Hora, published an interview with one of the Cuban mem-
 bers, Daniel Alarcon Ramirez, in which he said Peredo had left the others
 during a clash near La Siberia, in Bolivia.   The newspaper also quoted
 another report that Peredo had stayed in Bolivia with his lieutenant,
 David Adriazola, to try and revive Guevara's Army of National Liberation
 (ELN) and to reorganize urban support groups.  At a press conference on
 27 April, President Barrientos said the Bolivian  army was on the lookout
 in the northern department of Beni, where Peredo may be organizing another
 guerrilla movement.                                                             r
 The Case of Julio Dagnino Pacheco
 The most startling recent example of Cuban subversives still at
 urge in Latin America came on 19 April 1968, when the Bolivian Govern-
 ment announced the arrest in late March of Julio Dagnino Pacheco, a Per-
 uvian Communist journalist who acted as chief support agent for the Gue-
 vara guerrilla group in Bolivia.  He had used the alias Gernando Herrera
 Fernandez in Bolivia, but was also known as the "Peruvian Sanchez," and
 was referred to by this name in Guevara's diary.
 Interrogation of Dagnino revealed extensive Communist/Cuban links:
 He joined the Communist Party of Peru in 1959 and in 1961 went to Cuba
 where he was trained in guerrilla warfare for over a year.   He arrived
 in Bolivia in 1963 where he joined the Peruvian guerrilla groups attempt-
 ing to foment  revolution in Peru.   The next year he returned to Cuba with
 Nestor Guevara, alias "Negron," to seek support for guerrilla operations
 in Peru.   In September 196+ he returned to Lima to organize support for
 Guevara's ELN.   In March 1966 Dagnino was ordered by the Cubans to travel
 to La Paz to serve as a communications link and paymaster in the advance
 group of Cuban guerrillas preparing for."Che's" arrival, and he subse-
 quently visited Guevara in the Nanchauazu guerrilla camp on 31 December
 1966 with the Bolivian Communist Party leader, Mario Monje Molina.   After
 guerrilla warfare broke out in Bolivia in March 1967, Dagnino's contacts
 were restricted.   He claimed to have had neither contact with guerrilla
 groups nor instructions since Guevara's death in October 1967.
 Dagnino's testimony has provided the Bolivian government with consid-
 erable information on the Cuban apparatus and membership in Latin America.
 In addition to valuable information on guerrilla activities, the Bolivian

 Colombia:   Sporadic Incidents and Divided Guerrilla Forces
 There has been no major guerrilla action in Colombia for several
 months, although minor incidents occur from time to time.   The signifi-
 cant let-up is doubtless due not only to the successful military and
 civic action programs of the Colombian security forces in 1967, which
 considerably reduced guerrilla effectiveness, but also to the formal
 opening of diplomatic relations in January between Colombia and the So-
 viet Union.   This obviously places restraints on the pro-Soviet, Commu-
 nist Party-controlled Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the
 largest guerrilla force, with an estimated several hundred members.
 The smaller, Castro-supported Army of National Liberation (ELN)
 has been involved in minor activity since the beginning of the year and
 a new guerrilla movement, called the Popular Army of the Liberation (EPL),
 has recently been formed and reported as operating sporadically in the
 northwestern region of the country,
 There have been numerous reports on the Colombian peasants' dislike
 of Communism and their lack of cooperation with the guerrilla groups,
 which has been attributed to the government's reform programs.   But the
 guerrillas (many of whom are little more than bandits) are able to engage
 in periodic harassment actions.
 Guatemala:   Guerrilla Forces Regrouping
 The situation has been relatively quiet since the end of March, in
 contrast to the early months of 1968 when violence and bloodshed increased.
 This upsurge in violence followed a lengthy period in which the Guatemalan
 guerrillas had turned increasingly to urban terrorism and sabotage, after
 suffering severe setbacks in their rural campaigns.
 In February the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) split with the pro-Soviet
 Guatemalan Workers Party (PGT), blaming the "rightist leadership clique"
 of the PGT for guerrilla failures over the past four years.   The earlier
 merger of the FAR with the smaller, weaker but extremist guerrilla Revo-
 lutionary Movement of 13 November (MR 13), lea, by Yon Sosa, may well have
 contributed to its ultimate split with the PGT, although it is certain
 the Cubans played a major role in promoting the split, including publica-
 tion of the FAR leaders' attacks on the PGT leadership in the official
 newspaper Granma.,   The situation in Guatemala now is probably the most
 striking example of the growing polarization between the pro-Castro and
 pro-Soviet Communists in Latin America, and will undoubtedly mean continued
 Cuban support for the movement, now rumored to be reorganizing its appar-
 atus and its tactics in preparation for launching new guerrilla offensives
 at a later date,
 In addition to its strong urban leaning, the Guatemalan guerrilla
 movement has acquired a religious aspect in the involvement of the Melville
 group, the former Maryknoll missionaries who were expelled from the country

 authorities confiscated $20,000 from Dagnino which had been destined for
 subversion in Bolivia and Peru.
 Venezuela:   Guerrillas Suffer Setbacks
 On 22 April, a Venezuelan Defense Ministry official announced that
 at least ten Castroite guerrillas had been killed and many more wounded
 in a period of only three days, when significant clashes broke out for
 the first time in several months between the army and the guerrillas in
 western Venezuela.   Army units, supported by military aircraft, had pursued
 the guerrillas in the States of Yaracuy, Falcon and Lara, where Douglas
 Bravo's Armed Forces of National Liberation (FLN-FALN) operate.   An army
 guide reportedly identified one of the dead guerrillas as a Cuban naval
 officer.   On 21 April, a group of Venezuelan Castroite terrorists blew up
 an oil pipeline belonging to the Creole Petroleum Corporation near Mara-
 caibo and then reportedly scattered leaflets describing the action as
 "Operation Che Guevara."
 In early May, government officials confirmed that specially-trained
 army ranger units captured several more members of the Bravo group and by
 mid-May, following further skirmishes, an estimated fifteen guerrillas had
 been killed, with at least several captured.   This should leave only about
 forty remaining members in the Bravo band, which is also said to be weak-
 ened by a split between Bravo and his chief lieutenant, Leuben Petkoff,
 on the issue of rural warfare versus urban terrorism.
 In spite of these solid successes of the Venezeulan forces, the guer-
 rilla threat remains in the East, where the forces of the Castro-supported
 extreme Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) number over 100.   Accord-
 ing to a published interview withone of its leaders, Moises Moleiro, the
 MIR group will continue to concentrate on  classical rural warfare rather
 than engage in. urban terrorism, as the FLN-FALN tried unsuccessfully to do
 several months ago.   Recently, at least a part of the MIR force has been
 active in the area of the Bachiller Mountains in Miranda State.  A third
 group of guerrillas, under the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), has been
 inactive the past year, in line with party policy, although a newspaper
 story of mid-May says they may now step up their "armed preparations."
 The recent increase in Venezuelan guerrilla activity has been con-
 nected with rumors that Francisco Camaano Deno has been appointed to re-
 place Guevara as head of the Latin American guerrilla movement.   (Camaano
 was the Constitutionalist leader in the Dominican crisis of April 1965
 and later was Dominican military attache in London.  His sudden disappear-
 ance, while on a visit to Madrid, has led to repeated rumors he defected.
 to Cuba.)  There have been unsubstantiated but published reports that
 Camaano had actually made a recent, secret visit to Venezuela. and Columbia,
 as well as to Bolivia,to direct the organization of new guerrilla actions,
 but the Venezuelan government has denied any knowledge of this.

 for collaborating with rebel groups.   They are now attempting to organize
 their own "Christian Front" group from a base in Mexico near the Guatemalan
 border, intending to re-enter the country to help overthrow the present gov-
 ernment.
 Uruguay
 While Uruguay has been free of the usual Castro-type rural guerrilla
 warfare, Montevideo was the site in February of a meeting of pro-Cuban ex-
 tremists who are endeavoring to recruit Catholics with a strong social
 conscience for guerrilla warfare.   Calling itself the "Camilo Torres Move-
 ment," after a defrocked Colombian priest turned guerrilla, the group at-
 tacked the orthodox Communist parties and the social reform programs of
 the Church, and asserted that Castro's revolutionary strategy is the only
 valid strategy.   It praised Camilo Torres, who died in a guerrilla attack
 on a Colombian army patrol, as the symbol of "Christian-reovlutionary strug-
 gle."
 The marked increase in leftist activity in Uruguay in recent months
 is the result not only of the steadily deteriorating economic situation,
 but also of the splits which have occurred in the orthodox Communist Party
 of Uruguay (PCU), following internal disputes over resolutions passed at
 the 1967 LASO Conference.   There has been a noticeable increase in the
 activity of the more extreme groups, the pro-Cuban Revolutionary Movement
 of Uruguay (MRO), led by Ariel Colazo, and the National Liberation Movement
 (MLN).   The MRO has apparently-concentrated on putting out extreme revolu-
 tionary propaganda, although there have also been rumors it is preparing to
 turn to more traditional guerrilla activity in the countryside.   The MLN,
 or "Tupamaros," is a leftist urban terrorist group with has become notor-
 ious for bank robberies, gunfights and other violence.   There has been
 speculation that both groups may now be vying for support from Cuba.
 In early April Castro made a speech which is noteworthy because in it
 he appeared to modify his theory that rural-based revolution is the only
 valid revolutionary struggle.   By acknowledging that "different points of
 view, different theses" exist within revolutionary movements, and also by
 claiming that a "mass movement" had been developing in Cuba before 1958,
 he was apparently trying to concede to the urban populace, in Cuba, to the
 urban guerrilla elements in Latin America and to orthodox Communist critics
 abroad that urban masses, too, have a significant role to play in carrying
 out revolutions.

 CONSTANTES TENTATIVAS DE CASTRO DE EXPORTAR SU REVOLUCION
 Antecedentes de Fracaso
 Desde 1959 Castro ha tratado de exportar su revolucidn por toda Amdrica
 Latina o, como 61 mismo ha expresado, hacer de los Andes la Sierra Maestra de
 Amdrica del Sur.  Desde 1959 la doctrina de Castro de la guerra revolucionaria,
 o guerra de guerrillas, ha sido ensayada en 16 6 17 passes, y en todos ellos
 ha fracasado.  Salo una peque?la minoria extremista ha obedecido la consigna de
 Castro y del difunto Che Guevara con respecto a "dos, tres o muchos Vietnams."
 Motivos inherentes del fracaso de los intentos guerrilleros han sido la
 direcci6n deficiente, adiestramiento inadecuado, mecanismos de apoyo ineficaces
 y frecuentes luchas internas sobre la direcci6n o la tdctica, los cuales, entre
 otros motives, han llevado al desaliento, la moral poco elevada y las desercio-
 nes de las filers.  Entre los factores externos de dichos fracasos se cuentan
 la reaccidn mds y mds eficaz de las fuerzas de seguridad de los Gobiernos
 amenazados y la ausencia absoluta de respaldo y hasta de interds por parte de
 las poblaciones campesinas locales.
 A un nivel nags amplio el movimiento castrista en Amdrica Latina ha sido
 debilitado en general por las tensiones en aumento y,en algunos casos, las
 rupturas abiertas en la cooperaci6n entre los elementos procubanos y las
 agrupaciones comunistas tradicionales, especialmente a partir de la Conferencia
 de la OLAS de 1967--durante la cual Castro arr.emetid contra los partidos pro-
 sovidticos acusdndolos de estar en la "retaguardia de la lucha contra el
 imperialismo"--que provoc6 tensiones hasta en el seno de los propios partidos
 comunistas tradicionales.  Desde entonces la constante insistencia de Castro
 de que Amdrica Latina estd lista para la guerra revolucionaria y sus persis-
 tentes ataques contra los partidos comunistas de viejo cu?io han hecho mds
 tensas las relations y debilitado su causa.
 La Llamadas de Castro a la Revoluci6n
 No obstante las desventajas bdsicas de las guerrillas y sus repetidos
 fracasos, y no obstante la aparente pausa en las actividades guerrilleras a
 partir del espectacular fracaso y la muerte del Che Guevara en Bolivia, las
 fuerzas castristas estdn claramente resueltas a proseguir sus esfuerzos por
 crear des6rdenes de manera periddica si no constante en varios parses del
 Continents.
 En efecto, Castro mismo anunci6 su intenci6n de seguir exportando la revo-
 luci6n precisamente cuando hacia la despedida al finado Guevara en octubre de
 1967.  Al propio tiempo que reconocia el "tremendo golpe al movimiento revolu-
 cionario" ocasionado por la muerte del Che, declaraba:  "Se equivocan quienes
 crean que su muerte es la derrota de sus ideas, la derrota de su tdctica, la
 derrota de sus concepciones guerrilleras, la derrota de sus tesis..."  Del
 mismo modo, al aprovechar el Congreso Cultural de La Habana de enero de 1968
 para hacer propaganda al tema revolucionario cubano y hater la promesa de

 "cumplir el deber de solidaridad" para con los revolucionarios de todo el
 mundo, Castro demostr6 de nuevo su intenci6n de exportar la revoluci6n.
 Bolivia:    Prosigue la Actividad Guerrillera
 Despuds de la muerte de Guevara en octubre de 1967 los restos de su
 guerrilla se escondieron.  Los tres supervivientes cubanos pasaron por los
 Andes al norte chileno en febrero y fueron detenidos por las autoridades
 chilenas en el pueblo de Camina.  La gente de extrema izq.uierda de Chile pre-
 tendi6 que se concediera asilo politico al grupo, Pero dstos fueron deportados
 a Cuba.  Por faltar del grupo Guido (Inti) Peredo, el principal boliviano, no
 se supo de cierto si habia evadido ladetenci6n en Chile o habia permanecido en
 Bolivia, Pero "Las Noticias de Ultima Hora," diario de izquierda chileno,
 public6 una entrevista con uno de los guerrilleros cubanos, Daniel Alarcdn
 Ramirez, en la cual dste declaraba que Peredo se habia separado de los otros
 en un encuentro cerca de La Siberia en Bolivia.  El diario se refiri6 tambidn a
 otro info:rme que decfa que Feredo habia pernanecido en Bolivia con su lugarte-
 niente, David Adriazola, para tratar de reconstituir el Ejdreito de Liberaci6n
 National (ELN) de Guevara y reorganizar grupos urbanos de apoyo.  Enrueda de
 prensa el 27 de abril, el presidente Barrientos declar6 que el Ejdreito boli-
 vi.ano estaba alerta en el departamento de Beni en el norte de Bolivia, donde
 Peredo puede estar organizando otro movimiento guerrillero.
 El Caso de Julio Dagnino Pacheco
 El caso reciente mds sorprendente de agente de subversi6n cubano en liber-
 tad en Amdrica Latina se produjo el 19 de abril de 1968, cuando el Gobierno
 de Bolivia anunci6 la detenci6n a fines de narzo de Julio Dagnino Pacheco,
 periodista conunista peruano que fungfa de principal agente de apoyo de la
 guerrilla de Guevara en Bolivia.  Habia empleado el alias de Fernando Herrera
 Ferndndez en Bolivia pero tambidn se le conocfa como "el peruano Sdnchez,"
 nombre con el cual se le designa en el diario de Guevara.
 El interrogatorio de Dagnino dio a conocer sus extensas relaciones con

 Vene       a;   eveses a los Guerrilleros
 El 22 de abril un funcionario del ministerio de Defensa de Venezuela
 dio a conocer que por lo menos diez guerrilleros castristas habian sido muertos
 y muchos otros heridos en tres dias solamente en que se produjeron choques de
 importancia por primera vez en varios meses entre el Ej6rcito y los guerrilleros
 en el occidente de Venezuela.  Unidades del Ej6rcito apoyadas por aviacidn
 militar habian perseguido a los guerrilleros en los Estados Yaracuy, Falcdn y
 Lara, donde estdn en acci6n las Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci6n National (FLN-
 FALN) de Douglas Bravo.  Un gufa del Ej6rcito se supone haber identificado a
 uno de los guerrilleros muertos comp oficial de la Marina de Cuba.  El 21 de
 abril un grupo de terroristas venezolanos castristas hizo estallar un oleoducto
 de la Creole Petroleum Corporation cerca de Maracaibo y luego, segdn se infor-
 ma, derram6 volantes describiendo la acci6n como "Operaci6n Che Guevara."
 "    A principios de mayo funcionarios oficiales confirmaron que unidades de
 rangers  del Ej6rcito adiestradas especialmente habian capturado a varios
 miembros del grupo de Douglas Bravo, y a mediados de mayo, en nuevas escara-
 muzas, un total calculado de 15 guerrilleros habian sido muertos y por to menos
 unos cuantos capturados.  Esto debe haber reducido a unos 40 la Banda de Bravo,
 la cual se dice estar debilitada aun mds por una escisi6n entre Bravo y su prin-
 cipal lugarteniente Lublin Petkoff sobre la cuestidn de la guerra rural y el
 terrorismo urbano.
 No obstante los 6xitos ya relatados conseguidos por las fuerzas venezo-
 lanas, la amenaza guerrillera prevalece adn en el sector oriental, donde las
 fuerzas del extremista Movimiento Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIIR) cuentan md.s
 de un centenar.  De acuerdo con una entrevista de prensa con uno de sus lideres,
 Mois6s Moleiro, el grupo del MIR continuara con el tipo cldsico de guerra rural
 sin adentrarse en el terrorismo urbano, como tratd de hater el FLN-FALN sin
 4xito hace varios meses.  Recientemente por lo menos parte de la fuerza del.
 MIR ha estado en actividad en la zona de las monta?fas Bachiller del Estado
 Miranda,  Un tercer grupo de guerrilleros dirigidos por el Partido Comunista
 de Venezuela (PCV) ha estado inactivo el pasado ato, de acuerdo con la linea
 del partido, aunque a mediados de mayo se informaba que podia ser que incremen-
 tara sus "preparativos armados."
 En el reciente incremento de la actividad guerrillera en Venezuela se ha
 visto relaci6n con los rumores de que Francisco Caama?io DeT16 ha sido desig-
 nado en reemplazo del Che Guevara como jefe del movimiento guerrillero latino-
 americano.   (Caamano fue el lider constitucionalista en la contienda en la
 Repdblica Dominicana en abril de 1965, y luego fue agregado militar dominicano
 en Londres.  Su repentina desaparici6n durante una visita a Madrid ha suscitado
 reiterados rumores de que hizo defecci6n a Cuba.)  Se han publicado sin confir-
 macidn noticias de que CaamaTIo realiz6 hace poco una visita secreta a Venezuela
 y Colombia asi Como a Bolivia para dirigir la organizaci6n de nuevas actions
 guerrilleras, pero el Gobierno venezolano niega tener conocimiento de ello.
 Colombia:  Incidentes Esporddicos y Fuerzas Guerrilleras Divididas
 Por varios meses Colombia no ha teni_do i.ncidentes guerrilleros en grando
 escala, aunque si se producen algunos menores de vez en cuando.  La signifi-
 cativa disminuci6n se debe sin duda no sdlo al 6xito de los programas de accidn

 cfvica y militar de las fuerzas de seguridad colombianas en 1967, que redujeron
 bastante la eficacia de las guerrillas, sino tambi6n al inicio formal de rela-
 ciones diplondticas entre Colombia y la Unidn Sovidtica en enero.  Esto sin
 duda pone freno a las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas (FARC),
 agrupaci6n prosovi6tica controlada por el Partido Comunista y que constituye
 la fuerza guerrillera mds numerosa del pars con un total calculado en varios
 centenares de miembros.
 El Ej6rcito de Liberacidn Nacional (ELN), respaldado por Castro y de menor
 tama!io, ha estado en actividad en menor escala desde principios de ato.  Un
 nuevo movimiento guerrillero conocido como el Ej6rcito Popular de Liberaci6n
 (EPL) ha sido creado hace poco y se informa que es-td operando esporddicamente
 en el sector noroeste del pars.
 Ha habido numerosos informes sobre el desagrado del campesino colombiano
 por el comunismo y su no cooperaeidn con los grupos guerrilleros, que ha sido
 atribuida a los programas de reforma del Gobierno.  Pero los guerrilleros (de
 los cuales muchos son poco mds que bandidos) consiguen llevar a cabo periddica-
 mente acciones de hostigamiento.
 Guatemala:  Se Reagrupan las Guerrillas
 La situaci6n ha estado relativamente en calma desde fines de marzo, en
 contraste con los primeros meses de 1956 en los cuales aumentaron la violencia
 y el derramamiento de sangre.  Dicha erupcidn de violencia ocurr16 despu6s de
 un prolcngado perrodo durance el cual los guerrilleros guatemaltecos se habran
 dedicado mds y mds al terrorismo y el sabotaje en el sector urbano luego de
 haber^:padecido fuertes derrotas en sus campaTlas rurales.,
 En febrero las Fuerzas Armadas Rebeldes (FAR) se separaron del Partido
 Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT), prosovi6tico, culpando a la "camarilla
 derechista dirigente" del PGT por los fracasos de las guerrillas los dltimos
 cuatro affos.  La fusi6n de las FAR anteriormente con el Movimiento Revolu-
 cionario 13 de Noviembre (MR 13), mds reducido y ddbil pero extremista,
 encabezado por Yon Sosa, puede haber ccntribuido a su ruptura definitiva con
 el PGT.  Pero tambi6n es cierto que los cubanos jugaron papel principal
 en la promoci6n de la ruptura, incluyendo la publicaci6n en su diario oficial
 "Granma" de los ataques de los lyderes de las FAR contra la dirigencia del PGT.
 La actual situacidn en Guatemala es probablemente el ejemplo mds vrvido de la,
 creciente polarizacitn entre los comunistas castristas y los prosovi6ticos
 en Am6rica Latina, y sin duda significa que Cuba seguird respaldando el

 Ademds de su fuerte tendencia urbana, el movimiento guerrillero guate-
 malteco ha adquirido un aspecto religioso con la intervenci6n de los Melville,
 exmisioneros Maryknoll que fueron expulsados del pars por colaborar con
 grupos rebeldes.  Actualmente estdn tratando de organizer su propio "Frente
 Cristiano" desde una base en M6xico cerca de la frontera guatemalteca,
 proponi6ndose reingresar al pars Para ayudar a derrocar al actual r6gimen.

 Uruguay
 Uruguay ha estado exento de la acostumbrada guerra de guerrillas rural
 tipo Castro, pero Montevideo fue la sede en febrero de una asamblea de
 extremistas procubanos que estan tratando de reclutar catdlicos de fuerte
 conciencia social para crear guerrillas.  Ilacidndose llamar "Movimiento
 Camilo Torres," por el nombre de un sacerdote colombiano expulso que se
 convirti6 en guerrillero, el grupo atac6 a los Partidos Comunistas y a
 los programas de reforma social de la Iglesia, declarando que la estrategia
 revolucionaria de Castro es la dnica estrategia vdlida.  Ensalz6 a Camilo
 Torres, que muri6 en un ataque guerrillero contra una patrulla del Ejcrcito
 colombiano, corm el si'mbolo de la "lucha cristianorrevolucionaria."
 El notable aumento en la actividad de izquierda en Uruguay en meses
 recientes se debe a la situacion econdmica  en constante deterioro pero
 tambidn a las escisiones que se han producido en el traditional Partido
 Comunista del Uruguay (PCU) a rai'z de rencillas internas con respecto a
 resoluciones aprobadas en la conferencia de la OLAS en 1967.  Se ha compro-
 bado una mayor actividad entre los grupos mds extremos, el Movimiento
 Revolucionario Oriental (MRO) procubano encabezado por Ariel Collazo y
 el MWimiento de Liberacidn Nacional (NETT).  El MRO parece haberse dedicado
 a difundir propaganda revolucionaria extremista, aunque tambi6n se ha dicho
 que se estd preparando a dedicarse a la actividad guerrillera tradicional en
 el campo.  EL IvvTLN, o "Tupamaros," es un grupo terrorista urbano de izquierda
 que se ha hecho notorio por los asaltos a los bancos, tiroteos callejeros
 y otras formal de violencia.  Se han hecho conjeturas de que ambos grupos estdn
 rivalizarcb por el apoyo de Cuba.
 A principios de abril Castro pronuncid un discurso que as digno de notar
 pox que en cal parece haber modificado su teoria de que la revolucidn basada en
 el campo es in unica lucha revolucionaria vdlida.  Reconociendo que existen
 "diferentes puntos de vista, diferentes tesis" dentro de los movimientos revo-
 lucionarios, y asegurando que un "movimiento de masas" se habia estado desarro-
 'irn              llando en Cuba antes del 1958, parecfa estar tratando de admitir ante el
 pueblo urban de Cuba, los elementos guerrilleros urbanos de Amdrica Latina
 y los crfticos comunistas tradicionales del exterior que las masas urbanas
 tambi6n tienen un papel significativo que jugar en la realizacidn de las
 revoluciones.

 and technical aid for Commu-

 ? Genao, soft-spoken .33-tear-
 old bachelor, was interviewed
 during a brief stay in Miami.
 He was among the Commu-

 civil war in the Dominican Re-

 was high on a list of '77 Domin-

 U.S, intelligence sources and
 issued during the revolt as
 part of t 'c justification for

 By WILLIAM MONTALSANO
 Herald Lann America Correspondent
 'no flow of Cuban nteney,
 arms, agents and moral sup-
 port for violent revolution in
 Latin America has continued
 unchecked since Ernesto
 (Che) Guevara died in Bolivia
 nearly seven months ago.
 This  is  the  conclusion
 drawn from Increasing re-
 ports - of  revived guerrilla
 activity In the region. The
 general situation Is no worse
 than It was at the time of
 Guevara's death last October.
 But neither is it substantially
 improved,' although no Latin
 government' is In danger of a
 guerrilla takeover.
 Even In Bolivia 'the guerril-
 la movement survived Gue-
 vara. Survivors of his band
 eluded pursuing troops for
 more than four months be-
 fore  passing  Into  Chile,
 where  they  were granted
 asylum and deported.
 One member of the band. a
 Bolivian named "Inti" Pere-
 do, was thought to have re-
 mained In the country, And
 this week Bolivian author-
 ities were investigating re-
 ports Peredo had formed a
 new group of guerrillas and
 was operating in the north-
 eastern province of Beni on
 the border with Brazil.
 Substantial caches of
 arms, supplies and possibly
 money are thought to have
 been  left  in  southeastern
 Bolivia where Guevara oper-
 ated. Peredo, a veteran of
 Guevara's campaign, presu.
 mnhly would know the loca.
 tion or most of the caches.
 In the period since Gue-
 vara's death, the most seri-
 ous threat to stability from
 Communist  guerrillas  has
 continued to exist in Guate-
 mala.
 Reports  from Guatemala
 Indicate control of the guer-
 rilla movement has passed
 from Cesar Monies, basically
 a theoretician, to Marco An-
 `Intl' Peredo
 ... guerrilla leader?
 A rural guerrilla movement
 has moved largely into the
 cities and has triggered right-
 wing counter-terrorism. Two
 U.S. military attaches were
 murdered in January, and the
 archbishop of Guatemala was
 kidnapped by terrorists who
 demanded the resignation of
 President Julio Cesar Mendez
 Montenegro.
 A guerrilla band surfaced
 in the mountains of Yaracuy'
 state  in  Venezuela     last
 month after a long period of
 Inactivity. T h e  gperrillas
 seized two small settlements
 briefly, and then fled In the
 face   of  specially  trained
 army units.
 By last week, the army
 had ' claimed  15  guerrillas
 slain. It said the survivors
 were fleeing to join another
 band operating in the moun-
 tains of neighboring Falcon
 State.
 The guerrillas who seized
 the settlements were report-
 ed under the command of
 Luben Petkoff, and those In
 Falcon State under the com-
 mand of Douglas Bravo. Both
 men are said to have close
 ties with Cuba, and observers
 consider the renewed activity
 is a prelude to an election
 year terrorist campaign In
 Venezuela.
