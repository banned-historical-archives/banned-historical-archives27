 CHRONOLOGY -- COM[  TIST DISSENSIONS
 9 Dec 1964-5 Jan 1965
 December 10:   The IUS Congress in Sofia described in Chronology #43
 closes after adopting a resolution which "contains an erroneous line,"
 according to NCNA, which asserts that only 39 of the delegations with
 voting rights, including the Soviet, voted for the resolution, the
 Chinese and Albanians against it, with the remainder abstaining or not
 taking part. NCNA also claims that "frenzied attacks on China were
 mounted by the Soviet and Indian delegates and a handful of their fol-
 lovers" and that delegates from Nigeria, the Japanese Zengakuren, and
 Canada "vilified China's nuclear testing."  The NCNA round-up con-
 cludes with the following description of the atmosphere during the
 Congru s s :
 "During the meeting, some people resorted to points of
 procedure, interrupted speeches or made trouble when others
 spoke, deprived some delegates of their opportunity to take the
 floor, created obstacles of translation, booed and hooted and
 set the voting machine into motion, thus making normal discus-
 sion impossible at the meeting.  These tricks aroused the indig-
 nation of many delegates who condemned them time and again."
 December 11:  On a visit to Japan, Izvestiya editor Stepakov answers
 several questions about the Khrushchev ouster in an interview with
 Tokyo Asahi foreign news editor Hata.. Adhering to the standard Soviet
 line, he denies that Khrushchev's published works have been withdrawn
 from Soviet bookstores.  Asahi published on 12th:  neither Izvestiya
 nor any other Soviet outlet mentions it.
 December 12:  Pravda front-pages a brief announcement that, "on the
 basis of mutual    snco  ultations carried out between the fraternal parties,
 and for the purpose of thorough preparation for a meeting of the edi-
 torial commission and for an international conference of Communist
 and workers parties, the first meeting of the editorial commission
 has been designated for 1 March 1965."  The European Communist states
 report it without comment on the same day, except for the Rumanians,
 who wait until the following day, and, the Albanians, who ignore it.
 On the eve of the 7th Congress of the old-line, Moscow-aligned
 Ind    CP (ICP/R), Pravda prints a long article by Executive Commit-
 tee member Sardesai who, in addition to discussing the Party's new
 draft program, denounces "the actions of the splitters who left the
 national council of the ICP in April 1964 and who then formed a
 separate party under the name "Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of
 India."  He does not name the CCP but asserts that the splitters
 "would not dare to break completely with the party if they were not'
 instigated to do so from the outside."

 (See December 20-25 for treatment of Indian 7th Congress resolution.)
 December 14:  Italian CP daily L'Unita carries CPI resolution approv-
 ing of postponement of Moscow preparator  commission meeting to 1 March
 15 and adds that the interim period should be used to "create more
 favorable conditions for collaboration between all the CPs and for
 deep study of the problems which face our i-Thole movement."  Indonesian
 CP daily Harian Rakjat publishes a joint statement of the PKI with the
 pro-Chinese dissident Communist Part  of Australia M-L) on 6 December,
 concluding talks with a visiting CPA  M-   delegation led by E.F. Hill.
 Both see K's downfall as "a victory for the constantly expanding M-L
 forces throughout the world" but warn:  "With or without K, modern
 revisionism must be vigorously opposed!" Both hold that a world con-
 ference "can only be justified if it is preceded by adequate prepara-
 tions in which the... parties of all socialist countries participate."
 December 15:  In Djakarta, Indonesian CP Chairman Aidit hands Soviet
 Ambassador Mikhaylov a PKI letter replying to a 1 December. CPSU letter
 inviting the PKI to participate in the 1 March preparatory meeting in
 Moscow:  it says that  the PKI can not and will not attend any inter-
 national conference unless it is preceded by the best preparations and
 unless the Communist and workers parties of all the socialist countries
 will participate in it."  The PKI accepted a Soviet invitation to visit
 the Soviet Union, the date to be determined later, depending on the
 development of the ICM:
 December 16:  Moscow releases the text of a joint communique signed
 by the CPSU with a delegation of the old-line Communist Party of
 Australia on the 14th:  both "expressed themselves in favor of the
 convocation of a new international conference... and of an editorial
 commission, the beginning of whose work is envisaged for 1 March 1995."
 December 16-18:  Yoshichika Tokugawa, a leader of the Japan-Soviet
 Society in Tokyo, told a press conference on the 16th that he, sup-
 ported by 18 other veteran members, planned to break away from the
 society and set u pa new Soviet friendship or   ization by the middle
 of February.  The present society, he said, is 'too dominated by the
 JCP" and could even be called an "anti-Soviet society" because all
 pro-Soviet propositions are stifled by the JCP majority.  He claimed
 that the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo approved his plains.  JCP daily Akahata
 on the 18th printed a statement by the Society's standing director,
 Muraichi Horie, denouncing these "schismatic maneuvers."  The same
 issue also carried a story of clashes between personnel of the (JCP-
 supported) Nauka Bookstore and those of the "renegade-supported Japan-
 Soviet Book Center."
 December 18:  NCNA announces that Radio Peking is beginning to broad-
 cast twice-weekly programs in Esperanto.
 Correspondents report from Bucharest on the enthusiastic reception
 and immediate sell-out of a new Rumanian book, entitled Notes on
 Rumanians,, containing four obscure Marx documents which a leading

 Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.  The "notes" are generally
 anti-Russian, and charge that the Russians use political power to
 enforce economic exDloitati.on.  More   ecifically, they ctaestion the
 legitimac1 of Russia's claim to sovereignty over Bessarabia.  They
 also criticize the Magyaxs' treatment of the Rumanians in 'Transylvania.
 December 20:  East German ADN service reports a communique of the KPD
 West Ge rman CP) approving of the 1 March meeting of the editorial com-
 mission and of the directives for the KPD delegation to the commission.
 December 20-22:  New Delhi and Belgrade Radio report that the 7th Con-
 gress of-the old-line Indian CP in Bombay concluded with a resolution
 which sharply condemned the C inese leadership for splitting and weak-
 ening the ICM.                          (See also Dec.12.)  Tass reporting on the Congress
 (attended by a large Soviet delegation headed by Ponomarev) fails to
 mention any critici3m of the Chinese, and Pravda, publishing on the
 25' =Ehe contents of the documents adopted,  omits the parts which
 directly refer to the CCP.  Pravda does, however, include its de-
 nunciation of the left factionatists as well as all support of CPSU
 positions, including endorsement of an international conference.
 December 21:  The only major article in the ICM on the 85th anniversary
 of Stalin's birth to come to our attention was a 2500-word, unreserved
 tribute in the North Korean Party daily Nodong Sinmun.
 December 21-22:  Chou En-lai's 2-day report to the National People's
 Congress in Peking was a hard-line reaffirmation of CCP anti-revisionist
 policies.  Although he made pro forma reference to China's desire for
 better relations with the USSR, he also referred to the "perfidious"
 withdrawal of Soviet aid in 1960 and to the Soviet role in the i6
 disorders on the Sinkiang border.  His remarks on the "great signifi-
 cance" of Mao's statements on international questions amounted to a
 sweeping claim to Chinese leadership of world revolutionary forces.
 December 26:  The Moscoa?r correspondent of the Belgrade Borba, "analyzing
 numerous speeches ljy soviet leaders anc'_ articles in Soviet Party papers,"
 sees the current Soviet attitude toward problems of the ICM as follows:
 "Avoid activities and open polemics that might deepen the
 present misunderstandings even more; make an effort to suggest
 to Peking, through the position (sic; - posture?) of the CPSU,
 to refrain from anti-Soviet activities so as to produce normal
 conditions for tails on the present disputes; continue the effort
 to call an international consultation of Communist and workers
 parties."
 However, he notes, "the Chinese leadership gives no sign of willing-
 ness to accept this line," and that if they "launch a fresh open
 political battle against the CPSU," it will be "compelled to under-
 take political steps from which it has hitherto... refrained."

 December 28:  Japanese 155~ daily Akahata publishes an article respond-
 ing to a 30 October Trud report by V. I. Prokhorov, Secretary of the
 Soviet Trade Unions Central Council, who had attended a Sohyo con-
 gress in Tokyo last J   , which the JC? considers "an open attack on
 us."  It declares that the whole matter could be "concrete testimony"
 to the fact that the new Soviet leadership is "continuing the subver-
 sive attacks of the K era against the JCP.
 A Kosygin message to Chou En-lai responds to the Chinese 17
 October proposal to world governments, following their first nuclear
 explosion, for an international conference of heads of states on the
 prohibition and destruction of nuclear weapons.  Noting that the pro-
 posal reflects the Soviet line, the USSR accepts and supports it.
 December 2:  Japanese CP daily Akahata reports SecyGen Miyamoto as-
 serting    at a Kyoto rally welcoming an Indonesian CP delegation on
 18 December -- that postponement by the CPSU of the 26-party prepar-
 atory meeting to 1 March 1965 will not change the JCP's previous
 negative attitude:  a new international meeting requires unanimity
 and must include "all the parties of the 13 socialist countries."
 December 20:  A Pravda editorial on the successes of the socialist
 comity, "Confident  tride of Brother Peoples," mentions in turn all
 of the "countries of socialism," including Cuba, -- but omits Albania
 and Yugoslavia:
 January 1:  A London UPI dispatch says that the new issue of World
 Marxist Review   (English edition of Problems of Peace and Socialism)
 carries an article declaring that it would be  folly  to minimize the
 sharp and serious differences between Russia and China and that an
 early international conference is esseptial, even if China refuses to
 gIrticipate.

 Highlights of the Conflicts in World Communism
 May 1963-December 196+
 We summarized the highlights of the Sino-Soviet conflict from its
 earliest manifestations in 1956 through the massive public polemics of
 early 1963 on 22 April 1963, supplementing the first of the biweekly
 "Chronologies" which have since continued to document in detail how
 this conflict intensified and spread throughout the Communist world.
 The end of 1964 is a particularly appropriate point to summarize
 the most important developments of the ensuing 20-month period:  the
 new CPSU leaders, after re-evaluating the'situation in the WCM in the
 wake of the repercussions of the ouster of Nikita Khrushchev -- who had
 precipitated, led, and even symbolized the conflict, have recommitted
 themselves to push preparations for a world party conference to restore
 "unity" (Soviet style), setting 1 March 1965 for the Moscow meeting of
 the 26-party preparatory commission (formerly scheduled for 15 December),
 in the face of probable boycott by the Chinese and their most ardent
 followers.
 The following review is a selective index to the most important
 entries in the 44 numbered installments of our Chronology over this
 period:  comments are brief, and the referenced entries should be con-
 sulted for details.
 May-December 1963
 Our first summary ended by describing a published CPSU-CCP exchange
 of letters:  CPSU dated 21 February proposing a bilateral meeting to
 restore unity; CCP reply dated 9 March counterposing conditions sure to
 be unacceptable to Khrushchev; and a 10,000-word CPSU "reply" which re-
 stated the CPSU's Khrushchevian line as true Marxism-Leninism, fully
 confirmed by "the entire course of world development in recent years,"
 and avoided debate on any of the issues raised by the Chinese on the
 grounds of not aiding the imperialist enemy.
 May 9:  Chinese propose to send delegation to Moscow for bilateral
 talks mid-June:  add that a reply to 30 March CPSU letter would come
 later.  (#L3)
 May 14+:  Chinese announce acceptance of Soviet proposal to begin talks
 5 July:   CPSU announces postponement to 18 June of plenum scheduled
 for 28 May.   (#,4)
 June 1A:  CCP 18,000-word, 25-section "letter" ostensibly replying to
 CPSU 30 March letter.  Published immediately, together with previous
 exchange (Feb 21, March 9, March 30), in 115-page pamphlet under the
 title A Proposal Concerning the General Line of the ICM -- in many
 languages.  Chinese Embassy Moscow tries to distribute Russian-language
 copies to CPSU/CC members on eve of plenum.  This remains the most com-
 prehensive statement of the Chinese line on all points at issue with

 the Soviets, despite subsequent voluminous Chinese polemics expanding
 on various aspects of the conflict.  (#6)
 June 27:  Soviets expel 5 Chinese nationals for distributing June 14
 pamphlets in USSR:  Chinese protest, warning that this is a step towards
 "manufacturing a split in the ICM," and give the 5 a herb's welcome in
 Peking.  (#7)
 June        : Pravda publishes Khrushchev 21 June speech to CPSU plenum, in-
 cluding direct attacks on Chinese leaders.  (#7)
 July   Pravda prints "CPSU/CC statement in connection with forthcoming
 talks   which denounces Chinese "aggravation of polemics" with i4+ June
 letter and announces  decision to reply in the press.  (#7)
 Julys-20:  CPSU-CCP talks held in complete secrecy, with a day of re-
 cess following each day of talks, apparently for the Chinese to confer
 with Peking.  Final communique indicates no agreements reached and de-
 cision to adjourn indefinitely taken on Chinese initiative, with re-

 the conflict suddenly spreads to international power politics with
 Khrushchev's hasty conclusion of negotiations for the nuclear test-ban
 treaty with the U.S. and U.K. (initialed 25 July and signed 5 August).
 A Chinese Govt statement of 31st and a People's Daily editorial of
 2 August denounce  the treaty as a "dirty Traud  and accuse  the Sov-
 Govt of allying itself with the U.S. against China.  The USSR pours
 out a barrage of material capitalizing on its popular "ban-the-bomb
 [tests]" position, most authoritatively in Govt statements on 3 and 21
 August.  A 7500-word CPR Govt statement of 15 August in reply reveals
 that in June 1959 the USSR had unilaterally abrogated an October 1957
 agreement to help Chins produce atomic weapons:  it also concludes bf
 accusing the Soviet leaders of betraying the interests of their own
 people.  Most CPs support treaty (or maintain discreet silence):  only
 the Albanians echo the Chinese denunciation, while the North Korean,
 North Vietnamese, Japanese and Indonesians limit themselves to the line
 that it does not go far enough (i.e., a total ban on nuclear weapons)
 and    criticize US imperialism for perpetrating it.  (#9, #10, & #11)

 but the Chinese insisted on smashing it; that in 1958 the Soviet leaders

 on test-ban treaty also discusses Sino-Soviet border dispute (charges
 more than 5,000 Chinese violations of Soviet border in 1962 alone).
 Surprisingly, it ends with a call to end polemics and hints readiness

 September 26:  Chinese publish joint "Comment (III)":  Is Yugoslavia a

 of revisionism hard on Tito's heels."          There follows the first
 implied appeal to the Soviet Party rank-and-file to oust K.
 Late September and October:  Observers note various indications that
 the CPSU had decided to convene a world conference of CPs to confirm

 The Soviet campaign suddenly grinds to a halt:  at the 7 November
 Soviet Revolution anniversary, not only is the dispute muted but key-

 Soviet media begin to observe a unilateral moratorium.  On 29 November
 ( we ;.earn   half a year later when the Chinese publish the exchange:
 see 8 May 1964), Khrushchev sent a long, conciliatory letter to Mao pro-
 posing a number of "concrete steps for setting things right in Soviet-
 Chinese cooperation."  A major 6 December Pravda editorial on the 3rd
 anniversary of the 81-party conference renews the public bid for an

 bringing it up to date.  Suslov describes, condemns, and rebuts the
 Chinese onslaught which made the counter-offensive necessary and proposes
 a conference of all fraternal parties to overcome difficulties and restore
 unity.
 This time, however, the public reaction among the pro-Soviet parties
 indicates more hesitation and disagreement than whole-hearted support:
 the Hungarians fail to endorse the conference: the Poles hesitate almost
 a week and then decry "excommunication"; the Rumanians maintain silence;
 and the Italians, joined by the Norwegians and Swedes, reiterate their

 Over the coming weeks and months, Soviet media pour out voluminous
 materials supporting their course, ranging from their own statements
 and articles to statements by the most obscure parties in distant lands.
 The first reaction from the Chinese camp comes in a harsh editorial

 Chinese, who on the 27th publish the 3 April Pravda materials with their
 own short but savagely derisive note.  (x'27)

 MaL8:   Chinese publish texts of exchange of letters beginning with 29 Nov.
 1963 Khrush. to, Mao and ending with CCP 7 May.  Letters, obviously not
 intended for publication, at least by the CPSU, provide remarkable in-
 sight into depth and bitterness of conflict.  K's gambit is conciliatory,
 suggests putting aside disputes "until the heat of passion has cooled"
 and proposes "concrete measures" such as expansion of trade, "broadening"
 of technical assistance, settlement of boundary questions, and cessation
 of polemics.  There was no acknowledgement from the Chinese until 20
 February 1964, almost 3 months later, when they sent a brief letter com-
 plaining that the CPSU had, secretly and behind the back of the CCP, sent
 a 12 February letter to other parties which "instigates struggle" against
 the CCP on the pretext that the CCP had not answered the 29 Nov. letter:
 the latter, they said, will be answered in due course.  The CPSU immedi-
 ately replies in a 22 Feb. letter protesting CCP "aggravation" but re-
 maining conciliatory.  On the 27th, the CCP sends a brief but extremely
 arrogant.reply to the latter, and follows on the 29th with a long reply
 to the original 29 Nov. K letter, scorning the Soviet overtures as "an
 utterly false and demagogic trick."  However, it ends by proposing re-
 sumption of CPSU-CCP talks in Peking in October and a preparatory committee
 of 17 parties to meet at an unspecified later date to make preparations
 for a world conference.  The CPSU replies on 7 March) resolutely repudiat-
 ing the CCP's "libelous attacks," questioning the CCP's motives in pro-
 posing such delayed preparations for a world meeting, and counter-
 proposing an accelerated schedule leading to a world meeting in autumn
 1964.  The CCP waits 2 more months to reply:  its taunting 7 May letter
 now says 4 or 5 years or longer may be necessary to prepare for a world
 conference!  (##28-29)

 June-July: Soviet media give increasing evidence that the CPSU is about
 to initiate formal preparations for a world conference, such as articles
 in two successive issues of Kommunist which name 53 and then 69 parties
 as supporting them.  On 15 July they publish a 7,000-word CPSU letter
 sent 15 June in reply to the CCP's 7 May letter, last of the series pub-
 lished by the Chinese on 8 May:   it asserts its right and intent to call
 a conference on its terms.  (#30-33)
 During this period the Rumanians demonstrate their new independence
 by publishing at least 3 polemical attacks on Soviet policies and abruptly
 sending Maurer to Moscow on 6 July in what is seen as another attempt to
 head off Soviet "excommunication" action.(#31-32)
 The Chinese on l4+ July publish "Comment (IX),"  On Khrushchev's Phony

 unless they surrender.  (#33-34)

 By mid-September, the CPSU can still name only 12 parties, less
 than half, as agreed to participate.  The Chinese and 5 allies had de-
 clared or indicated their refusal, while the remainder were apparently
 still reluctant to commit themselves.  (06-39)  Moreover, the Italians
 publicly declare that they will attend to discuss measures for improving
 unity and not to plan a conference which would result in excommunication,
 and it was indicated that some of the other parties close to the CPSU
 were inclining more and more toward this posture.
 September 5:  Italian CP organs publicize a strongly "independentist"
 memorandum composed by Togliatti in Yalta just before his death:  it
 frankly cri.iticizes Soviet plans for a meeting to condemn Peking, re-
 cords pessimistic views  of Communism's international and Italian situa-

 J isahr-s full text on 10th.  (#37)
 September 22:  First number of German-language edition of Peking Review
 appears -- thus making a total of 6 editions (see Jan. 1964 for list).
 October 15:  An era in the history of the WCM ends with the ouster of
 Khrushchev in a secret, poorly explained coup which dumbfounds  even
 those party leaders closest to Moscow.  Many openly express their con-
 cern and at least 5 send delegates to Moscow to seek an explanation.
 On the other hand, the Chinese and their allies welcome it as a victory
 for their line and a defeat for revisionism -- while warning against a
 continuation of "Khrushchevism without Khrushchev."
 The new Soviet leadership, however, soon reaffirms their commitment
 to all basic positions in question, including the necessity for an early
 world conference -- but without mentioning the scheduled 15 December
 preparatory meeting.  In a surprise move, Chou En-lai heads a strong
 Chinese delegation to Moscow for the annual Soviet Revolution celebra--
 tion on 7 November:  however, a week of secret talks with the CPSU
 leaders reportedly are stalemated as neither side showed any inclina-
 tion to yield from its previous positions.  In a 21 November Red Flag
 editorial, "Why Khrushchev Fell," the CCP declares unequivocally that
 the new CPSU leaders can avoid conflict with the CCP only by reversing
 all basic CPSU policy developments of the past 11 years.  (7LI0-l+3)
 December 12:  Just 3 days before the scheduled Moscow meeting of the 26-

 1 March.  Four non-ruling parties publicly affirm approval within a few
 days.  All European Communist states promptly report the invitation
 without comment, except Albania, which remains silent along with the
 Asian Communist states. Thu Indon and Jap,Ci's publicly refuse to attend--
 unless "all socialist countries" participate.  The year ends with both
 protagonists observing a sort of truce -- and the Rumanians making another
 independence gesture by publishing a book of little-known Marx documents,

 861               MILITARY FORCES IN THE WORLD TODAY
 25X1 C10c
 SITUATION:    In mid-November 1964, the Institute for Str=ategic Studies,
 18 Adam Street, London, WC2,, issued the sixth in its series of annual esti-
 mates of the size and breakdown of the major military forces of the world:
 The Military Balance, 1964-65.  In a field where there is little authori-
 tative information published, this booklet stands out as an excellent source
 of data.  Some other publications also contain information, among them Jane's
 All the World's Ships and All the World's Aircraft, and the official publi-
 cations of parliamentary governments provide data on their own national
 forces.  The Military Balance, however, is probably the best available un-
 classified source, particularly as regards the strength of the forces of
 Communist countries.
 (FYI only:  Figures on the Soviet forces given in The Military Balance
 are slightly on the high side, as compared with the latest classified US
 intelligence estimates.  Thus, current official estimates of total Soviet
 personnel, strength are 2.8 to 2.9 million and not 3.3 million; Soviet di-
 visions are believed to nun ber between 120 and 140, and not simply 140;
 tactical aircraft are thought to add up to 3250 and not 4000.  The higher
 figures are more useful. for most propaganda purposes, however, than the
 official figures would be--if the official figures could be used, which
 they cannot be.  End FYI.)
 The following are some aspects of The Military Balance's figures which
 are relevant to current political and diplomatic problems:
 1.  The Soviet strength in operational ICBM's is estimated at about
 200, although The Milit~ar  Balance states that this figure may in-
 crease substantially in.. 1965; US strength in this type of weapon (late
 19611.) came to over 800, Moreover, only one-third of the Soviet ICBM's
 are storable liquid fuel missiles (an advance over Soviet liquid fuel
 missiles which must be drained if they are not fired, and which re-
 quire a fueling up period before they can be fired) and none are known
 to be solid fuel. missiles; the chief protection of Soviet missiles con-
 sists of concealment and active defense.  On the other hand, three-
 quarters of US ICBM's are solid fuel (ready for instantaneous use)
 Minutemen, protected in "hardened" underground silos.  By his aggres.
 sive behavior,, especially in the 1901 Berlin crisis, Khrushchev pro-
 voked the US into a rapid ICBM buildup.  The result showed that the
 Soviet economy was still far from a match for that of the US; while

 the USSR will have twice as many ICBM's in early 1965 as a year
 earlier, the US will retain a four-to-one lead by increasing its
 ICBM's from 475 to 925.  This lesson in the inferiority of Soviet
 power helps to explain the waverings of Soviet economic policy
 over the past two years, and presumably contributed also to the
 fall of K .rushc a v .
 2.  While the Soviet defense budget was reduced by 600 million
 rubles in 1961 (subsequent to the publication of The Military BalBal-
 ance  Kosygin has announced that a further 500 million ruble re
 duction willbe made in 1965). Soviet defense budget figiLres "do
 not include space research costs or the development of advanced
 weapons systems...  It is thought that in real terms total Soviet
 military expenditure represents something between 30 and 35 thou-
 sand million dollars a year.    (Emphasis supplied) This would consti-
 tute a  ilitaryexpenditure of over 30 per cent of the Soviet budget.
 (Or e might think this small compared with the 55 per cent of US fed-
 eral expenditure which goes to US defense; such comparisons would
 be misleading, since the non-defense part of the Soviet budget in-
 cludes elements of the national economy, e.g., investment, which
 have no counterpart in the US budget?)  This represents a tremen-
 dous burden for a country which is still lagging behind in the pro-
 duction of food and other consumer goods.
 3.  Equally serious is the burden of arms expenditures on certain
 developing countries.  In comparison with earlier estimates, Indo-
 nesian defense expenditures may have more than doubled to almost
 1 billion dollars per annum.  As a result, Malaysia must spend 4.1
 per cent of its national income on defense costs, as compared with
 1,9 per cent for the Philippines.  Israeli-Arab rivalries result
 in Israel and the UAR spending respectively 9 and 8.2 per cent of
 their national incomes on military forcese   In general, the military
 burden of non-aligned nations tends to be somewhat higher than that
 of the smaller West European countries.  Any comparison should take
 into account the ability of different national economies to support
 unproductive expenses; Indonesia, for example, has a large popula-
 tion and an abundance of certain resources, but _?- since much of
 these natural riche; is still inadequately utilized -- it is not a
 wealthy country, and the extravagance of its government has put the
 Indonesian economy in dire jeopardy.  Also, when the percentages of
 budgets devoted to defense are compared, distinctions should be made
 between budgets which contain large amounts for state investment
 (see also para. 2 above) and those which do not, also between fed-
 eral budgets (where non-defense costs are largely a local or state
 concern) and the budgets of centralized countries.
 4.  While the US is preponderant in ICBM's, to which should be
 added 1100 strategic bombers and 656 submarine-carried Polaris mis-
 siles, there is no US or NATO force corresponding to the 700-750

 Soviet MRBM?s, largely targetted against Western Europe.  This fact
 tends to cause some concern in European circles, especially in West
 Germany, and it was partly to meet this feeling that the US pro-
 posed the Multilateral Force (M12) concept.  If the Soviets do not
 like'the MIF idea, they should consider what they have done to pro.-
 yoke it.  And if Europe is not sufficiently concerned to agree to
 some form of MLF, then it is not the-intent of the US--which is
 amply defended., and which in any case intends to defend Europe--to
 impose the MLF concept on unwilling allies.
 5.  If some smaller European countries have low defense budgets,
 one major reason is the disproportionate share of Free World arms
 expenditures borne by the US.  While-the other NATO countries are
 now beginning to make more of an effort, slightly relieving the US,
 Americ&n defense expenditure in 1963. was 9.8 per cent of the gross
 national. product; among the NATO countries, the UK came next with
 7.2 per cent, followed by Portugal at 6.8 per cent, by France at
 6.4 per cent, and by Germany at 6.1 per cent.  Of the other NATO
 countries., only Turkey spent over 5 per cent of its GNP (5.9 per
 cent) on defense.  The US does not simply say it will defend Europe
 or its Far Eastern allies; it shows it will do so by paying the
 heavy bills.
 The Military Balance contains an abundance of other useful informa-
 tion, such as on the breakdown of forces and principal arms and ships of
 various nations.  The handbook states that the Chicom nuclear explosion
 of October 196+ shows that Chinese nuclear technology is more advanced
 than had been supposed.  But it is thought that the Chinese will not
 have any advanced indigenous capability in delivery systems in the fore-
 seeable future.  Meanwhile, the Chinese amy suffers from inadequate
 logistic support and obsolescent equipment; China is the only country
 which is "totally deprived of access to the sophisticated equipment and
 expertise which the world's leading military nations continue to make
 available to  . host of lesser countries."                                 25X1 C10b

 CHINA, INDIA, JAPAN
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  For years, the People's Republic of China (CPR) and the
 Soviet Union boasted of their communist economic system as the wave of the
 future.  The CPR, and to an even greater extent the Soviet Union, drama-
 tized huge programs, projects and plans, publicized tremendous raw figures
 of production and cultivated acreage attendant on their large territories
 and populations, and in addition, distorted their substantial economic
 advances to make them appear greater than they were.
 What they did not talk about was the cost of production (human and
 material) which would have exposed startling inefficiencies, and the
 failure to meet quotas and achieve plans -- keeping the spotlight rather
 on ever larger plans for the future, repeating mammoth figures of previous
 plans and ignoring the fact that they had not always been achieved.  And
 what they did not divulge, until forced (by their own rising difficulties)
 was the padding, distortion and falsification of production figures (the
 extent of which was not known for some time even to their highest authori-
 ties).  It was no accident that for years Westerners had no opportunity
 to examine Communist economic statistics in detail, particularly agri-
 cultural (granted that these statistics were not too adequate even for
 their own officials).
 Only by the end of 1963, in spite of previous critical failures (e.g.
 CPR communes and backyard furnaces in the late 1950's, the shutdown of
 numerous factories on the heels of departing Soviet technicians about
 1959; Soviet collectivization in the 1930's and the Virgin lands in the
 late 1950's) was it possible to demonstrate the falsity of Communist eco-
 nomic growth claims and to puncture the inflated image of sustained spec-
 tacular economic performance.  Authoritative analyses of Communist eco-
 nomic data accumulated over a span of years and released in January 1964
 coincided with public exposure of the crisis in the Soviet economy, brought
 on by successive years of failure after 1958, and the collapse of the
 Chicom economy.
 Analyses of Communist economic performance have usually compared the
 USSR with the US -- largely because Soviet leaders announced their intent
 to meet and surpass US production figures.  This comparison gave Soviet
 propagandists a certain advantage in claiming, among other things to have

 started from an agricultural base (industrialization was underway before
 the revolution of 1917), and to be competing with the world's most eco-
 nomically developed and prosperous country.
 However, for developing countries, the most applicable bases for
 comparison ought to be found outside the U.S. and Western Europe.  For
 this purpose, comparison of the CPR's communist economy with Japan's
 and particularly India's mixed economies is particularly appropriate.
 Japan demonstrates what a developed mixed economy can accomplish as con-
 trasted with a Communist system.  India, on the other hand, starting from
 similar economic conditions, demonstrates a mixed economy in a developing
 country.   [Japanese and Indian economies are not comparable for several
 reasons, namely:  Japan was a sovereign country while India was a depend-
 ent British colony, until 1947; Japan has long had an industrial economy
 while India became independent as a predominantly agricultural country.
 Further, India chose to build a mixed economic system along with democratic
 political institutions, to assure the maintenance of free institutions in
 the long run, rather than to take what some believe to be the shorter road
 to economic development through a state controlled economy in an authori-
 tarian system.)
 Industrial Production in India and Communist China, 1959 - 1963.
 China has fallen behind India in industrial development during the last
 5 years.  When the Soviet Union cut off its aid program to China and with-
 drew its technical advisers, a large portion of the Chinese economy pro-
 grams collapsed.  In 1963 Chinese industrial production was only about
 two-thirds of the level achieved in 1959.  For example, only 8 to 10 mil-
 lion metric tons of crude steel were produced in 1963 compared to 13.4
 million metric tons in 1959, and only 190 to 200 million metric tons of
 coal were produced in 1963 compared to 347.8 million metric tons in 1959.
 Refined petroleum products, which was one of the few industrial commodities
 to show an increase in production, was only 37 percent above the level of
 1959.
 During this period of collapse and stagnation in China, industrial
 production in India increased by about 40 percent.  Between 1959 and 1963,
 the production of crude steel grew by 142 percent, the production of elec-
 tric power grew by 64 percent, and by 1963 the production of refined
 petroleum products in India reached 7.6 million metric tons in contrast
 to only 5.4 million metric tons in China.
 The prospects are that India will continue to develop its industry
 rapidly, whereas China will take many years to regain the level of produc-
 tion achieved in 1959.
 Industrial Production in    an and Communist China, 1959 - 1963.
 Communist China's record contrasts unfavorably also with Japan's indus-
 trial production.  In two commodities (cement and refined petroleum prod-
 ucts), Japan's 1959-1963 production increased at an even greater rate than

 did India's, while the CPR's cement production decreased and its refined
 petroleum products increased only 37% to Japan's 102%.   [Japan's 1963
 cement production was almost 30 million metric tons; the CPR's, only some
 9 million.]  In another two commodities (crude steel and coal), Japanese
 production increased but at a lesser rate than India's, while the CPR's
 decreased in both cases.  [Japan's crude steel production is approximately
 three times greater than the CPR's but the latter still produces sub-
 stantially more coal despite its decrease to some 200 million metric tons
 and Japan's increase to 52 million.]  In the fifth commodity, electric
 power, Japan and India increased their production at an almost identical
 rate (63% and 64% respectively), contrasted with the CPR's decrease to
 only 72% of its 1959 production.  The CPR's 30 billion kilowatt-hours con-
 trasted to Japan's almost 162 billion kilowatt-hours of electric power, is
 more significant when the importance of electric power for a developing
 economy is considered and the size and populations of the two countries 25X1C1O b

 863 FE,f        CHINESE YOUTH LACKS REVOLUTIONARY ZEAL
 25X1ClOb
 SITUATION:  The Chicom leaders have become increasingly alarmed by
 the sag in revolutionary zeal among their young people and have started
 intensive indoctrination to remedy the situation.  This campaign itself
 provides mounting evidence that dissatisfaction among Chinese youths
 has become even more widespread and increasingly serious.  The primary
 causes appear to be the lack of adequate educational opportunities,
 scarce job opportunities, and the discrepancy between the ideals long
 proclaimed by the regime and the bleak realities of the general situ-
 ation facing the young people.
 Lack of Educational Opportunities:  For the fourth consecutive
 year, fewer new students were accepted by universities than were grad-
 uated in June and total university enrollments have fallen steadily
 from 900,000 in the peak academic year of 1960-61 to something less
 than 500,000 in the current year.  This reduction in educational oppor-
 tunities has in turn increased the competition for available jobs.
 China's stagnant economy is unable to absorb the large number of youths
 who enter the job market each year and unemployment continues to rise.
 The large numbers of unemployed youths in the cities cause what the
 Chicom authorities call "social problems," and they have attempted to
 alleviate the situation by sending young people to the countryside and
 remote frontier areas.  The young people are soon dismayed by the poor
 living conditions and the lack of any prospects for improving their
 situation.
 Disillusionment is said to be particularly high among the latest
 graduating class of university students who had been led to believe
 that they were being trained to play a vital role in building a new
 China, but are now unable to find posts of responsibility or positions
 in which they can use their new skills and training.  The new graduates
 were bluntly told that because of "readjustments in the economy," not
 enough jobs existed in their specialities and that graduates who could
 not be placed in appropriate jobs immediately would be assigned to rural
 or frontier areas or to "basic levels" where they would perform appren-
 tice-type work at low rates of pay.
 There is also increasing discontent among the undergraduates who
 resent the heavy doses of political indoctrination as well as their duty
 to spend at least a month each year doing manual labor.  According to a
 student from the Hunan Medical College, only two months were spent in
 genuine class work during the past year and the remainder of the time
 was spent either in political indoctrination meetings or in rural clinics.

 These Chicom indoctrination efforts confirm the alienation of
 Chinese students that became apparent in 1962 when some 15,000 students,
 most of whom had relatives in Hong Kong, left the mainland with permits
 to visit their relatives and almost none of them went back.  There were
 other similar instances of this exodus in 1963, but after that time,
 stricter controls over visitor permits brought an end to such cases.
 Impact of Sino-Soviet Split:  The fact that the Chicom youth indoc-
 trination campaign is still being intensified after nearly two years in-
 dicates that the program to date has had little impact on the 130 million
 Chinese between the ages of 16 and 25.  The current intensification of
 the campaign can also be attributed in part to the Sino-Soviet split, and
 the Chicom view that what has happened in the USSR proves that even an
 old well-established Communist society can be "corrupted" and "subverted"
 by bourgeois attractions.  The indoctrination campaign--through the press,
 radio, speeches, movies, songs, plays, "study groups," etc.--includes at
 least as many warnings against "revisionist influences" as against the
 traditional evil of "bourgeois influence."
 This campaign is not tied directly to the shorter range problem of
 an immediate successor to Mao.  This will be settled in deepest secrecy
 by a small clique of only the highest leaders.  The successors of Mao
 and of other leading officials of his generation--most of whom are now
 in their 60's and 70's--and hence their selection, is deeply affected by
 the problem of dissatisfied Chinese youth.  The aging Chicom leaders
 have only belatedly come to realize that while they can dictate what
 happens to the Chinese people today, they cannot dictate in advance the
 future path and direction of Chinese Communism.  It is entirely in keep-
 ing with their frequently demonstrated arrogance that it should have
 taken them so long to reach this obvious conclusion.  It is also in
 keeping with their long-held, unrealistic dogmatism that t#ey seek to
 solve the problem by an uncompromising adherence to harsh communist
 ideals, by demanding increasing sacrifices from their people without
 offering any real inducements in the form of material improvements or   25X1C10b
 opportunities in the people's lives,

 SITUATION:  The above-cited guidances have'troated in detail how
 badly Czechoslovakia's oboe-flourishing economy has declined under a
 Communist regime.  Moscow's exploitation of Czechoslovakia as a facade
 and financier for Soviet "aid and trade" penetration of emerging areas
 has, of course, been a serious drain on the economy.  However, the main
 culprit is clearly the rigid central planning system that has studiously
 ignored consumer interests and needs, and has produced a vast backlog of
 unwanted, inferior and unsalable products.
 The deterioration in the quality of Czechoslovak goods is reflected
 even in the Czech-Rumanian, trade agreement of 19 October 63, which con-
 tains a pledge that both parties will export only products "on a par with
 the best products available on the world market" -- plainly a warning by

 the Rumanians that they will buy in the West if the Czech product does
 not improve.  Seventeen years after the great experiment in Communist
 economic planning in Czechoslovakia began, even the Czech CP leadership
 has been forced to acknowledge that it has resulted in an almost un-
 qualified failure.
 The debacle in Czechoslovakia is not just another Communist eco-
 nomic failure.  In Czechoslovakia, Communist economic doctrine was put
 to a laboratory test under ideal or nearly ideal conditions:  in 1948 the
 party took over an industrial society with one of the most highly skilled
 labor forces in the world, a plant in generally good condition (virtually
 undamaged by the war), and an unsurpassed reputation for quality products.
 This 6ftde_'.. bithd State, with its tradition of high industrialization and
 mechanical skill, has been brought close to ruin.  "How could we," a prom-
 inent Czech economist recently asked rhetorically, "the most highly in-
 dustrialized nation in Eastern Europe, have taken the Stalinist system
 of highly (cei'itralized, non-specialized planning which sets the same
 broad quantitative norms for all fields of production -- a system devised
 to increase radically the basic, heavy industrial plant of a backward
 nation (Russia) -- how could we have been so stupid as to take such a
 system and impose it lock, stock, and barrel on our economy?  It's incred-
 ible:"
 Bright, New Vistas Pictured.  For the past several months, the Czech-
 oslovak press has carried on an intensive debate over plans for a radical
 overhaul of the entire economic system -- a total assault upon the plan-
 ning and management techniques imposed by Moscow, which have long been
 held to be synonymous with Marxism-Leninism itself.  The author of the
 original proposal for change was Prof. Ota Sik, director of the Economic
 Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and a member of:, the
 Party's Central Committee.  Under the basic proposal, central planning,
 after a period of transition, would be reduced to little more than pre-
 dicting market and production opportunities and choosing among major
 trends of possible development.  The change in course toward "Progressive
 Market Socialism" was approved tentatively by the Party's Presidium in
 October 1964.
 These steps represented an apparently firm intention to put into
 practice the recommendations of some of the country's top economic and
 legal experts, manor of whom appear agreed that traditional Marxist-Leninist
 concepts have been to blame for the wreckage of their national econo   '
 (For example, the volume of industrial production in 1963 fell below the
 poor 1962 level, and labor productivity and national income during 1964 re-
 mained static.  Net agricultural production has shown a downward trend since
 the late 1950s, and President (and Party First Secretary)Novotny announced
 in November 1964 that Czechoslovakia would have to seek abroad for yet an-
 other 2.2 million tons of grain, the harvest having been down by one mil-
 lion tons as a consequence of drought.  He also admitted that none of the
 1964 agricultural goals had been reached except in production of potatoes.)

 Three months before the new draft economic reform plan was tentatively
 approved by the Presidium, the conclusions of a symposium of 35 economic
 authorities appeared in the June and July 1964 issues of 'Pravnik, the
 -journal of the Institute for Government and Law of the Czechoslovak
 Academy of Sciences.
 Of these 35 participants, not one defended traditional Communist
 planning and management methods -- in which economic plan targets are
 arbitrarily assigned to individual enterprises.  The chronic handicaps
 imposed by such a practice were recognized by all, Pravnik said. More-
 over, a leading spokesman for fundamental economic change, Radoslav
 Selucky, reportedly asserted that not one of the Czechoslovak five-year
 plans had survived a period of two or three years in its original form,
 nor was there a single enterprise in Czechoslovakia whose plan had not
 been changed several times in any given year.  Most of the symposium ex-
 perts agreed, Pravnik said, that the continual interference by CP bu-
 reaucrats in the daily operations of enterprises was keeping the economy
 in a state of ineffectiveness and confusion.
 Eugen Loebl, another well-known critic, supported Selucky by point-
 ing out that the system of directed management had been wrong from the
 very beginning, and that it had caused more damage in Czechoslovakia than
 anywhere else in the Soviet Bloc.  Pravnik also reported that the sym-
 posium participants were practically unanimous in favoring a broader ap-
 plication of the laws of supply and demand.  Selucky stated that it was
 possible to combine the classical Communist system of administrative
 planning with one based on the laws of supply and demand. "They are two
 incompatible methods," he said.  Since it was impossible to salvage the
 present centralized Communist economy, he added, the only solution was
 to replace it with a system of management fully based on a free market
 economy.
 Mirage or Reality?  Despite the hopeful words, there is no assurance
 as yet that Prague's new plans will be approved in their original form,
 or if approved without substantial change, that they will bear better
 fruit than the administrative panaceas of the past 17 years.  Whatever
 liberalization the regime may institute in theory, effective control may
 remain in the hands of party bureaucrats who were among the last and most
 reluctant de-Stalinizers in the Bico.  Not until seven years after IC ru-
 shchev's speech to the Twentieth Party Congress did the Prague regime,
 under pressure from its own intellectuals and the Soviets, jettison Karol
 Bacilek, First Secretary of the Slovak CP, and then Premier Viliam Siroky.
 President Novotny, himself the chief Stalinist holdover, while having
 moved in recent months to identify himself with popular pressures for po-
 litical and economic reform, may lose his appetite for drastic economic
 reform when faced with the task of forcing it down the throats of the

 Novotny has been steeped in the tradition that rigid, monolithic
 politico-economic management is the sine qua non of Marxism-Leninism.
 He is, as in the words of Prof.. Sik, one of the "many comrades who look
 with distrust at all unusual non-Stalinist theories" and are "accustomed
 to a single, absolute form of Stalinist society, including its economy
 and management."  (Kulturni Tvorba, 19 Nov 64).  While Novotny has sought
 to identify himself with the economic reform, in his 3 December speech in
 Moscow he took care to emphasize the continued importance of central con-
 trol, promised a strengthening of Party control over the economy, and
 denied that the law of supply and demand would be allowed free play.
 All this could have been for the benefit of his Soviet hosts or it
 might have presaged a watering down of the new economic principles by
 the Central Committee (CC) at this December meeting.  On 18 and 19
 December the enlarged presidium of the CC met to discuss the introduction
 of the new model economy.  This was followed by a meeting of the Economic
 Commission of the CC on 21 December.  Both meetings were apparently sub-
 stitutes for a plenum of the CC itself, which Rude Pravo had announced
 in October would assemble in December to give final approval to the pro-
 posed reform.  (in a year-end report to the nation, Novotny, in an ap-
 parent attempt to satisfy both the party bureaucrats and the economists/
 technocrats, asserted that the proposed reform would not negate past
 principles of management and organization of the economy, while elsewhere
 asserting the need to eradicate conservatism in order to open the door to
 ability, elasticity and skill.)
 The switch in forums suggests that the Prague leadership has either
 run into opposition to the reform, or is divided on how far-reaching it
 should be or both.  If there is opposition, it probably is concentrated
 in the CC itself, where a large number of members and candidate members
 are also economic functionaries notorious both for their incompetence
 and for their close identification with middle level cadres of Stalinist
 leanings.  Certainly there is recognition by all. involved that full im-
 plementation of the proposed economic changes would strongly curtail the
 political power of the Party bureaucracy and greatly enhance the political
 influence of the ablest managers of industry, many of whom are not CP
 members.  The power to determine the actual operations of the nation's
 economy on both a daily and long-range basis would pass out of the hands
 of Party bureaucrats, at least in part.  This could be intolerable to the
 many Party officials and managers who have a vested interest in retaining   25X1C10 b
 the maximum of control for the central authorities.

 Chinese Communist Officials Harangue Youth

 Peoples' Daily editorial of 3 August 1964:
 "The lessons to be drawn from the damage that the modern revisionists

 Fact Sheet
 18 January 1965
 Chechoslovakia's Burden
 During late 1963 and 1964 Czechoslovakia announced multi-million-
 dollar aid and trade agreements with Ghana, Guinea and India, lesser
 activities in Angola, Burma, Cambodia, Mali and. Zanzibar, and there were
 even reports of an arms deal with Haiti.  Czech penetration has been
 heavy in Latin America, where the CSSR has full diplomatic relations
 with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Uruguay; a consulate
 general in Colombia; and trade representation in Chile and Venezuela.
 In 1964 the Czechs are believed to have had more personnel in Latin
 America than the Soviet Union and other Satellites combined; the demon-
 strable Czech2er capita contribution to political activities abroad was
 more than twice that of the Soviet Union.  Paralleling widespread com-
 plaints of shoddy Czechoslovak exports there have been public exposures
 of Czech-directed espionage and subversion in West Germany,  Switzerland,
 Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and even Iceland. Following the Communist
 subversion of Cuba, the Czechs in Latin America needed no longer go to
 Prague for personnel, supplies and directives.  The Latin American of-
 fensive could be run directly from their major base in Cuba, where the
 Czechs built up to an estimated 4,000 personnel.  Many Czechs have been
 grumbling because they feel that the more than $430 million that Prague
 has poured down the Cuban drain could have been better utilized to boost
 their own faltering economy.
 The Czechoslovakian people have carried the burden of economic pene-
 tration ordered by Communist leaders.  Free countries which Soviet of-
 ficials have singled out for subverting and influencing are indicated in
 the stories carried in Czechoslovak media September-December 1964, as
 follows:
 Technicky Tyd.enik,, Prague, 16 Sept 64:
 he 'Kovo' Foreign Trade Enterprise constructed in Mali at the beginning
 of 1964, two large transmission centers.  Now there have been put into
 operation additional Tesla SRV 30 transmitters."

 'K. Rucka, a representative of the Czechoslovak Embassy in Dar es Salaam,
 presented a gift of a hundred tons of sugar from the Czechoslovak Govern-
 ment and people to the inhabitants of Zanzibar on 10 Oct 64.  The island
 had rid itself of a pro-British regime in January of this year."
 Handelsblatt, Duesseldorf, 22 Sept 64:
 Ups 1967, over 1,000 Czechoslovak experts and specialists will be
 sent to India to work on the planning and assembly of industrial enter-
 prises which India is constructing in cooperation with Czechoslovakia."
