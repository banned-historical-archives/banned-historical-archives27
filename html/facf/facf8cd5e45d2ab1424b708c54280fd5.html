 America's Voice,Changin .  The Voice of America inaugurated in early
 ~~XYY YI  NiY 1 I fl.
 November a "new.sound" on its Worldwide cnglish Service which may spread
 eventually to its other 37 language services.  VOA replaced its tradi-
 tional program schedule with a continuo u4 flow of music,; news and fea-
 tures in two-hour blocks, interspersed with one-hour segments devoted to
 popular holdover programs.  Even the old theme, "Columbia, the Gem of
 the Ocean"  was scuttled in favor of "Yankee Doodle", "a good revolu-
 tionary song" as VOA Director John Chancellor put it.  The new program-
 ming approach, somewhat similar to NBC's.rado "Monitor" and television
 "Today", uses a vocabulary of just 1200_ words, and is designed as a bet-
 ter means of communication, particularly, with listeners who know English
 only as a second language.
 VOA's English Service accounts for about one quarter of its total
 weekly transmissions of 909 hours.  By comparison, the USSR's interna=
 tional broadcasts ,total  1381 hours weekly; Communist China's,  1105; the
 United Arab Republic's, 827; the Federal Republic of Germany's 689; and
 the BBC's, 663.

 Ivan Lavrenov, chief politica'l offi-
 cer ofSoviet Strategic Rocket Forces,
 had died asudden..y at the age of 54
 (PRESS COMMENT, 8 December 1966).
 Ear7,Mier  on 12 November, the TIMES
 had ; ubhshed an AP report' (date-
 lined lO November) saying that the
 4    6               1T

 for the second time in six ices,,, the
 Soviets had launched. a ppAge.c aft
 which had shattered ifn;~o many darts
 (PRESS COMMENT, 15 November).   This
 second unsuc,oessful space shot had
 been launched on 2 November, it was
 finally established that it had broken
 into more than 40 parts..   These two
 space shots were the first'since
 January 1963 to reach orbit and yet
 not be acknowledged by 'the Soviets.
 Twenty months have now elapsed
 since the last Soviet manp
 Patel
 lite, Voskhod 2  circled the earth
 on 18 March 1965.  Furt~ier'mr~ned
 space activities may of course take
 place at any time, and Soviet space
 scientists have hinted, ,that ar)? event
 could be expected in early 1967.   But
 the failures reported above and the
 lapse of time since the last publi-
 cized cosmonaut trip give a good
 basis for speculation, and doubt about
 the Soviet space program.   One approach
 might be to ask if the two exploded
 frfIu
 space craft-(14 September and
 2 November) were not manned craft,
 which cost the lives of their pilots,
 and which the Soviets have never
 ac)nowledged.  Another might be to
 ask whether General Lavrenov was
 not the victim of some launching-
 pad accident, as was Chief Marshal
 of the Artillery Nedelin, who was
 killed in October 1960 during the
 launching of a new long-range mis-
 s,il,e, and whose death was officially
 ascribed to an airplane accident.
 (The episode is described in the
 PENKOVSKY PAPERS.)  A new Soviet
 manned space event, if it does
 occur, would provide an additional
 peg for such speculation and comment.
 _  In any speculative discussion
 on this subject, emphasize that the
 Soviets do not announce space
 events before they_occur, and only
 say what they wish to have known
 about them then.   We have a ready
 answer to those who say we shouldn't
 shed doubts.on the..mighty Soviet
 space program:   if they don't let
 anyone find out anything, they will
 have to expect to have doubts arise.

 refugees from Castro's Communism
 to the United States.  An equal
 number is expected for the coming
 year. As impressive as the figures
 may be, they are small in compari-
 son with the hundreds of thousands
 of Cubans who have signed up to
 leave. Cubans in the States have
 submitted the names of over a mil-
 lion persons in Cuba whom they
 believe would leave the country,
 given the opportunity.
 What more eloquent testimony
 could there be to the failure of
 Communism in Cuba?
 As mentioned in Biweekly Propa-
 ganda Guidance 964, "Cuban Exodus
 is Symbol of Regime's Bankruptcy,"
 22 November 1965, the refugees from
 Cuba represent a cross section of
 the Cuban society.  Among those
 arriving in Miami are farmers,
 skilled and unskilled laborers,
 and teachers.  The only notable
 variation from a true cross section
 has been that a larger than normal
 percentage has consisted of students,
 mothers and children; obviously the
 Cuban worker has sent his family
 out first for their own protection,
 hoping to join them later when he
 can.

 "Flagrant Vio-  On 28 November 1966
 Zations of UN   the Council of the
 Principles      Organization of
 American States (OAS)
 adopted a report prepared by a Special
 Committee (known as Lavalle Committee,
 for its chairman) assigned to study
 the activities of the Afro-Asian-
 Latin American Peoples' Solidarity
 Conference held in Havana in January
 1966.  The lengthy report (175 pp. in
 its English version) is being dis-
 tributed by the OAS to all members
 of the UN.   Copies are also being
 widely distributed to United States
 posts abroad by the Department of
 State (Circular Airgram to all posts
 #4254 of 5 December 1966.)
 The report is a complete study
 of the proceedings of the Tri-
 Continental Conference and of the
 organizations which grew in its
 wake, such as the Committee on Viet-
 nam, the Liberation Committee, the
 Latin American Solidarity Organization,
 the Latin American Students' Congress
 and Organization, etc.   It emphasizes
 that these organizations constitute a
 permanent apparatus to foment subver-
 sion throughout the world.
 Among its recommendations the
 Special Committee urged all member
 states of the OAS to maintain careful
 vigilance over the activities of
 AALAPSO, and to renew their efforts
 to secure the cooperation of friendly
 countries in the suspension of trade
 and of sea transportation with Cuba.
 This is a very strong, forthright
 report which will. be useful for propa-
 ganda purposes over a long period of
 time.   Stations in the countries
 involved in the GAS or AALAPSO should
 arrange for propaganda assets to
 obtain copies of the report through
 the local government, through the
 local U.S. Embassy, or by request to
 Headquarters.

 1088.             RE-STALINZATION, OVERT AND DISGUISED
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   The Brezhnev-Kosygin regime is accelerating its efforts
 to portray Stalin more favorably.   Moreover, it is succeeding in doing so
 without attracting the kind of attention which the Free World has paid
 to important political developments in the past and without as yet arous-
 ing such overt internal opposition as cropped up earlier in 1966 when
 leading intellectuals objected to the Stalin-like handling of the Sinyavsky-
 Daniel case in February and to the rumored move by Brezhnev to rehabili-
 tate Stalin at the 23rd Congress of the CPSU.   Some recent developments
 such as the postponement of the All-Union Writers' Congress, snags in
 effecting economic reform, and the suspected intrusion of the RIS in
 foreign affairs appear to reflect a form of Stalinism.  Nevertheless,
 re-Stalinization in any degree should cause concern to everyone who wish-
 fully thought that Stalin's influence was practically eliminated by
 Khrushchev's campaign of 1956-64.
 In 1965 and early 1966 discussions in the Soviet press sanctioned
 the basic policies and decisions of Stalinism in the centralization of
 economic controls, priority for heavy industry at the expense of consumer
 welfare, collectivization of agriculture, and restrictions of cultural
 freedom; but not until November and December 1966 did the press provide
 abundant evidence that Stalin's image is being recast.   Favorable comments
 have appeared in almost all the major Soviet newspapers, in sharp con-
 trast to the negligible treatment of Stalin during the past 2 years and
 in even sharper contrast to the criticism of him under Khrushchev.
 Stalin is praised for his revolutionary activities; he is given a share
 of the credit for military victories and excused from some of his mis-
 takes in World War II; some of the black marks against Stalin in the
 1930's have been partially erased; implicitly, he is depicted as not so
 bad and even as considerate.   The appearance of these articles confirms
 the trend towards a retreat from Khrushchev's anti-Stalin campaign,
 which has been detected in the press since at least March 1965.   (See
 BPG Item 1049, "Stalin's Unruly Ghost"; also unclassified attachment
 for survey of recent press coverage of this subject).
 Indirect reminders of Stalin are seen in other recent developments.
 A slowdown in economic reform (reform, in effect, of Stalin's model) has
 been suspected during almost all of 1966 and was confirmed by the tem-
 porary halt of the transfer of factories to the "new system" as announce-
 in the ECONOMIC GAZETTE in issue #35, 1966.   In another possible reflec-
 tion of the effect of this slowdown, the ratification of the Five-Year

 Plan is already months overdue and will probably not be accomplished
 until well into 1967 because of significant revisions in the plan.
 In the realm of ideology there are signs of Stalin-like arbitrari-
 ness.   Most notable is the probable further postponement of the oft-
 postponed and long-overdue All-Union Congress of the Writers' Union.
 This Congress, according to PRAVDA of 19 Sept. 66, was scheduled for
 sometime before the end of this year.   Its postponement; suggests that
 the regime is unwilling to risk unpleasant incidents, especially writers'
 protests against the punishment of Sinyavsky and Daniel.  Another ideo-
 logical development is the Soviet leaders' renewed efforts to inculcate
 youth with unquestioning obedience in the Stalinist manner.
 The recent arrest of U.S. citizen Valdimir Komarek-Kazan in Czecho-
 slovakia is clearly indicated to be the work of the RIS.                       This flagrant
 abuse of the rights of Komarek-Kazar_ was committed at a time when Czech
 relations with the U.S. and the West in general were showing signs of
 improving markedly.   Such abusive behavior during periods of improving
 relations has been observed in the past (see attachment) and it may well be
 more than gumshoe clumsiness.   There appears to be a clear affinity
 between such behavior and the Stalinist tendency to guard against good
 relations with the West.
 The significance of the changed treatment of Stalin is difficult to
 assess.   However, it is reasonable to consider some possible explana-
 tions.   For instance, the leaders may believe it necessary to correct
 their youth's "misunderstandings" about the Stalin era and thereby try
 to reduce the current widespread apathy.  Another plausible explanation
 is that there is an unpublicized factional dispute in which some leaders
 are using Stalinism in their own behalf against others.   One factor may
 be that, since the 50th anniversary of the Soviet regime is coming up,
 it cannot escape notice that 30 of the 50 years were years of Stalin; the
 Soviet regime is afraid to repudiate such a large part of its past, and
 has decided instead to try to refurnish its Stalinist history.   Whatever
 the explanation, any further moves to reinterpret Stalin's past can only   25X1C10 b
 cause Soviet citizens to be concerned for their own future.

 Chile:  Frei's Reforms and Castro's Attacks
 The second anniversary of the inauguration of the Eduardo Frei
 administration in Chile was observed on 3 November 1966.  It is not
 difficult to recall the concern with which the 1964 elections were
 viewed at the time:  "The most important election in contemporary
 Latin American history," one newspaper titled the story.  The crucial
 factor in the election was that Frei confronted the candidate of a
 Communist-Socialist united front, Salvador Allende.  Had Allende won,
 it would have been the first time in history that a united front in
 which the Communists were the dominant element came to national power
 through free, democratic elections.  However, on 4 September 1964
 the Chilean people gave Frei 56%o of the vote, Allende 391, and a
 third cand.5.date 5%.  This was the first time in 50 years that a Chilean
 presidential candidate had received such a large majority of the popu-
 lar vote.   In the preceding three elections no candidate had received
 the required 50% and Congress had had to choose between the top two.
 It was also the first election victory in Latin America for the Chris-
 tian Democrats.
 The central issue on which Frei had based his electoral campaign
 had been his promise to carry out a "Revolution in Liberty" -- an
 economic-social transformation of the country.  Two of the constitu-
 tional six years of Frei's presidency have now passed and it is
 possible to take stock of the direction and progress of his adminis-
 tration.
 On the domestic front, a beginning has been made in tackling the
 major economic problems facing the country.  Essentially what Frei
 promised during the election campaign was economic growth more rapid
 than attained under the preceding administrations; within this a.trlos-
 phere of growth, a redistribution of income in favor of poorer ele-
 ments of the population; a major program of agrarian reform, conceived
 primarily in terms of social equity, but also to bring about increasing
 agricultural production; a major reform of the educational system to
 provide greater social and economic mobility and to foster national
 growth by means of a better prepared population; and a major housing
 program to provide greater social equity and to stimulate economic
 growth.
 Gross national product has grown at the rate of 5.5% per annum
 or better during 1965 and 1966, in contrast to rates of 1.41 and 4.0%
 during 1963 and 1964.  As a necessary condition to self-sustaining
 growth, a principal economic objective has been to create an atmos-
 phere of financial stability in which price inflation can be brought
 under control and gradually eliminated.  This task is formidable in
 Chile where the cost of living has increased at an average rate of

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070005-7
 33 per cent per year since 1950.  The Frei administration started a
 broad program of financial reforms designed to reduce the rate of
 inflation from the 38% registered in 1964 to 25% in 1965, 15% in
 1966, 10% in 1967 and below 10% in 1968.  The target for 1965 was
 barely missed:  the year end data shoved an increase of 25.9%.  Un-
 fortunately, 1966 was less successful and the rate is now estimated at
 about 25%, well above the planned. 15%. Since the poor, the illiterate,,
 the unskilled and the unemployed suffer most from chronic inflation,
 reducing the rate is a direct gain for them, and there has been a
 rise in well being for the majority of the population and some redis-
 tribution of income in favor of the lower classes and an improvement
 in their living standards.
 The Chilean government has made substantial improvements in the
 tax structure and particularly in the administration of tax collec-
 tions which produced an increase in real terms of 24% in 1965 over
 1964 and is continuing at a similar rate of increase for 1966.  Sub-
 stantial progress has been made in tackling the shortcomings in edu-
 cation in the form of new school construction,  teacher training, and
 increased enrollment.  Frei's program for the "Chileanization" of the
 copper industry has passed through the legislature and the conclusion
 of final accords with the major producing companies in the very near
 future will result in the beginning of a five-year, half-billion
 dollar investment in this industry.  Only a modest start has been made
 in the major program of agrarian reforms; a law has been drafted and
 submitted to Congress where it is still tied up in bitter debate.
 Indeed, many of Frei's programs have been delayed by the Congress.
 While the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) enjoys an overwhelming
 majority of 82 out of 147 in the Chamber of Deputies, it is plagued
 by its minority representation of only 13 out of 45 in the Senate.
 In the field of foreign affairs, the Frei government has essen-
 tially followed the traditional, and basic, Chilean foreign policies.
 However Frei has given them a new flair characterized by greater inter-
 national-mindedness, awareness of his responsibility as Latin America's
 Christian Democratic leader, and a determination to be more influ-
 ential in world councils for the cause of peace.  In the first days
 of the government, great stress was laid on the independence of Chile's
 foreign policies, usually emphasizing rather than minimizing differ-
 ences with the United States.  This, however, has gradually toned
 down in pragmatic recognition of the real and large community of interest
 between the two countries.  The Chilean government has tended to re-
 gard the Cold War in terms of a great power struggle between the U.S.
 and the Communist Bloc.  In an effort to extricate itself from this
 conflict and to pursue a "third course," Chile has established or
 renewed diplomatic relations with the USSR and five Soviet bloc states
 of Eastern Europe and looks to expanded trade, aid, and cultural
 relations with these countries.  However, the Frei government clearly
 considers itself a "Western nation" and its "third course" is not one
 of neutralism  a la Egypt.

 In Latin America, the Frei government has strongly pushed for an
 expanded Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA) and for even-
 tual merger of the LAFTA with the Central American Common Market.
 President Frei has taken a strong personal lead in these issues, and
 has worked particularly closely with President Lleras of Colombia in
 backing economic integration in Latin America.
 Chile's relations with Cuba have greatly altered during the two
 years of Frei's administration.  At first the government advocated
 "peaceful coexistence" with Cuba in the rather fuzzy belief that
 Communism in Cuba would soon collapse of its own weight if left alone
 and that actively opposing Castro only served to bolster his position
 in that country.  It soon became evident that this argument was un-
 tenable, however, and the Chileans thereafter turned to hopes that
 Cuba would return to the inter-American system and that relations
 could be normalized whenever Castro's government met its obligations
 to respect human rights and to stop intervening in the affairs of its
 neighbors.
 However the declaration of guerrilla war against virtually all
 Latin American governments which issued from  the Tri-Continental
 Conference at Havana in January 1966 led Chile to join with the other
 Latin American states in denouncing the Conference and its advocacy
 of intervention and insurgency in a protest to the United Nations.
 This resulted in a bitter and vitriolic personal attack on 13 March
 1966 by Castro against President Frei, calling him a "liar" and
 "reactionary."  The attack was triggered off by President Frei's com-
 plaint on March 11 that the Tri-Continental Conference was partly to
 blame for strikes and disturbances in Chilean copper mines, particu-
 larly at the El Salvador mine where eight people were killed in a
 clash between striking miners and soldiers.  Frei claimed that the
 conference had inspired the Chilean Communist and Socialist Parties
 to stir up trouble in the mining areas in order to disrupt government
 plans for reform and so discredit claims that change could come about
 in Latin America under a democratic regime.
 In his speech to university students on 13 March, Castro called
 President Frei "a coward who abuses power and hurls troops against the
 workers," a "vulgar politician who tried to justify his bloody action
 by blaming the Tri-Continental Conference."  Castro openly raised the
 specter of armed struggle in Chile:  Cuban leaders, he said, believed
 that "in the long run" opponents of imperialism, the oligarchies and
 the bourgeoisie would take the road of "armed struggle" and sooner or
 later the Chilean workers would be convinced of its necessity.  To
 help the process along, Havana Radio instituted, at the end of March
 1966, a new daily program "designed especially for the people of Chile,"
 called "The People's Revolution versus Bourgeois Reformism."  Pro-
 duced by Chileans living in Cuba, the program provides a steady flow
 of calumny against President Frei.

 In recent months Frei seems to have become Castro's pet hate and
 the latter seldom makes a major speech without vilifying the Chilean
 Presidant.  In a speech delivered on 26 July 1966 Castro labelled
 Frei as a "spoiled child of the imperialists" and head of a "pro -
 imperialkt government" who "seeks to cover himself with the figleaf of
 a false liberty." "It is our duty to warn the socialist countries
 against Frei's hypocrisy, against Frei's flirting, because the prosti-
 tute will not turn virtuous just because come of her flirtation re-
 ceives attention."
 Castro devoted almost an hour of a marathon four and a half hour
 speech on 29 August 1966 to the Cuban Workers' organization to an
 attack on Frei, challenging him to compare grogress in Cuba with
 progress in Chile.  According to Castro, Frei "was elected as the
 result of a campaign of slanders...He terrrorized the people.  He was
 elected with an overwhelming avalanche of Yankee and West German finan-
 cial contributions.  He has done absolutely nothing and he will do
 absolutely nothing...That man will go down in history without glory
 and without honor... Frei will help the Chilean revolution the same way
 Batista helped the Cuban revolution... We said that we did not want to
 take up this matter with that failure, that coward, that thwarted man...
 Right now there is a scandal in Chile; Frei's government is a failure.
 It is compromised to imperialism.  It is a tool of the counterrevolu-
 tion...Frei is a revolutionary just as Louis XVI was in France."
 Castro's attacks have caused increasing difficulties for Chile's
 extreme left, which  has long been dominated by the FRAP (Popular
 Action Front), the united front of the Communist (PCCh) and Socialist
 (PS) parties.  The PCCh has always been a relatively moderate Communist
 party and a long-time advocate of the peaceful road to power and its
 allegiance has been entirely to Moscow in the Sino-Soviet dispute.  In
 keeping with the friendly Soviet-Chilean diplomatic relations, the
 PCCh has supported the Frei administration on selected issues and has
 eschewed all calls to violent revolution, including those emanating
 from  Havana.   The Socialists who have traditionally been more
 radical than the PCCh, on the other hand, appear increasingly to
 despair of attaining power by democratic means, oppose Frei on every
 issue, and have become increasingly stronger advocates of revolutionary
 violence.  Castro has directly and indirectly attacked the PCCh for
 its lack of revolutionary elan.  In the 26 July speech Castro had
 labeled the Chilean Communists as "pseudo-revolutionaries" for allegedly
 favoring Soviet economic aid to the Frei regime.  Radio Havana, on
 3 September, featured a thinly veiled attack on the Chilean Communists,
 railing against "leftist leaders who have lost their revolutionary
 ardor."  Leaders of this sort, it said, "have stopped 'rein  revolutionaries
 but since they have not gone over to the enemy, and since they remain
 in their old organizations and speak  a Marxist language, it is neces-
 sary to classify them in some way.                          The title of pseudo-revolutionaries
 seems to fit them very well."

 In contrast, Castro has gone out of his way to praise the Chilean
 Socialist Party.  A Castro letter to the PS Secretary General, dated
 7 August, heaped praise on the Socialist Party four its "courageous,
 clear, and without any hesitation, internationalist and revolutionary
 attitude" toward Cu'ba."
 These divergent positions within the FRAP have led to increasing
 rumors of splits within that coalition, but so far they are only rumors.

 Following are excerpts from a
 Malaysian Government White Paper entitled:
 THE MILITANT COMMUNIST
 THREAT TO WEST MALAYSIA
 (Published by the Government of Malaysia, October 1966)
 The purpose of this White Paper is to give the people timely warning
 of a recent and serious development in the security situation in West Ma-
 laysia.   This is the emergence of militant and violent forms of Communist
 United Front activity, directly controlled and coordinated by the Communist
 Party of Malaya from the Malaysian-Thai border.
 It is necessary to state clearly that this development forms a vital
 part of the overall pattern of Communist aggression and subversion in South-
 East Asia, masterminded and directed by Peking.   It does not arise from the
 frustrations of persons who have been denied constitutional or democratic
 processes for the advancement of their political beliefs and aspirations.
 It stems from the Communist Party of Malaya, which has the interests of its
 Peking masters at heart, and is carried out by people whose loyalties are
 not towards the Constitution and who do not care at all for the people of
 this country.
 The White Paper explains clearly the real signficance of campaigns to
 support the Vietcong, and the violence of the propaganda attack against
 American involvement in the Vietnam war.   These have become dominant themes
 in all aspects of the political life of many Communist-penetrated branches
 within certain political parties.   The reason is obvious.   South Vietnam is
 the testing ground for Mao Tse-tung's theories of "People's War" and "wars
 of national liberation," and victory for the Vietcong will vindicate Pek-
 ing's advocacy of aggression and revolution in Asia, Africa and Latin
 America.   It is the gallant struggle of the South Vietnamese people and
 their Government, helped by the American military presence in South Viet-
 nam, which stands heroically in the way of Peking's evil aspirations.
 Over the years, the Government has taken action from time to time
 against persons who have sought to subvert the Constitution and destroy
 our democratic way of life.   The Government has also made it unmistakably
 clear on several occasions that those who allow themselves to become agents
 and stooges of the Communists must be prepared to accept the inevitable con-
 sequences of their illegal action.   With the increasing threat of militant
 Communism, it is Government's inescapable duty to take firm and effective
 steps to safeguard the security of the country and its people, and this the
 Government is doing with the full support of all loyal citizens of this coun-
 try.

 AIM
 4+.  The aim of the White Paper is to outline the serious nature of the
 threat to Malaysia's security posed by the Communist Party of Malaya and
 the militant policies of its United Front.
 Background
 6.   Whilst it is a fact that the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) ceased
 to exist as an effective organisation on Malaysian territory in 1960, it
 is also true to say that by then its remnants had established themselves
 successfully in remote areas along the Malaysian-Thai border and had sent
 their representatives to Peking.
 7.   Since the end of the Emergency in 1960, the Communist Party of Malaya
 has continued to develop a safe base in the Malaysian-Thai border area.
 It has also established itself in the international Communist field with
 "missions" in Peking and Jakarta.   Its representatives have attended many
 international Communist Front conferences round the world, and it has an
 active group in London which serves to co-ordinate CPM activities in the
 Afro-Asian and other spheres of interest.
 8.   The Communist base along the Malaysian-Thai border was originally
 established in 1953 and in the following years various armed units, and
 political and propaganda organisations of the CPM, retreated into the com-
 parative safety of what is now regarded by the CPM as a series of "liberated
 areas."
 12.   It will be recalled that in mid-1961 the Prime Minister of Malaya first
 brought up the idea of the formation of Malaysia to consist of the Federation
 of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo.   This idea quickly
 developed popular political appeal and negotiations with the British Govern-
 ment were instituted in a normal friendly manner.   The Republic of Indonesia,
 which had a Treaty of Friendship with Malaysia, raised no objections and all
 went well until the last days of December 1961 when the Communist Party of
 Indonesia, or PKI, held "the Third Plenum of the PKI Central Committee.
 13.   This meeting called upon the Indonesian people to support "the righteous
 patriotic and just resistance of the people of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak,
 Brunei and North Borneo against ..............Malaysia."  This was later fol-
 lowed by D.N. Aidit's statement entitled "Why Indonesian Communists Condemn
 Malaysia."  The whole theme was later taken up by the then. Indonesian Govern-
 ment and the Malaysian public well know how Confrontation developed and how,
 three and a half years later, wiser counsels prevailed in ruling Indonesian
 circles following the abortive Communist coup on 1 October 65.   Needless to
 say, PKI connections with Peking, the supply of arms from China, the train-
 ing of Communist militants and details of the coup have become matters of
 history.

 15.   In January 1965 came the formation of the "Thai Patriotic Front"
 based in Red China, and subsequent guerrilla. warfare in North-East Thai-
 land.                   The Malayan National Liberation League mission arrived in Jakarta
 a month or two later; and then came the announcement of the formation of
 the "Malayan Patriotic Front" in West Malaysia.   Soon after the Indonesian
 Government took action against the MNLL's Jakarta mission in October 1965,
 the CPM representatives in Peking were promoted to the status of "mission"
 and have taken over many of the MNLL Jakarta's international tasks.
 16.   In late 1964 and throughout 1965 the Communist directed National Front
 for the Liberation of South Vietnam stepped up considerably its militant
 struggle against the Government of South Vietnam, and regular soldiers of
 the North Vietnam regime crossed the border in great strength to escalate
 the war still further.
 17.   All this is background to what is going on today in South Vietnam.
 It is there that the Communists spearhead undisguised aggression into South-
 East Asia and, as will be seen later in the Paper, military action against
 the United States in South Vietnam is paralleled by co-ordinated support from
 the Communist United Fronts in the free countries of South-East Asia.
 THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF MALAYA
 18.   The CPM operates through two illegal organisations:
 (a) The Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), which is responsible
 for the armed struggle; and
 (b) The Malayan National Liberation League (MNLL), which is responsible
 for the constitutional struggle and certain aspects of the illegal, or
 "militant," struggle.
 22.   There are at present between five and six hundred armed members of the
 Communist Terrorist Organisation on this border.   They are well trained,
 fully indoctrinated with Communism and serve as a symbol of the armed strug-
 gle ready for use should the necessity arise.   In addition to these, the
 CPM has been busy giving guerrilla training to youths in the border area and
 up to one thousand of them form a reserve which may be embodied at short
 notice.
 23.   That the Communist Terrorist Organisation is still very much a force
 to be reckoned with was illustrated on 7 August 66 by the ambush of fifteen
 members of the combined Malaysian-Thai Security Forces, ten of whom were
 killed and the remainder wounded.   Let this serve as a reminder to be vigi-
 lant.                   The CPM may well take advantage of any deterioration in the political
 or military situation in South Vietnam to launch a renewed armed struggle in
 West Malaysia.

 THE COMMUNIST UNITED FRONT        BACKGROUND
 24.   When the CPM decided to mount its armed revolution in June 1948 it with-
 drew into the jungle all the cadres in its United Front.   The immediate re-
 sult was an almost total collapse of the Trade Union Movement and the complete
 disappearance of many bogus "nationalist" organisations.
 25.   From 1951 onwards the CPM has been endeavouring to stage a come-back
 through the formation of a series of Communist directed and controlled satel-
 lite organisations.   The Communist aim is to establish a United Front in the
 political, social, economic and educational fabric of the State through which
 it hopes to form somehow a Communist Republic of Malaya (including Singapore).
 CURRENT POLICY OF THE COMMUNIST UNITED FRONT
 26.   Since early 1964 the Communist United Front has paid less and less at-
 tention to its so-called "constitutional struggle" and has developed what it
 has called "a South Vietnam atmosphere" of illegal "militancy."
 27.   What is this "militancy," and how does it differ from the "legal" strug-
 gle and the "armed struggle"  The answer is in a secret Communist document
 dated 20 March 1965 recovered from an Executive Committee Member of a Partai
 Rakyat Branch in Perak.   This states:
 Methods of Struggle:   These are:   intense struggle or mild struggle,
 mass struggle or parliamentary struggle, violent struggle or peaceful
 struggle.   The application of the method of struggle depends on the re-
 actionaries, the political fervour of the people and the comparison of
 strength between the enemy and ourselves.   It is necessary to substitute
 rapidly one method with another in accordance with changes in the objec-
 tive situation and make flexible use of methods according to necessity
 ....(We) should now adopt the violent method of struggle and make suf-
 ficient preparations."
 29.    .... On 13 February 65 (an) illegal procession organised by the Social-
 ist Front (prepared) through the streets of Kuala Lumpur.   This illegal demon-
 stration has proved to be the prototype for Communist "militancy" and Commu-
 nist Front Organisations throughout West Malaysia have been constantly urged
 to carry out similar illegal displays.
 31.    With the war in South Vietnam reaching a crucial stage there has been in-
 creasing evidence of carefully planned Communist co-ordination on an inter-
 national scale.
 32.    In early 1966, a call by the Peking Communist bloc and their sympathisers
 to step up activities against the United States of America, particularly against
 American intervention in Vietnam, was made at the Communist -organised Tri-Con-
 tinential Peoples Solidarity Conference in Havana when a resolution was passed.
 "Appealing to all people to render moral support to Vietnam in every
 way by holding demonstrations, taking part in rallies and by organising

 34.    .... the Writers Emergency Meeting's final communique had this to say:
 "The Meeting .... extends whole-hearted support to the
 armed struggles and all other forms of patriotic struggles
 against imperialism headed by the United States in Laos, Thai-
 land, Malaya (including Singapore), North Kalimantan, Indonesia."
 A member of a secret Communist underground organisation within Partia
 Rakyat Perak, had this to say after arrest:
 "I joined the Secret Organisation in 1960 at Malim Nawar
 .... my Directing Figure told me to pay attention to local po-
 litical affairs and to elevate my status in Partai Rakyat.   I
 was told specifically to work my way up in the Party .... and
 to talent spot suitable members for the Secret Organisation.
 I was told to control the 'X' Section at State level so that
 I could pass on the views and directions of the Secret Organ-
 isation; in this respect I was quite successful...."
 45.    This particular person has taken a major part in the militant acti-
 vities of MPSF branches in Central Perak and claims to have carried a red
 flag during the 13 February 65 demonstration in Kuala Lumpur.
 46.    As mentioned previously the 13 February 65 demonstration was the
 prototype for further similar demonstrations.  About two hundred Perak
 MPSF (Malayan Peoples Socialist Front) officials and members were known
 to have participated in this demonstration.  Directives were issued to
 convene meetings to analyse the demonstration, which was subsequently up-
 held as a "Socialist success" to be used as the basis for future mass
 struggle.
 47.   The Perak MPSF used to publish a monthly organ called the "Berita
 Rengkas."  The various issues of this publication contained Communist
 United Front arguments and propaganda calling for the destruction of
 Malaysia and emphasising the necessity to adopt a more militant form of
 struggle.
 49.   Despite the Government's ban on public assemblies during the worst
 part of Confrontation, the LPM and PRM Perak, since early July 1965, have
 held more than twenty-five illegal public rallies and concerts.   The inten-
 tion of holding the illegal rallies and concerts was not only for the dis-
 semination of Communist propaganda but was also to invite Police retaliation
 and thus to provoke clashes between the Police and members of the public.
 50.   The MPSF Perak achieved a degree of success when on three occasions
 during their illegal concerts, they managed to incite their members and sup-
 porters to clash with the Police.   The last showdown with the Police was on
 28 November 65 at Malim Nawar, and resulted in the death of a Committee
 member of the LPM Malim Nawar Branch.

 51.   The death of this Committee member was quickly exploited by the LPM
 Perak United Front cadres.   Seditious pamphlets, accusing the Alliance
 Government of killing the Committee member, were distributed throughout
 the country and other LPM State Divisions were urged to hold protest
 meetings. On 7 January 66 Police arrested eleven of the leading agita-
 tors.                      Twelve others, however, escaped arrest and went into hiding, in-
 cluding a number of important Communist United Front cadres who had been
 mainly responsible for organising the militant form of mass struggle.
 They are still living underground.
 52.   Communist United Front workers ... continue to advocate a more mili-
 tant form of struggle.   They sent about seventy (of their) members ...
 to participate in a ten-minute anti-American demonstration in Kuala
 Lumpur on 8 March 66 during which the American International Assurance
 Building in Ampang Road was stoned.   They also sent about one hundred
 members to participate in the "Aid Vietnam Against American Aggression"
 demonstration in Penang on 24 June 66.
 53.   Over forty illegal rallies, concerts and demonstrations of a militant
 nature have been held in Perak, Penang, Johore, Malacca, Selangor and
 Kedah during the last eighteen months.
 55.   The Government now wishes to state clearly that CPM penetration and
 influence within certain political parties has been neither haphazard nor
 indirect.   On the contrary, the CPM has established for some time a system
 of direct contact with certain politicians.
 56.   These politicans, and others, have been invited to the Malaysian-Thai
 border area where they have been taken into the jungle and have undergone
 a "baptism of revolution."
 58.   Upon arrival, they were warmly received and entertained by the leaders
 of the CPM local organisations and were invited to take part in concerts
 and political forums.   They were also taken round the Communist Terrorist
 armed units, and the armoury, and asked to read the CPM's propaganda ma-
 terials such as the "Liberation News" issued by the MNLL and miscellaneous
 manifestoes.   In addition, the CPM made use of the services of the local
 population in the area to bring food and drinks for its visitors.  All these
 entertainments were designed to give a deep and lasting impression to its
 guests that there exists in the border area a "People's Armed Force," that
 there is "full co-operation between the Communists and the local populace"
 and that a "Liberated Area" has been established.

 61.   These "baptisms of revolution" are very much in line with CCP ex-
 perience in Yenan during the 1930s when it set up a university in the
 liberated area for training youths in United Front activity.   It appears
 that the CPM, which has always drawn on CCP experience, is turning what
 it calls its "liberated areas" on the Malaysia-Thai border into another
 "Yenan in miniature" so as to attract and influence Communist sympathisers
 in West Malaysia.
 64+.   It is manifestly clear from the wealth of evidence disclosed in this
 White Paper that growing Communist militancy in Malaysia, and in the free
 countries of South-East Asia, is closely connected, and skilfully co-
 ordinated, with Communist aggression against the Republic of Vietnam.
 Thus, it is in this perspective that the revival of the militant Commu-
 nist threat to West Malaysia should be studied.
 65.   Since the, end of the First Emergency on 31 July 60 the Communist
 Party of Malaya has undergone a period of streamlining, retraining and
 reindoctrination.   It has established a series of safe bases, or what it
 calls "liberated areas," along the Malaysian-Thai border and poses a major
 threat to the security of this country.
 66.   The CPM has a nucleus of between five and six hundred well-trained
 guerrillas and a reserve of about one thousand young men who are available
 for full time service if required.   These people pose a straightforward
 military threat and clearly could be used aggressively should Peking so
 require.  Moreover, the CPM may well take advantage of any deterioration
 in the political or military situation in South Vietnam to launch a re-
 newed armed struggle in West Malaysia.
 67.   The recent outbreak of "militancy" within the Communist United Front,
 especially in Perak, is not the work of frustrated politicans with no
 avenues left for "constitutional struggle," but is carried out on the
 directions of the Communist Party of Malaya.  These directives are con-
 veyed by personal contact and through "baptisms of revolution" for poli-
 ticians and others in jungle camps along the Malaysian-Thai Border.
 68.   Furthermore, the Communist exploitation of anti-American sentiments,
 encouragement of chauvinist feelings towards education and the National
 Language, and thinly disguised Communist approaches to unsophisticated
 kampong (neighborhood) folk are all part of the Communist plan to win sup-
 port by fraudulent means from the people of this country.   These campaigns
 are neither based on sound argument nor conducted for any altruistic motives
 but are operated with the single aim of furthering the Communist cause.
 69.  Aware that the people of this country have a right to be protected
 from blatant Communist subversion the Government considers the time has come
 to take preventive action now against all forms of illegal "militancy" and
 to put an end to these "baptisms of revolution."

 any real likelihood, as Tan made
 clear in a subsequent statement, that
 it will be translated into action. Still,
 as symbols of the deteriorating re-
 lationship between these two inter-
 dependent states whose association
 once promised hopes of stability in
 the southern tier of Southeast Asia,
 the barter controversy and the Port
 Swettenham  threat  are  painfully
 apposite.
 Typical of these new divisive
 trends was an even more bitter quar-
 rel            that developed      in   February,
 when the Second Battalion of the
 Singapore infantry regiment that
 had been serving in Borneo as part
 of the multinational Malaysian se-
 curity forces returned home after
 completing its tour of duty. Instead
 of returning to their permanent
 quarters, however, the Singaporean
 troops were obliged to pitch tents
 because Kuala Lumpur's Royal Ma-
 laysian battalion, stationed in Sin-
 gapore under the terms of the sepa-
 ration agreement, refused to vacate
 the Singapore battalion's barracks
 until the Singapore government pro.
 vided suitable alternative accommo-
 dations.
 The controversy raised immediate
 fears in Singapore that Kuala Lum-
 put was trying to turn the island
 into a Malaysian satellite. In Kuala
 Lumpur the reaction was that Singa-
 pore was trying to break the separa-
 tion agreement, which in turn raised
 new fears in Singapore that Kuala
 Lumpur might be tempted to use
 military force if Singapore pursued
 economic and political policies of
 which it disapproved. Fortunately
 wiser counsels eventually prevailed,
 and in mid-March it was announced
 that Singapore had agreed to find
 alternative accommodation for the
 Malaysian battalion in exchange for
 the return of defense equipment
 that Malaysia had been holding.
 The Hazards of Separation
 In retrospect, it is easy to see
 that Lee Kuan Yew's vigorous, even
 ruthless, approach that proved so
 necessary and so effective in the mal-
 odorous Sintannore political scene
 could not have been translated into
 the conservative councils of Kuala
 Lumpur without provoking person.
 al as well as political animosities.
 While Singapore remained a mem-
 ber of the federation, however, even
 the most violent personal clashes
 precipitated by Lee's intellectual su-
 periority, arrogance, and drive were
 confined to the family circle. To-
 day, the causes for conflict not only
 remain but have been exacerbated
 and raised to the level of interna-
 tional quarrels. If Kuala Lumpur
 had used force to bend Singapore to
 its will a year ago, there would have
 been a storm, but it would have
 remained an internal matter. Today
 such an act would be an act of war.
 In a more equable political cli-
 , mate, the recognition of the hazards
 that separation has raised for both
 territories would have led to ex-
 pedient co-operation on vital issues.
 To  expect  such  pragmatism  in
 Southeast Asia, however, is utopian
 to begin with, and in the case of
 Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, it
 underestimates the antagonism that
 divides the two ruling elites. They
 are set on courses which may not
 lead to collision but which threaten
 to foment the mutually undesirable
 conditions  that  Kuala  Lumpur
 hoped to avoid first by merger and
 later by separation.
 To Singapore, Malaysia meant
 above all a common market. "One
 of the most compelling factors why
 we went into Malaysia was because,
 we wanted the broader base, so that
 industrialization and capital accu-
 mulation could take place with less
 sacrifice," Lee Kuan Yew told a
 Singapore audience. Singapore's con-
 tribution of forty per cent of its
 revenue to the federal budget was
 the price it had to pay for an outlet
 for the productive energies and in-
 dustrial skills of its population,
 which is expanding by four per cent
 a year.
 But separation resulted in the
 imposition of immediate trade and
 .tariff barriers. Although It clearly
 had the most to lose in any trade
 war, Singapore was first off the mark
 with the imposition of duties and
 quotas on manufactured goods com-
 ing from Malaya in competition
 with its own industries. Manufac-
 turers in Malaya ruefully ' began to
 think of suspending operations that
 had been initiated only on the
 assumption that Singapore's more
 active market would be freely avail-
 able.
 UNDER strong commercial pressures
 in both Kuala Lumpur and Sin-
 gapore, the two governments agreed
 last September 8 to remove quota
 restrictions on trade across the cause-
 way that links Singapore with the
 Malay peninsula. Hope rose high on
 October 8 when the Singapore gov-
 ernment announced that all obsta-
 cles to trade between Singapore and
 Malaysia would be eliminated im-
 mediately by the lifting of the li-
 censing and quantitative restrictions
 on commodities contained in the
 common market list drawn tip by
 the two countries.
 These hopes were soon  disap-
 pointed. The following day, Kuala
 Lumpur announced new tariffs to
 protect  Malaysian manufacturers.
 'Forty-eight hours later, Singapore re-
 plied with its own list of some 150
 protective duties on goods manu-
 factured in numerous foreign coun-
 tries but also in Malaya.
 Singapore went on to pass the
 National Reregistration Act, which
 is designed to classify all residents of
 Singapore as citizens or non-citizens.
 Since many thousands of Singapore's
 inhabitants have only the vaguest
 idea where they were born and even
 more frequently are unable to pro.
 duce the documentary proof required,
 the task is more formidable than
 the government anticipated. But the
 desired result-the creation of the
 machinery to exclude Malaysians
 from Singapore citizenship, and also
 from the Singapore labor market,
 except where they possess useful
 professional, technical, or commer-
 cial skills-is likely to be achieved.

 Federation of Malaysia - a member of the UN and Commonwealth in South-
 east Asia; came into being September 16, 1963, following 2 years of
 negotiations and a formal agreement with Great Britain signed July 9,
 1963, consenting to relinquish sovereignty over Singapore, Sarawak
 (on Borneo) and Sabah (North Borneo) to permit them to federate with
 the existing independent Federation of Malaya.  Brunei, a small British-
 protette-d sultanate on northern Borneo, withdrew during negotiations
 over a question of precedence.  Formation was opposed by Indonesia and
 '   Philippines, but a UN inspection team's survey of North Borneo
 (Sabah) and Sarawak showed popular support for the merger.  Indonesia

 Malaysia was defined as a constitutional, parliamentary monarchy
 comprised of the nine hereditary sultanates of the Federation of
 Malaya, independent since 1957 -- Johore, Kedah, Kenlantan, Negri
 Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor and Trengganu -- the two
 former British Straits settlements of Penang and Malacca, and the for-
 mer British colonies of Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo (renamed
 Sabah).
 But on August 9, 1965, Singapore announced its separation from
 the Federation, under an agreement between Malaysia and Singapore offi-
 cials that it was the best way to end tensions between the Chinese,
 largest ethnic group in Singapore and in the Federation, and the Malays,
 2nd largest group, who were in control of the Federation government.
 Malaysia's population, before Singapore's separation, was composed
 of:     Malays and closely related groups, 40%; Chinese, 42%; Indians and
 Pakistanis, 10%; others, 8%.  With Singapore's departure, the Malays
 became the ethnic majority in Malaysia, with ethnic Chinese totaling
 over a third of the population.
 On August 9, 1965 the Government of Malaysia announced that terms
 had been agreed upon with the Malaysian State of Singapore for the
 separation of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia.
 Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman thought that Malayan
 predominance should be maintained indefinitely with adequate provi-
 sions for safeguarding the rights of other races (i.e., the Chinese).
 Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, held that the special
 status of the Malays should be guaranteed only for a specific interim
 period, after which time there would be neither special privileges or
 special restrictions for any race.  Disagreements between the two
 leaders on this issue were exacerbated by their personal antagonisms and
 by failure to agree on the distribution of territorial revenues.   The
 severed sections immediately began attempts to undercut one another in
 tae foreign trade field (see the Denis Warner article also attached).

 The Meaning of "Black Power"
 JAMES E. JACKSON
 F ROM the Montgomery, Alabama,
 Bus Boycott which  the  Reve-
 rend Martin  Luther King                led      in
 11)50 to the Freedom March through!
 Mississippi         which James Meredith
 initiated on June 5 this year, the
 struggle  of Negro Americans  to:
 secure their citizenship rights to full
 political, economic and social equal-
 ity has been the most visible battle
 banner on the  frontier of  social
 progress In our country for a decade.
 Enormous energy has been expend-
 ed                  In  great     actions  of  Negroes
 and their white supporters in dram-
 atizing                      the demands for equality
 and freedom  and  for an end    to
 segregation and discrimination, In
 these struggles  men, women    and
 youth of the Negro freedom move-
 ment have made  many                         sacriflces:
 scores have been martyred,   thou-
 sands have been Imprisoned, schools,
 churches  and   homes  have   been
 bombed.
 When contrasted with the situa-
 tion that prevailed a decade ago, the Nragro freedom movement can take
 justifiable pride in. the significant
 gains which  its  militant struggle
 has forced the ruling class to yield.
 However,     when measured against
 the rights   which white Americans;
 take for granted as their birthright,
 and when weighed. against the suf-
 fering and sacrifices exacted in the
 last decade of hard-fought battles,
 the advances which Negro Ameri-
 cans have made towards the goal of
 equality and freedom have indeed
 been Insubstantial.
 All of  the key  indices of their
 special oppression remain as before:
 Negroes are the most disfranchised
 politically,  the  most  jobless  and
 underemployed      economically; in
 terms of social well-being, they are
 the most deprived-ill-housed, med-
 ically                            uncared  for,  educationally
 and culturally denied; their dignity
 as human beings is constantly vio-
 lated by anti-Negro slurs and defa-
 mation, by the practices and pre-
 cepts of the doctrine of white racist,
 supremacy.
 After  a  decade  of  pragmatic'
 pursuit of obvious objectives essen-
 tial for the attainment of a status
 of equality with all other citizens,
 the need for a summing-up of ex-
 perience and  the definition  of  a
 theory of Negro freedom as an aid
 and guide to the further develop-,
 ment of the movement has become'
 a matter of concern to the leader-
 ship.
 The catch-phrase or  slogan 'of
 Black  Power  has  emerged  as  a
 rather sensationalized by-product'
 of the new  endeavours of Negro
 leadership to formulate a strategic
 and tactical pattern of guide-lines,
 to elaborate a theory of the advances
 of  the Negro  freedom movement.
 The primary use   of the tern),
 Black Power was in connection with
 the campaigns to boost the registra -1
 tion by Negroes for-the right to vote.'
 It was also used to describe the con*
 sequence of Negroes   withholding
 their  purchasing  power  against
 stores which discriminated against
 them; it was used to describe the
 potential power of the  economic,
 boycott In . the tactical armoury of
 the local Negro community.
 Stokley Carmichael, President of
 the Student Non-Violent Co-ordina;
 ting  Committee,  put  the  phrase
 Black Power into sioganized   form
 during speeches   on  the 260-mile
 Meredith Mississippi Freedom March.
 In doing so, he was seeking to gene
 ralize certain positive experience of
 the Lowndes County, Alabama, Free
 dom Organization, which had field-1
 ed  an all-Negro  (Black Panther)'
 party in the local elections this year.'
 His central emphasis was that Ne-
 groes should not hesitate to utilize
 situations where they  are  forced
 into a separated majority of the pop-
 CPYRGHT
 ulatlon "to grasp the political pow-
 er in those areas where Negroes.
 predominate." Elaborating on  this
 particular concept behind the phrase
 Black Power, the Mississippi Free-
 Victoria Gray, said In a press in-
 terview: "The MFDP is interested in
 consolidating a base of power. In the
 black community. This is our con-
 cern. But we are not Interested ba-
 sically in colour-and we have said
 this in our campaign. Our interest is
 In changing the political and ' the
 economic system of this entire state
 and this ultimately involves white
 people as well as blacks. But this
 does not have to be a contradiction
 with  the SNCC concept of Black
 Power."
 r  +  r
 In a declaration printed as an ad
 broadside in the New York Times of
 July 31, a National Committee of Ne-
 gro Churchmen Issued a statement
 on Black Power signed by promi-
 nent                                                                                              Negro  clergymen  of major
 denomination.  They  put  It  that
 "powerlessness breeds a race of beg-
 gars.... A more equal sharing of
 power is precisely what Is required
 as  the precondition of authentic
 human Interaction....
 What  the  "disinherited"  must
 have, the clergymen pointed   but,
 was an increased "capacity to par-
 ticipate with power-i. e., to have
 some organized  political and eco-
 nomic strength                                                                                                     to really influence
 people with whom one interacts. , : r
 They declared, further, that "Ne-
 groes need power in order to partle-
 ipate more effectively at all levels of
 the life of our nation."
 Essentially, there is general agree-
 ment                                                                                              among   Negro  spokesmen

 positions of influence, of  Black
 Power.
 This aspect of the concept of
 Black Power corresponds very much
 to what was stated in the resolution
 on the Negro question of the Com-
 munist Party. The Communist Par-
 ty's statement on the Negro  ques-
 tion, adopted at its Seventeenth Con-
 vention In 1959 and reaffirmed and
 amplified at the Eighteenth Conven-
 tion this June, said:
 "Negro Americans are determined
 to build ever closer their unity in
 order to wage the struggle even
 more militantly to break down all
 remaining barnicrs In their exercise
 of any and all political, economic
 and social rights enjoyed by other
 citizens.

 of the American people as a whole.
 They -are forging an internal unity
 to facilitate their struggle for inte-

 And several years in advance of
 the current concern with this aspect
 of the problem of the movement, the
 Communist Party thus formulated
 its position:
 The Negro people in the United
 States must  secure  their rightful
 share of governmental  power.  In
 those urban and rural communities
 .where they are the larger part of the
 population generally. and in the deep
 South areas where they are the larg-
 er part of the  population           partic
 ularly, they must constitute the ma-
 jority power in government.

 re-establishment of, Negro hegemony
 over the leadership of all major de-
 partments  of  the  Negro  freedom
 movement. This is a demand for a
 new quality to Negro-white rela-
 tions  within the Negro freedom
 movement; it demands an end to all
 paternalistic and privileged assump-
 tions on the part of white partici-,
 pants in the Negro, freedom move-
 ment. Which is to say, that the white
 supporters of the movement must
 display sensitivity and not arrogate
 ? to  themselves  roles   of  super-
 advisers to the                              leadership as  the
 price for      their participation. Also,
 the leadership of such organizations
 as SNCC and the Congress on Racial
 Equality have called for a greater
 respect for the mores of the Negro
 community on the part of  white
 workers In the movement, in order
 not to affront or violate the dignity
 of those very people  with whom
 they join, for, indeed, a vital part of
 that which the oppressed tight for is
 human  dignity. in  general, these
 organizations have called upon their
 white supporters to, make their first
 concentration work In the working-
 class areas of the adjacent white
 communities.
 Especially do the Negro  leaders
 now challenge the organized labour
 movement to make their support to
 the cause of Negro freedom more
 visible and more substantial in terms
 of policing their own union areas of
 Influence and authority for ending
 discriminatory practices in employ-
 ment,   housing,   upgrading,   ap-
 prenticeship and other training pro-
 grammes, and election to union office:
 Above all, Negro leaders demand of
 the labour leaders that they carry
 through the  long-awaited  task of
 undertaking the organization of the
 unorganized Southern workers, Ng-
 gro and white, of factory and farm.
 Another question which has been
 given widespread discussion in con-
 nection with the dialogue on the
 theory and practice  of the Negro
 freedom movement which the Black
 Power issue triggered has been that
 of the effect of the foreign policy of
 the government upon the goals of
 the Negro people.
 Never before have so substantial a
 section of the Negro   leadership
 come out in vigorous opposition to a
 war in which the U.S. government is
 engaged. In the past, individual Nei
 gro leaders have opposed various for.
 eign policies and particular acts of
 aggression by the government, but
 never before have entire organiza-
 tions of the Negro people-as is the
 case In respect to SNCC and CORE-
 come out in unequivocal denuncia-
 tion of a war in which a high pro-
 portion of Negro soldiers have been
 impressed to kill and be killed. In
 addition to Carmichael and McKis-
 sick, leaders of SNCC and CORE
 respectively, the Nobel Peace Priz
 winner and best known Negro lead-
 er, Rev. Martin  Luther King, has
 come out against the war which the
 Johnson government is waging in
 Vietnam. The resistance to support
 for Johnson's genocidal war against
 the people of Vietnam Is disclosed
 in the growing number of Negro
 youth who defy the draft boards, the
 army induction centres, and in the
 number of Negro soldiers in the
 U.S. armed forces stockades In Viet-
 nam for resisting serving on "hunt
 and kill" missions against the people
 of Vietnam.
 Carmichael, McKissick, King and
 others have raised the banner of
 anti-imperialist solidarity  between
 the Negroes of the U.S. and the vic-
 tims of U.S. imperialist aggression hi
 Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, its
 well as African and Latin-Ameri?-
 can countries, as a vital strategy for
 uniting the cause of Negro freedom
 with the interest of the majority of
 mankind. They  have  pointed out
 that for the American  Negro  to
 adopt a position of support to U.S.
 imperialist policies of aggression and
 war would be to isolate themselves
 from the overwhelming majority 6f
 mankind. This represents not only
 a meaningful contribution of Negro
 Americans to the growing power of
 the world front to force the U.S. gov-
 ernment to quit Vietnam but also
 represents a new depth of compre-
 hension of the true nature of the so-
 cial and class forces-within the coun-
 try and the world arena on the part
 of an Important sector of the Negro
 freedom movement. It has demon-
 strated by Its opposition to the Viet-
 nam war that it associates the des-
 tiny of the just cause of Negro free-
 dom with the main social tendency
 of our epoch.
 Seeking sensations and fostering
 all opportunities for divisionism and
 conflict among the component . sec-
 tions of the Negro freedom move-
 ment and between Negro and white,
 the press and television have been
 waving the phrase Black Power be-
 fore the eyes of the nation with
 alarming interpretations. It is repre-
 sented as a black nationalist answer
 to white supremacy and as the'doc-
 trine for a ghetto rising of blacks
 against whites in the great cities of
 the country.
 The Ideological  provocateurs of
 the press find some encouragement
 for their sensationalizing of parodies
 of concepts about the Black Power
 phrase in some speeches and articles
 of certain Negro spokesmen  who
 someti.mesendow the two words: with
 powers that they cannot and should
 not possess. At times, they even sug-
 gest that by uniting   their . own
 strength Negroes can go It alone, by
 virtue of the fact that they would
 "control" politically the central cities
 of a score of metropolitan centres of
 the country. What these poorly in-
 formed speakers and demagogic com-
 mentators like the Liberator Maga-
 zine's editorial writer forget, or!don't
 know, is the actual nature of : the
 "power structure" in this country:
 the corporate elite of monopglists
 whose power over the Congress, the
 White I-louse and the Pentagon rests
 on the solid material base of de;fac-

 In responding to the atrocities of
 the police against the Negro march-
 ers struggling  to  push back the'
 walls of their ghettos to enlarge the
 living space and secure some job
 opportunities, some speakers have
 suggested that Negroes could organ-
 ize their own policing  system to
 counter the violence of the' racists
 and the police.
 The concept of self-defence is n
 well-established practice in life on
 the part of American working peo-
 ple; furthermore, it is given official
 sanction in 'the U.S. Constitution.
 The right of the Negro community or
 of an individual Negro citizen to
 armed self-defence in face of wanton
 assault by mobsters, racists, or other
 lawless elements is one of the man-
 hood rights of citizens of this coun-
 try and does not need the advocacy,
 of anyone.
 The fact that circumstances have
 prevailed where Negroes have been
 abandoned to mob terror by law
 enforcement authorities, and indeed
 in many situations the officers of the
 law, sheriffs  and policemen have
 themselves  committed  the  "deeds
 most foul," does not make the res-
 ponsibility of the Federal govern-
 ment any less for the protection of
 the lives and, property of Negroes.
 Negroes hpve defended themselves
 in the past' and will do so in the,
 future against racist violence, but
 their demand; remains for the govern-
 ment to discharge its duty to safe-
 guard the lives and property of all
 of its citizens in the exercise of their
 constitutional rights.
 The widespread discussion which
 has developed about the several in-
 terpretations. of the cry of Black
 Power, which, was raised by marchers
 on the walk  from   Memphis to
 Jackson last June, is part of a seek-
 ing for sound theory to illuminate
 the pathway of progress for the
 Negro freedom movement.
 The Communist Party has already
 made  important  contributions  in
 elaborating theoretical problems and
 strategic concepts of the Negro free-
 dom movement. As the leadership
 of the mass movement now address-
 es Itself to the problem of historic
 direction and  relationship  of the
 Nero people's cause to the goals of
 peace and the change of the system
 of society itself, the Communists will
 continue to make key contributions.
 We fully support the struggle of
 the Negro people to  secure the
 power required to free themselves
 from racist. tyranny, economic ex-
 ploitation and social discrimination.
 At the some time, we point out that
 the struggle for winning  freedom
 has to be waged in more areas than
 just those situations in which Ne-
 grocs constitute the majority.
 It is necessary to win broad strata
 of the white masses to an active par-
 ticipation in' the struggle for the
 freedom rights of the Negro people.
 On the basis of mutual advantage
 and advanced self-interest, it is nec-
 essary and possible to establish a
 fighting partnership between    the
 Negro freedom movement and the
 organized  labour  movement,    and
 with various organized categories of
 the population who are victimized
 by the monopolists' establishment.,
 Negro    Americans,  being  over-
 whelmingly                                                                             working     people,  are
 victimized by class exploitation; the
 racist deprivation and discrimination
 which they, suffer are part of the
 systematic super-exploitation   and
 robbery practised in accord with the
 laws of the system upon the most
 underprivileged part of the nation's
 working people, the Negro people.
 Therefore,: the struggle of the Ne-
 gro people. for  freedom  can be
 viewed as a specialized part of the
 general class struggle of the jobless
 and working poor against. the reign
 ,of the monopolists-the working class
 against th~, capitalist class.   The
 struggle for, Negro freedom which
 rages these days in the streets of tho
 great cities ; as? well as along the
 rural roads is part of the revolu-
 tionary progesses which are rending
 the old social system beyond repair.

 WHAT THE NEGRO HAS-AND HAS NOT'-GAINED
 THE new factor in U.S. race relations and politics that has
 j  come to be known as backlash is more than merely the
 reaction of some white people to Negro rioting or cries of
 "black power." The attitude of many white Americans is in-
 fluenced by the belief that the Negro has made great gains in
 a relatively short time, and that he now would do better to
 stop agitating and consolidate what he has won. At the same
 time, much of the new black militancy is a result of frustra-
 tion over what many Negroes consider their snail's pace of
 progress. Beneath the passion and the rhetoric, these two op-
 posing views pose a root question about the state of the Ne-
 gro in the U.S. today: just what advances have-and have
 not-been made by the nation's 21 million Negroes?
 The fact is that Negroes have progressed farther and fast-
 er than any minority in the history of the U.S., or almost any
 other nation. Considering that the drive for full equality did
 not really begin until after World War 11 and did not achieve
 the sanction of law until the Supreme Court struck down the
 old "separate but equal" doctrine in 1954, the gains have
 been nothing less than remarkable. Though whites still earn
 far more than Negroes ($7,170 per family compared with
 $3?,971), Negro income has risen 24% since 1960 v. only
 14% for whites. Today, just over one in five Negro families
 earns more than $7,000 yearly, a figure that puts them firmly
 in the middle class. The Negro has enthusiastically partici-
 pated in the U.S.'s steadily increasing material prosperity:
 nine out of ten Negro families own one (or more) televi-
 sion sets, two-thirds have automatic washers and more than
 half own cars. Negroes own 50,000 businesses and, while
 most of them are small groceries, beauty parlors or mortu-
 aries, the nation has about 40 Negro millionaires and many
 thousands who are more than comfortably affluent.
 Practically all of the gains have been made by the grow-
 ing Negro middle class, which still constitutes a minority of
 the Negro population. That is the heart of the problem, for
 it leaves behind the lower-income, semiliterate Negroes,
 notably the families that are below the Government's $3,000-
 a-year poverty line. This class contains 60% of all the na-
 tion's Negro youths, the very people who are in the vanguard
 of desire and disorder. While the income of the middle-class
 Negro rises, that of this great mass of Negroes is actually
 declining. During the 1960s, median family income for Ne-
 groes has dropped from $3,897 to $3,803 in Los Angeles'
 Watts, from $4,346 to $3,729 in Cleveland's Hough district.
 This great disparity has created a profound hostility be-
 tween the low-income Negro and his more affluent, well-
 educated, middle-class brother. Demoralized, alienated and
 apathetic, the slum Negro is . bitterly jealous of those he
 scornfully calls "white niggers." The middle-class Negro, on
 the other hand, is troubled by the riots and the chants of
 "black power," which he knows hurt his cause. The gulf be-
 tween the two is widened by the fact that the better-off
 Negro tends to demonstrate too little concern for those he
 has left behind. Almost alone among all U.S. ethnic groups,
 Negroes have no significant charity supported by their own
 people for their own people. The number of Negroes on the
 public-welfare rolls is increasing, and one-third of the na-
 tion's spending for public aid, education and housing (or an
 estimated $3.5 billion in all) goes to Negroes, who consti-
 tute only 1 1 % of the U.S. population.
 Most of the Government's new antipoverty programs are
 directed toward the 2,800,000 poor Negro families. In many
 ways, they get more attention than the 9,100,000 poor white
 families, which are tucked away in such areas as the Appa-
 lachians and the Ozarks, the southern Piedmont, the Upper
 Great Lakes region and the Louisiana coastal plain. Half
 the eo le in the Job Corns and most of the preschoolers in
 both whites and Negroes-about 31% a year-hut the Nc-
 gro seems to have made more dramatic gains because he had
 greater ground to make up. The proportion of poor families
 among Negroes fell from 52.2% in 1959 to 43.1%a in 1964,
 while that among whites declined from 20.7% to 17.1%.
 The Government figures that if all Negroes could he brought
 up to the average white American's level of affluence, em-
 ployment and education, the U.S. economy's output would
 climb by $27 billion a year, equal to 4%  of the gross
 national product.
 It is almost academic to ask what the Negro wants. He
 wants what the white man has. To him, that means not
 only possessions but opportunity and options. It means a fair
 shot at the necessities of jobs, education and housing, as well
 as at the intangibles of political power, social acceptance and
 a sense of pride. How much of that has he gained? Here is
 a balance sheet of the Negro's recently acquired assets and his
 persistent liabilities, compiled from material gathered by 30
 TIME correspondents throughout the U.S.:
 s
 JOBS. The employment situation has become incomparably
 better for the middle-class Negro and worse for the lower-
 class Negro. While unemployment among whites has been
 declining this year and is now 3.3%, Negro unemployment
 has been climbing and is now 7.8%. This is primarily be-
 cause the jobless rate in many black slums has soared to 25%
 and automation has eliminated a lot of menial and manual
 jobs traditionally held by lower-income Negroes. The overall
 figure nonetheless conceals the fact that countless job op-
 portunities have opened for skilled and semiskilled Negroes
 in the past few years.
 Negro employment in the professional and technical fields
 has soared 130% in the past decade; the number of Negro
 lawyers has increased 50% since 1950. In the South, well-
 educated Negroes are being hired for the first time as clerks,
 policemen, nurses in white hospitals and teachers in white
 schools. Boston's Negro newspaper has six pages of want ads
 for everybody from laboratory technicians to plasma physi-
 cists. In Milwaukee, Chicago and Providence, corporations
 have joined together to seek ways of finding more Negro
 workers and executive trainees; in Minneapolis, Omaha and
 San Francisco, corporate recruiters flock to interview thou-
 sands of Negroes at "job fairs." A dozen recently created
 personnel agencies specialize in Negroes, and almost every
 Negro graduate with a good college record can count on from
 three to twelve job offers.
 Of course, discrimination is still far from eliminated. Some
 employment agencies, for example, use codes to alert prospec-
 tive employers that the applicant is a Negro. The most un-
 yielding barriers to the Negro's advancement are put up not
 by corporations but by the craft unions, which are so biased
 that it is easier for a Negro to become a physician or junior
 manager than an electrician or a plumber. A recent Labor
 Department survey showed that in Baltimore there were no
 Negro apprentices among the steam fitters, sheet-metal work-
 ers or plumbers; in Newark, none among the stonemasons,
 structural ironworkers or steam fitters; in Pittsburgh, none
 among the operating engineers, painters or lathers; in Wash-
 ington, none among the glaziers, sheet-metal workers or as-
 bestos workers.
 Largely because of union bars, the incredible fact is that
 since 1957 the number of Negroes at work in the U.S. private
 economy has scarcely increased at all. The number of Negro
 jobholders has risen from 6,721,000 to 7,747,000 during that
 period, but the gains have been primarily in Government jobs.
 Negroes hold 23% of the city jobs in New York, 30% in
 Cleveland, 40% in Philadelphia. At the federal level, 13.2%

 forces, the number of Negro field-grade officers (major
 hrough colonel) has jumped since 1962 from 769 to 1,319.
 ?
 EDUCATION. While still appreciably behind the whites, Ne-
 groes have made impressive gains in education, particularly
 it the college level. Outnumbered by white students 30 to I,
 hey have raised their numbers in colleges and universities to
 225,000-far greater than the total enrollments of the uni-
 versities of Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland
 and Switzerland put together. Almost all the Southern uni-
 ersitics  now have some Negroes. Admissions officers at
 uch universities as California and Stanford give preference
 o Negroes; like many other schools, Harvard often chooses
 egroes over whites with equivalent academic records. So
 any scholarships are being offered that almost any talented,
 nergetic Negro youngster can get into college.
 For the Negro who never gets to the college level. things
 are considerably bleaker. In a recent study of 650,000
 children, the U.S. Office of Education reported that, com-
 pared with whites, the average Negro child actually attends
 ewer schools and has newer textbooks but is less likely to
 have modern scientific equipment or competent teachers.
 The Negro needs good teachers even more than whites be-
 cause of greater deprivation in his family background.
 Eighth-graders in Negro slum schools, for example, com-
 monly read at sixth-grade levels. The IQ of the average
 Harlem pupil drops from 90.6 in the third grade to.87.7 in
 the eighth grade. An extraordinary 67.5% of all Negroes
 fail the armed forces' pre-induction mental tests (v. 18.8%a
 of the whites).
 Four out of five U.S. students attend schools that are
 practically all black or all white. School segregation is rising
 in the North because an increasing number of neighbor-
 hoods are becoming wholly black. Ironically, integration has
 progressed far more rapidly in the South. Only 10% of the
 South's 3,500,000 Negro schoolchildren attend integrated
 classes, but that is twice as many as a year ago. Federal
 education officials say that 4,200 of the 4,600 Southern
 school districts have sent in "acceptable" plans for integra-
 tion. But the increase is slowing down because Congress-
 itself reacting to the reaction against Negro demonstrations
 and gains-has softened the penalties for noncompliance.
 ?
 HOUSING. Getting good housing is perhaps the most dif-
 ficult hurdle of all for most Negroes. One tragedy is that
 urban renewal often means Negro removal-replacing
 shacks with vertical ghettos for middle-income Negroes
 and forcing lower-income Negroes to move to even meaner
 slums. Because the Negro urban population has almost dou-
 bled since 1950, the ghettos are spreading. Negroes now
 constitute 27% of the population in Chicago, 37% in St.
 Louis, 39% in Detroit, 40% in Birmingham, 41% in New
 Orleans and Baltimore, 24% in Norfolk and 63% in Wash-
 ington. Worried about being surrounded by Negroes, most
 whites flee to the suburbs when Negroes move into an urban
 neighborhood; there, barely 4% of all residents are Negro.
 When given the choice, most Negroes are not terribly
 eager to live next door to the white man. Even in the 17
 states and 31 cities that have enacted fair-housing codes
 since 1958, thousands of huge, moderately priced apartment
 towers are pure white. Despite a fairly large supply of open
 housing, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission estimates
 that, since 1958, fewer than 60 Negro families have moved
 into white areas. The Negro's desire to enjoy the superior
 schooling and housing of a white neighborhood is very much
 tempered by his fear of striking out alone. He has a long
 way to go before he will live side by side with the white man
 even in moderate numbers.
 ?
 POLITICS. The advances have been enormous: the poteegn~-j
 eelective oven ffice 15a  risen 25uo to "Wffie*f~ff~'n'fdcf tit~4

 two in 1954 to six now; altogether, 17 are running for
 Congress this fall (eleven Republicans and six Democrats).
 Massachusetts' Republican Attorney General Edward Brook
 is the first Negro since Reconstruction to campaign for the
 U.S. Senate on a major party ticket. Last November, Cleve-
 land's Carl Stokes, a Negro state legislator, came within
 2,000 votes of unseating Mayor Ralph Locher, and Houston
 recently became the first Southern city to appoint a Negro
 assistant district attorney, Clark Gable Ward.
 Negroes will not live up to their full potential in politics
 until they become more diligent at the polls. While the
 number of registered Negro voters in the South has risen
 from 1,900,000 to 2,300,000 in the past ten years, scarcely
 35% of the eligible Negroes bother to vote in local clec
 tions up North; by contrast, 85% of the Jews vote, and
 get commensurate rewards when politicians pass out patron-
 age or nominations. New York's 16% Negro populatio
 elects only one of the city's 19 U.S. Congressmen, two 0
 the 37 city councilmen.
 ?
 SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE. The most obvious and humiliat-
 ing forms of discrimination have become illegal or unfash-
 ionable (at least in the North), but there are subtler prob-
 lems. The Negroes, like the Catholics and Jews before them
 want to be welcomed in the private clubs, on the golf
 courses and at weekend parties with their co-workers and
 customers. As it is, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission
 estimates that 90% of its state's whites have no contact
 with nonwhites, and the situation is much the same elsewhere
 The Negro thus has to look inward and, in so doing, is
 slowly beginning to discover a long-submerged sense o
 pride. That sense is essential to remedying the lower-clan
 Negro's other social and economic ills, since only pride car
 overcome the defeatist attitude that has contributed s
 much to his high rates of unemployment, illegitimacy, de
 linquency and crime. In Rochester, St. Louis and a doz
 en other cities, Negroes in the past two years have or
 ganized to clean up their neighborhoods, finance small busi
 nesses, pressure for school improvements and get polio
 action to chase out the "white hunters," white men who
 crash the ghetto in search of black prostitutes. There is
 trend among Negro coeds and career girls to wear thei
 hair "natural" instead of attempting to unkink it by "conk-
 ing"-rinsing it with lye and binding it with handkerchiefs
 Yet for every Negro who flaunts his identity, a hundred try
 to camouflage it. Advertisements in the Negro magazines still
 hymn Nadinola skin bleach: "Lightens and brightens skin."
 ?
 If not all Negroes covet white skin, all of them without
 exception seek after the white man's freedom of choice
 The Rev. James Jones, the white Episcopal Urban Vica
 of Chicago, who moved into a Negro ghetto, argues tha
 Negroes will not live up to their full responsibilities an
 potentials as citizens until the white majority grants the
 that freedom. "In the ghetto," he says, "there are no choices
 no power, no ability to make responses. Therefore there i
 no responsibility." Considering that the U.S. is the first so
 ciety in history to adopt as its national goal the full eco
 nomic integration and social equality of different races, th
 Negro's choices are widening with fair rapidity. The U.S
 has certainly come an incredibly long way since Abraha
 Lincoln, shortly before the end of the Civil War, askec
 his logistics experts to determine whether the U.S. couk
 muster enough transportation to export the Negroes-onl
 to be told that Negro babies were being born faster tha
 all the nation's ships could carry them from the country.
 The Negro has been a permanent part of America eve
 since then, and perhaps the greatest advance of recent year
 is the realization by white people that his problems canno
 be ignored. The Negro's recent progress, far fprom7 makin
