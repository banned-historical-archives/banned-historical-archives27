 THIS MATERIAL CONTAINS INFORMATION AFFECTING THE NATIONAL
 DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
 ESPIONAGE LAWS, TITLE 18, USC, SECS, 793 AND 794, THE
 TRANSMISSION OR REVELATION OF WHICH IN ANY MANNER TO AN
 UNAUTHORIZED PERSON IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.
 1.     Possible Soviet rocket-launching submarine in Murmansk
 area:                                                      a  ovie  ocean   25X1X
 patrol submarine sighted off  ape Teriberski was reportedly
 equipped with a ramp on the after deck, described as suitable
 for rocket or mine launching.                                               25X1A
 Comment:   Other unconfirmed reports from the Soviet Arctic
 continue  o indicate that the USSR is experimenting with sub-
 marine-launched guided missiles, probably the V-1 type, in
 that area.
 2.     Soviet press reaction to ANZUS Conference:   The Soviet
 press gave heavy coverage to the ANZUS Conference in Honolulu.
 Izvestia on 7 August described the "Pacific Union" as a link
 in the system of aggressive blocs with which the US is attempt-
 ing to encircle the world.   The two main US objectives at the
 conference, according to Izvestia, were "to draw Japan more
 directly into American military preparations in the Pacific"
 and to strengthen the US position in Southeast Asia at the ex-
 pense of Great Britain.
 Further, while the United States aims eventually to widen
 the "Pacific Union" to include Japan, the Philippines and the
 mainland states, three obstacles have thwarted its efforts to
 create "a single Pacific aggressive union":the reluctance of
 Australia and New Zealand to accept Japan as an ally, the "acute
 contradictions" between US and British aims in the Pacific,
 and the growth of the national liberation movement in the coun-
 tries of Asia, which makes the Asian states unwilling to join
 "the Pacific variant of the North Atlantic union."   It included
 an appeal to the peoples of Asia,  issued by the preparatory
 conference for the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, to com-
 bine their activities to resist the aggressive plans of the US
 imperialists against their freedom and independence.   (R FBIS

 3.          Shake-up in Czechoslovak League of Youth presages increas-
 ed application of Soviet methods:   On   August, the Presidium
 o      the Czechoslovak League of Youth purged its leadership and
 expelled its chairman, Josef Hejzlar, who was accused of having 25X1A
 been subverted by the influence of the Slansky group.
 The meeting was told by Josef Tesla, a Secretary of the
 Central Committee of the Communist Party, that Czechoslovak
 youth must apply the experience of the Soviet Komsomols and
 participate more fully in the Five Year Plan effort.   Tesla
 stressed the fact that youth must help develop socialism in
 rural areas and propagate new forms of farming among the
 peasantry.    (R FBIS           8 Aug 52)
 Comment:   There is increasing evidence that, through
 selective removal of high officials in the mass organizations,
 the party is taking steps to meet Gottwald's September criti-
 cismsof deficiencies in mass organizational work.  At present
 the government is trying to increase production by solving the
 problem of manpower by pressure and propaganda through mass
 organizations.
 Last month after the government had severely criticized
 the trade unions for their failure to consolidate labor dis-
 cipline and develop Soviet labor methods, the chairman of the
 Central Council of Trade Unions was removed from office and
 reassigned to a lesser post.
 4.          Budapest radio demands prison sentences for absenteeism:
 The Budapest radio has urged that workers who are guilty of
 absenteeism be turned over to the public prosecutor for im-
 position of the people's justice.   It points out that in cases
 where fines do not stop absenteeism  production managers should
 resort to imprisonment.   (R FBIS           , 10 Aug 52)              25X1A
 Comment:   The continued campaign against absenteeism in
 Hungarian industry reaches a new high in this broadcast.   The
 appeal to the sanction of people's justice as the only way of
 fulfilling the plan suggests that a wave of arrests of work-
 ing people may be forthcoming.

 5.           Hungarian Minister asserts bread grain crop collections
 good except in northeast:   Imre Nagy, Hungarian Minister of
 Crop Collections, told a meeting of Budapest and county coun-
 cil chairmen recently that.bread grain crop collections were
 good except in northeastern Hungary.   However, he scored the
 local councils and collection officials for permitting grain
 quota deductions for household food requirements on a per cap-
 ita basis and called for punitive measures to ensure comple-
 tion of bread grain collections by 20 August.
 The US Legation in Budapest points out that bread grain
 collections appear to be even higher than last year but corn,
 vegetables and root crops are still believed to be poor.   The
 Legation also notes that ambiguities in the January crop sur-
 render decree permit  deduction of per capita household grain
 requirements, while demanding the immediate surrender of crops
 at the threshing machine.   (R Budapest 112 and 121, 8 Aug 52)
 Comment:   Peasant resistance to crop collection probably
 has been largely based on legal grounds arising from the con-
 tradictory decree.                               It is interesting that some local councils
 have taken the side of the peasants.
 6.          American Legation comments on dissolution of Sovroms:   The
 American Legation in Bucharest believes that the disso u ion
 last month of the joint Soviet-Rumanian film company probably
 indicates a trend toward abandonment of minor holdings rather
 than a wholesale withdrawal from the Rumanian economy.   While
 there is some evidence that joint insurance and transport com-
 panies are being reorganized to give the Rumanians more prom-
 inence, other Sovroms in basic industries continue to function
 normally or are expanding, indicating that the Soviet Union
 is concentrating on branches which will continue to be sig-
 nificant after full socialization of the Rumanian economy.
 (C Bucharest 45, 8 Aug 52)
 Comment.:  A similar trend has been noted in Hungary.
 Some mind enterprises were returned to the Hungarians, but
 basic aluminum and petroleum industries and some transporta-
 tion have been retained under joint control.

 Japanese-British jurisdictional dispute eased:  Ambassador
 Murphy reports that the British Government  as now agreed to
 permit two Japanese-detained British sailors to appealvn their
 own behalf,, their two and one-half year sentences to a higher
 court. The defendants can be released on bail pending deci-
 sion on the appeal, which may not take place for a month or
 more.
 Murphy also notes that last week British naval authorities
 were given custody of six British sailors arrested at Sasebo
 for attacking Japanese policemen.   (C Tokyo 545, 9 Aug 52)
 Comment:  The arrest and detention of the sailors has
 evoked s rong official protest from the British Government,
 which disputes Japan's alleged right to exercise criminal
 jurisdiction over UN forces pending the conclusion of a UN-
 Japan agreement.   With the British now negotiating to gain
 the same rights for the Commonwealth troops as granted to
 American garrison troops, and the Japanese Government facing
 a'critical Diet and public in an election year, it was diffi-
 cult for either party to recede from their position.  The
 decision to appeal the case will provide the Japanese Govern-
 ment with a face-saving opportunity to suspend the sentence.
 9,        Chinese Communists direct cadres to study Chinese
 theorists:  The Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist
 Party issued a directive on 1 July governing the "political and
 theoretical  studies" of party cadres during the last half

 11>           Chinese Communist troops stationed in key Tibetan
 25X1X         areas:  Almost all o  the important areas in eas ern  ibet
 were garrisoned by small groups of Chinese Communist troops
 in March 1952
 .,r_ Y,,Y                                       Most o  these soldiers were in
 of 1952.   The  elementary class is to study a compendium
 called "Political Knowledge," the junior class will be
 required to know the official "Brief History of the CCP,"
 and the seniors' study will "center" on the "Selected Works
 of Mao Tse-tung."   (R FBIS 0 8 Aug 52)
 Comment:  These documents are the work exclusively of
 Chinese Communist theorists, and all emphasize that the
 party owes its successes primarily to its own efforts under
 theleadership of Mao Tse-tung.  They are also, however,
 Stalinist in orientation.   Soviet and Chinese theorists have
 agreed on the loose formula that the "Chinese revolution"
 was guided  by Marxism-Leninism, as developed and applied by
 Mao Tse-tung.

 Comment:   It is estimated that there are now 15,000
 Chinese Communist  troops in Tibet.   They have probably
 been located at strategic points   to consolidate Communist
 control and to prevent penetration from the south and west.

 12,          Macao imports strategic goods from Portugal:  The
 Portuguese steamer Timor           gross tons) arrived in Macao
 waters at the end of July with strategic goods from Portugal.
 Many of the items were consigned to the Macao government, but
 several cargoes were shipped to private trading companies in
 the colony.
 Although these cargoes were covered by official Macao
 import licenses, it is believed doubtful that a legitimate
 demand exists within the colony for all these items.   (S
 Hong Kong 299, 8 Aug 52)
 Comment:  The July clashes between Chinese and Portuguese
 border guards on the Macao frontier have made Lisbon more
 reluctant than ever to provoke the Communists by curtailing
 Macao's traffic in strategic goods.  The Portuguese Foreign
 Office has stressed Macao's helplessness in conversations
 with American Embassy officials and has expressed the hope
 that the United States will appreciate the "exposed" position
 in which Portugal now finds itself.
 13.         Thai Government press comments favorably upon Egyptian
 coup:  The government-controlled press in Bangkok  as
 commented favorably upon the coup in Egypt and King Farouk's
 abdication.  The American Embassy states that the editorial
 tone and use of the term "coup party" suggest that a delib-
 erate                       analogy is being drawn between the situation in
 Egypt and Thailand,  The present military leaders of Thailand
 resent the independence shown by their King and, according to
 the Embassy, it is unusual for the press to comment so cate-
 gorically about the internal affairs of a friendly country.
 (C Bangkok 241, 7 Aug 52)
 Comment:  The Thai King is not known to have seriously
 interfered with the activities of the ruling clique since
 he signed the revised constitution last March.   There is no
 evidence that a movement is under  way to remove the King,
 although the recent birth of an heir caused the American
 Embassy to comment that in a showdown the leaders could force
 him to abdicate and they could exercise royal control through
 a regency.
 Thai police find arms in home of former Cambodian leader:
 The Thai police are repor e  to have   discovered  arms and
 ammunition in the home of a former Cambodian leader, now

 Director General Phao.   The American Embassy comments that
 this development indicates Phao's continued desire to maintain
 friendly relations with dissident Cambodians.   (C Bangkok 241,
 7 Aug 52)
 Comment:  General Phao has previously been reported to
 have been in contact with both Peiping and local Communists.
 He is also often associated with smuggling activities in and
 out of Thailand which may include arms to rebel forces in
 Indochina.
 15e         Cabinet members to be responsible for development of
 Thailan :  The American  massy in Bangkok  as been  n ormed
 a     e Thai Cabinet is considering a proposal to make each
 of its fourteen members responsible for development programs
 in different parts.of the country.  The Embassy comments that
 the administrative weaknesses of such a plan suggest that
 its chief objective is the division of spoils.
 The British Embassy concurs in the American belief that
 Police Director General Phao would take control of southern
 Thailand under this scheme in order to exploit rich tin and
 rubber resources there.   (C Bangkok 241, 7 Aug 52)
 Britain sees improvement in Burma situation:  The British
 Foreign Office, encourage  by recent  eve opmen s in Burma
 showing improvement in security conditions and increased
 government stability, has indicated that upon completion of
 the current discussions in Rangoon, Britain will supply most
 of the arms and equipment Burma has urgently requested.  The
 Foreign Office has also expressed satisfaction over the recent
 improvement in relations between the British Services Mission
 (BSM) and the Burmese military.
 Britain would not object to Burmese procurement from
 American sources of military items it cannot supply, but wants
 to remain Burma's principal supplier so as to assist opera-
 tions of the BSM, and because of the sterling area's dollar
 exchange shortage.   (S London 748, 9 Aug 52)

 the

 Burmese
 Govern-
 ment has in the past been vitiated
 by
 disputes
 between
 the
 BSM and the Burmese military,

 increased determination Burma has recently shown in dealing

 17,         Leading Indonesian Communist reportedly to return from
 USSR:  A Jakarta daily reported that Semaun, a leading
 In onesian Communist who left the qountrv f r Russia in 1926,
 will return to Indonesia.   (R FBISI           8 Aug 52)              25X1A
 Comment:   Semaun, one of the founders of the Indonesian
 Communist  arty (PKI), went into exile about 1923.  After
 travelling in Western Europe, he went to Soviet Russia
 where he attended the principal party schools.   In 1950 he
 was reported to have visited  Mao in China.   There is little
 doubt but that he has aided in Soviet Communist planning for
 Indonesia.
 His prospective return to Indonesia, if true, may be
 related to the PKI's current emphasis on united front tactics
 and its claim to support the government.   The party continues
 to criticize the government publicly and undoubtedly continues
 its subversive activity and covert military operations.  The
 possibility exists of a new phase of Communist action involving
 careful direction and more disciplined activity.
 The Indonesian Government's attitude toward Semaun's
 possible return is not clear.  Arrests of Communists have been
 largely discontinued, and Alimin, titular head of the party,
 appeared at a palace function on 22 May.

 19.          Communist parliamentary deputy declares Indian Communists
 possess arms:  During an   August debate in the upper house
 o  the In =an Parliament, Communist deputy Sundarayya declared
 that Indian Communists possess arms which they will surrender
 only if the government promises them amnesty.  He further
 claimed it wp.5 the inherent right of the people to revolt
 against a 'tyrannical government and that those refusing to
 surrender arms under duress are patriots.   (U New Delhi
 582, 9 Aug?, S New Delhi Joint Weeka 29, 9 Aug 52)
 Comment:  This is the first statement of such strength
 made on the 'floor of parliament.   The admission that Indian
 Communists have not abandoned violence as an instrument of
 party policy lends credibility to a fairly reliable June report
 that the Communist Party of India had received new instruc-
 tions to resume violent activity concurrently with peaceful
 united front tactics.
 When the preventive detention
 bill
 currently being
 debated in the upper house becomes
 law,
 as it undoubtedly
 will, the Indian Government will be
 in
 a position to suppress
 any violent activity instigated by
 the
 Communists.
 NEAR EAST - AFRICA
 King Talal of Jordan removed by Parliament:  The Jordanian
 Parliament in joint session on 11  August  voted to depose King
 Talal and to proclaim Crown Prince Hussein as King.
 After considering the medical evidence on Talal's sanity,
 the parliament voted to replace Talal.   The Regency Council which
 recently ruled Jordan was reappointed to    rule until May 1953
 when King Hussein comes of age.   (R Amman 119, 11 Aug 52)
 Comment:  The removal of King Talal and the proclamation
 of Crow     rnce Hussein as King marks the end of the 12-
 month period of uncertainty which followed King Abdullah's
 assassination in 1951.
 The ouster of the king may cause demonstrations similar
 to that which took place in Amman on 8 August protesting
 his rumored replacement.  Political factions may attempt to
 capitalize on any unrest.   The government's competent security
 forces, however, can be expected to suppress any disorders.

 Jordan's neighbors have tried during the past year to
 take advantage of unsettled conditions in the country.   Iraq
 in particular has tried to promote an Iraqi-Jordanian union.
 With the removal of Talal, the newly-established Regency
 Council should effectively protect Jordan's interests.
 21.          Extensive social reforms in Egypt unlikely:   Egyptian
 Prime  finis er Ali Maher has stated   a  He intends to
 initiate extensive social reforms, and he is sincere,accord-
 ing to Ambassador Caffery.  He notes, however, that the last
 five Egyptian governments have all proclaimed their intention
 of effecting sweeping social reforms without any noticeable
 accomplishments.   (C Cairo 315, 9 Aug 52)
 Comment:  Premier Maher and his predecessors have
 conce vi`e of reforms in Western terms.   Fundamental differences
 between East and West make such an approach impossible.   Moslem
 extremists have urged  the establishment of a state based on
 strict adherence to the principles of the Koran.
 in government are deeply embedded in the history and social
 structure of this country.  The idea of sweeping social
 reforms, therefore, is ingenuous.   Sincere efforts to raise
 the standard of living of twenty. million Egyptians must be
 based on a realistic appraisal of the country's economic
 capacity.
 22.         French attitude softens toward Bey's advisory group:
 Rumors now reaching lHe French Residency General Indicate
 that the Bey's new advisory group is finding the greater
 part of the French program acceptable.   Expecting that the
 group will come up with three or four proposals going beyond
 the present French program, a Residency official indicated
 that the French are ready and willing to study any observa-
 tions the Bey may make.  Apparently the visit to Tunisia of
 the Director of the Near East-Africa Division of the French
 Foreign Office has further reduced any tendency toward a
 "take it or leave it" attitude. (C Tunis 45, 8 Aug 52)
 Comment:  A French Foreign Office spokesman informed
 the Amer-man Embassy in Paris that while the official's visit
 was not a complete success, it was much less discouraging than
 press reports implied.   The spokesman added that although
 France cannot go any further in the reform program, minor
 modifications are possible and could be accepted.

 French seen-more flexible on Saar question:  Chancellor
 Adenauer s letter of   August has led the French Foreign Office
 to question German sincerity regarding Europeanization of the
 Saar.    There is every indication, however, that the French want
 to reach agreement in the current negotiations.
 The American, Embassy in Paris believes that when talks
 are resumed on 13 August, Schuman will be willing to discuss a
 surrender of certain French privileges, and perhaps a grant
 of certain advantages to the Germans, but that he will refuse
 to consider, termination of the French-Saar conventions.   The
 Embassy further believes that the question of free elections in
 the Saar is not aninsuperable obstacle, but would be the subject
 of the "very last concession made by the French."    (S Paris
 888, 10 Aug 52; S Strasbourg 24, 10 Aug 52)
 Comment:  The stumbling blocks in the current negotiations
 are the questions of electoral freedom in the Saar, France's
 .special economic privileges, and the cession of a small portion
 of French territory to the Saar as a gesture to save face for
 the Gerata ns .
 24.         Italian railway strike reveals Communist capabilities: The
 24-hour nationwide  railway strike in Italy last week was not
 as successful as previous work stoppages, but did show that the
 Communist-controlled. General Confederation of Labor (CGIL) still
 has "plenty of strength" and is capable of slowing down trans-
 portation to a "point of near emergency," the American Embassy
 in Rome reports.
 Estimates as to the number of railway employees who par-
 ticipated in the strike vary greatly,. the Communist press claim-
 ing 85. percent and the pro-government press only 30 percent.
 The Embassy reports that only about 1,000 trains ran, in compari-
 son with a normal schedule of approximately 6,000?   (R Rome
 610, 8 Aug 52)
 Comment: Communist-organized railway workers retain the
 ability to disrupt and even halt traffic in several key trans-
 portation centers, including Bologna.

 Norwegians urge combined US-NATO visit:  Norwegian naval
 authorities have indicated to the American Embassy that they
 would prefer that the scheduled individual visits of US and
 other countries' fleet units to Norway in September after the
 NATO maneuvers be made under NATO auspices.      The Embassy be-
 lieves that this would lessen public awareness of the extent
 of US participation in the maneuvers and therefore recommends
 that all ships remain under NATO command.    (S Oslo 127,8 Aug 52)
 Comment:   This request to play down the extensive US
 role in the-NATO operation comes at a time of Norwegian sensi-
 tivity to American pressure for the establishment of NATO air
 bases in Norway.
 LATIN AMERICA
 26.          Existence of "Caribbean Cominform" reported:  News re-
 ports or g na  ng in Athens have appeared in the Cuban press
 alleging the existence of a "Communist Central Committee for
 Latin America" with headquarters in Prague as well as a "Carib-
 bean Cominform" charged with the direction of Communist acti-
 vities in the Caribbean countries.   communist activities in
 the French Antilles are said to have been transferred from the
 jurisdiction of the French Communist Party.   (U Havana Desp  73,
 14 July 52)                                  `
 25X1 C
 25X1 C          Comment:  The US Embassy in Havana commenls__i
 believes that this "Cominform" was organized two years ago by
 Fabio Grobart, who allegedly was smuggled out of Cuba by the
 Soviet Charge in Havana and sent to Prague in July 1950.   Re-
 portedly Grobart was the official delegate of the Russian Commu-
 nist Party who collaborated with the Soviet Legation in Havana
 and directed all Communist activities in the Caribbean.
 Evidence of the coordination of all Latin American Commu-
 nist activities by an international organization such as the
 Cominform in Bucharest has been vague and of questionable re-
 liability, as has evidence for the existence of regional bodies
 such as the alleged "Caribbean Cominform."  However, the head-
 quarters of certain international Communist-front organizations
 which maintain contact with Latin America are known to be located
 in Prague, Vienna, East Berlin, and Bucharest.

 27.           Trinidadian left-wing group leader becomes WFTU corre-
 spondent for co ony:   John  a Rose, Secretary General o     e
 left-wing Workers Freedom Movement, has recently become the
 WFTU correspondent for Trinidad.  The US Embassy in Vienna
 comments that this is one of the first visible results of the
 visit to the Caribbean area of Ferdinand C. Smith, WFTU Secre-
 tary for American, Canadian, and Caribbean Affairs.   (C Vienna
 Desp  2103, 24 June 52)
 Comment:    Smith visited the Caribbean region in April
 to urge responsible labor leaders to affiliate with the WFTU
 or at least to support its policies.   La Rose's current re-
 porting to Smith on Trinidad follows the pattern of Communist
 propaganda efforts in other colonial areas of the world and
 is directed toward countering ICFTU activities and exploiting
 local political and economic issues for Communist ends.
