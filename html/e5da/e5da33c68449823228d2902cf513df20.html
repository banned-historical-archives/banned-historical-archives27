 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 1.     The Free World forces in South Vietnam are
 continuing to maintain the pressure on the
 Communists which has so far          e"d the
 development of a major Viet    ng o  ensive
 during the monsoon season.
 We have been able to launch a series
 of successful "spoiling operations"---
 attacks in force into areas where the
 enemy has been trying to concentrate
 forces for large-scale actions.
 1.     These operations have not only
 kept the Communists off balance,
 but have inflicted heavy casualties.
 2.     One good example was Operation
 Hastings, carried out in July in
 northern Quang Tri Province.   U. S.
 Marines and South Vietnamese regulars
 attacked units of the 324-B Division
 of the North Vietnamese army, which
 had infiltrated directly across the
 Demilitarized Zone.

 Approved Foo.Release 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP7O0827A000400100001-2
 3.    In an operation continuing from July
 7 to August 2, the allied forces
 killed 882 men--by actual body count--
 and many more were probably killed by
 tactical air strikes.   The North
 Vietnamese units were forced back into
 the demilitarized zone.
 B.     The North Vietnamese division involved in
 HASTINGS---324B--has a strength of ablut 9,000 men,
 so it was far from being destroyed. As a matter
 of fact, it resumed activity in mid-August,
 and is again being attacked in a follow-on
 operation, called PRAIRIE.
 1.   Through yesterday, another 734 enemy dead
 had been counted in PRAIRIE
 2.    These major spoiling operations are good
 examples of how the allied tactics have
 been able to keep the Communists off
 balance  so that they cannot launch
 major offensives.
 The spoiling operations have been successful
 largely because the allied forces have such
 great mobility, good air support, and
 enemy dispositions and movements.

 C.        In most of the encounters this spring and summer,
 the enemy has not chosen to stand and fight
 as he did in the Ia Drang Valley battle
 last november, in the highlands of Pleiku Province.
 1.    We have to search him out.   In addition to
 the big sweeps, the allied forces maintain
 the pressure with 10 to 15 operations at
 all time  in battalion strength or more.
 2.    These probes had led to a number of small
 but sharp engagements.   aka
 II.           As a result, the Communists have been taking heavy
 casualties, with an average of about 1,550 killed per week.
 "he body count for the first eight months this year
 already exceeds the 35,400 killed in 1965.
 A. The rate of infiltration from North Vietnam,
 however, is also greatly increased.   Apparently
 the Viet Cong are also calling up a larger
 number of their regional guerrillas for the
 main forces.
 1.    The  Communist main force now has more
 than 106,000 men in combat units--1S8
 battalions.
 2.    This includes about 50,000 men in regular
 formations of the North Vietnamese army.

 3.    We believe that there are  9 North
 Vietnamese and 13 Viet Cong regiments.
 B.   Many of the 158 enemy battalions operate as
 independent battalions, or in even smaller
 units.
 25X1 D
 C.   This means that the enemy retains a signi-
 ficant capability for large-scale operations,
 as well as a high level of small actions
 against isolated outposts and smaller allied
 units.
 D.   There is no indication that there has been
 any radical change in the overall Communist
 strategy.   That is to attack in force wherever
 the terrain and other factors are strongly to
 their advantage, and where they believe they
 can achieve victories at the smallest possible
 cost.
 (SOUTH VIETNAMESE POLITICAL SITUATION)
 I.    As for the political situation in South Vietnam,
 the mililtary government of Premier Ky continues
 to maintain the relatively stable position it has
 enjoyed since overcoming the Buddhist "struggle"

 movement last spring.
 A.    Most recently, of course, the election held
 last Sunday has been the center of at.I ention.
 The outcome appears likely to enhance the
 stability of the regime.
 B.    The identities of those elected to tJ
 constituent assemLlv have no particuLAr
 bearing; the significant facts are that
 more than five and a anarter million ?enple
 registered to vote, and that more than
 80 percent of those registered actually
 now                   own-W
 cast their b  l l of s .
 C.    This would appear to be an excellent
 performance in the light of a call by the
 more militant of the Buddhist leaders for
 a boycott, and threats by the Viet Cong
 against candidates and voters.
 1.    Incidents of terrorism and harassment
 by the Viet Conk; were five times as
 high on Election Day as on a normal
 day.   In general, however, the voting
 took place without serious incidents.
 2.    There may have been some padding of the
 rural vote, but observers throughout
 the country found no evidence of
 official coercion, fraud, or other rigging.

 D.    The government, of course, made an
 all-out security effort to prevent Viet
 Cong disruption of the election, but the
 voter turn-out at least indicates that
 in areas    ere 775 -re is a government
 presence            less fear of the Viet
 00-10-
 Cong, and probably less sympathy for their
 cause.
 F.    As for the failure of the Buddhist appeal
 for the faithful to abstain from voting,
 it points up the weakness in secular
 matters of the militants around Thich Tri
 Quang who at present control the po!.'cies
 of the Buddhist Institute.
 II.    There are some internal strains within the
 military government which might ultimately
 cause trouble as the time approaches for the
 installation of an elected government under the
 new constitution now to be drafted.
 A.     These strains, however, in large part do
 not reflect a refusal by the military to
 go along with the constitutional process.
 1.    They reflect instead the rivalry of
 some senior military commanders with
 Premier Ky, and their fear that Ky
 might dismiss them.

 2.    There have also been indications of
 some complaints by some junior officers
 objecting to alleged corruption of their
 superiors.
 3.    None of these strains, however, appear
 so serious or so widespread as to
 threaten Ky's position at this time.
 (NORTH VIETNAM)
 I.     As for North Vietnam, the Hanoi leaders appear as
 determined as ever to continue the war. They have
 rejected all attempts by third parties to get
 negotiations started.
 III
 II.     The level of air strikes against North Vietnam has
 expanded considerably during the past several
 months.
 A.     The major targets are North Vietnamese lines
 of communication, and their POL facilities.
 B.     The North Vietnamese continue, however, to
 be able to move enough men and supplies
 through Laos into South Vietnam to maintain
 the operations of the Communists in the South.
 III.    We have obtained more and more evidence in recent
 months of the extent to which Hanoi is running--
 and taking part in--the war in South Vietnam.

 MAUON BRIEFING
 COM-MUN-TIST CHINA

 I.    The internal political scene in Communist
 China has been marked by turmoil and disarray
 for many months now.   All of the indication-
 are that the situation is still unstable,
 and there may be further upheavals.
 A.   For the past month, mobs of rampaging
 teenagers of the so-called Red Cuard r:av
 kept the coun.ry in a state of disoi'~' ,r
 1. They hav:! be( n roaming the stree ~s
 of all major Chinese cities,
 harassing su pected enemies of :he
 regime and o4z.asionally beating then
 up.
 2.   There havf? been a few reports of
 extensive vi"lence and bloodshed,
 but for the rs,ost part the Red C'iari
 appear to be a disciplined and well-
 controlled or~,;anization.
 3.   In the past veek  or so, their activities
 have subsided somewhat.
 B.    The destructive an-_ics of these teei?.agers
 have tended Co divert public attenticn
 from far more important development:.

 within the party leadership.   It appears
 to us that the top power structure of the
 party is undergoing its most massive
 shake-up in the history of the Chinese
 Communist regime.
 (BRIEFING BOARD, CHICOM LEADERSHIP)
 II.    Massive demonstrations in Peking on the 18th and
 31st of August and on September 15th featured what
 appears to be a new line-up of the party's
 top policy-making body, the politburo.
 A.   Mao Tse-tung still dominates the leadership,1
 but Defense Minister
 Lin Piao has taken
 the place of Mao's long-time deputy,
 ftv~
 Liu Shao-chi.
 1.   Liu has been tie titular chief of
 state.   Then  has been no announce-
 ment that he has lost that position,
 and he is still a member of the
 politburo, but he has been dropped
 ignominiously from second to eighth
 place.
 B.    As for Mao himself, we are not sure just
 how much control he still exercises over
 day-to-day events, or how long he wil?. last.

 III.    Mao's new deputy, Lin Piao, is not in much
 better health.
 A.    Lin is one of the youngest men in the polit-
 buro at 59, b=it he has been ill for much
 of the past 30 years, probably with
 tuberculosis.
 25X1 .B
 2.    His life expectancy is probably not
 much more than five years.
 IV.    Mao, however, appears to have chosen Lin to be
 his successor in spite of Lin's frailty.   We
 think this must reflect Mao's grow
 wow"
 of other elements of the leadership.
 A.     Perhaps the most significant aspect of
 the recent changes has been the break-up
 of the group of leaders which had been
 unnin
 he past
 decade.
 1.   Liu Shao-chi was the leading member
 of that group.

 2.    The General Secretary of the Party,
 Teng Hsiao-ping, is another leading
 member of that group.  He has been
 weakened, but not as much as Liu.
 3.    A couple of months ago, in fact,
 Teng appeared to have gained in the
 shake-up.   All that has changed.
 Teng is still in the inner circle of
 Mao's advisors, but he has slipped
 from third or fourth place to sixth
 place in the power structure.
 leaders close to Lin. and cov_er_nmemt
 figures like Chou En-lai, have risen in
 importance.
 V.    For many years now, it had appeared to us that
 the leaders of the party machinery--men like
 Liu Shao-chi--enjoyed Mao's full trust.
 A.     They not only had a long record of personal
 loyalty to Mao; their radical approach
 was also in accord with his.
 B.     This situation presents us with a
 puzzling contradiction, especially in
 regard to its policy implications:

 Mao is a marently intent on pushing
 through    radical program to reshape
 Chinesc society.   It appears to be so
 radical that the party rank-anb i i.1e
 could not he trusted to carry it out.
 The Re  Guard had to be created.
 2.    There is, therefore, no satisfactory
 explanation for Mao's willingness to
 turn against his old comrades who
 appeared to share his radical views.
 3.    The government administrators and
 economic specialists who have been
 retained or even promoted--men like
 Chou En-lal, Chen Yun, and Li ! u-chKn--
 are the r e.loT ively moderate members of
 the politburo.

 unstable.     The events of the past ten months oust
 have intensified the aitagonisms and mistrust
 among those leaders who have survived the purge.

 It is also far from clear whether or not
 the new leaders are going to institute

 change in Pek_i;?g'   policy of implacable
 hostility towaid the United States.
 ;FOREIGN POLICY)
 1.    In general, the Peking leaders have been so
 pre-occupied with t ?ou',,les at home that they
 have been marking time on foreign policy.

 A.    The first  U.  S. attacks on North Vietnam?s
 POL storage facilities on June 29th pro-
 vided a short-lived barrage of propa-
 ganda.
 1.   Peking triel to convey the impression
 that China was more determined than
 ever to assist Hanoi in resisting
 this new escalo.tion.
 2.     But the Chinese declarations of
 "resolute support" for the Vietnamese
 did not exhibit the ring of enthusi-
 asm that had marked similar state-
 ments on the subject a year ago.   The
 emphasis was on self-reliance by the
 Vietnamese.
 B.     Peking, however, appears to be just
 determined as ever that the North Viet-
 namese must continue the war.
 1. After the September 7th meeting of
 the U. S.:.,and Chinese Communist ambassa-
 dors in Warsaw, the Chinese Ambassador
 released a statement attacking what he
 called the "U.S. peace talks swindle."
 Ambassador Want= repeated that China would
 support Hanoi against the U. S. to the end.

 C.    Those Chinese protests last week abou`:. recent
 violations of Chinese air space did not have
 any threats of counter-action. For all the
 bluster of Chinese propaganda, Peking's
 reaction to these incidents has been cautious.
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 III.   The Sino-Soviet dispute has flared up again,
 but there is no indication that this marks a
 significant change in relations between the
 two countries.
 A.      Mass demonstrations by Red Guards outside
 the Soviet Embassy in Peking on Augus^.:
 29th and 30th were evidently intended
 as a reply to a Soviet diplomatic note
 delivered on August 26th which had pro-
 tested earlier "acts of hooliganism" com-
 mitted by the Red Guards in the vicinity
 of the embassy.
 1.    The Chinese took care, however, to
 prevent the thousands of people who
 took part in tlYe demonstrations from
 getting out of hand and damaging the
 Soviet Embassy.
 2.    This suggests Peking is not willing to
 push the Soviets too far.

 B.           Peking's most recent blast at Moscow
 was a People's Dail    article on
 September 8th, which accused Moscow
 of collaborating with the U. S. to
 "sell out the. Vietnamese."
 The article called the Soviets
 "renegades,"    "termites of the
 working class," and "scum in the
 revolutionary ranks."
 Moscow has maintained a general posture
 of restraint, but the Soviet press is
 quoting liberally from criticism of
 China in the foreign Communist press.
 It has recently sharpened the tone of
 its own commentary on China.
 1.     In recent weeks, the Moscow papers
 have also re-printed some of the
 more extreme Chinese statements in
 connection with the Red Guard, to
 let the teen-age antics speak for
 themselves.

 MAHON BRIEFING
 THAILAND
 1.     You may have noticed some press reports over the
 week-end to the effect that the Thai government
 had ended the secrecy over U. S. military
 operations in Thailand.
 A.     An American columnist, Richard Wilson,
 claimed he had been told by the Thai.
 Deputy Defense Minister, Dawee,(Dah-WEE)
 that U. S. troops are participating in
 joint operations against the Communist
 insurgents in northeastern Thailand.
 B.    The Thai government in Bangkok has
 issued prompt and categorical denials
 of the Wilson story.  We are inclined to
 believe that Dawee did not make the
 statement, and anyway the denial is
 correct.
 1.   Prime Minister Thanom (Tah-NAWM)
 and his Deputy, General Praphat,(Prah-POT)
 have both made it clear to us that
 they feel the Thai forces can handle
 the insurgents.

 2.    The Thai government has specifically
 rejected any use of U. S. combat
 troops in the counter-insurgency
 effort.
 3.    We are, of course, giving them some
 advice and support for counter-
 insurgency.
 IT.     The use of bases in Thailand for U. S. aircraft
 operating against the Vietnamese Communists
 remains an open secret --- neither government
 has admitted it yet.
 A.    All that has been admitted is that the
 U. S. has air bases in Thailand.
