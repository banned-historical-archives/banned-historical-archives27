 VIETNAM
 North Vietnam is augmenting its jet fighter strength
 and building a second surface-to-air missile site near
 Hanoi.  As the North prepares to meet new air attacks,
 the level of the Viet Cong's sabotage and harassing
 actions and the intensity of their military attacks
 rose sharply in the South.  There are mounting indica-
 tions of a marked improvement in Soviet - North Viet-
 namese relations and a corresponding increasing dis-
 pleasure in Peiping.
 THE COMMUNIST WORLD
 SOVIETS DISPLAY NEW WEAPONS
 Among the five weapons shown for the first time in the
 9 May Moscow parade were two probable solid-propellant
 surface-to-surface missiles--one an ICBM--and a liquid-
 propellant vehicle described as an "orbital rocket" ca-
 pable of attacking targets "from any direction."  Also
 displayed for the first time were an antitank missile
 and the T-62 medium tank.
 SOVIET LUNAR SOFT-LANDING ATTEMPT AN APPARENT FAILURE            9
 The wording of the Soviet announcement of a "hit"
 strongly suggest that the probe was destroyed on impact.
 SINO-SOVIET TRADE APPARENTLY STILL DECLINING
 TASS announcement of the 1965 trade pact did not men-
 tion further Soviet sales of petroleum products.  China's
 export volume may be smaller, since it no longer needs a
 large surplus to repay its debts to the USSR.
 SOVIET INTERNATIONAL FISHING OPERATIONS GROW
 The fleet is expanding in traditional North Atlantic
 and North Pacific fishing grounds and moving into Carib-
 bean and African waters.  The USSR is seeking new bases
 for its fishing operations in the southwest Atlantic and
 east Indian Ocean.

 Honors have been conferred on writers severely criti-

 A speech last week by party chief Zhivkov--the regime's

 actions, a Viet Cong force of
 three battalions attacked Song
 Be, the capital of Phuoc Long
 Province, about 75 miles north
 of Saigon, in the first large-
 scale effort against a provin-
 cial capital in over three
 years.  A government heliborne
 operation just north of Saigon
 was put to rout by Communist re-
 sistance.   Other large-scale
 actions took place in southern-
 most An Xuyen Province and in
 Hau Nghia Province west of
 Saigon.
 It is too early to tell if
 the present upward swing, which
 began in late April, will differ
 significantly from past seasonal
 offensive periods.   Most of the
 current Viet Cong activity has
 been centered in the southern
 part of the country, but this
 may be a diversionary tactic
 prior to a major thrust in the
 northern provinces.   There con-
 tinue to be reports of large
 Viet Cong troop concentrations
 in these provinces, particularly
 in the Quang Tin - Quang Ngai
 border area and in northwest
 Kontum Province.
 Unconnected with this con-
 centration but indicative of
 the growth in Viet Cong strength
 over the years, a recent joint
 US - South Vietnamese reappraisal
 of order of battle holdings on
 Viet Cong main force units car-
 ries as confirmed some 47,000
 combat regulars compared with
 the previous figure of 39,000.
 The new order of battle accepts
 nine Viet Cong regimental head-
 quarters (up from five), and 61
 regular battalions (up from 54),
 including a confirmed North
 Vietnamese unit in Kontum Prov-
 ince.   It also includes 17,600
 Viet Cong support and line-of-
 communications troops, bringing
 total regular strength to 64,600.
 Although this figure reflects
 some recent growth through re-
 cruitment and infiltration,
 the upward revision results
 for the most part from firmer
 identification of units al-
 ready in place.
 Communist Political Developments
 There are mounting indica-
 tions of a marked improvement
 in Soviet - North Vietnamese
 relations and a corresponding
 increasing displeasure in Pei-
 ping as the influence of its
 main rival increases.   Hanoi's
 celebration of the 20th anni-
 versary of V-E Day, for example,
 was marked by unusually warm
 demonstrations of Vietnamese
 support for the USSR.   Not only
 did the top three leaders send
 a special greeting to the So-
 viet leadership but they also
 attended a mass rally and a
 reception at the Soviet Em-
 bassy.  At the ambassadorial
 reception the Soviet ambassador
 referred to the recent improve-
 ment in relations and declared
 that they were "consolidating
 and developing" from day to
 day.

 of views" between the USSR and
 the DRV on ways and means of
 countering US intervention in
 Vietnam.
 Privately, however, ranking
 Soviet officials told Western
 diplomats that Soviet aid was
 still limited in scope, warned
 of the dangers of escalation,
 and expressed concern about an
 alleged "serious turn" in US
 foreign policy.   Party presidium
 member Shelepin, in a 7 May con-
 versation with the US Army at-
 tach6, urged the US to find
 some way out of the impasse on
 the Vietnam situation.   In sub-
 sequent talks with the British
 and Israeli ambassadors, how-
 ever, Shelepin repeated the
 standard Soviet argument that
 negotiations are impossible as
 long as US air strikes continue.
 Peiping publicly discussed
 the possibility of negotiations
 for the first time in months,
 but the context made it clear
 that this was an attempt to
 counter whatever influence Mos-
 cow might be exerting on the
 Vietnamese toward negotiations.
 In two authoritative statements
 related to the V-E Day anni-
 versary celebrations--a People's
 Daily editorial on 9 May an  a
 'RedFlag article on 10 May--
 P ieie ping stated that negotiations
 with imperialists were sometimes
 necessary as long as the "basic
 interests of the people" were
 not violated.   However, the
 statements emphasized that agree-
 ments of this nature were a
 temporary "tactic" and made it
 clear that discussions with the
 enemy were part of the standard
 Chinese Communist tactic of
 "fight-talk-fight-talk."  The
 main thrust of both statements
 was to warn of the dangers of
 a "Munich" in negotiations,
 and the Red Flag article went
 further tFain previous Chinese
 public statements in warning
 that Peiping would go on sup-
 porting the Vietnamese people
 whether or not the US bombed
 China.
 People's Daily's "Observer"
 on 12  any also raised the issue
 of negotiations in a clear at-
 tack on the Soviet position.
 Referring to Secretary Rusk's
 speech of 3 May as a "trap,"
 the article asserted that to
 agree to enter into negotiations
 on condition that the US stop
 bombing North Vietnam is tanta-
 mount to acknowledging that the
 US was justified in the bombings.
 "Observer" reiterated Peiping's
 standard position that unless
 US "aggression" is stopped and
 US troops withdrawn from Viet-
 nam, restoration of peace in
 Vietnam "will be out of the
 question."
 Further evidence of Pei-
 ping's mounting concern over
 Moscow's "revisionist" influ-
 ence with Hanoi was reflected
 in four violent propaganda at-
 tacks on the Soviet leadership
 this week.   In the most unusual
 one, People's Daily on 7 May
 carried    full-page account--
 complete with pictures and gory
 details--of an alleged Soviet
 suppression of a major anti-US
 demonstration involving Viet-
 namese students in Leningrad
 on 3 April.  Neither Hanoi nor

 Moscow had mentioned such an
 incident,  and the fact that Pei-
 ping waited a month before pub-
 licizing it suggests tha'  if it
 did occur the Chinese delay may
 have been due to attempts by
 Peiping to prod Hanoi into some
 public response.   Having failed
 in this, Peiping apparently de-
 cided to go ahead on its own in
 hopes of creating friction be-
 tween Hanoi and Moscow, or with-
 in the North Vietnamese party.
 Political Developments

 Premier Quat has strength-

 self-dissolution of the Armed
 Forces Council,  a potential ri-
 val authority,  but the proffered
 resignations of military minis-
 ters from his cabinet, just as
 he was about to reshuffle sev-

 fronted him with new problems.
 These difficulties may be re-
 solved by his reported decision

 eral Thieu as defense minister
 with increased responsibilities.
 Although retention of Cath-
 olics Minh and Thieu should
 mitigate Catholic alarm over a
 Buddhist-inspired purge, a re-
 cent Catholic resolution charg-
 ing the government with bowing
 to thinly disguised Communist
 pressure reflects heightened
 religious tension.
 Concern that the
 return of former junta leader
 General "Big" Minh from "exile"
 in Bangkok might encourage fur-
 ther political intrigues ap-
 parently prompted Quat and his
 top generals to order air force
 planes to turn back a commercial
 aircraft bringing Minh to Saigon
 on 12 May.

 Five weapons were displayed
 for the first time In Moscow on
 9 May at the parade marking the
 20th anniversary of the defeat
 of Germany.   Included in the
 showing were two probable solid-
 propellant surface-to-surface
 missiles--one an ICBM--and a
 liquid-propellant vehicle de-
 scribed by the Soviets as an
 "orbital rocket" capable of at-
 tacking targets "from any direc-
 tion."
 In connection with the
 parade display of new and known
 weapons,  the Soviets are giving
 wide distribution to a film
 showing many modern offensive
 and defensive weapons in opera-
 tion.   The parade and film ap-
 pear to be part of a major ef-
 fort to impress bloc and foreign
 audiences with the strength of
 the Soviet military arm.
 The liquid-propellant mis-
 sile is more than 100 feet long
 and appears to have three stages.
 This weapon has not yet been
 specifically equated to any
 known missile system.
 The solid-propellant ICBM
 is about 60  feet   long, has
 three stages, and is similar in
 size and appearance to the US
 Minuteman.   Preliminary analysis
 of the  reentry vehicle indicates
 it can carry a warhead of about
 500 pounds.   The Soviets claim
 that it can be launched from a
 silo.
 Another weapon identified
 as a solid propellant missile
 was carried in a pod on a self-
 propelled launcher.   In a pri-
 vate conversation, Marshal
 Krylov, chief of the Soviet
 Strategic Rocket Forces,
 claimed that the missile has a
 range of more than 2,000 miles,
 but considerably more analysis
 is required before Krylov's
 claim can be proved or dis-
 proved.
 Also shown   for   the first
 time was an antitank missile
 about half the length of the
 earlier Snapper and Swatter
 antitank missiles.   The missile,
 whose mode of guidance is un-
 clear, is mounted as a cluster
 of six on the rear of an am-
 phibious scout car.
 The T-62 medium tank,
 adopted by the USSR in 1961,
 also was paraded for the first
 time.   It carries a 115-milli-
 meter smooth-bore cannon.
 The Ganef, an air-breath-
 ing ramjet  missile unveiled in
 May 1964, was placed behind
 antiaircraft guns this time,
 suggesting that it has a ground
 force   air defense role.   Last
 November,  it was paraded in
 the surface-to-surface missile
 section.

 The Soviet lunar probe, des-
 ignated Lunik-5, has apparently
 failed in an attempt to soft
 land instruments on the moon.
 The Soviets have announced
 that Lunik-5,  launched on 9 May,
 "hit" the moon in the area of
 the Sea of Clouds at approxi-
 mately 3:10 p.m.  EDT,  12 May.
 This use of the word "hit"
 strongly sug-
 gest that the probe was destroyed
 on impact.   Moreover, the So-
 viets stated that the "flight
 and approach" of Lunik-5 pro-
 vided "a great deal of informa-
 tion... necessary for the fur-
 ther processing of a system for
 a soft landing on the moon's
 surface."
 Despite this apparent So-
 viet attempt to conceal a fail-
 ure to achieve a soft landing,
 Lunik-5 still represents at
 least a partial success in a.
 program marked by failure.

 SINO-SOVIET TRADE APPARENTLY STILL DECLINING
 Reports on the recently
 signed Sino-Soviet trade pact
 for 1965 suggest a continuation
 of the decline in trade that
 began in 1960.
 the TASS announce
 ment of the pact did not mention
 further sales of petroleum prod-
 ucts.
 Under the 1965 pact,  the
 USSR will again supply China
 with IL-18 transport aircraft,
 as well as with helicopters--
 probably the M41-6--motor vehi-
 cles,                        farm equipment,  and vari-
 ous types of industrial hard-
 ware.   In exchange,  Peiping will
 continue to export traditional
 goods, mainly  textiles, agricul-
 tural items,  and minerals.   The
 volume of its exports may be
 much smaller this year,  however,
 since it no longer needs to
 maintain a large surplus  in its
 trade with the Soviet Union to
 repay its debts.   Although
 TASS said both sides "show?d
 a desire" for more trade and
 a "wish" to hold talks on fur-
 ther exchanges, meaningful ne-
 gotiations are unlikely in the
 current political situation.
 The volume of trade has
 dropped steadily, from a 1959
 peak of $2 billion which ac-
 counted for almost half of
 China's foreign trade, to less
 than $500 million in 1964.  Con-
 comitantly,  the Chinese have
 turned increasingly to the free
 world for goods previously pur-
 chased from the Soviets.                                                                           Since
 mid-1963, Peiping has contracted
 for about $100 million worth
 of free world industrial plants
 to be built over the next few
 years.   Trade with non-Communist
 areas increased about 25 percent
 last year to about $1.9 billion,
 accounting for over 60 percent
 of China's foreign trade.               25X1

 The Soviet fishing fleet--
 already the world's largest--not
 only is expanding in traditional
 North Atlantic and North Pacific
 fishing grounds but during the
 past three years has moved into
 Caribbean and African waters and
 now seeks new fishing bases in
 the southwest Atlantic and the
 east Indian Ocean.
 Moscow's fishing research
 vessels now operate widely in in-
 ternational waters and establish
 the basis for extension of Soviet
 fishing operations and agreements
 for land-based facilities.   Re-
 search vessels currently are ex-
 ploring waters off Ceylon and
 Uruguay.   This has led to a de-
 tailed Soviet proposal for estab-
 lishment of a Soviet-aided Ceylo-
 nese fishing industry, and feel-
 ers have been extended in Monte-
 video.
 Fishing facilities ranging
 from canneries to fishing ports
 already are under construction in
 several underdeveloped countries.
 Although in most cases construc-
 tion is designed to inaugurate
 or support indigenous fishing ef-
 forts,  it also serves Soviet fish-
 ing operations.   Frequently the
 fish for processing are supplied
 at first by the Soviet fleet.
 These arrangements already have
 assisted in Soviet exploitation
 of South Atlantic and Indian Ocean
 fishing grounds.
 Although much emphasis is
 placed on investigating new areas,
 the traditional North Atlantic
 and Alaskan fishing grounds are
 not neglected.   Since 1962, fleets
 operating there have increased
 considerably in size.
 The North Atlantic and Pa-
 cific fleets are based in Soviet
 ports and include vessels for
 storing and preserving the catch.
 The vessels in the Caribbean oper-
 ate out of Havana, while those in
 African waters use fishing facili-
 ties developed under Soviet aid
 programs and include a wide variety
 of specialized ships which process
 the catch.
 The Soviet fishing fleet, al-
 ready the most modern in the
 world, continues to be improved.
 Recent acquisitions range from $1-  25X1
 million trawlers to $15-million
 fish-processing refrigerator
 mother ships.
 Continuing purchases of ships for
 the fishing fleet, despite general
 cutbacks in purchases abroad of
 industrial equipment, clearly indi-
 cate Soviet intent to move ahead
 with international fishing opera-
 tions.

 The widespread lack of en-
 thusiasm for party programs in
 Hungary has moved the Kadar re-
 gime to seek support from those
 dissident writers and intellec-
 tuals dominating the literary
 scene whom it apparently sees
 as the key to reducing public
 indifference and pessimism.
 Since early April, honors
 have been conferred on several
 writers who had been severely
 criticized in the past.   On 4
 April Hungary's top literary
 award was granted to Lajos Kas-
 sak, a socialist writer who
 joined the "conspiracy of si-
 lence," i.e., refused to pub-
 lish, after the 1956 revolt and
 has been a symbol of Hungarian
 writers' resistance to regime
 controls.   Since he began pub-
 lishing again, his works have
 been attacked in the party
 press for having an "anti-hu-
 manist, pessimist" bias.
 A lesser prize was awarded
 to Gabor Garai, a young modern-
 ist and disciple of Kassak,
 though not an outstanding critic
 of the regime.
 The doughty Marxist philos-
 opher Gyorgy Lukacs, who partic-
 ipated in the 1956 Nagy govern-
 ment and was briefly imprisoned,
 received public congratulations
 and testimonials in mid-April
 on his 80th birthday.   These
 honors were permitted even
 though he had recently repeated
 the outspoken criticism of the
 regime's interpretation of "so-
 cialist realism" for which the
 party press censured him last
 year.
 The April issue of the
 party's theoretical journal con-
 tained new "ideological guide-
 lines" which, although they
 still stress the perils of ide-
 ological laxity and the need for
 firmer party leadership, favor
 persuasion rather than "adminis-
 trative measures"--i.e.,  intimi-
 dation--and authorize the pub-
 lication of dissenting ideologi-
 cal views, even if they are
 "alien to the socialist order."
 In a commentary published
 along with the guidelines, Hun-
 gary's chief ideologist, Istvan
 Szirmai, reviewed the regime's
 concern over popular indiffer-
 ence and admitted its continu-
 ing failure to gain the support
 of Hungarian youth.   His remarks
 reflected the difficulties in-
 volved in providing an accept-
 able substitute for the appeals
 of Western civilization. Szirmai
 made it   clear, however, that
 despite the ideological inroads
 of Western culture, Hungary
 intends to continue the devel-
 opment  of political and cul-
 tural contacts with the West.

 Preparations for the trial
 of the recently apprehended
 plotters against the Bulgarian
 regime appear to be largely com-
 pleted,  although no date has
 been announced.
 In a speech in Sofia on 8
 May, party chief Todor Zhivkov
 made the first official admis-
 sion to the Bulgarian public
 that an antiregime  plot was un-
 covered early last month.   His
 remarks appeared calculated to
 prepare the public for the line
 that will be taken at the trial
 and simultaneously to give no-
 tice that the regime is in full
 control of the situation.
 Zhivkov emphatically de-
 nounced Western accounts of mil-
 itary involvement and specif-
 ically absolved the Bulgarian of-
 ficer corps.   Nevertheless, he
 conceded that there are "some
 servicemen"  among the  plotters,
 whom he characterized as "mis-
 erable adventurists," and "un-
 principled lovers of power"
 SECRET
 Page 15
 numbering "less than the fin-
 gers on two hands."
 The three plotters named
 by the regime thus far include
 only one military man, General
 Tsvetko Anev,  commandant of the
 Sofia garrison.
 General Ivan Buchvarov  and his
 deputy also are under arrest.
 Buchvarov,   a central committee
 member, was removed from an im-
 portant post in the party   ap-
 paratus last December.
 Zhivkov appears to have
 passed through this latest po-
 litical strife without seriously
 jeopardizing his support from
 Moscow.   He has indicated by his
 actions, moreover,  that he will
 not make important policy changes
 as a result of the coup, although
 a shake-up of the security ap-
 paratus still seems likely.

 Tensions are easing in the
 disputed Rann of Kutch, and both
 India and Pakistan have avoided
 provoking incidents in other
 areas where troops are massed.
 The danger of large-scale clashes
 persists,  however.
 Following the Indian build-
 up of about 120,000 men opposite
 the Punjab region of West Paki-
 stan,                               Pakistan completed a pro-
 tective redeployment of about
 70,000 men by last week end. Op-
 posing forces are separated by
 only a few hundred yards in many
 places, and the situation there
 remains tense.
 In the immediate area of
 the Rann of Kutch, however,
 there has been a substantial re-
 laxation since the fighting
 ended on 26 April.   Intensive
 British   a !ox"s to come up with
 a formal cease-fire agreement
 have continued.   New Delhi has
 reportedly begun to withdraw
 some of its troops from Kutch,
 which reverts to marshland at
 this time of year.
 Delhi's arrest of the Kash-
 miri Muslim leader Sheikh Abdul-
 lah upon his return from Mecca
 on 8 May has added a new threat
 to the peace of the subconti-
 nent.   Following the arrest, Mus-
 lim agitation in  Indian Kashmir
 was quickly crushed to prevent
 its spread elsewhere in Pakistan
 or India.   Communal passions are
 easily aroused,  however, and
 rioting could break out at any
 time and inspire border clashes.
 During the past week,  the
 United States has come under
 heavy fire in the Indian Parlia-
 ment as Indians have sought a
 scapegoat for reverses suffered
 in Kutch.   Delhi now considers
 Pakistan's deployment of US-sup-
 plied tanks the key to Pakistan's
 recent successes.   Rather than
 acknowledge US efforts to re-
 strain both sides from using
 US-supplied military equipment,
 the Shastri regime seems to have
 played up to this parliamentary
 outcry.
 At the same time Shastri's
 visit to Moscow, which began on
 12 May, has occasioned renewed
 enthusiasm for the USSR.   Although
 any tendency by Western observers
 to equate India and Pakistan in
 the Kutch dispute has consist-
 ently  evoked deep resentment in
 India, similar impartiality by
 Moscow seems to have been ac-
 cepted with equanimity.   On 8
 May the USSR called for a set-
 tlement "by way of direct talks
 with due consideration for the
 interests of both sides." Rather
 than complain, Shastri, before
 enplaning for Moscow,  thanked
 the USSR for "standing by India
 in times of trial."
 This neutral position by
 the Soviets has presumably been
 carefully noted by Pakistani of-
 ficials, who hope eventually to
 persuade the USSR to stop block-
 ing UN Security Council action
 in the Kashmir dispute, as it has
 done for the last nine years at
 India's behest.

 the approval and backing of a
 conference of major tribes and
 by decreeing a new interim con-
 stitution.  Moves to overcome
 initial dissatisfaction with
 the new government by Saudi
 Arabia and the royalist tribes
 are already under way, as is a
 search for assistance in these
 efforts from other Arab coun-
 tries.
 The government of Premier
 Ahmad Numan, which contains a
 majority of cabinet members
 outspokenly opposed to Egyptian
 domination of Yemen, is walking
 a tightrope.   It seeks to main-
 tain enough of an anti-Egyptian
 posture to capture the support
 of the increasingly anti-Egyp-
 tian republican countryside
 while at the same time temper-
 ing its actions enough to avoid
 incurring Egyptian suspicion
 that Numan is too dangerous to
 use as a vehicle to the settle-
 ment of the Yemeni civil war.
 So far, Numan seems to be
 succeeding.   Last week's tribal
 conference at Khamir passed
 resolutions which set the stage
 for a resumption of peace talks
 with the royalists, nodded po-
 litely to both Saudi Arabia and
 Egypt, midly supported the lib-
 eration of southern Arabia, and
 sought assistance of all Arab
 countries for "cooperation in
 the maintenance of peace."
 Egypt's massive propaganda
 apparatus has publicized the
 Khamir conference as a success
 for Numan.

 Rhodesian Prime Minister
 Smith's overwhelming victory in
 last week's parliamentary elec-
 tion strengthens his hand to
 resume negotiations with London
 regarding independence and in
 the meantime to initiate con-
 stitutional amendments designed
 to consolidate white minority
 control.   While Smith continues
 to voice the threat of a uni-
 lateral declaration of independ-
 ence as a last resort, he appar-
 ently has been sobered by oppo-
 sition from local business groups
 as well as by London's warning
 of stringent sanctions.
 Smith's Rhodesia Front
 swept all of the 50 seats elected
 by the predominantly white "A"
 roll.   It entered no candidates
 for the 15 seats representing
 the mostly African "B" roll.   On
 the basis of incomplete returns,
 the opposition Rhodesia Party
 has definitely elected only two
 Africans on the "B" roll, with
 the remaining 13 seats probably
 going to African independents.
 None of the 15 African candidates
 who may be included in the par-
 liamentary opposition is known
 to be connected with the African
 nationalists who boycotted the
 election.
 Having gained the two-thirds
 parliamentary majority required
 to initiate amendments to the
 1961 constitution, Smith prob-
 ably will push through the re-
 visions he discussed vaguely
 during the campaign.   Several
 are designed to show a semblance
 of progress for the Africans.
 The standing of the tribal chiefs.
 who receive government subsidies,
 would be bolstered so that they
 might supplant the nationalist
 politicians as leaders of Rho-
 desia's 4 million Africans. The
 "B roll" franchise, which now
 is limited by property and edu-
 cational qualifications, may be
 extended to all taxpayers, in-
 cluding Africans in the tribal
 reserves, who probably would
 vote for their chiefs.   However,
 the Africans, who outnumber the
 whites in Rhodesia almost 20
 to 1, would still elect only a
 small minority of the legisla-
 tors.
 The projected amendments
 may constitute bargaining tac-
 tics in the face of London's
 opposition to independence un-
 less eventual majority rule is
 assured.   Although Smith's vic-
 tory statement held out the
 prospect of obtaining independ-
 ence by negotiation, in the
 background was a white paper
 purporting to prove Rhodesia's
 capability for weathering Brit-
 ish sanctions if need be.
 The implicit threat to
 declare independence unilater-
 ally could be carried out if
 London rejects the constitutional
 amendments as a subterfuge de-
 signed to thwart, rather than
 promote, majority rule.   If
 London accepts them on the other
 hand,  Smith might cite such
 "progress" as providing an ac-
 ceptable alternative to full
 independence,  at least for the
 time being.

 EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION TO HOLD "SUMMIT" MEETING
 The first "summit" session
 of the European Free Trade As-
 sociation  (EFTA)  since that
 seven-nation organization was
 formed in 1959 will be held in
 Vienna on 24 and 25 May.   Brit-
 ish Prime Minister Wilson is
 largely responsible for upgrad-
 ing the meeting to prime-minis-
 ter level, and he has promised
 to make proposals for "building
 bridges" linking EFTA with the
 EEC.
 Most EFTA members recognize
 that they must strengthen their
 organization if it is to achieve
 its original purpose--a stronger
 negotiating position with respect
 to the EEC.   In particular,  they
 want to restrain unilateral UK
 initiatives toward the EEC,
 limit the effects of a possible
 Austrian "defection" to the EEC,
 and prevent any similar move by
 the Eanes.
 The conditions laid down by
 the EEC for Austria's association
 are incompatible with its con-
 tinued participation in EFTA.  In
 defending its case for EEC ties
 at the Vienna meeting, the Aus-
 train Government may argue that
 the benefits it derives from
 EFTA are meager.   By way of il-
 lustration, it might launch
 another attack on the UK's uni-
 lateral imposition of import sur-
 charges last year.
 Aside from what may happen
 in Vienna, sentiment for strength-
 ening EFTA is likely to increase,
 Page  23
 especially should the Kennedy
 Round prove ineffective in re-
 ducing barriers to trade.   With
 prospects that the tariff ne-
 gotiations in Geneva will be
 prolonged, speculation is al-
 ready growing about exclusive
 EFTA-EEC tariff reductions and
 perhaps "deals" between the
 EEC and individual Scandinavian
 countries on specific items.
 Seen in this context, the
 strengthening of EFTA could work
 to the advantage of its members'
 bargaining position either with-
 in the Kennedy Round or as a
 "supplement" to it,
 Development of EFTA seems
 headed, on the one hand, toward
 more effective consultative
 mechanisms--designed to prevent
 such actions as the UK's sur-
 charge move--and, on the other,
 toward making EFTA more nearly
 the basis for an economic union
 similar to the EEC.   EFTA in-
 dustrialists, trade unionists,
 and government officials favored
 widening the scope of EFTA at
 a meeting in Helsinki last week
 and the Scandinavians are ex-
 pected to adopt a similar posi-
 tion at a meeting of the Nordic
 Council in Oslo this week.
 The EEC countries would
 react cautiously to any new
 overtures that may emerge from
 the Vienna meeting.   There is a
 widespread desire within the
 EEC for narrowing the gap be-
 tween the two blocs., illustrated
 by recent EEC Commission

 The Social Christians and
 the Socialists who have ruled
 Belgium in coalition since 1961
 may lose some electoral support
 in the elections on 23 May, but
 not enough to unseat their gov-
 ernment.   The Social Christians
 are likely to lose strength to
 Flemish nationalists and to the
 business-oriented Liberals,
 while the Socialists may drop
 some votes to French-speaking
 extremists in southern Belgium.
 Gains by the Liberals,  normally
 to be expected in view of the
 Belgian tendency to vote against
 the parties in power, promise
 to be limited by the negative
 image created by the party's re-
 fusal to support  legislation
 aimed at reducing friction
 Austria's presidential elec-
 tion on 23 May promises to be
 close, with the odds slightly
 in favor of Socialist Franz
 Jonas over former chancellor Al-
 fons Gorbach,  the nominee of
 the conservative People's Party.
 Socialists have won all three
 presidential contests since
 World War II, but the People's
 Party have always held the chan-
 cellorship, a more powerful post.
 As mayor of Vienna, Jonas
 will have the advantage of sup-
 port from   a cohesive, well-
 disciplined party organization
 in Austria's largest election
 between Belgium's French- and
 rutch-speaking groups.

 likely to lead the postelection

 sarily Prime Minister Lefevre

 party.   Paul Vanden Boeynants,
 the popular 46-year-old party
 president is among the leading
 candidates for the premiership.
 Henri Spaakc, a Socialist and
 the architect of Belgian cooper-
 ation with the United States on
 Congo policy, will probably stay
 on as foreign minister.   He has
 expressed a preference for the
 job, and virtually removed him-

 fit from the view of most Aus-
 trians that good government
 will be best served if the two

 two highest elective offices.
 Gorbach will benefit from

 what is an essentially nonpar-
 tisan office.   He is also bet-
 ter known nationally by virtue
 of his tenure as chancellor
 from 1961 to 1964.

 The newly formed loyalist
 government in the Dominican Re-
 public, headed by Antonio   Im-
 bert, has been unable to seize
 the political initiative from
 the rebel regime of Francisco
 Caamano, and little progress
 has been made toward a compro-
 mise solution.   The US forces
 there will eventually become
 part of an inter-American force
 under the control of the Organ-
 ization of American States (OAS).
 The US and OAS Presence
 Some 22,700 US troops, sup-
 plemented by 38 naval combat and
 supply ships, are maintaining
 an uneasy truce supervised by a
 five-nation OAS Peace Commission.
 Except for intermittent sniper
 fire, little military action in-
 volving US forces has recently
 occurred.   US casualties now
 total 15 dead and 85 wounded.
 On 12 May US marines extended
 the international zone in Santo
 Domingo several blocks eastward
 to protect foreign embassies.
 In an unprecedented move
 on 10 May, the OAS gave the
 Peace Commission authority for
 establishing an Inter-American
 Armed Force in the Dominican Re-
 public which will be controlled
 by a vaguely defined "OAS uni-
 fied command."  Brazil and sev-
 eral Central American countries,
 after delaying over technicali-
 ties, are acting to provide con-
 tingents.   In Argentina and Co-
 lombia, military officers are
 pushing reluctant governments
 to participate in the force.
 Chile, .Uruguay, Mexico, Ecuador,
 and Peru do not favor an OAS
 role in the Dominican Republic
 Western Hemisphere
 and probably will not supply
 troops.
 The Peace Commission and
 OAS Secretary General Jose Mora,
 aided by the papal nuncio, have
 attempted to bring the two Do-
 minican factions together, per-
 haps to form a coalition govern-
 ment, but have met with intransi-
 gence from the Caamano group.
 The proposal to send several
 Latin American "wise men" of in-
 ternational renown--Jose Figueres,
 Alberto Lieras Camargo, Romulo
 Betancourt, and Luis Munoz Marin
 --to seek a political solution
 appears to have failed to obtain
 support.
 The Imbert Government
 The five-man Government of
 National Reconstruction  (GNR)
 headed by Imbert was formed af-
 ter much delay on 7 May.   In its
 original conception the GNR was
 to be broadly based, but many
 Dominicans evidently are identi-
 fying it with the established
 political order, and it has
 thus far not generated popular
 enthusiasm.   Only one of its
 five members has been associated
 with the moderate left, and it
 lacks a representative of former
 president Joaquin Balaguer, who
 is still a formidable political
 power.   The GNR has appointed
 many established military
 figures and members of the gov-
 ernment of deposed president
 Reid to important posts.
 In an attempt to gain pub-
 lic support Imbert ousted eight
 previously discredited military
 officers.   Despite indications
 soon thereafter that loyalist

 General Elias Wessin would vol-
 untarily retire, he subsequently
 reneged and remains in his old
 position as commander of the
 armed forces training center.
 His continued association with
 the Imbert government can be ex-
 pected to cut into any popular
 support the regime might acquire,
 since Wessin has become to many
 of his countrymen a symbol of
 decadence and brutality.
 It was hoped that Imbert
 would make a rapid start toward
 restoring normal governmental
 and economic activity, but only
 moderate success has been at-
 tained thus far.   Secondary gov-
 ernmental officials have either
 sided with the rebels or refused
 to commit themselves to a gov-
 ernment which they view as hav-
 ing an uncertain future.   Rebel
 control of important financial
 and communications installations
 has hindered economic activity.
 In the face of this failure,
 Imbert is described as becoming
 frustrated and considering mili-
 tary action against the rebels.
 The Caamano "government"
 continues to stress its claims
 of legitimacy and constitution-
 ality but has failed to extend
 its control outside of Santo Do-
 mingo.  The rebels have, how-
 ever, consolidated their hold
 on the northern sections of the
 capital, engaging in several
 fire fights with loyalists while
 doing so.   The rebels have at-
 tempted to present a facade of
 Western Hemisphere
 effective government by setting
 up ministries, but their min-
 isters have been able to perform
 only limited functions.
 Perhaps the chief strength
 of the rebels has been their
 ability to utilize propaganda
 media. adroitly.  The rebel-con-
 trolled "Radio Santo Domingo
 (Constitutionalist)" has broad-
 cast a stream of increasingly
 bitter anti-US invective, attack-
 ing Ambassador Bennett and accus-
 ing US troops of "criminal acts."
 The rebels have also become more
 active in the publications field,
 putting out a weekly magazine and
 a newspaper.
 Caamano appears to lack an
 aptitude for political affairs,
 and appears to be relying more
 heavily on advisers, particularly
 opportunistic "Minister of the
 Presidency" Hector Aristy.   Com-
 munists and extremists are near
 the top of the rebel regime, al-
 though they do not hold any of
 the cabinet posts.  They are
 particularly active in the prop-
 aganda field and as leaders of
 rebel paramilitary units.-

 declared the "firm support" of
 the Chinese people, the Soviet

 The difficulties of General
 Rene Barrientos' military govern-
 ment are intensifying as time
 passes and no solutions are found
 for Bolivia's acute political
 and economic problems.   More-
 over, Barrientos' uncertain
 leadership gives no assurance
 that prospects for stability
 will soon improve.
 Barrientos' ambition to rule
 as a popularly elected president
 has been an important factor
 behind his government's insecu-
 rity.   Although well liked by
 most Bolivians,  he has been un-
 able to secure much support for
 his candidacy from the political
 parties.   Moreover, he is un-
 willing to give up the junta
 presidency despite legalities
 requiring candidates to resign
 from public office 180 days be-
 fore elections.                    As a result
 of this impasse, Barrientos with-
 drew his candidacy on 30 April
 but then moved last week to
 postpone indefinitely the presi-
 dential                        elections scheduled
 for 31 October.   Barrientos
 probably engineered the post-
 ponement to gain time to consider
 another strategy by which he
 might become a constitutional
 president.   This latest move
 has brought him under renewed
 criticism from most political
 parties, but his general popu-
 larity seems unaffected.
 Bolivia's economic problems
 are closely tied to the politi-
 cal situation.   When the junta
 first took power last November,
 it characterized itself as an
 interim government and promised
 sweeping economic reforms as
 well as a quick return to con-
 stitutional government.   How-
 ever,  it soon discovered that
 it lacked the competence to
 cope effectively with complex
 economic problems.
 The most pressing of these,
 inherited from the Paz regime,
 is the ugly situation prevail-
 ing in Bolivia's vital tin-
 mining industry.   The tin-mining
 areas are centers of extreme
 leftist and Communist influence
 which have not been controlled
 by any government since 1952.
 Moreover, COMIBOL, the state
 mining corporation, is burdened
 with managerial irresponsibility
 as well as unruly labor, and
 is close to bankruptcy.
 International deficit
 financing has been obtained,
 but further assistance is pred-
 icated  on a wide-ranging reform
 of present mine labor practices
 which inordinately favor the
 miners at the expense of effi-
 cient production.   All attempt-
 ed reforms have been strongly
 resisted by the miners acting
 under their extremist leader-
 ship.
 ership.
 Barrientos is aware.that
 the miners can be brought under
 control only by military action.
 He has indicated that his gov-
 ernment is willing to undertake
 such an operation, but is moving
 with deliberation because he is
 also aware that the miners will
 probably put up a stubborn de=.
 fense.   The miners are armed,
 they are fierce fighters, and
