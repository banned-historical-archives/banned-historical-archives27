 Principal Developments in World Communist Affairs
 20 September-18 October 1968
 1.  World Communist Conference Preparatory Commission Meets
 Delegates from 58 Communist and workers' parties gathered in Budapest
 during the week of 23 September with the shadow of the Soviet invasion
 clouding the proceedings.   It was the second meeting of the World Commu-
 nist Conference (WCC) Preparatory Commission (PC) which first met in
 April 1968 with 54+ parties present.   (These PC meetings were preceded by
 the Budapest Consultative Conference (67 parties) in February-March 1968).
 The Soviets were much more successful this time in preventing news leaks
 on the more vital parts of the proceedings, but it is generally acknowl-
 edged that the early part of the week passed in caucuses with the Czech
 issue at the forefront of the discussion:  whether to hold the WCC as
 scheduled, postpone it, or call it off altogether.
 A communique was issued after the formal proceedings 27 September-
 1 October (text attached -- it also lists all parties present).  Briefly,
 it unanimously affirmed "the necessity" of holding a Conference (a Soviet
 victory, unless it was only a face-saving device for the Soviets), agreed
 to hold a third meeting of the PC in Budapest on 17 November to decide on
 a date for the WCC (originally scheduled for 25 November, it remains to be
 seen what the Soviets will succeed in arranging), with the delegates tak-
 ing the issue back to their respective Central Committees for decision (en-
 ergetic Soviet lobbying can be expected in the various parties on their
 home ground).
 While most experts are confident that the WCC will not adhere to its
 original schedule, and that it will be postponed to early 1969 or possibly
 indefinitely, they differ as to whether the Soviets suffered further dam-
 age to their claim to leadership of the Communist world by having to dis-
 rupt their schedule, or whether they were satisfied -- in light of the
 disunity and disaffection caused by the Czech invasion -- to keep the is-
 sue of convoking a Conference open at all.
 Perhaps the best view is that they reckon a relatively short post-
 ponement as part of the calculated cost of the invasion,   Keeping open
 the possibility of a meeting and avoiding a public discussion of the Czech
 issue are a measure of their continuing power over the world movement.
 Perhaps a clearer measure of this power will be possible after 17 November.
 2.   The Czech Experiment being Extinguished
 Despite the presence of vast numbers of Soviet and Satellite
 troops in Czechoslovakia, a dogged popular resistance to Soviet demands
 for "normalization" continued during the past month.   Against the constant
 complaining and admonishments from her neighbors, particularly East Ger-
 many, Poland and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovak news media spoke up from

 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030010-5
 time to time refuting the more blatant lies.   Nevertheless, the resisting
 voice of the Czech media is progressively growing weaker, and the once forth-
 right; voices of the Czech leadership are tiring and are more and more keyed
 to the Soviet-called tune.  The Soviet colossus is gradually, patiently,
 but inexorably grinding down the Czech Communist and popular ability to
 resist.  Somehow, the accounts of Dubcek's faltering voice as he addresses
 his countrymen, his outbreaks of weeping, and his appearance of physical
 exhaustion seem to symbolize the vanquished spirit of Czech independence
 and individuality.
 In the Moscow meeting between Soviet and Czech leaders which finally
 took place 3-4 October after many postponements, the Czech side was forced
 to accept the principle of the "temporary" stationing of troops in Czecho-
 slovakia (the  "temporary"  stationing of troops in Hungary after the So-
 viet repression of the Revolution has lasted for 12 years).  Prime Minister
 Cernik has been the leading Czech negotiator.   Details of the agreement
 are not known as of this writing.   Observers believe that sufficient troops
 will be left indefinitely to insure "normalization," but that the bulk of
 the troops will be withdrawn, perhaps by 28 October, the 50th anniversary
 of the birth of Czechoslovakia as a state.   Such a move would be calculated
 by the Soviets for its maximum. psychological impact, particularly to im-
 prove the possibilities of convoking the World Communist Conference in the
 near future.
 3.  Protest in the Soviet Bloc
 For the most part, the widespread revulsion against the Soviet inva-
 sion among the ordinary people in the Soviet Bloc does not break into pub-
 lic view and is conveyed privately by word of mouth.   The handful of ex-
 amples of protest that have become known is truly representative of the
 sentiments of countless other private citizens.
 Five Soviets who briefly demonstrated in Red Square against the inva-
 sion were sentenced on 11 October after a short trial that was closed to
 all but an official claque and a few very close relatives of the accused.
 They were charged with "slandering the Soviet state" and disturbing the
 peace.  Three -- Pavel Litvinov, 30-year old physicist and grandson of the
 prewar Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov; Mrs. Larisa Bogaras-Daniel,
 wife of Yuli Daniel, the writer who was sentenced in 1966 to five years
 in a forced labor camp for criticizing the Soviet Union in his writings
 which were published abroad; and Konstantin Babitsky, a literary critic --
 were sentenced to exile in an undesignated remote area of the Soviet Union
 for five, four and three years respectively.   The "lenient" exile sent-
 ences, in lieu of forced labor camp servitude, were requested by the state
 prosecutor, purportedly on the grounds that these three were first offenders,
 more probably, however, because of the prominence of the accused and Krem-
 lin sensitivity to world opinion over its invasion role.   The other two
 defendants -- a young university student-poet and a Leningrad worker --
 received forced labor camp sentences of about three years because they had

 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030010-5
 committed prior offenses.   When the young poet, Mr. Delone, was informed
 by court of his sentence, he said, "for three minutes on Red Square I felt
 free, I am glad to take your three years for that."  His words seemed to
 represent the sentiments of all five unrepentant defendants.
 The noted Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko reportedly sent a strong
 telegram to Premier Kosygin and CPSU leader Brezhnev on 21 August protest-
 ing the invasion "as a tragic mistake and a bitter blow to ... the world
 Communist movement."  When queried by the press about his protest he
 claimed he had not sent it ... possibly to avoid prosecution for "anti-
 state propaganda."
 Jerzy Andrzejewski, prominent Polish novelist wrote to Czech writers,
 expressing his feeling of shame at the invasion and his solidarity with
 his Czech confreres.  Similar expressions are being privately circulated
 by Hungarian intellectuals.
 The 30th anniversary of the Munich Pact of 30 September 1968 -- which
 opened Czechoslovakia to occupation by Nazi Germany -- was the occasion
 for thousands of East German citizens to protest the regime's participation
 in the invasion.  Many accused the regime of having "trod in Hitler's foot-
 steps," and many of them have since been arrested.   Similar demonstrations,
 involving lesser numbers of demonstrators have been reported in Poland
 and Hungary.
 4+.   Soviet Diplomatic Relations
 At the United Nations foreign ministers from Albania, Brazil, the
 Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Pakistan,
 Salvador, Sweden and Venezuela, as well as U.S. Secretary of State Rusk,
 excoriated the Soviet Union for violating the spirit and letter of the UN
 Charter and international law and called for removal of Soviet bloc troops
 as a requirement for an improved political climate.
 U.S. Secretary of State Rusk forcefully warned Moscow again that any
 military action against West Germany would bring immediate military reac-
 tion by the NATO powers and pointedly told Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko
 that any new chances of detente depend upon the Soviets' application of
 the UN Charter to Czechoslovakia.
 As a result of the Czech crisis French officials began an important
 review of France's military strategy, as well as economic and diplomatic
 policies, to be conducted under the direction of Premier Couve de Murville.
 Foreign Minister Michel Debre's UN address strongly condemned the Soviet
 Union and supported the Czechoslovaks.   Debre also called the Soviet Union's
 violent anti-West German campaign a diversionary maneuver to obscure the
 consequences of its military invasion  of Czechoslovakia, and he added that
 it would be "supremely unjust" not to recognize the peaceful intentions
 of the present West German leaders.  Like Secretary of State Rusk and
 other foreign ministers, Debre made detente with Moscow contingent on the

 Soviet Union's willingness to recognize the sovereignty and personality
 of her neighbors.
 Soviet reaction has been to restore matters to a "business-as-usual"
 basis as soon as possible.   Thus, Foreign Minister Gromyko told the UN
 General Assembly that the Soviet Union was prepared to start a "serious
 exchange of views" with the U.S. on mutual limitation and reduction of
 strategic nuclear weapons, including antiballistic missiles, but warned
 that Moscow would "not allow infringements upon the vital interests of so-
 cialism" or upon "the inviolability of the boundaries of the Socialist
 Commonwealth."
 A conference between Rusk and Gromyko on 6 October regarding Vietnam,
 the Middle East, disarmament, and European security, reached no agreements,
 and Rusk characterized the talks as "a scouting expedition."  "Soviet pol-
 icy damaged a good many efforts that were being made to resolve problems
 in the general field of East-West relations," said Secretary Rusk on his
 return to Washington from New York.
 Foreign Minister Gromyko also talked with West German Foreign Minister
 Willy Brandt, on 8 October 1968.  While Brandt declined to discuss the
 details, he did say their talk had been "very useful," adding significantly
 that now West Germany would be even more cautious in its policy of bridge-
 building with East European countries.
 As part of efforts to recover from these diplomatic setbacks, the
 Soviets welcomed an unusual number of foreign visitors to Moscow.   They
 included the Shah of Iran and his queen, the Yemeni Foreign Minister, the
 Governor of West Pakistan, the Syrian Minister for Culture, National Guid-
 ance and Tourism, and the Deputy Chairman of India's Planning Commission.
 The Chief of the General Staff of the Iraqi Army also visited the USSR
 during this period, heading a military delegation.   They were guests of
 Soviet Defense Minister Andrei Grechko.
 Kosygin's Sudden Visit to Finland.   Soviet Premier Kosygin's sudden,
 unannounced, "unofficial" visit with Finland's President Kekkonen,
 6-9 October, caused widespread uneasiness in Finland, which has tried to
 maintain a precarious neutrality with the Russian bear next door.   The
 bland communique (why a communique after an "unofficial" visit?) and the
 deadpan assertions by officials that Kosygin came for a fishing trip vaca-
 tion did not obscure the real reason:   the effect of the Czech crisis on
 Finland.  After the Chairman of the Finnish Communist Party (FCP), Aarne
 Saarinen, condemned the Soviet invasion in very strong terms, after Finnish
 Foreign Minister Ahti Karjalainen joined the general condemnation of the
 invasion in the United Nations, and after the Finnish Communists suffered
 heavy losses in the communal elections of 6-7 October, the Soviets dispatched
 Kosygin to remind Finland that there are limits to how far "friendly neu-
 trality" can be stretched before the Soviets take more formal action to
 bring Finland back into line.  The communique's invocation of the military

 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030010-5
 clause in the Finnish-Soviet treaty of 19+8 was the slight baring of the
 teeth that passes for a Soviet smile of friendship with neutral Finland.
 Kosygin also took time to confer with Finnish Communist leaders, presum-
 ably to rebuke them for the party's criticism of the invasion.
 Soviet Posture on Germany.   The sudden concession reportedly made to
 Secretary Dean Rusk by Foreign Minister Gromyko in their meeting on
 6 October that West Berlin was a legitimate sphere of security concern
 for the U.S. and her allies, coupled with assurances that the Soviets will
 not threaten the status quo, may be explained as a tactical move, to allay
 the concern of the Western allies over Soviet intentions on the eve of a
 ministerial-level meeting of NATO and thus to forestall the expected West-
 ern effort to strengthen NATO.   But the Soviets' position on Berlin would
 also serve a second purpose:  to lead the world to believe that western
 interest in Berlin is equatable with Soviet interest in Czechoslovakia,
 5.   Soviet Military Aggressiveness
 As part of the Soviet return to "business-as-usual," side by side
 with a new Middle East "peace plan" which contained nothing new, the So-
 viets are continuing their strengthening of the Egyptian armed forces.
 The program allegedly calls for military supplies and equipment sufficient
 to help Egypt retrieve, within two to five years, all territory lost to
 Israel in June 1967.
 While the editor of the authoritative Jane's Fighting Ships warned
 about the increasing size of the Soviet navy and its penetration of the
 Mediterranean and the Far East, the Soviets sailed their new helicopter
 carrier Moskva into the Mediterranean, ominously strengthening Soviet
 naval potential in this sensitive area.   In the Christian Science Monitor
 (Boston) writer Paul Wohl warned:
 "The Soviets have also sailed deeply into the North
 Atlantic, and their planes are on patrol beyond Iceland and the
 British Isles.   Whether their motivation is fear of NATO, as
 they contend, or whether Soviet admirals -- like their counter-
 parts, the marshals of the Soviet Army -- have begun to influ-
 ence the political deliberations of the Kremlin in the sense of
 a more active and aggressive naval  policy, no one can say."
 Finally, the Paris newspaper L'Aurore reports that for months Soviet
 military instructors, technical advisers and specialists of all kinds'
 have been arriving in Algeria.
 6.   Two Significant Western CP Reactions
 The French Communist Party (PCF) is evidencing the effects of deep
 division on the Czech crisis, so much so that L'Humanite published on
 5 October an article by Central Committee member Lucien Mathey bitterly
 attacking Politburo member Roger Garaudy, who is also a leading PCF
 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : C~4-RDP78-03061A000400030010-5
 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030010-5
 theoretician, for "breaking party discipline" by writing a favorable pre-
 face to a collection in book form of pre-invasion statements and doctrines
 of the Czechoslovak leaders.   Garaudy wrote:   the "Czechoslovak positions
 as defined between Janua   and August this year were the 'model' of So-
 cialism that came closest to our conditions."  The Humanite article as-
 serted that Garaudy exceeded PCF policy which, while condemning use of
 armed force by the Soviet Union, nevertheless chided the Czechoslovak com-
 rades for not having acted with sufficient vigor against 'anti-socialist'
 tendencies.   Garaudy was accused of "propagating 'new' definitions of so-
 cialism in the economic field.," implying that such socialism would rely
 unduly on intellectuals instead of on the working class:  Mathey's article
 possibly foreshadows disciplinary action and even expulsions from the
 party.
 Garaudy's position appears to have much in common with that of Andre
 Berteloot, Secretary of the CGT (Confederation Generale de Travail --
 Communist-led labor federation), thus indicating possible widespread sup-
 port for such a thesis within the large and powerful labor union as well
 as within the PCF.   This would. help explain why L'Humanite is so concerned.
 Berteloot was interviewed by _Prace (Czech trade union newspaper) in Prague
 on 28 September while there as part of a CGT delegation meeting with re-
 presentatives of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions and the
 powerful and Communist-led Italian CGIL (labor federation).   Said Prace:
 Berteloot "resolutely rejected assertions that the stand
 of French trade unions on the military intervention in Czecho-
 slovakia was only a tactical maneuver carried out with members
 and voters in mind.   He said the CGT position was absolutely
 one of principle.  He said the post-January (1968) road of the
 Czechoslovak working class 'represented an attempt to find a
 form of socialism which would be in accord with the economic,
 social and other traditions of the country.   The reason we are
 interested in it is that once we have established the conditions
 for building socialism in France, we shall be confronted by the
 same problems!"   (Emphasis added)
 The Austrian Communist Parma announced on 3 October that the western
 Communist Parties would probably hold a regional conference to discuss
 their disagreements with Moscow over Czechoslovakia and to make a "posi-
 tive contribution to the peaceful political solution of this problem,
 including the speedy withdrawal of Soviet Bloc troops from CSSR."  The
 party has accepted an invitation from the CPSU Central Committee to send
 a delegation to Moscow for bilateral talks, during which they will prob-
 ably be subjected to heavy pressure to drop the idea of a regional confer-
 ence.   The likely degree of pressure may be judged from the vicious attack
 made by Pravda on 5 October on Austrian Communist Party theoretician Ernst
 Fischer, who has played a key role in proposing such a regional conference,
 which included such remarks as:   "It would be hard to find among the ranks
 of Communist party members anywhere a person who stood. so close to the
 crudest inventions of imperialist propaganda concerning the occupation of
 Czechoslovakia."

 T.   Ill-Timed Debut for a New West German Communist Party
 Thirty-one men and women issued a manifesto in Frankfurt on
 29 September announcing the founding of a new West German Communist Party
 (DKP) as a variant of the outlawed Communist Party of West Germany (KPD).
 Though tiny, the new DKP is backed by Walter Ulbricht's East Germany and
 is presumed to be acting on Ulbricht's orders in a move to challenge Bonn's
 12-year ban on the KPD.   Leader of the new DKP is 59-year old Kurt Bachmann,
 an old-time Communist, Nazi-era emigre who returned in 1945 to help re-
 establish the KPD, and former editor of the Cologne Communist newspaper
 Volksstimme.
 To protect itself domestically, the Bachmann group made two statements.
 It called for lifting the ban on the KPD, thereby avoiding the taint of
 being a substitute for, or successor to, the outlawed party and automati-
 cally subject to the same ban,   Simultaneously, the new DKP declared its
 respect for the Constitution and Bill of Rights of the Federal Republic.
 The Bachmann group foreign policy platform echoes that of East Germany; it
 reaffirms that the intervention in Czechoslovakia was a defensive measure,
 favors the recognition of existing de facto European boundaries, and calls
 for East-West German relations on a "basis of equality."  Whether the new
 party will foreswear typical Communist subversive tactics remains to be
 seen.  Will the leopard change his spots?
 Whatever the reason for founding the DKP, the timing is inauspicious.
 Events in Prague have alienated many left-wing elements who might other-
 wise have been sympathetic.  And, as the Frankfurter Rundschau commented
 editorially, "the legal acceptance of the DKP will improve the image of
 the FRG abroad since the legality of the neo-Fascist NPD, contrasted with
 the ban on the KPD, has only facilitated Soviet propaganda efforts."
 8.   New Left Groupings Reviving in France
 Pro-Chicom Grouping   The contents of the new journal, Drapeau Rouge
 (discussed in "Principal Developments in Communist World Affairs" of
 September 1968) confirm not only its Maoist orientation, but also the fact
 that it will be used as the nucleus of a new Communist party to the left
 of the French Communist Party and dedicated to Maoist doctrines of violence.
 The French have deduced from the awkward language that some of the edi-
 torial material is provided directly by the Chinese Communist Embassy in
 Paris.   One of the strains animating the French New Left finds its inspi-
 ration in Chinese communism and the "thoughts of Mao Tse-tung."  Though
 direct evidence is lacking, one should not be surprised to find not only
 inspiration and editorial support from the Chinese Embassy, but also
 financial support (the new magazine is a luxury edition and is distributed
 gratis).
 New Extreme Left Journal.   Another extreme left journal is reported
 to be ready to make its first appearance in France.  Known simply as Rouge,

 it is said to represent student militants from the former Jeunesse Commu-
 niste Revolutionnaire (Revolutionary Communist Youth) which was dissolved
 by decree as the result of its participation in the May riots in Paris.
 However, it now seeks to unite radicals from universities, secondary schools,
 trade schools, etc., and also like-minded adults.  Frankly revolutionary
 in its intentions, it will emphasize the international scope of the revo-
 lutionary movement and establish liaison with equivalent group in other
 countries, such as the S.D.S. in Germany, the "Jeune Garde Socialiste"
 (Young Socialist Guard) in Belgium, student movements in Italy and South
 America, and the Zengakuren in Japan.

 There is a spirit of defeat-
 ism                      and dejection, especially,
 among younger-people here, as
 Dubcck Is forced to make one'
 concession after another to the,
 Russians"to achieve what Is
 termed "normalization"' In rela-
 tions between the two countries.
 Though ', he still 'retains' the
 confidence and trust of> most
 Czechoslovaks, there is the feat
 among liberals that he may be
 pushc too far and that Czecho-'
 slovaka will again become a
 police state. Well before this
 stage is reached, however, it is
 almost certain Dubcck and his*
 liberal colleagues on the party
 Presidium would resign,
 Drspite the pessimism pre-;
 vailing; now, it is probably too;
 'early to write an epitaph el--
 t her fp'r Dubcck or his program.
 DespltF the crowding by the
 Soviets leadership, he still main.
 tains Ma certain flexibility.
 Here is what the balance
 sheet' looks like two months aft
 er th? invasion:
 Thq Press. Gone is the free-
 dom to criticize, to engage in'
 polemics,.  to  express  diverse
 views, which provided such ex--'
 hilaration and excitement in the
 spring     and  early,   summer
 months. The new controls have,
 probably hit the press the hard-
 est, but even today occasional
 liberties are taken in stretch-
 ing the censorship rules.
 The Party. Dubcek Eai s been
 forced to tighten the controls
 and end the democratic ex-
 periment under which minority
 the party such as organizations
 of Communists and academic in-
 stitutions. Dubcek is resisting,
 these pressures.
 Economic Management. The
 Russians want an end to eco-
 nomic refroms aimed at increas-
 ing industrial efficiency by veer-
 ing Czechoslovakia's commerce'
 toward the West. They want
 Czechoslovakia to continue play-i
 ing her key role as heavy indus
 trial  supplier  and  munitions;
 maker for COMECON, the Com
 munist bloc's economic network)
 Dubcek has made some con-'
 cessions. The leadership now;
 talks about'how much they love,
 ',COMECON. But he insists. that,
 the process or decentralization
 of  industrial  decision-making
 will continue, with workers par.'
 ticipating in the management of
 enterprises, as they do in Yu-
 goslavia: This is a key element
 in the economic reform pro-
 gram.
 The Law. Dubcek and the
 liberal leadership have repeat
 ediy' stressed  that - citizens'.
 rights  are  guaranteed  under
 Czechoslovak laws  and    that
 they need not fear midnight ar
 rests and violations of personal
 liberties. But there are stronb
 pressures by the Russians for
 the authorities here. to arrest
 those whom Moscow regards as
 leading the counter-revolution.
 aries  and  stage  show trials.
 Most observers feel that if there
 is -any point on which Dubcek,
 Will. not yield, it Is this:
 The Military. Soviet Premier
 AIPS"PI lencygin  awd Cztohoslo-
 wvak Premier Oldrik Cernik signed
 a treaty in Prague last week, pro-
 viding for the gradual with-
 drawal of most of the Warsaw
 Pact invasion forces. Contingents
 of Soviet forces will remain. The
 stationing of Soviet forces here
 has been denounced by the liberal
 .Intellectuals as "another Mu.
 nich" but there was ? little the
 leadership could do about it.
 That Dubcck has not given
 Lup despite the intense Soviet
 pressures is Indicated by the
 commission he formed to deter-
 mine the "tasks of the party in
 the present period.  This Is
 aimed at preserving as much
 of Dubcek's "action program" 'as possible.
 The pressures come. on many
 fronts. Soviet political officers
 In Pilzen, for example, went to
 the district committee of 'the'
 party last week and demanded
 that the editor of the Skoda
 .Works newspaper be fired be-
 cause he published certain na-
 tionalistic poems.
 Gen. Ivan Pavolsky, supreme
 commander of the invasion forc-
 es, threatened in a letter to
 the Minister of Education to oc-
 cupy the nation's schools
 which he termed a "nest of
 .counter-revolution!'  -  unless
 teachers adopted a more favor-
 able attitude toward the - Rus-
 sians.
 in the final tallying of the
 `balance sheet, Dubcek Is seen as'
 a man who Is trying to hold on
 to power to prevent the com-
 plete erosion of his liberaliza-
 tion program. And he retains an
 ultimate trump card--a threat of
 resignation. This would probably
 produce demonstrations In the
 streets, general strikes and the
 :rekindling of a potential expla'
 sive situation.

 the Soviets sponsored the Asian'

 SOVIET RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNIST WORLD
 For several years now the Soviets have been attempting to arrange a
 world conference of Communist parties.   It has become clear that their
 basic aim in convening such a conference is to attempt to get back in
 hand the world Communist movement -- or at least whatever part of it can
 be brought back together.   They clearly recognize that the movement is
 rapidly losing its cohesiveness and that this trend must be stopped before
 it is too late.   It has now become obvious that there is no hope of re-
 integrating the Chinese Communists, nor is there much hope of herding
 Castro into the same fold as Ulbricht.   But, they are intent on gathering
 together whatever remaining part of the world movement they can, or re-
 asserting the primacy of the Soviet Union in this movement and, if pos-
 sible, on preparing a document which will embody the basic Communist doc-
 trine to which all members of the movement will subscribe.
 Despite considerable foot-dragging by such parties as the Italian
 and Rumanian, two Preparatory Commission meetings had been held and the
 date of 25 November set for the World Communist Conference.   Then came
 the invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia and the entire proceedings
 were thrown into doubt.   The issue, as it was developed in the Communist
 world, was clear:   is the Communist movement a unified whole, dominated
 by the Soviet Union, or is it a sort of federation of separate, equal,
 autonomous elements?
 The Soviet stand was set forth bluntly on 26 September when a leading
 Soviet ideologist, Sergei Kovalev, writing in Pravda , enunciated a prin-
 ciple which not only attempted to justify the Soviet armed incursion into
 Czechoslovakia, but which would also henceforth provide a priori justifi-
 cation for the Soviet Union to intervene in any manner it sees fit in the
 domestic affairs of any Satellite country whose leaders were pursuing pol-
 icies contrary to Soviet interests.   The key passage reads:
 "The peoples of the socialist countries and Communist
 parties certainly do have and should have freedom for deter-
 mining the ways of advance of their respective countries,   How-
 ever, none of their decisions should damage either socialism
 in their country or the fundamental interests of other social-
 ist countries and the whole working class movement, which is
 working for socialism.   This means that each Communist Party is
 responsible not only to its own people, but also to all the
 socialist countries, to the entire Communist movement.,..   The
 sovereignty of each socialist country cannot be opposed to the
 interests of the world of socialism, or the world revolutionary
 movement."
 -.The article is entitled "Sovereignty and International Duties of Social-
 ist Countries."

 While this principle is advanced with the primary intention of defin-
 ing relations between the Soviet Union and its European Satellites, its
 implications for any Communist party outside the Soviet Bloc which iden-
 tifies its interests with those of the "fatherland of socialism" are
 clear:  the Soviet Union arrogates to itself the authority to control such
 a party's policies, whether before or after its accession to power.
 The Kovalev thesis may be regarded either as a new doctrine or as a
 more forceful, unambiguous re-formulation in neo-Stalinist terms of the
 old Communist tenet known as "proletarian internationalism."  Stalin's
 classic definition in 1927 read:
 "A revolutionary is he who without arguments, uncondi-
 tionally, openly and honestly ... is ready to defend and strengthen
 the USSR, since the USSR is the first proletarian, revolutionary
 state in the world ... an internationalist is he who, unreserv-
 edly, without hesitation, without conditions, is ready to de-
 fend the USSR because the USSR is the base of the world revolu-
 tionary movement, and to defend, to advance this revolutionary
 movement is impossible without defending the USSR."
 Stalin's former Foreign Minister Andrei Vishinsky stated the propo-
 sition even more bluntly in the Soviet journal Voprosy Filosofii (Prob-
 lems of Philosophy) No. 2, 1948:
 "At present the only determining criterion of revolutionary
 proletarian internationalism is:   are you for or against the
 USSR, the motherland of the world proletariat?  An internation-
 alist is not one who verbally recognizes international solidarity
 or sympathizes with it.   A real internationalist is one who
 brings his sympathy and recognition up to the point of practical
 and maximal help to the USSR in support and defense of the USSR
 by every means and every possible form.   Actual cooperation with
 the USSR, the readiness of the workers of any country to subject
 all their aims to the basic problem of strengthening the USSR
 in its struggle -- this is the manifestation of revolutionary
 proletarian internationalism on the part of workers in foreign
 countries....   The defense of the USSR, as of the socialist
 motherland of the world proletariat, is the holy duty of every
 honest man  everywhere and not only of the citizens of the USSR."
 The Kovalev formulation of proletarian internationalism has met with
 either silence or disapproval among Communists.   But one leaders (not un-
 expectedly an East German) has harmonized his voice with Kovalev's.  A
 speech by Eric Honecker, Politburo member of the East German Communist
 party (known as the SED -- Socialist Unity Party), and heir apparent of
 Walter Ulbricht, reprinted (significantly enough) in Pravda on 7 October,
 contained the following passage:

 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030010-5
 "Now, when proletarian internationalism is again being tested
 for strength, the SED  and all democratic parties and mass organi-
 zations of the German Democratic Republic, all our people feel
 closely tied to the great Soviet people, to their glorious Lenin-
 ist party, the CPSU, and its Central Committee.   Relations with
 the USSR, relations with the CPSU, are for us, as for all Lenin-
 ists, the most important criterion by which a party pretending
 to the right to call itself Marxist-Leninist is judged.   In our
 time, it is impossible to be a Communist without love for the
 land of Lenin, without supporting its policy...."
 The Kovalev thesis was immediately recognized by western journalists
 for what is was:   a blunt statement of the Soviet demand that the "social-
 ist" countries, indeed all Communist parties around the world, are to sub-
 ordinate their individual interests to Soviet requirements, euphemistically
 expressed as those of the "world revolutionary movement."  The Yugoslav,
 British and Austrian Communists attacked the revival of this thesis di-
 rectly and the Rumanians indirectly (by invoking the phrase -- in vogue
 since Khrushchev's reconciliation with Tito in 1955-56 -- of "mutual ref-
 spect for the independence and sovereignty of the socialist countries").
 Perhaps because of its bluntness, Soviet propagandists have subsequently
 been reluctant to reiterate the Kovalev formulation, and have taken refuge
 in less obtrusive and less blatant terminology, such as the necessity for
 "unity," "cohesion," "solidarity," etc. in the international Communist
 movement, counterposing its "international tasks" and "common interests"
 to "national tasks" and "individual interests."  However the thesis is
 phrased -- obscurely, politely, euphemistically -- the meaning of "prole-
 tarian internationalism" remains the same:   Soviet interests take prece-
 dence over those of any Communist party within or outside the Communist
 camp.
 As in other times of crisis and strain within the Soviet Bloc, invo-
 cation of proletarian internationalism takes precedence over another (and
 conflicting) thesis, though the two are usually stated side by side.   One
 authoritative expression of the contrary thesis is found in the 1957 Mos-
 cow Declaration subscribed to by 12 of the 13 parties in power at that
 time, including Communist China but not Yugoslavia:   "The socialist coun-
 tries base their relations on principles of complete equality, respect for
 territorial integrity, state independence and sovereignty and non-
 interference in one another's affairs."  Now Kovalev has explicitly rejected
 the absolute validity of the sovereignty concept, and posited the "higher
 good" of proletarian internationalism.
 The World Communist Conference (WCC) Preparatory Commission (PC)
 meeting in Budapest 27 September-1 October can be regarded as a practical
 application of the Kovalev doctrine.   The adverse repercussions which the
 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia had on all non-Bloc Communist parties,
 had, in the general view, thrown the issue of proceeding with the WCC,
 and even preparations for it, in doubt.  Yet the Soviets succeeded in

 mobilizing 58 parties (versus 54 and 67 in two previous preparatory meet-
 ings), succeeded also in keeping the Czech issue from erupting into public
 polemics, in getting a unanimous decision on the "necessity" of holding a
 World Communist Conference, and in gaining assent to reconvene yet another
 preparatory meeting on 17 November (which is to decide finally on a date
 for the full WCC).   It seems evident that the Soviets persuaded the parti-
 cipants to subordinate their individual interest to those of proletarian
 internationalism.   In sum, it was a fair example of the servility to which
 Communists are reduced in the service of this doctrine.
 This does not mean, however, that the Soviets achieved a clear-cut
 victory in their struggle to convene a world conference.  Although the
 25 November date originally designated for convening the full conference
 was not cancelled outright (perhaps to save face for the Soviets), most
 observers believe that the 17 November meeting will postpone the WCC to
 some time in 1969 or to the indefinite future.  And though discussion of
 the Czech crisis did not break into public view, there can be no question
 that the dissidence aroused by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was
 the root cause for making uncertain the future of this pet project of the
 Soviet Union.

 Those who speak about they

 and there cannot be non-F
 class laws.
 Laws and legal norms are4

 class struggle, the laws of
 social ddvclopment.  These.
 laws are clearly formulated
 in Marxist-Leninist teaching,.
 In  the  documents jointly.
 'adopted by the Communist;
 and Workers' parties.'
 Formally Juridical reason-
 ing must not overshadow ai
 class approach to the matter.',
 One who. does it, thus losing'
 the only correct class crite.
 rion in assessing legal norms.
 begins to measure events-
 with a yardstick of bourgeois
 law.
 Such an approach to the
 question of sovereignty means
 that. for example, the pro.
 gressive forces of the world
 would not be able to come
 out against the revival of
 neo-Nazism In the Federal
 Republic of Germany, against
 the  actions  of  butchers
 ;Franco and Salazar, against
 'reactionary arbitrary actions"
 of "black colonels" in Greece,
 because this is "the internal
 affair" of "sovereign" states.
 Vietnam Example Cited
 It  is characteristic  that
 both the Saigon puppets and
 their  American  protectors
 also regard the notion of
 sovereignty as  prohibiting
 support for the struggle of
 progressive forces.
 i  They proclaim at every
 crossroads that the socialist
 countries, which are render.

 .  Life has convincingly proved that socialism,, in its forward movement, overcomes
 all barriers.  Such is the objective law of the new world which is coming, through
 turbulent class battles, to replace the old world of capitalism.  Whereas not so long
 ago it was hoped in the camp of our enemies that it would be possible to halt
 historical progress, such hopes have been finally dashed to the ground by recent events.
 Al,]. those who hold dear the cause of socialism and the peaceful future of the people
 are reading the dispatches coming from Czechoslovakia today with a feeling of confidence
 which is growing stronger.  Even the most frantic anticommunists are now compelled to
 admit the invincibility of socialist gains in that country and the fact that counter-
 revolution found'itself powerless against them.
 ? Among the people of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic there has noticeably been an
 increasing understanding of the necessity of bringing the allied forces into the
 country.  Nationalist intoxication aroused by antisoeialist propaganda is being gradually
 dissipated.
 Genuine Czechoslovak patriots are realizing more and'more clearly the vital
 importance of a consistent and honest implementation of the discussions taken at
 the Soviet-Czechoslovak talks in Moscow.
 At the same time one cannot fail to be legitimately alarmed at the fact that antisocialist
 sentiments are still making themselves felt in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
 The process of normalizing the state of affairs which has begun in the Czechoslovak
 Socialist republic is clearly not to the taste of the imperialist circles which are
 not using their propaganda services to give any support they can to the antisocialist
 forces in Czechoslovakia.
 The present international situation, notable for an aggravation of class warfare in
 the world arena and a step up of aggressive activity on the part of imperialism,
 demands that the builders of socialism make even more effective use of the mighty
 arsenal of Marxist-Leninist ideas.  An exceptionally important role in this connection
 was played by the conference of representatives of communist and workers parties of
 Bulgaria, Hungary, the.GDR, Poland, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia which took
 place in Bratislava on 3 August this year.  The declaration approved by the
 participants in the Bratislava conference contained a formulation of the major
 principles of strengthening the unity and oahesion of the socialist countries,
 principles of struggle,at the present stage for consolidating the positions of
 socialism, for the peace and security of people, and against the aggressive policy of
 imperialism.
 Not much time has elapsed since the conference in Bratislava, but it has been a
 period filled with great events which have fully confirmed the correc'tnes's of the
 deductions made by participants of the conference and set forth in their declaration.
 And today one can state with confidence that, acting unflinchingly in the spirit of
 that declaration, the socialist countries have already made a considerable
 contribution to the strengthening of the cause of socialism.
 Can people who have come to know the triumph of free labor and life with the
 establishment of socialism wish .to depart from the road they have chosen?   Of  course
 not.   Expressing their firm will, the participants in the Bratislava conference
 unanimously declared their unflinching determination to develop and defend the
 socialist gains. .in their countries and to strive for new successes in building
 socialism.   The~Bratislava declaration'contains a vitally important principle,
 dictated by the,nepessity for further united action by the socialist states.     The
 support, strengthening, and defense of these gains, which were achieved at the.price
 of,the. heroic efforts aid selfless labor of every people, is the common international
 duty ofp   r69eiR      MWt'065/08/17: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030010-5

 This is all the more important in view of the fact that the foes-or socialism are
 quite prepared to make use of the well-known tactics-of the old colonialists:
 divide and rule.   Not risking a frontal attack, they are especially active in making
 use of these tactics in ideological struggle against the socialist countries.  The
 policy of building bridges and other political diversions of the West pursue the aim
 of achieving erosion of Marxist-Leninist ideology as the ideological foundation of
 a socialist society, impairing its political organization, and thereby clearing the
 field for antisocialist activity in one country or another.  The fraternal parties,
 as was stated in the Bratislava declaration, firmly and resolutely oppose their
 unshakable solidarity and high degree of vigilance to any attempts by imperialism,
 as well as by any of the other anticommunist forces, to weaken the leading role of
 the working class and the communist parties.  They will never allow anyone to drive
 a wedge between the socialist states or undermine the foundation of the socialist
 social system.  The significance of this principle, recorded in the Bratislava
 declaration, cannot be overestimated.
 The document approved by the participants in the Bratislava conference has developed
 the principles collectively formulated by the fraternal parties at their conferences
 in Moscow in 1957 and 1960--applying these principles to new conditions.  This docu-
 ment expresses positions and views which accord with the interests of all fraternal
 countries and parties, with the cause of the unshakable friendship of the peoples
 of socialist states, and with the interests of peace, democracy, national independence,
 and socialism.   It was by fidelity to the principles. fixed in the. Bratislava deola.ra-
 r:i"n, Oust  i   19Y    deiiy;y iA Uhi-4r    1~~+e6ntii*Asia ~ duty and obligations as allies, that
 the Soviet Un:?n and the other allied states were guided when a real threat was hang-
 ing over the socialist gains in?Czechoslovakia.  These lofty Marxist-Leninist princi-
 ples are inspiring our soldiers, who came to the fraternal soil of Czechoslovakia
 for the sole purpose of guarding the freedom and independence of that country as a
 socialist state.
 The builders of the new world would be Utopians and not the revolutionary realists
 which Lenin taught them to be if they considered that complex problems did not arise
 in the development of'socialism.  These problems exist, and united efforts by the
 fraternal countries and peoples are necessary for their solution.  The significance
 of the Bratislava declaration is all the greater because it contains a clear and
 constructive program for strengthening all-round cooperation of the socialist countries.
 Since the signing of that document a number of bilateral and multila.teralfl etings of
 leading figures of the fraternal countries and parties have taken place.   In Moscow,.
 for instance, Soviet-Czechoslovak talks were carried out in the course of which the
 conviction was expressed by both sides that one of the main ta:?:;in.the present condi-
 tionn in Czechoslovakia was implementation of theses and principles formulated at the
 Bra.iL lava conference.
 The socialist states coordinate their actions in the international arena.   How neces-
 sary this is especially convincingly proved by the'present development of the inter-
 national situation.  The NATO bosses have recently e:,ibarked on a,.n open course for a
 mii..tary-political compnet against the Warsaw Pact countries.  Especially active in
 funning an atmosphere of hysteria znd tension in Europe are the ruling circles of
 the German Federal Republic; supported by American imperialism.   The criminal aggres-
 s"on of the United States against the heroic Vit':namese people is continuing.   The
 e: hers of the unquencnRdd fire ..f war which was l~?t by Israeli extremists in the Near

 The communist parties and go ve- nm~nts of the fratern?~1 countries are taking up a
 c:ummon attitude toward all these burning problems-of international life, prrceeding
 from the interests of the struggle for peace and against the aggressive pt:"cy of
 imperialism. The CPSU and the USSR Go--,ernment have proved by their actioza  that
 they fu1::y adhere, and wil]. continue to adhere, to the collectively formulat'd prin-
 ciples.                    The international unity of communists is tempered in strruggle against imper..?
 alism a;W  all variants of opportuni,m and sectarianism.   Practice shows that dev~at.i
 from Marxism-Leninism becomes especially dangerous whenconbinsd with manifestations
 of bourgeois nationalism.  UnreconcI1able struggle again !. all deviations from
 Leninist principles, and against their nationalist, dogmatic, and revisionist dis-
 tortions, is the condition and pledr,,, of a successful rebuff to imperialist schemes.
 ,the condition and pledge of the triumph-of the cause of peace, democracy, nationaj
 independence and sooialism.
