 SUBJECT:                  Your China Trip:                                                 Setting and Issue$
 I.  THE SETTING
 Your trip to China April 26 - May 1 will cap the series of
 discussions you and senior members of your Ad ,Ikinistration have
 held with Chinese leaders during the past year    These
 discussions have placed our bilateral relationship back on
 track, and the Chinese evidently share our desire to
 consolidate and develop further our ties.   Your seven hours of
 talks in Beijing with China's four top leaders -- political
 strongman Deng Xiaoping, Chief of State Li Xiannian, Communist
 Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang,  and Premier Zhao -- will
 reinforce and elaborate the themes developed in the course of
 this year-long bilateral dialogue, and explicitly underscored
 in your own meetings with Premier Zhao in mid-January.   Both
 your private statements to Chinese leaders and your two
 scheduled major addresses will convey that this nation:
 -- regards China as a friendly, non-allied country and
 wishes to advance our ties on that basis;
 -- stands ready, willing and able to lend support as
 appropriate to China's economic, S&T and defense modernization;
 -- seeks enhanced consultations and coordination where our
 interests are similar (e.g., Korea, Kampuchea, Afghanistan); and
 -- will abide by our commitments vis-a-vis Taiwan but will
 expect patience in handling this complex issue.
 The Chinese have made abundantly plain in word and deed
 that they want your visit to be a success; Premier Zhao stated
 this explicitly to Don Regan in Beijing.   To this end the
 Chinese made unprecedented concessions to us on logistical and
 administrative requirements for your visit; they yielded ground
 on a bilateral tax treaty which you will sign; they geared up,
 on instruction of Premier Zhao, for serious negotiations on a
 bilateral investment treaty; they decided to issue a temporary
 authorization to Northwest Airlines to begin passenger service
 to China, thus avoiding a serious civair confrontation; they
 conducted a remarkably cordial round of consultations with us
 on textiles, the most acrimonious of all our bilateral economic
 issues; and, during recent working-level talks on possible U.S.
 military sales, they have displayed renewed interest in
 investing our relationship with a strategic dimension.
 Beijing wants several things from your visit (before
 setting a date for Zhao's trip here they pushed hard for our
 agreement on your reciprocal visit).   First, China's reformist

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP86B00420R000100290005-5
 i                                t
 leadership -- Deng, Hu and Zhao in particular -- has a personal
 and political stake in presenting to doubting opponents the
 appearance and reality of a thriving bilateral relationship
 with the U.S.   This need accounts in part for the mild public
 complaint by Zhao on departing Washington last January that he
 hoped for more "substantive" talks with you-in Beijing.   It
 also accounts in some measure for the extraordinary Chinese
 effort to assure that your visit commences on a positive note.
 Second, having apparently concluded both that they had
 earlier misread your China policy and that you will likely win
 reelection in November, they want to solidify a personal
 relationship with you.
 Third,  they will seek to turn the favorable atmosphere
 following the Zhao visit to their advantage in pressing you to:
 take note of Chinese concerns on Taiwan (especially our arms
 sales and manifestations of stronger support in Taiwan and this
 country for Taiwan "independence" formulas); ease further the
 restrictions you have already relaxed on transfer of advanced
 technology; pledge your support for measures to increase
 Chinese access to concessional U.S. financing; ease
 restrictions on Chinese textiles; and, perhaps, intervene to
 break the impasse in our nuclear and investment negotiations.
 Foreign Minister Wu recently cited these issues, along with
 amending the Foreign Assistance Act and renewing the Maritime
 Agreement, as "issues of importance" to China.
 Finally, global considerations will shape the Chinese
 substantive and rhetorical approach to your visit.   Over the
 past two years they have carefully calibrated their policies
 toward the Soviets and us so as to gain maximum leverage and to
 do minimum damage to China's coveted image of a developing
 nation that pursues an independent foreign policy.   China's
 rhetoric is crafted to lend credence to this "independent"
 stance by linking the U.S. and Soviets as "hegemonist" powers.
 But despite recent efforts to ease Sino-Soviet tensions,
 Beijing acknowledges to one and all that it sees the USSR as
 the principal current and long-term threat to its security.
 Moreover,  the Chinese do not conceal their assessment that only
 ties with the U.S. and the West hold out promise of affording
 access to the high technology, advanced learning,  investment
 capital, and modern managerial skills which are vital to the
 success of their modernization program.
 II. ISSUES
 1. Taiwan.  The Chinese have muted their public criticisms
 of us, and let pass with minimum complaint our 1983 arms
 sales.   But Zhao pressed you in January on the Taiwan Relations

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP86B00420R000100290005-5
 Act; Zhao and others have manifested rising concern over the
 political' clout of elements in the U.S. favoring various
 formulas for Taiwan independence; and Deng has aired a
 "confederal" scheme to resolve the Taiwan question which he may
 raise with you in Beijing. In response, your best course of
 action is to reaffirm our consistent stand and note the
 requirement for patience.
 2. Korea.  The Chinese will anticipate a continuation of
 your dialogue with Zhao in January on ways we might work in
 tandem to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula.  We have
 recently sought again to explore Chinese willingness and
 ability to be helpful -- either as direct participants or "from
 the sidelines" -- should multilateral talks get underway.   The
 Chinese did not respond, and have displayed little inclination
 or ability to involve themselves in multilateral discussions at
 this juncture.  We should at minimum reaffirm our interest in
 having the Chinese engage themselves in a process aimed at
 creating the conditions for stability on the Peninsula.
 3. Concessional financing.   Premier Zhao has asked for US
 concessional loans for major power projects, including nuclear
 plants.   Don Regan told him in March that although the US was
 amending the legislative prohibition on aid with China, we had
 no bilateral aid program planned and China would have to rely
 on the World Bank and private sources.
 4. Discriminatory measures.  Along with the aid
 prohibition, China's leaders have criticised other elements of
 "US discrimination" against China.   As evidence, they cite the
 lack of preferential tariffs (GSP), annual review of most
 favored nation status (under the Jackson Vanik amendment),
 controls on technology, textile restrictions, dumping and
 countervailing duty petitions, and the court suit for repayment
 of Huguang railway bonds.  We see these as the result of
 security, political, or economic factors which are not
 traceable to any "discrimination" against China, and we have no
 plans to change our current policies.
 5. Grain Trade.   You will want to make clear that China
 must meet its commitment under our Long Term Grain agreement to
 purchase and ship 12 million tons of US grain in 1983-84.   Our
 data on shipments indicate the Chinese may fall short.
 Fulfillment of the commitment affects a major part of US-China
 trade and is important for China's credibility.
 6. Export Controls.    Chinese leaders appreciate your
 liberalization of export controls last year, but may question
 its implementation and complain that China is the only friendly
 country whose exports are reviewed by COCOM.   The statistics on
 licensing and the new technical levels of exports show that the
 policy is being successfully implemented, although we are still
 making

 improvements.  We do not believe that there is the necessary
 consensus among our allies to drop China from COCOM nor do we
 believe that this course is advisable from the standpoint of
 security.
 7. Asian Development Bank.   Since November 1982, China has
 been talking to the US, Japan, and the President of the ADB
 about membership.   China does not seek to expel Taiwan from the
 ADB, but does seek a change to "associate member" status for
 Taiwan.  This would require modification of the ADB charter,
 which Bank members oppose.    Moveover, Resolutions by Congress
 have called for Taiwan to retain full membership.   We have told
 the Chinese, most recently during the Regan visit, that they
 should work out arrangements acceptable to all parties with the
 Bank President.

 Dena-Zhao Talks with Brzezinski--An Assessment
 While it is easy to overinterpret the sometimes Delphic
 pronouncements of Chinese leaders, Deng and Zhao's remarks to
 Zbignew Brzezinski and other members of a Georgetown University
 delegation on 22 February                              a good deal
 about current Chinese
 Chinese have often used visits by such unofficial US
 groups in the past for tactical purposes--to air their concerns
 in strong terms, thus hoping to place subsequent official
 visitors on the defensive even before their arrival.  In this
 case, however, both Deng and Zhao appeared anxious initially to
 signal their satisfaction with Zhao's visit in January and
 President  portAChinatcontinuesttohattachhtotcloserrelationsd
 economic importance
 with the US.
 Both became defensive and critical of US policy only after
 some members of the delegation accused China of inconstancy in
 its policies.  In rebuttal, Deng and Zhao sought to cast
 themselves as friends offering advice, but they strongly
 criticized US foreign policy in general and toward China in
 particular over the past few years.  We believe this sharp
 reaction reflects underlying Chinese fears of being relegated to
 a less important strategic role in US calculations and a deep
 seated Chinese concern that China will be treated as less than an
 equal by the US--just as Moscow dealt with Beijing during the
 1950's.

 of East Asian Analysis

 Shifting Strategic Assessment
 The Chinese assessment of the strategic balance has changed
 significantly over the past few years.  During much of the 1970's
 China saw the US and its NATO allies on the defensive and Soviet
 power and influence expanding.  Hence, China favored a "united
 front" strategy to check Soviet expansion and viewed
 normalization of relations with the US as a key ingredient of
 that strategy.
 But, since 1980 the Chinese believe the balance has begun to
 shift back in favor of the West.   The US and its allies have
 greatly strengthened their military power and resolve in the face
 of the Soviet challenge, while the Soviets have become
 increasingly beset by domestic and foreign policy problems.  Deng
 indicated the Chinese see little chance of that changing under
 Chernenko's "transitional" leadership.
 From China's perspective this shift has had both positive
 and negative consequences, some of which Beijing clearly did not
 anticipate.   Over the short run, for example, it has lessened
 Chinese concern over the Soviet threat to their security.   It has
 also allowed them to drop their call for a united front, to
 distance themselves from the US publicly, and to adopt a more
 flexible strategy toward the Third World designed to enhance
 Chinese influence and combat the Soviets.   The Chinese have been
 particularly critical of those US policies toward the Third World
 they regard as counterproductive and as playing into Soviet
 hands, such as US support for Israel.   China's resulting
 "independent" policy has also reflected its deep suspicion of US
 policy on Taiwan.
 But as the US has moved to rebuild its military strength and
 political resolve, the Chinese fear it has:
 Stimulated US-Soviet competition in Asia that threatens
 to weaken China's position and thus make it even less of
 a factor in the strategic calculations of both
 superpowers.
 Raised in turn the prospect that China will have even
 less leverage with the US over Taiwan as time goes by.
 China's Advice
 Deng and Zhao's complaints and advice to the delegation
 should be seen as reflecting these concerns and therefore as
 self-serving.   Both, for example, emphasized that the United
 States should temper its military buildup and seek to ease
 tensions with the USSR by seeking an arms accord.  They also held
 the United States should avoid military actions in the Third
 World or close association with the so-called "four unsinkable
 aircraft carriers"--Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa and Israel.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP86B0042OR000100290005-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP86B0042OR000100290005-5
 In our view, China would prefer to see a rough strategic
 parity maintained that gives China maximum maneuverability and
 leverage on both sides.  Increased superpower tensions and arms
 competition in particular will only complicate China's ability to
 deal with resulting growth in Soviet military capabilities in
 Asia.  The Chinese are also concerned that the Soviets might
 still succeed in driving a wedge between the US and its European
 allies by exploiting public concern in Europe over the deployment
 of more US missiles there.
 At the same time, China wants to develop closer economic,
 political and perhaps even military ties with the United States,
 but to avoid tarnishing its reputation with the Third World and
 "progressive" parties in the developed countries, or with
 nationalists at home concerned with the issue of Taiwan.
 Deng also criticized US policy in East Asia, especially US
 support for allies and friends like South Korea and Taiwan,
 asserting that this impedes the search for stability in the
 region.   Deng stressed his desire to get out of the "blind
 alleys" of the past which, in the case of Korea, could result in
 what he called a "slide into war."   He referred to President
 Carter's troop withdrawal plan as a "good idea."  He offered his
 own vaguely defined proposals stressing "confederation" as a
 means to stabilize the situations not only in Korea and Taiwan,
 but also Hong Kong, Macao and the Nansha (Spratly) Islands.  We
 believe Deng sees a stronger US as less willing to compromise on
 issues like Taiwan and Korea on terms advantageous to the PRC or
 its North Korean ally.
 Finally, Deng and Zhao focused on alleged American
 unwillingness to modify US laws and procedures (e.g. Taiwan
 Relations Act, Export Administration procedures) to accommodate
 China.  This again reflects in part China's concern that the US
 no longer heeds China as much as in the past as a strategic asset
 against the USSR, and therefore will be less likely to
 accommodate Chinese interests.  Zhao was especially outspoken in
 asserting that China "will never agree" to be a "second class
 partner" of the US, but will resist just as it resisted Soviet
 efforts to make China a "junior partner" in the past.

 1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT.
 2.  SUMMARY.  ON FEBRUARY 22 DENG XIAOPING MET WITH A
 GROUP FROM THE GEORGETOWN CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND
 INTERNATIONAL STUDIES HEADED BY ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI.
 IN CHARACTERISTICALLY FRANK AND VIGOROUS FASHION, DENG
 REVIEWED THE HISTORY OF SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS OVER
 THE LAST TEN YEARS, ACKNOWLEDGING THE ELEMENTS OF STRA-
 TEGIC COOPERATION THAT HAD PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN
 THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE EARLY YEARS, WHILE TOUCHING ON
 THE ALLEGEDLY NEGATIVE ROLE OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT
 SINCE ITS PASSAGE.  DENG ARGUED THAT THE CHANGE IN

 CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY TO DOWNPLAY SINO-AMERICAN STRA-
 TEGIC COOPERATION WAS THE RESULT OF A REVERSION ON THE
 PART OF THE U.S. TO THE DULLES DOCTRINE OF UNSINKABLE
 AIRCRAFT CARRIERS -- U.S. STRONGHOLDS ABROAD SUCH AS
 SOUTH KOREA, TAIWAN, ISRAEL AND SOUTH AFRICA, WHICH
 ALIENATE THE THIRD WORLD FROM THE U.S. AND RAISE QUES-
 TIONS ABOUT THE U.S. VIEW OF CHINA OVER THE LONG TERM.
 DENG DESCRIBED THE NOW ABANDONED U.S. INTENTION (UNDER
 THE EARLY CARTER ADMINISTRATION) TO WITHDRAW U.S.
 TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA AS A GOOD STRATEGIC MOVE,
 WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT KOREA CONSTITUTED A SPECIAL
 SITUATION BECAUSE OF ITS REGIONAL IMPACT.  IN ALL THESE
 CASES, HOWEVER, THE U.S. SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE STRATEGIC
 DISADVANTAGE RESULTING FROM WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL
 OPPOSITION TO U.S. POLICIES.
 3.  ON SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS, DENG SAID HE EXPECTED NO
 CHANGES FROM ANDROPOV'S POLICIES UNDER THE CERNENKO RE-
 GIME, AND THUS NO DRAMATIC CHANGES IN SINO-SOVIET RE-
 LATIONS.  DENG ALSO SPOKE AT LENGTH OF HIS INTEREST IN
 THE IDEA OF "CONFEDERATION," BOTH AS A SOLUTION TO THE
 HONG KONG AND TAIWAN CASES THAT "COULD BE EXPLAINED TO
 OUR PEOPLE" AND THAT COULD RESULT IN "ONE CHINA AND
 THREE SYSTEMS."  THIS OR OTHER SOLUTIONS TRANSCENDING
 THE QUESTION OF SOVEREIGNTY ALSO COULD BE APPLIED TO
 THE KOREAN PENINSULA CASE AND EVEN TO OTHER INTERNATIONAL
 PROBLEMS, SUCH AS THE SPRATLY ISLANDS, THE FALKLANDS
 AND JAPAN'S NORTHERN ISLANDS.
 4.  DENG'S CRITICISMS OF U.S. STRATEG9C POLICY REMIND
 US THAT CHINA'S INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY HAS ANOTHER
 DIMENSION BEYOND THE CHINA-US-USSR TRIANGULAR RELATION-
 SHIP:  IT STRENGTHENS THIRD WORLD SUPPORT FOR CHINA ON
 THE TAIWAN QUESTION.  HIS BROAD BRUSH SUGGESTIONS ABOUT
 THE USE OF THE "CONFEDERATION" APPROACH EMPHASIZE AGAIN
 THE SCOPE OF HIS REGIME'S PROPOSALS FOR HONG KONG AND
 TAIWAN AND CHINESE READINESS TO ACCEPT THE LOOSEST SORT
 OF CONFEDERATION AS AN APPROACH TO RESOLVING TENSIONS
 ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA.  END SUMMARY.
 5.  PRC LEADER DENG XIAOPING ON FEB 22 HELD LENGTHY
 TALKS WITH VISITING U.S. GROUP FROM GEORGETOWN CENTER
 FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES.  DENG GAVE
 SOMEWHAT NEW TWISTS TO OLD THEMES, PARTICULARLY ON
 THE REASON FOR DIMINISHED PRC INTEREST IN PARALLEL
 STRATEGIC POLICIES AND ACTIONS WITH USG.  DENG ALSO
 FLOATED A RATHER CLOUDY NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT
 PROBLEMS OF SOVEREIGNTY VS ACTUAL CONTROL IN CASES
 OF HONG KONG, TAIWAN, KOREA, MALVINAS/FALKLANDS, ETC.
 EMBASSY COMMENTS APPEAR AT END OF THIS MESSAGE.  AMB.
 HUMMEL WAS PRESENT, TOOK NOTES, AND DRAFTED THIS.
 6.  LED BY DR. AMOS JORDAN, THE CSIS GROUP INCLUDED
 MELVIN LAIRD, ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI, SENATOR FRANK
 MURKOWSKI, CONGRESSMAN MATTHEW MC HUGH, MR. ERIC
 HOTUNG (COSMOPOLITAN PROPERTIES AND SECURITIES),
 MR. JOHN MAROUS (WESTINGHOUSE), AND DR. LERRIT GONG
 (CSIS).
 7.  DENG OPENED BY REFERRING, AS HE OFTEN DOES, TO HIS

 OWN AGE AND ALLEGED FRAILTY, AND TO HIS REDUCED OFFICIAL
 DUTIES.  HE SAID HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING, AND
 HOSTING LUNCH FOR, PRESIDENT REAGAN IN APRIL, AND NOTED
 FROM THE TELEVISION HE HAD SEEN THAT THE PRESIDENT, AT
 73, IS VERY VIGOROUS.  DENG EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR
 GREATER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE U.S. AND PRC, SO THAT
 EXDIS

 TAGS:  PREL, TW, CH, US
 SUBJECT:  DENG XIAOPING CONVERSATION WITH CSIS DELEGATION
 THE FURTHER PROGRESS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS, WHICH BOTH
 SIDES WANT, WOULD BE FACILITATED.
 8.  BRZEZINSKI RAISED A SUBJECT THAT TOOK UP MOST OF
 THE MEETING.  HE POINTED OUT THAT US/PRC RELATIONS BEGAN
 WITH A SHARED STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE.  DENG HAD RE-
 EMPHASIZED THE STRATEGIC ELEMENT IN TALKS WITH BRZEZINSKI
 IN 1978 AND 79, WHEN DENG AGREED THAT SHARED PERSPECTIVE
 MADE POSSIBLE EXPANDED RELATIONS IN OTHER FIELDS.  HOW-
 EVER, NOW THAT PERSPECTIVE HAS DIMINISHED, AND THE CSIS
 GROUP HAD BEEN TOLD IN RECENT DAYS THAT THE CURRENT U.S.
 MILITARY BUILDUP IN FACT CONTRIBUTES TO THE GLOBAL ARMS
 RACE, AND INCREASES THE DANGER OF WAR.  BRZEZINSKI EM-
 PHASIZED THAT IN THE U.S. VIEW, THE U.S. BUILDUP IN FACT
 DETERS WAR AND DETERS SOVIET ADVENTURISM.  HE CLOSED
 WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT IF THE TWO COUNTRIES DIVERGE
 STRATEGICALLY, THEN U.S. POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE RELA-
 TIONSHIP, WHICH IS STRONG AND GETTING STRONGER, WILL BE
 REDUCED.
 9.  DENG EMBARKED ON A LONG (AND SOMEWHAT TORTURED)
 EXPLANATION.  THE FOLLOWING IS NEAR-VERBATIM.
 10.  I HAVE BEEN, AND All, AN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER OF
 GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.  I SHALL REVIEW THE HISTORY
 OF THOSE RELATIONS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  MAO, ZHOU,
 NIXON AND KISSINGER PRODUCED A TURNING POINT IN RELA-
 TIONS.  OUR CHINESE STRATEGY THEN, LED BY MAO, WAS TO
 PR?DUCE AN ANTI-SOVIET UNITED FRONT FROM EAST TO WEST,
 IN THE FACE OF A VERY AGGRESSIVE SOVIET STANCE, WHERE
 THE SOVIETS WERE INTERFERING IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD.
 THE SOVIETS WERE ON THE OFFENSIVE WHILE THE U.S. WAS ON
 THE DEFENSIVE.  I REMEMBER TELLING A U.S. CONGRESSIONAL
 GROUP IN '74 OR '75 THAT EACH STEP FORWARD BY THE
 SOVIETS IS LIKE EATING A PIECE OF THE U.S.  AT THE END
 OF WW II, THE U.S. WAS IN A CONTROLLING POSITION, BUT
 EVERY STEP BY THE SOVIETS DIMINISHED THE U.S.  THE
 U.S. WAS TOO FAT AND TOO WEAK.  SOVIET MILITARY STRENGTH
 THEN EXCEEDED THAT OF THE U.S. AND WESTERN EUROPE COMBINED.
 WE TOLD ALL OF THE VISITORS TO CHINA THAT TO DEAL WITH
 SOVIET AGGRESSION THEY SHOULD NOT RELY ONLY ON THE U.S.,
 BUT SHOULD PRESENT A UNITED FRONT, FROM EAST TO WEST.
 11.  I TOLD PRES. CARTER THAT RHETORIC WAS NOT ENOUGH
 TO DEAL WITH THE SOVIETS, AND THAT WE NEEDED SERIOUS WORK,
 FOR INSTANCE FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN
 THE U.S. AND CHINA, A CHINA-JAPAN TREATY OF PEACE AND
 FRIENDSHIP, ETC.  THE PEAK PERIOD IN US/PRC RELATIONS
 WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  AFTER

 THAT THERE WERE TWISTS AND TURNS, PARTICULARLY THE
 PASSAGE IN TUE U.S. OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT.  WE
 PROTESTED THEN, BUT NOT VERY STRONGLY, BECAUSE THAT
 WAS ON THE EVE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN
 AND WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT CAUSE DIFFICULTIES FOR THE
 ADMINISTRATION (COMMENT:  TRA ACTUALLY WAS PASSED,
 AND CHINESE PROTESTED IN APRIL 1979).  BUT WE HAVE
 NEVER UNDERESTIMATED THE INJURY TO CHINA CAUSED BY THE
 TRA.
 12.  ON THE GLOBAL SCENE THE U.S. HAS AUGMENTED ITS
 MILITARY STRENGTH, AND WE DO NOT CRITICIZE THAT, BUT
 THE U.S. DOES SOME THINGS WITH WHICH WE DO NOT AGREE.
 WE HOPE THAT OUR U.S. FRIENDS WILL ASSESS THE THINGS
 YOU ARE DOING, SOME OF WHICH ARE NO, POPULAR WITH
 MANY OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLES.  (I AM SAYING THESE THINGS,
 YOU NOTE, IN A CALM ATMOSPHERE WITH THE CONSTRUCTIVE
 PURPOSE OF INCREASING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER.)
 13.  MANY GOOD IDEAS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY U.S.
 STRATEGISTS HAVE NOW DISAPPEARED.  FOR INSTANCE SOME
 IN THE U.S. ONCE ADVOCATED WITHDRAWAL OF YOUR FORCES
 FROM SOUTH KOREA, BUT THAT IDEA HAS BEEN ABANDONED.
 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD STRATEGIC MOVE.  THEN
 THERE IS THE QUESTION OF ISRAEL.  I ASKED PRES. CARTER
 WHY THE U.S. SHOULD BE HOSTILE TO 140 MILLION ARABS
 AND IN FAVOR OF ISRAEL, AND POINTED OUT TO HIM THAT
 IF THE U.S. CHANGED THAT POLICY THE SOVIETS COULD NOT
 EXDIS
 E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR
 TAGS:  PREL, TW, CH, US
 SUBJECT:  DENG XIAOPING CONVERSATION WITH CSIS DELEGATION
 DO ANYTHING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  I ADVOCATED THIS FROM
 THE POINT OF VIEW OF DEALING WITH SOVIET DESIGNS WORLD-
 WIDE.          WHY SHOULD THE U.S. TAKE THE SIDE OF THE UK IN
 THE FALKLANDS DISPUTE?  DID YOU THINK THE UK WAS NOT
 STRONG ENOUGH (LAUGHING)?  YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT, IF
 YOU ARE STRONG FROM THE MORAL POINT OF VIEW, THAT'S
 ENOUGH.  THERE ARE SIMILAR MISTAKES IN THE CARRIBEAN.
 14.  THUS THE CHANGE IN OUR GLOBAL VIEW CAME ABOUT BECAUSE
 OF CHANGES BY THE U.S., NOT BY CHINA.  THERE HAS BEEN A
 CHANGE IN THE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARD TAIWAN, ALSO.  THE
 SOVIETS HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE, AND WE DO NOT OBJECT TO A
 U.S. BUILDUP TO CORRECT THE BALANCE.  THE PROBLEM IS
 WHAT YOU WILL DO LATER WITH THAT STRENGTH WHICH MAY
 NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE.
 15.  IN MY MIND SOME U.S. POLITICAL FIGURES HAVE REVIVED
 PARTS OF AN OLD DULLES DOCTRINE.  IF THE U.S. WANTS TO
 REGAIN THE INITIATIVE, YOU SHOULD ABANDON YOUR IDEA OF
 UNSINKABLE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS -- ALL FOUR OF THEM IN
 SOUTH KOREA, TAIWAN, ISRAEL, AND SOUTH AFRICA.  THE
 SOUTH KOREA SITUATION IS A SEPARATE QUESTION BECAUSE IT
 IMPACTS ON AN ENTIRE REGION.  BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT
 TAIWAN, WHERE BECAUSE OF YOUR IDEA OF AN UNSINKABLE AIR-
 CRAFT CARRIER YOU CANNOT SAY THAT YOU ARE A TRUE FRIEND
 OF THE ONE BILLION CHINESE PEOPLE.  IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
 BECAUSE YOU SUPPORT 3 MILLION ISRAELIS, YOU JEOPARDIZE

 A
 RELATIONS WITH 140 MILLION ARABS.  BY YOUR SOUTH AFRICA
 POLICIES YOU ALIENATE ALL OTHER AFRICANS.  THUS THERE
 ARE INSOLUBLE PROBLEMS BETWEEN YOURSELVES AND THE 4 BIL-
 LION PEOPLE (SIC) OF CHINA, THE ARABS, AND AFRICA.
 16.  PRES. REAGAN SHOULD MAKE A SOBER ASSESSMENT.  HOW-
 EVER, I WILL OF COURSE NOT GO THIS FAR OR THIS DEEPLY
 IN MY TALKS WITH THE PRESIDENT.  STILL, YOU SHOULD CON-
 SIDER WHETHER YOU HAVE GAINED OR LOST IN ALIENATING SO
 MANY PEOPLE BY YOUR POLICIES OF THESE FOUR UNSINKABLE
 CARRIERS.  I AM NOT DELIBERATELY TRYING TO BE CRITICAL,
 BUT WANT TO MAKE A HELPFUL ASSESSMENT AS WE SEE IT.
 17.  BRZEZINSKI THANKED DENG FOR HIS FRANK AND USEFUL
 COMMENTS, AND FOR SHARING HIS OPINIONS.  HOWEVER, HE
 SAID, HE WANTED TO DIFFER WITH DENG BOTH ON CENTRAL
 ISSUES AND ON PERIPHERAL ONES.  FOR ONE THING, THE U.S.
 HAS BEEN DETERRING THE SOVIETS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY NOW
 THAN IN THE RECENT PAST.  AS A RESULT, THE WHOLE WORLD
 HAS BENEFITTED.  THE US/CHINA RELATIONSHIP IS CENTRAL
 TO WORLD PEACE, AND WE WANT TO STRENGTHEN IT.  WE DO
 NOT DELIBERATELY CREATE PROBLEMS OVER TAIWAN.  THERE
 ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS AMONG DOMESTIC GROUPS IN THE U.S.
 OVER TAIWAN, BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF WIDENING OF US/PRC
 RELATIONS, HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT TAIWAN WOULD BE
 ADDRESSED IN WAYS CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIRES OF THE
 CHINESE PEOPLE.  ALSO, CENTRAL TO US/PRC RELATIONS,
 HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT TAIWAN WOULD BE ADDRESSED IN WAYS
 CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIRES OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE.
 ALSO, CENTRAL TO US IS THE ISSUE OF PEACE IN KOREA.
 IF WE WERE TO WITHDRAW OUR FORCES FROM THE SOUTH, THAT
 WOULD CREATE  INSTABILITY UNLESS PRECEDED BY POLITICAL
 AGREEMENTS BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH.
 18.  JORDAN ASKED FOR DENG'S ASSESSMENT OF THE NEW
 LEADERSHIP IN THE USSR.
 19.  DENG REPLIED:  I KNEW ANDROPOV, BUT I DO NOT KNOW
 CHERNENKO.  I THINK THERE WILL NOT BE ANY CHANGE.
 CHERNENKO CANNOT DECIDE ALONE ON ANY POLICY.  ANDROPOV
 HAD SOME ABILITY TO DECIDE ALONE, BUT NOT CHERNENKO.
 ANDROPOV WAS MORE CAPABLE AND MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE THAN
 BREZHNEV.  NO, THERE WILL BE NO CHANGES, AND THEY WILL,
 BE MORE RIGID AND IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO
 MAKE BIG DECISIONS.  SO, I THINK CHERNENKO IS A TRANSI-
 TIONAL FIGURE.  THEY HAVE NOT SOLVED THEIR SUCCESSION
 PROBLEMS, AND THIS DEMONSTRATES THEIR DIFFICULTIES.
 20.  AS FOR SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS, WE WILL STICK TO
 OUR INSISTENCE THAT THEY MUST REMOVE THE "THREE
 OBSTACLES."  HOWEVER, WE ARE NEIGHBORS, AND SO LACK OF

 PROPOSAL FOR CONFEDERATION IS GOOD.  I HAVE BEEN
 THINKING FOR. MANY YEARS THAT THE IDEA OF CONFEDERATION
 MAY BE A GOOD THING FOR CHINA.  OUR POLICIES TOWARD
 TAIWAN ARE REASONABLE.  THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS,
 CAPITALIST AND SOCIALIST, BUT THERE COULD BE ONE CHINA
 WITH TWO SYSTEMS.  IN THE CASE OF HONG KONG ALSO,
 THERE COULD BE ONE CHINA AND TWO SYSTEMS, SO THAT
 ALTOGETHER IN CHINA THERE COULD BE THREE SYSTEMS,
 WITH THOSE IN TAIWAN AND HONG KONG DIFFERENT.  THIS
 IS A GOOD FORMAT ALSO FOR KOREA, TO AVOID A SLIDE INTO
 WAR TO SETTLE THAT PROBLEM.  THIS SORT OF FORM COULD
 BE EXPLAINED TO OUR PEOPLE.  IN FACT, IN MANY INTER-
 NATIONAL DISPUTES YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY OUR
 POLICY ON KOREA -- IN TERMS OF ONE KOREA WITH TWO
 SYSTEMS TO INCREASE LONG-TERM STABILITY.  WE WILL
 RESUME SOVEREIGNTY OVER HONG KONG WITHOUT ANY HARM
 TO THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THE PEOPLE THERE.  SOME
 DAY GERMANY MAY UNIFY ITSELF WITH TWO DIFFERENT
 SYSTEMS.  WE MUST WORK OUT OF SOME BLIND ALLEYS WE
 ARE IN.
 22.  ON ANOTHER TOPIC, JAPAN, THEY HAVE ASKED US TO
 SUPPORT THEIR STAND ON THEIR NORTHERN ISLANDS, WITH
 DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SOVIETS.  I TOLD THE JAPANESE THIS
 COULD NOT BE DONE NOW, BUT PERHAPS LATER.  MAYBE IN DUE
 COURSE THERE COULD BE JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THE AREAS,
 WITHOUT DECIDING ON THE SOVEREIGNTY QUESTION.  ALSO IN
 THE MALVINAS, MAYBE A NEW WAY OF THINKING COULD BE
 USED; OTHERWISE, THE ARGENTINES WILL NEVER GIVE UP
 THEIR CLAIM.  THERE ARE MANY SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN THE
 WORLD THAT NEED NEW WAYS OF THINKING.  FOR INSTANCE,
 OUR NAN-SHA ISLANDS (IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA) HAVE
 ALWAYS BEEN CHINESE TERRITORY.  TAIWAN HAS OCCUPIED
 ONE, WHICH SHOWS THAT IT IS CHINESE TERRITORY,  BUT
 VIETNAM, THE PHILIPPINES AND MALAYSIA HAVE ALSO OCCU-
 PIED SOME OF THESE CHINESE ISLANDS.        WE MUST INSIST ON
 CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY REGARDLESS OF WHO OCCUPIES THEM.
 BUT CAN WE FIND SOME NEW APPROACH?  OTHERWISE, THERE
 COULD BE LONG-TERM AND EVEN EXPLOSIVE PROBLEMS.  I AM
 MERELY TALKING FROM THE TOP OF MY MIND.  IF THE OLD
 WAYS OF DEALING WITH SUCH THINGS ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
 CANNOT WE FIND NEW WAYS?
 23.  SOME OF MY REMARKS MAY NOT BE WELL THOUGHT OUT.
 BUT WE MUST  EARCH FOR WAYS TO INCREASE STABILITY AND
 PEACE IN THE WORLD.  WE CHINESE ARE NOT LESS HOPEFUL
 FOR PEACE THAN OTHERS.  WE MUST CONCENTRATE ON OUR
 MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS. YOU GENTLEMEN ARE ARCHITECTS
 OF POLICIES, AND I INVITE YOU TO CONSIDER SUCH NEW WAYS.
 24. I HAVE ENJOYED MEETING YOU.
 25.  COMMENT.  DENG'S PRESENTATION WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFUSE,
 BUT AS DELIVERED TO THE DELEGATION, IT WAS CHARACTERIS-
 TICALLY VIGOROUS.  DENG APPEARED HEALTHY AND ALERT,
 WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF THE POINTS HE WANTED TO MAKE.

 MOST STRONGLY:

 PREPARED TO SKEW HISTORY SOMEWHAT TO EMPHASIZE CHINA'S
 "CONSISTENT" VIEW OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT AS A
 CENTRAL IMPEDIMENT TO GOOD U.S.        RELATIONS.  CHINA
 MAY WELL HAVE EASED UP ON ITS EARLY REACTION TO THE
 TRA IN CONSIDERATION OF U.S. DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONSID-
 ERATIONS.  MORE LIKELY, DENG'S OWN DOMESTIC POLITICAL
 PROBLEMS LEFT HIM UNABLE OR UNINTERESTED IN CASTING MUD
 ON HIS MOST VISIBLE POLITICAL SUCCESS.  IN ANY EVENT,
 DENG'S VERSION WILL CONSTITUTE REVEALED TRUTH ON THIS
 POINT FOR THE CHINESE.

 SUBJECT:  DENG XIAOPING CONVERSATION WITH CSIS DELEGATION
 -    -- SECOND DENG'S REITERATION OF THE "UNSINKABLE
 AIRCRAFT CARRIERS" LINE IN HIS CRITICISM OF U.S.
 STRATEGIC DOCTRINE IS, AS USUAL, SPARKED BY CONCERN
 THAT THE U.S. SEES ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH TAIWAN AS A
 STRATEGIC ASSET FROM WHICH TO "CONTAIN" CHINA, I.E.J.
 AS EVIDENCE THAT THE U.S. CONTINUES TO SEE CHINA AS A
 POTENTIAL ADVERSARY.  WE NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT DENG'S
 COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS CAUSED FOR THE U.S. BY OUR
 SUPPORT OF SOUTH KOREA, TAIWAN, SOUTH AFRICA AND ISREAL
 ON THIS OCCASION HIGHLIGHT "POPULAR" OPPOSITION TO
 U.S. POLICIES AMONG THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES.  DENG NEVER
 REFERS DIRECTLY TO CHINA'S READJUSTMENT OF FOREIGN
 POLICY TO A MORE INDEPENDENT STANCE IN THE LAST FEW
 YEARS, NOR TO CHINA'S SHIFT TOWARD SUPPORT OF THIRD
 WORLD POSITIONS ACROSS THE BOARD.  HE ALSO OMITTED
 ANOTHER CONSIDERATION WE KNOW TO HAVE BEEN A STRONG
 FACTOR -  CHINESE SENSITIVITY TO SOVIET AND OTHER
 CRITICISMS THAT THE PRC MERELY FOLLOWED ALONG BEHIND
 U.S. POLICIES.  BUT HIS COMMENTS ARE A REMINDER THAT
 CHINA'S "INDEPENDENT" FOREIGN POLICY HAS A DIMENSION
 BEYOND THE U.S.-USSR-CHINA TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP.
 -    -- ON KOREA, DENG'S COMMENTS MANIFEST THE
 AMBIVALENT ATTITUDE THAT HAS FOR SOME TIME MARKED
 CHINESE PUBLIC COMMENTS.  ON THE ONE HAND, U.S. WITH-
 DRAWAL FROM THE PENINSULA IN THE LATE 70'S WOULD HAVE
 BEEN A GOOD STRATEGIC MOVE; ON THE OTHER HAND, KOREA
 IS A SEPARATE QUESTION FROM THAT OF THE OTHER AMERICAN
 STRONGHOLDS BECAUSE IT IMPACTS ON AN ENTIRE REGION.
 -    -- DENG'S BROAD-BRUSH SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE USE
 OF THE "CONFEDERATION APPROACH" EMPHASIZE AGAIN THE
 SCOPE OF HIS REGIME'S PROPOSALS FOR HONG KONG AND
 TAIWAN AND CHINESE READINESS TO ACCEPT THE LOOSEST
 SORT OF PAPER CONFEDERATION AS AN APPROACH TO RESOLVING
 TENSIONS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA.  SIMILARLY HIS
 SUGGESTION THAT WAYS MIGHT BE FOUND TO TRANSCEND THE
 ISSUES OF SOVEREIGNTY THAT UNDERLIE OTHER TERRITORIAL
 DISPUTES IS AN ENCOURAGING SIGN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
 SPRATLY AND SENKAKU DISPUTES.  ALTHOUGH VAGUE AND
 ILL-DEFINED, THIS "THINKING OFF THE TOP OF THE MIND"
 REFLECTS DENG'S PENCHANT FOR BOLD STROKES THAT CUT AT
 THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS FACING CHINA AND HIS READINESS

 KEY JUDGMENTS
 We believe that China will work to make the visit a success in both
 substance and appearance. Beijing's major expectations will be in the
 economic area-especially on prospects for trade and improved tech-
 nology transfers-where it will attempt to remedy the "substantive"
 deficiencies that Premier Zhao perceived in his visit to the United
 States. In particular, the Chinese want to gain greater access to US
 technology and investment capital to enable them to further their
 modernization programs. We doubt they will reciprocate for any US
 concessions.
 Perhaps Beijing's primary objective in receiving the President will
 be to solidify a personal relationship at the highest levels of the two gov-
 ernments to give a sense of continuity to relations with the United
 States. To achieve this, the Chinese are likely to make certain that the
 visit has the appearance of significant accomplishment. They will invest
 the visit with ceremonial pomp and lavish detail in order to convey a fa-
 vorable impression to the American public.
 Beijing probably believes that the President, in this election year,
 would like to portray his trip to China as a clear success, thus giving
 China extra room to exploit it to their benefit, particularly by pressing
 for concessions in the economic and technology areas. It may also press
 for a general Presidential affirmation of US willingness to consider the
 transfer of advanced military technology.
 Taiwan remains the one issue on which the relationship could
 founder. The Chinese hope the United States will handle its relations
 with Taiwan in a way that allows Beijing to pursue broader objectives
 with the United States. Although Beijing already has protested the
 announced level of US arms sales to Taiwan for fiscal year 1985, they
 may also press the issue vigorously during the visit. Given the recent
 growth of Chinese concern over possible support in the United States-
 especially in the Congress-for Taiwan independence, the President is
 likely to be pressed by the Chinese leaders for reassurances that the
 United States adheres to a one-China policy. Furthermore, they may
 specifically ask for an administration commitment to oppose any
 Congressional actions in support of Taiwan independence.

 The Chinese are likely to engage in strategic discussions with the
 President somewhat broader in scope than those undertaken during
 Zhao's visit, but the Chinese will attempt to avoid projecting a public
 image of collaboration with the United States. The Chinese leaders will
 probably use these talks to urge a greater US role in Kampuchea and Af-
 ghanistan. The Chinese will reaffirm their interest in stability on the
 Korean Peninsula and support the North Korean interest in tripartite
 talks.
 Beijing clearly believes that Chinese interests are best served for
 the foreseeable future by productive and stable relations with the
 United States, but there are also equally clear constraints on how far it is
 willing to permit those relations to develop. One such limit is its need to
 be perceived by the rest of the world as not under US (or Soviet)
 influence. There are sharp limits on the extent to which China will
 cooperate with the United States on strategic issues. This is more than
 merely a tactic to enable Beijing to show that it pursues an "independ-
 ent" foreign policy. It represents the balance that China is attempting to
 strike in its foreign policy as it moves somewhat closer to the United
 States but continues to pursue other goals that at times conflict with US
 policies.
 Beijing opened its dialogue with the United States in the early
 1970s to obtain a strategic counterweight to Soviet power. This remains
 a basic consideration as Beijing formulates its policies toward the United
 States. China will use its contacts with the United States-especially the
 President's visit-to attempt to underscore the commonality of US-
 Chinese security concerns regarding the Soviet involvement in Afghani-
 stan and Southeast Asia. Beijing may also hope to increase pressure on
 Moscow to make concessions on issues of major security concern to
 China but does not appear optimistic about a breakthrough.

 DISCUSSION
 Recent Developments in US-Chinese Relations
 1. The atmosphere surrounding US-Chinese rela-
 tions has improved substantially over the past year.
 Although still circumscribed by differences in a num-
 ber of areas, these relations have passed through
 several difficult periods to achieve a new stability and
 direction. The successive visits to China in 1983 of the
 Secretaries of State, Commerce, and Defense, as well
 as visits to Washington of five Chinese ministers
 during the same period, helped revitalize these rela-
 tions and laid the groundwork for the exchange of
 visits between President Reagan and Premier Zhao.
 2. While far from complete, the process of stabiliza-
 tion advanced during the past year largely because
 Beijing recognized that its interests are served better
 by healthy Sino-US relations than by continued mutu-
 al acrimony. It appears that China made this adjust-
 ment sometime in the spring of 1983-following the
 Secretary of State's talks in Beijing-after a period in
 which it had managed a number of relatively minor
 irritants in a way that suggested a willingness to allow
 relations to stagnate.
 3. Several factors encouraged this shift toward im-
 proving relations. The Chinese realized that the pres-
 ent administration might well be returned to office for
 another term in 1984. At about the same time, the
 United States eased controls on the transfer of technol-
 ogy to China. These two events appear to have
 convinced the Chinese leaders that it was both neces-
 sary and possible to do business with the Reagan
 administration. The Chinese were also concerned last
 spring that the administration was beginning to accord
 a lower priority to relations with China. Beijing may
 have believed that this was at least in part the result of
 the generally sour tone that it had given to relations.
 4. In addition to these calculations were those relat-
 ing to the USSR. In the spring of 1983, Beijing
 appeared dissatisfied with the pace of bilateral talks
 with the USSR, and it may have concluded that the
 apparent impasse in Chinese-US relations had reduced
 Moscow's incentive to reach agreements with China.
 At the same time, Chinese public statements suggested
 some concern that the USSR and the United States
 might be moving toward a moderate reduction in their
 bilateral tensions, a step that could weaken Chinese
 freedom of maneuver between the superpowers. Sub-
 sequent events, in particular the KAL incident, con-
 vinced China that there was no immediate prospect of
 a reduction in US-Soviet tensions. Moreover, Beijing
 was reassured by the firm US position at INF talks
 opposing regional sublimits that discriminated against
 the East Asian countries.
 5. Improved relations with Washington also ap-
 peared attractive because of China's recognition that
 Soviet power around China's periphery continued to
 increase with the upgrading of forces poised against
 China and Japan, the steady deployment of SS-20s in
 the East, the continued expansion of the Soviet Pacific
 Fleet, and steady expansion of the Soviet presence in
 Vietnam.
 6. As a result of these factors, China has muted
 somewhat its criticisms of the United States, with the
 exception of a period in late November and early
 December 1983 when a flareup over Congressional
 actions relating to Taiwan momentarily appeared to
 jeopardize the exchange of visits between Zhao and
 the President. Beijing quickly backed off from its
 implied threats-voiced by party Chairman Hu Yao-
 bang in Tokyo-to cancel Zhao's visit, but only after it
 received what it could regard as reassurances on US
 policy toward Taiwan.
 7. Chinese domestic politics have also played a role
 in setting the tone of Beijing's responses to US actions.
 We are, however, unable to determine what weight to
 give this factor. It appears, for instance, that residual
 opposition to improved relations with Washington
 began to emerge at the time of the November flareup
 over Taiwan and may have sharpened the Chinese
 response to US actions by fusing itself with the current
 campaign against spiritual pollution. At present, how-
 ever, we believe that Deng is able to contain the

 opposition and will probably continue to be able to do
 so over the coming months, in part because there is
 agreement among Chinese leaders concerning the
 strategic importance of the relationship.
 The United States in China's "Independent"
 Foreign Policy
 8. The recent improvement in Sino-US relations has
 taken place within the context of a readjustment of
 Chinese foreign policy over the past three years.
 Described by Beijing as "independent," this foreign
 policy has sought to accommodate conflicting desires
 and interests in a manner that gives Beijing maximum
 flexibility and room for maneuver between the super-
 powers. The main features of this policy have been
 efforts to ease tensions with the USSR, moves to
 improve Chinese standing in the Third World, greater
 contacts with the industrially advanced countries, and
 a redefinition of interests in dealing with the United
 States.
 9. This readjustment was caused by a number of
 factors, including Beijing's uncertainty over US poli-
 cies toward Taiwan; concern over policies in the Third
 World, which increased the cost to China of close
 identification with the United States; and indications
 of a Soviet desire to ease tensions with China. China
 continued to share with the United States the percep-
 tion that the Soviet Union represented its primary
 security threat, but it was no longer seen as either
 necessary or desirable for China to be seen in a
 "united front" with the United States against Moscow.
 Behind these tactical circumstances there was also a
 broad Chinese theoretical reassessment of the world
 situation. This reassessment has been based on Beijing's
 perception of a slow but progressive economic and
 political weakening of both the United States and the
 USSR in relation to the rest of the world. In the
 Chinese view, over the long term this situation will
 diminish the ability of the superpowers to dominate
 the world scene and to control their respective blocs.
 This, in turn, has led China to believe that over the
 next decade and more there will be progressively
 greater opportunities for other powers, including Chi-
 na, to seek gains and to assert their own interests with
 less reference to the United States and the USSR.
 10. This same perception has led the Chinese to
 believe that they can maneuver more freely between
 the United States and the USSR. Thus, for instance, in
 dealing with the USSR China has concluded that the
 Soviets' own economic, political, and military prob-
 lems have made the threat of an immediate Soviet
 attack on China less likely, enabling China to permit
 tensions to ease and to pursue such goals as increased
 trade. China has also concluded that it can and should
 criticize US international conduct in areas such as the
 Middle East and southern Africa, both to distance
 itself from the United States and to attempt to provide
 an outside source of support to those groups that do
 not want close association with either Washington or
 Moscow.
 11. Beijing has followed this approach actively in
 Western Europe, where it publicly has opposed new
 missile deployments of both superpowers. However, in
 private conversations the Chinese have reportedly
 sometimes supported deployment and sometimes op-
 posed it. In condemning both US and Soviet "hegem-
 onism," Beijing has given moral support to the Euro-
 pean peace movement.
 12. One of the difficulties that Beijing has created
 for itself has been that of structuring relations with the
 United States in a manner compatible with its revised
 perspectives on the international situation-the so-
 called independent foreign policy. In recent years
 Chinese policy has sought to strike a workable balance
 between the strategic importance of Sino-US relations
 and China's ambitions to be independent in the world.
 This has led to inconsistencies in Chinese behavior and
 has accounted for some of the continuing tension in
 Sino-US relations. Currently, the Chinese leaders have
 moved toward closer relations with the United States,
 without, however, muting their independent foreign
 policy line. This has occurred in part because China
 has a less immediate fear of a Soviet attack and also as
 a consequence of its perception that the United States
 is no longer on the defensive in dealing with the USSR
 in the world.
 What China Seeks From the United States and
 the Visit
 Beijing's Goals for President Reagan's Visit
 13. We believe that China will work to make the
 visit a success in both substance and appearance.
 Beijing's major expectations will be in the economic
 4
 SECRET
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP86B0042OR000100290005-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP86B00420R000100290005-5
 area-especially on prospects for trade and improved
 technology transfers-where it will attempt to remedy
 the "substantive" deficiencies that Zhao perceived in
 his visit to the United States. There also will be greater
 attempts to achieve breadth in political and strategic
 discussions, but the Chinese will avoid projecting a
 public image of collaboration with the United States.
 In addition, Beijing is almost certain to seek reassur-
 ances that US support for a one-China policy has not
 changed.
 14. Perhaps Beijing's primary objective in receiving
 the President will be to solidify a personal relationship
 at the highest levels of the two governments. This will
 be done in the expectation that the current administra-
 tion will probably be in office through 1988. The
 Chinese appear anxious at this point to give a sense of
 continuity to relations with the United States, attach-
 ing great importance to the establishment of good
 personal relationships between leaders. Deng probably
 has initiated this effort, hoping to leave to his succes-
 sors a solid US-Chinese relationship at the political and
 personal levels. To achieve this, the Chinese are likely
 to make certain that the visit has the appearance of
 significant accomplishment. They will invest the visit
 with ceremonial pomp and lavish detail to convey a
 favorable impression to the American public.
 15. Expanded Trade and Technology Transfer.
 Unlike President Nixon's visit to China in 1972, when
 the Chinese wanted to discuss strategic concerns,
 Beijing will probably attempt to use the favorable
 atmosphere that they have generated this time mainly
 to press for progress in the economic sphere. In
 particular, they want to gain greater access to US
 technology and investment capital as part of their
 effort to obtain from the outside world the equipment
 and capital that will enable them to further their
 modernization programs. They hope that the United
 States will provide broad access to its modern technol-
 ogy and to its capital markets to assist them to achieve
 this goal. We doubt, however, that they will recipro-
 cate for any such US concessions. China also looks to
 the United States to continue to provide specialized
 education to its future technicians and managers; there
 are currently over 10,000 Chinese students in the
 United States, almost all of whom are in the areas of
 science and technology.
 16. Access to US trade and capital markets is
 important to China both intrinsically and as a means
 of leverage to gain greater access to the technology and
 investment capital of other advanced countries. Since
 China is determined to avoid the appearance of close
 association with any single advanced country, includ-
 ing the United States, Beijing hopes to deal with all of
 the advanced countries of the West and also, to a
 limited degree, the USSR. China, moreover, sees that
 good relations with the United States will greatly ease
 access to the Japanese and the West Europeans.
 Finally, China also looks to the United States to lead
 the way in easing COCOM restrictions on technology
 exports.
 17. Beijing probably believes that the President, in
 this election year, would like to portray his trip to
 China as a clear success, thus giving them extra room
 to exploit it to their benefit, particularly by pressing
 for concessions in the economic and technology areas.
 One tactic they might pursue, for example, would be
 to delay substantive negotiations on unresolved current
 issues (for instance, the possibilities of nuclear, invest-
 ment, or tax treaties) until the President arrives,
 hoping for last-minute US concessions to obtain signa-
 tures on important agreements during the trip. Al-
 though there will certainly be an element of pressure
 in Chinese tactics, this pressure will be controlled by
 Beijing's current calculation that its interests are best
 served by good relations with the United States and
 that it will gain more over the longer term by restraint
 than by confrontation.
 18. In addition to possibly seeking final agreement
 on a number of treaties, the Chinese are likely to
 pursue expanded economic relations in other areas:
 - They will certainly press for greater relaxation
 of US controls on access to advanced technology,
 perhaps presenting a wish list. They are likely to
 cite statistics selectively on license applications
 and on allegedly low rates of approvals of items
 contained in various lists submitted to the Unit-
 ed States over the years.
 - They will also press for greater administration
 support for changes by Congress that would
 make China eligible for concessional loans from
 the United States.

 SECRET
 The Chinese leaders will devote some time
 during the visit to probing US thinking on
 Chinese membership in international financial

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP86B00420R000100290005-5
 institutions.  Depending  on  progress  already
 made in talks with officials of the Asian Devel-
 opment Bank and with its members, China may
 use the visit to press the United States to take a
 more active stand on Chinese membership in the
 Bank, and it will make clear its willingness to
 allow Taiwan to remain in the Bank in some
 form. The visit of Treasury Secretary Regan to
 China in March will provide a clearer picture of
 Chinese intentions in this area.
 19. China is also likely to raise trade issues. Having
 limited the import of US agricultural commodities in
 retaliation for US limitations on China's access to the
 US textile market, Beijing will press the President to
 ease these restrictions. It will hold out prospects for a
 revival of the growth in US exports to China, but will
 at least implicitly tie this to the need for the United
 States to curtail its restrictions on the entry of Chinese
 goods to the US market. It is possible that Beijing will
 raise the issue of its membership in GATT, and US
 willingness to support its membership.
 20. During the visit the Chinese may reaffirm their
 interest in US arms technology and military exchanges
 and press for a further relaxation of US controls, but
 we believe that the bulk of these talks will continue to
 take place between military experts on the two sides
 and with US manufacturers. They may press for a
 general Presidential affirmation of US willingness to
 consider the transfer of advanced military technology.
 Beijing may use the President's visit to announce dates
 for the visit to the United States of Defense Minister
 Zhang Aiping, a step that might give impetus to the
 transfer of military technology. China is also discussing
 arms purchases with a number of West European
 countries, and we believe that it hopes to diversify its
 sources of supply and to avoid becoming closely
 associated as an arms client with any Western country,
 including the United States.
 21. Reassurance on the Taiwan Issue. Taiwan
 will remain the single issue upon which the relation-
 ship could founder. It is the one issue on which the
 Chinese have required assurances from the United
 States since the relationship began in 1971, and it will
 continue as such for the foreseeable future. At the
 present time, the Chinese hope the United States will
 handle its relations with Taiwan in a way that allows
 Beijing to pursue broader objectives with the United
 States.
 22. Nonetheless, the President will be read a firm
 statement on Chinese policy toward Taiwan. The
 Chinese understand the limits of US tolerance for such
 lectures, but the great importance of this issue and its
 extreme political sensitivity in China will require a
 lengthy exposition of Chinese views, probably by Deng
 himself. Although the Chinese may reiterate general
 warnings concerning Taiwan, we believe that they will
 not make specific demands or lay down ultimatums.
 Substantively, Beijing will put its strongest emphasis
 on the need for palpable reductions in arms sales to
 Taiwan. They may revert to earlier efforts to draw the
 United States into prior consultations concerning the
 level of each year's sale of arms to Taipei.
 23. The Chinese have already protested the an-
 nounced level of US arms sales to Taiwan for fiscal
 year 1985. They may press the point more vigorously
 during the President's visit. The strength of Beijing's
 statements during the visit will be based on its judg-
 ment concerning US long-term intentions in this area,
 and the Chinese will seek reassurances from the
 President that there will be a decline over time in the    ~.
 levels and quality of US arms sales to Taipei.
 24. Given the recent growth of Chinese concern
 over possible support in the United States-especially
 in the Congress-for Taiwan independence, the Presi-
 dent is likely to be pressed by the Chinese leaders for
 reassurances that the United States adheres to a one-
 China policy, that it will not inject any role of
 officiality into its contacts with Taiwan, and that it
 will not encourage those supporting independence for
 Taiwan. Furthermore, they may specifically ask for an
 administration commitment to oppose any Congressio-
 nal actions in support of Taiwan independence. They
 may also strongly urge that US officials cease discuss-
 ing in public the subject of Taiwan.
 25. Overall, the Taiwan portion of the President's
 talks will be frank, but probably nonconfrontational,
 and will be aimed at -keeping the record clear with
 both the United States and the hardliners in Beijing.
 The latter need reassurance that Chinese interests have
 been safeguarded. The Chinese will also attempt to
 demonstrate that their policies for reunification with
 Taiwan are reasonable. They will probably repeat
 what Deng told a private American delegation in
 February: China envisages some form of "confedera-
 tion" with Taiwan that would constitute "one China

 with two systems." In essence, the Chinese have
 probably decided that they stand a better chance of
 favorably influencing US policies on Taiwan-particu-
 larly on the issue of arms sales-by demonstrating
 "reasonableness" on the question of reunification rath-
 er than by uttering threats. Consequently, as during
 Zhao's visit, the Chinese will probably back off from
 an initially hard line on Taiwan and tacitly acknowl-
 edge by the end of the visit that relations can continue
 to improve as long as the United States lives up to the
 three communiques dealing with Taiwan issued be-
 tween 1972 and 1982.
 26. Strategic Issues. The Chinese are likely to
 engage in strategic discussions with the President
 somewhat broader in scope than those undertaken
 during Zhao's visit. The Chinese leaders will probably
 use these talks to urge a greater US role in Kampuchea
 and Afghanistan. Beijing may be concerned that the
 MIA issue might induce the United States to ease its
 pressure on Hanoi on the Kampuchean issue, and thus
 the Chinese leaders may press for more active and
 visible US support for the anti-Vietnamese coalition in
 Kampuchea. The Chinese will reaffirm their interest
 in stability on the Korean Peninsula and support for
 the North Korean interest in tripartite talks. China,
 however, almost certainly will continue to resist being
 drawn into any talks, in the initial phase at least, and
 will continue to support the North Korean bargaining
 position that currently calls for confederation and
 opposes cross recognition.
 27. It is possible that the Chinese leaders will also
 advise the United States to take steps to reduce
 tensions with the USSR. For instance, the Chinese may
 cite the concrete advantage in an early INF agreement
 that would reduce or at least freeze SS-20 deployments
 in the East. Beijing's concern over the consequences of
 the growth of US military power was strikingly evi-
 dent in conversations that Deng and Zhao separately
 held in February 1984 with a private US delegation.
 Both leaders revealed concern over what the United
 States may do with the military strength it has ac-
 quired and seemed to hold the United States at least
 partially responsible for the aggravation of interna-
 tional tension in recent years. In the same conversa-
 tions, Deng stated his concern that a more active US
 policy will not be in China's interests and, in particu-
 lar, could lead the United States to look to Taiwan as
 an "unsinkable aircraft carrier," that is, as a strategic
 asset that the United States would be unwilling to
 abandon. Zhao, moreover, revealed extreme Chinese
 sensitivity to the implication of US dominance in the
 US-Chinese relationship and underscored Beijing's
 continuing need to be respected and to be perceived as
 an equal in relations with the United States. We
 believe that this is intended to signal Chinese concern
 that the United States will be held responsible by large
 parts of world opinion for any further worsening of
 the international atmosphere and that China would
 find it increasingly difficult to be seen cooperating
 with the United States under these circumstances.
 28. Zhao's willingness to discuss Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions during his visit to Washington in January 1984
 and  China's  announcement  of  these  discussions
 marked a striking departure from recent. Chinese
 practice. We believe that Beijing did this to signal
 displeasure with Moscow's continued buildup around
 China's periphery, Moscow's tactics in the bilateral
 talks, such as a failure to make basic concessions, and
 to pressure the Soviets to begin to meet Chinese
 demands in these talks. The extent to which China will "
 be willing to consult, and to be seen consulting, with us
 on strategic issues during the visit will be determined
 in part by the state of Sino-Soviet relations and
 particularly by the results of the fourth round of Sino-
 Soviet talks in March.
 29. We doubt that there will be anything approach-
 ing a breakthrough in Sino-Soviet relations prior to the
 President's visit, and thus the Chinese leaders will
 probably give the President a fairly extensive account
 of their differences with the USSR. Such a discourse
 will be intended in part to reassure the United States.
 At the same time, however, if Sino-Soviet relations are
 discussed, Beijing may again announce this fact pub-
 licly to prod the Soviets and to try to demonstrate that
 the Chinese enjoy a high degree of maneuverability
 within the strategic triangle. The Chinese may also see
 a renewed willingness to discuss Soviet affairs with the
 United States as an incentive for the United States to
 be more forthcoming on bilateral US-Chinese issues.
 Constraints on US-Chinese Cooperation
 30. Beijing clearly believes that Chinese interests
 are best served for the foreseeable future by produc-
 tive and stable relations with the United States, but
 there are also equally clear constraints on how far it is
 willing to permit those relations to develop. One such

 limit is its need to be perceived by the rest of the
 world as not under US (or Soviet) influence. Another is
 its very practical need to keep tensions with the Soviet
 Union at a manageable level.
 Domestic and International Public Opinion
 31. China will be highly conscious of the various
 audiences, including the Soviets, who will be observing
 how it handles the President's visit. Much of Beijing's
 conduct will be determined by this factor. This will
 place limits on the substance of the talks and will
 influence the public characterization of the President's
 visit. We believe that Deng and his colleagues are
 conscious of the need to demonstrate clearly and
 repeatedly to opposing domestic leadership elements
 the benefits that China derives from relations with the
 United States and that they want to be seen as
 vigilantly protecting Chinese interests on sensitive
 issues such as Taiwan. This, we believe, will continue
 to impose limits on the development of ties between
 China and the United States and often makes the
 achievement of almost any significant agreement a
 lengthy and arduous task.
 The Limits on Strategic Cooperation With the
 United States
 32. The Chinese, during Zhao's visit to Washington
 in January 1984, went further than they had in recent
 high-level visits to the United States to highlight areas
 of agreement with the United States. Nonetheless, they
 have kept up private and public criticisms of US
 policies in various areas of the world, and they
 continue to label the United States a "hegemonist"
 power. Thus there are sharp limits on the extent to
 which China will cooperate with the United States on
 strategic issues. This is more than merely a tactic to
 enable Beijing to show that it pursues an "independ-
 ent" foreign policy. It represents the balance that
 China is attempting to strike in its foreign policy as it
 moves somewhat closer to the United States but
 continues to pursue other goals that at times conflict
 with US policies.
 33. Underscoring these conflicts with some US poli-
 cies, Beijing has publicly stated that it will not estab-
 .ish a strategic partnership with the United States.
 China will keep its distance from the United States on
 selected world issues, will oppose some US policies
 intended to counter the USSR, and will not engage in
 such activities as joint planning. Nonetheless, China
 does tacitly cooperate with the United States on
 selected strategic issues of joint concern. It will contin-
 ue to do so while attempting to maintain wide options
 in dealing with the USSR and the Third World.
 Containing Tensions With the Soviets
 34. The Soviet threat has always been a key factor
 in Chinese calculations relating to the United States.
 Beijing opened its dialogue with the United States in
 the early 1970s to obtain a strategic counterweight to
 Soviet power, and this remains a basic consideration as
 Beijing formulates its policies toward the United
 States. China is equally conscious, however, of the
 need not to overly alarm the Soviets about the possibil-
 ity of a US-Chinese alliance directed against the USSR.
 This has led to a carefully balanced approach in which
 China seeks to hold Moscow at bay by strengthening
 ties with the United States, but not to the point that
 Moscow would be unwilling to pursue some relaxation
 of tensions with Beijing.
 35. Thus, a major Chinese objective in recent years
 has been to maintain a distance-but not equidis-
 tance-from each of the superpowers and to conduct
 relations with each that are neither "hot nor cold."
 Beijing's desire to maintain at least a degree of
 evenhandedness in its contacts with the United States
 and the USSR was demonstrated most recently by the
 attendance of Vice Premier Wan Li at Andropov's
 funeral, Chinese participation in the fourth round of
 talks with the Soviets in Moscow in March, and the
 Chinese invitation to First Deputy Premier Arkhipov
 to visit China in May.
 36. China will use its contacts with the United
 States-especially the President's visit-to attempt to
 underscore the commonality of US-Chinese security
 concerns regarding the Soviet involvement in Afghani-
 stan and Southeast Asia. Beijing may also hope to
 increase pressure on Moscow to make concessions on
 issues of major security concern to China but does not
 appear optimistic of a breakthrough. At the same time
 China will also continue to take steps to ease tensions
 with Moscow, believing that an expanded dialogue
 with the USSR enables it to demonstrate that China
 pursues an independent foreign policy.
