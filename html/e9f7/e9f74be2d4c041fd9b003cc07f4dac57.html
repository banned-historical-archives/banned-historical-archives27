 China: The Steel Industry
 In the 1970s and 1980s
 Key Judgments               The People's Republic of China has launched a massive effort to boost steel
 production rapidly to help raise the country to a first-rate industrial power
 by the end of the century. Last year the Chinese leadership called for a
 doubling of steel output to 60 million metric tons by 1985 and started a
 major construction program to provide the needed capacity at all stages of
 production. Recently, however, the PRC has begun to doubt the feasibility
 of the program and has begun to cut back its original goals.
 Broad Scope of the Program
 In February 1978 Premier Hua Guofeng announced that China planned to
 build or expand 10 major steel centers under the current l0-year economic
 plan (1976-85). The program called for constructing two or three new
 complexes and upgrading seven existing steel centers. The Chinese have
 already started work on a new 6-million-ton plant at Baoshan (Pao-shan)
 near Shanghai and are negotiating with West Germany and Japan for a
 proposed 10-million-ton plant to be located east of Beijing in Hebei (Hopeh)
 Province. In addition, the Chinese have entered into preliminary discussions
 with a number of Western firms for help to modernize several existing steel
 mills. Most of the new plant and technology must come from the West
 because the Chinese lack the know-how to build large-scale, integrated
 plants.
 Chinese plans also call for simultaneous improvements in the long-neglected
 iron ore sector. Although iron ore reserves are huge, most deposits are of low
 quality and require extensive upgrading before they are suitable for
 ironmaking. China has reached preliminary agreements with three US firms
 for development of four iron mines and pelletizing facilities. As many as 14
 mines could ultimately be developed under the current plan. Some of the
 mines could eventually rank among the largest in the world.
 High Cost
 Modernization of the steel industry will be expensive. The Baoshan complex
 will probably cost $3-4 billion, and the plant proposed for Hebei Province
 could run as high as $14 billion. Upgrading existing plants could cost more
 than $10 billion in hard currency, depending on how much of the work is
 done by the Chinese themselves. In addition, iron ore mines and
 beneficiation facilities could add another $5-10 billion to the total. Hard
 currency spending could thus reach $40 billion by the time the current plans
 are finally achieved.

 Approved For Release1001/03/06 : CIA-RDP86B00985F?00300040017-8
 Overambitious Goals
 The Chinese are beginning to realize that China lacks the human and
 material resources and the infrastructure to carry out the program by 1985.
 Construction personnel and the material inputs needed to erect imported
 facilities are in short supply, as are skilled managers and technicians with
 the know-how to operate modern iron and steel plants. Moreover, the
 enormous scope of the plan would require huge investment resources badly
 needed in light industry and agriculture. In the longer run, all of these
 problems may be overcome, but meanwhile the Chinese leaders have been
 cutting back the 1985 steel target, perhaps settling on a more feasible 45
 million tons. Achievement of this target would still ensure that the PRC
 retained its position as the world's fifth largest steel producer-behind the
 USSR, the United States, Japan, and West Germany.
 Sizable Imports
 The poor production record of the 1970s-largely attributable to the
 political turmoil centering around the succession struggle of 1974-76-
 forced Beijing to expand iron and steel imports sharply in recent years; steel
 is now the largest single category in China's import bill. Steel imports
 reached almost $1.5 billion in 1977, nearly four times the figure for 1970.
 Finished steel items-primarily plate, sheet, tube, and pipe-account for
 about 90 percent of Chinese purchases and probably reached 7 million tons
 last year. Japan is the largest supplier, accounting for more than 70 percent
 of China's imports.
 China will need to import steel products well into the 1980s. Although
 domestic output of crude and finished steel no doubt will rise substantially
 above the 32 million tons produced last year, output will be insufficient to
 supply the quantity, quality, or variety of products required for the stepped-
 up modernization program. Purchases abroad will continue to be dominated
 by finished steel products; at the same time, growing amounts of iron ore will
 be bought until domestic ore mining and ore-preparation facilities are
 greatly expanded.

 China: The Steel Industry
 In the 1970s and 1980s
 Soviet Influence
 Since it came to power in 1949 the leadership of the
 People's Republic of China has viewed the develop-
 ment of a strong steel industry as a high national
 priority. With extensive Soviet aid, the Chinese began
 to rebuild war-ravaged steel plants immediately after
 the Communist takeover. The Soviet Union provided
 advisers, technology, and equipment for this task.
 Initial projects included reconstruction of the steel
 mills at Anshan (An-shan), Benxi (Pen-chi), Taiyuan
 (T'ai-yuan), and Maanshan (Ma-an-shan). In addi-
 tion, new plants were started at Wuhan and Baotou
 (Pao-t'ou) (see map, figure 1).
 Steel output expanded smoothly during the early
 1950s. Production surpassed the pre-Communist high
 of 900,000 tons by 1952 and reached 5.35 million tons
 in 1957, the final year of the Soviet-style First Five-
 Year Plan. In addition to the large increases in
 production, Chinese mills turned out a growing variety
 of products and raised productivity as more efficient
 equipment was installed. Under Soviet tutelage, more
 and more Chinese became experienced in operating
 and managing steel facilities.
 The Great Leap Forward
 Despite steady progress in steel and other branches of
 industry, Chairman Mao felt that growth could be
 even more rapid, and in 1958 he launched the Great
 Leap Forward, an ill-advised attempt at instant
 industrialization. Small iron and steel plants sprang up
 all over the country. These plants featured the
 notorious backyard furnaces and small, obsolete side-
 blown converters for making steel. Output from these
 primitive facilities gave rise to exaggerated claims of
 huge increases in steel production. The Chinese
 claimed, for example, that steel production more than
 doubled in 1958 and jumped another 70 percent by
 1960.
 Simultaneously, the Chinese proceeded with the con-
 struction of modern plants. Installation of equipment
 was speeded up, and capacity at the large plants
 reached about 12 million tons by the end of 1960. The
 Chinese reported that output from the large plants
 exceeded their rated capacity, reaching almost 13
 million tons in 1960. These plants were operated
 around the clock with little attention to maintenance or
 repair. The new small-scale plants added another
 6 million tons of steel production. The steel from small
 plants was nearly useless, however, and the low quality
 of ores and pig iron used at the modern plants reduced
 the quality of their output as well.
 Retrenchment
 Following the Great Leap Forward, China closed
 almost all of the small facilities and began to repair the
 damage done to the large steel mills. Production fell
 from a claimed 19 million tons in 1960 to an estimated
 8 million tons in 1961 and stayed at that level through
 1963.
 During the period of comparatively moderate policy
 (1961-65), China began to look to the West for modern
 steelmaking technology. After Krushchev pulled out
 the Soviet advisers and their blueprints in mid-1960,
 China was unable to push forward its steelmaking
 technology on its own. Accordingly, it bought basic
 oxygen furnaces from Austria and electric furnaces
 and air separation plants from Japan. Steelmaking
 capacity reached almost 18 million tons by yearend
 1965 and production advanced to 15 million tons in
 1966 (see figure 2). The new plants at Wuhan and
 Baotou contributed growing amounts of steel and steel
 products, and selective improvements boosted produc-
 tion at existing plants. Although production still
 lagged behind the spurious claim of 1960, quality was
 vastly improved and a wider variety of finished
 products was produced.
 The Cultural Revolution
 The Cultural Revolution (1966-69) caused another
 downturn in the steel industry. In 1966, when the Red
 Guards were being mobilized, production climbed to
 15 million tons, then plummeted to 10 million tons in
 1967 and dropped further to only 9 million tons in

 Steel Production
 Capacity
 1968. Factional fighting and political demonstrations
 disrupted many steel plants, and the vast numbers of
 Red Guards traveling around the country over-
 whelmed the transportation system. Political dis-
 turbances also hurt the coal industry, and shortages of
 coking coal further impeded steel production. Com-
 pared with the Great Leap Forward, however, these
 problems were minor and temporary. Despite sporadic
 interruptions in supplies of construction materials, the
 Chinese maintained a vigorous investment program in
 steel and other industrial branches during the Cultural
 Revolution; steel capacity stood at about 24 million
 tons in 1970.'
 After the interruptions of the Cultural Revolution,
 steel production advanced rapidly, doubling between
 1968 and 1970 (see table 1). The PRC had utilized

 1960s see "China's Iron and Steel Industry," China: .4

 only about 40 percent of its steelmaking capacity in
 1968; almost 13 million tons of operable capacity was
 standing idle. The return of political stability enabled
 managers to quickly activate a large part of these
 facilities. In 1973, steel production reached a record 25
 million tons. In addition, China reintroduced small
 steel plants during this period. These plants, which
 were much improved over the earlier facilities, used
 nearby materials and labor to produce iron and steel
 for local consumption. Construction of small plants
 helped boost the 1975 capacity level to about 30
 million tons.
 Gang of Four Disruptions
 In 1974-76, political disturbances associated with the
 Gang of Four faction and the struggle over the
 succession to Chairman Mao sharply depressed steel
 output. Production in both 1974 and 1976 amounted to
 only 21 million tons, whereas in 1975, a comparatively
 orderly year, production was at 24 million tons.
 Massive in-plant disruptions, factional fighting, and
 political rallies were common, particularly at the large

 plants at Wuhan and Anshan. The Chinese reported,
 for example, "In the three years of 1974-76 the Gang
 of Four faction caused the Wuhan Iron and Steel
 Company to lose one and one-half years' output." The
 steel industry was further affected in July 1976 by the
 major earthquake that hit Tangshan. The Tangshan
 steel plant--a I-million-ton producer-was heavily
 damaged, with the Kailuan (K'ailuan) coal mine at
 Tangshan also hard hit. Loss of output from the
 Kailuan mine, a leading producer of high quality
 coking coal, forced sharp cutbacks in operations at
 Anshan and mills in the Beijing area.
 Return of Stability
 The recovery after the downfall of the Gang of' Four
 (October 1976) has been swift. China's new leadership
 has strongly emphasized the need to increase produc-
 tion, and, with the return of political stability, the steel
 industry has rebounded. In 1978, steel output reached
 almost 32 million tons, finally surpassing the 1973
 peak.
 The situation confronting the Chinese steel industry
 after the fall of the Gang of Four was similar to the
 situation in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion-China's ability to increase steel production by
 more than I I million tons between 1976 and 1978
 again rested on the existence of large amounts of

 was under 70 percent, with almost 10 million tons of

 moreover, 3-4 million tons of new capacity came on
 line with the completion of a 1.5-million-ton blast
 furnace at Anshan and the activation of new
 steelmaking facilities at Wuhan and Benxi. These
 additions boosted total capacity to about 34 million
 tons in 1978.
 The spurt in production in 1978 lifted China to fifth in
 world output-behind the Soviet Union, the United
 States, Japan, and West Germany. China's high
 standing in aggregate steel production contrasts with
 its low ranking in per capita production--31.6 kilo-
 grams per capita in 1978. Brazil, for example, has a per
 capita output over three times that of China. Com-
 pared with developed countries, China's per capita
 output is only about 5 percent of US per capita output
 and 4 percent of Japan's (see table 2). On the other
 hand, China produces more than twice as much steel
 per head as India.
 Iron and Steel Plants
 China's 34 million tons of capacity is divided among
 approximately 300 plants that produce iron, steel, or
 iron and steel. The most famous is the integrated
 facility at Anshan, which produced more than half of
 China's steel in 1957 and still produces more than one-
 fifth. This plant, together with the other eight or nine
 facilities capable of producing I million tons or more
 per year, account for 80 to 90 percent of total pro-
 duction. Other large plants are located at Shanghai,
 Wuhan, Baotou, Beijing, Chongqing (Chungking),
 Maanshan, Taiyuan and Benxi. In addition the Chi-
 nese recently announced the existence of a new
 facility Banzhihua (Panchihhua) in southern
 Sichuan (Szechwan) Province--that qualifies as a
 large plant. (u)
 With the exception of the Shanghai plant, all of
 China's major steel mills are located near domestic
 supplies of coal and iron ore. The Shanghai mill, the
 only plant with a coastal location, produces small
 amounts of pig iron. It is primarily designed to make
 and finish steel from pig iron produced at other
 locations. Consequently, ready access to iron ore is
 unnecessary. The Banzhihua plant's remote location
 was chosen as part of China's policy of dispersing
 industry for defensive purposes.
 The vast majority of the medium and small plants
 operate near the bottom of the technological scale and
 in the main provide low-quality iron for local consump-
 tion. The typical small plant probably produces less
 than 5,000 tons of steel yearly. Some of the medium-
 sized plants, however, make an important contribution
 to the industry's output. The Fulaerji (Fu-la-erh-chi)
 plant is a leading producer of high-quality alloy steel,
 and the plant at Tangshan, reconstructed after the
 1976 earthquake, produces almost I million tons of
 steel annually. Other important medium-sized facili-
 ties are found at Dayc (Ta-ye), Guangzhou (Canton),
 .Iiangyou (Chiang-yu), Luda (Dairen), Xiangtan
 (I Isiang-tan), Xuanhua (Hsuan-hua), Kunming
 (K'un-ming), Shenyang (Shen-yang), and Tianjin
 (Tientsin).
 The erratic growth of China's steel industry has made
 the task of carrying out a coherent development
 strategy extremely difficult. Planners have had to
 contend with recurrent political upheavals, charging
 economic priorities, and interruptions to the inflow of
 foreign technology. Consequently, the industry has
 been characterized by pronounced imbalances--many
 of which persist to this day. Output of pig iron lags
 behind the needs of the steel furnaces, and blast
 furnace requirements for iron ore are not being met.
 Similarly, China's steelfinishing sector is unable to
 process the outflow of crude steel.
 Steelmaking
 The production of crude steel is the strongest stage of
 China's steel industry. In the 1950s the USSR
 provided the equipment and technical support to
 construct numerous large, modern open-hearth fur-
 naces (OHFs). Productivity at these furnaces has been
 improved through the use of oxygen injection, and
 today the open hearths account for 60 to 70 percent of
 capacity. Basic oxygen furnaces (BOFs), which domi-
 nate steelmaking in most advanced countries, account
 for only 15 to 25 percent of Chinese capacity. The
 USSR had only begun to provide basic oxygen
 technology when it withdrew its technicians in 1960,
 and China has been slow to introduce this technology
 on its own. Today, most new Chinese steel furnaces are
 BOFs. Electric furnaces represent 5 to 10 percent of
 capacity and produce high-quality and specialty steels,
 while the outmoded side-blown converter is the stand-
 ard furnace at local steel mills.
 Ironmaking
 China, a net exporter of pig iron in the 1950s and
 1960s, has had to import growing quantities in recent
 years. Growth of pig iron production in the 1970s has
 not matched China's capacity to make steel and cast
 iron products. The Chinese have recognized this
 deficiency; a new 1.5-million-ton blast furnace was
 completed at Anshan in 1977, and a new 800,000-ton
 furnace was recently completed at Maanshan. Other
 new blast furnaces are reportedly under construction.
 The Soviet Union provided China with a large number
 of blast furnaces in the 1950s. After the Soviet
 withdrawal the PRC continued to construct its blast
 furnaces according to Soviet designs. These furnaces
 are generally well constructed, and the addition of
 modern instrumentation has improved operating
 efficiencies.
 The greatest problem confronting China's blast fur-
 nace operators is the poor quality of the metallic blast
 furnace burden. China is almost completely dependent
 on sintering of low-quality ore for blast furnace feed.
 Most Chinese ores, however, are poorly suited to this
 type of beneficiation. Foreign technicians who have
 visited Chinese steel plants have estimated that the
 PRC could increase its pig iron output 20 to 30 percent
 by adopting more appropriate beneficiation and ag-
 glomeration practices.
 Strains on iron supplies also are increased by limita-
 tions on the supply of scrap in China. The PRC, with
 its short history of industrialization, has not had much
 time to build up backlogs of aged and discarded metal
 goods. In addition, shortages of both consumer and
 capital equipment leads to long extensions of service
 life. This general scrap shortage forces the Chinese to
 use a high proportion of hot metal in the steel furnace
 charge.
 Steelfinishing
 Steelfinishing has been the weakest sector of the
 industry since the 1950s. Although the Soviets pro-
 vided some finishing mills under their aid program,
 finishing capacity failed to grow as rapidly as iron or
 steelmaking capacity. At the Wuhan plant, for exam-
 ple, the Soviets withdrew before planned finishing
 facilities were constructed. The Chinese have been
 able to produce only a small variety of finishing
 equipment on their own. In 1978, finished steel
 production amounted to about 21 million tons, only
 two-thirds of crude steel output.
 China's steelfinishing capacity consists primarily of
 large blooming and structural mills and a considerable
 number of rod and bar, plate, sheet, and welded and
 seamless tube mills. The PRC has few wide sheet or
 strip mills, or tinning or galvanizing lines. Little cold
 rolling capacity exists as most mills are designed for
 only hot rolling.
 Recognizing their need for additional steelfinishing
 capacity, the Chinese in 1973-74 contracted with
 Japan and West Germany for a $500 million complex
 to be installed at the Wuhan steel mill. This facility
 features a 3-million-ton, 1,700-millimeter hot strip
 mill, a continuous slab caster, an electrical sheet plant,
 a cold rolling mill, and galvanizing and tin-plating
 lines. The Chinese recently announced that the instal-
 lation of most of the equipment was complete, and the
 mill should go on line sometime this year, about three
 years behind schedule.
 China's imports of iron and steel have grown steadily
 during the 1970s. The domestic steel industry has been
 unable to supply either the quantity or the variety of
 output required by the construction and machine-
 building industries, which together account for 85
 percent of Chinese steel consumption. The slow growth
 of output, coupled with the shortcomings of the
 steelfinishing sector, has forced the PRC to turn to
 foreign sources of supply. Imports, which totaled less
 than $400 million in 1970, amounted to $1.5 billion in
 1977. During this period Beijing spent more than $7.7
 billion on purchases of foreign iron and steel, making it
 the largest single category in China's import bill.
 Imports of iron and steel are dominated by finished
 steel items (see table 3). These products account for
 about 90 percent of total purchases. China imports
 large amounts of steel plate and sheet, strip, tube and
 pipe, and alloy steel. Expansion of the petroleum
 industry requires more and better quality pipe than
 China's antiquated pipe mills can produce, and thin
 sheet and strip and cold rolled items are not produced
 in sufficient quantities for motor vehicles and other
 machine-building applications. Until domestic
 finishing capabilities are improved, imports of these
 items will continue to grow. Finished steel imports
 exceeded 4.4 million tons in 1977 and probably
 reached 7 million tons or more in 1978. In addition,
 China imports small quantities of crude and
 semifinished steel. About 250,000 tons valued at $44
 million were purchased in 1977.
 China's efforts to utilize more fully its blast furnace
 and steelmaking capacity have led to increased imports
 of iron ore and pig iron. As noted earlier, China
 produces insufficient amounts of both items to keep its
 iron and steelmaking facilities fully employed. Iron ore
 purchases totaled 2.4 million tons in 1977, almost five

 times that purchased in 1970. Imports in 1978
 probably reached 6 million tons. Imports of pig iron
 peaked in 1977 at 847,000 tons, worth $70 million. In
 comparison, pig iron purchases in 1970 were only
 26,000 tons. Scrap imports have fallen steadily since
 they reached almost 600,000 tons in 1973. Imports in
 1977 were less than 20,000 tons.
 Japan is by far the largest supplier of iron and steel to
 China (see figure 3). With 1977 sales of more than
 $1 billion, Japan accounted for 70 percent of China's
 total iron and steel imports. Japanese sales are
 concentrated in finished steel products, particularly
 steel plate and sheet. West Germany is China's second
 leading source. German iron and steel exports to the
 PRC amounted to $218 million in 1977, almost three-
 fourths of which consisted of steel tube and pipe.
 Australia, China's leading source of iron ore, is the
 third largest overall supplier of iron and steel. Austra-
 lia also sells considerable quantities of pig iron.
 Despite growing purchases of iron and steel, China's
 total steel supply-production plus imports-has
 grown slowly during the 1970s. Between 1970 and
 1978 supply grew almost 8 percent annually, but
 between 1970 and 1977 the rate was only a little over
 5 percent. Not until 1978 did total supply surpass the
 previous peak reached in 1973 (see table 4). The slow
 growth of supply indicates that Beijing must maintain
 steel imports at a high level if it is to carry through its
 sweeping modernization program. During the 1970s
 imports have accounted for about 15 percent of total
 steel supply, and more than 20 percent of finished steel
 supply. Domestic output will be insufficient to provide
 the required amounts of steel well into the 1980s; thus,
 the PRC will be forced to continue large-scale steel
 imports-at a considerable cost in scarce foreign
 exchange or amassed debt.
 China's program to modernize its steel industry is
 intended to redress longstanding bottlenecks and to
 double existing capacity and output by 1985. The
 industry today is plagued by imbalances between
 sectors and dated technology. The weak links-
 principally mining and processing of iron ore and

 finishing capabilities-need improvement, and exist-
 ing plants require infusions of modern technology to
 boost productivity. Fuller use of existing capacity is not
 a promising solution, since the steel industry has
 recently been operating at more than 90 percent of
 capacity. Perhaps another several million tons of
 output could be squeezed out of existing plants, but any
 large increase in production must await new capacity
 coming on stream. Only by introducing modern
 technology and constructing new plants can China
 hope to restore internal balance to the industry and
 increase output sufficiently to meet the rapidly grow-
 ing demand for steel.
 Planned Facilities
 The 10 steel centers China plans to construct by 1985
 consist of two or three totally new facilities and
 expansion of seven or eight existing plants. New
 facilities are planned for Shanghai and eastern Hopeh
 Province. Existing plants reportedly slated for expan-
 sion and upgrading include Anshan, Benxi, Capital,
 Baotou, Taiyuan, Wuhan, Maanshan, and possibly
 Chongqing.

 Preliminary.
 A preliminary contract for the initial project, the
 Baoshan steel plant near Shanghai, was signed with
 Japan's Nippon Steel Corporation in April 1978. This
 plant has a designed capacity of 6 million tons; half to
 be operational by January 1981. The remainder is
 scheduled to come on line two years later. Ground-
 breaking ceremonies took place in mid-December, and
 pilings are currently being placed. The plant's coastal
 site has a soft geological structure, and pilings for the
 blast furnaces and heavy equipment in the rolling mill
 will extend to a depth of 70 meters. Altogether, about
 300,000 tons of steel pilings will be required for the
 plant.
 Baoshan's coastal location was chosen despite its poor
 geology to facilitate transportation of imported iron
 ore. When fully operational, the plant will probably use
 more than 10 million tons of foreign iron ore yearly,
 most of which will likely come from Australia and
 Brazil. Inland shipment of the ore would place
 additional strains on China's already overburdened
 transport system. Moreover, the plant will be able to
 provide the heavily industrialized Shanghai area with
 an expanded supply of high-quality steel. The Chinese
 anticipate this will help boost industrial production in
 the area.
 The Baoshan plant will incorporate the latest
 steelmaking technology. The facility is to be modeled
 on Nippon's Kimitsu plant, one of the most modern in
 the world.
 Sumitomo Metal Industries will construct a 400,000-
 ton seamless pipe mill as part of the Baoshan complex.
 Sumitomo had previously refused to sell its superior
 plant design and layout, but apparently hopes this will
 help win additional contracts for plants to be built
 later. This mill, which produces primarily oil drilling
 pipe, is scheduled to be completed in 1981.
 Negotiations on price and payments terms for the
 Baoshan project are not yet complete, but most cost
 estimates fall between $3 billion and $4 billion. This
 total includes funds for related facilities such as power
 plants, port improvement, and site preparation. The
 Baoshan plant alone will cost roughly as much as all of
 China's industrial plant imports in 1972-77.
 Preliminary discussions have been held with Japanese
 and West German firms for the construction of a 10-
 million-ton plant near Qinhuangdao (Chin-huang-tao)
 or Jidong (Chi-Yung) in the Be Hai (Po Hai) Bay area
 of Hebei Province. This could be one of the world's
 largest steel mills. The plant will be located in an
 earthquake-prone area near Tangshan. Large reserves
 of iron ore are available, however, and the Kailuan coal
 mines are nearby. The facility will also have access to
 several ports and will be able to serve the Tianjin
 industrial center.
 A West German consortium led by Scholemann-
 Siemag AG has been actively pursuing this contract.
 The companies have proposed a two-stage construction
 program that would see completion of the first stage,
 with a capacity of 6 million tons, in 1985. The Chinese
 have indicated a preference for a German plant, noting
 that while Japanese mills use high-quality imported
 iron ore and coking coal, German plants are designed
 to use raw materials of a quality similar to that
 available in China. Dresdner Bank has proposed a 10-
 year, 28-billion-mark credit to finance the package. If
 the bid is successful, the size of the order would be a
 record for German companies and would be accompa-
 nied by one of the largest credits ever granted. In early
 1979, however, Chinese leaders began to harbor
 serious doubts about pushing ahead with this project in
 the short run.
 Talks have also been held with several Japanese and
 British steel firms for the construction of the Hebei
 facility. China has asked Nippon Steel to submit a
 proposal for the Hebei plant. Nippon is reluctant to
 commit itself to the project and has suggested that
 other firms might be in a better position to assume
 responsibility for the undertaking.
 The enlargement and modernization of existing plants
 will be accompanied by a combination of Chinese and
 foreign efforts. China has the capability to produce a
 wide variety of basic steelmaking equipment and will
 likely supply some of the more simple items. Foreign
 participation will probably center around large-scale
 capacity additions and the provision of technically
 advanced pieces of steelmaking equipment. In addi-
 tion, foreign firms will undoubtedly supply a variety of
 engineering and technological services.
 The modernization and rounding out of existing plants
 offers many benefits to China. Internal balance can be
 achieved, and obsolete production processes can be
 scrapped. In some cases, new equipment is vital if other
 segments of a plant are to perform up to design. At
 Wuhan, for example, the new continuous caster
 requires more frequent supplies of hot metal than
 open-hearth furnaces can supply and the new BOFs
 China added in 1977 are very small. This plant is thus
 a logical site for a large BOF. Indeed, the Chinese have
 expressed interest in Q-BOP, or bottom-blown oxygen
 furnace developed by a US firm. Moreover, expansion
 of existing facilities is generally less expensive than
 building new greenfield plants. Brand new capacity
 costs about $1,000 per ton, while brownfield costs
 average about $500 per ton.
 The order in which China plans to upgrade existing
 facilities is unknown. China has, however, made
 inquiries with a number of firms in Japan, Western
 Europe, and the United States about enlarging and
 modernizing selected installations (sec table 5).

 z Excluding Maanshan.
 Implementation of these plans will yield a minimum of
 24 million tons of new capacity. This new capacity,
 when combined with the Hebei and Baoshan installa-
 tions, could increase China's steelmaking capacity by
 40 million tons, boosting the overall figure to more
 than 70 million tons. A capacity utilization rate of 85
 percent would enable China to reach its target of 60
 million tons of output.
 China has also begun to award contracts for improve-
 ments at some of its smaller steel mills. Daido Steel
 Company of Japan recently announced that it has
 agreed to provide technical assistance for the modern-
 ization of four medium-sized steel plants at Fushun
 (Fu-shun), Luda, Dayc, and Tiajin. The eventual cost
 of these projects will probably be approximately $300
 million to $500 million.
 Iron Ore Development
 China has abundant supplies of the natural resources
 necessary to become a major steel producer. Iron ore,
 coal, and limestone deposits are widespread and
 plentiful. In addition, China has large reserves of
 alloying materials such as manganese, molybdenum,
 tungsten, and vanadium. The most serious shortages
 are in certain alloying materials, particularly cobalt
 and chromium; China needs to import nearly its entire
 supply of these two metals.
 Reserves of iron ore are huge. Published estimates
 range from a pre-1949 figure of 2 billion tons to the
 Chinese claim of 100 billion tons made during the
 Great Leap Forward. Total reserves probably ap-
 proach the latter figure. In any event, reserves are
 more than sufficient for foreseeable requirements.
 Much of China's iron ore is low quality. Although
 scattered deposits of high-quality ore exist, the bulk is
 probably around 30-percent iron content. Ores of this
 grade require extensive bencficiation before being fed
 into ironmaking furnaces. Despite foreign advice,
 China so far has been slow to invest in adequate
 bencficiation facilities.
 With the exception of the Baoshan plant, all of China's
 new or expanded steel centers will be located near
 supplies of iron ore. China plans to develop its iron ore
 resources quickly so these plants will be able to use
 domestic ore for their growing production. Although
 Baoshan initially will be supplied with imported ore,
 the Chinese hope to phase out imports for this plant
 sometime during the 1980s. Despite China's huge iron
 ore reserves, an enormous development effort will be
 required to attain self-sufficiency. China was unable to
 produce the approximately 60 million tons of standard
 ore (55-percent iron content) needed for steel produc-
 tion in 1978. By 1985, if the steel goal is reached,
 standard ore requirements will reach about 120 million
 tons, more than double current production. In addition,
 as the PRC is forced to move to poorer deposits, actual
 tonnages mined will have to exceed standard ore
 requirements by growing margins.
 The Chinese program to increase iron ore output
 features the development or expansion of approxi-
 mately 14 major mines. Most of these are located in
 North, Northeast, and Central China, each having a
 potential for 15-60 million tons of ore annually. The
 ores at these mines contain only about 30-percent iron,
 so extensive beneficiation will be necessary. The
 Chinese apparently plan a widespread introduction of
 pelletizing plants to upgrade the ore. Currently,
 modern pelletizing technology is practically non-
 existent in China.
 The Chinese plan to acquire Western equipment and
 technology to develop their iron mines and to build
 pelletizing plants. Three US firms have already
 received preliminary contracts to develop four mines.
 Additional proposals are being discussed and more
 contracts are expected.
 Two of the mines for which preliminary contracts have
 been awarded will supply iron ore to the new steel mill
 WJianshan
 (precise location
 unknown)
 to be built in Hebei Province. These are the Shuichang
 (Shuich'ang) and Sijiaying (Szechiaying) mines. Each
 will produce about 10 million tons of pellets yearly.
 Development of the two mines will probably cost
 nearly $2 billion. Besides the new Hebei plant, these
 mines could also supply the Capital and other plants in
 the Beijing area and may eventually ship pellets to the
 new plant at Baoshan.
 Expansion of the Jidashan (Chi-da-shan) mine will
 supply some of the ore needed to support the proposed
 doubling of steel production at Anshan. Production
 from this mine is set at 17 million tons of pellets. About
 45-50 million tons of ore will be required for this level
 of production. The total cost of this complex could
 exceed $1 billion. The other mine that will be initially
 developed is the Nanfen (Nan-fen) mine near the
 Benxi steelworks. Production may eventually reach 60
 million tons of ore that will be converted into approxi-
 mately 20 million tons of pellets. This project could
 cost $500 million to $1 billion.
 Little precise information is available on the other
 mines the Chinese plan to develop by 1985. The
 Chinese are studying a number of other properties,
 however, and at least some of the following mines will
 be expanded to help meet China's growing iron ore
 needs: Dong Anshan (Tung Anshan), Xi Anshan (Hsi
 Anshan), and Dagushan (Ta Kushan) near the An-
 shan Iron and Steel Company; the Paiyun (Pai-yun)
 mine near the Baotou steel mill; the Egon (01ou)
 mine near the Taiyuan steelworks; Daye at the Wuhan
 mill; and the Jianshan (Chien-shan) and Yanbei (Yen-

 Cost of Steel Expansion Program
 The costs of China's proposed steel expansion program
 are enormous. Potential plant and technology imports
 at the 10 steel centers easily surpass $20 billion (see
 figure 5), Several billion more could be spent on
 smaller steel facilities. In addition, mine development
 and beneficiation facilities could add another $5- 10
 billion to the total. Thus, the potential hard-currency
 spending on the entire steel industry modernization
 plan could reach $40 billion.
 China will undoubtedly be forced to defer its ambitious
 goal of doubling steel output by 1985. Perhaps the
 most overwhelming task in achieving the goal is the
 sheer size of the planned construction program. Since
 1957 the Chinese have been able to add, on average,
 about 1.3 million tons of new steelmaking capacity
 yearly. The goal of 60 million tons of steel by 1985
 requires the addition of 4 million tons of capacity

 annually for the next seven years. This is an unrealistic
 target that would be difficult to reach under the best of
 circumstances.
 The supply of skilled construction workers is limited;
 huge quantities of heavy construction equipment
 would have to be imported to support the program; and
 the massive construction effort would also require
 more inputs of cement and other materials than China
 can supply. (The Chinese already are experiencing
 shortages of cement and will become a net importer in
 1979 for the first time since the early 1950s. At least 2
 million tons will be purchased from Japan this year at a
 cost of $120 million.)
 The decade of upheaval in China's educational system
 (1966-76) has left a serious gap in the ranks of
 scientists and engineers, which directly affects the steel
 program and simultaneously makes it more difficult to
 pry professional manpower away from other uses.
 Beijing is attempting to overcome this deficiency by
 restoring standards in domestic education and by
 sending students abroad; results will be slow in coming.
 Another problem facing the Chinese is the weak
 infrastructure associated with building and operating
 large steel complexes. Transport facilities and electric
 power systems are backward and barely able to cope
 with the needs of an industrial sector growing at an
 average 9 percent a year. As a case in point, the newly
 opened section of the Wuhan steel mill can only
 operate four hours per day because of a chronic
 shortage of electric power.
 As evidence that Chinese officials realize their goals
 for the steel industry are unattainable by 1985, Vice
 Premier Li Xiannian stated in a March 1979 interview
 with a Japanese newsman, "The Chinese economic
 construction plan has some overambitious aspects. We
 are now thinking about whether major targets, includ-
 ing iron and steel output, should be revised." In
 addition, Vice Premier Kang Shien indicated in April
 that the Hebei Province plant and expansion at
 Anshan would almost certainly be delayed.
 Besides their technical inability to reach the steel
 target, Chinese officials probably are backing away
 from the 60-million-ton goal because of the tremen-
 dous cost of the program. The Chinese have been
 shocked when presented with cost estimates for various
 projects. They have started to realize that such high
 levels of spending would siphon funds from investment
 in agriculture and light industry and could lead to
 unbalanced development and tie up investment re-
 sources in projects that would not generate returns for
 many years, In contrast, investment in light industry
 has a much quicker payoff time.
 Given the technical and financial problems described
 above, we think Beijing will slash its steel target to
 perhaps 45 million tons. China should be able to reach
 this level of output with the completion of the Baoshan
 plant and selected additions to existing mills. The goal
 of 60 million tons will probably be stretched out to
 1990 or beyond. In the longer run, the future of
 China's steel industry is bright. With its abundant raw
 materials and the infusion of Western technology,
 China should eventually be able to develop a steel
 industry comparable in size to the steel industries of
 the United States, the USSR, and Japan.
