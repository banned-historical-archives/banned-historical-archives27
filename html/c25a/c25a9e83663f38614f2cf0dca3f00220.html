 COMMUNIST CHINA'S ROLE IN NON-COMMUNIST ASIA 1
 THE PROBLEM
 To examine Communist China's activities in non-Communist Asia and the impact
 of these activities on the non-Communist countries of the area, and to estimate the
 future role and influence of Communist China in Asia during the next five years or so.
 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
 1. Communist China's already powerful
 impact on non-Communist Asia will prob-
 ably increase, although only gradually,
 over the next few years, unless there is a
 serious crisis within China, a major
 change in the world situation, or a sub-
 stantial increase in the strength of the
 factors which work against Peiping's
 aspirations.
 2. Asia is impressed by the progress
 which the Chinese Communists have
 made in developing their economy and
 increasing their military power.  Most
 Asian governments believe that the Com-
 munist regime is firmly in control of the
 country and growing in strength.  The
 countries of the area, whether firmly
 anti-Communist or neutralist, take pos-
 sible Chinese Communist reactions into
 consideration when making major policy
 decisions.
 Non-Communist Asia as used in this estimate
 includes:  Japan, Korea, Nationalist China, Phil-
 ippines, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaya, Sing-
 apore, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, India, Nepal,
 Pakistan, Ceylon.  Hereinafter non-Communist
 Asia is referred to as Asia.
 3. Against the background of power
 which Peiping is able to project, many
 Asian countries are susceptible to its
 varied appeals and pressures.  Commu-
 nist China will continue to pose as the
 champion of peace and economic develop-
 ment and to identify itself with the wide-
 spread anti-Western prejudices which
 arose out of colonial experience. Many
 Asian leaders have an intellectual sym-
 pathy for Marxist economic concepts.
 Many believe also that in their underde-
 veloped countries there is no feasible
 alternative to state planning and financ-
 ing of major economic development. In
 these circumstances, there is a tendency
 to be more tolerant of the Communist
 economic system even when there is rec-
 ognition of and opposition to its excesses.
 4. On the other hand, there are impor-
 tant factors which work against Peiping's
 aspirations. Many Asian leaders dislike
 Communism, fear Communist China and
 mistrust its intentions.  The most im-
 portant factor limiting the expansion of
 its influence is the presence of the US in
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 Asia as an opposing force, supplying ele-
 ments of strength which the free nations
 still lack. Another major factor will be
 the degree of success of non-Communist
 governments in achieving a level of eco-
 nomic, political, and social progress
 acceptable to their people.
 5. For the most part, the present leaders
 of Asia value their hard-won independ-
 ence and recognize the ultimate threat of
 indigenous and Chinese Communism.
 They are seeking - with varying degrees
 of skill and energy - to satisfy the needs
 and potential pressures for social and eco-
 nomic betterment without sacrificing the
 basic values of their own cultures. Al-
 though the various Asian countries will
 react differently to Communist China in
 accordance with their varying back-
 grounds and interests, those that are not
 firmly anti-Communist are more apt to
 continue on or to take the road to neu-
 tralism than the road to affiliation with
 Peiping.  Among such countries there
 will probably be an increase in contacts
 with Peiping, which will enhance the
 prestige of Communist China.
 6. Although Communist China's military
 strength will almost certainly increase,
 we believe that it will refrain from using
 military means to achieve its objectives in
 Asia so long as its leaders believe that this
 would result in effective US military
 counteraction.  Rather they will seek to
 expand their power and influence in Asia,
 and to reduce that of the US, through
 other means. They will continue to con-
 centrate on economic inducements, the
 expansion of a broad range of official and
 unofficial contacts, and political subver-
 sion. They also hope to foster the devel-
 opment of indigenous Communist move-
 ments which can influence Asian govern-
 ments to adopt policies favorable to Com-
 munist China and which might eventu-
 ally assume power by parliamentary
 means or insurrection.
 7. Major political or economic crises in-
 side Communist China would consider-
 ably diminish its impact on Asia. On the
 other hand, any modification of US policy
 which appeared to Asians as a significant
 softening of US constancy and firm-
 ness in opposing Communist China
 and in helping Asian countries to achieve
 their aspirations, would enhance Pei-
 ping's prospects.  This would be particu-
 larly true if there appeared to be a sig-
 nificant weakening of US military capa-
 bilities against Communist China. A ma-
 jor change in the climate of the cold war
 could have important effects. Thus, if the
 Sino-Soviet Bloc became more bellicose,
 and threatening, there might be major
 policy changes in some Asian countries
 with some seeking neutralism and others
 increased affiliation with the West. Or, if
 tensions were reduced, closer relations be-
 tween Communist China and other Asian
 countries would probably develop, with
 an eventual enlargement of Peiping's
 ability to influence Asia.
 DISCUSSION
 8. We believe that Peiping's basic, long run
 objective is an Asia ruled by Communist
 governments, amenable to Communist China's
 influence, and dependent upon it for trade
 and political guidance.  This long run ob-
 jective, derived from Communist doctrine, is
 reinforced by the traditional Chinese view of
 China as the center of civilization.

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 9. Peiping almost certainly realizes that an at-
 tempt to gain this objective by military means
 would risk war with the US, so long as the lat-
 ter is committed to the defense of large parts
 of non-Communist Asia.  In addition, Com-
 munist China is seeking to transform an im-
 poverished, illiterate, agrarian society into a
 modern industrial state with a powerful mili-
 tary establishment.  Communist China's lead-
 ers appear to believe that their country needs
 time to complete this transformation and that
 their foreign policies must stop short of pro-
 voking destructive US military retaliation.
 10. Thus, Communist China is for the present
 directing its energies toward more immediate
 objectives. These include weakening the power
 position and influence of the US in Asia, in-
 creasing exploitable neutralist attitudes and
 the susceptibility to Communist influence, and
 gaining acceptance as the only legitimate gov-
 ernment of China and as a fully participating
 and increasingly important member of an
 Asian community of nations.  Moreover, they
 consider that their revolution is incomplete so
 long as they do not control Taiwan and they
 will almost certainly be prepared to exploit
 any opportunity to this end providing it does
 not seriously risk war with the US.
 FACTORS AFFECTING COMMUNIST
 CHINA'S ROLE IN ASIA
 11. Postwar instability, the climate of radical
 change in Asia, and the general course of the
 struggle between Communist and non-Com-
 munist worlds, are primary aspects of the
 broad environment within which Communist
 China strives to achieve its objectives in Asia.
 This evironment offers special opportunities
 and imposes certain limits on Peiping's pros-
 pects for success. Susceptibilities to Peiping's
 exploitation vary widely throughout the area
 because of the great diversities which exist
 among Asian countries, and because of the
 operation of counter factors, among which US
 power and influence are of prime importance.
 Asia's Economic and Political
 Aspirations
 12. In most of the countries of Asia, the
 achievement of independence in the wake of
 World War II was accompanied by general in-
 stability and characterized by unrealistic ex-
 pectations.  Most politically literate Asians
 felt that with independence their countries
 had become masters of their own fate and
 would soon enjoy the economic benefits and
 international prestige of modern societies.
 However, the new countries generally lacked
 the political sophistication, capital, technical
 skills, and administrative experience to deal
 with the myriad of problems which confronted
 them.  Furthermore, insurrectionary activi-
 ties, external aggression, and Communist sub-
 version have at one time or another disrupted
 the internal development of most of them. As
 a result, economic, political, and social prog-
 ress has been far below their expectations.
 13. Most Asian governments have tended to
 follow a paternalistic or authoritarian ap-
 proach in their efforts to cope with these prob-
 lems.  Because private capital, domestic or
 foreign, is not available to build the basic eco-
 nomic structure (power, transportation, etc.)
 required for industrial development, they
 have concluded that government must provide
 planning, management, and funds.  Many
 leaders have been strongly influenced by
 Marxist doctrine.  Furthermore, they tend to
 associate capitalism with colonialism. These
 attitudes, together with the Asian traditions
 of authoritarian and communal organization
 of society, create a certain susceptibility to the
 efforts of Moscow and Peiping to increase their
 influence.
 14. Communist economic  achievements in
 China have impressed many Asian leaders;
 the economic problems and certain develop-
 ment techniques of Communist China appear
 to them to have greater relevance to the situa-
 tions in their underdeveloped countries than
 do those of the West.  In addition, there is a
 disposition among certain Asian intellectual
 elements to contrast unfavorably the immense
 difficulties being experienced in their own
 societies with the cohesion and sense of na-
 tional purpose which in their view exist in
 Communist China.
 15. However, the appeal of the Communist
 solution is tempered by opposition to the ex-
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 cesses inherent in the Communist system.
 Many Asian leaders believe that they can
 achieve economic progress by their own meth-
 ods.             Even where the appeal of democracy is
 not strong, the determination of the ruling
 groups to maintain their own positions is an
 important deterrent to the growth of internal
 Communist influence.
 Anti-Colonialism and Nationalism
 16. Nationalism in most of Asia has drawn its
 force largely from a reaction to colonialism.
 Most of the present leaders of the new states
 of Asia were leaders of the struggle for in-
 dependence.  Many of them attribute their
 country's present backwardness to Western
 exploitation and have bitter memories of dis-
 criminatory treatment during the colonial
 period.  Generally speaking, their experiences
 have  been with  Western  and  not  with
 Communist  colonialism.  This  predisposes
 them to believe Communist explanations
 of imperialism.  Antagonisms arising from
 race and color are mingled with the re-
 sentments that survive from the colonial
 period.  Communist China, by stressing that
 it is an Asian country and by propagandizing
 its own experiences with Western exploitation,
 at times can capitalize on the colonialism and
 nationalism issues.  Although these both re-
 main important factors which can work to
 Communist China's advantage, there are in-
 dications that nationalism in Asia is becoming
 less motivated by virulent anti-colonialism
 and based more upon indigenous values and
 objectives.  Such a change could increase the
 importance of nationalism as an obstacle to
 Communist China's direct influence in Asia.
 The East-West Struggle and Neutralism
 17. One of the important factors in Asia is
 the East-West struggle and the pressure it
 exerts on Asian states which would like to con-
 centrate on their own problems.  Although
 there is an undercurrent of apprehension re-
 garding Communist China's real intentions,
 a desire to stand aside from the world's strife,
 while not universal, is widespread and in some
 countries is translated into a policy of neutral-
 ism.  Most Asian states fear that war between
 the major powers would inevitably embroil
 them and jeopardize their hopes of progress
 if not destroy their independence.  These
 neutralist sentiments are reinforced by sensi-
 tivity on the subject of nuclear war.  In this
 setting,  Peiping's  tranquilizing call for
 "peace" is more appealing than US reminders
 that continued national independence re-
 quires alertness and sacrifice.
 18. There are small but quite influential
 groups of Asians (particularly in intellectual
 circles) who are prone to make unfavorable
 comparisons between the Western and the
 Communist countries. Some of them consider
 that the West is crass, materialistic, and con-
 temptuous of the aspirations of the Asian
 races, while they look upon the citizens of the
 Communist countries as dedicated and self-
 sacrificing toilers for progress.  Even in the
 more numerous groups that regard Western
 ideas of political democracy as superior to
 Communism, there are a considerable number
 who habitually judge Western actions by
 Western criteria, which they do not apply in
 their assessment of Communist behavior. The
 application of this double standard often gives
 to the Communists, and withholds from the
 West, the benefit of the doubt in the inter-
 pretation of events.
 The Presence in Asia of Major
 Military Forces
 19. Both the West and the Sino-Soviet Bloc
 have major military forces in the Asian
 area.  This  confrontation reinforces  the
 Asian  concern  over  the  danger  of  war
 and its destructiveness.  Furthermore, the
 fact   that  Communist    China   has  the
 strongest  Asian military  force  has  led
 some states to seek to placate Peiping.  At the
 same time, many Asians, including even some
 neutralists, recognize the value of strong US
 forces as a major deterrent to Communist ag-
 gression.                                                                      Six Asian countries have entered
 into alliance with the US, and these countries,
 especially, are highly sensitive to indications
 of any change in US capability and intention
 to stand firm against Communist encroach-
 ment in Asia.

 Sino-Soviet Alliance
 20. Communist China's ability to exert influ-
 ence in Asia is also affected by its relations
 with the USSR.  Soviet economic assistance
 programs and diplomatic efforts in Asia, to-
 gether with the visits of its top leaders, have
 supported the general Communist line and
 thus indirectly enhanced Communist China's
 position.  Peiping has benefited from Soviet
 actions to the extent that they create the
 image of Communist "peaceful" intentions, as
 for example, Moscow's simple call for "ban
 the bomb"; but has been harmed to the extent
 that Soviet aggressiveness, as in Hungary, dis-
 illusions Asian observers.  On balance, we be-
 lieve that Communist China's prestige in
 Asian eyes has been enhanced by its associa-
 tion with the USSR and by its recognized
 position within the Bloc.2
 Local Communist Movements in Asia
 21. The existence of indigenous Communist
 parties or movements in Asian countries pro-
 vides an important auxiliary channel for im-
 plementing of Chinese Communist policies.
 However, because of their real or assumed
 links with Peiping, these parties and move-
 ments have at times worked to the disad-
 vantage of Communist China's current strat-
 egy of peace and coexistence, especially when
 they have resorted to political agitation or
 military action.
 2 The Director of Intelligence and Research, De-
 partment of State, believes that most Asian
 leaders dislike the Soviet political system and
 are aware that the ultimate objectives of inter-
 national Communism are inconsistent with their
 own objectives.  This attitude is to some degree
 reflected in their thinking on Communist China,
 particularly when that country, as in the past
 year, has repeatedly expressed its support of
 the Soviet Union.  This reaction to Communist
 China's close association with the Soviet Union
 is only partially balanced by other factors such
 as possible feeling of vicarious pride in Peiping's
 stature in the bloc.  Accordingly, it is believed
 that the last sentence should read: "On balance,
 we believe that Peiping's self-identification with
 the Soviet Union and its policies has probably
 tended to work to Peiping's detriment in the
 achievement of its immediate objectives in non-
 Communist Asia."
 The Overseas Chinese
 22. The large Overseas Chinese communities
 in many of the Southeast Asian countries rep-
 resent both an asset and a liability to Peiping.
 In most of these countries, Overseas Chinese
 control much of the commercial activity and
 play an important role in financial and in-
 dustrial fields.  As a result, they exercise
 influence and power disproportionate to their
 numbers and provide points of contact for
 Chinese Communist trade and subversive
 activities. Peiping has met with considerable
 success in inducing the return of Overseas
 Chinese students in Southeast Asia to the
 mainland. Of the Overseas Chinese that have
 any feeling of involvement in the future of
 China, more probably tend to identify them-
 selves with Communist China than with
 Taipei.  However, a substantial majority, be-
 cause of their primary concern with business
 activities and with maintaining good working
 relations with their host country, has sought
 to avoid entanglement in the political activi-
 ties of both Communist and Nationalist
 China.
 23. Local antagonism to Overseas Chinese,
 due to their economic position and their in-
 sistence on maintaining their separate iden-
 tity, poses some obstacles to the extension of
 Peiping's influence.  In particular, many gov-
 ernments are concerned that increased Chi-
 nese Communist activity within their country
 will aggravate the problem posed by the exist-
 ence of these unassimilated Chinese commu-
 nities.  The Overseas Chinese would become
 an important asset to Communist China only
 in case they became convinced that a success-
 ful Chinese Communist military invasion was
 imminent and that they had no alternative
 but to declare their allegiance to the home-
 land.  In these circumstances, the Overseas
 Chinese would acquire importance as a "fifth
 column."
 Non-Communist Strength and Influence
 In Asia
 24. Although Western political control has
 virtually disappeared from Asia during the
 past decade, Western influence and commit-
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 ments remain in the area and are important
 factors limiting the expansion of Communist
 China's influence.  Western aid was essential
 to the countering of the Communist threat to
 Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaya, and the
 Philippines.  Aid from the US and, to a lesser
 extent, from other Western countries, sus-
 tains a number of Asian states and seeks to
 improve their strength and stability so that
 present vulnerabilities in their societies will
 diminish.    More Asian leaders are coming to
 feel that accepting US aid is not inconsistent
 with maintaining the independence of the
 recipient state, but in fact often gives it suffi-
 cient strength to take increasing, independent
 initiative in the conduct of its affairs.  Fur-
 thermore, trade with the West is an important
 factor in sustaining the economies of most
 non-Communist Asian countries.
 25. The Chinese Communists must also take
 into account the strength of non-Communist
 elements in the various countries.  In South
 Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Viet-
 nam, and Japan, the governments and large
 portions of the population are vigorously anti-
 Communist.  The governments of Thailand,
 Malaya, and Pakistan have also followed anti-
 Communist policies both externally and in-
 ternally.  South Korea and the Republic of
 China have large and relatively well-equipped
 military forces.  Even the neutralist govern-
 ments of South and Southeast Asia, while
 prone to support certain Communist foreign
 policy positions, have sought, with the present
 exception of Indonesia, to weaken the position
 of native Communists.
 26. The existence of Nationalist China has
 continued to hamper Peiping's efforts to ex-
 tend its influence. Competition with the GRC
 for Overseas Chinese loyalties sharpens Com-
 munist China's dilemma of having to demon-
 strate its interest in the Overseas Chinese at
 the same time that it seeks to underplay this
 interest in its relations with the host govern-
 ments.  The fact that five Asian countries
 recognize Nationalist China and three addi-
 tional countries have adopted the policy of
 recognizing neither Nationalist nor Commu-
 nist China  restricts  Peiping's  diplomatic
 activities.
 27. Peiping's leadership aspirations are ham-
 pered by the present or potential influential
 roles which India and Japan are capable of
 playing.  However, the aspirations of New
 Delhi and Tokyo appear to be defined in terms
 more limited than those of Peiping: i.e., India
 in terms of moral and political leadership
 rather than domination; Japan as a principal
 industrial and commercial power in Asia.
 Exclusion from the UN
 28. Communist China's exclusion from the
 UN has provided Peiping and Moscow with a
 significant propaganda point among those
 Asians who, like the Indians, believe strongly
 that Peiping should represent China in the
 UN and that only US intransigence prevents
 this.  On balance, however, we believe Pei-
 ping's continued exclusion from the UN has
 worked to the disadvantage of Peiping's Asian
 ambitions.  Although claiming to be a lead-
 ing member of the Asian-African bloc, Com-
 munist China is forced to sit on the sidelines
 during discussions of important issues in the
 UN, which has become an increasingly impor-
 tant forum for the Asian states.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST TACTICS IN ASIA
 29. The Communist indigenous armed revolu-
 tions, which were initiated in the years just
 after World War II, have failed in Indonesia,
 Burma, Malaya, and the Philippines, and fell
 short of success in Vietnam.  Especially since
 the conclusion of hostilities in Indochina in
 1954, Peiping, in line with the shift in inter-
 national Communist tactics, has ceased to
 stress "national liberation movements" and
 has sought, by pursuing a generally non-
 violent line, to exploit Asian vulnerabilities
 and desires for neutrality and peace. To this
 end, it has developed a diverse tactical
 arsenal, including diplomacy, "people's diplo-
 macy," propaganda, subversion, military pres-
 sures, and economic inducements.
 30. There is little evidence concerning the divi-
 sion of responsibilities between Moscow and
 Peiping in directing and supporting Commu-
 nist activities in Asia, or the balance which ex-
 ists between external Communist direction and
 local Communist initiative.  Soviet influence

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 has appeared to be superior in most of the
 Asian Communist movements, with the excep-
 tion of Malaya and Thailand, though there
 are indications which suggest that Peiping's
 influence within the Asian Communist parties
 is increasing.  In any event, Moscow and
 Peiping appear in the main to be in close
 accord regarding the Communist campaign
 in Asia, whether their efforts involve the local
 Communist groups or are aimed more directly
 at the non-Communist countries.
 Diplomacy
 31. Peiping has placed considerable stress up-
 on attempts to achieve formal diplomatic rec-
 ognition as the sole government of China and
 has attempted to create an atmosphere of nor-
 malcy in its relations with the six non-Com-
 munist Asian countries that have recognized
 it.3  It has placed considerable emphasis on
 the exchange of official visitors between
 states.  In particular, the leaders of many
 South and Southeast Asian countries have
 traveled to Peiping and have been visited at
 least once in return by Premier Chou En-lai.
 Communist China has made political capital
 of its stated willingness to negotiate at any
 time with any state, the US included.
 "People's Diplomacy"
 32. Peiping has supplemented its conven-
 tional diplomacy by . an extensive program of
 "people's diplomacy," designed both as an
 entering wedge for the establishment of full
 diplomatic relations and as a means of in-
 creasing its influence in countries with which
 it already has official relations. To these ends,
 Peiping is recognized by six non-Communist
 countries in the Asian area: Burma, Ceylon, In-
 dia, Indonesia, Nepal, and Pakistan.  Of these
 states, only Nepal has recognized Peiping since
 the initial flurry of recognitions in 1949-1950.
 The Republic of China is recognized by five coun-
 tries of the area: Japan, Korea, Philippines, Thai-
 land, and Vietnam. Laos and Malaya have been
 extended recognition by both Peiping and Taipei,
 but have diplomatic relations with neither.  In
 addition, Peiping has an economic mission and
 Taipei a consulate in Cambodia, which officially
 recognizes neither the GRC nor the Peiping re-
 gime.
 it has sponsored the exchange of delegations
 of all types: cultural, scientific, economic, re-
 ligious, ethnic, educational, athletic, journal-
 ist, and civic.
 33. Despite the many demands on its strin-
 gent budget, Peiping bears most of the ex-
 penses of these exchanges.  In 1956, accord-
 ing to Peiping, about 60 Chinese Communist
 groups visited Asian countries and over 150
 groups, totaling perhaps 2,000 persons, came
 from non-Communist Asia to visit Commu-
 nist China.  On occasion these groups signed
 agreements relating to trade, labor, fisheries,
 and "friendship."  Of the Asian countries,
 Japan has received the greatest attention.
 Approximately 1,200 Japanese visited Commu-
 nist China in 1956, including such diverse
 representatives as coal miners, theatrical per-
 formers, former imperial army and navy offi-
 cers, and members of the Japanese Diet.
 34. Widespread sponsorship of front organiza-
 tions in Asia is an important aspect of "peo-
 ple's diplomacy."  "Chinese Friendship Soci-
 eties" now exist in many Asian countries, as
 do "National Peace Councils" which take their
 directives from the Communist World Peace
 Council.  Exploitation of religious groups and
 Asian students, including offers of scholar-
 ships and other inducements, is another facet
 of "people's diplomacy."
 35. "People's diplomacy" has proved to be an
 effective instrument.   Susceptible  visitors
 often accept Peiping's claims, most notably in
 the field of economic development.   Foreign
 delegations are flattered by the availability of
 Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai, and other high
 officials, who grant an unusual number of
 time-consuming interviews and appear well
 briefed on the composition and interests of the
 group in question.  Although some Asian
 visitors have voiced criticisms of the Peiping
 regime, many have publicly registered their
 favorable impressions of the regime's effective
 administration and economic progress. Even
 the visits of some confirmed anti-Communists
 have been exploited, either because they were
 impressed with what they saw in China, or
 were themselves persons whose very presence
 contributed to furthering Peiping's aims.

 Propaganda
 36. Closely allied with "people's diplomacy"
 is Communist  China's propaganda  effort
 throughout  Asia.   Peiping's propaganda
 broadcasts have doubled in volume since 1955,
 and are presently made in English, Spanish,
 Chinese, and a variety of other Asian lan-
 guages.  Chinese Communist literature and
 films are circulated in many countries of the
 area.  Peiping often underwrites the costs of
 locally written publications. Visiting Chinese
 delegations and cultural or theatrical groups
 are part of the total propaganda effort.
 37. Propaganda efforts to exploit and encour-
 age Asian neutralism are centered largely on
 the "five principles" which were first pro-
 claimed in their present form in a Chinese
 Communist-Indian agreement of 1954: "Mu-
 tual respect for each other's territorial integ-
 rity and sovereignty, mutual nonaggression,
 mutual noninterference in each other's inter-
 nal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and
 peaceful coexistence." These "five principles"
 have widespread appeal in Asian countries be-
 cause they hold out a promise of peace and
 friendly relations.  In recent years, Peiping's
 propaganda has refrained from criticism of
 the Asian neutrals or their domestic policies,
 and has sought to minimize apprehensions
 concerning Communist China's ultimate in-.
 tentions in Asia.
 Economic Inducements
 38. Communist China has achieved consider-
 able political gain from its relatively small
 foreign trade, and has made effective propa-
 ganda use of the few grants it has extended.4
 More importantly, it has created a growing
 impression in many Asian countries that
 closer economic relations with Communist
 China would be profitable.  At present Com-
 munist China is not capable of exporting large
 quantities of manufactured goods to the
 Asian markets nor does its economic policy
 call for the importation of large quantities of
 Communist China has recently extended eco-
 nomic aid grants to Cambodia (US $22,400,000
 in goods), Nepal ($12,600,000 in goods and cur-
 rency), and most recently Ceylon ($15,750,000, in
 lieu of continued preferential prices for rubber.)
 the products which most countries of Asia
 have available for export.  However, it prob-
 ably will increase its trade, and it will in any
 case continue to import ? such commodities as
 rubber, cotton, jute, and coconut oil.
 39. Communist China has on several occa-
 sions been able to gain considerable political
 advantage from well-timed. economic agree-
 ments, such as its rice for rubber deal with
 Ceylon in 1952. Moreover, Peiping has sought,
 through the negotiation of trade agreements,
 participation in trade fairs, and the despatch-
 ing of trade missions to Asian countries, to
 create an impression of growing economic
 power and a benevolent attitude.  Since 1954
 it has concluded trade agreements with
 Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Cam-
 bodia, expressing, in the main, a desire to ex-
 pand trade of mutual benefit and exchanging
 "shopping lists" of the prominent exports of
 each country.  A gradual increase in its mari-
 time capabilities will facilitate Communist
 China's ability to derive political advantages
 from commercial activities.
 40. Japan needs raw materials which Commu-
 nist China could furnish and is seeking to
 develop additional markets for its own ex-
 ports.  The Chinese Communist regime has
 attempted to capitalize on this situation by
 vague offers of grand scale economic collabo-
 ration.  These offers are linked with political
 conditions and are part of the Chinese Com-
 munist effort to neutralize Japan.  In Peip-
 ing's series of unofficial trade agreements with
 private Japanese business groups, it has
 sought to weaken Japan's adherence to CHIN-
 COM controls by offering such commodities as
 coal and iron ore, which Japan must import in
 large quantities, in exchange for restricted
 goods.  However, most Japanese recognize the
 vital importance of trade with the US and
 would be reluctant to take steps which would
 jeopardize this trade.
 Subversion
 41. Peiping appears to be employing a wide
 variety of subversive tactics which range from
 covert operations, designed to assist local Com-
 munists to overturn governments, to support
 of overt front groups, designed merely to in-
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 fluence opinion in favor of local or Chinese
 Communist causes.  Working through Over-
 seas Chinese, Peiping's subversive efforts in-
 clude economic pressures, the underwriting of
 front groups, penetration of schools and labor
 organizations, and the direction of espionage
 and  clandestine operations.  The  Chinese
 Communists also provide funds and covert
 support to indigenous Communists and Com-
 munist sympathizers to help them build good
 will and mass voting strength for the Commu-
 nist cause and to infiltrate government bu-
 reaucracies and armed forces. However, Peip-
 ing is not adverse to bypassing or undercut-
 ting the Asian Communist parties where other
 tactics promise to better advance Peiping's
 over-all objectives.
 42. The Chinese Communists have used the
 Bank of China as an instrument to increase
 their influence, especially among Overseas
 Chinese.  Peiping controls the branches in
 Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Pe-
 nang, Surabaya, Djakarta, Calcutta, Bombay,
 Karachi, Rangoon, and Chittagong.  These
 banks use their assets to finance pro-Commu-
 nist political groups, front organizations, pub-
 lications, and schools.  They make low in-
 terest loans to those who favor Communist
 causes or are willing to follow the Communist
 line, and they use defaulted loans as a means
 of political blackmail. The Burmese govern-
 ment has become alarmed by the activities of
 the Rangoon branch of the Bank of China
 and has taken steps to reduce its effectiveness.
 Military Pressures
 43. Although now pursuing a "peaceful" line,
 Peiping has employed military pressure in
 pursuit of its goals.  In addition to its pres-
 sures against the Offshore Islands, its military
 assistance to North Vietnam, and its inter-
 vention in Korea, Peiping has made military
 incursions into poorly defined areas of its bor-
 ders with Burma and the Indian sub-conti-
 nent, and has continued to train and assist the
 North Korea and the North Vietnam armed
 forces.  Furthermore, Peiping has probably
 given some monetary and training support to
 the armed rebellions in Malaya and Burma.
 However, the principal pressure in this field
 is the widespread recognition that Commu-
 nist China's growing military strength is al-
 ready greater than all non-Communist Asian
 forces put together.  The proximity of this
 military strength has served to reinforce neu-
 tralism in such countries as Burma and Laos
 and has led to a wish to avoid antagonizing
 Communist China, even in some countries
 aligned with the West.  Sensitivity to Com-
 munist China's military strength will remain
 high in Asia as Chinese Communist ground,
 air, and naval forces continue to obtain mod-
 ern equipment and to improve in efficiency.
 THE IMPACT OF COMMUNIST CHINA
 ON ASIA
 44. Communist China is now regarded through-
 out Asia as a major Asian power.  Most Asian
 leaders probably believe that the Communist
 regime has established firm control over its
 635 million people and that it will continue to
 rule the country for the foreseeable future.
 Furthermore, they appear to believe that
 Communist China has made substantial prog-
 ress toward establishing a modern industrial
 economy and has developed the strongest
 Asian military establishment.  The Chinese
 Communists have been able, by the tactics
 discussed above, to impress most Asians with
 the magnitude of their accomplishments and
 to play down the extent and nature of their
 sacrifices and internal difficulties.
 45. Asian nations, particularly in South and
 Southeast Asia, look upon Communist China
 with a mixture of admiration for its accom-
 plishments and fear of its size, power, and
 dynamism.  Peiping has exploited colonial,
 nationalist, and imperialist issues at the in-
 ternational level, has emphasized the problems
 it shares with other underdeveloped Asian
 countries, and has asserted its willingness to
 help them. It has succeeded in obscuring its
 external objectives by directing Asian atten-
 tion to the similiarity between its own eco-
 nomic and social aspirations and those of
 most Asian countries - to end poverty and
 illiteracy, to raise the standard of living, and
 to press forward with programs of economic
 development.
 46. Furthermore, since the Indochina armi-
 stice, Communist China has posed, with con-
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 siderable success, as a country which is seek-
 ing its objectives by peaceful means.  The
 fluctuating tensions arising over the Taiwan
 Strait appear to many Asian leaders to spring
 not so much from the truculence of Commu-
 nist China as from its desire to regain control
 of its own territory.  The peaceful appearance
 of the Chinese Communist has been enhanced
 by the many Communist inspired "peace"
 movements and calls for banning of nuclear
 weapons.
 47. In all Asian states there is a fundamental
 desire to work out their national destinies
 without outside interference. This has placed
 certain limits on the expansion of Peiping's
 influence.  Although the Asian states are, in
 varying degrees, susceptible to outside guid-
 ance and willing to accept foreign aid, none
 of them regard themselves as followers of any
 foreign leader, Asian or otherwise.
 Impact of Communist China on Specific
 Countries
 48. The impact of Communist China in Asia,
 as reflected in official governmental policies,
 varies widely from country to country.  Fur-
 thermore, in most Asian countries there are
 groups - political, economic, and ethnic -
 whose reactions to Communist China differ
 from those of their governments.  In some
 instances these groups have sufficient strength
 and their views of Communist China are at
 such variance with the official policies of their
 governments that, over the longer run or in
 periods of crisis, they might force a change in
 present official policies.
 49. The Republics of China, Korea, and Viet-
 nam:  The GRC and the Korean government
 both view Communist China as an aggressor
 and a direct threat to their existence.  They
 both feel that military action will ultimately
 be required to remove this threat.  The GRC
 denies that the Peiping regime is stable or
 that it enjoys popular support.  Taipei con-
 siders itself in direct competition with Pei-
 ping for the loyalties of the Overseas Chinese
 and for international recognition as the legit-
 imate government of China.  Vietnam views
 Communist China chiefly in terms of Pei-
 ping's support of North Vietnam and conse-
 quently actively seeks to prevent any exten-
 sion of Chinese Communist influence.
 50. Thailand, Philippines, and Pakistan: Al-
 though all these countries are members of
 SEATO, their primary motives for lining up
 with the West differ.
 a. Thailand views Communist China as a
 potential military threat and is suspicious of
 the loyalty of its large Overseas Chinese mi-
 nority.  In the postwar period, in the Thai
 view, there has been safety and profit in
 alignment with the West.  Although the Thai
 government has not altered its official policies,
 Communist China's growing economic and
 military might, its proximity to the Thai bor-
 ders, and its current line of peaceful coexist-
 ence are beginning to have a significant im-
 pact in Thailand.  There is a growing desire
 for at least limited economic and cultural con-
 tacts with Communist China. There has been
 some increase in neutralist sentiment, and
 growing reluctance to follow foreign policies
 directly antagonistic to Communist China.
 b. The Philippines aligned itself with the
 West because of its historical association with
 the West and its close relations with the US.
 It views the Peiping regime as a somewhat
 remote threat and has no particular desire for
 contacts with Communist China.
 c. Pakistan's alignment with the West ap-
 pears to have been motivated in the first in-
 stance by its desire to obtain weapons to
 counter the threat which it believes is posed
 by India, and only secondarily by the dangers
 of external Communist aggression.  To the
 extent the latter is recognized, Pakistan is
 more apprehensive concerning possible Soviet
 action than Chinese Communist.  It attrib-
 utes its growing Communist problem in East
 Pakistan to Indian, rather than to Chinese,
 influences.  Pakistan is impressed by Commu-
 nist China's material accomplishments and,
 despite its membership in SEATO, maintains
 a friendly posture toward Peiping.
 51. Japan:   Japan tends to view the long-
 range Communist threat more in terms of
 the USSR than Communist China.  Because
 of Japan's close and deeply-rooted cultural

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 and other ties with the China mainland, most
 Japanese tend to regard the Peiping regime
 as more Chinese than Communist, and do not
 consider that the Chinese Communists pose
 a direct threat to Japan itself.  Pressures for
 closer relations with Peiping, particularly for
 increased trade, are strong and are increasing.
 On the other hand, Japanese conservative
 leaders, though impressed by Communist
 China's material accomplishments, are begin-
 ning to show concern at the buildup of a rival
 industrial power in Asia; they are becoming
 particularly disturbed over the threat of Chi-
 nese Communist economic competition in
 South and Southeast Asia.  While they have
 little faith in the durability of the Nationalist
 government on Taiwan, most responsible Jap-
 anese leaders believe that Communist control
 of the island would threaten Japan's security.
 Despite the attraction of the continent, the
 Japanese generally recognize the primary im-
 portance of their defense and economic ties
 with the US and the West; fear that these
 ties may be jeopardized inhibits them from
 seeking too close a relationship with the Chi-
 nese Communist regime.
 52. Laos and Cambodia: Both these countries
 feel the impact of Communist China's prox-
 imity, although Laos tends to regard North
 Vietnam as a more immediate threat to its
 independence.  The Royal Lao government is
 preoccupied with the Pathet Lao problem and
 will continue to view its relations with Com-
 munist China in terms of that problem.  The
 Cambodian government has adopted a policy
 of nonalignment.  Although it accepts aid
 from the US and does not want to lose the
 protection it enjoys as a result of the SEATO
 protocol, most of its leaders view Communist
 China with considerable awe and admiration
 and have encouraged numerous contacts, in-
 cluding trade and aid.  However, they oppose
 Communism within Cambodia as a threat to
 their position, and they are fearful of any in-
 creased Chinese Communist influence in their
 country, especially among the Overseas Chi-
 nese.
 53. India, Ceylon, and Nepal:
 a. India, the most important and influential
 of the unaligned Asian countries, takes a con-
 ciliatory attitude toward Communist China
 and plays up Peiping's professions of peace-
 ful intent.  India believes it is thus carrying
 out its self-assigned mission of reducing inter-
 national tensions by mediating between the
 Bloc and the West.  It hopes also to contain
 possible Communist Chinese expansionist aims
 by putting Peiping on record against aggres-
 sion and interference in other countries' af-
 fairs.  Indians feel an affinity for Commu-
 nist China as a fellow Asian nation which has
 rid itself of foreign encroachment and which
 is now facing problems similar to those of
 India. Indian leaders were concerned by Chi-
 nese Communist activities in Nepal, in Tibet,
 and along the Burma border; many Indian
 leaders apparently believe that Communist
 China presents a possible long-range security
 threat to India.  The Indian government has
 quietly been devoting considerable attention
 to improving India's strategic and political
 defenses in the northeast and to strengthen-
 ing India's position in Nepal, Sikkim, and
 Bhutan.  Indian leaders currently think of
 themselves as competing with Communist
 China in the field of economic development,
 and they emphasize New Delhi's efforts to
 progress economically by democratic means
 in contrast to Peiping's totalitarian methods.
 b. Ceylon's attitudes toward Communist
 China are based on a feeling of remoteness
 from any aggressive threat from Communist
 China and on the profitable trade relationship
 which has developed between the two coun-
 tries.  Ceylon has shown a marked willingness
 to increase its cultural and economic ties
 with Communist China since the Bandara-
 naike government came to power in Ceylon in
 1956.
 c. Nepal has been increasingly receptive to
 Communist China's stepped up overtures as
 a counterweight to Indian attempts to in-
 fluence Nepali affairs.  The trend was re-
 versed when the Singh government came to
 power in July 1957 and adopted a policy of
 closer ties with India and tactful de-emphasis
 of the relationship with China.  However,
 Singh was ousted in November, and continu-
 ing political instability may provide oppor-
 tunities to Peiping to increase its influence
 there.

 54. Burma : The Burmese government main-
 tains an official position of neutrality.  How-
 ever, its outlook is affected by fear of Com-
 munist China's strength, proximity, and ulti-
 mate aims, and by a belief that it can best
 preserve its independence by not antagoniz-
 ing Peiping.  As Communist China's strength
 grows, the Burmese leaders tend to count more
 and more on the protection afforded by the
 US presence in Asia, but they do not admit
 this publicly. Burma's attitudes toward Com-
 munist China are clouded by the border dis-
 pute between the two countries, by its prob-
 lems with Communist insurrectionists, by
 growing left-wing opposition, and by Overseas
 Chinese problems.
 55. Indonesia : Indonesia's governmental lead-
 ers, particularly Sukarno and his immediate
 entourage, are greatly impressed by the eco-
 nomic achievements and the apparent unity
 and purpose in Communist China.  A number
 of them view the Indonesian Communist Party
 (PKI) as an important and comparatively
 respectable nationalist group and have sought
 its support.  Sukarno in particular desires to
 adapt certain features of Chinese Commu-
 nism to Indonesian problems and to bring the
 PKI into the government.  Although most
 Indonesian leaders feel their country is not
 immediately threatened by Chinese Commu-
 nist aggression, there are political leaders,
 parties and groups who oppose Sukarno's
 views and who identify the PKI with interna-
 tional Communism.  Moreover, there is some
 concern with Peiping's possible hold over the
 Overseas Chinese minority and with the activ-
 ities of the Chinese Communist embassy
 among this group. If the PKI is successful in
 its efforts to gain power in Indonesia by par-
 liamentary means, an added impetus would
 be given to Communist movements through-
 out Asia and the general prestige of Commu-
 nist China would be enhanced, even though
 the PKI's success was achieved without visible
 assistance from Peiping.
 56. Malaya: The newly independent Malayan
 government views Communist China almost
 entirely in terms of its long struggle against
 the Communist insurrection and the problems
 created by a large, unassimilated Chinese pop-
 ulation.  It is especially fearful of the impact
 Communist China may have among Malaya's
 Overseas Chinese who have begun to compete
 politically on a more nearly equal basis with
 the slightly larger but economically backward
 Malay community.  It desires to minimize
 contacts with Communist China, except for a
 certain amount of trade conducted through
 Hong Kong, or any forms of Chinese Commu-
 nist influence which would aggravate these
 problems.  It is also fearful that Chinese
 Communist  influence  and  infiltration  in
 Singapore may threaten its own security.
 57. Singapore : The Crown Colony of Singa-
 pore is approximately 85 percent Chinese.
 Consequently, both the UK and the present
 Singapore government are especially con-
 cerned with the impact of Communist China
 and have taken strong measures to repress
 left-wing  and  Communist-front  political,
 labor, and student organizations. However,
 significant pro-Peiping sentiment continues to
 exist in the Chinese population of Singapore
 and there will almost certainly be continuing
 opportunities for Chinese Communist sub-
 version.
 FUTURE TRENDS
 58. Assuming that there is no outbreak of war
 directly involving Communist China,  the
 Chinese Communist regime probably will
 remain in firm control of the mainland of
 China, will continue to direct its resources and
 energies largely to internal problems, and will
 achieve some degree of progress in economic
 development.  Its military capabilities will al-
 most certainly increase as it improves the
 efficiency, arms and equipment of its ground
 forces, continues to develop its air force, and
 expands its naval and maritime capabilities.
 However, Communist China will probably re-
 frain from overt military aggression so long
 as its leaders believe that this would result in
 effective US military counteraction against
 the mainland.
 59. Under these conditions and assuming no
 drastic changes in US policy or in the in-
 tensity or character of the struggle between
 the Communist and non-Communist worlds,
 we believe that over the next few years the al-
 ready powerful impact of Communist China
 on Asia will continue to increase, although
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400480001-5
 only gradually.  The presence of the US
 in Asia will continue to be the major factor
 damping down the growth of Peiping's influ-
 ence and obstructing Peiping's efforts to
 translate its growing prestige into specific
 action, such as diplomatic recognition or ad-
 mission to the UN.  There are many other
 factors which may counteract the impact of
 Communist China. One of particular impor-
 tance would be the success of non-Commu-
 nist governments in achieving a level of
 economic, political, and social progress ac-
 ceptable to their people.  In any event, we
 believe that there will be an increase in Pei-
 ping's cultural and economic relations with
 other Asian countries, which will enhance its
 prestige.  With respect to the two most im-
 portant countries of the area, India is unlikely
 to make any significant change in its policy
 toward Communist China as long as Nehru
 heads the government; Japan, although mov-
 ing toward an increase of officially approved
 trade and cultural relations, is likely to stop
 short of any over-all rapprochement that
 would jeopardize its relations with the US.
 Nevertheless, we believe that five years hence
 the weight of Communist China on Asia and
 its ability to influence developments in the
 area will have increased somewhat.
 60. Any modification of US policy which was
 interpreted in Asia as tending toward a sig-
 nificant softening of US constancy and firm-
 ness in opposing Communist China would en-
 hance Peiping's prospects for expanding its
 influence.  This would be particularly true if
 such modification resulted in a significant
 weakening of US military capabilities against
 Communist China.  Likewise a substantial
 reduction in US support and assistance to
 Asian countries would probably be interpreted
 as a lessening of US interest in the destiny
 of the countries affected and would increase
 economic difficulties in these countries.  This
 would, in varying degrees, enhance Commu-
 nist China's prospects.
 61. A significant change in the intensity of
 the East-West struggle could have important
 effects.  If the Sino-Soviet Bloc dropped its
 general line of peace and coexistence in Asia
 and became bellicose and threatening, we be-
 lieve that throughout Asia there would be a
 general re-examination of national positions
 and of the relative power positions of the US
 and of the Sino-Soviet Bloc.  There would
 probably be a clearer demarcation of Commu-
 nist and non-Communist influence in Asia,
 although not necessarily along present lines.
 For example, Thailand especially is sensitive
 to trends in the relative strengths of the ma-
 jor powers in the Far East and might shift to
 neutralism if its leaders concluded a war of
 uncertain outcome was imminent.  Burma,
 on the other hand, might seek increased ties
 with the West.
 62. If Communist behavior is such that ten-
 sions in the Far East are substantially re-
 duced, most Asian countries, except Nation-
 alist China, Korea, and Vietnam, would prob-
 ably cautiously relax their present suspicions
 of Peiping and move gradually toward broader
 contacts and normal diplomatic relations with
 Communist China.  This, in time, would en-
 large Peiping's ability to influence these
 countries.
 63. Major developments within Communist,
 China could also affect the impact of Com-
 munist China in Asia.                                                                   A serious and pro-
 longed crisis on the mainland would impede
 Peiping's efforts by undermining its pose as a
 progressive  and dynamic  state,  while  a
 marked improvement in conditions would, on
 the other hand, enhance Peiping's prestige.
 Moreover, serious economic and political dif-
 ficulties in any of the Asian countries would
 increase its vulnerability to Peiping's blan-
 dishments, while an improvement in internal
 stability would have an opposite effect.
