 Delegates vote for the resolution on the report of General Secretary Brezhnev
 THE CPSU CONGRESS
 Spotlight on Bre hnev
 "/ 14
 ~ 1> Lt VC 9~
 The spotlight contin`bted to be or( General
 Secretary Brezhnev as party congress speakers
 discussed his report delivered on February 24. His
 pre-eminence was emphasized by the speakers'
 lavish praise of his leadership abilities and per-
 sonal characteristics and by his own banter with
 the speakers, which was reminiscent of
 Khrushchev. Soviet delegates did not make any
 new proposals in the domestic area. Many
 criticized various economic bureaucracies in
 Moscow, and some seemed to second Brezhnev's
 call for reorganizing economic management.
 Soviet speakers were, as expected, content to
 follow Brezhnev's lead on international issues,
 drawing what comments they made from the
 foreign policy themes outlined by the General
 Secretary last week. Brezhnev's two Politburo
 colleagues with heavy responsibility for Soviet
 relations with the outside world, Foreign Minister
 Gromyko and Defense Minister Grechko, did not
 speak at the congress.
 Brezhnev's call for a continuation of his
 "peace program" was endorsed routinely by sub-
 sequent Soviet speakers, most often in general
 terms with little discussion of US-Soviet relations.
 Some, however, including Leningrad party boss
 Romanov, warned of imperialist machinations
 and Western attempts to fan dissent, and remind-
 ed their listeners that detente entails heightened
 ideological confrontation. Others, notably
 Premier Kosygin, laid stress on Soviet plans to ex-
 pand ties with "all countries," even as they

 gloated over the economic troubles in the
 capitalist world.
 China remained the object of the most
 heated abuse. Maoism appeared to have the edge
 over imperialism as the Soviets' number-one
 foreign policy concern.
 The East Europeans
 Opponents of Soviet hegemony in the Marx-
 i;t world were not bashful about making their
 case in Moscow. As expected, the Romanian and
 Yugoslav representatives diverged sharply from
 their fellow East Europeans in maintaining the
 right of each party and state to develop its
 political line independently and in a "creative"
 manner.
 Having made this point, Romanian party
 leader Ceausescu, in a show of independence,
 returned for a few days to Bucharest. His
 reappearance in Moscow on Wednesday coin-
 cided with rumors circulating in the Soviet capital
 that the bloc party leaders and heads of govern-
 inent attending the congress will meet in an infor-
 mal summit as they did in 1971.
 The West European Parties
 /-3
 An analysis of the speeches given by West
 European delegates to the Soviet party congress
 underlines the growing tendency of the major
 Western parties to dissociate themselves from
 Moscow's style of communist rule. More
 orthodox statements by some of the smaller West
 European parties failed to right the balance in
 -avor of fidelity to the Soviet line.
 The major West European parties stressed
 their national identities and the need to form
 alliances with non-communist forces. They played
 down the international aspects of communism
 and theSoviet leadership role.
 The Italians were the most heretical. Party
 leader Enrico Berlinguer emphasized that his par-
 ty's autonomy was the reason it had captured the
 support of an increasing number of Italian voters.
 The congratulations Berlinguer offered to the
 Soviets for their progress on East-West issues were
 marred by his failure to express full "solidarity"
 with the Soviet party, as he did at the last Soviet
 congress in 1971.
 He also implied that his own party's accep-
 tance of certain features of Italian foreign
 policy-including membership in NATO-had
 contributed toward better East-West relations.
 The same passage suggested that Italy's "inter-
 national alliances" help protect the Italian people
 from "foreign interference." By not specifically
 mentioning the US in this regard, Berlinguer was
 ambiguous enough for his audience to conclude
 that he was talking about both the US and the
 USSR.
 In an apparent attempt to improve the at-
 mosphere between the two parties, General
 Secretary Brezhnev met with Berlinguer on Mon-
 day. The two leaders issued a joint statement
 recognizing the need for international coopera-
 tion and mutual respect for each party's
 autonomy. The full statement is not available, but
 an Italian spokesman said differences of opinion
 were evident in the talks.
 The French Communist Party reinforced the
 independent line taken at its own congress last
 month by not sending party chief Georges
 Marchais to Moscow. It was the first time the
 leader of the party has not attended a Soviet con-
 gress.
 His substitute, French Politburo member
 Gaston Plissonnier, did not, as Marchais did last
 month, accuse the Soviets of abusing human
 rights, but he called for guarantees for individual
 and  collective freedom and defended
 "French-style socialism."
 Plissonnier criticized the Soviets for being too
 lenient on Giscard's foreign policy, which the
 French Communists see as being more Atlanticist
 than that of his Gaullist predecessors. By raising
 this issue, the French party is again indicating that

 it expects Moscow to halt what it sees as in-
 terference in French politics designed to bolster
 the French left's opponents.
 Plissonnier made clear that while the French
 Communists are aiming for more independence
 in their domestic activities, they are not renoun-
 cing cooperation with Moscow on foreign policy
 issues. He pointed out, however, that "proletarian
 internationalism" no longer means that the
 Soviets can expect acceptance of their interests as
 the common good at the expense of the interests
 of the other parties.
 Spanish party leader Santiago Carrillo attend-
 ed a meeting of Spanish and Italian leftists in
 Rome rather than the Moscow conclave. Dolores
 Ibarruri, who has been in exile in Moscow as
 honorary president of the Spanish Communist
 Party, delivered the Spanish address to the con-
 gress. She gave only a lukewarm endorsement of
 the Soviet party in contrast to her laudatory
 remarks in 1971, when she praised it as the
 "vanguard in the world's advance toward
 socialism."
 Portugal's party chief Cunhal gave a more
 orthodox performance. He pledged the eternal
 friendship of the Portuguese party and insisted
 that Moscow's leadership is essential for the
 world communist movement. Anticipating his
 continued loyalty, the Soviets scheduled Cunhal
 as the first West European speaker on the second
 day of the congress. In 1971, Cunhal spoke on the
 tenth day.
 The addresses given by some of the smaller
 West European parties-the West German,
 Austrian, and Greek, for example-were also in
 line with what Moscow likes to hear. The leader
 of the West Berlin splinter group, for example,
 launched one of the most vigorous attacks against
 anti-Sovietism, while Austrian Communist chief
 Muhri declared that solidarity with Moscow serv-
 ed the national interests of Austria.
 With the possible exception of the West Ger-
 man party, however, the tone of the speeches
 given by the smaller parties was not uniformly
 subservient. The Austrian party leader said, for ex-
 ample, that socialism meant "broad freedoms"
 and advocated cooperation between communists
 and socialists.

 Among the smaller parties, the Belgians
 appeared to take the most independent line,
 mentioning neither Brezhnev, the Chinese, nor
 proletarian internationalism and noting that it was
 sometimes necessary to take a "different ap-
 proach" than Moscow in developing socialism.
 4-S
 Fidel Castro's address to the 25th congress of
 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on
 February 25 in Moscow was a careful mixture of
 adulation, confidence, and ostensible humility in-
 tended to defend Moscow from its ideological
 antagonists and to assure the Soviets of Cuba's
 loyalty. By his selection of words, Castro
 demonstrated that the issues that had strained
 Cuban-Soviet relations so severely nine years ago
 are no longer even minor irritants. Cuban submis-
 sion has been complete. The brash young Carib-
 bean rebel of the mid-1960s has been replaced by
 the mature, responsible, self-critical member of
 the team; as a result, bilateral relations have never
 been better.
 Castro's new discipline and "humility" show-
 ed in the brevity of his speech and in his admis-
 sion that "there is very little that the Cuban com-
 munists can teach and much that we must learn in
 a gathering such as this." The same firebrand who
 years ago had not hesitated to challenge Moscow
 on virtually any ideological tenet last week extoll-
 ed the Soviet communists who "have been ex-
 traordinary fountains of experience and teaching
 for all the revolutionaries of the world."
 The faithful Castro, to prolonged applause,
 continued Havana's anti-Chinese invective by
 describing the "Maoists" as  reactionaries,
 slanderers, intriguers, or traitors, and predicted
 that they would be swept aside by history. Ap-
 parently willing to sweep aside his own condem-
 nation of the USSR as late as 1972 for allegedly
 failing to give adequate support to the Viet-
 namese, he defended the Soviets from charges
 that they had abandoned revolutionaries out of
 expediency. Instead, he claimed, "since the
 Soviet state was founded, wherever people
 fought for their liberation-as in our
 homeland-in Europe, Asia, Africa, or  in Latin
 America, the support and solidarity of Soviet
 communists was never lacking." He described the
 USSR as "an indestructible shield checking the
 aggressive impetus of imperialism against small
 and powerless nations."
 The confident Castro, buoyed no doubt by
 the success of his military forces in Angola, hinted
 that other Angolas would take place. "Changes in
 the world will not stop," he said; "the future
 belongs entirely to socialism and communism
 without anyone being able to export revolution,
 nor impose it by means of war, nor prevent the
 peoples from making it." Sensitive, as always, to
 charges that he is a Soviet puppet, or that he sent
 Cuban troops to Angola at Soviet behest, he af-
 firmed: "Never has the Soviet Union-which has
 given such decisive aid to our people-ap-
 proached us to demand anything from us, to set
 forth a condition, to tell us what we must do."
 Castro is clearly pleased with the trend of re-
 cent events, with his relations with Moscow, with
 the prestige his troops in Angola have earned for
 him, and with the opportunity to rub elbows with
 other dignitaries visiting Moscow for the con-
 gress. Some minor frictions may develop between
 him and his hosts in other countries after he
 leaves Moscow and begins stopping off in Eastern
 Europe and elsewhere, but there is nothing on
 the horizon that would seem a serious threat to
 the optimism he has displayed so far on this trip.
 Brezhnev did not attend the session on
 March 1, at which Kosygin presented the five-year
 economic plan (1976-80). His absence gave the
 appearance of a snub, and a decline in Kosygin's
 status since the last congress was apparent in
 other ways. Kosygin gave a largely uncritical
 recital of economic accomplishments of the past
 five years and added no new details to the present
 plan. After debate on Kosygin's report, the con-
 gress met on March 4 to elect the new Central
 Committee, which, in turn, elects the Politburo.

 Prime  inister
 President Costa Gomewatch and
 alist leader Soares signs the agreement
 PORTUGAL                6-,l 2-
 MILITARY ROLE REDUCED
 Portuguese political parties and military
 leaders signed an agreement last week giving
 civilian politicians a greater role in running the
 government during a four-year transition to
 civilian rule. The military still has the means to in-
 tervene or override unsatisfactory legislation if it
 desires, but the parties hope early legislative and
 presidential elections will give them the political
 legitimacy necessary to assert their dominance.
 The pact substantially reduces the direct role
 of the armed forces in Portugal's political process,
 assigning most policy functions to the legislative
 assembly, the president, and the cabinet. The all-
 military Revolutionary Council, which has been
 the major decision making body for nearly a year,
 will remain the ultimate authority in military
 matters, but will be reduced to serving primarily
 as an advisory council to the president on political
 affairs.
 The council will, however, retain significant
 powers and will serve as a check on the president.
 With the council's authorization, the president
 can declare war or invoke emergency powers.
 The council also may remove the president by
 declaring him physically incapacitated. The coun-
 cil will also have an impact on the legislative
 process through its power to require the presi-
 dent to veto any bill it considers unconstitutional.
 The legislature can override such a veto by a
 two-thirds majority.
 Most importantly, the military council retains
 the right to intervene in politics   virtue of its
 recognized role as the "guarantor

 institutions" and protector of the constitution and
 the goals of the revolution. The armed forces may
 also continue to influence the political process
 through the presidency because one of its
 members is expected to be elected to the post.
 Most political parties see little chance of electing
 a civilian president and are seeking to agree on a
 military candidate, like Prime Minister Azevedo
 or army chief of staff Eanes.
 The final agreement is a victory for the non-
 Communist political parties, which last spring
 had to sign a pact that certified military
 dominance for at least three years. The
 democratic parties wanted to force the armed
 forces to admit that things have changed in the
 past year, but they did not want a complete
 military withdrawal from politics at this tran-
 sitional stage. These parties recognize that
 military backing will ensure the stability needed
 to govern.
 The centrist Popular Democrats were most
 vocal in demanding concessions from the
 military. Talks stalled for weeks over the party's
 contention that presidential elections should be
 held as close to legislative elections as possible in
 order to prevent President Costa Gomes from
 molding the next government. A date has not yet
 been established for presidential elections, but
 they are expected to take place in late June, about
 two months after the legislative elections on April
 25. The Popular Democrats settled for a two-
 month hiatus in exchange for an amendment to
 the pact specifying that its provisions will not
 become operational until a president is elected.
 Consequently, the Azevedo cabinet will remain in
 office until a new president is sworn in.
 An elected government in Lisbon will have
 no easier job than that of previous military-con-
 trolled governments. The left is still using the
 deteriorating economy and rising unemployment
 to justify anti-government demonstrations and
 limited strikes, which may become more frequent
 if the cabinet does not complete a new wage
 policy to replace the wage freeze that expired
 earlier this week.
 Right-wing farmers are incensed by the
 agrarian reform policies of the earlier leftist
 military governments and have threatened to cut
 off food supplies to Lisbon this week if their
 demands are not met. Similar threats by the
 farmers in recent months were not carried out.
 The left is warning of the danger of a right-
 wing coup by such disenchanted conservatives as
 the farmers or groups of Angolan refugees. Abor-
 tive coups have affected the political balance in
 Portugal twice during the past year, and the left
 may be trying to incite the right to premature ac-
 tion before elections in hopes of mounting a
 countercoup.
 SETTLING THE ECONOMY) 3 -3 k!
 The Sixth Provisional Government under
 Prime Minister Azevedo has taken a number of
 steps to restore order to Portugal's chaotic
 economy. To stave off a foreign payments crisis,
 Lisbon has lined up substantial Western financial
 assistance and enacted measures to bolster the
 current account. At home, the government has
 made tentative moves to stimulate private
 economic activity and to invigorate the large
 nationalized sector. Azevedo is giving top priority
 to restoration of civil order and worker discipline.
 More lasting solutions to Portugal's deep-seated
 economic problems will have to await a return to
 political stability following parliamentary and
 presidential elections.
 Recent borrowing, progress in other loan
 negotiations, and new measures to improve the
 balance of payments indicate that substantial gold
 sales can be delayed at least until midyear.
 Foreign reserves fell roughly $1 billion in 1975, to
 about $1.4 billion at the end of the year.
 Largely because of its swing toward less
 radical policies, Lisbon has recently been more
 successful in its quest for credits. The West Ger-
 man central bank has agreed to lend $250 million
 against gold collateral for a period of six months
 to two years. Switzerland has loaned $50 million

 on similar terms. Lisbon has borrowed $85 million
 from the International Monetary Fund's Oil Facili-
 ty, and negotiations for loans from the Bank of
 France and from the Bank for International
 Settlements have been reported.
 In January, a team from the European Invest-
 ment Bank tentatively accepted proposals from
 Lisbon for a dozen projects to be financed by the
 $175 million in concessionary loans the European
 Community authorized for Portugal last year.
 Disbursements could begin before the end of
 April. In addition, the Community agreed in prin-
 ciple to expand Portugal's regular borrowing
 rights by nearly $60 million and is studying several
 possible food aid arrangements. Negotiations are
 now in progress to expand the preferential treat-
 ment of Portuguese exports to the EC and
 broaden Portuguese access to EC technology.
 Lisbon has obtained little help from the Com-
 munist world, notwithstanding numerous official
 visits and cultural exchanges, an increase in trade,
 and a variety of new accords.
 The Azevedo government has enacted a
 number of wide-ranging measures aimed at im-
 proving the balance of payments.
 ?  To cut imports, it has boosted gas-
 oline prices to the highest levels in Western
 Europe and extended temporary surcharges
 on non-oil imports through the first quarter.
 ?  To promote foreign sales, it has
 offered exporters insurance against ex-
 change rate fluctuations and production
 cost increases.
 ?  To revive emigrant remittances, it
 has authorized banks to set up special
 foreign exchange accounts.
 ?  To raise tourist receipts, it has set up
 an Institute for Tourism Development.
 ?  To attract foreign capital, it has
 enacted a code of rules for foreign invest-
 ment.
 The government has imposed tax and wage
 measures to discourage consumption so that im-
 ports can be reduced and resources freed for ex-
 port or domestic investment. Wage rates were
 frozen through February, and on March 5 the
 Council of Ministers is to consider a draft decree
 that would establish a longer term wage policy.
 An attempt to suspend food subsidies and to free
 prices aborted because of adverse popular reac-
 tion encouraged by leftist parties.
 Azevedo has budgeted more than $1
 billion-a 90-percent increase over 1975-for
 public works, housing, and other investments.
 After months of neglect, the government has
 finally moved to organize the direction of
 nationalized industrial and financial enterprises
 and is reportedly planning to return to private
 owners some 300 small- and medium-sized
 businesses that were taken over by their
 employees. To stabilize the agricultural situation,
 the government has promised not to expropriate
 land north of the Tagus River or farms under 75
 acres elsewhere. Most land remains in private
 hands, with nearly 40 percent of total acreage in
 units of 50 acres or less.
 The new measures are no cure for Portugal's
 economic problems. The encouragement so far
 offered to private businessmen and foreign in-
 vestors, for example, may have little impact. The
 guarantees and incentives are undermined by in-
 adequacies in the foreign investment code and
 fuzzy links between the public and private sec-
 tors. Western financial assistance should,
 however, permit the country to avoid a major
 devaluation, large gold sales, or a domestic
 economic crisis in the next few months.
 Restoration of labor discipline and civil calm
 appears to be the key to success at this time. Thus,
 Lisbon may be justified in putting off a sharp
 devaluation that would help the payments situa-
 tion because it could carry heavy costs in terms of
 worker discipline and the oooularity of non-com-
 munist governing parties.

 FRANCE: MORE SHIPS TO DJIBOUTI
 France is sending two more surface
 warships-a destroyer and a destroyer escort-to
 Djibouti, its naval base in the French Territory of
 the Afars and Issas. Although these ship
 movements appear to be part of a regular rotation
 of forces, and were almost certainly scheduled
 before the border incident last month between
 French and Somali troops, the French govern-
 ment has not discouraged reports that the
 transfers may be related to current tension in the
 area. Paris probably views the move as a con-
 venient way to underscore its determination to
 protect its interests there.
 The destroyer escort, now in the Red Sea, is
 scheduled to arrive in Djibouti late next week. It
 will reportedly replace another destroyer escort
 now in the area and will probably remain in the
 Indian Ocean for at least six months. The
 destroyer, according to French naval officers, will
 leave France later this month and should reach
 Djibouti in early April. This ship will probably
 become part of France's Indian Ocean task force,
 replacing two other surface vessels scheduled to
 depart in March.
 The French have the largest Western naval
 force in the Indian Ocean. France currently has
 18 ships assigned to its flotilla there, including a
 helicopter carrier, two submarines, a destroyer,
 three destroyer escorts, and a number of patrol
 and support craft. Most of these are now in the
 Djibouti area.
 USSR: FIRST NAVAL VISIT TO TURKEY
 The first known visit by Soviet naval ships to a
 Turkish port occurred last week. Two Moma-class
 naval hydrographic research ships arrived at An-
 talya in southern Turkey on February 23 and
 remained until February 28, when they resumed
 operations in the Mediterranean. US and other
 NATO military attaches in Turkey were apparently
 given no advance word of the port call.
 The visit underscores the Soviet navy's policy
 of showing the flag wherever possible around the
 Mediterranean. Soviet sailors aboard the two
 ships were not given shore leave, probably to
 avoid any incidents that would mar the port call.
 The visit of the Soviet ships appears to be part
 of a larger exchange between the USSR and
 Turkey. The port call followed by two months
 Soviet Premier Kosygin's trip to Turkey. Turkish
 officers-in accordance with the European securi-
 ty agreement signed in Helsinki-were invited to
 attend Soviet military maneuvers in the Caucasus
 earlier in February.
 Since late 1975 the Soviets have engaged in
 low-key efforts to exploit Turkish-US frictions.
 The Turks have been receptive to the Soviet over-
 tures, partly because of the growing acceptability
 of detente and partly because of a desire to re-
 mind the         it cannot take Turkey for
 granted.

 LEBANON: STILL SQUABBLING
 Lebanon's top political leaders have been un-
 able to agree on a new cabinet to carry out the
 package of political reforms announced last
 month, despite two weeks of intense bargaining
 and strong pressure from Syrian mediators. The
 stalemate on the political front and relatively
 minor but persistent security problems have con-
 vinced Damascus that it cannot withdraw Syrian-
 controlled Palestinian troops in Lebanon as early
 as originally planned.
 The extent of leftist participation in the new
 cabinet appears to be the major sticking point in
 the negotiations. Socialist leader Kamal Jumblatt,
 whose leftist coalition emerged from the recent
 fighting with new popular support, has been
 demanding that his more militant colleagues be
 included in the cabinet. Jumblatt apparently has
 received support for his position from Palestinian
 leaders, who would like to see their Lebanese
 allies gain a stronger voice in the government.
 The Christians, for their part, are deeply
 suspicious of the close ties between the
 Palestinians and the Lebanese far left and are con-
 cerned that Syria will eventually relax its efforts to
 keep both groups under control. The Christian
 position,  spearheaded  by  interior  Minister
 Shamun, has been that agreements governing
 Palestinian activities in Lebanon must be im-
 plemented before a new government is formed.
 The Syrians, increasingly frustrated by the
 seemingly boundless capacity of the Lebanese
 politicians to quarrel among themselves, are ap-
 parently determined to break the stalemate. After
 several stormy meetings in Damascus last week,
 Syria's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Khad-
 dam, reportedly pushed Jumblatt into a tentative
 agreement to serve on the cabinet and to scale
 down his demands on behalf of other leftist
 leaders. The Syrian mediator returned to Beirut
 on March 4, presumably to apply similar pressure
 to Christian Phalanges chief Pierre Jumayyil.
 Jumayyil and Jumblatt are leaders of the two
 strongest militias, and their participation in a
 coalition cabinet is considered crucial to the
 success of the recent peace settlement.
 Damascus seems less certain of how to stop a
 wave of kidnapings and other terrorist actions
 that has begun to undermine confidence in the
 In any event, the Syrians have decided that
 they cannot risk withdrawing Palestinian troops
 later this month as originally planned. Damascus
 apparently now sees the continued presence of
 these forces as the only way of keeping pressure
 on Christian and Muslim leaders to resolve their
 differences and of at least containing militant and
 lawless elements.

 ISRAEL: RABIN UNDER FIRE
 Dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Rabin's
 leadership of the country and the dominant Labor
 Party appears to be growing in Israel. In recent
 weeks, Rabin has drawn sharp criticism from both
 the conservatives and the moderates for his alleg-
 ed mishandling of a number of issues. Still, his
 government does not appear to be in imminent
 danger of falling, primarily because there is no
 clearly perceived or acceptable alternative.
 Rabin's leadership in economic affairs has
 come under repeated attack. Two key Finance
 Ministry officials recently resigned, charging that
 the government was giving inadequate support to
 measures to combat inflation and reduce the pre-
 sent balance-of-payments deficit. Their actions
 have heightened uncertainty and concern among
 Israelis over the government's ability to deal with
 the country's economic problems.
 Rabin faces another serious leadership
 problem in a political dispute stemming from an
 attempt by an Israeli group to establish an illegal
 Jewish settlement at Sebastia on the occupied
 West Bank last December. At that time, Rabin
 sought to avert violence by avoiding a final deci-
 sion on the settlement and by allowing some
 settlers to stay at a nearby army camp. He now
 faces a dilemma because the leftist Mapam, an
 important member of the ruling Labor Alignment,
 is insisting that the settlers be removed from the
 West Bank. Hard liners from the National
 Religious Party, a member of the government
 coalition, and other conservative groups are
 equally determined to establish a permanent
 settlement at Sebastia.
 Mutual wariness and underlying tension mar
 Rabin's relationship with Defense Minister Peres,
 the Prime Minister's strongest potential rival. A
 statement by Rabin during a background briefing
 for the press when he was in Washington last
 January that Israel's arms requests to the US
 government were "exaggerated" was interpreted
 by many in Israel as criticism of Peres. The episode
 inspired renewed speculation that Peres would
 resign and team up with the opposition Likud
 grouping to form an alternative coalition govern-
 ment.
 Peres, however, characterized this specula-
 tion as unfounded. He occupies a central position
 in deliberations on foreign policy and security
 decisions and as the leading cabinet conservative
 has the power to block developments he op-
 poses. For the time being, he probably sees his
 political future as best served by remaining within
 and not disrupting the Labor Party.
 In foreign policy, the cabinet's recent deci-
 sion to explore the prospects for agreements with
 Egypt, Jordan, and Syria on "terminating the state
 of war" has also focused new heat on Rabin. In
 addition to predictable criticism from right-wing
 factions, a number of moderate leaders of the rul-
 ing Labor Alignment, led by former foreign
 minister Abba Eban, strongly criticized the
 cabinet's move. These critics insisted that the next
 step in peace negotiations, particularly with Jor-
 dan, should be to obtain full-scale peace
 agreements. So far, however, Rabin has retained
 the support or at least acquiescence of almost the
 entire cabinet to explore the new negotiating op-
 tion.
 Rabin's relations within his Labor Party-the
 senior partner in the Labor Alignment-have also
 become increasingly troubled. He has been per-
 sistently criticized for failing to include the party
 in the decision-making process. The resignation
 last month of Meir Zarmi as the party's secretary
 general reflected frustration within the party's
 hierarchy over the failure of Rabin and other
 leaders in the government to coordinate and con-
 sult more fully with the party.
 Despite the drop in confidence in Rabin, the
 consensus in Labor Party circles remains that
 there is no present alternative to his leadership.
 Moreover, a leadership fight at this time might
 require elections before their scheduled date in
 late 1977, and few party leaders-certainly not
 Rabin-want that. The party is still recovering
 from the leadership crisis brought on by the 1973
 Arab-Israeli war. Rabin probably will attempt to
 defer the moment of reckoning within the party
 and between the Labor Alignment and Likud until
 1977.

 MOROCCO-ALGERIA: SAHARA DISPUTE
 Control of Western Sahara passed to Moroc-
 co and Mauritania last week in accordance with
 the tripartite accord signed by Madrid, Rabat, and
 Nouakchott last November. Algeria, which con-
 tinues to dispute the turnover by Madrid, did not
 challenge the event militarily. The Algerian-
 backed Polisario Front, which is waging a guerrilla
 conflict, countered politically by proclaiming the
 territory an independent Saharan "state."
 Algerian media have given major play to the
 Polisario proclamation on February 27 of a
 "Democratic Saharan Arab Republic." Polisario
 leaders claim to have made their declaration
 before a group of journalists and several thousand
 Saharans near a town in northeastern Sahara. The
 Front controls few if any towns and little other
 territory, however, and its "state" is in effect a
 government in exile.
 The Polisario move may have been in part a
 counter to Morocco's action the preceding day in
 engineering a vote by Sahara's territorial assembly
 endorsing the division of the territory between
 Morocco and Mauritania. Both Spain and the UN
 have rejected Morocco's claim that the assembly
 session constitutes the "consultations" with the
 Saharan people called for in the tripartite agree-
 ment and in the Moroccan-supported resolution
 on the issue adopted by the UN General
 Assembly last December. The Spanish and UN at-
 titudes may have given Algeria hope that it could
 advance its case for a UN-supervised referendum
 in Sahara by backing proclamation of a Polisario
 "state."
 Morocco initially betrayed some worry about
 the possible political repercussions of the
 Polisario move, but so far only two countries have
 formally recognized the new "state." This week
 the council of ministers of the 47-member
 io as either a government or a liberation

 sar
 o
 movement, although an informal count indicated
 that 16 states favored recognition. Without taking
 a formal vote, the council decided that recogni-
 tion should be left up to the individual states. The
 failure of the council to endorse the Polisario
 Front will be a disappointment to the Algerians,
 who had invested considerable political capital in
 an effort to gain it the trappings of legitimacy.
 Despite Moroccan nervousness about the
 possibility of increased Algerian and Polisario
 military activity following Spain's withdrawal from
 Sahara, only a few minor incidents have been
 noted. The US defense attache in Rabat believes,
 however, that the Moroccans may soon begin a
 new phase of military clean-up operations against
 the Polisario Front. Rabat hopes to eliminate the
 large number of guerrillas it believes are located
 in the Zemmour mountains around Guelta in
 Sahara and in the area north of Bir Moghrein in
 Mauritania. The Moroccans reportedly also are
 planning to clean out small pockets of guerrillas
 in southern Morocco as far east as the Algerian
 border.
 RHODESIA: BLEAK PROSPECTS
 Prospects for a settlement between
 Rhodesia's black nationalists and Ian Smith's
 white regime remain bleak. Despite some op-
 timistic press reports from Salisbury this week, the
 constitutional talks that have been going on since
 December apparently are going nowhere.
 Meanwhile, the nationalists' insurgency is grow-
 ing.
 Mozambique's President Machel announced
 on March 3 that he was imposing sanctions
 against the Smith regime by closing his country's
 border with Rhodesia. Machel said he was acting
 in response to attacks on Mozambique's territory
 by Rhodesian forces.

 activity in Rhodesia have been increasing in re-
 cent weeks. The insurgents still appear divided
 and probably are not ready for major operations
 in Rhodesia. There are indications, however, that
 they have begun moving into areas of southeast
 Rhodesia where they have not previously
 operated. Rhodesian security forces have reacted
 by pursuing guerrillas back into their sanctuaries
 in Mozambique; several minor clashes between
 Rhodesian and regular Mozambican forces ap-
 parently occurred recently.
 Although Machel may now step up his sup-
 port for the Rhodesian insurgents, he will
 probably avoid any direct role for his own armed
 forces. His government is already plagued with
 economic problems and tribal tensions, and the
 loss of revenue, unemployment, and food shor-
 tages in some areas that will follow the end of
 economic relations with Rhodesia will be a
 further blow to Mozambique's economy. Until
 this week, Machel had refused to impose sanc-
 tions on Rhodesia because he feared the
 economic consequences for Mozambique. He
 may believe the revenue loss can be made up
 through increased economic aid from outside
 donors, particularly Commonwealth countries,
 which last year promised to support him financial-
 ly if he imposed sanctions.
 Machel probably hopes his action will put
 enough pressure on Smith to force the latter to
 reach a negotiated settlement with the
 nationalists. Up to half of Rhodesia's foreign trade
 had been passing through Mozambique. The
 Rhodesians will try to make up as much of the loss
 as they can by channeling more of their trade
 through South Africa.
 Smith's talks with nationalist leader Joshua
 Nkomo have reached an impasse because Smith
 has rejected all proposals that would lead to black
 majority rule. The talks are continuing because
 neither side wants to be the one to break them
 off. Smith has consistently appeared to be chiefly
 interested in trying to buy time and keep the
 nationalists divided, in hopes of staving off a
 full-scale resumption of the guerrilla war and
 convincing South Africa of the need to support
 him. A high-level British envoy who visited
 Salisbury last week-before Machel's an-
 nouncement-found no evidence that Smith was
 ready to change his position.
 Zambia's President Kaunda, whose prestige is
 largely tied to the effort to reach a peaceful settle-
 ment of the Rhodesian problem, is becoming in-
 creasingly apprehensive about the Rhodesian
 situation. He is especially concerned about a
 possible fu       ban role in su  ort of the
 nationalists.
 At this time, any Cuban assistance
 to the Rhodesian guerrillas would probably be
 limited to providing arms and training.

 The Egyptian navy considers missile boats its
 top priority purchase, reflecting lessons learned
 during the war of October 1973. At that time,
 Israeli Saar-class boats equipped with Gabriel an-
 tiship missiles inflicted heavy losses on the Egyp-
 tians and Syrians. Cairo's current plans call for the
 purchase of nine boats with British-built hulls and
 French-Italian Otomat antiship missiles. These un-
 its will be equipped with advanced sensors, com-
 munications, and electronics equipment.
 Submarines are Cairo's-second priority. Three
 attack submarines and three smaller boats design-
 ed for special forces operations are expected to
 be purchased from the UK. Egypt is also
 negotiating for four new British multipurpose
 frigates with antisubmarine, air defense, and
 helicopter capabilities. Cairo would also like the
 British to re-equip six of Egypt's indigenously
 produced patrol boats.
 Cairo is already boosting its antisubmarine
 capability. The first flight crews have completed
 training on newly acquired Sea King antisub-
 marine warfare helicopters from the UK. Because
 the navy does not have an air arm, these aircraft
 will be land based and attached to the air force.
 Cairo also plans to procure frigates that will carry
 helicopters; these helicopters too will be flown by
 air force pilots. Past difficulties between the navy
 and air force suggest that Cairo may have difficul-
 ty obtaining the most effective use of the
 helicopters.
 All ship procurements appear to have been
 delayed by the need for a third-country payment
 guarantee. Funding for the naval craft will
 probably have to come from Arab states, par-
 ticularly Saudi Arabia.
 The Soviets have not signed a military agree-
 ment with Cairo since 1973. Major Soviet equip-
 ment deliveries to Egypt were suspended in
 mid-1975. The stalemate with Moscow has
 accelerated Cairo's contacts with Western sources
 for air, ground, and naval equipment. The transi-
 tion from communist to a mix of communist and
 Western military inventories will continue to im-
 pair Egypt's military readiness.

 LATIN AMERICA: KISSINGER VISIT
 Secretary Kissinger's trip to Brazil, Venezuela,
 Peru, Colombia, and Central America was clearly
 gratifying to the leaders and the people of the
 countries visited. Journalists and commentators,
 however, made the trip the occasion for an un-
 inhibited display of their analytical and rhetorical
 talents. Critics took the opportunity to rattle the
 skeletons from a closetful of real or imagined US
 sins against the area. Interpretations of what was
 actually said and done during the trip ranged
 from the very positive to the sinister. The highly
 developed skepticism toward US policy of Latins
 in general and Latin journalists in particular was
 revealed in the broad tendency to read between
 lines and to seek out the "real" meaning of what
 had occurred.
 Commentary weighed most heavily on two
 specific topics, the Cuba-Angola question and the
 US-Brazil accords. In general, however, the focus
 varied from country to country according to
 special interest and concern.
 Brazilian commentators savored their coun-
 try's enhanced status but worried about the effect
 on relations with other South American nations,
 which tend to be fearful of Brazil's strength. The
 press also issued warnings to the US that the trade
 imbalance must be corrected to remove serious
 bilateral frictions and that the US is not Brazil's
 only "option." Argentina, way behind in its com-
 petition with Brazil, reviewed in painful detail its
 internal problems and the diplomatic defeat it
 was dealt by Brazil's privileged partnership with
 the US. Venezuelan columnists generally
 deplored the Brazil-US "axis," but the premier
 business-oriented editorialist urged that "we
 other countries develop as much as Brazil." The
 Mexican press was clearly resentful and
 sometimes vitriolic in its attack on Brazil's
 preferred treatment.
 Numerous observers thought the key
 reason for the trip was to drum up Latin support
 for US punitive actions against Cuba for its role in
 Africa. This idea led in several directions, in-
 cluding the observation that the US "comes to
 get, not to give." Others took the stereotype of an
 interventionist US and drew irony from
 Washington's concern over Cuban interference
 in other countries. Another common criticism
 related to Latin America's hard-won solidarity,
 which the US allegedly was trying to break up by
 emphasizing bilateral over multilateral relations.
 The anti-communist editorialists had a special
 slant. They exemplified the cynicism with which
 many Latins greeted US promises not to be in-
 different about Cuban and communist advances.
 They expressed disillusion with Washington's
 leadership of the free world and with US exports
 of grain and technology to the USSR. Uruguay's
 leading daily commented that the US in its third
 century can become a paper tiger or assume its
 role as "guardian of the best values of humanity."
 The media notwithstanding, the countries
 visited were obviously pleased with a symbol of
 direct US attention. Commentary on the trip,
 while often critical, was heavily larded with ex-
 hortation that the US "follow through" with
 deeds. In this connection, the Costa Rican foreign
 minister announced that Latin America will ask
 the US for commercial treatment that would
 create special tariff preferences for the region.
 CANADA: NEW LEADER FOR TORIES
 The leadership of the opposition Progressive
 Conservative Party has been taken over by Joe
 Clark, member of Parliament from Alberta.

 former Tory leader Robert Stanfield's executive
 assistant from 1967 to 1970.
 Clark is opposed to capital punishment, sup-
 ports the idea of bilingualism, and advocates a
 limited reform of the abortion laws. On the
 economic front he favors wage and price con-
 trols, but only pn a temporary basis; curtailment
 of government spending, with welfare geared
 more stringently to need; limitation of the right of
 essential civil servants to strike; and decentraliza-
 tion of industry.
 Clark may be in good position to challenge
 Trudeau in the next elections, tentatively schedul-
 CI
 ed for 1978. Standing to the left of past Tory
 leaders, Clark can compete more effectively for
 the middle-of-the-road vote. 0 several    25X1
 ranking Liberals acknowledge that Clark is a most
 dangerous opponent.
 The first test of Clark's leadership abilities will
 come shortly, as he grapples with political and
 cultural divisions within the party. The Tories are
 split  between the rightist Diefenbaker-led
 Conservatives, who have dominated the party
 since the 1974 debacle, and the so-called "Red
 Tories," of whom Clark is a member. The party
 has been unable to establish itself securely in
 Quebec.

 Clark appears to have the political acumen to
 mend the Tory wounds. Energetic and engaging,
 Clark is a brilliant organizer. He has already
 begun the task of reconciliation, offering
 archrival Jack Horner a senior position in his
 shadow cabinet. Clark also appears sympathetic
 to the French cause, although this will not suffice
 to enable him to make inroads in Quebec.
 Clark received a cool reception after his con-
 vention victory from some of his rightist op-
 ponents. Defeated candidate Paul Hellyer, for ex-
 ample, did  not appear on stage for Clark's
 swearing-in ceremony. The majority of supporters
 of the Francophone candidate, Claude Wagner,
 left the convention hall before Clark gave his
 acceptance speech. Caught up in French resent-
 ment of Wagner's loss, the editor of the influen-
 tial Le Devoir suggested that the two Quebec can-
 didates were not given a fair chance.
 Even so, there are indications that the Tories
 may be ready to unite behind Clark. Several
 members of Parliament who opposed Clark, later
 indicated that they were ready to cooperate. A
 poll at the convention showed, moreover, that
 only 7 percent of the delegates felt there was an
 irreconcilable split in the party. Even the out-
 spoken editor of Le Devoir finally recanted and

 ARGENTINA: PERON PERSISTS
 The Peron administration's last-ditch efforts
 to win back disaffected labor and stave off a
 military coup appear to be having a measure of
 success.
 The government's recent announcement of a
 new economic package, including a three-month
 price freeze and a wage hike to offset the effects
 of rampaging inflation, has appeased at least some
 of President Peron's labor supporters, who only a
 few days ago were prepared to abandon the
 beleaguered President.
 As a price for continued support, labor
 leaders will demand a cabinet shuffle and the dis-
 missal of the small entourage of advisers around
 the President who have increasingly excluded
 labor from government decision-making.
 Presidential press secretary Julio Gonzalez,
 who has replaced Lopez Rega as the palace
 eminence grise, may be labor's chief target. Peron
 will probably agree to make cabinet changes
 because such action has bought her time before.
 The removal of Gonzalez is another matter.
 The President appears incapable of func-
 tioning without a close adviser. Gonzalez, as a
 former protege of Lopez Rega, undoubtedly
 provides her the psychological strength she needs
 to hold on to the presidency. If his departure is
 the price she must pay for labor's backing, she
 may find that backing not worth the price.
 In the meantime, efforts by several legislators
 to convoke a special joint session of congress to
 declare Peron unfit for office have bogged down
 in legal and constitutional red tape. At midweek
 Senate President Luder announced that the call
 for an "eventual" joint session was still under
 study.
 The effect of these developments on the arm-
 ed forces' preparations to take over the govern-
 ment is problematical. The generals' slim hopes
 that congress would spare them the necessity of
 moving against Peron cannot have been
 strengthened by Luder's temporizing, but some
 of them, at least, will seize on the prospect of a
 labor-dictated cabinet shuffle to counsel post-
 onement  of  military  intervention.
 JAMAICA: GLOOMY ECONOMIC PICTURE
 Jamaica has been particularly hard hit by the
 world-wide recession. While export and service
 revenues declined in 1975, imports were up
 sharply, resulting in a record $245-million
 current-account deficit. Unable to arrange com-
 plete financing, Kingston had to draw on its
 foreign reserves, which fell by $88 million to $63
 million net at the end of the year. Unemployment
 rose to about 23 percent and prices increased 18
 percent. Despite a large increase in public expen-
 ditures aimed at taking up the slack in the
 economy, real gross national product declined by
 at least 1 percent for the year.
 Sagging world demand, increasing labor
 problems, and the adverse effects of the new
 bauxite tax caused bauxite and alumina export
 earnings-normally accounting for three quarters
 of exports-to fall by about 20 percent last year.
 The bauxite levy, established in mid-1974, re-
 quires the Jamaican producers to pay Kingston 8
 percent of the final sales price of aluminum in-
 gots. The regulation also requires the companies
 to pay the tax based on installed capacity in 1973,
 regardless of the level of production. Revere's
 alumina plant has been closed since September
 because of a dispute over the levy.

 Tourism, long Jamaica's second most impor-
 tant source of foreign exchange, fell by more than
 10 percent in 1975, causing a large number of
 hotel closures. The current-account deficit would
 have been much worse had not sugar earnings
 doubled under the impetus of high world prices
 and a good harvest.
 To stem the decline in production and
 employment, the government used the proceeds
 of the bauxite levy, which totaled $170 million in
 1975, to finance urban public works. The program
 helped to bolster consumer incomes; it also near-
 ly exhausted government financial resources and
 was only marginally effective in reducing un-
 employment. Moreover, by stimulating migration
 to the cities, the program helped to intensify ur-
 ban congestion.
 The economic outlook this year is hardly less
 bleak. Lower world sugar prices and an 8-percent
 drought-induced drop in production will reduce
 sugar earnings by at least 50 percent. The outlook
 for recovery of bauxite and alumina sales is cloud-
 ed by deteriorating labor relations, political strife,
 and continued low world demand.
 Earnings from tourism will fall again by 10
 percent or more. Violence in Kingston at the time
 of the International Monetary Fund World
 Conference in January caused widespread tourist
 cancellations. In fact, Pan American Airways has
 requested permission to suspend air service to
 Jamaica for 21  months beginning in  March
 because it expects continued weak demand from
 American tourists.
 Kingston will probably devalue the Jamaican
 dollar in the next few months to stimulate ex-
 ports, but little improvement in the trade and
 payments situation can be expected until the US
 economic recovery picks up later in the year.
 Foreign payments problems will preclude im-
 provement in the domestic economic situation.
 Investor uncertainty will continue to deter an up-
 swing in private investment. Although Kingston is
 expected to maintain expenditures for public
 works, unemployment will likely rise further and
 income will continue to fall.
 Although Prime Minister Manley intends to
 continue the policy of Jamaicanization, financial
 constraints will slow extension of Jamaican con-
 trol over key foreign-owned economic entities
 this year. In the bauxite industry, Kingston reach-
 ed preliminary agreements for new operating
 contracts with three of Jamaica's six international
 aluminum  companies  in  early 1975. These
 agreements included the companies' acceptance
 in principle of both the new bauxite tax and even-
 tual purchase by the government of a 51-percent
 equity. Signing of the agreements has been stalled
 by labor strife and disputes over the size of com-
 pany tax liabilities in the wake of the production
 cutbacks. Strained government finances this year
 will prevent government purchase of even a small
 share in the $1-billion bauxite industry, and
 Manley will almost certainly avoid expropriation
 since it would have harsh effects on exports and
 the availability of foreign financing. This year,
 Kingston will have its hands full in merely collec-
 ting the new tax.

 CHILE: REASSESSING OPTIONS
 Recent reverses,  internationally and
 domestically, are causing the Pinochet govern-

 Another strongly worded condemnation by
 the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva and
 US Senate action to cut off military sales and
 deliveries have apparently caused Chile's ruling
 generals to examine what steps can be taken to

 neighbor's weakened position.
 Some junta members and government ad-
 visers are urging Pinochet to set a date for the ter-
 mination of military rule, but this is unlikely. At
 most, Pinochet will probably press for early com-
 pletion of the new constitution that is now being
 drafted. This would presumably give him a chance
 to hold a referendum and possibly point to it as
 evidence of a popular mandate.
 There are pressures from some officials for
 substantial changes in the economic austerity
 program, but the most likely outlook is for a few
 minor modifications. The junta's basic policies
 will probably remain intact, which strongly
 suggests that Chileans will face more sacrifices
 and hardships as winter approaches. The prospect
 of continued depressed prices for copper also
 dims the chances for a change in the junta's
 economic fortunes.
 The most urgent problem facing the regime is
 to correct some of the causes of foreign criticism
 of human rights practices, since this has slowed
 the flow of funds needed for economic recovery.
 Too often in the past the government has
 declared its intention to move toward less
 repressive rule only to have its guidelines ignored
 by security forces. If Pinochet has now decided
 that stricter restraints and compliance with ex-
 isting regulations must be enforced, there may be
 a gradual improvement of internal security
 procedures.
 An overriding factor in the minds of Presi-
 dent Pinochet and his junta colleagues in con-
 sidering a modification of present policies is the
 impact that US action on military aid will have on
 relations with Peru, which is militarily stronger.
 The termination of all US assistance to the Chilean
 armed forces would deepen the generals' fears
 that Peru is ready to take advantage of its

 CHINA: MOUNT N ATTACKS ON TENG
 The attacks on Teng Hsiao-ping continue to
 escalate and, after a slow start in the provinces,
 have gathered momentum throughout the coun-
 try. The campaign has thus far stopped short of its
 final step-a call for and subsequent announce-
 ment of his ouster. This would suggest that Teng's
 removal is at least as divisive an issue as was his
 return from political disgrace nearly three years
 ago. Nevertheless, more moderate elements in
 the leadership have not been able to slow the at-
 tacks on him, mute public criticism of him, or
 mount a public defense of Teng and his policies.
 Teng is the only member of the Politburo's
 elite Standing Committee who has not appeared
 in public since Chou En-Tai's funeral in
 mid-January. No one in the leadership has
 appeared regularly, but the party's left wing,
 which is leading the attack on Teng, has
 monopolized the public limelight. Those leaders
 who are most likely to support Teng and his
 policies have made few or no public appearances.
 Chinese officials have made conflicting
 statements as to whether Teng still holds his im-
 portant party, government, and military positions.
 A Chinese official responded on March 3 with a
 "no comment" when asked to confirm rumors
 that Teng had resigned. Even if Teng retains his
 titles, there is no evidence that he has exercized

 any authority since January 24, well before the
 current round of attacks on him began. If the
 moderates fail to defend Teng publicly in the
 face of the strong leftist attack, he probably
 ultimately will have to give up his highest-
 ranking positions as party vice chairman and
 member of the Politburo Standing Committee.
 Should his opposition fall short of purging him,
 it is probable that at best Teng could hang on as
 an ordinary member of the Politburo. Teng's
 position as PLA chief of staff is also in doubt.
 The criticism of Teng became more pointed
 when People's Daily ran an article on February 29
 attacking an individual "'capitalist roader" and
 citing one of Teng's well-known statements, thus
 leaving no doubt who the target is. This formula-
 tion has been picked up by several provincial
 radios. Wall posters attacking Teng by name have
 appeared in factories and schools in Peking and
 are on public display in the streets in some
 provinces. Posters on the streets of Peking do not
 use Teng's name, and one observer who visited
 several other cities saw no sign of poster activity,
 indicating that the poster attack is not yet univer-
 sal. One Chinese official noted that Kwangtung
 Province is following Peking's instructions on the
 criticism campaign "but very slowly." The head of
 that province is an associate of Teng's and
 reportedly is maintaining a neutral stance.

 `'W          SECRET              NWO
 The media attacks on Teng have become in-
 creasingly harsh, criticizing his behavior before,
 during, and since the Cultural Revolution. An ar-
 ticle in the current issue of Red Flag, the party
 theoretical journal, accuses Teng of refusing to
 watch performances of the "model" plays
 produced under the guidance of Mao's wife,
 Chiang Ching. The article was written by Chu Lan,
 a pseudonym for someone who is either Chiang
 Ching or a spokesman for her. This indicates that
 Chiang Ching, who was in relative eclipse last
 year, is once again on the political offensive and
 an active member of the group working to oust
 Teng.
 A particularly hard-hitting article in People's
 Daily on March 3, implying that Teng has never in
 fact been a communist, read as though it were
 calling for his ouster-until the final paragraph. It
 ended on a strangely mild note, saying he should
 get "another hard slap and see how he will
 behave in the future." This leaves open the
 possibility that both sides could claim victory
 through some form of recantation on Teng's part.
 As an indication of how controversial a public
 call for Teng's ouster is at the moment, the article
 quoted a statement from the Cultural
 Revolution-"No matter how high a position he is
 in...we should overthrow him"-but pointedly
 substituted "criticize" for the word "overthrow."
 The political left clearly intends to have Teng
 ousted, but backstage conflict within the
 leadership has thus far prevented the left from
 publicly stating its intention.
 AUSTRALIA: LABOR PARTY SCANDAL
 Former prime minister Whitlam's efforts to
 get foreign contributions for the Labor Party cam-
 paign in last December's elections may cost him
 his leadership of the party.
 The Australian press has charged that
 Whitlam and the party secretary met with two
 Iraqi diplomats just before the elections to discuss
 a $500,000 contribution in return for Labor's tak-
 ing a pro-Arab position on foreign policy
 questions. Whitlam admits meeting the Iraqis but
 denies that he discussed money. Labor Party of-
 ficials           admit, however, that the
 newspaper stories are essentially correct.
 Whitlam was reconfirmed as party leader in
 late January, in spite of efforts to make him a
 scapegoat for Labor's disastrous defeat in the
 December elections. Many who backed Whitlam
 in his leadership fight in January now believe he is
 guilty of wrongdoing in the contributions
 episode.
 Most leftists relish the opportunity to dump
 the former prime minister. A few, from the party's
 fractious Victoria state organization that normally
 opposes Whitlam, are backing him only because
 they invited the Iraqis to Australia. The leftists'
 standing in party councils was strengthened by
 the defeat of any middle-of-the-roaders in the
 December elections.
 Facing the prospect that Whitlam may be
 sacked by the Labor Party's executive council on
 March 5, some Laborites have become concerned
 over the lack of a replacement of adequate
 stature. One rumored successor is Kim Beazley, a
 respected middle-of-the-roader who has taken
 positions in recent weeks to the liking of the lef-
 tists. His accession to office would probably give
 new impetus to a leftward drift in the party at least
 initially. Another possibility, William Hayden, is
 seen by some of his colleagues as not sufficiently
 self-confident for the demanding leadership posi-
 tion, and his chances have been hurt by Whitlam's
 endorsement. Thomas Uren, a third possibility, is
 probably too closely identified with the party's
 left wing to be accepted by the entire
 membership. The charges about the con-
 tributions have added to strains within Labor
 ranks caused by the party's election rout, and any
 new leader would face increased difficulties in
 holding Labor's parliamentary group together.
 The scandals that cropped up during the
 Labor government's three-year  tenure con-
 tributed to its defeat in December. Whitlam's
 removal for malfeasance would further reduce
 the party's chances of making a comeback in
 coming state elections.
