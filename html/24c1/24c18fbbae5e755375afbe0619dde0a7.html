 For a while last week, it looked as though
 the deathwatch over ailing Peen-,ier Chou En-lai
 had begun, but press speculation proved to be a
 false alarm. Chows physical condition is report-
 edly worse than it was last July, when he received
 Senator Henry Jackson in a hospital room. Later
 Rumors that ~hou's health had taken a sud-
 den turn for the worse were sparked by inac-
 curate  press  reports that several  high  ranking
 Chinese officials had been abruptly called away
 from a banquet given by the visiting US congres-
 sional delegation. In fact, the two relatively low-
 level officials who left the banquet had explained
 in advance that they would be agile to stay only
 long ~anough tr; greet their hosts.
 Both  officials--one  ~s  reputedly  Mao's
 niece-=eem to Have frequent and ready access to
 the Chairman. It a possible that their brief ap-
 pearan~e at the banquet, excused on the grounds
 of prior official commitments, was related to a 25X6
 meeting with Mao. The Chairman has been vaca-
 tioning at a resort area outside Peking. Although
 he usually  receivers  foreign  visitors it  his own
 residence, his meeting last week with the visiting
 Togolsase President was not said to have taken
 place  at  his  re:~idc~nce,  and  it  appeared  from
 photographs to have been held at another site.
 Meanwhile,  vice  premiers  Teng Hsiao-ping
 and L_i Hsien-Wien continue to divide representa-
 tional duties in Chou's absence. Both have re-
 cently played host to visiting heads of state and
 have stated explici*.ly that they were acting on
 Chows behalf. The Premier's wife, who herself
 Chou En-lai ano others leave re:cept.im~ in Aiis;ust

 has been ailing for se~~pral years, has also Veen on
 hand to greet the visir~rs.
 Chinese  media  continue  to  keep  Chola's
 name before the public in an apparent effort to
 convey the impression that the Premier 's still
 functioning and, more  importantly, to forestall
 STRENGTHENING THE SOUTH SEA FLEET
 As part of a broader attempt to improve the
 capabilities of its South Sep Fleet, Peking may
 have permanently reassigned the three East Sea
 Fleet Riga-class destroyer escorts it sent south last
 January. The ships passed through the Taiwan
 Strait  at  the  time  the  Chinese  occupied  the
 Paracel Islands. Their prolonged stay in the south
 suggests that their presence is no longer solely
 related to supporting Chinese operations in the
 islands.
 The  Chinese have  relaxed their defensive
 posture in the Paracels, but they are still showing
 interest  in  strengthening  the  southern  fleet.
 Eefore the arrival of the Rigas, the only major
 surface unit equipped with guided missiles in the
 South  Sea  Fleet  Wl~  l I  I1tA_('~:a cc nine+rnvor~
 rengthening  the  South  Sea  Fleet  would
 facilitate Chinese operations in the South China
 Sea. Petrolum deposits are believed to exist in the
 area, and this strengthening of the fleet may be
 designed to buttress Peking's claim to them. The
 navy has so far confined its activity primarily to
 coastal waters.
 The Chinese are producing aboat 3~J guided-
 missile patrol boats a year and are stationing more
 missile boats along the entire coast i~lcluding the
 northern entrance to the Taiwan Strait. The Osa
 boats near the strait will not only help to keep
 open access to the South Sea ~=1eet but will also
 serve to offset the guided-missile firepovver lost
 when the Three Rigas were sent sou'~h. Peking h`25X1

 South Vietnarn
 FIGHTINf; MAY GET IiEAVIER
 Fighting continues to be brisk in the nurt;i-
 err, provinces, but has slackened off in the south.
 Communist forces have not s~tempted to make a
 major pusf'r against the former imperial capital of
 iue,  but  they have forced the government to
 withdraw  from positions south of the city that
 were close to populated areas and Route 1. On
 two  occasions,  North  Vietnamese  troops have
 temporarily  interdicted  Route  1  between  Da
 Nang and Hue, demonstrating their potential for
 disrupting I- ~d resupply of government forces in
 the north in fhe event of heavier action.
 A more interesting development,  involving
 main forces on both sides, could be shaping up
 near the former district capital of Thuong Duc in
 Quang Nam  Province. The  First Brigade of the
 government's crack Airborne Division has been
 cautiously preparing to retake this district town,
 which was captured by the Communists this sum-
 mer.  The government forces have been moving
 slowly to contro; the high ground before mount-
 ing an assault on the town, whir_h lies at the head
 of a valley.

 the morale of other South Vietnames

 eavy casualties in fi
 hti
 d
 g
 ng
 uring the past 'two
 weeks in southern Thua Thien Province. Two of
 its regiments are now said to be "almost combat
 ineffective."  If both the 1st and Airborne n;vi-
 sions sustain  substantial losses, this would con-
 stitute aserious setback for th~a government.
 25X1
 Positional battles such as the one that may
 be developing around Thuong Duc have become
 increasingly  characteristic of the war since the
 first of the year. In the past, South Vietnamese
 counterattacks usually quickly forced Communist
 forces from towns they had captured. Now, the
 Communists have the advantage of a logistic net-
 work developed since the cease-fire, which pro-
 vides them with the maneuver and supply capa-
 bility to defend some of the positions they have
 captured. Also, recent reductions in the amount
 of ammunition and air support provided to gov-
 ernment infantry forces will further restrict South
 Vietnamese efforts.
 The Communists would like to inflict a sub-
 stantial defeat on the crack First Airborne Bri-

 JAPAN -SOUTH KOREA: CRISIS WORSENS
 The crisis in South Korean -Japanese rela-
 tions deepened this week when Seoul rejected a
 draft  of  a personal letter from Prime  Minister
 Tanaka to President Pak Chong-hui. The Sou#h
 Koreans  are  pressing  Tokyo  hard  to  assume
 explicit responsibility for the incident last month
 when a Korean from Japan killed Pak's wife and,
 further, to agree publicly to take strong measures
 against anti-Pak activists in Japan. These demands
 have been  accompanied  by large anti-Japanese
 demonstrations,  including the partial ransackin
 cf
 Tanaka's draft, which the Japanese agreed to
 send via atop-level envoy to Seoul, refer~~ad to
 the question  of  "moral  responsibility" fair the
 August ircide~.t and promised efforts to prevent
 further plotting against South Korea from Japan.
 The Japanese maintain that it is their final offer.
 Seoul  has  countered  that  the  letter  is
 "obscure" and "too weak."  If Tokyo will  not
 reconsider, the South Koreans warn that they are
 prepared to recall their ambassador to Tokyo and
 issue an ultimatum.
 President Pak is taking an extremely hard
 line, especially on the need for a crackdown on
 Chosen Soren, the association of pro-Pyongyang
 Koreans in Japan, in order to:
 ? put the organization on the defensive,
 and reinforce his claim that opposition to his
 regime is inspired by outside elements,
 ? divert attention  from his own domestic
 troubles,
 ? and  perhaps  most  important  in  the
 longer term, cause bad blood between Japan
 and North Korea, as Chosen Soren is an in-
 strument of the Pyongyang regime. Pak may
 believe that this would deflect any possible
 Japanese move 'award a more neutral posi-
 tion between the two Koreas.
 Suspicions about Tokyo's motives, as well as
 more emotional anti-Japanese sentiment, were no
 doubt  heightened  by what Seoul  regarded as a
 callous initial reaction in Tokyo to the assassina-
 tion  incident.  While Se~~ul was accusing Nortli
 Korea  of having a hand  in the affair, Japanese
 officials made a number of ill-timed public state-
 ments, such as that of Foreign Minister Kimura
 discounting the "threat from the  North." This
 statement-when qualified as ;t later was--did not
 deviate from established Japanese policy, but it
 appeared in Seoul to reflect at best insensitivity
 to South Korean interests, and perhaps deliberate
 attempts by Tokyo to put some distance between
 itself and the Pak regime. 25X1     25X1
 25X1
 the Japanese
 have Keen considering a minor improvement in
 ties with No!?th Korea later this year s~:ch as the
 exchange of trade missions, but thai the current
 tension between Tokyo and Seoul has caused this
 to be deferred. Pak's diplomatic pressurz against
 Tokyo has been far from an unqua'ified success,
 however.  As  the  crisis  deepened  this  week,
 Japanese diplomats began privately discussing the
 possibility of economic sanctions against South
 Korea and the need to reconsider their support of
 Seoul's  position  when  the  Korean  question  is
 debated  in the UN General Assembly this fall.
 The immediate interest of the Tanaka government
 throughout the recent crisis seems to have been to
 prevent the matter from eroding the Prime Min-
 ister's narrow margin of political support at home
 and to keep diplomatic options open on matters
 pertaining to the two Koreas.
 Even if the immediate impasse is resolved,
 Seoul-Tokyo difficulties will continue since they
 are part of a continuing process of adjustment by
 two  close  allies  of  the  United States to the
 changing  environment  in  East  Asia.  To some
 extent, the events reflect South Korean fears of
 abandonment in an era of detente and, in Tokyo,
 Japan's  increasingly ambivalent attitude toward
 the  South  in  its  competition  wit?  the

 NEW ZEALAND: NEW LEADERSHIP
 The  New  Zealand  Labor  Party's selection
 last week of Wallace Rowling as prime minister
 will ease the party's feeling of being cast adrift by
 the sudden end of Norman Kirk's ten-year domi-
 nance.  Rowling  is  intelligent and capable, and
 projects confidence-gpalities that will stand him
 in good stead in filling the leadership gap left by
 Kirk's  unexpected  death.  .As  a  conservative
 Laborite, Rowling did not have trada union back-
 ing for the prime ministership, but he is never-
 theless widely accepted in the party, which will
 help him to consolidate his hold.
 Rowling will be a strong standard-bearer in
 the general election that the party anticipates is
 still over a year away. A seasoned and wily poli-
 tician, he is probably the Laborite most able to
 match the aggressive style of  Robert Muldoon,
 the new head of the opposition National Party.
 The opposition already looks like it is campaign-
 ing, even though-in view of Labor s stronS ;,old
 on  parliament-it  has no hope of forcing early
 elections.
 Rowling  has been friendly toward the US.
 He recently  signaled  his  interest in maintaining
 New Zealand's cordial relationship with the US
 by giving first place to the US ambassador in the
 courtesy calls normally tendered a new head of
 government.  Rowling's  only  stand  that  might
 affect US interests has been his advocacy of strict
 controls  on  investment  in  New  Zealand  by
 multinational companies. The new Prime Minister
 has no record in foreign policy, but his decision
 to handle foreign affairs himself was intended '.o
 demonstrate that there mill be no break with the
 Kirk gc.~vernment's policies.
 Tt~e selection of leftist-leaning Robert Tizard
 as deputy  prime minister strikes an  ideological
 balance  to  Rowling  that  is  important  in  the
 diverse Labor Party. Tizard held the health and
 public  service  portfolios  under Kirk, and  his
 handling o. these two important jobs established
 his reputation in new Zealand's welfare-oriented
 government.  In  the new administration,  Tizard
 takes over  Rowling's old  joy a:  minister  of fi-
 nance.

 MOZAMBIQUE: INDEPENDENCE SET
 Lisbon and the black insurgent '~ront for the
 Liberation of Mozambique signed an    reement in
 Lusaka, Zambia, last weekend providing for the
 independence of Mozambique next June and the
 immediate installation of a joint Front-Portuguese
 transitional government. The signing provoked a
 short-lived rebellion by dissident whites demand-
 ing that all of Mozambique's political groups be
 represented in the interim regime.
 The dissidents seized two radio stations in
 Lourenco Marques and temporarily occupied the
 airport. Although Lisbon ordered reinforcements
 from northern Mozambique into the capital, mili-
 tary forces acted with restraint in order to avoid
 violence. Nevertheless, demonstrations both sup-
 porting and opposing the rebellion brcke out in
 Lourenco ('Jlarques and in the port city of Beira
 during which as many as 100 persons were killed
 or injured. The white dissidents finally agreed to
 give up in order to avoid further bloodshed. The
 rebellion sparked a black backlash in the suburbs
 of Lourenco Marques, where it was interpreted as
 an attempt by white separatists to seizE control of
 the government. Local authorities in Lourenco
 Marques declared martial law in order to stem a
 wave of vandalism, looting, and arson.
 Discouraging protest
 During  their  incipient  rebellion, the dissi-
 dents met with two special representatives sent by
 President  Spinola  to  hear  their grievances. Al-
 though they may havE .eceived some encourage-
 ment that their demands would be considered by
 Lisbon,  it seems unlikely that  they gained any
 concessions. Lisbon cannot revoke its agreement
 with the  Front, and the  Front is not likely to
 consider  modifying  the agreement to allow its
 political  enemies  a  role  in  the  transitional
 government.
 The  dissidents  were  able to publicize  the
 unrepresentative  nature  of  the  interim  govern-
 ment, however, and it appears that their action
 attracted considerable sympathy,  if  little active
 backing, from numerous political organizations in
 the  territory.  These organizations-made up of
 whites, blacks, and mulattoes-adamantly oppose
 a  Front "take-over" and may be encouraged to
 make another attempt to derail the transitional
 government.
 The transitional pericJ  legally took effect
 upon 'the  signing  of the Lusaka  agreement  on
 September 7. Front officials announced on Sep-
 tember 9 that they will be ready to ~r~ove into
 Lourenco (~1arques next week to begin setting up
 the transitional government. Under terms of the
 agreement, the Front will appoint a prime minis-
 ter and two thirds of anine-member cabinet. The
 Portuguese will  be represented  by a  high co~,ii-
 mi~sioner  and  the  remaining cabinet membo?s.
 The two sides will establish a joint military coi~n-
 mission, with equal representation, to deal with
 security problems.  The  Front,  with only about
 3,000  armed troops, would  be hard-pressed  to
 quell  any  disorders  without  active  Portuguese
 assistance.

 Even without further dissidence, the transi-
 tional  government  faces a broad array of prob-
 lems.  Front  leaders  have  been  living  in  exile
 throughout  their  insurgency  and  are  not  ac-
 quainted with  the complex economic structure
 and social naeds of Mozambique. For some time
 to come, they will need to rely heavily on Portu-
 to assume full  power next June.

 EGYPT: NUDGING THE PLO
 In  an  effort to  bring the Palestinians to a
 long-delayed  decision  to commit thernselves to
 peace negotiations in concert with Jordan, Presi-
 der?~t Sadat has adopted atwo-pronged approach
 with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
 The  Egyptians are vigorously supporting a
 PLO-initiated  strategy  to  bring  the  Palestinian
 problem to :~.reater world attention by raising the
 issue as an agenda item at the UN General As-
 sembly  session  that  begins next week.  Hoping
 that this backing will convince the PLO of con-
 tinued `gyptian support for Palestinian interests
 in later peace talks, Cairo is pressing a harder line
 in private councils. TFre Egyptians have made it
 clear that their patience with PLO indecision and
 delay is wearing thin, and they have threatened to
 leave the Palestinians to their own devices in the
 peace  settlemeirt  process  unless the PLO soon
 moves toward an understanding with Jordan.
 At the UN, the PLO is seeking tyre ricP.t to
 address the General Assembly, as well as ..  ~solu-
 tion  focusing  on  the  Palestinian  situation  as a
 separate  political  issue  rather than as a refugee
 problem  solely of humanitarian concern.  Presi-
 dent Sadat apparently sees support for the PLO's
 UN effort as a relatively painless tradeoff for his
 demand that the organization acquiesce, as Sadat
 has done, in Jordan's right to negotiate for the
 return of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
 Although the Arabs have not yet developed
 their UN strategy, the broad outlines set out in a
 staternent of policy by the Arab League last v~~eek
 envision  a  UN  resciuticn confirming the basic
 political  rights  of  the  Palestinian  people,  par-
 ticularly  that  of  self-determination.  From  the
 Egyptian  viewpoint,  the  promise  of  self-deter-
 mination, backed by the UN assembly, would give
 the  Palestinians  hope  of  establishing  a  future
 separate sta?e on the West Bank after Jordanian-
 Israeli negotiations for the territory.
 Sadat  is undoubtedly counting on  this to
 ease Palestinian inhibitions about participating in
 those negotiations, as an interested party if not
 Sadat and Arafat
 initially as a principal. The Egyptians have started
 canvassing for support of the resolution from key
 UN members.             25X1
 The Egyptian-Syrian-PLO meeting has been
 scheduled and  rescheduled repeatedly over the
 past  two  mo~~ths  hecause  of  the  Palestinians'
 refusal  to attend. Cairo may not carry through
 with its threat, but it probably calculates that the
 fear of being abandoned will be sufficient to bring
 a  reluctant  PLO  around.  So  far,  this has not
 proved  true;  the  PLO reportedly reiterated its
 refusal to attend the meeting during an executive
 committee  session  early  this  week. ~

 IR/~N-IRAQ: THE KURt~ISH PROBLEM
 The ground and air offensive that began last
 month  has dealt a serious blow to the  rebel
 Kurdish  forces. The  Iraqi  army's deep penetra-
 tions into Kurdish-held territory have prompted
 increased intervention by Iran.
 Iraq  has  now  committed  over half  of  its
 army to the campaign against the Kurds. This
 force, numbering over 50,000 men, is driving to-
 ward two major objectives: to split the Kurdish
 for:.e.; so that they can be dealt with piecemeal,
 and to cut off supplies from Iran.
 Despite  recent  setbacks,  Kurdish  morale
 appears good. There are more volunteers ready to
 join u  than there                   ply them.
 the rebels
 are  more  uni ~ed tnan  ever;  large  numbers of
 jucated Kurds, who in the past have been coo!
 to  Barzani's  conservative  leadership,  now  are
 reported to be joining the rebel forces. Even with
 poor equipment, the Kurds are likely to fight on.
 They  fought the last war against the Iraqis in
 1970 despite severe supply deficiencies.
 Last month, the Iraqis drove a wedgy be-
 tween Kurdish units in the north and those in the
 northeast by seizing Rawanduz, some 25 miles
 from AI Hajj Umran, the headquarters of Kurdish
 rebel  leader Mulla PJlustapha Barzani.  in a drive
 from As Sulaymaniyah, the Iraqis also took Qalat
 Dizah as part of their apparent strategy to estab-
 lish afortified line parallel to the Iranian border.
 ~fhe  Kurds' strategy  recently has been to
 stage  delaying  actions  along  the  front  while

 maintaining a series of harassing attacks in the
 rear of  the main  battle areas. Kurdish guerrilla
 actions behind the lines are intended to disperse
 the Iraqi forces.
 For some time, Iran has provided the Kurds
 with equipment, munitions, any military advisers.
 Tehran also provides food, r,-redicine, and money,
 and maintains refugee camps for Kurds who flee
 the  fighting.  The  Iranians  admit  only  their
 humanitarian aid, claiming that current fighting
 has  pushed the  refugee  total  to  over  7C,000.
 Iraq's recent successes have prompted the Kurds
 to  ask  for  increased  support,  and  Tehran has
 made a positive but limited response.
 25X1
 Unless the Shah reverses himself, the likeli-
 hood  of  direct  clashes  between  I ~~q and  Iran
 increases as Baghdad's troops push closer to the
 border. The Shah may deepen Iran's involvement
 if he ~~oncludes that this is the only alternative to
 a crushing defeat of the Kurds. Bari ing a sudden
 collapse  of the Kurdish  resistance,  Iran's most
 likely  course is to  intensi`y what  it  is already

 doing, particularly with  regard to artillery sup-
 port. The Iraqi bombing on September 6 of two
 Iranian villages near Piran Shahr-the main su;~ply
 depot for the Kurds-prompted Teleran to lodge a
 protest  at the  UN.  It  could  also  be  used  by
 Tehran  to  justify  launching  a  limited military
 action along the border.
 open  intervention  in  strength  by  Iranian
 ground  forces seems unlikely, however, as this
 would force Arab governments to choose between
 Iran-a fellow Arab state-and  Iran. Moreover,
 Iran has been making efforts to strengthen ties
 with  neighbors  who  already  are  apprehensive
 about its growing military power.
 Who's for Rapprochement?
 The  Shah  believes  his  interests  are  Nell
 served  by  Baghdad's  preoccupation  with  ?he
 Kurdish problem and by  Iraq's isolation in  tide
 Arab worlc+. He therefore wishes to keep Kurdish
 resistance  alive,  and  shows  little  interest  in  a
 rapprochement with Iraq. The Iranians believe the
 greatest threat to their goals in the Persian gulf is
 the ryrowth ~f radicalis,n, and Iraq is seen as its
 chief sponsor.
 Iraq, on the other hand, is under pressure
 from  several  Arab  countries  to  seek  an  ac-
 commodation  with  Iran  as  a  prerequisite  for
 resolving the Kurdish problem. There have been
 some  signs  over recent months that the  Iraqis
 were seeking an understanding with Iran. Baghdad
 took the lead, for example, in starting preliminary
 bila':eral talks in Istanbul last month on a range of
 outstanding issues, including border demarcation.
 After two weeks, the talks r: nded ir,ronclusively,
 but the Iraqis are trying tc~ get the Iranians to
 resume the discussions at the foreign ministers'
 level  later  this  montl,  at  the  UN  General
 Assembly.
 The  Iraqi  air strike  near Piran Shahr was
 apparently intended in pars as a warning to the
 Shah not to step up deliveries of military equip-
 ment io the Kurds or to increase the involvement
 of the Iranian army on the side of the rebels. The
 1; agis, however, are aware of the risks involved in
 carrying out air strik~;s against Iranian territory.
 With a large par` of their ground forces tied down
 against  the  Kurds,  the  Iraqis  are  not  able  to
 engage in major ground actions against Iran and
 will seek to avoid a confrontation.
 Implications for Iraq
 The  unending  war  with  the  Kurds  cculd
 become an increasingly onerous political liability
 for the regime.  If the err-.y gets bogged down
 later  this year, there could  be an  open  power
 struggle at the top between President Bakr and
 Beath party strong man Tikriti, who have been at
 odds for some time. When the fighting began in
 March, Tikriti put his reputation on ~;~e line by
 promisi;~g the Beath party that the vvar would be
 over  in  September.  Nevertheless,  his  position
 remains  strong;  he  controls  the party security
 apparatus,  which  gives  him  early  warning  of
 potential troub'amakers within either the party or
 the -.rmy.
 Even if the two leaders amain united, there
 may  be  a  move  against 'them  by  Beath party
 critics acting with army support, or an independ-
 ent move by the army. In the past two months,
 there ha~~a been signs of increasing military dis-
 satisfaction with the prolonged, incon~.iusive war.
 If the Iraqi regime were overthrown, there
 probably would be no sudden shifts in domestic
 or foreign policy-except perhaps for the handling
 of the Kurdish question. The. Iraqis are so hea;~ily
 dependent on the SOVIPt  l!nion for deliveries of
 sophistir,ated weapons that any regime that takes
 power is unlike~~  to loosen the country's ties with
 MOSCOW.

 By  removing  Emperor  Haile  Selassie  on
 September  12, the Armed  Forces Coordinating
 Committee teas further strengthened its control of
 the  government.  The  committee-formally
 designating itself the Provisional Military Goverr-
 ^ieni-also named General Aman, who has been
 defe~~se minister, as chairman of the provisional
 government and prime minister. Amon is popular
 v ith  the military and  has  been  taking on in-
 creasing importance in the government in recent
 weeks.  He  is believed to be working with the
 more rrrc4crate forces on tFre committee. Other
 cabinet  changes  are likely. The committee has
 been  worl~ing  through the facade of a civilian
 prirrre minister ar~d a largely civilian cabinet for
 several months.
 fn  ocher  moves,  the committee  dissolved
 parliament, suspended the constitution, ba~ined
 strikes  and  demonstrations,  and  imposed  a
 curfew. It plans to set up a military tribunal to
 try government officials charged with corruption.
 Haile Selassie's ailing son, 57-year-old Crown
 Prince Asfa Wossen, was chosen t~ succeed to the
 throne, but the co;nmittee stated that he would
 be a  "figurehead" and would carry the title of
 "kiny," a step  below an  emperor  in Ethiopia's
 royal  hierarchy.  Since  early  1973 the  Crown
 Prince has been  living in  Europe vdhere he has
 been slowly recovering from a stroke that left him
 seriously  incapacitated.  An  unassertive  person
 when he vras well, he would be easily mar~palatcd
 by the committee.                -
 favor  the  establishment  of  a  constitutional
 monarchy and reconciliation of the disparate ele-
 men~s in Ethiopian society apparently still have
 the upper hand.
 The forced removal of Haile Selassie appears
 to have  been carefully prepared, and  the com-
 mittee  may  be  able  to  continue to guide the
 revolution in a generally bloodless manner. So far,
 there have been no reports of unrest or dem~n-
 strations of support for Haile Selassie in the rural
 areas, once his stronghold. Moderate members of
 'the committee, hov~.~~~~~r, may have difficulty con-
 trolling  radical  students  and  military  elements
 who are demanding that the measured pace of the
 revolution be intensified.
 Prospects for avoiding violence may depend
 on what happens to Haile Selassie, vrho is being
 detained  at 4th  Division headquarters  `.n Addis
 Ababa  along  with  other  nobles  rounded  up
 earlier. Anti-monarchist sentiment is running high
 in Addis Ababa, and radicals on the committee
 have  been  pressing for Haile Selassie's trio! and
 possible  execution.  Moderates appear to  be in
 favor of allowing the 82-year-old deposed mon-
 arch to Live out his years at one of his countryside
 palaces. At present, the committee is apparently
 concentrating en overcoming Haile Selassie's re-
 ported resistance to its demands that he yield his
 Overseas assets.
 Asfa  bVossen  may  be unwilling t~ return,
 however. He may be frightened of` by the treat-
 ment meted out to his father, thr: recent arrests of
 ottrer close rElatives, and the military committee's
 harsh  public statements against the entire royal
 family.
 In that event, the military may turn to Asfa
 Wossen's 21-year-old son, Prince Zara Yacob, or it
 may take the occasion to abolish the monarchy
 and  establish  a  republic.  Radicals  in  the com-
 m~ttee have been pushing hard for such a move.
 As of now,  moderate committee members who
 The cc~rrmittee will probably be preoccupied
 for some time with  domestic matters,  and the
 removal of Haile Selassie is unlikely to bring any
 immediate  shift  in  the  government's  foreign
 policy. Although there have been some reports
 that the government lies L~een looking for Soviet
 arn;s, it has generally retained its ties to the 1Nest.
 Following  the  removal  of  the  Emperor,  some
 preliminary foreign policy guidelines were issued.
 They provide that the government will maintain a
 "nonaligned"  Foreign  policv,  respect  Ethiopia's
 international obligatigns, gnu strengthen ties with
