 APPEAL OF THE ALL-CHINA FEDERATION OF TRADE
 UNIONS TO ALL THE WORKERS AND STAFF MEM-
 BERS IN THE COUNTRY FOR THE FULFILMENT AND
 OVERFULFILMENT OF THE FIRST FIVE-YEAR PLAN
 FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
 Dear men and women workers of the whole country,
 technicians, staff members and relatives of the workers and
 staff members!
 The First Five-Year Plan for Development of the National
 Economy has been officially adopted by the National People's
 Congress. The First Five-Year Plan is the first great plan of
 the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 for leading the entire people to construct socialism. It may be
 noted that the First Five-Year Plan provides that, within
 five years, the state will appropriate capital funds to the value
 of 76,640 million yuan (equivalent to more than 700 million
 taels of gold*) to build factories, collieries, power stations,
 railways and schools, which will lay a solid preliminary
 foundation for creating a happy socialist life for all the people
 in the country.  We are greatly inspired by this great plan.
 When we recall the past, what memories we have of the
 miserable life our workers had to go through in the old society
 of reactionary rule.  In those days, to work was to suffer,
 to be used as slaves.  We were often hungry, cold, beaten
 and abused.  We were not free to speak as we liked, we had

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350014-9
 no right to organize trade unions, and no security in our
 jobs, not to speak of a free and happy life.  Comrades, now
 the conditions are entirely different.  Since the victory of the
 revolution under the leadership of the great Communist Party
 of China and Chairman Mao Tse-tung, and the establishment
 of the People's Republic of China, the status of our working
 class and working people has undergone a fundamental
 change.  Our working class has become the leading class in
 the country.  During these few years since liberation, under
 the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung, we have taken upon a conscious attitude toward
 labor  in  rapidly  restoring the  national  economy  and
 developing production, and our life is very much improved.
 But in order to further better our life, it is necessary to do
 away with the economic backwardness which has enveloped
 China for years, to carry out the fundamental task of the
 state in the transition period and to turn our country into a
 great socialist state.
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung has said; "Without industry,
 there can be no solid national defence, no people's welfare
 and no national prosperity and power."  Only if we bring
 about socialist industrialization, can we fundamentally turn
 the weak and poor China into a prosperous and powerful
 China.  The main link in the chain of socialist industrializa-
 tion is to give priority to the development of heavy industry.
 The First Five-Year Plan provides: the industrial construction
 programme is the core of the First Five-Year Plan, and the
 156 industrial projects to be built with Soviet aid are in turn
 the core of the industrial construction programme.  By 1957,
 China will be able to produce 4,120,000 tons of steel, 15,900
 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and 113 million tons of
 coal per year.  We will also be able to produce heavy metal-
 cutting lathes, power-generating equipment, metallurgical

 and mining machinery, motor lorries, tractors, ships and
 aeroplanes.  The realization of the First Five-Year Plan will
 lay the preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization.
 In the First Five-Year Plan, we will also have to foster
 the growth of agricultural producers' co-operatives and
 handicraft producers' co-operatives, thus laying the prelimin-
 ary foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture
 and handicrafts.  We will also have to transform capitalist
 industry and commerce into various forms of state-capitalist
 enterprises, thus laying the preliminary foundation for the
 socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.
 In five years, our agriculture, communications and transporta-
 tion, city construction, commerce, culture and education will
 be correspondingly developed.  At the same time, the state
 will allocate large sums of money to improve our working
 and living conditions, so that the material and cultural life
 of all the working people in the country will be further im-
 proved.
 The task laid down by the First Five-Year Plan for
 industrial and other construction is to lay the preliminary
 foundation for a prosperous, powerful and happy socialist
 state.  This is an  important step  in carrying out the
 fundamental task of the state in the transition period. After
 about three Five-Year Plans, we can turn our country into
 a great socialist state; while after several decades, say forty
 to fifty years, we can catch up and surpass the most advanced
 capitalist countries in the world, and become a powerful and
 highly industrialized socialist state.  By that time, every
 Chinese citizen will lead a prosperous and happy life.  The
 fundamental task of the state in the transition period and the
 First Five-Year Plan, drawn up by the great Communist
 Party of China and Chairman Mao Tse-tung, is to make it
 possible for the people all over the country and for our children

 and grand children to lead a happy, socialist life, which is
 the long-term and basic interest, and also the greatest interest
 of all the Chinese people.
 We know that a happy, socialist life can only be created
 by the arduous labour and toil of hundreds of thousands of
 people.  All tasks set by the First Five-Year Plan, no matter
 to what sphere they belong, are gigantic and arduous.  The
 First Five-Year Plan has in all fields provided the people with
 glorious, though difficult tasks.  To fulfil the First Five-Year
 Plan is not an easy task and not without difficulties. Its
 fulfilment depends on the efforts of all the people, particularly
 those of the working class.  We must follow the example of
 the Soviet people in constructing socialism, their strict
 observance of economy in all fields and their undaunted spirit
 in long years of struggle.   For the realization of socialist
 industrialization, for the long-term and basic interest as well
 as the greatest interest of all the people and our future gen-
 erations, we must carry on fully the fine tradition of our
 people of diligence, frugality and perseverence, overcome all
 difficulties, and strive for the fulfilment and overfulfilment of
 the First Five-Year Plan, and for our new and happy life!
 The First Five-Year Plan for Development of the National
 Economy is not only a plan of industrial construction, but
 also a plan for the development of agricultural and all other
 branches of the economy.  The labour of all the workers and
 staff members in industrial production, capital construction,
 communications and transportation, commerce, state farms,
 handicrafts, cultural and educational institutions and water
 conservancy projects, of all workers and staff in state, co-
 operative, joint state-private, and private enterprises, of all
 the personnel of state economic departments and all other
 state institutions, is necessary to the fulfilment of the plan.
 The successful fulfilment of the First Five-Year Plan requires

 the selfless labour of every one of us.  Everyone of us should-
 ers a share of this important responsibility in the fulfilment
 of the plan, and the labour everyone of us undertakes is a
 matter of supreme honour.
 Men and women workers, technicians and staff members!
 Development of labour emulation is the most effective means
 of fulfilling the Five-Year Plan and in constantly raising
 labour productivity.  Let everyone of us take an active part
 in the movement, discuss thoroughly the production plan of our
 own enterprise and draw up individual and collective pledges.
 Everyone of us and every enterprise must strive to fulfil all
 aspects of the state plan and reach the various targets re-
 quired by the state plan.  Everyone of us should use our
 brains, and devote the best of our ability to fulfil our individual
 and collective pledges with distinction.  We must give a new
 and bigger impetus to the labour emulation drive so that it
 leaches new height.  This is the best guarantee for the fulfil-
 ment of the First Five-Year Plan as a whole.
 In labour emulation drives, we should practise the
 strictest economy in all fields, so that large funds necessary
 to socialist industrialization can be accumulated.  We should
 see that every person, every machine, every cent and every
 minute is used fully and effectively in the construction work
 of the Five-Year Plan.  It is the duty- of everyone to practise
 strict economy.  We must economize on the use of raw
 material, reduce costs of production and the expenses of dis-
 tribution.  We should improve on the quality of products,
 reduce and eliminate rejects.  We should keep the machines
 and tools in good condition, and so to prolong their life.  We
 should lower the cost in capital construction, guarantee the
 quality of the projects, and implement the policy of "Quality,
 speed, economy and safety".    We should strictly observe all
 working rules and procedures and consciously maintain

 labour discipline.  Every person should combat waste in a
 responsible manner as befits the masters of the country.
 Comrades!  If we are to accomplish the task of socialist
 industrialization, we not only need to be highly enthusiastic,
 but must also be equipped with a high cultural and technical
 level and skill. We must try our best to improve our culture,
 study techniques and study Marxism-Leninism.  We must
 particularly study the advanced experiences of the Soviet
 Union and the People's Democracies and learn from the ex-
 perts from the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies
 here in China assisting us in our construction. In the many
 new, improved and expanded projects of the Plan, the equip-
 ment are up to date and production techniques are new and
 complicated.  Only by raising our own cultural and technical
 level, by mastering and improving our managerial skill, can
 we effectively make use of the potentialities of these new equip-
 ment.  Domestically we should also have to learn from one
 another.  The advanced should help the backward, the back-
 ward should catch up with the advanced, so that everyone will
 progress. All advanced experience is the precious asset of
 our country and people, and should be rapidly spread among
 all.
 Men and women advanced workers and model work-
 ers! You should display greater initiative and creative ability,
 try your best to improve your cultural and technical level
 and skill and do your job even better.  You must never be
 self-complacent.  You must never lose contact with the mass
 of the people.  You must maintain and spread the honour
 bestowed on you by the people and the state.  You must serve
 as example among the workers, as key personnel, as links
 between the leadership and the mass of the workers, unit-
 ing them and guiding them forward in the struggle to over-
 fulfil the Five-Year Plan.

 Men and women technicians!  You have a weighty
 responsibility in the struggle to fulfil the Five-Year Plan.
 The state as well as the people urgently expect you to fully
 play your part in the great work of socialist construction.
 You must redouble your efforts to raise your political and
 technical level, to bring theory into ever closer relation to
 practice, strengthen your contact with the workers, direct and
 help them to study and master new techniques, improve and
 raise their technical level.  Combine your scientific and tech-
 nical knowledge with the practical experience of the broad
 masses of workers, and put all of your knowledge into the
 glorious task required of you in the Five-Year Plan.
 Men and women staff members! You are mental workers.
 All production departments, communications and transport
 departments and economic administrative institutions require
 you to work with enthusiasm and intelligence.  You should
 study politics, acquire more vocational knowledge, learn how
 to manage an enterprise and continuously improve your skill.
 You should keep in close touch with the workers, firmly rely
 on them and serve them, and together with them, manage
 to run our enterprises properly.
 Men and women educational workers!  The state urgent-
 ly requires you to accomplish your work of training personnel
 for construction.  Your labour is closely connected with the
 future of our country.  Your task is heavy, but glorious. You
 should study Marxism-Leninism harder than ever, raise
 your ideological level, improve your teaching methods, raise
 your standard of teaching, and guarantee the fulfilment
 of the whole educational plan of the state within the alloted
 time.  Men and women teachers in spare time schools for
 workers! Your labour is of great significance for the improve-
 ment of the cultural and technical level of the workers.  You
 should wholeheartedly help the workers to overcome their

 difficulties in studying culture and technique, and constantly
 strive to improve the educational and technical level of the
 workers in a systematic manner.
 Men and women workers, technicians and staff mem-
 bers in private enterprises!  Together with the workers
 and staff in the state and joint state-private enterprises,
 you are shouldering the glorious task of realizing the
 Five-Year Plan.  Like them, you should give your best work.
 You have another especially important task, namely, to assist
 the government to supervise the capitalists to see that they
 accept the state policy of using, restricting and transforming
 capitalist industry and commerce, so that, through the forms
 of joint state-private enterprises, and the state placing orders
 with private enterprises for manufacturing and processing,
 as well as acting as agents of the state enterprises, they will
 be gradually taken into the path of state capitalism, thus lay-
 ing the foundation for socialist transformation of private in-
 dustry and commerce.  This is a very complicated and
 difficult task, it is also an extremely complicated and acute
 class struggle.  All the workers and staff should continue to
 raise their class consciousness, strengthen unity among
 themselves, combat the influence of capitaist ideology and
 resist all forms of attack launched by the capitalist class.
 Relatives of the workers and staff!  Your relatives are
 gloriously working for the fulfilment of the Five-Year Plan.
 You should see that you yourselves are further organized, help
 one another in a spirit of fraternity, study hard, take an
 active part in social activities and work to attain progress
 in every aspect of life.  You should carry out your house work
 with the aim of making your homes more harmonious,
 pleasant and happy.  You should give every attention to the
 health of your relatives, see that they have enough rest, help

 them to preserve their health and play their full part in con-
 struction.
 Men and women trade union workers and trade union
 activists!  The Communist Party and the state rely on the
 trade unions to improve your organisation of the great masses
 of workers, continuously raise their political consciousness,
 cultural and technical level and skill, encourage them to rally
 more closely around the Communist Party of China, and
 strive for the fulfilment of the First Five-Year Plan and the
 fundamental tasks of the country in the transition period.
 The Party and the state expect the trade unions to be vigilant
 in combating all acts of corruption, waste, bureaucracy and
 violation of laws.  We must develop to the full the role of
 the trade unions and see that they carry out their responsi-
 bilities.  Workers and staff members of the whole country
 must supervise the work of their own trade unions so that
 they will carry out their responsibilities.  Trade unions at
 all levels should keep in close touch with the workers, display
 the spirit of democracy, pay attention to the living conditions
 of the workers, step up the labour emulation drive to a new
 upsurge and in every way mobilize the workers to ensure the
 fulfilment of the First Five-Year Plan.
 Comrades!  The fulfilment of the First Five-Year Plan
 relies on the common efforts of all the workers, peasants and
 other working people.  If we do not have the active support
 of the peasants, it is impossible to bring about socialist
 industrialization.  The consolidated alliance of the workers
 and peasants under the leadership of the working class is
 the basis for the victory of the peope's revolution, as well
 as the basis for the fulfilment of the First Five-Year Plan
 and the victory of the socialist revolution.  We need all the
 peasants in the whole country to devote themselves earnestly
 to the development of agricultural production, to produce

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350014-9
 large quantities of grain, and such industrial raw materials
 as cotton, jute, cured tobacco, sugar-cane, sugar-beet and oil-
 bearing crops.  The peasants in the whole country also
 require us to produce promptly tractors and all kinds of
 modern agricultural machinery, large quantities of fertilizers
 and  insecticides, to produce better,  cheaper  and  more
 industrial goods, so as to satisfy their needs to develop
 production and to improve their living conditions. Workers,
 technicians and staff on state farms and tractor stations, you
 must work conscientiously and set a good example to all the
 peasants in the country, influence and help them to develop
 agricultural producers' co-operatives, and take the path to a
 prosperous, socialist life.  All the workers and staff in the
 whole country should in their daily work increase production,
 practise strict economy, combat waste, continuously raise
 labour productivity and lower the cost of production, so as
 to further strengthen and consolidate the alliance between the
 workers and the peasants.
 In order to fulfil the First Five-Year Plan and secure the
 victory of socialist industrialization, we must work for a
 peaceful external environment.  Recently, due to the common
 efforts of all peace-loving countries and peoples, internation-
 al tension has been relaxed to a certain extent.  But a part
 of our sacred territory-Taiwan, has not yet been liberated, the
 question of universal disarmament has not been concretely
 settled, the threat of atomic war has not been removed, the
 American armed forces are still occupying our Taiwan and
 the Taiwan Straits, and the military bases and military blocs
 encircling us are not yet withdrawn.  The possibility of a
 sudden attack on us still exists.  While we are working
 selflessly for the accomplishment of the First Five-Year Plan,
 we must continue to be very vigilant. We must strengthen
 our national defence, stand firm in support to the struggle

 for the liberation of Taiwan, strive to prevent and be ready
 to deal with any contingencies that may arise, guarantee the
 smooth running of socialist construction and defend peace
 in Asia and the world.
 The First Five-Year Plan is the plan of the Chinese
 people for their advance victoriously towards socialism.  Our
 victory will mean defeat of the enemy.  But our internal and
 external enemies will never reconcile themselves to their
 defeat, they will resort every vile means to plot against us.
 All of us and all the people of China must greatly elevate
 our vigilance, strengthen our unity, keep our eyes open and
 resolutely, thoroughly and completely wipe out all counter-
 revolutionary elements, for the defence of socialist con-
 struction.
 Dear Comrades!  Our First Five-Year Plan has been in
 operation for two years.  We have successfully completed
 the plans for 1953 and 1954.  The tasks for the coming three
 years will be heavier and more difficult.  In the last two years
 we have overcome many difficulties, in the future we will have
 to overcome still more.  Our work is heavy, everyone of
 us should exert himself to the utmost, raise the daunt-
 less and unconquerable spirit of our people and strive for the
 fulfilment of the First Five-Year Plan in all respects.  We
 have the leadership of the great Communist Party of China
 and Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the consolidated alliance of the
 workers and peasants, the assistance of the great Soviet
 Union and Peoples' Democracies as well as the support of
 all peace-loving peoples in the whole world. Having all these
 favourable conditions, if we rally closely around the Com-
 munist Party of China, work  diligently,  overcome  all
 difficulties, increase production and practise strict economy,
 the successful fulfilment and overfulfilment of the First Five-
 Year Plan is assured.
