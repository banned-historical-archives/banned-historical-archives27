 High Soviet officials have used recent private con-
 versations with Ambassador Thompson to emphasize their
 desire for an improvement in US-Soviet relations. These
 overtures appear to be part of a concerted effort, which
 began last September with Khrushchev's tAlks with Prime
 Minister Macmillan, to lay the groundwork for a return to
 high-level negotiations after the new US administration
 is installed.  The gestures take on. added significance
 in view of the protracted discussions in Moscow dealing
 with Sino-Soviet differences, and suggest that Khrush-
 chev continues to disregard Peiping's arguments that
 his tactics vis-a-vis the West are detrimental to Chinese
 interests.   On;disarmament, the Soviet UN delegation is
 preparing to submit a formal call fora summit-level
 meeting at a special General Assembly session next
 spring.

 De Gaulle's sudden changes in high-level French
 administrators in Algeria last week have thrown his
 rightist opponents further off balance, but the possi-
 bility remains that they may react with violence prior
 to the forthcoming referendum.   The referendum will
 probably be held on 8 January, and Do Gaulle will open
 the campaign for a favorable vote on his self-determination
 policy when he begins a tour of Algeria on 9 December.
 The timing of these moves seems intended to blunt the
 Provisional Algerian Government's drive for a UN-
 supervised referendum in Algeria.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 M06COW MEETINGS  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  1
 As the Moscow conference of world Communist leaders
 enters its fourth, and apparently final, week,  Soviet and
 Chinese leaders continue to express their differences
 publicly, and disagreements at the private meetings are
 apparent in the strained atmosphere in Moscow,
 bitter exchanges between the Russians and the Chinese.
 The length of the talks, however, suggests that the
 USSR, while unwilling to accept any of the Chinese posi-
 tions, is also unwilling to abandon its efforts to work
 out a declaration which will maintain a facade of unity.
 WEST-- EAST GERMAN INTERZONAL TRADE DEVELOPMENTS .
 Bonn has publicly indicated it wants to explore the
 possibilities for a new agreement with East Germany on
 interzonAl trade.  Adenauer?s press chief Von Eckardt
 stated on 30 November that new talks would be conditional
 on the cessation of East German harassments of Berlin.

 Khrushchev?s promise to supply East Germany with neces-
 sary raw materials and goods in 1961 if negotiations with
 West Germany fail greatly strengthens Ulbricht?s bargain-
 ing position,  East German officials are apparently seek-
 ing to take advantage of differences among West German
 officials concerning the conduct of negotiations and in-
 sist that talks must be on a ministerial level and that
 West German representatives may not speak for West
 Berlin.

 UNREST IN VENEZUELA  .         .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page 5
 The recurrent rioting which began in Caracas on 25
 November was promoted by pro-Castro opposition elements
 and is probably part of a continuing violent campaign to
 unseat President Betaneourt.   The rioting may result in
 further deterioration of Venezuelan-Cuban relations.
 Betancourt, who suspended constitutional guarantees on
 28 November and called in the army to assist in re-
 establishing order, appears to have the unrest under
 control for the present, but Venezuela?s pressing
 economic difficulties leave him vulnerable to opposition
 attacks,
 SOVIET-FINNISH RELATIONS
 .   Page 6
 The communique issued on 24 November at the conclu-
 sion of President Kekkonen?s four-day visit to Moscow
 reaffirmed Soviet approval of Finnish affiliation with
 the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) on condition
 that this would not prejudice the further development
 of Soviet-Finnish trade.  Soviet concessions to Kekkonen
 on the EFTA question were probably intended to demon-
 strate for the Scandinavian countries the benefits of
 Khrushchev's peaceful coexistence policy.   The Finns
 now will ask the EFTA countries for permission to grant
 most-favored-nation treatment to Finnish imports of
 Soviet goods.
 SOVIET TRADE WITH JAPAN
 .  .  .  .  .  . .       .  .  .    .   Page 8
 The Soviet-Japanese trade talks which began in Moscow
 on 12 November are aimed primarily at drawing up plans for
 trade in 1961 under the present trade agreements  The is-
 sue of extending credits to the USSR for financing pur-
 chases of Japanese capital equipment apparently has been
 settled, and Tokyo is approving such credits on a came-
 by-case Oasis.   Although actual trade during 1960 ap-
 parently will exceed the target of $125,000,000--more
 than double the 1959 figure--an excess of imports from
 the USSR continues; Japanese officials had hoped to
 remedy the imbalance during the first year of the three-
 year agreement.   Nevertheless, the present trend sug-
 gests that Japan eventually may rank with Britain,

 The USSR's first public opinion poll was recently
 conducted by the Soviet youth newspaper, Komsomolskaya
 Pravda. Those polled represented in large measure the
 higher income groups and were asked if their standard
 of living had been raised.   The standard has generally

 Paris of the heads of governments of the Common Market

 will also meet privately with Adenauer on 4 December,  is
 expected on both occasions to press his plan for a
 European "confederation.,'  The other Common Market

 French President's point of view, but not to the extent
 of weakening the Common Market or of endorsing his views
 on NATO.

 In mid-November the Italian Government began talks
 with Austrian officials on the rights of the German-

 complying with the UN General Assembly's October resolu-
 tion.   Italian officials hint their readiness to make
 limited concessions,  presumably by administrative action.
 More extensive concessions requiring parliamentary action
 might be blocked by rightist opposition.

 the Imperial Bodyguard.        He has recently ordered transfers
 of high-ranking military officers and the arrest of

 The constitutional review conference for the Federa-

 December andIIis expected to be one of the most difficult
 in recent years.  The sharpest difference between the
 African nationalists and the dominant white minority
 is over the African demand for acknowlegement of the
 right of secession from the Federation.   London con-
 tinues to promote a multiracial state but in the past
 year has tended to favor African aspirations.  A

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 MOSCOW AND BERLIN  .  .  .  .  . ..  .    .  .  .  .            .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The Soviet position on Berlin is essentially the same
 as put forward by Khrushchev two years ago.  The key to
 future Soviet moves lies in the decisions taken in 1955
 to gain Western acceptance of the concept of two Germanys.
 Within the framework of a policy of limited risks, Moscow
 and the East Germans have relied heavily on erosion tac-
 tics to weaken the Western position, isolate West Berlin,
 and reinforce East German sovereignty.   While these tactics
 can be expected to continue and to vary in intensity, it
 appears from Khrushchev's reluctance to bring about a
 showdown that he realizes.the grave dangers in the situa-
 tion and prefers a negotiated settlement.   If, however,
 Soviet efforts to bring about another summit meeting
 fail, or if Khrushchev does not obtain his minimum demand
 for a change in the city's legal status, Moscow may move
 unilaterally and transfer control of access to Berlin to
 East -Germany.
 THE WORLD SUGAR INDUSTRY .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  7
 The international sugar industry in recent years has
 suffered from overproduction, depressed prices,, and grow-
 ing self-sufficiency among countries formerly having a
 sugar deficit.  This situation has been further clouded
 in recent months by instability in the Caribbean area,
 the shifting of American sugar purchases to non-Cuban
 suppliers, and the emergence of the Communist bloc as
 a major buyer.  The signatories of the International
 Sugar Agreement, which is to be revised next year, will
 find it difficult to cope with these shifting trade
 patterns.  The smaller producers are strongly competing
 for Cuba's ,'share of  the lucrative American market, despite
 the risks of overexpansion.

 Although UAR President Nasir has been making some
 progress in Syria, his rule there continues to be threatened
 by possible uprisings or by an internal coup with outside
 support.   While f ;il:ure in Syria and its separation from
 the UAR would be a devastating blow to his prestige both
 at home and abroad, even moderate continued success would
 add to his stature.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 December 1960
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 High Soviet officials have
 used recent private conversa-
 tions with Ambassador Thompson
 to emphasize their desire for
 an improvement in US-Soviet re-
 lations. In a conversation with
 the ambassador; First Deputy
 Foreign Minister Kuzneteov ex-
 pressed optimism over the pros-
 pects for better relations. He
 indicated satisfaction with
 Senator Kennedy's election but
 expressed concern over press
 reports that the new US admin-
 istration's first step would
 be an increase in military ex.-
 penditurese  He urged the ambas-
 sador to endeavor to convince
 the President-elect that the
 USSR was not seeking to dominate
 the world by force or other
 means and that both sides must
 seek to establish an atmosphere
 of trust and confidence.
 Presidium member Ignatov
 also stated to Thompson his
 conviction  that  th a  United
 States and the USSR would re-
 establish good relations under
 the new administration.   Other
 Soviet officials have also
 sought to promote this general
 line.  The chief of the American
 section of the Soviet Foreign
 Ministry predicted to Thompson
 that bilateral relations would
 soon improve.  The minister
 for higher education made a
 similar forecast and called
 for broadening the student ex-

 These overtures are ap-

 protracted discussions in Moscow
 dealing with Sino-Soviet differ-

 continues to disregard Peiping's
 arguments that his tactics vis-

 to Chinese interests. Khrushchev
 apparently is seeking to under-

 demands which would imply even
 a partial repudiation of his

 break the current impasse over
 various disarmament resolutions
 by submitting,a formal call for
 the heads of government to at-
 tend a special General Assembly
 meeting next spring.  Thus far,
 the Soviet representatives have
 withheld the move in order to
 use it as a counter to a pos-
 sible neutralist proposal to
 refer outstanding resolutions
 to the UN Disarmament Commis-
 sion.  The Soviet UN delegation
 is also privately attempting to
 discourage any move to defer
 action on disarmament until
 the General Assembly resumes
 after a Christmas recess, since
 this would undercut the call
 for a special session on dis-
 armament only.
 Moscow probably sees such
 a session as a means of estab-
 lishing early contact with a new
 US administration and antici-
 pates that a formal resolution
 could gain wide support and
 be difficult for the West  to
 reject.   Since Afro-Asian opin-
 ion strongly supported the
 abortive resolution last Sep-
 tember for renewed East-West
 contacts, Moscow  probably
 feels these states would line
 up behind a Soviet proposal
 for what, in effect, would be
 a summit meeting with the West
 on disarmament.
 At the nuclear test ban
 conference, the Soviet delega-
 tion has made it  clear  in
 private talks that there will
 be no departures from its pres-
 ent position on major issues.
 As in the disarmament discus-
 sions, Moscow's tactics are to
 temporize until the new US ad-
 ministration has taken office.
 Ignatov virtually admitted to
 Ambassador Thompson that Mos-
 cow would make no serious ef-
 fort to reach agreement at
 Geneva until after January.
 In anticipation of a long re-
 cess, the Soviet delegation is
 devoting its conference state-
 ments to making a record  of
 alleged Western intransigence.
 The chief Soviet delegate told
 American officials privately
 that it was up to the West to
 break the deadlock.
 Che Guevara's economic
 mission scored an  important
 success with the large-scale
 trade and aid agreements signed
 at the conclusion of its two-
 week visit to Communist China
 on 30 November.   Under the agree-
 ment--the largest concluded by
 Communist China  with  a non-
 bloc country--Peiping will pro-
 vide a $60,000,000  interest-
 free line of credit to be used
 between 1961 and 1965.   It will

 last July. The Cuban ambassador
 to Peiping,  Oscar Pino Santos,
 presented his credentials to
 Chinese Communist leaders on
 26 November.   In the numerous
 speeches that accompanied this
 and Guevara's visit, the al-
 leged similarities between re-
 cent conditions in China and
 present conditions in Cuba--and
 in Latin America generally--have
 repeatedly been stressed, along
 with expressions  of  eternal
 friendship between the Cuban
 and Chinese peoples. The first

 Announcement of the es-
 tablishment of diplomatic re-
 lations between Cuba and North
 Vietnam is likely to come as a
 result of the visit to Hanoi
 beginning on 28 November by a
 member of Guevara's mission,
 Subsecretary of Foreign Affairs
 Rodriguez Llompart.   Guevara,
 or part of his mission, may
 also visit Ulan Bator.
 The Castro regime, however,
 suffered at least two setbacks
 in the past few days in its
 efforts to expand commercial
 ties with free world countries,
 on which it continues to de-
 pend for a number of vital
 imports and for markets for
 over half its exports.   On 25
 November it became apparent
 that lengthy negotiations with
 Japan for the purchase of 50,000
 tons of Cuban sugar had fallen
 through, largely because the
 Japanese found they could pur-
 chase sugar elsewhere  at a
 lower price.
 These difficulties are prob-
 ably reflected in Cuban efforts
 to sell its sugar in other free
 world countries.  The Sino-So-
 viet bloc purchased about 40
 percent of Cuba's sugar exports
 this year and.next year is com-
 mitted to buy some 2,200,000
 tons of a crop that normally ex-
 ceeds 5,500,000 tons.
 The regime has also suf-
 fered a setback from Canada,
 on which it is counting heavily
 for assistance in overcoming
 the more critical effects of
 the United States export con-
 trols, particularly in respect
 to spare parts for sugar mills
 and oil refineries.   A Cuban
 effort to establish regular
 commercial flights to Canada
 as one means of strengthening
 trade ties was rebuffed by the
 Canadians on 27 November. Ottawa
 informed Havana that it was not
 now prepared to negotiate..an air
 agreement and even refused per-
 mission for a single flight by
 a plane:the Cubans claimed was.
 already loaded with tomatoes
 for Canada.

 officials are Commu-
 nists or pro-Commu-
 nists.   These incum-
 bents are preparing
 to hold trials of of-
 ficials of the ousted
 Lemus regime.  The
 BACKGROUND
 Haitian history is marked by alternating periods of dictatorship and
 anarchy; the collapse of all authority in 1915 led to 19 years of occupa-
 tion by the US Marines.   Dr. Francois Duvalier, who became President in
 October 1957 after a rigged election and the fall of five governments with-
 in a year, has ruled by a mixture of paternalism and terrorism, openly
 favoring the black masses against the small mulatto elite.  Military power
 is fragmented among the army,  the police,  the presidential guard, and a
 civilian militia.   Overpopulated  Haiti is one of the poorest of Latin
 governing junta has
 relinquished control over hiring
 and firing in the various min-
 istries,  thus giving free reign
 to further pro-Communist ap-
 pointments and the purging of
 holdovers.
 The Communist-dominated
 Salvadoran labor federation has
 announced that it is proceeding
 with plans to organize peasant
 committees throughout the counT
 try.   If the junta permits this,
 contrary to the practice of pre
 vious governments, the Commu-
 nists would have a potent po-
 litical weapon.   Salvadoran
 peasants, a generally depressed
 group with real socio-economic
 grievances, can easily be manip-
 ulated politically.
 More than any other develop-
 ment, this tactic would probably
 strengthen the resolve of anti-
 Communists, particularly in the
 military, who are giving serious
 consideration to staging a coun-
 tercoup.  These groups probably
 recognize that the Communists
 could use the peasants to create
 an armed militia capable of ef-
 fectively challenging any future
 effort by anti-Communists to
 exert control.   The army and
 the landowning class have long
 feared a peasant uprising such
 as occurred in 1932, when a
 Communist-led insurrection was
 suppressed by the army only after
 thousands had been killed.
 Haitian President Duvalier
 imposed martial law on 22 No-
 vember in response to a student
 strike he claimed was Commu-
 nist-controlled and politically
 motivated.   He has ordered a
 shake-up in the top military
 command and has intensified
 the repression of the govern-
 ment's opponents, ranging from
 pro-Communist to pro-clerical
 groups.  The student strike
 has been vitiated, at least
 temporarily, by the government's
 order closing all schools un-
 til early next year.
 Although the strike is
 believed to have been touched
 off by student resentment over
 the President's refusal to free
 a student leader in jail with-
 out charges since last September,
 student leaders are apparently
 sympathetic to the Castro
 regime, and the possibility of
 Cuban influence in the strike
 cannot be eliminated.   The
 regime's reaction to the strike
 suggests, however, that it is
 using it primarily as a pre-
 text for another of its peri-
 odic moves against the opposi-
 tion.
 American officials in Port-
 au-Prince report speculation
 that the government's emphasis
 on its charges of Communist in-
 volvement in the strike may
 have been a further effort by

 Duvalier to convince the United
 States that Haiti has a serious
 Communist problem and needs
 massive new aid.
 The government neverthe-
 less faces a serious domestic
 problem.   Its police excesses
 and the alienation of the Roman
 Catholic Church following the
 summary expulsion of the arch-
 bishop--an  old opponent of. the ,
 President--have intensified and
 widened anti-Duvalier feeling,'
 Which was already strong in the
 capital.   Although the regime
 appears at the moment to be
 controlling the situation,
 elements within the government
 and the army may  seek  to
 capitalize on the President's
 growing unpopularity by  at-
 tempting to overthrow  him.
 De Gaulle's sudden changes
 in high-level French adminis-
 trators in Algeria last week
 have thrown his rightist op-
 ponents,ftrther off balance,
 but the possibility remains that
 they may react with violence
 prior to the forthcoming refer-
 endum.   The referendum will
 probably be held on 8 January,
 and De Gaulle will open-the
 campaign for a favaorable vote
 on his self-determination policy
 when he begins a tour of Algeria
 on 9 December.   The timing of
 these moves seems intended'to
 blunt the provisional Algerian
 government's (PGAR) drive for
 a UN-supervised referendum in
 Algeria.
 The speed with which Jean
 Morin replaced Paul Delouvrier
 as French delegate general in
 Algeria apparently took right-
 ist elements by surprise, but
 has reportedly not changed the
 dominant belief in Algiers that
 insurrectionary action will oc-
 cur before the January referen-
 dum.   Both  Morin  and  Louis
 Joxe, the new  minister for
 Algerian affairs who made a
 24-hour visit to Algiers  on
 28 November, have sought to re-
 assure the European settlers by
 stressing their opportunity to
 vote for Algerian integration
 with France in the final  Al-
 gerian referendum on  self-
 determination.    In  France,
 Jacques Soustelle has admitted
 privately that he is uneasy
 about De Gaulle's  plans  and
 fears they would place the
 rightist opposition in an
 embarrassing position.
 As the first step to pre-
 pare for the January referendum,
 Premier Debre will set  forth
 De Gaulle's program to the
 National Assembly on 7 Decem-
 ber.                                                               The referendum must be
 formally proposed during the
 assembly session, which ends
 on 16 December.   Disregarding
 some of his advisers who fear
 an assassination attempt, D?
 Gaulle wl,ll make a five-day
 trip to Algeria beginning about
 9 December, but probably will
 avoid the rightist hotbeds of
 Algiers and Oran.    He  is  to

 vision appearances in support
 of his program prior to the
 January referendum.
 The Algerian debate is
 scheduled to begin in the UN
 General Assembly's Political
 Committee on 5 December, and
 the assembly may vote on it
 before recessing on 17 December.
 The PGAR is urging the Afro-
 Asian bloc to press for a res-
 olution calling for a UN-super-
 vised referendum in Algeria,
 but the French African states
 may win support for a moderate
 resolution recognizing UN
 interest in the problem but
 calling for negotiations among
 the parties concerned.
 Since committee resolutions
 require only a simple majority
 to pass,  the crucial test will
 occur during full assembly dis-
 cussion--possibly in mid-December
 --where a two-thirds majority is
 required.   The Afro-Asian bloc
 has failed for the last two
 years to get any UN accord on
 Algeria at all, and promoters
 of Algerian independence may
 therefore be willing to accept
 General Phoumi on 28 Novem-
 ber launched what he described
 as "a general offensive" in the
 area south of Pak Ca Dinh, some
 100 miles southeast of Vientiane.
 He claimed the initial objective
 of the operation was to eliminate
 outposts held by Vientiane troops
 --mainly Captain Kong Le's para-
 troopers--south of the Ca Dinh
 River.   If the opening presented
 itself, however, Phoumi planned
 a moderate resolution rather
 than none.
 Meanwhile, the PGAR seems
 determined to reject any nego-
 tiations, at least until after
 the UN debate.   It is angered
 over De Gaulle's recent rapid
 moves, fearing that these may
 presage a French attempt to
 reach an Algerian solution ig-
 noring the rebel government. The
 rebels were quick to denounce
 the proposed French referendum
 as a "unilateral action," and
 can be expected to continue their
 efforts to strengthen their
 international position.
 Prime Minister Balewa of
 Nigeria, apparently in response
 to an appeal from Tunisian
 President Bourguiba, decided to
 make a personal effort to further
 an Algerian settlement during his
 just-completed trip to London,
 Rome,  and Tunis.   He was re-
 ported to be aware of the great
 difficulties of this task, but to

 Africa that he must do whatever
 he can.

 to take the paratroopers' main

 Fighting thus far appears
 to be centered on a paratroop
 outpost on the Mekong River,
 a few miles southeast of Pak
 Ca Dinh.   Early reports of the
 fighting are conflicting, but
 in any event the post still
 appears to be in Vientiane hands.

 the main points in the mid-No-

 and the Pathet Lao. Souvanna
 plans  to take his minister of
 finance along,  Fndicating that
 various  forms  of assistance
 may be  a major topic of dis-
 cussion.
 Moscow's Role in Laos
 Soviet Ambassador Abramov's
 offer to the Souvanna govern-
 ment on 23 November to supply
 Vientiane with food supplies
 and gasoline airlifted from
 Hanoi was a timely maneuver on
 the part of the USSR to iden-
 tify Moscow with the neutralist
 ambitions of the Souvanna Phouma
 regime at a time when the Lao-
 tian premier was in urgent need
 of bloc assistance. Abramov's
 unscheduled flying visit to Vien-
 tiane emphasizes the speed with
 which Moscow moved in order to
 pose as the champion of legiti-
 macy in Laos.
 According to Souvanna, the
 USSR will supply Laos with 250,-
 000 gallons of fuel to be flown
 to Vientiane via Hanoi. Souvanna
 had earlier threatened to turn
 to the Soviet Union for such
 assistance if the unofficial
 Thai blockade of petroleum sup-
 plies was not halted. In addi-
 tion, milk, flour, sugar, and
 other foodstuffs will be sup-
 plied as a "good-will gift."
 Details of the offer, however,
 were not spelled out. Souvanna
 later remarked to the American
 ambassador in Vientiane that
 future supplies may be trucked
 in from North Vietnam after a
 month or two when the roads are
 repaired, suggesting  that any
 airlift of fuel to Vientiane by
 the USSR would be on an emergency
 basis only.
 On 21 November the Laotian
 ambassador in Phnom Penh re-
 ported that Vientiane had grant-
 ed visas to four Soviet Embassy
 personnel who apparently intend
 to remain in the Laotian capital
 for at least a month. Abramov,
 who returned to Phnom Penh on
 23 November, told the American
 ambassador on 29 November that
 be intended to return to Vien-
 tiane "within  a few days."
 First Secretary A. Ratanov ac-
 companied Abramov to Vientiane
 and reportedly will remain there
 about six weeks as charg6. The
 establishment of a Soviet pres-
 ence   in Laos climaxes a four-
 year   effort  on Moscow's part
 to  exchange, diplomatic mis-
 sions.
 Soviet long-range objec-
 tives in Laos are aimed at en-
 couraging neutralist sentiment
 within the country in the hope
 that Communist political sub-
 version will ultimately force
 Laos to adopt a more neutral
 position. Toward this end, the
 USSR has supported the inclusion
 of the Communist political front,
 the Neo Lao Hak Sat (NLHS),
 within a coalition Laotian gov-
 ernment.
 The Soviet Union has main-
 tained that the 1954 Geneva
 truce agreements established
 the basis for a peaceful settle-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 December 1960
 Britain as co-chairmen of the
 conference set up in 1954 an
 International Control Commission
 (ICC) ostensibly to ensure that
 the international agreements were
 observed. In practice, however,
 the ICC served as an effective
 device to improve the position
 of the Pathet Lao and its po-
 litical front, the NL1H:.
 The Soviet Government it-
 self has made several appeals
 for the return of the ICC and
 in April 1960 formally urged
 the pro-Western Laotian Govern-
 ment to "renew its coll,abora+-
 tion" with the ICC, which had
 not fulfilled one of its primary
 ,goals--the integration of the
 Pathet Lao within the national
 community. Britain, as co-chair-
 man, responded that its hands
 were tied regarding the ICC
 because of the Laotian Govern-
 ment's opposition to the pres-
 ence of the commission. Any
 formal request now for the
 return of the ICc by the Sou-
 vanna ~,roverament would make it
 difficult for Britain to main-
 tain its objections.
 Soviet propaganda hails
 the agreement reached between
 Souvanna and the Pathet Lao as
 a revival of the spirit of the
 Vientiane agreements of 1957
 which led to the establishment
 of a short-lived coalition gov-

 Recent information suggests
 that Lumumba's supporters in
 Stanleyville  are  presently
 seeking aid--possibly including
 arms--from one or more Communist
 bloc nations.
 Lumumba's supporters are
 moving to consolidate their con-
 trol of Stanleyville Province,
 and Lumumba's anticipated ar-
 rival has prompted an upsurge
 in antiwhite sentiment there.
 The UN representative in Stan-
 leyville reported that "all
 whites" in the city had been
 rounded up on 28 November, and
 many subjected to beatings.
 A projected round-
 table conference,
 scheduled for early
 December, could pro-
 vide the means for
 agreement on such a
 move.  Army chief
 Mobutu has indicated
 that he regards his
 "mandate" as extend-
 ing only until the end
 of 1960, and he may
 prove receptive to negotia-
 tions leading to the installa-
 tion of a new, moderate govern-
 ment.
 Moscow radio reported with-
 out comment Lumumba's departure
 for Stanleyville, and continues
 routinely to denounce American
 "colonialism" and the Western
 "puppets," Mobutu, Tshomb6, and
 Kasavubu.   In the UN Budgetary
 Committee meeting on 29 Novem-

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 As the Moscow conference
 of world  Communist  leaders
 entered its fourth                                                 and appar-
 ently final week,  Soviet and
 Chinese leaders continued to
 express their differences pub-
 licly, and disagreements at the
 private meetings are apparent
 in the strained atmosphere in
 Moscow.   The length of  the
 talks, however, suggests that
 the USSR, while unwilling to
 crept any of the Chinese posi-
 tions, is also unwilling to
 abandon its efforts to work
 out a declaration::. which will
 maintain at least a facade of
 unity.
 The announcements on  1
 December by Moscow and Peiping
 that Soviet and Chinese leaders
 held warm and friendly talks
 t the Kremlin on 30 November
 were apparently a step in this
 direction as well as an effort
 to dispel the air of hostility
 which has characterized the
 meetings.
 Khrushchev's message to
 the Chinese leaders thanking
 them for their October Revolu-
 tion greetings, while stressing
 the need for bloc unity, was
 significantly cooler than those
 of previous years,   Roth Peo-
 ple's Daily and Pravda in  t ae
 east -few rte. ays have continued
 their editorial. disagreements,
 with Peiping emphasizing the
 need for continuous "struggle
 against' imperialsim-colonialism"
 and Moscow warning of the dan-
 ger of "dogmatism and sectari-
 anism."
 The People's Daily edito-
 rial for 29  November  opened
 with Mao's dictum that "nothing
 reactionary will topple unless
 you strike it down," and Pravda
 on the same day hailed Engel'sl
 "passionate and uncompromising
 struggle for the purity. of the
 Marxist teaching agaiinat dog-
 matism, sectarianism, and  na-
 tional narrowimiridsdness   in the
 revolutionary movement...."
 A number of press articles
 commemorating the 140th anni-
 versary of the birth of Engels
 concentrated on the major theme
 of the need for bloc unity and
 ideological purity.  The arti-
 cles employed a number of for-
 mulas which have clear anti-
 Chinese implications. In addition
 to its major editorial, Pravda
 in a long article referred
 Engels' opposition to reformism
 and "petit bourgeois ultra-rev-
 olutionism, dogmatism, and sec-
 tarianism," and quoted directly
 his criticism of those who "do
 not know how to put living theory
 into action." Izvestia  on  26
 November referred to Engels'
 criticism of "left opportunists"
 who "poured mud on the whole in-
 ternational workers'  movement
 and  its  leaders,   accusing
 everyone and everything of op-
 portunism."
 These articles apparently
 reflect the sharp disagreements
 which characterized the private
 meetings.

 bitter exchanges between the
 Soviet and Chinese delegates,
 a committee of
 26 countries had prepared a
 resolution for adoption at the
 meeting three weeks before it
 started.   Since the resolution
 was based on Soviet positions,
 FF  ~: ecause the Chinese felt
 that the Soviets were putting
 a new interpretation on this
 document, the Chinese refused
 to accept it.
 The Chinese asserted that
 their position was right and
 that they were determined to
 follow it.   They insisted: "Let
 history be the judge."   After
 claiming that there can be no
 equality if ,the international
 Communist movement is directed
 by one party, the Chinese sub-
 mitted a report which reiterated
 views they had expressed at
 Bucharest in June 1960 and which
 held that the Soviet Union was
 destroying international soli-
 darity and reinforcing revision-
 ism.
 L u
 Shao-chi gave a four-hour speech
 at the conference on 22 Novem-
 ber in which he attacked Khru-
 shchev personally, as had the
 Chinese delegate at the Bucha-
 rest conference.
 another
 committee was formed on 22 No-
 vember which includes the Soviet
 and Chinese parties and some of
 the nonbloc Communist parties.
 This committee may have been
 formed to draw up a new declara-
 tion based on whatever agree-
 ments have been reached to date.
 The Swiss Communist party
 has postponed a politburo meet-
 ing which was scheduled for 25
 November until 4 December, sug-
 gesting that the meetings will
 end by the 3rd.
 The Chinese apparently have
 not been alone in their defi-
 F                                                               of the Soviet party.           25X1
 the parties of four South Amer-
 ican countries are supporting
 the Chinese thesis in the debate
 in Moscow
 North Korea and North Vietnam
 "are in the  Chinese camp."
 Propaganda comment from these
 two countries, however, reflects
 a careful effort to maintain
 neutrality in the dispute.
 Such a position would be
 consistent with Ho Chi Minh's
 reported efforts to mediate be-
 tween Khrushchev and Mao. Recent
 North Korean speeches and edi-
 torials reflect considerable
 sympathy for Chinese hard-line
 oppositon to the United States,
 but keep a foot in the Soviet
 camp by accepting Soviet views
 on the possibility of preventing
 war.
 The Chinese delegation's
 stanchest ally at the Moscow
 meeting has been the Albanian
 delegation. Reflecting this
 strong support from the Alba-
 nians, the Chinese leaders, led
 by Mao Tse-tung, sent effusive
 greetings to Tirana on the oc-
 casion of the Albanian regime's
 16th anniversary. After praising
 the Albanian party for its ded-
 ication to Marxist-Leninist
 purity, the message says the
 Chinese are proud to have such
 "unyielding comrades-in-arms"
 and deeply appreciate the "enor-
 mous" support rendered to them
 by the Albanian people.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 In the same mood, Chou En-
 Lai told an Albanian anniversary
 reception in Peiping on 29 No
 vember that it is "particularly
 worth pointing out" that the
 Albanian people ruthlessly ex-
 ploded the shameless plot of US
 imperialism and its followers
 to slander and isolate China.
 He noted that in the past year
 "friendship and relations of
 mutual help and cooperation"
 have been consolidated between
 Albania and China, "sharing
 each other's weal and woe."
 This emphasis
 on
 the close
 alliance of China
 and
 Albania
 was heightened by
 the
 rare ap-
 pearance of Mao at
 the
 Peiping
 celebration.   Mao's presence at
 the Albanian reception was
 given priority in all Peiping
 newspapers on 30 November and,
 in another gesture of friend-
 ship, a commune in the Chinese
 capital was renamed the "Peace
 Sino-Albanian Friendship People's
 Commune."  For their part, the
 Albanians promised to remain
 China's "faithful friend."
 The Chou En-lai speech,
 Chinese articles and messages
 of greeting, and Albanian com-
 ment on the anniversary all
 stressed Tirana's struggle
 against Yugoslav "revisionism."
 In sharp contrast, the USSR, in
 an Izvestia article greeting
 Yugoslavia on its 28 November
 national day, was unusually flat-
 tering to Belgrade.   It pointed
 out that the two countries fol-
 low identical policies on some
 international questions,   and
 added that the USSR in the future
 will strive to develop further
 "good relations" with Yugoslavia.
 WEST - EAST GERMAN INTERZONAL TRADE DEVELOPMENTS
 Bonn has publicly  indi-
 cated it wants to explore the
 possibilities for a new agree-
 ment'on interzonal trade.  Ade--
 nauer's press chief Von Eckardt
 stated on 30 November that the
 talks would be conditional on
 the cessation of East German
 harassments on West German trav-
 el  to and within Berlin.   In
 a press interview on 12 Novem-
 ber, Chancellor Adenauer had
 stated that Bonn would be "flex-
 ible" on new negotiations, and
 suggested that if they were
 conducted intelligently, some
 advantage for Berlin access
 might be achieved.
 Bonn's position on the in-
 terzonal trade question has gen-
 erally been confused and inde-
 cisive, with reports of a sharp
 disagreement between the Eco-
 nomics Ministry and the Foreign
 Ministry.   Officials of the
 Economics Ministry reportedly
 favor the quick conclusion of
 a new agreement, even if the
 East Germans refuse to rescind
 the curbs on West German travel
 to and within Berlin, as origi-
 nally demanded by Bonn.   Foreign
 Ministry officials, however,
 argue that the lack of an agree-
 ment will give Bonn a free hand
 to retaliate against possible
 further East German harassments.
 Some officials in Bonn
 fear that failure to reach some
 understanding with the East

 Germans before the present inter-
 zonal trade agreement expires
 on 31 December will lead to se-
 rious East German interference
 with West German civilian access
 to the city.   The East Germans
 claim that since technical ar-
 rangements for West German ac-
 cess to the city are spelled
 out in the 1951 trade agreement,
 these provisions will be nulli-
 fied when the agreement :formally
 expires.
 On 17 November Carl Kraut-
 wig, a ministerial director in
 the West German Economics Minis-
 try,                   met; with East German offi-
 cials in an apparent attempt to
 sound out the East Germans on a
 resumption of negotiations.
 Krautwig's "informal talks" may
 indicate that Bonn is moving
 in the direction of higher level
 negotiations with the East Ger-
 mans.   Previously,  all negotia-
 tions have been handled by Kurt
 Leopold,  of the semiofficial  .
 "Trustee Office" in West Berlin
 --a device long used to avoid
 recognition of the East German
 regime.
 Leopold opposes raising the
 level of talks and submitted his
 resignation.in.protest against
 Krautwig's interference,  but
 later changed his mind.   It now
 has been  announced   that   he
 will   handle   the   new nego-
 tiations.
 Any change involving higher
 level negotiators would be a
 significant shift in Bonn's pol-
 icy, which in the past has stat-
 ed it would regard ministerial-
 level talks with the East Ger-
 mans as constituting de facto
 recognition of the Ulbricht
 regime.   Although the East Ger-
 mans have reportedly stated they
 would not seek to publicize the
 fact  of  ministerial-level
 negotiations,   there is little
 chance   that   negotiations   of
 this sort could long remain
 secret.
 East German officials, with
 Soviet backing, are attempting
 to build up a strong bargaining
 position for the Ulbricht regime
 in anticipation of negotiations
 for a renewal of the interzonal
 trade agreement.   Following the
 line previously set by Ulbricht
 and Foreign Trade Ainister Rau
 and seeking to take advantage of
 differences among West German
 officials concerning conduct of
 any negotiations, East German
 statements are emphasizing that
 negotiations with the West Ger-
 mans must be on the ministerial
 level and declaring that the
 West German representatives may
 not speak for West Berlin.   The
 regime meanwhile is intensifying
 its propaganda campaign, alleging
 that Bonn is intent on sabotaging
 German unity by threatening to
 break off trade and planning new
 measures to impede "normal" trav-
 el                                                              between East and West Germany.
 Khrushchev's promise to
 supply East Germany with any
 necessary raw materials and goods
 in l9dl in the event negotiations
 with the West Germans fail great-
 ly strengthens the East German
 position.   Soviet support is also
 designed to encourage the East
 Germans to maintain their demand
 that negotiations must be on the
 ministerial level.   The commu-
 niqud issued on 30 November after
 Soviet - East German talks in
 Moscow does not, however,  indicate
 whether the East Germans have had
 any success in obtaining promises
 of financial aid from the USSR,
 which would be needed to replace
 certain West German imports
 not available in the bloc.
 In an apparent effort to prod
 the Western powers to induce Bonn
 to hasten negotiations, Neues
 Deutschland on 27 November im-
 plied that the continued operation

 of Western military trains be-
 tween West Germany and Berlin
 is dependent on the interzonal
 trade agreement, since an annex
 of the agreement provides for
 payment by the West Germans for
 the services of  East German
 engineers and the use  of East
 German :Locomotives and railroad
 facilities by Allied military
 trains.   This reference which
 appears to be intentially
 vague and misleading, probably
 is also designed to remind  the
 Western powers of their vul-
 nerability to East German pres-
 sures on military access and
 to suggest that they might be
 forced to negotiate with East
 Germany for continuation  of
 military rail traffic.
 The regime is continuing
 its campaign to undercut  or
 evade  Western  restrictions
 on  the  grant  of  travel
 documentation  to East Germans
 by  the  Allied  Travel  Office
 in  West  Berlin.   Ulbricht
 reportedly  has  issued  orders
 that  East  German  personnel,
 including  trade  officials
 and  correspondents stationed
 in  Western Europe, will not
 be  permitted to  return  to
 East Germany for  vacations--
 even for Christmas--until  fur-

 to  East  German  officials  in    25X1
 Sweden.   East  German  personnel
 reportedly  have  raised  a
 strong  protest.
 The recurrent rioting whicL;
 began in Caracas on 25 November
 was promoted by pro-Castro oppo-
 sition elements and is probably
 part of a continuing campaign
 of violence to unseat President
 Betancourt.   The government,
 which suspended constitutional
 guarantees on 28 November and
 called in the army to assist
 other security forces, appears
 to have the unrest under con
 trol.   It closed the Communist
 daily press and the press of a
 Marxist faction involved in the
 disturbances and has arrested
 a large number of agitators.
 Betancourt,   who has  ex-
 pressed  his determination                       to
 take strong  action  against
 further agitation, is believed
 to have the backing of moderate
 political elements, most of the
 armed forces, and much of    or-
 ganized labor.
 The recent riots were
 touched off by an illegal strike
 of telephone workers  in  the
 capital and were  effectively
 spread there by leftist student
 and other groups.   The  unrest
 follows the withdrawal of.the
 pro-Castro Democratic Republican
 Union (URD) from the three-party
 coalition on 17 November and
 the serious 19-28 October anti-
 government outbreaks, whic$ the
 111W seemed to condone.   Betan-
 court reorganized his cabinet
 on 21 November, replacing    the
 former URD members with in-
 dependents.   Other incumbents
 were reappointed with the ex-
 ception of the minister  of fi-
 nance, who is expected :to ;become
 ambassador to the United States.
 A substantial portion of
 the URD, which dominates the
 union responsible for the illegal
 strike, now may have  allied
 openly with the pro-Castro Com-
 munist-leftist opposition, thus
 augmenting its potential  for
 provoking unrest.  Betancourt's

 opposition attacks derives from
 his economic problems, including
 high unemployment, depressed
 business conditions, a sizable
 budget deficit, a lowering of
 business confidence, and a
 critical decline of foreign
 exchange holdings which led to
 the imposition of exchange con-
 trols in early November.  The
 rioting has probably exacerbated
 some of these economic diffir
 culties and the new finance
 minister, pointing to the threat
 of pro-Castro groups, has stated
 that substantial US aid will be
 essential to Betancourt's
 survival
 The arrest and expulsion
 of two Cuban student agitators
 in Caracas just prior to the
 riots suggests that they may
 have been involved in organizing
 them.  The controlled Cuban
 press, increasingly critical of
 Betancourt: in recent weeks, re-
 newed its strident attacks on
 him after the arrests,  indicating
 that the long-widening rift in     25X1
 Cuban-Venezuelan relations may
 be approaching an open break.
 The, communique' issued on 24
 November at the conclusion of
 President Kekkonen's four-day
 visit to Moscow reaffirmed So-
 Viet approval of Finnish affilia-
 tion with the European Free Trade
 Association (EFTA) on condition
 that this would not prejudice
 the further development of So-
 viet-Finnish trade, which has
 long been based on the most-
 favored-nation principle.   The
 1961 trade protocol concluded
 at the same time provides for
 an increase of 7 to 9 percent
 in Soviet-Finnish trade,
 When Khrushchev was in Fin-
 land in September, Kekkonen
 raised the issue of Finnish as-
 sociation with EFTA  and
 Khrushchev indicated that final
 agreement ': could be reached dur-
 ing Kekkonen's November visit.
 Subsequently, Moscow insisted
 that not only Finland but all
 EFTA members grant the USSR most
 favored-nation treatment.   It
 apparently did not press this
 demand in the Moscow talks, how-
 ever.   The Finnish counselor
 told an American Embassy offi-
 cial in Moscow that Finland will
 ask for a general waiver from
 its Western trade partners so
 that it can give the USSR the
 same trade concessions it will
 grant to EFTA members.
 The Finns have requested a
 ministerial meeting of the Nordic
 countries in order to gain their
 support; and, despite strong
 reservations, the Scandinavians,
 particularly the Swedes, will
 support Finland vis-a-vis the
 other EFTA members in order to
 ensure Finland's economic--
 and political--ties with the
 West.

 there were no "insurmountable
 problems" existing between the
 USSR and any of these nations.
 The final communique, which
 was drafted by the Finns,  did
 not go beyond the usual endorse-
 ment of peaceful coexistence,
 complete and general disarmament,
 a nuclear test ban, and the need
 for keeping Northern Europe "out-
 side international tensions and
 differences."
 The Soviets, however, had
 presented four amendments, which
 the Finns refused to accept.
 First, Moscow requested a clause
 calling for keeping Northern
 Europe free from atomic weapons,
 in line with the campaign to
 increase the appeal of the So-
 viet "Baltic Sea of Peace" plan.
 The Finns also turned down a
 Soviet proposal for endorsement
 of a special UN General Assembly
 session on disarmament next
 spring attended by heads of gov-
 ernment.   In addition, they re-
 jected Soviet suggestions that
 the commungiue include refer-
 ences to the need for a UN re-
 organization and references to
 the immediate liquidation of the
 "vestiges of colonialism."
 As a gesture of support for
 Kekkonen's policy, Moscow agreed
 to reopen negotiations on the
 long-standing question of Finnish
 use of the Saimaa Canal.  The
 Soviet Union indicated that it
 is prepared to grant a 50-year
 lease on the Soviet portion of
 the canal, including a strip of
 land on each side, a concession
 it refused in 1958 when the is-
 sue was last raised.   It also
 offered to lease transshipment
 and storage facilities at the
 port of Vysotsk near Vyborg.
