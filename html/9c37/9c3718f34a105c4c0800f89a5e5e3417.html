 THE MIDDLE EAST
 Breakthrough on Disengagement
 I   Israeli forces began moving off the Suez
 Canal's west bank this week in implementation of
 the  Egyptian-Israeli disengagement agreement
 signed on January 18. During the 40-day dis-
 engagement period, the UN Emergency Force will
 establish a buffer zone several miles wide inside
 the Sinai Peninsula, to be flanked on each side by
 "security zones" for limited and lightly armed
 Egyptian and Israeli forces. The Egyptian area
 will be located between the canal and the UN
 zone; the Israeli area, between the UN forces and
 a point just west of the Sinai passes, thus leaving
 these in the full control of Israel's main force]
 I  Israeli military sources have said that the
 evacuation of the west bank salient will be under-
 taken in three stages, all to be completed by
 February 12. The entire disengagement process is
 to be completed no later than March 6. According
 to the Israelis, forces deployed on the Cairo-Suez
 road blocking access to the city of Suez and the
 Third Army will be evacuated first, probably
 within the week, and as each stage proceeds, UN
 forces will move in to replace the Israelis briefly
 before turning the areas back to the Egyptians.?
 5  IBoth sides made concessions to achieve the
 agreement. By accepting limitations on its forces
 and armament on the east bank, Egypt conceded
 its freedom to use recaptured territory as it sees
 fit. Israel, of course, has committed itself to with-
 draw from territory it has occupied for years, and
 it did not receive the firm assurance of an endur-
 ing peace it had apparently sought as an earnest
 of Egypt's sincerity in pursuing a negotiated
 settlement
 i 5- [Reaction to the disengagement agreement in
 the Arab world has ranged from Syria's pointed
 silence, through unenthusiastic acceptance by
 many of the peripheral states, to the severe
 opprobrium of Libya Iraq, and the majority of
 the fedayeen leaders ] fl he reaction is chiefly based
 ~' on widespread apprehension that Egypt intends
 to negotiate a unilateral settleme t with Israel, in
 disregard of over-all Arab interests

 carefully designed to reassure the Arabs about
 Egyptian intentions. The media and official state-
 ments, for instance, have repeatedly emphasized
 that the agreement is a military accord only and
 that a similar Syrian-Israeli disengagement should
 be negotiated before the full Geneva conference
 can be resumed. The Cairo media have also jabbed
 at Arab dissenters, calling for continued joint
 Arab action as the best assurance of progress
 toward Israeli withdrawals on other fronts.!
 Syria has been the chief target of the Egyp-
 tian efforts. Cairo can point to the disengagement
 agreement to refute charges from militant Arabs
 that only war can bring progress toward an Israeli
 withdrawal, but without Syrian support, Sadat's
 insistence that he is not pursuing solely Egyptian
 interests remains suspect. Syria is a key element,
 in the Egyptian view, in the continued success of
 negotiations, and Sadat has made a particular
 effort to convince the Syrians that he does not
 intend to leave Damascus or the other Arabs
 behind!

 7  )He is unlikely to make any decision, there-
 fore, on whether to turn over a POW list to Tel
 Aviv-an Israeli prerequisite for holding disengage-
 ment talks-until sometime after he receives a
 response to the suggestions he gave Secretary     25X1
 Kissinger to pass on to Israeli leaders. Indeed, he
 may wait for Secretary Kissinger to resume the
 shuttle diplomacy that brought the Egyptians and
 Israelis together[
 Syria's Reaction
 I f  anything,  the  Egyptian-Israeli  accord
 seems to have sharpened 'Syrian distrust of Egypt
 and deepened the divisions within the Asad
 regime between those opposed to negotiations
 with Israel and those at least willing to explore
 that path.)'In Damascus last weekend, Sadat en-
 countered deep skepticism among Syrian leaders,
 with the notable exception of President Asad,
 about Cairo honoring its commitments not to
 negotiate a separate peace settlement with Israel.
 Asad probably still hopes to attend the Geneva
 conference, but he is likely to play his cards very
 cautiously, not only to drive a hard bargain but to
 protect his own position'
 Fedayeen Disarray
 5 )The leaders of all the major fedayeen organi-
 zations but Fatah have criticized Egypt's willing-
 ness to get ahead of the other Arab states and the
 Palestinians by signing the disengagement agree-
 ment with Israel. Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion Chairman Arafat, sensitive to the need to
 cooperate with Egypt, is seeking, so far with little
 success, to moderate the statement denouncing
 the Egyptian initiative put out in the name of the
 organization's Executive Committee while he was
 in Cairo. Although he has been able to keep his
 followers within Fatah in line, Arafat has only

 ) ~  iSaiqa, the Syrian-supported fedayeen organi-

 ment accord or any Palestinian role in peace nego-
 tiations until Damascus does. The smaller and
 more radical organizations- whose policies often
 parallel those of Libya and Iraq-oppose the
 agreement as a sell-out of Palestinian interests.
 Facing this opposition, and caught between Egypt
 and Syria, Arafat is making little headway in his
 efforts to lead the Palestinians to the peace talks:]
 4 Talks between Labor and representatives of
 National  Religious Party have prompted
 cautious optimism among Alignment leaders that
 t he National  Religious Party will  ultimately
 soften its demands for legislation establishing
 rigid standards for conversion to Judaism. Such
 legislation is unacceptable to the Alignment. In
 return, the Labor Alignment is likely to agree to a
 policy statement which, although paralleling that
 of the existing government in almost all respects,
 leaves in abeyance official policy on the sensitive
 issue of withdrawal from the Israeli-occupied
 West Bank.

 more. The Soviets clearly would prefer to have all
 issues discussed and resolved at Geneva, where

 Moscow is therefore apparently attempting
 to force the focus of the negotiating efforts back
 to Geneva. Fahmi's arrival in Moscow on January
 21  has probably provided the Soviets an op-
 portunity to impress upon Fahmi their disap-
 pointment at having been excluded. Moscow may
 be using other means to put pressure on Cairo.
 For example, recent articles in Soviet-influenced
 Arab newspapers have denounced Egypt and the
 disengagement agreement for betraying the Arab
 cause.
 )The unanswered question is how tough Mos-
 cow is prepared to be with Sadat. If the issue
 between the two countries is only a question of
 Egypt's recognition of the proprieties, i.e., Mos-
 cow's desire to be part of the action, then re-
 turning the next stage of the negotiations to
 Geneva should get their relations on a more even
 keel. But if Moscow is determined to do what it
 can to forestall closer Egyptian-US relations and a
 continuing prominent US role in working toward
 a peace settlement, then tougher days lie ahead..
 ARAB OIL REVENUES
 ~,?   J~~4 kZC i=i ,~
 The Arab oil producers anticipate a $30?
 billion current account surplus this year, and have
 taken several preliminary steps since December to
 deal with their burgeoning reserve holdings:
 ? Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait, Abu  Dhabi,
 Qatar, Egypt, and Sudan formed an invest-
 ment company to finance Arab agriculture
 and shipping ventures;
 ? The Arab Bank of Jordan and a London
 merchant bank established a joint venture to
 assist Arab governments in channeling surplus
 oil funds into large-scale development pro-
 jects, such as oil refineries and manufacturing
 plants;
 ? Kuwaiti  quasi-public and  professional
 organizations  will  sponsor  a seminar  in
 Kuwait next month on investment of Arab
 surplus funds;
 ? Twenty-five Islamic nations are stepping
 up preparations to establish an Islamic Devel-
 opment Bank by April 1974;
 ? The Arab League agreed on January 23
 to set up a fund to speed economic develop-
 ment for African countries.
 These actions should markedly increase the
 amount of money directed to domestic Arab
 development. More Arabs will also inevitably be
 involved in development administration-an im-
 portant consideration in an area where foreigners
 are traditionally distrusted and where lack of
 trained personnel has been the greatest stumbling
 block in diverting investment to domestic devel-
 opment. Greater Arab cooperation in financial
 matters should also be a by-product, but because
 of basic differences in investment policy, the
 wealthier nations are unlikely to pool more than a
 small fraction of their assets. Western capital
 markets, therefore, will probably absorb the bulk
 of Arab funds.
 RE-OPENING THE SUEZ CANAL
 I; ,nL
 The Suez Canal Authority is ready to start
 clearing the canal whenever disengagement of
 Israeli and Egyptian forces is accomplished. The
 immediate problem is clearing the canal and its
 banks of unexploded munitions and sunken
 obstacles, which will probably take four to six
 months. At the same time, the canal will be
 dredged to shape the bottom and restore it to its
 pre-1967 depth. Best estimates indicate that the
 dredging portion of the project will also take four
 to six months. Silting, once thought to be a major
 problem in clearing the canal, appears to be less
 than previously estimated.

 The Egyptian Armed Forces will do most of

 unexploded munitions. The canal authority will
 use its own personnel to do the bulk of the
 dredging. Negotiations are in an advanced state
 with a consortium of two European firms, Ulrich
 Harms of West Germany and Brodospas of Yugo-
 slavia, to do the heavy work of raising and clear-
 ing obstacles in the canal and its approaches.
 Cairo has plans for widening and deepening
 the canal, but this depends on the canal being
 open, and even then would take several years to
 complete. Japanese Deputy Premier Miki recently
 promised Egypt $140 million in credits at very
 favorable terms to start the job, and has indicated

 The French decision to allow the franc to
 float independently has for the moment relieved
 France of the danger of incurring potentially dis-
 astrous reserve losses but adds to the economic
 and political disarray in the European Commu-
 nities. In addition to dealing a setback to long-
 established goals, such as economic and monetary
 union,  and  possibly  a  regional  development
 policy, the action gives West Germany the un-

 In the financial markets, the French decision

 ? European currencies declined sharply rel-
 ative to the dollar on Monday, then regained
 some of the losses as speculation subsided
 later in the week. The mark remained the
 strongest major European currency.
 ? Rome is apparently taking action to
 maintain a stable exchange rate with the franc
 at the rate it has held since mid-December.
 ? Since  the  Tokyo exchange reopened
 Wednesday the Japanese have sold over $700
 million to hold the dollar rate at 300 yen.
 Although the market calmed Thursday as a
 result of new credit restrictions imposed by
 Tokyo, a renewal of heavy speculation will
 probably force the Japanese to let the rate
 drift down further.
 Paris' move has already resulted in a sub-
 stantial de facto devaluation of the franc, which
 has declined 5 percent against the dollar and 4
 percent relative to the mark. Thus, the float will
 improve  Paris'  trade  competitiveness, one of
 France's principal goals, and protect its currency
 reserves.

 Since last summer Paris had lost about $3 billion
 in reserves in defending the franc. France also
 faces a $3-billion trade deficit in 1974 compared
 with a $1.5-billion surplus last year; Germany still
 anticipates a surplus this year.
 Paris' move also increases French flexibility
 in pursuing domestic economic policy goals. Cur-
 rency intervention had been reducing the French
 money supply and driving interest rates up. Now
 the French are free to use monetary policy-their
 main economic-policy tool-to head off an eco-
 nomic downturn if higher oil prices adversely
 affect employment and economic growth.
 In order to keep the franc from declining
 drastically, Paris apparently is prepared to inter-
 vene in moderate amounts-the Bank of France
 has reportedly sold about $330 million during the
 first four days of the float-and has moved to
 alleviate speculative pressure by tightening capital
 controls.

 ? Paris is also keeping the two-tier ex-
 change market to retain greater control over
 the exchange rate of the franc used in com-
 mercial transactions.
 The remaining members of the EC float in
 effect now constitute a "deutschemark zone," in
 which the mark is floating with six other cur-
 rencies. For Bonn, there is little difference be-
 tween this situation and Paris' controlled float.
 Germany's partners, however, are unlikely to be
 any more willing than the French to maintain
 fixed parities within the joint float if a drain is
 placed on their reserves or if exchange rates ap-
 preciate  too  much  relative  to  their  trading
 partners outside the float.
 Whatever its  success in meeting French
 policy objectives, the independent float has killed
 all hopes for movement toward monetary union
 based on the original conception-i.e., that the
 EC's narrow currency band would foster harmony
 in economic policy and lead to a strengthening of
 community institutions. Some members of the
 commission now recognize that it was a mistake
 to attempt closer monetary links before estab-
 lishing  greater  harmony  in  economic policy.
 French Finance Minister Giscard d'Estaing has
 said he will call for an EC meeting in July to
 discuss economic and monetary unification. With
 continuing uncertainties in the financial situation
 and little chance that the EC will reach agreement
 on policy harmonization by that time, the pros-
 pects for a new start toward monetary unification
 this summer remain bleak. Support may now be
 developing within the commission for sanctioning
 an independent float for all until the necessary
 measures can be developed to coordinate policies
 and goals.
 The  French move itself caught most EC
 members and the commission off guard. Although
 Chancellor Brandt and Finance Minister Schmidt
 were quick to announce that they understood the
 need for the measure, they expressed disappoint-
 ment at the adverse implications for European
 cooperation. The private reaction of German
 officials was more critical.
 Bonn is sure to resent the blatant disregard
 for community interest evident in the float and
 may want to re-examine its position on the re-
 gional fund dispute and common agricultural
 policy, in light of it.
 The French move was regarded by nearly all
 the seven remaining members of the float as
 symptomatic of the progressive deterioration of
 the EC as a stable monetary group. A Dutch
 official said the franc float had precipitated a
 crisis of confidence and set in motion an "un-
 raveling" process in the EC. Great Britain, on the
 other hand, probably believes that the French
 decision will relieve pressures on London to join
 the joint float.
 Senior EC Commission officials now feel it
 imperative that the community move to counter
 the  psychological  blow dealt by the French
 action. They feel that the cumulative effect of the
 float and the inability to proceed in other areas
 has seriously deepened community malaise. The
 commission  intends to bring the deteriorating
 state of affairs within the community to the at-
 tention of the member states and ask that they
 take a new look at their interests in the com-
 prehensive development of the community.
 The de facto creation of a deutschemark
 bloc, meanwhile, will tend to polarize further a
 community already badly split by self-interested
 French and British actions with respect to the oil
 problem.
 An early test of French influence will be
 provided  by community preparations for the
 Washington energy conference. French disregard
 for community interest on the monetary issue
 may make it easier for a common position to
 emerge    amon   members  opposed  to  Paris'
 views.                                           25X1

 VIETNAM: A QUIET T T
 ilitary action fel~ off shay ly durin  the
 three-day lunar new year festival.
 `\Bangkok last week had a bad case of the
 political jitters, sparked by unruly student dem-
 onstrations against Japan and the US and student-
 instigated law-breaking. During a recent press con-
 ference, Prime Minister Sariya replied to press
 criticism of the deterioration in law and order by
 offering to resign if the press believed his govern-
 ment was too weak]
 i'Sanya contributed to doubts about his abil-
 ity to cope with the situation-which are held by
 the conservative elite, and particularly the army
 officers-by indicating in private that he has little
 stomach for the pressures of the job and was
 prepared to step down if the King so desired.
 When the Prime Minister flew off to Chiang Mai
 over the weekend to consult with the King, many
 believed Sanya would return to Bangkok an ordi-
 nary citizerfl\lnstead, the Prime Minister returned
 to the capital armed with a tough statement link-
 ing the survival of his government to the passage
 of several key tax bills that the National Assem-
 bly  had  earlier  rejected. The Prime Minister
 strongly implied that his challenge to the assem-
 bly had the firm backing of the King. Sanya
 alluded to the King's advice on the measures that
 should be adopted in order to deal with the
 energy crisis. He also referred to the monarch's
 "interest" in recent student demonstrations-an
 oblique but still clear signal to the students to get
 off the streets and back into the classrooms.I
 \The episode is illustrative of the new politi-
 cal forces now at play in Thailand. In particular,
 it points up the King's new political status and his
 willingness to become deeply engaged in domestic
 affairs. When student pressures threatened the
 stability of the government, it was the King's
 support, not the military's, that proved crucial.
 For the time being, at least, army chief Krit
 Sivara appears content to defer to the King's
 wishes  and  remain  on  the  political  side-

 c.f-0 [Negotiations on a new coalition government
 may soon gather momentum. Prime Minister
 Souvanna, in a private conversation with visiting
 USIA Director Keogh on January 20, said he now
 expects the new government to be formed early
 next  month.  Souvanna  indicated  that  Soth
 Phetrasy, chairman of the Lao Communist delega-
 tion to the Joint Central Commission to Imple-
 ment the Agreement, informed him late last week
 that chief political negotiator Phoun Sipraseuth
 would soon be returning to Vientiane with a list
 of Pathet Lao ministers for the new government.
 Phoun left Vientiane for consultations in Sam
 Neua on January 16J
 }C'   For weeks, the Prime Minister has been
 pressing his half-brother, Lao Communist leader
 Prince Souphanouvong, to submit such a roster as
 a means of helping move the negotiations off
 dead center, but up to now these requests had
 fallen on deaf ears in Sam Neua. Souvanna's new
 optimism is in marked contrast to the gloom he
 had exhibited in earlier discussions with senior US
 officials in Vientiane?
 In another encouraging development, Soviet
 Ambassador Vdovin departed Vientiane January
 19 for Hanoi and Sam Neua. Vdovin promised US
 Ambassador Whitehouse that he would discuss US
 policy objectives in Laos, including North Viet-
 namese  troop  withdrawals,  with  North Viet-
 namese and Lao Communist leaders and attempt
 to convince them that Souvanna was negotiating
 LI  in good faith. Vdovin had earlier acknowledged to
 the US ambassador that the Pathet Lao were
 responsible for the delay in implementing the Lao
 accords, and that he intended to do everything
 possible to facilitate political negotiations on a
 new coalition government. He also predicted that
 the Pathet Lao would change their negotiating
 tactics early in 1974 and agree to begin serious
 ~Cdiscussions on a new government. His visit to Sam
 Neua marks the first time since 1969 that a Soviet
 ambassador has traveled to the Lao Communist
 headquarters.?
 9c-- (Government  and  Lao  Communist  nego-
 tiators at the working level have also made limited
 progress in resolving some of the difficult prob-
 lems associated with the neutralization of Vien-
 tiane and Luang Prabang. Both sides have agreed
 in principle on the size, duties, and prerogatives
 of the "joint protective military forces" called for
 in the neutralization of the twin capitals, but
 there has been no meeting of the minds on the
 question of "joint police forces" for the two
 cities-a sticking point that has hamstrung delib-
 erations in the Joint Central Commission for
 several weeks.

 decided therefore to crack clown on all dissent-

 cluding many students and intellectuals. Campus
 political activity is banned, and six newspapers
 have been closed temporarily)
 Jakarta students are quiet for the moment,
 stunned by the violence spawned by their demon-
 strations, but the government fears that students
 in other cities may see the riots as an exhibition
 of student power and try to further the cause.
 The press reported on January 21 that some
 1,000 university students gathered in Bandung,
 West Java, to protest new government strictures
 on campus political activity. The local security
 chief subsequently  imposed censorship on all
 local newspapers "to ensure security and order."

 of important members of the ruling elite are un-

 are being issued to curtail the lavish lifestyle of
 government officials. The government has also
 promised a new policy on foreign investment to
 encourage projects that benefit indigenous busi-

 riots will affect the budding student movement.
 The violence was a sobering experience for stu-

 measures against political activity will provide an

 ~    IMoscow's token retaliation for the expulsion
 of three Soviet diplomats and their wives from
 Peking last week indicates that the USSR does
 not want to risk a further deterioration of Sino-
 Soviet relations. The language of the Soviet pro-
 test and the expulsion of only one Chinese diplo-
 mat reveal that Moscow would like the episode to

 Moscow is preparing
 to return its chief negotiator to the border talks
 at Peking after an absence of more than six
 months.
 Politburo, it is likely that the Soviets had stepped
 up their intelligence gathering activities in Peking.
 If the incident was merely trumped up, it may be
 part of Peking's effort to focus popular attention
 on the alleged "threat from the north," a per-
 sistent propaganda theme since the Chinese party
 congress in August. In any event, the Soviet
 response was minimal; the Chinese diplomat ex-
 pelled in retaliation, for example, was already en
 route to Peking, having completed a six-year tour        25X1
 in Moscow. I
 fThe imbroglio began on January 15 when
 the  Chinese  arrested  the  Soviet  diplomats,
 charged them with espionage, and put them on a
 plane for Moscow four days later. They were not
 permitted to contact the Soviet Embassy during
 this period. On January 16, police in Peking were
 still stopping traffic near one of the diplomatic
 compounds in a search for "Soviet revisionists."
 Moscow's protest note, delivered on January 21,
 claimed that the five Soviets were subjected to
 "barbaric treatment" and charged that the in-
 cident was a "carefully planned hostile act against
 the USSR." The note also said, however, that
 further consequences of the affair would rest with
 China, suggesting that no further actions against
 Peking are currently contemplated.(
 fin view of the recent transfer of military
 commanders in China and the return of former
 party secretary general Teng Hsiao-ping to the
 Irhis Soviet restraint comes as no surprise.
 Even during the worst excesses of China's Cul-
 tural Revolution, particularly the two-week siege
 of the Soviet Embassy in 1967, Moscow resolved
 to hold on in Peking as long as it could. Now that
 the Soviets are trying to project an image of
 accommodation and good will toward China, they
 are evidently determined to contribute as little as
 possible to the Sino-Soviet polemic."?
 ,iii   IAnother  possible  reason  for  Moscow's
 restraint may rest in its current effort to organize
 an international communist conference. Several
 prominent Communist parties are already op-
 posed to such a conference on the grounds that it
 would be no more than a Soviet forum for institu-
 tionalizing the Sino-Soviet dispute. A further
 deterioration of the dispute would give additional
 parties-particularly  in  Asia-ample  reason  to
 boycott any communist meeting.

 TUNISIA-LIBYA: MARKING TIME
 L s~Lc)   /
 Tunisian President Bourgia departed for)
 Geneva on January 19 for a medical checkup and
 several weeks of rest, leaving behind the recent
 merger fiasco with Libya. In his absence, Prime
 Minister Nouira, Nouira's deputy, and the interior
 minister-all opponents of the plan-will be the
 key leaders. They will continue to pay lip-service
 to the idea of union with Libya as they proceed
 with delaying tactics designed to let down gently
 both President Qadhafi and those Tunisians who
 favor union.
 Nouira has already launched a public cam-
 paign that stresses the need for a step-by-step
 fulfillment of the numerous pre-conditions for
 unity that his government set forth last week.
 Nouira's sttempt to convey the impression that
 Tunisia  still  supports  the  union reflects the
 apparent government position that Bourguiba's
 agreement to the union should not be publicly
 rescinded.
 Although Tunisian authorities are still con-
 cerned about adverse reactions from domestic
 pro-union groups, there have been no significant
 disturbances. Students and workers whose expec-
 tations of new job opportunities in Libya have
 been dashed, however, are believed to be sharply
 disappointed.
 The union affair has intensified the long-
 standing political rivalry between Prime Minister
 Nouira and the recently dismissed foreign min-
 ister, Mohamed Masmoudi. Nouira played a key
 role in convincing Bourguiba to back away from
 the  merger,  which  Masmoudi  and  Qadhafi
 apparently worked together to arrange. The fiasco
 has dealt at least a short-term setback to Mas-
 moudi, but he remains on the political bureau of
 the  ruling Destourian Socialist Party and is
 making efforts to preserve his position.
 There still has been no official comment
 from Libya since Tunisia began to back away
 from the union agreement. The nationwide
 referendum-originally scheduled for last week-
 was canceled by Tripoli without explanation, in
 an  apparent effort to avoid further political
 embarrassment. Libyan media continue to give
 low-key coverage to the unity scheme, but no
 mention has been made of joint preparations or a
 future referendum date. Never enthusiastic about
 the  merger,  the  Libyan  public  has  quietly
 accepted the entire affair, which many apparently
 view as one more of Qadhafi's earnest but fruit-
 less                                                                              efforts  to  promote  Arab  unity.

 NEW UNCERTAINTIES
 kAs Indian farmers harvested a bumper rice
 crop last fall, it appeared that better days lay
 ahead for Prime Minister Gandhi. It is evident
 now, however, that India's continuing economic
 problems, recently aggravated by the oil shortage,
 have  increased  popular  discontent  with  her
 party's rule.
 Earlier  this month, the  Ruling Congress
 Party was shaken by four by-election defeats in
 Maharashtra State, heretofore a party stronghold.
 Coupled with a wave of anti-government dem-
 onstrations in many areas, these defeats have
 party leaders worried about what may be in store
 next month when four states and a union terri-
 tory elect new legislatures.
 The swell of popular discontent and the re-
 sulting swing against her party have probably
 come as a shock to Mrs. Gandhi and her sup-
 porters. The fall harvest hadl been expected to
 alleviate the serious food shortages that followed
 the weak monsoon of 1972. Many farmers, how-
 ever, have refused to sell their crops to the gov-
 ernment for re-sale in "fair-price" shops and are
 either hoarding or selling on the open market
 where they can get higher prices. Food at con-
 trolled prices thus remains scarce. Other essential
 commodities, such as kerosene and cooking oil,
 have also become increasingly hard to obtain, and
 the government has raised gasoline prices 70 per-
 cent in order to reduce consumption.
 The most important of the five approaching
 z3iections is in the north-central state of Uttar
 Pradesh. With a population of 90 million, it is
 India's largest state and is Mrs. Gandhi's home
 base. Since its last legislative election in 1969, the
 Mate has been run by a series of shaky admin-
 istrations with interludes of direct rule from New
 Delhi. The Prime Minister is qoing all out to win
 this one, beginning with her  installation  last
 November of an interim government controlled
 by the Ruling Congress party. She has also pro-
 vided ample food stocks and a multitude of cen-
 !rally funded development projects, and is making
 numerous personal appearances.
 Victory in Uttar Pradesh seemed assured-
 until the Maharashtra debacle demonstrated the
 depth of public disenchantment with the Ruling
 Congress.  The  party's electoral  prospects are
 further threatened by two particularly disgruntled
 groups in Uttar Pradesh, the untouchables and the
 Muslims. Either group or both may withhold their
 customary support on the grounds that the gov-
 ernment has not provided adequate safeguards
 against discrimination by caste Hindus.
 At this time, Mrs. Gandhi still remains un-
 challenged as a national leader. Her government
 does not face re-election until 1976, and as yet
 there are no indications that a viable alternative
 to her party and its programs is in the making.
 Nevertheless, it is clear that the Prime Minister's
 image has been tarnished and that a more ef-
 fective performance by her administration will be
 required if she is to escape more serious political
 consequences-1

 Dissatisfaction with the capabilities of Soviet

 for possible alternatives. Lack of sufficient for-
 eign exchange, however, has forced New Delhi to
 postpone plans to purchase any Western air-
 GREECE BESET BY ECONOMIC WOES
 One of the legacies of the ousted Papa-
 dopoulos  regime  was  a developing economic
 crisis. Soaring inflation and a deteriorating bal-
 ance of payments are being aggravated by sharp
 rises in wages and import prices-most notably for
 oil-and by a too rapid expansion of the money
 supply. Wholesale prices increased by nearly 50
 percent last year, cutting deeply into workers'
 real income.
 The trade deficit rose to $1.8 billion
 for the first nine months of 1973, compared with
 $1 billion in the corresponding period of 1972;
 the over-all payments balance dropped by nearly
 $400 million. The regime will find it difficult to
 redress the trade imbalance because Greece
 imports the major portion of the machinery and
 raw materials needed by its industries as well as
 all of its crude oil. These commodities, for which
 there is little possibility of substituting domesti-
 cally produced goods, constitute nearly 60 per-
 cent of Greece's import bill. Because of the
 seriousness of the trade deficit, the government
 reportedly is considering an austerity program
 that would force cutbacks in public investment
 and  reduced  imports of foodstuffs and  non-
 essential consumer goods.
 In recent years, Greece's large trade deficit
 has been covered by remittances from Greek
 citizens working abroad, earnings from shipping
 and tourism, and by capital inflows. As a result of
 the energy crisis, however, these receipts are
 likely  to  stagnate  or  decline this  year.  An
 economic recession in Western Europe, partic-
 ularly in West Germany, could reduce worker
 remittances substantially below the nearly $600
 million recorded in  1972. In West Germany,
 where 270,000 Greek workers remit nearly $300
 million annually, officials are no longer issuing
 new permits to workers from non-EC countries.
 Should Europe suffer a serious recession, nearly
 200,000 Greeks might have to be repatriated,
 resulting in a serious labor surplus in Greece.
 Earnings  from  tourism  will  grow  more
 slowly in 1974, as rapidly increasing prices have
 reduced the cost advantages of vacationing in
 Greece. The impact of oil price rises and supply
 problems on the cost and availability of inter-
 national  travel, as well as sagging incomes in
 countries experiencing economic slowdown, will
 also cut into tourism.
 The aura of political instability created by
 the coup also will discourage investment. Much
 foreign investment in Greece has been based on
 the potential profitability of combining cheap
 local labor with preferential access to the EC
 market. But in 1973, the government permitted
 wages, under pressure from prices, to climb by
 about 20 percent. Substantial wage hikes this year
 are inevitable, further cutting the cost advantage
 for industrial investment in the country.
 The bleak forecast for the economy will do
 nothing to aid the regime's efforts to create a
 "new" Greece. Economic stresses at the consumer
 level are bound to be blamed on the government,
 as consumers make adverse comparisons between
 the present and preceding regimes. Public dis-
 satisfaction will probably be muted-at least for
 the short run-because of press censorship and the
 harsh penalties that the government has been
 meting  out  to  critics  of  its policies.

 the shortages and inflated prices come at a
 time when Banzer can ill afford a new political
 challenge. Many of his former supporters-both in
 the military and in the two main political par-
 ties-have gone into some form of opposition.
 The President recently exiled former president
 Victor Paz Estenssoro, the nation's most pres-

 the contest, a factor that may work to the advan-
 tage of the governing National Liberation Party's
 presidential candidate, Daniel Oduber. He must
 win a plurality of 40 percent in the eight-candi-
 date race or face a run-off in April. Oduber's
 strategists, after some initial doubts, are confident
 of victory on the first ballot(
 Oduber  has  pursued  an  intellectual  ap-
 proaVh, dryly describing the nation's problems
 and explaining how he and his party propose to
 cope with them. He has divorced himself as much

 the minor candidates.(
 Of the lesser candidates, only two stand a
