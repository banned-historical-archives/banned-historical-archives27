 Key Judgments   The Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party's 12th Central
 Information available Committee met 20 October to endorse a comprehensive "Decision on
 as ofI November 1984 Reform of the Economic Structure." If.fully implemented, the economic
 was used in this report.
 system most likely to emerge would rely on free market regulation to a de-
 gree unmatched elsewhere in the Communist world, with the possible
 exception of Hungary. Nevertheless, the economy will remain essentially
 socialist.
 The Central Committee's decision gave the party's political affirmation to
 structural changes that Chinese economic reformers have been advocating
 since late 1978. In principle, the plenum endorsed plans to:
 ? Reduce the scope of mandatory production plans and increase the role of
 guidance plans to enable enterprises to respond to market signals.
 ? Remove government and party institutions from the day-to-day business
 operations.
 ? Force enterprises formerly run by the state to become independent
 economic entities, competing against each other for profits, while main-
 taining tight state control over production and distribution of essential
 commodities and over most investment decisions.
 ? Allow enterprise management a greater measure of decisionmaking
 authority over hiring and firing, wages and bonuses, and even prices.
 ? Institute a rational price system to convey market information to
 enterprises.
 Deng Xiaoping, his heir apparent Hu Yaobang, and Premier Zhao Ziyang
 emerged as the clear political winners at the plenum. Ideas that Hu
 defended last year in the face of political opposition are the official line of
 the party. Party conservatives-such as Chen Yun-seem to have acqui-
 esced in decisions that appear as a policy defeat for them. Other
 institutional winners and losers will emerge more clearly during the
 implementation period next year.
 We believe the reformist wing of the party pushed hard to formalize the
 commitment to reform while the 80-year-old Deng is still active and at the
 peak of his powers. In our view, they probably also were impelled by fears
 that if they did not expand reform:
 ? Strong agricultural performance of the last three years might not be
 sustained.
 ? The technological revolution ongoing in the West might leave China
 permanently behind.
 ? Piecemeal reform would lead to multiple failures.

 The implementation stage will be the first major test of China's reconsti-
 tuted bureaucracy. We believe that critics of the reforms will attempt to
 slow policy implementation through a wide variety of bureaucratic subter-
 fuges. Resistance will come both from leaders threatened by Beijing's call
 for younger, more educated managers and from ideologues who view the
 entire reform program as heretical and too pro-Western.
 Economic problems will also threaten reform. We believe that the leader-
 ship's desire to institute rational prices is both the key to the success of the
 entire reform program and its greatest threat. The shortage-driven econo-
 my is susceptible to potentially destabilizing bouts of panic buying and
 bank runs. Shutdowns of noncompetitive enterprises, if not carefully
 managed, could also weaken the industrial base and create unemployment.
 Beijing clearly recognizes both the potential gains and dangers of price
 reform and will move rapidly but deliberately in implementing changes.
 Because of the leadership's sensitivity to destabilizing price pressures, we
 believe the risk that it will move too slowly, and stall the entire reform
 package, is greater than the risk that too rapid an advance will spark
 economic instability. Some inflation should be expected as price adjust-
 ments work their way through the system, but we do not anticipate any
 long-term spiraling in prices.
 Even if Beijing manages to weather its inevitable short-term problems,
 Deng's death or a combination of other setbacks-such as floods, drought,
 a succession of poor harvests, or a rapid rise in undesirable side effects of
 economic expansion (double-digit inflation, for example)-could over the
 longer term tip the political scales against reform and lead to a retreat. We
 believe the party would pay a political price as it sought to reassert its con-
 trol down to the local level. Party leadership would again be seen as
 vacillating and unconcerned with the common welfare, precisely the image
 it seeks to dispel by implementing new policies. There might also be a
 prospect for active resistance by disaffected peasants or workers. The
 failure of reform would almost certainly presage a protracted period of
 political instability, as leaders struggled to fix the blame.

 CnnfidPntial
 In our view, China is well positioned economically to survive the problems
 that will occur in the course of this most ambitious step in reform. Earlier
 policy changes have raised the agricultural sector to new heights in
 productivity. China's balance-of-payments position is among the world's
 strongest. Moreover, much of the fiscal and monetary framework necessary
 to control the more market-oriented system is in place.
 Over the long run, we judge that the urban reform package will boost
 industrial productivity, albeit at a slower pace than experienced in the
 agricultural sector. The party is allowing itself five years to get the
 program in place and probably will hail even minor improvements in
 efficiency during that period as evidence of success. Nevertheless, the next
 year will provide a critical test of Beijing's willingness to accept the
 dislocations necessary to carry its plans through.
 Successful implementation of the reform package will work to broaden
 China's ties with the West, creating new opportunities for investment and
 trade. We believe the reforms will have limited short-term effect on
 relations with Moscow. The Soviets have taken a cautious public approach
 to China's reforms-though they are privately critical-because of the
 sensitivity of such issues in Eastern Europe and within the USSR itself.
 Failure of the reforms would probably have a negative impact on China's
 open-door policy and could present Moscow with an opportunity to press
 for improved relations. Even in the face of economic setbacks, however,
 China's foreign policy will be dictated primarily by strategic security
 considerations.

 China's Economic Reforms:
 Charting a Risky Course F
 Introduction
 The Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist
 Party's 12th Central Committee convened for a single
 day on 20 October to endorse a sweeping "Decision on
 Reform of the Economic Structure." The Central
 Committee's decision was a comprehensive statement
 of China's economic policy that, if implemented as
 planned over the next five years, will change the face
 of Chinese socialism. The economic system most
 likely to emerge will mix free market regulation with
 Soviet-style planning in a fashion similar to that of
 Communist Hungary, Eastern Europe's pacesetter in
 innovative economic reforms.' Although advocates of
 reform, led by the 80-year-old Deng Xiaoping, have
 won a signal victory in gaining Central Committee
 approval of their program, they still face formidable
 hurdles-including probable administrative confu-
 sion, economic dislocation, and bureaucratic resist-
 ance-in implementing their controversial measures.
 The plenum was preceded by six days of "preparatory
 meetings," at which the Decision was presumably
 explained in detail to various constituencies. We do
 not believe it was significantly altered during these
 meetings. Aside from the Decision on reform, the
 brief plenum produced two other documents: a terse
 communique that summarized the work of the meet-
 ing and a decision to convene a "National Conference
 of Party Delegates" in September 1985. The plenum
 set a two-item agenda for next year's conference:
 discussion and adoption of proposals concerning Chi-
 na's Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90), and selection
 of additional members of the Central Committee plus
 "other organizational matters." According to the
 communique, all three plenum documents were ap-
 proved unanimously.
 The Document
 The Decision is a bold and risky attempt to come to
 grips with fundamental problems of the Chinese
 economy. It unquestionably is the strongest affirma-
 tion the party has ever made of its support for reform
 and is the economic benchmark of the Deng Xiaoping
 era. Nevertheless, the plenum document is not-as
 implied in the Western press-an unanticipated de-
 parture for economic policy nor is it a surprising
 announcement of some historic new trend, that is, the
 reintroduction of capitalism. Rather, it represents
 both an acceleration of the reform drive that began in
 December 1978 with the third plenum of the 11th
 Central Committee and a deepening of the shift,
 introduced at the May 1984 National People's Con-
 gress, away from the earlier emphasis on rural policy
 and toward urban reform. With the party's endorse-
 ment, the reform process will be accelerated and its      25X1
 scope will encompass a greater portion of the Chinese
 economy.
 The document begins by citing four characteristics of
 China's Soviet-style economic structure that drained
 enterprises of their initiative and vitality:
 ? The lack of clear distinction between functions of
 government and industry.
 ? "Excessive and rigid" state control.
 ? An inadequate role for prices and markets.
 ? The practice of "absolute egalitarianism."
 It demands the creation of a "new socialist economic
 structure with Chinese characteristics." What Beijing
 envisions is an economic structure where major assets
 continue to be state owned, but where enterprise
 managers are free to respond in a competitive way to
 market signals. In the words of the document, the
 party seeks to create a system where "ownership can
 be duly separated from the power of operation."

 A New Relationship Between Government and Enter-
 prise. The structural changes called for in the Deci-
 sion are basically intended to remove the state and
 party from most day-to-day business decisions. To
 accomplish this, the entire national economic plan-
 ning apparatus will be revamped. Strict mandatory
 plans, which previously dictated production and allo-
 cation quotas for most sectors of the economy, will
 now be applied only where essential commodities are
 involved.' According to the Decision, "other products
 and economic activities, which are far more numer-
 ous, should either come under guidance plans or be
 left entirely to the operation of the market."
 Guidance plans are to be "rough and flexible" guide-
 lines on how much of each particular good the state
 deems desirable. Enterprises will be required to give
 first consideration to these plans, but, where local
 conditions make implementation of guidance plans
 unreasonable-for example, because of energy short-
 ages or peculiarities in supply and demand-the firms
 will be free to deviate from plan without penalty.
 Enforcement of guidance plans will be accomplished
 mainly through the use of economic levers such as
 interest rates, bank lending policies, and taxes.
 Enterprise management responsibilities under the ple-
 num plan are to be greatly expanded. Specifically,
 most enterprises are expected to become "relatively
 independent economic entities," responsible for their
 own profits and losses. Not only will they have more
 control over what and how much they produce and
 over their finances, they will also have authority-
 within as yet undefined limits-to hire and fire
 workers, to set wages and bonuses, and even to set
 product prices.
 Although the new program calls for a weakening of
 the role played by state bureaucracies, their power
 nevertheless remains significant. By any objective
 standard, China will remain socialist in its essentials.
 In addition to the continued importance of the central
 planning apparatus and strict control over products of
 national importance, the state will continue to appoint
 ' China recently published a list of essential commodities, which
 included coal, oil and petroleum products, steel, nonferrous metals,
 timber, cement, chemicals, electricity, munitions, and other items.
 Agricultural products on the list included cereals, cotton, edible
 and remove key enterprise managers and hence to
 exert a powerful, if indirect, influence on production
 decisions. Moreover, when enterprises experience fi-
 nancial problems, it is the state that will determine
 which firms will be subsidized, and which will be
 forced to merge or shut down.
 Price Reform-The Key to Success. The plenum
 brought to an end the party's unwillingness to come to
 grips with China's most serious economic problem,
 irrational prices. Until now Chinese leaders have been
 reluctant to advocate major price reform for fear of
 sparking potentially destabilizing inflation, hoarding,
 and speculation. The plenum document explicitly
 recommends establishment of a "rational price sys-
 tem," calling it the key to reform of the entire
 economic structure. The fact that Beijing hopes to
 have its now totally irrational price system corrected
 in only five years is an indication of the party's
 commitment to rapid reform
 To carry out its program, Beijing will gradually
 reduce the number of items subject to state-set fixed
 prices. Most product prices will be allowed to fluctu-
 ate-according to changes in supply and demand-
 within narrow bands set by the state. Floating prices
 will be used for a small number of consumer products
 and for most services provided by individual entrepre-
 neurs. For essential goods, the state will retain tight
 control, but major adjustments are probable even here
 as Beijing attempts to bring its raw material and
 energy prices into line with the current world econom-
 ic situation.'
 Recognizing the sensitivity of the local population to
 price changes-many Chinese remember the hyperin-
 flation of the late 1940s-Beijing's plans for rational-
 izing prices are cautious. The plenum document em-
 phasizes that price reform will be implemented
 "gradually, in a step-by-step" fashion. It promises
 that "the real income of urban and rural inhabitants
 will not go down as a result of price readjustments."
 The document also warns potential entrepreneurs that

 Confidential
 it is "absolutely impermissible for any unit or person
 to boost prices at will by taking advantage of the
 reform."
 Absence of Dogma. The Decision is starkly lacking in
 standard Marxist or Maoist points of reference and
 will strike some doctrinaire party veterans as very
 questionable ideology. In an attempt to undercut such
 criticism, the drafters use a combination of argument
 and assertion to persuade readers that the new policies
 will achieve "socialism with Chinese characteristics."
 The document, which is markedly defensive in some
 passages, justifies its conclusions ideologically by re-
 defining what is socialist. For example, to account for
 labor and commodity policies that smack of capital-
 ism, the document asserts that, at its current stage of
 development, China needs a "socialist commodity
 economy." The essence of socialism, the Decision
 argues, lies in the public ownership of the means of
 production, and not in such things as rigid central
 planning or egalitarianism. We believe the weakness
 of the Decision's ideological foundation will require
 the party to defend it frequently against both internal
 and foreign critics. The Chinese are acutely sensitive
 to the charge that the reforms constitute a return to
 "the capitalist road.'
 The Decision also supports other controversial re-
 forms on Deng's agenda: China's opening to the West,
 the promotion of intellectuals and professionals, and
 new standards for performance of party members. By
 tying these policies directly to economic reform, Deng
 seems to be telling his supporters, some of whom may
 disagree on specific points, that the program is all or
 nothing
 A Matter of Timing
 Now or Never. Facing an already ambitious political
 and economic agenda, why did Deng and his allies
 choose this time to move across so broad a front? We
 believe that the urgency behind these latest steps
 springs from a perceived need to do as much as
 possible while Deng is physically able to remain
 personally involved. For all his intentions to emplace a
 durable leadership to succeed him, Deng, now 80,
 remains the key player in China's leadership. Al-
 though Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, standing at
 the pinnacle of the party and state bureaucracies, are
 powerful figures in their own right and have been
 heavily involved in overall reform policy formulation,
 neither commands the loyalty of Deng's following or
 enjoys Deng's preponderant authority and prestige.
 Reform can proceed without Deng, but the way will
 be more hazardous.
 The Chinese leadership has been strikingly frank in
 assessing the controversial nature of the Decision. For
 example, Hu Yaobang, while maintaining that "the
 overwhelming majority of our comrades will be elated
 and inspired," noted at one of the preparatory meet-
 ings that not everyone would agree with the Decision
 because of the "varying depth of understanding and
 different interests at stake." In our view, Hu's state-
 ment is unusually realistic in admitting the role of
 interests-personal, institutional, or otherwise-in de-
 termining individual opinion
 Hu's statement also epitomizes the confidence of
 Deng and his allies. They have said publicly that some
 cadre may "trail behind" in their understanding of
 reform, and that, as long as they did not actually
 oppose reform, they would be given time to study and
 catch up. It seems evident that Deng and Hu believe
 the rectification of party and government leadership
 groups-generally complete at the provincial level
 and continuing locally-has been successful. Late last
 summer Hu told foreign visitors that a million offi-
 cials had already retired and by yearend a million
 more would go. In our view, this leadership turnover is
 a key prerequisite for successfully implementing the
 controversial economic reforms.

 inevitably will arise from the planned overhaul of the

 service ratio is under 6 percent, and Beijing has
 gradually depreciated its currency to a point that
 should discourage enterprises from abusing their new-
 found import autonomy.
 Moreover, much of the fiscal and monetary frame-
 work necessary to control the more market-oriented
 system is nearly in place.4 The tax system began a
 final stage of overhaul on 1 October. Most enterprises
 no longer remit profits to the state, but instead pay a
 regular income tax that Beijing can alter to influence
 economic behavior. The banking system has also seen
 major changes that enable it to better control the
 more flexible economic structure. Earlier this month
 Beijing announced that the central bank-the Peo-
 ple's Bank of China-is now allowing local banks to
 retain a larger portion of their own reserves and to
 borrow from, or lend to, other banks. Bank loans are
 rapidly replacing government allocations as the main
 outside source of investment funds for enterprises. In
 addition, interest charges are for the first time making
 enterprises sensitive to the cost of money. We believe
 these reforms put the central bank in a stronger
 position to control the nation's money supply
 The Economic Imperative. Although the conditions
 necessary for change have been improving, the pres-
 sure to do so has also been mounting. According to
 leading Chinese economists, the immediate rationale
 for moving ahead was concern about the drag that the
 urban economy is placing on progress in the rural
 sector. Recent Chinese press accounts indicate that
 grain stocks are building and sometimes rotting in the
 countryside because China's commercial and trans-
 portation network is incapable of handling the in-
 creased output. Peasants reportedly are experiencing
 difficulty turning their increased earning power into
 consumption because of the inadequate flow of con-
 sumer goods from urban to rural areas. Both problems
 may already be cutting into peasant willingness to
 push for further agricultural gains.
 The failure of earlier reforms to generate productivity
 gains in industry is also exacerbating China's energy
 problems. Chinese economists realize that without
 sharp improvements in industrial efficiency the goal
 of quadrupling output by the year 2000 is unattain-
 able. Power shortages reportedly idle 20 percent of
 production capacity, yet Chinese industry continues to
 use three and a half times more energy to produce a
 unit of industrial output than does the average LDC.
 The reformers appear to believe that only by forcing
 managers to face a competitive environment with
 rising energy prices can efficiency gains be achieved.
 The Leadership Picture
 The party characteristically sought to convey an
 impression of unity at the October meeting. Of the six
 members of the Politburo Standing Committee, only
 Ye Jianying, who reportedly is very ill, failed to
 attend. The remaining five, including Chen Yun in a
 rare public appearance, collectively presided over the
 meeting. Marshal Nie Rongzhen-85 and ailing-
 was the only other member of the Politburo and
 Secretariat who failed to turn out.
 Although Chen Yun has yet to comment publicly, we
 tentatively conclude that the plenum was a policy
 defeat for him and other party conservatives. Many of
 the Decision's pronouncements on such topics as
 economic balance, investment priorities, and control
 of inflation bear Chen's imprint, but these are issues
 on which there is much agreement in the party. The
 Decision goes considerably beyond Chen on the cru-
 cial issue of central control and seems to disavow his
 insistence on finely detailed planning as the founda-
 tion for the macroeconomy. We believe Chen's con-
 spicuously low public profile since the waning of the
 spiritual pollution campaign gives credence to rumors
 that he in some way was linked to mistakes at that
 time or that he is no longer well enough to press his
 views.
 Aside from Deng, Hu is the clear victor in this
 political round. In early 1983 Hu strongly endorsed
 an acceleration of reform, but his ideas generally were
 ignored, even obliquely attacked by other senior lead-
 ers, and, in the press of other priorities, reform efforts
 stagnated. Later that year, Hu was clearly on the
 defensive in the spiritual pollution campaign. Yet,
 ideas Hu promoted last year in the face of criticism
 have now become the official line and policy of the
 Central Committee.

 In January 1984 the political atmosphere did not
 appear conducive to the promotion of major structur-
 al reforms, despite a People's Daily New Year's
 editorial that subordinated all other tasks to eco-
 nomic construction. At that time, China was still
 awash in the rhetoric of the campaign against spiritu-
 al pollution, which Deng had kicked off at the Second
 Plenum in October 1983. That drive faded in late
 December after Hu, Zhao, and other senior leaders
 went to Deng with evidence that the campaign was
 being misused by conservative elements in the party
 to attack a broad range of policies, including agricul-
 tural reforms. It is possible, therefore, that the
 party's reformist wing, after containing the spiritual
 pollution campaign, decided to forcefully reassert
 reformist priorities and press forward with long de-
 layed proposals for major structural changes. F_

 must encourage competition (among enterprises) and
 The available evidence suggests that party reformists
 wanted to formalize their controversial new program
 with a central committee resolution. Another party
 session, probably in late July or early August, appar-
 ently worked on a late, if not final, draft of the
 Decision on Economic Reform.a Shortly thereafter, a
 diverse collection of national leaders-including Hu,
 Zhao, Wan Li, and others-began to tour the prov-
 inces, apparently to generate support for the impend-
 ing policy changes. Around the same time, Politburo
 members openly began to discuss the agenda of the
 Third Plenum and the party's decision to convene a
 Congress of Delegates (at first misunderstood to be a
 During January-March several important events oc-
 curred that imparted greater momentum to reform
 efj'orts.
 ? Deng Xiaoping toured and publicly praised China's
 Special Economic Zones.
 ? Hu Yaobang traveled through the southwest and
 set off a campaign against local factionalism.
 ? Economic moderate Chen Yun, an advocate of rural
 reform but also of tight central planning, sharply
 reduced his public activities, possibly because of
 illness.
 ? The official media intensified their coverage of
 rectification and reform topics such as the treat-
 ment of intellectuals and the need for price reform.
 Several major party and government meetings were
 held in the spring. One of the most important was an
 expanded Politburo session on 30 April that approved
 the opening of 14 port cities to foreign commerce. We
 assume these meetings also worked out the themes
 and business of the Second Session of the Sixth
 National People's Congress (NPC) that convened in
 May. Premier Zhao Ziyang's speech to the NPC was
 the high water mark of the spring reformist current.
 Zhao revived several ideas that had lost some curren-
 cy following the onset of the economic readjustment
 policy in early 1981, such as the devolution of
 decisionmaking responsibility to enterprise managers
 and the importance of workers' congresses. He an-
 nounced the State Council decision to accelerate
 urban reform and foreshadowed the party's departure
 party congress) in 1985.
 In response to top-level encouragement, provincial
 and ministerial leaders began taking bolder steps at
 reform. Factories in the city of Chongqing, for exam-
 ple, were reported to be experimenting successfully
 with a program allowing them to direct their own
 production, marketing, hiring, and firing, and to
 establish their own managerial systems. In August
 and September the State Council ordered several
 major state organizations-including the Ministry of
 Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the Ministry
 of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Coal
 Industry-to relinquish day-to-day conduct of busi-
 ness and instead to become formulators of broad
 policy guidelines for their respective industries.
 Just before the plenum convened, the State Council
 published "Provisional Regulations on Improving the
 Planning System. " Although we have yet to see a
 copy of the regulations, Chinese press accounts sug-
 gest that they cover most of the major elements of the
 program subsequently approved by the party plenum,
 and indeed that they provide even more detail on how
 particular industries and products would be affected
 by the new program. This unusual public discussion
 of the plenum's agenda contributed to the reformist
 momentum and made it appear that the plenum was
 held simply to legitimize a fait accompli.

 Zhao has also gained through his long and clear
 association with many of the ideas expressed in the
 Decision. Moreover, Zhao crisscrossed the country
 during the months preceding the plenum, apparently
 to do advance work for the coming policy changes.
 While on the road, he delivered important speeches
 that amplified his May address to the NPC and
 included fresh ideas on technical renovation in fac-
 tories, the velocity of money in circulation, and the
 importance of China's opening to the world.
 The main institutional winners and losers will emerge
 more clearly over the next year as Deng and company
 move from policy formulation to implementation, but
 we believe certain categories of officials can be rough-
 ly assessed now. Aside from the party's reform wing,
 other generic winners include the growing group of
 relatively young, educated professionals and intellec-
 tuals whom the party has courted so assiduously over
 the past year. In particular, those alternate members
 of the Central Committee who were selected for their
 exemplary professional characteristics can look for-
 ward to enhanced career prospects in a hospitable
 policy context.
 The party's planning apparatus will continue to play
 an important role within its narrowed confines, but
 nonetheless has been divested of many responsibilities.
 National foreign trade officials-among them Polit-
 buro alternate Chen Muhua, who seems perennially
 awaiting demotion-will lose authority to local trade
 officials and enterprise managers, who have received
 expanded power to strike their own deals with foreign
 traders. Whole categories of ministerial-level officials,
 accustomed to directly commanding entire sectors of
 the economy, must rest content with establishing
 broad policy guidelines and overseeing implementa-
 tion, while plant managers get on with their profit
 seeking.
 No Breathing Space
 Political Shoals. The leadership recognizes that Cen-
 tral Committee endorsement plus reliable personnel
 well-placed to oversee execution does not equate to
 policy implementation. Until regulations, laws, and
 administrative decisions on implementation are pub-
 lished and acted on, the Decision is only an enumera-
 tion of intentions, a wish list. We expect, therefore,
 that the plenum's Decision will be a major test for
 China's reconstituted bureaucracy and its ability to
 weave disparate policy strands into a coherent fabric
 of reforms.
 The enthusiasm surrounding the Decision-whether
 spontaneous or manufactured-may momentarily
 mute voices critical of extensive economic reform. The
 longstanding debate over economic policy, however,
 cannot be considered resolved. Few such controversies
 ever reach satisfactory closure, as the experience of
 China's rural reforms-which remained periodically
 under fire even after promoting bumper harvests-
 amply demonstrates. We believe critics of reform will
 seize upon problems during the transition period to
 press for policy reversal or modification.
 These potential critics are located throughout China,
 although generally not in the most important posts.
 They have the ability to slow down the process of
 policy implementation through a wide variety of
 bureaucratic subterfuges. They probably fear that
 Deng's current initiative requires removing officials
 like themselves, who lack the training, knowledge, or
 vigor to promote change. To these party hacks, party
 personnel chief Qiao Shi's recent promise to replace
 within a year 40 percent of all top managers and 70
 percent of all party secretaries in 3,000 key enter-
 prises must sound like a war cry. In self-defense, these
 cadre can be expected to take every opportunity to
 criticize and block the implementation of reforms
 Finally, to some within the party, the Decision may
 represent the single greatest instance of "spiritual
 pollution" in the 35-year history of the People's
 Republic. The ideological concerns that gave rise to
 last year's drive to eliminate bourgeois influence
 remain alive. Indeed, Deng, Hu, and their reformist
 allies share a preoccupation with the effect of reforms
 on the party's ability to manage Chinese society, and
 the issue could possibly be revived under another
 slogan. Although we believe that the drafters of the
 Decision sought in the text to allay these concerns, we
 suspect that older party traditionalists will be moni-
 toring developments for signs of "bourgeois deca-
 dence," "corrosive ideology," and a chance to exploit
 these phenomena once again.

 Economic Problems Ahead. Introducing price reform
 into China's shortage-driven economy probably poses
 the most immediate threat to the reform program.
 The plenum's call for price reform reportedly has
 sparked a few bank runs and some panic buying,
 despite assurances that prices would be adjusted
 slowly and that consumer income would not be al-
 lowed to suffer. Further problems can be expected as
 Beijing attempts to bring prices for essential goods
 such as cereals, industrial raw materials, and coal in
 line with costs.
 Another economic hurdle that the leadership must
 cross in the immediate future is the question of
 corporate bankruptcy. Last year, nearly one-fourth of
 China's industrial enterprises were unprofitable, and
 this year, even after the government exerted strong
 pressure for improvement, 16 percent are still operat-
 ing in the red. Clearly, Beijing cannot allow a massive
 shutdown of such a large portion of its industrial base,
 but to continue to subsidize losses reduces pressure on
 the enterprises to improve.
 Perhaps more important, even if the government
 proved willing to accept large-scale shutdowns, it has
 no suitable criteria for determining which enterprises
 are operating efficiently. Several major industries,
 including coal and some textiles, are unprofitable
 simply because their output prices have been fixed at
 artificially low levels. Until price reform can be
 implemented, Beijing must devise some measures for
 determining which enterprises should be closed be-
 cause they are poorly managed and which should
 continue to receive subsidies. In all likelihood, the
 government will be cautious and allow a large number
 of inefficient firms to operate.
 Where firms are forced to close, the accompanying
 unemployment problems may be locally destabilizing.
 Beijing has historically prohibited the free movement
 of the population in order to prevent massive migra-
 tion from the countryside to the cities. If major
 industries are allowed to fold, certain geographic
 areas could face high unemployment rates for long
 periods of time. Here, too, we believe Beijing's incli-
 nation will be to accept inefficiency rather than
 promote serious unemployment.
 Unfinished Business: A Critical September Meeting
 A New Central Committee? The plenum deferred a
 wide variety of personnel moves that apparently will
 be taken up at the special party Conference of
 Delegates scheduled for next September. According
 to both Hu Yaobang and Hu Qili, personnel moves
 involving high party offices are among the "other
 organizational matters" on the conference agenda.
 The "election of additional members to the Central
 Committee," the main organizational measure an-
 nounced, is generally the province of formal party        25X1
 congresses. However, Deng and his political heirs may
 be impatient to rejuvenate the committee itself. More-
 over, membership on the Central Committee confers
 an automatic status in the party that Deng, Hu, and
 company may wish to grant intellectuals and techno-
 crats as a token of political good faith.' In our view, a
 number of aged party veterans will probably be
 replaced through the promotion of alternate members
 to full membership
 Politburo Shifts? The party leadership almost cer-        25X1
 tainly could have taken care of personnel questions at
 the recent plenum, but perhaps at the risk of tarnish-
 ing the highly prized image of stability and unity.
 Rumors current in Beijing and Hong Kong last
 summer suggested that the six-man Politburo Stand-
 ing Committee would take on one or two new mem-
 bers. Although Zhao Ziyang recently suggested   25X1
 hat the Standing Committee never meets 25X1
 and the Politburo seldom does, the most powerful men
 in China, nevertheless, sit on these two bodies. Al-
 though we believe it has been politically useful to crop
 the aged Politburo out of much policymaking-allow-
 ing the Secretariat and the State Council to handle
 most work-Deng or his successors may eventually
 want it to resume a more prominent role in framing
 policy guidelines. If so, many of the Politburo's
 octogenerian leaders are overdue for replacement
 ' The conference is to be attended by "about 1,000" delegates,
 chosen from the ranks of scientists, technocrats, provincial party
 secretaries, soldiers, and current Central Committee members. This
 compares with 1,545 delegates who attended the 12th Congress. It
 is possible Deng will attempt to "pack" the Central Committee by
 careful selection of delegates, all of whom will have the right to vote

 Secretariat Additions? Comments Hu Yaobang made
 recently to visiting foreign dignitaries indicated that
 several members of the party Secretariat would prob-
 ably be replaced at the September meeting. We
 cannot safely predict who will go, but candidates are
 those aged leaders who sit on both the Secretariat and
 the Politburo, such as Xi Zhongxun and Yu Qiuli, as
 well as those who have hovered near or are currently
 in political disgrace, such as Deng Liqun. It is possible
 that three or four places will open up (more if the body
 expands to accommodate a greater workload). The
 obvious candidates for promotion would appear to be
 alternate Secretariat members Qiao Shi and Hao
 Jianxiu. General Office director Wang Zhaoguo and
 International Liaison Department chief Qian Liren
 might also be added. Xu Xin, a rapid riser in the
 General Staff Department, could conceivably gain the
 military seat vacant since the death of Yang Yong.
 Rectification Redefined? The most ambitious person-
 nel measure of all, the party rectification now in its
 second year, received short shrift at the plenary
 session. Although the drive to reform, rejuvenate, and
 discipline the party has progressed approximately on
 schedule and in 1985 will extend into cities, counties,
 and enterprises, the plenum issued no progress report
 and addressed the campaign only in the final section
 of the Decision on Economic Reform.
 Although Beijing will continue to purge Cultural
 Revolution beneficiaries who were guilty of serious
 criminal acts, the line has softened somewhat over the
 past year, with far greater emphasis on forgiving and
 forgetting. Beijing seems to believe that rectification
 should try to break, not perpetuate, the self-destruc-
 tive cycle of recrimination and mistrust that has
 driven Chinese politics since 1949. It has therefore
 stressed the need for lenient treatment of old cases,
 while still insisting that younger officials to be pro-
 moted must not have been involved in the Cultural
 Revolution to any great extent.
 In general, however, we do not believe that the party
 leadership's commitment to rectification has flagged.
 Indeed, bureaucratic restructuring at all levels re-
 mains the key to the success of the implementation
 phase of reform, and the Decision pointedly links the
 two. The document lays down what has become the
 new bottom line: one's ability and willingness to
 promote reforms is a strong indication of one's con-
 tinuing suitability as a party member
 The Next Five- Year Plan. The other major piece of
 business on the agenda of next year's Conference of
 Delegates is the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90).
 The formulation of the plan is absolutely critical for
 the implementation of the new policies approved by
 the plenum. Advance reports in the official media
 suggest that Beijing will concentrate on renovating
 existing industrial plants, holding the line on capital
 construction investment and allowing enough flexibili-
 ty for the new reforms to take effect.
 Prospects
 Whither the Party? The success of Beijing's economic
 policies carries both opportunities and risks. Success
 would reinforce party legitimacy and help curb the so-
 called crisis of confidence in the party's leadership.
 Moreover, it would arm the party's reform wing
 against its detractors (and their failed policies) and
 would strengthen the positions of Hu Yaobang and
 Zhao Ziyang in a post-Deng regime. More than any
 other leaders, they have staked their political futures
 on the outcome of the reforms. Successful reform
 would indicate that substantial progress has been
 made in reforming China's aging and poorly trained
 bureaucracy, presaging greater stability and cohesive-
 ness within the party as a whole. It would also
 facilitate the continuing admission of managers and
 engineers to the membership in order to better enable
 the party to meet future political and economic
 challenges.
 At the same time, by devolving some economic deci-
 sion making power and promoting individual entre-
 preneurship, the party runs the risks of establishing
 spheres of activity that may grow immune to party
 tutelage. Successful reform will inch the Chinese
 economy closer to the "consumer sovereignty" and
 producer responsiveness that characterize capitalist
 economies and that are so antithetical to central
 planning. Acclimating the populace to make economic
 choices freely may lead to corresponding demands for

 political liberalization, as happened in the 1978-80
 period. The leadership appears to believe it can
 control these political strains, in part because the
 party retains its monopoly over the instruments of
 coercion. Furthermore, as the performance of Chi-
 nese-run economies of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
 Singapore demonstrate, economic vitality is compati-
 ble with political docility.
 Whither the Economy? Beijing is committed to imme-
 diate price adjustment, but it also clearly recognizes
 the potential for panic that price reform raises and
 will move very deliberately to implement changes. In
 fact, we believe the risk that the leadership will move
 too slowly with essential price adjustments-and stall
 the entire reform package-is greater than the risk
 that too rapid an advance will spark economic insta-
 bility. Nevertheless, it is safe to assume that price
 reform will be somewhat inflationary in the short run.
 Most adjustments will probably be upward, and im-
 portant products such as coal, oil, and certain food-
 stuffs will eventually undergo steep revisions. The
 reforms may occasionally spark bouts of panic buying
 as consumers draw down savings deposits that are
 now at record levels. Beijing is most likely to respond
 to these periodic bouts by ordering producers to hold
 the line on prices, and by raising interest rates and
 taxes to discourage consumption.
 We do not believe there is significant risk of serious
 long-term inflation. For this to occur the government
 would have to be willing to sustain the increases in
 consumer demand by printing money. Although some
 subsidies or wage increases will be offered in the early
 stages of the adjustment process-to help ease con-
 cerns about eroding purchasing power-the conserva-
 tive government is unlikely to resort to any long-term
 use of the printing press to finance consumer spend-
 ing
 In light of the many problems, we do not expect the
 benefits of urban reform to match those experienced
 under the agricultural reform program. But neither
 does Beijing. The party is allowing itself five years to
 get the program in place and probably will hail even
 minor improvements in efficiency during that period
 as evidence of success. The fact that Beijing is going
 into this program with its eyes open increases the
 probability that it will be able to resist pressures to
 revert to tight central planning when problems arise.
 Nevertheless, the next year will provide a critical test
 of the government's willingness to accept the disloca-
 tions necessary to carry the program through.
 If Beijing can resist pressure to back away from
 reforms in the face of mounting problems, we believe
 long-term productivity will increase and economic
 growth will accelerate. Government efforts to encour-
 age surplus labor to take up private commerce and
 service activities have considerable potential for in-
 creasing both agricultural and industrial productivity.
 The renewed emphasis on enterprise autonomy also
 bodes well for productivity increases, some of which
 will go unobserved in Beijing as enterprises attempt to
 understate profits to avoid taxes.
 A Worst Case Assessment. Deng and his allies have
 indicated they expect that the early going will be
 rough and are prepared to ride out short-term prob-
 lems, such as panic buying and isolated runs on banks.
 If those problems persist, or get worse, critics of
 reform will almost certainly seize on the dislocations
 to call for a return to direct central control, even       ?
 though this alternative has demonstrably failed to
 promote efficiency in the past. Although reform advo-
 cates seem to hold the balance in party councils now,
 party and military conservatives could coalesce into a     25X1
 potentially powerful political bloc if economic prob-
 lems became socially destabilizing.
 Even if Beijing manages to weather its inevitable
 short-term problems, Deng's death or a combination
 of setbacks-such as floods, drought, a succession of
 poor harvests, a rapid rise in undesirable side effects
 of economic expansion such as price gouging, specula-
 tion, or graft-could over the longer term tip the
 political scales against reform and lead to a retreat.
 Retrenchment on reforms would confront the party
 with serious political difficulties as it sought to reas-
 sert its control down to the local level. At a minimum,

 the party leadership would again be seen as vacillat-
 ing and unconcerned with the common welfare, pre-
 cisely the image it seeks to dispel by implementing
 new policies. At worst, disaffected peasants or work-
 ers might engage in active or passive resistance. The
 failure of reform would almost certainly bring on a
 protracted period of political instability, as leaders
 struggle for the right to affix the blame.
 Foreign Policy. In our judgment, implementation of
 the reforms will both broaden and deepen China's ties
 with the United States and the West, but will not, at
 least in the short term, have much impact on Sino-
 Soviet relations.
 The emphasis on technological innovation at the plant
 level, foreign capital acquisition, and increased joint
 ventures will expand investment and trade opportuni-
 ties for US and Western businesses. In addition, we
 expect that Chinese enterprise managers will take
 advantage of their new flexibility to tap the West for
 increased amounts of information, training, and man-
 agerial expertise
 At the same time, however, the reforms will aggravate
 some current problems in US-Chinese relations. It
 can be expected that Chinese enterprises will want
 access to Western markets to sell their products, so
 Beijing's pressure on Washington to lower trade
 barriers will increase. Similarly, Beijing will probably
 press Washington harder on technology transfer in
 response to the demands of its own enterprises. It is
 also likely that China will reduce its grain imports
 from the West as its agricultural production continues
 to improve.
 The Soviet reaction thus far has been cautious, and
 Soviet media have been only indirectly critical of
 Chinese reforms. Pravda, for example, has replayed
 Chinese commentary critical of midlevel cadre who
 oppose the reforms and US commentary stressing the
 radical nature of the change and the disruptions that
 the reforms will cause in the economy. Moscow will
 continue to treat the issue delicately because of
 concern about fueling the debate within Eastern
 Europe-as well as domestically-over economic re-
 form. The Soviets may try to exploit the reforms by
 offering China increased assistance for those factories
 originally built with Soviet technology.
 Privately, Soviet China watchers have been more
 critical. In characteristic fashion, they have said that
 the Chinese reform package is cosmetic, unlikely to
 last long, a reflection of a power struggle within the
 Chinese leadership, and a deviation from Marxism-
 Leninism. We do not believe, however, that these
 comments will be aired in direct Soviet media com-
 mentary any time soon, unless Moscow reverts to the
 tough policy of last summer, when it temporarily
 lifted its ban on criticism of Chinese domestic devel-
 opments.
 Failures in the reform program, on the other hand,
 will almost certainly have negative consequences for
 China's open-door policy, as foreign economic issues
 become embroiled in the inevitable infighting within
 the leadership. Although the Soviets might hope to
 exploit such a situation, and would almost certainly be
 reassured at the reemergence of what they would see
 as more "orthodox" economic planning, the funda-
 mental security issues that divide China and the
 USSR would remain. Unless Moscow is prepared to
 address Chinese security concerns, even a more con-
 servative leadership in Beijing would probably still
 look to the United States as a strategic counterweight
 to the Soviet Union.

 Appendix
 Extracts From the CCPCC Decision on Reform of the Economic
 Structure
 (Adopted, 20 October 1984)
 The Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee ... holds the
 consensus view that ... we must go a step further with the policy of
 invigorating the domestic economy and opening to the outside world and
 accelerate the restructuring of the national economy as a whole, with the
 focus on the urban economy, so as to create a new, better situation for our
 socialist modernization.
 1. Reform Is a Pressing Necessity in the Current Developments in China
 ... There is an urgent need to unclog the channels of circulation between
 town and country, expand the market for the increasing amount of
 agricultural products, and satisfy the rising needs of the peasants for
 manufactured goods, science and technology, as well as culture and
 education. Our successes in rural reform and the demands on the cities by
 the growing rural economy provide highly favorable conditions for restruc-
 turing China's entire national economy, focusing on the urban economy.
 ... Defects in the urban economic structure that seriously hinder the
 expansion of the forces of production are yet to be eradicated.... Firm,
 systematic reform is the only way that the cities will play their due leading
 role.
 ... Emerging on a global scale is a new technological revolution
 that presents new opportunities and challenges to our economic
 growth.... Reform, therefore, is all the more imperative.
 H. Reform Is Aimed at Establishing a Dynamic Socialist
 Economic Structure
 ... The profound changes that have taken place in the 35 years since the
 founding of the People's Republic are an initial demonstration of the
 superiority of the socialist system. But this superiority ... has yet to be
 brought into full play .... A major economic cause for this is a rigid
 economic structure that cannot meet the needs of the growing forces of
 production. The following are the major defects of this structure: no clear
 distinction has been drawn between the functions of the government and
 those of the enterprises; barriers exist between different departments or
 regions; the state has exercised excessive and rigid control over enterprises;
 no adequate importance has been given to commodity production, the law
 of value, and the regulatory role of the market; and there is absolute

 Approved For Release 2009/02/09: CIA-RDP85T00310R000300020004-8
 equalitarianism in distribution .... The enthusiasm, initiative, and cre-
 ativeness of enterprises and workers have, as a result, been seriously
 dampened, and the socialist economy is bereft of much of the vitality it
 should possess.
 To bring about a radical change in the economic structure ... we must
 conscientiously sum up China's historical experience and study the con-
 crete conditions and requirement for economic growth. In addition, we
 must draw on the world's advanced methods of management, including
 those of developed capitalist countries, that conform to the laws of modern,
 socialized production.
 ... The essential task of socialism is to develop the forces of production,
 create even more wealth, and meet the people's growing material and
 cultural needs. Socialism does not mean pauperism, for it aims at the
 elimination of poverty.
 III. Invigorating Enterprises Is the Key To Restructuring
 the National Economy
 One of the main reasons that the state exercised excessive and rigid control
 over enterprises in the past was to equate the concept of their ownership by
 the whole people with the concept of their direct operation by the state in-
 stitutions..... Ownership can be duly separated from the power of opera-
 tion.... Socialist state institutions must manage, inspect, guide, and
 regulate the activities of the enterprises, as is necessary, through planning
 and by economic, administrative, and legal means; (the state) must use
 taxation and other means to concentrate in its treasury that part of
 enterprises' net income that should be used by the state in a unified way; it
 must designate, appoint, and remove the principal leading members of the
 enterprises or approve their appointment and election; and it must decide
 on the establishment of enterprises, their removal to other places, their
 switching over to other lines of products, their merger with others,
 suspension of operations, or closing down.
 ... However ... no state institution can know the whole situation fully and
 cope with everything in good time. Therefore ... the enterprise has the
 power to adopt flexible and diversified forms of operation; plan its
 production, supply, and marketing; keep and budget funds it is entitled to
 retain; appoint, remove, employ, or elect its own personnel according to
 relevant regulations; decide on how to recruit and use its work force, and
 on wages and rewards; set the prices of its products within the limits
 prescribed by the state; and so on. In short, the enterprise should be truly
 made a relatively independent economic entity and should become a
 producer and operator of socialist commodity production that is independ-
 ent and responsible for its own profit and loss and capable of transforming
 and developing itself, and that acts as a legal person with certain rights and
 duties.

 (Establishing correct relations between the state and the enterprise)
 inevitably calls for reform of every aspect of the entire economic struc-
 ture ... (involving) ... a whole range of reforms including planning, pric-
 ing, economic management by state institutions, and the labor and wage
 system. The Central Committee is of the opinion that these reforms should
 be carried out step by step in harmony with the inherent connections
 between the various links of the national economy, according to the degree
 of ripening of the subjective and objective conditions and in the right order
 of importance, urgency, and feasibility, and that they should basically be
 accomplished in about five years. Specific plans will be drawn up
 separately to this end.
 IV. Establish a Planning System Under Which the Law of
 Value Is Consciously Applied for Developing a Socialist
 Commodity Economy
 Socialist society practices a planned economy on the basis of public
 ownership of the means of production.... Since the founding of the
 People's Republic, we have practiced a planned economy and concentrated
 vast financial, material, and human resources on large-scale socialist
 economic construction, with tremendous achievements to our credit. At the
 same time, historical experience shows that the socialist planning system
 should be one that combines uniformity and flexibility. .. .We must realize
 that because of China's rather undeveloped commodity production at the
 present stage, it is necessary to stimulate commodity production and
 exchange.
 ... If we try to incorporate all economic activities into the plans and
 implement them by administrative orders alone in disregard of the
 importance of the economic levers and the market, then there will
 unavoidably be a discrepancy between the subjective guidelines for plan-
 ning and objective conditions, with the plans seriously out of step with
 reality.... We must be realistic and admit that, for a considerably long
 time to come, our national economic plans on the whole can only be rough
 and elastic and that we can do no more than, by striking an overall balance
 in planning and through regulation by economic means, exercise effective
 control over major issues while allowing flexibility on minor ones.
 ... It is necessary, first of all, to discard the traditional idea of pitting the
 planned economy against the commodity economy. We should clearly
 understand that the socialist planned economy is a planned commodity
 economy based on public ownership, in which the law of value must be con-
 scientiously followed and applied. The full development of a commodity
 economy is an indispensable stage in the economic growth of society....
 Meanwhile, we must realize that the extensive growth of a socialist
 Approved For Release 2009/02/09: CIA-RDP85TOO31OR000300020004-8
 Approved For Release 2009/02/09: CIA-RDP85T00310R000300020004-8
 commodity economy may also lead to certain disorder in production, and
 there have to be guidance, regulation, and administrative control through
 planning.. . .The difference between socialist and capitalist economy ...
 (lies) ... in the difference in ownership, in whether there is an exploiting
 class and whether the working people are masters of the state, in the
 different purposes of production, in whether the law of value can be
 consciously applied throughout society, and in the different scopes of
 commodity relations.
 ... The basic characteristics of our planning system: first, ours is on the
 whole a planned economy ... not a market economy.... Second, produc-
 tion and exchange completely subject to market regulation are confined
 mainly to certain farm and sideline products, small articles of daily use and
 labor services.... Third, our planned economy does not necessarily mean
 the predominance of mandatory planning, both mandatory and guidance
 planning being its specific form. Fourth, guidance plans are fulfilled
 mainly by use of economic levers, mandatory plans have to be implement-
 ed, but even then the law of value must be observed.... It is necessary
 ... to reduce the scope of mandatory planning and extend guidance
 planning. Mandatory planning will be applied to major products.... Other
 products and economic activities which are far more numerous should
 either come under guidance planning or be left entirely to the operation of
 the market.... The focus of planning will be shifted to medium- and long-
 term planning, and annual plans will be appropriately simplified.
 V. Establish a Rational Price System and Pay Full Attention
 to Economic Levers
 ... The various aspects of the reform in economic structure, including
 planning a wage system, depend to a large extent on reform of the price
 system. Pricing is a most effective means to regulation, and rational prices
 constitute an important condition for ensuring a dynamic, yet not chaotic,
 economy. Therefore, reform of the price system is the key to reform of the
 entire economic structure.
 The irrational system of pricing is closely related to the irrational system of
 price control. In readjusting prices, we must reform the overcentralized
 system of price control, gradually reducing the scope of uniform prices set
 by the state and appropriately enlarging the scope of floating prices within
 certain limits and of free prices.... When the price of some mineral
 products and raw and semifinished materials is raised, the processing
 enterprises must substantially cut down consumption so that the increased
 production cost resulting from the higher price of such products and
 materials can be basically offset within the enterprises, with only a small
 part of the increase being borne by the state through tax reductions and ex-
 emptions. This will avoid a consequent rise in market sales prices.

 Confidential
 ... We must adopt effective measures to ensure that the real income of ur-
 ban and rural inhabitants does not go down as a result of price readjust-
 ments.... The pay of workers and staff members will have to be raised
 gradually. It must be widely publicized among the people that... (price
 reform) ... will never bring about a general and spiraling price rise.... It
 is absolutely impermissible for any unit or person to boost prices at will by
 taking advantage of the reform, deliberately generating a tendency toward
 a general rise in prices, disrupt the socialist market, and harm the interests
 of the state and the consumers.
 VI. Separate Government From Enterprise Functions So
 That Government Organs Can Properly Perform Their Function
 of Managing the Economy
 ... The functions of government for a long time were not separated from
 those of enterprises, which in fact became appendages of administrative
 organs, and the central and local governments took responsibility for many
 matters which were not really theirs and at the same time did not do well
 what they ought to do. This, plus the barriers between different regions and
 the practice of endless wrangles, increased the difficulties in running
 enterprises.
 ... Government organs ... should formulate the strategy, plans, principles,
 and policies; work out plans for the exploitation of natural resources, for
 technological transformation, and for the development of intellectual
 resources; coordinate the development plans of localities, departments, or
 enterprises and the economic relations among them; arrange for the
 construction of key projects ... ; collect and disseminate economic infor-
 mation ... ; work out economic regulations and ordinances and supervise
 their execution; appoint and remove cadres within a prescribed
 scope ... and so forth.
 ... The central role of cities must be brought into full play and open and
 interconnected economic zones of various sizes gradually formed with
 support from cities.... It is necessary to call the attention of all leading ur-
 ban comrades to the need for the city governments to separate their
 functions from those of enterprises and achieve simpler and decentralized
 administration.
 The relationship between socialist enterprises is first of all one of coopera-
 tion and mutual support, but this by no means excludes competition. For a
 long time, people used to consider competition peculiar to
 capitalism.... Competition between socialist enterprises is fundamentally
 different from that under capitalism, where the law of the jungle
 prevails ... our enterprises are put to the test of direct judgment by
 consumers in the marketplace so that only the best survive.

 VII. Establish Various Forms of Economic Responsibility System and
 Conscientiously Implement the Principle of Distribution According to Work
 ... Enterprises must specify in explicit terms the requirements for each
 workpost and the duties of each worker and staff member.... The basic
 principles of this system are a combination of responsibility, authority, and
 benefit; the unity of the interests of the state, the collective, and the
 individuals; and the linking of the income of workers and staff members
 with their job performance. In applying rural experiences to urban areas,
 we must take into account the characteristics of urban enterprise. It is
 neither feasible nor necessary to transplant mechanically the specific
 measures of the rural areas.
 ... It is necessary to establish a unified, authoritative, and highly efficient
 system to direct production and conduct operations and management. This
 calls for a system of the director or manager assuming full responsibility.
 Party organizations in enterprises should actively support directors in
 exercising their authority in giving unified direction to production and
 operations, guarantee and supervise the implementation of the principles
 and policies of the party and the state, strengthen the party's ideological
 and organizational work in the enterprises, improve their leadership over
 the trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations, and do
 effective ideological and political work among workers and staff mem-
 bers.... We must (also) improve the system of congresses of workers and
 staff members and other systems of democratic management.
 ... The socialist principle of distribution according to work will be
 implemented more fully.... The differences between the wages of various
 trades and jobs should be widened, so as to apply fully the principle of re-
 warding the diligent and good and punishing the lazy and bad and of giving
 more pay for more work and less pay for less work as well as to fully reflect
 the differences between mental and manual, complex and simple, skilled
 and unskilled, and heavy and light work.
 There has long been a misunderstanding about the distribution of goods
 under socialism, as if it meant equalitarianism. If some members of society
 got higher wages through their labor ... it was considered polarization and
 a deviation from socialism. This equalitarian thinking is utterly incompati-
 ble with scientific, Marxist views on socialism. History has shown that
 equalitarian thinking is a serious obstacle to implementing the principle of
 distribution according to work and that if it is unchecked, the forces of pro-
 duction will inevitably be undermined.... Common prosperity cannot and
 will never mean absolute equalitarianism or that all members of society
 become better simultaneously at the same speed.... Such thinking would
 lead to common poverty. Only when some regions, enterprises, and
 individuals are allowed and encouraged to get better off first through
 diligent work can there be a strong attraction and inspiration to the
 majority of people.

 VIII. Work To Develop Diverse Economic Forms and
 Continue To Expand Foreign and Domestic Economic and
 Technological Changes
 ...The collective economy is an important component of the socialist
 economy, and we can give the collectives a free hand in running enterprises
 in many areas of production and construction. The individual economy now
 found in China is linked with socialist public ownership and differs from
 the individual economy linked with capitalist private ownership. It plays an
 irreplacable role in expanding production, meeting the people's daily needs,
 and providing employment. It is a necessary and valuable adjunct to the so-
 cialist economy.
 ...Although international relations are complex and ridden with contradic-
 tions, international economic and technological ties are, generally speak-
 ing, very close, and national seclusion cannot lead to moderniza-
 tion ....We have taken opening to the outside world to be our long-term,
 basic state policy. Practice has already yielded marked results. We must
 continue to pursue flexible policies.
 As we open to the outside world, we shall open up even more between dif-
 ferent areas of China itself.
 IX. Promote a New Generation of Cadres and Create a Mighty
 Contingent of Managerial Personnel for the Socialist Economy
 ...Our contingent of managerial personnel falls far short (of our require-
 ments). .. .We have a large number of veteran comrades in this contingent
 who, in the long period of hard struggle, have made great contributions
 ... but they are getting up in years, and we can no longer ask them to con-
 tinue in arduous leading posts. Our present urgent task is to promote boldy
 thousands upon thousands of young and middle-aged managerial personnel
 and take steps to train them.
 The Central Committee calls for completion of the reshuffling of leader-
 ship in enterprises, especially key enterprises, before the end of 1985. In
 addition, plans should be drawn up and effective measures taken to train
 fairly soon large numbers of directors ...chief engineers ...chief economic
 managers ...chief accountants ... and party secretaries.
 X. Strengthen Party Leadership To Ensure the Success
 of Reforms
 ... All party comrades should be in the forefront of reform, which
 represents the trend of our times.... The vast number of cadres are not
 familiar with this work. Leading party and government functionaries at all

 Approved For Release 2009/02/09: CIA-RDP85TOO31OR000300020004-8
 levels have to be sober minded and give meticulous guidance.... Errors
 can hardly be avoided, but ... once an error does occur, we must try to dis-
 cover it promptly, resolutely correct it, draw the lessons, and continue to go
 ahead ....We must not try to accomplish the whole task at one stroke. All
 major reforms that affect the whole country will be arranged by the State
 Council under a unified plan.... Any reform involving the overall situation
 or one that is extensive in scope must first be approved by the State
 Council.
 Party organizations in numerous localities and enterprises will undergo
 consolidation next year. Reform should be closely linked with this. Party
 consolidation should promote economic growth, which is an indicator of
 how successful it is.... We should actively support cadres and the masses
 who are keen on reform. When errors or deviations occur... we should
 adopt a policy of persuasion, criticism, and education toward the persons
 concerned and must not stick political labels on them .... We must not
 divide the cadres and masses by calling some people "reformers" and
 others "conservatives." We should have faith in comrades who fall behind
 the developing situation for a time, confident that they will understand
 things better in the course of reform.
