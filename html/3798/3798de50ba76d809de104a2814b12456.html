Rev. R. Cecil Mills, DD., Canaan Bap-

the following prayer:. 
in all thy ways acknowledge Him, and 
He shall direct thy paths. 
Lord of every land and nation, we 
thank Thee for men whose faith in Thee 
has made them great in the history of 
our country. Make us realize that only 
those lands are truly prosperous and 
happy whose leaders are led by the 
spirit of God. As we give Thee thanks 
for courageous Christian leadership in 
the days gone by, we pray Thee for men 
at the head of affairs in ow Nation dur-
ing these troubled days in whose hearts 
is the fear of:the Lord and whose great-
est ambition is to serve Thee and do 
Thy will. So shall our beloved land ful-
fill the mission Thou hast appointed unto 
It. 
Give us a consciou,sness of guilt, not 
only for personal sins but also for the 
great collective sins of mankind, from 
which we cannot escape a share of re-
sponsibility. Help us to believe in the 
saving power of the Gospel when ap-
plied through the lives of redeemed men 
to the sins of society. Let us never be 
complacent or at ease so long as our 
fellow men are unjustly oppressed. 
? And grant unto us universal peace 
and good will among all men. 
In His name we pray. Amen.

AMENDMENT TO SECTION 271 OF 
THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 
1954 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from California [Mr. 
HOLIFIELD I. 
Mr. HOLLKIELD. Mr. Speaker, I move 
that the House resolve itself into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the 
State of the Union for the considera-
tion of the bill (H.R. 8856) to amend 
section 271 of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended. 
The motion was agreed to. 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself 
into the Committee of the Whole House 
on the State of the Union for the consid-
eration of the bill, H.R. 8856, with Mr. 
HARRIS in the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
By unanimous consent, the first read-
ing of the bill was dispensed with. 
The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the 
gentleman from California [Mr. HOLI-
FIELD] will be recognized for 1 hour and 
the gentleman from California [Mr. 
HosmER] will be recognized for 1 hour. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California [Mr. HOLIFIELD]. 
Mr. HOLIFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
(Mr. HOLIFIELD asked and was giv-
en permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. HOLIFIELD. Mr. Chairman, this 
is the second time this legislation has 
been brought to the floor for considera-
tion. It was previously brought to the 
floor under suspension of the rules which 
requires a two-thirds vote in the affirma-
tive. The vote was 216 to 139 and, there-
fore, the bill having failed to get two-
thirds in the affirmative, it was neces-
sary to bring it up under the rule which 
allows an hour for each side to present 
their case. 
H.R. 8856 would amend section 271 of 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended. The five-member Atomic En-
ergy Commission unanimously supports 
this bill, as does the Justice Department, 
The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy 
also unanimously recommends that this 
bill be enacted. 
Mr. Chairman, the effect of this bill, 
and the reasons why the Joint Committee 
on Atomic Energy recommends its enact-
ment, were explained in my statement on 
the floor on July 12. In view of this fact, 
and in light of the comprehensive report 
on this bill filed by our committee, I will 
simply point out several significant facts 
about HR. 8856. 
First. Because of the interest which 
has been generated concerning the dis-

persons concerfied with vocational rehabili-
tation, information on rehabilitation re-
sources useful for Various kinds of disability 
and on research and the results thereof and 
on ether imatters whieh may be helpful in 
promoting the rehabilitation of handicapped 
individuals and their greater utilization In 
gainful and suitable employment. 
There are autherized to be appropriated for 
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1965, and 
each succeeding fiscal year, such sums as 
may be necessary for carrying out the pur-
poses of this subsection."

eiWr 
(Mr. ICHORD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Speaker and Mem-
bers of the House, last month I traveled 
to South Vietnam as a member of a Sub-
committee of the House Armed Services 
Committee on a factfinding tour. Upon 
returning from that country I made the 
following observation concerning teach-
ins and demonstrations in this country 
against our policy in South Vietnam: 
The Vietcong, Worth Vietnam, and Red 
China are able to capitalize propaganda-wise 
on such activities. They create doubt in the 
minds of many that America will stay. They 
are detrimental to an eventual peaceful 
selution. They have the effect of en-
couraging the Communists and directly con-
tribute to the prolongation of the war. 
American boys are dying in South Viet-
nam. Many more will lose their lives in the 
next few months. Even if I disagreed with 
the policy of the United States, I would find 
some other way to influence my Govern-
ment's policy rather than have the stain of 
American blood on my hands. This is a 
harsh conclusion, but it is true. 
The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, one of 
the Nation's top newspapers, has articu-
lated this problem in a very forceful and 
oustanding manner in an editorial on 
June 29, 1965. It is even more timely 
today than when written and I com-
mend it to the Members without further 
comment. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that I be permitted to insert this edi-
torial of June 29, 1965, from the St. Louis 
Globe-Democrat in the Appendix of the 
RECORD. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
Missouri?-
There was AA?I Ion. 
THE PRE 
SPEEcW ON 
VIETNAM POLICY 
(Mr. ROGERS of Colorado asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. 
Speaker, we in Congress are proud of the 
leadership demonstrated by our Presi-
dent yesterday when he conducted his 
White House press conference. 
The President demonstrated his great 
desire to maintain peace throughout the 
world. He pointed out that we have 
learned many bitter lessons during the 
first half of this century. These experi-
ences have caused us to be involved in 
great conflicts with other nations who do 
not understand our representative form 
of government. 
President Johnson recognizes the am-
bitiousness of the Communist nations, 
and he is taking definite steps to see that 
we maintain a strong nation so that we 
can be independent in the future. 
Every effort was made by the President 
to see that the peace of the world is 
maintained. He instructed Ambassador 
Goldberg to present a letter to the Secre-
tary General of the United Nations re-
questing that the United Nations employ 
all of its resources, energies, and im-
mense prestige to find ways to halt 
aggression and bring about peace in 
Vietnam. 
America has always been a peaceIoving 
Nation, and President Johnson yesterday 
reemphasized our desire to maintain 
peace throughout the world. It is my 
hope we can accomplish this objective. 
SCURRILOUS POSTHUMOUS AT-
TACK BY DREW PEARSON 
(Mr. WAGGONNER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute, to revise and extend his 
remarks, and include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. WAGGONNER. Mr. Speaker, on 
July 12 of this year, I took the floor to 
defend our colleague, the late T. A. 
Thompson, of Louisiana, against the 
scurrilous, posthumous attack by Drew 
Pearson. 
Among the responses I received, was 
a letter from the vice president of Her-
cules Powder Co., Mr. J. R. L. John-
son, Jr., which establishes once again 
that Pearson and the truth are strangers, 
that he has no compunction against ly-
ing if it suits his ugly purpose. 
Mr. Johnson's letter further estab-
lishes this well-known point and I in-
sert it now with his permission for all 
to see. 
HERCULES POWDER CO., 
Wilmington, Del., July 15, 1965. 
HOC. JOE D. WAGGONNER, Jr., 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR M. WAGGONNER: Thank you for in-
cluding in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of 
July 12, 1965, your remarks concerning Drew 
Pearson's article entitled "Chemical Com-
panies Versus Water Bill." 
Hercules Powder Co. has a plant at Lake 
Charles, La., which is located in the Seventh 
District. I know of no water pollution prob-
lem at that location and, so far as / can 
determine, no one from this company has 
ever talked to the late T. Ashton. Thompson 
concerning problems of water pollution or his 
position on proposed water pollution legis-
lation. 
Hercules has been concerned with water 
pollution problems for many years and has 
spent substantial sums of money studying 
and eliminating these problems at its vari-
ous plant locations. This company has also 
followed proposals in the Senate and in the 
House dealing with this problem. We feel 
that some legislation is needed but from our 
study of Senator Moszm's proposal and the 
revisions proposed to 8.4 by the House Public 
Works Committee, we feel that the modified 
bill suggested by the House version is supe-
rior and s.hould be the one adopted if any 
Federal legislation is considered to be needed 
at this time. 
We appreciate very much your setting the 
record straight on Drew Pearson's article. 
Very truly yours, 
J. R. L. JOHNSON, Jr., 
Vice President.

A,L RECORD ? HOUSE 
CHAIRMAN PATMAN cONTINTJES 
THg BATTLE FOR REASONABLE 
INTEREST RATES 
(Mr. ANNUNZIO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute, to revise and extend his re-
marks, and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. .ANNUNZIO. Mr. Speaker, to my 
knowledge no Man has done mor- to ad-
vocate the cause of reasonable interest 
rates for the American people than the 
distinguished chairman of the Banking 
and Currency Committee, the Honorable 
WRIGHT PATMAN, 
Chairman PATMAN reiterates his views 
on tight money in the August issue of 
the American Legion magazine in a de-
bate with the gentleman from Tennessee 
tMr. 33Roaci. The title of the article 
is "Should We Have Lower Interest Rates 
and More Credit Available?" Chairman 
PATMAN takes the "yes" position, while 
the gentleman from Tennessee takes the 
typical Republican "no" position. In 
other words, Chairman PATMAN advo-
cates a credit policy that would expand 
the Nation's ecqnomy, while the gentle-
man from Tennessee advocates a policy 
? that would shut out most Americans in 
their drive for a better way of life. 
In the Legion article Mr. PATMAN points 
out that there is no reason why a home-
owner should have to pay for a house and 
then pay a second time to cover the in-
terest payments. This is sound, well-
founded, and logical reasoning; and if 
our Nation follows a pattern of reason-
able interest rates such as those sug-
gested by Chairman PATMAN, we can look 
forward to prolonged prosperity. 
But, unfortunately, there has been an 
alarming swing to high interest rates 
and a tight money policy. The former 
chairman of the President's Council of 
Economic Advisers, Walter W. Heller, 
warned in a recent speech: 
Economic gains probably will slow down 
during the rest of the year and in 1966 and 
these developments could dampen economic 
,spirits and lead to a high level stall * 5 * 
not a recession but a marked slow down with 
a rise in unemployment, falling profit mar-
gins, and a cutback in plans for capital ex-
pansion. 
There is one guaranteed way to make 
certain that Mr, Heller's prediction be-
comes a fact, and that is to follm the 
advice set forth by the gentleman from 
Tennessee and the rest of the Repub-
licans who Rdvoe?ate a policy of making it 
hard for Americans to purchase the ne-
cessities of life. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to include 
for the RECORD a copy of the American 
Legion article discussing interest rates: 
SHOULD WE HAVE LOWER INTEREST RATES AND 
IVIORE CREDIT AVAILABLE? 
The question that is posed is like asking 
Whether a man who has been without ade-
quate nourishment needs food. 
The Ainerican 1egion took sides on the 
question when its founders wrote the pre-
amble to its constitution, which sets forth 
10 purposes. No. 6 reads: "To combat the 
autocracy of both the classes and the 
masses." 
The Fecieral Reserve System has changed 
from its well-cOnceived creation in 1913 to 
an absolute autocracy of the classes against 
NO. 1313?.-7 
the masses in 1905. Xt is now =trolled by 
private bankers. The President of the 
United States, the Secretary of the Treasury 
and the Congress do not fix our volume of 
money and interest rates. This is done by 
the Federal Reserve autocracy, which pro-
claims that it is independent?independent 
of the executive and congressional arms of 
the Government, yes?but not independent 
of the money powers in New York. 
If the Fed for the past two decades had 
worked in the interest of the American pub-
lic as hard as it has for private banking 
interests, our interest-bearing national debt, 
heading toward $325 billion, would be at 
least $50 billion less today?it might even 
have been cut in half. Our carrying 
charges on that debt, which run pretty close 
to a billion dollars a month, or $250 million 
a week, or around $35 million a day, would 
be halved if we were merely to revert to the 
pre-Eisenhower interest rates of the Roose-
velt-Truman days. 
Instead, the Fed has caused man-made re-
cessions or depressions every 3 or 4 years 
by raising interest rates arbitrarily, tighten-
ing money capriciously, thereby robbing the 
masses and enriching the classes. 
Think of the schools and hospitals that 
could be built, the area redevelopment in 
city and countryside, the idle factory wheels 
that could be turning and the jobs that could 
ensue if the excess $6 billion annual carry-
ing charge we're paying on the national 
debt were turned into the productive econ-
omy of America. 
There are many reasons why we should 
have lower interest rates. I think it's a dis-
grace that when we buy a house or build 
a school on long-term credit, we actually pay 
at least twice for them. High interest 
charges on our mortgages are responsible. 
And isn't it rather silly for all the folks in 
town to pay once for the building of the 
schoolhouse, and once again to the bankers 
In interest for merely renting money for its 
construction? 
Americans are paying extortionate interest 
rates which will aggregate over $75 billion 
in interest charges during 1965. This means 
that the consumer is paying far too much 
for the privilege of owning an automobile, 
a washing machine, or a split level. 
Legionnaires, keep a sharp eye on the 
autocracy of the Federal Reserve System and 
those who control it. It must have its power 
thwarted for the good of nearly 200 million 
Americans whose packets are being picked. 
WRIGHT PATMAN. 
Thirty years ago a buyer virtually had to 
pay cash for a car or a house, for it was al-
most impossible to borrow money at any 
price. Today, almost everything is bought 
on credit because the American people have 
saved their money and deposited it in banks 
where it can be used by others while it's 
there. 
In other words, because the citizens of this 
country have produced for their families and 
ved for their security, and because our 
banking system has become so capable in 
providing that these savings do not just sit 
there but are used constantly and securely 
for even more production and thus even 
more savings, we have created a truly great 
society. 
The key word is savings. When you and 
I save money, we put it in the bank. If 
someone else wants to use it, you do not 
lend these savings free. Nobody is going 
to risk his money for las than he can make 
in a safe investment. That is why Federal 
restrictions on interest are difficult, at best, 
and dangerous. 
Because money is basically like any other 
commodity, to make it cheap we have to 
produce a great deal of it. In the 1940's we 
were producing for war and consuming little 
at home. We had laws limiting wages, in-
terest rates, and prices. Later, we expanded 
18039 
production of consumer goods while not 
increasing he supply of money. The pres-
sure eased and laws on prices, wages, and 
finally interest rates were repealed. If 
Washington had chosen to keep a ceiling on 
Interest, the Government could have done 
so only by dramatically adding to the supply 
of money and forcing prices of goods up. 
In effect, we were required to impose 
price controls because there was more money 
available than there were goods on which to 
spend it. Obviously, in a free economy, 
prices would rise in such a situation until 
the excess cash was sopped up. The result 
would have penalized the poorer people who 
had no savings and limited incomes. Thus, 
the law was passed imposing ceilings on 
wages and prices. 
Higher prices literally destroy the savings 
of people. Those on fixed incomes such as 
social security or pensions are hurt first. 
If the condition worsens, they soon find they 
cannot afford even basic necessities. Wid-
ows, whose husbands had bought insurance 
once considered adequate, have difficulty 
meeting bills. For these reasons our Gov-
ernment decided we could not afford the 
self delusion of laws setting arbitrarily low 
interest ceilings. Rather, the people through 
their State governments attacked excessive 
charges with usury laws. 
In conclusion, if we want to manage one 
sector of the economy, such as the cost of 
money, then we must manage the rest 
- through wage and price controls. Thus, the 
opportunity for all to earn and to save is 
reduced. If we refuse the alternative of 
wage and price controls, then we allow and 
even encourage massive price increases. 
Here, too, the opportunity for those less for-
tunate to live decently is reduced. The price 
of wishful thinking on interest rates is too 
high. Our freedom is too dear to lose 
through lack of self discipline and individual 
responsibility.

CONCERN W PROGRAM TO 
SEND COLLEGE GRADUATES TO 
VIETNAM AS INTERNS 
(Mr. ADAIR asked and was given per-

Mr. ADAIR. Mr. Speaker, on June 29 
of this year I rose to inform this body 
of my concern with an AID program 
which proposed to send some 20 college 
graduate students to Vietnam as interns. 
At that time I said that I was most 
concerned about the safety of these 
young rfien. AID, I noted, was vague 
about this aspect of the matter but re-
portedly had said that the Vietcong usu-
ally do not attack AID people. I con-
trasted this alleged statement with a 
statement by President Johnson to the 
effect that AID workers were prime tar-
gets of the Communist terrorists. 
Now I have been saddened to learn that 
one of these young men, Theodore M. 
Smith, of the University of California, 
has been seriously wounded by a terror-
ist bomb while serving in the "intern" 
program in South Vietnam. 
In my original remarks I indicated 
that better uses of AID funds could be 
found than the financing of a highly 
dangerous and poorly conceived program 
such as this. I hoped that AID would 
drop the program forthwith before any 
Young men could be sent to Vietnam un-
der its sponsorship. Unfortunately, my 
hopes were not realized. 
I am sorry that this has happened. 
My protest was not heeded and these 
students were sent. The Agency for In-
ternational Development should recall 
the remaining students immediately. 
We are at war and everyone knows it. 
It is high time to stop this amateurish 
and ad hoc approach to the war in Viet-
nam and let our best professionals get 
this job done. 
Now, for those of you who missed this 
item in the Washington Post of Tuesday, 
I will read the item that appeared: 
BOMB WOUNDS TJ.S. STUDENT 
SAIGON, July 26.--An American student 
from the University of California was seri-
ously wounded by a terrorist bomb last 
Thursday, a U.S. spokesman announced to-
day. 
He said the student was Theodore M. 
Smith, 24, of Fullerton, Calif., 1 of 19 stu-
dents sent to Vietnam by the State Depart-
ment in June to familiarize themselves with 
U.S. aid operations. 
Smith was injured in a blast at the home 
of the U.S. AID mission representative for 
Lamdong Province, about 100 miles north-
east of Saigon, where he was staying. No one 
else was injured. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
(Mr. ST GERMAIN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ST GERMAIN. Mr. Speaker, on 
yesterday afternoon at the time rollcall 
208 was taken I was in conference in 
my office with officials of the Urban Re-
newal Administration and the mayor of 
the city of Providence on important busi-
ness having to do with the operations of 
that city. 
Mr. Speaker, I miscalculated on my 
timing and was not present for the vote 
on the motion to recommit H.R. 77. 
Had I been present my vote would have 
been against recommittal. 
PICTURES RECENTLY TAKEN OF 
MARS 
(Mr MU if,PR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, this af-
ternoon at 2:30, in the rooms of the 
Science and Astronautics Committee, 
2318 Rayburn Building, we will have an 
opportunity to see the pictures that were 
recently taken of Mars. I have seen 
these pictures; I saw them at the White 
House this morning. Dr. Pickering and 
his staff are coming up to show them this 
afternoon. 
1 realize we have important business 
to dispose of today, but those of you 
who can get away to see them will be 
very well rewarded. I should point out 
that this invitation is to Members of the 
House only, and not to the staff. 
INVESTIGATION OF BANKING CON-
CENTRATION AND CONTROL IN 
CLEVELAND, OHIO 
(Mr. PATMAN asked and was given 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD, and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, a resolu-
tion adopted by the Ohio State Legis-
lature indicates that the country is be-
coming increasingly aware of and 
alarmed by the tremendous concentra-
tion of economic power in the hands 
of little cliques which control the enor-
mous assets of huge banks. 
The Ohio House of Representatives, 
by a vote of 113 to 2, directed the State's 
Legislative Services Commission to in-
vestigate the legality and propriety of 
the officers of the Cleveland Trust Co., 
voting the bank's own shares to per-
petuate their own control, and also using 
the bank's trust department to dominate 
many major corporations. 
Although Ohio law bans corporations 
from voting its own stock, the Cleveland 
Trust Co., skirts this rule by assigning 
the voting rights to a third of its stock?
which it holds in trust for various es-
tates?to a dummy partnership known 
as A. A. Welsh & Co. 
Through this same device, using the 
economic power of stock held for various 
estates by its trust department, this bank 
has placed its chairman, George Gund, 
and its president, George Karch, on the 
boards of 43 corporations. Through 
these board memberships, they either 
control or have a loud voice in the affairs 
of companies with billions of dollars in 
assets. 
Through a combination of these posi-
tions and the power of their bank to 
grant or deny credit, these men wield vast 
economic power which would seem to be 
totally out of keeping with the principles 
of our economic free enterprise system. 
It has long been the public policy of 
the United States to curb and prevent 
such concentrations of power of life and 
death over whole industries and the en-
tire economy. 
The Committee on Banking and Cur-
rency of the House of Representatives, 
in previous investigations, has spelled out 
the interlocking directorates and close 
knit relationships through which the 
Nation's banks and many great corpora-
tions seem to be banded together to form 
a mighty confederation which, in many 
economic matters, may constitute more 
Power than that held by the Federal 
Government. 
The Ohio Legislature has taken cogni-
zance of this threat to economic liberty 
and it seems to me that the appropriate 
Federal agencies should join the investi-
gation. 
Surely the Department of Justice has 
a responsibility to see if Ohio banks are 
violating Federal as well as State laws. 
The Federal Reserve Board has a duty 
to require the Cleveland Trust Co. and 
other banks to make full disclosures of 
their operations, and to determine 
whether a self-perpetuating directorate 
is serving the interests of the depositors, 
or their own selfish self-interests. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Cor-
poration should require banks to observe 
the spirit as well as the letter of National 
and State laws. 
State and Federal authorities should 
cooperate to assure that the Nation's 
big banks are law-abiding citizens, and 
not a group of economic czars who con-
sider themselves above the law, and con-
stantly devise cute tricks to evade and 
ignore both the letter and the spirit of 
statutes enacted to regulate them. 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer of July 
21, 1965 and the Cincinnati Enquirer of 
the same date carry excellent and timely 
articles with respect to the Ohio banking 
investigation. 
These articles follow:

OHIO HOUSE OH'S BANK STOCK STUDY 
(By John E. Bryan) 
A resolution to investigate banks, espe-

of their own and other banks' and corpora-

In my opinion, to the executive depart-
ment. 
My bill uses the sound, time-honored 
mechanism spelled out in the Reorgani-
zation Act which permits the President 
to make orders for reorganizing the exec-
utive department, but requires that these 
changes be filed with both Houses of 
Congress. 
We ask no more than that the Presi-
dent submit to Congress any proposed fee 
schedules. These shall not become effec-
tive if either House passes a resolution 
against them within 60 days. I believe a 
serious error was committed when this 
obligation was delegated to the various 
executive agencies. Congress must do 
Its duty to the people by retaining some 
power in it hands over this matter. 
These two provisions of the bill would 
make unmistakably clear that Congress 
Intends to jealously guard the right of 
?our people to fully enjoy public lands and 
waters without undue charge. We will 
be saying there is to be no tampering 
With public policy unless and until Con-
gress has given the matter serious study 
and review. 
When he introduced similar legisla-
tion in the other body, the distinguished 
Senator llamas pinpointed the contradic-
tion between, these entrance fees and the 
administration's war on poverty and the 
"See the USA" programs. How can we 
spend hundreds of millions of dollars to 
rehabilitate people, and then make en-
joyment of ow natural resources depend-
ent on wealth? How can we justify en-
couraging Americans to see their own 
country first, and then force them to drop 
coins in the box every time they turn 
around? 
Many of my colleagues have already 
experienced the results of these fees. 
What has happened in my district has 
happened in theirs. They know of the 
thousands of impoverished families who 
can no longer enjoy the natural wonders 
of our great country because they can-
not afford these entrance and user fees. 
Mr. Speaker, let us undo the damage 
that has been done. Let us revitalize the 
public policy that allows everyone free 
access to ow natural resources, and let 
us return control of such policies where it 
belongs?in the Congress of the United 
States. 
(Mr. GOODELL (at the request of 
Mr. HALL) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. ,pooDELL. Mr. Speaker, the 
American public are rightly and dedly 
concerned witb our policies in Vietnam. 
It is an area of interest that must, by 
Its very nature, be scrutinized fully. 
It is most distressing, therefore, when 
efforts at a reasonable discussion are 
thwarted. 
I call to the attention of the member-
ship the statement of July 16, 1965, by 
the gentlenleu from Wisconsin [Mr. 
LAIRD], chairman of, the House Republi-
can conference. 
It deserves the attention of the House 
and I insert it here; 
STATEMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF REPRESENTA-
TIVE MELVIN R. LAIRD, RFXUBLICAN, OF WIS-
CONSIN 
Has critical bipartisan discussion about 
our policies in Vietnam been abandoned? 
It would seem so but I would hope not. 
Certainly rational debate and reasonable 
discussion have been abandoned?not by 
Republicans, but by the leader of the Presi-
deut's majority in the U.S. Senate. 
This fact is inescapable, and the situation 
it creates is deplorable. 
The first attempt to scuttle bipartisan 
debate occurred on June 30, 1965. It was 
ignored by Republicans in the hope that the 
intemperate remarks in that speech were a 
mere lapse, an accident, and not a deliberate 
attempt to silence the dialog, impose con-
formity, and obliterate efforts to arrive at 
an informed and broadly supported policy 
toward Vietnam. 
It was not a mere lapse. 
Any doubt that it was was erased on July 
8, 1965 when the majority leader of the 
Senate again launched a vituperative attack 
on the minority leader of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
The natural reaction to the tone and in-
nuendo of the majority leader's two recent 
speeches would be to reply in kind. This 
would be the natural reaction?and it would 
be fully justified. 
But it would not be constructive. 
Republicans could adopt similar tactics 
and join personalities rather than issues. 
We could attempt, for example to impugn 
this particular spokeman's credentials to 
question criticism of foreign and military 
policy. For the Senate Democratic leader 
has himself contributed to the "dialog"?
though not always in support of the Presi-
dent?and has himself participated rather 
fully in publicly questioning some of the 
actions taken in southeast Asia. 
I suspect that the President may have 
wished at times that his majority leader and 
kept to himself such suggestions as the 
neutralization of all of southeast Asia. 
The Senator's more recent statements con-
cerning Republican contributions to the de-
bate on Vietnam are confusing. 
It would seem from the Senator's remarks 
that the distinction between statesmanship 
and political chicanery goes no further 
than the difference in party labels of those 
making the remarks. 
If a Republican advocates a particular 
course, it is politics and irresponsible poli-
tics at that. If a Democratic President sub-
sequently adopts that course, it is instantly 
transformed into statesmanship. 
The President's decision last February to 
go North must have shocked and alarmed 
the Senator, for on "Meet the Press" just 1 
month before (January 3), the Senator said: 
"I feel just as strongly that we cannot carry 
the war into North Vietnam because if you 
carry the consequences of that action to its 
ultimate conclusion, It means war with 
Communist China, and a situation will be 
created which will be worse than it was in 
Korea." 
It should be remembered that at that 
time the suggestion to go north had been 
made by some Republicans. It was, in short, 
politics then. Only later did it become 
statesmanship. 
The natural and certainly justifiable re-
action to the Senator's recent statements 
could proceed along these lines. 
But Republicans have proceeded in a rea-
sonable and responsible manner. They have 
shown a spirit of fairness in standing up 
for administration policy against Democratic 
critics of that policy. In this spirit, I want 
to correct the blatant distortions which the 
President's majority leader of the Senate 
has given to Republican pronouncements. 
Senator MANSFIELD. "I am somewhat at 
a loss to understand public expressions from 
Republicans in which it 4 advocated, in 
0300190008-1 
18043 
view of the extent of the air and naval ac-
tivity already pursued against legitimate 
military targets, what can only amount to an 
indiscriminate slaughter of Vietnamese by 
air and naval bombardinent?a slaughter of 
combattants and noncombattants alike, of 
friend and foe alike." 
The truth: No Republican has advocated 
the "indiscriminate slaughter of Vietnam-
ese." Some Republicans have suggested and 
still suggest the more effective use of our air 
and naval power against more significant 
military targets in North Vietnam in order 
to bring about the President's stated objec-
tive of bringing the Communists to the con-
ference table. Our suggestions were designed 
to minimize the possibility of the slaughter 
of American soldiers when other steps are 
still available. 
Senator MANSFIELD: "Now one can advo-
cate the course of the bombing of Hanoi 
or Peking or even Moscow and with or with-
out nuclear weapons for that matter?in 
short, a course of virtually unrestricted vio-
lence as a suitable way for the United States, 
to achieve some worthwhile end in Viet-
nam." 
The truth: Any resemblance between the 
innuendo and the public statements of any 
elected national official in either party is 
so remote as to be totally nonexistent. Such 
a distortion could be expected from an over-
zealous freshman assemblyman in the heat 
of a bitter political campaign, but surely not 
from the Majority Leader of the greatest 
deliberative body in the world in a discus-
sion concerning a situation that contains 
within it the gravest consequences for the 
entire world. 
Senator MANSFIELD: "And one can say too, 
I suppose, that we want a total victory in , 
Vietnam, but we want it at bargain base-
ment rates in American lives. We want it 
by firebombs or nuclear bombs and lead and 
steel or whatever but we don't want any 
talk about paying a bitter price in American 
lives on the ground." 
The truth: No Republican since the Pres-
ident's Baltimore speech of April 7, 1965 
has spoken of "total" victory in Vietnam. 
None has proposed using nuclear bombs. 
Many Republicans have hoped for victory 
there, as did President Kennedy when he 
said on September 12, 1963, "We want the 
war to be won"; as did President Johnson 
when he wrote on December 31, 1963, to 
Gen. Duong Van Minh, "We shall maintain 
In Vietnam American personnel and mate-
rial as needed to assist you in achieving vic-
tory"; as did Secretary Rusk when he said 
on April 29, 1963, "We have no doubt of 
ultimate victory." By victory, Republicans 
and these Democrats meant--not the mili-
tary conquest of Vietnam?but the estab-
lishment of conditions of peace and security 
in South Vietnam and an end to aggression 
against it. Republicans do want to attain 
the national objective in South Vietnam 
with a minimum loss of American lives. Call 
this "bargain basement rates in American 
lives," if you will. 
Senator MANSFIELD: "And I suppose, final-
ly, Mr. President, one can say that negotia-
tions are bad; that you can't make peace by 
talking with the Vietcong or the North Viet-
namese or anyone else for that matter; you 
can only make peace by war and more war." 
The truth: Every Republican statement to 
which- the Senator's remarks refer were ut-
tered in the context of the pursuit of nego-
tiations. The Senator did not in either 
statement?nor could he?directly quote 
any Republican leader as having called for 
"total victory" as having said "negotiations 
are bad:" as having stated or implied that 
"you can only make peace by war and more 
This Republican would be very interested 
in seeing any quote that the Senator used 
upon which he based his gravely serious 
implications and charges.

They were met by Republican silence. 
It was sincerely hoped that by ignoring 
this fantastically distorted presentation of 
the Republican position by the President's 
majority leader, responsible discusaton could

policy could be restored. 
These hopes received a setback on July

the same inattention to what had actually 
been said, thus making efforts at reasonable 
discussion. impossible. 
It would serve no useful purpose to re-
spond, point by point and item by item, to 
the charges and innuendoes contained in the 
second speech for they are cut from the same 
artificial cloth as the first statement. 
I have been listening in vain since the 
speeches of the majority leader forsome voice 
of moderation from someone in his party?
for calm and objective discussion of pro-
posals made by some members of the minor-
ity party. 
The stakes in southeast Asia are too high 
for any responsible official to seek partisan 
advantage frorr. the situation there. Re-
publicans who speak out on Vietnam are 
_pointing out the course of action which they 
believe will promote the security of our Na-
tion. If they were motivated by considera-
tions of political gain, they would offer no 
suggestions. They would simply criticize the 
consequences of administration policy. 
I still hope that someone in the adminis-
tration will recognize the value of debate and 
discussion of foreign policy problems, and 
that Members of Congress again accord to 
each other the respectful hearing and the 
reasoned response without which debate can-
not be conducted. 
TALCOTT BILL TO AID FARM-
WORKERS 
(Mr. TALCOTT (at the request of Mr. 
HALL) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. TALCYTT. Mr. Speaker, I 
have today introduced legislation?H.R. 
10179--for the important twin goals of 
first protecting U.S. farmworkers from 
the depressing effects of cheap foreign 
agricuitural imports, and second, im-
proving the status of foreign farm-
workers. It 'would place Congress on 
record as opposing the importation of 
arrY agricultural commodity which is 
prOduced by low-wage foreign labor 
under substandard working conditions. 
Titled the "International Farm Labor 
and Working Conditions Act," my bill 
would authorize the Secretary of Labor, 
upon request, to conduct investigations 
of situations involving the importation 
of foreign farm products to determine if 
they were produced under depressive or 
substandard labor circumstances. 
If the Secretary found that the foreign 
workers- had been exploited he would 
determine the amount of import duty 
which would be necessary to remove this 
unfair cost advantage. He would submit 
his report and recommendations to Con-
gress for whatever action it might deem 
appropriate. 
The legislation wculd add an impor-
tant nevi' dimension to our international 
relations by imposing import duties on 
agricultural products to encourage for-
eign nations to elevate the wages and 
working conditions of their farmwork-
ers. It is a Unique and logical extension 
of our foreign aid program. 
Enactment of the International Farm 
Labor and Working Conditions Act 
would open the way to preventing for-
eign growers and processors from realiz-
ing enormous profits from the sale of 
farm products, produced with low-wage 
labor under substandard working condi-
tions, in the affluent U.S. market. 
I urge that hearings on H.R. 10179 
be scheduled at any early date. 
A section-by-section analysis of H.R. 
10179 follows:

CURTAILMENT OF POSTAL SERVICE 
TO RURAL AREAS 
(Mr. LANGEN (at the request of Mr. 
HALL) was granted permission to extend 
his remarks at this point in the RECORD 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. LANGEN. Mr. Speaker, today I 
requested an accounting by the Gendral 
Accounting Office of the actions of the 
U.S. Post Office Department in their 
curtailment of service to rural areas of 
the United States. 
I called for this accounting in view of 
the many complaints that have reached 
my office. There has been no one who 
has expressed any favor or approval of 
the changes in service. 
I have been meeting with Post Office 
Department officials in Washington in 
an attempt to find out their reasoning 
in the recent switch to star route mail 
service throughout much of the country, 
as well as the closing of many mail ter-
minals all over the United States and the 
removal of mail from Soo Line trains in 
my district. 
This drastic reduction in needed mail 
service to rural America has been mis-
represented as "improved service and 
savings" by the Post Office Departmnt 
They have stated that these changes 
would result in a reduced cost of opera-
tion and provide better service. Statis-
tics supplied this office do not leave any 
proof that either of these purposes has 
been or is being accomplished. 
I feel this investigation should include 
some accounting of the additional cost 
that would be required in providing the 
same delivery and dispatch service that 
was provided to the many rural commu-
nities throughout the Nation prior to the 
July 1 change to the star system. 
It should be emphasized that these 
people are not asking for any improve-
ment in service but only want mail dis-
patches and deliveries to be on the same 
basis as before the change was made. 
I hope that a GAO investigation of 
this matter would be as successful as the 
last one I called for. A year ago, my in-
quiries led to a GAO investigation of the 
Post Office Department's printing of 
stamped envelopes. This resulted in a 
$6 million saving to the U.S. taxpayer. 
Bureaucracy's war on rural America 
must be stopped. It just does not make 
sense to deliberately try to eliminate the 
very unit of our society that must be 
maintained if the Nation is to continue 
as the world's example of greatness 
through personal initiative. 
My letter to the GAO also contained a 
request for an accounting of the number 
of summer youth placement personnel 
that have been placed on the payroll and 
the total cost of the program in Minne-
sota.

This Is in the finest tradition of the 
America' legal system and the British 
legal system. Erskine, of England, was 
one of the great advocates of this system. 
Without it the judicial system would 
crumble in this country; and the same 
men who attack Abe Fortas today be-
cause he has had that courage might be 
the very people who would rely upon it 
in the future. 
The members of the Supreme Court 
are often subjected to the pressures of 
having to take positions which are not 
in accord with the popular will. When 
that happens it takes men of courage as 
well as learning, dedication, and erudi-
tion. I am confident Mr. Fortas has that 
courage. I am confident that that is the 
reason, Mr. Speaker, he has achieved the 
high office he has today. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Abe Fortas in 1943 
was the member of the President's Com-
mission to study changes in. the organic 
law of Puerto Rico. His friendship for 
that part of our land has been historic. 
It long preceded the election of the Dem-
ocratic President, Mr. Kennedy. His 
representation in this appointment mat-
ter, in which innuendo has ,been made, 
was in the tradition of helping that 
commonwealth, as he has traditionally 
over two decades. 
Mr. Speaker, MY objection to the at-
tack that was launched upon Mr. Fortes 
today is related to some degree to the 
willingness to those who made it to make 
it in public; that is, it was more a matter 
of innuendo than of hard fact. The 
statement that he enriched himself while 
on the public payroll insinutes many 
things but, I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that 
sort of insinuation has gone out of style 
in this country in most circles, and I 
would like to hope that the day will come 
when it will go out of style in all circles. 
My objection to the attack is based upon 
that. This was a series of innuendoes a 
man could make safely anywhere be-
cause they con s e. 
SUPPORT 
IDENT HN-
SON'S 'VIET POLICY 
(Mr. ROGEHS of Florida (at the re-
quest of Mr. CALLAN) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, it is clear from the decisions an-
nounced by the President concerning the 
turn of events in Vietnam that those de-
cisions have been reached after one of 
the most careful and exhausting reviews 
undertaken by any Chief of State in the 
history of this Nation. 
The President has restated that it is 
the Nation's position to be firm and res-
olute without being rash and bellicose. 
America will beckon the Communists 
toward a peaceful solution to Vietnam 
with one hand while holding U.S. armed 
might in the fist of the other hand. 
The President has demonstrated to 
the entire Nation that the gravity of 
Vietnam deserves the resources of rea-
son, not yielding to the temptations of 
frustration or temper. His actions dem-
onstrate the leadership which every na-
tion sees in America. 
This Nation has a duty to greatness, 
and in Vietnam and elsewhere on this 
earth Americans will continue to walk 
free because they know the consequence 
of faltering footsteps. 
The President's action will continue 
the consensus of America that freedom 
will be maintained. 
DRUG ABUSE CONTROL AMEND-
MENTS OF 1965 
(Mr. ROGERS of Florida (at the re-
quest of Mr. CALLAN) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
Point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, this session of the Congress has ac-
complished much in terms of legislative 
action, and stands as one of the most 
productive in the Nation's history al-
though the first session is not yet com-
pleted. 
Among the most outstanding accom-
plishments of this Congress Is the Drug 
Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, 
18073 
signed into law by the President July 15. 
With this new law we have erected a bul-
wark against a widespread menace to the 
public health, especially concerning the 
young people of America. 
As a member of the Interstate and 
Foreign Commerce Committee of the 
House, I was pleased to have participated 
in the formulation of this new law. The 
hearings conducted by the committee 
clearly showed that stronger legal ma-
chinery was needed to curb the illicit 
traffic or depressant and stimulant drugs. 
However, as a member of the committee, 
I was surprised to learn during hearings 
that the prescription drug industry itself 
had taken few if any significant meas-
ures toward self-regulation. 
For, example, the committee's House 
Report No. 130 reads: 
There is no level in the entire chain of 
distribution from manufacturer to consumer 
which does not today serve as a source of 
supply of depressant and stimulant drugs for 
the illicit trade. 
With the exception of the educational pro-
grams and the programs of cooperation with 
law-enforcement agencies and drug identi-
fication carried on by Smith, Kline, & 
French Laboratories of Philadelphia, Pa., to 
the committee's knowledge there has been 
little voluntary control activity on the part 
of those involved in the manufacture and 
distribution of these drugs to prevent or cur-
tail this illicit traffic. Of course, many per-
sons in the business of manufacture or dis-
tribution of these drugs check on the validity 
of their customers or proposed Customers. 
However, there has been a virtual dearth of 
voluntary self-regulation or of attempts 
thereat by the industry at any level. 
It was encouraging during the hearings 
to note that the drug industry itself was 
trying to bring about approaches toward 
a solution to the problem of illegal drug 
traffic in depressant and stimulant drugs. 
In reference to the committee report 
above, it must be noted that much can 
be done by the industry such as the pro-
grams implemented by the firm cited in 
the committee report. Similar measures 
might well be considered by other com-
panies in the field. 
The disturbing misuse of such drugs as 
barbiturates and amphetamines has been 
linked to the rising toll of highway acci-
dents as well as a factor in juvenile de-
linquency and crime. Only through the 
cooperation and assistance of the indus-
try itself will the fullest benefits of this 
law lessen the problems linked to the il-
licit drug trade. Industry cooperation is 
held to carry out the intent of the Con-
gress that this law be fully operative. 
THE NEGRO VOTE IN DETROIT, 
MICH., AND WHAT IT MEANS IN 
RACE RELATIONS 
(Mr. DIGGS (at the request of Mr. 
CALLAN) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. DIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I call to 
the attention of my colleagues an excel-
lent report on Detroit's progress in race 
relations, by Stanley H. Brown, in the 
June issue of Fortune magazine, "De-
troit: Slow Healing of a Fractured City."

DETROIT : SLOW HEALING OF A FRACTURED OFTT 
(By Stanley H. Brown) 
"City fair, 
Shining there, 
In your place beneath the sun, 
All the world is watching you. 
Detroit is marching on." 
Thus in their innocence sang the school-
children of Detroit a quarter of a century 
ago. Hardly anyone remembers, let alone 
sings, that song today, and few recall the 
emotions and events that made that piece of 
doggerel so patently false a picture of their 
city; In the 1920's a politically powerful 
Ku Klux Klan, said to be the biggest in the 
country, actually elected a mayor. In the 
1930's the city's violent, depression-fanned 
insecurities produced the xenophobic, mur-
derous Black Legion, while old Henry Ford 
was financing publication of an anti-Semitic 
tract called "The Protocols of the Elders of 
Zion" and Father Charles Coughlin preached 
"social justice" and railed against the evils 
of "international Jewry." In 1937, Ford 
Motor Co. guards beat bloody two young 
auto union organizers, Walter Reuther and 
Richard Frankensteen, in the notorious 
Battle of the Overpass at the gates of the 
spectacular River Rouge plant. At the end 
of the decade a woman's suicide started an 
investigation of gambling and prostitution 
that put Detroit's mayor, the county prose-
cuting attorney, and scores of police in 
prison. And in 1943 a series of racial inci-
dents finally erupted into the great Detroit 
race riot, which killed at least 34 and 
wounded hundred before Federal troops and 
armored cars occupied the city. The kids 
obviously didn't know what they were sing-
ing about. 
Sometime after World War II, however, the 
dreary, angry factory town began its meta-
morphosis. Detroit may still be nothing 
more than a synonym for the auto industry 
to people who have. never been there, and 
an epithet on the lips of the traveling sales-
man looking for a good time. The social 
mullets, the physical drabness, and the cul-
tural desolation have by no means vanished. 
Some aspects of the transformation may be 
nothing more than evanescent byproducts of 
the bounteous prosperity of the auto indus-
try during the past 4 years. Others may be 
long overdue for any city the size and age 
of Detroit. And some of the brave plans and 
prograrfis are based on unrealistic estimates 
of the resources and sophistication of the 
community. The avid boosters who talk of 
a renaissance are surely being dazzled by 
their own enthusiasm. 
Still, a new consensus is abroad in the city. 
All the diverse elements that make up 
Detroit's power structure, once divided and 
pitted against itself, are being welded to-
gether in a remarkable synthesis. Every 
significant accomplishment in such major 
areas as race relations, urban renewal, and 
the arts whether initiated by a single in-
dividual or by one special interest?has be-
come the province of a board or committee 
that includes representatives of the United 
Auto Workers, one or more of the city's utili-
ties, the clergy, ethnic groups, retailers, the 
auto companies, real estate interests, finance, 
the press, political groups, and any other 
relevant interests. And the achievement of 
the city is discernible as much in the almost 
palpable determination of its citizenry to 
confront its problems and attempt their 
solution as it is in the marked changes that 
these groups have already Wrought. - 
Though the consensus may appear to en-
compass a breadth of forces unlikely to do 
much more than create an aura of civic 
virtue, in Detroit the synthesized power 
structure has surprising effect. It is true 
that In most instances the names of board or 
committee members are no more than names. 
The presence of an auto executive or a 
banker on a board offers no assurance that 
his employer will supply anything More than 
good wishes. Nevertheless, sufficient sup-
port from diverse and even conflicting inter-
ests?particularly from the UAW and the 
automobile industry?can generally be 
counted on to elicit enough lipservIce, man-
power, and money to achieve an objective. 
Few of the city's leaders are willing to stand 
in open opposition to the consensus. 
Of all the accomplishments in the recent 
history of the city, the most significant is 
the progress Detroit has made in race rela-
tions. The grim specter of the 1943 riots 
never quite fades from the minds of the city's 
leaders. As much as anything else, that 
specter has enabled the power structure to 
overcome tenacious prejudice and give the 
Negro community a role in the consensus 
probably unparalleled in any major Ameri-
can city. So widespread is Detroit's under-
standing that the Negro's cry for equality 
must be heard that in 1963, when Walter 
Reuther initiated the Citizens Committee for 
Equal Opportunity to relieve mounting 
tensions over Negro efforts for civil rights, 
every business, labor, social, religious, ethnic, 
financial, and political group of consequence 
in the city sent its top man. Joseph Ross, 
president of Federal Department Stores, a 
chain that finds most of its customers among 
the city's industrial workers, has been a store 
executive in New York, Newark, Dallas, 
Atlanta, and Denver, and he says, "Detroit is 
more sophisticated in race relations than any 
other city I know." 
THE PRIDE OF CITY HALL 
Any effort to attribute the city's awaken-
ing to a particular event or individual would 
be an oversimplification. It would ignore the 
broad changes in our national life and 
Federal policy that have affected every city 
in the last three decades, and would over-
look the reaction inevitably generated in 
Detroit by shame over past neglect. But the 
new consensus has found itself a most ap-
propriate image in the city's 37-year-old 
mayor, Jerome Patrick Cavanagh. His record 
in office and his ability to engender pride 
and enthusiasm among as disparate a group 
of supporters as ever a political ?facial is 
likely to acquire are impressive, And they 
take on more luster in the light of the fact 
that during the campaign 4 years ago Cav-
anagh was virtually unknown, a struggling 
lawyer with nothing to lose and almost no 
support from any part of the established 
leadership. He was opposed then by both 
newspapers, both political parties, all the 
business leaders, and by the AFT.,-CIO. 
Cavanagh came to power on a wave of 
Negro votes. The Negro community had a 
major grievance against his opponent, the 
incumbent mayor, and it evidently gave Cav-
anagh its almost total support. His upset 
election was, as much as anything, the 
product of Negro concern that egregious 
bungling of some recent problems could 
thwart racial progress in the city. But the 
margin of Cavanagh's victory (40,000 of 360,-
000 votes cast) indicated more than that. 
By electing Cavanagh so resoundingly, the 
community was expressing a decision that it 
would not extend the string of mayors who 
were at best lackluster bureaucrats, that it 
wanted its change of mood and direction to 
go all the way to the top. Cavanagh ob-
viously sensed Detroit's new spirit and based 
his campaign on the city's needs and prob-
lems, vigorously countering the city fathers' 
adamant insistence that everything was 
dandy. 
Once in office, the mayor quickly seized 
the opportunity to establish himself as the 
symbol of the city's aspirations. Abjuring 
the stolid postures of his predecessors, Cav-
anagh from the outset projected energy, wit, 
charm, cander, and even intellect. The 
books on his desk may have their titles de-
liberately turned toward the visitor, but 
the mayor reads them, and they include 
works of St. Thomas Aquinas, Kennedy-
Johnson braintruster Walt W. Rostow, lib-
eral cartoonist Herblock, and Dag Ham-
raarskjoid. Heavily Roman Catholic, pre-
dominantly liberal Democratic (though 
municipal elections are nonpartisan), and 
eagerly seeking modernity and culture, De-
troit has found just the man to embody its 
collective yearning to remake itself into an 
authentic Metropolis. Significantly, the 
mayor's first executive order called for equal 
opportunity for Negroes in city jobs. 
THE VOICE WILL BE HEARD 
? 
Having been instrumental in the election 
of Cavanagh, the Negro community was as-
sured that its voice would be heard. Al-
though the Detroit Negro has no single 
leader who acts as his spokesman, many 
Negroes have long had access to the power 
structure and, in fact, several are part of it 
Horace Sheffield, a staff employee of the 
UAW, also happens to be the founder of 
the Trade Union Leadership Council. Cre-
ated in 1957 as a protest organization to get 
more jobs for Negroes in union-controlled 
skilled trades, the TULC is now active in 
other aspects of community life as well. 
Discussing Negro participation in the city's 
consensus of power, he reflected, "Where 
else could you arrange to meet with people 
like Joe Hudson [head of J. L. Hudson Co., 
after Macy's the country's biggest depart-
ment store] or the head of the Detroit Bank 
& Trust Co., or the personnel director of 
General Motors on 3 or 4 hours' notice?" 
Now that it is represented, the Negro com-
munity intends to play an increasingly im-
portant role in the life of the city. For as 
long as most white people can remember, 
Negroes have had access to Detroit's hotels, 
restaurants, and other public accommoda-
tions without incident. But it is only since 
the days of World War II that the Negro 
has been able fully to share in the prosperity 
of the auto industry, largely as a result of 
UAW insistence that all production jobs in 
the plants be open to Negroes at pay equal 
to that of whites. So the Negroes have begun 
to move out of their once clearly defined 
ghettos into the middle-class white neigh-
borhoods that increasing numbers of 
them can afford. Often their way has been 
marked by a good deal of resistance. Many 
neighborhoods were finally yielded up to 
them completely by whites, who fled to the 
suburbs. Other sections, though, including 
some choice ones, have arrived at and main-
tained a fairly stable integrated composition. 
Negroes in Detroit have deep roots in the 
community, compared with the more tran-
sient populations of Negro ghettos in Har-
lem and elsewhere in the North. Homeown-
ership is high; roughly 65,000 families?more 
than 40 percent of the Negro population?
own their own houses. Negroes are suffi-
ciently well organized socially and politically 
to have elected a member to the Detroit Com-
mon Council in a citywide election. They 
have also lected 3 local judges, 10 State leg-
islators, and 2 Congressmen (Michigan's is 
the only congressional delegation in Wash-
ington with 2 Negroes) . Federal District 
Judge Wade H. McCree, Jr., is a Negro who, 
before his Federal appointment, sat as a 
county circuit judge. Mayor Cavanagh's first 
appointment went to a Negro, Alfred Pelham, 
a fiscal expert on the staff of Wayne State 
University. 
HANDS ACROSS THE BARGAINING TABLE 
Detroit's achievements reach beyond the 
inclusion on decent terms of the Negro seg-
ment of the population. The consensus has 
also established a profitable stability in the 
community's industrial relations. Virulent 
labor hating is now considered bad taste 
and?in view of the UAW's pervasive social 
and political power?bad tactics as well. De-
spite harsh pronouncements from both sides 
during contract negotiations, once bitterly 
fought wars have now become hard-played 
games for high stakes at the bargaining table,

CHALLENGE TO THE MISSISSIPPI 
DELEGATION UNNECESSARILY DE-
LAYED 
The SPEAKER, pro tempore. Under 
special order of the House, the gentleman 
from New York [Mr. RYAN] 13 recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, the Clerk of 
the House has informed me that he has 
transmitted to the Speaker printed dep-
ositions filed in connection with the chal-
lenge to the Mississippi congressional 
delegation. This record has been re-
ferred to the House Administration Com-
mittee. 
Resolution of the challenge has al-
ready been delayed unnecessarily. Un-
der rule XI, section 24, of the House, the 
committee was to report its findings by 
July 4-6 months after the convening of 
the House. The delay in the printing of 
the record made it impossible for the 
committee to act by July 4. Now that 
the record is before the House Adminis-
tration Committee it is time to act. 
I am impatient with those who call 
for additional study and committee in-
vestigation. Who among us can deny the 
systematic exclusion of Negroes from 
from Mississippi polls? Who among us 
has not been convinced by the debate on 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 of Mississippi's 
deliberate violation of the Constitution? 
Have we not been shown the subtle and 
the not so subtle techniques used to deny 
the Mississippi Negro his right to vote? 
Who can deny the fact that the white 
power structure of that State has perpet-
uated itself by trapping the Negro in a 
poverty of power? Never before, Mr. 
Speaker, has any issue been so thor-
oughly documented prior to a committee 
hearing. 
According to the Congressional Quar-
terly of 1901, the following were the fig-
No. 138-13 
ures for nonwhite registration In each of 
the five Mississippi congressional dis-
tricts: First District, 1.3 percent of the 
nonwhites of voting age registered to 
vote; Second District, 6.8 percent of the 
nonwhites of voting age registered to 
vote; Third District, 9.1 percent of the 
nonwhites of voting age registered to 
vote; Fourth District, 5.1 percent of the 
nonwhites of voting age registered to 
vote; Fifth District, 12.3 percent of the 
nonwhites registered to vote. 
The exclusion of Negroes from the Mis-
sissippi polls is not an accident. As early 
as 1870 U.S. Senator George, of Missis-
sippi, explained that the purpose of Mis-
sissippi voting laws is "to devise such 
measures, consistent with the Constitu-
tion of the United States, as will enable 
us to maintain a home government un-
der the control of the white people of 
the State." 
Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the 
terror, violence, and murder perpetrated 
last summer upon those who attempted 
to help their fellow citizens exercise their 
right to vote. Mississippi tramples upon 
the U.S. Constitutioli by denying citizens 
the right to vote. 
I have made this argument on the 
opening day of Congress when I objected 
to the seating of the Members-elect from 
Mississippi. I have listened to those who 
ask for additional study. But the issue, 
Mr. Speaker, will not be resolved by sta-
tistics. The issues, frankly, are moral 
and political. They are stark and sim-
ple. They involve matters of dedication 
and commitment to the Constitution of 
the United States by those who hold 
high office in the Federal Government. 
My plea, 'Mr. Speaker, is for prompt 
review and prompt resolution. It is easy 
to tiptoe through this session of Con-
gress keeping away from sharp corners. 
But if we do so, we will adjourn without 
exercising our solemn obligation to the 
Constitution. We will have forfeited a 
confidence in this Congress, a confidence 
which depends on the courage to act on 
this most fundamental issue. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing I wish to read 
from a message written by Mr. and Mrs. 
Robert Goodman after the murder of 
their son, Andrew, in Philadelphia, Miss.: 
In Washington 4 weeks ago, my wife and I 
In a sense made a pilgrimage to the Lincoln 
Memorial In the evening and stood in that 
great shrine looking down past the Wash-
ington Monument toward the soft glow of 
the light around the White House. Full of 
the awe of a great nation that surrounded 
us, we turned to read, emblazoned in black 
letters on white marble: "It is for us the 
living to dedicate ourselves that these dead 
shall n1t5Ve di 
THE 
AM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
previous order of the House, the gentle-
man from California [Mr. Consx.Ax], 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COHELAN. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Johnson was sober and realistic 
at his press conference yesterday. He 
announced that we were increasing our 
military commitment in order to meet 
the increasing aggressive activities di-
rected by North Vietnam. He made 
clear that we were increasing our diplo-
matic efforts, that we were willing to 
discuss Hanoi's proposals or the propo-
sals of any other nation, and that we 
were once again asking the United Na-
tions to take a larger and more active 
role in achieving an early and peaceful 
settlement. He also, for the present at 
least, rejected the cries of the "war 
hawks" for a major callup of the Re-
serves and the use of 200,000 American 
troops or more. 
Let me make it clear initially, Mr. 
Speaker, that I support the President 
in his decision to resist the terror and 
aggression that denies independence of 
choice and self-determination to the peo-
ple of South Vietnam. 
But let us emphasize that the real 
Issue in Vietnam is not our "honor" or 
our "word." We did not begin our pro-
gram of aid and support in 1954 as a test 
of national honor. Then and now the 
real test is whether terror and violence 
are to triumph over the ballot and free 
choice; of whether so-called wars of na-
tional liberation, controlled and directed 
externally, will supplant peaceful de-
cisions and orderly change arrived at in-
ternally. 
Our proper goal has and should con-
tinue to be to help in every way we 
reasonable can to insure that the people 
of South Vietnam will be able to partici-
pate freely in the determination of their 
own future; not that they would have it 
decided for them, as is the Communist 
goal today. 
But our policy has raised serious ques-
tions in the minds of many Americans. 
When I was at home a week ago, many 
constituents whose opinions I value and 
respect, were deeply troubled. They 
asked many questions which I feel should 
be publicly discussed and which I have 
asked both the White House and the 
State Department to discuss. They 
wanted to know: 
First. What did the 1954 Geneva ac-
cords provide with respect to the future 
government of North and South Viet-
nam? 
Second. Why did the United States 
not sign the Geneva accords? Did the 
United States state that it would follow 
the Geneva accords? 
Third. Was a "government" repre-
senting South Vietnam a party to the 
Geneva accords? How did the first 
South Vietnamese Government come 
Into power? Has there been any gov-
ernment in South Vietnam chosen to

Vietnam? If so, are there practical rea-
sons for our not having made this re-
quest up to this time? 
Eighth. What efforts have been made 
by the United States to substitute nego-
tiation for military action? 
Ninth. It is often said that we must 
stay in South Vietnam to prevent the 
spread of communism in southeast Asia. 
Is the main purpose of our policy to fore-
stall a Communist government in South 
Vietnam? Or is it to enable the People 
of South Vietnam to establish whatever 
kind of goverrttnent they want? 
Tenth. Assuming that what we are 
doing in Vietnam is morally and legally 
justified, is it wise and sound from the 
viewpoint of effectiveness? Can we, 
within reasonable and practicable cost 
considerations, achieve a military vic-
tory or are we in effect repeating 
Napoleon's disastrous march to Moscow? 
Would we be more likely to achieve the 
ends we desire if we were to let the 
people of South Vietnam struggle with 
this problem by themselves and in the 
process perhaps develop enough nation-
alism to resist control by China? 
Eleventh. President Kennedy stated on 
numerous occasions that the war in Viet-
nam was a Vietnamese war; that it must 
be won or lost by the people of South 
Vietnam themselves. Does our increas-
ing commitment of troops, planes and 
supporting material mean that we have 
abandoned this policy? 
Mr. Speaker, many of these same ques-
tions have troubled me and I intend to 
place the replies in the RECORD. 
But even when these questions are con-
sidered, and I think there are reasonable 
answers to most, if not all of them, I do 
not believe, considering the alternatives 
and their imPlications, that there is any 
reasonable alternative to our present 
course of action. 
Major escalation on our part could 
only invite increased efforts by Hanoi and 
Peiping. It could mean introduction of 
thousands more troops from North Viet-
nam, and quite possibly divisions or even 
armies from China. It could mean 
stepped up 'U.S. air attacks. It could 
mean expansion of these attacks to cen-
ters of population and industry in North 
Vietnam, and it could mean the commit-
menton the ground of many more Amer-
ican forces and lives. 
Leaders of the Republican Party in the 
House it is true, have argued that "total 
victory" is possible; that the war, in fact, 
can be "won" if only we were willing. 
But it should be nbted that this war 
could be "won" in this way only at a cost 
far in excess of our goals and our re-
quirements. Such a "victory" in the 
wake of the destruction, the devastation 
and the countless maimings and deaths 
would mark it a hollow triumph at best. 
On the other hand, unconditional 
withdrawal by American forces, as the 
Communists have demanded, is equally 
unconscionable. Independence would 
not only be doomed in South Vietnam, it 
would be jeopardized from Thailand to 
Australia, from India to the Philip-
pines. 
It would be unconscionable, as the 
distinguished chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations stated 
in his thoughtful speech of June 15,."be-
cause such action would betray our obli-
gation to people we have promised to de-
fend, because it would weaken or destroy 
the credibility of American guarantees 
to other countries, and because such a 
withdrawal would encourage the view in 
Peiping and elsewhere that guerrilla wars 
supported from outside are a relatively 
safe and inexpensive way of expanded 
Communist power." 
It would be unconscionable, for if inde-
pendence is as vital as this country has 
maintained for nearly 200 years, then it 
should be the right of all who truly want 
It and not just of the few who are 
capable of defending it. 
Where then do we go? If both major 
escalation into a much larger war and 
the abandonment of independence are 
intolerable choices, what path should we 
pursue? 
The only reasonable course, it seems to 
me, was outlined yesterday by the Presi-
dent. First, we must provide sufficient 
arms to convince Hanoi and Peiping, 
and Moscow as well, that wars of "na-
tional liberation" based on terror and in-
timidation and naked force will not suc-
ceed. Our arms should be used in suffi-
cient force to persuade the adversaries of 
open societies that discussions and nego-
tiations, not bombs and bullets, are the 
only sensible way to settle problems. Our 
arms should be available for as long as 
they are necessary but for no longer than 
they are necessary and in no greater 
strength than they are necessary. 
Second, we must continue to follow 
every path and pursue every opportunity 
that can lead to negotiations, to a cease-
fire and to a diplomatic settlement that 
can guarantee the people of South Viet-
nam independence of choice in any fu-
ture government and any future way of 
life, free of outside intimidation or inter-
vention. 
We should have no quarrel with this 
choice so long as it is free. We should 
have no vested interest save that of inde-
pendence and a better life for our fellow 
men. 
There can be no question that the 
Communists, whether they be in South 
Vietnam, North Vietnam, or Communist 
China, have been deaf to all offers of ne-
gotiation which have been made to date. 
Not only have they rejected our repeated 
bids for "unconditional discussions." 
They have refused the plea of 17 non-
alined chiefs of state for negotiations, the 
French suggestion of a new Geneva con-
ference without preconditions, the Soviet 
and American endorsement of a Cam-
bodian conference, U.N. Secretary Gen-
eral U Thant's offer of exploration, In-
dia's proposal for a cease-fire monitored 
by an Afro-Asian force, the invitation of 
the U.N. Security Council for a complete 
review and discussion, the peace mission 
of the British Commonwealth Prime 
Minister, and others. 
This record of intransigence is without 
exception. But it should not and it must 
not deter our continued and persistent 
efforts, and our support of the efforts of 
others, to bring together all of the parties 
who are involved in the conflict in Viet-
nam. The so-called National Liberation 
Front is certainly no more than what its 
July 29, 1965 
name implies, a front. But surely there 
is no reason why North Vietnam could 
not include its members, the Vietcong, or 
any other parties it desires, or any team 
of representatives it sends to the nego-
tiation table. And we should negotiate 
with that team, whomever it contains. 
A much larger presence and a greater 
role of participation should be encour-
aged for the United Nations, the world 
organization which has performed so val-
iantly and successfully in many trouble 
spots of the world for the last 20 years. 
I am particularly pleased that the Presi-
dent is calling on this resource, as I have 
been urging for some time, and that he 
has sent a special message with Ambassa-
dor Goldberg to U.N. Secretary General 
U Thant. He is to be strongly com-
mended for this effort and we can only 
fervently hope that the Secretary Gen-
eral will be able to utilize his offices to 
good effect. Certainly we should sup-
port him in any constructive efforts he is 
able to initiate. Certainly the United 
Nations should be encouraged in every 
way possible to provide the machinery 
for bringing this matter to the interna-
tional conference table, for policing a 
cease-fire, and for insuring free elections. 
It may well be, Mr. Speaker, that 
Hanoi and Vietcong have no intention of 
lessening their aggression at the present 
time. This makes two requirements on 
our policy, as was suggested last month 
by the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. 
FULBRIGHT] and which was stressed by 
the President yesterday. 
First, we must sustain the Government 
and the Army of South Vietnam. We 
must persuade the Communists that 
Saigon cannot be crushed and that the 
forces of the free world will not be driven 
out by force. 
Second, we must practice patience and 
restraint. We must continue to offer the 
Communists a reasonable alternative to 
war, and we must continue to press for a 
peaceful settlement at the earliest pos-
sible time. 
Mr. Speaker, several leading Repub-
lican policymakers have suggested that 
our country would accept a continued 
American presence in Vietnam, includ-
ing any necessary troop buildup, if and 
only if our objective was total victory; 
not if it were a negotiated settlement. 
I reject this suggestion. I believe it 
misinterprets and misrepresents the true 
feeling of the American people. This 
feeling, I believe, is one of rightful anx-
iety. It is one of willingness to contrib-
ute and to sacrifice; to pay the cost fl 
freedom; to be a leader of the free world. 
But it is one also which seeks independ-
ence and the other legitimate aspirations 
of men through peaceful means. Our 
policy and our efforts should be directed 
at no lesser goal. 
Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I include 
two editorials from this morning's Wash-
ington Post, one by the distinguished 
columnist Chalmers Roberts, which 
speak directly and thoughtfully to the 
Points I have discussed:

'7  
namhse war with an escalation of his peace 
efforts. Draft calls are to be doubled in 
the months ahead, and there will be a rapid 
.buildup of American fighting men in the 
besieged southeast Asian country. But the 
aim of protecting freedom and independence 
from Conirnunist aggression without resort 
to general war remains the same. 
The President made another graceful ap-
peal to the United Nations to exert whatever 
influence it can to halt the aggression in 
Vietnam. At the same time, he offered to 
discuss Hanoi's proposals along with our own 
and those of any other interested nation 
that may care to sit down at a conference 
table. His sincere desire to substitute the 
conference table for the battlefield took 
away any suggestion of belligerence that 
might otherwise have been read into the 
announcement of expanding military opera-
tions. 
The gist of what the President had to 
say is that the United States places such a 
high value on peace that it is willing to 
fight for it. The spread of Asian com-
munism by terror and slaughter is the an-
tithesis of both peace and freedom. The 
United States has attempted to provide a 
Shield against this menace. It is now called 
Upon to demonstrate that this shield is 
not an illusion. 
We do not see how President Johnson could 
have explained the necessity of the U.S. 
course in Vietnam more effectively than he 
did: 
"If we are driven from the fields in Viet-
nam, then no nation can ever again have 
the same confidence in our promise of pro-
tection. In each land the forces of inde-
pendence would be weakened. An Asia so 
threatened by Communist domination would 
Imperil the security of the United States 
itself. * ? * 
"We just cannot now dishonor our word 
or abandon our commitment or leave those 
who believed us and who trusted us to the 
terror and repression and murder that would 
follow. This, then, my fellow Americans, is 
Why we are in Vietnam." 
The President's reference to Asian commu-
nism doubtless holds special significance. His 
exclusion of the Russians from his comments 
was an indirect appeal for Moscow's under-
standing of why we must do what we are 
doing. The Soviet Union shares at least some 
of the alarm in the West over the openly 
belligerent and recklessly aggressive course 
of Communist China and the Hanoi govern-
ment. President Johnson seemed to be say-
ing to Moscow that the United States is doing 
everything possible to avoid a general war 
and that the two major nuclear powers have 
a common interest in not allowing this Asian 
Communist brushfire to get out of hand for 
want of a rational confrontation at a con-
ference table. 
Within the United States, we surmise that 
the response to the President's speech will be 
overwhelmingly favorable. Despite the in-
nate hatred of wax, most of the people are 
aware of the kind of world we live in. They 
appear to be reconciled to a hard struggle in 
a faraway land because of the close relation 
It has to the preservation of our own free-
dom. Many of those who are committed to 
the general policy, however, retain some con-
cern over the way it is being carried out. 
One would, hope that much of the discus-
sion in the White House conferences of the 
last week has been given to effective employ-
ment of the additional manpower and equip-
ment that are flowing to Vietnam. It is not 
enough merely to build up larger forces and 
the volume of supplies. With the extension 
of military might in Vietnam, there will be 
increasing need for wise decisions and sound 
strategy. This perceptive statement on the 
part of the President also greatly strengthens 
confidence that he will be as firm in pushing 
for a ratieflal Settlement as he has been in 
trying to teach the Communists that peace 
cannot be bought with terror and aggression. 
From the Washington Post, July 29, 19653 
GUARDIAN AT THE GATE: WORLD SEES A 
DETERMINED JOHNSON 
(By Chalmers M. Roberts) 
It was not a happy President Johnson the 
Nation saw yesterday. But it was a deter-
mined President. 
"We did not choose to be the guardians at 
the gate," he said, "but there is no one else." 
That single sentence explains a lot about the 
man and his approach to the war in Vietnam. 
Because of what he said last fall in the 
presidential campaign against Barry Gold-
water, a lot of people concluded that he 
wanted to liquidate the war as quickly as 
possible. Indeed, it is clear that a number 
of Communist diplomats here told their gov-
ernments just that. 
That conclusion was based on a misunder-
standing of Lyndon Johnson. He did want 
to liquidate the war?he does want to liqui-
date it now?but not on terms of surrender. 
For a long time Mr. Johnson resisted say-
ing out loud that the conflict in Vietnam 
was a crucial one between communism and 
democracy or between China and the United 
States. Only slowly and reluctantly did he 
come to do so. 
Like most Americans, as he emotionally 
made evident yesterday, he would prefer to 
concentrate on improving our domestic life. 
But history caught up with him, and he is 
determined to face history. 
The Vietcong attacks on American person-
nel, the hard words from North Vietnam and 
the shrill language from China all drove 
him, however reluctantly, to conclude that 
here was a place that the United States had 
to make a stand. 
If the Communists had offered to sit down 
at the conference table, the fighting could 
have stopped long ago. It is quite likely, 
too, that the result would have been a gain 
in the Communist position in southeast 
Asia. But in rejecting the conference table, 
the Communists gave Mr. Johnson no option 
except to fight. 
Slowly, then, a rationale for American 
military activity has been developed. As 
John F. Kennedy did in the Cuban missile 
crisis, Mr. Johnson yesterday referred to the 
appeasement of Hitler in the 1930's and the 
lesson to be drawn from it. 
The furious' Communist offensive in Viet-
nam, coupled with the Chinese demands to 
smash the United States in that corner of 
Asia, left him, he felt, no choice but to send 
in more Americans to act as "the guardians 
of the gate." 
Lyndon Johnson is both a coolly calcu-
lating man and an emotionally patriotic 
man. Both these sides of his personality 
were evident yesterday. 
His new military steps are calculated to 
deny the Communists a military victory; his 
diplomatic steps are designed to ease the 
path to the conference table. But he 
doubtless has no illusions that the Commu-
nists will agree to negotiate until they are 
convinced that American power is fully 
committed to the war and that It can be 
decisive. 
Slowly, as he has sought a way out of 
Vietnam, Mr. Johnson has come to describe 
the stakes in sharper terms. Now he has 
reached the point of saying that the United 
Stat? cannot escape the role of guardian 
at the gate in this "remote and distant 
place." 
Those who have viewed the President as a 
reckless plunger. should be reassured by his 
efforts to avoid a rupture with the Soviet 
Union. Certainly he meant it when he said 
that "I don't think I have any right to com-
mit the whole world to world war III." 
Those who believe he has been too cautious 
In his application of military force may not 
be wholly satisfied with the new decisions 
he outlined yesterday. But they can find 
satisfaction in the firm determination, now 
that the United States is so fully committed, 
to see it through to the end. 
Lyndon Johnson yesterday was not a happy 
guardian at the gate. But he certainly was 
determined. 
The purpose of yesterday's public appear-
ance before the Nation was to show that 
determination. He succeeded. 
A second purpose was to answer the ques-
tion of the mother who had written to ask 
"why" her son had to fight in Vietnam. 
Here, at least, he made a convincing case. 
Finally, he sought to show that the United 
States carries an olive branch as well as 
thunderbolts. Here he is willing to talk 
about even the Communist demand that all 
Americans be withdrawn. It is hard to see 
how critics could ask for more, unless they 
would have the United States accept 
surrender. 
LAG IN FEDERAL FUNDS CURTAILS 
STATE HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
previous order of the House, the gentle-
man from Missouri [Mr. HirmA, is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HULL. Mr. Speaker, Missouri is 
in the forefront of States in this Nation 
in developing modern roads for its citi-
zens. 
Planning and early construction of in-
terstate highway routes in Missouri were 
under the direction of the Honorable Rex 
M. Whitton, then chief engineer of the 
Missouri Highway Department and now 
Federal Highway Administrator_ 
Mr. Whitton's work has been carried 
on by our present extremely able chief 
engineer, Marvin 3. Snider, resulting in 
continued progress in building Missouri 
highways. 
In a recent speech to the Ozark Chap-
ter of the Missouri Society of Profes-
sional Engineers in Springfield, Mo., Mr. 
Snider outlined the programs and the 
problems of highway builders in Mis-
souri. 
Under unanimous consent I include 
Mr. Snider's speech: 
LAG IN FEDERAL FUNDS CURTAILS STATE 
HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION 
It is a sincere pleasure for me to have the 
opportunity to meet with your organization 
this evening to discuss the progress of Mis-
souri's State highway program. 
From the outset I would say that State 
highway progress in Missouri is relatively 
good. I use the term "relatively good" be-
cause, due to a constant lack of sufficient 
highway funds, our rate of roadbuilding 
improvements certainly is not what it should 
be in order to provide an adequate State 
road system for motorists. 
However, the historical shortage of high-
way funds is a story in itself and I will not 
go into it further during this meeting. 
My remarks this evening will be devoted 
to a twofold discussion of Missouri's highway 
progress. 
First, I will report briefly on the progress 
being made by the State highway depart-
ment with the funds that are available. 
Second, and most importantly, I want to 
explain about a financial difficulty which has 
arisen at the Federal level in the last few 
months, and which is causing a curtailment 
in State highway construction in Missouri 
this year. 
It is a curtailment that we can ill afford 
because of the extreme importance of build-
ing and improving highways as rapidly as 
possible to serve the constantly growing de-
mands of traffic. Nevertheless, the cutback 
in highway work is with us, resulting in de-
lays in awarding a number of construction 
contracts in many areas of the State. I be-
lieve it is important for Missourians to know

18090 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE July 29, 1965 
about this situation and understand why it 
Is happening. 
PROGRESS IN 1964 
AS to progress made in calendar 1964, it 
pleases me to report that last year saw the 
greatest single surge of State roadbuilding in 
Missouri's history. 
During 1964 the State highway department 
carried on a construction and right-of-way 
program amounting to about $192,500,000. 
This VMS some $1'7 million larger than the 
previous high recorded in 1963. 
I don't want to confuse you with a lot of 
figures, but I believe it will be helpful to 
point out how the $192,500,000 which made 
up the 1964 construction and right-of-way 
program was used: 
For actual highway construction, $156,-
700,000 was spent or obligated; $33,600,000 
was spent to acquire right-of-way; $2,100,-
000 Was obligated for the 1965 secondary 
(farm to market) system road oiling pro-
gram, work which now is going on since this 
is a warm weather operation; and $115,000 
was spent to install flashing light signals at 
railroad croesings. 
Even more meaningf?ul than money figures 
is the fact that 924 miles of highway con-
struction projects were awarded to contract 
last year. They included: 
One hundred and seventy miles of work on 
the Interstate System, the nationwide super-
highway network now under construction 
throughout America, and which is made up 
of highways like Interstate Routes 44 and 70. 
Four hundred and thirty-one miles of im-
provements were contracted on the primary 
system, which consists of conventional 
trunkline highways like U.S. Routes 54, 63, 65, 
and 71. 
Two hundred and ninety-seven miles of 
construction on the secondary system, made 
up mainly of lettered State highways pro-
viding local service such as Routes M, FF, 
C, or rr. 
Twenty-six miles of improvements were 
placed under contract on the urban system 
of highways, which fire extensions of primary 
and secondary system routes into urban 
areas. ? 
In addition, about 1,200 miles of secondary 
system roads now are receiving an oil sur-
face treatment to make them dust free under 
the oiling program authorized last year. 
So by an previous standards, 1964 was a 
banner roadbuilding year for the State of 
Missouri. And another substantial year, al-
though not scheduled to be as impressive 
as the one just passed, was in prospect for 
1965. 
At the beginning of the present calendar 
year, the State highway deportment esti-
mated that it would have a construction and 
right-of-way program amounting to about 
$165,500,000 during 1965. This was to in-
clude $131,600,000 in construction work to 
be awarded to contract; $26,300,000 for the 
purchase of right-of-way; and $7,600,000 for 
preliminary engineering, the obligation of 
fluids for the 1966 secondary system road oil-
ing program and the installation of flashing 
light signals at railroad crossings. 
The estimate for 1965 was considerably 
under accomplishments of 1964 mainly for 
two reason. In the first place, it was pur-
posely on the conservative side and repre-
sented a figure the department felt certain 
could be attained. Secondly, we knew there 
would not be as much money available in 
1965. In 1964 the department was antici-
pating later reimbursement by the Federal 
Government of several millions of dollars 
which had been tied up in right of way pur-
chases for a number of years, and therefore 
was able to obligate against these funds. 
LAG IN FEDERAL FUNDS BEGINS 
At any rate, the department began the 
1965 calendar year on a note of optimism, 
With an anticipated minimum construction 
and right at Way program of about 
$185,500,000. 
But then along in late February the Fed-
eral funds situation which I mentioned 
earlier began to develop, and it has worsened 
gradually ever since. 
In beginning an explanation of what has 
been and still is happening, I want to point 
out that the financing of State highway con-
struction is a very complicated matter. 
However, I will try to keep my remarks as 
simple as possible in order to get this message 
across. 
Missouri's State highways are built with 
money received from taxes levied by the 
State and Federal Governments on highway 
users. 
Taxes levied by the State of Missouri in-
clude the motor vehicle fuel tax, commonly 
called the gasoline tax; license fees for motor 
vehicles; drivers license fees; and the motor 
vehicle use tax, which is equivalent to a 
sales tax on vehicle purchases made by 
Missourians in other States. 
Highway user taxes levied by the Federal 
Government are those on gasoline and 
other motor vehicle fuel, on tires and inner 
tubes, on heavy trucks and on new trucks, 
buses and trailers at the time of manufac-
ture. 
The Federal Government provides a very 
substantial share a the funds used in the 
construct and purchase of right-of-way 
for highways in Missouri, with the State 
providing the remaining share. 
Under Federal law, the Federal Govern-
ment pays cio percent of the cost of building 
Interstate System highways, leaving the 
State with 10 percent of the cost to pay. 
Naturally, a State would be foolish to 
finance an Interstate System project entirely 
out of its own funds, since the Federal 
Government offers a ratio of 9 to 1 aid for 
this work. 
Most primary, secondary and urban sys-
tem highways are constructed on the basis of 
50 percent Federal and 50 percent State 
funds. Missouri must match dollar for dol-
lar all of the Federal aid available for build-
ing these three categories of highways. 
With whatever construction funds the 
State still has available, after matching all 
Federal funds, it finances projects on the 
primary, secondary, and urban systems with 
100 percent State money. The wisdom of 
using all available 100 percent State con-
struction funds in this manner is readily 
apparent, since the Federal Government 
offers so much more aid in the building a 
Interstate routes than it does for the other 
three systems of highways. 
That gives a fairly complete summary, I 
believe, on where the money comes from 
to finance the acquisition of right-of-way 
and the construction of State highways. 
Now let's look at how the Federal aid funds 
actually are made available for use to the 
States. 
One thing which is important for the pub-
lic to understand is this: The Federal Gov-
ernment does not pay any Federal-aid road 
funds to the State before the State buys 
right-of-way for a project or constructs a 
highway. The State pays for the work out 
of its own pocket, and later is reimbursed a 
share of the costs by the Federal Govern-
ment on Federal-aid highway projects. But 
you will see how the system works as we pro-
ceed in this explanation. 
There are three key words at the Fed-
eral level in the process of providing Federal-
aid road funds to the States. Those words 
are "appropriation," "apportionment," and 
"release." 
Federal funds for highway work are ap-
propriated by Congress. Right now those 
funds are totaling about $3.8 billion a year. 
This money goes into the Highway Trust 
Fund in Washington, D.C., the fund through 
which all Federal aid road money is adminis-
tered. Under Federal law, the Highway 
Trust Fund must at all times be solvent?no 
deficit financing is permitted. 
The next step in the process is apportion-
ment of each fiscal year's Federal highway 
funds to the 50 States. This is done on a 
formula basis and is handled by the Sec-
retary a Commerce and the Bureau of Pub-
lic Roads. Apportionment merely is the an-
nouncement of each State's share a Federal 
road funds for a particular fiscal year be-
tween July 1 and June 30. 
Neither the appropriation of funds nor the 
apportionment of funds allow the States to 
award a single dollar of a Federal-aid high-
way construction contract or buy one piece 
of right-of-way. 
The award of a contract or purchase of 
right-of-way for a Federal-aid job can come 
only after the release for obligation of the 
previously appropriated and apportioned 
Federal money. This release of the funds 
to States also is done by the Secretary of 
Commerce and the Bureau of Public Roads. 
It is the step in which the States are, in 
effect, told: "Yon may proceed to obligate 
Federal-aid funds for highway projects be-
cause we now can guarantee that there will 
be enough money in the Highway Trust Fund 
to reimburse you the Federal share of the 
cost when you present a bill for payment 
at a later date for completed work." 
Release of a year's apportionment of funds 
is done on a quarterly basis during the fiscal 
year. If a normal procedure was being fol-
lowed, this would mean the release of one-
fourth of a year's money to the States on 
each of these dates: July 1, October 1, Janu-
ary 1, and April 1. 
Release of the Federal money for obliga-
tion is done on a quarterly basis to insure 
the future solvency of the Highway Trust 
Fund. In other words, if a full year's appor-
tiornnent was released all at once, the States 
would obligate so heavily against it in just 
a few months that the trust fund would be 
unable to meet all payments when bills for 
reimbursement on completed work were pre-
sented later. Such a situation would be in 
violation of the Federal law requiring the 
trust fund to be solvent at all times. 
That sets the stage so far as background 
Is concerned. Now let me explain what has 
been happening at the Federal level which 
is causing a curtailment in State highway 
construction in Missouri. 
In a nutshell, it can be summed up as a 
delay in the release of quarterly Federal 
funds to the States for obligation?a delay 
which has lengthened in the last few months 
until we now are behind a full quarter, or 
3 months. Each quarter for Missouri, under 
the present apportionment, represents about 
$24,425,000. 
A year ago today?or on July 1, 1964?
Missouri and the other States should have 
received release of the first quarter funds, 
if things were going according to schedure. 
However, the release did not come until last 
August 20. Second quarter funds, due for 
release October 1, were not made available 
for obligation until November 16. 
Although both these releases of money 
were some 6 weeks late, no real serious dam-
age resulted since the delay in getting proj-
ect 
grt 
seaunder contract was not particularly 
But the situation certainly has had an - 
effect during the first 6 months of the pres-
ent calendar year. 
The third quarter release of Federal funds., 
scheduled for January 1, did not come until 
March 15, or 2% months late. And fourth 
quarter funds, due April 1, were not released 
until, yesterday (June 30), a full 3 months 
behind schedule. 
The delay in releasing the funds has been 
due to a shortage of money in the highway 
trust fund. Because of this shortage, the 
Secretary of Commerce has had to stretch 
out the release times. 
You will recall that I earlier said the State 
highway department expected to have a con-
struction and ritht-of-way program of about 
$165,500,000 during calendar 1965.

Costs allocated to new purposes 
? The Executive recommended to the Con-
gress allocation of costs to two relatively 
novel purposes: water quality and highway 
improvement. 
The legislative basis for the first such 
recommendation to the Congress is found in 
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
Amendments of 1961, and the iasis for the 
second recommendation is to be found in the 
Flood Control Act of 1962. 
The committee concurred with these two 
recommendations.

VIETNAM?THE 
STATEMENT TO THE 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, the 
President's statement to the press and 
the country of yesterday and his calm 
and candid answers to questions were 
very helpful in making clear our purposes 
in Vietnam. He is seeking an honorable 
and prompt end to that conflict, not the 
beginning of a new war. Whatever ad-
ditional military measures be has had 
to take are Gast in that vein. He has 
opened the door wide to diplomats, to 
the United Nations, all nations, to join 
in a quest for a prompt peace under 
honorable conditions on all sides. 
As one who participated in the three 
discussions jie had with Members of the 
Congress?discussions which covered ap-
proximately 6 hours within a 24-hour 
period?I can state that they were con-
ducted on a give-and-take basis, that all 
sides were heard and all sides considered. 
The decision which the President arrived 
at was not an easy one, but was one of 
five options which he gave consideration 
to and on which he did not make up his 
mind until almost the last moment. I 
know of no President who has discussed 
a situation of this nature with so many 
people to get their yiewpoints or held so 
many meetings with his chief advisers in 
the executive branch of the Govern-
ment, as well as with the legislative 
branch. He is deeply and personally im-
mersed in what is going on and no one 
worries more about the possibilities and 
No, 133 16 
the potentials involved. He has had 
frank and candid advice which he has 
sought but he has arrived at his own 
decisions because they are, under the 
Constitution, his responsibility. 
Mr. President, to indicate the lengths 
to which the President has stated publicly 
he will go, I ask unanimous consent that 
various excerpts from his press confer-
ence of yesterday be included at this 
point in the RECORD and that following 
them, the transcript of the President's 
news conference be incorporated in the 
RECORD en toto. Before this request is 
acted on, I would urge my colleagues and 
the public in general to note the nine ex-
cerpts which are taken out of the speech 
so that we will all have a better under-
standing of just how far the President 
is prepared to go in bringing the Viet-
namese situation to an honorable con-
clusion through negotiations based on 
the Geneva accords, the proposals of the 
Government of North, Vietnam, the use 
of the United Nations, representation by 
the Vietcong, and any other avenues 
which are open or can be opened. In 
my opinion, these are worthy of note and 
worthy of consideration by all who can 
read, who can see, and who can hear. 
There being no objection, the excerpts 
and transcript were ordered to be printed 
in the RECORD, as follows: 
Second, once the Communists know, as we 
know, that a violent solution is impossible, 
then a peaceful solution is inevitable. We 
are ready now, as we have always been, to 
move from the battlefield to the conference 
table. 
I have stated publicly and many times, 
again and again, America's willingess to be-
gin unconditional discussions with any gov-
ernment at any place at any time. 
Fifteen efforts have been made to start 
these discussions, with the help of 40 na-
tions throughout the world. But there has 
been no answer. But we are going to con-
tinue to persist, if persist we must, _until 
death and desolation have led to the same 
conference table where others could now join 
us at a much smaller cost. 
I have spoken many times of our objectives 
In Vietnam. So has the Government of South 
Vietnam. Hanoi has set forth its own pro-
posals. We are ready to discuss their pro-
posals and our proposals and any proposals of 
any government whose people may be affect-
ed, for we fear the meeting room no more 
than we fear the battlefield. And in this 
pursuit we welcome and we ask for the con-
cern and the assistance of any nation and 
all nations. 
And if the United Nations and its officials 
or any one of its 114 members can by deed 
or word, private initiative or public action, 
bring us nearer an honorable peace, then 
they will have the support and gratitude of 
the United States of America. 
I've directed Ambassador Goldberg to go to 
New York today and to present immediately 
to Secretary General U Thant a letter from 
me requesting that all the resources and the 
energy and the immense prestige of the 
United Nations be employed to find ways to 
halt aggression and to bring peace in Viet-
nam. 
But we insist and we Will always insist that 
the people of South Vietnam shall have the 
right of choice, the right to shape their own 
destiny in free elections in the South or 
throughout all Vietnam under international 
supervision, and they shall not have any 
government imposed upon them by force and 
terror so long as we can prevent it. 
As I just said, I hope that every member 
of the United Nations that has any idea or 
any plan, any program, any suggestion, that 
they will not let them go unexplored. 
And as I have said so many times, if any-
one questions our good faith and will ask 
us to meet them to try to reason this mat-
ter out, they will find us at the appointed 
place, the appointed time and the proper 
chair. 
I have made very clear in my San Fran-
cisco speech my hope that the Secretary 
General under his wise leadership would ex-
plore every possibility that might lead to a 
solution of this matter. In my letter to the 
Secretary General this morning which Am-
bassador Goldberg will deliver later in the 
day, I reiterate my hopes and my desires and 
I urge upon him that he?if he agrees?that 
he undertake new efforts in this direction. 
Ambassador Goldberg understands the 
challenge. We spent the weekend talking 
about the potentialities and the possibilities, 
our hopes and our dreams, and I believe that 
we will have an able advocate and a search-
ing negotiator who, I would hope, could some 
day find success. 
We have stated time and time again that 
we would negotiate with any government, 
any time, any place. The Vietcong would 
have no difficulty in being represented and 
having their views presented if Hanoi for a 
moment decides that she wants to cease ag-
gression, and I would not think that would 
be an insurmountable problem at all. I 
think that could be worked out.

TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRESIDENT'S NEWS CON-
FERENCE ON FORE/GN AND DOMESTIC AF'FAIRS 
OPENING STATEMENT 
South, Vietnam 
President JOHNSON. My fellow Americans. 
Not long ago, I received a letter from a wo-
man in the Midwest. She wrote: 
"DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: In my humble way I 
am writing to you about the crisis in Viet-
nam. I have a son who is now in Vietnam. 
My husband served in World War It Our 
country was a war. But now, this time, It's 
just something that I don't understand. 
Why?" 
Well, I've tried to answer that question 
dozens of times and more in practically 
every State in this Union. I have discussed 
It fully in Baltimore in April, in Washington 
in May, in San Francisco in June. And let 
me again now discuss it here In the East 
Room of the White House. 
Why must young Americans, born into a 
land exultant with hope and with golden 
promise, toil and suffer and sometimes die 
in such a remote and distant place? 
The answer, like the war itself, is not 
an easy one. But it echoes clearly from 
the painful lessons of half a century. 
Three times in my lifetime--in two.World 
Wars and in Korea?Americans have gone 
to far lands to fight for freedom. We have 
learned at a terrible and a brutal cost that 
retreat does not bring safety, and weakness 
does not bring peace. 
And It is this lesson that has brought us 
to Vietnam. 
This is a different kind of war. There are 
no marching armies or solemn declarations. 
Some citizens of South Vietnam, at times 
with understandable grievances, have joined 
in the attack on their own Government. 
But we must not let this mask the central 
fact that this is really war. It is guided by 
North Vietnam and it is spurred by Com-
munist China. Its goal is to conquer the 
South, to defeat American power and to ex-
tend the Asiatic dominion of communism. 
And there are great stakes in the balance.

18112 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE July 29, 1965 
A Vital Shield 
Most of the non-Communist nations of 
Asia. cannot, by themselves and alone, resist 
the growing might and the grasping ambi-
tion of Asian communism. 
Our power therefore is a very vital shield. 
If we are driven from the :field in Vietnam, 
then no nation can ever again have the same 
confidence in American promise or in Arneri-
can protection. 
In each land, the forces of independence 
would be considerably weakened, and an Asia 
so threatened by Communist domination 
would certainly imperil the security of the 
United States itself. 
We did not choose to be the guardians at 
the gate, but there is no one else. Nor would 
surrender in Vietnam bring peace, because 
we learned from Hitler at Munich that suc-
cess only feeds the appetite of aggression. 
The battle would be renewed in one country, 
and then another country, bringing with it 
perhaps even larger and crueler conflict, as 
we have learned from the lessons of history. 
Moreover, we are in Vietnam to fulfill one 
of the most solemn pledges of the American 
Nation. Three Presidents?President Eisen-
hower, President Kennedy and your present 
President?over 11 years have committed 
themselves and have promised to help defend 
this small and valiant nation. 
Strengthened by that promise, the people 
of South Vietnam have- fought for many long 
years. Thousands of- them have died. Thou-
sands more have been crippled and scarred 
by war. And we just cannot now dishonor 
our word, or abandon our commitment, or 
leave those who believed us and who trusted 
us to the terror and repression and murder 
that would follow. 
This, then, my fellow Americans, is why 
we are in Vietnam. 
What are our goals in that war-stained 
land? 
First, we intend to convince the Commu-
nist that we cannot be defeated by force of 
arms or by superior power. They are not 
easily convinced. In recent months they 
have greatly increased their fighting forces 
and their attacks and the numbers of inci-
dents. 
I have asked the commanding general, Gen-
eral Westmoreland, what more he needs to 
meet this mounting aggression. He has told 
me. And we will meet his needs. 
Increase in Strength 
I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air 
Mobile Division and certain other forces 
which will raise our fighting strength from 
75,000 to 125,000 men almost immediately. 
Additional forces will be needed later and 
they will be sent as requested. 
This will make is necessary to increase our 
active fighting forces by raising the monthly 
draft _call from 17,000 over a period of time 
to 35,000_ per month and for us to step up 
our campaign for voluntary enlistments. 
After this past week of deliberations, I 
have concluded that it is not essential to 
order Reserve units into service now. If that 
necessity should later be indicated, I will 
give the matter most careful consideration 
and I will give the country due and adequate 
notice before taking such action, but only 
after full preparations. 
We have also discussed with the Govern-
ment of South Vietnam lately the steps that 
will?we will take to Substantially increase 
their own effort both on the battlefield and 
toward reform and progress in the villages. 
Ambassador Lodge is now formulating a new 
program to be tested upon his return to that 
area. 
I have directed Secretary Rusk and Sec-
retors? McNamara to be available immediately 
to the Congress to review with these com-
mittees?the appropriate congressional com-
mittees?what we plan to do in these areas. 
I have asked them to be able to answer the 
questions of any Member of Congress. 
And Secretary McNamara, in addition, will 
ask the Senate Appropriations Committee 
to add a limited amount to present legisla-
tion to help meet part of this new cost until 
a supplemental measure is ready and hear-
ings can be held when the Congress as-
sembles in January. In the meantime, we 
will use the authority contained in the 
present defense appropriation bill under con-
sideration to transfer funds in addition to 
the additional mbney that we will ask. 
These steps, like our actions in the past, 
are carefully measured to do what must be 
done to bring an end to aggression and a 
peaceful settlement. 
We do not want an expanding struggle 
with consequences that no one can fore-
see, nor will we bluster or bully or flaunt 
our power. But we will not surrender, and 
we will not retreat. 
For behind our American pledge lies the 
determination and resources, I believe, of all 
of the American Nation. 
Ready To Negotiate 
Second, once the Communists know, as we 
know, that a violent solution is impossible, 
then a peaceful solution is inevitable. We 
are ready now, as we have always been, to 
move from the battlefield to the conference 
table. 
I have stated publicly and many times, 
again and again, America's willingness to be-
gin unconditional discussions with any Gov-
ernment at any place at any time. 
Fifteen efforts have been made to start 
these discussions, with the help of 40 na-
tions throughout the world. But there has 
been no answer. But we are going to con-
tinue to persist, if persist we must, until 
death and desolation have led to the same 
conference table where others could now join 
us at a much smaller cost. 
I have spoken many times of our objectives 
in Vietnam. So has the Government of South 
Vietnam. Hanoi has set forth its own pro-
posals. We are ready to discuss their pro-
posals and our proposals and any pro-
posals a any Government whose peo-
ple may be affected, for we fear the 
raeetingroom no more than we fear the 
battlefield. And in this pursuit We welcome 
and we ask for the concern and the assistance 
of any nation and all nations. 
And if the United Nations and its officials 
or any one of its 114 members Can by deed or 
word, private initiative or public action, 
bring us nearer an honorable peace, then 
they will have the support and gratitude of 
the United States of America. 
Letter to U Thant 
I've directed Ambassador Goldberg to go 
to New York today and to present imme-
diately to Secretary General U Tha,nt a letter 
from me requesting that all the resources 
and the energy and the immense prestige of 
the United Nations be employed to find ways 
to halt aggression and to bring peace in 
Vietnam. 
I made a similar request at San Francisco 
a few weeks ago because we do not seek the 
destruction of any government nor do we 
covet a foot of any territory. But we insist 
and we will always insist that the people of 
South Vietnam shall have the right of choice 
the right to shape their own destiny in free 
elections in the South or throughout all Viet-
nam under international supervision, and 
they shall not have any government, im-
posed upon them by force and terror so long 
as we can prevent it. 
This was the purpose of the 1954 agree-
ments which the Communists have now 
cruelly shattered. And if the machinery of 
those agreements was tragically weak, its 
purposes still guide our action. And as battle 
rages we will continue as best we can to help 
the good people of South Vietnam enrich the 
condition of their life, to feed the hungry, 
and to tend the sick, and teach the young, 
and shelter the homeless, and help the farmer 
to increase his crops, and the worker to find 
a job. 
It is an ancient but still terrible irony that 
While many leaders of men create division 
in pursuit of grand ambitions, the children 
of men are really united in the simple, elu-
sive desire for a life of fruitful and rewarding 
toil. 
As I said in Johns Hopkins at Baltimore. I 
hope that one day we can help all the 
people of Asia toward that desire?and Eu-
gene Black has made great progress since my 
appearance at Baltimore in that direction--
not as the price of peace, for we are ready 
always to bear a more painful cost, but 
rather as a part of our obligations of justice 
toward our fellow man. 
Painful Duty 
And let me also add now a personal note. 
I do not find it easy to send the flower of 
our youth, our finest young men, into battle. 
I have spoken to you today of the divisions 
and the forces and the battalions and the 
units, but I know them all, every one. I 
have seen them in a thousand streets a a 
hundred towns in every State in this Union?
working and laughing and building and filled 
with hope and life. And I think I know, too, 
how their mothers weep and how their fami-
lies sorrow. 
And this is the most agonizing and the 
most painful duty of your President. 
-And there is something else, too. When 
I was young, poverty was so common that 
we didn't know it had a name. An educa-
tion was something that you had to fight 
for, and water was really life itself. I have 
now been in public life for 35 years, more 
than three decades, and in each of those 35 
years I have seen good men and wise lead-
ers struggle to bring the blessings of this 
land to all of our people. 
And now I am the President. It is now 
my opportunity to help every child get an 
education, to help every Negro and every 
American citizen have an equal opportunity, 
to help every family get a decent home, and 
to help bring healing to the sick and dignity 
to the old. 
As I have said before, that is what I've 
lived for, that's what I've wanted all my life 
since I was a little boy, and I do not want to 
see all those hopes and all those dreams of 
so many people for so many years now 
drowned in the wasteful ravages of cruel 
wars. And I'm going to do all I can do to 
see that that never happens. 
But I also know, as a realistic public serv-
ant, that as long as there are men who hate 
and destroy we must have the courage to 
resist or we'll see it all?all that we have 
built, all that we hope to build, all of our 
dreams for freedom, all, all?will be swepl, 
away on the flood of conquest. 
So, too, this shall not happen. We will 
stand in Vietnam. 
Voice of America chief 
Now what America is and was and hopes 
to stand for, as an important national asset, 
telling the truth to this world, telling an 
exciting story, is the Voice of America. 
classify this assignment in the front rank 
of importance to the freedom of the world, 
and that is why today I am proud to an-
nounce to you the name of the man who 
will direct the Voice of America. 
He is a man whose voice and whose face 
and whose mind is known to this country and 
to most of the entire world. His name is 
John Chancellor. 
Mr. Chancellor was born 38 years ago in 
Chicago. For more than 15 years he has 
been with the news department of the Na-
tional Broadcasting Co. During that time 
he has covered the world, in Vienna, Lon-
don, Moscow, New York, Brussels, Berlin, and 
Washington. 
Since 1964 he has been with you, one of 
the White House correspondents. 
This, I think, is the first time in history 
of the Voice of America that a working

newspaperman, a respected commentator, 
and experienced independent reporter has 
been given the responsibility of leadership 
and direction in this vital enterprise. I 
think he understands the challenges that 
are present? and the achievements that are 
passible. And I am satisfied that the Voice 
of America will be in imaginative, compe-
tent, reliable, and always truthful hands. 
Stand up, John, will you, please? 
Fortes to Supreme Court 
The President has few responsibilities of 
greater importance or greater consequence 
to the country's future than the constitu-
tional responsibility of nominating Justices 
for the Supreme Court of the United States. 
I am happy today here in the East Room 
to announce that the distinguished Ameri-
can who was my first Choice for the position 
now vacant on the Supreme Court has agreed 
to accept this call to this vital duty. I will 
very shortly, this afternoon, send to the U.S. 
Senate my nomination of the Honorable 
Abe Fortes to be an Associate Justice of the 
Supreme Court. 
For many, many years I have regarded Mr. 
Fortes as one of this Nation's most able and 
most respected and most outstanding citi-
zens, a scholar, a profound thinker, a lawyer 
of superior ability, and a man of humane and 
deeply compassionate feelings toward his fel-
low man, a champion of our liberties. That 
opinion is shared by the legal profession and 
by the bar of this country, by Members of 
Congress, and by the leaders of business and 
labor and other secters of our national life. 
Mr. Fortes has, as you know, told me on 
numerous occasions in the last 20 months 
that he would not be an applicant or a can-
didate or would not accept any appointment 
to any public office. And this is, I guess, as 
it should be, for in this instance the job 
has sought the man. Mr. Fortes agrees that 
the duty and the opportunity of service on 
the highest court of this great country is 
not a call that any citizen can reject. 
So I am proud for the country that he has 
this morning accepted this appointment and 
will serve his country as an Associate Justice 
of the Supreme Court. 
I will be glad to take your questions now 
for a period. I'll have a little water here. 
QUESTIONS 
1. If Hanoi escalates 
Question. Mr. President, in the light of 
the decisions on Vietnam which you've just 
announced, is the United States prepared 
with additional plans should North Vietnam 
escalate its military effort? And how do you 
anticipate that the Chinese Communists will 
react to what you've announced today? 
Answer. I do not want to speculate on the 
reactions of other people. This Nation is 
prepared and will always be prepared to 
protect its national interests. 
, 2. Duration of War 
Question. Mr. President, you haven't 
talked about a timetable in connection with 
Vietnam. You have said and you repeated 
today that the United States will not be de-
feated, will not grow tired. 
Donald Johnson, national commander of 
the American Legion, went over to Vietnam 
In the spring and later called on you. He 
told White House reporters that he could 
imagine the war over there gonig on for 5, 
6, or 7 years. Have you thought of that pos-
sibility, sir? And do you think the American 
people ought to think of that possibility? 
Answer. Yes. I think the American people 
ought to understand that there is no quick 
solution to the problem that we face there. 
I would not want to prophesy or predict 
whether it would be a matter of months or 
years or decades. I do not know that we 
had any accurate timetable on how long it 
would take to bring victory in World War I. 
I don't think anyone really knew that it 
would be 2 years or 4 years or 6 years to meet 
with success in World War II. I do think 
our cause is just. I do think our purposes 
and objectives are beyond question. 
I do believe that America will stand united 
behind her men that are there. And I plan 
as long as I'm President to see that our forces 
are strong enough to protect our national 
interests and our right hand constantly pro-
tecting that interest with our military and 
that our diplomatic and political negotia-
tions are constantly attempting to find some 
Solution that would substitute words for 
bombs. 
And as I have said so many times, if any-
one questions our good faith and will ask 
us to meet them to try to reason this matter 
out, they will find us at the appointed place, 
the appointed time, and the proper chair. 
3. Ghanaian's mission 
Question. With the representative of the 
Government of Ghana in Hanoi now talking 
with the foreign minister of North Vietnam 
about the war in Vietnam, do you see any 
indication that something good will come 
of these talks? 
Answer. We are always hopeful that every 
effort in that direction will meet with suc-
cess. We welcome those efforts, as we wel-
comed the Commonwealth proposal, as we 
welcomed Mr. Davies's visit [Harold Davies 
of Britain's Labor Government] as we wel-
comed the Indian suggestion, as we weclomed 
the efforts of the distinguished Prime Minster 
of Great Britain, and others from time to 
time. 
As I just said, I hope that every member 
of the United Nations that has any idea 
or any plan, any program, any suggestion, 
that they will not let them go unexplored. 
4. Guns and butter 
Question. Mr. President, from what you 
have outlined as your program for now, it 
would seem that you feel that we can have 
guns and butter for the foreseeable future. 
Do you have any idea right now, though, that 
down the road a piece the American people 
may have to face the problem of guns or 
butter? 
Answer. I have not the slightest doubt but 
whatever it's necessary to face, the American 
people will face. I think that all of us know 
that we are now in the 52d month of the 
prosperity that's been unequaled in this Na-
tion, and I see no reason for declaring a na-
tional emergency, and I rejected that course 
of action earlier today when I made my de-
cision. 
I cannot foresee what next year or the fol-
lowing year or the following year would hold. 
I only know that the Americans will do what-
ever is necessary. And at the moment we 
enjoy the good fortune of having an unparal-
leled period of prosperity with us, and this 
Government's going to do all it can to see it 
continue. 
5. Missile site in north 
Question. Mr. President, can you tell us 
whether the missile sites in North Vietnam 
that were bombed yesterday were manned 
by Russians, and whether or not the admin-
istration has a policy about Russian techni-
cians in North Vietnam? 
Answer. No, we have no information as 
to how they were manned. We cannot speak 
with any authority on that matter. We 
made the decision that we felt our national 
interest required, and as those problems pre-
sent themselves we will face up to them. 
6. Chiang Kai-shek's role 
Question. Mr. President, sir, I, wonder if 
you've had any communications from Chiang 
Kai-shek that he's ready to go to war with 
you. 
Answer. We have communicated with 
most of the friendly nations of the world 
in the last few days, and we have received 
from them responses that have been en-
couraging. I would not want to go into 
any individual response here, but I would 
say that I have indicated to all of the 
friendly nations what our problems were 
there, the decision that confronted us, and 
asked for their help and for their suggestions. 
Mr. Roberts. 
7. Soviet confrontation 
Question. Mr. President, given the Russian 
military involvement, or apparent involve-
ment, on the side of Hanoi on the one side, 
and the dialog which Mr. Harriman has 
been conducting for you on the other, as 
well as the disarmament talks in Geneva at 
the moment, could you tell us whether you 
believe this war, as you now call it, can be 
contained in this corner of southeast Asia 
without involving a United States-Soviet 
confrontation? 
Answer. We would hope very much that 
we could, and we will do nothing to provoke 
that confrontation that we can avoid. Ae 
you know, immediately after I assumed the 
Presidency, I inunediately sent messages to 
the Soviet Union. We have had frequent 
exchange of views by letter and by conversa-
tion with Mr. Gromyko and Mr. Dobrynin, 
and we are doing nothing to provoke the 
Soviet Union. 
We are very happy that they agreed to 
resume the disarmament conference. I went 
to some length to try to extend ourselves to 
make the proposals that I would hope would 
meet with acceptance of the peoples of the 
world. We would like to believe that there 
could be some success flow from this con-
ference, although we haven't been too suc-
cessful. I know a nothing that we have in 
mind that should arouse the distrust or pro-
voke any violence on the part of the Soviet 
Union. 
8. Reliance on Saigon 
Question. Mr. President, does the fact that 
you're sending additional forces to Vietnam 
Imply any change in the existing policy of 
relying mainly on the South Vietnamese to 
carry out offensive operations and using 
American forces to guard American instal-
lations and to act as an emergency backup? 
Answer. It does not imply any change in 
policy whatever. It does not imply any 
change of objective. 
9. United Nations move 
Question. Mr. President, would you like to 
see the United Nations now move formally 
as an organization to attempt to achieve a 
settlement in Vietnam? 
Answer. I have made very clear in my San 
Francisco speech my hope that the Secre-
tary General under his wise leadership would 
explore every possibility that might lead to 
a solution of this matter. In my letter to 
the Secretary General this morning which 
Ambassador Goldberg will deliver later in the 
day, I reiterate my hopes and my desires and 
I urge upon him that he?if he agrees?that 
he undertake new efforts in this direction. 
Ambassador Goldberg understands the 
challenge. We spent the weekend talking 
about the potentialities and the possibilities, 
our hopes and our dreams, and I believe that 
we will have an able advocate and a search-
ing negotiator who, I would hope, could 
someday find success. 
Miss Craig. 
10. Presidential powers 
Question. Mr. President, what are the 
borders of your power to conduct a war? 
At what point might you have to ask Con-
gress for a declaration? 
Answer. I don't know. That would de-
pend on the circumstances. I can't pinpoint 
the date on the calendar or the hour or 
the day. I have to ask Congress for their 
judgments and for their decisions almost 
every hour of the day. One of the principal 
duties of the office of President is to main-
tain constant consultation. I have talked 
to, I guess, more than 50 Members of Con-
gress in the last 24 hours. I have submit-
ted myself to their questions and the Sec-
retary of State and Secretary of Defense 
will meet with them tomorrow and they're

ready to answer any question that they may 
need. 
Up to now, we have had ample authority, 
excellent cooperation, a `united Congress 
behind us and as near as I could tell from 
our meetings last night with the leaders 
and from my meetings today, with the 
distinguished chairmen of conamittees and 
the Members of both parties?we all met as 
Americans united and determined to stand 
as one. 
11. Hatfield's remarks 
Question. Mr. President, in this connec-
tion, however, last night one of the lead-
ing Governors of the Republicans said some 
rather strong things. Governor Hatfield, of 
Oregon, said the most recent escalation of ac-
tion In Vietnam is moving all the people 
of the earth closer to World War m and we 
have no moral right to commit the world 
and especially our own people to World War 
HI unilaterally or by the decision of a few 
experts. This seems to imply rather strong 
oriticism of present policies. Do you care 
to express any reaction? . 
Answer. Yes, I don't interpret it that 
way. / think there are dangers in escala-
tion. I don't think I have any right to 
commit the whole world to World War m. 
I'm doing everything I know how to avoid 
It. lint retreat is not necessarily the best 
way to avoid it. 
I've outlined to you What I think is the 
best policy. I would hope that Governor 
Hatfield and the other Governors, when they 
understand *what we are doing and when 
I have a chance to submit myself to their 
questioning and to counsel with them, would 
share my view. 
I know they have the same concern for 
the American people and the people of the 
world as I do. And I don't believe our ob-
jectives will be very different. 
As a matter of fact, I asked the Governors. 
if they could, to come here at the conclusion 
of their deliberations and I will ask them?
I will have my plane go to Minneapolis to-
morrow?and I believe 43 of the 48 have in-
dibated a desire to come here. 
I will give them all the information I 
can?confidential, secret, and otherwise?
because I have great respect for them and 
their judgment, their opinions, and their 
leadership. And it's going to be necessary 
in this effort. I will also have the Secre-
tary Of State and Secretary of Defense re-
view "With them all their plans and answer 
any of their inquiries and we hope resolve 
any doubts they might have. Miss Nancy. 
12. Personal feelings 
Question. Mr. President, after the week of 
deliberations on Vietnam, how do you feel?
in the context of your office? We always 
hear it's the loneliest iii the world. 
Answer. Nancy, I'm sorry, but the camera 
and the microphone?I didn't get your ques-
tion. Raise the microphone up where I can 
hear, and you camera boys give her a chance. 
Question. Mr. President, I say, after the 
week of deliberations on Vietnam, how do 
you feel personally? Particularly in the con-
text that we always hear, that your office is 
the loneliest in the world. 
Answer. Well, I don't agree with that. I 
don't guess there's anyone in this country 
that has as much understanding and as 
much help and as many experts and as good 
advice?many people of both parties trying 
to help him as they are me. Of course, I ad-
mit I need it more than anybody else. 
Question. Mr. President, would you be will-
ing to?
Answer. Nancy, I haven't been alone in the 
last few days. I've had lots of callers. 
13. Talks with Vietcong 
Question. Mr. President, would you be 
Willing to permit direct negotiations with the 
Vietcong forces in South Vietnam? 
Answer. We have stated time and time 
again that we would negotiate with any 
Government, any time, any place. The Viet-
cong Would have no difficulty in being rep-
resented and having their views presented if 
Hanoi for a moment decides that she wants 
to cease aggression, and I would not think 
that would be an insurmountable problem 
at all. I think that could be worked out. 
14. Gardner appointment 
Question. Mr. President, to shift the sub-
ject just a moment. Does your appointment 
of Mr. Gardner suggest that there will be 
less interest now in the creation of a sep-
arate Department of Education? 
Answer. No, not at all. My appointment 
of Mr. Gardner suggests that I looked over 
America to find the very best man that I 
could to lead us forward to become an edu-
cated Nation where every child obtains all the 
education that he can take, and where the 
health of every citizen is his prime concern, 
and where the social security system is 
brought into needs with the 20th century. 
And after canvassing some 40 or 50 possi-
bilities, I concluded that Mr. Gardner was 
the best man I could get, and I asked his 
board to relieve him of his duties and re-
lease him to the Government so that he 
could furnish the dynamic leadership offi-
cially that he has been furnishing unofficially 
to us. And he told me yesterday morning 
that he was prepared to dO that. And I 
remembered that I hadn't asked him what 
State he lived in, where his permanent resi-
dence was, so I could put it on the nomina-
tion paper, or what party he belonged to. 
And he rather?well, maybe somewhat hesi-
tatingly said, "I'm a Republican." 
I don't mean that his hesitating meant 
any particular significance. 
But I was happy that he said that, because 
a good many Republicans voted for me, and 
I don't want to be partial or partisan in 
this administration. And I like to see lead-
ership of that kind come from the Republi-
can ranks, and so I told him that if he had 
no objection I would announce very promptly 
his appointment, and I hoped that he would 
give us American leadership without regard 
to party, and that's what I think he will do, 
and I believe all the Nation will be proud 
of him, as we are of Secretary Celebrezze. 
Question. Thank you Mr. President. 
Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. 
Mr. KUCHEL. To the extent that I 
may be permitted to say so, as a member 
of the minority, I join the leader of the 
majority party in the Senate in the state-
ment which he has made. The pain-
ful and tragic decision made by President 
Eisenhower was one that was inevitable. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
HARRIS in the chair). The time of the 
Senator has expired. 
Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may have 2 
additional minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. KUCHEL. Speaking for the 
American people, the President had no 
other choice. As I said in the Senate 
a few weeks ago, the cause of freedom 
in the world is in danger. 
The people in the Government of the 
United States have a responsibility for 
the cause of freedom. Cringing in the 
face of danger, retreat before the Red 
menace facing South Vietnam will not 
bring peace with honor. 
There are two ways of life on this 
globe: First, the way of freedom as We 
know it; the other, as practiced by 
communism and, in this instance, fanat-
ical, implacable Asiatic communism. In 
time of danger the American people rally 
behind their President. This is such a 
time. 
The hour is late, but the door to peace-
ful discussion remains open, as the Chief 
Executive made very clear, once again. 
Mr. MA_NSFIFT,D. I appreciate the 
statement of the senior Senator from 
California, the assistant minority leader. 
Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield to my good 
friend, the distinguished senior Senator 
from Vermont. 
Mr. AIKEN. I should like to say, in 
support of the statement of the majority 
leader, that in spite of the fact that the 
President has called for 50,000 more 
troops in South Vietnam at this time, his 
statement of yesterday was the most en-
couraging and the farthest step toward 
peace, if the rest of the world wants 
Peace, that we have had up to date 
when he stated that we were willing to 
sit down at the table, even with Hanoi, to 
discuss means of settling the southeast 
Asia situation. 
That was a very long step toward 
going at least halfway, and probably a 
little more than halfway. As I see it, 
much now depends upon the United Na-
tions. The United Nations has an 
opportunity to demonstrate whether it 
is an effective agency to bring about 
peace and to maintain peace in the world. 
I am optimistic over the appointment 
of Arthur Goldberg as our Ambassador 
to the United Nations. But whether 
peace or war comes is largely a ques-
tion which is up to the Communist coun-
tries, particularly Russia, to answer. If 
Russia desires peace, President Johnson 
has indicated that we will meet them 
halfway. 
There are two countries?the United 
States of America and the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics?that can re-
store and maintain peace in the world 
if they so desire. I would warn, how-
ever, that we cannot expect peace to 
come overnight or reassurance of peace 
to come overnight. It is necessary to 
save face. There is the matter of na-
tional honor, or call it what one will. I 
do not know how national honor would 
be served by having several hundred 
million dead people in the world, or what 
it would be worth to us afterward; but 
we cannot expect the nations most seri-
ously involved to back away from their 
positions overnight. It will have to be 
an inching operation, possibly. If Russia 
is unwilling to attempt to settle this 
matter, she must bear the major part 
of the responsibility if a greater war 
should come. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I thank the Sena-
tor from Vermont. 
Mr. LAUSCHE. Mn President, will 
the Senator from Montana yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. 
Mr. LAUSCHE. I join in the remarks 
of the majority leader, the Senator from 
California [Mr. KucHEL1, and the Sena-
tor from Vermont [Mr. AIKEN). 
There has been considerable talk about 
the failure of the President attempting, 
at a peace table, to bring to an end the 
violence that now exists in South Viet-

nam. An examination of the record 
will disclose that President Johnson has 
repeatedly and strenuously attempted to 
bring about an understanding that would 
end the violence. It began in 1962 with 
the creation of the Laos accord. The 
U.S. Government yielded and agreed to 
create a three-headed government in 
Laos. That yielding was prompted by 
the desire to restore peace in southeast 
Asia. 
However, instead of the accord work-
ing as anticipated by the devotees in the 
free world, the Laotian border, on the 
eastern side, has been used as the means 
of transporting equipment and troops 
Into South Vietnam. 
? Since 1962, repeated evidences have 
appeared concerning the efforts of Presi-
dent Kennedy and President Johnson to 
bring about an understanding. I shall 
not mention them all, but I shall men-
tion a few. 
We used other states as a medium of 
contacting Hanoi and Russia -to bring 
about an understanding. We used U 
Thant, of the United Nations. Hanoi re-
fused even to listen to us and did not 
grant him an audience. 
We used the Cambridge speech made 
by the President a short time ago. The 
Commonwealth Nations of Great Britain 
assembled a delegation which was sent 
to Hanoi to attempt to reach an under-
standing. That delegation was not 
granted an audience. 
I concur completely in the statement 
of the Senator from Vermont. We have 
gone beyond the half way mark. We 
have yielded to the point where some 
People can justify saying that we have 
gone too far. 
I have the deepest compassion for the 
President with respect to the decision he 
had to make. It was not an easy one. 
The Nation was listening with avid ears 
to what he would say upon the subject. 
But there are times when cold ,reality 
demands courageous action, action that 
Is reflective of what needs to be done to 
preserve the Nation and to guard against 
future unlimited loss of life. 
I listened, to the President's talk yes-
terday. I could not help having the 
_deepest sympathy for him in the burden 
he had to carry. But a realistic study 
of the facts leads me to believe that there 
was no other course for him to follow. 
It was painful for him to say to the 
youth of the country, "I am calling upon 
an increased number of young men to 
join in the national defense"; but that 
was all he could do. 
. I commend the Senator from Montana 
for his statement. I join other Senators 
who have spoken in the utterance of a 
judgment that may seem heavy to the 
people of the country; but it is the only 
judgment that is available at this time. 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr, President, I 
join the majority leader and other Sen-
ators who have spoken on the President's 
statement of yesterday. 
I reiterate one point made by the 
majority leader: For the first time, the 
President said that we will negotiate, 
we. Will discUSS, we will deal with the 
North Vietnamese on their terms?I re-
peat on their terms?not ours, thanks. 
As the majority leader indicated, 
"their terms" means that the Vietcong 
may be brought in. We are not neces-
sarily agreeing that the Vietcong be 
given status; but we are willing to dis-
cuss the situation with them, as the 
President has said, at any time, any-
where, and unconditionally. 
However, at this point, one other ele-
ment of the President's speech should be 
stressed. Grim and difficult as it may 
be for many Senators to accept the situ-
ation, it seems to me that if peace with 
the Communists is to be achieved, it is 
necessary not only to speak soft words 
but also to carry a big stick. It is neces-
sary to make the kind of commitment in 
force that will prove that the President 
means it when he says that we will fight 
if we have to, however long it may take 
to fulfill whatever commitment the 
United States must make. Only this 
kind of concrete action will really con-
vince the Communists that the losses 
they will suffer?the economic devasta-
tion?if they persist in this aggression?
will not be worth while. Only this really 
makes negotiations and peace sensible 
to them. 
The big stick was there. 
The President has shown that he 
means business by saying that he will 
double our troop commitments and 
double the draft calls. s This is just as 
necessary an element in achieving peace, 
in my judgment, as the constructive and 
positive elements of the President's ex-
cellent speech. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I join 
with my colleagues in saying a word 
about the message of the President yes-
terday. 
I addressed myself briefly to this sub-
ject yesterday, and my remarks today 
are made upon reflection. Laying aside 
the tremendous value to be gained from 
congressional consideration of what is 
being done?which I believe would result 
In a real crystallization of sentiment be-
hind the President and behind the basic 
objectives of our country in South Viet-
nam which are now very clearly shown 
to be modest and restrained, and with-
out in any way repeating what has al-
ready been magnificently said?I wish 
very much to associate myself with the 
point made by the Senator from Ver-
mont [Mr. AIKEN] that if the Russians 
willed it, they and the United States 
could see that peace was brought to Viet-
nam through the assistance of NATO 
countries and other organizations of 
which we are a member. 
I agree thoroughly with the point 
raised by the Senator from Wisconsin 
[Mr. PROXMIRE] that the statement of 
the President is a great step forward. It 
demonstrates our willingness to negotiate 
even upon the proposals put forth by 
Hanoi and, as the Secretary of State had 
already made clear, to proceed to nego-
tiate even if the Vietcong are represented 
in the North Vietnamese delegation. 
I should like to add to all of those 
points, with which I thoroughly agree, 
and to the backing of the President es-
sentially, with which I also thoroughly 
agree, that we must constantly appraise 
the military feasibility of our presence 
In South Vietnam. I do not wish to see 
the United States get itself involved in 
another Dien Bien Phu. 
It is for that reason that I believe 
the President of the United States acted 
very wisely when he used such restraint 
in limiting the amount of force to be used 
In the struggle to the amount of force 
required, instead of endeavoring to em-
ploy overwhelming force. 
I am sure that the President had two 
contrary courses open to him: to take 
the restrained and modest action which 
he did take or, on the other hand, to use 
a vastly increased force of equipment 
and men in an effort to overwhelm the 
Vietcong with the determination of the 
United States to win this struggle, to 
declare a state of national emergency 
and to call up the reservists. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
time of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may be per-
mitted to continue for an additional five 
minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection, the Senator from New 
York is recognized for an additional 5 
minutes. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, the Pre-
sident made one determination very 
clear; at the same time, he demonstrated 
our willingness to negotiate and but-
tressed his statement of willingness by 
stressing the use of the United Nations 
and our readiness to negotiate even upon 
the proposals of Hanoi. 
I believe that the President has stated 
a most wise course in this respect. How-
ever, I still hope that we may have the 
opportunity for a definitive debate which 
would marshal the country behind a 
moderate and reasonable American pol-
icy. 
I hope very much that the President 
will take comfort in the fact that this 
moderate and reasonable policy is the 
right approach, as evidenced by the fine 
reception which his statement to the 
country has received, and by the support 
of myself and many others who have 
from time to time asked questions and 
expressed serious doubts concerning the 
Policies being pursued.

(Concurrent resolution of the Legislature of

which are being made to promote an 
amendment to the constitution which 
would permit one house of a bicameral 
legislature to be apportioned on a basis 
other than equal treatment of citizens or

Whereas efforts are being made in the leg-
islatures of the several States and in the 
Congress of the United States to promote an 
amendment to the Constitution strhich would 
permit one house of a bicameral legislature 
to be apportioned on a basis other than equal 
treatment of citizens or residents; and 
Whereas such an amendment would par-
tially nullify the historic and salutory deci-
sion of the U.S. Supreme Court that people 
must be given equal privileges of representa-
tion regardless of their place of residence, by 
permitting an unrepresentative house to veto 
the actions of a more representative house; 
and 
Whereas the unequal representation of 
States in the U.S. Senate is not pertinent in 
this connection because the States were 
sovereign and indecendent entities whose 
equal representation was naturally demanded 
and necessary in order to create a Federal 
union and there is no such sovereign status 
In the dis"a',.cts of a State legislature; and 
Whereas there are at least as many special 
Interests requiring representation in propor-
tion to population in the thickly settled 
areas of the States as in the sparsely settled 
areas; and 
Whereas the principle of majority rule re-
quires that districts with a minority of the 
people of a State should not be able to out-
vote in a legislative body districts with a 
substantially greater number of people, as 
has often happened in this and other States 
and will happen again if the proposed 
amendment should prevail: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the legislature of the State 
of New York strongly opposes the proposed 
amendment and supports the decision of 
the U.S. Supreme Court requiring equal 
treatment of a State's people in its represent-
ative bodies as a fundamental bulwark of 
democratic self-government; and be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
sent to the Governors and the majority and 
minority leaders of the legislative bodies of 
all the States and to all Members of the 
Congress of the United States. 
By order of the senate,

Secretary. 
RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY WEST-
ERN GOVERNOR'S CONFERENCE 
RELATIVE TO WESTERN STATES 
WA IT...it COUNCIL 
Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, a number 
of resolutions passed at the Western 
States Governors Conference held re-
cently in Portland, Oreg., contained rec-
ornMendations for action by the Con-
gresS. Among the important eubiects 
which were discussed and upon which 
the assembled Governors offered counsel 
were oil shale leasing, public lands ad-
ministration, minerals taxation, import 
contrOls to protect domestic resources 
Industries, and others. I assure otir 
Western Governors that we in the Con-
gress will heed the words they have 
written. 
To my mind, however, far the most 
significant resolution passed was their 
first one, which was unanimously 
adopted, and which established and fi-
nanced a Western States Water Council, 
with a permanent staff and central office, 
to effect cooperation among the Western 
States in integrating water resource de-
velopment. 
The resolution recognizes that the 
water problems of one State or one area 
of the West are the water problems of 
all Western States and areas, and that 
full integration may require the removal 
of water from areas of water surpluses to 
areas of water deficiencies. The reso-
lution, of course, recognizes the rights of 
upstream users of water which originate 
in their area, or which flow through it, 
and these rights must be safeguarded. 
But the approach is realistic and practi-
cal in the resolution. It serves no pur-
pose to have water wasting away in one 
part of the West while communities and 
farms are withering up in another part 
for want of that water. The West can 
prosper most, and best, if it prospers 
together. 
I ask unanimous consent that this his-
tory-making resolution establishing the 
Western States Water Council be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the resolu-
tion was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
WESTERN GOVERNORS' CONFERENCE, PORTLAND. 
OREG., Jerre 10-13, 1965 
WESTERN STATES WATER cianascra 
Whereas the future growth and prosperity 
of the Western States depend upon the avail-
ability of adequate quantities of water of 
suitable quality; and 
Whereas the need for accurate and un-
biased appraisal of present and future re-
quirements of each area of the West and for 
the most equitable means of providing for 
the meeting of such requirements demands 
a regional effort: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the western Governors' con-
ference, That it approves the creation of a 
Western States Water Council to be estab-
lished in general conformity with the or-
ganizational pattern of the attached sug-
gested rules of organization developed by 
the Western Water Resources Task Force ap-
pointed by the members of this conference; 
and be in further 
Resolved. That the members of this con-
ference will take all feasible steps to pro-
vide the support to give effective meaning 
to the creation of such a council, including 
the establishment, upon recommendation of 
the council of a staff and central office to be 
financed in an amount not to exceed the sum 
of $150,000 for the first year from appropri-
ations by each of the member States equally.

SHOWING OF FILM "AFRICA TO-
DAY" ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 
5, 1965 
Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, it will 
be recalled that I made an extensive 
trip of Africa during 1962. I took about 
7,500 feet of film on that trip. 
From that film I produced a full reel 
entitled "Africa Today." I have shown 
this film on several occasions in the Sen-
ate auditorium. I have been asked by 
quite a few Senators and others to have 
another showing. 
So I have decided to show "Africa To-
day" in the auditorium of the New Senate 
Office Building on Thursday, August 5, 
at 2:30 pan. for one showing, and at 
7 p.m. for another showing. I am hope-
ful that Senators who wish to see the

*THE PRE 
'S SPEECH ON 
ylETNAM 
Mr. CLARK. Mr, President, yester-
day I listened with keen interest to the 
remarks of the President of the United 
States at his press conference with re-
spect to the unhappy situation in Viet-
nam. I have not made any comment on 
the President's address. I do not intend 
to do so for the time being, other than to 
ask unanimous consent that an editorial 
? entitled "This Is Really War," which ap-
peared in today's New York Times, be 
printed in the RECORD at this point as a 
Part of my remarks, and to indicate my 
general approval of the point of view ex-
pressed in the editorial. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THIS IS REALLY WAR 
The President's measured speech to the 
Nation yesterday could leave no doubt about 
the seriou.sness of the situation irf which this 
country finds itself today in respect to the 
war in Vietnam. 
The United States is now fighting a land 
war in Asia?a limited one so far but never-
theless a war on the Asiatic Continent. It 
is a war to which more men, materiel, and 
money must daily be committed?not to 
achieve an evanescent victory but to prevent 
further deterioration in the American mili-
tary position. It is a war in the jungles of 
Asia against an ever-growing and well-
trained guerrilla force that is fighting in its 
own kind of country among its own people 
to overthrow a government, of no popular 
standing or strength, with which the United 
States is allied. 
It is a war the primary goal of which 
now?so far as the United States is con-
cerned?is to convince the Communists that 
they cannot achieve their aims in Vietnam 
by force of arms. And it is a war which, as 
both the President and Ho Chi Minh have 
indicated, could go on for months, years, or 
decades, 
Despite the deep difficulties of the present 
and the tremendous implications for the fu-
ture, few Americans will quarrel with Presi-
dent Johnson's determined conclusion to 
hold on in Vietnam. This is quite different 
from saying we will bring the other side to its 
knees. 
The President is now encouraging Ambas-
sador Goldberg to see what the United Na-
tions or any member country can do to bring 
about negotiations. It is vital to keep open 
the door to a parley, and Mr. Johnson specifi-
cally mentioned his willingness to discuss 
Hanoi's own proposals. The possibilities of 
utilizing the 1954 Geneva Agreement need 
further exploration, as the President again 
indicated. However, it should be recognized 
that the breakdown of the 1954 treaty was 
as much the fault of Saigon and Washington 
as it was of Hanoi. 
But?no doubt because of the deteriorating 
military situation which President Johnson 
has just taken steps to arrest--the Commu-
nists in recent months have shown no indica-
tion whatsoever of a willingness to negotiate. 
Therefore, the problem that faces the Presi-
dent and the American people today is to 
convince the Chinese and Vietnamese Com-
munists that, as Mr. Johnson said, "a violent 
solution is impossible." This goes for both 
sides. The Government of the United States 
knows this and publicly recognizes it, and is 
ready "to move from the battlefield to the 
conference table" without preconditions. 
The President made it very clear yester-
day that he intends a controlled and severely 
limited operation on the part of the United 
States; and this is as important a point as 
could be made. It is fruitless at this stage to 
argue over errors of past policy, going back 
to 1954 and even further beyond. What is 
vital is that this war of the United States in 
Vietnam be held down to the absolute mini-
mum necessary to prove to Hanoi and Peiping 
that military aggression is not worth while 
and never will be. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I hope 
that in the conduct of the war in the 
months ahead every effort will be made 
to minimize American casualties without 
in any way weakening our position in de-
fending those parts of Vietnam? which 
are controlled by ourselves and our allies 
in Saigon. 
VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY'S AD-
DRESS BEFORE NATIONAL GOV-
ERNORS CONFERENCE 
Mr, CLARK. Mr. President, an July 27, 
at Minneapolis, Minn., at the National 
Governors Conference, the Vice President 
of the United States delivered a fine ad-
dress, which I believe should be called to 
the attention of my colleagues and all 
readers of the CoisrosEssroNAL RECORD. 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy 
of the address may be printed in the 
RECORD at this point in my remarks. 
There being no objection, the address

18117 
REMARKS BY VICE PRESIDENT HUBERT HUM-
PHREY AT THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS CON-
PE6R5ENCE, MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., JULY 27, 
19  
Our Government, over these past few days, 
has been reaching important decisions. 
Such decisions challenge us. They test our 
fiber. 
We face adversaries who are tenacious and 
strong and arrogant. 
We face a new and sophisticated assault?
an assault from an enemy organized in de-
tail, trained in depth, skilled in a kind of 
warfare we Americans have only begun to 
understand. 
South Vietnam is the testing ground for 
the so-called war of national liberation?a 
contest in which totalitarians believe they 
can defeat the forces of the most advanced 
of all democratic nations. In South Viet-
nam our adversaries seek to demonstrate de-
cisively that arrogant militancy?and not 
peaceful coexistence?is the path to follow. 
But, great as it is, the challenge we face 
today in Vietnam is only one of many chal-
lenges which confront us. 
We no longer live safe in our continental 
refuge. There is no place to hide. There 
is no security in isolation. 
While our Nation enjoys the greatest pros-
perity in history, and possesses unequaled 
power, we also live in mounting danger and 
uncertainty. 
The world is filled with disorder, violent 
change, yes, revolution. 
We must face the fact that there are 
modern weapons which can destroy the civil-
ize,: world in a half-hour's time. 
We must face the fact that two-thirds 
of the world is poor, hungry, and sick, and 
the gap between the rich nations and the 
poor nations widens each year. These rest-
less, poor and yet proud people demand by 
whatever means, something better. This 
two-thirds of the world is the target for 
those who promise quick and easy solutions 
to old and complex problems. 
The globe is exploding with people. 
We are engulfed in great waves of scien-
tific and technological change which we do 
not fully understand and which can over-
come US OT save 1.18. 
We must master science and technology so 
that it may serve man. 
We must learn the techniques of defeating 
the new tactics of aggression. 
But we must also learn this truth: The 
mere existence of deep poverty in the world 
is not only unjust?it is an invitation to 
freedom's destruction. 
And we must realize that this gigantic task 
of helping others to help themselves, of re-
sisting aggression and protecting freedom 
can only be sustained if America, the 
leader of free nations, is powerful and united. 
Today in southeast Asia, and elsewhere, we 
carry burdens. They require great alloca-
tion of our resources to national security and 
defense. 
Nevertheless, even should these burdens 
grow heavier, we must still devote ourselves 
to building a better society here at home. 
For our wealthy Nation has resources for 
both defense and social justice, for national 
security and domestic well-being. 
Today we face no choice between guns 
and schools, ammunition and medical care. 
We face instead long-term, continuing ne-
cessities on many fronts?necessities which 
are within our power to meet. 
For the only way we Americans will be 
able to carry out world burdens in the years 
ahead will be by creating today a strong, 
healthy and cohesive society. 
We know there are great tasks ahead in 
our own country. 
In 5 years, 211 million people will live here. 
Half of them will be under age 25. Within 
10 years we will need?each year?over 2 mil-
lion new homes, Welfare and health facilities 
for 5 million more people over age 65, trans-

portation systems to move- goods and peo-
ple, fresh air and light and open space. 
United we can size the future and shape it 
for the good of man. Divided we will be-
come the future's victim. 
I have seen the great American space 
launchings at Cape Kennedy. I have seen 
Americans working together there?scientists 
and technicians, military officers, men from 
our universities, the giant prime contrac-
tors, the smaller subcontractors, officials of 
Government, business, labor, and medicine. 
I have seen these people?not. defending 
their separate sovereignties but contributing 
to a partnership, a common cause, for the 
benefit of this Nation and all people. I have 
seen them there?dedicated to excellence 
and success. 
To see Cape Kennedy Ls to know what men 
can do. 
It is a. great lesson for our time. 
That same dedication and unity of effort 
that have vaulted us into the far reaches of 
space must be applied throughout all our 
society. 
We can no longer afford the debility of dis-
unity. We can no longer tolerate the can-
cars of hate and discrimination. 
We must no longer divide ourselves by 
emotional appeals and labels--northerner, 
southerner, labor boss, economic royalist. 
In interdependence is the new dimension 
of international security, it is even more so 
a fact and requirement of domestic strength. 
Today there are those who take for granted 
our role as leader of the free world?just as 
some take for granted our democratic Amer-
ican heritage. But r ask you to consider 
that role. 
The mantle of leadership is not a cloak of 
comfort, but rather the robe of responsibility. 
Leadership does net permit a person or a 
nation license or luxury. 
Leadership imposes responsibility and at-
Orris few privileges. 
Today, to deserve and insure that leader-
ship, we must build a nation of men and 
women able to fulfill the hopes of those who 
cifinee before us and to lay the groundwork 
far the yet unborn generation to follow us. 
Today the world asks: What is the nature 
of today's America??this American being 
tested as never befere. 
I see today% Amertcan as the same restless, 
ildvanturous, citizen as his forebears. 
I see this fellow American as the son or 
daughter of a rich Nation and yet a person 
of conscience, With a deep concern for the 
fate of his fellowman. 
I see him at one Who has defeated the ene-
mies of freedom, yet extends the hand of 
friendship and cooperation to build a new 
and better woted community. 
T see today's American surrounded by ma-
terralisan, yet questioning its value. Impa-
tient with things as they are, but not im-
petioles in remedy or judgment, Generous 
but not patronizing. Motivated by ideal, but 
satisfied only with accomplishment. Strong, 
but not belligerent. Willing to debate, but 
able to decide. 
And the American of this generation be-
lieves that the world need not destroy itself 
by war. He knows that the pursuit of peace 
is an act of courage and that resisting aggres-
sion. is the duty of free men. 
Perhaps the qualities I see in today's 
American are then I wish to see. For these 
are the qualities that must strengthen our 
people in a time of trouble and danger. 
But I believe my thinking is not wishful. 
For today in America we are increasingly 
agreed upon common goals, ire our States, 
In our cities, In our country. 
Today in our society we increasingly 
recognize that what we do today will make 
tomorrow. 
Together, as Americans, we are forging a 
society of strength and justice and oppor-
tunity. And, despite theism who would turn 
us in other directions, we most move ahead 
in our determination. 
That all Americans will have an education 
which can give them opportunity to lift 
themselves, 
That all Americans will have an equal 
right to vote. 
That older Americans will have adequate 
medical care. 
That we can make our cities better places 
in which to live and work in saftey and 
health. 
That we should preserve this Nation's 
beauty, history and natural resources. 
That we must give the aging, poor and by-
passed hope for life and work. 
That we should open our doors again to 
immigrants who can enrich and lend new 
vitality to our national life. 
That we should help others too in less-
fortunate places to find a better life. 
That we shall defend our Nation, and 
those who seek freedom, against attack. 
That we shall not drop the torch of in-
ternational leadership. 
We will need patience. perserverance, in-
ner strength to meet the forces moving 
through the world, to preserve the peace 
above all, in the words of our President, 
"to press forward, not for our gain and our 
greatness alone, but rather for the gain and 
the good of all mankind." 
I believe we Americans will prove equal 
to the hard tasks ahead. 
We shall pursue, with resolution, the res-
toration of peace in southeast Asia. We shall 
prove to the aggressors that the cost of ag-
gression comes too high and that they must 
leave their neighbors alone. We shall once 
again demonstrate by unequivocal action 
and deed that force of arms will not drive 
freedom from the field. 
And, make no mistake about it, if ag-
gression, succeeds in one part of this world, 
it will quickly follow elsewhere. Ti we fail 
to stand today, we shall have to stand to-
morrow. 
We shall uphold freedom's cause wherever 
that cause is threatened?in another corner 
of the world or even in a darkened corner of 
our own country. 
I believe that Americans will not only em-
brace, but lead, the real revolution of our 
times?the revolution which took flame from 
our own in America--the revolution toward 
opportunity, human dignity, self-determina-
tion and self-respect for each child entering 
life. 
We are the progenitors of this world revolu-
tion of emancipation and liberty. It is our 
obligation. In our strength and wealth, to 
give it continued life. 
We are the defenders and the advocates of 
that immortal and continuing commitment 
to all mankinds: 
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal, that they 
are endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these are life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness, That 
to secure thee rights, governments are in-
stituted among men, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed." 
We cannot stand aside and let totalitarians 
seize and distort to their own diabolical pur-
pose the hopes and aspirations of the needy, 
the poor, the weak. 
We can and we will make the promise of 
America come true: One nation, under God, 
indivisible with liberty and justice for all. 
We mut-t, with strong and active faith, 
move forward. If we do, I believe that, in 
the end, history will say that this was a time 
when man's free spirit came under mortal 
threat, and man Prevailed. 
ACTION ON THE HOME HONT?AD-
DRESS BY DAVID E. PRICE, M.D., 
DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I have for 
many years been convinced that govern-
mental action as well as private and civic 
July 29, 1965 
action in the area of population control 
was required if we are to leave our chil-
dren and grandchildren a country, and 
indeed a globe, which they can inhabit. 
I ask unanimous consent that a speech 
entitled "Action on the Home Front," de-
livered by David E. Price, Deputy Sur-
geon General, presented to the Sym-
posium of Population Growth and Birth 
Control at Boston University on April 23, 
1965, may be printed in the REcORD at 
this point in my remarks. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the REcoRD, 
as follows: 
ACT/ON ON elm Home FRONT 
(By David E. Price, M.D., Deputy Surgeon 
General, Public Health Service, Department 
of Health, Education, and Welfare, pre-
sented to the Symposium of Population. 
Growth and Birth Control, Boston Univer-
sity, Boston, Mass., Apr. 23, 1965) 
I welcome the opportunity provided by 
this Symposium on Population Growth and 
Birth Control to discuss the domestic active-
ties of Government in this field. 
Tracing the events that lead to Federal 
action back to their early beginnings?or, 
more exactly, attempting to trace them?is 
almost certainly a futile, but nevertheless a 
fascinating, exercise. Somewhere, sometime, 
of course, one first person has to have rec-
ognized an existing or impending problem 
and to have suggested, in broad terms et 
least, the remedy that eventually will be 
adopted. Typically, he will find few follow-
ers and a notable lag phase occurs. 
But if the problem is real and the remedy 
a sound one in the context of the knowledge 
of the times, it is bound to occur to others 
in due course. The discussion widens--
gradually at first, and then rapidly?and in 
the process two purposes are served. Defini-
tions of the problem and of methods for 
dealing with it are refined and updated, and 
the public is informed of the issues. 
Since we are a democracy, and since the 
powers of our Government are derived from 
the consent of the governed, it follows that 
considerable public discussion and agree-
ment on the need for action, and on the 
feasibility of the action, must occur before 
a governmental program can be effective. 
Unless there is something approaching a 
consensus before a program is initiated, end 
unless a consensus is maintained thereafter, 
that program is not likely to have a long 
Life. As an example, I give you prohibition. 
Population problems have usually been 
seen from two separate viewpoints. One sees 
the problem of total population in relation to 
natural resources and the state of technol-
ogy?an economic viewpoint. The other 
considers the problems of individuals, wheth-
er the total population is expanding or not--
I'll call it a humanitarian approach. It has 
taken some time for these separate schools 
to make common cause. 
The economic viewpoint, the recognition of 
the problems to be created by limited nat-
ural resources in relation to an expanding 
population, is usually traced back to 
Thomas Robert Malthus, although (and here 
I take Lord Keynes as my authority) the 
principal point had been largely made by 
several earlier 18th century writers, but 
without creating any particular stir. It was 
not an argument to impress this country dur-
ing the 19th and early 20th centuries, espe-
cially since it appeared to have been refuted,

each other for population and boasted of 
their successess. Rapid growth of popula-

prosperity. And of course it was, at least for 
some.

proclaiming World Law Day and encourag-
ing their lawyers and judges to attend the 
World Conference. Local exhibits of law 
codes and other law instruments are also 
being planned throughout the world on 
World Law Day. 
This Conference is one of those great mo-
ments in history when men of good will 
gather_ to advance the cause of world peace. 
These men and women of the law will have 
no trouble understanding each other. They 
speak a common language. The language 
found in universal principles of the law. 
But sessions of the Conference will be 
simultaneously translated into French. 
Spanish and English. All books, work papers 
and other documents will also be in these 
three languages. But special arrangements 
for Russian, Japanese, Chinese and other 
languages have been made through use as 
interpreters of foreign law students from 
abroad now studying in the United States 
who will serve as aids to the distinguished 
visitors. 
As we of the law counsel together on 
specific steps to fufill the law's historic mis-
sion of assuring peace within and among 
nations, we will, however, have more aids 
going for us than ever existed before. We 
will have more information on national and 
interational law, more ways of understand-
ing each other, and more preparation work 
than ever yet done on a world law conference. 
The delegates will have 4 basic docu-
ments before them to assist them in their 
work: (1) a workbook of 300 pages sum-
marizing existing international law and in-
ternational judicial institutions; (2) a sum-
mary of existing national law, and national 
judicial institutions in 103 nations plus a 
lawyer, law school, and judicial directory 
covering judicial and law leaders of these 103 
nations; (3) a special work paper giving 
more detail than is contained in the work-
book by one of the world's leading experts on 
each subject to be covered in 12 work ses-
sions; and (4) the first volume of a world 
law code containing the treaties of most ef-
fectiveness on a worldwide basis. 
The subjects to be covered by the 12 work 
sessions are: (1) increasing use and useful-
ness of the World Court; (2) creation and 
jurisdiction of regional, trial and specialized 
courts; (3) existing and proposed interna-
tional arbitration tribunals; (4) interna-
tional law in domestic courts; (5) interna-
tional and satellite communications; (6) law 
guarantees for foreign investments; (7) space 
law; (8) laws affecting human rights; (9) 
international judicial cooperation; (10) dis-
armament law; (11) protection of patents 
and copyrights; and (12) law problems of 
multination corporations in internatonal 
trade. 
But above all, these compilations for the 
Conference on both international and na-
tional law prove that the rule of law is 
growing stronger day by day and that law is 
more used and useful day by day. For ex-
ample, the United Nations itself and its 
specialized agencies have generated more law 
and more legal institutions in the past 20 
years than was created in all the past years 
of recorded history. This contribution to 
law growth alone proves the U.N.'s great 
value but it is often overlooked in the dire 
moaning over the veto in the Security Coun-
cil and dues impass in the Assembly. And 
this fact will give Mr. Justice Goldberg a 
real foundation for his law leadership 
through the U.N. The facts in the work book 
on the Common Market also prove the great 
value of an international court for there it is 
recorded that this Market's Supreme Court 
Of Justice has decided over 1,000 cases over 
the past few years between nations that 
formerly used war as their ultimate method 
of decision. The Conference documents are

literally chuck-full of similar facts proving 
law's recent dramatic growth and usefulness 
internationally. 
The Conference has generated a number of 
"firsts," all designed to bring law sources, 
traditions, and heritage to bear on the work 
program to expand and create more law, 
.tmore courts, and more legal institutions to 
further world peace. Among these are: (1) 
the first world gathering of high court judges 
of nations; (2) the first World Law Day; and 
(3) the first World Exhibit of Law Codes 
and Historic Instruments of the Law, col-
lected from all over the world including 
England's Magna Carta (750 years old this 
year), our own Constitution, Bill of Rights, 
and similar documents from many nations. 
Current law codes of nations, law books and 
United Nations and other international law 
documents will also be exhibited not only at 
the Conference but in national and state 
capitals, city halls, courthouses, bar head-
quarters, libraries and other public buildings 
all over the world in honor of World Law 
Day. 
Copies of the provisional program-, and 
brochures in three languages, on World Law 
Day and the World Exhibit of Law Codes, and 
Historic Instruments of the Law have been 
released. There have been all kinds of world 
exhibits on everything from airplanes to 
waste disposals for kitchens but this is in 
fact the first law show ever held on a world 
basis. It should be interesting to view the 
law codes of nations in their native lan-
guages and thrilling to see the great histortc 
law instruments which have meant so much 
in humankind's slow crawl upward from 
caveman to-the space age. All the "golden" 
, eras of history where man benefited most 
from improvements in his economic and so-
cial status have been eras of great advances 
in law. From the oldest known law code, 
Hamxnurabi's Babylon law code in 2000 B.C., 
,to the Law of Moses in 1450 B.C., to Jtisti-
nian's Roman Law Code of AD. 6, to our own 
Constitution in 1787, growth in the field of 
law has been synonymous with recognition of 
human liberties and advancement of the 
status of the individual. 
While the conference is the major legal 
event of International Cooperation Year, this 
agenda Of research, information, and cooper-
ation contains ideas of advance law in the 
world which have been 8 years in the making. 
This program was launched by the American 
Bar Association during its historic meeting 
in London in 1957. Since then the interest, 
support, and cooperation has been secured of 
the leaders of over 1 million judges and 
lawyers in 120 nations. A meeting has been 
held for the lawyers on each Continent, i.e., 
in Tokyo for Asia, Lagos for Africa, Rome for 
Europe, and San Jose, Costa Rica, for the 
American Continent, and a World Conference 
attended by over 1,000 delegates from 102 na-
tions was held 2 years ago in Athens, Greece. 
At the World Conference the World Peace 
Through Law Center was created to serve as 
the secretariat for the work program there 
adopted and is entirely self-sustaining from 
dues paid by lawyers. The center, now has a 
worldwide membership, a staff of 27, monthly 
and other publications and will shortly open 
a world headquarters in Europe for which it 
has been given a grant of $100,000 to erect 
a building. Already the 60 working com-
mittees of the center have generated a plan 
for a new court system, new law rules and 
similar programs. Ideas talked about for 
centuries are being hammered into concrete 
programs by these committees. The volume 
containing the Athens proceedings?a veri-
table storehouse of fact and history on inter-
national law?was published by West Pub-
lishing Co., and is available to anyone who 
wishes to purchase it. 
To the past conferences heads of state 
sent over 100 messages attesting to their 
belief in the ultimate goal of a world ruled 
by law. Already similar messages are being 
received for the September conference. 
The friendship created at these confer-
ences among law leaders of the world and 
the resulting ever-accelerating worldwide 
dialog on law, its processes and institu-
tions, and their aid to world peace, have 
been major contributions to the advance 
of world peace through law. 
I would like to stress that this new initia-
tive for the triumph of the age-old idea of 
world peace through law has become more 
than an American initiative, it has indeed 
become the program for peace of the world's 
legal profession. 
The Washington world conference will 
consider and adopt a program to give sub-
stance to the towering ideal that a world 
ruked by law will be a world at peace. This 
means expansion and acceleration of the 
work program adopted at Athens 2 years 
ago. It also means approval of concerete 
steps to match our words with a program 
to give them substance. 
This is a once-in-a-lifetime conference for 
the lawyers of the United States. Future 
world conferences will be held in other na-
tions. So be sure you attend. I remind 
that every judge, lawyer, or law professor 
may attend. ? Laymen may also attend as 
observers. Advance registrations from 96 
countries now total over 1,200, insuring that 
our goal of 2,000 judges, lawyers, and law 
professors from over 100 nations will be 
achieved. 
The eyes of the legal world most certainly, 
and perhaps those of the lay people of the 
world as well, will be focused hopefully on 
this Washington World Law Conference. I 
believe that this is the time and we are the 
people to give reality to the great ideal which 
is our goal. As the Conference labors to cre-
ate conditions for world p,eace by strength-
ening the world's law and judicial institu-
tions no One can wish it ill. Every man, 
woman, and child is bound to benefit, and 
no one can be hurt by its endeavors. Dele-
gates will not seek St. Thomas More's utopia 
or offer their program as a panacea. The 
rule of law allows man diversity and differ-
ences in a framework of peace. These work-
nrs for peace under law are practical and 
down to earth, not dreamers. Lawyers and 
judges realize that nations are run by men 
and disputes are inherent in human nature. 
A lawyer or judge lives a life attuned to the 
fact that the very nature of society is such 
that it creates divisions, struggles, differ-
ences, and conflicts. 
So the delegates at the Conference will not 
seek impossible perfection but merely strive 
to create a legal harness for man's great new 
power which will cause its use for mankind's 
benefit rather than his death. They know 
that where law rules exist disputes are less 
likely to occur, and that if disputes can be 
directed into courthouses the bloodbath of 
the battlefield can be avoided. This fact is 
proved by every area where law is both world-
wide and universally observed. Good illus-
trations are the law of the sea, diplomatic 
immunity, and the postal convention. All 
over the world in nation after nation and 
Internationally, all a law and judicial sys-
tem consist of are law rules to avoid conflict 
and a forum for peaceful resolution of those 
conflicts that do occur. So the effort of the 
Washington Law Conference will be to in-
crease the amount of law rules and to start 
the building of a world court system. Thus 
-will law and courts perform more and more 
the same function internationally they now 
perform within nations. By action to gener-
ate more law and more courts, the delegates 
at the Conference will draw mankind close 
to the towering ideal of a world ruled by law. 
Their initiative will thus give concrete mean-
ing, validity, and continued forward move-
ment to the age-old aspiration for a peaceful 
world order under the rule of law. All men 
must concede that whenever the rule of law 
becomes strong enough to be a controlling 
factor in the world community, then, and 
then only, will any man be able to go any-
where on the face of the earth (or travel in 
endless space) in freedom, in dignity, and in 
peace. 
I summon each of you to this the greatest 
endeavor of our stofession. 
T'S SPEECH 
ON VIETNAM 
Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that I may proceed for 
5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MOSS. No American who saw 
President Johnson on television yester-
day as he discussed our commitment in 
Vietnam could doubt his personal con-
cern, his reluctance to escalate further 
our military involvement there, or his 
earnest search for a nonmilitary solution 
to the conflict through the United Na-
tions or otherwise. Neither could any 
American doubt the dedication of the 
President firmly to make good the com-
mitment of this Nation to keep its word 
to a small country now cruelly attacked 
by its neighbor and torn internally by 
defections of its own citizens. To keep 
our word, we must send still more troops, 
spend more money, and risk increased 
reprisals. As the President said "We did 
not choose to be the guardians at the 
gate." But since there was no one else, 
we stepped forward to aid a beleaguered, 
friendly, free nation. And we will not 
be driven out, nor quit the field in weari-
ness or fear. We earnestly seek a peace-
ful settlement and will sit at the confer-
ence table anytime with North Vietnam, 
or "any government whose people may 
be affected." This is broad enough to 
include the whole world. We fear no 
meeting, in fact, we welcome any such 
opportunity to discuss a settlement. 
With touching eloquence, the Presi-
dent answered the groping question, 
"Why are we in Vietnam?" Our citizens 
who honestly are puzzled or uninformed 
now have, once again, a clear answer. 
And those who refuse to listen or who 
seek to stir division and dissent, must do 
so in face of the simple, clear, and mov-
ing explanation of our President. 
We are in Vietnam to fulfill our pledge 
to support freedom and resist aggression. 
Our national word is at stake. We seek 
no selfish gain. We yearn for peace. 
We will do any honorable thing to termi-
nate combat. 
Like most Americans, I have deep mis-
givings about our involvement in Viet-
nam. I feel frustration with shifting 
succession of governments. I recognize 
the perils for our soldiers. With all my 
heart I wish that this ordeal would pass 
from us. But there is a greater need in 
this world, pointed out by President 
Johnson?a need for governmental free-
dom from aggression, a need for world 
order and world law, a need for honor-
able commitments honorably, kept, a 
need to halt world lawlessness. 
So I give to President Johnson my full 
support in this dangerous time of trial. 
I applaud his motives. I commend his 
search for a peaceful solution. I back

his firmness with the aggressor. I take 
pride in his integrity. 
Ew sEcritnuty ANTHONY J. 
CELEBREZZE 
Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. 
President, in July 1962, when Anthony J. 
Celebrezze moved into the Cabinet post 
of Secretary of Health, Education, and 
Welfare, a newspaper article commented 
cm "Tony's Impossible Task." 
This month, July 1965, having secured 
3 years as Department head of one of 
our Nation's busiest, most diverse gov-
ernrnental agencies, he is leaving to   
con-
tinue his public service as a Federal 
fudge?after having worked longer at 
his "impossible task" than any of his 
predecessors. 
As a commentary on the good will, in-
tense energy, and devotion to duty with 
which Mr. Celebrezze discharged his re-
sponsibilities, President Lyndon B. John-
son stated "I have both a feeling of pride 
In Secretary Celebrezze's accession to 
this high court?and a reluctance in see-
ing him depart the Department he has 
guided so skillfully." 
I, personally, shall remember with ap-
preciation his sympathetic understand-
ing of my hopes to bring an environmen-
tal health center to my own State of 
West Virginia. He, at all times, was 
mindful of the needs of West Virginians 
and desirous of meeting those needs as 
best possible within the scope of his 
Agency. I feel that the final determina-
tion to place an Appalachian Regional 
Environmental Health Center in West 
Virginia owes much to his realization 
a its value in the rejuvenation of the 
State, and the Appalachian region, as 
well as to his assessment that the State's 
attributes are peculiarly adapted to ac-
commodate a center of this type. 
I feel, too, that because Secretary Cele-
brezze is a man who understands well 
that America is a land of ever-expanding 
opportunity, he worked to give all Amer-
-leans a better chance, through the pro-
grams of his Department, at the dignity, 
health, self-respect, and economic well-
being which are a part of the basic prom-
ise of our Nation to its citizens. 
SEVEN YEARS OF PROSPERITY 
WITHOUT INFLATION 
Mr, PROX1VIIRE. Mr. President, an 
article entitled "U.S. Inflation Discount-
ed in Chase Report," published in the 
financial section of the Washington 
Post, is an extremely interesting news 
item. It reads, in part: 
The chase Manhattan Bank says the wide-
ly held belief that we are living in an era 
of price inflation is erroneous. 
In its publication, Business in Brief, the 
bank notes that the United States had no 
significant inflation during the past 7 years. 
This Is A most remarkable economic 
aChleVelnent The United States has 
had 7 years of prosperity and has en-
joyed the highest income the country 
has ever had. The economy has had a 
tremendous surge in the past 4 or 5 years 
without price inflation. This is a great 
tribute to our Government Ikricl to Mem-
bers of Congress on both sides of the 
aisle. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the article in its entirety be 
printed in the RECORD. , 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
U.S. INFLATION DISCOUNTED IN CUASE REPORT 
Nzw Yoila.?The Chase Manhattan Bank 
says the widely held belief that we are living 
in an era of price inflation is erroneous. 
In its publication, Business in Brief, the 
bank notes that the United States had no 
significant inflation during the past 7 years. 
It cautions, however, that "we must be con-
stantly alert to the danger of inflation and 
that excessive Government spending, credit 
expansion, and wage increases can lead to 
serious inflation." 
The report suggests that the major reason 
why people think prices have been rising is 
that they fail to take account of the upgrad-
ing of their purchases. The bank says peo-
ple are eating better, buying better clothes, 
spending more on travel and recreation. In 
the sense, however, that monthly spending 
has increased, the bank adds, the cost of 
living has climbed, 
STATUS OF WOMEN 
Mrs. NEUBERGER. Mr. President, as 
an outgrowth of President Kennedy's 
Commission on the Status of Women, 44 
States have set up continuing studies in 
the form of Governor's Commissions on 
the Status of Women. 
Representatives of these State com-
missions are now meeting in convention 
in Washington and their opening meet-
ing was highlighted by an address by 
the Vice President. In his remarks he 
said: 
The talent of the American woman is an 
important _resource in this Nation. 
He further pointed out the efforts of 
President Johnson to find qualified 
women for appointment to high Govern-
ment positions. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have the text of the Vice Presi-
dent's remarks to the opening session 
printed in the Rrcoxn. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
ADDRESS BY VICE PRESIDENT HUBERT B. 1m-
PHREY, CONFERENCE OF GOVERNORS CO S-
SIONS ON STATUS OF WOMEN, JULY 29, 1965 
It is my honor to addrw leaders in Gov-
ernors' programs for strengthening oppor-
tunities for American women. 
You represent an outstanding cross-sec-
tion of civic leadership in every aspect of 
American life. 
The very increase in the number of Gov-
ernors' commissions?now 44?shows the 
vital interest in your mission. 
In State after State you have held up a 
public mirror to the legal framework which 
can foster or hinder women's rights. And 
where the mirror has revealed flaws?archaic, 
discriminatory statutes, or gaps in protective 
law?commissions have served as catalysts 
for improvement. 
At the same time you have broadened the 
abridges" of education, training and coun-
seling, so that more and more women can 
realize their highest potential. 
Most important, you have helped bring 
about a new climate of public opinion. 
Step by step, you have helped translate 
Anto reality, more and More of the goals en-
Approved 
visioned in the historic report submitted to 
President Kennedy by the Commission on 
the Status of Women in 1963. 
We owe a great deal to the Chairman of 
that Commission, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, 
who did not live to see the report completed. 
Today, more Americans than ever before, 
in public and private life, are committed to 
helping women achieve their birthright as 
citizens. 
The talent of the American woman is an 
important resource in this Nation. 
But I must be frank. 
All too often it is a wasted resource. 
Only 14.1 percent of working women are 
in the professions or in technical work. 
And only 4.5 percent are managers, officials, 
and proprietors. 
The worst of it is that there has been an 
almost continuous decline in the percentage 
of women working in these jobs. 
One of the reasons, of course, why 
women's employment opportunities are lim-
ited is that their education is too often 
Women comprised 51 percent of the 1964 
American high school graduating class. 
But when it comes to college the girls, 
their parents and even their teachers and 
counselors have some second thoughts. And 
so, looking again at te 1964 record, we find 
that while 51 percent of the June high 
school graduates were girls, in the fall, only 
45 percent of the students entering college 
were girls. 
' Nor has the American woman's record in 
college been as high as we would like. 
There has been an actual decline, since 
1930, in the percentage of higher degrees 
earned by women. 
But education isn't the only factor limiting 
woman's opportunities. 
There are restrictive hiring practices and a 
disinclination to promote women or to give 
them the same on the job training men re-
ceive. 
The President's Commission on the Status 
of Women has taken the lead in opening 
more opportunities to women. IM work has 
continued under President Johnson through 
the interdepartmental committee and the 
Citizens' Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women. Your Governors commissions are 
working to improve the status of women at 
the State level. 
These commissions and committees are 
concerned with a good deal more than job op-
portunities for women. They are interested 
in the education of girls and in continuing 
education for women. They are stressing the 
need to strengthen the home by providing 
more community services. They are particu-
larly concerned that working mothers have 
adequate facilities for child care while they 
work. They are investigating the possibility 
of more work opportunities for women who 
must also maintain their homes. 
In 1962 the Attorney General reviewed an 
1870 law which Government hiring officers 
used as the basis for specifying man or 
woman in filling vacancies. The Attorney 
General held that the old law did not give 
appointing officers that prerogative and that 
the President had authority to regulate the 
right of appointing officers in this matter. 
Immediately the President directed heads of 
agencies to make future appointments solely 
on the basis of merit. 
But it was President Johnson's talent 
search for qualified women which really 
opened the doors for women in Government. 
Shortly after the President took office he 
announced that Government would no longer 
be for men only. 
Since January 1, 1964, he has appointed 
more than 115 women to high-level Govern-
ment positions. In addition, Government 
agencies have appointed or promoted more 
than 2,800 other women to Jobe paying $10-
000 or more a year.

In the President's words: "We tan waste 
no talent, we can-frustrate no creative power, 
we can neglect no skill in our search for an 
open and just and challenging society." 
Private industry is following the Presi-
dent's example. 
One factor helping this trend is a shortage 
of skilled workers in such fields as engineer-
ing, science, mathematics and business ad-
ministration. 
Qualified women can fill these jobs. Those 
not today qualified can become qualified 
through study and work. 
Private employment practices also are 
being affected by steps being taken by the 
U.S. Employment Service. The Employment 
Service is urging acceptance and use through-
out the country of hiring specifications based 
exclusively on-job performance factors. 
There is other progress: 
Last year the Equal Pay Act established the 
principle of equal pay as national policy. 
Now it rules out all discrimination in em-
ployment on the basis of sex and applies in 
Interstate commerce. 
But the greatest barriers are the psycho-
logical barriers. 
The U.S. Civil Service Commission has 
done research on widely held views and at-
titudes. It has defined a whole series of 
myths?some held by men, others held by 
women, some by both. 
I refer to myths such as "women do not 
make good bosses," or "it is inefficient to 
train women because of high turnover." The 
facts prove otherwise. 
If we would clear the road ahead for both 
men and women, we must clear all of our 
minds of these mental cobwebs. 
An open mind, like an open heart, is the 
prerequisite for an open door. 
And here we might recall the words of 
America's first woman Cabinet member, Mrs. 
Frances Perkins. She used to say that her 
grandmother had taught her: "If anyone 
opens a door, one should always go through." 
The doors of opportunity are opening to-
day. 
Working together we can reach our goal: 
full and equal opportunity for all the wom-
en of America in all parts of American life. 
Presiffent Johnson is committed to that 
goal. r join him in that commitment. With 
your continued help we will succeed. 
RUSSELL: FIT AND READY 
Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, on 
the day of the return to the Senate after 
an illness of my warm friend and dis-
tinguished colleague, the senior Senator 
from Georgia, many Members of this 
body rose to extend their congratulations 
and to salute DICK RUSSELL for his long 
and dedicated outstanding service to his 
State and Nation. 
Since his return, Senator RUSSELL has 
resumed his position of leadership and 
responsibility in the Senate and his vital 
duties as chairman of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee. As the Atlanta Journal 
commented editorially on July 27, Sena-
tor RUSSELL is indeed "fit and ready." 
I ask unanimous consent that this edi-
torial, which is a well-deserved tribute 
to a Senator who already has done so 
much and who is prepared to do more, be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 
RUSSELL: FIT AND READY 
Senator RICHARD B. RUSSELL'S resumption 
of command (or chairmanship) of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee is timed pro-
pitiously inasmuch as military business 
and Georgia politics are concerned. 
He returns to the leadership of his com-
mittee just as a vital and controversial piece 
of legislation comes up for consideration?
the military pay bill. 
And his return to active chieftanship 
should be one more indication that he is 
ready and willing and able to handle the 
duties incumbent on a U.S. Senator. 
The military pay bill has passed the House 
of Representatives, but not in the form re-
quested by the Johnson administration. The 
House increased it beyond the admminis-
tration's limits. And the administration has 
made no secret that it hopes to gain support 
for limited raises within the Senate. 
But Senator RUSSELL has made it plain 
that he is prepared to do battle with the 
administration on this point. He advocates 
raises more in line with those approved by 
the House. 
His point is that if the Reserves must be 
called up and if those already in the Armed 
Forces must be held beyond their discharge 
point, then there should be some compensa-
tion in the form of a sizable increase. 
It is a point well made. 
Senator RUSSELL could have taken it easy. 
He could have gone on record as supporting 
the administration's stand on military pay. 
He could have done so in the name of 
loyalty. He could have rationalized such a 
stand with no trouble. And in so doing he 
could have assumed leadership of his com-
mittee in name, and faced no great task or 
problem. 
But Senator RUSSELL obviously feels a 
great responsibility for his nation and for 
the men already in uniform and those who 
will be in the near future. And so he is 
choosing to do battle with the administra-
tion's position. 
If any evidence were needed to show that 
Senator RUSSELL is fit and ready for his job?
fit and ready for a long time to come?then 
his resumption of active leadership has 
eliminated that need. 
He has shown he is ready, and the men in 
uniform may well be grateful that he is. 
"A MOMENT OF TRUTH"?ADDRESS 
BY JUSTICE EDWARD F. CARTER 
Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, the 
preservation of the liberties and privi-
leges of every citizen of this Nation de-
serves our Continuing attention. 
A thoughtful speech was recently 
made on this subject by Edward F. 
Carter, an associate justice of the 
Supreme Court of Nebraska. Justice 
Carter is one of our State's leading jur-
ists. He is the dean of the Nebraska 
Supreme Court on which he has served 
since 1935. Ift 1947 and 1948 he was one 
of the judges on the 5th Military Tri-
bunal at Nuremberg, Germany, presiding 
at the trials of major German war 
criminals. 
During his long experience on the 
bench, he has seen many disquieting 
trends in our Government. 
Speaking before the South Platte 
United Chambers of Commerce in North 
Platte, Nebr., on July 13 of this year, 
Justice Carter recounted the worries of 
some .drafters of the Constitution. He 
described the extent to which these 
prophetic worries have come about. 
While drafting the Constitution, and 
during the debates in Virginia on ratifi-
cation, patriots Eke Patrick Henry, 
George Mason, and Edmund Randolph 
voiced many doubts about the new Con-
stitution. They feared that the Central 
Government would become so powerful 
that it could destroy the States by ab-
sorbing the powers reserved to them. 
These men realized that the very gen-
eral words used in the Constitution could 
be given meanings totally different from 
those intended by the framers. These 
men saw tyranny approaching, not in 
the form of a foreign nation, but in the 
very government that they were creating 
for themselves., 
The 10th amendment was added to 
the Constitution to prevent encroach-
ment by the Federal Government, but, 
as Justice Carted showed, many of these 
gloomy predictions have become reality. 
Mr. President, we should all consider 
Justice Carter's speech, for his remarks 
reach to the heart of one of this Nation's 
most dangerous problems. I ask unani-
mous consent that his speech be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the speech 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
A MOMENT OF TRUTH 
(By Edward L. Carter, Justice, Supreme 
Court of Nebraska) 
Nearly two centuries ago an embryo na-
tion of a little more than 3 million people 
occupied part of the eastern coastal area ex-
tending from southern Maine to northeast-
ern Georgia. All but 10 percent of the peo-
ple lived in small villages and remote agri-
cultural areas, connected only by trails that 
for the most part were passable only for men 
on foot or horseback. Only six cities had a 
population exceeding 8,000; the largest, 
Philadelphia, numbered only 42,000. 
The industrial revolution had hardly 
reached this side of the Atlantic. The first 
cotton mill in America had not been estab-
lished, and other industries were in a primi-
tive handicraft stage. For manufactured 
goods the people were dependent almost en-
tirely on imports from England. To the 
north of this little country was Canada, 
a colony of Great Britain; to the south 
and southwest a vast area held by 
Spain; and shortly the whole Mississippi 
Valley area was claimed by the French un-
der Napoleon. Compared with those giants 
of their times, the new nation was but a 
pygmy with a total population about that of 
the city of Chicago today. 
Nevertheless, the people of this little na-
tion refused to tie up with any of the great 
powers of their day and found the courage 
to stand alone. They raised their own food, 
made their own clothes, and hewed their 
homes from native timber. Times were 
hard, but they were free. To become free 
they fought a war with Great Britain, the 
most powerful nation in the world at that 
time. They determined to create a govern-
ment that would guarantee freedom and lib-
erty for its people and the generations that 
were to follow them. A written constitu-
tion was formulated, finally adopted and rati-
fied, and the United States was born. 
They had lived many years under the 
tyranny of British Kings, primarily George 
III. They had lived a dozen years under 
the Articles of Confederation which was 
nothing more than an alliance of the sov-
ereign States, without an executive head or 
a system of courts. The Congress of those 
times was so limited in power that it was 
almost nonfunctional as a governing agency. 
They well knew of the tendency of all men 
In places.of power to exercise more author-
ity than was lawfully given to them. They 
knew also that there was a general tendency 
for governmental powers to gravitate toward 
a central authority and to become dictorial 
and tyrannical. The conceived a new phi-
losophy of government, generally referred to

TWIST AND RESPECT 
Mr. BARTLET,T. Mr. President, it is 
an easy thing to clobber a Secretary of 
State. It is an old American pastime. 
Cordell Hull, Dean Acheson, and John 
Foster Dulles did not escape criticism 
when they held the office and Certainly 
our present Secretary is having his 
share. 
What makes it easy to attack a Secre-
tary of State is what makes his job so 
hard. He is charged with the direction 
of our foreign policy to see that it con-
forms with our long-range, overall na-
tional interests and ambitions. In line 
with this is the responsibility of keeping 
our allies friendly and our enemies from 
War; the maintenance of our allied 
shield and the preservation of peace. 
And so the Secretary must place a re-
straining hand on the adventurers who 
would risk long-range welfare for short-
range gain; the traders who would de-
stroy an ally to get rich quick, and the 
war hawks who call for gunboat diplo-
macy abroad for political advantage at 
home. All of these must be restrained 
if our Nation's long and lasting interests 
are to be served. It is not a simple job. 
The Secretary is exposed to well-nigh 
unijnaginable pressures from both with-
out and within the Nation. 
To support him in withstanding this 
pressure, the Secretary has but the sup-
port of the President, which is unswerv-
ing, the support of the bureaucracy, 
Which is unavailing and the Congress. 
It is important the Congress give the 
Secretary its confidence and its trust. 
We are ,fortunate to have Dean Rusk 
as Secretary of State. For over 4 years 
he has borne the mankilling responsi-
bility of his office, With calm high in-
telligence and quiet good judgment he 
has acted with balance and restraint 
through the Berlin crisis of 1961, the 
Bay of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis, the 
Dominican crisis, the collapse of Laos, 
and the deepening tragedy of Vietnam. 
He has no flair for or interest in 
drama, publicity or quick, false solu-
tions. He does a job and he does it well. 
We are lucky, Mr. President, to have 
such a man as Secretary of State. 
By now no doubt he has learned to 
cope with the slings and arrows and the 
potshots to which he is exposed. But 
for once I would like to say?clearly and 
for the record?that Secretary Rusk has 
my respect, admiration and trust. I am 
certain the great majority of the Con-
gress and of the country join with me in 
this statement. 
EFFECTS OF SUPREME COURT 
DECISION ON APPORTIONMENT 
HAVE BEEN GOOD 
Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that a very able edi-
torial published in the Chicago Ameri-
can on Monday, July 26, 1965, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objectioh, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
DIRKSEN'S UPHILL FIGHT 
Illinois' Senator EVERETT DIRKSEN plainly 
intends to light one of the major campaigns 
,of his career on the issue of the Supreme 
Court's reapportionment ruling. DnucsErT 
is trying to push through the Senate a pro-
posed constitutional amendment that would 
overturn the Court's one-man, one-vote 
ruling, which required that both houses of 
a State legislature must be elected from dis-
tricts of substantially equal population. 
We find ourselves sympathizing with DIRK-
SEN, while feeling no enthusiasm at all for 
his resolution. When the Supreme Court 
handed down its one-man, one-vote ruling, 
we criticized it on the same grounds as 
DIBKSEN: that it was an unwarranted and 
dangerous extension of power on the part 
of the Court to start tampering with the 
political makeup of States. That we think 
is still true, but some further practical con-
siderations need to be added. 
One is that, whether or not the Supreme 
Court had any business making such a de-
cision, the ruling did put an end to an 
unfair situation that could not have been 
ended in any other way. In many States, 
the majority of the senate represents a mi-
nority of the population; rural districts rep-
resenting, say, one-fourth of the population 
may have a greater voice in the senate than 
urban districts representing half of it. Un-
less you can argue convincingly that State 
senators should represent something other 
than people, this is plainly inequitable. 
One often-heard contention is that State 
legislatures must be patterned after Con-
gress, where each State is entitled to two 
Senators and elects them without regard to 
population. But there is no necessary par-
allel here. The States were in existence be-
fore the Federal Union was (as the name 
"United States" implies), and have a political 
entity of their own. That is not true of 
senatorial districts of other subdivisions 
within States. 
Moreover, the unfairness of the old sys-
tem was built into it and is self-perpetuat-
ing. Obviously, no majority of a State sen-
ate would ever vote to become the minority; 
only some outside agency could change 
the system. And now that the Supreme 
Court has done so, we see no reason why the 
majorities that benefited from its ruling, 
18129 
should penalize themselves by backing DIRK-
SEN'S amendment. 
In short, even if the Supreme Court acted 
wrongly in making this decision, its effects 
are good. Congress no doubt should act to 
curb the Supreme Court and reassert its 
own lawmaking authority; but it will have 
a better chance of success if it concentrates 
on court rulings that have bad results. 
Mr. DOUGLAS. The editorial ex-
presses sympathy with my colleague 
[Mr. DIRKSEN1, although declaring no 
feeling of enthusiasm for his joint reso-
lution. While the writer was not enthu-
siastic about the fact that the Supreme 
Court made its rulings on reapportion-
ment, it concludes that the effects of 
those decisions were good. 
The editorial states that Congress 
"will have a better chance of success if 
it concentrates on court rulings that 
have had bad results." 
Since the editorial states that the rul-
ings of the Supreme Court on reappor-
tionment have had good results, I as-
sume that it is a polite way of opposing 
the so-called Dirksen amendment. 
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR SLEEP-
ING BEAR DUNES 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, on July, 13 
and 14 hearings were held by the Sub-
committee on Parks and Recreation of 
the Senate Committee on Interior and 
Insular Affairs on S. 936 providing for 
the establishment of the Sleeping Bear 
Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan. 
This year's hearings showed increas-
ing and significant Support for this pro-
posal reflecting the growing desire in 
Michigan that this bill be enacted into 
law in the present Congress. Among the 
important additional evidences of sup-
port was a letter from the American 
Automobile Association received after 
the hearings. I ask unanimous consent 
that it be printed In the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

early enactment of S. 936, by Senator HART, 
Democrat, of Michigan, and Senator MONA-
IvIARA, Democrat, of Michigan, providing for 
the establishment of Sleeping Bear Dunes 
National Lakeshore in the State of Michigan.

"Development of recreation and vacation 
areas has not kept pace with the require-
ments of the American people, nor can these 
regions continue to meet the needs of an 
expanding population. The AAA believes 
that government?State and Federal?must 
place increasing emphasis on the creation of 
new recreational travel resources throughout 
the country." 
Development of Sleeping Bear Dunes Na-
tional Lakeshore will provide 46,100 acres of 
scenic land and 31 miles of shoreline. High 
dunes, inland lakes, and green forests make, 
this area outstanding in terms of scenic 
beauty. This area will provide excellent 
swimming, sun bathing, fishing, water ski-

- Within a 300-mile radius are the great 
midwestern cities of Chicago and Detroit. It 
is also estimated that some 20 million people 
reside within 1 day's drive of the Sleeping 
Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. 
In 1964, according to the National Park 
Service, a total of 102,375,100 people visited 
U.S. national parks and other areas admin-
istered by the National Park Service. Of this 
total, it is estimated that 98 percent visited 
these national parks and recreational areas 
by automobile. 
The AAA supports the establishment of 
Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore be-
cause we feel it will help fulfill the need for 
additional recreational service facilities such 
as boating, swimming, fishing, hunting, 
touring, camping, picnicking, etc. 
It is requested that this letter be made a 
part of the official hearings of your subcom-
mittee.

Director, Legal Department. 
HYRUM DAM PROJECT IN UTAH 
PROVIDES BENEFITS TO PUBLIC 
Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, 30 years 
ago valuable irrigation water was first 
released from behind Hyrum Dam in 
northern Utah to begin feeding a highly 
productive farm area along the Little 
Bear River in Cache County. 
Since that time, millions of gallons 
of almost priceless water has been cap-
tured in the relatively small Hyrum Res-
ervoir, where it could be held and released 
as needed. 
Construction of the Hyrum project was 
approved by the President in 1933, with 
funds made available under the National 
Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 in the 
amount Of $930,000. 
Hyrum Reservoir holds 18,700 acre-
feet of water and in its 30 years of op-
eration there has never been a year 
when the reservoir did not fill to over-
flowing. Three canals take irrigation 
water from the 116-foot-high dam to 
delivery points to the north and south. 
The Hyrum project is the primary 
source of water for about 4,000 acres of 
productive farmland, and a supple-
mental source of water for an additional 
3,000 acres. 
As many of my colleagues are aware 
the Mormon pioneers, led to the Utah 
territory by Brigham Young, are credited 
with devising the first system of irriga-
tion applied by Anglo-Saxons to arid and 
semiarid lands. This was an absolute 
necessity, since the springs and rivers 
along the mountains did not provide 
water for enough farmland to feed a 
growing population in this desert area. 
Planning and investigation of reclama-
tion and irrigation projects came early 
in Utah's modern history. The Hyrum 
project was first studied shortly after the 
turn of the century. 
Now, the number of subscribers to the 
Hyrum project increases annually as at-
tempts to dry-farm prove futile. The 
subscribers are repaying the cost of the 
Hyrum project in annual payments based 
on crop valuation. 
Other benefits are now accruing to the 
public because of the Hyrum project. 
Recreation features of the reservoir have 
been administered by the Utah State 
Park and Recreation Commission as the 
Hyrum State Park. A boat ramp and 
campgrounds had almost 19,000 visitors 
last year, a figure which is small in num-
ber but highly important to the northern 
part of Utah. 
The Hyrum project is one, of the Bu-
reau of Reclamation's smaller projects, 
but its 30-year-old success story is a 
prime example of beneficial Federal, 
State, and local cooperation which has 
provided an improved economy and mul-
tiple benefits to an important segment 
of our population. 
While the reclamation work Congress 
considers today often runs into cost 
figures in the millions of dollars, the 
compensation we receive through more 
usable water, better flood control, and 
greatly increased recreation for a grow-
ing population will be measured in the 
billions of dollars in years to come. 
Mr. President, I am proud to call to 
the attention of the Senate this success 
story, and I will continue working for a 
better America through conservation of 
one of our most important natural re-
sources?the water in our streams and 
APPRA.T.SA NINGS IN 
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, it is 
Important that we keep up with what is 
going on in the Dominican Republic. 
Three interesting presentations?one by 
Juan Bosch, the deposed President in 
whose behalf the current revolution 
started, which appeared in the July 24 
issue of the New Republic; and another 
one by Tad Szulc, probably one of the 
most knowledgeable experts among 
newspapermen on Latin America, which 
appears in the-July 31 issue of the Satur-
day Evening Post; and the leading com-
ment in the current issue of the Vision 
Letter, of which the former President of 
Colombia, Dr. Lleras Camargo, is an edi-
tor, are of interest and value. 
I ask unanimous consent that these 
three articles be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE DOMINICAN REVOLUTION 
(By Juan Bosch) 
In most Latin American capitals newsmen 
writing about the Dominican crisis are still 
asking: "Why didn't Juan Bosch return to 
his country?" Some say that in the first 
moments of the Dominican revolution a rebel 
plane landed in San Juan in Puerto Rico to 
take me home and I refused to use it. This 
is a lie. 
The constitutionalist revolution began at 
noon on April 24, in the city of Santo 
Domingo; the so-called government of Reid 
Cabral immediately closed the international 
airport at Punta Caucedo. Because San Isi-
dro, General Wessin y Wessin's base, lies be-
tween Punta Caucedo and the city of Santo 
Domingo, Wessin y Wessin's base, lies between 
Punta Oaucedo and the city of Santo 
Domingo, Wessin y Wessin's control over the 
airport was complete from the very begin-
ning. By 4 in the afternoon Wessin's 
tanks were blocking entrance to the city 
via Punta ?tamed?, which is the same as 
the route from San Isidro; and it was only 
after 4 in the afternoon that I received 
my first news of the revolution. I received 
it through a radio station in San Juan. 
Thus, from 1 in the afternoon of April 24, 
to this day, Wessin y Wessin's forces, which 
control the Dominican Air Force, have com-
pletely controlled the airways and the roads 
to the airport. 
Two Dominican Air Force planes came to 
Puerto Rico?the first a Mustang P-51 fighter 
which landed on Monday, April 26, I believe, 
In Mayaguez, and a Douglas transport which 
landed next day in San Juan. Both were 
grounded by U.S. military authorities and 
have remained grounded. 
I did try to reach my country. I made 
such efforts with Abe Fortes, the well-known 
American lawyer, who in the first days was 
unofficial liaison between the U.S. Govern-
ment, and Recto- Jaime Benites of the Uni-
versity of Puerto Rico. On Saturday, May 1, 
Mr. Fortas informed me that a battle was 
imminent between U.S. Marines and Domini-
can constitutionalist forces. I explained to 
Mr. Fortas that all I could do in these cir-
cumstances was to go to my country and 
I asked him for a plane to take me there 
immediately. Mr. Fortas did not reply. Early 
on May 2, in the presence of Rector Benites, 
I made the same request to Ambassador John 
Bartlow Martin and he refused even to con-
sider the matter, saying that if I went to 
Santo Domingo I would be killed. Accord-
ing to him, that should not be allowed to 
happen as it would leave my country with-
out leaders. 
During its initial phase, for 2 months, the 
minican revolution was confined to the 
apital of the Republic; as it entered its 
third month, the movement began to spread 
to the interior of the country. This was 
inevitable, since a revolution is not a uni-
fied military operation which can be con-
tained within set boundary lines by military 
forces. Washington has remained inex-
plicably unaware of what is really happen-
ing. 
In bottling up the revolution and keep-
ing it confined to a portion of the city of 
Santo Domingo, the United States Govern-
tient was appraising the situation in terms 
of force: The revolutionary element repre-
sents a given number of men with a given 
number of weapons; therefore, we can sub-
due them and knock them out with a given 
number of soldiers and a given amount of 
arms. 
It is easy to think in terms of force in 
this day and age, especially in the United 
States, where a battery of electronic com-
puters comes up with plausible answers to 
problems of this type in a few minutes, per-
haps even in a few seconds. 
A revolution, however, is an historical de-
velopment which is ill-adapted to this type 
of automated reasoning. Its force is de-
rived from the hearts and minds of people. 
Neither of these can be measured by elec-
tronic computers. 
The Santo Domingo uprising was?and 
is?a typical people's democratic revolution 
In the historic Latin American manner, gen-
erated by social, economic, and political fac-
tors at once Dominican and Latin American. 
It is like the Mexican revolution of 1910. 
The United States reacted to the Dominican 
revolution of 1965 almost exactly as it did to 
the Mexican revolution of 1910. Why? Be-
cause, traditionally, the official world of North 
America has been opposed to democratic 
revolutions in Latin America. With the ex-
ception of the Kennedy years, the policy has 
been to reach a meeting of minds with local 
power groups, and to use force to back them 
up. During the Franklin Roosevelt era the 
use of armed intervention was abandoned, 
but the policy of supporting local power 
groups was continued, and in the case of 
the Cuban revolution of 1933 North American 
warships made their appearance in Cuban 
waters as an ominous reminder. It was 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy who transformed 
outmoded concepts by putting new policies 
into practice; but after his demise the old

idea once more took hold that power can 
only be exerted by means of force. 
Yet this idea has been disproved by his-
tory. A revolution is not a war. Tradi-
tionally, the defeated ones in revolutions 
have been those who were stronger in weap-
onry. The 13 American colonies were weak-
er than England, yet they won the War of 
Independence; the French masses were 
weaker than Louis XVI's monarchy, yet the 
people won in the French Revolution; Boli-
var was weaker than Ferdinand VII, yet he 
won the South American revolution; Mad-
der? was Weaker than Porfirio Diaz, yet he 
triumphed in the Mexican revolution of 1910; 
Lenin was weaker than the Russian govern-
ment, yet he won the revolution of 1917 in 
Russia. Without a single exception, all the 
retolutions which have been victorious 
throughout the course of history have been 
weaker than the governments against which 
they were rebelling. It is clear, therefore, 
that revolutions cannot be measured in terms 
Of military power; other values must serve 
as their yardstick. 
To distinguish between a true revolution 
and a mere disorder or struggle for power 
among rival contenders, one must study the 
Underlying causes of the uprising, and the 
Stand taken by the various sectors of society 
as it developed. It must also be viewed in 
its historical context. The U.S. officials 
felled to consider any of these aspects of 
the Dominican revolution. In Washington, 
Word was received that at noone on Sat-
urday, April 24, there had been some rest-
lessness in certain quarters of Santo Domin-
go and among the people of the city; a little 
later it was learned that the commander-in-
chief of the Ariny had been taken prisoner 
by his subalterns. Immediately, plans to 
land U.S. Armed Forces in the little Carib-
bean country were contemplated. President 
Johnson himself so stated when, at a press 
conference on June 17, he affirmed that as 
a matter of fact, we landed our people in 
less than 1 hour from the time the decision 
was made. It was a decision we considered 
from Saturday until Wednesday evening." 
Since Saturday, therefore, the U.S. Gov-
ernment had considered it necessary to land 
troops in Santo Domingo; and we may be 
sure that at the time the U.S. Government 
did not know what kind of revolution was 
developing or was going to develop in the 
Dominican Republic. It was obvious that the 
policy of the North American government 
was to defend the status quo in Santo Do-
mingo, without any regard for the will of the 
Dominican people. The reaction in Wash-
ington was, therefore, the usual one: The 
controlling group in the Dominican Republic 
Was threatened, and had to be defended. 
This controlling group was pro-United 
States, without a doubt; but It was also 
anti-Dominican Republic, and this to an ex-
treme degree. During its 19 months of gov-
ernment, this preferred regime of Washing-
ton had ruined the Dominican economy, 
established a system of corruption and daily 
ridiculed the hopes of the people for a 
dramatic solution to the country's problems. 
The Dominican revolution of April 1965, 
was not an improvisation. It was an his-
torical event, the origin of which was clear 
to see. It had been developing since the end 
, of 1959, through the death of Trujillo in May 
1961, the elections of December 1962; and 
finally the strike of May 1964. The coup 
d'etat of September 1963, was unable to 
stamp out this revolution. It was a delusion 
of sociological and political ignoramuses that 
when the government over which I was pre-
siding 'had been overthrown, the revolution 
would be vanquished. It was a delusion to 
believe, as did those responsible for formulat-
ing Dominican policy in Washington, that 
a man of "good" social and business back-
ground was the kind of person to handle the 
Dominican situation. 
From the time of the 1963 coup cretat, the 
country was returned to the same lack of 
freedom and contempt toward the mass of 
the people which prevailed in the days of 
Trujillo. Corruption of the Trujillo type 
became more widespread and more shameless 
than under the tyrant himself. The Cabral 
regime sought a return to Trujilloism with-
out Trujillo, an historical absurdity which 
could not be continued. The middle classes 
and the masses came together as allies, united 
in a common cause, to restore the country to 
a regime of lawfulness. 
In April 1965, a second Cuba could not have 
been in the making in Santo Domingo. What 
erupted was?and is?a democratic and na-
tionalistic revolution. No Latin American 
nation today can accept a democracy which 
does not also offer social equality and eco-
nomic justice. It was a costly political 
blunder to look on it as a revolution which 
was in danger of drifting toward commu-
nism. 
The United States will pay a high price 
for this blunder and, in my opinion, it will 
be paid within our time. A measure of the 
grossness of the mistake is the size of the 
forces originally deployed to bottle up the 
revolution. In April, the United States had 
23,000 men in Vietnam; it landed 42,000 in 
Santo Domingo. Washington officials looked 
upon events in the Dominican Republic as 
so fraught with danger that their prepara-
tions seemed like those of a nation waging 
a life-and-death war. A tiny, impoverished 
nation, making the most heroic effort of its 
history to achieve democracy, was over-
whelmed by huge quantities of cannons, 
planes, warships, and by a propaganda cam-
paign which presented completely distorted 
facts to the world. The revolution did not 
shoot a single person; it decapitated no one, 
burned down not a single church, nor raped 
one woman. Nevertheless, allegations of 
these horrors were proclaimed to the world 
at large. 
The Dominican revolution had nothing to 
do with Cuba, or Russia, or China. It would 
have ended in April had the United States 
not intervened. Instead, it was bottled up 
and consequently began to generate a force 
of its own, alien to its nature, and including 
hatred of the United States. It will be a 
long time before this anti-U.S. feeling dis-
appears. When democratic nationalism is 
thwarted or strangled, it becomes a breeding 
ground for communism. I am certain that 
the use of force by the United States in the 
Dominican Republic will produce more Com-
munists in Santo Domingo and in Latin 
America than all the propaganda of Russia, 
China, and Cuba combined. 
It will be difficult to convince the Domini-
cans that democracy is the best system of 
government. They were paying for their de-
mocracy with their lives and with their blood, 
yet North American democracy represented 
their tremendous and heroic struggle to the 
world as a work of bandits and Communists. 
Force was used to prevent the Domini-
cans from achieving their democracy. Many 
Americans may not believe this is true, but I 
am expressing here what the people of the 
Dominican Republic feel and will continue 
to feel for many years to come, rather than 
trying to describe what the intentions of 
the United States were. 
The United States was obliged to have 
recourse in Santo Domingo to an expedient 
which would permit it to use force without 
exposing itself to world opprobrium. This 
explains the military junta headed by An-
tonio Imbert. This junta was the brainchild 
of Ambassador John Bartlow Martin?of the 
United States, in other words. Rarely in 
modern history has so costly an error been 
committed in terms of U.S. prestige as 
placing in the hands of Imbert the power of 
armed Dominican troops, then advancing as 
an excuse for his crimes the argument of 
fighting communism in Santo Domingo. The 
brutal killings of Dominicans and for-
eigners?including a Cuban priest, and a 
Canadian priest?which were committed by 
Imbert's trdops on the pretext of wiping out 
communism will, in Dominican history, be 
forever laid to the account of the United 
States, and particularly to Ambassador 
Martin. These killings occurred while North 
American forces were in Santo Domingo; 
moreover, Ambassador Martin knew what 
kind of man Imbert was before inviting him 
to /cad the junta. Imbert's tyranny_ was 
established beyond a doubt, and following 
as he did on the heels of Trujillo, there was 
no pretext strong enough to justify setting 
up the tyranny of Imbert. 
Under the revolution, no one was shot or 
decapitated; but Imbert's forces shot and 
decapitated hundreds of persons. These 
crimes were not given the publicity they 
should have had in the United States, but 
they are cited in the documentation of the 
Commission on Human Rights of the 
Organization of American States and of the 
United Nations, with all their ghastly de-
tails of skulls crushed by gun butts, of 
hands lashed behind backs with wire, of 
headless corpses floating in rivers, of women 
executed by machine guns, of fingers smashed 
with hammers to prevent identification of 
the dead. Most of the victims were mem-
bers of the Dominican Revolutionary Party 
(a party recognized as democratic), since the 
function of Imbert's "democracy" is to wipe 
out all democrats in the Dominican Republic. 
It is a bloody irony Of history that the crimes 
Imputed to the Dominican revolution were 
actually committed by Imbert. The blame 
will also fall on the United States and, un-
fortunately, upon democracy in general as a 
system of government. If I know my people, 
when the day of reckoning comes, it will be 
hard for the Dominicans of today and of 
tomorrow to be indulgent toward the United 
States and harsh only in their judgment of 
Imbert and his soldiers. 
The Dominican people will not soon forget 
that the United States brought into Santo 
Domingo the Nicaraguan battalion named 
for Anastasio Somoza, that Central American 
emulator of Trujillo; that it brought in 
Stroessner's Paraguayan soldiers, of all ele-
ments those least qualified to represent 
democracy in a land where thousands of 
men and women had just died fighting to 
establish democracy; that it brought in the 
soldiery of Lopez Arellano who, so far as the 
Dominicans are concerned, is a sort of Hon-
duran Wessin y Wessin. A highlight in all 
future history texts of the Dominican Re-
public will be the bombardment of the city 
of Santo Domingo for 24 hours on June 15 
and 16. 
All these flow from the use of force as an 
instrument of 'power in the handling of 
political problems. An intelligent evalua-
tion of the events in Santo Domingo would 
have prevented them. President Johnson 
said that his Marines went into Santo Do-
mingo to save lives; what they really did was 
to destroy the democratic image of the 
United States throughout the South Ameri-
can continent.

COVER 
(By Tad Szulc) 
This spring the United States became en-
gaged in one of the most hectic, bizarre and 
controversial diplomatic and military opera-
tions in recent history, highlighted by the 
landing of 22,000 troops in the Dominican 
Republic to protect American lives and to 
prevent what the Johnson administration 
feared might be "another Cuba" in the 
Caribbean.

WKD ? SkNATE  July 29, 1965 
By late June, after the United States had 
bounced back and forth several times be-
tween contradictory policies, at commission 
from the Organization of American States--
heavily influenced by its American member, 
white - haired, professional diplomatic 
troubleshooter Ellsworth Bunker?finally 
came up with the compromise proposals de-
signed to satisfy two sides in the civil war. 
But looking back at the massive bloodshed 
and wild confusion of that savage Dominican 
spring, one finds it hard not to wonder why 
the same ideas could not have been advanced 
at the outset of the crisis, or shortly there-
after. 
The story of the Dominican intervention 
would have been merely a comedy of errors 
and inconsistencies, a mixture of Hamlet and 
the Marx Brothers, if it were not for the 
thousands of Dominican dead and wounded 
In the 8-week civil war and for the deep in-
volvement of American prestige. 
The direct cost to the United States was 
some 25 lost lives of marines and para-
troopers, over 100 casualties and many hun-
dred of millions of dollars. It is impossible 
to estimate the cost to America in lost con-
fidence among people throughout the world 
who regarded the episode?rightly or 
wrongly?as an imperialist military move by 
the United States. The Dominican crisis 
created sharp divisions within the Adminis-
tration in Washington. How the Govern-
ment handled that crisis?with apparent 
confusion at the local embassy, at the State 
Department and in the Central Intelligence 
Agency?deserves close scrutiny, for Ameri-
can embassies are everywhere much the same, 
and similar problems may erupt anywhere 
at any time. The Dominican experience is 
not the sort that it would be beneficial to 
undergo more than once. 
A good part of the reason for this drawn-
out torture of the ancient city of Santo 
Domingo and its 460,000 inhabitants, if not 
the, whole reason, seems to lie in the nature 
of the initial reporting on the Dominican 
crisis to the administration in Washington 
by the U.S. Embassy in the Dominican capital. 
This frequently overemotional, exaggerated 
and partisan reporting went far to influence 
decfeionmaking at the State Department and 
the White House, thus becoming the prime 
cause of most of the subsequent events. 
Later, the embassy's recommendations played 
a part in undermining, in effect, the peace-
making efforts of special White House envoys 
on the scene. 
For this reason, much of What happened 
111 the Dominican Republic is essentially the 
story of the American 'Embassy in Santo 
Domingo, the people in it and its "special 
guests" from Washington. It is the tale of 
au embassy that was at first caught unawares 
by events and then seemed panicked by 
them, and of otherwise competent diplomats 
who allowed themselves to lose contact with 
the real facts of the situation and then made 
it a policy to ignore them. No definite re-
port can be provided on Washington's role, 
but it is plain that during the initial period 
no effective brake on the wild procession of 
events was applied by the State Department, 
which seems to have let itself be stampeded 
by reports from the field. 
In this atmosphere of unreality and in-
trigue there inevitably arose episodes that 
served almost as comic relief in the impos-
sibly tense and chaotic situation. There was 
the picture of American Ambassador W. 
Tapley Bennet, Jr., sitting under his desk 
throughout a strafing by friendly planes and 
the scene in which a White House emissary 
climbed through a window for a secret meet-
ing, with the rebel chiefs. 
And, as the constant counterpart to the 
political and diplomatic maneuverings, there 
were the sounds and the smells of the civil 
war. From the moment that I landed in 
Santo Domingo on Thursday, April 29?hav-
ing been ferried by a marine helicopter from 
the U.S.S. Boxer along with other reporters?
I lived for 5 weeks with the barking of ma-
chin.e guns, the thud of mortars and the 
sudden dry crackling of snipers' rifles. There 
was the sweet, sickening smell of death in 
the overcrowded hospitals and the pungent 
odor of decay in a city which for weeks had 
no water and no garbage collection; and 
there was the quiet heroism of American 
Peace Corps nurses working under fire in the 
hospitals, the taut discipline of marines 
holding fire until the last possible moment. 
But for the sake of coherency, this complex 
story of the U.S. involvement in the Domin-
ican Republic must be told chronologically. 
It began with the revolt in Santo Domingo 
on Saturday, April 24, by a group of civilians 
and young military officers, who set out to 
overthrow the provisional government of 
Donald Reid Cabral and to bring back de-
posed President Juan Bosch. 
But it is really necessary to go back even 
further, for the recent history of the Domin-
ican Republic is a confused mesh of tawdry 
events. The country was for 31 years the 
personal fief of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo 
Molinas, an iron-fisted dictator whose rule 
ended with his assassination on a lonely 
Santo Domingo boulevard in May, 1961. 
After seven confused months, a Council of 
State was installed with U.S. support and 
with the intention of preparing democratic 
elections. Some council members subse-
quently lost interest in holding elections, 
and it was largely through the efforts of 
Donald Reid Cabral, a slim but wiry automo-
bile dealer, that the elections took place in 
December 1962. But "Donnie" Reid was 
surprised by the victory of Dr. Juan Bosch, 
an idealistic writer, social reformer and self-
taught political scientist who had lived in 
exile for 24 years. Reid refused to partici-
pate in the Bosch government and instead 
alined himself with the rightwing opposi-
tion. 
On September 25, 1963, Dr. Bosch, the Re-
public's first freely chosen President in 38 
years, was deposed by a military coup. The 
Trujilloist generals and colonels who over-
threw Bosch explained their move as a nec-
essary counter to the President's alleged?
but never proved?Communist proclivities. 
Reid Cabral became Foreign Minister under 
a new triumvirate--in a government un-
recognized by the United States, for Presi-
dent Kennedy angrily broke .diplomaticre-
lations after the coup and withdrew all aid. 
The Johnson administration reestablished 
the relationship 3 months later, and not long 
thereafter Reid was elevated to the top post 
in the trilunvirate. Reid became known in 
Santo Domingo ad"el Americana" so closely 
was he linked with U.S. interests. 
Reid Cabral meant well, but somehow he 
never impressed his fellow Dominicans who 
became increasingly impatient for the de-
mocracy, jobs, and bread that had been 
promised since Trujillo's death. His rule, 
though authoritarian, was not dictatorial as 
Dominicans knew dictatorship, and he even 
tried to put a rein on the armed forces. 
This helped seal his fate. Resentment 
among old-line military, wistfully remem-
bering the easy Trujillo days, converged with 
active plotting by young .officers who were 
weary of the triumvirate and wanted democ-
racy reinstituted under President Bosch. 
It was the "young Turks" group that set off 
the crisis. The conspiracy of these officers 
and of civilians from Bosch's Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (P.R.D.)?mainly mid-
dle-class persons?began last September. 
The target date was June 1, but the capital 
grapevine became active in March with 
rumors that a coup was in the works. 
After Easter Sunday, April 18, the coup 
rumors grew more persistent. A few days 
later, Santo Domingo's newspaper El Caribe 
published a front-page story reporting un-
usual military movement around the presi-
dential palace. And finally on Thursday, 
April 22, Donnie Reid himself heard enough 
details of the plot to fire seven air force 
officers involved in it. This move shocked 
the conspirators into acting. 
Rebel civilians suddenly captured the city's 
main radio and television station in the early 
afternoon of Saturday, April 24, and an-
nounced?prematurely?the government's 
fall. Two army camps on the outskirts of 
town declared themselves in rebellion. 
Crowds poured into the downtown streets to 
celebrate what they thought had already be-
come a victorious revolution, but loyalist 
forces soon recaptured the radio station and 
arrested eight rebels there. Although the 
rebels at the two army camps ignored a 5 
p.m. ultimatum to surrender, Reid Cabral 
broadcast that evening an announcement 
that the uprising had been stamped out. 
The American Embassy, which had been 
completely surprised by the original revolt, 
dutifully passed on to the State Department 
the announcement that the revolt was now 
over, along with its own conclusion that, in-
deed, Donnie Reid had weathered the storm. 
A possible explanation for the Embassy's 
failure to properly assess what was happen-
ing may be found in the absence of Ambas-
sador Tapley Bennett, who had left Santo 
Domingo on Friday, April 23, the day before 
the rebels made their move. Mr. Bennett 
later explained that he had expected trouble, 
and for precisely that reason had gone to 
Washington, feeling that it was his last 
opportunity to discuss the Dominican prob-
lem before trouble came. However, on 
Thursday Bennett had sent his regular 
weekly report to the State Department, and 
in it he mentioned new talk in Santo Do-
mingo that some generals might try to oust 
Reid during the weekend. But, Bennett 
noted, this seemed to be one of those "usual 
Santo Domingo rumors." 
From Santo Domingo the Ambassador went 
to Georgia to visit his mother. It was there 
that he first heard of the Saturday revolt, 
and only the next day did he go to Washing-
ton, where the initial plans for a large-scale 
U.S. intervention were already being consid-
ered?partly on the basis of increasingly 
nervous reports from Santo Domingo that 
leftists and Communists were dominating 
what was supposed to be a pro-Bosch move-
ment. - 
Also absent from Santo Domingo that cru-
cial weekend were 11 of the 13 officers at-
tached to the U.S. military assistance advis-
ory group, whose job it was to train Do-
minican troops and be in touch with their 
leaders; they were in Panama attending a 
routine conference. The Embassy's naval 
attache had left Friday for a weekend of 
dove shooting in the Cibao Valley with Brig. 
Gen. Antonio Imbert Barreras, one of the 
two survivors of the group that ambushed 
Trujillo in 1961?and a man who was to play 
a vital role in the days ahead. The senior 
American present in Santo Domingo was 
Bennett's deputy, William Connett, a thin, 
bespectacled diplomat who had arrived 15 
months before. At 46, he had served in four 
Latin American posts during his 14 years in 
the Foreign Service. 
In Washington it was a quiet spring week-
end. Secretary of State Dean Rusk on Sat-
urday made a statement about U.S. policy on 
Cambodia. President Johnson's top Latin 
American adviser, Thomas Mann, was re-
laxing at home. And Jack Hood Vaughn, 
who only a few weeks earlier had succeeded 
Mann as Assistant Secretary of State for In-
ter-American Affairs when Mann was elevated 
to the post of Under Secretary, was attending 
,a conference in Cuernavaca, Mexico. As far 
as anyone in the administration seemingly 
could determine, this was one of the quietest 
periods that Latin American politics had 
undergone in a long time. 
By any standards Tap Bennett's Embassy 
was a good Embassy, staffed by about 30 
Foreign Service officers. All were career men 
with good records, and most had Latin

proved For Rel5miaggi114A4f; iiftim97_3(wacw000190008-1 
American experience. Its only visible weak-
ness was that all ranking officers, including 
Bennett, had served there for a relatively, 
short time. This was because 'diplomatic re-
lations with the Dominican Republic were 
restored only late in 1963, and a whole new 
team was assigned there with' the new Am-
bassador. Bennett, serving in his first am-
bassadorial post, had been in 'Santo Do-
mingo 13 months, as had the chief of the 
Embassy's political section. Only the CIA 
contingent, operating out of the political 
section as an independent unit, had been 
' in the Dominican Republic longer. 
Bennett was the classic State Department 
career ambassador?with all that this im-
plies in advantages and drawbacks. At the 
age ,of 48, his ambassadorial appointment 
to Santo Domingo climaxed 24 years of a 
Foreign Service career that had not been 
spectacular, but, in State Department par-
lance, had been a good one. A tall, amiable 
man from an established Georgia family, 
Tap Bennett graduated from the University 
of Georgia, then spent a year at the Univer-
sity of Freiburg in Nazi Germany between 
1937 and 1938 before obtaining his law degree 
from George Washington University. His 
first Foreign Service post was, interestingly 
enough, in the Dominican Republic. After-
ward lie specialized in Caribbean and Cen-
tral American affairs, becoming in 1951 the 
Deputy Director of the State Department's 
Office of South American Affairs. 
This backlog of experience made Tap Ben-
nett a Latin American old hand, and in 
1953 he was picked as personal assistant to 
Dr. Milton Eisenhower, who then was suf.. 
veying hemispheric problems on his brother's 
behalf. Doctor Eisenhower described Ben-
nett as "an engaging, sensitive, tireless work-
er." Married to the daughter of a well-
known former ambassador, Bennett carried 
a pleasant social cachet, and in time he 
was sent on pleasant assignments to Vienna 
and Athens. 
After his arrival in Santo Domingo last 
year, the new ambassador established close 
and cordial relations with President Reid 
Cabral and with businessmen, landowners 
and military officers who supported the 
regime. While this was entirely proper, the 
ambassador and his top associates seemingly 
maintained few contacts or friendships with 
the followers of Doctor Bosch, other opposi-
tion politicians or any of the young officers. 
As a high administration official in Wash-
ington said later, wondering aloud about the 
ambassador's selectiveness in his contacts, 
"Tap didn't seem to know anyone who was 
to the left of the Rotary Club." 
? Bennett was conscientious in carrying out 
his ambassadorial functions, and he traveled 
almost everywhere in the Dominican Repub-
. lic, dutifully 'visiting aid projects and Peace 
Corps centers. But, as one of his embassy 
associates once remarked, "Tap seemed ill 
at ease with people who were not well dressed 
and to whom he had not been properly in-
troduced." When the revolt broke out, Ben-
nett almost reflexively gave his full commit-
ment to people whom he knew. And he sub-
sequently found himself in a maelstrom set 
in motion by men he had never met and by - 
powerful forces that he had never discovered. 
After reporting Saturday night that the 
rebellion seemed to have fizzled out, Ben-
nett's deputy, Bill Connett?whose views ap-
parently coincided largely with the ambassa-
dor's?found out Sunday morning that the 
situation had changed?although quite un-
draraaticaliy. Not only had the government's 
planes and tanks refused to attack the two 
yebellious, army garrisons, but the old-line 
commanders had apparently decided to finish 
off in their own way what the young officers 
had started the day before. By Sunday 
morning Reid Cabral's term in office had 
ended?an the military leaders, rebels as 
well as loyalists, agreed on that. Donnie 
Reid signed his resignation onthe under-
standing that a junta would be formed and 
that elections would be held soon. 
Then developments became more confused. 
The young military officers who hoped to 
bring Doctor Bosch back to power refused to 
go along with t14 junta plan. Instead they 
and their followers moved into the presi-
dential palace, announcing that they were 
establishing a provisional regime until Doc-
tor Bosch could return from exile in nearby 
Puerto Rico. Because most of the troops 
under command of officers favorable to the 
Junta were across the Ozarna River at San 
Isidro Air Force Base, the pro-Bosch officers 
momentarily had the upper hand. They im-
mediately swore in as provisional president 
a mild-mannered P.R.D. politican named 
Jose Rafael Molina Ureria, who had been 
president of the Dominican Chamber of De-
puties which became extinct at the time that 
the military overthrew Bosch in the 1963 
coup. Under the 1963 constitution, sus-
pended at the same time, Molina Ureria was 
next in line for the presidency in the absence 
of the vice president and the president of 
the senate, both of whom were in exile. Be-
cause Bosch's supporters regarded the 1963 
coup as Illegal, they claimed that the con-
stitution was still in effect and that Molina 
Urefia was the rightful provisional president. 
The rebels' characterization of their move-
ment as "constitutionalist" proceeds from 
this interpretation. 
The installation of Molina Urefia that 
sunny Sunday marked the real beginning of 
the Dominican civil war. The other military 
commanders who had helped to dismiss Reid 
Cabral a few hours earlier now felt betrayed. 
And the most indignant among them was 
Brig. Gen. Elias Wessin y Wessin, the officer 
who had himself led the coup against Doctor 
Bosch 19 months before and who was not 
now prepared to see him brought back to 
power. General Wessin had the allegiance 
of the officers of the aviation infantry and 
armored brigade, as well as of most of the 
air force. Wessin's troops?who at peak 
strength numbered aliout 2,500 combat sol-
diers?were the elite of the Dominican armed 
forces, and now they were poised to smash 
the rebels. 
Early Sunday afternoon two of General 
Wessin's P-51 fighters came out of the sun 
over the sea beyond George Washington Bou-
levard and strafed the sprawling yellow pal-
ace. A Gloster Meteor jet followed in a 
screaming dive, hurling rockets. Across the 
Ozama River Wessin's tanks rumbled toward 
the bridge leading into town. Simultane-
ously the San Isidro radio station broadcast 
that the pro-Bosch rebels were Communist-
dominated. 
Although Doctor Bosch had formerly been 
one of Fidel Castro's favorite targets as a 
"Yankee puppet," the American Embassy ap-
parentlY concurred in General Wessin's as-
sessment of the revolt. In one of his earliest 
cables to Washington, Connett acting as 
charg?'affaires in Bennett's absence, 
warned that Doctor Bosch's return would 
mean extremism in the Dominican Republic 
within 6 months?by which he presumably 
meant communism and, therefore, "another 
Cuba" in the Caribbean. 
The rebels had by now ofiened the arsenals 
at the two army camps they controlled and 
at the few downtown ,police stations they had 
captured. A truck loaded with guns pulled 
up at the tree-shaded Perque Independencia. 
Men, women, and teenagers?Communists 
and non-Communists alike?were allowed to 
help themselves to anything they wanted. 
Suddenly the city turned into an armed 
'camp. Connett cabled Washington that 
there were armed leftists on street corners. 
Tere were unquestionably Communists and 
pro-Castro elements in the revolution from 
the outset, but there seems to have been no 
'basis for the embassy's warnings that ex-
tremists were about to capture the move-
ment. The leaders at this early point were 
18133 
Career army officers and Molina Ureria?none 
of whom are regarded as Communists. 
In Santo Domingo, at 5:45 p.m. on Sun-
day, a delegation of top officials of Bosch's 
party went to the embassy to ask that the 
United States use its influence to halt the 
Wessin air attacks. The group included Sil-
vestre Antonio Guzman, a wealthy planter 
and former minister of agriculture in the 
Bosch cabinet, who was to emerge a few 
weeks later at the administration candidate 
to end the Dominican civil war. ( 
The charge, Bill Connett, did not see them. 
Instead they were received by the embassy's 
second secretary, Arthur E. Breisky, who, ac-
cording to Guzman's subsequent account, 
called the rebels irresponsible and said 
they were Communist-dominated. When 
one of the visitors heatedly denied any Com-
munist link, Breisky reportedly responded 
that "now you ask for U.S. help after having 
sent your people in the streets. If I had 
Wessin's power I would use it." 
We,ssin. did. On Monday his tanks con-
tinued their assault upon the Duarte Bridge, 
where they were resisted for hours in what 
was virtually hand-to-hand combat. Occa-
sionally a Wessin tank succeeded in reaching 
the city end of the bridge, but then rebel 
bazooka and machinegun fire turned it back. 
Near the bridge rebel soldiers and civilians. 
some of them teenagers, crouched behind 
barricades among exploding missiles. By 
now automatic weapons were being handed 
out to anyone who asked for them. Aircraft 
bombed the city, where armed bands?not 
necessarily connected with any political 
movement?fired at anything that moved. 
There was soon a complete breakdown of 
order, and the city had no government. Pres-
ently, serious fears developed for the safety 
of the 2,500 Americans living in Santo Do-
mingo. Embassy officials monitoring the 
rebel-controlled radio and television began 
to discover a leftist-revolutionary accent 
creeping into the programs. The rebel an-
nouncers began broadcasting the names and 
addresses of "enemies of the revolution," an 
apparent invitation to violence. Though no 
anti-American incident had occurred, the 
embassy feared this as a predictable next 
step in the chaotic situation. Late on Mon-
day the embassy recommended that the 'U.S. 
Navy, which had a task force standing off-
shore, immediately evacuate those Americans 
who wished to leave. Nobody in Santo Do-
mingo, on any side, questioned the wisdom of 
this decision. 
Because logical analysis cannot prove a 
negative argument?e.g., there are no snakes 
in Manhattan?there is no way of estab-
lishing that the pro-Bosch revolution would 
not have become dominated by the Commu-
nists. They are, however, a small minority in 
the Dominican Republic. And many for-
eign diplomats in the capital?even some 
officials at the Embassy?point out that the 
United States, while fearing a Communist 
takeover, did nothing in the revolt's early 
days to encourage democratic elements 
among the rebels. Instead the Embassy be-
came increasingly identified with the Wessin 
forces, even though the San Isidro general 
personified, to a great many Dominicans, the 
threat of a new dictatorship. 
Returning to Santo Domingo from Wash-
ington on Tuesday, April 27, Tap Bennett 
immediately passed to Washington, along 
with his own endorsement, the Wessin com-
mand's urgent request for radio equipment. 
The Wessin forces had still not managed to 
break into Santo Domingo, and the San 
Isidro leaders pleaded for U.S. walkie-talkies 
and other radio equipment to help provide 
tactical control of their tanks and aircraft. 
Even before Bennett returned to his post, 
the administration in Washington was?quite 
properly, in a situation of such extreme un-
certainty?already actively considering both 
a landing of marines, to protect the evacua-
tion of Americans, and a large-stale military

Intervention. Intervention was planned to 
fend off what the Embassy had represented 
to Washington as the imminent danger of a 
Communist takeover. (The Embassy warn-
ings, however, were still couched in general-
ities, and none of the alleged Communist 
leaders in the rebel command had been posi-
tively identified.) At 4 o'clock on Tuesday, 
therefore?before the Navy began evacuating 
the first Americans from Santo Domingo?
the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., 
Was placed on alert. Briefing his officers, 
division commander Maj. Gen, Robert York 
said the mission would be a parachute as-
sault to secure San Isidro, the highway lead-
ing to the Ozaina River and the Duarte 
Bridge. 
On Tuesday afternoon the military pic-
ture in Santo Domingo shifted?the Wessin 
troops appeared to be gaining the upper 
hand. The tiny Dominican Navy, which had 
until then remained neutral, suddently went 
to the side of the San Isidro generals, and its 
frigates lobbed a few shells at the rebel-held 
presidential palace. Then a new act in the 
Dominican drama?and in the Embassy's 
drama?began. A group of rebel military 
commanders suddenly appeared at the Em-
bassy and requested an interview with Am-
bassador Bennett. After checking their 
weapons at the door, they were ushered into 
the ambassadorial office. They were told the 
Ambassador that it was now necessary to end 
the bloodshed, and they asked him to mediate 
In negotiations with General Wessin. 
Tap Bennett replied that he had no au-
thority to mediate. But he said that because 
he was in contact with San Isidro, he would 
be glad to transmit messages there. Some of 
the officers, apparently believing their own 
entreaties lacked sufficient force, then sug-
gested that the Embassy help persuade Acting 
President Molina Urefia that the time had 
come to seek a truce. Bennett assented. He 
instructed Benjamin J. Ruyle, head of the 
political section, to drive to the palace and 
deliver the message to the Acting President 
from his military associates. 
Ruyle found the sprawling palace deserted. 
There were broken windows everywhere. 
Bits of masonry lay strewn around where 
rockets and machinegun bullets had hit. 
Walking through the building, Ruyle finally 
came upon a room off the main corridor 
where Molina Urefia sat dejected in a stuffed 
armchair. He was surrounded by a number 
of rebels, some in uniform and some in ci-
vilian clothes. At first the Acting President 
refused to consider giving up the fight, but 
his companions persuaded him to give it 
some thought. Ruyle left him and drove 
back to the embassy. 
An hour later Molina Urefia and 18 rebel 
officers arrived at the white stucco, one-
story embassy. This time the group included 
Lt. Col. Francisco Caamafio Defid., one of the 
top rebel leaders and a 32-year-old graduate 
of a Florida high school and of U.S. Marine 
Corps schools. Again Tap Bennett was asked 
to mediate, and again he refused?but there 
are two contradictory versions of what hap-
pened. Colonel Caamafio insists that the 
ambassador told the group that "this is the 
time to surrender and not to negotiate." 
This, the colonel said later, was an insult 
to the rebel's honor. 
Bennett denies that he either demanded 
a surrender or intended to insult anyone. 
However, Colonel Caarnafio's?and most 
other rebels'?personal abhorrence of the 
ambassador is associated with this incident. 
But on one point both sides agree: When 
the conference finally broke up, Colonel Caa-
mafio turned to Tap Bennett, just before 
leaving his office, and said, We shall go on 
fighting." (The ambassador did not report 
this remark in his cable to the State Depart-
ment that night, nor had there been any 
mention of Caamafio in embassy messages 
during the first 4 days of the rebellion.) 
The rebels left the embassy one by one, 
some hanging back as if they were reluctant 
to leave. Finally Molina tfrefia decided that 
his side had lost and drove to the Colombian 
Embassy to request aSylum. As far as the 
U.S. Embassy was concerned, the pro-Bosch 
rebellion had collapsed. An army battalion 
from out of town, uncommitted to either 
side until then, entered the city from the 
west and marched on the palace. In the 
east, General Wessin's tanks were smashing 
their way into Santo Domingo over the 
Duarte Bridge against heavy resistance. The 
U.S. Navy evacuation of the first 1,175 Amer-
icans had been safely completed. There had 
been an early incident at the Hotel Embaja-
dor, where evacuees had congregated, when 
rebels lined terrified people up against a wall 
in the lobby and fired a submachinegun 
burst overhead. But nobody was hurt. In 
Washington, administration officials ex-
pressed relief that the revolt had collapsed. 
But to everybody's surprise?the embassy's 
second major surprise in 5 days?the rebels 
not only did not give up but they found a 
second breath. Colonel Caamafio, whose 
promise to fight had been ignored by Tap 
Bennett the evening before, took command 
of the rebellion and eventually mustered 
perhaps 3,000 supporters?although he later 
claimed to command 10,000 armed rebels. 
Caamafio became the rebel leader almost 
by accident, after many of his fellow plotters 
had vanished into diplomatic asylum. A 
somewhat paunchy man of unpredictable 
mood, he has none of the magnetism of a 
typical revolutionary leader such as, say, 
Fidel Castro. If he has any political, eco-
nomic, or social ideas, beyond his proclaimed 
support for democracy, he has failed to 
make them clear. He alternates between 
rages, when he swears to die alongside his 
men to preserve their honor, and a kind of 
gay insouciance that he displayed recently 
at an improbable crepes suzette luncheon 
at one of his hideouts. He could scarcely 
be regarded as anything more than a transi-
tional leader. 
By Wednesday morning, in any case, Caa-
mario's rebels had barricaded themselves 
into an area of narrow streets and ancient 
houses in old Santo Domingo. They placed 
machineguns on the roofs and posted snipers 
at windows. Molotov cocktails were stored 
In houses, many of which became small 
fortresses. Captured tanks and trucks, with 
the painted word Pueblo [People] fanned 
out into the city. 
Now both the Wessin command and the 
United States had to respond to a renewed 
rebel threat. The Embassy decided that in-
tervention was necessary, but a legalism had 
to be satisfied: Someone had to request U.S. 
military help. Accordingly in mid-morning 
a three-man junta was established at San 
Isidro with Embassy guidance. Because Gen-
eral Wessin was so objectionable to many 
Dominicans, an unknown air force officer, 
Col. Pedro Bartolona6 Benoit, was named head 
of the junta. 
Colonel Benoit immediately appealed to 
Tap Bennett for help. At 1:48 p.m., on 
Wednesday the Ambassador cabled Washing-
ton that the junta's communications prob-
lem?the lack pf radio equipment?was 
critical. He cabled that the military was 
facing leftist forces and raised a question 
about the effect on the morale of the air 
force and the others if the United States 
denied them aid. 
Shortly after lunch Colonel Benoit radioed 
the Ambassador from San Isidro that the 
recently formed junta could no longer as-
sure order in Santo Domingo or protect for-
eign lives. He asked for U.S. intervention. 
Tap Bennett passed this request to Wash-
ington, then drafted another message which 
explained that he regretted that the United 
States might have to impose a military solu-
tion to a political problem. While leftist 
propaganda could be expected to character-
ize the revolt as a fight between the military 
and the people, Bennett said, the issue really 
was between those who wanted a Castro-
type solution and those who opposed it. He 
went on to make clear that while he did not 
want to overdramatize the situation, he be-
lieved that if the United States denied the 
requested communications equipment and if 
the opposition to those he called leftists lost 
heart, the United States might be required 
in the near future to stage a Marine land-
ing. What, he asked, did Washington prefer? 
Messages whipped frantically between 
Washington and Santo Domingo that after-
noon, and the State Department replied that 
the United States would not intervene mili-
tarily unless the outcome was in doubt--
but that the walkie-talkies were being got 
ready. 
At that point the administration was 
nearing the decision to land a contingent 
of marines whose mission would be the pro-
teetion of the continuing evacuation of 
Americans. About 2 p.m. a group of Marine 
Corps "pathfinders" came ashore at the sugar 
port of Haina, 7 miles west of the capital, 
to survey the beach for an amphibious land-
ing. 
At this point the United States identified 
hree men among the Rebel leadership as 
aving possible Communist ties. None of 
them were the visible top leaders. The 
identification was sent by the CIA from 
Santo Domingo Wednesday morning, and 
Vice Adm. Willian F. Raborn, Jr., retired, who 
had been sworn in as CIA Director at 12:30 
p.m. that same day, brought this information 
to President Johnson. 
Shortly before 5 p.m., Santo Domingo time, 
Tap Bennett received from Colonel Benoit 
a written note confirming the earlier radioed 
request for "a temporary intervention." Ben-
nett telephoned the White House and talked 
to the President. Then he sent his "emer-
gent" message, the highest..-priority commu-
nication in the U.S. Government, recom-
mending that the junta intervention request 
be honored. Within minutes the first heli-
copters took off from the deck of the Boxer 
to ferry marines to the Hotel Embajador. 
The "limited intervention" had begun. 
For the first time since 1916, U.S. troops 
had set foot in the Dominican Republic. In 
his televised announcement that night, Pres-
ident Johnson emphasized that the marines 
had gone ashore in Santo Domingo to assist 
in the evacuation of Americans and other 
foreigners. Nothing was said of a feared 
Communist takeover or of U.S. help to the 
junta forces. 
While the original landing by the marines 
on April 28 brought no more than 500 U.S. 
troops to Santo Domingo, the administra-
tion almost immediately moved toward a 
major buildup. By the end of the first week, 
there were 5,000 marines and paratroopers 
ashore. During the May Day weekend, the 
forces were more than doubled to 12,000. 
At the end of the second week, on May 8, 
the peak was reached with 22,000 U.S. troops 
in the Dominican Republic and 8,000 sailors 
manning 40 ships offshore. The U.S. mili-
tary spokesmen were never entirely precise 
about the need for such a large force. But 
State Department officials, briefing newsmen 
in Santo Domingo, gradually escalated the 
nature of the U.S. purpose in the Dominican 
Republic from the initially declared evacua-
tion mission to one of assisting Dominicans 
"to find a democratic solution to their poli-
tical problems." 
When the landings began on Wednesday, 
however, the first marine contingent soon 
secured its perimeters. At '7:30 p.m., after 
a marine platoon had been driven over to the 
Embassy, Bennett sent a telegram marked for 
Under Secretary Mann. Snipers had been 
firing at the Embassy building from across 
the street, and the marines shot seven of

them. Tap Bennett's cable told Maim that 
U.S. lives were in danger and conveyed an 
oral message from Colonel Benoit that the 
situation was deteriorating rapidly. He 
cabled his hope for an urgent reply to his 
official request for assistance to the Wessin 
forces. 
Thirty minutes later the Ambassador sent 
off yet another telegram to Washington. It 
said that the junta forces were incapable of 
resisting and added Bennett's recommenda-
tion that serious thought be given to armed 
intervention to restore order, beyond the 
mere protection of lives. If the loyalist 
efforts failed, he said, power would go to 
groups' whose aims were identical with those 
of the Communist Party. The United States 
might have to intervene in force to prevent 
another Cuba. 
In Washington, a stunned Council of the 
Organization of American States was in-
formed of the U.S. landing. The Latin 
American ambassadors were told that the 
marines went ashore to protect lives of for-
eign residents and that the administration 
had had no time to consult beforehand with 
Other governments, Several ambassadors 
protested that the U.S. action violated the 
OAS Charter, which bans unilteral interven-
tion. But, again, they were assured that the 
United States desired only a cease-fire. 
But in Santo Domingo events were pro-
ceeding on a somewhat different basis. News-
men preparing to land behind the marines 
from the Navy's amphibious task force hap-
pened to turn on their transistor radios and, 
quite accidentally, tuned in radio exchanges 
between Tap Bennett and Colonel Benoit, 
chief of the newly formed junta. 
One message, at 9:25 on Thursday morning 
said: "This is Shade Tree 1 [the Embassy's 
radio call]. The Ambassador to Colonel 
Benoit. Do you need more? Believe that 
With determination your plans will succeed." 
Another message from Tap Bennett: 
"Could you open Punta Caucedo [the inter-
national airport] for air traffic to bring in 
food and medicine? Uniformed marines can 
operate there If civilians are not there." 
Another exchange between the Embassy 
and an American voice at San Isidro Air 
Force Base spoke of need for batteries, com-
munications equipment, and rations for the 
Wessin troops. 
A message from San Isidro reported that "a 
significant morale boost is evident here since 
the arrival of rations." Then, San Isidro 
informed Shade Tree 1 that "I've got a 
message that the suppression attack is being 
initiated at 08-45 local." A message from the 
Embassy asked Colonel Benoit whether he 
had enough supplies against "the Castro 
forces facing you." The message then was 
changed to say "rebel forces" instead of 
"Castro forees." 
Aboard the Boxer the task force commo-
dore, Capt. James A. Dare, dispelled any 
doubts about why the marines had landed 
in Santo Domingo. Briefing newsmen, he 
said that American forces would remain 
there long enough "to keep this a non-Corn-
munist government." But the official story 
at the Santo Domingo Embassy and in Wash-
ington continued to be that the troops had 
gone ashore to provide safety during the 
evacuation. 
That Thursday evening Tap Bennett 
briefed the group of newsmen who had come 
ashore from the Boxer. He told them that 
there was evidence of Communist domina-
tion in the rebel movement, then distributed 
typewritten copies of a list ef 54 Commu-
nists or Communist sympathizers who, Ben-
'nett said, were active in the rebel leader-
ship. 
Simultaneously the Embassy cabled Wash-
ington the text of a rebel leaflet that called 
for a fight "to death" against the Wessin 
forces. It was signed by eight rebel leaders, 
No. 138-19 
beginning with Colonel Caamano. The 
Embassy message, signed by Bennett, said 
that two of the signers might have Commu-
nist connections but that no Information 
was available about the others. In Wash-
ington, State Department oil:deals began 
hinting to newsmen, on the strength of the 
Bennett telegram, that seven or eight of the 
top rebel leaders might be Communist-
oriented. 
Bennett also told newsmen that night of 
rebel atrocities?of several heads paraded on 
pikes, of mass executions, and of how Colonel 
Caamaflo personally had machinegunned 
Colonel Calderon, the aide-de-camp to 
President Reid Cabral. The reporters had 
no reason to doubt Bennett's accounts, which 
were also being cabled to Washington. 
But it subsequently developed that none 
of these reports was accurate. Nobody could 
be found in the rebel zone--where reporters 
went but Embassy officials did not?to con-
firm the stories of executions or of heads on 
pikes. Colonel Caldertm emerged a few days 
later at a hospital with a slight neck wound 
received at the palace during the first day 
of the revolution. A newsman had a beer 
with him later on. 
As days passed It became evident that, 
deliberately or because of faulty informa-
tion, the Embassy was passing out inaccu-
rate reports. One evening an official State 
Department spokesman announced that the 
Embassy had received the intelligence that 
Colonel Caamafio had met with five Com-
munist leaders the night before and prom-
ised them cabinet posts if the revolution 
succeeded. If it failed, Caamafie was sup-
posed to have said, he would negotiate safe 
conduct out of the country for them. The 
spokesman did not have the names of the 
leaders, and several days later he acknowl-
edged that the Embassy was not at all sure 
of this information. 
At his staff meetings, Bennett referred to 
the rebels as "that Communist scum" or 
"that bunch downtown." Requests from 
Dominician professional groups?business-
men, lawyers, doctors, and engineers?for 
contacts with the Embassy to explain their 
contention that the "constitutionalist" revo-
lution was not Communist, were not 
granted. When a reporter asked Bennett if 
he did not fear that this policy of isolating 
the rebels might push them into Communist 
hands, he replied, "They are already in Com-
munist hands." 
This was also the quickly reached conclu-
sion of John Bartlow Martin, the former 
Ambassador to the Dominican Republic 
during the Bosch regime whom President 
Johnson sent to Santo Domingo to establish 
contact with the rebels and to take a fresh 
look at the situation. Martin, who had the 
reputation of being a liberal and had many 
friends in Bosch's P.R.D., spent an afternoon 
conferring at the Caamailo command post 
and immediately announced at a news con-
ference that the revolution had been taken 
over by Communists. He said flatly that all 
"democratic elements have been destroyed." 
But neither Martin nor the Embassy is 
known to have made any effort to encourage 
democrats against the Communists. For 10 
days there were no further contacts between 
the United States and the rebels. The Em-
bassy clearly demonstrated partiality for the 
'forces of the junta?which it began to call 
"the Government of National Reconstruc-
tion." 
To head this "government," the Embassy 
picked Brig. Gen. Antonio Imbert Barreras, 
one of two survivors of the group that killed 
Trujillo. To assist General Imbert, the 
United States made available $750,000 on 
-May 9 to pay the salaries of public employees 
in areas not under rebel control. No similar 
offer was made to Colonel Caamafio. 
Santo Domingo was a city governed by 
confusion. While the United States was still 
proclaiming "strict neutrality," technicians 
from the U.S. Information Agency and the 
CIA jammed the rebel radio station. News-
men and television cameramen recorded 
truckloads of Imbert troops passing freely 
through American checkpoints en route to 
battle the rebels. 
On the rebel side, Colonel Caamafio's an-
nouncers vilified Ambassador Bennett in the 
worst imaginable terms. Snipers, who ac-
cording to Caamafio were not under his con-
trol, fired nightly at American positions, 
often causing casualties. Amid all the con-
fusion, an Organization of American States 
team negotiated a shaky truce on May 5. 
The Johnson administration determined 
that a new approach might be needed to 
bring matters to a settlement, and that the 
reporting and the recommendations from 
Bennett and Martin were no longer ade-
quate. In the same way that Martin had 
been sent in because of doubts about Tap 
Bennett's reporting, McGeorge Bundy, the 
President's Special Assistant for National 
Security Affairs, was dispatched to reinforce 
Martin. With him came the State Depart-
ment's two top Latin experts, Mann and 
Vaughn. 
Just before the Bundy mission's arrival, 
Imbert aircraft broke the OAS-arranged 
truce. Guns blazing, they made strafing 
runs on rebel-held Radio Santo Domingo. In 
Making their approach, the planes roared 
over the Embassy, spraying bullets into ad-
joining streets. Tap Bennett and many of 
his aids dived under their desks, the Am-
bassador. shouting, "I shall protest this." 
For reasons never explained, Bundy's pres-
ence in Santo Domingo was kept secret for 
12 hours while officials denied that he and 
other high-ranking envoys were there. 
Newsmen were now barred from the Em-
bassy building, largely because the small, 
green-shuttered structure was so full of 
generals and top-level "special guests" that 
it was almost impossible to move about in-
side or find privacy for confidential con-
versations. 
Bundy's mission was to negotiate a com-
promise constitutional government. Se-
lected to head it was Antonio Guzman, the 
former agriculture minister under Dr. 
Bosch and the man reportedly received so 
coolly by Second Secretary Breisky on that 
first Sunday of the revolution. Gunman's 
name was suggested by Bosch, whom Bundy 
had stopped off to consult in San Juan. He 
was basically acceptable to the United 
States and to the Caarnafio command. The 
only remaining problem: was to win Gen-
eral Imbert's agreement to resign in favor 
of the compromise candidate. 
It was not a small problem. When Under 
Secretary Mann suggested to Imbert that he 
resign, Imbert flatly refused. He told the 
Americans that since the United States had 
helped him to become the head of the junta, 
he now intended to keep the post. To do 
otherwise, he said, would be "to turn every-
thing over to the Communists." General 
Imbert told reporters, "I won't be played for 
a sucker." One reporter described the situ-
ation by writing, "General Imbert is the U.S. 
puppet who is pulling his own strings." 
It was at this time that Lt. Gen. Bruce 
Palmer, commander of U.S. military forces, 
had to order half of the marine howitzers?
which had until now been aimed at the rebel 
stronghold downtown?turned around to 
face Imbert's troop emplacements. Some of 
Palmer's troops appeared to be confused 
about their mission, and some wondered 
where the enemy was. 
During the Guzman-Bundy negotiation 
and while the OAS-arranged truce was still 
in effect, the Imbert forces mounted another 
offensive against the rebels, this time In the 
northern section of Santo Domingo. Im-
bert's tanks and artillery made a full-scale

assault that cost hundreds of Dorninioan 
rives, mainly of women and children. 
The rebels could not counter imbert's at-
tack in the north because the U.S.-controlled 
security corridor, bisecting the city from 
east to west, kept them hemmed tn down-
town. At one stage the 'United States pre-
pared to open another corridor, running 
north from the rebel area, to halt the Imbert 
? advance. But this idea, advocated by Bundy, 
was vetoed In Washington. At the embassy, 
Under amatory Mann said that he hoped 
Castro would recognize the Caamato regime 
arid prove once and for all that the rebels 
were Communist-oriented. 
Then "the Guzman formula"?for which 
Bundy had worked for 10 days with all the 
prestige of his White House post?collapsed 
on orders from Washington. The FBI had 
intercepted a telephone conversation between 
Dr. Bosch and a friend. The conver-
sation reportedly included a statement that 
if the Guzman regime were installed there 
could be a new government in 5 days. About 
this time the State Department sent a memo-
randum to the White House recalling that in 
1933 the United States had been accused of 
imposing a government on Cuba and that 
the Johnson administration should beware 
of opening itself to such a charge. 
The breakdown of the Bundy-Guzman ne-
gotiation marked, for many of those on the 
rebel side, the end of hopes for a "constitu-
tional" regime. The Imbert regime was al-
lowed to go on consolidating its position in 
the governmentless country, while another 
OAS commission, the second inter-American 
group to try mediation, arrived in Santo Do-
mingo to seek a settlement. 
On the day before his return to Washing-
ton, 5 weeks atter the United States found It 
had a tiger by the tail, Bundy arranged to 
meet with Colonel Caarnafio and his asso-
ciates. It was to be their first encounter, for 
the rebel chief had canceled an appointment 
a week earlier when one of his top aides was 
killed by gunfire, apparently shot by U.S. 
troops manning the security corridor. The 
meeting place was to be the Music Conserva-
tory, a modern white building on a seaside 
boulevard in the no man's land between the 
marine and rebel lines. Arriving there at 
345 pan., Bundy and his associates found 
the building locked, but assumed that Colo-
nel Cashaafio's men had made arrangements 
to have the conservatory opened. It turned 
out, however, that Colonel enemalio had 
made a like assumption. After unsuccess-
fully trying to find an open door or window, 
one of The rebels produced a knife and pried 
loose some Window panes. Chairs were 
brought into position and the two delega-
tions climbed in through the window. 
The meeting lasted 4 hours, with Bundy 
using his fluent Spanish in the confereme. 
Near the end of the session, violent gunfire 
broke out not far from the conservatory. 
Swearing in anger, Colonel Caamailo rushed 
to telephone his forces to stop firing. Bundy 
knitted for a phone to contact U.S. corn-
mangers. But there was no telephone in the

Tim 'TIMM Lerma 
(The weekly analysis of Latin American 
affairs) 
The Dominican crisis hangs like a dark 
cloud over the upcoming second special Inter-
American Conference of Foreign. Ministers, 
scheduled for Rid on August 4. The longer 
the Caribbean deadlock endures, the more 
prejudicial it becomes. The U.S. unilateral 
intervention, the subsequent creation of an 
Inter-American Peace Force and the de facto 
OAS trusteeship have raised fundamental 
questions which completely overshadow the 
agenda, mostly pegged to reorganizatIonal 
and economic matters. 
Lacking a consensus on the OAS role in 
the Dominican Republic, some members tried 
.to Postpone the meeting. However, Brazil, 
with important elections around the corner, 
pressed for holding the meeting on schedule 
and received key support from Argentina and 
Chile. Now, rumors of postponement, which 
seem unfounded at the moment, are on the 
wing again. 
Washington had hoped that Rio would be 
a forum to discuss the setting up of a per-
manent inter-American police force to deal 
with Communist flareups, and President 
Johnson, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and 
OAS Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker all talked 
it up. But the kickback has been so strong 
that the ides has been quietly put aside, for 
the moment at least. 
As a sign of Latin American discontent 
over the Dominican affair, Secretary General 
Jos?. Mora came under some sharp ques-
tioning from OAS ambassadors last week at 
a closed-door briefing he defended himself 
well, but still he was under the gun for 
such picayune consideration as unfurling an 
interatimerican flag in Santo Domingo with-
out authorization. Chilean President Edu-
ardo Frei gave a foretaste of the kind of talk 
which may be heard in Rio when he stated 
in Paris this week: "We want an inter-
American system without hegemony." 
'In avoid polemics, some nations would like 
to make the Rio conference as short as possi-
ble. Such questions as an inter-American 
force would be thrown into some future 
conference called to amend the OAS Charter. 
Events in the Dominicau Republic have been 
no help. Loose ends keep appearing after 
the mediators reportedly have bagged a solu-
tion. The whole involvement has stretched 
the OAS to the limit, and Secretariat officials 
find themselves deeply immersed in a myriad 
of unfamiliar tasks in Santo Domingo. Tech-
nically speaking, the OAS may have two 
conferences on the fire simultaneously next

eign Ministers, convoked to handle the Do-

is solved. 
MIDWES rhatN STATES REFUSE TO 
BACK ROTTEN BOROUGH 
AMENDMENT 
Mr. TY-DINGS. Mr. President, the 
indications are growing every day that 
the rotten borough amendment is los-
ing ground not only in the Senate but in 
the country. One after another colum-
nists, editorial writers, and other lead-
ers of public opinion are recognizing the 
grave dangers which the rotten borough 
amendment poses to our democratic sys-
tem. Perhaps the most significant indi-
cation that the rotton borough amend-
ment is losing support throughout the 
country is the fact that the Midwestern 
Conference of the Council of State Gov-
ernments refused to adopt a mesolution 
calling for the passage of Senator DIRK-
BEN'S proposed amendment. 
According to a report in the Wash-
ington Post of July 22, the Dirksen 
amendment failed for lack of a majority 
in the 12-member Council of State Gov-
ernments just as it failed for lack of a 
majority in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. The Washington Post reports 
that 6 of the 12 Midwestern States fa-
vored the resolution calling on Congress 
to approve the rotton borough amend-
ment. But six States refused to lend 
their consent to this resolution. Three 
of these six?Indiana, Iowa, and Michi-
gan?voted against the resolution. 
Three others?Minnesota, Wisconsin, 
and Illinois?abstained. I find it highly 
significant that the mntority leader's 
own State should fail to endorse his pro-
posed constitutional amendment and 
that his proposal should fail to carry 
in the heartland of this great coun-
try. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Washington Post article 
be inserted in the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD. 
as follows:

VIETNAM SPEC v E?WHY 
WE ARE THERE 
Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, yester-
day President Lyndon Johnson went to 
the American people to describe again 
the critical nature of the crisis in south-
east Asia and what its dimensions re-
quire of us. He made clear two funda-
mental points that must be understood 
everywhere and by everyone. The first is 
that, in adversity or in success, we do not 
intend to abandon Vietnam to the ag-
gressors?that we are there to stay 
Whatever the price may be; and second 
that we stand ready at all times to talk 
to anyone in the hopes of negotiating a 
peaceful settlement. That these basic 
concepts of our policy in that troubled 
part of the world may become more 
costly, more risky, and more troubled he 
left no doubt. Eut it was a candid ap-
praisal which no American could mis-
read, nor from which no American 
would dare retreat. President Johnson 
Made it abundantly clear, moreover, that 
we intend to prosecute the struggle in 
Vietnam within the context of stopping 
aggression and protecting smaller na-
tions from their enemies outside with-
out, on our part, resorting to general 
war. 
The response to the President's mes-
sage has been heartwarming and, in fact, 
very strong. I ask unanimous consent to 
have printed in the RECORD following my 
remarks the editorial comment appear-
ing in this morning's Washington Post 
applauding the President's statement.

Whether it be as bloody and cruel as the 
jungles or rice paddies of Vietnam com-
mand or a nice "clean" little crisis like 
Berlin or Cuba where the nerves of the 
giants on the political chessboard of 
power politics were tested by air power 
alone, the central issue remains the 
same?that of the willingness of those 
with power but bent upon peace to use 
that power in behalf of peace. History 
has thrust us into this role. We did not 
seek it. We do not want it. But the 
tides of change in our time have swept 
us up with these alternatives and these 
requirements. We have no choice save 
one. That is to forfeit both the respon-
sibility and the opportunity for reshap-
ing the balance of power of the new 
20th century world to governments and 
philosophies and forces hostile to the 
basic principles of peace and human 
freedom. 
The fact of American military and 
political power in the wake of World 
War II no one can deny. But the price 
of that power, with those attendant risks 
and sacrifices, would be avoided or 
evaded by some of our people at the 
present time, if they had their way. 
We?and we hope they?are learning, 
however, that the price of peace is not 
a cheap one and that peace does not just 
"happen." Both World War I and It 
should have taught that peace has to be 
waged as vigorously as we wage war. 
This means the willingness to risk the 
use of the tools of war in order to achieve 
the goals of peace. 
It is in pursuit of this harsh fact of 
International life that the United States 
went to Vietnam in the first place. How 
we got there and why we must stay are 
better viewed and understood from the 
perspective of what has preceded our 
policy there. 
For a few brief moments then, Mr. 
President, I would like to recast the for-
eign policy of the United States since 
World War II in the setting of stress and 
pressure and threat which required it 
and to spell out some of the conditions 
which shape it. For it can be seen that, 
against the backdrop of the cold war 
years, our policy in Vietnam is but an-
other logical and necessary commitment 
within the same framework of national 
interest and international responsibility 
as were Iran, Greece, Berlin, Korea, 
and?in one sense?even Cuba. 
Ever since the end of the Second World 
War the United States has followed two 
general lines of foreign policy at one and 
the same time. There is nothing incon-
sistent in this. Indeed, we could not 
avoid it, for we faced a world with a split 
personality.

transport together have given us the 
means to conquer the environment and 
to raise standards of living to levels of 
decency throughout the planet?to lib-
eralize and to humanize life for all man-
kind. 
Plainly the way to sdeal with this world 
of new opportunity?of progress and 
color and excitement?was the way of 
international cooperation. 
Our Nation rose splendidly to the chal-
lenge of the world of opportunity. We 
did well in matching scientific invention 
with social invention. We invented the 
Marshall plan. We invented the point 
four program. We launched the AID 
program and the Alliance for Progress 
and food for peace and atoms for peace 
and the Peace Corps, to cite a few ex-
amples. 
We have shared our resources and our 
technology and our know-how. We 
have cooperated with all who would co-
operate with us. 
And we have organized for permanent 
cooperation in this world of opportunity 
in one way after another. We are mem-
bers in good standing of every useful in-
ternational organization in the world. 
We send delegations to almost every in-
ternational conference?and there are 
half a thousand of them every year. We 
participate in cooperative regional or-
ganizations wherever it is appropriate 
for us to do so. We take part in the 
World Bank and the International De-
velopment Agency and the Inter-Ameri-
man Bank and have offered to do the 
same in the Asian Development Bank. 
We have lent more support and pro-
vided more leadership in the United Na-
tions than has any other member. And 
not just in the Security Council. Not 
just in the General Assembly. As the 
whole family of United Nations agencies 
has come into being and then gone into 
operation, the United States has been in 
the forefront of the initiators, the con-
tributors and the leading supporters of 
these agencies in which the nations share 
their resources and talents cooperatively 
to help make good the opportunities 
opened up by science and technology. 
I could go on and on with examples. 
Taken together they comprise the first 
line of our postwar foreign policy. We 
have done all this partly out of com-
passion and partly out of enlightened 
self-interest; for-the cooperative path 
Is the path to peace and order, to prog-
ress and justice, in a world made one by 
science. 
But alas, Mr. President, these actions?
this preferred course of our leaders and 
our people?could not be the whole of 
our foreign policy. For there was an-
other aspect of the world which had to be 
dealt with too?another face to world af-
fairs. This was the face of danger, of 
threat, of force, of violence, and of war. 
This face of the world was not de-
signed by us; it was designed by others. 
By the very nature of our society we 
could only react to it. But to defend our 
society?and our kind of society else-
where?and the very hope of our kind 
of society anywhere?we were obligated 
to react to it. And we did. Taken to-

threat of force make up the second gen-
eral line of our postwar foreign policy. 
When our offer to turn over to the 
United Nations full control of the dan-
gerous aspects of atomic energy was re-
jected by the Soviet Union?in one of the 
most tragic decisions in history?we had 
no choice but to build up an arsenal of 
nuclear weapons. 
And when it became indisputably evi-
dent that our wartime Russian ally was 
more imperialist than the czars, we or-
ganized to defend ourselves and our 
friends?and indeed all who were pre-
pared to resist aggression to preserve 
their national independence. 
That policy was laid down for all the 
world to see in this very Chamber on 
March 12, 1947, by President Harry S. 
Truman. It is well worthwhile to re-
call here today the key passage of that 
historic proposal which came to be 
known as the Truman doctrine. The 
President pointed out that the survival 
of Greece was threatened by terrorists 
led by Communists?that Greece must 
have our assistance?that there was no 
other place to turn except the United 
States?that the future of Turkey as an 
independent state likewise was threat-
ened. And then the President enunci-
ated the policy he was recommending to 
the Congress and the people in these 
words: 
I am fully aware of the broad implications 
involved. * * * We shall not realize our ob-
jectives, however, unless we are willing to 
help free peoples to maintain their free in-
stitutions and their national integrity 
against aggressive movements that seek to 
impose upon them totalitarian regimes. * * * 
Mr. President, I would remind Senators 
that when President Truman spoke the 
Greek Army was in no shape to put up 
much of a fight. The terrorists con-
trolled most of the countryside and gov-
ernment forces had retreated to a 
shrunken area around the capital. Lines 
of communications were broken. 
Refugees from burnt-out villages were 
shuffling into Athens. Foreign exchange 
was exhausted. Prices were out of con-
trol. And a deep sense of panic infected 
the people. 
That doctrine, laid down in this Cham-
ber in 1947, has been in force ever since. 
It was tested first in Greece and Turkey. 
Then it was tested in Berlin. Then it 
was tested in Korea. 
To support that doctrine has cost our 
Nation dearily in time and effort?yes, in 
treasure and in lives. But it worked. 
Not since Korea-15 years ago?has an 
nation marched its armies across another 
nation's frontiers. 
The Truman doctrine in action taught 
the world that the United States meant 
exactly what President Harry Truman 
said?that we were in fact prepared "to 
help free peoples to maintain their free 
institutions and their national integrity 
against aggressive movements that seek 
to impose upon them totalitarian 
regimes." 
Moreover, it taught the former 
masters of the Soviet Union that armed 
aggression simply does not work because 
it will not be allowed to work. That was 
an important?perhaps essential?lesson 
in the search for world peace. 
But unfortunately mainland China is - 
still in the hands of men who believe?
as Mao Tse-tung has said again and 
again?that "all political power grows 
out of the barrel of a gun." And his 
disciples have turned to a new form of 
aggression which they offer to the world 
behind a false face called "wars of na-
tional liberation." 
These are, of course, neither liberating 
nor national. They are aggressions un-
disguised by the fact that they begin 
without bugles or banners, that their 
agents may dress not in uniforms but 
in the work clothes of peasants, that 
they strike not at dawn but after sunset, 
that their tactics are not those of con-
ventional armed forces but of noncon-
ventional guerrilla bands. 
Mr. President, the organization, train-
ing and equipping of murderers and 
marauders, the clandestine infiltration 
of such bands across interiiational 
frontiers, the arts of guerrilla warfare 
practiced in the name of "national lib-
eration"?this is merely the most modern 
form of aggression, of conquest, and of 
empire. 
And the greatest threat to the peace 
of the world today lies in this, insidious 
doctrine of wars of national liberation, 
this clandestine form of international 
aggression which is facing its climatic 
test in Vietnam today. 
If it succeeds in Vietnam, it will be 
taken as proof that it can succeed 
elsewhere. 
If it succeeds in Vietnam, it will be 
taken as hard evidence that militant 
violence is a better way to promote com-
munism than competitive coexistence. 
But if it fails in Vietnam, the policy 
of promoting "wars of national libera-
tion" will be dealt a body-blow every-
where. So let us be very, very clear 
what may be well at stake here and 
now. 
The world is still dangerously over-
stocked with atomic weapons and the 
threat of spreading atomic power has 
by no means receded. Yet it is my view 
that when the great atomic powers stood 
on the edge of that awful abyss in the 
Caribbean in the autumn of 1962, a 
tacit agreement against nuclear war 
took silent hold in the capitals of the 
nuclear powers. We have reason to 
hope that nuclear weapons, by their very 
destructiveness, have outlawed their use. 
And when old-fashioned aggression 
with conventional arms was at last 
stopped dead in its tracks along the 38th 
parallel in Korea, one and all could see 
that there was no mileage left in that 
kind of attack against a neighboring 
state. 
Now clandestine aggression is on trial 
in Vietnam. If that, too, can be shown to 
be futile, is it too much to hope that the 
day of the aggressor will be over for all 
time? I would not expect the sudden re-
form of Mao Tse-tung or Fidel Castro 
and some of their followers. But the evi-
dence would be in. Armed aggression?
nuclear, conventional or guerrilla?does 
not belong in the second half of the 20th 
century. There is nothing to be gained?
nothing in it for anybody. 
So Vietnam could well be the last 
chapter in the long, long story of mili-
tary conquest. The stakes could be just 
that high. 
In any event, Mr. President, the fact 
that Vietnam is halfway around the 
world is no better reason for not stand-
ing against aggression there today than 
it was in Korea a decade and a half ago. 
The fact that aggression in Vietnam is 
dressed up in the false doctrine of "wars 
of national-liberation" does not make the 
Truman doctrine any less relevant than 
it was in 1947. 
We stand in Vietnam now for the 
same reason we stood in Greece and 
Turkey. That reason is right. It is just. 
It is moral. And if we have the endur-
ance?which I know we have?it will turn 
out as it has turned out in the past--
successfully. 
And let us not be deluded by Commu-
nist propaganda, or by statements made 
in other capitals for domestic political 
purposes, or by uninformed pleas from 
people who are genuinely frightened, that 
we stand exposed and isolated in Viet-
nam. For we are not alone in that far 
land. 
Outside of Communist China and North 
Vietnam, there is hardly a nation in this 
world which in truth wants the United 
States to withdraw its support of the 
Republic of Vietnam. Outside of those 
places, there is hardly a responsible 
leader who does not privately hope that 
aggression will be stopped in Vietnam. 
And more than 30 nations, in one way 
or another, are providing some kind of 
help to the Republic of Vietnam in in; 
hour of agony. Some have provided 
money and relief and school supplies: 
some are training young Vietnamese in 
their own countries; some are offering 
technical assistance in such fields as 
agriculture, forestry, dairy practices, and 
engineering. Others have sent nurses 
and medical and surgical teams and 
mobile military hospitals. Several have 
sent psychological warfare experts. 
Military units are on the scene from 
Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and 
Thailand in addition to U.S. forces from 
the United States. 
Whatever may be said by hostile or 
irresponsible critics, the world knows 
well what we want and do not want in 
Vietnam. It has been said by President 
Eisenhower and by President Kennedy 
and by President Johnson in turn. It has 
been said by others, including the late 
Adlai Stevenson. More than a year ago. 
on May 21, 1964, Mr. Stevenson told the 
Security Council of the United Nations: 
The United States has no, repeat, no, na - 
tional military objective anywhere in south-
east Asia. U.S. policy for southeast Asia is 
very simple. It is the restoration of peace 
so that the peoples of that area can go about 
their own independent business in whatever 
associations they may freely choose for them-
selves without interference from the outside. 
Later in the same address, Governor 
Stevenson stated?as others had before 
and have since?what is needed to bring 
peace to Vietnam: 
There is a very easy way to restore order 
in southeast Asia. There is a very simple, 
safe way to bring about the end of U.S. mil-
itary aid to the Republic of Vietnam. 
Let all states In that area make and abide 
by the simple decision to leave their neigh-
bors alone.

When their neighbors decide to leave them 
alone?as they must?there will be no fight-
ing in southeast Asia. * * * Any time that 
decision can be put in enforceable terms, 
my Government will be only too happy to 
put down the burden that we have been 
sharing with those determined to preserve 
their independence. Until such assurances 
are forthcoming, we shall stand for the in-
dependence of free peoples in southeast Asia 
as we have elsewhere, 
So we are not yet finished 'with the

1947. We are still obliged to pursue that 
second general line of foreign policy 
which is helping others to stand against 
those who, would impose totalitarian re-
gimes upon them from across their bor-
ders. This has been a heavy burden and 
at times a lonely and thankless task. 
Yet I shudder to think of what this 
world would look like today if the United 
States had not stood firm in Greece and 
Turkey, in Berlin and Korea, as we are 
standing firm in Vietnam today. 
Mr. President, we have worked hard 
these ?past two decades to make the 
point that armed aggression no longer 
pays. When that point is made once 
again in Vietnam, it should be made 
once and for all. 
And until it is?until the aggressor re-
gains enough of his senses to leave the 
battlefield for the conference table?I 
shall support without reservation every 
effort that is needed to finish-the job for 
good. 
I yield the floor.

[From the Washington Post, July 29, 1965] 
? THE VIETNAM Potaar 
In typiCally Johnsonian fashion, the Presi-
dent supplemented his announcement of 
intensified American participation in the 
Vietnamese war with an escalation of his 
peace efforts. Draft calls are to be doubled 
In the months ahead, and there will be a 
rapid buildup of American fighting men in 
the besieged southeast Asian country. But 
the aim of protecting freedom and independ-
ence from Communist aggression without 
resort to general war remains the same. 
The President made another graceful ap-
peal to the United Nations to exert whatever 
Influence it can to halt the aggression in 
Vietnam. At the same time he offered to dis-
cuss Hanoi's proposals along with our own 
and those of any other interested nation that 
may care to sit down at a conference table. 
His sincere desire to substitute the confer-
ence table for the battlefield took away any 
suggestion of belligerence that might other-
wise have been read into the announcement 
of expanding military operations. 
The gist of what the President had to 
say is that the United States places such a 
high value on peace that it is willing to fight 
for it. The spread of Asian communism by 
terror and slaughter is the antithesis of both 
peace and freedom. The United States has 
attempted to provide a shield against this 
menace. It is now called upon to demon-
strate that this shield is not an illusion. 
We do not see how Pre'sident Johnson 
could have explained the necessity of the 
U.S, course in Vietnam more effectively than 
he did: 
"If ,wc are driven from the fields in Viet-
nam, then no nation can ever again have 
the same confidence in our promise of pro-
tectioP. In each land the forces of inde-
pendence would be weakened. An Asia so 
threatened by Communist domination would 
hnpril the security of the United States 
Itself. 
"We just cannot now dishonor our word 
or abandon our commitment or leave those 
who believed us and who trusted us to the 
terror and repression and murder that would 
follow. This, then, my fellow Americans, is 
why we are in Vietnam." 
The president's reference to "Asian com-
munism' doubtless holds special significance. 
His exclusion of the Russians from his com-
ments was an indirect appeal for Moscow's 
understanding of why we must do what we 
are doing. The Soviet Union shares at least 
some of the alarm in the West over the openly 
belligerent and recklessly aggressive course 
of Communist China and the Hanoi govern-
ment. President Johnsen seemed to be say-
ing to Moscow that the United States is do-
ing everything possible to avoid a general 
war and that the two major nuclear powers 
have a common interest in not allowing this 
Asian Communist brushfire to get out of hand 
for want of a rational confrontation at a 
conference table. 
Within the United States, we surmise that 
the response to the President's speech will be 
overwhelmingly favorable. Despite the in-
nate hatred of war, most of the people are 
aware of the kind of world we live in. They 
appear to be reconciled to a hard struggle 
in a faraway land because of the close re-
lation it has to the preservation of our own 
freedom. Many of those who are committed 
to the general policy, however, retain some 
concern over the way it is being carried out. 
One would hope that much of the discus-
sion in the White House conferences of the 
last week has been given to effective employ-
ment of the additional manpower and equip-
ment that are flowing to Vietnam. It is not 
enough merely to build up larger forces and 
the volume of supplies. With the extension 
of military might in Vietnam, there will be 
Increasing need for wise decisions and sound 
strategy. This perceptive statement on the 
part of the President also greatly strengthens 
confidence that he will be as firm in pushing 
for a rational settlement as he has been in 
trying to teach the Communists that peace 
cannot be bought with terror and aggression. 
EXHIBIT 2 
[From the Washington Daily News, July 29, 
1965] 
EVERYTHING THAT IS NECESSARY 
At his televised press conference yester-
day, President Johnson was about as clear 
as anyone could be about why we are in 
Vietnam and what we propose to do about it. 
We are there, in short, because we have to 
be. Our national security is at stake. If 
we have learned anything in our frustrating 
and costly experience with communism the 
last 20 years, It is that nonresistance is the 
quickest way to our own downfall. 
And what we are going to do about Com-
munist terrorism and aggression in Vietnam 
is everything that is necessary. This may 
be a lot. To start, the President is doubling 
the draft and immediately adding 50,000 
troops to our forces in Vietnam. 
These are the choices forced upon us. 
Every retreat from Communist attack has 
resulted in. defeat, in more peoples losing 
their freedom. Every evidence of weakness 
merely has served to egg on the Communists. 
The President spoke of commitments of 
three Presidents to defend Vietnam. But 
even more essential is our national inter-
est?for if we should quit Vietnam we re-
treat a long step toward subjugation of our 
own freedoms to Communist domination. 
All that we have built in this country, and 
all that we hope to build, would be jeopard-
ized. We are fighting, even though in a dis-
tant land, for our own security. 
Mr. Johnson said he had asked the com-
mander in Vietnam what he needs to meet 
the situation, and that these needs will be 
met. 
The only question here is whether enough 
is to be done now: - 
For many months we have hoped the drag-
18163 
'ging war in Vietnam woud lead to a negotia-
tion table. That hope has been grounded. 
There are risks in whatever we do. But 
the risks if we do not stop the Vietcong are 
far greater, in terms of our own safety, than 
the risks in using our power (all of it, if 
necessary) to force a decision in South 
Vietnam. 
It is, as the President said, agonizing. But 
that's the way it is. We didn't make the 
situation. But it is up to us, primarily, to 
settle it, as completely and as rapidly as 
possible. 
It is war, and, let every American see it as 
such. 
EXHIBIT 3 
iFrom the Evening Star, July 29, 1965] 
NO SURRENDER?NO RETREAT 
The Presient's report to the Nation on 
Vietnam was perhaps his best performance 
since taking office. 
He was careful to explain?again?why we 
are fighting in Vietnam. It boils down to 
this: First we have made a commitment 
there which we will not dishonor. Sec-
ond, to let Vietnam go would merely whet 
the appetite of the aggressors. If we do not 
see this fight through, we will surely have to 
fight later under even less favorable condi-
tions at some other place. 
Mr. Johnson also?again?held forth the 
olive branch. He said he would welcome 
any effective intervention by the United Na-
tions. He repeated his readiness to go to 
the conference table at any time. Our goal, 
he stressed, is a free election, internationally 
supervised, "in the south, or throughout all 
Vietnam." In short, our record in this re-
spect is as clear as clear can be?for any-
one who wants to read it. 
Some disappointment has been expressed 
because the military buildup announced by 
Mr. Johnson stopped short of what, in one 
view, is needed. An additional 50,000 Amer-
ican troops will be sent immediately to South 
Vietnam. But the buildup will not stop 
at that level. "Additional forces will be 
needed later," the President said, "and they 
will be sent." He is not now calling up the 
Reserves, although the implication is plain 
that this, too, will be done if and when 
needed. The monthly draft call is to be 
raised at once from 15,000 to 35,000?presum-
ably in preparation for the time when more 
units will be shipped to the battle scene. 
Taken together, these Measures are a sig-
nificant enlargement of the effort that we 
are making and will make. 
Everything will depend upon the reaction 
of the other side. The President sought to 
allay apprehensions by saying that "nothing 
we have in mind should arouse any distrust 
or provoke any violence" by the Soviet Un-
ion. The only immediate response has been 
a Moscow radio broadcast, in French, which 
was monitored in London. It said that the 
United States is taking a "colossal risk" in 
boosting its strength in Vietnam. 
The President, however, had already given 
the appropriate answer: "We do not want an 
expanding struggle with consequences no one 
can foresee. Nor will we bluster or bully or 
flaunt our power. But we will not surrender. 
And we will not retreat." 
Well said. 
EXHIBIT 4 
THE SILENT CENTER MUST SPEAK UP 
"I hope that others who feel as you do 
may be willing to join in this expression." 
(From President Johnson's letter to Freedom 
House.) 
The defense of our Government's efforts 
in South Vietnam should not be left solely 
to the President or to officials of the admin-
istration. The critics of the President have 
had the field to themselves. ,This monolog 
is a disservice to the American people. The 
great majority of our people have been

18164 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE duty 29, 1965 
silent too long; their voices must now be 
heard. 
The distorted picture of American public 
opinion given by the critics has undoubtedly 
affected the decisions of the Communist 
rulers in Hanoi and Peiping. Few of these 
rules have ever visited Western countries: 
they do not realize that the strength of the 
small ad hos groups calling for American 
withdrawal from Vietnam is grossly exag-
gerated. This misunderstanding has im-
peded the administration's effort to achieve 
a durable peace. The notion that the Ameri-
can people are gravely divided against their 
leaders has helped to create the illusion that 
in the end the United States would capitu-
late to the aggressor. 
It is not surprising that a recent full-page 
advertisement, signed by several hundred 
artists and seeking to persuade the country 
to abandon the defense of South Vietnam, 
Included the names of avowed Commu-
nists?men whose articles have appeared in 
the Communist Worker and whose books are 
official Communist publications. But more 
noteworthy is the long-list of those others 
who are not Communists and have neverthe-
less added their signatures; believing they 
are striking a blow for peace, they have 
allowed themselves to become parties to an 
insidious propaganda campaign. 
One of the many things the advertisement 
forgot to mention is that both Peiping and 
Moscow have rejected all appeals for nego-
tiations by our President, by United Nations 
Secretary General U Thant, by the mediation 
committee of the 17 nonahned Afro-Asian 
nations, and others. 
We believe most Americans know that if 
aggression against South Vietnam?disguised 
as a war of liberation?is not successfully 
resisted, more aggression and perhaps even 
larger scale war will follow. That is the 
, 
lesson of Ethiopia. That is the lesson of 
Munich. 
We believe that at this moment of peril 
and challenge the American people would 
like to see their real views proclaimed in a 
forthright declaration of national unity. 
This is why Freedom House offers the fol-
lowing credo of support for our national 
purpose in Vietnam: 
1. Our withdrawal from Vietnam under 
present circumstances cannot be sustained 
on moral grounds. Such a decision would be 
morally indefensible. Having freely accepted 
responsibility as a world power and a cham-
pion of freedom, the United States would dis-
honor that role by defaulting on its promises 
and commitments. Such default would not 
only abandon men, women, and children to 
cruel reprisals; it would seriously undermine 
the credibility of our commitments to other 
nations. 
2. The decision to halt Communist aggres-
sion?whether in Vietnam, Laos, or the 
Congo?is clearly in the interest of the 
United States and the other nations of the 
free world. 
S. We welcome the recognition of a com-
mon interest which has prompted Australia, 
New Zealand, and South Korea to take an 
active part in the present struggle. We hope 
other allies will join in the defense of the 
free world areas threatened by Communist 
"wars of national liberation." 
4. The United States is not embarked on 
a military crusade against Communist na-
tions. Our record in dealing with the Iron 
Curtain nations of Europe and living peace-
ably with their Communist-controlled socie-
ties is our credential. 
5. It is equally important to recognize that 
our military effort is only part of the sub-
stantial U.S. program to enlarge the eco-
nomic, social, and political future of the 
Vietnamese people. 
6. We regret the world is still racked by 
force rather than run by reason. But we 
also see no hope for reason until the force of 
lawlessness is checked, Our troops and arms 
are not mere engines of destruction; they 
are instruments of prevention. We mean to 
use them as judiciously as possible. But we 
do mean to use them effectively. 
There is nothing new in what we confront 
today, either in the challenge from the ag-
gressor or in the timid voices that would 
yield. Nor is there any blinking the fact 
that the necessary responses are both difficult 
and dangerous. The very nature of the great 
challenges we as a nation must face requires 
not only wise decisions but prompt and ef-
fective action. We believe the present policy 
of the United States meets these tests and 
deserves the wholehearted support of the 
American people.

NATIONAL AMERICAN LEGION 
BASEBALL WPWIK?LEGISLATIVE 
REAPPORTIONMENT 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 66) to 
provide for the designation of the period 
from August 31 through September 6, 
1965, as "National American Legion 
Baseball Week." 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I feel 
compelled at this time t,o question a 
statement made by the distinguished 
senior Senator from Hawaii [Mr. FoNu] 
on the floor of the Senate on September 
15, 1964, during the last days of the 88th 
Congress. concerning the effects of the 
Supreme Court ruling on reapportion-
ment. 
It is quite possible that in the last few 
hectic moments of discussion prior to the 
vote on the so-called Javits-Humphrey-
McCarthy modified amendment on re-
apportionment during that session, the 
implications contained in the short 
speech by my distinguished colleague 
were not fully grasped nor understood. 
I believe that it is highly imperative 
that the statement be challenged in order 
to have the record set straight. This is 
especially so in the light of the new move 
to push through the constitutional 
amendment proposed by the distin-
guished junior Senator of Illinois, an 
amendment designed to continue mal-
apportionment in our various State 
legislatures. 
If Senators recall, my colleague stated 
that "the logical extension of the Su-
preme Court's decision would be an 
amendment to the U.S. Constitution or 
a Supreme Court decision requiring re-
apportionment of the U.S. Senate on the 
basis of population in spite of the prohi-
bition that no State without its consent, 
shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in 
the Senate under article V." 
Drawing upon rather questionable 
logic and upon even more questionable 
constitutional interpretation, my col-
league was led to remark that ultimately 
small States such as Hawaii would be 
deprived of representation in the U.S. 
Senate. By the Senator's own logic and 
Interpretation, the list could conceivably 
have included some score or more of the 
other smaller States of the Union. 
I most respectfully feel that the state-
ment by the senior Senator from Hawaii 
is a rather misleading one. 
First, even a superficial reading of the 
reapportionment cases decided by the 
Supreme Court would show that it 
specifically excluded the theory of rep-
resentation underlying the U.S. Senate 
from the principle of one-man, one-
vote as applied to State legislatures. 
There is no question in the Court's mind 
that the Senate of the United States 
would always have two Senators repre-
senting each State of the Union, regard-
less of size or population. The point 
made by the Court is that this Federal 
fc)rm of representation cannot be ex-
tended to State legislatures which often 
over-represent rural areas and under-
represent metropolitan areas. 
For example, the city of Honolulu, 
containing more than 80 percent of the 
State of Hawaii's population, is very 
much underrepresented in the Hawaii 
State Legislature. The decision would, 
in effect, redress that imbalance. 
Mr. Chief Justice Warren, in deliver-
ing the opinion of the majority in Rey-
nolds against Sims, June 15, 1964, stated: 
Much has been written since our decision 
in Baker v. Carr about the applicability of 
the so-called Federal analogy to State legisla-
tive apportionment arrangements. After 
considering the matter, the Court below 
concluded that no conceivable analogy could 
be drawn between the Federal scheme and 
the apportionment of seats in the Alabama 
Legislature under the proposed constitu-
tional amendment. We agree with the Dis-
trict Court, and find the Federal analogy 
Inapposite and irrelevant to State legislative 
districting schemes. Attempted reliance on 
the Federal analogy appears often to be little 
more than an after-the-fact rationalization 
offered in defense of maladjusted State ap-
portionment arrangements. And the Found-
ing Fathers clearly had no intention of 
establishing a pattern or model for the ap-
portionment of seats in State legislatures 
when the system of representation in the 
Federal Congress was adopted. * * * The 
system of representation in the two Houses 
of the Federal Congress is one ingrained in 
our Constitution, as part of the law of the 
land. It is one conceived out of compromise 
and concession indispensable to the estab-
lishment of our Federal Republic. Arising 
from unique historical circumstances, it is 
based on the consideration that in estab-
lishing our type of federalism a group of 
formerly independent States bound them-
selves together under one National Govern-
ment. 
That is what the Supreme Court said. 
How can we possibly infer from this that 
the Court may ultimately require re-
apportionment of the U.S. Senate on the 
basis of population?

Wisconsin is a real one, but I am con-
vinced that it can be solved, especially if 
it is a choice between increasing capac-
ity and letting millions starve. 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. MONDALE. I am pleased to yield 
to the outstanding expert on Food For 
Peace in this country, the distinguished 
Senator from South Dakota. 
Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the Sena-
tor for his overly generous words. 
The Senator from Minnesota has de-
livered the finest statement I have heard 
on challenge of world hunger and what 
our response to that challenge ought to 
be. 
The Senator has described in moving 
terms the world food gap. I regard it as 
? the most important single problem in 
? the world today. I use those words ad-
visedly. If we cannot figure out some 
way to deal with the problem that faces 
half of all the people on this globe to-
day?and that is the problem of ade-
quate food, either too little food or the 
wrong kind of food?we are in for very 
serious tirries. 
Hutt= hunger, human misery and 
disease, all of which are interconnected, 
are at the bottom of a good many of the 
tensions, instability, and explosive sit-
uations that exist all over the world. 
The Senator from Minnesota is ad-
dressing himself to an absolutely crucial 
problem. It is crucial from a moral 
standpoint. It is crucial from a polit-
ical standpoint. It is crucial from an 
economic standpoint. 
The Senator has also described in ef-
feetive terms the rough outline of what 
ought to be our response to that prob-
lem, which is to harness the bountiful 
productive capacity in this country?
capacity that we have been trying to 
Idle at great expense to our taxpayers?
and put that bounty to work in the cause 
of health and peace all over the world. 
I fully appreciate, as does the Senator 
from Minnesota, that until we find a 
More effective way of using this food 
overseas, we must have some kind of con-
trol program at home to keep the sur-
pluses from destroying our agricultural 
economy. 
The time has come, however, particu-
larly if we look at the dwindling food 
reserves in this country, to do what the 
Senator from Minnesota recommends to-
day, and that is to take an imaginative 
and careful look at the possibility of 
using our ability to produce to take care 
of the needs of hungry people overseas. 
. Today I was talking with one of the 
world's leading nutritionists, Dr. Zabrel. 
He told me that there are now 3 million 
children who will die before the end of 
this year because of malnutrition or out-
right hunger; and that rate has con-
tinued annually for some time. 
It may be that the cause of death is 
not list,e0 as hunger. It may be that a 
child will be said to have died from 
chickenpox, influenza, or any one of the 
disemeOliat take the lives of children 
all over the ,world, but the reason chil-
dren die from those diseases?diseases 
youngsters in this country would throw 
off?is that they are so undernourished 
and poorly fed that they have no 
resistance. 
If today the American people were told 
that 3 million children were about to 
die because of some dramatic catas-
trophe, perhaps an earthquake or fam-
ine or flood, they would respond 
quickly. 
We would do everything we could. We 
would have our globemasters flying food 
to them. We would make our military 
forces available to help distribute it. 
We would bring ships out of the moth-
ball fleet and do whatever we could to 
make that food available. 
But we do not see the silent death 
occurring all over the world. Millions 
of men, women, and children drag out 
their lives undernourished and under-
fed, dying premature deaths, not being 
able to make a contribution to society 
because of the lack of energy that stems 
from bad diet. It is to that question that 
we must address ourselves as a nation 
that has been blessed and can produce 
food beyond our own needs. 
I commend the Senator from Minne-
sota for helping to open up this subject 
on the floor of the Senate. This is really 
the kind of war we ought to fight. We 
can win a war against hunger. It is 
the kind of wax the United States is 
better equipped to fight than any country 
in world history. 
The challenge is greater to meet than 
in the past. 
I welcome the opportunity to join the 
Senator from Minnesota in the magnifi-
cent effort he has made in the Senate 
this afternoon. 
Mr. MONDALE. I am highly grate-
ful to the distinguished Senator from 
South Dakota for his comments. He is 
universally regarded as the Nation's 
leader in this great fight. He was the 
first Food for Peace Director, receiving 
one of the first appointments made by 
the late President Kennedy, and thus he 
was responsible for shaping much of to-
day's program. Incidentally, he incor-
porated many new and creative ideas in 
the use of food to help children, to help 
build roads and schools by using food 
for wages, and to expand and encourage 
the participation of private charitable 
and religious organizations in food dis-
tribution. Our Nation will forever be in-
debted to him for his contributions, and 
also for the literature that he has 
written. This literature has helped more 
than that from the pen of any other 
man to develop this Nation's understand-
ing of the great problem which we con-
front in facing what can only be de-
scribed as a hunger explosion. 
The point that the Senator from South 
Dakota has made about seeing for the 
first time this silent hunger, as he so 
aptly described it, is the very core of 
the problem. If we have a neighbor 
down the street who is starving, every-
one responds. If people in American 
society are starving, and we see it, we 
respond without question. It is what a 
decent person does without question. If 
there is a disastex overseas?an earth-
quake, a tornado?time and time again 
our Nation has responded without ques-
tion to make available any resources we 
have to help those people in their hour 
of need. What is different with this 
silent hunger; this hunger that takes the 
lives of at least 10,000 people a day? It 
is silent; it is unseen; it is unknown. 
And it is not only death that we must 
prevent; we must relieve bodies and 
minds from malnutrition, not merely in 
the thousands, but in the millions. 
Mr. McGOVERN. The Senator knows 
that one of the unfortunate, permanent 
aspects of malnutrition is that when a 
youngster lives out the period of life 
after weaning until he is perhaps 5 or 6 
years old, with a bad diet, a diet lacking 
in protein, minerals, and vitamins, there 
is nothing that can be done in later life 
to correct the permanent damage that 
has been done to the physical and emo-
tional life of the child. That youngster 
will be warped for the rest of his life. 
The most critical period is from the age 
Of 1, after the child has been weaned, 
until he is 6 or 7 years old. 
One of the reasons why it is critical 
is that the child at that age is not old 
enough to fight for his share of -the food 
that is available. There is a mistaken 
notion- in many underdeveloped coun-
tries that the father ought to have the 
major share of the food because he Is 
working in the field and is doing the 
physical labor. The mother will care-
fully set aside the largest portion of food 
for the father. 
Actually, it is the little child that suf-
fers the greatest damage; it is the child, 
more than adults, that requires the most 
food and requires a balanced diet. So 
what we are talking about here is per-
haps most acutely the problem of chil-
dren. 
The Senator from Minnesota is quite 
correct in saying that if the American 
people had their way about solving this 
problem, they would perhaps be ahead 
of Congress. The American people are 
generous, moral people. What they need 
is more aggressive leadership from Con-
gress and more aggressive leadership 
from our policymakers downtown. They 
will quickly respond to the kind of pro-
gram that will harness our abundance in 
the cause of peace and freedom. 
I feel certain that the Senator's dis-
tinguished predecessor, who is now the 
Vice President of the United States, and 
who in many respects Is the father of the 
food-for-peace program, a man who 
stood on the floor of the Senate 10, 12, 
and 15 years ago, talking about the pos-
sibility of greater use of our food abun-
dance overseas, would be proud to hear 
the junior Senator from Minnesota, his 
successor, speak out as he has done to-
day. 
Mr. MONDALE. I deeply appreciate 
the Senator's kind comment. I cannot 
Imagine a program in which more in-
terests of Americans converge than this. 
It is not merely, our moral responsibil-
ity, which, in my opinion, ought to be 
enough. But we stand as the richest 
Nation in the world, the major surplus-
food-producing nation in the world, 
with incredible unused agricultural pro-
ductive power and surpluses being held 
at Government expense, while thou-
sands of people starve and millions have 
stunted physical and mental growth be-
cause of malnutrition. I do not believe 
we can live in that kind of world and 
respond in that way without being 
hated, just as our neighbor would hate

us if we did not help him when he was 
starving. 
Second, at a time when we are in a 
titanic struggle with the forces of com-
munism and other forces of dictatorship 
for the minds of men, surely we must 
know that it is hunger, illiteracy, dis-
ease, and poverty together which are our 
main enemies. It is the desperate acts 
of frustrated people who reach out for 
fanatical leaders that are our major 
problems. The use of American food in 
an enlightened, creative manner, and in 
the fullest sense, can help to destroy the 
very basis of our major enemy. 
Third, if we would use our best agri-
cultural productive power to help to 
meet the needs of the people of the 
world for food, we would give to our 
agricultural economy the lift it desper-
ately needs. 
Any Senator who represents a farm 
population cannot help being struck by 
the fact that farm people are fine, hard-
working Americans, investing their lives 
in their chosen profession, while receiv-
ing less than almost any other group 
for all they have contributed to the rest 
of American society. That is not fair. 
In addition, by using the surpluses to 
help nations to get on their feet, to build 
strong, viable economies and, hopefully, 
democracies, we have already demon-
strated that we can create new markets 
for industry and for farm products, as 
we have already done in Japan, Taiwan, 
Italy, Spain, and elsewhere. 
Thus, by helping them, in the long run, 
we will create markets that will 
strengthen our economy. 
Finally, I do not believe any nation, 
any strong Christian society such as 
ours, can forever ignore its moral re-
sponsibilities and remain fat in a starv-
ing world. We cannot fail to respond 
to the growing voice of humanity crying 
out for enough food to survive and get 
started. 
For all these reasons, I believe the time 
has come for our Nation to open its eyes 
and to take the steps necessary to be the 
kind of compassionate, humane Nation 
that I believe we can and must be. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING

NW' 
OFFICER,. The 
PEAR 
STAKE} ON 
=NAM 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, 
what I am about to do is not a pleasant 
task. It is probably not a wise task for 
anyone engaged in politics. 
Two of the outstanding columnists 
and the most widely read and respected 
columnists in the country are Walter 
Lippmann and Drew Pearson. 
Drew Pearson supplies something that 
is very badly needed. He is a muck-
raker. He does an excellent job. He ex-
poses scandals and situations involving 
weakness, inefficiency, incompetency, 
and dishonesty in our Government. He 
is a columnist who is widely read in my 
State. 
I regard him as a man of great in-
tegrity and ability, as a man of compas-
sion, and a fine human being. 
Like everyone else, Drew Pearson can 
be mistaken. It seems to me that in his 
column of Tuesday, July 27, he was very 
much in error in what he had to say. 
What he had to say can have a most 
unfortunate effect, I believe, on the atti-
tude of our people toward the war in 
Vietnam. 
I believe that he must be answered. 
Pearson made a series of statements 
about the situation in Saigon. I was 
deeply concerned aboUt those state-
ments. 
have sought, through my staff, to dis-
cuss the matter with members of the 
executive branch and the various de-
partments to find out what the facts are, 
or what our most competent and knowl-
edgeable people understand them to be. 
One of the assertions made by Drew 
Pearson was as follows: 
The South Vietnamese Army is suffering 
from such, wholesale desertions that it is 
risky to arm it The arms go over to the 
Vietcong. 
There is no evidence that the deserton 
rate is up. It has been fairly constant 
for years and is related generally to such 
factors as low pay or no Pay, poor com-
manders, difficulty of fighting, and un-
pleasant conditions. 
In the southeast Asian context, the 
desertion rate is not abnormally high. 
The Vietcong desertion rates, on the 
other hand, may very well be higher. 
However, this is very difficult to judge 
or to measure. 
The better index of the Vietnamese 
fortitude is casualties suffered by South 
Vietnamese armed forces: 26,000 have 
been killed in action in the past 4 years, 
and 51,00(1 have been wounded. 
In relation to population, this is 10 
times the rate of loss the United States 
of America suffered in Korea, and it is 
substantially above our total losses in 
World War II. 
The South Vietnamese have fought 
and endured for a long time. Pessi-
mistic out-of-context emphasis on a 
problem like desertion gives a mislead-
ing impression. 
The second assertion in Pearson's col-
tunn of July 27, 1965, is: 
The Saigon Government, always corrupt, 
always ineffective, might just as well be 
scrapped. 
This undocumented assertion does not 
reflect the views of our mission in Saigon, 
or of policymakers in Washington. Ky 
himself is not known to be personally 
corrupt, nor was his predecessor, Dr. 
Quat. Certainly no one here or there be-
lieves that the present government 
"ought to be scrapped." 
The third assertion by Drew Pearson 
Is as follows: 
American popularity once reasonably high, 
has nose-dived. It is now on a par with the 
anti-French feeling during the long civil 
war in French Indo-China. 
Mr. President, that is nonsense. There 
is no evidence to support this view. All 
signs, except Communist propaganda, 
point in the opposite direction. Ameri-
cans live as individuals or in small groups 
of two, three, or four all over Vietnam, 
working on AID projects, schools, in-
formation programs, and so forth, or, as 
military advisers. We would know 
quickly enough if they were no longer 
welcome. Quite the opposite is the case. 
Villagers and the local population are at 
pains to help and care for Americans. 
The Americans are, of course, targets 
for the Vietcong terrorists, but the rela-
tively low number of successful attacks 
against U.S. civilians proves that this 
Vietcong tactic does not have widespread 
popular support. 
Americans are working and fighting 
with the South Vietnamese for a cause 
defined and supported by them?not, like 
the French, against the Vietnamese to 
maintain a fading colonial empire. 
The fourth charge made by Drew Pear-
son was: 
Sixty percent of South Vietnam is now in 
the hands of the Vietcong, with many villages 
still supposedly loyal to the government prob-
ably actually disloyal. 
Mr. President, that is a misleading 
statistic. The Communists have vary-
ing degrees of control of substantial 
parts of the Vietnam land area, including 
much of the mountainous and less popu-
lous areas. Their control is largely 
negative in character. They can dis-
rupt and harass efforts by the South 
Vietnamese Government to exercise 
governing power in such areas. They 
can cut roads and bomb bridges. How-
ever, their control is not positive in the 
sense that they could not build bridges, 
repair roads, or carry on the normal 
processes of government unless the South 
Vietnamese Government permitted them 
to do so. 
The Vietcong do not have a single city 
or province capital. 
The strength of the Vietcong, such as 
it is, is among the peasants and rural 
population, a group that, in southeast 
Asia, as elsewhere, even in the rural 
United States, is traditionally mistrust-
ful of Central Government authority. 
Communists have exposed this trust, 
but have not shown that they, in turn, 
would have the positive support of the 
peasants if they sought to rule. 
When they try, and try to collect taxes, 
for example, the peasants quickly turn 
against them. The South Vietnamese 
Government has the support of virtually 
all the more educated people, and this is 
not to be written off lightly. All the 
major groups in South Vietnam: Cath-
olics, Buddhists, sects, labor unions, 
political parties like Dai Viet?oppose the 
Communists. They may have their dif-
ferences about the kind and complexion 
of government they want in Saigon, and 
their inability to unite behind a strong 
one is one of the chronic problems of 
South Vietnam. But this does not mean 
they prefer the Communist alternative. 
The last assertion by Drew Pearson is 
that the policy of bombing North Viet-
nam has been a complete failure. Mili-
tary supplies have continued to come 
down from the north. 
This is not the view of Pentagon ex-
perts and others who have studied the 
situation. Carefully pinpoint bombing 
has taken out a larg- portion of North 
Vietnam's logistical and military capa-
bility, especially as it relates to the war

in the south. There is very reason to 
think this has,made it significantly more 
difficult for Hanoi to supply and support 
the Vietcong. The shrillness of North 
Vietnam and Peiping propaganda?in-
cluding protestations that it has not af-
fected their will to fight?should not be 
taken at face value, any more than 
should their charges that we bomb hos-
pitals and civilian facilities?which we 
have not done. North Vietnam is a tight-
ly organized totalitarian society, with 
leadership concentrated in a few hands 
at the top. Those few, such seasoned 
Communists as General Giap, Le Duan, 
the party theoretician, and, of course, Ho 
Chi Minh himself, would be unlikely to 
tip their hand except for a purpose. And 
they are under no meaningful public or 
popular pressure at home, since they so 
totally control the means of communica-
tion and personal expression. Pearson 
seems to have made the elementary-mis-
take of taking Communist propaganda 
at its word. If North Vietnam really was 
not bothered by the bombing they would 
not devote so much of their diplomatic 
and propaganda effort to branding us as 
villians precisely because we bomb, and to 
trying to have pressure brought cn us by 
other countries to make us stop. 
There Is one other point mentioned 
by Drew Pearson. He states: 
The above facts show the contrast between 
war In Vietnam and war in Korea. In the 
Korean war, the United States was supported 
by a strong patriotic civilian population that 
gave full cooperation. We also had the ad-
vantage of a Korean army, much of it well 
trained and willing to fight. There was no 
problem of an enemy constantly disappear-
ing into the jungle. 
Pearson's memory in this respect is 
short. With all due respect to the valiant 
Koreans, things were not all that rosy 
then, either. The enemy was often hard 
to find, the South Koreans sometimes got 
tired of fighting, the ROK Army was not 
well trained or prepared when the war 
started?that was one reason North 
Korea invaded when they did?and to 
this day it is necessary for two U.S. di-
visions to stay there to protect Korean 
security and independence against fur-
ther or renewed Communist encroach-
ment. Even the origins of that was were 
not thought to be all that clear at the 
time. Has Pearson forgotten the exten-
sive Communist effort to make it appear 
South Korea started the war? This is 
a point ,the Communists, by the way, 
have never conceded. And the charges 
of germ warfare against us that were 
so widely believed among the neutral 
countries? Also, granted this was a 
splendid example of collective security 
under the U.N., let us not blind ourselves 
in retrospect by forgetting that this too 
was largely a U.S. effort in terms of 
numbers of forces and size of military 
coMmitrnent. 
? At a time when sq many of us are 
supporting the President in his efforts 
to persuade the United Nations to come 
into the South Vietnam situation, we 
should recognize that getting the U.N. 
involved will not be the end a our South 
'Vietnam fighting and dying. It re-
quired a long time after the U.N. came 
No. 138-24 I 
Into Korea to end that situation. It will 
be a help, but of limited military help. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have the appropriate part of the 
article by Drew Pearson entitled, "Bad 
News From Saigon" to which I have 
made reference printed at this point in 
? the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
BAD NEWS FROM SAIGON 
Here is some of the distressing news from 
Saigon that has caused the series of White 
House huddles over future policy. 
The South Vietnamese army is suffering 
front such wholesale desertions that it is 
risky to arm it. The arms go over to the 
Vietcong. 
-The Saigon Government, always corrupt, 
always ineffective, might just as well be 
scrapped. 
American popularity, once reasonably high, 
has nosedived. It is now on a par with the 
anti-French feeling during the long civil war 
in French Indochina. 
Sixty percent of South Vietnam is now in 
the hands of the Vietcong, with many villages 
still supposedly loyal to the Government 
probably actually disloyal. 
The policy of bombing North Vietnam has 
been a complete failure. Military supplies 
have continued to come down from the north. 
The above facts show the contrast between 
war in Vietnam and war in Korea. In the 
Korean war, the United States was supported 
by a strong patriotic civilian population that 
gave full cooperation. We also had the ad-
vantage of a Korean army, much of it well 
trained and willing to fight. There was no 
problem of an e rcriltsantly disappearing 
into the jungle 
LIPPMANN Re ON VI TNAM 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr/President, as 
for Walter Lippmann's criticisms, Mr. 
Lippmann's charges are less specific, and 
more generalized, but I think I can dis-
cuss them a little more briefly. 
Mr. Lippmann states that no Asia or 
NATO nation, supports us in the effort 
to help South Vietnam in its fight 
against Communist aggression. Is this 
the case? The answer is emphatically, 
"No." 
Great Britain has stated its support 
and has a police advisory team in Viet-
nam. Her prior commitments in 
Malaysia against 'similar aggression pre-
cludes her doing more. She is a member 
of NATO. Italy, a NATO member, sup-
ports us in Vietnam. It has sent a sur-
gical team there. West Germany, a vital 
NATO link, supports us. It has extended 
economic aid. 
The Government of Japan supports 
this stand against Communist imperial-
ism and has given considerable economic 
aid to South Vietnam. Korea, the 
Philippines, and Thailand support our 
action and have sent assistance as have 
Australia and New Zealand. 
Lippmann then goes on to say no vital 
American interest is involved in the de-
fense of Vietnam. It is not the same, he 
says, as when Hitler was in sight of the 
conquest of Britain or when Japan 
threatened the whole Pacific. Mr. Lipp-
mann ignores the fact that if the West-
ern Powers had stood firm in such places 
as the Rhineland, Munich, and Man-
churia, Hitler would not have stood in 
sight of Britain's conquest, nor would 
Japan have threatened their own western 
coast. But, unfortunately, there were 
people then who said that those places 
were not vital. People in authority 
listened to these councils and we paid a 
terrible price. Fortunately, Mr. Lipp-
mann's views do not command a similar 
following today. 
South Vietnam does not want to ac-
cept Communist domination. Ten years 
ago this country asked us to help them 
avoid this fate. We said yes to this plea; 
now Mr. Lippmann says it was a mis-
take. He forgets that a lot of other 
countries from Japan to France have 
made the same request and received the 
same reply. These "countries are now 
watching Vietnam to see just how much 
that reply was worth. The world is too 
small for us to make second class com-
mitments. 
This does not mean as Lippmann sug-
gests, that we are "policeman for man-
kind." It does mean that we should 
honor our commitments to assist a small 
country to resist aggression. It also may 
mean that in some cases we will carry a 
substantial part of the burden of resist-
ing such aggression, though I am confi-
dent we will continue to have the sup-
port of those everywhere who believe in 
peace and honest self-determination. 
Vietnam is not a decisive test, says 
Mr. Lippmann. Again, people said this 
about Czechoslovakia and Manchuria. 
Korea did not stop the defeat in Indo-
china, says Mr. Lippmann. Korea did 
onvince the Communist world that con-
ventional aggression was too risky. That 
is why they advocate now the type of 
aggression that won for them in Indo-
china in 1954. They must be made to 
realize that this type of aggression is 
also too risky. I fail to see how aban-
doning South Vietnam to the Commu-
nists of North Vietnam can do anything 
but encourage Communist reginles in 
North Vietnam, China, and Cuba in their 
belief that subversive aggression is 
profitable. 
I agree with Mr. Lippmann that these 
so-called revolutionary wars are difficult 
to deal with. I agree that it would be 
nice if we could cure the vulnerabilities 
that the Communists exploit rather than 
have to use military force to counter the 
aggression that takes advantage of these 
vulnerabilities. But to build a strong, 
viable state takes time. When the Com-
munists do not give the victim enough 
time, and resort to military aggression 
and subversion, then we will respond. 
This was the case in Greece and in 
Malaya. I cannot agree that we can 
leave to the Communists all those coun-
tries that suffer from the vulnerabilities 
of underdevelopment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the article of July 27 by Mr. 
Lippmann to which I have referred be 
printed at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

18176 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SEN 1965 
ASIAN WAR 
(By Walter Lippmann) 
We are about to pit Americans against 
Asians on the continent of Asia. Except 
for the diminishing and disintegrating South 
Vietnamese army, we have only token or 
verbal support from any Asian country. 
No great Asian power, Japan, India, or Pak-
istan, is aimed with us. None of our Euro-
pean allies is contributing anything beyond 
scattered verbal support. We have no man-
date from the United Nations as we had in 
Korea, none from NATO, none from the 
nations of this hemisphere. 
The situation in which we find ouselves 
Is unprecedented, and the best the adminis-
tration has been able to achieve by way of 
approval and support from our own people 
is a reluctant and depressed acquiescence. 
For there has been no proof, not even a real 
attempt to prove, that the security of the 
United States is vitally threatened in this 
war as it was, for example, when Hitler was 
in sight of the conquest of Britain and the 
capture of the British fleet, or when Japan 
with a great navy threatened to command 
the whole Pacific Ocean including Hawaii 
and the coast of California. 
Nations fight well when they are defend-
ing themselves, when, that is to say, they 
have a vital interest. It is the lack of an 
American vital interest which explains the 
current mood of depression and anxiety, 
which explains why our intervention in 
southeast Asia has for 10 years been so 
gingerly, so furtive, so inadequate. 
There are in truth two main reasons why 
we are becoming ever more deeply involved 
in Vietnam. The first, much the more 
powerful of the two, is a proud refusal to 
admit a mistake, to admit the failure of an 
attempt, begun 10 years ago, to make South 
Vietnam a pro-American and anti-Chinese 
state. More than anything else we are fight-
ing to avoid admitting a failure?to put it 
bluntly, we are fighting to save face. 
There is a second reason which weighs 
heavily with many conscientious people. It 
is a respectable reason. As stated by the 
New York Herald Tribune on Sunday: 
"We're in Vietnam at the express invita-
tion of the Vietnamese Government; we're 
fighting there for the Vietnamese people. 
But we're fighting also for the millions of 
people in the other threatened lands beyond, 
people who haven't the power to defend 
themselves from the Chinese colossus, and 
whose lives, safety, and freedom depend on 
the strong arm of the policeman?which only 
we can provide." 
My own view is that the conception of 
ourselves as the solitary policeman of man-
kind is a dangerous form of self-delusion. 
The United States is quite unable to police 
the world, and it is dangerous to profess and 
pretend that we can be the policeman of the 
world. How many more Dominican Repub-
lics can the United States police in this 
hemisphere? How many Vietnams can the 
United States defend in Asia? 
The believers in America as the world 
policeman get around these practical diffi-
culties by making an assumption?that what 
happens in Vietnam will determine what 
happens elsewhere in Asia, that what hap-
pens in the Dominican Republic will de-
termine what happens all over Latin Amer-
ica. This notion of the decisive test is a 
fallacy. The Korean war, in which we suc-
cessfully defended South Korea, did not de-
termine the outcome in Indochina. What 
we have done in the Dominican Republic will 
not protect any other Latin American country 
from the threat of revolution. 
Revolutionary wars are indeed dangerous 
to order and it is baffling to know how to 
deal with them. But we may be sure that 
the phenomenon of revolutionary wars, 
which is latent in all of the underdeveloped 
regions of the world, cannot be dealt with by 
American military intervention whenever 
disorder threatens to overwhelm the consti-
tuted authority. On the contrary, it is more 
like that in making Vietnam the test of our 
ability to protect Asia, we shall in fact 
provide revolutionary China with just the 
enemy it needs in order to focus popular 
hatred against us?a white, rich, capitalistic 
great power. We are allowing ourselves to be 
cast in the role of the enemy of the miserable 
and unhappy masses of the emerging 
nations.

bfIDWESTIRN STATES REFUSE TO 
BACK ROTTEN BOROUGH 
AMENDMENT 
Me. TIT/INGS. Mr. Preeddeut, the 
Indications are growing every day that 
the rotten borough amendment is los-
ing ground not only In the Senate but in 
the country. One after another colum-
nists, editorial writers, and other lead-
ers of public opinion are recognizing the 
=IVO dangers which the rotten borough 
amendment poses to our democratic sys-
tem. Perhaps the most significant Indi-
cation that the rattan borough amend-
ment is losing sUPOort throughout the 
country is the foot that the Midwestern 
Conference of the Council of State Gov-
ernments refused to adopt a resolution 
calling for the passage of ecnator Linea-
MN'S proposed amendment 
According to a report In the Wash-
ington Post of July 22. the Dirksel 
amendment failed for lack of a majority 
in the 12-member Council of State Gov-
ernments oist as It faued for lack of a 
Majority in the Senate JUDI/WM Com-
mittee. The Washington Poet reports 
that ti of the 12 Midwestern States fa-
vored the resolution calling on Congress 
to approve the rotten boroUgh &Mend-
ment. But six States refused to lend 
their consent to this resolutIon. Three 
of these six?Indiana, Iowa, and Michi-

the RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Arizona Republic, July 16, 19651 
A PARATROOPER IN VIETNAM PENS LEITER TO 
STonsmrs 
EDITOR, THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC: 
I am a 22-year-old paratrooper now serving 
with the 1'73d AirbOrne Brigade (Separate). 
My home address is 2412 North 37th Way, in 
Phoenix. I am writing this letter from the 
perimeter defense position around Bien Hoa 
Airbase, South Vietnam, and its question-
ing aspects are directed at a select few who 
are helping to fight this war on the home 
front. 
I must say though, that I am a little con-
fused as to which side is being supported, 
and whose cause upheld by some of our 
young and upcoming "intellectual soldiers" 
whose bases of operations are located at 
several of our institutions of higher learn-
ing. 
One of our most precious possessions is 
the freedom to challenge the policies of our 
Government, and keep those policies within 
the limits of our society's national feel-
ings. This freedom was borne to us from our 
Nation's birth through the careful actions 
and watchful minds of dedicated leaders and 
protected by the blood of thousands. 
It now seems evident that this freedom 
can be, and is being, undermined and abused 
in an ignorant display of rash actions, which 
do nothing but confuse the public and place 
a doubt in the minds of countries on the 
verge of communism as to the soundness of 
America's promise to defend them against 
ComMunist aggression. 
The un-American aspects of these demon-
strations, which are carried out by those who 
might occupy positions of leadership and re-
sponsibility in the near future, carry the 
traits of a possible dupe by an outside force. 
You would think that the countless broken 
Communist treaties, lies and anti-American 
attacks, and the stark nakedness of public 
Communist announcements, which state 
openly and coldly their intentions to crush 
us, would awaken minds and open eyes. 
From the Lao Dong Party in Hanoi, the 
Communist cry that the fighting in the south 
Is a matter for the South Vietnamese, has 
been heard all over the world. Seized Viet-
cong caches of Communist-supplied arms and 
ammunition, the extremely elaborate mili-
tary and political machine aimed at conquer-
ing South Vietnam, and the high pro-
portion of northern trained officers, enlisted 
men, specialists, and secret agents, reveal the 
Communist line_to be a giant mockery. It is 
a useless attempt to hide the fact that Hanoi 
Is behind the continuing campaign of aggres-
sion aimed at conquering South Vietnam. 
There exists in South Vietnam a large scale, 
careful11 directed, and Communist-supported 
program of armed attack on a sovereign state 
and a free people. 
Obviously, some students are so entangled 
In their efforts to reform: our international 
policies that they fail to see the danger. As-
sured by social and intellectual freedoms, 
they strike out viciously and defiantly at our 
National Government. Not only do they lack 
diplomacy, they infringe upon the rights and 
freedoms-of other citizens, and either do not 
care or have no conception of the ill effects 
our Nation suffers in the world spotlight. 
I only hope that when the demonstrations 
finally terminate, these students will add to 
their store of knowledge a recognition of the 
truth along with a valuable bit of experience. 
. Students should use their freedoms, take 
advantage of their rights, pry, disapprove, and 
question our Government's actions and make 
them conform to the will of the people. But 
before they pass judgment, they should take 
another look at our country's foundations, 
what we have fought and died for in the past, 
and what we stand for today. They should 
Approved FtrAtegiVeNt/OttEat-BDPEgglR4i4fR000300190008-1 
open their eyes and see who is trying to take 
this away from us. 
I have watched America's youth swelter on 
the decks and in the holds of troop ships and 
IST's. I have watched them rise from 
muddy pup tents, to construct through long, 
laborious days as clean and healthy a place 
to live as is possible in this environment. 
I've watched their bodies burn and tan under 
a merciless sun as they dug bunkers and 
mortar shelters. And at night they keep a 
vigilant watch in these same positions. 
They have dropped in convulsions from 
the heat, and died from Communist steel. 
They are fighting a dirty and nasty war, and 
they board helicopters willingly to hunt out 
an elusive enemy in their own territory. 
There is one thing I haven't slightest 
doubts about, Mr. Student, and that is these 
men's determination to stop communism 
here, on their own back doorstep. They 
know the score and this realization shows in 
their mental and physical willingness to 
fight. 
However, when I turn my eyes homeward, 
I see something ugly, and I don't like it. 
Where is the moral support enjoyed by other 
men in wars past won? Where is determina-
tion to stop communism? Don't sell us 
down the river, Mr. Student, you might re-
gret it. 
Pfc. JERRY P. LINSNER, 
APO, San Francisco, Calif. 
THE VAN ALEN SIMPLIFIED SCOR-
ING SYSTEM IN TENNIS 
Mr. FELL. Mr. President, recently in 
Newport, R.I., a lawn tennis tournament 
was conducted under VASSS the Van 
Alen simplified scoring system. This 
tennis tournament, which had in it such 
world famous professions as Rod Laver, 
Ken Rosewall, Pancho Gonzales, and 
Butch Bucholtz, was an experiment that 
may well pave the way to making tennis 
an even more generally enjoyed, watched, 
and participated-in sport than is pres-
ently the case. 
The VASSS system basically calls for 
scoring on a point system somewhat like 
table tennis with the first person to reach 
31 points winning the set. By previous 
stipulation a set can be decided by 21 
points or 41 points or any variable of 5 
plus 1, the unknown being divisible by 2. 
The VASSS system provides that the 
server shall stand 3 feet behind the base-
line, thus eliminating the advantage of 
the big server who normally would rush 
the net in order to put away the defen-
sive return on the first volley. Rather, 
there is substituted the longer rally 
which requires more emphasis on strat-
egy, experience, and precision as the 
players seek to maneuver each other out 
of place so that one of them can get in 
position for a winning shot. This longer 
rally also, I believe, provides the spec-
tator with a great deal more enjoyment. 
An additional advantage of the VASSS 
system is that it provides for the possi-
bility of handicaps, like golf. This means 
that an exciting game can be played be-
tween two players of very different abil-
ity. For example, one would start out
with a 10-point advantage over the 
other; but the winner of the set would 
be the first one who reached 31 points. 
This could make tennis far more enjoy-
able and would end the necessity of try-
ing to find people of almost equal ability 
with whom to play as is now so often 
the case. 
18137 
Finally, the frank relationship in this 
professional tournament of the points to 
money added to the excitement of the 
audience. In fact, on the scoring board 
where the points were listed, the scoring 
board also multiplied the points by 5, 
preceded by a dollar sign, to indicate the 
amount of dollars that had so far been 
won by each of the participants. 
The success of this tournament is 
shown by the number of people that it 
drew both in the day and at night. In 
fact, another trailblazing result was the 
Introduction of outdoor tournament 
night tennis playing. 
All told, I am glad to rise and com-
mend James Van Alen, president of the 
Newport Casino, for his efforts in cre-
ating a new scoring system and I hope 
paving the way for a further populari-
zation of tennis. I am particularly 
happy to congratulate him on his elec-
tion to membership in the National Ten-
nis Hall of Fame. James Van Alen has 
always been an activist and a doer and 
Is particularly qualified in the world of 
sports, having for many years been the 
court tennis champion of America. 
THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL 
AMENDMENT TO REAPPORTION 
STATE LEGISLATURES 
Mr. TYDINGS. Mr. President, in re-
cent weeks a number of editorials oppos-
ing the Dirksen amendment have come 
to my attention. I ask unanimous con-
sent to have inserted in the RECORD an 
editorial entitled "Thoroughly Bad Leg-
islation" from the Washington Afro-
American of July 20, 1965, and an edi-
torial entitled "Wait a While" from the 
Toledo Times. 
There being no objection, the editorials 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[Prom the Washington Afro-American, 
July 20, 19651 
_ THOROUGHLY BAD LEGISLATION 
No matter how ardently its reactionary 
proponents try to dress it up, the so-called 
Dirksen amendment would still be bad legis-
lation. 
For one thing It rests on the erroneous 
premise that people who live in rural dis-
tricts must be presumed to be more intelli-
gent, more patriotic, and overall better citi- , 
zens than those who dwell in the cities. 
It is on this faulty foundation, not sup-
ported by fact, that Senator DIRIESEN, the 
Illinois Republican, is asking Congress to 
overturn last year's Supreme Court decision 
that both houses of State legislatures must 
be apportioned on the democratic principle 
of one man, one vote. 
Mr. DIRKSEN'S proposal calls for one branch 
of the legislature to be apportioned on land 
area, cows, chickens, or other factors than 
people. It is an arrow aimed directly at the 
'70 percent of the Nation's population living 
in the cities. 
It is unabashedly designed to allow the 30-
percent minority of county dwellers to per-
petuate the rotten borough system of frus-
trating the legislative aspirations and needs 
of the urban majority. 
As much as they argue for its passage, 
backers of the amendment cannot justify it 
as being in the democratic tradition. It is 
patently discriminatory and does wholesale 
violence to majority rule. 
Moreover, as Maryland's Senator TYDINGS 
has so aptly pointed out, it would "carve out 
Approved For Release 2003/11/04 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000300190008-1 
18138 Approved For RVismaggibli/ MR687B0g3446%)0300190008-1, 
July 29, 1965 
an exception to the equal protection clause 
of the 14th amendment." 
Thus it would lower the safeguards at this 
constitutional bulwark on which a majority 
Of Supreme Court decisions outlawing racial 
discrimination rests. 
More directly, it would permit hard-core 
Southern States, faced with a growing col-
ored electorate under the newly enacted vot-
ing rights bill, to water down their voting 
strength under the Dirksen formula of 
counting factors other than people in allot-
ting legislative seats. 
It is not difficult to envision States like 
Alabama and Mississippi enacting apportion-
ment legislation brazenly designed to again 
disfranchise citizens on the basis of land-
ownership, wealth, education or race. 
There is nothing in the Dirksen amend-
ment, once enaeted, that would prevent such 
action, which no doubt explains why all of 
the old Confederate States are so enchanted 
with the scheme. 
Thus our stake in the impending Senate 
battle over the Dirksen amendment is even 
more vital than that of other citizens. 
For, if it is jammed through, we stand to 
lase not only our political strength in the 
=ajar northern cities, but in the Southern 
States as well. 
That is why it is so important for you to 
keep reminding your Senators that a vote 
for the Dirksen amendment is a vote against 
you and yours and one which you will not 
soon forget. 
[From the Toledo Times, July 14, 19651 
WAIT A WHILM 
The Dirksen. amendment over which the 
TJ.S. Senate soon will be fighting a battle 
royal is a watered down, spruced up version 
of the same name proposal that Minority 
Leader Evxarrr DIRICSEN first introduced last 
year to minify the Supreme Court's one-
man, one-vote ruling on State legislatures. 
As approved by a Senate subcommittee the 
proposal still would allow one house of a 
legislature to be apportioned on factors other 
than population. But it no longer would 
bar Federal courts from hearing suits chal-
lenging apportionment plans. And it would 
require a vote of approval at least every 10 
years by the people of a State which used 
nonpopulation factors for one of its legisla-
tive houses. 
The changes have brought the proposed 
amendment considerably more support than 
it originally commanded. Its passage is still 
uncertain, but the vote is bound to be close, 
since even such liberal spokesmen as Sena-
tors Jams of New York and ICuener. of 
California are now endorsing it. 
Part of this widespread sympathy for the 
amendment?which we are tempted to 
share?arises from recognition that fair rep-
resentation in a legislative body does not 
always COMA solely from numbers. This is 
most easily seen in States like California, 
Illinois, New York, arid others where the 
bulk of population is massed. in one or two 
great metropolitan centers. The Court's 
ruling, strictly interpreted, could create a 
tyranny of majority in which vast areas of 
a State had no voice in legislative affairs at 
all. 
What restrains us from wholehearted sup-
port of the Dirksen amendment is the evi-
dence?and there is plenty?that most of its 
supporter's are not really interested in fair 
solutions to apportionment problems. They 
want simply to salvage the old status quo of 
entrenched rural power that drove the Su-
preme Court reluctantly to get into the 
political thicket it had long avoided. 
It should not be forgotten?though the 
Courts' critics never mention it?that the 
tribunal invaded this field only because 
those in control of the States' apportionment 
machinery refused to do anything about the 
gross imbalances that had developed. Many 
of the same people who now leap to the de-
fense of the States' own laws and constitu-
tions showed no such high regard for them 
when reapportionment provisions were being 
violated decade after decade to protect vested 
political interests. 
So the' Supreme Court has, in effect, re-
stored to the States the right to devise sys-
tems of legislative representation which are 
fair now and can be kept so in the future. 
Of course it is not easy, especially for those 
with freakish distributions of population, 
But they should at least be given the chance 
before an amendment is added to the U.S. 
Constitution whicb, might only perpetuate 
abominations on the representative form of 
government. 
If experience shows the difficult problems 
of apportionment cannot always be worked 
out on the basis of population alone, that 
will be the time to consider a basic con-
stitutional change.

the Nation" program on Sunday, there had 
been doubts as to the Governor's political 
plans, and whether he intended to run for 
another term in Albany preliminary to tak-
ing a future stab at the presidential nomina-
tion which had eluded him twice before. 
His statement in Minneapolis, where he 
has been attending the Annual Governors' 
Conference, was straightforward and un-
equivocal. He will definitely seek a third 
term as Governor. He will not be a candi-
date for President. 
The Governor could have delayed his an-
nouncement for many months. By making 
his position clear now, he will give the Re-
publicans that much more time to pull their 
party together, in the hopes of avoiding a 
repetition of the 1964 disaster. 
Rockefeller served his party well by trying 
manfully to head off the nomination of Barry 
Goldwater. He might very well have ob-
tained the nomination himself if it had not 
been for the unfortunate lapse of judgment 
In the timing of his remarriage. Coming 
just as the presidential campaign was about 
to get underway, that event severely dam-
aged his political chances, especially among 
women voters. 
From then on, his drive for the nomination 
was an uphill and, as it proved, a losing 
struggle. While other moderate Republican 
leaders did nothing to stop the Goldwater 
surge except to lament it, Rockefeller and 
fought it out in the grueling heat of the pri-
maries. 
It is possible that certain of the Republi-
can leaders hoped that Rockefeller and 
Goldwater would knock each other off in the 
preoonvention battles, opening the door to 
their own nomination as compromise candi-
dates. The result in California dispelled that 
illusion, and the New York Governor found 
another act of courage called of him when 
he faced the roaring radicals of the Gold-
water galleries in the convention, and made 
his appeal for a decent platform on civil 
rights 
Governor Rockefeller has fought hard and 
well to keep the Republican Party where 
it belongs, and where it must stand if it 
is not to distintegrate, out of the hands of 
the extremists. He has made mistakes of 
political judgment, but not of the heart. 
He has never been short of that quality called 
courage. 
[From the Washington Post, July 28, 1965] 
GOP AND 1968?Romaerearseres DECISION 
PRAISED 
(By Roscoe Drummond) 
Muneraporas.?Three consequences flow 
from Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's action re-
moving himself?now and forever?as a pres-
idential candidate: 
1. It make it nearly certain that the 1968 
Republican nominee will be a political mod-
erate. 
2. It virtually rules out the danger that 
the remaining rivals for the GOP nomination 
will again get into such a lacerating contest 
that the moderated forces within the party 
would end up helplessly divided?as they 
were in 1964. 
3. Barring the emergence of another Wen-
dell Winkle who is less visible today than 
Mars, it narrow the probable choice to Gov. 
George Romney of Michigan, Gov. William 
W. Scranton of Pennsylvania, and perhaps 
former Vice President Richard M. Nixon. 
Each is qualified personally and politicedly. 
Any of them could get it. One of them al-
most certainly will. 
The potential cardidates of the two ft r-
therest apart wings of the party have both 
taken themselves out of the running. Barry 
M. Goldwater has said he would not seek re-
nomination. Now Rockefeller follows suit. 
These decisions in themselves shift the eyes 
of the party to its political center. 
It is no accident that Rockefeller chose the 
Governors' conference here in Minneapolis 
as the occasion to make his political an-
nouncement. He picked it deliberately ard, 
thereby, underlined the powerful role the 
GOP Governors have played in the past and 
can again play in deciding the party's presi-
idential nominee. 
All the most influential Republican Gov-
ernors are in the moderate-to-liberal wing. 
They include Volpe of Masschusetts, Chaff ee 
of Rhode Island, Rhodes of Ohio, Hatfield of 
Oregon, Smylie of Idaho, as well as Rocke-
feller, Scranton, and Romney. And, signifi-
cantly, they take in most of the populous 
States. 
This is a lot of political power at the 
center of the party. These Governors have 
probably learned enough from their pie-
convention experience of 1964 to realize that 
they cannot influence the presidential nomi-
nation at the last minute, that their power 
as leaders must be concerted?or dissipated. 
With both Goldwater and Rockefeller re-
moving themselves, the prospect is that the 
long-exercised power of the Governors will 
not be dissipated, that most of it will be 
mobilized behind a candidate who will re-
flect the moderate consensus. 
Rockefeller gave a good reason for taking 
himself out of the picture earlier than e as 
necessary. 
"I think," he said, "that in order to pull 
the party back together, to unite it, to make
