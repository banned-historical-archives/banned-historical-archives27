FOREWORD 
The purpose of this report is to present information available 
concerning the policies of the Chinese Communists towards the numerous 
ethnic and religious minority groups in China, particularly as these 
policies are reflected in the establishment of so-called autonomous 
administrative units. The scope of this report includes brief de-
scriptions of the minority groups, discussions of minority programs 
and their effectuation, and summaries of the autonomous administrative 
units in textual, tabular, and map form. Although brief summaries 
of the number, distribution, history, and economies of the more im-
portant minority groups are included, no attempt has been made to 
provide comprehensive ethnic studies. This report does not purport 
to present a detailed analysis of all the political ramifications of 
Chinese Communist policy towards minorities, nor does the study eval-
uate or compare Chinese Communist versus Soviet policies and interests 
in minority groups along the Sino-Soviet borderland.

AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENTS IN MINORITY-INHABITED AREAS OF COMMUNIST CHINA 
Summary 
An estimated 40,000,000 persons of China possess characteristics 
sufficiently different from the Han Chinese* to be classified as 
minorities. The largest concentrations of minority peoples occur in 
the frontier areas of northwestern and southwestern China. Politi-
cally, the three most important groups are the Mongols, Tibetans, and 
Muslims, of which some have long maintained varying degrees of irde-
pendence from the Central Government. Numerous aboriginal groups also 
inhabit southwestern China, where many of them live in isolation and 
seclusion from the Chinese. Major conflicts between minority grcups 
and the Chinese have been caused by the encroachment of Chinese agri-
culturists on areas traditionally inhabited by minorities, and by Chi-
nese attempts to secure political control over these areas. The un-
stable political conditions in recent decades also have contributed 
to tension between Chinese and minority groups. Every Chinese govern-
ment, including the Communist, has attempted to secure control of its 
minority-inhabited frontier areas. The most striking feature of the 
Communist efforts is the unprecedented speed and apparent effective-
ness with which these areas have been brought under the domination 
of the Central Government. 
* "Han" means Chinese by culture and language.

The Chinese Communists have adopted a program for minority peo-
ples calling for sweeping political, economic, and social changes. 
The major point of this program is the establishing of autonomous 
governments in minority-inhabited areas. Each autonomous unit is 
fitted closely within and subordinated to the Chinese administrative 
system, and the "autonomy" of an autonomous government is slight. 
An autonomous government is under the jurisdiction of an ordinary 
people's government (by definition a Chinese body), from which it 
receives "leadership" and "guidance." Autonomy is not granted spon-
taneously merely on the wishes of the local inhabitants; rather, a 
preparatory period of intense political indoctrination by specially 
trained cadres precedes the implementation of autonomy. Although 
most members of the governing organs of an autonomous government are 
of the particular minority, they have undoubtedly been indoctrinated 
with Communist gospel. Communist control of an autonomous government 
is further cemented by having a small number of Chinese on the staff 
and through the common practice of having the chairman of the autono-
mous government a party member, holding key positions in provincial 
and regional administrations- Further control of minority areas has 
been gained through the familiar Chinese practice of splitting minority 
groups into small, easily manipulated administrative units. 
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is one of the oldest of the 
autonomous units, administratively at a level comparable to the six

major administrative areas. Tibet and Sinkiang are expected to be 
granted regional autonomy at a comparable level. There are 13 auton-
omous units at the special-district level, perhaps 40 at the hsien 
(county) level, and several hundred at sub-hsien  levels. 
Attitudes and reactions of the minority people toward the Chinese 
Communist program are extremely difficult to assess. Some minority 
people, however, seem to have been won over, perhaps temporarily, to 
the Communist fold. The minority program of the Communists, with 
its stress upon educating and civilizing the minority groups, may 
well result in the gradual disintegration of the resistant minority 
core areas.

I. Minority Groups of China 
The population of China, according to a recent Chinese Commu-
nist source, totals 483,687,862. 1/ * Of this total an estimated 
30,000,000 to 50,000,000 persons possess cultural characteristics 
that distinguish them in some way from the dominant Han Chinese. 
The Chinese Communists list over 60 national minority groups through-
out China, with an aggregate population of about 40,000,000. ?../ Es-
timates of the minority population vary widely not only because 
adequate census data are lacking, but also because definitions vary 
as to the term "minority." The Communists, for example, include all 
Muslims, as a national minority. The Muslims, however, include both 
Chinese who have embraced Islam but in other ways are identical with 
ethnic Chinese, and non-Chinese groups who are differentiated from 
the Chinese by physical and linguistic characteristics. 
Although minority groups are found throughout all China, the 
major concentrations are in the frontier regions of northwestern and 
southwestern China, as shown on accompanying map, CIA 12666. Many of 
the minority people such as the Thai, Mongols, and others are linked 
ethnically with peoples in neighboring countries. Minorities in the 
five provinces of Northwest China (Kansu, Ningsia, Shensi, Tsingnai, 
and Sinkiang) reportedly number about 6,300,000 out of a total of more

than 23,000,000 people. In Southwest China (Kweichow, Sikang, 
Szechwan, and YUnnan Provinces), there are some 20,000,000 members 
of minority groups out of a total of over 70,000,000 people. In 
densely populated Central-South China, with a population of 137,000,000, 
there are about 8,000,000 additional minority peoples, largely con-
centrated in western Kwangsi with smaller numbers in Hunan and Kwang-
tung. In Northeast China (Manchuria) an estimated 1,200,000 Koreans 
are concentrated in the North Korea-Manchuria border area.* Some 
Mongol banners are located in Jehol Province, and a few scattered 
Tungusic communities are found in northern Manchuria. The minority 
population of North China consists of comparatively small numbers of 
Muslims and Mongols. Additional minority peoples include an estimated 
800,000 Mongols of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the 
1,000,000 Tibetans of Tibet. These Communist estimates are somewhat 
lower than most available statistics. 
Economy of the minority peoples varies with group and area. A 
few groups have an intensive agrarian economy not unlike the Chinese. 
Most groups, however, are either primitive agriculturists of the 
hillsides, animal herders of the steppe lands, or sedentary agricul-
turists of the oases. In the fluid transitional zones separating 
*The Communist figures cited above for minority groups are in 
general larger than most western estimates.

Chinese from minority groups, there is persistent conflict between 
the intensive Chinese economy and the various economies of minority 
groups. 
The degree of cultural assimilation of minority groups by the 
Chinese varies with the groups. At one extreme are minority groups 
who have resisted all Chinese attempts at control and have retreated 
to inaccessible areas to maintain independence from the Chinese. At 
the opposite extreme are tribespeople, usually few in number, who live 
in Chinese-dominated villages in the valleys and have largely adopted 
Chinese culture. Between the two extremes are groups who maintain 
some contact with the Chinese but retain most of their native customs 
and habits. 
A. Major Minority Groups 
1. Mongols 
The Mongol population of China is dispersed over a vast, 
crescent-shaped arc extending from northern Manchuria to northwestern 
Sinkiang. According to George B. Cressey, this region has an area 
of 2,545,000 square kilometers. V 
Mongol population statistics vary greatly, but a total of about 
2,000,000 is often given. The largest Mongol concentrations are in 
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR), an administrative unit 
created from western Manchuria and parts of the former provinces of 
Jehol and Chahar. Considering the area covered by the IMAR, the

S-E-C-R-E-T 
number of Mongols given in Communist statistics, 800,000, seems too 
low by several hundred thousand. Another 400,000 Mongols live in 
SuiyUan, Ningsia, northern Tsinghai, and parts of Kansu. An addi-
tional 60,000 Mongols are distributed in several areas of northern 
Sinkiang, as shown on accompanying map CIA 11519. 5/ A few Mongols 
reside in the portion of Jehel not incorporated in the IMAR and in 
other peripheral areas. The Mongol population is believed to be 
static or even declining, largely due to a high incidence of venereal 
disease and general lack of medical facilities. 
The Mongols are customarily divided into four main groups: 
northern, eastern, southern, and western. The northern and eastern 
Mongols are found in the northern part of the IMAR. The southern 
Mongols include the Ordos Mongols inhabiting southern SuiyUan, other 
Mongol groups in northern Suiyuan, and the Chahar Mongols who inhabit 
a major part of the IMAR. The western Mongols inhabit northern 
Sinkiang, northern Tsinghai, Ningsia, and parts of Kamm. These 
groups are further subdivided into leagues and banners, which are 
essentially tribal administrative units. Each league is customarily 
composed of several banners. 
The traditional Mongols are pastoral nomads entirely dependent 
for their existence upon the short steppe grasses. Mongol economy 
is based on mobility, since the scanty rainfall of the steppe area 
produces pastures that can support herds for only short periods.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
The felt-covered tents or yurts of the Mongols are of simple con-
struction and can be transported easily. The diet has little variety 
and is derived chiefly from animals. 
The ancient pattern of Mongol life has altered slowly owing to 
the gradual encroachment of Chinese colonists on their pasture lands 
during the past 50 years. The use of grazing lands for the immobile, 
intensive type of Chinese agriculture has forced the Mongols to search 
for new grazing lands, generally more restricted in area than the old, 
or to modify their traditional economy. Chinese traders operating 
in Mongol lands have also contributed to the disintegration of 
Mongol culture and political instability. 
2, Tibetans  
The political boundaries of Tibet include only a part 
of the area that is ethnically and linguistically Tibetan (see ac-
companying map CIA 12666). Tibet, as the term is commonly used to-
day, is often called Outer Tibet or sometimes Farther Tibet; the 
former Inner Tibet or Nearer Tibet was nominally incorporated into 
the Chinese administrative pattern with the creation of Sikang and 
Tsinghai provinces in 1928. Tibetan peoples occupy an area approxi-
mately 2,350,000 square kilometers in extent in northwestern Szechwan, 
and along the Kansu-Tsinghai border, as well as in Sikang, Tsinghai, 
and Tibet. Despite this vast territory and the widely scattered nodes 
of population, Tibetans are unified by language, the many dialects

generally being mutually understandable, and by the powerful domi-
nance of Tibetan Buddism. 
Population statistics for Tibetans, as for other minority peo-
ples, are inadequate and unreliable. The population of Tibet is 
estimated at from 1,000,000 (the latest Chinese Communist figure) to 
3,000,000 with 1,500,000 most commonly quoted. Total Tibetan popu-
lation of all China is generally estimated at between 2,500,000 and 
3,000,000, which agrees with statistics recently published in a Com-
munist newspaper. 6/ The Tibetan population of Sikang probably ex-
ceeds 600,000; Communist reports give a figure of 500,000 Tibetans 
inhabiting the Tibetan Autonomous District of Sikang, which comprises 
only a portion of the province. 1/ Another 600,000 to 700,000 Tibetans 
live in Tsinghai Province. 
Tibetans are divided on the basis of two distinct economies into 
(1) the nomadic tribes inhabiting the steppe and high plateau grass-
lands, and (2) the sedentary agriculturists cultivating the isolated 
valley bottoms. The pastoral nomad tribesmen of the 'black: tents" 
are culturally quite different from the sedentary cultivators of the 
earthen houses. High-altitude farming is carried on in some areas, 
particularly the valleys and depressions near Lhasa. This consists 
of raising a few hardy cereal crops, often combined with the grazing 
of yaks, sheep, and goats. 
In the borderlands separating ethnic Tibetans from ethnic Chinese, 
Chinese agriculturists have recently been penetrating traditional

Tibetan lands. The penetration is not on so large a scale nor so 
successful as the Chinese encroachment on grazing lands of the Mongol 
steppes. The ;borderland between Tibetans and the Chinese is predomi-
nantly an area of high mountains, great river gorges, and isolated 
and almost inaccessible fertile valley bottoms. In much of this area 
live semi-independent tribal groups, apparently of Tibetan mixture, 
who long have functioned as buffer groups between the Chinese and 
the Tibetans. 8/2/ 
3. Muslims  
The Muslims of China are divided into two groups: (1) 
Chinese Muslims, a people of mixed racial characteristics who speak 
Chinese and are followers of Islam, and (2) non-Chinese Islamic peo-
ple chiefly of Turkic descent. The Chinese Communists regard both the 
Chinese and non-Chinese Muslims as one minority nationality. Although 
the Muslims are scattered throughout all of China, the main concentra-
tions are in the Northwest, particularly Sinkiang Province where most 
of the non-Chinese Muslims reside. Outside of the Northwest, the 
largest concentrations are in YUnnan and Hopeh. 
Estimates of the total Muslim population vary tremendously, from 
8,000,000 to 48,000,o0o. The latter figure is often cited by Muslim 
leaders. The official Jen Min Jih Pao, Chinese Communist news organ, 
gives a figure of about 10,000,000 for the nine "Islamic nationalities" 
in China, including (1) 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 hui-tsu, or Chinese

Muslims; (2) about 4,000,000 non-Chinese Muslims in Sinkiang; and 
(3) about 200,000 non-Chinese Muslims in other parts of China. 10/ 
A recent non-Chinese source gives a total of 8,300,000 Muslims, includ-
ing 4,700,000 Chinese Muslims and 3,600,000 non-Chinese Muslims. 11/ 
Approximately 5,000,000 Chinese Muslims are scattered through-
out China; somewhat over 2,000,000 inhabit Kansu, Ningsia, and 
Tsinghai. The latter are the most important and cohesive of the 
Chinese Muslim groups in China. These people are descendents of Arab 
merchants who entered western China in the seventh and eighth cen-
turies. Although much of their material culture has been derived 
from the Han Chinese, they have retained, in addition to their reli-
gion, certain customs and traits definitely setting then apart from 
the Chinese. The Muslims usually live in communities apart from the 
Chinese, but differ Little from them economically. A few occupations, 
however, such as innkeeper, trader, and soldier, attract a much larger 
proportion of Muslims than Chinese. 
Two small but important non-Chinese Muslim groups are located 
in the Kansu-Tsinghai border area -- the Salars and the Tung-hsiang. 
The Salars are a group of Turki-speaking peoples who cam? from Samarkand 
during the 12th century and live southeast of Hsi-ning (Sining), the 
capital of Tsinghai. Their numbers are variously estimated at from 
100,000 to 300,000. As a group they have resisted Chinese accultura-
tion and have figured prominently in Muslim revolts against Chinese

authority. The Tung-hsiang or "East Country," Muslims inhabit a 
triangular area formed by the juncture of the Yellow and Tao rivers 
in Kansu Province, near the Tsinghai border and south and east of 
Lan-chou (Lanchow), the capital of Kansu. The number of Tung-hsiang 
Muslims is thought to be about 200,000. They speak a Mongolian lan-
guage and are probably of Mongolian racial stock. 121 Like the Salars, 
the Tung-hsiang Muslims have remained a militantly resistant and 
homogeneous community and have played important roles in recent Muslim 
uprisings. In the Tung-hsiang area is the city of.Lin-hsia, important 
to the Muslims as the religious and cultural center of Islam in North-
west China. 
By far the majority of non-Chinese Muslims are the Turkic peo-
ples of Sinkiang Province. They will be discussed in greater detail 
in section I-C of this report. 
B. Southwestern China Minority Groups 
An estimated 16,000,000 to 20,000,000 aboriginal people dwell 
in large sections of Itinnan, Kweictlow, and KVangsi Provinces and in 
smaller sections of Sikang, Hunan, Szechwan, and Kwangtung Provirces. 
The largest of these minority groups are the Thai, the Yl-chia, and 
the Miao. Most of the minority groups of Southwest and Central-;.louth 
China originally inhabited all of southern China. Under the pref;sure 
of an advancing Chinese frontier, these groups have migrated into the 
wilder and more remote areas, consisting principally of dissected

tableland, characterized by steep slopes, deep valleys, and relatively 
Little level land. While most of the tribesmen are primitive farmers 
and hunters of the hills, some who live in the valleys have an economy 
similar to the Chinese. 
1. Thai (Tai) 
The Thai, or Tai, people and related groups are located 
In southern China, primarily in the provinces of Yannan, Kwangsi, and 
Kweichow and on Hainan Island. Approximately 2,000,000 each are found 
in Kweichow and KWangsi, and from. 2,000,000, to 5,250,000 in Ydnnan. 14/ 
Approximately 250,000 Li people, thought to be related to the Thai, 
inhabit Hainan island. The Thai do not form a single homogeneous group, 
but are scattered in several areas, as shown on accompanying map CIA 
12666. They are known by various names such as the Chung-chia (in 
Kweichow), and the Shui (in YUnnan). 
Although Thai groups speak various dialects, they are mutually 
intelligible, as well as intelligible to Thai-speaking people of Indo-
china, Thailand, and Burma. 15J Unlike most other southwestern minori-
ties the majority of Thai live in the valleys. In southena Yiinnan, 
where important groups live, the Chinese fear the malaria-ridden val-
leys and thus remain in the more healthy uplands. 16_./ Most of the 
Thai are sedentary agriculturists, growing irrigated rice in much the 
same manner as the Chinese. Because of the cultural similarities be-
tween the Thai and Chinese and the general tractability of the Thai, 
assimilation by the Chinese is taking place with greater ease than in 
the case of most other minority groups. 17/

2. Yi-chia (Lob o or Nosu) 
The Yi-chia, more commonly known as Lob o or Nosu, are 
found in greatest numbers in the border area between southeastern 
Sikang and southwestern Szechwan. They are also scattered throughout 
much of Ylinnan and in western Kweichow. Yi-chia population statistics 
range from slightly more than 1,000,000 to a recent Chinese Communist 
estimate of 3,400,000. 18/ The most cohesive Yi-chia groups inhabit 
the Ta-hang Shan area, which includes part of southeastern Sikang 
and small adjacent areas of Szechwan and YUnnan and is known as "In-
dependent Lob o Land." In this remote area of high, rugged mountains 
cut by steep gorges, the Yi-chia have remained isolated and virtually 
independent of Chinese rule. The population of so-called Independent 
Lob o Land is estimated to be from 250,000 to well over 1,000,000. 19/L1/ 
The Yi-chia are primarily upland dwellers, settling above 6,000 
feet. The type of farming they practice is intermediate between the 
shifting "slash and burn" system of most Miao groups and the ploy 
system of the Thai. 21/ Yi-chia areas of Yiinnan, which have more 
contact with the Chinese, are gradually adopting Chinese culture. 
3. Miao 
Recent estimates of the Miao population in China give 
a total of 3,500,000. .?2/LV Approximately two-thirds of the Miao 
are concentrated in the mountainous areas of KYeichow Province, chiefly 
in the east. Another Miao concentration is in western Hunan Province

where approximately 300,000 live. 2).il Miao groups also occur in 
southern and eastern YUnnan Province and scattered small. groups in-
habit adjacent provinces. The original home of the Miao is thought 
to have been in the central coastal areas of China. Expansion by the 
Chinese south and west has forced them to their present mountainous 
retreats. They have been present in YUnnan supposedly only within 
the past 100 years, perhaps indicating a continuing movement to the 
south. 25/ Relations with the Chinese have been unsettled, as evi-
denced by Miao uprisings during the 18th and 19th centuries. The 
Last Miao rebellion was quelled in 1871. In Chinese society the Miao 
occupy a low status, lower than most other minority groups. 26/ 
The Miao are characteristically primitive shifting hillside ag-
riculturists who follow a "slash and burn" system of fanning. The 
few Miao living on the lower slopes are plow farmers cultivating rice. 
Miao groups are usually differentiated on the basis of dress, such as 
the Black Miao, White Miao, and Flowery Miao. 
4. Other Southwestern Minority Groups 
In addition to the three large minority groups, several 
lesser groups have been identified in southwestern China. Widely 
scattered throughout the provinces of Hunan, Kwangsi, Kweichow, YUnnan, 
and Kwangtung are some 500,000 to 600,000 Yao. ?2,/ The Yac language 
is closely related to the Miao. Dwelling chiefly in the mountains, 
the Yao have a subsistence type of agricultural economy similar to 
that of other minority groups of the southwest.

The Mo-so, or Na-khi, with a population estimated at 300,000, 
are concentrated in the mountainous country of northwestern YUnnan 
and also occupy southern Sikang and Szechwan. Mo-so settlements 
consist of terraced fields with rock walls, at elevations ranging from 
6,000 to 10,000 feet. Subsistence agriculture, herding, and a little 
mining are the main economic activities. The Mo-so have in the past 
been victimized by the Tibetans, Chinese, and Yi-chia alike. 
The Min-chia are concentrated in the plains of Ta-li in western 
Yunnan. Although Chinese Communists recognize them as a minority 
group, culturally they differ little from the Chinese. They do klave 
a distinctive language, but most of them also speak Chinese. UnLike 
most minority groups of the southwest, the Min-chia are primarily 
rice farmers. 
Other minor groups include a few thousand Li-su and Lu-tzu, 
shifting agriculturists of the Salween River Valley near the northern 
Burma border, and the La-hu of southwestern YUnnan. A number of tribes 
of Tibetan descent live in northwestern 'Yunnan, eastern Sikang, and 
northwestern Szechwan. They have a combined or fused Tibetan-Chinese 
culture and act as buffer tribes between Chinese and Tibetans. There 
are also an indeterminate number of Chinese Muslims in southwestern 
China particularly in Iiinnan, who are descendents of Arab sea traders. 
Except for the traditions of Islam, which are somewhat indifferently 
observed, these southwestern Chinese Muslims are culturally identical 
to the Chinese.

C. Minorities of Sinkiang 
Sinkiang, the most ethnically diverse and complex of all the 
provinces of China (see accompanying map CIA 11519), is also the larg-
est, being comparable to Texas in extent. Its population of about 
4,000,000, however, is relatively small. The proportion of ethnic 
Chinese is likewise small, approximately 6 percent of the total. 29/ 
Sinkiang is a land of high mountain ranges and vast semiarid or arid 
depressions. Outside of a few merchants, officials, traders, and 
soldiers, most of the inhabitants are either sedentary agriculturists 
growing a fairly wide variety of crops in the irrigated oases, or 
nomadic herders of the grassy steppes and mountain valleys. 
The largest of eight ethnic groups in Sinkiang is the Turki, or 
Uighurs, who number more than 3,000,000. 22/ The Turki live chiefly 
in oasis cities rimming the Tarim basin, principally the larger towns 
of the southwest. They comprise the largest non-Chinese Muslim group 
within China. The second largest ethnic group is the Kazaks, also 
Muslims, numbering approximately 425,000 and concentrated in north-
western Sinkiang. 31/ They are primarily a nomadic people, although 
farming is often combined with herding. Closely related to the Kazaks 
are the Kirghiz, also a nomadic people, who likewise are followers of 
Islam. They number only about 60,000 and are concentrated in the 
mountain valleys of southwestern Sinkiang. 32./ The remaining minority 
groups, comprising about 5 percent of the population of Sinkiang, or

200,000 people, include the Tungkans (Chinese Muslims) estimated 
at 100,000, the so-called White Russians, Mongols, Tadjiks, and Manchus. 
Rebellions against Chinese authority have occurred, and general re-
lationships of the various nationalities with the Chinese have been 
turbulent and complex. The close linguistic, religious, and othe-,-
cultural ties of the people of Sinkiang with people across the bo,.der 
in the Soviet Union has contributed to the complex political situation 
of this area. 
D. Lesser Minority Groups 
In Northeast China (Manchuria) there are about 1,200,000 
Koreans, the majority inhabiting southeastern Kirin Province near 
the North Korean boundary. Many of these Koreans entered Manchuria 
during the Japanese occupation as a part of a Japanese-sponsored immi-
gration program, and the majority make their living as rice farmers. 
In the northern forested areas of Manchuria live the Tungus-c 
tribes, such as the Manchus, Oronchons, Goldi, Solons, and Daghors. 
The great majority are nomadic hunters of fur-bearing animals. The 
Manchus, once the rulers of all China, have nearly all been assimilated 
into Chinese culture, and only a few small groups retain a separite 
ethnic identity. 
In Kwangtung and Kiangsi are an estimated 12,000,000 Hakkas, or 
"guest families." Di Hakka origins are obscure; apparently North 
China was their original home. Although the Hakkas speak a peculiar

dialect and do not marry Cantonese, they are in other respects sim-
ilar to Chinese groups. Apparently the Chinese Communists do not 
consider the Hakkas a mincrity nationality. 
E. Relationships Between the Chinese and Minority Groups 
Relations between the Chinese and the non-Chinese minority 
groups have been conditioned by the inherent Chinese belief in the 
superiority of Chinese civilization and culture. Chinese annals give 
little definitive information on the diverse minorities of south-
western China but group all, without distinction, under the rubric 
Man 'barbarian." 34/ The struggle between Chinese and non-Chinese 
groups has continued throughout much of Chinese history. Expanding 
from their cultural core in North China, the Chinese have come in 
conflict with-different racial and cultural groups. Despite the 
long periods of conflict between Chinese and non-ChineEe peoples, 
the Chinese have been able to absorb many of the non-Chinese peoples 
with varying degrees of difficulty. Political and cultural conflicts 
also occur between individual minority groups -- Tibetan versus Muslim 
for example -- and feuds between tribes of the same minority group 
are common. This hostility within a minority group has often been 
exploited by the Chinese to control minority-inhabited areas. 
In general, non-Chinese who are in a distinct minority are 
regarded by the Chinese with curiosity and tolerance. Chinese

? 
attitudes toward non-Chinese are likely to be more antagonistic, 
however, where non-Chinese are in the majority, especially if they 
compete economically. 
The history of Chinese-minority group relations in recent times 
has pivoted about the particular political situation of the momert 
and economic expansionism. Control by the Central Government in the 
minority-inhabited frontier provinces has often been weak and in- . 
effective. In the border provinces local war lords, whose only motive 
was exploitation of the area they controlled, have held sway for 
long periods of time and have often treated minority groups oppres-
sively. Even when the Central Government was able to administer 
minority-inhabited border areas effectively, the treatment of minor-
ity peoples by Chinese officials has not been good. Particularly 
turbulent relations have existed between Muslims and Han Chinese. 
During the 19th century and continuing into the present century a 
series of prolonged and bloody Muslim revolts took place, chiefly in 
the northwest but to a lesser extent in other parts of China as Well. 
The history of Tibetan-Chinese relations in the present century has 
likewise been punctuated by sporadic warfare as the Chinese attempted 
to extend their control into areas traditionally under Tibetan rule. 
A factor often contributing to the political instability of 
region has been the expansion, particularly in the past 50 years, of 
an intensive Chinese agrarian economy into bordering steppe lands

most suitable for extensive nomadic herding. The results of this 
program of economic expansionism have been increased -:ension between 
Chinese and minority groups and alterations in the economic and so-
cial life of both Chinese and minority groups. The removal of the 
protective cover of grass has converted some of the semiarid steppe 
lands into barren wasteland.

II. Evolution of Autonomous Units 
A. Minority Programs 
After the overthrow of the Manchus in 1911, the first pronounce-
ment regarding the status of minority groups within China was voiced 
by Sun Yat-sen. His views later were embodied in Article 5 of the 
provisional constitution of 1912, which stated that "citizens of the 
Chinese Republic are all equal, and there shall be no racial, class, 
or religious distinctions." According to Sun Yat-sen, there were 
five major racial stocks -- Han Chinese, Manchus, Muslims, Mongols, 
and Tibetans -- and each race was to be permitted to retain and 
develop its culture. Although the Nationalist Government espoused 
this principle, the inherent belief in the superiority of the Han 
Chinese was so.deep-seated that equality was never accorded to 
minority groups. In 1928 a Commission on Mongolian and Tibetan 
Affairs was created with ministerial status directly under the Exec-
utive Yuan; but the chaotic political and military conditions in the 
following years negated any comprehensive program for these areas. 
A general statement of Chinese Communist policy toward minori-
ties is contained in the Common Program of the Communist Central 
People's Political Consultative Council (CPPCC), adopted 3 October 
1949. The Common Program is one of the three documents that collec-
tively comprise the constitutional basis of the Chinese Communist 
Government. Article 9 of the Common Program consists of the simple 
statement that "all nationalities of the People's Republic of China 
-23 -

S-E-C-R-E-T 
have equal rights and duties." Article 9 is thus similar to Article 
5 of the provisional constitution of 1912. The blueprint of Commu-
nist policy toward minority groups, however, is contained in a sepa-
rate chapter of the Common Program consisting of Articles 50 through 
53. Article 50 is the most important and contains the following 
statements: 
All nationalities within the boundary of the People's Republic 
of China are equal. Unity and mutual help shall be effected 
among them to oppose imperialism and the public enemies 
within these nationalities so that the People's Republic of 
China will become a big family of fraternity and 2ooperation 
of all nationalities. Greater nationalism and chauvinism 
shall be opposed and acts of discrimination, oppression and 
splitting the unity of the various nationalities shall be 
prohibited. 
Article 51 concerns the establishment of regional autonomy by which 
"nationalities" shall have "appropriate" representation. in the "local 
organs of state power." Article 52 states that "nationalities" have 
the right to join the People's Liberation Army and organize local 
people's public security forces. Article 53 states that national 
minorities have the freedom of developing their languages and pre-
serving or "reforming" their customs, habits, and religious beliefs. 
This Article also states that the People's Government shall help the 
nationalities develop their political, economic, cultural, and educa-
tional systems. 
The General Minority Program of 8 August 1952, which is repro-
duced in full as Appendix A, is the basic document follawed by the

Communists in implementing their minority policies.* In Article 2 
statements that "autonomous regions of the various nationalities are 
an integral part of the People's Republic of China" and that "the 
self-governing organs of the autonomous regions" are under "the 
leadership of the People's Governments of a higher level" reveal 
that no real autonomy is vested in an "autonomous" government. 
Article 7 states that the administrative status of an autonomol4s 
area will be equivalent to that of present units of the Chinese 
administrative system according to the size and population of the 
minority-inhabited area. Thus, the autonomous areas function as 
part of and within the highly centralized framework of the Chinese 
Communist administrative system. In the Communist administrative 
pattern, each level of government is responsible to and must obey 
each higher level, and all levels are under the jurisdiction of the 
Central People's Government. Article 12 provides for the inclusion 
of a Han Chinese on the staff of the autonomous governing organ. 
In practice, a Han Chinese usually acts as a vice chairman. Un-
doubtedly, the Chinese members of the autonomous government are 
trusted Party members who can be relied upon to "direct" the govern-
ment along proper channels. Chapter 4 has several articles con-
cerning autonomous rights, such as use of the particular minority 
*Two important reports touching upon most aspects of the minority 
program were released in August 1952, one by Li Wei-han, Chairman of

language or dialect by the autonomous organ of government in dis-
charging its duties. Chapter 6 is significant for the statement 
that the "People's Government of a higher level" is directed to as-
sist the self-governing organ of an autonomous area in carrying out 
its various duties. In Article, 35 of Chapter 6 the people's govern-
ment of a higher level is instructed "to assist the various nation-
alities to establish the concepts of equality, friendliness, unity, 
and mutual aid among one another, and to rectify the various 'isms' 
which favor dominating nationalities and narrow nationalism." A 
list of rights for "scattered" minority groups was issued concurrently' 
with the General Minority Program. 
Analysis of the General Minority Program reveals that each 
autonomous government is a component of the closely knit adminis-
trative system, supervised and "assisted" by the next higher adminis-
trative organ Ultimate authority and direction rests with the 
Central People's Government. The government of an autonomous area 
has no more autonomy than that of the standard administrative unit. 
At the August 1952 meeting of the Central Government Council, 
provisional general rules were approved regarding organization of 
committees of minority affairs. 37/ These committees have the duty 
of directing and supervising work in minority-inhabited areas. They 
are to be established, based on the need of minority work, at all

levels of administration from the administrative-area level through 
to the hsien. Minority affairs of administrative units with only a 
small number of minority people are administered by special off ices 
or persons, rather than committees. Each of the committees of minor-
ity affairs is subordinate to and under the jurisdiction of the com-
mittee at the next highest administrative level. All committees 
are under the direction of the Commission on the Affairs of National 
Minorities, which is subordinate to the Political and Legal Affairs 
Committee of the State Administrative Council.* In principle, each 
of the national minorities is represented on the Commission according 
to population. The Commission is organized into four regional d:vi-
sions plus a division to administer Tibetan affairs. 
B. Methods Employed in Implementing Autonomy 
1. Political Indoctrination  
Although Chinese Communist policy varies with area, 
situation, and the minority group, generalizations can be made re-
garding the methods employed in implementing regional autonomy. In 
all areas of China firm military control has preceded political pro-
grams. 
The State Administrative Council, analagous to the Soviet 
Council of Ministers, is one of the four subsidiary organs of the 
Central Government Council. The Central Government Council is a 
top-level policy-making and administrative organ with broad legis-
lative, executive, and appointive powers.

In 1950 several teams were dispatched from Peking tc classify 
minority groups, estimate their population, and gather pertinent 
information relative to conditions in the area. 38/ Undoubtedly 
these teams initiated indoctrination of the tribespeople on the 
beneficent policies of their "big brothers." One repoA states that 
the teams met with considerable success in explaining Communist aims. 
39/ 
The initial surveys have been followed by more intensive in-
doctrination, such as sending native leaders to schools for brief 
political training. Reports also state that local minority leaders 
were given "grand tours" of large cities to impress them with the 
achievements of Communism. 4CV Theoretically, tribal leaders re-
turn to their people enthusiastically spreading the Conmunist gospeL. 
To prepare minority areas for autonomy, intensive -political 
indoctrination is carried out by specially trained cadres. To train 
these cadres, a Central Institute of Nationalities was established 
in June 1951 at Peking. Subsequently eight branches have been 
opened in Canton, Ch'eng-tu, Klun-ming,,Kuei-yang, Lan-chou, Nan-ning, 
Ti-hua, and Wu-ch'ang. 4l/ Selected.students take required 
courses, such as "the Chinese Communist Party" and "Nationalities 
Policy and Problems," for a period of about 10 months. 13/ 441 After 
completion of their training, cadres are organized and sent out to 
instruct, indoctrinate, and prepare the area for eventue.1 autonomy.

Apparently these Communist-trained natives will gradually replace 
traditional tribal leaders. As a rule, cadres do not return to their 
native villages. A reported 70,000 minority-nationality personnel 
have been trained by the Institute. 45/ In addition to training 
cadres, the Institute and its branches do research in the various 
minority languages, so that magazines and books may be disseminated 
in these languages. 
After indoctrination and training has progressed in the minority 
area, preparatory committees for the implementation of autonomy are 
organized. At a conference held prior to the establishment of one 
autonomous area, the requirements for a "qualified" delegate to the 
autonomous government were described as follows: 
A delegate must be a supporter of the Common Program, 
the policy on nationalities, Chairman Mao, the Chinese 
Communist party, and the Central People's Government. He 
should be a patriot, an ardent fighter against imperialism 
the enemy of the people -- and a man who will maintain close 
contact with the people and render them his best service. . . 46/ 
With such a slate of delegates, speedy legislative action would'ieem 
to be foreordained. 
In some areas, small administrative units at the hsien level or 
below are organized into model autonomous units. In the words oC a 
Communist news report, these units are designed "to afford examples 
of nationalities democratic political construction for the people of 
various nationalities and to penetratingly carry out propaganda work

on the nationalities policy." /.12/ The model autonomous units are 
Later incorporated into larger autonomous areas. 
The day when an autonomous area is officially proclaimed is 
one of celebration. When the Thai Autonomous District in southern 
Yunnan was established, "over 10,000 persons . . . from a distance 
as far as 200 li . . . Lcarried7 out recreational activities, such 
as boating, elephant play, dancing and film shows." 48J 
2. Economic and Cultural Measures 
The Communists have employed various economic and cul-
tural measures to gain the support of minority groups and to further 
basic Communist policies. 
Economically, Communist policy is one of favoritism toward 
minorities. Prices received by minorities for their goods have been 
raised; and conversely, prices paid by minority people for cloth, 
salt, tea, and other essential goods have been lowered. To implement 
this policy, mobile trading teams have been dispatched to the more 
remote areas, and government-operated trading companies have been 
established in traditional market towns. Other measures have in-
cluded the providing of "farm equipment," such as the reported issu-' 
ance since 1951 of some 95,700 farm implements of unspecified type to 
peasants of the Tibetan Autonomous District of Sikang Province. 4/ 
Likewise, in Sikang "agrotechnical" stations have supposedly been 
set up in 12 hsien (counties). 50/ Many Communist attempts to modernize 
agricultural techniques in the minority areas have also been reported.

One of the over-all Chinese Communist goals is to reduce 
ilJit-
eracy. To that end educational facilities for both adults and 
children have been expanded, particularly in minority-inhabited 
areas. Increased school attendance in these areas has been report-
ed. 51/ A report from the Northwest states that adult herdsmen and 
peasants are "actively attending winter schools and spare-time 
schools." 52/ Undoubtedly liberal dosages of Communist doctrine are 
mixed with the "three R's." On 15 January 1953 a Nationalities 
Publishing House was established to translate and publish "literature 
and pictorials." To facilitate education of minority peoples, text-
books have been printed in several non-Chinese languages, and efforts 
have been made to produce standardized written scripts for some of 
the lesser-known languages. There are also radio broadcasts in 
minority languages; by June 1952 five stations were broadcasting for 
short periods each day in Tibetan, Mongolian, Korean, and Uighur. 
Additional minority-language broadcasts reportedly are under consid-
eration. 54/ 
Improvement in health standards is another Communist aim. Among 
members of "good-will missions" sent to remote areas with gifts of 
salt, clothing, and similar essentials are doctors who offer treat-
ment to minority people. Vaccinations and basic sanitary measures 
have been introduced, arid health stations have been established.

The Chinese Communists have seemingly observed the social and 
religious customs of minorities. An order was issued in December 
L950, for example, "in deference to established custom of the Muslims," 
exempting Muslims from the slaughter tax on beef and mutton consumed 
by Muslim communities during their three major festivals of the year. 
-5 / 
5 / In the various training schools for minority cadres, the Commu-
nists have encouraged observance of festivals and religious holidays, 
the wearing of costumes of minority groups, and other deference to 
minority customs and traditions. 
Land reform has been a primary Communist objective in the creation 
of "New China." As Chou En-lai stated in a speech of 4 February 1953, 
"except for a few minority nationality areas, land reform has been 
completed." 57/ In minority-inhabited areas where the economy is 
derived in whole or in part from animal husbandry, land reform is not 
contemplated. Communist sources state that land holdings of Muslim 
mosques and of lamasaries likewise are not to be expropriated. 
58/ 59/ 
Obviously, in areas where shifting agriculture and hunting are the 
main occupations, land reform is not feasible. In minority areas 
where the land and the economy are suitable, land reform has pro-
gressed slowly. A Communist newspaper article of 15 December 1952 
reports that land reform was just beginning in Sinkiang Province. 60/ 
En some autonomous areas, land reform appears to be a prerequisite 
to the granting of "regional autonomy." Land reform was ,completed

in most of the West Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous District before the 
district was established in December 1952. 
There are reports that in conjunction with the land-reform pro-
gram some minority peoples are to be moved from the mountains to low-
land areas. A November 1951 resolution adopted by the Central-South 
China Military and Administrative Committee refers to this policy as 
follows: 
In areas where agrarian reform is in progress, where 
conditions permit, the Chinese (hail) peasants shall be 
persuaded into reserving a portion of the land for the 
peasants of the national minorities from the mountains 
to come down and settle on the plains with access to the 
land reserved for them. As to the national minority ele-
ments who preferred to remain in their mountain homes, 
every assistance shall be given them in a planned manner 
for the development of production. LI 
A news report of January 1953 stated that when some 5,000 Miao 
and Yao people moved into lowland areas they "were warmly received 
by Han and Chuang peasants who helped them to build new homes and 
to do farm work." 62/ A major miracle in human behavior must have 
occurred in land-hungry China if the tribespeople were "warmly re-
ceived" by their Chinese brothers: 
C. Number, Types, and Administrative Relationships

areas antedated the espousal of principles in the Common Program.

Region, were established between 1946 and 1949.* After the promulga-
tion of the Common Program and before the issuance of the General 
Minority Program of 8 August 1952, a reported 130 autonomous units, 
with a total population of 4,500,000, had been established in Com-
munist China. The number has since increased to over 170, with an 
estimated population of 12,000,000 to 15,000,000. All autonomous 
units above the hsien level and most at the hsien level are believed 
to be located on the accompanying map, CIA 12667. Little information 
is available as to the number and location of autonomous units below 
the level of the hsien. 
As defined in Article 7 of the General Minority Program (Appen-
dix A), each autonomous unit will be at an administrative level com-
parable to ordinary units in the Chinese administrative system. At 
the highest administrative level is the Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region (IMAR), analagous in certain respects to the six major admin-
istrative areas of Communist China. The present administrative status 
of Tibet and Sinkiang is unclear, although both presumably will enjoy 
"regional autonomy" at the administrative level of the DMAR at some 
future date. The next highest administrative unit is the special

district, which is under the immediate jurisdiction of the province 
and normally controls between 5 and 15 hsien. Thirteen autonomous 
units at special district level have been organized. Although their 
aggregate area is large (see map CIA 12667), most of it is sparsely 
inhabited. There are believed tO be about 40 autonomous units at 
the hsien level. Beneath the hsien are several hundred autonomour3 
units at the chili (district or sub-county) and hsiang (administrative 
village) levels. occur in the larger hsien and consist of 10 
or more hsiang, which in turn comprise villages with a total popula-
tion generally below 3,000. Within an autonomous unit at the hsien  
level or higher, there may be an indefinite number of autonomous units 
at lower administrative levels. Usually a number of autonomous 
governments are organized at the chili or hsiang level and are later 
incorporated into a larger autonomous unit, although apparently 
retaining their separate identity. 
Based upon the number and distribution of minority groups, 
autonomous regions are divided into the following four types, which 
are similar to those described in the General Minority Program: (A) 
areas inhabited almost entirely by one minority group; (B) areas with 
one minority group predominating, but with smaller groups included; 
(C) areas inhabited by two or more minority groups in approximately 
equal numbers; and (D) areas inhabited primarily by Han Chinese but 
with concentrations of minority people. Little information is avail-
able about the last type of autonomous unit, which usually is referred

to as a "democratic coalition" government. An early 1953 report 
stated that some 380 democratic coalition governments existed in 
Southwest China alone. 63/ Apparently democratic coElition govern-
ments are to be established in areas where minorities total about 
10 percent of the population. Non-Chinese are to be represented in 
the local government according to their population. 64/ 
As stated in Article 5 of the General Minority Program, autono-
mous units often include a number of settlements of Han Chinese 
within their boundaries. This occurs because minority groups gener-
ally inhabit the hill and slope lands while the Chinese almost 
invariably are concentrated in villages and cities of the lowland 
areas. Where concentrations of Chinese are interspersed with minor-
ity groups, the ordinary administrative organs of government found 
in areas occupied by the Han Chinese apparently contilue to function.

III. The Major Autonomous Units 
A. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (MAR) 
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government (IMAG) was estab-
lished on 1 May 1947, controlling an area that later came to be known 
as the MAR. The territory of the MAR fluctuated considerably between 
1947 and 1950. The MAR includes only a part of what geographically 
is called Inner Mongolia.* As now constituted, the MAR consists of 
western Manchuria and areas formerly parts of northern Jehol and 
Chahar Provinces. Accurate statistics for the area and population 
are not available; the area is estimated at 600,000 square kilometers, 
and the customary Communist population figure is 2,400,000, of which 
slightly over 800,000 are reported to be Mongols. Considering the 
area covered by the MAR, previous estimates of Mongol population 
indicate a total figure of perhaps 1,200,000. Although most of the 
MAR is open pasture land, extensive areas in the south and east are 
inhabited by Chinese agriculturists, and forested mountains occur 
in the north and east. 
Administratively, the MAR is divided into eastern and western 
districts. 65/ The eastern district with headquarters at Wang-yeh-
miao, called by the Communists Wu-lan-hao-t'e (46?05'N, 122?05'E), 
*Inner Mongolia is a somewhat loosely used geographical term 
defining Mongol-inhabited areas of Ningsia, SuiAlan, Jehol, and 
Chahar as those provinces were organized under the Nationalist 
Government. The western Manchurian portion of the MAR is sometimes 
called "Eastern Mongolia" or "Eastern Inner Mongolia."

has jurisdiction over the four Mongol leagues of Hu-na (Huila), Hsing-
an (Hsingan), Che-li-mu (Jerim), and Chao-wu-ta (Jo-oda). Total 
population of this district is 1,260,000 people. 66/ Presumably the 
western district, which has jurisdiction over the leagues of Cha-ha-
erh (Chahar) and Hsi-lin-kuo (Silingol), is administered from Kuei-
sui (40?47'N, 111?371E), capital of the 'MAR and likewise of Suiyilan 
Province. In all, the IMAR administers 6 leagues, 33 banners, 7 hsien, 
and 4 municipalities. 
The creation of the IMAR is an additional stage in the long and 
complex history of political interrelationships between Mongols and 
Chinese. During the past 50 years political tension has increased 
owing to (1) the rapid and continued expansion of Chinese agricultur-
alists into Mongol grazing lands, (2) the intensification of Mongol 
nationalism caused by the establishment in Outer Mongolia of the so-
called Mongolian People's Republic, and (3) the chaotic '13i1itary and 
political situation between 1931 and 1948 when Chinese Nationalists, 
Chinese Communists, and Japanese were seeking control of Mongol-in-
habited areas. 
Chinese Nationalist policy generally followed the old "divide 
and rule" tactics, as for example in 1928 when Inner Mongolia was 
incorporated into the. Chinese provincial system, thuS hindering any 
pan-Mongol movement in China. The Japanese conquest of Manchuria in 
1932 altered the situation. Posing as protectors of Mongol interests'

against Chinese encroachment, the Japanese established semi-autonomous ' 
Mongol provinces. Union of western and eastern Mongols was never 
achieved during the period of Japanese occupation. In this period 
Mongol factions were allied or in sympathy with the Japanese, the 
Chinese Communists, the Chinese Nationalists, and the Mongols of 
Outer Mongolia. 
Following World War II, in 1945, an Inner Mongolia Autonomow 
Movement Association (IMAMA) came into being under the leadership of 
'Tan Tse (Ulanfu), a Moscow-Yenan trained Mongol and member of the 
Chinese Communist Party. The IMAMA cleverly succeeded in framing a 
program acceptable to various Mongol factions and then, through 
familiar Communist practice, wrested control from non-Communist 
Mongol leaders. This led in April 1947 to the establishment of a 
Communist-sponsored Mongol People's Representative Assembly, which 
converted the IMAMA into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government 
(IMAG). Communist leaders hailed the establishment of the IMAR as 
the long-awaited unification of eastern and western Mongols. Since 
the 1MAR embraces only part of the Mongol areas of China, it is 
clear that the old policy of dividing the Mongols into easily con-
trolled units has been followed once again. 
Chinese Communist control of the IMAG is vested in a few trusted 
Party members holding key interlocking governmental posts. Thus YUn 
Tse is not only Chairman of the IMAG, but also the recently appointed 
Governor of Suiyuan Province, member of the North China Administrative

Committee, member of the Comtission on Nationality Affairs of the 
State Administrative Council, and Commander of the Inner Mongolia-
Suiidan Military District, to name a few of his more important posts. 
Yun Tse, having spent most of his life outside of Inner Mongolia, 
reportedly speaks little or no Mongol and has no genuine ties within 
Inner Mongolia. 67/ 
Events of the past year indicate that Peking is at-tempting to 
integrate the 1MAR more closely into Communist China. These events 
have included the transfer of the seat of Government of the IMAG to 
Kuei-sui, in Suiyuan Province,* outside the territorial limits of 
the 1MAR, the division of the 1MAR into eastern and western adminis-
trative districts to facilitate control of Mongol groups, and the 
strengthening of administrative ties between the North China Adminis-
trative Committee and the 1MAG. Mongol goals in the past have in-
cluded a union of all Mongols ?in Inner, Outer, and Eastern Mongolia. 
Traditionally, both Russians and Chinese have opposed pan-Mongol 
movements. 
The Chinese Communists have boasted of their economdc and cultural 
successes with the 'MAR. Special attention has been devoted to 
techniques of animal husbandry, improvement in health conditions of 
both man and beast, and development of educational facilities. 
*For most practical purposes Siliyuan Province appears to be a 
part of the IMAR, although the fiction of separate administration 
still exists.

B. Tibet and Sinkiang 
Both Tibet and Sinkiang have been promised regional autonomy 
at some unspecified date in the future. They cover large areas, 
which are sparsely populated by non-Chinese ethnic groups. Although 
they have been regarded as parts of China by Chinese governments, 
present and past, both have enjoyed considerable autonomy in the 
past, particularly Tibet. Tibet and Sinkiang are strategic areas 
in which the conflicting interests of China, the USSR, and to a less-
er extent India and Pakistan are brought to bear. 
1. Tibet* 
The Chinese Communist occupation of the Tibetan capital 
of Lhasa in August 1951 signified a new chapter in the long and often 
turbulent relations between China and Tibet. Since Manchu armies 
captured Lhasa in 1720, the Chinese from time to time have attempted, 
generally with only limited success, to assert their authority over 
this vast and sparsely inhabited "roof of the world." The Chines 
Nationalist Government considers Tibet an integral part of 
China; the Nationalist Government, however, exercised only 
PThe term Tibet as used in this report refers only to the area 
denoted Tibet on the accompanying maps, sometimes called Outer Tibet. 
The territory actually controlled by the Lhasa government in recent 
years, however, is much greater. The de facto Sino-Tibetan boundary 
had been along the Yangtze in eastern Sikang Province. An indeter-
minate amount of southwestern Tsinghai Province also had been under 
de facto control of Lhasa.

nominal authority through a resident commissioner (1937-1949) stationed 
at the Tibetan capital. Soon after the Chinese Communists came into 
power, they announced their intention to "liberate" Tibet, the last 
large mainland area of China yet to be reclaimed. Accordingly, in 
Late 1950, Chinese forces advanced towards Lhasa from S-Ikang, Tsinghai, 
and Sinkiang. The only resistance apparently encountered was at 
Ch'ang-tu in Sikang, and there the Tibetans offered only token 
resistance and quickly capitulated. 
After the Chinese Communists occupied part of Tibet, a Tibetan 
delegation was sent to Peking at the "request" of the Communists and 
an agreement was signed on 23 May 1951. The agreement stipulated 
that Tibet should have the "right" to "national regional autonomy" 
under the direction of the Central People's Government.* Other 
points in the agreement provided that Communist China would control 
the external relations of Tibet and that the Tibetan Army would be 
integrated into the People's Liberation Army. Furthermore, it was 
stipulated that the existing political system should be retained, 
and the established status, powers, and functions of the Dalai and 
*Although no official reports have as yet indicated that Tibet 
has been granted regional autonomy, Chinese Communist naps dated 
1952 and the 1952 People's Handbook show and list Tibet as an 
"autonomous region." The latest Chinese Communist map, dated March 
1953, however, does not show Tibet as an autonomous region.

Panchen Lamas were not to be altered.* This agreement was not imple-
mented until October 1951 when it was officially ratified by the 
Tibetan National Assembly. 
Little current information is available on conditions in Tibet. 
Chinese Communist military forces in Tibet are estimated at 20,000 
troops. Reports indicate that Chinese Communist soldiers are 
extremely circumspect in their relations with Tibetans. Communist 
sources have told of efforts to improve health standards, agricultural 
and economic productivity, and cultural conditions. Tibet reportedly 
is divided into three administrative zones: (1) a western zone under 
the control of the Panchen Lama, (2) a central zone under the DaJai 
Lama, and (3) an eastern zone under Ngabou, head of the 1951 Tibetan 
delegation to Peking. ?2./ 
The Peking radio recently quoted from an address by Mao Tse-tung 
to a Tibetan mission visiting the Chinese Communist capital. Several 
remarks were significant as an indication of the direction Communist 
policy is taking in Tibet. Mao stated that Tibet is "too thinly 
populated" and that the present population should be increased to 
5,000,000 and eventually to 10,000,000. 70/ Whether this increase 
*Traditionally Tibet has had a theocratic form of government,

Lama. The Panchen Lama also possesses great spiritual powers; his 
temporal powers, however, are slight and subordinate to those of 
the Dalai Lama.

in population is to be made through a rise in the indigenous birth 
rate or through Chinese colonization is not clear. :n the past, 
Tibetans have strongly resisted Chinese colonization of traditional 
Tibetan lands. Regarding land reform, Mao reportedly stated that 
"in minority nationality areas, it is for the minorities themselves 
to decide" whether land reform should be implemented. 71/ As for 
Tibet, Mao stated that "it is as yet premature to speak of distribu-
ting land" and the "Tibetan people themselves must decide whether 
it is to be distributed or not in the future." 1E/ Mao said that 
the "economy and culture also need development" and religion is to 
be protected. /3/ These remarks of Mao Tse-tung indicate the ex-
tremely cautious policy that the Chinese Communists are observing in 
their attempts to placate the Tibetans. 
The Communist. policy of observing local customs and the pro-
grams to develop education and improve health, cultural, and economic 
conditions are, of course, in line with previously announced Chinese 
Communist policy towards all minority groups in China. The Chinese 
Communists appear to have secured complete control over most of 
Tibet. The comparatively small Communist military forces stationed 
in Tibet, the difficult supply routes from China, and the warlike 
nature of many Tibetan tribes indicate that the Chinese Communists 
are taking more than usual pains not to antagonize their Tibetan 
"brothers."

2. Sinkiang 
After "liberating" Sinkiang Province in late 1949, the 
Chinese Communists were confronted with numerous obstacles to their 
plan of integrating Sinkiang effectively into the Chinese Communist 
administrative system. These obstacles included a population 94 
percent non-Chinese, of which most are ethnically akin to the inhabit-
ants of contiguous Soviet areas. The vast majority of these non-
Chinese peoples are Muslims, who in the past have been least tractable 
to Chinese authority. During most of its history as a Chinese prov-
ince, Sinkiang has been misgoverned and exploited; some of its pro-
vincial governors were practically independent of the Central Govern-
ment. The influence of the USSR has been strong in Sinkiang, partic-
ularly between 1933 and 1942; Soviet troops and planes were used to 
help quell a Muslim revolt in the early 1930's. Also, a so-called 
East Turkestan Autonomous Republic with Soviet support was established 
in the northwestern section of the province in 1944 after it became 
clear that the policy of the Sinkiang provincial government had 
changed from pro-Russian to pro-Nationalist Chinese. 
The Chinese Communists have followed the same basic program 
toward minorities in Sinkiang as in other minority-inhabited areas 
of China. Because of the many obstacles encountered, however, they 
appear to have carried out a much more intensive education-propaganda 
campaign in Sinkiang than elsewhere to acquaint the people with their 
program. As Burkhan (Pao Erh-han), chairman of Sinkiang Province, stated

in a report of 1 January 1953, "the various nationalities in Sinkiang 
have received a penetrating education in patriotism and internation-
alism, /Which has] greatly enhanced their political consciousness." 
74/ Methods used in this "penetrating education" have included the 
reported publication of some 2,600,000 books and periodicals, in-
cluding such Sinkiang best sellers as the Selected Works of Mao Tse-
tung (35 separate editions and 354,000 copies issued). 75/ A report-
_ _ 
ed 939,000 textbooks were compiled, translated, and published in 
1952. 76/ The usual Chinese Communist efforts in the fiolds of 
agriculture, public health, and industry have been recorded. Burkhan's 
1 January 1953 report is filled with glowing accounts of "amazing 
achievements" in Sinkiang, but little factual information, is given 
beyond the usual percentage increases. 
With the organization of a preparatory committee for minority 
regional autonomy in September 1952, the implementation of regional 
autonomy in Sinkiang on an administrative level probably comparable 
to the IMAR seemed near at hand. The Objectives of this preparatory 
committee included "broadening propaganda and education on the imple-
mentation of minority regional autonomy" and "investigating and 
studying relations of minorities . . . as well as requirements for 
economic development and their historical background." Autonomy 
was not to be implemented, however, until after land reform had been 
completed. ///

Land reform in Sinkiang reportedly began in December 1952. A 
Communist press notice of that date stated that "landlords' land in 
59 out of 78 counties 5sieh7 will be distributed to the peasants 
of various nationalities between this winter and next spring -- a 
period in which cultivation is not undertaken." iL3/ A November 1952 
Communist news release told of large numbers of minority people being 
trained to administer the regional autonomous government of Sinkiang 
after its establishment. The news report also stated that more than 
half the top government posts were held by minority people, but the 
posts were not specified. 79/ Chinese Communist policy has been to 
place only minority people devoted to the Communist cause in posi-
tions of responsibility. 
C. Autonomous Units at the Special District Level 
As of May 1953 11 autonomous units at the special district 
administrative level had been established; two others were in pre-
paratory stages. The information available for the individual 
autonomous districts varies greatly. The Thai Autonomous District of 
Yunnan Province is discussed in greatest detail because of the con-
siderable amount of information available on it, the political sDgnif-
icance of the district, and the general similarity of the method; 
employed by the Communists in organizing, establishing, and operating 
the Thai Autonomous District to those used for other autonomous units.

All available information as to the area, population, percentage of 
dominant minority group, and name of the chairman for each autonomous 
district is presented in Appendix B of this report. 
1. Thai Autonomous District in YUnnan 
In late January 1953 a Thai Autonomous District, with, 
its capital at Ch'e-li (21?59'N, 100?49'E), was establ-Ished in south-
western YUnnan Province. This unit has an area of about 20,000 
square kilometers and consists of the hsien of Ch'e-li, Fo-hai, Nan-
chiao, and Chen-yfieh, and unspecified parts of the hsien of Chiang-
__ 
ch'eng,. Ssu-mao, Ning-chiang, and Liu-shun. Nan-chiao, Fo-hai, and 
part of Ch'e-li hsien border Burma; Chen-yUeh and parts of Ch'e-li 
and Chiang-ch'eng hsien border Laos; and a small part of Chiang-ch'eng 
hsien borders Vietnam. Total population of the Thai autonomous unit 
is reported to be 200,000 people consisting of "47 nationalities." 
Persons of the Thai nationality group are estimated to comprise 70 
percent of the total. 80/ The Chairman of the People's Government of 
-^ 
the Thai Autonomous District is of Thai nationality and has been re-
ported variously to be Chao Chun-hsin, Tao Tsun-hsin, Tao Shih-tung, 
and Chao Khum Suk. 
The Thai Autonomous District is an area of scattered low plains 
and bordering mountains bisected by the Mekong River. This area is 
f,crown as Sibsong Panna, a regional name signifying the union of 12 
Thai tribes, and has remained relatively isolated from the main 
-48 -

Approved For Release 1999/09/21 : CLAIRIaP9M018A000100070001-3 
currents of Chinese history. Sibsong Panna long has held a position 
of nominal independence from Chinese administration. As late as 
1894, the date of the Sino-British boundary agreement, this area 
was recognized as a semi-independent buffer state. The author of a 
detailed study of the area has stated that the people of Sibsong 
Panna are "not only a group of tribes, of an ethnographical category, 
but they themselves constitute a nation, occupying a common territory 
and speaking a common language. Moreover, they maintain their own 
economic system, and their culture reveals national psychological 
characteristics." 81/ 
The evolution of the Thai Autonomous District apparently has 
followed a pattern similar to that observed in founding other autono-
mous units. As related by the New China News Agency (NCNA), in the 
past two years nationality work teams of over 2,000 persons helped 
establish three Thai-nationality autonomous hsiang, so as to afford 
examples to the minority people of "democratic political construc-
tion." Preparations for establishment of the Thai Autonomous District 
apparently were slow and carefully planned, designed to gain max:Inum 
public support prior to the actual implementation of so-called ro-
gional autonomy. The new members of the autonomous government, at 
their inauguration, made the following pledges: to learn from the 
Han Chinese and the example of Han Chinese cadres so as to guide 
the Thai people; to smash sabotage activities of American imperialists

SECRET 
and special agents of Chiang Kai-shek; and to strengthen defense of 
the fatherland and construct a new Sibsong Panna under the leadership 
of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao Tse-tung, and the Central 
People's Government. The majority of the government council members 
are Thai; a Han Chinese is listed as one of the five vice chairmen. 
The Chairman, Chao Chun-hsin, is reported by NCNA to have been deputy 
director of the Pu-erh Special District (formerly Ning-erh Special 
District) in Yiinnan. 82/ If true, this would indicate that Chao is 
a trusted and experienced Communist administrator. 
Since the establishment of the Thai Autonomous District, consider-
able concern has been voiced, particularly in Thailand, as to ulterior 
motives the Chinese Communists may have had in its creation. 
81/1V8V 
Most speculations have concerned themselves with the possibility that 
tribal nationalism among all Thai groups may be fostered, thus creating 
dissident movements in Burma, Thailand, and Laos. It has also been 
feared that political refugees, such as former Thai Prem-ler Pridi, 
may use the Thai area, of China as a political haven from which to 
direct propaganda appeals to Thailand. 
The Thai Autonomous District is but one of many similar autonomous 
units, and its creation is consistent with present and past Chinese 
communist policy toward all minority groups. The Thai Autonomous 
District appears to be welded effectively into the Chinese administra-
tive pattern, and its "autonomy" is probably no greater than that 
- 50 -

possessed by an ordinary administrative unit. The creation of an 
autonomous unit in an area of long-standing political, economic, and 
cultural homogeneity is not unique; several other autonomous units 
have been organized in areas that were nominally independent political 
and cultural entities. The location of the Thai Autonomous District 
in the Burma-China-Laos border area is important considering the large 
number of ethnically related people inhabiting neighboring nations. 
The combined ethnic and historical factors present afford opportunities 
that could be exploited to further Chinese Communist policies in 
Southeast Asia. 
2. Tibetan Autonomous Districts 
Centered about the juncture of Sikang, Szechwan, Kansu, 
and Tsinghai Provinces are three Tibetan autonomous units and a J-ourth 
in the process of being organized, all at the special district admin-
istrative level. As can be seen from accompanying map CIA 12667, these 
units are largely contiguous and embrace an extensive area, roughly 
estimated to be about 500,000 square kilometers. In this vast territory 
live approximately 1,500,000 people, of whom about 1,100,000 are 
Tibetans or of Tibetan descent. Most of the area is a combination of 
mountains and high plateau country in which nomadic herding is the 
principal occupation. Since more information is available on tho 
Sikang Tibetan Autonomous District than on the other three, that unit 
is discussed in greatest detail.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
The first of these autonomous units, the Sikang Tibetan Autonomous 
District, was established in eastern Sikang Province in November 1950, 
when political and military measures were being directed against Tibet. 
This autonomous area may have been created at that time to allay 
Tibetan fears that their traditional independence would be taken away. 
The district extends over some 175,000 square kilometers west from 
the Yangtze (known in this area as the Ching-sha Chiang or Golden Sands 
River) to or near the Szechwan border on the east.* As ;tated pre-
viously, the Yangtze in the past has served as the de facto boundary 
between Chinese and Tibetan authority. The area is populated pre-
dominantly by Tibetans, reportedly 560,000 of a total of 700,000. 
Administratively, the Tibetan Autonomous District in Sikang controls 
20 hsien. The Chairman of the autonomous government is a Tibetan 
called Sans-rygas-ye-shes (Chinese name T'ien Pao), who joined the 
Chinese Communists in 1935 as a youth when the Red Army entered 
eastern Sikang during their Long March. He reportedly also holds 
important posts in the Sikang provincial government and in the South-
west Administrative Committee. 
Adjoining the Sikang Tibetan Autonomous District is the Northwest 
Szechwan Tibetan Autonomous District, set up in late December 1952. 
Numerous tribes of Tibetan descent, such as the Ch'iang, Hsi-fan, and 
Gia-rung, who possess a combined or fused Tibetan-Chinese culture, 
inhabit this mountainous area. 87/

District, see map CIA 12384, available at the CIA Map Library.

The Ya-shu Tibetan Autonomous District, in southwestern Tsinghai, 
was organized in February 1952. This autonomous unit is large, covering 
perhaps a third of Tsinghai Province, but very sparsely populated by 
nomadic Tibetan tribes who reportedly number about 70,000. Li?./ 
A recent Chinese Communist news release tells of the establishment 
of a preparatory committee for the organization of a South Kansu 
Tibetan Autonomous District. This new autonomous unit will absorb 
several smaller autonomous units, such as the Hsi-ho and Cho-ni 
Tibetan areas. 
3. Other Autonomous Districts 
The Liang-shan Yi Autonomous District was established in 
southeastern Sikang Province in October 1952 for some 700,000 Yl-chia 
(Lob) people. This autonomous unit covers about 12,000 square kilo-
meters, including most of the area known as "Independent Lola Land," 
the mountainous retreat of several hundred thousand Yi-chia who in the 
past have remained aloof and independent of Chinese administration. 
Part of this so-called Independent Lob o Land extends across the border 
into southwestern Szechwan. A recent Communist news release tells of 
the forming of preparatory committees for autonomy in this area, and 
of the plan to include the area with the Liang-shan Yi Autonomou3 
District in Sikang. 89/ 
The general Communist measures of first forming small "modet" 
autonomous units and of establishing state trading companies and mobile

S-E-C-R-E-T 
health teams have been carried out in the Liang-shan area. The Yi-
chia have been noted for their warlike spirit and their intertribal 
feuds. According to a recent NCNA release from Ya-an, Bikang pro-
vincial capital, however, the situation has now changed and "unprec-
edented unity pervades the whole region since over forty tribal chiefs 
and two hundred and thirty representatives signed a regional pact of 
unity, before the portrait of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, pledging them-
selves to put a permanent end to armed strife." 90/ 
In December 1952 the West Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous District was 
established, comprising 33 hsien, unfortunately not identified, and 
some 6,000,000 people. It is possible that part of this autonomous 
unit is contiguous with Vietnam. About two-thirds of the population 
consists of Chuang, a Thai-dialect group. Unlike the culturally 
homogenous Thai of southern Y17nnan, the Chuang differ little, socially 
and economically, from the Chinese. Most of them are in various stages 
of cultural absorption by the Chinese. Land reform was carried out in 
20 of the 33 hsien before regional autonomy was granted; most Chuang 
live on low plains and grow rice as their staple crop. 
In May 1952 the West Hunan Miao Autonomous District was organized. 
Little is known about this area beyond the fact that it contains 10 
hsien with a population of 1,500,000, of which only 300,000 are Miao. 
Available information indicates that only a few of the southern hsien 
in this autonomous area have concentrations of Miao people; why the 
largely Chinese-inhabited northern hsien were included in the unit is 
not clear.

The Hainan Li-Miao Autonomous District was established in July 
1952 in the hilly, forested south-central part of the island. The 
population of this autonomous unit is 270,000 with the majority Li, 
a Thai-related people. The Communist policy of currying favor with 
minority groups may be important on Hainan because of its strategic 
location as a base for possible future operations against the Chinese 
mainland. 
The Yen-pien Korean Autonomous District composed of five hsirn 
with a population of 730,000, including over 500,000 Koreans, was 
established in September 1952. It occupies a fertile basin surrounded 
on three sides by mountains. The Chairman of the District, Chu Te-
hai, was in 1952 the only Korean member of the Northeast People's 
Government Committee. 2.1/ There have been speculations that the Yen-
pien area might eventually be incorporated into North Korea to bolster 
the North Korean regime, 92/ but there are no indications that Chinese 
Communist policy would permit the absorption of an historical portion 
of China by another nation. 
The two Mongol leagues of Suiyuan Province, the Wu-lan-ch'a-pu 
(Ulanchap) and I-k'o-chao (Ikechou), were organized in 1950 and 1951, 
respectively, into special district level autonomous units. The 2 
leagues include large areas of steppe and desert land. Total popula-
tion is small, estimated as somewhat over 100,000 people. Adminis-
tratively, the 2 leagues control 13 banners and 1 hsien.

It was announced in March 1952 that the Hsi-hai-ku Muslim 
Automomous District was to be established in eastern Kanu Province. 
This autonomous unit will cover an area of about 23,000 square kilo-
meters and will control several hsien with a population totaling 
nearly 500,000, of which 47 percent are Muslims. Although Muslim 
autonomous units previously have been organized at the hsien level 
and below, the new division will be the first of this size and 
administrative Level. 
D. Autonomous Units at the. Hsien and Sub-Hsien Levels 
The number of autonomous units at the hsien and sub-hsien 
Levels is not known. More than 40 autonomous units, largely at the 
hsien level, are located on accompanying map CIA 12667. Little 
detailed information is available for these autonomous units; that 
which has been released substantiates previous knowledge as to Com-
munist measures utilized in implementing regional autonomy. 
The establishment in September 1950 of a Tung-hsiang autonomous 
area at the hsien level in eastern Kansu is of interest since the 
Tung-hsiang, or "East Country" Muslims, long have resisted Chinese 
attempts at administration and have frequently participated in Muslim 
revolts.

IV. Attitudes and Reactions 
The degree of success attained by the Chinese Communists in im-
plementing their policies toward minority groups is extremely diffi-
cult to assess. The fragmentary information available is from two 
main sources: (1) comments of returned missionaries, businessmen, 
and travelers, and (2) speeches by Communist leaders and publishet 
Communist news reports. 
Most persons returning from Communist China have noted the 
generally favorable treatment received by minorities. Their comments 
likewise have stressed the fact that the Communists are indoctrinat-
ing tribal leaders and training likely candidates in special minority-
nationality training schools to work in minority areas as adminiEr,ra-
tors and instructors. Available evidence indicates that the Communists 
have been at least partially successful in this endeavor. 
A 1951 report from a Yi-chia (Lob) area of southwestern Szechwan 
stated that the Yi-chia did not enjoy the Communist instruction and 
that while Communism might be all right for the Han Chinese, the 
Yi-chia would stick to their own ways. 93/ Another source in com-
menting upon the minority training schools in Tsinghai said that basic 
dislike and fear of the Communist regime among Tibetan nomads waE 
very strong. 94/ Still another source reported that the Tibetan E in 
eastern Sikang were being treated with circumspection as of early 
1952. According to this report a few have become violently and

S -E -C -R -E -T 
vocally pro-Communist, while others have taken a "we don't care who 
governs us; we'll get along" attitude. 95/ Several returned mis-
sionaries have conmented upon the attitude of the Lieu toward the 
Communists; the Lieu are a small tribal group inhabiting the Salween 
Valley country along the Upper Burma-YUnnan border. A report of 
January 1952 stated that the Lieu were being converted to Communism 
more slowly than the Chinese. The same source also stated that "the 
Lieu seem to respond quite readily to Communism," in part because 
they were oppressed by the Chinese in the past. 96/ Another report 
of early 1952 stated that the "Black Lieu," a less culturally-
advanced and independent element of the Lieu ethnic group, have 
remained aloof from Communist overtures; other Lieu groups, however, 
reportedly have accepted the Communists. 97/. 
Speeches by Communist leaders have revealed that minority 
reactions to the Communist program have not always been "correct." 
At the second conference of the Commission of the Affairs of Nation-
alities of the Central People's Government (CPG), a nmber of 
illuminating speeches were presented. An excerpt from a speech de-
livered by Wan Feng, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Committee 
of Northwest China, in December 1951, follows: 
Because a segment of the minority nationality masses at first 
failed to understand the promotion of regional autonomy, many 
of them incorrectly believed that after regional autonomy is in 
effect, the Communist Party must leave, and they feared that 
after the departure of the Communist Party there would be no 
policy on how to carry out autonomy. Those wh:o still embraced

feelings of "narrow nationalism" thought that after establishlng 
regional autonomy, they could go their own way independently and 
leave the Communist Party. Therefore, it is absolutely impera-
tive that 57 systematic educational and propaganda campaign 
must be expanded among the masses to advance regional autonomy 
collectively. 98/ 
A speech made at the same conference by Ulanfu, Chairman of the 
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, voices similar sentiments. For 
example, Ulanfu stated that "some persons are of the opinion that 
regional autonomy is independence without need of leadership by 
higher People's Government." 99/ Ulanfu also remarked that "doubts, 
worries and misunderstandings" will be removed by continued "explana-
tion and education." 100/ The Chairman of the Commission of the 
Affairs of Nationalities of the CPG, Li Wei-han, in a speech at the 
same conference, devoted a section of his discourse to various ques-
tions presumably raised. The questions generally voiced some doubt 
as to the wisdom and necessity of the minority nationality program. 
Li Wei-han's stock rejoinder was that questions such as these "impede" 
and "interfere" with the introduction and implementation of regional 
autonomy policy. 101/ 
Criticism of the spirit and methods employed by Chinese cadres 
in minority areas has also been voiced. Ulanfu, in his speech, 
remarked that "Han cadres, lacking an over-all correct understanding 
. . . entertained various doubts and worries about the effectuation of 
nationalities regional autonomy." 102/ The annual report of Kwangsi 
Province for 1952 also indicated that the cadres have not fully

understood their duty. For example, it was stated that study of the 
national minorities policy had been inadequate, and insufficient 
attention had been paid to developing area autonomy. 103/ The 
Communist cure for these doubts, worries, and insufficient study is 
continued "explanation and education."

V. Conclusion 
The establishment of so-called autonomous governments in the 
minority-inhabited areas of China has been but a part of a broad 
Communist program designed to gain absolute control of mainland 
China. The Communists have curbed the traditional policy of 
oppressing and exploiting non-Chinese groups, and have instituted a 
program of political, economic, and social reforms designed to gain 
the support of minority people. The central point of the Communist-
inspired minority program has been the promise of "autonomy" for 
minority areas. Although the Communists have proclaimed their ad-
herence to the ideals of autonomy, in practice the customary Chinese 
"divide and rule" technique of splitting minority groups into small, 
politically impotent elements has been followed. A good example has 
been the establishment of four separate Tibetan autonomous units 
with largely contiguous boundaries. Autonomous units have no real 
autonomy, and all evidence indicates that each Unit is firmly welded 
into the Chinese administrative system. 
Chinese Communist minority policies are of great importance in 
the peripheral regions of China -- Tibet, Sinkiang, and Inner 
Mongolia. These regions had long been political vacuums, and Chinese 
authority was, in most parts, merely nominal; as a result Soviet in-
fluence expanded, particularly in Sinkiang. The reassertion of 
Chinese control forecasts new political alignments in these stragetic 
areas.

The establishment of autonomous units in border areas, particu-
larly YUnnan Province, is viewed with considerable concern by border-
ing countries, since these autonomous units consist of people ethni-
cally related to people in adjacent nations. These autonomous units 
could be used to inspire dissident elements in bordering states and 
to further Chinese Communist designs in southeast Asia and elsewhere. 
In advancing their policies towards non-Chinese peoples, tive 
Communists have stressed improvement in educational facilities, health 
conditions, and agricultural productivity, and other measures de-
signed to civilize minority groups. The intensive training of polit-
ical workers in the Communist doctrine will enable the Communists 
to replace the old leading classes, the most important element 
traditionally opposed to Chinese domination. Although the Communists 
have encouraged cultural identity among the non-Chinese groups and 
have denounced "pan-Hanism" among the Han Chinese, the various 
social, political, and economic reforms designed to educate and 
civilize non-Chinese peoples will probably result in gradual cultural 
assimilation of many of the minority people. 
The most significant result of the Chinese Communist minority 
1.program is that within only four years and with an apparent minimum 
of military difficulty the Communists apparently have been able to 
secure control of the minority-inhabited areas of China, including 
strategic border areas.

APPENDIX c 
GAPS IN INTELLIGENCE 
Serious gaps in information exist concerning the autonomous 
governments and minority program of Communist China. Considering 
the large number of minority peoples in China, very few detailed and 
comprehensive studies of most minority groups have been made. 
Although data are available regarding the major autonomous units, 
there is little information on autonomous units at lower levels 
of administration. Undoubtedly a great many more of these smaller 
autonomous units have been created than are located and described 
on the accompanying map and table. Specific information as to 
exact area, population, and ethnic composition is lacking for many 
autonomous units. Very little information is available concerning 
the current political situation in Sinkiang, Tibet, and the Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region. The theoretical methods and plans of 
the Chinese Communists in carrying out their program in minority-
inhabited areas are known, but the state of implementation of the 
Communist program is almost unknown. Only fragmentary information is 
available concerning the precise interrelationships between autonomous 
units and Chinese administrative units. A very serious gap is the 
lack of information on the attitudes and reactions of minority 
people toward the Communist program.

APPENDIX D 
SOURCES AND EVALUATION OF SOURCES 
1. Evaluation of Sources 
Since the Communists assumed control of China, intelligence of 
all kinds has been fragmentary. A limited amount of recent informa-
tion has been obtained from returned missionaries, businessmen, and 
Chinese POW's. Other sources are Chinese newspapers, handbooks, 
radio broadcasts, and maps, but information from these sources must 
be treated with caution. 
The best over-all source for generalized information concerning 
the minority peoples of China is contained in Natiaaal Intelligence 
Survey 39. A recent study, Ethnic Groups of Northern Southeast Asia, 
provides concise summaries of tribal groups of Yilnnan and Kwangsi 
Provinces. The variant tribal names listed in this source are 
particularly useful. Population figures for the minority groups are 
unreliable and, regardless of source, are estimates. 
Nearly all of the information concerning the evolution and 
functions of autonomous governments is from Chinese Communist news 
releases. Fragmentary basic information, mostly in the form of 
Communist news releases, is provided for a limited amber of autonomous 
units. 
The few sources reporting the reactions and attitudes of minori-
ties to the Communist program are incomplete, often contradictory, 
and cover different periods.

FROM : Chief, geography Division au. 
SUBJECT: elease of OU Publication 
1. The Geography Division would be extremely reluctant to appfovo 
the release of CIA/RR-G-7 "Autonatous GoveaEXAWin the anerity In 
aimat Areas of Communist China" (Secret) 
2. The basis for this reluctance is: 
a. On the basUXOGeed-to-know there is no justification 
for releasing this Approximately 80;; of the 
report is devoted to a discussion of the Hongols, Tibet ins, and 
Chinese Noslems. These peonies inhabit inner Aongolial Tibet, 
Sinkiang, and other a94sAla7Northern China which are ge,eatl-
aa11467a from Vietnam, 
b. It would be extremely difficult to sanitize till reeort 
without cutting it to ribbons. Such statements as "The Communist 
policy of curryin,; favor with minority groups nay be im)ortant 
on Hainan becauFe of its strategic location as a base Tn. 3ossThi:?. 
future operations against the Chinese mainland." 
c. since the publication of CIA/RR-G-7, additiona info 
?
nation has been received which: 
makes obsolete and incomplete the table aAd map 
accompanying the report and, 
2) to some extent would alter some of the co:Icluaions 
reached in the report and would somewhat change th enTAvAt. 
of the conclusions.
