 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 USSR THREATENS WESTERN POSITION IN BERLIN  .  .  .  .  .       .  Page
 Khrushchev's threat on 10 November to "revise" the
 international status of Berlin presages a period of mount-
 ing tension in Germany during which the USSR will proba-
 bly take steps to transfer to the East German regime So-
 viet authority in Berlin derived from quadripartite agree-
 ments.  A new juridical basis for the presence of Soviet
 troops in East Germany would be established.  These ac-
 tions would be designed to force the West to deal with
 the Ulbricht regime in order to maintain Western access
 to Berlin.  Bonn has hinted it might consider severing
 relations with Moscow if the USR           abrogate the
 four-power agreement on Berlin.
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page
 King Husayn has used the plane incident to whip-up
 patriotic sentiment for himself.  His propaganda may
 backfire if he presses charges against the UAR in the UN,
 however, since his plane did not in fact have clearance
 for its flight.   In Iraq the roundup. of pro-UAR elements
 has continued.   Israel remains alert to area developments,
 and new incidents may occur in perennial trouble spots
 along the Israeli-Syrian border and around the Mount Sco-
 pus area of Jerusalem.  In the Sudan, the pro-Western
 government is still reported considering forceful action
 to curb opposition and subversion if it does not succeed
 in strengthening its-hand by parliamentary means.  Area
 developments have apparently left Nasir depressed and
 frustrated.
 SOVIET POSITION IN GENEVA CONFERENCES   .  .  .  .  .
 Page 6
 Moscow continues after two weeks of negotiations at
 Geneva on-a nuclear test cessation, to maintain its basic
 insistence on an immediate, permanent, and unconditional
 agreement.  A new Soviet suggestion--designed to appear
 as a concession to the West--proposes that an agreement
 on cessation should at least be drafted before discus-
 sion of a control system.   Moscow apparently has no im-
 mediate intention of breaking off the talks.   In the
 talks on measures to prevent surprise attack, chief So-
 viet delegate Kuznetsov has insisted that this subject
 is "organically linked" with broader disarmament issues.

 ARGENTINE POLITICAL CRISIS    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 7
 Argentine President Frondizi?s suspension of con-
 stitutional guarantees for 30 days on 10 November springs
 from his determination to push forward his oil policy and
 to crack down on Peronista and Communist agitation.               His
 action, which was precipitated by the petroleum workers'
 strike demanding cancellation of government oil develop-
 ment contracts with American firms,  increases his depend-
 ence on the armed forces.  The military backed Frondizi
 during an abortive coup attempt on 12 November, which
 was apparently encouraged by the spreading labor unrest.          25X1

 ..  Page 1
 Premier de Gaulle's plan to work out a permanent Al-
 gerian settlement with the Algerian deputies to be elected
 to the French National Assembly on 30 November has'been
 undercut by the conspicuous absence of nationalist Moslem
 and liberal European candidates.  The inability and unwill-
 ingness of "all political tendencies" to present themselves
 in the face of indirect French Army and settler opposition
 and of rebel intimidation may force De Gaulle to seek another
 mechanism for a settlement.                                                    25X1
 TAIWAN STRAIT SITUATION  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page 2
 The Chinese Communists have outlined a massive propa-
 ganda campaign to rationalize Peiping's avoidance of hos-
 tilities with the United States in the Taiwan Strait area.
 A Nationalist official has stated that although no "deals"
 will be made with the Communists by those now in control,
 certain "fringe elements" might negotiate if by some "re-
 mote" event they were brought to power.   The military pic-
 ture is one of outward relative calm, although Peiping
 continues to maintain strong forces in the strait area.

 The military regime in Pakistan is giving priority
 to those reform measures which are likely to maintain
 the popular impression of rapid progress.                     Enthusiasm
 over the regime's "clean-up" campaign during the first
 month of martial law has begun to wane, and the govern-
 ment is under increasing pressure to demonstrate con-
 tinuing achievement.  Political elements, especially
 in East Pakistan, are planning to resume limited ac-
 tivity.
 INDIAN PARLIAMENT FACES CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 5  25X1
 The session of the Indian Parliament opening on 17
 November is likely to be highlighted by discussions of
 controversial issues on which the Congress party is find-
 ing it increasingly difficult to defend itself.                   In addi-
 tion to such chronic problems as lagging food production,
 five-year-plan finances, and party rifts in several key
 states, government leaders may be challenged on three
 especially explosive questions--the situation in Commu-
 nist-governed Kerala State, the linguistic problem in
 Bombay State, and an old government financial scandal in-
 volving V. K. Krishna Menon.                                                       25X1
 ELECTIONS SCHEDULED IN NEPAL .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 6
 King Mahendra has set Nepal's first parliamentary
 elections in its history for 18 February 1959.  Voting
 for a lower house of 109 members will extend over 45
 days.   The parliament is to operate under the terms of
 a new constitution presented on 2 November for the King's
 approval.   If political agitation gets out of hand, how-
 ever, the King is likely to postpone the elections.  There
 is also to be an upper house appointed by the King.F___1          25X1
 RENEWED INFLATION IN SOUTH KOREA  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .   Page 7
 The progress of South Korea's financial stabiliza-
 tion program has been halted by a sudden increase of cur-
 rency in circulation, resulting in a 6.5-percent rise in
 the wholesale price index in September and October. In-
 creased bank credits and doubled wages for all govern-
 ment and, military personnel are primarily responsible,
 but poor fiscal operations and unrealistic budget plan-
 ning also are to blame.  Further inflation is probable
 for the next few months at least.

 PART II (continued)
 SINO-SOVIET BLOC ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE IN INDONESIA .  .  .  .  .  Page 8
 Indonesia has accepted about $200,000,000 worth of
 Sino-Soviet bloc economic aid offers since late 1957.     In
 addition the bloc has agreed to deliver by 1959 at least
 $170,000,000 worth of military equipment and has sent at
 least 270 economic technicians and about 170 military
 specialists to Indonesia.   Indonesian trade with the bloc
 in 1958 probably will surpass the previous peak level of
 $74,000,000 attained in 1955, and significant contracts
 for future trade apparently are now being concluded.
 CATHOLICS IN NORTH VIETNAM .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  Page
 Hanoi's efforts to acquire greater control over its
 outspoken Catholic minority have vacillated between con-
 ciliation and harshness, sometimes leading to armed
 clashes.  The regime's recent expulsion of four of the
 20 foreign priests in the country is a move to strengthen
 the state-sponsored church.
 OBSERVERS REFUTE PEIPING'S AGRICULTURAL CLAIMS .  .  .  .  .     Page  10
 Observations of recent visitors to China and Pei-
 ping's own policies with respect to food and cloth ra-
 tioning confirm earlier analyses that Communist China's
 statements about its "amazing" increases in agricultural
 production are exaggerated.  Although good weather and a
 massive effort in the countryside undoubtedly brought
 about substantial increases in most agricultural products
 this year, most of the regime's claims seem out of touch
 with reality.
 THE YUGOSLAV DISPUTE WITH THE SINO-SOVIET BLOC .  .
 Neither side in the dispute between Yugoslavia and
 the Sino-Soviet bloc appears willing to let mutual re-
 criminations subside.  Speculation that a "truce" was
 on the horizon has not been borne out by events.  Basic
 ideological divergencies outweigh those factors that
 could lead to an accommodation.

 Additional reports now confirm a resurgence of anti-
 regime hostility in Rumania during the first six months
 of 1958, particularly on the part of peasants and indus-
 trial workers.  This apparently prompted the Rumanian lead-
 ership to expand what was to have been a fairly routine
 crackdown on the party and government bureaucracy.

 PART II (continued)
 USSR SEEKS TO INCREASE EXPORTS TO WESTERN EUROPE .  .  . .
 The USSR, which must augment its foreign-exchange
 earnings in order to acquire Western equipment with
 which to enlarge its chemical industry, is finding it
 increasingly difficult to expand exports to Western Eu-
 rope.  The volume of trade among free world countries
 this year has been generally lower, but European coun-
 tries are reluctant to buy more from the USSR at the ex-
 pense of trade with traditional suppliers.
 COMMUNIST CLANDESTINE ACTIVITY IN WEST GERMANY .

 Bonn government officials are apprehensive over the
 inability of the federal police authorities to control
 Communist underground activities and have used two re-
 cent disclosures of Communist operations to illustrate
 the need for increased security measures for West Ger-
 many.  While they constitute no immediate threat to the
 security of the Federal Republic, Communist activities,
 both espionage and propaganda operations, seem to be on

 FINNISH CABINET UNDER POLITICAL ATTACK .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 17
 Finland's two-month-old, five-party coalition gov-
 ernment, headed by veteran Social Democrat Karl August
 Fagerholm, is being attacked by the two opposition par-
 ties and is under pressure from the USSR.                   It is also
 strongly criticized from within by elements of the Agrar-
 ian party, who assert that their party is best able to
 maintain good relations with the USSR.  Fagerholm's fall
 would probably bring in an Agrarian-led government which
 would be either a minority cabinet dependent on Communist
 parliamentary su port or a ma'orit    overnment including
 the Communists.

 COMMUNISTS .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    . .  . . .  Page  18
 Spanish Socialist leaders in exile are under increas-
 ing pressure from their followers in Spain to permit col-
 laboration with the Communists in peaceful strikes and
 demonstrations in order to avoid losing the initiative to
 the Communists.  With benefits of the 1956 wage boosts
 wiped out by steadily rising living costs, such joint ac-
 tion, particularly with Anarchist party participation,
 could lead to unprecedented worker agitation in the com-
 ing months.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 PEIPING'S HARD-LINE FOREIGN POLICY .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . .  Page  1
 Behind Communist China's present foreign policy
 posture apparently is the belief that an atmosphere of
 tension at this time will induce peoples of non-Commu-
 nist countries to exert pressure on their governments
 in favor of a "wholesale" change in attitude toward recog-
 nition of the Peiping regime.  The Communists are attempt-
 ing to exert both political and military pressure on the
 United States without clashing with American military
 forces in the Taiwan Strait area, they appear gratified
 by the trend of international opinion on the issue.  They
 probably will try to keep their foreign policy sufficient-
 ly flexible so as not to alienate some of the sympathizers
 they won in the course of the Taiwan Strait crisis.

 procedures will probably reduce Communist representa-
 tion, and De Gaulle's refusal to let his name be drawn
 into the campaign has upset rightist hopes for sweeping
 the country with a Gaullist "National'List."  The impact
 of the elections will be drastically reduced, however,
 if, as the present trend suggests, the representatives
 elected in Algeria will not command sufficient respect
 among the Moslems to be able t  negotiate a workable
 adjustment of the Algerian problem.

 There is genuine concern among Western European pow-
 ers--particularly those with colonies--over the growing
 power of what they consider a politically immature voting
 majority in the UN General Assembly.  Nevertheless West-
 ern Europeans generally see the United Nations as a perma-
 nent feature of international life, useful, among other
 things, for "educating" the lesser developed countries
 to their international 'responsibilities.  Most Western
 European members would like to see the UN economic as-
 sistance programs broadened, believing that multilateral
 aid through the UN best offsets direct Soviet aid.

 Khrushchev's threats on 10
 November to "revise" the inter-
 national status of Berlin pres-
 age           a period of mounting ten-
 sion in Germany.   During this
 period the USSR will probably
 take a series of steps to trans-
 fer to the East German regime
 Soviet authority in Berlin de-
 rived from quadripartite agree-
 ments.   A new juridical basis
 for the presence of Soviet
 troops in East Germany would be
 established.
 Khrushchev declared that
 the Western powers,  by violating
 the "Potsdam Agreement"--notably
 by sanctioning the remilitariza-
 tion of West Germany--had for-
 feited their right to remain
 in West Berlin, and he indicated
 that the USSR would hand over
 its remaining functions to
 East Germany.   He further de-
 clared that any attack on East
 Germany would be considered an
 attack on the USSR itself.   He
 gave no indication, however, of
 how or when the USSR planned to
 hand over its functions.   Soviet
 Foreign Minister Gromyko on 11
 November said this would not
 happen immediately but would
 not be long delayed.   Further,
 a Soviet Foreign Ministry offi-
 cial informed American Ambas-
 sador Thompson that German prob-
 lems should be dealt with on a
 step-by-step basis.
 The Soviet actions would
 be designed to enhance East Ger-
 man sovereignty,  thus urd_erlin-
 ing the Soviet contention that
 there are two Germanies and,  by
 invoking the threat of a block-
 ade, to force the West to deal
 with the Ulbricht regime.   A
 broader purpose may be to fur-
 ther increase world tension with
 a "western Quemoy" in order to
 strengthen bloc unity against
 the common enemy and to block
 West German attempts to estab-
 lish normal relations with the
 East European countries, par-
 ticularly Poland.   Further,  the

 mans, thus confronting the West
 with a situation in which it
 would be required either to
 deal with East German officials
 or fly without guarantees of
 safety.  However, the East Ger-
 mans are not now believed to
 be in a position to exert ef-
 fective control of flights in
 the corridor and they apparent-
 ly do not possess the trained
 personnel to take over all the
 Soviet positions at this time.
 West German officials be-
 lieve that Khrushchev's speech
 is aimed at testing the firmness
 of the Western resolve to re-
 main in Berlin and at exerting
 pressure on German public opin-
 ion to accept direct political
 talks with East Germany.   French
 and British foreign affairs
 officials have strongly rejected
 any unilateral abrogation of
 the Potsdam Agreement, and the
 West German press chief on 12
 November hinted that Bonn might
 consider severing its relations
 with Moscow if the USSR abro-
 gated the four-power status of
 Berlin.
 Increased harassment of
 West Berlin and Allied and West
 German access to it is now like-
 ly.  Various measures to in-
 hibit traffic on the lifeline
 to Berlin could be taken by
 the USSR or East Germany, and
 the East Germans could move to
 seal off West Berlin by impos-
 ing border restrictions and
 halting municipal transport.
 Although West Berlin municipal
 officials report that there
 is no indication of public dis-
 quiet in the city, they feel
 that acceptance of East German
 control over highway access to
 Berlin would be an "intolerable
 situation."  British officials
 in Berlin, however, warn of
 the danger of a "self-imposed"
 blockade if the Western powers
 refuse to accept East German
 control over access to Berlin.
 King Husayn has used the
 incident involving his plane
 to make effective propaganda
 arousing sympathy and indigna-
 tion among royalist elements.
 However, it does not appear
 that the incident has produced
 more than a temporary lift. It
 seems possible that if Husayn
 presses charges against  the UAR
 in the United Nations, the re-
 sult may actually be damaging,
 since it has been confirmed
 that clearance for the King's
 flight was not received from
 the UAR and that Damascus is
 thus technically in the right

 The Israelis have remained

 pressing to extend their con-

 SOVIET POSITION IN GENEVA CONFERENCES
 Moscow continues, after
 two weeks of negotiations at
 Geneva on a nuclear test cessa-
 tion, to maintain its basic in-
 sistence on an immediate, per-
 manent, and unconditional agree-
 ment.   A new Soviet suggestion--
 designed to appear as a conces-
 sion to the West--proposes that
 an agreement on cessation should
 at least be drafted before dis-
 cussion of  control system.
 This would be followed by the
 drafting of provisions "concern-
 ing the organization of the con-
 trol system," including the
 structure and functions of a
 control organ and system based
 on the report of the technical
 experts prepared last summer,
 and then by the listing of or-
 ganizational and other prepara-
 tory measures to be taken after
 signing.   The agreement would
 then be signed.
 Thus, while ostensibly
 meeting the Western objection
 to the original Soviet agenda
 proposal, the new proposal would
 seem to require informal agree-
 ment on a draft on cessation of
 tests before discussion of con-
 trols.  The Soviet delegation
 clearly indicated that Moscow
 envisaged an agreement which
 would include only a general
 directive for establishment of
 a control organ, details  of
 which would be taken up in a
 separate agreement to be nego-
 tiated sometime in the future.
 Although the agenda pro-
 posal accomplishes little to-
 ward breaking the deadlock at
 the talks, its very issuance
 may indicate that Moscow is
 seeking a talking point on which
 to launch discussion of its own
 proposal for an unconditional
 test-cessation agreement.   It
 also shows that the Kremlin
 probably has no immediate in-
 tention of breaking off the
 talks.
 The Soviet delegation was
 outwardly unruffled by the pub-
 lic announcement by the United
 States that Russia had continued
 testing after the 31 October
 opening session.   Moscow both
 publicly and privately reiterated
 its 30 October official state-
 ment that it would continue
 tests as long as the West con-    25X1
 tinued to "wreck agreement" for
 a permanent unconditional to

 link "the subjective conditions"
 embodied in President  Eisen-
 hower's 22 August statement with
 any test-cessation agreement.
 Tsarapkin warned that the Soviet
 delegation would never acquiesce
 to any conditional agreement.
 In the concurrent Geneva
 talks on measures to prevent
 surprise attack, chief Soviet
 delegate Kuznetsov has insisted
 that this subject is "organical-
 ly linked" with broader disarma-
 ment issues such as a ban on nu-
 clear weapons, liquidation of
 foreign bases, and reduction of
 conventional armaments and forces.
 Moscow, hoping to use this line
 to counter what it probably be-
 lieves will be attractive West-
 ern proposals, assigned First
 Deputy Foreign Minister Kuzne-
 system would provide a would-
 be aggressor with intelligence
 data of value in launching such
 an attack.
 The remarks of other bloc
 delegates at the third session
 support Soviet attempts to in-
 ject what are essentially polit-
 ical issues into the technical
 talks.   The Czech delegate ex-
 pressed concern that the peoples
 of the world will be disap-
 pointed if the talks are limited
 to technical,  "academic" ques-
 tions of weapons and inspection.
 He then linked technical prob-
 lems with policies of "certain
 great powers" which endanger
 the peace by such means as fly-
 ing aircraft laden with nuclear
 weapons.
 tsov, a diplomat of considerable  ;         The Albanian delegate
 tactical skill and experience,              brought up the Rapacki demili-  -
 to handle this difficult nego-    ' tarization plan, describing it as
 tiating task,                     t being "urgent and realistic."
 At the second session, on
 11 November, Kuznetsov insisted
 that an inspection system not
 combined with definite disarma-
 ment measures would promote rath-
 er           than  hinder the prospects
 of a surprise attack, since the
 Kuznetsov then deprecated West-
 ern insistence on separating
 technical discussions on sur-
 prise attack from political
 considerations as implying that
 the experts were so naive as to
 be unaware of the simple facts
 in this regard.
 Argentine President Fron-
 dizi's suspension of constitu-
 tional guarantees for 30 days
 on 11 November springs from his
 determination to push forward
 his oil policy and to  crack
 down on Peronista and Communist
 agitation.   His action, which
 was precipitated by the petro-
 leum workers' strike demanding
 cancellation of government oil
 development contracts with Amer-
 ican firms, increases his depend-
 ence on the armed forces.   The
 military backed Frondizi during
 an  abortive coup attempt on 12
 November, which was apparently
 encouraged by the spreading
 labor unrest.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 13 November 1958
 Congress were summoned on 13
 November to consider impeach-
 ing him for refusing to name
 the plotters.     For some weeks
 Gomez has urged a check on
 Peronista and Communist agita-
 tion, which Frondizi denounced
 in his 9 November warning to
 the strikers.
 Frondizi's charges that
 the strike was part of a sub-
 versive plan by Communists and
 Peronistas to create unrest and
 restore  a  dictatorship  have
 some basis in fact.  The petro-
 leum workers' association is
 headed by a Peronista and in-
 filtrated by Communists.                       While
 the oil workers' strike is es-
 sentially political, challeng-
 ing a key government policy,
 both Communists and Peronistas
 have been exploiting high liv-
 ing costs to gain support for
 their agitation.
 Recent Communist agitation
 has   emphasized  three  major
 themes attacking the govern-
 ment.  On the cost-of-living
 issue, propaganda has been sup-
 plemented with Communist ef-
 forts to organize neighborhood
 protest committees.  Communists
 were active in promoting vio-
 lence and demonstrations pro-
 testing the Frondizi-sponsored
 law permitting private universi-
 ties.  They have denounced as
 a sellout to "imperialism" the
 government petroleum contracts
 with Western firms--mostly US--
 for more than $400,000,000 worth
 of goods and services and con-
 tinuing negotiations for double
 that amount.  They say these
 are unnecessary in view of bloc
 offers.
 The Soviet offer of last
 July to supply $100,000,000
 worth of petroleum equipment
 on credit was formalized in an
 agreement signed in Moscow on
 27 October calling for payment
 over ten years at 2.5 percent.
 No specific purchases were men-
 tioned in the contract or have
 been confirmed by Argentine
 official sources.
 The Peronistas, who along
 with the Communists backed Fron-
 dizi's election last February,
 declared on 9 November a policy
 of  open  opposition  to  the
 administration.    This  will
 weaken Frondizi's influence
 among labor and increase his
 reliance  on  the  armed  forces
 to counter aggressive labor
 tactics.  He seems still firmly
 in control of the situation,
 but labor unrest will probably
 continue.

 CON IDENAL
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 13 November 1958
 Premier de Gaulle's plan
 to work out a permanent Algeri-
 an  settlement with the Algerian
 deputies to be elected to the
 French National Assembly on 28
 November has been undercut by
 the conspicuous absence of na-
 tionalist Moslem and liberal
 European candidates.   The in-
 ability and unwillingness of
 "all political tendencies" to
 present themselves in the face
 of indirect French Army and
 settler opposition and of rebel
 intimidation may force De Gaulle
 to seek another mechanism for
 a settlement.
 The vast majority of both
 129 Moslem and 68 European
 candidates on the 52 lists filed
 before the 9 November deadline
 profess support for the army
 and settler line of integration
 of Algeria with France.   The be-
 lated entrance of five Social-
 ist lists, which comprise most
 of the "opposition," was appar-
 ently instigated by Socialist
 party leaders in Paris.
 Although the army ostensi-
 bly obeyed De Gaulle's order
 to get out of politics and en-
 sure free elections, the lib-
 eral ex-mayor of Algiers, Jacques
 Chevallier,  has charged the
 army with rigging the elections.
 A high French civil official
 admits that the army generals
 acting as prefects "discour-
 aged," if not actually pro-
 hibited, candidates they did
 not favor.
 Ambassador Hoppenot, head
 of the commission supervising
 the elections, expressed "dis-
 appointment" to the American
 consul general on 8 November,
 stating that the Moslems were
 afraid of both the army and the
 Algerian National Liberation
 Front (FLN).   Although he saw
 no hope of the kind of electoral
 competition De Gaulle envisaged,
 Hoppenot ruled out the possibil-
 ity  of postponing the elections.
 A postponement, he explained,
 would be violently attacked by
 the Europeans and would force
 De Gaulle to explain that the
 action was necessary because of
 army and rebel pressure.
 De Gaulle, who reportedly
 was disturbed over the lack of
 "desirable" condidates, now may
 have to modify his plan of nego-
 tiating with duly elected Al-
 gerian representatives.   Impend-
 ing municipal elections may pro-
 duce a better balanced Moslem
 representation, but these do not
 come until April.
 As an alternative the pre-
 mier may attempt new overtures
 to the FLN, but political consid-
 erations in France will force
 him to avoid any gesture imply-
 ing recognition of this body as
 chief spokesman for Algerian
 Moslems.   Contacts reportedly
 continue with the FLN despite
 its rejection of De Gaulle's in-
 vitation to come to Paris to
 arrange a cease-fire.   In any
 event, hopes for an early solu-
 tion for Algeria have dimmed
 considerably, and the election
 of "hand-picked" Algerian repre-
 sentatives in the French Nation- 25X1
 al Assembly will almost certain-
 ly complicate a reasonable solu-
 tion.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 13 November 1958
 Speaking before the Chinese
 Communist party's central com-
 mittee propaganda department on
 10 November, Premier and polit-
 buro member Chou En-lai outlined
 a massive propaganda campaign
 to rationalize Peiping's avoid-
 ance of hostilities with the
 United  States  in  the  Taiwan
 Strait area.  Chou linked the
 "paper tiger" theme with an "ex-
 planation" of Peiping's position
 on the situation, citing a se-
 ries of events from World War
 II to the present to "prove"
 Mao's thesis that imperialist
 nations are really hollow shells
 which will inevitably collapse.
 The Chinese Communists are de-
 scribing the "paper tiger" the-
 ory as "our sharpest ideological
 weapon in the struggle against
 imperialism" and are stressing
 that the demise of the West is
 inevitable, although it may be
 some time in coming.
 In a recent con-
 versation  with  an
 American official,
 Chinese Nationalist
 Vice Foreign Minis-
 ter            Chou Shu-kai
 said that if forced
 to choose between
 acceptance of "two
 Chinas" and a "deal"
 with the Chinese
 Communists, the in-
 dividuals now "con-
 stituting" the Na-
 tionalist Government
 would "of course
 choose the lesser of
 two evils--two Chi-
 nas. "
 Chou said, how-
 ever, that this ap-
 plied only to the
 present dominant ma-
 jority.  He thought
 that some National-
 ist "fringe elements"
 might choose differ-
 ently, and that in
 the "remote" event of a coup
 d'etat or some other event bring-
 ing them to power, Nationalist
 China might conclude such a
 deal.  Chou did not elaborate
 on the identity of the "fringe
 elements," and his remarks may
 have been intended to influence
 the United States away from adop-
 tion of a "two Chinas" policy.
 Peiping resumed its warn-
 ings to the United States for
 alleged violations of its 12-
 mile territorial waters.  The
 "41st serious warning;' issued
 on 12 November, charged that on
 11 November an  American C-54
 transport "intruded" over the
 Kwangtung Province coastal area
 and an F-86D jet fighter "in-
 truded" territorial air space
 in the Matsu area.  This is the
 first warning since 22 October,
 when the 39th and 40th were is-
 sued.

 No significant developments
 have been reflected in Communist
 military  activity  during  the
 week.    Artillery firing on "odd"
 days has been light and sporadic.
 The Nationalists on 11 November
 alleged that a Communist loud-
 speaker on Amoy had announced
 that "the cease-fire on even
 days is hereby abolished.  Shell-
 ing is possible any day."                 There
 was no official comment from
 Peiping,and Communist guns were
 silent on 12 November.  The Na-
 tionalists have withdrawn con-
 firmation of the loud-speaker
 broadcast, and the Taiwan Defense
 Command considers it highly un-
 likely that the broadcast ac-
 tually occurred as reported.
 Further  examination  of
 Chinese Communist and National-
 ist chemical warfare capabili-
 ties has revealed that the Na-
 tionalists  do  not  have                         any
 capability for  manufacturing
 toxic agents or any facility
 for filling CW shells.  The US
 has not given the Nationalists
 any such munitions since World
 War II,and the Japanese did not
 leave any?toxic agents on Tai-
 wan when they left the island.
 The Chinese Communist Army has
 a small capability to employ
 CW toxic agents based on a lim-
 ited manufacturing capability.
 Despite continuing bad
 weather in the Taiwan Strait,
 the Chinese Nationalists de-
 livered  approximately 10,300
 tons of supplies to Chinmen
 between 1 and 10 November and
 are scheduling an additional
 7,000 tons for delivery between
 10 and 17 November.  The Taiwan
 Defense Command comments that
 this is more than  doubleE  the
 normal tonnage required.  Re-
 cent shipments have included
 heavy equipment, tanks, gun
 tubes, and heavy maintenance
 and construction items. "
 Japanese Prime Minister
 Kishi's prestige has been dam-
 aged and his control of the
 ruling Liberal-Democratic party
 possibly weakened by the par-
 liamentary crisis arising from
 attempts to railroad through
 the Diet a, controversial bill
 to strengthen police powers.
 The Socialists are boycotting
 the Diet and have stimulated
 nationwide opposition to the
 government's admittedly "ir-
 regular"  tactics in seeking
 passage of the bill.
 Surprisingly strong Social-
 ist opposition, reinforced by
 nationwide labor walkouts and
 unusually vitriolic press de-
 nunciation of the government's
 handling of the bill, caught
 conservative leaders unaware.
 A subsequent move by the ruling
 party to extend the special
 Diet session by questionable
 means in order to permit the
 bill to remain under active
 consideration only increased
 criticism of the government.
 The Socialists are charg-
 ing that the bill would restore
 the prewar "police state" and
 realize that its passage would
 severely limit their ability
 to use mass demonstrations,
 labor walkouts, and extremist
 tactics to gain support for
 their parliamentary position.
 Conversely, failure of the bill
 would encourage greater use of
 such tactics and weaken the
 government's will and ability
 to use the powers it now has
 to curb leftist activities.
 Kishi, recognizing his
 vulnerability, has offered to
 compromise on some provisions
 of the bill and to delay its
 consideration until the regular

 session of the Diet in early
 December.   Socialist leaders,
 on the other hand, have re-
 jected these offers and insisted
 that the bill be withdrawn com-
 pletely.   Continued refusal by
 the Socialists to compromise
 or resume Diet proceedings,
 however, might result in loss
 of public sympathy for their
 position.
 Socialist leaders believe
 that if the bill can be defeated
 Kishi will be dealt a serious
 political blow, and that sim-
 ilar tactics can be used a-
 gainst negotiations with the
 US to revise the security
 treaty.   Leaders within Kishi's
 own party, including former
 Prime Minister Ishibashi, are
 criticizing his handling of the
 bill and questioning his leader-
 ship.  While there is no im-
 mediate danger of the govern-
 ment's fall,  the extent to which
 the position of Kishi and the
 conservatives has been jeopard-
 ized may be revealed in the
 elections to the upper house
 and in a possible challenge to
 Kishi for the party president
 in the s rin  of 1959.
 The military regime in Pak-
 istan under President Ayub is
 giving priority to those re-
 form measures which are likely
 to maintain the popular impres-
 sion of rapid progress made by
 the new administration to date.
 Initial enthusiasm over the re-
 gime's "clean-up" campaign dur-
 ing the first month of martial
 law has begun to wane, and the
 government is under increasing
 pressure to demonstrate further
 achievements.   Meanwhile,  polit-
 ical elements are planning
 covertly how they might resume
 some form of limited activity.
 Top civil administrators
 have conceded that the regime's
 lack of long-range objectives
 and effective planning is mak-
 ing it difficult to maintain
 the pace of the "revolution."
 Ayub is pressing a commission
 of experts to produce a program
 for immediate land reform,
 which he regards as the most
 urgent problem on the domestic
 front.  The regime has brushed
 aside warnings that precipitate
 action might upset the economy
 and retard rather than increase
 food production.
 Members of the business
 community in Karachi are ex-
 pressing concern over the con-
 tinuing standstill in commercial
 activity.   Businessmen, who were
 hit hard by the stringent mar-
 tial-law regulations and by
 price controls, have largely
 suspended operations until the
 financial outlook becomes
 clearer.   Resultant shortages
 of commodities and a return to
 previous price levels have
 moderated the initially favor-
 able public reaction to the
 military administration.
 Signs of political activ-
 ity are beginning to reappear,
 although most politicians are
 continuing to lie low for fear
 of arrest.   The Moslem League
 is likely to be the first of
 the now defunct parties to
 resume operation, since it is
 the only political organization
 which finds some acceptance

 INDIAN PARLIAMENT FACES CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES
 The session of the Indian
 Parliament opening on 17 Novem-
 ber is likely to be highlighted
 by discussions of controversial
 questions on which the Congress
 party is finding it increasing-
 ly difficult to defend itself.
 In addition to such chronic
 problems as lagging food pro-
 duction,  five-year-plan finances,
 and party rifts in several key
 states,  government leaders may
 be challenged on three poten-
 tially explosive questions--
 the situation in Communist-gov-
 erned Kerala State,  the linguis-
 tic problem in Bombay State,
 and a government financial
 scandal involving V. K. Krishna
 Menon.
 An attempt in September by
 the non-Communist opposition to
 raise the question of maladmin-
 istration in Kerala was ruled
 out by the speaker.   However,
 this maneuver, which reflected
 growing criticism of the Com-
 munist government's handling of
 civil disturbances in Kerala,
 caused a stir in Parliament and
 put the Communists on the de-
 fensive at the national level.
 Opposition sentiment remains
 strong as a result of continued
 strikes and repressive police
 action in Kerala.   The opportu-
 nity to publicize Communist dif-
 ficulties during the coming par-
 liamentary session is almost
 certain to be exploited by anti-
 Communist elements.
 Agitation in Bombay State
 for a division of that region
 into separate linguistic states
 is again on the increase, rais-
 ing the possibility that Parlia-
 ment will be asked to reconsider
 the two-year-old legislation
 which, despite local resistance,
 established Bombay as a large
 unilingual state.   Prime Minis-
 ter Nehru, taking note in Sep-
 tember of the increasing agita-
 tion and deploring the use of
 violent methods, implied that
 he would not oppose parliamen-
 tary action to amend the 1956
 reorganization.   Certain ele-
 ments in the Congress high com-
 mand are still firmly opposed
 to a division of the state,
 however, as indicated by the
 recent decision of the national
 executive to unite  the separate
 party branches in Bombay--long
 organized along linguistic lines
 --into a single state-wide or-
 ganization.
 Efforts may  also be  re-
 newed during the coming parlia-
 mentary session to discuss re-
 ports that Krishna Menon, while
 serving as India's high commis-
 sioner in London in 1951, became
 involved in a much-publicized
 scandal over an Indian Govern-
 ment purchase of jeeps in 1951

 ELECTIONS SCHEDULED IN NEPAL
 Nepal is scheduled to con-
 duct its first experiment with
 a popularly elected government--
 eight years after the revolu-
 tion of 1950-51 which was to
 bring democracy to the country.
 King Mahendra announced on 9
 November that elections to the
 lower house of a new parliament
 would begin on 18 February 1959.
 These elections, for 107 of 109
 seats, will extend over 45 days
 because of Nepal's
 rugged terrain and
 the shortage  of
 trained personnel.
 Elections for,the
 additional two seats,
 from constituencies
 in remote western Ne-
 pal, will be held
 later.
 In 1951 a Nepa-
 lese revolutionary
 movement, with some
 Indian support, de-
 posed a family  of
 hereditary prime min-
 isters  which   had
 ruled for a century.
 Since none of the po-
 litical parties was
 able to establish a
 stable government
 after the revolution, a series
 of provisional governments, at
 times quasi-parliamentary in
 form and sometimes involving
 direct rule by the King, have
 administered the country for
 the past eight years.
 On 1 February 1958, King
 Mahendra announced a firm five-
 point program leading to nation-
 al elections.   This program has
 proceeded fairly smoothly in its
 mechanical aspects, and irre-
 sponsible political activity
 has been curbed.
 The elections will be held
 under a new constitution drafted
 by Nepalese and foreign experts.
 An upper house will be chosen
 by the King and his advisers.
 The prime minister and his cab-
 inet will be responsible to par-
 liament.   The King presumably
 will retain ultimate power.   He
 must pass on the constitution,
 which was presented to him on
 2 November, prior to its pro-
 mulgation.
 At present, only the mod-
 erate socialist Nepali Congress
 party, led by former Home Min-
 ister B. P. Koirala, seems to
 have enough  strength to win a

 the Communist party,  but it is

 The progress of South Ko-
 rea's financial stabilization
 program has been halted by a
 sudden increase of currency in
 circulation, resulting in a 6.5-
 percent rise in the wholesale
 price index in September and
 October.   Increased bank credits
 and doubled wages for all gov-
 ernment and military personnel
 are primarily responsible,  but
 poor fiscal operations and un-
 realistic budget planning are
 also to blame.   Inflation prob-
 ably will continue for the next
 few months at least.
 The stabilization program,
 implemented in mid-1957, suc-
 ceeded for the first time in
 ten years in rolling back prices,
 which had risen to more than
 230 times their 1947 level. A
 controlled expansion of currency
 in circulation--generally ef-
 fective except for some overex-
 pansion in December 1957--to-
 gether with increased arrivals
 of American aid goods and a
 modest industrial build-up, con-
 tributed to the program's suc-
 cess.
 South Korean economic of-
 ficials attempted to limit cur-
 rency in circulation to $320,-
 000,000 during 1958.   By the
 end of September,  however,  this
 limit had been exceeded by $12,-
 000,000, with traditional year-
 end expansion still to  come.
 Planned increases in bank cred-
 its and crop loans, apparent
 overestimation by government
 officials of tax revenue, and
 a drop in aid goods strongly
 suggest that the deterioration
 will continue well into 1959.
 Minister of Finance Kim
 Hyon-.chol has stated that his
 government is determined to de-
 press prices by tightening con-
 trols on the money supply.   The
 average wholesale price index
 for the last six months of 1958,
 however,  is threatening to ex-
 ceed the level at which, accord-
 ing to a South Korean agree-
 ment with the United States in
 September 1955,  the exchange
 rate must be revised.
 In late 1957, the  South
 Korean Government was able to
 control the price level so as
 not to require a revision of the
 exchange rate.   Conditions this
 year are far less favorable,
 and Minister Kim has not out-
 lined his specific intentions
 for monetary controls.   One
 Korean press report states,
 however,  that Seoul is about to
 seek a revision of the 1955         25X1
 agreement to assure that the
 exchange rate is not altered
 the end of this  year.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SINO-SOVIET BLOC ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE IN INDONESIA
 Since the Sino-Soviet bloc
 economic drive in  Indonesia
 got under way seriously in late
 1957, Djakarta has  accepted
 about $200,000,000  worth of
 bloc economic aid offers and,
 in addition, the bloc  has a-
 greed to deliver by 1959  at
 least $170,000,000 worth of
 military equipment.   At least
 270 bloc economic technicians
 are now in Indonesia, and about
 170 military specialists are
 assembling bloc equipment and
 training Indonesians in  its
 use.
 The bloc is also intensi-
 fying           a trade  drive in Indo-
 nesia.   Reports  indicate that
 Indonesian trade with the bloc
 in 1958 will surpass the pre-
 vious peak level of $74,000,000
 in 1955.   Reduced Indonesian
 economic activity this year
 will increase the importance of
 bloc trade.
 Bloc arms deliveries  are
 continuing according to schedule.
 Materiel supplied thus far has
 consisted mainly of land arms
 and aircraft, but some  naval
 equipment--motor torpedo boats
 and landing craft--may  also
 have been delivered by  Soviet
 merchant ships.   In October
 four subchasers   were turned
 over to the Indonesian Navy.
 The USSR has preferred to
 have other members of the bloc
 act as suppliers of these arms.
 Although Poland and Czechoslo-
 vakia extended military credits
 to Djakarta, some of the equip-
 ment purchased under these agree-
 ments has been of Soviet origin.
 Communist China for
 its part has facili-
 tated the delivery
 of aircraft to Indo-
 nesia by permitting
 overflights.
 The bloc already
 has signed $140,000,-
 000 worth of contracts
 --65 percent of total
 bloc economic aid of-
 fered Indonesia--to
 supply a wide range
 of goods and assist-
 ance.   Under these
 credits, Poland and
 the USSR are supplying
 36 ships, China has
 shipped rice and tex-
 tiles, and East Ger-
 many and Czechslo-
 vakia are construct-
 ing a sugar factory
 and a tire plant.   The USSR, re-
 sponsible for one half of total
 bloc economic aid, is making
 foreign exchange available and
 is conducting transport and
 geological surveys.
 Communist China continues
 to be Indonesia's major bloc
 trading partner,  and this trade
 is expanding.   Peiping is sup-
 plying rice for the first time--
 about 20 percent of the 800,000
 tons of rice being  imported
 this year. By extending credits,

 Peiping also is assuring it-
 self of an important share of
 Indonesia's textile market.
 Bloc purchases are pri-
 marily limited to rubber,  Indo-
 nesia's major export.   During
 the first half of this year
 China and the USSR purchased
 12 percent of Indonesia's rub-
 ber exports, compared with 7
 percent in 1957.   Communist
 China and Czechoslovakia alone
 reportedly have already agreed
 to buy at least 10 percent of
 Indonesia's estimated rubber
 exports in 1958.
 CATHOLICS IN NORTH VIETNAM
 The recent expulsion:  of
 four of the 20 foreign Catholic
 priests in North  Vietnam for
 acts "contrary to law and harm-
 ful to security" is the latest
 move in Hanoi's efforts to con-
 trol the country's Catholic
 minority.   One of the four,  a
 Canadian, has already arrived
 in Hong Kong after traveling
 through Communist China.
 The expulsions follow re-
 cent efforts by Hanoi to ac-
 commodate the Catholics.   The
 state-sponsored "Committee of
 Patriotic and Peace-loving
 Catholics" permitted requiem
 masses and the tolling of bells
 following the death of  Pope
 Pius XII,  and on   30 October
 extended "greetings"  to the
 new pontiff.   This contrasts
 markedly with the policy of
 the Chinese Communists, who,
 except for charging American
 collusion in the papal  elec-
 tion,, have remained silent on
 all recent Vatican  develop-
 ments.   North Vietnam, however,
 with a proportionately larger
 Catholic minority than China,
 may have wanted  to avoid any
 action which might provoke op-
 position requiring  harsh re-
 pression.
 The nearly 400,000 Cath-
 olics in North Vietnam appear
 to  be among  the most  vocal
 critics of the regime and the
 most militant in their refusal
 to conform.   There were major
 outbreaks in Nghe An Province
 between Catholics and govern-
 ment troops in 1956 and 1957,
 and
 some 2,000 Catholic  you  s
 clashed with police last March.
 Hanoi's policy has alter-
 nated between conciliation and
 harsh repression, and it has
 used both friendly  gestures
 and warnings   to discourage
 antiregime  demonstrations.
 After the army's suppression
 of a three-day uprising in a
 Catholic area in November 1956,
 Hanoi reverted to a particular-
 ly conciliatory line. Pro-Com-
 munist Catholic leaders and
 newly formed lay groups  were
 encouraged  to  hold  special
 services for Catholic "comrades"
 killed in the war against the
 French.   Cadres were directed
 to appoint Catholics to village
 agricultural executive commit-
 tees and to restore and repair
 churches "requisitioned" during
 the land-reform program.
 Six months later, however,
 Hanoi began denouncing individ-
 ual priests  in the press, ac-
 cusing the church of "political
 activities prejudicial to the
 policy of the state and the
 laws of the country."
 Hanoi has sought to pro-
 mote a "reliable" Vietnamese
 clergy which could influence
 the Catholic laity to support
 the regime, and, in their ef-
 forts to promote the "Committee
 of Patriotic and Peace-loving

 Catholics," the Communists have
 allowed Catholics a certain
 amount of freedom.  The regime
 now may feel that the time is
 ripe to weed out the political
 liabilities represented by the
 few remaining foreign priests
 and thereby to enhance the ef-
 fectiveness of the state-spon-
 sored church as a propa anda
 arm of the government.
 Observations of recent
 visitors to China and Peiping's
 own policies with respect to
 food and cloth rationing do
 not bear out Communist China's
 statements about its "amazing"
 increases in agricultural pro-
 duction.   Although good weather
 and a massive effort in  the
 countryside undoubtedly brought
 about substantial increases in
 most agricultural products this
 year, most of the regime's
 claims seem out of touch with
 reality.
 Peiping says this year's
 grain output will reach 350,-
 000,000 tons, 90 percent more
 than last year and about equal
 to the combined output of North
 America, Australia, Africa, and
 Western Europe.  Cotton produc-
 tion, Peiping says, will more
 than double last year's, thus
 enabling China to outstrip the
 United States in this field.
 In the past, Peiping's
 crop "estimates" have been high
 early in the year--although not
 as high as this year's claims--
 and have been subsequently trimmed
 downward.    This    year,   how-
 ever, the regime thus far shows
 no inclination to back down from
 early predictions, which in some
 cases are actually being in-

 of Soviet war veterans, has not
 been borne out.        Yugoslav For-
 eign Secretary Koca Popovic
 declared on 29 October to Selwyn
 Lloyd in London that the present
 hostile Soviet attitude toward
 Yugoslavia would "last for a
 protracted period."
 Although the participants
 in the dispute continue to pay
 lip service to a desire to im-
 prove relations, none yet ap-
 pears willing to let the re-
 criminations subside.  Basic
 ideological divergencies remain
 and outweigh those factors that
 could point to a modus vivendi.
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev, in
 a speech on 10 November, said
 he would strive to develop
 friendly relations with Yugosla-
 via "along the state line" and
 to continue trade when mutually
 advantageous.   He added, how-
 ever, that the bloc would wage
 an "irreconcilable struggle"
 against Yugoslav "revisionism,"
 and said be believed Yugoslavia's
 leaders were becoming enemies
 of the working class.
 Attacks of varying inten-
 sity against Belgrade's foreign
 policies continue, and public
 condemnation of Yugoslav "re-
 visionism" is again prominent
 in bloc propaganda.   Most
 recently, the Yugoslavs have
 been sharply condemned in sev-
 eral speeches made by satellite
 leaders on the 41st anniversary
 of the Russian revolution.
 Yugoslav diplomats attending
 ceremonies in East Berlin, Sofia,
 and Tirana walked out in protest.
 The Yugoslavs have ap-
 parently managed to maintain
 some influence among the satel-
 lites.  Furthermore, the Yugo-
 slav party's new monthly re-
 view, Socialism, first published
 in early October, made it clear
 that Belgrade had in no way
 modified the heretical concepts
 put forth at the Yugoslav party
 congress last April, which
 precipitated the present,dis-
 pute.   Yugoslav party secretary
 Vukmanovic-Tempo, in an attack
 particularly on the Chinese,
 Bulgarian, and Albanian roles
 in the anti-Yugoslav campaign,
 on 9 October reaffirmed Bel-
 grade's belief that Yugoslav
 views on the "development of
 socialism" will triumph.
 Yugoslavia's voluminous
 contribution to the polemics
 shows that Belgrade has no in-
 tention of ignoring bloc chal-
 lenges to its position.   The
 Rumanian-Czech party-state
 declaration of 22 October and
 an earlier East German - Bul-
 garian statement have been con-
 demned by the Yugoslavs as
 efforts to establish a pattern
 for attacking Yugoslavia.   Bel-
 grade has linked these decla-
 rations with the Khrushchev-
 Mao communiqud of last August
 calling for the eradication of
 Yugoslav "revisionism."
 Albanian attacks on Yugo-
 slav minority policies have
 recently increased in intensity.
 Albanian Premier Shehu declared
 on 26 October that Tirana will
 attack the "bloody Tito regime"
 until'Albanians in Yugoslavia
 are granted the "same elementary
 rights as any other minority
 in a bourgeois state."  The
 Yugoslavs have countered with
 accusations that the Albanians
 are threatening the peace, and
 Belgrade has sharply attacked
 them for harassing Yugoslav
 diplomats in Tirana.   Grotewohl's
 recent attack on Yugoslav pol-
 icies and Belgrade's sharp re-
 joinder precipitated a marked
 deterioration in Yugoslav -
 East German relations.  While
 these charges appear sufficient
 to warrant a break in diplomatic

 relations, apparently neither
 Yugoslavia nor the bloc de-
 sires such a development at
 this time.
 Abandoning its customary
 defensive attitude in the dis-
 pute, Yugoslavia has taken the
 initiative on two issues which
 could easily expand differences
 with the bloc.  An article in
 the Yugoslav: press has welcomed
 the granting of the Nobel Prize
 to Boris Pasternak, who is de-
 scribed  as  one  of  the most
 "significant of living Soviet
 poets," and as having  "great
 merits in preserving Russian
 epic traditions."   This atti-
 tude reportedly has caused
 enough concern for Moscow to
 request Belgrade not to pub-
 lish Pasternak's book in Yugo-
 slavia.
 Belgrade also has attacked
 the Chinese Communists' commune
 drive, probably hoping to pro-
 mote its own system of communes
 in order to embarrass.Peiping.
 In contrast to the Yugoslav
 system, the Chinese drive is
 described by Belgrade's prop-     25X1
 aganda media as "truly a terror
 exercised over the Chinese peas-
 antry.
 Additional  reports  now
 confirm a resurgence of anti-
 regime hostility in Rumania
 during the first six months of
 1956, particularly among peas-
 ants and industrial workers.
 This apparently prompted the
 Rumanian leadership to expand,
 in late summer and early fall,
 what was to have been a routine
 crackdown  on  the  party  and
 government bureaucracy.
 peasants in the region
 of Brasov last June resisted
 the efforts of officials of the
 Ministry of Agriculture to col-
 lect wheat.  When the officials
 called in the security police,
 the peasants burned the wheat
 and, in some cases, the har-
 vesting machinery.  The wealth-
 ier peasants and others who had
 been members of prewar politi-
 cal parties, fearing retalia-
 tion, reportedly fled to the
 surrounding mountains.
 workers in Brasov agitated for
 increased salaries, improved
 working and living conditions,
 and an end to "Stakhanovite"
 production methods.  Regional
 party and union officials, con-
 trary to usual practice, re-
 portedly went to the factory
 where the protests had origi-
 nated and organized meetings
 for the purpose of bringing
 the grievances to the atten-
 tion of regime officials in
 Bucharest.
 When police, presumably
 acting with the cognizance of
 the Ministry of Interior, ar-
 rested the organizers, the
 workers reportedly seized the
 factory buildings, demonstrated
 in the city square, and called
 on other workers in Brasov to
 support their demands.  The
 local police, seriously under
 strength since many of their
 units had been sent to the
 countryside the previous month,
 were forced to release their
 prisoners, and security troops
 and militia from neighboring
 cities had to be called in to
 restore order.

 Popular unrest in the in-
 dustrial and agricultural sec-
 tors has been a continuing prob-
 lem for the Rumanian regime,
 and,prior to June of this year,
 the regime has tended to follow
 a conciliatory line when faced
 with unrest or  threats from
 workers or peasants,
 With the continuation of
 unrest during the first half of
 this year, however, the Rumanian
 regime abandoned its equivocal
 tactics and began cracking down.
 Thus,  the campaign launched at
 the party plenum in June to re-
 duce corruption and bureaucratic
 overhead,  and to overcome ideo-
 logical backsliding among party
 members and the intelligentsia;
 was expanded to embrace workers
 and other potentially dissident
 elements of the population. Pos-
 session of labor cards  was
 made mandatory for purposes of
 employment, housing, and medical
 care, and it was decided on 13
 August not to hold the long-
 scheduled congress  of trade
 unions until after the regime's
 hand could be strengthened by
 a reorganization of the trade
 unions.   More recently, it has
 created "factory courts" em-
 powered to impose  fines  and
 other punishments, including
 confiscation of property, for
 nonfulfillment of production
 quotas or negligence leading
 to the breakdown of machinery.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The USSR, which must aug-
 ment its foreign-exchange earn-
 ings in order to expand  its
 chemical industry with Western
 equipment, is finding it in-
 creasingly difficult to expand
 exports to Western Europe.   The
 volume of trade among free-world
 countries this year has been
 generally lower, but smaller
 European countries are reluc-
 tant to buy more from the USSR
 at the expense of trade with
 traditional suppliers.   Both
 Denmark and Italy have asked
 that Moscow settle its import
 surplus in convertible currency
 rather than in Soviet goods,
 and Belgium has stopped grant-
 ing credits under its payments
 agreement with the USSR, as
 they had become a means for
 financing a chronic import
 surplus by the USSR.
 Through polite   threats,
 Moscow is increasingly promot-
 ing bilateral trade relations.
 Western Europe countries often
 are pressed either to switch
 imports to the USSR in order
 to reduce the trade credits
 they hold there or else to se-
 cure new Soviet orders. France,
 "encouraged" by recent heavy
 Soviet purchases of French equip-
 ment,  now may purchase up  to
 215,000 tons of Soviet wheat.

 Finland must either  divert
 purchases from the West to the
 USSR in order to balance Mos-
 cow's import surplus with Fin-
 land, or else suffer a cut in
 Soviet purchases, an act which
 would affect the level of em-

 COMMUNIST CLANDESTINE ACTIVITY IN WEST GERMANY
 Bonn government officials
 have expressed increased appre-
 hension over the inability of
 the federal police authorities
 to combat underground Communist
 activities.   Their concern has
 been aroused by the discovery
 of a serious case of espionage
 in the West German armed forces
 and the recent detection of
 extensive Communist propaganda
 activity in the industrialized
 Rhine-Ruhr area.   The volume of
 Communist propaganda material
 has increased markedly since
 the beginning of the year, al-
 though the federal police es-
 timate that only about half the
 illegal literature has been
 confiscated.
 Since the West German Com-
 munist party  (KPD) was banned
 in August 1956, Communist sub-
 versive-operations have been
 directed to a'greater degree
 from the East Zone and supported
 by,an estimated $720,000  to
 $960,000 a month.   The volume

 icals is increasing each month.

 1958, and 1,340,000 individual
 propaganda letters were confis-
 cated from couriers traveling
 from the East Zone during 1957.
 About 166 illegal factory news-
 papers are published in West
 Germany.

 arrested 870 Communist agents
 for distributing illegal litera-
 ture between August 1956 and
 August 1958, and about 7,500

 with agricultural surpluses in

 in May, has already resulted
 in contracts  for  more  than

 relations with the USSR.  Both
 President Kekkonen and the rad-
 ical element within the Agrar-
 ian party are reportedly ac-
 tively seeking to replace the
 incumbent cabinet with one more
 acceptable to the USSR.
 Fagerholm's difficulties
 in keeping his government in
 power are increased by the
 feuds within the Social Demo-
 cratic party and Finland?s cen-
 tral trade union organization,
 the Confederation of Trade
 Unions (SAK).    SAK  is  con-
 trolled by the dissident, anti-
 government Social Democrats,
 and in late October the "regu-
 lar" Social Democrats organized
 a rival trade union organiza-
 tion.   Since the Communists
 comprise an estimated 40 to 45
 percent of SAK's membership,
 further defections would en-
 able the Communists to play an
 increasingly decisive role.
 A meeting of the Social
 Democratic party council has
 been set for 29 November in
 one more effort to end the
 parallel quarrels.   Prime Min-
 ister Fagerholm has recently
 conferred with the Social Demo-
 cratic opposition leaders and
 the chairman of SAK, presum-
 ably in an effort to re-estab-
 lish unity negotiations, and
 there are rumors that cabinet
 posts will be offered the dis-
 sident Social Democrats.   In
 his effort to save his govern-
 ment, Fagerholm will also make
 special efforts to avoid of-
 fending the USSR.
 Agrarian efforts to un-
 seat Fagerholm, however,  are
 likely to continue.  His fall,
 ostensibly on domestic issues,
 would result in difficult and
 long-drawn-out negotiations.
 Unless new elections are called
 by  the  President,  the  most
 likely  result  would be  an
 Agrarian-led government--either
 a minority cabinet dependent on
 Communist (SKDL) and opposition
 Social Democratic parliamentary
 support, or a majority government
 including those groups.
 SPANISH SOCIALISTS INCLINING TOWARD JOINT ACTION WITH COMMUNISTS
 Spanish Socialist leaders
 in exile in southern France
 are under increasing pressure
 from their followers in Spain
 to permit collaboration with
 the Communists in peaceful
 strikes and demonstrations in
 order to avoid losing the ini-

 With benefits of the 1956 wage
 boost wiped out by steadily
 rising living costs, such joint
 action, particularly with An-
 archist party participation,
 could lead to unprecedented
 worker agitation in the coming
 months.
 Socialists in Spain be-
 lieve that the Spanish Commu-

 over the clandestine Socialist
 and Anarchist parties and labor
 unions because of its foreign
 financial support and its clan-

 13 November 1958
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 PEIPING'S HARD-LINE FOREIGN POLICY
 The Chinese Communists have
 adopted a new hard approach to
 advance their basic foreign pol-
 icy goals--international accept-
 ance, reduction of US influence
 on Western governments,  and ero-
 sion of US authority in the Far
 East.   They apparently expect
 that an atmosphere of tension
 at this time will induce peoples
 of non-Communist countries to
 exert pressure on their govern-
 ments in favor of a "wholesale"
 change in attitude toward recog-
 nition of the eight-year-old
 Peiping regime.
 In their current effort,
 however,  the Chinese Communist
 leaders have not returned tc
 Stalin's policy of relegating
 all non-Communist countries--
 including the "noncommitted"--
 to the sphere of the capitalist,
 "enemy" camp.   Peiping is highly
 selective in applying its hard
 tactics.
 Moderate tactics apparently
 now are considered to be useful
 only after a "struggle" and dead
 lock.   On 8 August, a People's
 Daily editorial provided    clear
 summation of this view of for-
 eign affairs when it stated:
 "Long historical experience has
 proved it is necessary to strug-
 gle resolutely against the im-
 perialist aggressive bloc in
 order to relax international ten-
 sions and safeguard world peace."
 The major factors in con-
 ditioning the Chinese Communist
 leaders to this hard-line policy
 probably were a real sense of
 irritation with the slow progress
 of their previous somewhat con-
 ciliatory policy, and the con-
 viction that the USSR has raised
 the bloc to a position of con-
 siderable strength, while the
 US has been subject to considera-
 ble criticism from its allies.
 Peiping tried the hard line in
 July 1957, when it blasted the
 Japanese Government for its re-
 quirement that Chinese Commu-
 nist delegates to a trade fair
 be fingerprinted;  Tsingtao was
 then closed to Japanese shipping.
 The Japanese indicated willing-
 ness to reconsider the finger-
 print issue,  Tsingtao was re-
 opened, and Peiping expressed
 its willingness to discuss re-
 patriation of Japanese nationals
 and expanded trade.
 Policy Toward US
 In opening its "struggle"
 with the US,  Peiping apparently
 worked to prepare-a position
 from which it could exert both
 political and military pressure
 on the US without clashing with
 American military forces.   Com-
 munist China's demand on 30 June
 for resumption of the Sino-Amer-
 ican ambassadorial talks sus-
 pended last December was designed
 to appear as an "ultimatum" and
 to create the impression that
 Peiping was leading from strength.
 When Premier Chou En -lai stated
 on 6 September that Peiping "is
 ready" for talks,  the Chinese
 leaders were almost certainly
 convinced that as a result of

 the Chinese Communist leaders
 with a "safe" means of probing
 US intentions regarding the de-
 fense of the offshore islands.
 They obviously did not desire
 a "big" war and when Peiping
 concluded that the US would de-
 fend the islands,  the Chinese
 Communists began to modify their
 statements which had implied a
 direct military challenge to
 the US.   In contrast to the
 People's Daily warning of 9
 September g American convoy-
 ing would "result  in  armed'.
 clashes with China at any mo-
 ment," the present line carries
 no such threats;  instead  it
 maintains Communist China's will-
 ingness to negotiate "peaceful-
 ly" and  insists   that the US
 voluntarily recognize Peiping's
 12-mile limit.
 In his cease-fire order of
 6 October,  Defense Minister
 Peng Te-huai did not threaten
 to force the US out of the Tai-
 wan Strait area and stated in
 relatively mild language that
 if American forces do not with-
 draw quickly,  "they will always
 be on the defensive."  Subse-
 quent orders by Peng,  despite
 Peiping's improved military capa-
 bility in the strait    area, also
 failed to specify direct retali-
 ation against US naval vessels,
 should convoying be resumed.
 This line indicates that
 the Chinese Communist leaders
 are sensitive to the destruc-
 tiveness of American nuclear
 weapons.   Prior to and early
 in the Taiwan Strait crisis,
 the Chinese Communists tried
 to create the impression among
 Western governments--particular-
 ly the US--that China cannot be
 "pushed around" merely because
 it has no nuclear weapons.  Lat-
 er,  however,  Mao Tse-tung him-
 self moderated Peiping's chal-
 lenge to the US,  stating in
 late September that US atomic
 war threats have alienated more
 than 90 percent of the "people
 of the whole world."   According
 to the People's Daily on  30
 September, the peoples of the
 world must shoulder the task
 of "staying the hands of the
 US aggressors against China."
 The Chinese leaders, who
 are reported to have become ap-
 prehensive that the Nationalists
 might use US atomic weapons
 against the mainland, recognize
 that a nuclear attack on China
 would wreck Peiping's industrial-
 ization program.
 The Chinese Communist lead-
 ers are also aware that since
 they possess no effective deter-
 rent to prevent a nuclear at-
 tack on the mainland, success
 of their policy toward the US
 depends on Soviet support.   A
 I People's Daily editorial of
 late September stated:   "We know
 very well the destructive power
 of atomic weapons" and declared
 that any American nuclear at-
 tack on the mainland would re-
 suit in an attack on the US "by
 the same means."  The passage
 on retaliation was attributed
 by the editorial to Khrushchev's
 19 September letter to President
 Eisenhower,  suggesting that Com-
 munist China does not possess
 nuclear weapons of its own. Mao
 Tse-tung, Liu Shao-chi, and
 Chou En-lai have twice in the
 past month publicly underscored
 the  "powerful  support" Mos-
 cow has provided in the Taiwan
 Strait situation--support which
 has been "very effective" in
 "forcing the aggressors to think
 hard about their fate."
 Whether Khrushchev was at
 all reluctant to be a partner
 in Mao's plan for using artil-
 lery to probe US intentions re-
 garding the offshore islands is
 a conjectural matter.   In any
 case,  top Soviet military lead-
 ers, including Marshal Malinov-
 sky, are reported to have been
 conducting military discussions
 with Chinese military leaders
 in Peiping at least eight days
 prior to  Khrushchev's arrival
 there  on 31 July.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Policy Toward Yugoslavia
 Peiping's desire to "strug-
 gle" with Moscow's opponents
 as well as its own has made it
 a major protagonist of Khru-
 shchev's efforts to restore his
 control over and tighten dis-
 cipline in the Soviet bloc.  In
 their effort against the Yugo-
 slavs,  the Chinese have been
 moving with the USSR in avoid-
 ing a break while attacking Bel-
 grade's revisionism.   The tone
 of their attack, however,  had
 been sharper than that of any
 bloc party,  and the snub last
 June of the departing Yugoslav
 ambassador suggests that they
 do not feel the need for retain-
 ing the same degree of flexi-
 bility in relations with Bel-
 grade that Khrushchev continues
 to seek for Moscow.
 It is not clear at just
 what point in mid-1957 Mao de-
 cided that his own pronounce-
 ments on intrabloc relations
 should be brought into line with
 the harder position then being
 taken by Khrushchev.   In any
 case, by November 1957 Mao's
 attacks against revisionism were
 the sharpest of any made by bloc
 leaders and his statement that
 the Soviet Communist party,  as
 well as the Soviet state, must
 lead the bloc was unique among
 bloc leaders.
 The fact that Tito and Go-
 mulka.were questioning the hegem-
 ony                    of Moscow was reason enough
 for Mao to lend his prestige in
 enforcing it.   He was also anx-
 ious to put an end to misrepre-
 sentations of Chinese Communist
 statements by Yugoslavs and
 Poles, who tried to use Peiping
 as a counterweight to Soviet
 authority.
 The Chinese Communists'
 first important move against
 Belgrade was to send only an
 "observer" to the Yugoslav con-
 gress last April in line with
 the action of the USSR and most
 of the satellites;  Albania com-
 pletely boycotted the congress.
 Their second major move was a
 sharp attack against Yugoslav
 revisionism in the 5 May edi-
 torial of the People's Daily.
 Belgrade's 9 May KomunisT-_ae-
 fense of the party's program
 interpreted the Chinese attack
 as a revival of the 1948 reso-
 lution which expelled Yugoslavia
 from the Cominform.
 This apparently was not
 Peiping's intention.   The Chi-
 nese editorial took Khrushchev's
 line laid down at the July 1955
 plenum in Moscow that while the
 Cominform resolution was basi-
 cally correct,  the methods used
 in implementing it, and the
 1949 Cominform resolution, were
 incorrect.   Chinese Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi on 10 May took
 steps apparently designed to
 dispel the impression that Pei-
 ping's sharp condemnation of
 Belgrade was political warfare
 of the Cominform brand or that
 it would lead to a break in dip-
 lomatic relations between the
 two countries.   At the same
 time he reserved China's right
 to criticize Yugoslavia on ideo-
 logical issues.                                                                  A subsequent
 Chinese attack stated that crit-
 icism should be "political" as
 well as ideological and depicted
 Yugoslavia as sustained by US
 aid and following Washington's
 foreign policy.   A similar pic-
 ture had been outlined by Khru-
 shchev earlier in April in terms
 which were less primitive than
 those used by the Chinese.
 Policy Toward US Allies
 Peiping is varying its new
 hard-line approach toward gov-
 ernments which "persist in their
 unfriendly attitude toward Chi-
 na."                                                                     With some,  it has virtual-
 ly broken contacts; others it,
 deliberately harasses.
 Japan is a prime example
 of a nation with which Peiping
 has broken sharply.   Despite
 its tirade of personal abuse
 including charges   of   "war

 criminal" directed against Ja-
 pan's Premier Kishi following
 his speech on -nonrecognition
 of Communist China last January,
 Peiping maintained the hope that
 an exchange of trade missions
 could be carried out which would
 be tantamount to de facto recog-
 nition.   When Premier Kishi
 stated on 9 April that the Japa-
 nese Government could not guaran-
 tee the sanctity of the Chinese
 Communist flag should it be
 flown  over the prospective mis-
 sions' headquarters, however,
 Peiping responded with a bombast
 of hostility culminating in com-
 plete rupture of-all trade re-
 lations.
 The Chinese demand for a
 "wholesale" change of attitude
 on the part of Kishi is coupled
 with a demand for a formal "apol-
 ogy"--a position which has hard-
 ened even previously sympathetic
 Japanese businessmen against Com-
 munist China.   This approach has
 not influenced Moscow's rela-
 tions with Tokyo, and there is
 no evidence to suggest the Chi-
 nese Communists are pressing
 for a tougher Soviet line.
 The new look in relations
 with Western nations--partic-
 ularly with governments which
 have supported the US position
 on such issues as Taiwan and UN
 membership--has resulted in pro-
 grams of petty harassment.  Such
 a program is now being conducted
 against the Dutch Embassy in
 Peiping, where the Chinese staff
 went "on strike" in protest
 against the firing of two coolies.
 The Dutch, who have been told
 they are expected to "apologize"
 for this action,  are convinced
 that Peiping's sharp demand
 stems directly from Foreign Min-
 ister Lun's  public support of
 Secretary Dulles' statement ab-
 juring the use of force in the
 Taiwan Strait situation.
 The British,  too,  have had
 ample opportunity to become in-
 ured                    to periodic "unpleasant-
 ness" in Peiping.   Premier Chou
 En-lai had warned last February
 that "if Britain did not change
 its two-faced attitude toward
 China, Sino-British relations
 would inevitably be adversely
 affected."    Peiping's pique
 with London's "two Chinas" dec-
 larations has not, however, led
 to any major strain in Sino-
 British relations.
 Latin American and Middle
 Eastern countries--the "colo-
 nial, underdeveloped" areas--
 have been approached with mod-
 eration by Peiping, despite the
 Western orientation of some of
 these governments.   Peiping is
 clearly convinced nationalism
 and anticolonial._ sentiment
 can be exploited to advantage,
 and it apparently hopes that
 declining Chinese Nationalist
 prestige will facilitate the
 establishment of diplomatic re-
 lations.   However, Morocco's
 decision to establish formal
 relations with the Peiping re-
 gime, announced on 31 October,
 appears to have been facilitated
 primarily by Soviet efforts in
 Rabat.
 Policy Toward Neutrals
 "Peaceful coexistence" con-
 tinues to be the theme which
 underscores Peiping's relations
 with neutral Asian nations,
 which it hopes to make pro-Com-
 munist.   It is clear that Com-
 munist China has not jettisoned
 coexistence as a guide to for-
 eign relations with regimes
 which indicate some degree of
 sympathy for Peiping.
 The Chinese Communist lead-
 ers' policy of treating Cam-
 bodian Premier Sihanouk with
 considerable deference was re-
 warded on 22 July when Sihanouk
 agreed to establish diplomatic
 relations with Peiping.   Siha-
 nouk made his move despite
 strong fears among many influ-
 ential Cambodians that the step
 would intensify Communist sub-
 versive activity and jeopardize
 continuation of American aid.

 was made evident by Premier
 Chou En-lai when he repeatedly
 stressed China's peaceful in-
 tentions toward Cambodia at a
 time when the Communist shell-
 ing of Chinmen was just begin-
 ning.
 Peiping's relations with
 such countries as India  and
 Burma,  however,  have become
 cool.   The Chinese Communist
 position is primarily condi-
 tioned by the attitude of these
 countries toward international
 Communism and domestic Commu-
 nists;                    Nehru has become more
 critical and Ne Win is openly
 antagonistic.   The Chinese,  who
 have allowed border issues with
 both countries to drag on, re-
 cently administered a minor
 diplomatic snub to Nehru during
 his recent visit to Bhutan via
 a Tibetan route.   Continuing
 Indian and Burmese support on
 the Taiwan issue and on the So-
 viet bid for a UN seat for Com-
 munist China are factors which
 will prevent Peiping from adopt-
 ing an openly hostile attitude
 toward these governments.
 Prospects
 Peiping will probably try

 to alienate some of the sym-

 The first National Assembly

 under new regulations laid down
 by Premier de Gaulle,  who hopes
 to secure a clear nonextremist
 majority with which he can re-

 The new assembly,  like its pred-

 New Electoral System
 The proportional represen-

 three badly fragmented assem-

 has been replaced by the single-
 member district system charac-
 teristic of the Third Republic.
 A total of 546 seats, including
 71 for Algeria and the Sahara,
 will be filled in November.
 Those overseas territories which,
 under the new constitution,

 and non-Communist anti-Gaullist
 groups called the   Union  of
 Democratic Forces  (UDF).  On
 the right of center,  two par-
 ties have Virtually disappeared
 --the former Gaullist Social
 Republican Group (GRS) and
 Poujade's Union for French Fra-

 are two new rightist parties--
 the Soustelle-inspired pro-
 Gaullist Union for a New Re-
 public (UNR) and the  smaller
 Renovation and Fidelity group,
 which is apparently organized
 only in the Paris area.
 In general, elections con-
 ducted on the basis of a single-
 member constituency rather than
 on the list system emphasize
 local issues and personalities
 and tend to weaken party dis-
 cipline.  Thus, the changed elec-
 toral system reduces the local
 influence of the highly cen-
 tralized parties--the  Commu-
 nists,  Socialists,  and Popular
 Republicans--and favors the
 looser knit, more individualis-
 tic Radical Socialists and In-
 dependents.   Parties with large
 numbers of popular mayors and
 departmental councilors,   par-
 ticularly the Socialists and
 Independents, are expected to
 benefit.   Political strongholds,
 such as those of the Popular
 Republicans on the eastern and
 western frontiers of the coun-
 try and of the Radical Social-
 ists in the southwest, will
 probably survive.
 The new law is expected to
 reduce the number of deputies
 from the Communist party, which,
 under proportional representa-
 tion, won numerous seats in de-
 partments where it was strong
 but lacked a majority.   The as-
 sumption is that the non-Commu-
 nist parties will unite on the
 second ballot to block the elec-
 tion of a strong Communist con-
 tender,  even though the Commu-
 nist party retains much of its
 former popular support.   How-
 ever, while  many  Communist
 voters disobeyed party instruc-
 tions in the constitutional
 referendum, they may not do so
 in an election where the choice
 again involves traditional par-
 ties.
 De Gaulle's Position
 All the parties except the
 Communist and the  Union of
 Democratic Forces claim to be
 pro-Gaullist, but Premier de
 Gaulle himself has refused to
 let his name be drawn into the
 campaign or to allow any members
 of his cabinet who  are candi-
 dates to campaign outside their
 own districts.   These limita-
 tions particularly affect In-
 formation Minister                                                                  Jacques
 Soustelle, who had favored a
 system of voting by lists in
 large districts on a winner-
 take-all basis and who counted
 on sweeping the field with a
 Gaullist "National List"  of
 rightist candidates in each
 district.
 Since De Gaulle's acces-
 sion to power, a new interest
 in politics has appeared among
 many former nonvoters.   The
 heavy registration of new voters
 of all ages which preceded the
 September constitutional refer-
 endum is expected to carry over
 and produce a heavy turnout in
 the assembly elections.   Soustel-
 le's  Union for a New Republic
 and its allies expect to bene-
 fit from this phenomenon.
 Algeria and economic prob-
 lems are virtually the only is-
 sues on which party platforms
 differ to any degree.   In gen-
 eral, the parties to the left
 of center favor a negotiated
 political settlement in Algeria
 and emphasize the need for
 greater economic benefits for
 all French citizens.   The right-
 ist parties, on the other hand,
 call for reduced governmental
 intervention in economic affairs
 and repeat their demands for
 integration of Algeria with
 France.   De Gaulle apparently
 hopes to secure a parliament

 The significance'of these

 Techniques With the Communists
 Although the Communist
 parties in the UAR are illegal,
 President Nasir tolerates their
 existence.   His efforts are
 concentrated on limiting their
 strength and preventing them
 from establishing centers of
 power from which they could
 pose a serious threat.   Nasir's
 aim is to ensure the impotence
 of the Communist parties in
 Egypt and Syria while he uses
 his "alliances" with Communist
 countries for international
 advantages.
 To further his Arab "lib-
 eration" movement and extend
 his influence throughout the
 Arab world and Africa, Nasir
 accepts propaganda backing from
 the Communist parties and takes
 part in the activities of such
 organizations as the Afro-Asian
 Solidarity Committee and its
 subgroups,  in which bloc nation-
 als and individual local Com-
 munists play a major role.   He
 appears confident that he can
 use the local parties in this
 way without the risk of increas-
 ing their influence inside the
 UAR itself.
 While Nasir has resorted
 to police action against   the
 Communist party of Egypt sev-
 eral times in the past, he now
 seems to feel he can contain
 domestic Communism through ad-
 ministrative action.   However,
 he has removed Communists from
 leading positions in the gov-
 ernment of the Egyptian region.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 influential Khalid Bakdash; and
 it has shown a greater degree of
 unity and discipline.   Prior to
 the  formation        of the United
 Arab Republic last February,
 party members had considerable
 success in penetrating the of-
 ficer corps of the Syrian Army,
 some departments of the govern-
 ment, and a number of labor
 unions.
 Concern over the extent of
 Communist penetration was a ma-
 jor factor in the decision of
 the top Syrian leadership to
 seek union with Egypt on Nasir's
 terms; it may even have prompted
 Nasir to speed up his own plans
 for union.   After the establish-
 ment of the UAR, Colonel Abd
 al-Hamid Sarraj,  former chief
 of the Syrian security forces
 and one of the most competent
 and forceful Syrian Army offi-
 cers, was named minister of the
 interior for the Syrian region.
 He is doing an effective job in
 displacing known Communists from
 influential positions and in
 keeping track of the activities
 of party leaders.
 Bakdash, who was deputy
 in the former Syrian parliament,
 returned to Damascus on 5 Octo-
 ber after eight months in the So-
 viet bloc.   During his "voluntary
 exile," he reiterated his op-
 position to "antidemocr.^t:ic"
 measures taken by the UAR under
 the guise of Arab unity and to
 proposals to dissolve the Com-
 munist party.  His return, un-
 doubtedly sanctioned by Moscow,
 may spur new efforts to step up
 Communist activity in Syria.
 A Kurd, he has a strong follow-
 ing among Damascus' Kurdish
 minority, and his return may
 bring increased Communist ef-
 forts to woo Middle Eastern
 Kurds.   It is not yet clear what
 role he will play in the party,
 or if he will direct a line of
 all-out opposition to govern-
 mental policy.
 Egyptian Communist Party
 The Communist party in
 Egypt has an estimated member-
 ship of rougly  14,000. Its great-
 est success has been among stu-
 dents and intelligentsia.   Pro-
 portionately, it has had more
 members among minority groups
 in the population than among
 the Egyptians themselves. It
 has always been divided into
 factions, merging from time to
 time and then splitting off into
 new ones.   In late 1957 and
 early 1958, a series of mergers
 brought the party as close to
 organizational unity as it had
 been in years.   Ideologically
 it has remained a strange as-
 sortment of Stalin-type Marxists,
 Khrushchevities, Tito-ists,

 Mao-ists,  pan-Arab Communists,
 and Egyptians who give a mysti-
 cal twist of their own to the
 Marxist line.
 The Egyptian party is again
 rent with dissension. One wing
 of the party wants to take the
 safer_ course of continuing sup-
 port for most of Nasir's poli-
 cies; the other wants to break
 with united-front activity and
 launch a full-scale attack on
 his policies, focusing on eco-
 nomic and labor issues.   One
 wing has accused the other of
 stealing its main clandestine
 printing press; defections and
 expulsions from the party lead-
 ership are taking place.
 Communist party leaders in
 both regions of the UAR have
 been dismayed by Nasir's present
 program for control of the la-
 bor union movement.   They have
 had little  success with  the
 union movement since Nasir came
 to power in 1954, and they see
 an effective roadblock  being
 erected against their attempts
 to gain control of precisely
 those mass organizations which
 should be susceptible to their
 influence and particularly use-
 ful as a lever for gaining pow-
 er.
 Two recent measures taken
 by Nasir reduce even further
 the opportunities for Communist
 control of labor.   These apply
 to both the Egyptian and Syrian
 regions, although now they are
 being implemented only in Egypt.
 Enforcement in Syria presumably
 will wait until political prac-
 tices and institutions there
 are brought into closer  line
 with those in Egypt.
 The first measure--a law
 which  became effective on  3
 SECRET
 April 1958--requires that all
 candidates for trade union
 boards be members of the Na-
 tional Union--Nasir's "single
 party" and main instrument of
 political control--in which Com-
 munists are prohibited member-
 ship.   The law provides  the
 legal justification for Nasir's
 labor czar,  Major Tuaymah,  to
 screen nominations for leader-
 ship posts in the union move-
 ment and to disqualify those
 who do not "fulfill all the con-
 ditions required of candidates."
 Nasir's second recent meas-
 ure is a sweeping program for
 reorganization of the  labor
 movement under a new control
 apparatus which will reach down
 into the individual factories.
 It calls for the creation of
 labor committees and executive
 boards at the plant, district,
 area, and regional levels to
 supervise and control all union
 activity and to carry out the
 labor policies determined by
 the regime.   Ostensibly the
 leaders of these boards and
 committees will represent all
 factory workers who are members
 of the National Union.   Actual-
 ly, the leaders will be hand-
 picked or carefully screened
 by Tuaymah and other National
 Union executives.
 If Nasir's labor program
 is implemented in its present
 form,the UAR Government's con-
 trol of the union movement will
 be nearly as complete as is the
 Soviet Government's control
 over its unions.   In effect,
 Nasir is borrowing from the
 Soviet Union a tested mechanism
 to use not only against all
 tendencies toward independent
 action by the unions, but also--
 and especially--against expan-
 sion attempts of the local Com-
 munist parties themselves.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY'
 WESTERN EUROPEAN ATTITUDES TOWARD THE UNITED NATIONS
 There is genuine concern
 among Western European powers
 --particularly those with colo-
 nies--over the growing power of
 what they consider an irrespon-
 sible and politically immature
 voting majority in the UN Gen-
 eral Assembly.   Nevertheless,
 Western Europeans generally see
 the United Nations as a perma-
 nent feature of international
 life,, useful, among other things,
 for "educating" the lesser de-
 veloped countries to their in-
 ternational responsibilities.
 Most Western European members
 would like to see the UN eco-
 nomic assistance programs broad-
 ened, believing that multilat"
 eral aid through the UN best
 offsets direct Soviet aid.
 General Assembly's Power
 The gradual assumption by
 the General Assembly of juris-
 diction, at the expense of the
 Security Council, over issues
 involving international peace
 and security has created a di-
 lemma for the West, which is
 caught between the Soviet veto
 in the Security Council and the
 Asian-African majority in the
 General Assembly.  Because the
 United States originated the
 1950 "uniting for peace" reso-
 lution as a way around the
 USSR's abuse of the veto, some
 Western European countries tend
 to blame the US when their na-
 tional interests are affected
 by assembly consideration of
 such issues as Suez.  The 1950
 resolution,  which empowered
 the General Assembly to act on
 questions involving interna-
 tional peace and security when
 the Security Council is para-
 lyzed by the veto, was consid-
 ered illegal by the USSR when
 it was invoked on the Hungarian
 question, but the USSR acqui-
 esced in its use during the
 Suez and the recent Lebanese
 and Jordanian crises.
 Since  1950,   the  Asian-
 African bloc in the UN has in-
 creased from 28 percent of to-
 tal membership to 35 percent.
 Even combined with the nine
 votes of the Soviet bloc, the
 Asian-Africans do not possess
 a majority, but their votes
 alone are sufficient to pre-
 vent assembly action in the
 many cases requiring a two-
 thirds majority.
 In addition, the practice
 among Asian-African countries
 of abstaining en masse on cer-
 tain East-West issues, such as
 disarmament, seriously harms
 the West's public propaganda
 position by cutting down the
 number of affirmative votes..
 On 4 November, for example,
 the General Assembly approved
 the West's position on con-
 trolled nuclear-test suspen-
 sion with only 50 affirmative
 votes,  compared with last year's

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SINO-SOVIET BLOC ACTIVITIES IN GREECE
 1.   General Bloc Policy:
 The bloc is trying to induce a
 gradual drift in Greece toward
 closer economic ties with the
 Communist world and to reduceGreek
 bilateral and NATO ties with
 the West.   Moscow would like to
 see on the periphery of the bloc
 a "positive neutralist" Greek
 Government that is anti-Western,
 intensely nationalist,  and will-
 ing to entertain closer all-
 round relations with the bloc.
 2.   Local Communists and
 sympathizers recurrently warn
 of the dire consequences that
 could result from establishment
 of foreign rocket and missile
 bases on Greek territory.  Soviet
 leaders continue to support the
 1957 Rumanian proposal that
 Greece join with the southern
 satellites,  Turkey,  and Yugo-
 slavia in a heads-of-state con-
 ference pointing toward a re-
 gional nonaggression pact.   In
 May,  Khrushchev recommended the
 Rumanian plan,  which had been
 rejected by Greece,  and asserted
 that Greece "can and must take
 an important part in this noble
 cause."
 3.   Despite satellite pro-
 fessions of a desire for rap-
 prochement,  long-standing prob-
 lems continue to aggravate re-
 lations.   Bulgaria has adamant-
 ly refused to honor its war rep-
 arations debt to Greece,  which
 amounts to $45,000,000 at 1938
 exchange rates.   Recent Rumanian
 actions in expelling Greek na-
 tionals were not well received
 by the press in Athens.
 4.   The USSR plays the ma-
 jor role in bloc efforts to draw
 Greece into closer relations.
 Among the satellites,  Czechoslo-
 vakia has been most active in
 the economic field.   Bulgaria's
 effectiveness is hampered by
 the tremendous antipathy felt
 by the Greeks for the Bulgars.
 5.   Diplomatic Activity:
 Greece has diplomatic rerillons
 with the USSR, Bulgaria,  Rumania,
 Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, all
 of which maintain missions in
 Athens. The presence of an un-
 authorized but very active Bul-
 garian trade mission in Salonika
 aggravated the deteriorating
 Greek-Bulgarian relations during
 the last six months.   In August,
 Athens again rejected Czechoslo-
 vakia's request for a consulate
 in Salonika in order not to set
 a precedent that would open
 northern Greece to bloc repre-
 sentation.   A Greek Foreign Min-
 istry official stated in July
 that Greece was not now actively
 considering a resumption of re-
 lations with Albania.
 6.   Economic Activity:  Eco-
 nomic relations continue to be
 confined mainly to trade, but
 Soviet spokesmen have often
 hinted,  both openly and covert-
 ly, that aid would be forthcom-
 ing if Greece asked for it.
 7.   Greek trade with the
 bloc in the first four months
 of 1958 continued above the 1957
 level of $54,600,000.   Trade
 during the four months of 1958
 totaled $22,;400,000 as compared
 with $19,300,000 in the similar
 period last year.   Trade with
 the USSR,  Athens' major bloc
 trading partner,  accounted for
 40 percent of Greece's bloc
 trade in 1957, and a three-year
 Greek-Soviet trade agreement
 signed in July calls for annual
 increases.   Exchanges with the
 bloc amounted to only 7 percent
 of total Greek foreign trade in
 1957,  but the bloc supplied 17
 percent of Greek POL imports.
 8.   The increase in Greek
 trade with the bloc results pri-
 marily from Greece's need to
 find outlets for its agricultural

 commodity surpluses.   The USSR
 recently offered to barter crude
 oil for surplus tobacco in a
 spot exploitation designed to
 capitalize on an immediate Greek
 problem of selling large stocks
 of tobacco.
 9.   Prolonged Soviet civil
 air negotiations with Greece,
 an important step for any future
 expansion of bloc services to
 Egypt and the Near East,  area
 now dormant.   Rumania and Poland
 continue to fly into Athens on
 regular schedules tightly con-
 trolled by the Greek Government,
 which authorizes them only for
 periods of four to six weeks at
 a time.
 10.   Cultural and Propaganda
 Activities:   The USSR is in the
 fooref ron   of bloc cultural and
 propaganda efforts,  and the So-
 viet Embassy was a focal point
 for widespread dissemination of
 printed propaganda until a recent
 Greek law banned such activity.
 Bulgaria,  Czechoslovakia,  and
 Communist China all receive
 propaganda support within Greece
 from bilateral friendship and
 cultural societies.
 11.   The level of delegation
 exchanges between Greece and
 the bloc continued to rise in
 the first half of 1958 and to-
 taled 61 as compared to 30 dur-
 ing a similar period in 1957.
 In September the Soviet ambas-
 sador renewed Moscow's invita-
 tion to Greek Premier Karamanlis
 to visit the USSR.   Most dele-
 gation exchanges in 1958 have
 been cultural.   The first Greek
 delegation to. visit Communist
 China was a parliamentary group
 in September.
 12.   The bloc's weekly Greek-
 language broadcast output amounts
 to 65-70 hours per week--14 of
 which are from Soviet transmit-
 ters.   In March a quasi-clandes-
 tine program called the "Voice
 of Truth" began broadcastin
 25 minutes daily
 is strongly anti-Greek Gov-
 ernment and anti-American, and
 the transmitter is operated on
 behalf of the illegal Greek Com-
 munist party.
 13.   Subversive Activity:
 The Communist Party o    reece
 (KKE), which was declared illegal
 in 1947, has its headquarters
 in Bucharest,  Rumania.  Since
 1949, it has sponsored a legal
 front party, the United Demo-
 cratic Left  (EDA),  representing
 the extreme left in Greek poli-
 tics.   The KKE in Bucharest sup-  25X1
 ports the illegal Communist or-
 ganization working within Gree
 The EDA, how-
 ever,  has carefully kept itself
 apart from the KKE, which is
 popularly associated with bitter
 memories of the civil war.
 14.   In the May national
 elections,  the EDA, running for
 the first time since 1952 as a
 single party rather  than in a
 coalition, received 24.4 percent
 of the popular vote, thus gain-
 ing the second largest represen-
 tation in the Greek Parliament
 with 79 of the 300 deputies.
 This sharp increase over its
 previous polling of about 10
 percent of the vote in 1952 ap-
 parently included a large pro-
 test vote against the policies
 of the government and center
 parties.   EDA's strength is con-
 centrated in the large urban
 areas, particularly Athens,
 Piraeus, and Salonika, and in
 the tobacco-processing districts
 of Macedonia.
 15.   The EDA waged a moder-
 ate campaign in May and this,
 together with its advocacy of
 economic reforms, has given it
 a new respectability.   The EDA
 may now be able to create the
 fiction of a "popular front"
 by splitting parliamentary mem-
 bership into several "independ-
 ent" parties, a process which
 appears to have actually started
 in September with the formation
 of a "Democratic Union" and of

 an agricultural movement from
 among its deputies.
 16.   Greek Communists are
 attempting to secure legaliza-
 tion of the party and an am-
 nesty for party members.   In
 the longer run they want to cre-
 ate a strong nationwide party
 of workers, farmers, and middle-
 class elements.   Communist cam-
 paigns in the last year  have
 played heavily on latent Greek
 fears of involvement in a nu-
 clear war and have been largely
 devoted,  with some success,  to
 creating strong opposition to
 the establishment of American
 intermediate-range missile bases
 in Greece.   The Communists have
 been aided by the continuing
 Cyprus controversy, which tends
 to alienate Greece from Turkey
 and Britain and to a lesser de-
 gree from the United  States.
 They further appeal to the strong
 sense of  Greek nationalism by
 denouncing   extraterritorial
 rights granted to American serv-
 icemen and demanding abrogation
 of existing agreements granting
 base rights in Greece  to the
 United States.
 17.   Communist labor policy
 has been to capture non-Commu-
 nist unions from within rather
 than setting up parallel organi-
 zations.   The full potential of
 this policy has not been realized
 because of continued government
 security measures and the vig-
 orous anti-Communist opposition
 within the General Confederation
 of Greek Workers (GSEE),   The
 Communists have succeeded,  how-
 ever,  in gaining the collabora-
 tion of the secretary general
 of the GSEE in a series of crit-
 ical union elections.   In the
 13th GSEE congress in October,
 11 members of the newly elected
 30-man executive council  are
 known to be Communist collab-
 orators.
 18.   Greek Reaction to Com-
 munist Activities:                   Relations
 between   Greece-and the bloc, ex-
 cept for Bulgaria and Albania,
 are normally coal but correct,
 in line with the pro-Western
 orientation of the present gov-
 ernment.   Soviet support for
 Greece on the Cyprus issue, com-
 bined with Greecei' frustration at
 lack of support from its NATO
 allies, has led to a revival of
 Soviet prestige in Greece from
 the low point it reached at the
 end of the civil war in 1949.
 There has been a concomitant
 decline in Greek estimates of
 the danger:-from the Soviet bloc.
 The present government is will-
 ing to expand trade  with the
 USSR but is rejecting Soviet ef-
 forts to increase relations in
 other fields.   Since the May
 election,  the Karamanlis gov-
 ernment, alarmed at gains in
 the extreme left,'is also ac-
 tively engaged in a campaign to
 harass and restrict the activi-
 ties of EDA and is reviewing
 socio-economic measures to re-
 duce the attraction of EDA cam-
 paign promises in future elec-
 tions.
 19.   The Outlook:   The bloc
 will probably con inue to fol-
 low the main lines of its pres-
 ent policy toward Greece.   It
 is unlikely that the bloc will
 succeed in inducing Greece to
 adopt a "neutral, independent"
 foreign policy in the near fu-
 ture.  Greece's strong popular re-
 sentment on the Cyprus issue,
 however, and the resulting psy-
 chological disengagement with
 its allies, may cause a further
 gradual weakening of Greek ties
 with the West.   The present gov-
 ernment is expected to continue
 to work with the West in coun-
 tering Soviet bloc diplomatic,
 economic, and cultural initia-
 tives.  The Greek Government can
 be expected to continue its cam-
 paign of harassment against the
 EDA,
 20. Soviet trade with
 Greece may continue to expand.
 Bloc willingness to buy commodity
 surpluses of major Greek products
 could make important segments of
 the Greek economy largely de-
 pendent on Soviet decisions,  al-
 though it is unlikely that the
 over-all Greek economy will be-
 come substantially dependent
 on this trade.
