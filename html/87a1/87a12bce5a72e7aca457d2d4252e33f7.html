 SOVIET 40TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS    .    . .  .  . .  .  . . .  Page 1
 Khrushchev's three-hour opening speech has domi-
 nated the 40th anniversary celebrations in Moscow.                          He
 touched lightly on domestic political problems and
 spoke frequently of the principles of party unity and
 of the supremacy of the party in all spheres of Soviet
 life.     Referring briefly to recent conflicts in the
 party's top ranks, he asserted that the central com-
 mittee had upheld these principles in ousting the "an-
 tiparty" group in June and Zhukov in October.
 On the economic side, he reaffirmed the policies
 and programs announced last September and gave pre-
 liminary production figures for 1972 for certain key
 industrial items in support of his assertion that catch-
 ing up with the United States is an achievable goal.
 In foreign relations, Kbrushchev emphasized the impor-
 tance of an understanding between the United States
 and the USSR and called for a high-level East-West meet-
 ing.

 THE SECOND SOVIET EARTH SATELLITE  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page 3
 Sino-Soviet propagandists are hailing the launch-
 ing of the 1,120-pound second Soviet earth satellite
 to a maximum of 930 miles on 3 November as an "out-
 standing victory of Soviet science and vivid testi-
 mony to the gigantic success of the first Socialist
 state."  This follows the same pattern of propaganda
 exploitation used after the first launching.  The
 military applications of sputnik II have already been
 implied in Soviet bloc comment.  Free world reaction
 ranged from praise for the achievement to calls for
 a greater exchan a of scientific knowledge among the
 Western allies.

 PROBLEMS OF THE NEW FRENCH GOVERNMENT   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 France's new premier, 38-year-old Felix Gaillard,
 presides over a tenuous alliance which faces immediate
 decisions on the Algerian and other highly controver-
 sial problems.  Gaillard has reiterated Mollet's offer
 to the Algerian rebels for a cease-fire and negotia-
 tions.  Despite the large majority vote for his investi-
 ture, both major supporting parties--tbe Socialists and
 the Independents--remain at odds over economic policy
 and seem in agreement only on the need for a government.
 The serious divisions in both groups over participating
 in his government make doubtful their continued support.
 ALGERIAN REBELLION    .  .  .  .  .       .  .  .    .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page  2
 The Algerian rebel high command recently met in
 Tunis and reiterated its demand that France recognize
 Algeria's independence before cease-fire negotiations
 are held.  The rebels have substantially improved
 their military capabilities and may concentrate on
 isolated French positions, such as those protecting
 Saharan areas under oil development.
 COMMUNISTS TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON BERLIN SECTOR BORDER   .  .  .  Page  3
 The Communists have established new stringent
 customs and currency controls on the East-West Berlin
 border, but apparently do not contemplate closing this
 border entirely in the near future.  Although the new
 controls violate quadripartite agreements on freedom
 of movement within Berlin, they do not necessarily
 affect Allied access to East Berlin, as they appear
 to be directed primarily against Germans.

 REORGANIZATION                                                         Page  5
 For the three months following the 1 July 1957
 reorganization of Soviet industrial administration,
 production in the Russian republic, which accounts
 for roughly two thirds of the USSR's industrial out-
 put, was 12 percent above that for the same period
 a year  ago.  This  total  figure, which is somewhat
 higher than is implied in Khrushchev's anniversary
 speech, suggests that to date at least the results
 of the reorganization scheme have at the minimum
 offset any initial disruption of supply and person-
 nel.  Nevertheless, some modification of the new
 system may be made if 1957 performance figures re-
 veal specific weaknesses in its operation.

 President Tito's absence from the Moscow cele-
 bration of the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik
 revolution suggests that as a result of the ouster
 of Marshal Zhukov the Yugoslav leader is having
 second thoughts about his alignment with the USSR.
 Belgrade is unlikely to take any steps which would
 further its alignment with Moscow until the inten-

 ENLARGED SCOPE OF STATE FARMS IN SOVIET AGRICULTURE  . . .         Page  8
 The recent Soviet emphasis on state farms in agri-
 culture has resulted in the formation of 674 new state
 farms in the USSR in the first half of 1957.  This trend
 has been closely related to the development of the New
 Lands and, more recently, to increasing pasturage in
 the new areas to enhance the meat and milk production
 drive.

 DI VITTORIO'S DEATH WEAKENS ITALIAN COMMUNISTS' HOLD
 ON LABOR    . . . . .   . . . . . . .           . . . . .  . . . . . . .  Page  9
 The Italian Communist party leadership is faced
 with a difficult problem in finding a successor to
 Giuseppe Di Vittorio, who died on 3 November after a
 ten-year term as secretary general of the party-dom-
 inated Italian General Labor Confederation.                                 Likely
 successors would not have Di Vittorio's stature and
 popularity, and must be acceptable to the Communists,
 the Nenni Socialists, and the rank and file.  The Com-
 munists' hold on labor is threatened by weakening
 morale in the labor organization and an increasing
 divergence of interests between Communist and Nenni
 Socialist members.
 MACMILLAN GOVERNMENT FORCING SHOWDOWN ON WAGES ISSUE . . .  Page  10
 Industrial strife is probable in Britain this
 winter as a result of the trade unions' conflict
 with the Macmillan government over general wage in-
 creases.  The government insists that the pound
 sterling would be weakened by further wage increases
 unaccompanied by rises in productivity.  The show-
 down may come in mid-December, when the government
 is expected to reject the demands of 500,000 rail-
 way men to whom it has yielded in previous years.
 YEMENI CROWN PRINCE BADR'S VISIT TO LONDON . . . . . . . .  Page  11
 The ten-day official visit to London of Yemeni
 Crown Prince Badr, which begins on 9 November, may
 provide a start toward a limited settlement of the
 Aden-Yemen border dispute.  The Yemenis view the
 trip as strengthening the prospects of Badr to suc-
 ceed to the throne.  The British view the crown prince
 with suspicion because of his Soviet connections, but
 presumably hope his visit will facilitate future deal-
 ings with him should he succeed the present Imam.
 RETURN TO CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IMPERILED IN COLOMBIA   . . .  Page  11
 A factional struggle within the Conservative party
 in Colombia imperils the prospects of an orderly transi-
 tion of power from the military junta to civilian con-
 trol.  The repudiation by the right-wing Conservatives
 of the joint Conservative-Liberal presidential candidate
 may be seized by the military as a pretext to remain in
 control.

 THE SITUATION IN GUATEMALA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  .  Page 12
 Little if any progress is being made by the di-
 verse and antagonistic anti-Communist political groups
 in Guatemala toward agreeing on a coalition candidate
 for the presidential election, which will probably be
 set for January.   If the impasse continues and the
 government remains neutral as it has promised, the Com-
 munist-infiltrated Revolutionary party might win.  Gov-
 ernment support for any candidate would probably set
 off renewed violence.
 DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIAN ECONOMIC SITUATION  . . . . . . . .  Page 13
 The Indian government took action on 31 October
 to make available nearly all of its dwindling foreign
 exchange reserves to meet commitments under its Second
 Five-Year Plan, as widespread crop failures tightened
 the squeeze on its financial resources.  New Delhi ap-
 parently is counting heavily on American authorization
 of additional surplus food shipments to ease the new
 drain on its foreign exchange necessitated by emer-
 gency food imports.
 PHILIPPINE ELECTION CAMPAIGN . . . .  . . . .  . .  .  . .  . .  Page 14
 In the last week of intensive campaigning for the
 12 November Philippine election, President Garcia is
 still widely believed to have an edge over his op-
 ponents, although an upset by either Liberal party
 candidate Yulo or Progressive party candidate Manahan
 cannot be ruled out.  Despite local expectations of
 widespread electoral frauds, and numerous reports of
 terrorism, government agencies responsible for the
 conduct of the elections appear to be making an ef-
 fort to ensure free elections.
 INDONESIA                            .                   .
 The Indonesian government has postponed the second
 national conference from 15 to 25 November, apparently
 to give its "Regain West Irian Drive" more opportunity
 to stimulate national unity before the meeting opens.
 The second phase of this anti-Dutch  drive is to start
 on 10 November, and a third phase is set to coincide
 with the UN General Assembly debate on Indonesia's
 claim to the area later this month.  Antagonism be-
 tween Sukarno and Hatta may be intensifying, with Hatta
 reportedly prepared to take active leadership of anti-
 Communist elements against the President.                 F_         I

 Marshal Sarit is seeking to give the impression
 that he fully controls the situation in Thailand.
 Earlier reports that he was "losing his grip" may have
 been exaggerated by ambitious colleagues, such as In-

 Sarit as Thailand's de facto ruler.
 SITUATION IN LAOS  .  . . . . . .  . . . .  : .  . . . . . . .  Page 16
 The Laotian government and the Pathet Lao have
 concluded negotiations on the terms of a settlement,
 and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma plans shortly to
 request National Assembly approval for a coalition gov-
 ernment.   Influential conservative leaders are opposed
 to the manner in which Souvanna pushed through the set-
 tlement.   However, there is widespread sentiment for
 national reunification, and it is probable that Nation-
 al Assembly approval will be forthcoming.
 CHINESE TO PRESS FOR FURTHER SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION

 Mao Tse-tung's entourage in Moscow includes two
 scientific and technical delegations which will ne-
 gotiate a Sino-Soviet agreement for joint research
 and cooperation.   Soviet missile and earth-satellite
 development and nuclear advances are viewed by the
 Chinese as impressive examples of Soviet supremacy
 in science and undoubtedly have prompted the Chinese
 to press for agreements which would give them a
 larger share in the benefits of the Soviet successes.
 DROUGHT THREATENS WINTER CROPS IN COMMUNIST CHINA   . . . .  Page 18
 Drought lasting more than 100 days threatens the
 winter wheat and rape crops in most of North China,
 large areas of the central provinces, and some of
 South China.  Crop failures would aggravate serious
 problems already facing the regime in the countryside.

 During Chancellor Adenauer's third term, West Ger-
 many is likely to demonstrate an increasingly self-as-
 sertive role within the framework of the Western alliance.
 Unwilling to leave its fate in the hands of other major
 powers, Bonn will probably seek a gradual extension of
 its political influence to a point commensurate with its
 already important world economic position.   In the mili-
 tary field, Defense Minister Strauss is likely to con-
 centrate on equipping existing forces with modern weap-
 ons.; In foreign policy, an early effort toward improv-
 ing relations with the Eastern European satellites,
 principally Poland, seems likely, although Tito's re-
 cent recognition of East Germany may delay this step.

 The, new Pakistani government, while retaining the

 seems unlikely to pursue strong domestic. economic poli-

 result in serious deterioration of the country's economy.
 Growing economic instability and continuing political
 confusion may neutralize the effectiveness of American
 military aid and make Pakistan increasin ly dependent on
 foreign economic assistance.

 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 SOVIET 40TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS
 Khrushchev opened the 40th
 anniversary celebrations in Mos-
 cow on 6 November with a three-
 hour speech to a gathering of
 over 15,000 officials of the
 Communist world, including 61
 foreign delegations and deposed
 leaders Malenkov, Kaganovich,
 and Shepilov.   Khrushchev re-
 viewed in glowing colors 40
 years of Soviet achievement and
 made confident predictions for
 the future.   He touched lightly
 on domestic political problems,
 and spoke frequently--in general
 and conventional terms--of the
 principles of party unity and
 of the supremacy of the party
 in all spheres of Soviet life.
 Referring briefly to recent con-
 flicts in the party's top ranks,
 he asserted that the central
 committee had upheld these prin-
 ciples in ousting the "antiparty
 group" in June and Zhukov in
 October.
 In his first formal pro-
 nouncement on Stalin since the
 attack at the 20th party con-
 gress, Khrushchev struck the
 now-familiar pose of balancing
 Stalin's vices against his mer-
 its.  He asserted piously  that
 Communists had the strength to
 admit mistakes, but rejected at-
 tempts to attribute Stalin's
 mistakes to the Soviet system.
 Attacking the concept of "na-
 tional Communism," he damned
 Djilas and Nagy as revisionists
 whom the West described as "lib-
 eral Communists."  Although he
 condemned the two ideological
 extremes of "revisionism" and
 "dogmatism," Khrushchev avoided
 entirely any discussion of the
 problem of nonconformity in So-
 viet intellectual life.
 In the field of foreign re-
 lations, Khrushchev emphasized
 the importance of an understand-
 ing between the United States
 and the USSR and called for a
 "high-level meeting of repre-
 sentatives of capitalist and
 socialist countries to exclude
 war as a means of solving polit-
 ical questions," to end the
 arms race, and to establish re-
 lations between states on the
 basis of peaceful coexistence.
 Khrushchev sought to por-
 tray the Soviet Union as the
 champion of peace, in contrast
 to the West's alleged desire to
 "keep the world on the brink of
 war."  He declared that "wars
 are not needed for the victory
 of socialism" and that the USSR
 would never "use any means of
 destruction" except in retalia-
 tion against an attack by "im-
 perialist states."
 The confidence which marked
 Khrushchev's speech suggests
 that the Soviet leaders believe
 their technological achievements
 have given them a strong polit-
 ical initiative which will in-
 crease pressure on the West to
 make concessions, particularly
 in the disarmament field.  The
 Russians apparently believe
 they can, from their new "posi-
 tion of strength," isolate the
 United States and persuade Amer-
 ica's allies that their inter-
 ests dictate a more independent
 policy.
 Khrushchev cited the eco-
 nomic "victories" of the past
 40 years of Soviet rule and
 forecast Soviet production 15
 years from now for certain key

 industrial items.      His prelim-
 inary 1957 output figures were
 considerably less impressive
 then his image of the victorious
 past and they seem to have made
 him conservative in his vision
 of the promising future.   Only
 the most moderate overfulfill-
 ment of the modest 1957 plan
 for total industrial production
 seems implied by Khrushchev's
 figures.
 At the same time, the 1972

 growth rates considerably below

 trial growth and the increases

 defunct Sixth Five-Year Plan.
 tempt to "do everything at
 once"--though apparently at
 a somewhat less headlong pace.
 From the statements in his
 speech, it would appear that
 Khrushchev intends to continue
 to implement policies toward
 the satellites which are based
 on the decisions of the 20th
 party congress and which were
 reaffirmed in the declaration
 of 30 October 1956, i.e.,  "the
 countries of the great common-
 wealth of socialist nations can
 build their relations only on
 the principle of full equality,
 respect of territorial integ-
 rity, state independence and
 sovereignty, and noninterference
 25X1
 Khrushchev claimed,  however,
 that the USSR "can in the next
 15 years not only catch up
 with the present volume of out-
 put ...of the United States but
 also outstrip it."
 Besides the theme of
 "catching up" with the United
 States, Khrushchev also dwelt
 at varying length upon those
 other economic policies and
 programs of the regime which
 will go into the long-term plan
 announced as under preparation
 for the 1959-1965 period. His
 discussion of agriculture, hous-
 ing, sputnik, education, and de-
 fense suggests a continued at-
 in the domestic affairs of one
 another."   This is further in-
 dicated by the front-paging in
 Pravda on 5 November of a de-
 tailed restatement by Polish
 party leader Gomulka of his
 well-known "separate roads to
 socialism" doctrine.
 Khrushchev was followed to
 the rostrum during the ten-and-
 a-half hour session by a parade
 of Communist leaders,  headed
 by Mao Tse-tung.   Mao went out
 of his way to endorse Khru-
 shchev's major domestic poli-
 cies, which would have the ef-
 fect of strengthening the lat-
 ter's hand in any further party

 dications that Khrushchev has
 not completely eliminated his
 opposition within the party
 (see page 1, Part III).
 Mao described as "wise
 steps" Khrushchev's plans to
 decentralize management  of
 industry and construction, the
 agricultural development pro-
 gram, and actions taken against
 "antiparty groups" and toward
 "improvement of political in-
 doctrination in the army."
 Mao's support may make Khru-

 The launching of the sec-

 announced by Moscow radio on 3
 November after the satellite
 had completed at least one or-

 such a weight in orbit is read-
 ily adaptable to an ICBM or a
 reconnaissance vehicle.
 Soviet statements continue
 to imply that the Russians will
 launch several more such satel-
 lites during the coming year
 and that they intend to attempt
 a launching to the moon.
 Communist Exploitation
 Following the same pattern
 of propaganda exploitation used
 after the launching of the first
 earth satellite, Soviet prop-
 agandists again are concentrat-
 ing on hailing  the  second
 launching as "an outstanding
 victory of Soviet science and
 vivid testimony to the gigantic
 success of the first socialist
 state."
 Considerable attention is
 being given to foreign  reac-
 tions, particularly American.
 Pravda assessed US reaction to
 th-e-lunching of the second
 satellite as ranging from "sin-
 cere admiration to panic, hys-
 teria, and malicious rage."
 TASS reported "considerable
 confusion" among Washington
 political circles and quoted
 American press sources as say-
 ing the Soviet accomplishment
 leaves no doubt in Washington
 that the Russians are able to
 launch an ICBM'against'points
 in the United States.
 One Eastern European radio
 commentator told his domestic
 listeners on 4 November that
 just as the October Revolution
 opened "Chapter II  of  the
 world's history," so the sec-
 ond earth satellite began "Chap-
 ter III entitled 'Man is Begin-
 ning to Conquer the Cosmos'."
 The Bulgarian press commented
 that the two satellites have
 ended a "long and carefully
 nurtured" American delusion of
 technical and scientific suprem-
 acy, and said that nothing can
 dim the Soviet star.
 The Yugoslav radio, taking
 the humanitarian tack it fol-
 lowed a few weeks ago, commented,
 "If one side is able to do this
 today, the other side will be
 able to do the same thing to-
 morrow.  What sense does it make
 then to continue the race and
 the launching of new arms?"
 Peiping is symbolizing the
 second satellite as the "Red
 Moon" which "deals a heavy blow
 to the saber-rattlers."  The
 theme of "socialist superiority"
 and the "failure of Western
 capitalism" which was developed
 gradually in publicizing the
 first satellite is now foremost
 in every Chinese Communist com-
 muniqud.  While direct military
 implications are avoided in
 favor of scientific  claims,
 pointed references are made to
 new Soviet achievements in So-
 viet launching techniques.
 Non-Communist comment, less
 voluminous than that on the
 first earth satellite, general-
 ly follows the same line.  Sev-
 eral newspapers have said that
 the new satellite was launched
 to divert attention from the
 ouster of Marshal Zhukov.
 Western European press and
 official circles stressed the
 scientific achievement, and the

 need for greater coordination
 of Western scientific programs.
 Bonn government supporters said
 that the December NATO meeting
 must come up with a tangible
 program.   The second launching
 set off speculation in "in-
 formed quarters" in Bonn that
 West German participation in
 rocket development, now pro-
 hibited by the Paris treaties,
 was necessary in catching up
 with the USSR,  and the question
 was raised of a possible Euro-
 pean rocket production pool
 and of rocket production by Ger-
 many itself or with the United
 States and France.
 The European press gener-
 ally expressed alarm over the
 lead assumed by the USSR over
 the West, said by the British
 press to be two years.
 The launching has received
 a big play in the Middle East
 press as an additional demon-
 stration of Soviet scientific
 superiority, a further loss for
 American prestige, and another
 reason for spreading neutralism
 throughout Asia and Africa.
 Both the leading English
 daily Times of Tndia and the
 nationalist Tndian Express ex-
 pressed confidence inntthe United
 States' ability shortly to pro-
 duce its own sputnik and the
 Times added that there is there-
 o-no question of the USSR
 bargaining from the position of
 comparative advantage.   Both
 papers see this Soviet achieve-
 ment as carrying the promise of
 a new and better future, and
 the Times adds that the realiza-
 tion of the promise will depend
 on the measure in which the two
 power blocs are prepared to co-
 operate.
 Political and press circles
 in Ceylon saw the launching of
 the second satellite as prob-
 ably science's most notable
 achievement.   It was generally
 agreed that a satellite race
 between East and West could
 become as bitterly contested
 as arms races and might finally
 be settled only by war.
 Japan seems impressed with
 the size of the new earth satel-
 lite.   Kyodo News Agency noted
 that it "might well be" imagined
 that the USSR already possesses
 transcontinental ballistic
 rockets that could deliver
 hydrogen bombs to any part of
 the world.
 Prime Minister Kishi on
 6 November asked Ambassador
 MacArthur  when the United States
 would launch its earth satel-
 lite.  He said that not only
 were the Socialists using the
 Soviet success to criticize
 his government's security and
 foreign policy, particularly.
 as it related to close coopera-
 tion with the United States,
 but that some of his own Lib-
 eral Democrats were concerned
 as well.   When informed by
 MacArthur that  an American
 pilot  satellite  would be
 launched in  December and a
 more  instrumented IGY satel-
 lite in March 1958,   Kishi
 commented,   "From our  point
 of view,   the  sooner,   the
 better."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 November 1957
 Turkey and Syria
 International concern over
 Turkish-Syrian tensions has
 diminished markedly following
 the close of the UN debate on
 the problem last week, but the
 Syrian regime has continued its
 propaganda barrage charging
 Turkey with overflights and
 asserting the Turks have not
 made any move to ease the bor-
 der situation between the two
 countries.   Even more than pre-
 viously,  this Syrian activity
 appears to be inspired by do-
 mestic political considerations,
 especially the regime's need to
 maintain an atmosphere of crisis
 in order to hold itself to-
 gether and prevent any rally
 of potential opposition.
 The Turkish maneuvers
 originally scheduled for 30
 October have been delayed, at
 least until 15 November
 Reports
 that Turkish group   orces have
 withdrawn from the border area
 have not been confirmed.       The
 Turks recently prohibited the
 American air attache from en-
 tering an area about 65 miles
 from the frontier where they
 have a major air base.   The rig-
 orous restrictions the Turks
 have placed on the movement of
 foreign, including American,
 newspapermen who have sought
 to report on conditions in the
 border area may well give An-
 kara a bad press which will hin-
 der efforts to counter Soviet
 and Syrian propaganda.
 culties are likely to loom
 larger than they have for the
 past several months.   The un-
 interrupted development of
 closer military and economic
 relations between Syria and
 the Soviet Union, plus the ap-
 parent Syrian responsiveness
 to Soviet diplomacy during the
 UN debates,  is leading Tel Aviv
 to step up its own diplomatic
 efforts.   The Israelis have in-
 dicated they intend  to make
 a new request  to  the United
 States  for heavy  weapons,
 probably   the latest jet fighters
 and possibly  some submarines.
 Israel is  already scheduled
 to  receive  antisubmarine war-
 fare equipment   from Britain.
 These moves suggest that
 the Israelis anticipate a new
 build-up in tensions with the
 Arabs in general and Syria in
 particular during the coming
 months.   Local frictions,   any
 of  which  could  easily  devel-
 op                                                          into major problems,  re-
 main                                                      on all        of Israel's
 frontiers,   but particularly
 at present   on  the borders
 with  Syria  and  with Jordan,
 where  the   problem  of the
 Jerusalem neutral area  and
 Israeli tree-planting   and
 digging continue  to  fester.

 It is not clear whether
 the flare-up last week end in
 the propaganda war between
 Cairo and Amman is related to
 a possible move by the "free
 officers" group.   Cairo charged
 that King Hussayn's government
 had been negotiating with Is-
 rael,  "selling out" the Arab
 refugees for $30,000,000 of
 American aid, and implied that
 Hussayn should share the fate
 of King Abdullah, who was as-
 sassinated in 1951 by anti-
 Israeli fanatics.   Amman re-
 plied with a venomous personal
 assault on the "little colonel
 of low birth and lower manners."
 The Egyptian leaders are
 very probably considerably re-
 lieved to see the Syrian-Turkish
 question calming down.   Egyp-
 tian Foreign Minister Fawzi
 played a major role in leading
 the Syrians to accept an incon-
 clusive finale to the UN dis-
 cussions.   The easing of the
 international situation  ap-
 parently has given Nasir an op-
 portunity finally to do some-
 thing about cabinet changes
 which have been rumored for the
 past several months.
 Three shifts were an-
 nounced on 3 November, but the
 nature of the changes is not
 indicative of a major reshuf-
 fle.   Nasir for some time has
 been dissatisfied with some of
 his ministers,  particularly with
 the unpopular reception some
 of them received during the
 parliamentary elections last
 July.   The director of Libera-
 tion Province,                                                              accused of in-
 efficiency and corruption,  is
 to be thrown as a sop to the
 public, to give the tame Egyp-
 tian parliament an opportunity
 to stage an "investigation."
 The Nasir regime also an-
 nounced this week the consti-
 tution of the "National Union,"
 the latest attempt to provide
 some link between the regime
 and the public.   The new Na-
 tional Union has little more
 chance than its predecessor,
 the Liberation Rally, of be-
 coming more than  a convenient
 device  for organizing  parades
 and other political demonstra-
 tions.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 France's new premier, 38-
 year-old Felix Gaillard, pre-
 sides over a tenuous alliance
 which faces immediate decisions
 on the Algerian and other high-
 ly controversial problems.   De-
 spite his investiture vote of
 337 to 173, both major support-
 ing parties--the Socialists and
 the Independents--remain at
 odds over his economic policy
 and seem in agreement only on
 the need for a government.  The
 serious divisions in both groups
 over participating in his gov-
 ernment make doubtful their
 continued support.
 Gaillard's cabinet is one
 of the smallest in recent years,
 but it includes a wider range
 of political views than any
 government since the 1951 elec-
 tions.                    Despite its breadth,
 however, there is no sign of
 planned coordination among par-
 ty leaders.   The Socialists have
 some assurance of continuity
 on party policy, since such key
 posts as the Foreign Ministry
 under Pineau and the Ministry
 for Algeria under Lacoste are
 in the same hands as they were
 under Mollet and Bourges-Maunou-
 ry.   Popular Republican desires
 to regain control of the For-
 eign Ministry have been partial-
 ly met by the appointment of
 one of their leaders, Pierre
 Pflimlin, as finance minister.
 Gaillard has avoided a com-
 mitment on Socialist-backed so-
 cial welfare legislation, how-
 ever, by a plan to refer it to
 round-table conferences.  The
 Independents, who are repre-
 sented in the cabinet by com-
 parative unknowns, seem less
 firmly committed to Gaillard
 and are already threatening
 difficulties if the Socialists
 refuse to yield on this issue.
 Gaillard has tried to head off
 any early internal dissension
 by threatening to resign if any
 party bolts the coalition.
 Gaillard has put Algeria
 at the top of his legislative
 program and will probably get
 early assembly approval of an
 amended basic statute.   He has
 reiterated Mollet's offer of a
 cease-fire and negotiations,
 but he has also indicated a
 willingness to make further con-
 cessions to the right, thus prob-
 ably  increasing the restiveness

 of the Socialist rank and file,
 who want a more liberal Alge-
 rian policy.                         Antiregime senti-
 ment in the army in Algeria,
 meanwhile, is said to have in-
 creased during the prolonged
 government  crisis,   and  the
 French press in Algiers is wag-
 ing a violent campaign against
 the basic statute.
 Further clashes over basic
 policies are in prospect when
 the cabinet takes up the prob-
 lems  of internal inflation and
 the exhaustion of the financial
 resources required for govern-
 ment operations and for foreign
 trade.  Gaillard is anxious to
 have France make an effort to
 put its financial affairs in
 shape by drastic economies and
 new taxes before he asks for
 foreign aid, but the American
 embassy in Paris sees "precious
 little" recognition by French
 leaders, the mass of deputies,
 and public opinion of the need
 for belt-tightening.   There are
 already signs that labor will
 lose no time in renewing strike
 activity for new wage hikes.
 F__           I
 While military developments
 in Algeria do not bear out the
 contention of some rebel spokes-
 men that a new offensive has
 been launched, the Algerian re-
 bellion--which entered its fourth
 year on 1 November--gives no
 indication of subsiding.   The
 rebels in fact are believed to
 have substantially improved their
 military capabilities during the
 past few months.   At the same
 time they have concentrated on
 enlisting support abroad pre-
 paratory to the forthcoming
 United Nations debate on the Al-
 gerian question.
 Divergences of opinion
 within the nine-man executive
 committee of the Algerian Na-
 tional Liberation Front (FLN)--
 believed to be the rebel high
 command--seem to have been elim-
 inated at a five-day strategy
 conference held from 25 to 30
 October in Tunis.   The committee
 reiterated its demand that
 France recognize Algeria's in-
 dependence before cease-fire
 negotiations are held, in effect
 repudiating the more moderate
 position of the FLN's representa-
 tive at the United Nations in
 September.

 attempt to solve the Algerian
 dilemma,  rebuked the FLN for
 its negative stand.   He has
 sent an emissary to Morocco in

 SOVIET INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT CONTINUES HIGH FOLLOWING REORGANIZATION
 For the three months fol-
 lowing the 1 July 1957 reor-
 ganization of Soviet industrial
 administration, output in the
 Russian republic (RSFSR) was
 12 percent above that for the
 same period a year ago, accord-
 ing to N. Baibakov, chief plan-
 ner and first deputy premier
 of the RSFSR.  Linking the new
 regional administration to this
 increase, Baibakov implies that
 the new form of administration
 has been markedly successful.
 The Russian republic is
 the largest in the USSR and ac-
 counts for roughly two thirds
 of Soviet industrial output.
 In 1955, the RSFSR accounted
 for the following percentages
 of total USSR output:   steel,
 59 percent; oil,  70 percent;
 automobiles, 92 percent; cotton
 cloth, 89 percent; cement, 65
 percent; and coal, 58 percent..
 For the first half of 1957
 industrial output in the RSFSR
 reportedly increased 9 percent
 over the comparable 1956 period.
 For the year 1956, the report-
 ed increase over 1955 was al-
 most 10 percent.  If, in the  new
 control measures will act as
 a deterrent to currency and
 goods smuggling.   The controls
 have led to widespread dissatis-
 faction and increased tension.
 In some instances,  strikes and
 passive resistance have been
 threatened if there is not some
 relaxation.   The present prac-
 tices will probably be contin-
 ued, however, as the East Ger-
 man regime seems determined to
 minimize the currency leakage
 to the West and to assert its
 authority.
 conditions resulting from the

 figure for the third-quarter
 increase is comparable to that

 for 1956, it would suggest con-
 siderable success  -for  Khru-

 at least offsetting the initial

 Some modification of the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 YUGOSLAV REACTION TO ZHUKOV DISMISSAL
 President Tito's absence
 from the Moscow celebration of
 the 40th anniversary of the
 Bolshevik revolution suggests
 that, as a result of the ouster
 of Marshal Zhukov, the Yugoslav
 leader is having second thoughts
 about his alignment with the
 USSR.   Although Belgrade prob-
 ably will not for the present
 significantly alter any of its
 policies which generally paral-
 el those of Moscow,  the Yugo-
 slavs appear genuinely disturbed
 over the possible ramifications
 of Zhukov's removal and are un-
 likely to take any steps which
 would further their alignment
 with Moscow until the inten-
 tions of the new Soviet leader-
 ship are clarified.
 On 29 October Belgrade an-
 nounced that a sudden attack
 of lumbago would prevent Tito
 from traveling abroad for the
 next few months.   The American
 embassy reports, however, that
 high Yugoslav officials at a
 Turkish embassy reception on
 29 October made no attempt to
 maintain the position that Ti-
 'to's illness was anything but
 political.   This is further
 borne out by Tito's refusal to
 grant an audience to the Soviet
 ambassador on the latter's re-
 turn from Moscow on 1 November.
 Neither Belgrade's   announce-
 ment of Tito's "illness" nor
 the curt Soviet acknowledgment
 three days later was accompanied
 by any statements of regret
 concerning his absence from the
 Moscow celebrations.
 Tito apparently had con-
 siderable personal confidence
 in Zhukov and regarded him as
 a stabilizing influence in the
 Soviet hierarchy.   High Yugo-
 slav officials had   indicated
 previously their antipathy to
 "one-man rule" in the USSR and
 their support for the Khru-
 shchev-Zhukov "team."  On 1
 November Jose Vilfan, a confi-
 dant of Tito's, told the Ameri-
 can chargd in Belgrade that
 there had been no prior indica-
 tions that Khrushchev intended
 to upset the balance of power
 within the Kremlin.   Vilfan in-
 timated further that a "reap-
 praisal of the Yugoslav analy-
 sis" of Yugoslav policy toward
 the USSR is now required.  The
 fact that the Soviet leadership
 was maneuvering to unseat Zhukov
 while the latter was allegedly
 representing the USSR on a good-
 will visit to Yugoslavia has
 undoubtedly contributed to Ti-
 to's irritation.
 Zhukov were disgraced, it worrr-
 uld
 be evidence of a very serious
 situation.   Press reports from
 Belgrade state that the prev-
 alent view within the Yugoslav
 Foreign Ministry--despite Vil-
 fan's implication of a Khru-
 shchev-Zhukov fight--is that
 Khrushchev, because of his pre-
 carious hold on the Soviet cen-
 tral committee, was forced to
 cooperate with the so-called
 Stalinists who initiated Zhukov's
 removal.
 This explanation is of
 course consistent with the view
 long held in Belgrade that the
 Khrushchev-Zhukov "team" faced
 serious opposition in the party
 and required all possible sup-
 port for its policies if the
 opposition were to be overcome.
 The Yugoslav radio announced
 on 2 November that Soviet party
 secretary Mikhail Suslov--a
 Stalinist in Yugoslav eyes--de-
 livered the final report before
 the Soviet central committee
 on Zhukov's ouster.

 RUMANIAN OVERTURES TO THE WEST
 In an effort to enhance
 the appearance of Rumanian in-
 dependence of the Kremlin and
 to bolster foreign trade, the
 Bucharest government is making
 another serious effort to im-
 prove relations with Western
 countries and to re-create the
 relatively favorable diplomatic
 climate which existed prior to
 the Hungarian revolt.
 It has reopened negotia-
 tions with Bonn to facilitate
 the repatriation of Germans in
 Rumania, liberalized the grant-
 ing of exit visas to Israel,
 eased tourist and emigration
 controls generally, permitted
 the French to open a library
 in Bucharest, promised to lift
 the ban on American visitors,
 and agreed to sponsor a tour
 of the USIA's architectural
 exhibit "Made in USA."  Final-
 ly, a Foreign Ministry spokes-
 man intimated during a state
 banquet for Senator Ellender
 on 2 November that US Minis-
 ter Thayer's long-blocked re-
 quest for a public reading room
 and permission to distribute
 an American magazine would re-
 ceive the favorable treatment
 accorded similar French  re-
 quests.
 Presumably, these initia-
 tives were made after consulta-
 tion with Moscow.   When Foreign
 Minister Ion Maurer returned
 to Bucharest from his meeting
 with the Yugoslavs,  he summoned
 many of his ambassadors home
 for consultation before flying
 to the United Nations.   In New
 York he  unsuccessfully  at-
 tempted to secure a seat for
 Rumania on the Political Af-
 fairs Committee of the General
 Assembly.
 In keeping with their idea
 that such diplomatic moves en-
 hance their prestige,  the Ru-
 manians are seeking to play
 down their subservience to the
 Kremlin.  When Senator Ellender
 and Minister Thayer met with
 top government officials last
 week, politburo member Emil
 Bodnaras complained that Ameri-
 can officials refer publicly
 to Rumania as a "satellite"
 and "captive nation."  Minister
 Thayer noted the obvious ap-
 probation with which Premier
 Stoics and politburo member
 Mogioros, who were also present,
 accorded Bodnaras' rather emo-
 tional outburst.
 The Rumanians can be ex-
 pected to capitalize on the
 propaganda benefits which may
 accrue from a relaxation of
 emigration and tourist controls
 and to attempt to convince the
 free world of their sovereignty
 and independence.   Domestically,
 they may hope that closer con-
 tact with Western countries will
 persuade the  Rumanian people
 that their government   is ac-
 cepted on equal footing by the
 rest of the world.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY 'SUMMARY
 ENLARGED SCOPE OF STATE FARMS IN SOVIET AGRICULTURE
 The recent Soviet emphasis
 on state farms in agriculture
 has resulted in the formation
 of 674 new state farms in the
 USSR in the first half of 1957.
 State farms have been increas-
 ing in importance since the in-
 itiation of the "New Lands" pro-
 gram in 1954, and now account
 for more than a quarter of the
 total sown area, as compared
 with approximately 12 percent
 in 1953.   Conversely, the role
 of collective farms, still the
 largest and most important sec-
 tor of agriculture, has been
 somewhat de-emphasized.

 Although state farms are
 proclaimed by Soviet leaders to
 be the highest form of organiza-
 tion in socialist agriculture,
 the current emphasis on the role
 of state farms does not appear
 to be based primarily on ideo-
 logical grounds.   Instead the
 trend is apparently explained
 largely in terms of the present
 programs in Soviet agriculture.
 Most of the state farms organ-
 ized during 1957 were in the
 remote steppe areas of Kazakh-
 stan and the Volga areas where
 the vast natural pasture lands
 could be exploited as part of
 the widely publicized program
 for increasing meat and milk
 output.  This appears to be an
 extension of the policy of rely-
 ing heavily on state farms for
 the development of virgin lands.
 In these areas, as well as
 in more highly developed regions,
 state farms were also formed to
 supplant existing farming units
 which had proved uneconomical,
 including "backward" collective
 farms with excessive land re-
 sources, and small farms under
 the jurisdiction of various in-
 dustrial ministries.
 Other state farms were es-
 tablished to implement the Sixth
 Five-Year Plan directive to
 create specialized dairy and
 vegetable state farms for urban
 supply, for developing the Golod-
 naya Steppe and other irrigation
 schemes in central Asia, and
 for increasing production of
 citrus, tea, and other specialty
 crops.
 Although the establishment
 of 674 state farms in a six-
 month period is without parallel
 in Soviet agriculture, the re-
 sulting institutional structure
 should not be viewed as fixed.
 Soviet agriculture has   been
 modified repeatedly in the past,
 and experimentation will con-
 tinue.  From 1951 through 1956,
 1,053 new state farms were
 formed, including the 425 grain
 farms organized in the "New
 Lands," but during the same
 period, 942 state farms were
 liquidated.  Changes over the
 next few years may result in a
 similar pattern.  In any event

 DI VITTORIO'S DEATH WEAKENS ITALIAN COMMUNISTS' HOLD ON LABOR
 The Italian Communist par-
 ty leadership is faced with a
 difficult problem in finding a
 successor to Giuseppe Di Vit-
 torio, who died on 3 November
 after a ten-year term as sec-
 retary general of the Italian
 General Labor Confederation
 (CGIL).   Likely successors
 would not have Di Vittorio's
 stature and popularity and must
 be acceptable to the Communists,
 the Nenni Socialists, and the
 rank and file.  The Communists'
 hold on labor is threatened by
 weakening morale in the labor
 organization and an increasing
 divergence of interests between
 Communist and Nenni Socialist
 members.
 The CGIL's decline since
 1952 has been evident in a con-
 tinuing drop in membership and
 its falling strength in shop
 steward elections.   It is now
 believed to have about 3,000,-
 000 members, compared with 4,-
 000,000 in 1952, and this year,
 for the first time, it has won
 less than 50 percent of the shop
 stewardships decided thus far.
 A major factor in this decline
 has been the subordination of
 CGIL policies to the Communist
 party's political ends.
 Di Vittorio had made some
 efforts to resist this exploita-
 tion, and in August 1956 said
 the CGIL should become independ-
 ent of all political parties.
 His reputation as an unorthodox
 Communist may have been one
 reason for talk at the 1956
 CGIL congress about creating a
 new position of "president" for
 him, but his strong personal
 influence over the organization
 and the lack of a suitable suc-
 cessor as secretary general en-
 abled him to remain in his posi-
 tion.
 From the Communist point
 of view, this is not a propi-
 tious time to pick a successor.
 The CGIL rank and file is un-
 enthusiastic about the candidate
 the Communists had favored in
 1956, CGIL Secretary and Commu-
 nist Deputy Secondo Pessi.   A
 Nenni Socialist such as CGIL
 Secretary Fernando Santi would
 probably seem undependable to
 the Communists.
 A likely compromise candi-.
 date is Communist Senator Renaldo
 Bitossi, who is also a CGIL sec-
 retary and has a reasonably
 strong following but is less
 trusted than Pessi by the party
 leadership.   Another likely
 candidate is Communist Deputy
 Agostino Novella, a former CGIL
 secretary.  Oreste Lizzadri,
 the fourth CGIL secretary, is a
 Nenni Socialist considered to
 have close ties with the Commu-
 nists, but his tendency to put
 his personal interests first is
 likely to make him unacceptable
 to the Communist party leader-
 ship.
 In any case, it will prob-
 ably become increasingly diffi-
 cult for the Communists to allow
 the CGIL to bridge the gap be-
 tween them and the Nenni Social-
 ists, as occurred in July 1957
 when the CGIL took a position
 half way between the :two parties
 SECRET
 ported, and Soviet officials
 have denied there is to be a
 big switch to state farms. C

 MACMILLAN GOVERNMENT FORCING SHOWDOWN ON WAGES ISSUE
 Industrial strife is prob-
 able in Britain this winter as
 a result of the trade unions'
 conflict with the Macmillan
 government over general wage in-
 creases.   The government insists
 that the pound sterling would
 be weakened by further increases
 unaccompanied by rises in pro-
 ductivity.  On 1 November the
 government rejected an independ-
 ent tribunal's recommendation
 of a 3-percent pay raise for
 workers in the National Health
 Service.
 Wage demands have already
 been submitted by over half of
 Britain's 9,000,000 trade union
 members.   The decisive test may
 come in mid-December when the
 government is expected to reject
 the demands of some 500,000
 railway men.  Action on these
 demands usually sets the pattern
 throughout British industry, and
 the railway men have forced pre-
 vious Conservative governments
 to yield by going on strike.
 The government seems ready
 for drastic measures.   In the
 past year prices have risen
 about 4 percent, 1 percent more
 than the previous year.   Govern-
 ment spokesmen maintain that,
 despite any temporary gain in
 Britain',s gold and dollar re-
 serve position resulting from
 the increased bank rate and
 other credit restrictions, the
 drain on reserves will continue
 unless inflation is checked.
 Trade unionists show no
 signs of accepting the govern-
 ment's argument on wages.   They
 are fully backed by the Labor
 party,  which has charged the
 government with penalizing work-
 ers for the results of a defec-
 tive fiscal policy.   Some inde-
 pendent newspapers have made sim-
 ilar charges.   Labor leaders
 probably hope to increase their
 normal trade union support with
 some of the 3,000,000 unionist
 votes that usually go to the
 Conservatives.
 Chancellor of the Exchequer
 Thorneycroft indicated to the
 American ambassador on 3 Novem-
 ber that the government is ready
 to accept this political risk,
 believing that it has consider-
 able popular support on the wage
 issue.   Under the present condi-
 tions of growing inflation, how-
 ever, the Conservatives are
 steadily losing their grip on
 the electorate, as shown by
 their loss of an average 7 per-
 cent of the vote in the 13 by-
 elections held since Macmillan
 took office in January.   They
 evidently feel that success in
 halting inflation would change
 the political outlook by the
 time a general election must be
 called--May 1960 at the latest.

 their own demand for extensive
 preliminary substantive talks
 which they hoped Badr would
 formally conclude in London.
 The Imam appears to believe
 that the trip will greatly en-
 hance the prestige of the crown
 prince, whose right to succes-
 sion is opposed by many tribes
 supporting the Imam's brother,
 Prince Hassan.   Badr's trip to
 London is probably also intended
 to offset his trip to the So-
 viet Union and Eastern Europe
 in the summer of 1956, and thus
 make him less suspect in the
 West.
 At most,  the Yemenis hope
 for an agreement on establish-
 ing a joint border patrol or
 machinery for joint investiga-
 tion of incidents.  There ap-
 pears to be good reason to be-
 lieve, however, that the Imam
 might maneuver his way out of
 any commitments, as the pro-
 Western Yemeni ambassador-des-
 ignate to Moscow charges.
 The British government ap-
 pears to share such misgivings.
 It hopes the talks may help to
 do something toward reducing
 the difficulties to be expected
 from Yemen as a recipient of
 Soviet equipment and Egyptian
 counsel, but it is apparently
 not inviting any of the native
 rulers of the Aden Protectorate
 to London now, as it had indi-
 cated it would do if serious
 negotiations were in prospect.
 The British  want to do
 nothing to contribute to the
 prestige of Badr, whom they
 view with suspicion, partly be-
 cause of his key role in ar-
 ranging the supply of Soviet
 arms.   They presumably hope,
 however,  that his visit will
 facilitate future dealings with
 him should he succeed the pres-
 ent Imam.
 RETURN TO CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IMPERILED IN COLOMBIA
 A factional struggle with-
 in the Conservative party in
 Colombia imperils the prospects
 of an orderly transition of
 power from the military junta
 to civilian control.   The re-
 pudiation by the right-wing
 Conservatives of the joint Con-
 servative-Liberal presidential
 candidate may be seized by the
 military as a pretext to re-
 main in control.
 The interim military junta
 promised to restore civil gov-
 ernment when it ousted dictator
 Rojas last May.   It has sched-
 uled a plebiscite on constitu-
 tional amendments  for 1 Decem-
 ber, presidential elections
 next May, and its own withdraw-
 al from government by August.
 In an effort to avoid a resur-
 gence of the traditionally bit-
 ter and violent struggle be-
 tween Liberals and Conservatives
 in two-party Colombia,  leaders
 of both have reached agreement
 on the bipartisan presidential
 candidacy of   Leon  Valencia

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 and political parity  in the
 government for the next 12 years.
 The return to constitutional
 government is threatened by the
 actions of the autocratic, ul-
 traconservative ex-president of
 Colombia,  Laureano Gomez, who
 is determined to dominate the
 Conservative party at any cost
 and is prepared to carry his
 fight for control to the elector-
 ate, where he may have majority
 support.   He now demands that
 legislative elections be held
 before the presidential elec-
 tion--a move opposed by the
 moderate Valencia faction, which
 believes it can obtain a larger
 share of the Conservative vote
 once Valencia is securely in of-
 fice.
 Liberal leader Alberto
 Lleras has reaffirmed his par-
 ty's original support of the
 Valencia candidacy but has im-
 plied he will accept as the au-
 thentic Conservative party the
 faction which emerges strongest
 from the elections for congress.
 The question of when these elec-
 tions are to be held is now be-
 fore the junta and cabinet for
 decision.
 The Valencia wing,  repre-
 senting the industrial interests
 which have been politically
 dominant for decades, thus finds
 itself in a precarious position.
 Should the supporters of Gomez
 emerge from the legislative
 elections as the dominant fac-
 tion of the Conservative party,
 the prospects of the Valencia
 wing will be dim once Liberal
 support is withdrawn.   In addi-
 tion the present cooperation
 between the two parties would
 become much more difficult. Any
 marked revival of interparty
 strife may be used by the mili-
 tary as an excuse to back down
 on the proposed transfer of pow-
 er to civilian control.
 Little if any progress is
 being made by the diverse and
 antagonistic anti-Communist po-
 litical groups in Guatemala to-
 ward agreeing on a coalition
 candidate for the presidential
 election, which will probably
 be set for January.   If the im-
 passe continues and the govern-
 ment remains neutral as it has
 promised,  the Communist-infil-
 trated Revolutionary party (PR)
 might win.   Government support
 for any candidate would probably
 set off renewed violence.
 tial candidate, the leftist but
 non-Communist Mario Mendez
 Montenegro, would win the elec-

 Communists are active in

 the wake of a strong wave of
 popular discontent.
 The principal obstacle to
 an anti-Communist coalition is
 the determination of rightist
 Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes,  lead-
 ing opposition contender in the
 20 October election, to run
 again.   A group of army offi-
 cers who distrust Ydigoras and
 remnants of the moderate par-
 ties which backed the late pres-
 ident Castillo Armas are at-
 tempting to agree on a candi-
 date to oppose both the PR and
 Ydigoras.
 Even in this narrowed po-
 litical spectrum,  however,  there
 are bitter divisions and con-
 flicting ambitions.   Leading
 presidential contenders of this
 group are Lt. Col. Jose Luis
 Cruz Salazar, young and ambi-
 tious ambassador in Washington,
 and the 49-year-old Col. Enrique
 Peralta.   Both have enemies in
 the faction-ridden army and
 neither is widely known to the
 public.
 It is unlikely that any
 anti-Ydigoras, anti-PR coalition
 candidate could win the required
 absolute majority of votes in
 the election unless he had ob-
 vious support from the govern-
 ment.   Such official favoritism
 would almost certainly provoke
 renewed popular disturbances.
 DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIAN ECONOMIC SITUATION
 The Indian government took
 action on 31 October to make
 available nearly all of its
 dwindling foreign exchange re-
 serves to meet commitments un-,
 der its second Five-Year Plan,
 as widespread crop failures
 tightened the squeeze on its
 financial resources.   New Del-
 hi apparently is counting heav-
 ily on American authorization
 of additional surplus food ship-
 ments to ease the new drain on
 its foreign exchange necessitat-
 ed            by emergency food imports.
 Since India's reserves
 were expected to dip below the
 statutory minimum prior to the
 mid-November session of Parlia-
 ment,  a presidential ordinance
 was issued on 31 October author-
 izing reduction of the legal
 reserve requirement from $630,-
 000,000--the level of sterling
 balances   required since August
 as backing for the currency--
 to a new minimum of $179,000,-
 000.   This balance as well may
 he drawn on for a limited peri-
 od, but a gold reserve of $241,-
 000,000 must be retained.   On
 the same day, the government an-
 nounced that it would not con-
 sider any new applications for
 the purchase of capital goods
 abroad--except for maintenance
 and replacement purposes--which
 required initial payments before
 April 1961.
 These financial measures
 followed within a few days the
 return of Finance Minister Krish-
 namachari, who reported to the
 cabinet on his trip to the United
 States, Britain, and West Germany
 is search of long-term loans.
 Krishnamachari reportedly ex-
 pressed "cautious optimism,"
 mainly because he felt India's
 economic situation was now better
 understood abroad,  but he re-
 turned with no firm commitments.
 The "sympathetic" consideration
 given his appeals in Western
 capitals will be followed by
 more detailed study by each
 government and further negotia-
 tions.
 As a result of the severe
 drought in northern and central
 India,  Indian officials estimate

 that the government will have
 to increase its imports of food
 grains by at least 2,000,000

 agriculture told Secretary Ben-
 son on 1 November that available
 stocks of imported grain, in-
 cluding reserves and expected
 shipments, stood at not more
 than 2,500,000 tons,  little more
 than eight months' supply at the
 current rate of use.   The Indian
 off i vial expressed fear of a
 break in the supply next spring,
 and was concerned that the pub-
 lic's lack of confidence in the
 government's ability to supply
 famine areas would have disrupt-
 ing effects.   The main question
 on the mind of Indian officials
 and reporters who talked to Sec-
 retary Benson was how much ad-
 ditional American surplus food
 might be available and how soon
 it could arrive.
 PHILIPPINE ELECTION CAMPAIGN
 The final phase of the
 Philippine election campaign
 has been marked by charges and
 countercharges and some out-
 bursts of violence.                         President
 Garcia is still widely believed
 to be maintaining an edge over
 his opponents, but if elections
 are free, the possibility of an
 upset in the presidential race
 cannot be ruled out.
 In central Luzon, where an
 American embassy observer re-
 ports that Garcia is trailing
 both opposition Liberal candi-
 date Yulo and Progressive candi-
 date Manahan, the President is
 now stressing a "land for the
 landless" theme.   In the past
 week, he has ordered the expro-
 priation of five haciendas and
 promised to help even the work-
 ers on Yulo's sugar estate to
 acquire the land they work. Yulo
 and Manahan are charging that
 Garcia is leading the country
 to economic ruin,  and Senator
 `tecto of the Nationalist-Citi-
 zens party is accusing the three
 other parties of "political   a-
 nachronism" in the Asian strug-
 gle for "economic equality"
 with the West.
 Although Garcia has pledged
 the "cleanest, freest and most
 orderly elections" on 12 Novem-
 ber,                  there has been some ter-
 rorism, including the slaying
 25X1
 of four Liberals on 1 November
 by Nacionalista followers of
 Garcia in his native province
 of Bohol.   The American embassy
 also reports that local observers
 in many Philippine provinces
 continue to expect widespread
 fraud and intimidation on elec-
 tion day,
 The agencies responsible
 for the conduct of the elections
 appear, however, to be making
 an effort to ensure free elec-
 tions.   The Commission on Elec-
 tions, which supervises the actual
 balloting, has been actively in-
 vestigating the financial state-
 ments of all party treasurers
 and reports of political distri-
 bution of government relief funds.
 About 11,000 constabulary
 and army troops have been de-
 ployed throughout the country
 for election duty.   Although con-
 stabulary chief Cabal has desig-
 nated at least 20 of the 53 prov-
 inces  as "potential trouble
 spots," his assertion that  "the
 atmosphere is a lot calmer than
 that which preceded previous
 national elections" appears to
 be borne out by a comparison of
 reported pre-election incidents
 with those preceding the 1953
 and 1955 elections.

 7 November 1957
 The Indonesian government
 has postponed the second na-
 tional conference from 15 to
 25 November.     The postponement
 apparently is intended both to
 permit more time for conference
 preparations and to give the
 government-inspired campaign
 to "regain" Netherlands New
 Guinea greater opportunity to
 penetrate the provinces and
 stimulate national unity be-
 fore the meeting opens.
 Prime Minister Djuanda is
 making no progress in his ef-
 forts to restore an effective
 partnership between President
 Sukarno and former vice presi-
 dent Hatta, a development which
 he feels is the only course
 which can forestall Indonesian
 fragmentation and prevent Com-
 munist control of Java.   Sukar-
 no will not accept Hatta as
 prime minister, and Hatta re-
 portedly is ready to announce
 his support of those elements
 opposing the President and his
 political concepts.   This newly
 reaffirmed antagonism between
 the two men and their supporters
 is unlikely to be relieved by
 either the national conference
 or  the  campaign  for the ac-
 cession of New Guinea.
 The second phase of the
 government's "Regain West Irian
 Drive," which is to be "executed
 more fiercely," is scheduled to
 begin on 10 November.   A third
 phase, the details of which have
 not been revealed, will be car-
 ried out at the time of the UN
 General Assembly debate on the
 subject, probably sometime after
 18 November.   Probably serving
 to increase the intensity of
 the campaign is a joint state-
 ment issued on 6 November by
 Australia and the Netherlands
 reiterating their intention to   25X1
 resist Indonesian demands.
 A major objective of the
 Irian  campaign  continues to
 be the distraction of the Indo-
 nesian public from its genuine
 domestic problems and to raise
 national sentiment to such a
 pitch that it will reduce the
 appeal of provincial demands.
 So far, however, only provincial,
 elements in Makassar, the major
 city geographically closest to
 New Guinea, have shown any sup-
 port for the campaign.
 The situation in North
 Sumatra, where an abortive coup   25X1
 in mid-October temporarily
 threatened local violence, is
 quiet for the moment.

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 There are growing signs
 that conflicting interests
 among Sarit's military subordi-
 nates will become his most ser-
 ious domestic problem.
 The provisional govern-
 ment under Premier Pote Sarasin
 and the Sarit military group
 have as yet shown no intention
 of altering Thailand's pro-
 Western foreign policy, which,
 for domestic consumption, is
 now labeled an "independent"
 policy.   During a 40-minute talk
 with New York Times correspond-
 ent  Suzbergerrit insisted
 that he personally would make
 sure that only a pro-Western and
 anti-Communist premier would
 be appointed after the Decem-
 ber elections.   He also ex-
 pressed his admiration for Pote,
 which seems to confirm reports
 that Sarit is urging Pote to
 stay on as premier after the
 elections.   Pote, however, has
 indicated a preference to re-
 turn to his former position as
 SEATO secretary general.
 The election campaign re-
 mains in low gear, although
 voting is now only about a
 month away.   This situation is
 probably attributable both to
 the martial law which still
 prevails in many parts of the
 country and to the difficulties
 many candidates for the 160
 National Assembly seats at
 stake are having in gaining
 backers on such short notice.
 The Laotian government and
 the Pathet Lao have concluded
 negotiations on the terms of a
 settlement, and Prime Minister
 Souvanna Phouma plans shortly
 to request National Assembly
 approval for a coalition govern-
 ment.   In view of the widespread
 popular desire for an early
 settlement, assembly approval
 will probably be forthcoming.
 Influential leaders such
 as Crown Prince Savang and
 Foreign Minister Phoui Sananilaxie
 have expressed dissatisfaction
 with the lack of safeguards in
 the accords and resentment at
 the high-handed tactics Souvanna
 has used in his attempts to
 drive through a final settlement.
 However, their capability to
 delay or significantly alter the
 form of a settlement appears to
 have been undermined as a result
 of the recent equivocal behavior
 of Interior Minister Katay,
 formerly the leader of elements
 working to restrain Souvanna.
 The windup of the negotia-
 tions came on 31 October when
 Pathet chief Souphannouvong re-
 portedly announced to leading
 deputies of Laos' two major po-
 litical parties in Souvanna's
 office that the Pathets had ap-
 proved the political agreement
 as revised by the Laotian cab-
 inet and would sign a military
 agreement later the same day.

 DROUGHT THREATENS WINTER CROPS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Dry weather affecting most

 100 days.   The drought threat-

 spring's crop of winter wheat--
 which normally accounts for 13
 percent,of food crop produc-
 tion--and the rape crop--source
 of 20 percent of the country's

 ordered local party cadres to
 devote their time to combating
 the drought, and the official
 People's Daily observed on 27
 October that it has been "im-
 possible for many localities
 to fulfill their autumn plant-
 ing assignments."
 Meteorological reports in-
 dicate that a high-pressure area
 has dominated the region for
 weeks, confirming the drought
 reports.   Weather maps as of
 4 November showed that the high
 remained over the area.   Local
 showers over the past two weeks
 may have afforded some relief.
 It is still too early to

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 The ouster of Marshal Zhu-
 kov, just four months after his
 elevation to full membership on
 the party presidium and the dis-
 missal of Malenkov, Molotov, and
 Kaganovich, once again under-
 lines the dynamics of change
 in the leadership of
 the Soviet Union.   In
 the known facts, re-
 ports, and rumors re-
 lating to Zhukov's
 downfall, there is
 enough reasonably re-
 liable information to
 make possible a ten-
 tative reconstruction
 of the actual events.
 Rise of Zhukov.
 and the Army
 Khrushchev's
 rise to power after
 Stalin's death in
 1953 was facilitated
 by close cooperation
 between the Communist
 party and the Soviet army.   Un-
 til last month, each major Khru-
 shchev victory in the party
 presidium was accompanied by a
 step upward by Zhukov in party
 and government.  Four years of
 this alliance resulted in the
 increased independence of the
 armed forces from the political
 controls of Stalin's day.
 Evidence that Stalin's suc-
 cessors intended to use the
 army and Zhukov as a prop for
 the regime Appeared the day af-
 ter Stalin died, when Zhbkbv.
 emerged from four years of vir-
 tual exile as a first deputy
 minister of defense.   Zhukov
 and the army played a major
 role in the purge of secret po-
 lice chief Beria in July 1953.
 Zhukov's reward was promotion
 from candidate to full member-
 ship on the party central com-
 mittee.
 During 1953-55, Soviet
 military leaders apparently be-
 came fearful that  Malen-
 kov's program of increased con-
 sumer goods production would
 result in cutbacks in defense
 production and perhaps in the
 military budget. They accord-
 inv_ly side' with Khrushchev in
 favor of the contin-
 ued primacy of heavy
 industry.   Their re-
 ward came in February
 and March 1955:   Ma-
 lenkov was ousted as
 premier, Zhukov was
 promoted to replace
 Bulganin as defense
 minister, and a num-
 ber of top military
 officers received
 promotions.
 Khrushchev con-
 tinued to woo the
 military at the 20th
 party congress in
 February 1956.   In
 his secret speech de-
 nouncing Stalin, he
 praised Zhukov's qualities as
 a military leader and suggested
 that he had often defended the
 marshal against Stalin.  Follow-
 ing the congress, Zhukov was
 made a candidate member of the
 party presidium.
 Zhukov was called on to
 support Khrushchev for the last
 time in June 1957, when,accord-
 ing to most reports, he lined
 up against Molotov, Malenkov,
 and Kaganovich.   In the realign-
 ment.which followed the purge,
 he was named to full membership
 on the presidium, a promotion
 which for the first time in.So-
 viet history. placed a career
 soldier in a position to exert
 the full weight of the army on
 the formulation of policy.
 Other less spectacular con-
 cessions were made to the army
 during this period.  One of
 these appears to have been the
 admission of professional mili-
 tary officers into the ranks of

 the secret police.  Army influ-
 ence may have played a major
 role in the decision to split
 Beria's secret police empire in
 1954 and assign all secret po-
 lice and intelligence functions
 to the Committee of State Secu-
 rity (KGB).  The party also ap-
 proved the concept of unity of
 command which considerably re-
 duced the powers of political
 officers in the army.  Politi-
 cal deputy commanders below the
 regimental level were removed,
 and those at higher levels are
 no longer able to countermand
 the orders of 'the unit commander..
 The result of this enhance-
 ment of Zhukov's authority,
 coupled with the gradual reduc-
 tion of the party control mech
 anism in the armed forces, was
 the creation of a power center
 which was gradually becoming
 more independent of the party
 and potentially inimical to its
 leader.

 October.  He faced a number of
 serious problems if he was suc-
 cessfully to cut Zhukov down to
 size,.  He had first to sell the
 idea to the party presidium and
 then, at the very least, to
 neutralize the military estab-
 lishment.
 The dominance Khrushchev
 had achieved in the party presid-
 ium in June made the first task
 easier.  Nevertheless, he needed
 some issue on which to base his
 argument other than his desire
 to eliminate a potential rival.
 He seized on the role of the
 party in the armed forces, part-
 ly because there was some evi
 dence that Zhukov had curtailed
 party control in the army and
 partially because the party lead-
 ers are particularly sensitive
 to the question of party control
 over any and all sectors of So-
 viet society.   There are also
 some suggestions that Zhukov
 had taken his political role
 more seriously than appeared
 seemly to the other members of
 the presidium, who may have be-
 come apprehensive concerning
 his political intentions.

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The letter, dated 19 Octo-
 ber, charged that party politi-
 cal work in the armed forces
 had fallen behind in recent
 years, that the political ap-
 paratus had been shoved aside,
 and that commanders had not
 properly.  evaluated political
 work in the army.  Basic blame
 was placed on the leadership of
 the Defense Ministry, but nei-
 ther Zhukov nor anyone else was
 named specifically,,possibly to
 leave an avenue for retreat if
 there was adverse reaction to
 the charges.
 The traditionally apoliti-
 cal attitude of the Russian
 soldier and the legacy of the
 drastic purges of the Red Army
 high command in the 1930's may
 have deterred any hostile re-
 action by top military leaders.
 However, it is possible that
 Zhukov simply did not command
 the respect, admiration, and
 support in military circles
 popularly attributed to him.
 Otherwise, it is inconceivable
 that greater security precau-
 tions would not have been noted
 in and around Moscow when news
 of his demotion became known.
 There is, in fact, a sug-
 gestion that Zhukov's new polit-
 ical role was resented by other
 military leaders, that he may
 have tended to lord it over them
 and treat them as part of his
 personal retinue.  These charges,
 at least, figure strongly in
 the official communiquds and
 editorials.  First Deputy De-
 fense Minister Ivan Konev, for
 example, writing in Pravda on
 3 November, said thatukov
 strove to decide on his own all
 questions relating to the lead-
 ership of the armed forces,,with-
 out listening to the opinions of
 others and fully ignoring their
 views."  Such charges may have
 been largely fictitious, but the
 heavy play given them in offi-
 cial propaganda suggests that
 they have a strong appeal.
 On 22 October, the presid-
 ium again met and voted to oust
 Zhukov as minister of defense.
 At the same meeting, the trans-
 fer of Marshal Konstantin
 Rokossovsky from Moscow to head
 the Transcaucasian Military
 District was decided.  Rokos-
 sovsky's transfer may have been
 intended solely to add to Soviet
 pressure on Turkey in the Turk-
 ish-Syrian crisis, but it is
 conceivable that he was a strong
 Zhukov supporter and was moved
 in order to minimize his influ-
 ence on the other top military
 leaders and to serve as an ex-
 ample to anyone who might be
 inclined to waver from the par-
 ty line.
 The presidium's decision
 and the reasons for the ouster
 were explained to party members
 in the armed forces at meetings
 in military units all over the
 Soviet Union.  The meetings in
 the Moscow Military District
 were held on 24 and 25 October
 with Khrushchev, speaking both
 days, detailing the charges
 against Zhukov.
 Marshal Zhukov returned
 from his trip on 26 October.
 There is a possibility that Khru-
 shchev had ordered Zhukov's stay
 in Albania prolonged in order
 to complete the action against
 him.   Certainly there is no 25X1
 obvious reason in Soviet-Albanian
 relations why he should spend
 days the F"no-     EtE
 2 X1
 Zhukov did not learn o  his re-
 moval until his return.   The
 25X1
 Zhukov, however, may have 25X1
 learned of the Rokossovsky trans-
 fer and resented that it was
 made in his absence.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 November 1957
 secret letter dated 1 November
 to the party membership giving
 some background details on Zhu-
 kov's removal as minister of
 defense and the other, the pub-
 lished resolution of 2 November.
 Zhukov was held guilty of (1)
 frustrating party control of
 the armed forces;  (2) deliber-
 ately promoting hero worship of
 himself;  (3) encouraging mis-
 representation of World War II
 history in his own favor and at
 the expense  of  others;   (4)
 proneness to adventurism in for-
 eign policy and management of
 defense affairs.
 Even if it is assumed--as
 official Soviet treatment of
 the case and obvious'leaks would

 viet public media.
 have it--that the main charges
 against Zhukov that he tried
 to weaken party control of the
 armed forces and to build him-
 self into a potential Bonaparte
 are the real basis for the ac-
 tion against him, there is still
 no satisfactory explanation as to
 why these issues became para-
 mount at this time.   The avail-
 able evidence indicates that
 Zhukov has long sought to hold
 the party's interference in
 military command functions with-
 in limits determined by himself.
 And if Zhukov's urge for self-
 glorification was as overwhelm-
 ing as the party now alleges,
 it could hardly have been a
 well-kept secret.   Ther.e'would.
 almost certainly.:have._been'vis
 ible signs.of.any concerted        25X1
 build-up of a Zhukov "cult,:" :yet
 Only last June , barely three
 months before Zhukov left Mos-
 cow for Yugoslavia, he had been
 promoted to the party's highest
 body.   Conceivably, a hot de-
 bate over political control of
 the military, of which there were
 no public manifestations,. broke
 out in the presidium after June.
 The only published explanation
 of this paradox by a Communist
 source is that offered by the
 Moscow correspondent of the
 London Daily Worker who wrote
 aImely:      tfiThe appointment
 of Marshal Zhukov as a full
 member of the presidium of the
 party at the last session of the
 central committee, it was thought
 that his position would change.
 Instead, it was found that even
 greater difficulties were being
 placed in the way of the work
 of the Communist party organi-
 zations in the army and it was
 also said that Marshal Zhukov
 was getting himself boosted in
 every sort of way."

 debating points which evade
 more fundamental causes of con-
 flict.   Unquestionably, Zhukov's
 party position, his prestige,
 and his command of a powerful,
 organized force gave him at
 least the potential for inde-
 pendent political action.   It
 can only be conjectured when
 and how Zhukov began to exer-
 cise his power in  a-, way to
 arouse suspicion or fear in
 Khrushchev and his party col-
 leagues.
 As minister of defense
 and, later, as a full, voting
 member of the presidium, he
 would have had occasion to ex-
 press himself on a broad range
 of policy issues touching on
 the military interest.   The 2
 November central committee re-
 solution on Zhukov contained
 the accusation that he was "dis-
 posed to adventurism both in
 his understanding of the main
 tasks of the Soviet Union's
 foreign policy and in heading
 the Defense Ministry."  Though
 purposefully vague, the state-
 ment points to issues of policy
 beyond the question of polit-
 ical control  of  the., armed
 forces.
 anecdote related by Khrushchev
 at the Turkish National Day re-
 ception on 29 October about the
 little Jew and the burly anarch-
 ist was intended as a hint of
 a divergence on the USSR's pol-
 icy.in the Turkish-Syrian dis-
 pute.   In this story Khrushchev
 portrayed himself as following
 a bold policy while the pro-
 fessional soldier held back.
 Whatever may have been
 Khrushchev's purpose,.  there
 is no evidence to support the
 thesis that Soviet actions in
 the Syrian crisis precipitated
 a showdown between Zhukov and
 the party leaders.   Zhukov's
 strong statement in his Tirana
 speech on 24 October about So
 Viet readiness "to strike with
 determination at any military
 adventure near our southern
 borders" conformed closely to
 the official Soviet line as
 stated by Khrushchev, Bulganin,
 and Gromyko.
 Another possibility is
 that the issue goes back to the
 1956 crisis in the satellites
 and the Middle East and that
 Khrushchev is accusing Zhukov
 of taking a tough line at that
 time which limited Khrushchev's
 freedom of action.
 There are some indications
 that another difficult and del-
 icate: issue may have arisen
 between Zhukov and the nonmili-
 tary members of the presidium--
 the issue of control of the
 security apparatus.   There is
 little doubt that Zhukov had
 used his influence to limit the
 powers of the police.   It is
 not unlikely that one of his
 main political objectives was
 to ensure against a resurgent
 police organization.
 Khrushchev, in speeches to the
 party organization of the Mos-
 cow Military District on 24 and
 25 October, alleged that Zhukov
 had sought the removal of I.A.

 his replacement by a military
 man and had also recommended
 the appointment of Marshal
 Konev as minister of interior.
 It is conceivable also,
 though Soviet comments do not
 suggest this, that Zhukov was
 removed because he may have re-
 sisted economic allocation pol-
 icies which implied a reduction
 in military expenditures.  Khru-
 shchev is publicly committed to
 increase foodstuffs, housing,
 and consumer goods,   to main-...
 tain a high rate of industrial
 growth, and, of course, to main-
 tain a high rate of defense ex-
 penditures.  The problem is how
 to do everything at once.   The
 necessary decision on priorities
 is almost bound to arouse some
 further dissatisfaction and it
 is within the realm of possi-
 bilities that Zhukov was re-
 moved because he opposed a
 solution which would force the
 Soviet military machine to give
 up, for example, some part of
 its 175 divisions.
 On the face of it, Khru-
 shchev has again won the day
 and it seems entirely possible
 that he can parlay his winnings
 to achieve eventual one-man
 control.   There certainly are
 strong signs that this is the
 goal, and it might be expected
 that having already gone so far
 in this direction, Khrushchev
 would feel compelled to complete
 the job quickly.
 In many ways the time is
 ripe.   Certainly the power of
 most of the other presidium
 members is now only a shadow of
 what it was immediately follow-
 ing Stalin's death, and six of
 the ten veteran presidium mem-
 bers--the Stalin heirs--have
 been deposed.   The party ap-
 paratus headed by Khrushchev
 has in turn beaten down the po-
 lice, the economic bureaucracy,
 and now the army.
 Some of the consequences
 of the latest move are quite
 obvious.   Khrushchev's policy
 has consistently   been  to':
 strengthen the standard party
 organs at the expense of the
 special political organs.   He
 may be expected to bring the
 armed forces more closely under
 the direct authority of the .
 party central committee, per-
 haps by dissolving the special
 political organs in the armed
 forces as he has eliminated
 them from agriculture and trans-
 port.   The sole arm of the party
 in the military would then be
 the standard party organiza-
 tions, subordinate to the party
 apparatus which Khrushchev ap-
 parently controls, and the armed
 forces as an independent locus
 of power would be weakened con-
 siderably.
 Another important implica-
 tion is that with the possible
 exception of Mikoyan, the removal
 of Zhukov leaves no strong figure
 in the presidium who could be ex-
 pected-to exert an effective re-
 straining influence on Khru-
 shchev's impetuousness.   As a
 result, Khrushchev's policy will
 probably more than ever be So-
 viet policy, and policy formula-
 tion may pass gradually from
 the hands of the presidium mem-
 bers to those of the central
 party apparatus.
 This latest move, of course,
 is bound to have undesired ef-
 fects.   Among the populace, the
 apathy and cynicism noted after
 the June purge will probably in-
 crease, and the purge of Zhukov
 will add to the doubts and un-
 easiness of the public in gen-
 eral.   The extent to which the
 leadership and propaganda ap-
 paratus has been employed in
 stating the regime's case in-
 dicates the seriousness with
 which the question of public
 opinion is regarded.

 resentment at the lower levels
 undoubtedly will be countered
 with effective political in-
 doctrination.
 Given the probable desire.
 on the part of the leadership
 to present a semblance of unity,
 the traditional nonpolitical
 role of most officers, and the
 opportunism of others, there is
 not likely to be a far-reaching
 purge resembling that of the
 thirties.   There probably are
 strong pro-Zhukov elements in
 the military, however, who, in
 time, will feel the effects of
 his degradation.  Retirements
 and reassignments are likely to
 occur, including some within
 the Defense Ministry.
 Party Reaction
 Khrushchev may find that
 his greatest obstacle lies with-
 in the apparatus of the party--
 the very instrument of power
 which he has fought to strengthen
 since becoming first secretary
 it September 1953.   There have
 already been suggestions that
 Khrushchev has not been able
 to exert full control over the
 central committee despite his
 success in adding his followers
 to its membership.   The plenum
 of December 1956 and probably
 also that of June 1957.ma.y not
 have moved exactly as?Khru-Phchev
 Not all the changes that
 may occur will be politically
 motivated.   It would be normal,
 for example,  if Marshal Malin-
 ovsky should appoint some of
 his former associates or friends
 to key staff and command posi-
 tions which, in turn, could be
 reflected in the lower echelons.
 Some of the appointments may be
 a combination of this factor and
 political considerations.   While
 Malinovsky may be expected to
 desire a chief of staff of his
 own choosing, the removal of
 Marshal Sokolovsky would also
 serve Khrushchev's political in-
 terests.
 There is little evidence
 on which to base political align
 ments within the Soviet military
 hierarchy, and the lines of
 cleavage, always obscure, may
 change with the political tides.
 It is generally assumed, how-
 ever, that Marshal Sokolovsky at
 least, and possibly Marshals
 Meretskov and Vasilevsky, are
 pro-Zhukov.
 had   planned.l
 There have been some sug-
 gestions that the secretariat
 is not completely subservient
 to Khrushchev.
 Party Secretary Suslov be-
 longs to a Stalinist faction
 and cannot be considered in
 Khrushchev's.camp.  These hints
 of continuing division within
 the leadership, plus the obvious-
 ly disquieting effects of two
 purges of the hierarchy within
 four months and the implication
 that Khrushchev is bent for to-
 tal power, could bring about a
 move against him while some
 chance of success still remains.
 There are other possible
 developments which would in-
 crease the opposition to Khru-
 shchev.                                                                  A move on his part

 personal tool would undoubtedly
 provoke the strongest reaction
 and he might therefore wish to
 avoid it.   Yet personal control
 of the secret police is the next
 step in achieving a one-man
 dictatorship, and the temptation
 to seize this control and there-
 by prevent the development of
 another plot against him would
 be very powerful indeed.
 Foreign Policy
 There has been considerable
 speculation that the purge of
 Zhukov means the removal of an
 important restraining influence
 on an impetuous and unpredict-
 able Khrushchev.   This inter-
 pretation, however, may rest on
 a superficial reading of Khru-
 shchev's character and his
 methods and tactics in the for-
 eign policy field.   He has shown
 a high degree of skill in ex-
 tracting the maximum political
 advantage from such issues as
 the Suez conflict, the Turkish
 Syrian dispute,  and disarmament
 POLICY TRENDS IN THE NEW WEST GERMAN GOVERNMENT
 West Germany is likely to
 demonstrate during Chancellor
 Adenauer's third term a more
 self-assertive role within the
 framework of the Western al-
 liance.   Increasingly distrust-
 ful of leaving its fate in the
 hands of other major powers,
 Bonn will probably seek a grad-
 ual extension of its political
 influence to a point commensu-
 rate with its already impor-
 tant world economic position.
 In the military field, Defense
 Minister Strauss is likely to
 concentrate on equipping exist-
 ing forces with modern weapons.
 In foreign policy, an early ef-
 fort toward improving relations
 with the Eastern European satel-
 lites, particularly Poland, seems
 likely, although Tito's recogni-
 tion of East Germany may delay
 this step.
 These moves would be logical
 extensions of the accomplish-
 ments of the Adenauer govern-
 ments over the past eight years,
 in which stress had to be placed
 first on economic reconstruction
 and political rehabilitation.
 The altered emphasis to be ex-
 pected now is reflected in Ade-
 nauer's cabinet changes.  While
 most of the cabinet remains in-
 tact, the prominent position

 SECRET
 by assuming forceful, even
 threatening, postures.   However,
 this public posture has thus
 far always been accompanied by
 careful avoidance of any action
 committing the USSR to a course
 which might lead to the involve-
 ment of Soviet forces in a mili-
 tary conflict.
 The principal device of
 Khrushchev's diplomacy in both
 the Suez conflict and the Turk-
 ish-Syrian dispute has been the
 use of calculated ambiguity in
 statements setting forth Soviet
 positions and intentions.  This
 technique reflects, not a tend-
 ency toward impetuous and-reck-
 less action,  but rather a cool
 and astute appraisal of oppor-
 tunities for scoring heavy po-
 litical gains against the West-
 ern powers.  It is a technique
 which Khrushchev probably con-
 siders he can employ with ins
 creasing effectiveness as the
 military strength of the Soviet
 bloc grows.                           25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 chancellor and economics min-
 ister is indicative of the
 forthcoming shift toward a more
 expansive foreign, military,
 and economic policy.   In re-
 placing Fritz Schaeffer as fi-
 nance minister with Franz Etzel,
 Adenauer has done away with
 an ultraconservative financial
 influence which would, among
 other things, have blocked  he
 desired new changes  in  mili-
 tary policy.
 Military Policy
 Defense Minister Strauss
 has already indicated that an
 increase in the defense budget
 will be necessary to support a
 continued build-up of the armed
 forces.   He is still planning,
 however, a commitment to NATO
 of only 340,000 men  by  1961
 instead of the original German
 figure  of 500,000.   Strauss
 has placed  some emphasis on
 the creation of home-defense
 forces, to be solely under Ger-
 man command, which on at least
 one  occasion he  indicated
 might eventually reach the goal
 of 200,000 men.:   If this plan
 should be adopted, Strauss would
 have thus split the original
 500,000-man NATO goal between
 NATO and non-NATO forces.
 The Defense Ministry has
 also shown growing interest in
 obtaining modern weapons.   It
 has    been  opposed to any ac-
 celerated build-up of its NATO
 contingent before NATO has
 thoroughly considered the im-
 plications of modern weapons
 developments.   In forthcoming
 NATO and WEU meetings, the Ger-
 man delegation is expected to
 raise the question of obtain-
 ing nuclear weapons, and also
 to argue in favor of a German
 contribution based   on  the
 smaller, more mobile pentomic-
 type divisions supported by
 modern weapons, including mis-
 siles.   Bonn has already 'in-
 formed the United States, Brit-
 ain, and France of plans to ask
 for a revision of the WELL treaty
 in order to permit a German firm
 to produce a small antitank mis-
 sile which it has developed.
 Strauss' defense policies
 will encounter opposition in
 the Bundestag, since both the
 Social Democrats and Free Demo-
 crats continue to favor a small
 professional military force and
 have made a major issue of the
 atomic weapons question.   The
 government's majority, however,
 should ensure the increased de-
 fense appropriations it seeks.
 Economic Policy
 Franz Etzel's appointment
 is regarded by political  ob-
 servers as?a concession by Ade-
 nauer to industrialist circles,
 and his policies are expected
 to reinforce Erhard's continu-
 ing efforts to expand Germany's
 foreign trade.  There are some
 indications   that, with   this
 aim  in view, the    government
 will initiate a more extensive
 program of technical assistance
 and other forms of economic aid
 to the underdeveloped countries.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 November 1957
 Within the Federal Re-
 public, Etzel can be expected
 to promote policies designed to
 encourage private savings as
 a new source of capital for in-
 dustrial growth.   In addition
 to extensive tax reforms, the
 trend toward deficit budgets
 will also continue, as well as
 some liberalization of corpora-
 tion profit taxes.   The estab-
 lishment of a new ministry for
 state-owned property will fa-
 cilitate the new policy of
 selling stock in the govern-
 ment's industrial holdings--
 such as the Volkswagen plant--
 as an additional stimulant to
 investment by small shareholders..
 Inflationary pressure can
 be expected from some of these
 programs, but the administra-
 tion has already taken some
 countermeasures, such as reduc-
 ing tariffs,  increasing reserve
 requirements for foreign de-
 posits, and making an advance
 payment to the International
 Bank for Reconstruction and
 Development.   Nevertheless,
 American officials in Bonn ex-
 pect prices to go up 2 to 3
 percent in the next six months.
 Foreign Policy
 Adenauer's election victory
 was generally interpreted as
 an affirmation of the "policy
 of strength" through the NATO
 alliance, and the basic ele-
 ments of Bonn's foreign policy
 will continue unchanged.  There
 is, however, an inclination for
 a more "active" policy toward
 the Soviet bloc.
 The opposition parties
 have long pressed for an ex-
 pansion of trade relations with
 the Eastern European satellites
 and even for the establishment
 of political relations.  A com-
 prehensive review of Eastern
 European policy was being con-
 ducted by the Foreign Ministry
 when Tito's recognition of East
 Germany precipitated a crucial
 decision as to how far Bonn
 should go in creating a favor-
 able atmosphere for a rapproche-
 ment with Poland.  The Social
 Democrats and Free Democrats
 will continue to prod the gov-
 ernment to improve relations
 with the East.  Any action
 taken in this direction will
 be endorsed by the opposition
 parties, but anything short of
 the achievement of reunifica-
 tion will still be decried as
 insufficient.

 Although the Foreign Min-
 istry favored a break with Bel-
 grade for reasons of prestige
 and to discourage further rec-
 ognition of East Germany, the
 explanation of this policy was
 couched in such a manner as to
 allow an approach to Poland.
 Chancellor Adenauer, in his
 policy statement on 29 October,
 referred to West Germany's "de-
 termination to settle the ques-

 the Soviet bloc countries in a

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 In planning closer rela-
 tions with                       the.  satellites,
 Bonn's main political motivation
 is the hope that diplomatic re-
 lations would provide an oppor-
 tunity for weakening Polish
 support of East Germany and en-
 listing support for at least
 some of Bonn's unification terms.
 Increased trade  and economic
 aid  are   seen  as  means of
 strengthening the Gomulka gov-
 ernment and encouraging a more
 independent  Polish foreign
 policy.
 NEW PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT'S GROWING ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
 The new Pakistani govern-
 ment under Prime Minister Chund-
 rigar, though retaining the pro-
 Western foreign policy outlook
 of its predecessors,  seems like-
 ly to reverse the trend started
 by former prime minister Suhra-
 wardy toward more rapid economic
 progress and to revert to drift-
 ing policies.   This               refusal
 to face up to economic realities
 may result in serious deteriora-
 tion of the country's economy.
 Increased economic instability,
 coupled with continuing politi-
 cal confusion, would neutralize
 the effectiveness of American
 military aid and probably make
 Pakistan increasingly dependent
 on foreign economic assistance.
 Pakistan has suffered from
 political instability throughout
 the ten years of its existence.
 Its national constitution was
 put into effect only in 1956,
 and it still has not held its
 first national election.   Its
 economic development has been
 slow, and plans prepared by the
 government have not been effec-
 tively implemented.
 economic miracle,
 Suhrawardy, during his 13
 months in office, performed no
 did, however, accomplish two
 important things.   By close
 personal attention, he material-
 ly improved the efficiency and
 morale of government departments
 and gave their personnel for
 the first time in recent years
 a sense of "going somewhere."
 He also began a concerted at-
 tack                                                       on Pakistan's most press-
 ing economic problem--that of
 increasing food production.
 New Government
 Chundrigar, the new
 minister,

 landowning elite of West Paki-
 stan, a group which is not likely
 to take decisive action on such

 essential programs as land re-
 form and rural development for
 fear of losing its political
 and economic power.
 Cabinet members, during
 their tenure in office, will al-
 most certainly be more concerned
 with politicking than with eco-
 nomic development, a subject.in
 which most have neither train-
 ing nor special interest.   Their
 positions are shaky at present
 and the existing government coa-
 lition may not last long.      Since
 any successor government would
 take some time to consolidate
 its position politically, eco-
 nomic development seems virtual-
 ly certain to be retarded for
 a considerable period, and one
 or more of the country's econom-
 ic problems may in the meantime
 become critical.
 Food and Population
 In the last ten years,
 Pakistan's food production has
 not increased significantly,
 while the population has risen
 by about one million persons
 annually.   Previously self-suf-
 ficient, Pakistan now must im-
 port 600,000 tons of grain each
 year to maintain its 1948-52
 level of supply.   Because of
 summer flood damage in 1957, it
 has recently requested 100,000
 tons of additional emergency
 wheat shipments from the United
 States for this year.
 Trade and Payments Position
 Production of raw jute and
 cotton,  Pakistan's two largest
 foreign exchange earners, has
 been relatively unsatisfactory
 this year.   Exports of jute
 goods for the year ending in
 June were below the previous
 year  in   quantity' and,:, de-
 spite good prices, declined 15
 percent in value.   World demand
 for jute is dropping gradually,
 and the future of the industry
 is bleak.   Exports of cotton
 declined during the year ending
 in July,  and Pakistan seems to
 to be losing most of its markets
 other than France and Japan.
 Tea production showed a 21.8-
 percent decrease between April
 .and August 1957, as compared
 with the same period in 1956,
 while there was a 95.2-percent
 drop in tea exports.
 At the same time its for-
 eign exchange earnings have
 gone down, Pakistan has found
 the price of imports going up.
 Its balance of trade has been
 adversely affected, and was un-
 favorable by $56,000,000 for
 the year ending June 1957.   Its
 balance of payments position
 also deteriorated, the present
 balance being $131,300,000 less
 than in June 1956.
 Most of the increase in
 payments was on behalf of the
 government, a large part for
 food grains, and this seriously
 limited exchange allocations to
 private business.   Private pay-
 ments rose only slightly during
 the year.   Foreign exchange re-
 serves were reduced by $40,800,-
 000 during the year ending in
 June, and in that month stood
 at $252,105,000.   By the end
 of August, they were still go-
 ing down and were reported as
 fast nearing the minimum safe
 level.
 Pakistan's money supply
 increased by $94,500,000 from
 July 1956 to June 1957, follow-
 ing an increase of $136,500,000
 in the preceding year.   The
 government's rate of deficit
 financing reportedly is running
 at twice the level anticipated
 in the budget, and inflation
 has become an increasingly seri-
 ous-problem.   Since 1955, for
 example, inflation in East Paki-
 stan has caused an estimated
 20- to 25-percent price rise
 in mass consumption goods.
 Development Plans
 Despite the fact that the
 development program seemed to
 be stimulated during the first
 half of 1957 under Prime Minis-
 ter                                                            Suhrawardy,'  industrial

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 November 1957
 production leveled off somewhat
 during the year.   Well-informed
 sources estimate that West Paki-
 stan  manufacturing plants are
 operating at only about 50 per-
 cent of capacity.                 There has
 also been considerable bickering
 within the government on the
 nature and advisability of con-
 structing new steel and ferti-
 lizer plants.   Pakistan's trans-
 poration system is overburdened,
 and no significant progress in
 improvement is being made.
 On 7 September,  the Paki-
 stan Planning Board, on the in-
 structions of the finance minis-
 ter, recommended a 40-percent
 cut in development expenditure
 targets for fiscal 1959.  This
 indicates that the Five-Year
 Plan (1955-60) will fall well
 short of its goals.   Despite
 the cut in expenditures, Paki-
 stan will probably find it dif-
 ficult to increase exports to
 compensate for more expensive
 imports.   Defense expenditures
 are still running high, and an
 all-out effort is needed to
 step up domestic production.
 Widespread labor unrest
 was evident during October. A
 nationwide strike of post and
 telegraph workers and a strike
 of government employees in East
 Pakistan were staved off by
 promises to review pay scales.
 SECRET
 A strike of. 20, 000 workers at
 the Adamjee Jute Mills in East
 Pakistan closed the mills.   A
 strike of the Transport and
 Carriers Union swamped the rail-
 way and dockyards in Karachi.
 A strike at the Wah Ordnance
 Factory continued and the Paki-
 stan Petroleum Workers' Federa-
 tion served notice on all major
 oil companies of an impending
 strike.   This unrest is the
 result of the steadily increas-
 ing cost of living.
 International Disputes
 In addition to these do-
 mestic matters, Pakistan faces
 such international issues as
 the disputes with India over
 Kashmir and the distribution
 of irrigation canal waters. The
 present government leaders seem
 less qualified than Suhrawardy
 to handle negotiations.   As
 long as serious economic prob-
 lems plague this leadership,
 India will be disinclined to
 make any major concession to
 its smaller neighbor.   Indian
 High Commissioner Desai in Ka-
 rachi recently indicated that
 anyone would make a better prime
 minister than Suhrawardy, ap-
 parently indicating that, from
 India's point of view, Suhra-
 wardy might eventually have
 strengthened Pakistan to India's
 disadvantage, while under Chund-
 rigar there'is no such danger.
