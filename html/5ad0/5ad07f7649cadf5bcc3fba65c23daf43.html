 After five months out of public view, both Mao Tse-tung and his heir,
 Lin Piao, appeared in Peking to mark the 20th anniversary of Communist
 rule in China. The leadership did not produce any new or distinctive policy
 guidelines on this important occasion, and the sobriety and restraint of the
 ceremonies reflected clearly that there was little to celebrate.
 One highlight of the almost perfunctory proceedings was the emergence
 of a considerable thaw in Sino-Vietnamese relations. In marked contrast with
 last year's National Day, when Vietnam was ignored, Chinese propaganda
 went to considerable lengths to emphasize solidarity between Peking and
 Hanoi. Peking may be seeking opportunities to influence Hanoi during the
 early post-Ho era. The unusually high level of both the North Vietnamese
 and North Korean delegations to Peking suggests that the Chinese are making
 renewed efforts to counter Soviet attempts to isolate them.
 The first important policy statement from Hanoi since the death of Ho
 Chi Minh emphasized the necessity of building socialism so that the struggle
 in the South could be pursued more effectively. In saying this, politburo
 member Truong Chinh restated a theme that he has advocated for more than
 a year. No other clues to the composition of the leadership in Hanoi came to
 light during the past week, but Chinh's remarks strongly suggest that he
 remains one of the dominant voices.

 reports, most of the victims have
 been children.   There are no re-
 liable indications, however, of
 how far the epidemic has spread
 or of how many people have been
 afflicted.   The mortality rate
 is believed to be in the range
 of 5 to 20 percent of those af-
 flicted.
 Politburo member Truong Chinh
 last week delivered the post-Ho
 regime's first important policy
 statement.   Speaking in his ca-
 pacity as chairman of the National
 Assembly's standing committee,
 Chinh restated policies that he
 has been advocating strongly for
 more than a year.   Once again he
 seemed to argue that more of North
 Vietnam's energies should be de-
 voted to "building socialism" and
 repairing the physical damage and
 decline in morale caused by the
 war.   The war itself took a sec-
 ondary place in Chinh's speech,
 although he maintained that the
 best way to support the war ef-
 fort is to make certain that North
 Vietnam is strong.   No other clues
 to the distribution of power in
 the current leadership emerged
 during the week, but Chinh's re-
 marks strongly suggest that he
 remains one of the dominant voices
 in Hanoi.

 US troop withdrawals and more pub-

 in the Paris talks.   Recent cease-
 fire proposals emanating from prom-

 attacked by South Vietnamese
 spokesmen--some from groups that
 have themselves advocated a cease-
 fire in the past--as "meddling,"
 "unacceptable," or as likely to

 assure the public about the US        near the Demilitarized Zone, in

 In a recent television appearance,
 Thieu claimed that, while the pace
 of "Vietnamization" to date has
 been based on South Vietnam's
 ability to replace US soldiers,
 more weight would be given in de-
 termining future US withdrawals to
 two other criteria:   the status
 of the talks in Paris and the
 level of enemy activity in Viet-
 nam.   In a follow-up interview
 last week, Defense Minister Vy
 went a step further by declaring
 that future US troop reductions
 would depend on favorable progress
 in Paris and a lessening of enemy
 activity on the battlefield.
 Thieu, meanwhile, has pub-
 licly observed that the replace-
 ment of all US troops would not
 be possible by the end of 1970
 but would require several years
 to complete.   He also told a
 gathering of government trainees
 that substantial additional US
 forces could be withdrawn if ad-
 equate material help were forth-
 coming, but that South Vietnam
 would not stop short of victory
 whatever happened.
 Military Developments
 The ground war was rela-
 tively quiet again this week,
 maintaining the general pattern
 of the past three months.   Light,
 The latest battle casualty
 reports reveal that both allied
 and enemy losses decreased sig-
 nificantly in the third quarter
 of this year.   During July, Au-
 gust,, and September an average
 of some 150 US personnel were
 killed each week, compared with
 an average of some 280 per week
 in all of 1968 and about 245 per
 week in the first six months of
 1969.   For the past three months
 approximately 230 South Vietnamese
 military personnel have been
 killed per week, down from an
 average of nearly 470 combat deaths
 per week in 1968 and about 310
 per week in the first six months
 of this year.   Current allied
 casualty rates are generally in
 line with those of the so-called
 "lull" periods in the summer and
 late fall of 1968.
 Reported enemy battle losses
 during the past three months have
 also dropped off, averaging about
 2,500 deaths per week compared
 with an average of some 3,500 enemy
 killed per week during all of 1968
 and the first half of 1969.
 These lower casualty figures
 reflect changes in enemy tactics
 this year.   Except for late Febru-
 ary and March, when the Communists
 carried out a costly offensive,

 SOVIET-INDONESIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS To BE RESUMED
 Recent talks in Djakarta
 have re-established a framework
 for Soviet-Indonesian economic
 relations.  Further discussion
 on the important issue of re-
 payment of Indonesia's huge debt
 to the USSR has been deferred,
 however, to a later round of
 talks.   These probably will be
 held following a meeting later
 this month of Indonesia's West-
 ern creditors, who are consider-
 ing a long-term plan for repay-
 ment of Indonesia's debt.
 Despite failure to reach
 final agreement on all issues
 that existed before or arose
 following the abortive Commu-
 nist coup in Indonesia in 1965,
 significant steps have been made
 toward reviving economic rela-
 tions.   The USSR agreed to re-
 sume aid to some projects held
 in abeyance since mid-1966, in-
 cluding a steel plant and a
 superphosphate fertilizer plant.
 The USSR also indicated its will-
 ingness to extend new aid for
 Indonesian tin and fishing indus-
 tries and to continue cash sales
 of spare parts for previously
 supplied Soviet military equip-
 ment.
 The month-long talks aired
 divergent positions on repayment
 of Indonesia's $800-million debt,
 largely incurred from Soviet mili-
 tary aid.   Djakarta firmly under-
 scored its inability to repay
 this debt in accordance with a
 rescheduling arranged in 1966.
 Indonesia has failed to make
 any of the payments--totaling
 about $40 million--that have
 fallen due under that agreement,
 claiming they were too stringent
 for Indonesia's weak economy.
 As an alternative, Indonesia
 proposes that the USSR consider
 extendin  much easier repayment
 terms.
 The Soviets' willingness to
 resume some economic assistance
 to Djakarta represents a soften-
 ing in their attitude and sug-
 gests that Moscow now feels it
 is more in its interest to culti-
 vate the Indonesian  Government.
 For the last three years the So-
 viets have avoided being identi-   25X1
 fied with the regime because of
 its persecution of Indonesian
 Communists.

 the 20th anniversary of Communist

 of which are still bedeviled by

 same themes were emphasized at

 to Peking's slow progress in re-
 pairing the political damage
 caused by the Cultural Revolution.
 Perhaps the most noteworthy
 aspect in the otherwise drab pro-
 ceedings was the emergence of a
 considerable thaw in Sino-Vietnam-
 ese relations.   The Chinese pro-
 vided elaborate welcoming cere-
 monies for the North Vietnamese
 delegation headed by Premier Pham
 Van Dong and for the National
 Liberation Front/Provisional Revo-
 lutionary Government delegation.
 In marked contrast with last
 year's National Day when the topic
 of Vietnam was ignored, Chinese
 propaganda went to considerable
 lengths to emphasize the solidar-
 ity between Peking and Hanoi.   A
 Chinese news agency commentary of
 29 September congratulated Hanoi
 on its "victories over US aggres-
 sion" and used the analogy of
 "lips and teeth" in describing
 the closeness of Sino-Vietnamese
 relations--language identical to
 the Chinese line before the ad-
 vent of negotiations.   In Hanoi,
 the North Vietnamese turned out
 an impressive display of high-
 level leaders to celebrate the
 Chinese anniversary and stress the
 importance they attach to their
 alliance with Peking.
 Sino-Vietnamese relations
 have been strained since Hanoi
 opted for negotiations in mid-
 1968.   Peking, however, undoubt-
 edly has been encouraged by the
 lack of progress at Paris and now
 may believe that closer relations
 with Hanoi will afford it new op-
 portunities to influence the post-
 Ho leadership.
 The unusually high level of
 both the North Korean and North
 Vietnamese delegations to Peking
 suggests that Peking is making
 renewed efforts to counter Soviet
 attempts to isolate China.   The
 National Day ceremonies also spot-
 lighted Peking's continuing pre-
 occupation with the tense Sino-
 Soviet frontier.   Chinese pro-
 nouncements were full of allu-
 sions to Soviet efforts at "nu-
 clear blackmail" and attempts to
 foment "rebellion" in frontier
 areas.   Despite this hostile and
 defensive posture, however,            25X1
 Lthe Kosygin-Chou meeting o
 11 September resulted in an agree-
 ment: to hold border talks.  An
 authoritative Chinese editorial
 of 30 September pointedly referred
 to China's desire to settle border
 disputes through negotiations.
 Although this merely reiterates
 Peking's long-standing public po-
 sition on the border dispute, its
 timing may indicate that talks
 are indeed in prospect.
 China's latest atmospheric
 nuclear test on 29 September has
 not been mentioned, even in con-
 nection with National Day.   Nor-
 mally, the Chinese Communists make
 a nuclear test the occasion for
 major propaganda fanfare, but Pe-
 king may have decided that it was
 prudent not to flaunt its nuclear
 program on the eve of talks with
 Moscow.

 Ironically, in Czechoslovakia the ultraconservatives, who are wary of
 association with the West, increased their strength as a result of the recent
 central committee plenum. In the purge of the party and government,
 Dubcek, who last year was considering diplomatic relations with Bonn, lost
 two of his high posts. Although Husak apparently is still in control of the
 party, he is hard pressed by the ultras.
 Some cooling of the Sino-Soviet border dispute appears in the offing as
 hints of new negotiations flow from Moscow. There are also signs that the
 Soviet leaders are engaged in increased politicking at home. Evading the
 usual practice of silence on unresolved questions, first deputy premier
 Polyansky has entered the current press discussion of collective farm man-
 agement with two sharply worded articles signed by his personal assistant.
 His move suggests a growing intensity in the behind-the-scenes debate on
 domestic affairs.
 The European Community is considering ways to adjust the Common
 Agricultural Policy (CAP) to the German decision to let the exchange rate of
 the mark "float." The result is likely to be that the CAP, only recently
 adjusted to the French devaluation, will be weakened further.
 The deadline passed on 1 October for British compliance with the UN
 General Assembly's resolution requesting London "to terminate the colonial
 situation in Gibraltar." In retaliation for British inaction, Madrid cut off
 telephone and telegraph communication between Gibraltar and Spain.
 The Swedish Social Democratic Party chose Olof Palme as its new party
 chairman by acclamation. It is likely that Palme will follow tradition and
 simultaneously serve as prime minister after Tage Erlander ends his 23-year
 term in office on 14 October.

 MORE PURGES ANTICIPATED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The long-awaited plenum of
 the Czechoslovak party central
 committee which took place on 25-
 26 September set the stage for a
 major purge of party, state, and
 mass organizations.   Party leader
 Husak emerged from the meeting in
 apparent control of a still-di-
 vided party, but despite his ap-
 parent decision to rule in a more
 authoritarian manner he may face
 even greater challenges from the
 archconservatives, whose position
 was strengthened by the plenum's
 decisions.
 In a hard-hitting speech on
 25 September Husak indicated that
 the plenum's purge of the central
 committee and the revamping of the
 federal and the Czech governments
 was but the beginning of a thor-
 oughgoing purge.   Husak emphasized
 that the most important task will
 be the ouster of liberal elements
 from the local party organizations.
 The party will also concentrate on
 regaining control of education,
 science,  art, and culture,  fields
 which are still dominated by lib-
 erals or moderates.   In addition,
 the trade union organizations will
 be a major target.   Some local
 party organizations, particularly
 those in Prague, have already
 ousted liberals, and the party or-
 ganizations at several universi-
 ties have been disbanded.   Husak's
 remarks suggest also that those
 members of the central committee
 who were elected at the now-dis-
 credited extraordinary 14th party
 congress may eventually lose their
 positions on the committee.
 against "antisocialists" who break
 the law.   He apparently remains
 opposed to political trials, but
 some extremists, including Czech
 party boss Strougal, have already
 voiced their disappointment that
 Dubcek and others did not indulge
 in self-criticism, and already
 j have exerted pressure on Husak to
 arrest at least some of the 1968
 leaders.   On 1 October the Federal
 Assembly lifted the parliamentary
 immunity of Vaclav Prchlik and
 agreed to a proposal to prosecute
 him.   Prchlik, who had severely
 criticized the Soviet Union last
 year, was expelled both from the
 central committee and the party
 last weekend.
 Husak devoted the major por-
 tion of his speech to describing
 the alleged mistakes of Dubcek and
 other leaders and to discussing
 the events that led up to the in-
 vasion.   He stopped just short
 of justifying the invasion, but
 his speech and the central com-
 mittee resolution condoning the
 invasion doubtless were well re-
 ceived in Moscow.
 Husak's strong attack against
 the regime of former party chief
 Novotny and his statement that
 "old sectarian tendencies" are
 still in evidence indicate that
 he is aware that he still must
 deal with discontented ultracon-
 servatives.   The central commit-
 tee, the Czech party bureau, the
 Czech government, and to a lesser
 extent the federal government are
 now more conservatively oriented.
 Husak also warned that he
 will not tolerate open opposition,
 and he threatened legal measures

 who gained most from the plenum,
 however, was the party's moderate-

 the presidium and was selected to
 be a deputy premier and member of
 the Czech party bureau.
 The Slovak party central
 committee, which began a plenary
 session on 2 October, probably
 will also make personnel changes
 that will redound to the advantage
 of the archconservatives.  As the

 the coming months for a party con-

 it even more difficult to with-

 conservative wing of the party.

 YUGOSLAV REGIME WORRIED OVER BREAKDOWN IN AUTHORITY
 The Yugoslav leadership is se-
 riously concerned about the wide-
 spread disregard by local officials
 for central policy directives and
 is intent on restoring faith in the
 federation's ability to solve Yugo-
 slavia's many problems.   President
 Tito has sharply condemned lack of
 discipline among party members at
 all levels and has threatened a se-
 lective purge.
 The most flagrant challenge to
 central authority occurred last July
 when the Slovenian government bit-
 terly and publicly opposed the de-
 cision of the Federal Executive
 Council  (FEC)  to exclude Slovenian
 road projects from a loan financed
 by the International Reconstruction
 and Development Bank.   Conflicts be-
 tween Yugoslavia's republics are
 commonplace, especially over eco-
 nomic matters.  The Slovenes intro-
 duced a new tactic, however, by mo-
 bilizing an unprecedented wave of
 public protest, and the central re-
 gime felt the heat of this unusual
 political pressure.
 Tito interrupted the summer
 holidays in August and convened the
 party's executive bureau, which re-
 affirmed its confidence in the FEC
 and called for a better performance
 in getting the true facts on contro-
 versial matters before the public.
 The FEC subsequently rejected Slo-
 venia's request for a reversal of
 the road decision.   The Slovenian
 government grudgingly accepted the
 FEC edict, but it is still rankled
 by the affair and has publicly
 blamed FEC bungling for the whole
 problem.
 While the Slovene incident is
 the most celebrated case, national-
 ity excesses have created difficul-
 ties in other sections of the coun-
 try.   In a series of toughly woxded
 speeches along the Dalmatian coast
 in late August, Tito attacked pet
 economic projects in Croatia and
 Serbia.   He severely chastized local
 Communists who ignore party direc-
 tives, and called for more direct
 contact between party and enterprise
 officials.   Since then many party
 organizations have met to discuss
 the "struggle against nationalism,"
 and on 19 September Belgrade's
 party secretary repeated Tito's
 warning of a purge of "negative
 forces" from party ranks.
 The stage is now set for de-
 bates on regional priorities at a
 party presidium session scheduled
 for 14 October and in the Federal
 Assembly, which convened on 30 Sep-
 tember.  Tito is eager to tighten
 the party's control over internal
 affairs by ensuring discipline from
 the center, but he does not want to
 retreat from the liberal course on
 decentralization that he introduced.
 One difficulty of party officials
 is that they are committed to a pol-
 icy of governmental decentralization
 that intrinsically undercuts their
 control.   Local officials tend to
 become regional particularists in
 order to maintain their power and
 because they fear political insta-
 bility if they submit to central ad-
 ministration.   Tito and other na-
 tional leaders understand this, and
 will proceed with caution in any
 cleansing of the party's ranks.

 EC TRADE AGREEMENTS CAUSE CONCERN IN GATT
 The increasing number of
 preferential trade agreements ne-
 gotiated by the European Community
 (EC) is becoming a growing source
 of concern in international trade
 circles.  Many of the contracting
 parties to the General Agreement
 on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT)  feel
 that the arrangements are merely
 an exchange of discriminatory pref-
 erences and do not meet the terms
 of Article 24 of GATT.   This arti-
 cle requires that such agreements
 must lead to the formation of a
 genuine free trade area or customs
 union covering a substantial por-
 tion of the trade involved.
 The Council of Ministers of
 the Community formally approved
 limited association agreements
 with Morocco and Tunisia last July.
 While the agreements fell short
 of the full association with the
 Community that Morocco and Tu-
 nisia had sought, they granted
 significant preferences to the
 exports of the two countries.
 Morocco and Tunisia, in return,
 agreed to grant preferences to a
 number of Community products.   The
 Community has submitted these
 agreements to GATT for considera-
 tion, where they have already met
 with opposition.
 Objections are also likely to
 be raised when the Community con-
 siders general trade agreements
 with Spain and Israel.   The re-
 sumption of negotiations for a
 preferential agreement with Spain
 is apparently near.   In 1962,
 Spain applied for negotiations
 that would lead to full Community
 membership, but its accession has
 been strongly opposed by some
 community members on political
 grounds.   The Spanish, therefore,
 will probably accept for the time
 being a trade arrangement, al-
 though they view it as the first
 ste.? along the road to membership.
 Israel has requested associ-
 ation with the EC, and while agree-
 ment seems distant, there have
 been some signs of movement.
 France has said that it would be
 prepared to negotiate with Israel
 if the principle of negotiating
 similar agreements with Arab coun-
 tries were accepted.   Germany has
 said that it has no objections to
 negotiations with any Arab coun-
 tries requesting them.   Recently,
 Egypt formally requested nego-
 tiations on a preferential trade
 arrangement with the Community.
 Meanwhile, the Community has al-
 ready granted ad hoc preferences
 to citrus imports from Israel as
 well as from Spain.
 Officials in GATT are now pon-
 dering ways to deal with the EC
 cases while preserving the integ-
 rity of GATT.   The assistant sec-
 retary general has said that some-
 thing must be done to reconcile
 the political and economic real-
 ities of the EC cases with the
 provisions of the agreement.   GATT
 is carrying out a general investi-
 gation of nontariff barriers to
 trade, including preferences.
 Moreover, the Organization for Eco-
 nomic Cooperation and Development
 and the UN Conference on Trade and
 Development have been considering
 ways to generalize preferences.       25X1
 Agreement on these matters seems
 to be a long way off, however.

 AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS MIXED IN EASTERN EUROPE
 Weather in Eastern Europe
 has boosted crop yields in south-
 ern countries and reduced those
 in the north compared to those
 of a year ago.   In Poland, Czech-
 oslovakia, and East Germany con-
 sumers will continue to find sev-
 eral types of food in short sup-
 ply this winter.
 Official estimates are not
 yet in, but total grain production
 in Eastern Europe probably will
 approximate the 6 6 7 million met-
 ric ton record output of 1968.
 Unless unforeseen difficulties
 develop, both Romania and Hungary
 may set new grain production rec-
 ords.   Poland, East Germany, and
 Czechoslovakia's grain harvests
 are expected to be the smallest
 in three years, however, and their
 harvests of potatoes and forage
 crops are expected to be down
 sharply.   High prices and short-
 ages of livestock products, es-
 pecially meat, will prevail for
 at least the next six to eight
 months in most East European coun-
 tries.
 Eastern Europe's demand for
 imported grain is expected to ex-
 ceed the 6.1 million tons imported
 last year by 10 to 15 percent.
 This reflects the increased needs
 of the northern countries for
 feed grain.
 Most of the increased grain
 requirements probably will be pur-
 The US
 a so is expected to continue its
 role as a supplier of grain this
 year, but the size of its deliv-
 eries will be dependent on price
 and credit arrangements in the
 competitive market created by
 large free-world grain surpluses.
 The USSR, despite its medio-
 cre harvest, will continue to be
 the major source of imported grain
 for the deficit countries in
 Eastern Europe.   The southern
 East European countries  (including
 Yugoslavia) may have exportable
 surpluses of wheat and corn to-
 taling nearly four million tons.
 These countries will seek to ex-
 port their surpluses to Western
 markets in order to obtain hard
 currency.
 Nevertheless,
 some of the East European sur-
 plus grain producers may be will-
 ing to sell somewhat larger quan-
 tities than usual this year to
 Poland, Czechoslovakia,  and East
 Germany because of the depressed
 Western grain market and possible
 Soviet pressure.

 Israeli aircraft are still flying their almost daily air strikes along the
 cease-fire lines with Egypt and Jordan, particularly against Egyptian forces
 along the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Suez. The strikes seem to be having
 only a limited effect on the Egyptians' intentions to maintain their harass-
 ment along the canal. A rise in the number of fedayeen-caused clashes on the

 the East Ghor Canal, which they had permitted the Jordanians to repair just
 prior to Prime Minister Golda Meir's trip to the US. Mrs. Meir, who was to

 outward calm has returned to the capital. President Micombero's strong

 these two million mulattoes. The antisegregation .Labor Party captured 26 of
 the 40 elective seats. Although the proposed council will have little power,
 the white government is obviously chagrined that pro-apartheid parties did
 not fare better.
 Afro-Asian states may seek a UN General Assembly resolution calling
 for sanctions against South Africa when it fails to withdraw from South-West
 Africa by 4 October in accordance with a Security Council resolution.
 Pretoria, which is not about to pull out, can count on the UK and other
 major trading countries to oppose sanctions and to ignore a resolution even
 if it passes.

 TRIBAL OATHS UNSETTLE KENYA
 For the first time since the
 bloody Mau Mau revolt of the 1950s,
 Kikuyu leaders are exploiting
 traditional tribal oaths in
 swearing their fellow tribesmen
 to absolute loyalty.  The massive
 resurgence of oath-taking cere-
 monies has heightened tribal ten-
 sions in Kenya.
 Although the current pledges
 do not contain the terrorist over-
 tones of those of the Mau Mau,
 Kenya's other tribes see the oath-
 taking as evidence that the Kikuyu
 are determined to maintain their
 pre-eminence.   These tribes inter-
 pret the ceremonies in the con-
 text of long-standing intertribal
 rivalries and also in the light
 of their suspicions that the as-
 sassination last July of Tom
 Mboya, a Luo, was arranged to en-
 sure Kikuyu domination of the
 government.
 The oath-taking began as a
 reaction to the violent anti-
 Kikuyu feeling after Mboya's mur-
 der.                      It has since been organized
 throughout the Kikuyu areas and
 has even extended to neighboring
 tribes.   Although President Ken-
 yatta, as the foremost Kikuyu
 leader, could stop the ceremonies,
 he has not done so.
 As the oathing continues,
 there is danger that relatively
 minor tribal clashes--such as a
 land dispute that flared up last
 month between Kalenjin and Kikuyu
 tribesmen--will spark more seri-
 ous violence.  There is also dan-
 ger of conflict among the Kikuyu
 themselves, many of whom are being
 forced to take the oath.   One Xi-
 kuyu Christian minister was re-
 cently beaten to death for re-
 fusing.
 Some -army officers are be-
 ginning to worry that the oath-
 taking may undermine the effi-
 ciency of the armed forces by
 stirring up tribal rivalries
 within the ranks.   The two top
 army officers, neither of whom
 is a Kikuyu, are known to be
 concerned over the government's
 failure to stop the oathing.
 In an unprecedented action, they
 recently attempted to discourage
 further ceremonies in two areas
 by moving in troops without prior
 government clearance.
 With Kenya's first general
 elections due early next year,
 tribal tensions and the loyalties
 of the security forces will be
 of particular concern both to
 the ruling party and to the per-
 sistent but disorganized opposi-

 INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER VISITS TROUBLED NORTHEAST
 Prime Minister Gandhi encoun-
 tered discordant notes in strategic
 northeast India last week as she
 continued a nationwide tour aimed
 at capitalizing on her recent po-
 litical victories.   Her problems
 stemmed mainly from New Delhi's long
 neglect of the region's economy,  and
 the central government's inability
 to solve a series of long-standing
 and complex political problems in
 the area.
 For the most part, the local
 people reacted with indifference to
 Mrs.   Gandhi's efforts to win support
 by claiming credit for the central
 government's recently inaugurated
 "progressive" policies.   Instead,
 she was pressed for action on a va-
 riety of parochial issues.   In the
 union territory of Manipur, she was
 met with violent demonstrations--
 six people were killed--demanding
 full statehood for the area.   Al-
 though another union territory, Tri-
 pura, received her more cordially,
 she was presented with statehood
 demands there,  too.   In both places,
 she was urged to sort out leadership
 squabbles among local politicians in
 her Congress Party; on 24 September,
 soon after her departure, the weak
 Congress government of Manipur fell
 after a no-confidence vote.
 In Nagaland, where an insurrec-
 tion has been under way for more
 than a decade, state government pol-
 iticians and the faction of the Naga
 underground that now eschews vio-
 lence welcomed her sympathetically,
 but she was unprepared to meet the
 Nagas' demand for negotiations lead-
 ing to independence.   She resorted
 to an old government demand that
 militant Nagas, who have accepted
 help from China and Pakistan, sever
 all foreign ties before further
 political concessions would be
 granted.
 A two-day public tour of Assam
 had to be canceled because of secu-
 rity problems resulting from a mass
 movement demanding the construction
 of a government petroleum refinery
 in the state.   The Indian Government
 believes that the refinery would be
 uneconomic, but local leaders see
 it as both a vital development proj-
 ect                                                             and a symbol of tl,,_central

 In contrast wih Mrs. Gandhi's
 earlier goodwill visits to other
 areas of India, the trip to the
 politically and economically un-
 developed northeast was something
 of a public relations nightmare.
 She was constantly plagued by the
 people's lack of interest in "all-
 India" problems and by their tend-
 ency to evaluate the central gov-
 ernment's worth by its ability to
 solve parochial issues.   The north-
 east problem highlights the strong
 centrifugal forces at work in India--
 forces that Mrs.  Gandhi must deal

 SOMALI PRIME RINISTER EGAL AT TURNING POINT
 Somalia's Prime Minister
 Mohamed Egal, who arrives in the
 US next week for a short visit,
 was confirmed for a second stint
 in office last June.   Since then,
 however, he appears to have lost
 the momentum that produced a num-
 ber of significant accomplishments
 during his first term.
 After taking office in 1967,
 Egal made dramatic progress in
 areas where his predecessors had
 been notably unsuccessful.   His
 efforts at detente with Kenya es-
 tablished a firm foundation for
 relations that previously had
 been nonexistent    He even man-
 aged to improve relations with
 the deeply suspicious Ethiopians.
 Within Somalia, Egal exerted a
 firm hand over the dominant but
 capricious government political
 party, the Somali Youth League,
 and also prevented Sor:aalia's
 tribal-ridden politics from dis-
 rupting his foreign and domestic
 policies.
 Now,  however, despite some
 concessions by both sides,  Egal
 as nearly run out of ways to
 continue prouuctive discussions
 with the Ethiopians.   The two
 countries are stalemated over the
 question of Ethiopia's right to
 tax the livestock of Somali no-
 mads during seasonal migrations.
 Two serious clashes this summer
 in Ethiopia between troops and
 the migrating nomads had serious
 repercussions in northern Somalia
 by undermining Egal's policy of
 urging restraint on the nomads
 l'agv  2 0
 while the governments sought a
 solution.
 Egal's performance in the
 domestic political arena has also
 begun to falter.   His attempts to
 strengthen the central goverment
 by enlarging his authority and
 forging a one-party state--only
 one of the 124 parliamentary dep-
 uties is now outside his party--
 have instead heightened tradi-
 tional Somali distrust of central-
 ized authority.   His blatant sanc-
 tioning of rigged national elfic-
 tions last March,  and the impe,si-
 tion of political controls over
 the police, Supreme Court, and
 the press have strengthened his
 control over the inefficient Pu-
 reaucracy but have made politi-
 cal enemies.  Moreover, the sub-
 sistence economy continues stog-
 nant despite some $400 million
 that Somalia has received in  or-
 eign aid--and sizable additio al
 amounts do not appear in the
 offing.
 Egal is apparently not in
 serious trouble yet despite gkum-
 bling among politicians and o0ca-
 sional rumors of difficulties,be-
 tween him and President Scermirche.
 Nevertheless, although Egal's
 party presents a monolithic a -
 pearance, his control could b,
 weakened by the 60 percent tupnover
 of deputies that took place in
 the national elections.   There
 are a number of important party
 factions and individuals ready
 to maneuver against him when the
 unpredictable Somali parliament
 opens in late October.

 The new Bolivian government, led by General Alfredo Ovando, has
 already set the tone for the immediate future by emphasizing nationalism.
 Continued attacks on "US imperialism" can be expected. The military
 regimes of Brazil, Argentina, and Peru were the first to recognize the new
 government.
 In Brazil, top military commanders, seeking a replacement for President
 Costa e Silva, appear to have selected General Emilio Medici, a close personal
 friend of the President. An announcement of this choice and of the term of
 office seems imminent.
 The cancellation of a proposed 36-hour general strike in Argentina has
 temporarily headed off a serious clash between President Ongania and the
 Peronist-dominated General Labor Confederation.
 In other developments, the Netherlands Antilles may be forced to call
 for new elections unless a government can be formed in the near future.
 Venezuelan guerrillas have staged their most serious attacks in recent
 months; and the Panamanian Government is beginning to focus more atten-
 tion on the canal issue. Although a formal request to resume talks with the
 US has not yet been made, some indication of the government's intentions
 may come to light in pronouncements during the first anniversary of the
 military coup on 11 October.
 Nationalistic noises will also be made by Peruvian President Velasco on
 the 3 October anniversary of last year's military coup and on the 9 October
 anniversary of the take-over of the International Petroleum Company. The
 Latin American foreign ministers, in New York for the opening of the UN
 General Assembly session, held two meetings earlier this week in an effort to
 resolve problems between El Salvador and Honduras but made no prog-

 NEW BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT EMPHASIZES NATIONALISM
 The Ovando government, in-
 stalled following the coup on 26
 September, is seeking to align
 itself ideologically with Peru,
 and is combining exaggerated na-
 tionalism and anti-US sentiment
 at least in part in the hope of
 striking a popular chord with the
 Bolivian public.
 General Alfredo Ovando Can-
 dia seized power and was "named"
 president of the "revolutionary
 government" by the commanders of
 the three armed services.   He then
 named a cabinet of ten civilians
 and five military officers.   The
 civilian component is made up
 almost entirely of strong crit-
 ics of the US and is expected to
 lead the government in a leftist
 and nationalistic direction.
 The early target of the
 anti-US attacks from those in
 and close to the government is
 the US-owned Bolivian Gulf Oil
 Company, and to a lesser extent,
 other US business enterprises.
 Ovando's equivocating statements
 on the Gulf issue have given en-
 couragement to those who want the
 company nationalized.
 ~ Top
 Gulf officials in Bolivia appear
 optimistic that they can reach a
 satisfactory agreement with Ovando,
 but the US Embassy fears that he
 may have difficulty in selling
 to the public a settlement that
 falls short of nationalization.
 Anti-US attacks in the last
 few days have concentrated more
 on areas where there is less
 likelihood of a confrontation
 with the US that could damage
 Bolivia's weak economy.   On 29
 September a major La Paz news-
 paper, apparently with the ap-
 proval of the government, charged
 that the US, through its aid and
 financing policies, was responsible
 for the recent crash of a Boliv-
 ian  airliner which claimed 74
 lives.
 The exaggerated nationalism
 and the anti-US sentiment being
 expressed in La Paz at the pres-
 ent  time is reminiscent of what
 occurred in Peru following the
 military takeover there a year
 ago,   Indeed, General Ovando has
 expressed on several occasions
 his desire to form an "ideological
 confederation" with the military
 government of Peru.   The Peruvians,
 however, have taken a very cau-
 tious attitude toward the new
 Bolivian Government.
 ~~ Peru recognized the new
 Bolivian Government early, but
 the foreign minister has made it
 clear that there are several dif-
 ferences in the Peruvian and Bo-
 livian situations and is quoted
 as saying that the "Peruvian revo-
 lution is not for exort."                  25X1

 POLITICAL PROBLEMS AWAIT NEW BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT
 The administration that re-
 places President Costa e Silva will
 face major political problems.
 Top military officers continue
 to work toward selecting Costa e
 Silva's successor, and General Emi-
 lio Medici has been given the nod.
 The minister of labor and social
 security, Jarbas Passarinho a 49-
 year-old retired army colonel, re-
 portedly will be his running mate.
 A formal announcement of the
 schedule for the President's resig-
 nation and the transfer of power
 to his successor is likely to be
 made very soon.   The governing tri-
 umvirate that assumed power on 31
 August will probably call Congress
 back into session for the first
 time since being suspended last
 December.   The triumvirate itself
 has purged at least nine more fed-
 eral deputies and one senator.   The
 remaining members probably will not
 speak out against any of the new ad-
 ministration's measures because
 they know that if Congress steps
 out of line the military will not
 hesitate to close it again.
 Political discontent is due to
 a number of reasons.  These include
 the purge of public officials, the
 executive's assumption of greater
 authoritarian powers at the cost of
 the legislative  and  judicial
 branches, the unlikely prospects
 that the President and state gov-
 ernors will be popularly elected,
 and the government's limited suc-
 cess in halting serious urban ter-
 rorism despite the adoption of ever
 more drastic punishment.
 Discontent appears to be par-
 ticularly acute in the wealthy state
 of Sao Paulo and in the underdevel-
 oped northeast.   Leading Sao Paulo
 politicians, including Governor
 Sodre, are concerned about the de-
 terioration of relations between
 the government and the public. The
 consulate general reports that lo-
 cal politicians and journalists are
 growing "desperate" about the sit-
 uation, and are convinced that sub-
 version and terrorism will increase
 as long as the country has a mili-
 tary government that is unable to
 generate effective public support.
 The prestigious newspaper 0 Estado
 de Sao Paulo has joined the chorus
 of Uisco:)ntent by severely criticiz-
 ing the government for "destroying
 political institutions."   It also
 warned that the military could lead
 the country into chaos by assuming
 the role of an electoral body.
 The problem in the northeast
 apparently is due primarily to the
 efforts of military officers to weed
 out public officials, rural labor
 leaders, and clergymen whom they
 consider corrupt or subversive.
 ~ The governor
 of Perna  uco State, Nilo Coelho,
 had hoped to form some kind of loose
 alliance with other governors in
 the northeast to resist the mili-
 tary pressure, but they apparently
 could not agree on a united posi-

 CHILEAN MILITARY THINKS
 Discontent in the Chilean armed
 forces over low pay is again increas-
 ing, and opposition political forces
 are capitalizing on the issue for
 their own purposes.
 Rumors that unrest in the tradi-
 tionally apolitical military had
 reached serious levels culminated
 last week in television reports that
 a coup had been quashed during the
 national independence day celebra-
 tions. The late arrival of an army
 contingent at a ceremonial mass and
 the subsequent relief of its com-
 manding officer apparently were the
 basis for the reports.  The imposi-
 tion of stricter security measures
 in response to reports of extremist
 plans to attack army installations
 also helped to spread the rumors.
 Pay at all levels of the armed
 forces is low, and adjustments al-
 T is GETTING SHORTCHANGED
 ways lag substantially behind the
 country's chronic and presently
 rapid inflation. An automatic wage
 increase in September amounted to
 about $3 a month for majors.   Many
 officers complain that the efficacy
 and prestige of the military are
 declining also because of obsolete
 and inadequate equipment, reduced
 recruiting and operational exer-
 cises, and alleged general neglect
 by the Frei government.
 The service chiefs are con-
 cerned over the unrest, but they
 have not persuaded the government,
 which is already hard pressed for
 wage raises by other groups, to ad-
 just military pay.   President Frei's
 uncompromising attitude may indi-
 cate that he wants to bring the is-
 sue to a head.   He has promised to
 give special attention to military
 needs in 1970 pay raises,
 ative Nationalist Party legisla-
 tors unsuccessfully introduced a
 bill to raise military pay 25 per-
 cent.   Both political extremes un-
 doubtedly will continue efforts to
 Marxist political groups and
 newspapers are excoriating the gov-
 ernment for its inattention to:the
 needs of the military and are pub-
 licizing the activities of retired
 military personnel who are trying
 to stir up discontent in the ac-
 tive forces.   In September, conserv-
 ensure their credit rating with the
 armed forces.

 VENEZUELA REACTS TO INCREASED INSURGENCY
 Since 23 September, Communist
 guerrillas have ambushed government
 troops several times and have at-
 tacked numerous military and civil-
 ian installations.   One officer and
 at least four enlisted men have been
 killed so far, and several others
 have been wounded. Most of the in-
 cidents have taken place in eastern
 Venezuela,  the traditional opera-
 tional area of the Castroite Move-
 ment of the Revolutionary Left (MIR).
 The outbreak of guerrilla
 activity is the most serious in
 several months, and may force the
 Caldera government to revise the
 pacification program it insti-
 tuted shortly after taking power
 last March.   The minister of de-
 fense announced early this week
 that the government will have to
 review the program if it can be
 proved that guerrillas freed un-
 der the program were involved in
 the recent incidents.   Under the
 pacification program, the govern-
 ment has held counterinsurgency op-
 erations to a minimum and has of-
 fered amnesty to guerrillas if they
 lay down their arms.   Some guerril-
 las were also freed under the pro-
 gram.   The program has been carried
 out reluctantly, but many officers
 believe that only aggressive opera-
 tions will put an end to the guer-
 rilla problem.
 President Caldera stated last
 week that his government will dis-
 tinguish between aggressive groups
 and those with "similar ideologies
 but which have chosen to struggle
 within the framework of domestic
 institution."  The military is
 greatly disturbed by the upsurge in
 guerrilla activity, which they at-
 tribute partly to the pacification
 problem.   It is unlikely that Presi-
 dent Caldera will prevent the mili-
 tary from pursuing the guerrillas,
 but he will not want to abandon his
 program entirely.
 The recent attacks may be an
 effort by the guerrillas to force
 the government to abandon its paci-
 fication program because they fear
 it is eroding their base of support.
 They probably also want to demon-
 strate their independence of the
 national leaders of the MIR and
 the youth group, both of which seem
 to be considering accepting the gov-
 ernment's offer.
 If the guerrillas acted on
 their own, the leaders of the MIR
 and the youth group will probably
 break with them.   Although this
 would deprive the guerrillas of
 needed logistical support and some
 of their troops, at least the guer-
 rillas would have demonstrated their
 determination to continue with the
 armed struggle.

 GOVERNMENT OF NETHERLANDS ANTILLES STILL IN FLUX
 Interim Minister-President
 Sprockel may be forced to call
 for new elections unless a gov-
 ernment can be formed in the near
 future.
 The deadline of 29 Septem-
 ber for the installation of a
 new administration passed with-
 out results.   The governor asked
 former finance minister Petronia
 to form a government to overcome
 the impasse that resulted when
 no party gained a legislative ma-
 jority in the elections on 5 Sep-
 tember.
 Petronia is the leader of
 the Aruba Patriotic Party, which
 is allied with the Democratic
 Party.     These parties controlled
 the government prior to the elec-
 tions, and with 11 of 22 seats,
 are still in a strong position to
 head a new administration.   Although
 the scattered opposition parties
 might be able to organize a coali-
 tion with the help of the Aruba Pa-
 triotic Party, if it broke its agree-
 ment with the Democrats they prob-
 ably would not be able to hold the
 coalition together for very long.
 The opposition parties prob-
 ably would not want new elections
 because they realize that the Demo-
 cratic Party and the Aruba Patri-
 otic Party would increase their ef-
 forts to secure one more seat. The
 Workers Front reportedly has been
 offered two cabinet posts by the
 Democrats if they join in' a coali-
 tion.   The next few weeks should
 produce a spate of intensive po-
 litical maneuvering.
