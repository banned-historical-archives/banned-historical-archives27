 National Intelligence Daily Cable for Monday May 17, 1976.
 The NID Cable is for the purpose
 of informing senior US officials.
 An article commemorating the tenth anniversary
 of the opening of the Cultural Revolution, published jointly
 yesterday by China's three leading journals, sets forth
 clearly the concerns of leading leftists within the regime
 but stops well short of a call to action against more
 conservative elements associated with former vice premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping.
 The most authoritative pronouncement on the
 current campaign against Teng in a month, the article
 provides an elaborate defense of the necessity for the
 Cultural Revolution itself. This issue remains a bone of
 contention between the leftists, who made their mark during
 the "revolution," and the moderates, many of whom were
 its victims.
 The article links Teng's actions in the early
 stages o     the Cultural Revolution with what it claims were
 similar actions on his part in late 1975 and early 1976.
 Specifically, it accuses Teng of "mustering unrepentant
 capitalist-roaders and putting them in positions of
 power."
 I      _J This is the clearest and most authoritative
 indication that the leftists hope to broaden the campaign,
 to purge party officials who were "rehabilitated" and
 given important posts in the past several years.
 The article, however, also states that the
 so-called capitalist-roaders "hold a very large proportion
 of the party and state power." This admission not only
 indicates that leading regime organs--the Politburo, central
 committee and state council and perhaps the military as
 well--are split, but also strongly suggests that the
 leftists are in a minority.

 Given the conservatives' considerable power  the
 article says, they "could...recruit deserters and
 renegades, form cliques... formulate a revisionist line
 and push it from top to bottom. They could-protect
 their own interests, namely, the interests of 'high
 officials.'"
 This list of horrors clearly describes the
 leftists' fears, but the fact that these and other actions
 open to the conservatives are put in the conditional
 indicates that the left is at present in no position to
 press such charges against their opponents. Indeed, the
 operative paragraphs of the editorial merely call for
 continuing criticism of Teng alone. The leftists
 seem to be making the strongest possible case for their
 viewpoint in the hopes of winning over fence-sitting
 or "neutral" figures in the party and the military.
 //The split at the upper levels of the regime
 appears to be causing increasing problems in the  nrmri nooc
 ur.ing    a anti-Confucius campaign
 of 1974, but it does not begin to approximate that of the
 Cultural Revolution itself. The central authorities continue
 to inveigh against the formation of "fighting groups" and
 against mass movements of activists from place to place--two
 hallmarks of the 1966-68 "revolution."//

 I           Syria is suddenly facing a severe financial setback.
 A temporary suspension of subsidy payments by Saudi Arabia,
 Kuwait, and other Arab donors, the recent cut-off of oil
 pipeline transit payments by Iraq, and increasing costs of
 Syrian involvement in Lebanon have contributed to the present
 squeeze.
 Syria had planned an ambitious domestic spending
 program in 1976--$4.1 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in
 1975--but Damascus can no longer afford the imports needed to
 support even last year's spending level. The government has
 announced that the budget will be slashed to $2.1 billion,
 although this may be a ploy to attract aid from the Saudis.
 Damascus can temporarily avoid slashing imports
 by drawing on its substantial foreign reserves. Reserves now
 equal about two-thirds of a year's imports.
 Syria received some $700 million in Arab grants last
 year, enabling it to increase imports by 30 percent and expand
 its foreign exchange reserves by over $300 million. Saudi
 Arabia alone provided over $500 million in cash.
 I          Aid receipts from Arab oil states so far this
 year       totaled only $25 million. The deficit has been
 aggravated by the loss of $150 million a year in Iraqi transit
 payments which were suspended in December 1975.
 Iraq has also discontinued its sale of light crude
 to the Syrians at concessionary prices, forcing the Asad
 government to search for alternative sources. Saudi Arabia
 will supply Syria with crude oil only at world market prices.
 Syrian operations in Lebanon cost an estimated $750,000 per day.
 The Saudis apparently are withholding their aid to
 try to force Damascus to patch up its bitter quarrel with
 Cairo. The Syrian and Egyptian prime ministers are tentatively
 scheduled to meet next week in Riyadh and a reconciliation
 probably would lead to a resumption of Arab aid.

 I            he annual growth rate in Soviet industrial production
 will be the lowest for the postwar period if it continues at
 its first-quarter rate--4 percent compared with 6.5 percent
 for the same period last year.
 25X1                   his somber picture is reflected in the unusually
 terse first-quarter report published in the press. The figure
 for production of household goods was notably absent. The
 brevity of the report and the cursory mention of productivity
 increases and quality improvements--both hallmarks of the
 present five-year plan--were especially conspicuous for a
 first-quarter report on a new plan.

 The consumer is bearing the brunt of industry's
 mediocre performance. Production of processed food--down
 nearly 7 percent from the first three months of 1975--suffered
 from last year's shortages in agriculture, the effects of
 which are now being felt in the industrial sector. Particularly
 large declines were registered in vegetable oil, meat, and
 canned goods production. A good harvest this fall could
 brighten the agricultural picture somewhat by the end of the
 year, but it would take more than three months to affect
 industrial production.
 I            Soft goods production grew only slightly this year,
 while several products--some fabrics, underwear, and outer
 garments--fell below planned production.
 The growth of machinery production--usually a strength
 in Soviet industrial performance--dropped sharply compared with
 a similar period last year. A critical shortcoming was the
 failure to achieve first-quarter targets for freightcar
 production. A recent Pravda editorial blamed the railroad
 industry for impeding first-quarter production by failing to
 deliver required coal, wood, ores, and industrial parts.
 Instruments and computers, equipment for light industry, and
 motor vehicles also registered significant declines in growth.
 targets for some crucial finished steel items. A shortage
 of hard currency may have forced the Soviets to cancel and
 defer certain steel imports.
 Part of the slowdown in machinery production
 probably can be attributed to failures to meet production

 The materials sector also performed sluggishly. The
 situation would have been even more dismal without slight
 increases in the growth of electricity, oil, and gas.
 Output of crude steel advanced reasonably well but the
 failure to achieve the goal for pig iron production could
 cause some dislocations for individual steel mills as the
 year progresses.
 The decline in growth of chemical production--
 traditionally a pace setter--was surprising. The strain of
 trying to meet 1975 production targets may have drawn down
 inventories in the chemical industry and increased the time
 needed for repairs, producing an adverse effect on production
 overall.
 The poor year for industry is no surprise to the
 Soviet leadership. When the total 1976 production target
 was established last December, the planned growth rate
 was the slowest since World War II. What probably distresses
 the leaders is the number of individual products that did
 not even meet the reduced goals. The outlook for industry for
 1977 would brighten considerably if the 1976 harvest is a
 good one.  If the economic recovery of the West causes
 a rapid increase in Soviet hard-currency earnings, the problems
 of industry would lessen.
 I          The latest cease-fire failed to take hold
 in Beirut over the weekend, but Tripoli--the scene of heavy
 fighting last week between Syrian forces and pro-Iraqi
 elements--was quiet.
 Damascus has withdrawn some of its regular
 forces and Saiqa units from Tripoli, partly in response to a
 demarche from Lebanese Muslim leaders. Syrian-controlled
 Palestine Liberation Army units have reportedly also moved
 out of the city, ostensibly to comply with a withdrawal
 order from Palestine Liberation organization chairman Yasir
 Arafat.

 I                      IThe assassination last week in Paris of General
 Joaquin  enteno, Bolivian ambassador to France, bears a
 marked similarity to the murder of Colonel Ramon Trabal,
 the Uruguayan military attache who was shot in his Paris
 apartment in December 1974.
 Both men had prominent roles in eradicating
 ,
 leftist subversive groups in their own countries before
 being posted to Paris. Trabal served as chief of military
 security in Uruguay and had a primary responsibility for
 planning and directing the campaign against the Tupamaros.
 He reportedly was given a diplomatic assignment at the
 request of army superiors who resented his ambition and
 ability.
 Zenteno achieved international prominence in 1967
 for tracking down and capturing Che Guevara; he later
 became commander in chief of the armed forces--the second
 most powerful position in Bolivia. He went into "golden
 exile" in 1973 following a serious disagreement with
 President Banzer over administrative and political matters.

 In recent major policy speeches, the President
 has shown his intention to reduce leftist influence by
 declaring that the government would curb disruptive strikes
 instigated by leftist unions and that the controversial Tupac
 Amaru Plan, a radical document intended to guide the "second
 stage of the revolution," would be redrafted. Morales
 Bermudez has also given encouragement to the conservative
 business and public sector. He has announced an amnesty for
 political exiles of both the left and right, and said that
 political prisoners would be released. In recent days, 35
 persons have received amnesty or pardon.
 The President is moving to achieve the more open
 political dialogue that he promised some months ago. In a
 speech on April 30, he intimated that a reconciliation with
 the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance was in the offing.
 I                 IThe Alliance is the largest opposition party and
 a long-time virulent opponent of the army. Its leader, Victor
 Raul Haya de la Torre, was obviously pleased with the
 President's gesture. He called on his followers to cooperate
 with the government in overcoming Peru's protracted economic
 crisis. In return, Haya demanded that the government restore
 democratic forms, at least to the extent of holding municipal
 elections.
 IThe Peruvian left, which has strengthened its influence
 in the country since the military took power in 1968, has yet
 to be heard from. Leftist officers have the most to lose from a
 turn to centrist policies and may themselves begin plotting
 against the President. The Communist Party and other leftist
 groups are reported to be unhappy with Morales Bermudez'
 actions, especially with the apparent "opening to the Alliance"
 and the encouragement offered to private enterprise.

 There are other problems ahead for Morales
 Bermudez.'Economic difficulties and the solutions proposed by
 the President will cause severe dissension among the opposing
 sectors and Morales Bermudez' abilities will be severely

 A radio and television address yesterday by General
 Teferi Banti, chairman of Ethiopia's ruling military council,
 on the Eritrean problem was mainly a reiteration of past
 government policy that so far has failed to get the secessionist
 guerrillas to begin negotiations.
 Teferi said the government's program of granting
 regional autonomy throughout the country provided a basis for
 a political settlement of the Eritrean conflict. Government
 leaders have made no attempt to begin negotiations since the
 program was announced in April.
 I           Teferi also offered the guerrillas amnesty and
 sai     a government would allow Eritrean political exiles to
 return home. The guerrillas will probably consider these to
 be "minor" concessions.
 I                    IThe ruling council probably realizes that Teferi's
 statement has little hope of appeasing the guerrillas. The
 military rulers are apparently trying to give the impression
 they have made an attempt to find a peaceful settlement before
 they begin a new offensive in the province. Preparations to
 send a large number of armed peasants to lead the offensive
 reportedly are underway.

 I           Italy's non-Communist parties have reacted either
 negative y or ambivalently to Communist chief Berlinguer's
 speech last week, in which he called for the creation,
 after the election next month, of an emergency government
 consisting of all parties except the neo-fascist.
 Berlinguer's speech was intended to make it
 more  i  icult for the Christian Democrats to focus
 campaign debate on the dangers of Communist entry into the
 government. Berlinguer evidently believes that the emergency
 formula, which could embrace as many as seven ideologically
 diverse parties, will be harder to attack than.the
 Communist - Christian Democratic alliance Berlinguer has been
 calling for since late 1973--the "historic compromise."

 There is a precedent, moreover, for the type of
 government Berlinguer has now proposed. The Communists
 participated in a series of broadly based coalitions prior
 to their expulsion from the government in 1947.
 Berlinguer explained that his proposal is not
 inconsistent with the "historic compromise"--which remains
 the party's long-term strategy. He characterized his
 emergency formula as a temporary alliance to deal with
 immediate problems, but said that it should last "at least
 a few years."
 The Christian Democrats were quick to reject
 er inguer's formula. Over the weekend, the party daily
 carried an editorial approved by Cyristian Democratic
 leader Zaccagnini characterizing the Communist proposal as
 a disguised version of the "historic compromise." The
 Social Democrats and Liberals also rejected the idea.
 I             IThe Republican Party, which has held key economic
 portfolios in recent governments, left its options open.
 It placed only two conditions on a post-election government:
 that it not endanger Italy's security ties with the West
 and that it adopt an incomes policy applied equally to all
 categories of workers.
 I    I The Socialists were obviously thrown off balance by
 Berlinguer's move and have yet to formally take a position.
 They hope for election gains that will reinforce their
 pivotal position between the Communists and Christian
 Democrats and are trying to avoid committing the party in
 advance to any specific government formula.
 I            IThe Socialists cannot reject Berlinguer's idea outright
 ecause they have been calling for some arrangement that
 would give the Communists a formal role in national
 policymaking. It was clear in the Socialists' initial comments
 that they would rather form a Socialist - Christian
 Democratic government committed to consult with the Communists
 than give cabinet posts to Berlinguer's party.
