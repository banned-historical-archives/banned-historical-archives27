 INTERVIEW WITH WILLIAM E. COLBY
 DIRECTOR, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
 Washington, D. C.
 "U.S.News & World Report"                    October 31, 1974
 Q  Mr. Colby, many people around the world question the
 moral right of the CIA to spy on friendly countries, as
 I
 opposed to countries that are potential enemies of the U.S.
 How do you answer that?
 A  It comes right down to the concept of state sovereignty
 and the right of a country to protect itself.  That includes
 the right to carry out such operations in the world as are
 believed necessary for self-protection.  I think that mor l-
 ists over the years have accepted some degree of clandest ne
 work as part of the normal relationship between states.
 any case, is spying any less moral than developing weapon
 systems, or many of the other things that nations do in t eir
 self-interest?
 Q  How do you decide whether to operate in a friendly, or
 neutral, country?
 A  The decision concerning any intelligence operation is
 determined by the answer to four questions:  What is the

 befit being sought?  What is the risk of exposure?  What
 is the impact of exposure?  And how much does it cost?
 In certain situations, you don't have to conduct clan-
 estine operations to get the information you are after.
 o you're foolish if you run the risks and absorb the cost
 of ordering a clandestine mission.  Obviously, in a frien
 country the adverse impact of exposure is going to be very
 eat.  So that is a very negative factor.  But there will
 e some situations in sane parts of the world where a well
 onceived, low-risk operation is necessary to get at some-
 hing terribly important.
 What about covert operations like the one the CIA con-
 ucted in Chile before the overthrow of the Allende regime

 cision that a certain course of action is important in th~
 best interest of this country.  There have been exposures
 before.  The Bay of pigs operation against Cuba, of course.,
 is a notable example.
 Q  Do you, as the Director of the CIA, decide that a cove t
 operation-such as against Chile should be conducted?
 No, these decisions are very carefully structured.  The
 authority for these operations stems from the National
 Security Act.  This says that the CIA will carry out such
 other functions and duties -- beyond the gathering of in-
 telligence -- as the National Security Council may direct
 from time to time.
 Furthermore, we explain to congressional subcommittees
 how we use the funds that are appropriated annually for t
 IA.  We have no secrets as far as these subcommittees are
 concerned.  We answer everything that they ask.  I don't
 escribe each operation but if a member of a subcommittee

 asks what we are doing in any particular country I'll giv
 him a fair picture.
 Q  Who actually makes the decision that a covert operati
 should be undertaken?
 A  The actual operation is approved by a policy committee
 of the National Security Council -- the Forty Committee.
 If there is concern about the situation in some country,
 we go look at it. and see what we could do that would help
 implement national policy.  Then we go up to the Nationale
 Security Council and say, "Here is what we think we can d
 to carry out a general policy of defending ourselves and
 improving our position with regard to that country."  If
 our proposal is approved, we go ahead and carry it out.
 I'm not suggesting that the CIA in any way has been pushed
 or shoved in undertaking actions of this sort.
 Is clandestine activity the major element in CIA activity
 -- even in these days of detente?

 COLBY IVU - 5
 A  To get the answer to that question, we have to stand
 back and examine what United States intelligence includes
 It includes what is called "the Community" -- embracing
 the intelligence services of the Army, Navy and Air Force
 the Defense Intelligence Agency, the FBI, intelligence units
 in State, Treasury and the Atomic Energy Commission.  All
 of these agencies collaborate on the intelligence job.
 fter all, intelligence consists essentially of the collect-
 ion of information -- by overt and covert means -- the ass ss--
 ment of all this information and deriving conclusions and
 judgments about the world from these assessments.
 In 1971, President Nixon said that the Director of Central
 Intelligence should take a leadership role in this whole
 effort.  And I've tried to do this.  Essentially I have
 four jobs.
 One of my jobs is to be head of the intelligence "com-
 munity."                                   I don't have authority over these other agencie
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11 : CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11 : CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1
 COLBY IVU - 6
 but I do have certain influence on them because of my re-
 sponsibility ponsibility to report on what they are doing and other
 powers I have.
 A second job is the running of the Agency -- the CIA.
 Third, I have to be substantively informed about situatio
 around the world so that I can participate in National
 Security Council meetings.  Fourth is the job of acting a
 a kind of public spokesman and handling problems like our
 recent troubles.
 Now, to get back to your question:  By reason of the w
 the "community" is structured, clandestine activity does
 represent a considerable percentage of CIA's activity.
 But   if you measure that against the whole of the intelli~
 "C
 .unity," it's a rather small percentage of the total
 "community" effort.
 Has detente changed the character of your work or redu
 he need for clandestine intelligence?

 A  I wish it would.  If you get to the logical end of
 detente then logically we would have established a relation-
 ship of mutual trust and collaboration in the world with
 the Soviet Union.  This, in turn, would encourage the Soy ets
 and convince them that they ought to be more open with th it
 information.  But that's not the situation now.
 Unfortunately today the Soviet attaches can go to almo t
 any newsstand in this country, pick up a copy of a techni a
 aviation magazine and from it learn a vast amount of deta 1
 about our weapons system.  Unfortunately we have to spend
 hundreds of millions of dollars to get that kind of info
 tion about the Soviet Union.  We couldn't satisfactorily
 fulfill our responsibilities unless we did spend those m
 lions of dollars on clandestine gathering of useful infor
 mation.
 Q  There is growing pressure for the CIA to restrict itself
 to the collection of foreign intelligence such as you've
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11 : CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11: CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1
 ust described, and abandon your covert operations -- that
 is., aiming at the overthrow of governments.  How do you re
 ct to that idea?
 The nation would not collapse if the CIA tonight were
 of permitted to conduct covert operations any longer.  In
 act, because of a change in policy over the years, we do
 onsiderably less of these than we did during the worldwide
 onfrontation with the Soviets and the expansionist drive
 of the Communists in the 1950s.  And we do considerably
 ess than during the period in the '60s when we were deali
 with Communist insurgency and subversion.  The detente has
 ecreased the problem.   Consequently we don't do very much
 e still do some.  But covert actions are a very small per,
 entage of our total effort at the moment.
 Why is it needed at all?
 I think there are a number of situations where a little
 iscreet help to a few friends of the United States or a
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11: CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1

 ittle help to a few people espousing a certain policy or
 rogram in a certain country can enable us to influence a
 ocal situation in a way that may avert a greater crisis i
 he future.  So I think the tool is important to preserve
 o that we can use it if we have to.
 Do you assume that undercover agents from friendly
 ountries are operating in the United States?
 Sure, I do.  The fact is that the FBI has captured a
 umber in the past.  You have to recognize that in dealing
 ith a lot of countries around the world it's accepted tha
 e all engage in this kind of clandestine gathering of in-
 elligence.                                    Nobody gets emotional about it.  It's been g
 ng on since Moses sent a man from each tribe to spy out
 he Land of Canaan.
 There has been some comment that budget cutbacks have
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11 : CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11 : CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1
 hurt intelligence gathering to the point where Secretary
 of State Kissinger goes into talks with the Russians with
 inadequate information.  Is there any truth in that?
 A  We obviously are suffering budgetary pressures from the
 inflation problem.  I think we are still giving a very go
 intelligence product to our Government.  I have great con
 fidence in it.  There have been some things that we have
 turned down because they were totally out of reach in terms
 of financial commitments involved.  These have been in the
 category of things that would have really made our intelli-
 gence more complete but I don't think that it has dropped
 elow a danger line at this point.   I don't think it has im-
 periled our ability to negotiate at the moment.
 However, we do have a problem coming up because of the
 inflationary squeeze as we project ahead a few years.  We've
 tried to respond to this by focusing our effort on the more
 important things and dropping off the thing that we may h  e

 needed in a different world.
 Q Where have you been able to cut back?
 A  Luckily, today we are not required to maintain the sea e
 of effort that we did in past times in Southeast Asia, fo
 example.  Our problems in some of the other parts of the world
 are really a lot more manageable than they were when we
 were deeply concerned about the situation in a large numb (r
 of countries that were under pressure of Communist subver
 sion or insurgency.  The impact on the world balance coul
 have been quite substantially affected if any one country
 had made a very substantial change in political direction
 Today, I think the world balance is a little more stable.
 The real challenge for intelligence is to provide the
 kind of information that enables us to negotiate and enables
 us to anticipate future developments in a lot of countries
 that would be of great importance to us.  Obviously, the
 subject of economics has become important in the past few

 ears.  Twenty years ago -- even 10 years ago -- this was
 largely handled on the side as not much of an intelligence
 problem.  Terrorism has become a problem to us.  The nar-
 otics problem has grown in the past few years.                                   But other
 ituations correspondingly have declined and we've been ab
 to compensate.
 Mr.  Colby, the CIA has been widely criticized for its
 involvement in Watergate
 The CIA did two wrong things in the Watergate affair.
 he first was providing Howard Hunt paraphernalia for use
 n his work for the White House.  The second was making
 vailable to White House employes the psychological profil
 f Daniel E]lsberg.  They weren't earthshaking errors, but
 they were wrong.  We know we shouldn't have done it and we
 ve told our employes that we won't do it again.
 If someone called today from the White House and asked
 he CIA to do something improper, what could you do about

 (Mr. Colby:  Please
 supply date.)
 Well, that's very clear.  In Syr confirmation hearing
 I said that if I was ordered to do some-
 ping improper beyond my authority, I would resign.  That'
 asy.  Also our employes have been instructed that if ther
 is any question at all about anything that they are being
 asked to do they are supposed to come to me.  My contentio
 s that if anybody really tried to misuse the CIA at this
 point the organization would explode from inside.  It real-Ly
 ould.  And that's good because it's the only protection
 e have against this kind of problem.
 Do you operate at all inside the United States?
 We are forbidden by law to engage in any activities af-
 ecting the internal security of this country.                                  That's pre ty
 lear.  Now what do we do inside the United States? We have
 large building up on the Potomac River.  We obviously
 have a lot of employes there.  In order to know something

 about them before we hire them, we conduct security inves
 tigations.  We also make contracts with people around the
 country to supply us with things that we can use in our
 activities abroad.  And we sign contracts for research pr S-
 ects so that we can expand the base of our knowledge.
 We have a service in our Agency that goes around and
 talks to American citizens who may have knowledge of some
 foreign situation that they are willing to share with their
 Government.  We identify ourselves as representatives of
 the CIA and we assure these Americans that they will be pro-
 tected as a source.  But we don't pay them and we don't con-
 duct operations to obtain this kind of intelligence in the
 United States except to the extent that it is provided vo -
 untarily.
 We also have some support structures in this country
 for our work abroad. We have business and other relation-

 We also collect foreign intelligence from foreigners in

 A number of Congressmen complain that there is no effec'-
 ive control over the CIA.  Is there any reason why your
 gency shouldn't be subjected to tighter supervision?
 I think we have responded to Congress's right and desir
 to know about the details of our activities over the years
 in the form that Congress itself has arranged.  Now, the
 rrangements we have with our oversight committee in Con-
 ress is a lot more intense today than in past years.  Twe ty
 ars ago all of this was considered a very secret affair.
 oday it's much more open.  That's the way Congress wants
 it and we are responding.

 Mr. Colby, do you feel the effectiveness of the CIA is
 impaired by all the publicity you've been getting lately
 %bout secret operations?
 Obviously this has raised questions among some of our
 oreign friends about the degree to which we can keep Be-
 rets.  Leading officials of foreign governments who are
 oncerned about this have brought it up in discussions wit
 e.  We have had some individuals who have worked with us
 in various parts of the world who have indicated a disin-
 lination to work with us any longer because of the very
 eal dangers to them of exposure.
 In that respect, we have been hurt a little.  But fr
 like the way our society runs.  I think it is perhaps
 ique that the chief of intelligence has to be exposed, a

 of strength from it.
 How do these leaks affect morale at your agency?
 You have to draw a distinction between leaks that lead
 to criticism of our programs and policies and leaks that
 expose our people.  I think that we can and should stand
 up to the criticism.  But the tendency to expose our people
 can be very difficult and also very dangerous.  You will
 recall Mr. Mitrione,who was killed in Uruguay.  LDan Mit  one,
 a U.S. police official assigned to train police in Uruguay
 as kidnaped and killed by the Tupamaro guerrilla on Aug   t

 He was alleged to have been a CIA officer, which he was n t.

 identified with the CIA.

 A  There are criminal penalties for people who reveal in-
 cane-tax returns or census returns or even cotton statis-
 tics.  But there are no criminal penalties for people who
 reveal the name of an intelligence officer or agent or an
 intelligence secret.  I just think that's wrong.
 I am charged in the National Security Act with the pro
 tection of intelligence sources and methods from unauthor
 ized disclosure.  But the only tool I have is a secrecy
 agreement that we have our people sign as a condition of
 employment.  We have invoked this. agreement against one o
 our ex-employes who wrote a book.  We are currently engag d
 in a battle -- a civil action -- in the courts to determi e
 whether we really can enforce it.  I have made recommenda-
 tions that would make it possible for us to protect Intel
 ligence secrets more effectively.  These recommendations
 would apply only to those of us who voluntarily sign an

 agreement that gives us access to these secrets.
 Q Mr. Colby, can we get back to the question of the nece -
 sity for the United States to maintain a big secret intel-
 ligence operation in an era of detente?
 A  Yes -- I didn't fully reply to that.  I feel it is es-
 sential to the protection of our country, not only in the
 military sense but also in the sense of protecting us aga nst
 the other kinds of problems we face overseas -- economic
 pressures, problems that can start in various parts of th
 world and eventually involve us.  Through our intelligent
 work we are able to anticipate these problems.  For example,
 if you don't know that another country is developing a par-
 ticular threat, you can be caught very badly off base.
 Beyond that, our intelligence work makes it possible t
 engage in negotiations.  The SALT agreement between U.S.
 and Russia on nuclear arms limitation is the most obvious
 example.  Without the knowledge we had of Soviet weapons
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11 : CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/11 : CIA-RDP99-00418R000100100046-1
 through our intelligence activities it would not have bee
 possible for us to negotiate.
 We also have what I would call a peacekeeping role.
 On a number of occasions, we have seen situations develop
 ing in a dangerous manner.  By alerting our Government in
 good time, it has been possible to defuse these situations.
 What part do spy satellites and other forms of modern
 echnology play in your work of collecting intelligence?
 Quite frankly, technical intelligence has revolutionize
 he intelligence business.   You have seen the photographs
 that came out of the U-2 operation over the Soviet Union.
 e now have similar photos on many different areas of the
 orld.  You can realize the great importance of this devel
 pment if you think back to the great debate in 1960 about
 he missile gap.  People took up strong positions on both
 ides and we at the CIA were trying to determine what real
 as happening -- whether a missile gap actually was openin

 ible to have that debate because the facts are known.
 hey are right out there flat and very easy to see.
 This kind of technical intelligence has made the SALT
 agreement possible.  For years we insisted that any arms
 greement would require inspection teams to monitor on the
 round what the Russians were doing.  Given their closed
 ociety, they wouldn't permit it.  That stalled-negotiatio
 or years.  Today we can make an agreement and I can tell
 he President and Congress that we can monitor,it without
 n-site inspection teams.

 COLBY IVU - 23
 of technical intelligence can do the whole job and that
 there is no longer any real need for clandestine agents
 ferreting out information.  Do you agree with that?
 A  Not at all.  It's true that in closed societies like t e
 Soviet Union technical systems can tell us to a great ex-
 tent what is there.  But they can't tell us what is going
 to be there in three or four years' time because of deci-
 sions that are being made in a board room in Moscow today
 They can't tell us the political dynamics of a situation
 and allow us to assess how it is changing.  And they can'
 tell us the intentions of people who may be bent on decei -
 ing us.  Intelligence of this sort can be obtained only
 by what we call "clandestine collection."
 Q  Looking at Russia's intelligence operation -- the KGB  -
 how does it compare with ours in scale and effectiveness?
 A I think Soviet intelligence is going through a change   -
 a good change.  For years the big thrust was on stealing  e-
 crets.                                You remember the atom spies in America and

 COLBY IVU - 24+
 all that sort of thing.  But in the past few years they
 have become more aware of the significance of assessment  -
 the analysis function of intelligence.  They've set up in-
 stitutes to study us, realizing that the facts really are
 easy to obtain in America.  The problem is assessing what
 we might do, which in itself is a terribly complicated and difficult intelligence problem.
 Q  Are you suggesting that the KGB no longer maintains spies
 in this country?
 A  Oh, they do -- sure, they do.  What I am saying is that
 they have moved from total dependence on espionage to greater
 reliance on other sources and other ways of collecting an
 assessing intelligence.  You can only say that's a change
 for the good.
 But the Soviets still run very extensive covert opera-
 tions around the world.                                      In any kind of foreign mission
 they send abroad -- for example, delegations to internati nal

 organizations -- there always will be KGB people or people
 from GRU, their military intelligence.  They also conduct
 a long-term program of training people and putting them i
 place under false identities to stay for many years.  Co]. nel
 Abel was an example of that.  They have the benefit, of
 course, of indirect support from a variety of Communist
 parties around the world.
 Q  The Director of the FBI said the other day that there
 now are so many Soviet spies in America that he is having
 trouble trailing them.  Why do we let so many in?
 A  We let them in as diplomats or in some other capacity.
 You have to realize that there has been a very large increase
 in the number of Soviet citizens in the United States, as
 compared with 10 years ago -- partly a result of detente.
 Now, if you get an increase in Soviet citizens in this
 country you inevitably are going to get an increase in
 Soviet agents because of the role that the intelligence

 apparatus plays in their society.
 You see, in the Soviet Union the intelligence service
 is a very, very powerful institution because of its responsi-
 bilities for internal security as well as foreign intelli
 gence.  They have, in effect, merged the CIA and FBI.  An
 their intelligence service carries a very high degree of
 responsibility for party discipline and public discipline
 Consequently, the KGB has institutional power that is qui e
 a lot stronger than ours.  I'm glad to say that our domes-
 tic influence is far weaker.

 The massive flow of information pouring in to Washingt~,
 requires William Colby, as Director of Intelligence, to m ke
 constant evaluations of fresh global developments bearing
 on U.S. interests.
 The following, in his own words, is the appraisal Mr.
 Colby gave the editors of "U.S.News & World Report" of
 tensions around the world, what they mean, what they cowl
 lead to and the possible impact on the superpowers.
 (space)
 Strategic balance: U.S. vs. Russia.  "The Soviets are
 mbarking on deployment of new missile systems that obvio  -
 y will increase their strategic power considerably.
 But we do not see that in the foreseeable future they
 will have dominance over us.  We have both reached the poi it
 here we can destroy each other and the rest of the world,
 and they know it.

 oviets is a matter of concern.
 "We know that military purposes are a very high priority
 n Soviet decision-making.  We do have procedures that put
 limitations on things of direct military value.  And they
 ave a problem of adapting technology which in our way of
 oing things works because of the competitive system.  That
 is a problem they've got to do some adjusting to.
 "The Soviets are, of course, far behind us technologica ly.
 hey are able to challenge us in arms competition by takin
 much more disciplined approach and putting in their major
 alent -- particularly talent.  One very interesting thing
 is to compare the Soviet military work in space with the
 oviet civilian work in space.  There is an obvious quali-
 ative difference between the two.  The military work is
 uch, much better."

 Detente:  Why Soviets want it.  "There are three main

 reasons for Soviet interest in promoting detente with the
 United States.
 "First, they obviously want to prevent the kind of hor en-
 dous confrontation that is possible in this age of super-
 eapons.  The idea of a military exchange between us is
 just so incredible now that even they realize that something
 has to be done to avoid it.
 "Secondly, they do insist that they be recognized as ore
 of the world's two superpowers and get the status that
 their strength entitles them to.
 "Thirdly, they would like to accelerate their development
 in economic and technical terms, because as they look at
 his enormous power of the West -- America particularly,
 but also the other countries -- they see it moving at a
 tremendous rate and they hope to benefit by a greater degr e
 of exchange and participation in that movement.
 "The Soviet agreement to liberalize emigration policies

 s something that gets very close to the bone on Soviet
 ecisions.  But it obviously was a matter of great imports
 to American policy and had to be handled in some fashion.
 "Generally, the Soviet concern over internal discipline
 is very high.  This is partly a  result of detente.  They
 are a little nervous about what detente can do in terms
 of getting new thoughts and new political drives going
 ithin the Soviet Union.  And they just don't want that t

 freedom of action.
 "The old idea of total Soviet dominance and control is

 Western Europe:  Communist penetration.  "One thing th
 Soviets want to see is Communist participation in the gov-

 "This is in line with Communist ideology which says that

 and that the movement of Communist forces from minority

 "I think there's an increase in Communist Party influe

 But a couple of curves are running:  One is the increase in
 Communist influence and the other is the increased indepe -
 dence of European Communist parties from Moscow's control
 It's really a little premature to tell where these curves
 are going to cross.
 "We are certainly not saying, "It doesn't matter whether
 the Communists participate in power.'  What I'm saying is
 that this is a very complicated, multifactored matter to
 look at.
 "We've seen evidence of various agents the Communists
 have had in NATO-related situations.   If you get a Communi t
 Party participating in a government which is a member of
 TO, you then begin to put political factors into the han -
 ing of intelligence matters -- and suddenly some of these

 Sino-Soviet hostility:  War isn't imminent.  "The Sovi  s
 take a very serious view of China as a danger to them in

 their intelligence about those matters.
 "But I don't see a war starting in the near future, eve

 their naval presence, through their aid programs, through
 their military aid and so forth.  The nature of their pol cy
 right now is to keep that presence active, keep that caps
 bility of influencing the situation.  But at the same time
 they have a considerable interest in continuing the deters e
 program with the United States.
 "The Soviets have indicated that they would go along
 with a Mideast peace settlement in which they played a su -
 stantial role.  A settlement would deprive the Soviets of
 a situation they have been able to exploit -- the Arab-

 remove a danger that the thing might go off the tracks.
