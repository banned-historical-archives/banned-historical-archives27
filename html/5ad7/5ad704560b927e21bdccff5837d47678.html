 SUtRY
 The Kazakh and Kirghiz,Republics are implicitly reminded that Moscow's ideological
 surveillance is not a-sporadic manifestation bait a continuous process.  The
 historians and writers of these SSR's are urged to revise their views of the
 Republics' past, and to bear in mind that the "progressive development" of their
 peoples began with the union with Russia which, incidentally, was "voluntary."
 Criticism of the Ukraine's ideological weaknesses is considerdbly milder in tone.
 The targets of official attack 4ei'e are certain pitfalls in university instruc-
 tion as well as continuing bourgeois nationalist distortions in the field of
 art   3?t}e Crimea, which it will be recalled was "demoted" from an ASSR to an
 ordinary oblast,shortly after the last war, is now to have its ethnic history-
 rewritten.  The new history will "establish" the Slavic origin of the peninsula's
 population and refute the differing views held by Western historians.
 Inadequate utilization of machinOry is admittedly still the principal short-
 coming,in Soviet industry., Strengthening of centralized control (edinonachalie)
 is urged by PRAVDA as a cure-all-for most of the industrial ailments.  Regional
 edito ?ial comment is critical.of the continuing "race" (gonke) for quantity produc-
 tion to the detriment of qualitative indices.

 IDEOLOGICAL-WEAKNESSES
 There is considerably less radio disc fission of ideological failings -than in previous
 months, and the -criticism of that aspect of Soviet life is less, virulent .  A
 number of-items dealing with matters,of ideolog-y .in _the period under .review
 appeared in the press but have not been broadcast.  Discussing education in the
 Rostov Oblast uciversities and technical colleges,'MOLOT (28.May) says that it
 would be "incorrect and harmful" not-to see the grave shortcomings in the work of
 a number of higher:educational institutions.
 In the Novecherka'ssk Polytechnieal-Institute, the Rostov Institute of Railroad
 Engineers, and-several -other institutions the teaching- of specialized subjects is
 said to be "divorced from the realities of life." This favoritd &oviet expression
 applies primarily-toMarxist dialectics.  Since ..every-.academic subject, from
 nuclear fission tto -anc-ient Greek literature, must be taught against-the background
 of Marxism-Lentaism, the failure to adapt~that?,theory 'to -every type of .university
 instruction is variously referred to as "political 'illiteracy", "harmful careless-
 ness" or worse.  To -train large numbers of specialists in various fields, the
 editorial concludes, is .trot enough:  It is,the duty of the higher institutions of
 learning "to givie the Fatherland new cadres of -specialists faithful to the task of
 Lenin and Stalin." That faith, it is implied, can ?be acquired only through a
 profound study of the theory of Lenin and Stalin which is "inseparable"
 (nerazdelima) f -oar airy scientific or technical endeavor.
 The ideological application to the teaching of social sciences is-the subject of
 discussion in a Grigoryan article carried by PRAVDA on 28 Ma:y .fnot-broadcast).
 The guiding-principle 3n the teaching of social -sciences; the author says,
 is to train "Leninists,?1 and, that term implies considerably more than a narrow
 specialization irr any branch of science or technology.  A "Leninist", as defined
 by Grigoryan, is a politico-social activist familiar with the laws of societal
 development -and capable of participating in the political leadership of-the country.
 Talmudism and "Furnc-ritical attitude" (nachetnichestvo), . says the article, still
 characterize the-work-of many Armenian universities and -Institutes.  Thus in the
 Republic's institutes of agriculture, pedagogy and physical culture, the
 ideological end of the work is said-to have been relegated to a secrndary place:
 The basic contrast between 'bovrgeois and pro-
 letarian ideology-and the superiority of the
 Soviet Socialist Regime over that of capitalism
 do not get satisfactory treatment.

 Neudovletvoritelno raskryvayetsya korennaya protivo-

 KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA (29 May) refers in general terms to the favorable effect
 on artistic and literary activities as well as on scientific research in the
 Republic produced by the "intensification of attention"  (boleye napriazhennoye
 vnimanie) to the ideologica' education of the Communists and non-partisans alike.
 The only shortcoming in that work, according to the paper, is that it is "still
 lagging behind the growing demands", in other words, unsatisfactory.  Mass
 ideological and political work should be widely developed "in the homes of the
 people" so that the "remnants of capitalism" in their minds may be eradicated for
 all -time.  There is no further amolification of this point, however.
 The Kazakh Party organizations are responsible for the wrong impression of past
 and present Kazakh life produced by the exhibits in a number of the Republic's
 museums, according to a dispatch by Zemtsov (29 May).  Many museum officials,
 he says, have "glossed over" (nroshli mimo) the fact that the union of the
 Kazakh people with the Russian,- was motivated by their desire to save their native
 land from foreign invaders. All one gathers from viewing the various museum
 exhibits, says the dispatch, is that Kazakhstan was annexed to Russia by an
 imperial decree, and that is a "crude falsification" (grubaya falsif$katsia)
 of an historical event:
 ...concealed from the museum visitors is the his-
 torical fact that the Kazakh people saw in their
 union with Russia the salvation of their native land from
 foreign invaders and a method of overcoming their
 backwardness.
 Russian version:
 ...ot posetiteley muzeya skryt tot istoricheskiy
 fakt, chto kazakhskiy narod v prisoyedinenii k Rosaii
 spravedlivo videl soasenie svoey rodiny of chuzhe-
 zemnykh zakhvatchikov, videl put k preodoleniu svoey
 otstalosti.

 Another serious aberration trom the prevailing ideological line is the failure
 to "explain" that the stru t" (Takoy muzey po sushchestvu lishayet posetiteley
 vozmozhnosti sopostavit radostnnye nastoyashcheye a proklyatym proshlym).
 The Ukraine's ideological deportment is again the object of Moscow's attention
 A long unsigned PRAVDA article under a Kiev dateline (2 June, not broadcast)
 criticizes the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, the Republic's Committee for Arts,
 and the teaching of social sciences in the universities for the painfully slow and

 at times disappointing ideological progress.  Seventy percent of the deputy directors
 of the Academy's scientific-research institutions are said to lack ideological
 and academic training for their jobs.  That, it is claimed, goes a long way towards
 explaining the unsatisfactory research progress achieved in the fields of
 linguistics, history, philosophy, ethnography and others.  The work of the
 Ukrainian Committee for Arts is "still characterized by rude mistakes and
 bourgeois nationalist distortions" despite the strong warning against such
 deviations issued by the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party several
 months ago.  Referring to the low ideological level of university instruction,
 particularly in social sciences, the article points out that among the Republic's
 215 heads of Social Science Departments there is only one Professor and one Doctor
 of Sciences, while none of the heads of the Marxism-Leninism Departments has any
 academic degree at all.  The article is particularly critical of the ideological
 deterioration (ideologicheskoye razlozhenie) that has been noted in the matter of
 training propaganda personnel.  This "most important business" (vazhneysheye
 delo) is said to have been crimin&ily neglected by the Central Committee's
 Denartment of, Agitation and ?'ropaganda.  In 1946, 35% of the Propaganda Department
 managers at the rayon and city Par   Committees were university graduates, but the
 present number of degree-holders is only 21%.
 Socialist competition between Russian and Ukrainian collective farms designed
 to "strengthen the friendship" (kiepit druzhbu) between the two nations has been
 going on for several  years although, for some reason or other, this aspect of
 friendly relations has never been given much publicity.  Referring to the subject
 on 5 June, a special Ukrainian-language broadcast from Poltava indicates that
 Russo-Ukrainian agricultural competition will henceforth be promoted on an
 increasing scale.  As implied in the case of the currently competing "Molotov"
 (Ukraine) and "'Luc'k" (RSFSR) collective farms, the "elder brotbeq - arttitude charac-
 terizing the relations between the two Republics also dominates the friendly competi-
 tion between individual. farms.  Thus in an interview arranged between the leaders
 of the mentioned farms, both Ares mably model kolkhozes, it is emphasized that the
 Ukrainians are far behind their Russian competitors.  For example, the stock
 of cattle in both kolkhozes is "nearly the same" but the 1951 milk yield per
 Russian cow was 4,000 liters whereas the Ukrainian cow was able to produce
 "only half of that."  The interview ends with the Russian livestock farm
 iattager advising the Ukrainian'Kolkhoz to pay more attention to the selection of
 breeding stock in order to increase the milk yields, and the Ukrainian responding
 that "his remark has been accepted as correct."
 C r i m _ _ e a n Hi tmoo Be Re Witt   ,The joint scientific session of the History and
 Philosophy Departments of the Crimean branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences
 recently held at Simferopol, is told that the history of Crimea as currently
 presented is all wrong, according` to a broadcast of 4 June.  The impending
 official change of the peninsula's past was keynoted in Academician Grekov'a
 opening speech which referred darkly to the "grave errors" that have crept into
 the'treatment of this subject.  '-
 The prevailing belief that the Crimea was the original homeland of the Goths,
 Khazars, Genoans, Tartars., and Turks stems from "Marr's scholastic, anti-
 scientific conception in the matter of the Slavs' origin" (skholasticheskaya,
 anti-nauchnaya kontseptsia Marra v"voprosakh etnogeneza slavyan).  The Slavs, it
 is claimed had inhabited the peninsula even before the formation of the Kiev
 Principality, and their cultural influence has since predominated in the life of
 the population.  The reason for this misinterpretation of the true history of
 the Crimea, as pointed out at the session, is that it has always been studied
 and publicized "as something apart" (v otryve) from the history of the Russian
 State.                           A.
 Crimean archeologists studying the country's past are said to have "established
 the presence of Slavs" (ustanovili nalichie slavyan) in that area as far back
 as the Third Century.  The affirmation of bourgeois scientists that a Goth State
 existed on the peninsula at that time is refuted as a pure "invention" (vymysel)

 which unfortunately is reflected also in the works of certain Soviet historians.
 The latter are sharply criticized for "exaggerating the historial role" (preuvelichenie
 istoricheskoy roll) of Byzantium, the Goths and the Tartar Khanate in Crimea.  Those
 people, it is revealed,. were among the aliens who constituted an insignificant
 part of the native Slav population and were quickly assimilated.  (An apparently
 irrelevant item on the session's agenda was Zagorodsky's report proving "with
 concrete documents' /na konkretny1h dokumentakh/ that the Anglo American French
 intervention in Crimea in 1918-1920 was noted for its mass murder and violence).
 The decision adopted by the scientific session calls for a thoroughgoing revision
 of the history of Crimea with a view to eliminating from it "all sorts of distor-
 tions, oversimplification, uncritical approach, and Talmudism", as outlined in
 Stalin's "Marxism and Questions of Linquistics"-.
 In view of the numerous distortions in the history
 of Crimea, the session found it necessary to revise
 the historicei and reference literature published in
 the postwar period, particularly the text books; to
 reconstruct the exhibits of the Crimean museums to
 conform to the new scientific data in the field of
 history, and to devote more attention to the training
 Crimean historians.

 The ideological heterodoxy of Kirghizi SSR is dealt with in a lengthy Lukin
 report to PRAVDA from Frunze (8 line, not broadcast), and is also referred to in
 the paper's editorial of the same date.  The plenary session of the Central
 Committee of the Kirghiz Communist Party, called to review the ideological
 situation in the Republic, is reported to have revealed a variety of heresies
 ranging from the "misinterpretation" of Kirghiz history to underestimation of
 the benefits of Russo-Kirghiz friendship.
 As pointed out by Central Committee Secretary Razzakov and others, the Republic's
 history and literature, as well a' the Kirghiz branch of the Academy of Sciences,
 are in need of a thorough ideological overhauling.  It is disclosed, as was the
 case in the other non-Russian republics, that the "progressive significance"
 (progressivnoye znachenie) of the "voluntary" union of Kirghizia and Russia does
 not get sufficient emphasis in Kirghiz history of literature.  Nor is the life of
 Soviet Kirghizia publicized much in contemporary literature--moat of.it stressing
 the country's prerevolutionary past instead.
 The works of the popular Kirghiz historian Bernshtam are said to be shot through
 with anti-Marxist and anti?Leniniist interpretations.  Thus the 1898 Andizhan
 uprixl ng (against the Russians and other foreigners) is presented as a national-
 liberation movement whereas it was actually of "a reactionary character."  Prevalent
 among the Kirghiz men of letters Is said to be the anti Leniinist "single stream
 theory" (teoria edinogo potoka) according to which all the native bards (akyny)
 and poets of the 19th and early 20th century are portrayed as rbalists-democrats-
 (realisty-d.emolcraty) regardless of their political views and the class nature
 (klassovaya sushchnost) of their work.  Pan-Islamism, pan-Turkism, cosmopolitan
 tendencies.  rI the "underestimation" (nedootsenka) of the role of Russian culture in the
 cultural development of the Kirghiz people are listed among the grave errors for
 which the Academy of Sciences and the Writers Union must assume major responsibility.

 Some of the Academy?s institutes are referred to as "sterile enterprises" (besplodnie
 uchrezhdenia) which ""for years" (godami) have not contributed anything to the
 national economy or culture.  A.g them are the Institutes of Linguistics,
 Literature, and History.  The Kirghiz Writers Union, it is charged, is still
 tolerant of the nationalistic tendencies of some of its members.  Tokombayev's
 novel "The Bloody Years", which is said to contain "elements of pessimism and
 decadence" (elementy pessimizma i upadochnichestva), was republished by the Writers
 Union despite the warning of the Republic?s Fifth Party Congress several years ago.
 True to the pattern of Soviet ideological investigations, the Bureau of the Central
 Committee itself avows penitence for the un-Bolshevik mess in the Republic's affairs.
 It is admitted, for example, that the Committee's secretary Orozaliev was "removed
 from his job".(snyat s raboty) last January for some unnamed ideological heresies.
 The Bureau also left unchallenged the accusation that for a long period of time it
 "had kept secret the decision on the exposure of the bourgeois nationalists" (der-
 zhalo v taine reshenie o razoblacbenii burzhuaznykh natsionalistov) who were active
 in the Academy of Sciences.

 $'             A to           Fi    hasize    In a lecture for the home audience on
 Socialism and Communism (6 July), Prof. Stepanyan speaks of the many ideological
 shortcomings to be eliminated in the transitional stage between the two systems.
 Some of the Soviet scientists, he says, still hold "idealistic and metaphysical
 views" (idealisticheskie i metaphizicheskie vozzrenia) which must be changed.  The
 survivals of capitalism among the population at large are characterized as un-
 Bolshevik attitude toward Socialist property, nationalist and religious prejudices,
 petty bourgeois ethics and an irresponsible attitude toward the family.  It is against
 this "heritage of the past" that the Communist Party is said to be "taking decisive
 measures" (prinimayet reshitelnie'mery).  Although the professor makes no reference
 to the nature of the mentioned measures, his implicit suggestion is that no such
 tactics are to be employed in the fight against religion.  A gingerly approach to
 the question of religion is, it is implied, the correct line since administrative
 measures might do more harm than good,.
 Extreme caution must be exercized in the struggle
 against religious prejudices.  Much harm is being done
 by those who offend religious sentiments in that struggle...
 One must avoid offending the religious sentiments
 of the faithful by crude administrative measures.
 Borotsya a religioznymi predrassadkami nado chrez-
 vychaino ostorozhno.  Mnogo vreda prinosyat te, kotorie
 vnosyat v etu borbu oskorbienie religioznikh chuvstv...
 Nado storonitsya of oskorblenia religioznykh
 chuvsty veruyushchikh grubymi merami administrativnogo
 vozdeistvia.
 Centralized control (edinonachalie--literally, one-man management) of industry
 is, according to PRAVDA (27 May), the basic principle of true Bolshevik economic
 leadership.  Such control, however, is unthinkable without constant and rigid
 supervision over every detail of the job since, according to Stalin, "it is from
 details that great projects emerge" (iz melochey stroyatsia velikie dela).
 Mentioned in this connection are a number of unnamed ministries, trusts, and other
 industrial organizations, but the'Ministry of the Black Metallurgical Industry is
 singled out for editorial censure.  The "low level of management" (nixkiy uroven
 rukovodstva) of the Bakal ore mines, a vital sector of the Ural metal industry, is
 said to be due to the "lax supervision" exercized by the Ministry.  Those mines, it
 is asserted, have been working "unrythmi.cally, with interruptions" (neriimichno, s
 uryvkami) for a long time, and they are considerably behind schedules now and nothing

 is being done about it.  Ore-mining at Bakal would not have deteriorated to its prevent
 condition if the appropriate officials had remembered that "the interests of the State
 are above all else" (interesy gosudarstva prevyshe vsego).
 The key to production success, says RADYANSKA UKRAINA editorially on 28 May, is the
 proper utilization of machinery, that is, to its full capacity.  Discussing
 the progress of the South Ukrainian Canal construction, the paper says that
 the excellent machinery made available for that project is not performing as it
 should because the men behind the machines are not doing their part of the job.
 Cited as a typical example is the Zaporozhye Constructions Administration, one of
 the "leading" building organizations on the South Ukrainian Canal project:  "Half
 of its earthcving machines were idle in April, and graders and scrapers were
 poorly utilized."  Disparaging reft-rence is made also to the organization leaders'
 method of checking the Socialist competition of its workers "on the air" instead of
 by personal supervision.  This, the editorial concludes, is "bureaucratic false-
 hood, not leadership..."
 Inadequate utilization of machinery is also the subject of ZARYA?s editorial
 discussion (28 May).  The reluctance to make full use of the available machinery,
 it is claimed, stems from the tendency to "underrate mechanization" on the part
 of many construction organizations.  there is even evidence of "negligence of
 machines and a scornful attitude toward them."  Insufficient utilization of
 machine capacity has been noted among the oblast blast furnace workers, in ore-
 mining, metal-processing and coke-chemical industries.
 KAZA  STANSKAYA PRAY A (6 June) ce plains that the qualitative indices of the
 Republic's industrial production still leave much to be desired.  Wasteful expendi-
 ture of fuel, electric power, and raw materials as well as "the most unsatisfactory
 use" of technical equipment are regarded as one of the chief,, contributing factors.
 Another and no less important reason for the unspecified industrial failings is
 said to be the "false objective" of obtaining favorable quantitative results at
 the expense of quality.  The net i?&esult of such management, particularly in the
 fishing industry, is that "production plans fail to be fulfilled."
 In a collective letter to Stalin carried on the Home Service on 9 June, Estonian
 industrial management and labor familiarly pledge themselves to "still greater exertions
 for the benefit of their Soci$list' Fatherland" but admit that "considerable short-
 comings" still hamper industrial progress:  "Some industrial Munits fail to fulfill
 the State plan  .produce low-quality goods and permit wastes;
 The "Dead  nu   rr Ra  U Racketeering in Soviet industry, in the Western sense, is
 never discussed on the raddio since' that practice is usually associated with industria-
 lists and business men in capitalist countries.  References to shady machination,
 Soviet style, generally appear in feuiiletons and other humorous press items.
 Ryabov tells the story of the head of the Mozhaisk Industrial Combine Tereshkin,
 now in jail, whose love of money got the better of his industrial talents and
 loyalty to the State.  Learning that a,ypsy caravan (tsyganskiy tabor) had camped
 near the town, Tereshkin decided  to change their nomadic ways of life by assigning
 part of the combine's production to them including the necessary "operating funds"
 which amounted to many thousands of rubles.  The Gypsies, however, decided to leave,
 after a short adventure into settled life, "having departed in an unknown direction"
 (otbyv v neizvestnom napravlenii).  When the prosecuting authorities caught up with
 Tereshkin's activities, it was revealed that the horse-drawn caravan of the
 untrustworthy gypsies, if there were any gypsies, could not be overtaken by the
 Combine's officials who pursued them in automobiles-'if there was any pursuit.
 The close resemblance between Tereshkin?s Gypsies and Gogol's "Dead Souls",
 Ryabov points out, is too bovious to be overlooked.  It was learned after further
 investigation that the "black bourse" (chernaya kassa) that operated within the
 Combine and was known to only a few "select" officials represented more tangible
 evidence than the Gypsy myth, and had something to do with the disappearance of
 State funds.  This black bourse, incidentally, was the repository of funds acquired
 from the illegal production and sales of felt boots (valenki)e and the distributor
 ot? the said funds among the officials making up Tereshkin?s retinue.

 Educatinn faro Childrano  In a lengthy program for children broadcast from Stavropol
 on 6 June, Soviet youngsters are told that the ignorance in which American school
 children are kept is part of a grand design for war on the part of the Truman
 Government.  It is the obvious. aim of that Government, the children are told, "to
 bring up a generation of barbarians" whose reading ability will not extend beyond
 understanding bomber operation instructions, and their mathematics will be limited
 to making artillery calculations.. An unnamed American teacher is quoted as
 having stated that "we must become familiar with the thought that a new world war
 is inevitable."  In primary school text books, the letter "A" is said to appear
 opposite the word "atom", and "B" opposite the word "bomb."
 Russia, the Horne of the Auto:  The first "self-moving", four-seater carriage was
 built by an unnamed Russian serf "as early as 200 years ago", according to an
 anonymous talk heard on the Home Service-on 7 June.  It is also asserted that the
 first two-stroke internal combustion engine was constructed by a Russian scientist
 in 1879.

 Amid persistent boasts of production gains, two anxieties are apparent:  the "temporary
 stagnation of trade," and a shortage of capable personnel loyal to the regime.  In
 addition to State processing contracts, other methods being employed to revive trade
 are exchange conferences and loans to speculators who will purchase native
 products.  Great success is claimed for the trade conferences, despite certain
 "unenlightened attitudes," such as a desire of trade delegations to sell but not buy,
 and the determination of peasants to obtain satisfactory prices for their goods.
 As for the so-called labor shortage, since armies of "unemployed" are being given
 relief work, obviously it is a shortage of capability.  Perhaps one reason for the
 personnel problem is seen in the admission that "knowledge and experience" have
 been discarded as a basis for promotion.
 Both the tendency to rely on the Soviet and the weakness of this dependence are
 apparent in a report that FFikien Ftovince is now sending to Russia some of the
 goods formerly shipped to Hong K0 g, but must depend on the domestic market to
 absorb "most of it."  Direct Russian influence also is seen in connection with
 the Chinchiang flood.control project.  To boost morale there, Mao Tse-tung
 sent a personal gift, presented by the Minister of Conservancy himself, accompanied
 by the "Soviet adviser to the Ministry."  A Russian adviser also appeared when
 dispatchers on the Chinese-Changchun Railway proved "conservative" and refused to
 adopt "new ways," which of course were Soviet methods.
 In the Northeast, drought is feared, and in Kiangsi much land is idle, partly
 because farmers have been arrested, leaving their families with no labor and no
 money.  Szechwan grain levies were out 20 percent because of poor crops, while
 some Szechwan farmers went on strike because their production quotas were impossibly
 high.  They knew they faced censure in any case.
 Teachers are singled out as needing thought reform, as some possess the capitalistic
 attitude that allows them to "undergo thought reform without reforming their thoughts."
 Also disappointing is the slowness.of the workers to grasp the significance of
 the demarcation separating them from the capitalist class, for only after they
 absorb this ideal can the dictatorship of the proletariat lead the national
 construction.
