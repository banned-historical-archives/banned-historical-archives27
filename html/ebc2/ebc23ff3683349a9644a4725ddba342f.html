 and
 (8) The treaty would diminish our ca-

 technology.
 What the Preparedness Subcommittee is
 particularly concerned with is preservation
 of U.S. nuclear superiority in the cold war.
 In fact, this superiority must be of an over-
 whelming nature, not only to our satisfac-
 tion but also in the judgment of the U.S.S.R.,
 especially in view of the fact that our lead-
 ers have made it known to the world that
 we will accept the first blow in the nuclear
 exchange.  All our plans are bottomed on
 the idea that we will be able to absorb the
 U.S.S.R.'s first strike capability, and then
 retaliate with enough power to destroy the
 enemy and win the war.
 Since we hava? spotted the enemy the first
 strike, we must be absolutely certain that
 we can indeed absorb the first blow, and have
 left enough strategic nuclear weapons to
 win.  The Soviets, therefore, don't need to
 test as much as we to ascertain weapons
 effects. In addition, they may have already
 learned enough to exploit our vulnerabilities
 so as to neutralize our second strike capa-
 bilities in underground ICBM's and in under-
 water Polaris missiles, to such an extent that
 they can win in a nuclear exchange or that
 they can demand U.S. surrender.  There is
 deep concern that the Soviet superbomb
 either has, or shortly will have, the capa-
 bility to neutralize many or most of our
 underground missiles, and that the already
 deployed Soviet antiballistic missile system
 may be able to stop U.S. retaliation by Po-
 laris missiles.
 For these reasons-and r can think of
 nothing more important than national se-
 curity considerations-I am opposing this
 treaty, even though I realize that to refuse
 to ratify the treaty, since it was signed with-
 out the advice of the Senate, may cause
 some international repercussions.  However,
 I share the view of Dr. Edward Teller when
 he warned that "if you reject the treaty this
 will be a small mistake.  *  * * If you ratify
 this treaty, I think you will have committed
 an  enormously bigger     mistake. * * * You
 will have given away the future safety of this
 country."

 rent military relationship with the Russians.
 In fact, the most damaging testimony of all
 was that given by Secretary of Defense
 McNamara himself, who was testifying for
 the treaty.  McNamara's testimony, however,
 reveals serious contradictions and unwar-
 ranted assumptions by the Defense Depart-
 ment and the administration concerning our
 national   defenses  in   relation   to   the
 Communists.
 Even beyond these considerations, how-
 ever, is the more obvious facts of life con-
 cerning dealing with the Communists who
 have continuously proclaimed that deceit is
 the foundation of Communist policy.  The
 hypocrisy of the Soviet position and the en-
 tire concept of the treaty of Moscow and the
 theories of disarmament are exposed in an
 amendment to the treaty offered by Senator
 BARRY GOLDWATER.
 The Goldwater amendment says, "the ef-
 fectiveness of the treaty will be deferred until
 the U.S.S.R. has removed all nuclear weap-
 ons, all weapons capable of carrying nuclear
 warheads, and all military, technical per-
 sonnel from Cuba and until arrangements
 .have been made for the international in-
 spection within Cuba to determine and con-
 firm such removal."
 The treaty of Moscow-or test ban treaty-
 has been described by President Kennedy as
 the "first step toward peace."
 GOLDWATER  exposed the fantasy of this
 statement when he said, "This proposed test
 ban treaty cannot be a first step toward
 peace If it must stumble over Soviet mis-
 siles and troops in Cuba."
 For over 17 years the Communists have
 followed an unrelenting course dedicated to
 the destruction of the United States.  For
 this country to consider disarming or letting
 down our guard even slightly without some
 tangible evidence of change In the Soviet
 policy will be national suicide.
 KGAF feels that if the treaty of Moscow
 is to be considered at all, it must have the
 'Goldwater amendment as a basic protection
 of our survival.  We urge that you wire or
 write your Senators today calling upon them
 to insist upon the addition of the Goldwater
 amendment to the test ban treaty.
 The opinion expressed In this editorial is
 the view of KGAF Radio, not necessarily the
 view of any advertiser.  KGAF Radio will
 provide equal time for opposing views upon
 request by a qualified spokesman.
 ADVISE AND CONSENT-A TEST OF COURAGE
 (By Thomas A. Lane, major general,
 U.S. Army, retired)
 acceptance of the Presidential judgment.
 They must weigh carefully the full impact
 of the treaty military, political and spirit-
 ual. If they find it to be against the inter-
 est of the United States, they must have
 the courage to reject it.
 Free peoples are in a race with the Com-
 munist  powers  for the  dominion  of  the
 world. Unhappily, we run not so as to win
 the prize, but so as to withdraw from the
 race. To foster illusion in our peoples, we
 pretend that we can avoid the contest.
 It began with President Eisenhower who,
 to appease a popular desire, suspended our
 testing program without  adequate  safe-
 guards.   We  stopped  running  while                                                                            the
 Soviet Union forged ahead.
 President Kennedy continued the volun-
 tary ban without making preparations for
 its violation by the Soviet Union. When the
 Soviets were ready, they tested; and the scope
 and magnitude of their tests amazed the
 world.  The United States was caught flat-
 footed, unprepared.
 The Soviet tests challenged us to a vigor-
 ous program to overcome the handicap which
 negligence and bad judgment had imposed
 on us.  What was our response?  We have
 striven not to overcome the handicap but to
 perpetuate it.  We have had no program of-
 testing to bring our knowledge of nuclear
 weapons abreast of Soviet knowledge.  We
 have  been fearful  that aggressive testing
 would jeopardize our negotiations for a test
 ban, so we have conceded the Soviet supe-
 riority.
 Since 1946, the United States has been
 urging atomic arms control under adequate
 inspection.  Refusal of the Soviet Union to
 accept inspection, even when it was far be-
 hind in. the race, reflects the Communist
 determination to prevail.  Khrushchev is not
 withdrawing from the race.
 The United States, in contrast, has frit-
 tered away its nuclear leadership in vain
 peace seeking which can only spur the Com-
 munist confidence in ultimate victory.  If it
 now abandons the standards of positive in-
 spection which are the only adequate safe-
 guard of treaty compliance in a matter as
 vital as nuclear weapons development, it in-
 vites its own destruction.
 The Moscow test ban treaty prohibits test-
 ing, without Inspection, of small atmospheric
 blasts which we cannot detect and which are
 important  to  nuclear progress.   Will  the
 United States voluntarily impose this limita-
 tion on itself and trust the Soviet Union to
 do the same?
 Our Senators are called to vote. Will they
 give the seal of their approval to a policy of
 granting  concessions  to communism, and
 thereby assure its continuance?    Will they
 reject the treaty and call upon the Soviet
 Union to accept full inspection of nuclear
 activities?    Will  they  attach  protective
 clauses to the treaty to limit the ban to
 testing which can be positively identified
 without inspection at the testing site? Each
 Senator must decide for himself and for our
 country.

 A FAREWELL TO ARMS?
 embrace a threat to this Nation's defense
 which goes far beyond the particulars of the
 treaty itself,
 The American people are being spoon fed
 with soothing sirup which plays up the sup-
 posed benefits to accrue from the treaty and
 plays down the hazards to national security.
 Prominent politicians in both parties are
 swallowing the same sirup that they are la-
 dling out to the public.
 Only a handful of courageous spokesmen,
 mostly  Southerners,  are  challenging  the
 bland promises and unsupported assurances
 that the treaty is in the national interest.
 But, little by little, the people are beginning
 to  develop  that  genuine concern    which
 should  accompany     any  proposal   which
 could  even  possibly,  jeopardize national
 security.
 With this awakening on the public's part,
 there is a corresponding rush in Washington
 to hasten the vote on the treaty.  The Presi-
 dent himself is launching a crash program to
 gain early ratification by the Senate, before
 any groundswell of opposition from the folks
 back home can influence the outcome of the
 vote.   .
 The Kennedy administration already has
 subscribed  to  the  treaty.  Now,  only  the
 U.S. Senate stands between the American
 Nation, along with Russia and Great Britain,
 party to an agreement embodying these omi-
 nous words:
 "Proclaiming as their principal aim the
 speediest possible achievement of an agree-
 ment on general and complete disarmament
 under gtrict international control in accord-
 ance with the objectives of the United Na-
 tions which would put an end to the arma-
 ments race and- eliminate the testing of all
 kinds of weapons, including nuclear weap.-
 The Federal Government already has vir-
 tually abolished the sovereignty of the indi-
 vidual American States.  Are we now to sur-
 render the sovereignty of the United States
 itself?
 THE  BREwssw  GULCH  PHmososusR  SAYS--
 (By Fred McKinney)        -
 The test ban treaty between Russia, Great
 Britain and this country won't become ef-
 fective until the United States ratifies it.
 President Kennedy, urges its ratification as
 the "first step toward peace," but the Sen-
 ate is giving thematter considerable study
 before making this important deal with our
 enemy in the cold war, one who has proved
 treacherous in the past.  He has said that
 he would bury us, and probably some Sen-
 ators believe that this treaty is a step in
 that direction along with other steps that
 may be expected to follow. In the meantime,
 many other members of the U.N., mostly the
 smaller ones, have signed.           -
 None of them, as far as we know, have
 bombs and they couldn't do any testing even
 if they wanted to. This is a reminder of the
 story of the hunter and the bear.  As the
 hunter was about to shoot, the bear said,
 "What is it you want?"  The hunter said, "I
 want a fur coat."  The bear said, "I am hun-
 gry, I want a full stomach.  Let's talk it over,
 let's negotiate."  The hunter laid down his
 rifle and after a while the bear got up and
 walked away.  He had a full stomach and the
 hunter had his wish, he had a fur coat.
 Could this be a case of history repeating
 itself?
 WAsmNOToN.-The Senate of the United
 States is  not called often to exercise Its
 power to approve or reject treaties.  Even
 more rarely is it called to pass upon an
 agreement negotiated without prior consul-
 tation with the Senate leadership.  As the
 Democrats used to say to President Eisen-
 hower, "if we are going to be in on the
 crash landings, we want to be in on the
 takeoffs."
 In the test ban treaty, the Senators face
 a serious question of national security.  Un-
 der compulsive pressures to make some head-
 way in disarmament and serve domestic po-
 litical considerations in the United States
 and Britain, our representatives have exe-
 cuted an agreement which is plainly advan-
 tageous to the Soviet Union.
 The dangers of the treaty- have been clear-
 ly marked. by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.              By
 accepting the  judgment of the President
 that the political advantages outweigh the
 risks taken, the Joint Chiefs and others who
 are not responsible for political judgments
 have  brought  themselves  to  accept  the
 treaty.
 The Senators cannot so easily avoid re-
 sponsibility.                           The  Constitution  requires
 their solemn judgment of the issue and this
 responsibility will not be served by mere
 Do  we  want  complete  disarmament  of
 the United States--under the supervision of
 some international agency?
 The State finds no evidence of any such
 thinking on the part of South Carolinians
 or of other patriotic Americans.  But com-
 plete disarmament and international control
 are the ultimate objectives of the nuclear
 test ban treaty now being considered in the
 Senate.                     -           -
 This is no speculative assertion on our
 part: It is spelled out in exact language in
 the preamble of the treaty itself.  Somehow,
 in both the political and public debate over
 the treaty, little attention has been paid-to
 that preamble, but those preliminary words

 adm Fiietration alas all but mar,eVvered tkle                 (By Bill Henry)
 couriry    represents a first step    toward
 -tie theory defined above.     As we watch Members of the Senate of the
 power, we are now encouraged to believe
 that between M4rch and August of this year
 the Communist      have experienced a com-
 plete change o                            viewpoint, that the tiger
 held at bay by the sight of a gun has now
 become a tame kitten anxious, only to lap
 up milk from a'dish.
 I.istory tells us that where Communists
 are 8oneerned,     ere is no such thing as
 maintaining a status quo.  The late F.D.R.
 made concessions at Yalta that placed mil-
 lions of unoffending people behind the Iron
 Curtain.  He did so under the impression
 he could charm Joe Stalin into being good.
 Out of the fateful concessions made there
 many of our current cold war troubles grew.
 A few years later, at the urging. of the late
 George Catlett Marshall, President Truman
 forced upon the Nationalist Chinese a coali-
 tion with the Chinese Communists.  It was
 not long before the Reds owned the govern-
 ment and Chiang Kai-shek's forces had to
 flee to Formosa.
 In the Korean' war, American forces were
 under orders not to win.  It was forbidden
 to attack the enemy beyond the Yalu River
 where were located the staging areas for
 enemy forces.  At the end of an inconclusive
 truce, we are still, 10 years later, wrestling
 with, the problem of keeping South Korea
 both non-Communist and free.
 An arrangement made by the British with
 the Russians to safeguard the neutrality of
 Laos has collapsed by reason of Communist
 failure to keep commitments publicly made.
 We continue to wrestle not only with the
 troubles of Laos, but with increasing prob-
 lems in South Vietnam.
 Following what was made to appear to be
 a bold confrontation of Khrushchev on the
 issue of removing missiles from Cuba, we
 have subsequently acquiesced to the perma-
 nent occupation of that country 90 miles
 from our shores, and, indeed, have consti-
 tuted the Castro, regime as a protectorate.
 We have listed a few outstanding examples
 of attempting to maintain a status quo posi-
 tion with the Communists and now it ap-
 pears they are ready to try it again.  We are
 abandoning the axiom that the only thing
 Communists recognize is force and are once
 more adopting, in this proposed treaty, the
 historically discredited theory that Commu-
 nists are susceptible to reason and considera-
 tions of honor and conscience.
 Furthermore, we are about to take this
 step in the face of a statement issued by the
 Senate Armed  Services Preparedness Sub-
 committee which confirms the view that
 treaty ratification will make permanent our
 inferior position with respect to military
 power.
 After hearing the testimony of 21 military
 and scientific witnesses, the majority of this
 committee reported as follows:
 "The Soviets have overtaken and sur-
 passed us in the design of very high yield
 nuclear weapons;
 "That  they 'may  possess  knowledge  of
 weapons effects and antiballistic missile pro-
 grams superior to ours;
 "That under the terms of the tr'eaty it is
 entirely possible that they will draw even
 with us in low yield weapons technology.
 "These things are no ground for compla-
 cency. We believe very strongly that Soviet
 secrecy and duplicity require that this Na-
 tion possess a substantial margin of superi-
 ority in both the quality and the quantity of
 its implements of war."
 CONGRESSIONAL RE qRI   ,   LATE
 sciences this week as they prepare to vote on
 the test ban treaty, trying to disagree in
 some cases witho_utheing disagreeable, we're
 eying a strange situation.  Here's a treaty
 Which nobody is sure about, one regarding
 which even its most strenuous advocates can
 advance only the faintest of praise, yet one
 virtually pertain to be passed by a large ma-
 jority.  It will be approved largely because
 it will certainly contribute to the peace of
 mind of a lot of people.  Everyone hopes it
 may lead to a better world.  But the exist-
 ence of the free world is at stake also.  Un-
 fortunately, while everyone seems to have a
 strong opinion on the subject, these opin-
 ions are not based on sound fact or knowl-
 edge.   The real truth about the test ban
 treaty is that everyone concerned, from Pres-
 ident Kennedy down to the least informed
 of  us private  citizens,  is really taking  a
 chance.  President Kennedy, who advocates
 it and regards it as a sort of peak of accom-
 plishment, doesn't really know what it por-
 tends.  He is neither a scientist capable of
 judging the real value of testing in the at-
 mosphere, nor a military expert cable of
 measuring the treaty's possible consequences
 on our future ability to survive.  It is quite
 true that the best scientific and military
 advice is available to him but the fact is
 that there is vital disagreement among both
 the scientists and the military.  The only
 place where there is unanimity is in the per-
 fectly human hope for peace, or at least for
 a lessening of tension.   That's just about
 universal.  Unfortunately it is a feeling based
 entirely on emotion.   It is not based either
 on knowledge of facts or judgment of con-
 sequences.
 THEY ALL HAVE RESERVATIONS
 The truth of the matter is that you can't
 find anybody on our side whose judgment is
 worthy of consideration, who wholeheartedly
 regards the test ban treaty as a good thing.
 The best that even the President will say
 for it is that it is a "small first step in the
 right direction."  He, and others who advo-
 cate its approval on this ground, say that
 this is their judgment.  Actually, it is just
 their hope.  The scientific side of this ques-
 tion is far too intricate for any layman to
 assess it sensibly. Furthermore, the scien-
 tific people themselves are sharply divided.
 It is all very well to say that Edward Teller's
 opinion against approval is offset by the
 opinions of other scientists who are for it.
 This may be true, but most of us remember
 that a lot of the finest of the scientists were
 convinced that Teller was wrong when he
 said that we could and should develop the
 H-bomb.   They said it couldn't be done.
 Teller was right.  That's grounds for believ-
 ing that he might be right this time, too.
 PEACE OF MIND VERSUS SURVIVAL
 The most disturbing factor in the argu-
 ment is the uneasiness of the people whose
 lives and careers are devoted to our country's
 survival.  Not a single defense expert has
 come                   out wholeheartedly in favor of the _
 treaty.                The best any of them has given is a
 yes-but.   The most enthusiastic of them
 merely says that "the benefits outweigh the
 drawbacks."  All base what approval  they
 are willing to give on the fact that the treaty
 has  "political  advantages."  A good share
 say they would have opposed it if it hadn't
 already    been signed.  General  Power, on
 whom  the actual nuclear defense  of our
 country largely rests, is flatly opposed to it.
 The Senators already opposed to it are largely
 16161,1
 those closest to our national defense.  So
 just remember that the men who are ap-
 proaching this very vital decision are inter-
 ested in, and responsible for, not only our
 peace of mind, but our national survival.
 MEET THE PRESS-AMERICA'S PRESS CONFER-
 ENCE  OF  THE  AIR,  SUNDAY,  SEPTEMBER  1,
 1963
 Produced by Lawrence E. Spivak.
 Guest: Dr. Edward Teller.
 Panel: John Finney, the New York Times;
 Peter Hackes, NBC News; and R. H. Shack-
 ford, Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance.
 Moderator: Ned Brooks.
 Mr. BROOKS. This Is Ned Brooks, inviting
 you to Meet the Press.  Last Thursday the
 Senate  Foreign  Relations  Committee  ap-
 proved a test ban treaty overwhelmingly.                                                                                                                                          It
 now goes to the Senate floor for debate and
 vote.
 Our guest today on Meet the Press is the
 treaty's leading opponent, Dr. Edward Teller,
 one of the world's outstanding nuclear scien-
 tists, who has urged the treaty's defeat in
 public and secret testimony before the Senate
 committees.
 Dr. Teller was the key man in the fight for
 and the development of the H-bomb.  He is
 a physicist at the University of California.
 We will have the first question from Law-
 rence E. Spivak, permanent member of the
 Meet the Press panel.
 Mr. SPIVAK. Dr. Teller, you have been quot-
 ed as saying about the test ban treaty: "if
 it is ratified, you will be giving away the
 safety of this country, and you will have in-
 creased the dangers of war."
 President Kennedy has decided that ratify-
 ing the treaty will not endanger our security.
 Do you think you and the President are
 reaching opposite conclusions from the same
 set of facts?
 Dr. TELLER. I believe so.  It seems obvious
 than an agreement should lead toward peace.
 Peace is the question of overriding impor-
 tance.                                                                                                                                    In that, I agree.          But this  treaty
 will-in my opinion, weaken the United States.
 Weakness will make it harder for us to pre-
 serve the peace.  It is our strength that is
 preserving the peace in our dangerous world.
 It is because of my desire for peace, for
 the same reason for which the President
 and so many other excellent people are urg-
 ing ratification of the treaty-it is strangely
 enough for this same reason, for peace, that
 I argue that this treaty must not be ratified.
 Mr. SPIVAK. Dr. Teller, may I come back to
 my question?  Do you have access to all the
 scientific and intelligence information avail-
 able to the President, so that you can come
 to a conclusion from the same set of facts?
 Dr. TELLER. No two people ever know the
 same facts.  In the scientific field, in the
 military field, I have been worried about this
 question for almost a quarter of a century
 now.  I have become very familiar with it,
 and I have learned that gften I have to
 change my mind.  In that  field  I  think
 I have a little competence.
 On the intelligence information, I do not
 know all the facts, and the President does,
 but I do know that in the intelligence field
 we have made in the past many mistakes.
 Mr.  SPIVAK. Dr.  Teller,  the  thing  that
 bothers a great many people, as I am sure
 you know, the heads of the Air Force, the
 Army, the Navy, the Marines, are united in
 their support of the limited test ban agree-
 ment, provided security safeguards are guar-
 anteed, which the President says he is going
 to put into effect.
 Are there any safeguards which would con-
 vince                                                                                                                                    you  that  this  treaty  ought  to  be
 ratified?
 Dr.  TELLER. I think this treaty limits

 what would satisfy you in the field of test-

 were defeated, how many tests, and how long
 these should go on?
 Dr. TELLER. I don't want bigger explosives.
 I do want knowledge, knowledge that comes
 from testing, knowledge to be applied for
 our defense, knowledge to be applied for the
 peaceful use of nuclear exposives.  In the
 way of increasing this badly needed knowl-
 edge, I think the more we have the better,
 and we can do it cleanly and without dis-
 turbing anybody in any serious sense, As
 far as knowledge is concerned, more and
 more will be needed.
 Mr. HAOKES. You have indicated, Dr. Teller,
 that you feel that the Russians are ahead of
 us in an antimissile weapon.  Do you believe,
 as the Russians have claimed, that they have
 one now, and how extensive is their anti-
 missile system?
 Dr.-TALLER. I _do not know.  I fear that
 they might have the knowledge by which to
 build one now, and I am almost sure that
 none of us really know whether they have
 it or? not.  This is what worries me.
 - Mr. SPIVAK. Dr. Teller, if you were a Sena-
 tor listening to the conflicting testimony
 that has been advanced by distinguished
 scientists and military men, what would
 finally decide you to vote against or for the
 treaty?
 Dr. TELLER. What would decide me to vote
 is my desire for peace and for the safety of
 the United States.  What would decide me
 to vote' is the possibility of opening up a
 real way to cooperate with our allies, to
 make the first step toward the lawful world
 government by the union of all free democ-
 racies.  This is what this treaty inhibits,
 and that, is why I would vote against it if
 I had a vote.
 Mr. BROOKS. I am sorry to interrupt but I

 the area of high yield experience, listed these
 eight disadvantages which are expected to
 stem from our involvement in a test ban
 treaty:
 1. We will probably be unable to duplicate
 Soviet achievements in the technology of
 high yield weapons.
 2. We cannot acquire needed data on the
 effects of high yield nuclear explosions in the
 atmosphere.
 3. We would be unable to develop high
 altitude data required for the development
 of an antiballistic missile system.
 4. We would find it impossible to predict
 the performance and reliability of our own
 antiballistic  missile  systems  unless  their
 guidance and control systems would be tested
 in the face of nuclear explosions.
 5. We cannot verify the degree to which
 our second-strike missiles in their hardened
 underground sites would be operable in the
 face of high yield enemy strikes against our
 missile sites.
 8. We would be unable to confidently de-
 termine proper design for our nose cones and
 warheads when the enemy opposes them with
 antimissile nuclear explosions.
 7. The testing areas left open by the pend-
 ing treaty would allow the Soviets to gain
 upon the United States in low yield knowl-
 edge while effectively preventing us from
 gaining on them in high yield areas.
 8. By driving Soviet testing below surface
 (assuming Russian compliance)  we would
 deprive ourselves of intelligence data which
 would be available to us from atmospheric
 Soviet tests.

 Proponents of the test ban treaty contend
 .that political considerations carry advantages
 which more than offset the military disad-
 vantages.  But political gains  cannot be
 weighted or predicted with the scientific ac-
 curacy which  can be applied to  military
 weaponry.
 We know that the Soviets are our political
 opponents, with or without a. test ban treaty.
 Our job is to maintain military superiority
 over them.
 Ratification of the test ban treaty may
 make the task impossible.
 TREATY: DR. JOHNSON DISCUSSES
 ISSUES-
 (EDITOR'S NoTE.-The News recently printed
 short discussions by several division mem-
 bers on the treaty for a limited ban on nu-
 clear explosions.                                                                                                                                                                            The subject is discussed at
 greater length in the following article, writ-
 ti.en by Dr. Montgomery H. Johnson, chief
 scientist, Research Laboratory, and one of the
 Nation's leading authorities on nuclear en-
 ergy and theoretical physics.)
 The treaty for a limited ban on nuclear
 explosions has been widely acclaimed as a
 first small step toward peace.  It is really
 a step toward an honorable peace?  Or is it
 a step toward submission to Soviet domina-
 tion?  The answer depends on what we gain
 or lose vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R.
 The U.S.S.R. is a formidable antagonist.
 Starting long after us, her nuclear arms now
 excel ours in the 50-megaton class.  She has
 never yielded an advantage except to a threat
 of force, most recently in Cuba.     She has
 broken numerous treaties.  Therefore, let us
 be  sure  we  understand   what  the  treaty
 means,                             -
 First of all, the treaty is not just a limited
 ban on nuclear testing.  That is a misnomer.
 The treaty specifically prohibits nuclear ex-
 plosions in the atmosphere, underwater, and
 in space for any purpose whatever.  So long
 as the treaty binds us, we cannot use nuclear
 weapons to prevent aggression, to aid our
 allies in Europe, or to dig canals and harbors
 off the territorial United States.  It is essen-
 tial to know exactly the conditions under
 which we are bound by the treaty prohibi-
 tions.  The conditions have not been made
 clear in public discussions.

 LOSSES WE FACE
 In summary, and without embodying such
 allied factors as foreign policy and interna-
 tional  relations,  the  subcommittee  made
 these pertinent statements:
 "1. From the evidence, we are compelled
 to conclude that serious-perhaps even for-
 midable-military and technical disadvan-
 tages to the United States will flow from the
 ratification of the treaty.  At the very least
 it will prevent the United States from pro-
 viding our military forces with the highest
 quality of weapons of which our science and
 technology is capable.
 "2. Any military and technical advantages
 which we will derive from the treaty do not,
 in our judgment, counterbalance or outweigh
 the military and  technical  disadvantages.
 The Soviets will not be similarly inhibited
 in those areas of nuclear weaponry where
 we now deem them to be inferior."
 Incidentally, the matter of arms superiority
 and inferiority is subject to grave question.
 The Senate Foreign Relations  Committee,
 which has come up with a report favoring the
 test ban treaty, reports that "Soviet scien-
 tists presumably are confident that in many
 critical areas of nuclear weaponry they have
 achieved a rough technical parity with the
 United States."
 Such a statement, far from being an argu-
 ment in favor of the treaty, actually should
 argue against ratification.  Senator  STROM
 THURMOND,  in a comprehensive September
 11 speech opposing the treaty, made that
 point clear in voicing this conviction:
 If the Soviets think, rightly or wrongly,
 they have achieved parity with us in nuclear
 weapons, then they have less reason than
 before to be deterred by our own strike capa-
 bility.
 This is especially true since President Ken-
 nedy and other American spokesmen have re-
 peatedly pledged that this country would
 never make a, first strike.  Since we have vol-
 untarily yielded that terrific advatnage to our
 enemies, they can concentrate on plans to
 neutralize our second strike capability with
 their first blow.
 Here is an area in which their, knowledge,
 gained through the testing of high yield,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 ent.  Two examples demonstrate the ineffec-
 tiveness of the rule. In United States v. Van
 Allen, 1961, dismissal was denied under the
 rule although the indictment was not filed
 until the very end of the period of limitations
 and then 6 years elapsed without the case
 being brought to trial.
 In Harlow v. United States, 1962, the in-
 dictment was not filed until 4 years after
 the alleged criminal act occurred and 2 years
 later the case still had not been brought to
 trial.  A Federal 'court dismissed the case
 where there was a delay of 8 years after the
 indictment was returned.  But where the
 delay was only 7 years, all that the court was
 prepared to do was to set the case for imme-
 diate trial.  Certainly the Federal courts
 have thus given a strange meaning to the
 constitutional requirement of a speedy trial.
 Two other measures I have introduced in
 .the 88th Congress will also be of interest to
 your membership, and to all labor organiza-
 tions.  They seek to revise the bonding pro-
 vision of the infamous Landrum-Griffin Act
 of 1959. It will be remembered that the
 1959 act requires an individual bond "for the
 faithful discharge of duties."  In my speech
 against that bill in the fall of 1959, I said of
 the founding provision: "Individual bonding
 would not provide any greater protection to
 union funds.  The same losses would be
 covered, if there were any losses.  But we
 have an implication here of suspicion-that
 we must have some special safeguard with
 regard to a union officer, which is not re-
 quired in the case of a bank president or a
 member of the board of directors of some
 corporation.  They  are  privileged  to  use
 position schedule bonding.  I do not know
 why we single out labor unions and say, 'You
 must have individual bonding.'"
 Of course, the bonding required of union
 officers was also far more expensive.    The
 bond previously  used had  been honesty
 bonds, providing protection against loss by
 reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty. Surety
 companies were required to develop a rate
 structure for the new bond without having
 experience to guide them.  The rates were
 extremely high for the first year and have
 been reduced periodically since.
 Just 14 months ago the Congress enacted
 the 1962 amendments to the Welfare and
 Pension Plans Disclosure Act which provided
 for the bonding of the administrators, of-
 Accra, and employees of employee welfare
 benefit plans and of employee pension plans.
 The two laws overlap.  A sizable number of
 the plans subject to bonding under Lan-
 drum-Griffin were covered by the newly en-
 acted bonding provisions of the Welfare and
 Pension Plans Disclosure Act.  However, by
 this time we had,learned our lesson.  The
 new bonding provisions in the 1962 bill re-
 quired an honesty bond, providing protec-
 tion protection against loss by reason of acts
 of fraud or dishonesty.
 The 1962 law also provided that its provi-
 sions would supersede the' Landrum-Griffin
 provisions to the extent that the two over-
 lapped.
 I think it is long past time to strike the
 remaining application of the 1959 bonding
 provision, and that is what one of my bills
 would do.  It would make the Landrum-
 Griffin law conform to the 1962 Welfare and
 Pension Plans Disclosure Act, insofar as
 bonding requirements are concerned.
 The second of my bonding amendments
 would remove the rigid and inflexible pro-
 vision which enables the bonding companies
 to decide whether an officer or employee of
 a union may function. The language of the
 Landrum-Griffin Act means that arbitrary
 refusal of any bonding company to issue
 bonds would result in an absolute disquali-
 fication of all union officers or employees and
 would have the effect of paralyzing- the
 union.
 Again, the 1962 law was flexible in this re-
 spect.  The Secretary of Labor was given au-

 thority to exempt any plan from the bond-

 ing arrangements would provide adequate
 protection. of the beneficiaries and partici-
 pants.                                                                          So I have proposed to amend Lan-
 drum-Griffin by adding this same language
 from the 1962 law.
 Now all these measures are pending in
 Senate committees.  The first two are in the
 Judiciary Committee, the second two in the
 Labor Committee.  I do not expect that any
 action can be taken on them this year, be-
 cause Congress has done so little that its
 whole normal yearly workload is still piled
 up ahead of it.  In 19 years in the Senate, I
 have never known a session that has done so
 little as this one.  And the big roadblock-
 civil rights-is still' ahead of us.  The Ju-
 diciary Committee in particular does little
 but drag out hearings on civil rights meas-
 ures when enactment of a civil rights bill
 seems imminent.
 But my bills will also be pending next
 year.  If any action is to be taken on them,
 there will have to be a good deal of interest
 expressed among all of American labor.  The
 legislation is there.  Now it needs support
 and backing from all the unions it affects.
 Finally, I want to comment on the most
 recent labor legislation on which Congress
 has acted, the railway arbitration law.  As
 many of you know, I believe that the first
 plan proposed by President Kennedy to sub-
 mit the work rules issue to the Interstate
 Commerce Committee was a sound one.      It
 followed a procedure already in effect and
 long supported by the railroad brotherhoods,
 which is that where railroad mergers occur
 that affect jobs, the ICC shall determine the
 rearrangement of jobs.  It does so subject to
 all the rules of procedure that govern all
 proceedings of the regulatory agencies.
 Instead, and mistakenly, I think, the rail-
 road brotherhoods flatly rejected the appli-
 cation of this established means of handling
 job security in the railroad industry.  It re-
 jected this means of settlement, just as it
 rejected voluntary arbitration as a means of
 settlement.
 To me it is a shocking fact that what the
 railroad brotherhoods did give their stamp
 of approval to was pure and unadulterated
 compulsory arbitration.   Their formal ob-
 jections to the bill reported by the Senate
 Commerce Committee were mere window
 dressing.  Before the bill was ever reported,
 the word was out that this was the solution
 that was acceptable to the unions.  It was
 also understood that the brotherhoods were
 behind the McGee amendment to restrict the
 arbitration  to  the  two  major  work  rule
 issues.      -
 Many of the same Members of Congress
 who opposed the ICC solution because the
 brotherhoods did not want to go before the
 ICC promptly accepted the compulsory arbi-
 tration approach, and they did so because
 the brotherhoods accepted it.
 It is no exaggaration to say that not only
 was compulsory arbitration forced on rail-
 way employees by a union refusal to use
 voluntary arbitration, but it was accepted
 by the chiefs of the unions as preferable
 either to the proceedings of a regulatory
 agency or to voluntary arbitration by Justice
 Goldberg.  So the crocodile tears shed by the
 chiefs of the brotherhoods over the fact that
 out-and-out compulsory arbitration was ap-
 plied to-their unions for the first time in
 the history of Congress should not mislead
 anyone.  This result was their own doing.
 It was concurred in, too, by much of orga-
 nized labor. In my opinion, labor did a great
 disservice to itself, to its members, and to
 the future of collective bargaining by reject-
 ing all alternative means of handling this
 'articular dispute which would have in-
 volved voluntary action on their part.  They
 invited Congress to impose compulsory arbi-
 tration upon labor.  Let no one doubt that
 Congress will not need that kind of invita-
 16167
 tion next time.  The press and the Nation
 knew a precedent when they saw it, and this
 settlement has already been entered on many
 books as the way to handle any future dis-
 pute that may so much as threaten any
 substantial portion of the economy.
 I am as proud of my vote against this bill
 as I am of my votes against Taft-Hartley and
 Landrum-Griffin.  This arbitration  is un-
 necessary and unwise.  Since it was preferred
 by labor to any other proposal, however, the
 country and the Congress know that labor's
 opposition to compulsory arbitration is not
 even skin deep and it will be even easier to
 use next time than it was this time.

 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr.  FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President,
 there appears in this morning's Wash-
 ington Post a very fine article by Mr.
 Louis Harris, a noted public opinion poll-
 ster.  Mr. Harris reports that a recent
 survey of national sentiment toward the
 test ban,teaty reveals that the treaty now
 receives the unqualified approval of ap-
 proximately four out of five Americans.
 To say the least, these figures are en-
 couraging to those of us who favor rati-
 fication of the treaty and I, of course,
 commend the Harris survey to my col-
 leagues.  More startling than the vast
 support given to the treaty is the fact
 that the Harris survey reveals a marked
 shift of opinion during the past 2 months.
 During the period in which the Foreign
 Relations Committee held hearings on
 the treaty and issued its report and the
 treaty has been debated on the floor, the
 percentage of those polled favoring the
 treaty rose from a bare majority-52 per-
 cent-to the overwhelming 81 percent
 recorded in September.
 I believe this shift in opinion is fair
 evidence of the independence of the
 American people and a tribute to the
 open and free society in which we live.
 It is also gratifying to those of us in the
 Senate who sometimes feel that the de-
 bate on the floor a'nd the information
 produced by committee hearings  go
 unnoticed by the public.  I believe this
 poll indicates a deep public concern with
 the issues which it involves and I hope
 my colleagues will take time to examine
 its results.
 I ask unanimous consent that the Har-
 ris survey be printed in the RECORD at
 this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE HARRIS SURVEY: PUBLIC MORE THAN 4 TO 1
 FOR TREATY, MANY SWITCHING TO IT SINCE
 JULY
 (By Louis Harris)
 If the American people had to vote in the
 Senate this wee% on ratification of the nu-
 clear test ban agreement, they would vote
 better than 4 to 1 in approval, according to
 a special nationwide survey completed this
 past week.  Public fears of the effect of fall-
 out and radiation from continued testing and
 the cautious hope that the agreement marks
 a first step toward peace contribute heavily
 to people's views.
 Actually, there have been some interesting
 shifts In public opinion on the test ban ques-
 tion since the negotiations were begun early
 in July.  As the Senate has moved closer
 to a decision on the treaty, there has been
 a sharp increase in the number of people
 who now give unqualified support to the ban
 and a comparable fall off in the number
 who are outrightly opposed or still have
 reservations.
 Here are the current feelings toward the
 treaty among Americans who expressed their
 opinion in a poll taken last week-compared
 with the outcome before negotiations began
 in July:

 September
 the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
 Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff---all
 of these have only served to fortify my
 own longtime convictions as to the logic
 of the treaty.
 The Senate and the Nation were fur-
 ther strengthened in their support for
 the test ban by the unusually eloquent
 statements of Senator MANSFIELD, our be-
 loved majority leader, and Senator: DISK-
 SEN, the respected minority leader, whose
 plea to the Senate was one of the most
 moving experiences I have ever wit-
 nessed.  Senator FULBRIGHT, the wise and
 able chairman of the Senate Foreign Re-
 lations Committee, has likewise set forth
 what seems to me to be an irrefutable
 argument for approval of the treaty.
 In his news conference of last Thurs-
 day, President Kennedy summarized the
 case for ratification in two or three sen-
 tences, as follows:
 This treaty will enable all of us who in-
 habit the earth, our children, and children's
 children, to breathe easier, free from the fear
 of nuclear test fallout.  It will curb the
 spread of nuclear weapons to other countries,
 thereby holding out hope for a more peaceful
 Even if people giving only qualified ap-
 proval  are combined with  those opposed,
 there are only 19 percent who could not go
 along with ratification at the agreement
 now before the U.S. Senate.
 If the overall shift has been decidedly to-
 ward unqualified approval of the test ban
 agreement, then there are just as dramatic
 changes in the reasons that lie back of
 people's opinions.   When asked why they
 feel the way they do, here is the lineup of
 the reasons given:
 Reasons for favoring or opposing test ban

 4      impairing- the adequacy of this Nation's ar-
 In the 2 months of public discussion of
 the test ban, public awareness on the fallout
 issue has risen. In Lowell, Mass., for example,
 a 42-year-old machine tool operator put it
 this way: "Everyone should agree to this on
 account of the fallout.  This is bad for your
 system.  It can hurt your health." In Gary,
 Ind., a 27-year=old steel worker had this to
 say: "It should cut down on the danger to
 people's health."
 A sizable segment of the public also sees
 the test ban as a first step on the road to
 peace.  However, most agree with this elderly
 widow in Alhambra, Calif., in her caution,
 when she said: "I grant it doesn't really do
 much, but it's at least a step, a possible move
 for something better."  Or as a 28-year-old
 St. Louis accountant put it: "It's a first step
 in the relaxation of the cold war, but I'm
 still terribly leery of the Communists."
 Much of the opposition was summed up
 by a business executive in Rochester, N.Y.,
 who said: "It puts us at a military disadvan-
 tage.                                                                    We've been hoodwinked by the Rus-
 slans before.  It cuts down our experimenta-
 tion for an antimissile missile weapon."  Or,
 in the words of a motel owner in Inverness,
 Fla.: "It hurts national defense.  We'll keep
 our word.  Russia will break Its word."
 In short, in the view of a large majority
 of the American people, the test-ban treaty
 is considered a first, cautious step worth tak-
 ing, but few are ready to believe the millen-
 nium of peace is anywhere in sight.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Mr. President, I
 support the nuclear test ban treaty with-
 out reservation of any kind. The weeks
 of committee hearings-the supporting
 statements of our top Government, scien-
 tific, military, and religious leaders-the
 specific endorsements by the President,
 senal or security, and it will offer a small but
 important foundation on which a world of
 law can be built.
 RADIATION HAZARD OF NUCLEAR TesnNG
 I am for this ban on atmospheric test-
 ing first of all because I am worried by
 the danger to our children, and to gen-
 erations yet unborn, of death-dealing ra-
 dioactive fallout.
 I referred a moment ago, in my intro-
 duction of a bill, to the birth of the
 quintuplets born to Mr. and Mrs. Fisch-
 er, in my home State. I think one of the
 greatest gifts I can offer as one of the
 elected representatives of this family is
 to work in every possible way for a world
 where these children, all the children of
 South Dakota, indeed, all the children of
 the earth, can breathe clean air and live
 free from the blight of hatred and, war.
 It is true that the experts are not in
 agreement as to the number of leukemia
 or cancer victims there may be if we do
 not cease polluting the air with test ex-
 plosions.  We do not yet know for cer-
 tain how much genetic damage may be
 done to the brains, the bones, and the
 tissue of the children of the future if the
 nuclear test explosions continue.  But
 we do know that uncontrolled testing
 with more and more nations joining in
 the nuclear race will doom thousands of
 innocent human beings to suffering and
 premature death.
 Harvard's distinguished professor of bi-
 ology, Matthew Meselson, told the Sell-
 ate Foreign Relations Committee that
 "a reasonable estimate for the number
 of children with gross mental or physical
 defects who will be born in the world be-
 cause of the genetic effects of fallout
 from tests conducted to date is about
 50,000."
 Recent Government surveys have re-
 ported  radioactive  concentrations  in
 some localities two or three times great-

 er than we had previously believed to
 exist.
 The tragic fact is that we may not
 know fo>~ another generation or more the
 full effect of radiation damage already
 caused by nuclear explosions.
 The Friday an    of the Washington
 Star carried an urgent half-page paid
 advertisement, sponsored by the noted
 physician, Dr. F3enjamin Speck, and 66
 other medical doctors. Said Dr. Spock
 and his associates;
 We believe that as a result of the fallout
 .from past tests, at best a small percentage
 of our children will develop cancer or leu-
 kemia in the future, and that some of our
 children's children'will be born with physical
 deformities or mental deficiencies.  If test-
 ing in the atmosphere continues, the risks
 will increase.
 Some persons have contended that the
 radiation danger is a minor factor since
 it may affect only a small percentage of
 the world's children. But if one of those
 children, Mr. President, happened to be
 yours or mine, we would not think that
 was a minor matter.  No one of us
 relishes the thought of living perma-
 nently with the fear that our families
 might be drinking contaminated milk or
 eating polluted food or breathing poison-
 But, Mr. President, you and I would
 have less cause to complain about radia-
 tion damage to one of our children as a
 result of nuclear testing than would a
 'arent in Norway or Tunisia or the Phil-
 ippines. For we have a voice and a vote
 in the determination of the nuclear
 policy of the world's mightest nuclear
 power-the first nation to develop and
 explode ' a nuclear device.  Those mil-
 lions of human beings around the world
 who are nervously watching the nuclear
 race must rest their chances of survival
 on what the giant powers decide to do.
 Like the rain, radioactive dust falls alike
 on the just and the unjust, the inno-
 cent and the guilty, the weak and the
 strong.  Little wonder, then, that some
 91 nations have quickly offered their
 signatures to the treaty now pending
 before the Senate.
 In this morning's Washington Post,
 the distinguished columnist Mr. Roscoe
 Drummond reports the overwhelming
 support for the nuclear test ban treaty
 among the 59 national parliamentary
 groups attending the conference in Bel-
 grade, our .country being one of the coun-
 tries represented at the conference.  I
 should like to read one brief passage from
 this column:
 If there are any U.S. Senators wavering in
 their opposition to the nuclear test ban on
 the ground that it Is a meaningless gesture,
 it is too bad that they are not in Belgrade
 sitting  with  the  American  congressional
 delegation at the 52d conference of the Inter-
 parliamentary Union * * *. To a man they
 are deeply convinced that the test ban treaty
 is welcome and worth while,  a beginning
 toward a more peaceful world. They do not
 look upon the test ban as meaningless. They
 look upon it as a blessing.
 One final phrase :
 It is evident to every Senator and Con-
 gressman attending this global gathering of
 parliamentarians that if the U.S. Senate
 turns its back on the test ban, world opinion
 will turn its back on the United States in
 agony and disappointment.
 I ask unanimous consent that the full
 text of the article by Mr. Drummond be
 printed in the RECORD at the conclusion
 of my remarks.

 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 1.)
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Mr. President, this
 one single factor-the radiation haz-
 ard-places a sobering responsibility on
 those who say that we will all be safer
 if the nations of the world continue to
 explode their nuclear warheads in the
 air.
 Of course, those who oppose the treaty
 contend that we must risk radioactive
 fallout to avoid the military risk involved
 in the limited test ban.
 I think this argument has been de-
 molished by our best military and scien-
 tific authorities-to say nothing of the
 moral, political, and diplomatic issues in-
 volved.
 We now have a clear-cut nuclear su-
 periority over any other nation.   We
 have enough warheads and delivery sys-
 tems right now to obliterate civilization
 even if we never test another bomb or
 missile In the atmosphere.  Far from
 adding to our nuclear superiority, con-
 tinued testing by ourselves and other
 countries could clear the way for our
 rivals to narrow our present nuclear lead.
 This has been the past experience of nu-
 clear testing over the years.
 There are those who argue that we
 need to test in the atmosphere to develop
 a defensive antimissile missile.  This
 argument falters at two points: First, it
 it highly unlikely that either we or the
 Russians can develop any really depend-
 able defense against offensive missiles;
 second, the unsolved problems of the
 antimissile missile do not call for atmos-
 pheric testing but relate instead to tech-
 nical problems such as guidance systems
 and  the  identification  of  incoming
 missiles, which have nothing to do with
 the testing of warheads.
 The  only  dependable         protection
 against enemy missiles is the enemy's
 knowledge that if he destroys our coun-
 try, we can destroy his simultaneously.
 We are in a balance of terror today, and
 neither side has the slightest need to ex-
 plode another test bomb to demonstrate
 its enormous killing power. The leaders
 of both the United States and Russia al-
 ready know that a nuclear exchange of
 a few minutes' duration would incin-
 erate most of the people in both nations.
 If that is not enough to deter a nuclear
 strike, then mankind is doomed no mat
 ter how many test bombs we explode or'
 fail to explode.
 But for those in doubt, we have the re-
 peated assurance of our President and
 our military leaders that underground
 testing will be energetically pushed and
 that we will be prepared to resume
 atmospheric  tests  if  that  becomes
 necessary.
 Indeed, Mr. President, the administra-
 tion has been called upon to give so
 many assurances of our continued nu-
 clear, efforts after treaty ratification

 that a casual observer might assume
 that we are approving this treaty so that
 we can accelerate the arms race and
 beef up the warmaking facilities of our
 country.
 There seems to be a side of our nature
 which leads us to require repeated assur-
 ances that we will continue to add to our
 capacity to annihilate the enemy more
 thoroughly than he annihilates us.
 Some spokesmen have warned about
 the great danger of euphoria setting in
 if we cease exploding test bombs over
 the heads of the earth's inhabitants.
 Webster defines "euphoria" as "bodily
 comfort; a feeling of well-being."
 Frankly, Mr. President, I think there
 is less danger to the world from this
 dread disease, "euphoria," with its symp-
 toms of "bodily comfort" and "a feeling
 of well-being" than from polluting the
 air with radiation and accelerating the
 nuclear race.
 As a former combat soldier I know
 the necessity of a strong and alert na-
 tional defense.
 But I also know that there is more to
 the defense of a nation than the size of
 its nuclear stockpile.
 We need to balance off the alleged dan-
 ger of becoming afflicted by "a feeling of
 well-being" against the dangers to our
 way of life from another 10, 20, or 50
 years of mounting tension, anxiety, and
 fear.  What does it do to a free society
 to live decade after decade under the
 shadow of a nuclear Armageddon. What
 does it do to our Nation to invest annu-
 ally more than half of our entire na-
 tional budget in building the weapons
 of death while neglecting the quality
 of our schools, our cities, and our lives?
 I fully agree with the distinguished
 Senator from Louisiana [Mr. ELLENDERI,
 who said on Friday:
 If the Senate should fail to ratify the test
 ban treaty, it appears to me we face two al-
 ternatives, and  either  will be destructive
 of our way of life. We may eventually drift
 or be forced into a nuclear war with Russia
 or we will go broke attempting to maintain
 the status quo indefinitely.  Does any in-
 telligent person believe we can continue to
 pour out between $50 and $60 billion for
 any length of time without doing violence
 and much harm to our economy and our
 way of life?  I for one do not.
 I agree with the Senator whole-
 heartedly.
 Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. McGOVERN. I have only a brief
 statement.  I wonder whether the Sen-
 ator will withhold his questions until I
 have completed my statement; then I
 will be glad to yield to him.
 Senator ELLENDER expressed the hope
 of a world that longs for peace when
 he said that the treaty could be a first
 step to thaw the cold war and help dispel
 the fear existing between Russia and the
 United States.
 This brings me to one aspect of the
 treaty ratification which I t4ink has not
 had sufficient consideration.  I refer to
 the impact of this first step upon the
 Communist world.
 THE TREATY AND THE SINO-SOVIET RIFT

 hopes for world peace depend not only

 on the policy of the United States, but
 even more significantly on the, course
 which the Communist world follows.
 All our hopes for peace-and I believe
 the American people are united in that
 hope, for peace-can be dashed into a
 nuclear holocaust no matter what we do
 if the Soviets and their allies should de-
 cide that they prefer that alternative to
 peaceful coexistence.
 So we need to consider whether rati-
 fication of the test ban encourages the
 forces of peace or war in the Com-
 munist sectors of the globe.
 During most of the 18 years since
 World War IT, we have thought of the
 Communist nations  as a monolithic
 structure solidly united under the lead-
 ership of Moscow.                 With the emergence
 of a Communist regime in Peking, we
 developed the phrase "Sino-Soviet bloc"
 to describe what we believed to be the
 common front of Russian and Chinese
 Communist power.   We noted and par-
 tially exploited the divergence of Tito's
 Yugoslavia from Moscow leadership, but
 we saw this as a unique and uncertain
 exception to the monolithic nature of
 international communism.
 In recent years, however, we have wit-
 nessed a fast-growing split in the Sino-
 Soviet bloc.  Indeed, there is now clear
 evidence of a bitter power struggle be-
 tween Moscow and Peiping for leader-
 ship of international communism.
 "The New Cold War: Moscow Versus
 Peking" is the title of a newly published
 book by Edward Crankshaw, the London
 Observer's respected authority on Soviet
 affairs.  Crankshaw and others see the
 first signs of the Russo-Chinese rift in
 the notable 20th Soviet Party Congress
 of February  1956  when Ihrushchev
 launched the movement to downgrade
 Stalin.   At the same Congress, Khru-
 shchev announced that war with the
 capitalist societies is no longer consid-
 ered inevitable in Communist dogma.
 The Chinese took issue with both of these
 developments.
 For several years the Soviets and the
 Chinese tried to soften the public dem-
 onstration of their differences by indirect
 verbal  attacks.  When  the  Chinese
 wanted to attack the views of Moscow
 they did so by sharp criticism of Yugo-
 slavia.                   The Russians would reply by a
 verbal blast at Albania.
 There are numerous factors involved in
 the widening Sino-Soviet rift. Basical-
 ly, however, the dispute centers around
 Khrushchev's policy of coexistence and
 some accommodation with the West.
 While Mr. Khrushchev has given growing
 evidence of his desire to avoid a military
 showdown, the Chinese have denounced
 this policy as a cowardly betrayal of
 Communist principle.
 During 1959 Khrushchev seemed to be
 cultivating President Eisenhower and
 laying the groundwork through the
 spirit of Camp David for a high-level
 understanding.  The subsequent sum-
 mit conference in Paris in the spring of
 1960 was, however, torpedoed by the ill-
 fated U-2 incident and Khrushchev's
 violent reaction to that event.  it seems
 probable that the hard-liners in the
 Kremlin and the more militaristic advo-
 cates In Peiping made it politically nec-
 essary for Khrushchev to back off from
 the Paris conference when the U--2 in-
 cident erupted on the very eve of the
 conference.
 Since that time, the Soviet leader has
 seemed to act alternatively belligerent
 and peaceful, but always he has backed
 away from the much more aggressive
 course demanded by Peiping.
 The Moscow-Peiping battle broke into
 full public view following the Cuban mis-
 sile crisis of last October.  After gam-
 bling on the missile Installations in Cuba
 which he thought would strengthen his
 hand for a showdown on Berlin, Khru-
 shchev withdrew his missiles in the face
 of President Kennedy's stern ultimatum.
 This  withdrawal   infuriated  the
 Chinese who saw it as a surrender to
 the  hated  imperialists-the United
 States-which had previously been de-
 scribed by Peiping as a "paper tiger."
 Khrushchev replied: "The paper tiger
 has nuclear teeth".
 He warned the Chinese that to follow
 the unyielding militaristic course advo-
 cated by them would lead to a nuclear
 devastation that would cause survivors
 to envy the dead.
 The Moscow-Peiping differences were
 further inflamed by the Chinese attack
 on the Indian border which coincided
 with the Cuban missile crisis.  Moscow
 made no effort to hide its displeasure
 and in fact assisted the Indians rather
 than its Communist ally.
 This summer the world has witnessed
 the public exchange of lengthy letters
 between the Communist parties of China
 and Russia which erase any doubt as to
 the fundamental ideological conflict be-
 tween the two power blocs.
 No one can read the article on the
 origins of the Sino-Soviet rift published
 by Peiping on September 6 without
 sensing the intensity of the struggle.
 The article traces the dispute to the 20th
 Congress of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union in 1956 and the Soviet
 peaceful coexistence policy which ac-
 companied the downgrading of Stalin.
 The Peiping government takes strong
 exception to the Soviet warning about
 the necessity of avoiding a nuclear war.
 In its letter to the Chinese on July 14
 of this year-remember, this was on the
 eve of the nuclear test ban discussion-
 the Central Committee of the Soviet
 Communist Party wrote:
 The CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union)  Central  Committee believes it a
 necessary duty to tell the party and the
 people with all frankness that in questions
 of war and peace the CCP (Chinese Com-
 munist Party) leadership is based on prin-
 ciple differences with us, with the world
 Communist movement.  The essence of these
 differences lies in the diametrically opposite
 approach to such vital problems as the pos-
 sibility of averting a world thermonuclear
 war, peaceful coexistence of states with dif-
 ferent social systems, and interconnection
 between the struggle for peace and the de-
 velopment of the world revolutionary move-
 ment.
 Two recent actions-to say nothing of
 the battle of words-of the Soviet Union
 point up their acute 'differences with
 Peiping.  Under  Secretary  of  State
 Averell Harriman has noted that it was
 the U.S.S.R. which proposed that the
 successful test ban treaty negotiations
 should begin in Moscow on July 15.
 Previously, July 5 had been fixed for the
 Moscow talks with the Chinese.  The
 Soviet letter-in effect, an attack on the
 Chinese position, which I have just
 quoted-was sent on July 14 while talks
 with the Chinese Communists were in
 progress.  Both the  timing of these
 events and the substance of that letter
 are less than conciliatory toward the
 Chinese.
 The Chinese Communists have de-
 nounced the proposed test ban as a. "nu-
 clear fraud," a "fake peace," an instru-
 ment of nuclear "monopoly," and a
 "capitulation to U.S. imperialism" which
 allows it to "gain military superiority."
 In the history of the Sino-Soviet dispute
 published by Peiping on September 6, the
 Chinese openly berated Moscow  for
 scrapping its agreement to help Red
 China develop nuclear weapons. Peiping
 said that the agreement was broken "ap-
 parently as a gift" to be made to Presi-
 dent Eisenhower "to curry favor with the
 U.S. imperialists" during the Khrush-
 chev visit to the United States in Sep-
 tember of 1959.
 One could quote at length from the
 growing literature of dispute, down to
 the recent bitter exchange about inci-
 dents along the frontier between the
 U.S.S.R. and Communist China and the
 charge of Peiping that Mr. Khrushchev
 has joined President Kennedy, President
 Tito, and Prime Minister Nehru as a
 "vaudeville star" in a new holy alliance..
 What I have said, however, is quite
 enough to remind the Senate that this
 dispute over the leadership of interna-
 tional communism between these two
 major Communist powers is a major
 reason for Soviet agreement to the treaty,
 a proposal which they had rejected in
 1959 and, again, in 1961.
 Some of our most able Soviet authori-
 ties, including Mr. Harriman, believe that
 Mr. Khrushchev urgently needs some
 tangible evidence that his doctrine of
 peaceful coexistence is a more practical
 policy than the militant Chinese line.
 The treaty is popular in Eastern. Eu-
 rope, as indicated by remarks of Mr.
 Roscoe Drummond, which I just read,
 where there is pressure for more inde-
 pendence of Soviet control. It has been
 widely acclaimed by the developing coun-
 tries of the globe.  It is plausible that
 Moscow desires the treaty to win greater
 voluntary approval among people both
 at  home  and  abroad.  Khrushchev
 doubtless feels that he can command
 greater influence by supporting the test
 ban as a symbol of peace than Mao Tse-
 tung can in the role of an unyielding
 warmonger.
 Beyond this, it is quite probable that
 the Soviet leadership should mean in. a
 literal sense what they say about avoid-
 ing nuclear war even as they say it for
 propaganda effect. Why should they not
 wish to avoid a nuclear war which could
 destroy most of their country?  Why
 should it not be reasonable to suppose
 that in the avoidance of nuclear war, at
 least, we have some common ground
 with them; that they conceive of this
 treaty, as we do, as a step-admittedly
 a limited step-admittedly-a step involv-

 aggression pact between NATO and the War-
 saw countries and to create denuclearized
 zones in unspecified parts of the world, in-
 cluding central Europe.
 These are the kind of deals which Mr.
 I hrusl chew wanted to tie to the test ban
 itself.  We refused.  Unless the resolution
 can be amended in committee the U.S. con-
 gressional delegation (including such Sen-
 ators as ABRAHAM RIBICOFF of Connecticut,
 EDWARD   KENNEDY  of Massachusetts,  JAMES
 PEARSON of Kansas and such Representatives
 as GERALD F'oRD of Michigan, ROSS ADArR Of
 Indiana, will either have to give qualifying
 speeches and vote for it or find itself in
 minority of two in voting against it along
 with the West Germans.
 In this first international conference since
 the signing of the test ban, the mood of the
 bloc delegates, as evidenced by their speeches,
 is amiable.  There are no denunciations and
 few criticisms.  They are courting a detente,
 a relaxation, and all they want are a few
 agreements which will help Soviet purposes
 and not do the free world any good.
 Mr. MILLER.  Mr. President will the
 Senator from South Dakota yield?
 Mr. McGOVERN.  I yield.
 Mr. MILLER.  Mr. President, I should
 like to ask the distinguished Senator
 from South Dakota a question.  Earlier
 in his speech, he referred to a statement
 by the Senator from Louisiana (Mr.
 ELLENDERI  that if the Senate were to
 fail to approve the test ban treaty, It
 would appear that either of two things
 would happen: Either the United States
 might drift into a nuclear war with the
 Soviet Union, or increased national de-
 fense expenditures would bankrupt our
 country.  I believe the Senator from
 South Dakota has adopted that view-
 point as his own.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  That is correct.
 Mr. MILLER.  I should like to ask
 him whether he believes that the in-
 creased cost of national defense and Its
 impact on the economy is a greater
 prospect for the United States than it is
 for the Soviet Union.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  I believe not.  I
 believe, as a matter of fact, that the cost
 of the arms burden for the people of the
 Soviet Union is as great a burden on
 them, if not a greater one, than it is
 on us. But the point I have been. stress-
 ing today is that we have a mutual in-
 terest in trying to get the world on a                     should continue to press for a compre-

 Mr. MILLER.  I suggest that it would
 be more of a presumption that if we
 walk out of the Chamber- that we will
 not be struck by lightning than it would
 be that if we enter into the treaty we
 would have better relations with the
 Soviet Union.  I share the hope and
 prayer of the Senator from South Da-
 kota that such would happen? But I am
 not persuaded in respect to the strong
 probability that he suggests.  There is,
 indeed, a possibility.  But I am unim-

 the assurances given by the President of
 the United States, this need be no more
 of a problem for us-land probably it
 would be less of a problem for us-than
 for the Soviet Union because-if I cor-
 rectly understand the President's as-
 surances-we intend to maintain our de-
 terrent capability to such an extent that
 if the Soviet Union sees fit to drift into
 a nuclear war, it will be destroyed.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  I could not agree
 with the Senator more enthusiastically.
 Again he makes a point that I have been
 trying to stress today.  In the event of
 a nuclear war, not only would most of
 our country be destroyed, but in the
 process the Soviet Union would be de-
 stroyed  Secretary McNamara has esti-
 I am sure the Senator from South Da-
 kota and I could sit down and draft a
 better treaty than the one before the
 Senate.  It would be aimed at stopping
 nuclear testing in the atmosphere, but
 it would be a better treaty, and it would
 remove some of the objections of some
 of the opponents. The point I wish to
 make is that we should not drive our-
 selves into the position of pointing the
 finger at anyone who opposes the treaty
 and saying, "Because you oppose this
 treaty, you therefore will have this coun-
 try follow either of these two roads-
 -drifting into nuclear war or bankrupt-
 ing the United States."
 I cannot imagine anything more un-
 fair than to do that.  I suggest that
