 MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
 Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
 Acting National Intelligence Officer for Economics
 SUBJECT:        Press Reports on NSC "Challenge" to the Economic
 Policy Council
 1.  The New York Times and Wall Street Journal today ran stories
 about McFarlane's proposal to establish a c6mnittee composed of the
 Defense Department, CIA, State, and NSC to assess the strategic
 implications of economic policy decisions.  The New York Times, referring
 to the committee incorrectly as a Cabinet-level group, says that the
 committee could "operate as a power rival to the EPC."  The Wall Street
 Journal notes correctly that State Department has demurred from joining
 the group.  You will recall that you received a memorandum from McFarlane
 on this issue asking for a CIA-representative.  I sent you a draft
 response supporting McFarlane's recommendation and suggesting that CIA be
 represented on the group by the NIO for Economics.
 2.  1 met with McFarlane's Senior Director for International Economic
 Affairs, Stephen Danzansky, this morning to discuss his plans for this
 new group.  Danzansky explained that he hoped the group would meet weekly
 to discuss EPC agenda items for the following week.  The group would also
 prepare a "National Security Impact Statement" on EPC decisions which
 would accompany Council proposals to the President.
 3.  Secretary Baker obviously opposes the formation of this group,
 and his people likely briefed the New York Times on McFarlane's memo.
 Should Baker appeal the creation of this group to the President,
 presenting it (correctly) as an unnecessary bureaucratic layer, it would
 give us a chance to point up the shortcomings of the EPC process,
 including:
 --   the =pparently deliberate failure of the EPC to get position
 papers to NSC, DOD, and CIA on a timely basis; and

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE HONORABLE WILLIAM J. CASEY
 The Director of Central Intelligence
 SUBJECT:         National Security Assessment of Economic
 Policy Decisions:  New Procedure (S)
 With the recent highly visible activity in the trade and
 monetary areas, the President is more frequently called upon
 to make decisions relating to economic policy than in the
 past.  Most of these decisions have major international and
 national security implications.   (S)
 Because of this, I have become increasingly concerned in the
 last few months that in the internal handling of interna-
 tional economic issues there is no mechanism to ensure that
 final recommendations that are sent forward to the President
 have been considered from an overall national security
 perspective.  Often it is the case that it is not until a
 final recommendation is made that the national security
 implications can be fully assessed.  In addition, I do not
 believe that CIA and Defense are adequately consulted-on
 many economic policy matters. The President must be given
 the opportunity to weigh all the international political and
 military implications of each proposal on the best-informa-
 tion available.  (S)
 I have decided, as a result, that it is necessary to put
 into place a more formal procedure for providing the Presi-
 dent with fully considered national security advice on all
 international economic issues.  What I propose is a require-
 ment that all recommendations to the President on interna-
 tional economic matters, from the EPC or other sources, must
 be subject to a last stop national security review process
 overseen by the security agencies:  NSC, CIA, State and
 Defense.   (S)
 This review process would be memorialized in a document
 called a National Security Impact Statement (NSIS) which
 would reflect the judgment of the above-mentioned agencies
 on the relationship of the proposed decin :ion to the Presi-
 dent's overall foreign policy objectives.  This &cw ent
 would be urepared by representatives from the sur?ity
 agencies who would assess the national security implications
 of proposed actions.  There is no intention in this proposal
 to create another bureaucratic layer.  The purpose is to
 facilitate the decisionmaking process through a close

 coordination of our agencies to best serve the President in
 making economic decisions that could affect the national
 security.. (S).
 I have asked Stephen Danzansky to coordinate the new process
 on my behalf.  Steve already has spoken to Willie Taft of
 Defense about establishing better coordination on economic
 policy matters# and with Dean Hoffman at the Agency. 'As
 part of the NSIS process, I foresee that it will be neces-
 sary regularly to communicate with a small group from the
 security agencies whose sole purpose is to provide the
 assessments which would form the basis of the Impact State-
 ment.  In order to make the process as efficient as possi-
 ble, I would like only one representative from each agency.
 I would request that you ask Dean Hoffman, or some other
 person, to regularly participate in meetings-of this group
 as the CIA's representative.  (S)

 JOINT STATEMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING
 OF THE ASEAN  ECONOMIC MINISTERS
 THE ASEAN  ECONOMIC MINISTERS HELD A SPECIAL MEETING
 IN BANGKOK ON  16 OCTOBER 1985 AND CONSIDERED THE ISSUE OF
 RISING PROTECTIONISM  IN  INTERNATIONAL TRADE ESPECIALLY IN
 THE US,      WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE JENKINS-THURMOND
 BILL.
 THE MINISTERS NOTED THAT ASEAN MEMBER COUNTRIES,
 COLLECTIVELY AND  INDIVIDUALLY,  HAVE BEEN MAKING THEIR UTMOST
 EFFORTS IN URGING THE US ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS AND
 INTERESTED PARTIES CONCERNED TO APPRECIATE THE EXTENT OF THE
 REPERCUSSIONS OF THE BILL,  IF PASSED,  ON THE ECONOMIC AND
 SOCIAL                    OF ASEAN COUNTRIES AND ON THE OVERALL
 CLOSE-AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS  BETkEEN ASEAN AND THE US._
 THE MINISTERS REITERATED ASEAN'S STRONG OPPOSITION
 TO THE BILL WHICH  IS  DISCRIMINATORY AND CONTRARY TO EXISTING
 INTERNATIONAL LAW AND US  BILATERAL AGREEMENTS.   AT THE SAME
 TIME,  THE MINISTERS WELCOMED WITH GREAT APPRECIATION THE
 EXPLICIT AND FIRM STAND OF THE US ADMINISTRATION IN OPPOSING
 THE  BILL.    THE MINISTERS WERE ALSO ENCOURAGED BY THE RISING
 RECOGNITION WITHIN  AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMBERS OF THE
 CONGRESS OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THE   BILL.   THE
 MINISTERS,    HOWEVER,  RECOGNISE THAT THE DANGER  IS FAR FROM
 OVER.   THEY,  THEREFORE,  FURTHER URGE THE US ADMINISTRATION

 AND MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TOWARD THE
 EVENTUAL REJECTION OF THE BILL WHICH POSES A GRAVE DANGER
 NOT ONLY TO ASEAN BUT ALSO TO THE FREE INTERNATIONAL TRADING
 FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH ALL COUNTRIES JOINTLY BENEFIT.
 THE MINISTERS FURTHER POINTED OUT THAT THE BILL,  IN
 ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ASEAN ECONOMIES' ABILITY TO EXPORT,
 WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH NO ALTERNATIVE  BUT TO -CURTAIL'TRADE
 IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN EXTERNAL BALANCE.   MOREOVER, ASEAN'S
 EXPORT-LED ECONOMIES WILL BE CONSIDERABLY-DAMAGED AND
 DESTABILIZED.   ACCORDINGLY, EACH ASEAN COUNTRY WILL HAVE TO
 CONSIDER ADOPTING MEASURES TO COUNTER THE DAMAGING EFFECT OF
 THE BILL.
 THE ASEAN ECONOMIC MINISTERS FINALLY POINA'ED OUT
 THAT BEYOND  THE ECONOMIC  IMPACT t4flICH IS REAL AND IMMEDIATE,
 THE JENKINS-THURMOND AND OTHER PROTECTIONIST BILLS HAVE
 ALREADY AND INEVITABLY CREATED WITHIN ASEAN A.SENSE OF
 UNCERTAINTY AND DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE UNITED STA'iES.   THE
 CONSTRUCTIVE EFFORTS AND PROGRESS MADE TO NURTURE AND
 CONSOLIDATE US-ASEAN RELATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SUFFER A
 SETBACK WITH THE  PASSAGE OF THE JENKINS--THURMOND BILL.

 Talking Points for the DCI
 The New Soviet Leadership:   Gorbachev's Men?
 With the replacement of Premier Tikhonov last month,
 Gorbachev has completed the process of placing new leaders in
 charge of the key institutions running the Soviet Union--the
 Politburo, Secretariat, and Council  of Ministers:
 o    The new generation of leaders appears to share a common
 commitment to purging Brezhnev-era holdovers and
 revitalizing the Soviet system.
 o    They are not radical  reformers, but most have a
 reputation as pragmatic administrators, willing to
 innovate without being bound by ideological dogma or
 past tradition.
 o    They have a better understanding of the shortcomings of
 the system based on recent, hands-on experience with
 its problems and frustrations.
 o    They are not creatures of the organizations they are
 now runnin   and are thus more likely to challenge the
 status quo
 For the present, these men are beholden to Gorbachev, but it
 is not clear how broad the consensus is among them:
 o    They are not a cohesive group like the Dnepropetrovsk
 mafia that dominated under Brezhnev.   Most do not have
 long-standing personal ties to Gorbachev.
 o    It is unclear if their support for broad personnel
 changes can be transferred to policy matters--
 particularly on politically difficult issues such as
 economic reform
 Down the road, members of the regime may be prepared to push
 their own policy agendas.   Two of his key allies have achieved
 positions of considerable independence that will  give them a base
 to do so:
 o     Yegor Ligachev has established himself as second
 secretary of the party with very broad
 responsibilities.   With Ryzhkov's move to the
 premiership, he is the only secretary with full
 membership in the Politburo and appears to be acquiring
 a broad role similar to that of Gorbachev under
 Chernenko.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/11/17: CIA-RDP87B00342R000601350008-5
 o    Premier Ryzhkov is presiding over a Council  of
 Ministers with rejuvenated institutional  authority.
 With no senior economic secretary named to replace him
 in the party apparatus, he will  have an unusually free
 hand to run the economy.
 The Politburo under Gorbachev seems more likely than in the
 past to take a less conservative approach to decisionmaking,
 making tough decisions that go against the interests of some
 members.
 o    It will  be more likely to conside           range of
 options before making decisions.
 o    It remains to be seen if the new Politburo will  be able
 to work in sufficient harmony to carry out tough
 decisions, but we are likely to see greater political
 conflict and more frequent changes in membership than
 was the norm under Brezhnev.

 12 Novwmber 1985
 NIC OUTLOOK MEETING WITH DCI     NIO/USSR
 1.   Once Again on Gorbachev's Game Plan:  The Summit Outlook
 By now we've said what we can, but it's worth recapping.
 Gorbachev wants a breathing space for the USSR in the form of some relief
 from the more intensely competitive behavior of the United States seen in
 the last five years, specifically:
 from our rising defense spending;
 from our more vigorous weapons development, especially SDI and new
 conventional weapons;
 from greater US engagement in regional issues;
 and from our more challenging political stance toward his system and
 its behavior.
 He wants this breathing space for two reasons:
 First, and most important, he wants to devote more economic resources
 and leadership attention, at the margin, to fixing the deep problems
 of a very unhealthy economy and society.  Doing so will be the
 measure of his time in power.
 Second, a breathing space like the one-sided detente of the 1970s
 would also allow the USSR to expand its influence at low cost and
 risk in the Third Wor   and among US allies.
 Gorbachev is as yet not ready to pay anything substantial in the form of
 concessions to the U  on vital security issues -- arms control or
 regional conflicts -- or human rights.  He wants a breather on the cheap,
 and believes he can get it.
 While sweeping, his arms control position is one-sided, demands great
 concessions from the US on SDI, and would take years to negotiate in
 any case.  Making his proposal involved no real concession so far.
 So far, Gorbachev has signalled no real flexibility on the regional
 issues.  He appears determined to back his Leninist clients in the
 Third World and to hang tough on Afghanistan.  With the exception of
 Afghanistan, the USSR's Third World adventures are not that costly or
 risky now.  Their real cost is the possibility that they will
 continue to inspire strong competitive behavior from the US on all
 fronts.  But this is not certain. [See Item #3 below]

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/11/17: CIA-RDP87B00342R000601350008-5
 Gorbachev will clearly do what he can to exploit and deepen fissures
 in US alliance relationships by a more activist foreign policy.  He
 sees a detente environment as offering a favorable setting, but will
 try do this no matter what the atmosphere.
 He shows no sign of readiness to move toward liberalizing the human
 rights situation inside the USSR, except for some cosmetic gestures;
 and    pressing for more discipline out of East Europe.
 At this point, Gorbachev is not counting on specific concessions from the
 US that give him his breathing space.  At the summit, what he is after is
 an atmospheric result and a continuing political process that encourage a
 relaxation of pressures from the US through other forces over the rest of
 the President's term.  He wants to convince publics, Congress, allies,
 and t e President himself (if he can), that Moscow is willing to be
 reasonable, but cannot be pushed.  Coming out of Geneva, he wants all
 these parties to believe that Washington bears the main burden to make
 concessions and accommodations for the sake of bettern US-Soviet
 relations.  If he can create this perception, over time the burden will
 wear down the Reagan administration and deliver a more accommodating
 president in the next election.
 As he watches the fate of defense budgets and other security issues
 in the     on ress, he sees how this can happen in the last years of
 the Reagan presi
 At the summit, Gorbachev will not be open to persuasion that his views
 and policies are wrong.
 Both his personality as a counterpuncher and his system run against
 his letting himself be persuaded.
 On the contrary he will be out to take the measure of the President and
 to persuade him that his anti-Soviet policies are wrong and can easily be
 altered because Moscow will be forthcoming if the US makes concessions.
 Gorbachev is, indeed, likely to use the argument that Soviet domestic
 problems "prove" the Soviets will be reasonable -- if only the US
 signs up to peaceful coexistence on Soviet terms.  He did this in
 Time.
 There is not much the President can do to change Gorbachev's position at
 the summit.  His most important and achievable task is to inject doubt in
 the minds of Gorbachev and his team that they can get a cheap breathin
 e
 space without serious concessions, solely by playing on atmosphere,
 o~ ngress, etc.
 This places a premium on the following:
 At the summit, the President conveys confidence in the rightness of
 his policy course, in its congruence with US national interests and

 SECRET
 the cause of peace, and in his ability to stay the course and make it
 a lasting part of American politics.
 After the summit, the President demonstrates his ability to keep his
 national security agenda on course in the Congress.
 "Domestic Stresses on the Soviet System" and Implications
 there are still likely to be important
 arguments among Wlb agencies as to whether and just how much Soviet
 domestic, mainly economic, troubles oblige Gorbachev to hold to a flat or
 even go to a reduced level of defense spending.  Nevertheless, as of now,
 there is agreement that:
 Soviet internal troubles are deep and serious, both as regards the
 economy and the surrounding political and social environment.
 Gorbachev's likely conservative strategy for addressing them will
 probably not make the Soviet system a great deal ~ealthi healthier in the
 next five years.  Even if he takes more reformist steps than we think
 likely, it will still take longer to make serious improvements.
 Moreover, many domestic intiatives (e.g., cadre replacement and
 management reform) will produce more social tension before they
 produce better system performance.
 All in all, the domestic scene is a heavier drag on the USSR's
 effectiveness as a superpower than ever.
 Nevertheless                                  the USSR can still field a
 lot of new military power at reduced levels of defense spending, because
 it is operating from such a high base of production and active forces,
 and can still pursue its policies in the Third World, unless we make them
 more costly and risky.
 Thus, Gorbachev has a middle option between intensifying Soviet
 competitive effort and making concessions (which the NIE now
 mentions) of reducing defense spending somewhat and only for a finite
 period of four or five years, while stiff-arming the US on security
 issues and trying to work our allies.  His ability to get away with
 this depends on a US Congress which fails to support the
 Admininstration on defense and regional security.
 [A footnote:
 e Kbb does no  report to the
 leadership on broad domestic conditions (which helps explain why they
 have been slow to get the picture), that reli ious adherence, while no
 real political threat, is growing in the USSR (our view as well), that
 Russian nationalism is on the rise (ditto), and that the KGB likes
 detente because of the "operational opportunities" as well as-the
 economic help it brings the USSR (no surprise here).

 13 November 1985
 Gorbachev Posture at the Summit
 the Soviets want to portray the President and Mrs.
 Reagan as pompous and lavish, and also show off Gorbachev as more
 vigorous.
 Gorbachev likely presented himself in these ways at the recent Warsaw
 Pact meeting in Sofia.  At the Summit he probably will strive to make an
 impression somewhat in between that in Paris and Sofia--being more
 respectful with the President than he was with his Warsaw Pact
 counterparts, but less cordial than he was with Mitterand.
 The image of Gorbachev as a hard working, modest servant of the
 people bears similarity to the Khrushchev model without the
 latter's impetuousness and idiosyncracy.  Brezhnev's sumptous
 appreciation of life left no room for this kind of tactic during
 his Summits.
 The Khrushchev model which worked well for the Soviets at Summits
 in that era, probably would resonate favorably again in the USSR,
 among Soviet allies, and in the Third World.  The dimension of
 worker-peasant man of the people might not work so well as a
 television image directed at middle class Western publics in the
 1980s; but the image of a serious-minded manager striving to
 solve important problems is well calculated to strike a favorable
 chord in the West.
 Gorbachev also might extend his stay in Geneva an extras day in order
 to give a final press conference following the President's departure.  The
 Swiss are said to have given their approval to this option.
 In pursuing this tactic, which could well follow Gorbachev's not
 gaining the kinds of agreements that he wants, the Soviets would
 hope to gain unique attention and focus post-Summit discussion
 and images their way.
 We should be prepared to term this tactic the grandstand
 propaganda play that it probably would be, contrary to the
 seriousness of purpose that we believe Geneva represents.

 12 November 1985
 Taiwan -- All the King's Horses and All the King's Men?
 1.  Only a few years ago the prospects f   a smooth transition of power
 on the mainland of China from Deng Xiaoping to his successor looked
 uncertain while Taiwan awaited Chiang Ching-Kuo's passing with confidence
 and optimism.   Now the tables have turned.  China's September party
 conference placed Deng's reformers more firmly in control and reduced the
 chances of old guard military officers playing king maker at his death.
 Meanwhile, the untimely stroke of Taiwan's Premier Sun and KMT party Chief
 Y. S. Chiang's indirect involvement in financial shenanigans on the island
 have thrown the succession to CCK into turmoil and doubt.
 2.  In retrospect, Premier Sun, as heir apparent, was a crucial element
 in CCK's succession plans.  He had the confidence of the old guard
 mainlander conservatives and the vision to depend on a younger generation of
 mainlander technocrats and upstart native Taiwanese to guide Taiwan into the
 21st Century.  CCK forged just such a coalition when he assumed power from
 his father, the legendary Chiang Kai-shek, in 1975.  The decade of political
 and economic progress that ensued spoke well of the idea and with CCK's
 blessing Premier Sun appeared poised to carry on in the same fashion long
 after CCK had passed from the scene.
 3.  So, too, was the KMT in good hands headed by the bright and
 articulate Y. S. Chiang.  The President's trouble shooter of many years
 presided over the modernization and Taiwanization of what had become almost
 a moribund and irrelevant artifice.  He breathed new life into the ruling
 party by promoting able, young, western educated mainlanders and transfusing
 the rank and file until about 70 percent of the membership became native
 Taiwanese.  What had begun many years before as a Leninist mechanism of
 control on the mainland became a modern political party stressing competence
 and constituent services on Taiwan.  He was so successful that it literally
 took the wind out of the sails of the once vigorous Taiwanese opposition.
 KMT victories in local elections with mostly native Taiwanese politicians
 left the opposition Tangwai little to criticize and more of an irritant than
 a real electoral threat.
 4.  Premier Sun's incapacitation and Y. S. Chiang's fall from grace
 changed all that.  An older and seemingly tired out CCK reacted to the new
 situation by surrounding himself with conservative hardliners suspicious of

 ese men appear en on leaving Taiwan unprepare  or UK's passing.
 5.  What had once seemed assured for Taiwan--a smooth transition and
 continued political and economic progress--is now clouded and uncertain.  No
 new leader of the stature and capability of Premier Sun has emerged and the
 group influencing events now is more of a hinderance than help to CCK.  None
 of them seem capable of stepping into his shoes and carrying on.
 6.  CCK set in motion the beginnings of a major social change on the
 island by reversing the polarization of mainlanders and native Taiwanese
 that had been a fact of life even before his father retreated to the island
 in 1949.  While not yet complete, the gradual process of evolutionary change
 bringing mainlander and Taiwanese closer together portends profound
 consequences by the end of the century.
 7.  Unfortunately, those advising CCK today are not only out of step
 with this new reality, but are representative of the very group who in the
 past most vehemently opposed change.  Many of them have counselled
 repression over reform fearful that they and their kind would have no place
 in the new Taiwan envisioned by CCK.  Moreover, CCK had the advantage of
 rapid economic progress that allowed for a slow and patient strategy of
 reform.  His successors will not have that luxury.  The economic downturn
 that promises to linger on for sometime is likely to increase the demands
 for quickening the pace of political reforms.  A resort to repressive
 measures would only make matters worse and heighten the appeal of the more
 radical opposition.
 8.  The military's role in politics also appears on the rise.  General
 Hau Pei-tsun, the Chief of Staff, and General Wang Ching-hsu, Director of
 NSB, appear positioned to play a larger role in the succession than
 previously expected.  Fortunately, both are able men and more enlightened
 than their civilian counterparts currently ensconced close to the
 President.  In the event of a near term succession crisis, both would have a
 large say in the outcome.  Some even speculate that General Hau might wish
 to become part of the civilian administration after CCK's death.  In any
 event, both men could prove decisive in choosing the shape and focus of a
 new government.  Although personally very capable, their power comes from a
 group--the military and security services--most desirous of stability and
 fearful of change.  Each may find it difficult to keep Taiwan moving on the
 course charted by CCK, Premier Sun and Y. S. Chiang.
 9.  CCK, to his credit, apparently recognizes that all is not well.
 Economic disarray and the prospects for opposition gains in the November
 elections have spurred reports that the President plans to reshuffle his
 Cabinet and bring in new advisors.  His choices and the overall complexion
 of the government and party apparatus that he puts his confidence in at this
 crucial stage will go a long way in determining whether his successors will
 be able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.  Will he continue to rely
 on old trusted civilian lieutenants looking to the past for guidance, or
 will he turn to a more forward looking group of younger reformers?  At this
 point, unfortunately, it is anybody's guess.

 DCI/NIO REGIONAL CONFERENCE
 SUDAN:  Over the last weekend, Sudanese Defense Minister
 Osman-Abdullah stated that Soviet military experts were en route to Sudan
 to recondition Soviet-supplied aircraft in the Sudanese air force
 inventory. Abdullah also noted that Sudan had asked the US to remove its
 military equipment in Port Sudan (the US has prepositioned $100 million
 in military equipment for CENTCOM contingency in Port Sudan).  (In fact,
 the Sudanese Government has as yet made no such request.)  Given the
 manifest desire of both military and civilian leaders to obtain more
 military hardware from all sources--and US unwillingness to provide arms
 usable against southern insurgents--it is likely that such a request will
 be made of the US to enhance Sudanese prospects of receiving Soviet and
 Libyan arms.  Such a move would also reflect civilian and military
 desires to be more "nonaligned."
 ANGOLA/SOUTH AFRICA:
 incursion may well have the real purpose of both helping Savimbi and
 sending a message to the MPLA and Soviets regarding extension of the air
 defense line southward, if not eastward.
 LIBERIA:  The situation in Liberia remains unsettled as some troops
 loyal      ad of State Samuel Doe have apparently decided to battle the
 supporters of the coup launched by former conmandina General Quiwonkpa.
 the situation in
 Liberia will likely remain very dangerous over the next few days as Doe
 and Qu iwonkp a vie for the support of Liberia's military.  Given the
 widespread unhappiness with Doe, we believe Quiwonkpa stands a good
 chance of emerging the victor.  Regardless of who wins, however, the
 United States will come under increased pressure from the Liberian

 Government for increased economic and military assistance.  Liberia's
 latest descent into chaos will also open new doors for Soviet and Libyan
 meddling.  A Quiwonkpa takeover would likely see the re-emergence in
 Liberia of a political left despite Quiwonkpa's personal pro-US and
 conservative views.  Numerous leftists who fled from Doe's regime would
 be likely to return and benefit from their opposition to Doe.
 LIBYA-CHAD:  Libyan leader Qadhafi has again focused his attention on
 Chad, and the recent heightened Libyan military activity in northern Chad
 suggests that Qadhafi is again prepared to initiate attacks against
 Chadian territory south of the 16th parallel.  During the next few weeks,
 we will probably see Chadian rebel probes against government garrisons
 near the 16th parallel, and Qadhafi may well commit some Libyan military
 assets in support of the rebels.  The Libyans could provide some air
 cover for rebel operations, as well as send Libyan armor or artillery
 units to back the rebel efforts.  The French are unlikely to stand up to
 these initial Libyan challenges, thus encouraging Qadhafi to prepare for
 a large-scale Libyan thrust into southern Chad.

 ANGOLAN REBEL LEADER APPEALS FOR U.S. AID TO REPEL SOVIETS
 By Wendy Schwegmann
 JAMBA, Angola, Nov 12, Reuter - Angolan rebel leader Jonas
 Savimbi, appealing for American help at what he called a
 crucial hour, has warned that delay could mean the loss of
 southern Africa to Soviet expansionism.
 Savimbi, leader of the Union for the Total Independence of
 Angola, addressed his troops yesterday at this remote bush
 headquarters in southern Angola to mark the 10th anniversary of
 Angolan, independence from Portugal.
 1 At this crucial hour, the Angolan... resistance... earnestly
 entreat Western governments, especially the government of the
 United States, not to disappoint once again the Angolan
 people... by materializing its solidarity with those who for 10
 years have fought alone," he said.
 Savimbi, whose estimated 30,000 guerrillas have been fighting
 the Marxist government in Luanda since independence, last month
 turned back a major offensive by Soviet-assisted troops of the
 MPLA government.
 Savimbi said the MPLA lost 2,700 troops with 3,000 wounded in
 the offensive plus 12 Soviet advisers and 26 Cubans killed. He
 put UNITA losses at 461 dead and 2,111 wounded.
 Journalists covering the rally yesterday, at which_Savimbi
 paraded what he estimated at more than 200 prisoners of war,
 flew back today to Pretoria from Jamba, which has no known
 communications links with-the outside world.
 The U.S.-Congress voted earlier this year to lift a
 nine-year-old ban on aid to anti-communist groups such as
 UNITA, but none has yet materialized and Secretary of State
 George Schutlz has opposed aid for the organization.
 Savimbi declared:  "At this hour all the hesitation of Western
 governments and mainly of the government of the United States
 of America led by President Ronald Reagan, could represent in
 the long range the handing over of all southern Africa to the
 Soviet empire."
 Dressed in an immaculate general's uniform, Savimbi told his
 troops: "The increasing number of sophisticated armaments that
 the Soviet Union has transferred to Angola... has turned our
 :ountry into an operational Soviet military base threatening
 :he already fragile stability of Central and Southern Africa.''
 Reporters who had previously visited Jamba, a sprawling
 :omplex of thatched dwellings and public buildings serving some
 .0,000 people, said UNITA's resources appeared strained.
 UNITA warned at the height of the latest offensive that Jamba
 tight fall.
 The parade of soldiers was considerably smaller than on
 previous occasions and vital units such as the medical corp
 'ere missing.
 Savimbi, a wizard of public relations as well as a master of
 uerrilla warfare, normally served chilled beer and South

 appeared scarce, the reporters said.
 Savimbi said the MPLA government had mortgaged Angola's
 sovereignty to military assistance from Moscow.   The number of
 foreign troops that support the MPLA has increased so much that
 it has been transformed into an instrument of political
 decision.''
 During the rally on a soccer field in Jamba, Savimbi paraded
 weaponry including a Soviet-made tank he said had been captured
 by UNITA forces.
