 CHINA
 All active members of the Chinese
 Politburo  participated  in  the official
 mourning ceremonies for Mao Tse-tung.
 The Chinese media listed them in order of
 rank, disclosing no changes in the pecking
 order.
 All but one of the country's 29 provin-
 cial leaders appeared in Peking during the
 ceremonies. The group includes several
 province chiefs who have been attacked as
 supporters of the ousted Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Missing from the ceremonies, however,
 were three national government officials
 who have been linked with Teng. Mao's
 leftist wife, Chiang Ching, has not been
 publicly cast in the role of widow, as were
 the wives of other deceased party leaders,
 but her wreath received special mention
 by the official news agency.
 All military region commanders
 appeared in Peking, contributing to the
 general show of unity much in evidence
 during the week.
 Peking has received messages of con-
 dolence from all the provinces and from
 all  II military regions. The Peking
 Military Region, the most important in
 this succession period, sent a long
 message pledging firm loyalty to the party
 Central Committee.
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 The Chinese have so far shown no signs
 of interest in better relations with the
 USSR. The Soviets were given last place
 when foreigners in Peking were allowed to
 pass by Mao's bier. The Chinese obituary
 on Mao took several swipes at the
 Soviets, and the Chinese media have con-
 tinued to criticize Soviet foreign and
 domestic policies.
 By Soviet standards, Moscow's treat-
 ment of Mao's death has been correct,
 and even somewhat conciliatory. An
 assessment of how the USSR may be
 looking at a post-Mao China appears on
 page 8.
 JAPAN    N151
 Prime Minister Miki and his opponents
 in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
 worked out another temporary com-
 promise this week, once again avoiding a
 showdown in the battle over party
 leadership. The new agreement involves:
 ? A new slate of cabinet and party
 officers untainted by the Lockheed af-
 fair.
 ? Convening the Diet to pass a
 number of pending fiscal bills.
 ? Miki's public pledge not to dis-
 solve the Diet and call a general elec-
 tion as long as legislative business was
 progressing smoothly.
 ? Miki's assent to call a special par-
 ty convention in October at which his
 tenure in office will be decided.
 Each side gave a little. Miki's op-
 ponents dropped their demand for his
 resignation prior to the opening of the
 Diet. In return, Miki limited his own
 maneuvering room by pledging not to dis-
 solve the Diet precipitately and agreeing
 to a special party convention next month.
 Miki's opponents will almost certainly
 press for rapid action on the pending bills.
 With the national election only three
 months away, they want to hold the party
 convention-and replace Miki-sooner
 rather than later next month.
 Miki's rivals also gained an important
 lever in the replacement of party secretary
 general Nakasone-Miki's only major
 ally-with Tsuneo Uchida, a follower of
 Finance Minister Ohira. The anti-Miki
 camp will use their control of this key par-
 ty job further to restrict Miki's options.
 Otherwise, the changes in the cabinet
 and party continue to reflect the balance
 of forces that weigh against the Prime
 Minister.
 Deputy Prime Minister Fukuda and
 Finance Minister Ohira, Miki's major
 rivals, are still firmly in place and the
 cabinet changes are unlikely to bring any
 significant shifts in foreign or domestic
 policies.
 Most important cabinet ministers have 25X1
 been retained with the exception of Kiichi
 Miyazawa, who has been replaced by
 Zentaro Kosaka as foreign minister.
 Miyazawa had recently irritated the
 Chinese and presumably Miki as well with
 his public criticism and candid comments
 on the lack of progress in Sino-Japanese
 relations. Miki may well have desired to
 replace him with a man like Kosaka-a
 former foreign minister and foreign af-
 fairs expert-who is an ardent supporter
 of  better  ties  with  Peking.

 LEBANON
 3-4
 The Syrians apparently intend to give
 Lebanese president-elect Sarkis a chance
 after he assumes office next week to work
 out a political settlement before they
 decide whether to launch a new military
 offensive. In talks with visiting Lebanese
 Christian and Muslim leaders over the
 past few weeks, President Asad and other
 Syrian officials reportedly have stressed
 the importance they attach to an orderly
 transfer of power in Lebanon on
 September 23.
 Asad has urged Christian leaders in
 particular to cooperate fully with the new
 government to ensure that Sarkis has suf-
 ficient stature and authority to conduct
 serious negotiations. Asad reportedly won
 the agreement last week of Camille
 Shamun, the most extreme of the major
 Christian leaders, to act with restraint in
 order to give Sarkis an opportunity to
 pursue negotiations. Shamun is said to
 have agreed to put no time limit onthese
 peace efforts. Asad, in an apparent
 attempt to reassure Shamun, agreed to
 continue joint preparations for a coor-
 dinated military offensive against the
 Palestinians and Lebanese leftists.
 Arab mediators advanced a new
 proposal this week for a tripartite meeting
 among Palestine Liberation Organization
 chief Yasir Arafat, Sarkis, and Syrian
 Prime Minister Khulayfawi to try to im-
 plement the accord concluded by the
 Syrians and Palestinians in late July.
 Earlier efforts to carry out the
 agreement-which calls for a general
 cease-fire,  Palestinian adherence to
 earlier restrictive agreements, and round-
 table                       negotiations    under
 Sarkis-foundered on Syrian suspicions
 that the Palestinians were trying to take
 advantage of the accord to rearm and for-
 tify their positions.
 The PLO-probably at the urging of
 Arafat and  other less radical
 fedayeen-and the Lebanese leftists
 accepted the mediators' proposal. The
 Christians, however, immediately raised
 objections that could delay or even kill the
 proposed meeting.
 The Syrians apparently also met with
 Arafat's troublesome lieutenant, Salah
 Khalaf, last weekend, presumably in an
 attempt to reach some sort of accom-
 modation. The meeting apparently did
 not go well. The Beirut press has
 speculated that the Syrians refused to
 accede to Khalaf's demand that they
 withdraw from Lebanon.
 Egypt is trying to get into the
 negotiating picture. It has invited Palesti-
 nian and Lebanese leaders-including
 Sarkis, Prime Minister Karami,
 Phalangist chief Jumayyil, and leftist
 Kamal Jumblatt-to come to Cairo for
 consultations. The Egyptians have had lit-
 tle success in blunting Syria's aims in
 Lebanon by supporting the leftists and
 Palestinians and apparently are now try-
 ing to undercut Syria by diplomatic
 means in anticipation of the Arab League
 summit meeting on Lebanon. The League
 has set October 18 as the starting date for
 SOUTH AFRICA 12dj'
 Most blacks in Soweto townsip out-
 side Johannesburg observed another
 three-day work stoppage this week, the se-
 cond such demonstration organized by
 militant student leaders within a month.
 This time, there was no backlash from
 nonparticipating blacks, and police, by
 making mass arrests, generally were able
 to avoid serious violence.
 About three quarters of the black work
 force in Johannesburg, including workers
 from the other major black township of
 Alexandra, were reported absent by the
 city's business firms. Roughly the same
 number of blacks stayed away last month,
 but this week's boycott appeared bet-

 ter organized. There are widespread ru-
 mors the blacks are contemplating fur-
 ther action.
 In Cape Town, demonstrations by the
 colored (mulatto) population declined this
 week, but-a work boycott began there on
 September 15 and the situation remains
 volatile. Since the recent outburst by the
 coloreds-the first since rioting against
 apartheid began last June-gun and am-
 munition sales to whites have been heavy,
 and some vigilante groups have been
 formed to protect white homes and
 schools. Whites and coloreds live in close
 proximity in the Cape Town area. There
 have been a number of incidents in which
 white civilians shot and killed coloreds
 and blacks, the first such instances since
 the troubles started in June.
 Minor disturbances occurred elsewhere
 in the country, including Durban and Port
 Elizabeth. The continuation of scattered
 outbreaks and the impending visit of
 Secretary Kissinger led high security of-
 ficials to meet during the week to discuss
 ways of controlling the disturbances.
 Last week, Prime Minister Vorster held
 a closed-door session with high party of-
 ficials at a special caucus in Pretoria. In
 public remarks this week, he strongly
 reiterated the position that blacks are to
 exercise their political rights solely
 through their tribal homelands, and that
 coloreds and Asians can discuss their
 grievances through the newly established
 cabinet council, a strictly advisory group
 that is to meet for the first time on
 September 24. Vorster gave no hint of be-
 ing prepared to make meaningful con- 25X1
 cessions to the nonwhites, despite press
 speculation recently that concessions were
 being considered.

 ANGOLA-PORTUGAL
 The foreign ministers of Portugal and
 Angola are to meet soon to work out
 details for re-establishing diplomatic ties,
 which were broken in April when Angola
 charged Portugal with supporting op-
 ponents of the Popular Movement.
 The announcement followed an ex-
 change of views in Luanda-held at
 Angolan President Neto's re-
 quest-between officials of Portugal's
 governing Socialist Party and Angola
 leaders. The visiting delegation found the
 Angolans eager to  restore formal
 relations; one member told the US em-
 bassy in Lisbon that ambassadors coul
 be in place by the end of September. Por-
 tugal plans to send a team of economic
 specialists to Luanda soon.
 The Angolans apparently are anxious
 to speed the return of Portuguese
 technicians. They also clearly hope that
 Portugal will help them establish broader
 links with Europe and other contacts that
 would facilitate Angola's admission to the
 UN.
 Angola's economy  needs  Western
 technology and markets if it is to revive
 quickly. The country's lucrative commer-
 cial agriculture and diamond mining, for
 example, need access to the West before
 they can return to normal operations.
 Members of the Portuguese delegation
 came away with the impression that
 Neto's political strength and his self-con-
 fidence are growing. In the months im-
 mediately  following  the  Popular
 Movement's victory in the civil war last
 February, Neto and the Movement's
 other political leaders-mostly mulat-
 tos-were kept from establishing a policy
 of nonalignment by black radicals in the
 party's military hierarchy. The radicals
 appear to have forced the break with
 Lisbon in April.
 During recent months Neto has been
 considerably more visible and vocal than
 he was earlier in the year. He has given
 many speeches and interviews in which he
 has stressed multiracialism and nonalign-
 ment and denounced party disunity.
 Neto's efforts to broaden his country's
 international contacts are not likely to go
 unchallenged by radicals in the Popular
 Movement, who have close ties with the
 Cubans and Soviets who are providing the
 regime vital military and other assistance.
 Neto, a strong nationalist, probably
 would like to reduce the Cuban presence
 substantially, but he is in no position to do
 so while present military and economic
 conditions prevail in Angola, and he lacks
 other sources of assistance. A substantial
 Cuban presence-probably on the order
 of at least 10,000 troops and ad-
 visers-appears likely for some time.
 We now estimate Soviet grain produc-
 tion this year at 200-million metric tons,
 up 5-million tons from our estimate in
 early August. Because of a near-record
 lateness in ripening and harvesting, the
 final crop remains uncertain.
 A crop of 200-million tons would ex-
 ceed last year's by some 60-million tons
 and would be second only to the record
 crop of 222.5-million tons in 1973.
 Cool, wet weather in much of European
 Russia throughout the summer has
 delayed harvesting. By September 1, only
 52 percent of the area sown to grain had
 been harvested, compared to a five-year
 average of 62 percent. Weather conditions
 during the balance of the harvest will play
 a larger than usual role in determining the
 size and quality of the crop.
 Time is growing short for completing
 the harvest on the remaining 65-million
 hectares of grain crops. There is con-
 siderable. risk even before October 1 of
 severe frost or snow that could reduce
 yields in areas with relatively short grow-
 ing seasons. Light frosts have already oc-
 curred in West Siberia. Continuing rains
 during the harvest and an early onset of
 winter could lead to losses if the pace of
 the harvest does not quicken.
 Grain quality may be a problem in any
 event. A large share of the cereal grains
 harvested in European USSR is expected
 to be unsuitable for flour milling because
 of wetness. This problem is intensified in
 "wet" years by the shortage of high-
 capacity mechanical dryers to dry the
 grain before storage.
 If favorable prospects hold, Soviet
 grain purchases abroad should not exceed
 14-million tons, a little more than half the
 amount bought in 1975. A Soviet grain
 trade official implied last month that the
 USSR's grain purchases would total
 about 13.5-million tons. Purchases of this
 size would cost roughly $3.5 billion, com-
 pared with the nearly $4.5 billion spent for
 grain last year.
 So far this year, the Soviets have
 bought 10.5-million tons of grain-5-
 million tons of wheat and 5.5-million tons
 of feed-grain-and 2-million tons of
 soybeans. Of this amount, about 9-million
 tons will come from the US and the
 remainder from Canada, Australia,
 Brazil, and New Zealand. The USSR is
 still obligated to take 1.6-million tons
 more of US grain to meet the 6-million-
 ton minimum called for in the first year of
 the US-USSR grain agreement.

 POLAND -2 6 , 1
 I,/
 Political caution has again won out
 over economic considerations in Poland.
 The party leadership, still unsteady after
 the June riots, has apparently decided not
 to risk any price increases on basic food
 stuffs for at least another year.
 The regime has backed away from
 Prime Minister Jaroszewicz's proposal in
 July that prices for meat would go up this
 year by about 35 percent. Thus, for the se-
 cond time this summer, a proposal by
 Jaroszewicz for price increases has been
 scrapped-a serious embarrassment for
 any East European leader.
 Although his standing with the public
 and possibly within the party is weaker
 than before June, party leader Gierek is
 still calling the shots. On September 3, he
 gave Polish workers the good news that
 301
 the regime would implement price
 changes on food only after very long
 study. He announced the creation of five
 commissions, one of which is to deal with
 meat prices, that have at least a year to
 carry out their investigations. A Central
 Committee plenum approved this plan on
 September 9.
 By creating these commissions, the
 leadership is clearly trying to gain time to
 bring serious, tension-causing economic
 problems under control. Meat is still in
 extremely short supply, and there are only
 limited possibilities for alleviating the
 shortages over the short run. During the
 first six months of this year, the govern-
 ment cut back meat exports by about 35
 percent; its need for hard currency
 suggests it is not likely to reduce them any
 further.
 Gierek announced at the plenum that
 Romania and Yugoslavia Coordinate Strategy
 During their talks in Yugoslavia last
 week, presidents Ceausescu and Tito
 evidently concentrated on coordinating
 strategy within the communist movement
 and on scotching speculation that there
 are differences between them.
 Tito,                                i
 went a out to show
 a   ugos aura and Romania have no
 disagreements. He greeted Ceausescu at
 the airport and saw him off, despite
 Yugoslav protocol rules that exempt him
 from such duties. The two reportedly held
 lengthy discussions that emphasized their
 "identity and closeness of views" on all
 questions of mutual interest.
 One highlight was Tito's signing of a
 "joint declaration" that closely follows
 Ceausescu's ten principles of national in-
 dependence and noninterference in inter-
 nal affairs. The Yugoslavs had resisted
 earlier Romanian requests that they sign
 such a document.
 In the declaration, the two presidents
 expressed  their determination  to
 cooperate closely in pursuing their in-
 dependent courses. They also:
 ? Praised the recent European com-
 munist conference, but voiced anxiety
 about the attempts of some countries
 to "legalize" the right to interfere in
 the internal affairs of others.
 ? Welcomed the Helsinki accords,
 but noted the lack of concrete steps to
 implement them and stressed the need
 for positive achievements at the
 follow-on meeting in Belgrade next
 year.
 ? Reaffirmed their intention to
 develop multilateral as well as bilateral
 cooperation in the Balkans.
 ? Emphasized nonaligned issues,
 praising the Colombo summit for
 renouncing "all forms of foreign
 domination and exploitation."
 The two leaders also reiterated stan-
 dard pledges of "all-around assistance" to
 national liberation movements and called
 for "democratization" of the UN, dis-
 solution of military blocs, and the
 creation of a new international eco-
 nomic  and  political  order.
 some meat would be imported but ad-
 mitted that demand still would not be
 satisfied. One official earlier estimated
 that 100,000 tons of meat will be imported
 by   the  end  of  the  year.
 EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
 The EC monetary committee agreed
 September 10 to back Italy's proposal for
 a change in International Monetary Fund
 gold sales policy, but refused to ask for a
 postponement of the auction held on
 September 15.
 IMF directors from EC countries will
 ask the Fund executive committee to con-
 sider possibilities for "being more flexible
 in techniques of selling gold." Changes
 might involve delaying the scheduling of
 future auctions, increasing the time
 between  auctions,  or  reducing  the
 amount   of  gold   offered  in  each
 auction.
 Italy, which still has relatively large
 gold reserves, is asking the IMF to hold
 gold auctions less frequently because of
 the depressing effects they have on world
 gold prices. The Italians have just com-
 pleted a renegotiation of their gold-
 backed loan from West Germany and,
 because of past declines in the price of
 gold, took the option of reducing the
 amount of their loan rather than in-
 creasing their gold collateral.
 France, with the second largest gold
 reserve in the EC, and the UK were Italy's
 strongest supporters at the committee
 meeting. West Germany, which has the
 largest gold holdings in Europe, has ex-
 pressed little concern about the fall in gold
 prices.
 The gold issue will be discussed at the
 IMF meeting in Manila early next month.
 If the EC receives support from some in-
 dustrial and developing countries, it will
 increase the pressure on the US to agree
 to a more flexible scheduling of future
 IMF gold sales.

 PORTUGAL 4Z- ~~
 Prime  Minister  Soares,  in  a
 long-awaited economic speech on
 September 9, painted a gloomy picture of
 Portugal's economic situation and talked
 of the tough measures that will be needed
 to resolve the country's problems. The
 speech, however, was short on the im-
 mediate measures that many had hoped
 would be announced.
 The government does appear ready to
 take the first steps toward regaining some
 control of the economy. In most cases,
 however, the Socialist minority govern-
 ment must still translate promises into
 legislation and prove to the public it has
 the power and the determination to en-
 force the laws.
 Soares cited the restoration of labor
 discipline and worker productivity as top
 priorities for economic recovery. Specific
 bills are nearly completed and will be sub-
 mitted to the legislature when it reopens
 in October.
 The Prime Minister expressed con-
 fidence that Portugal's dwindling foreign
 currency reserves will be strengthened as a
 result of increased assistance from the
 West. Soares may be hoping that foreign
 support will enable him to get the
 economy moving and permit him to avoid
 harsher austerity measures.
 The speech was probably welcomed by
 most Portuguese, who appear willing to
 accept some sacrifice as the price for end-
 ing the political and economic chaos of
 the past two years. The two parties to the
 right of the Socialists would have
 preferred an even stronger stand, but gave
 Soares high marks for a "positive and
 courageous" presentation.
 Soares blamed the Communists for the
 indiscipline in Portugal's labor unions, for
 the sorry state of the nationalized
 businesses, and for the excesses of
 agrarian reform. The Communists
 reacted with predictable sharpness, but
 stopped short of declaring outright op-
 position to the government. They can be
 expected to use their influence in labor to
 incite protests against specific measures,
 but they probably lack enough support to
 mount the "massive resistance" that party
 leader Cunhal has promised.
 Soares is depending on President
 Eanes' authority over the armed forces to
 turn back any Communist challenges and
 may have toughened his speech to main-
 tain good relations with the President.
 Eanes, whose own political future may de-
 pend on the success of the Soares govern-
 ment, is apparently growing impatient
 with the government's slowness in enac-
 ting reforms and with Soares' inability to
 keep peace between Marxist and social
 democratic factions in his cabinet and in
 the Socialist Party.

 GREECE-TURKEY
 The International Court of Justice on
 September 11 rejected the Greek appeal
 for a temporary ban on Turkish oil ex-
 ploration in disputed Aegean waters. It
 also rejected a Turkish request to drop the
 case altogether, leaving open the possibili-
 ty of a later ruling on the substance of the
 case.
 The Greek government has tried to put
 the best face on the situation by stressing
 that the decision was expected in light of
 the earlier UN Security Council resolu-
 tion that urged bilateral talks before
 either side resorted to the Court. Athens
 also took comfort from the Court's
 refusal to drop the case completely.
 Except for radical leftist Andreas
 Papandreou, the Greek domestic opposi-
 tion has not tried to exploit the setback,
 and the government seems not to have
 suffered any immediate political damage.
 Prime Minister Caramanlis doubtless is
 concerned, however, that such reverses
 could gradually erode support, especially
 within the military, for his circumspect
 policy toward the Turks.
 The Turks, who have refused to
 recognize the Court's jurisdiction in the
 dispute, expressed satisfaction with the
 rejection of the Greek petition but did not
 comment on the Court's refusal to drop
 the case. Foreign Minister Caglayangil on
 September 11 said he hoped Greece will
 now negotiate with Turkey in a "realistic"
 and "constructive" way. Prior to depart-
 ing for New York to attend the UN
 General Assembly meetings, Caglayangil
 said he would "probably" meet with
 Greek Foreign Minister Bitsios there later
 this month as had been agreed in August.
 He cautioned, however, that the Court's
 decision had created a new situation and
 that new contacts are required before such
 a meeting could take place.
 The Greeks appear to have been
 sobered by the Court's decision and
 probably are resigned to proceeding with
 talks. The Turks are in a stronger position
 now to put pressure on the Greeks to con-
 sider proposals such as joint exploration
 of disputed waters. Opposition pressures
 or the prospect of political gain could
 tempt the weak Demirel government to  25X1
 set unacceptable preconditions for the
 talks or to pursue a hard line once they
 are under way.
 EC: Differences with Turkey
 EC and Turkish officials, meeting in government dec
 government dec
 Ankara last week, were unable to settle
 differences resulting from Turkey's desire
 to improve the terms of its association
 agreement with the Community. For its
 part, the EC hopes technical-level
 meetings early next month will be produc-
 tive and that a formal association meeting
 can take place in mid-October as sched-
 uled. Real progress may not be possible,
 however, until after the West Ger-
 man national election because of Bonn's
 firm line of the question of migrant
 workers.
 The EC's inability to meet Turkish
 demands will complicate negotiations set
 for this month on Greek entry into the
 Community, since the Nine have tried to
 "balance" an agreement with Greece with
 a positive gesture toward Turkey. Unless
 a solution acceptable to Turkey is found,
 the EC would lose whatever leverage it
 has in persuading Turkey to be more
 forthcoming on a settlement of the
 Aegean and Cyprus questions.
 When the EC announced last July its
 proposals for augmenting the existing
 agreement with Turkey, the Ankara
 lared that it would not
 meet with the Nine until they came up
 with a better offer.
 Turkey is bargaining for improved
 access for its agricultural goods, increased
 financial aid, and agreement on a date
 when Turkish workers will be allowed free
 movement within the Community. EC of-
 ficials believe the Turks will eventually
 accept the offers regarding financial aid
 and entry for agricultural goods, but
 recognize that additional concessions on
 migrant workers will probably be
 necessary.
 West Germany's position on migrant
 labor has been the major stumbling block.
 Although committed to preserving
 Turkish ties to Western Europe, the West
 Germans contend that both domestic
 economic and political considerations rule
 out any plan that would permit a substan-
 tial increase in the number of non-EC
 citizens working in the Federal Republic.
 As an alternative, Bonn has promoted the
 idea of direct West German investment in
 Turkey to ease unemployment there and
 reduce pressure for Turkish emigration.

 MEXICO
 The Mexican government announced
 on September 12 that it will support the
 peso at a level 37 percent below its
 pre-float dollar level. The new level is just
 above 5 cents; before the float the peso
 had been pegged at eight cents.
 The move is an attempt to eliminate
 public uncertainties and to reassure the
 people that the government is in control of
 the situation. By not referring to its action
 as a repegging of the peso, the govern-
 ment hopes to keep open its options for
 further adjusting the value of the currency
 if the current exchange rate becomes un-
 supportable. Since the public impression
 is that a new parity has been set, however,
 future changes in the peso's value may
 lead to a further outcry.
 Prices of goods and services in Mexico
 skyrocketed after the peso devaluation.
 Department stores quickly increased
 prices for consumer durables by 20 per-
 cent. Most other retailers have followed
 suit. Basic food costs are reportedly up 20
 percent since the float started and meat
 prices increased even more.
 Government inspectors, who in the past
 have not been noted for their zeal, have
 started to crack down on businesses sub-
 ject to government price controls. They
 reportedly have closed 38 department
 stores and four supermarkets in Mexico
 City, Some 100 other businesses face
 prosecution for ignoring government price
 controls.
 The early establishment of a supported
 level for the peso is a surprise because
 Mexican officials had been saying that an
 extended float was necessary. President
 Echeverria probably gave in to pressures
 from business and labor, which were hav-
 ing a difficult time adjusting to the
 floating exchange rates.
 Echeverria's apparent yielding to
 pressure raises doubts about how far his
 government is prepared to go in con-
 trolling inflation. His policy will be
 clearer when the government announces
 new official price levels and the size of the
 coming federal workers' wage increase.
 The increase to the federal workers will
 serve as the basis for scheduled wage
 negotiations this fall between private in-
 dustry and the major labor unions.
 CANADA  5_ 5S
 The cabinet shuffle Canadian Prime
 Minister Trudeau announced earlier this
 week is the first step in a Liberal Party
 campaign to refurbish the party's image,
 but falls short of the sort of change needed
 to end the malaise of the Trudeau govern-
 ment. The shuffle follows public opinion
 polls that show Liberal Party support at
 its lowest point since 1958.
 Two key cabinet portfolios-Finance
 and Energy, Mines, and Resources-are
 unchanged,  indicating  that Trudeau
 remains committed to wage and price
 controls and to a Canada-first policy on
 energy and raw materials. Allan
 MacEachen was shifted from External
 Affairs to his old job of government
 leader in the House of Commons, un-
 doubtedly to make use of his considerable
 parliamentary skills.
 The new Minister for External Affairs,
 Donald Jamieson, headed the Ministry of
 Industry, Trade, and Commerce. Describ-
 ed as congenial, witty, and an "enlighted
 pragmatist," Jamieson can be expected to
 hew closely to the government's line on
 economic affairs. He has in the past ad-
 vocated strong trade ties with the US as
 well as expanded commercial links with
 other countries. His appointment could
 signal some softening of Canada's in-
 creasingly nationalist approach toward
 25X1
 Chile: No Signs of Moderation 5-'7~ c
 The military government, which mark-
 ed its third anniversary on September 11,
 shows no signs of moderating its tough in-
 ternal security practices or making any
 substantial concessions in the area of
 human rights.
 In his anniversary speech, President
 Pinochet reiterated the regime's hard-line
 views and indicated that new decrees
 would soon be issued further restricting
 the "recessed" political parties. The new
 measures are clearly aimed at the opposi-
 tion Christian Democrats, but the church
 and independent labor leaders, whose
 criticism has stung the regime, may also
 be in for harsher treatment.
 The President made public several
 measures to be incorporated into a new
 constitution that will institutionalize the
 authoritarian practices now being employ-
 ed. The guarantees of human rights
 promised by Pinochet at the OAS meeting
 in Santiago in June received scant atten-
 tion, and security forces will probably
 continue to ignore them. The Interior
 Ministry has announced that 205 political
 prisoners are being released, but the state
 of siege has been extended for another six
 months.
 Pinochet's tough stand suggests there is
 little room for flexibility in accom-
 modating a visit by the working group of
 the UN Human Rights Commission; its
 scheduled trip to Chile last year was
 abruptly canceled by Pinochet. Talks
 between the two sides appear to be
 stalemated, and the Commission's
 forthcoming report to the UN will most
 likely again be highly critical of the
 military regime.
 On economic matters, the Chilean
 leader gave no hint in his speech that he is
 considering any policy changes, although
 an acrimonious debate reportedly is under
 way in the government over the social
 costs of the harsh austerity program.
 Despite some spotty improvements in
 economic conditions, the US embassy
 sees no overall recovery.

 Soviet leaders will probably try to improve relations with
 China now that Mao Tse-lung is dead. They will make no fun-
 damental concessions, however, and appear skeptical that
 reconciliation is possible.
 The USSR Looks at China After Mao
 the USSR.
 Soviet coverage of internal Chinese
 developments since Teng Hsiao-ping's fall
 has not been entirely consistent. The bulk
 of it suggests that the Soviets see the
 leftists as having made some gains, but
 not enough to overtake the moderates'
 majority support in the party, the gov-
 ernment bureaucracy, and the army.
 A Conciliatory Approach
 For a number of reasons, the Soviets
 are likely to make some conciliatory-
 sounding gestures to China in the coming
 days and weeks. Moscow will want:
 ? To impress the communist world
 that it bears no inherent hostility
 toward China and that it is ready, as
 always, to repair the unfortunate
 damage  to  Sino-Soviet  relations
 caused by Mao's implacable hostility.
 ? To indicate to anybody in China
 who is interested that it genuinely
 wants to ameliorate relations.
 ? To avoid giving ammunition to
 those in China who will argue for a
 continuation of Mao's Soviet policy.
 ? To determine whether any im-
 provement in relations is possible.
 General Secretary Brezhnev probably
 feels some compulsion to demonstrate he
 has done everything possible to improve
 Soviet relations with China. One of the
 reasons behind Khrushchev's ouster in
 1964 was his mishandling of the China
 problem, specifically his failure to do all
 he could to ameliorate relations with
 Peking.
 The first signs of the conciliatory ap-
 proach have already begun to manifest
 themselves. The Soviet Central Com-
 mittee has sent a message of condolence
 to its Chinese counterpart. The message
 itself was correct and perfunctory, but it
 It has long been almost an article of
 faith among Soviet China-watchers that
 the death of Mao Tse-tung would not
 result in any early or significant improve-
 ment in Sino-Soviet relations.
 In public, the Soviets say that Mao has
 institutionalized a legacy of "Maoism"
 that has as one of its cardinal points a
 hostile attitude toward the Soviet Union.
 In private, they have also mentioned
 natural differences between the two
 nations that supersede personalities, as
 well as the real differences and hostilities
 that have grown over the years. History,
 they seem to be saying, cannot be easily
 swept away.
 Moscow's skepticism, while both pru-
 dent and seemingly realistic, has not com-
 pletely driven out a certain sense of
 hopeful expectation, particularly among
 Soviet leaders.
 For them, the rhetoric about the per-
 nicious influence of Mao has been
 grounded in the conviction that it was in-
 deed Mao who was to a great degree
 responsible for the current state of
 Sino-Soviet relations. They see his death
 as providing the USSR its first significant
 opportunity to alter the course of those
 relations and are not going to let that op-
 portunity slip by.
 Soviet leaders want first and foremost
 to minimize the possibility of hostilities
 with a nuclear neighbor, 800 million
 strong, that shares a border over 7,200
 kilometers (4,500 miles) long.
 They also hope to dilute the advantages
 that their even more dangerous enemy,
 the US, has derived from its connection
 with China. They would like to forestall,
 if possible, further normalization of
 Sino-US relations.
 Moscow also wants to contain China's
 challenge both to Soviet pre-eminence
 within the world communist movement
 and to Moscow's pretensions to natural
 leadership of national liberation
 movements in the third world.
 Soviet Preparations
 In the months prior to Mao's death,
 Soviet propaganda played up Mao's role
 in China's anti-Sovietism more than ever
 before. The Soviets quickly rehabilitated
 Chou En-lai's reputation after he died and
 were careful not to say many negative
 things about Teng Hsiao-ping when he
 was riding high. More recently, they have
 commented gingerly on Premier Hua
 Kuo-feng. Between the lines, the theme
 has been that a new beginning was possi-
 ble after Mao.
 Soviet propaganda also revived the
 theme that there are individuals in China,
 particularly among the military, less
 hostile than others to the USSR.
 This theme is predicated not only on the
 assumption that such factions exist in
 China, but that the USSR, by openly
 acknowledging their existence, is prepared
 to be helpful.
 The evidence that has accumulated over
 the years suggests that Moscow does not
 have any special insight into the issues and
 personalities at stake in the Chinese
 succession struggle. The Soviets seem to
 hope that China's moderates will best its
 leftists.
 Moscow realizes that Chinese foreign
 policy probably would be easier to
 counter should the leftists come out on
 top, but the Soviets also seem to believe
 that the leftists do not appreciate the
 USSR's military might and would be in-
 clined to adopt a belligerent policy toward

 was the first public party-to-party contact
 between the Soviets and the Chinese since
 1966.
 On September 13, two Politburo
 members,  First Deputy Premier
 Mazurov, who presumably is standing in
 for the ailing Kosygin, and Foreign
 Minister Gromyko, headed the group of
 Soviets who went to the Chinese embassy
 in Moscow to sign the condolence book
 for Mao. Although both men are primari-
 ly associated with the government, not the
 party, the Soviets referred to the party as
 well as to the governmental ties of both.
 Only one Politburo member, Mazurov,
 signed the condolence book for Premier
 Chou En-lai in January. Propaganda
 broadcasts to China are beginning to
 recall past Soviet aid to China and to
 reiterate Moscow's desire to normalize
 relations.
 On September 14, China rejected the
 condolence message, reportedly because it
 came from a communist party with which
 China no longer maintains relations.
 China's rejection of the message will un-
 doubtedly give the Soviets pause, but is
 unlikely to do more than delay additional
 conciliatory gestures toward the Chinese.
 The Soviets are already beginning to
 tone down their anti-Chinese propaganda
 and stress instead their desire for better
 relations. The Soviets will also spread the
 word privately that the USSR hopes for
 an improvement in Sino-Soviet relations.
 The muting of the propaganda probably
 will continue for some time, even if there
 is no immediate response from the
 Chinese.
 Recalling their own concerns when
 Stalin died, the Soviets publicly-perhaps
 privately also-may try to reassure the
 Chinese that the USSR does not plan any
 military adventure during the succession
 period. The Soviets may reissue to their
 forces along the border a long-standing
 order to bend over backwards to avoid in-
 cidents. Many of the border forces are
 now engaged in the annual effort to bring
 in the harvest, but any planned out-
 of-the-ordinary postharvest exercise ac-
 tivity might be canceled or postponed.
 The possibility of mixed signals on the
 border is considerable, however, since the
 Soviets themselves will be apprehensive
 that the Chinese-for some unforeseeable
 internal political purpose-may make
 trouble there. Hence, the Soviets are like-
 ly to heighten their vigilance along the
 border, including maintaining the in-
 creased level of aerial reconnaissance they
 began the day of Mao's death.
 After the internal situation in China
 clarifies somewhat, we expect that the
 Soviets will privately approach the
 Chinese about the possibility of a
 high-level meeting. The Soviets will set no
 preconditions for such a meeting and
 probably will be amenable to Chinese
 suggestions about the level, the time, and
 the place of such a meeting.
 The Soviets probably have other
 proposals ready to present to the Chinese.
 Since 1969 they have made numerous ef-
 forts to persuade China to mute the
 propaganda war and to increase trade and
 scientific and cultural contacts. China's
 rejection of previous Soviet proposals is
 unlikely to deter the Kremlin from offer-
 ing them up again because the Soviets
 believe that there are influential Chinese
 to whom these proposals are attractive.

 high-level meeting, Moscow may propose
 reviving the long-stalemated border talks.
 These talks have been the most significant
 point of contact between the two sides
 since 1969, and they have not always dealt
 solely with the border problem.
 Moscow may offer to upgrade its level
 of representation at the talks. The current
 Soviet negotiator Ilichev,  who has been
 associated with the most sterile period of
 the talks, is not as high ranking as the
 negotiator who began the talks. Ilichev
 has been absent from Peking since May
 1975.
 Moscow could use revived border talks
 to present to Mao's successors some of
 the same proposals prepared for a
 high-level meeting; it could also make new
 offers to resolve the border problem. Any
 such offer probably would be somewhat
 more generous than the last Soviet offers
 in 1973 and 1974.
 The Soviets are not going to make any
 fundamental concession to China,
 however, and they will stick to their posi-
 tion that Peking has to show more flex-
 ibility. In any event, the Soviets will not
 engage in serious negotiations on the
 border problem until they think there is a
 Chinese leadership in place that has suf-
 ficient authority to make an agreement
 stick.
 If China fails to respond to any of the
 USSR's proposals but takes no additional
 hostile measures, the Soviet approach
 toward China probably will revert
 gradually to what it was before Mao died.
 If, however, China adopts a more
 belligerent posture toward the USSR, the
 Soviets will be quick to show their tough
 side.
 The Soviets almost certainly have con-
 tingency plans to deal with the prospect of
 a post-Mao leadership that is hostile to
 the USSR. Should China's hostility be
 manifested only in the propaganda arena,
 the Soviets probably would respond in
 kind. Should China start trouble on the     25X1
 border, however, Moscow's retaliation
 would probably be swifter and more im-
 pressive than it was in 1969.
 The government has taken another major step toward
 political liberalization. A bicameral parliament, to be elected
 before next June, is to be empowered to make basic con-
 stitutional changes.
 Ox ci ~ Spain: Government Program Announced
 Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez
 took a major step toward accommodating
 opposition demands on September 10
 when he announced the general lines of his
 government's reform program.
 In a televised statement following
 cabinet approval of the program, Suarez
 said that all major reforms-such as
 overhauling the state-run labor organiza-
 tion, granting greater autonomy to the
 regions, and working out the power
 relationship between the executive and
 legislative branches-would be left to a
 bicameral legislature elected by direct,
 universal suffrage before next June. In
 effect, the new parliament, which will in-
 clude the democratic opposition, will be a
 constituent assembly.
 Suarez' program incorporates several
 other concepts called for by the opposi-
 tion as guarantees of democratic progress:
 ? Abolition of the seats for 40
 members of the current parliament ap-
 pointed for life by General Franco.
 ? Some form of proportional
 representation.
 ? Regional representation in the up-
 per house.
 ? Lower house initiative for con-
 stitutional reforms.
 The reaction of the opposition and the
 Spanish press to Suarez' proposals has
 been broadly positive, though the left in
 its public statements has been picking at
 the flaws it sees in the program. "As the
 opposition, we have to criticize it," one
 Socialist leader explained to the US em-
 bassy. The opposition has specifically
 complained that it was given no formal
 voice in drawing up the program and that
 the government is still committed to
 working through the "moribund" in-
 stitutions of the Franco era.
 Other opposition concerns about the
 liberalization process have concentrated
 on the election law that the government
 will soon draw up. The left fears the law
 may allow Francoist local government of-
 ficials to manipulate the election.
 Preparing Spain for the legislative elec-
 tion while keeping the rest of the reform
 program on track will be the principal
 role of the Suarez government. So far,
 Suarez has published a draft law that
 would amend the constitution and es-
 tablish a bicameral legislature. The law is
 to be submitted to parliament and subse-
 quently in some form to a referendum.
 Suarez is then to issue the election law by
 decree.
 The major obstacle will be getting the
 reform program approved by two thirds
 of the current, rightist-dominated parlia-
 ment. This means, in effect, asking the
 political right to vote itself out of power

 after nearly 40 years, but the government
 seems optimistic.
 Support of the Military
 In order to strengthen his hand against
 the right, Suarez-strongly backed by
 King Juan Carlos-has sought prior ap-
 proval from the military hierarchy. On
 September 8, the Prime Minister called a
 meeting of all senior Spanish military of-
 ficers and presented them with the details
 of his program. The generals reportedly
 assured him he could rely on their sup-
 port.
 Relations with opposition Improve
 Relations between government and op-
 position seem to have improved
 dramatically since Suarez began meeting
 with leftist leaders, but legalization of the
 Communist Party remains a major point
 of contention. The government-pointing
 to military inflexibility-maintains that
 its hands are tied.
 There have been recent signs, however,
 that the Communist-dominated Workers'
 Commissions may soon be legalized by
 decree law along with other opposition
 labor unions. The government could
 rationalize such a move on the grounds
 that the Workers' Commissions are
 neither political nor overtly Communist.
 By allowing the Communists to work
 openly in labor, the government would
 hope to blunt opposition demands for
 legalizing the party and at the same time
 gain valuable good will from labor as
 collective bargaining contracts affecting
 some two million workers come up for
 renewal this fall.
 The Challenge of Regionalism
 The government also faces a potentially
 serious challenge this fall from regional
 separatists who will probably be disap-
 pointed by Suarez' decision to shelve
 regional questions for the time being.
 In the troubled Basque provinces, there
 have been widespread strikes and
 demonstrations following the killing of a
 young Basque worker by the Spanish
 Civil Guard on September 8. Almost
 200,000 workers in the region have walk-
 ed out in protest, and there have been
 numerous clashes between demonstrators
 and police. Tensions remain high in the
 region, and another incident could touch
 off major disorders.
 In Catalonia, the separatist issue does
 not often manifest itself so dramatically,
 but in many respects it poses a more
 serious problem. Whereas the Basque
 culture appears to be dying out and the
 push for independence there-as distinct
 from general discontent-is led by a
 relatively small group of extremists, the
 Catalan culture is thriving. Some 80 per-
 cent of the people in Catalonia speak the
 native language as opposed to about 20
 percent in the Basque area, and Catalan
 nationalists enjoy widespread popular
 support.
 The issue of Catalan nationalism is a
 matter of particular concern to the
 Spanish  military, whose backing is
 critically important to the Madrid govern-
 ment during the present transition period.
 Senior military leaders, preoccupied with
 maintaining  Spain's  territorial  unity,
 reportedly consider Catalan separatism
 one of the greatest problems facing Spain
 today.                        25X1

 Swedish voters will decide on September 19 and 20
 whether the country's brand of democratic socialism has gone
 far enough. The election campaign has been contested almost
 solely on domestic issues.
 Swedish Election: Taxes and Big Government
 Swedish voters, who go to the polls on
 September 19 and 20, will be asked to
 decide whether it is time to check the
 spread of centralized government, which
 the opposition believes threatens to
 permeate nearly all levels of society under
 the ruling Social Democrats.
 Parliament  now  is  divided equally
 between socialists and Communists on the
 one hand, and nonsocialists on the other.
 Each bloc controls  175 seats. Prime
 Minister Olof Palme heads a minority
 Social Democratic government with 156
 seats in the 350-member parliament. He
 relies on the support of the 19 Communist
 deputies to block challenges by the three
 nonsocialist opposition parties.
 The Social Democrats, in government
 almost continuously for 44 years, have
 suffered declining popularity in recent
 years. Along with their Communist allies,
 the Social Democrats have trailed the
 combined opposition parties in polls all
 year. If this dissatisfaction is translated
 into votes, the Social Democrats will
 either be forced into opposition or have to
 share power in some way with the non-
 socialist parties.
 In less than a century, Sweden has
 grown from one of Europe's poorest coun-
 tries to one of the world's richest. Its stan-
 dard of living and per capita income are
 among the highest in the world. Swedish
 levels of health and medical care are un-
 surpassed, and poverty and illiteracy are
 practically nonexistent. The few minority
 groups-primarily the Lapps and foreign
 workers-are accorded treatment equal
 to the Swedish majority.
 These achievements have made Sweden
 a model for many nations, and nearly all
 Swedes recognize the benefits that have
 accrued  from  successive  Social
 Democratic governments. Much of the
 Social  Democratic  legislation has
 originated in  Sweden's central labor
 federation, which is the party's single

 most powerful source of support. Many
 Swedes believe, however, that conditions
 are good enough and that additional
 sacrifices-increased  taxation  and
 government involvement in private af-
 fairs-would offset the current benefits.
 The pervasiveness of the government's
 role in national life-and the attendant

 SECRET
 cost in both material terms and in the en-
 croachments on personal freedom-has
 begun to dampen enthusiasm for granting
 a mandate that might lead to extending
 the system even further.
 High taxes, which make the system
 work, are a major campaign issue. A
 Swedish worker with an annual income of
 $10,000 pays nearly one third in income
 taxes; a businessman earning $36,000 an-
 nually retains only about $13,000; an ex-
 ecutive in the $350,000 bracket receives
 less than 20 percent of his salary after
 taxes.
 The Social Democrats are proposing a
 3-percent tax hike, the Liberals and the
 Centrists favor a 1.5 percent rise, while
 only the Conservatives oppose any in-
 crease. The fact that none of the parties is
 trying to reduce the tax load, which would
 mean a drop in social benefits, reflects
 majority support for the existing social
 welfare system.
 No longer able to divert public atten-
 tion from Sweden's own problems by es-
 pousing causes that are not vital to the
 nation's  interests- Vietnam  or
 democracy in Spain, for example-the
 government has had to concentrate on
 defending its domestic policies. This led to
 a substantial loss of votes in 1973 and
 plagues the government's present cam-
 paign. This year, the only foreign policy
 issue to emerge is aid to Argentina, which
 has had little impact in the campaign.
 Opposition's Problems
 The three opposition parties lack issues
 on which to attack the government, and
 they disagree among themselves. Basic
 differences over domestic policies between
 the Center and the Liberal parties on the
 one hand and the Conservatives on the
 other have prevented cooperation in the
 past and raise serious doubts about the
 ability of the nonsocialist parties to agree
 on a coalition even if they win a majority.
 Thorbjorn Falldin, leader of the large
 Center Party-the man likely to head any
 nonsocialist government-has tried to
 make opposition to the government's
 nuclear policy a unifying issue. When en-
 vironmentalists  opposed  further
 hydroelectric expansion in the mid-1960s,
 the Social Democratic government em-
 barked on a nuclear energy program that
 now has five plants on line and several
 more under construction.
 Initially both Gosta Bohman, leader of
 the Conservatives, and Per Ahlmark of
 the Liberals sidestepped Falldin's demand
 that the plants be closed and the plan
 abandoned. Recent press commentary,
 however, reflects considerable public con-
 cern over nuclear waste disposal and other
 safety aspects of the government's nuclear
 program. What appears to have been a
 nonstarter as an important issue could
 make the difference in a close race.
 Socialist Campaign
 While the nonsocialist parties seem un-
 certain  and  indecisive,  the Social
 Democratic campaign appears to be in
 high gear. A possible stumbling block for
 the party is the so-called Meidner Plan,
 which would give unions control of in-
 dustry in 20 to 25 years by forcing com-
 panies to make a certain percentage of
 their profits available to workers for the
 purchase of stock. Under the Meidner
 Plan, control of Swedish industry would
 pass to the unions within the next two or
 three decades.
 Thus far, the opposition has not
 aggressively attacked the Meidner Plan
 and  other  key  Social  Democratic
 proposals that would nationalize the con-
 struction industry and eliminate private
 ownership of land. The Conservatives
 may still do so, but the Liberals and the
 Centrists, who have supported govern-
 ment moves to give workers a voice in in-
 dustrial management, have indicated that
 they will not dig in their heels over.these
 proposals.
 The prospects for the Communists'
 continuing to play a supporting role to the
 Social Democrats are clouded by the deep
 ideological split in the party and its ad-
 vocacy of a revolutionary platform that
 has alienated many of its fringe sup-
 porters. Midyear polls showed the Com-
 munists with less than the four percent of
 the national tally necessary to win signifi-
 cant representation in parliament, but a
 poll in late August indicated that the par-
 ty might squeak by. The Communists are
 Thorbjorn Falldin
 almost certain, however, to win 12 percent
 in one northern district, a long-time
 stronghold, and such strength locally
 would give the party at least one seat in
 the new Riksdag even if it fails to get
 four percent nationally.
 Alternative Governments
 The latest polls show the Social
 Democrats and the Communists winning
 a combined 47 percent of the votes and
 the opposition parties 51 percent. The op-
 position parties had an identical edge just
 before the 1973 election, but lost by a
 fraction of a percentage point to the
 usually fast-finishing Social Democrats.
 If the opposition wins a majority and
 manages to put together a coalition, the
 basic differences among the parties
 probably would persist, resulting in an in-
 herently unstable government.  En-
 couraged by this prospect, the Social
 Democrats might decide to take the in-
 itiative and attempt to form a government
 that would include one or both of the cen-
 trist parties, or go it alone as a minority
 government.
 US relations with Sweden are not likely
 to change significantly if the opposition
 wins, although a nonsocialist government
 probably would take more pains to avoid
 unnecessary  frictions  with  the  US.

 Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore received some stiff
 jolts at the recent nonaligned conference in Colombo. They
 were unprepared for the vehemence of Vietnam's attacks on
 ASEAN or for the political militance that dominated the
 proceedings.
 q1
 ASEAN and Hanoi: Rethinking Relations
 Three of the five members of the
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations
 are reassessing relations with Vietnam
 following Hanoi's stinging attacks on the
 organization and its members at the re-
 cent conference of the nonaligned at
 Colombo.
 Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore
 are full-fledged members of the nonalign-
 ed movement. The other two members of
 ASEAN-the  Philippines  and
 Thailand-are not members of the non-
 aligned movement, but the Philippines
 attended the conference as a guest and
 wants to join.
 The Vietnamese view ASEAN as a
 potential rival and source of political and
 economic influence capable of thwarting
 their ambitions for a stronger position in
 Southeast Asia.
 In their postwar drive to improve
 relations in Southeast Asia, the Viet-
 namese have from time to time-usually
 in private conversations with individual
 ASEAN  members-soft-pedaled  their
 objections to the organization. In public,
 they still seem inclined to reiterate, and
 sometimes flaunt, their revolutionary
 credentials.
 As the Vietnamese seek a leadership
 role in the nonaligned movement, they are
 likely to continue attacking ASEAN.
 Suspicions Reawakened
 Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore
 were all dismayed by Vietnam's strong
 support of the Lao resolution that charged
 ASEAN with being a front for US im-
 perialism. For Indonesia and Singapore,
 Vietnam's behavior reawakened their
 suspicions about Hanoi's real intentions
 in the region, and it wiped out much of the
 good will generated by the visit of Viet-
 nam's Vice Foreign Minister Phan Hien
 to Southeast Asia in July. Both countries
 now believe Hien's conciliatory posture
 then was an effort to mask Hanoi's basic
 objective of subverting and dominating
 the area.
 For Malaysia, Hanoi's attack was an
 especially sharp slap. Malaysia had been
 working hard to encourage a more
 cooperative attitude on the part of
 ASEAN members toward Vietnam.
 Prime Minister Hussein is clearly
 irritated by Vietnam's attack
 Malaysia put its own resolution io avor
 of a zone of "peace, freedom, and
 neutrality" in Southeast Asia on the
 docket at Colombo. The concept has been
 a cornerstone of Malaysian foreign policy
 for several years. Other ASEAN
 governments are skeptical about the idea,
 but have generally gone along with
 Malaysia's insistence that it be formally
 incorporated into the ASEAN regional
 view. I n February, at the first meeting of
 the ASEAN heads of state, the concept
 was adopted by all five members and
 made a central part of the conference's
 final communique.
 Malaysia went to the nonaligned con-
 ference convinced that its resolution
 would be adopted and was not prepared
 for the attack from Laos. Vietnam

 provided strong support for the Lao
 resolution, and most ASEAN observers
 believe Laos was acting as the front man
 for what essentially was a Vietnamese
 position. The Malaysian proposal never
 came to a vote.
 The Colombo performance could well
 undercut Vietnamese objectives in
 Southeast Asia. Most ASEAN states
 believe Vietnam needs them more than
 they need Vietnam. With Hanoi revealing
 its "true colors"-the words of Lee Kuan
 Yew of Singapore-the ASEAN states
 will be less enthusiastic about providing
 Vietnam with economic assistance.
 Singapore reportedly plans to turn a
 cold shoulder, and Malaysia, whose
 economic help to Vietnam is minimal,
 also intends to review its position. In-
 donesia almost certainly will reconsider
 its future aid program to Vietnam. Even
 token economic aid from its noncom-
 munist neighbors is important to Viet-
 nam.
 Disillusionment at Colombo
 Regional considerations aside, the Lao
 resolution, together with the general dis-
 array of the Colombo conference, has left
 Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia
 seriously questioning their future role in
 the nonaligned movement. The three
 generally do not share many of the values
 of the newer, more militant members of
 the movement and see no need to posture
 about anti-imperialism or subscribe to the
 anti-US diatribes of the more recently
 decolonized states.
 The three countries were disappointed
 that the more serious economic questions
 facing the nonaligned were given short
 shrift and that the conferees produced few
 meaningful guidelines to deal with sub-
 stantive problems.
 The Philippines, watching from the
 sidelines, has so far been less critical of
 the conference than its ASEAN
 colleagues. President Marcos is anxious
 to become a full member of the nonalign-
 ed movement by the next summit in
 Havana in 1979. As the only Southeast
 Asian country still allowing a large US
 military presence and as a member of
 25X1
 SEATO, Manila has yet to establish its
 third-world credentials to the satisfaction
 of the ruling councils of the nonaligned.
 Marcos thinks he cannot afford at this
 point to be as critical of the conference's
 results or of Vietnam's performance as his
 three colleagues have been.
 Despite their reservations, none of the
 three is likely to pull out of the nonaligned
 movement or even sharply criticize the
 conference in public, but they may try to
 disassociate themselves from the more
 militant nonaligned positions.
 Over the longer term, the three will re-
 main interested in better bilateral
 relations with Vietnam, provided Hanoi
 restrains its support for neighboring in-
 surgencies and tones down its an-
 ti-ASEAN rhetoric.
 For now, however, these countries are
 unlikely to take significant initiatives
 toward Vietnam. They are more likely to
 exert greater efforts to strengthen
 ASEAN and to try to make it a more
 effective competitor to Vietnam.
 More than half of the labor force in Saudi Arabia is now
 foreign, and the proportion of foreigners continues to rise.
 Many Saudis wonder whether the implicit threat to their
 traditional values is too high a price to pay for rapid economic
 development.
 Saudi Arabia: Influx of Foreign Workers
 Saudi Arabia's commitment to its am-
 bitious five-year development plan has
 generated tremendous demands for skill-
 ed and semi-skilled labor that cannot be
 met domestically. The need to import
 workers is beginning to cause serious
 labor and social problems.
 North Yemen has been the customary
 source of unskilled labor in Saudi Arabia;
 in the past year or so, Yemeni workers
 have been joined by large numbers of In-
 dians, Pakistanis, South Koreans, and
 Filipinos. There is also a large West Euro-
 pean and US presence in the kingdom.
 About half the Saudi labor force is now
 foreign; if the trend continues, we es-
 timate that by 1980 two thirds will be
 foreign.
 Many Saudis fear the influx of so many
 foreign workers will undermine the unique
 Saudi lifestyle and values and wonder if
 this is not too high a price to pay for rapid
 economic development.
 An estimated 500,000 North Yemeni
 laborers-who need only an identity card
 to enter Saudi Arabia-are scattered
 throughout the kingdom. Most are
 manual workers in the construction in-
 dustry. According to one estimate, there
 are more Yemenis in Jidda than in any
 city in North Yemen.
 These workers send home about $25
 million a month, an important contribu-
 tion to North Yemen's economy. The
 Saudis have long viewed Yemeni residents
 with a mixture of indifference and con-
 tempt.
 In the past year, the North Yemeni
 predominance in the labor force has been
 diluted by the growing presence of Asian
 workers, most of whom come from the

 subcontinent. The Saudis are concerned
 because the productivity of the Indians
 and Pakistanis is low, while inflation
 keeps boosting their salaries and
 maintenance costs. Some of these workers
 have proved to be demanding employees,
 in contrast to the docile laborers to which
 their Saudi employers have been ac-
 customed. Another concern of the Saudis
 is their suspicion that workers from the
 subcontinent will not go home when their
 work is done.
 The Saudis have ambivalent feelings
 about the 10,000 to 12,000 South Koreans
 in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province. The
 Koreans, who are engaged primarily in
 construction work, are respected for their
 hard work,  productivity, and
 craftsmanship but are eyed by the Saudis
 with a good deal of suspicion and even
 some fear for their discipline and quasi-
 military appearance and manners.
 Saudi apprehensions have been fed by
 the Koreans' tendency to dress alike in
 uniforms and to go about publicly in
 groups of 10 or 20; some Saudis even see
 the Koreans as a potentialsecurity threat.
 The government's reaction has been
 sharply to curtail entrance visas to other
 Koreans.
 There are small, but growing, con-
 tingents of workers from other Asian
 countries. About 200 Thai have arrived
 and have shown themselves to be
 hard-working and unobtrusive. Filipinos
 make up a small-about 200 at
 present-but growing segment of the
 foreign work force. About 5,000 In-
 donesians are expected, but few are in the
 country now.
 Problems
 The country's economic boom has
 driven up wages and prices precipitously;
 both are estimated to be increasing at 40
 percent a year. Since 1973, the shortage of
 labor and the extensive construction pro-
 jects have boosted daily wages for an un-
 skilled Yemeni construction worker from
 $3 to $25. Wages for domestic help have
 doubled.
 Foreign workers employed on govern-
 ment construction projects in recent
 weeks have engaged in several major
 strikes-virtually unheard of in Saudi
 Arabia. A work stoppage by Pakistani
 laborers in late August was put down by
 police and army units. Early this month,
 400 skilled Turkish workers struck a
 military construction project in Taif. The
 government, which refused to entertain
 the workers' demands for higher pay and
 better working conditions, ordered their
 deportation when they refused to return to
 the job. Strikes are illegal in Saudi
 Arabia, although grievance procedures do
 exist.
 Yemenis-unlike other foreign
 workers-are not bound by the Saudi
 regulations that limit the shifting of spon-
 sored expatriate workers from one
 employer to another. Yemenis can enter
 the kingdom without sponsorship and
 without visas. This situation, coupled with
 the fact that few workers of any nationali-
 ty obey the law requiring them to have a
 binding work contract, has caused virtual
 chaos in the labor market as workers feel
 free to quit their jobs at will.
 Some  Yemenis have switched
 employers four or five times in as many
 months.
 An apparent increase in crime has been
 an unwelcome spin-off from the presence
 of foreign workers. Traditionally, crime
 has been rare in Saudi Arabia because of
 harsh penalties.
 We have reports that crimes committed
 by foreigners-usually against other
 foreigners, including Americans-are in-
 creasing. The oil consortium, Aramco,
 has started a safety program warning its
 employees of possible dangers in their
 neighborhoods.
 The Saudis long have been sensitive to
 the possible security threat posed by
 foreign workers to the oil fields. Since
 1967, Aramco has been forbidden to use
 Syrian, Iraqi, Palestinian, or Yemeni
 laborers at Ras Tanura or sensitive oil
 sites in the Eastern Province. No such
 security concern has yet been expressed
 about American or European workers.
 The Westerners, however, present a
 different problem. They must be offered
 high  salaries  and housing and
 maintenance benefits to entice them to
 work in the kingdom. Young, Western-
 trained Saudis who are now returning
 home and going into the government are
 discovering that these Westerners-most
 of whom seem no better qualified than
 they-are being paid far more for doing
 the same work.
 Compounding the problem is the fact
 that many uneducated Saudis working in
 the private sector are accumulating
 wealth and influence at a rate unat-
 tainable by a government employee. The
 Saudi government, concerned about slow-
 ing inflation, is reluctant to raise govern-
 ment salaries.
 A result of these pressures has been that
 increasing numbers of the most capable
 young Saudi officials are abandoning
 government service for the private sector.
 Outlook
 Saudi Arabia's plans for domestic
 development will require a continuing in-
 flux of foreign workers-an estimated
 500,000 more by 1980. The associated
 problems will continue-inflation, crime,
 possible security threats-and, perhaps
 more long-lasting and difficult to control,
 the cultural challenge to the values and
 traditions of Saudi society. Saudi concern
 about crime and security threats has
 focused mainly on Asians, but not sur-
 prisingly the American and European
 residents are. seen as presenting the
 critical challenge to Saudi culture.
 The Saudis face some tough decisions
 about their plans for development and the
 related issue of foreign labor. They could
 choose to ignore the problem and hope its
 effects do not become too disruptive, or
 they could change the mix of the foreign
 work  force-perhaps  substituting
 Americans or Europeans for Asians.
 Such a shift would cost the Saudis more
 in wages immediately and more in
 cultural impact in the long term. The
 Saudis have been pleased with the quality
 of American work.
 Finally, they could curtail their
 development plans and reduce foreign
 labor. This, of course, would have far-
 reaching political, economic, and social
 implications for the kingdom. F_
