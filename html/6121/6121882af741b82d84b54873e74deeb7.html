 The Israeli government leaders are closely monitoring the situation in southern
 Lebanon, but they have so far refrained from any comment that would inflame the
 situation.  Israeli press articles suggest that the leadership is unsure of the
 implications for Israel of recent developments in Lebanon, and has not decided
 what, if any, action to take.
 The Israelis undoubtedly fear that the spread of the mutiny to areas so close to
 their border may draw additional Palestinian forces into the area. Previously, Israeli
 leaders have indicated that they would consider the presence of major non-Lebanese
 forces in southern Lebanon a direct threat to Israel's security.
 March 11, 1976
 According to unconfirmed
 press reports, Mamari's forces also attacked a Lebanese air base.
 The rebels' successes have sparked concern among Lebanese Christians that
 Khatib and his sympathizers intend to form a renegade Muslim force encircling the
 core Christian area of the country.

 Prime Minister Karami tried yesterday to gloss over the deepening controversy
 between Christian and Muslim leaders over how to handle the mutineers. He
 admitted, however, that the problem had forced a temporary interruption in
 negotiations to form a new cabinet. Leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt-an outspoken
 supporter of the Muslim rebels-apparently has so alienated Christian leaders on the
 mutiny issue that they have refused to participate in further political talks until the
 problem is solved. Jumblatt reportedly has also rejected an alleged Syrian plan
 simply to announce a new cabinet without further talks with quarreling Muslim and
 Christian politicians.
 Despite Jumblatt's obstinacy, Syrian negotiators apparently still favor the
 creation of a new cabinet as quickly as possible, and may use the growin security
 problems as additional leverage against Christian and Muslim leaders.

 Peking's most authoritative statement to date on the campaign to criticize Teng
 Hsiao-ping, while linking Mao Tse-tung directly to this effort, also reflects some
 differences within the party over how far to pursue the current campaign.
 A People's Daily.editorial of March 10 quotes Mao'on the need to "narrow the
 target" of the attack, implying that Teng alone should be criticized, but, at the same
 time, leaves the door open to criticism of other officials who are associated with
 Teng and who, like him, were returned to public office after being ousted a decade
 ago. While the editorial stops short of calling for Teng to be overthrown, stating only
 that he should be criticized, Teng is separated from other officials who, the editorial
 notes, should be "helped" to correct their past mistakes.
 The party's left wing will undoubtedly use one of the passages in the editorial
 that is linked directly to Mao to broaden the attack on Teng to include many of the
 rehabilitees who once again hold important party, military, and government
 positions. The editorial nevertheless calls for people to remain "coolheaded" and
 strictly prohibits the kind of disruptive political activity that characterized the
 Cultural Revolution.
 These prohibitions, which are at the operative heart of the editorial, strongly
 suggest that more moderate leaning members of the leadership still retain a major
 voice in defining the scope of the campaign. These leaders almost certainly prefer at
 the least to limit the attacks to Teng himself and to keep the campaign from gaining
 enough momentum to encompass large numbers of rehabilitated officials and to
 undercut major domestic and foreign policies.
 The  restrictions may be particularly important in view of the greater
 identification in the editorial of Mao with the leftist cause in general and with the
 attacks on Teng in particular. The editorial introduces two new "quotations" from
 the Chairman which tie him closer to the campaign; in the past he had been
 identified unequivocally only with the leftist effort to preserve Cultural Revolution
 reforms in the educational field and with a more general injunction to persevere in
 "class struggle." But even this new invocation of the Chairman's authority is
 somewhat ambiguous.
 The editorial states the campaign is being conducted under the direction of the
 "central committee headed" by Mao-a power sharing formulation that was
 conspicuously absent throughout the Cultural Revolution. It was only reintroduced
 after the Lin Piao incident, when the central authorities were unsure of army loyalty
 and Mao was somewhat tarnished by his previous relationship with the disgraced
 defense minister.

 The central authorities also seem to be making other efforts to define the scope
 of the campaign. In a briefing for foreign diplomats in Peking on March 6, a
 university official stated that Teng is the only target of the current attack and
 implied that he could remain in power if he agreed to admit his mistakes. He added,
 however, that Teng had not yet done so.
 The official refused to be drawn out specifically on what Teng's ultimate fate
 would be or on his current status, but the general low-key tenor of his comments
 suggests that Peking is making a concerted effort to play down the campaign for
 foreign audiences-and that important elements in the leadership are concerned
 about the possible impact that indications of political instability may have abroad.
 This briefing is unprecedented, and represents a major departure from practice
 during the Cultural Revolution when far fewer diplomats were in Peking-and during
 the anti-Confucius campaign of 1974.
 In general, the tenor of the briefing accords with the comments of a senior
 communist official in Hong Kong who gave a relaxed explanation of the campaign to
 an American diplomat and suggested that more moderate leaders in Peking, who are
 opposed to the current situation, will eventually be heard from. An indication of
 what this official had in mind may be contained in recent reports that wall posters
 appeared in Canton attacking Chiang Ching, Mao's leftist wife.
 In the meantime, the party's left wing continues its active pursuit of Teng. The
 Ministry of Culture, which is closely associated with leftist political leaders, has
 withdrawn from circulation all films in which Teng appears. Posters have been cited
 in Shanghai and in Kwangtung Province calling for Teng's ouster. I
 posters attacking rehabilitated provincial officials
 have begun to appear in several scattered locations. Moreover, some reports of the
 attacks on Teng in scattered areas carry the implication that the late Chou En-lai is
 also to blame for his role in returning Teng to power. If this line is pursued, there is
 likely to be a strong anti-leftist backlash from Chou's many former supporters and
 adherents.
 Equally important, there are signs that civilian leftists are courting the military
 as allies in the current campaign. The military was conspicuously absent during the
 campaign's initial stages but some units are now beginning to participate in the
 criticism of Teng. In what seems to be a direct appeal to China's powerful regional
 military commanders in the provinces, wall posters reportedly have accused Teng of
 seeking to undercut their authority by concentrating military power in Peking and
 more particularly in his own hands. The posters also charge Teng with opposing a
 system of rapid promotions in the armed forces.

 SAUDI ARABIA - SOUTH YEMEN
 Saudi Arabia and South Yemen announced in a joint statement yesterday their
 intention to normalize relations, capping a reconciliation process initiated by Cairo
 in 1974. The Saudis and the radical National Front regime in Aden have been at
 loggerheads since South Yemen became independent in 1967.
 The communique declared  that the two countries would refrain from
 interfering in each other's internal affairs while cooperating in cultural and economic
 affairs. It also expressed both countries' opposition to "foreign interference" in the
 Arabian Peninsula. The reference to "foreign interference" is broad enough to
 encompass both the Saudi objection to the Soviet presence in South Yemen and
 Aden's opposition to Iran's military role in Oman.

 The late King Faysal's  overnment refused to have anything- to do with the

 general Abd-al-Fattah Ismail have been involved in a power struggle. The Saudis are
 betting that Ali, with whom they have negotiated the accommodation, can
 overcome Ismail and be brought into Riyadh's camp.
 Our initial assessment is that prospects for remaking South Yemen into a
 moderate state are not very promising. The party leadership role of Ismail-a
 hard-line Marxist and key backer of the Dhofar rebellion-has enabled him to place
 his supporters throughout the party, government, and military apparatus. South
 Yemen's willingness to negotiate the deal with the Saudis probably was dictated
 more by economic necessity than an interest in modifying its present political

 USSR -WESTERN SAHARA
 March 11, 1976
 Soviet efforts to straddle the Western Sahara issue are irritating Algiers but
 pleasing Rabat.
 The USSR has handled the proclamation of the "Saharan Democratic Arab
 Republic" by the Algerian-backed Polisario guerrillas with caution. The Soviets have
 taken public note of the declaration and reported that Algeria considers the entity a
 "national  liberation  movement," but their press coverage has also reported
 Moroccan opposition to the move.
 Soviet op osition to a war over Western Sahara appears to be registering on
 Algiers.
 Perhaps to show its pique, Algiers summoned its ambassador to the USSR
 home before the Soviet party congress last month. Later, the Algerian delegate to
 the congress made a quick trip home to consult with Boumediene before talking
 with Soviet leaders.
 Soviet overtures have apparently convinced Morocco that the Kremlin is not
 adopting, a blatantly pro-Algerian stand. Moroccan Prime Minister Osman has told
 US officials that he was pleased by his discussions with Premier Kosygin last month
 in Moscow. Kosygin evidently told Osman that Boumediene had placed himself on a
 limb and that a way should be found to get the Algerian President off it without
 embarrassment.
 Early this week, Rabat demonstrated its satisfaction with the Soviet show of
 evenhandedness by resuming relations with East Germany. The East Germans
 pledged that they would not interfere in Rabat's "internal affairs"-implying they
 would not extend diplomatic recognition to the new Polisario "republic." Morocco
 had broken ties with East Berlin last November as a signal to Moscow that Rabat was
 disturbed over Soviet meddling in the Western Sahara question.
 Despite its show of evenhandedness, Moscow's instinctive sympathies lie with
 the "progressive" regime in Algeria over the US-supported monarchy in Morocco.
 Soviet use of Algerian airfields during the Angola conflict and the USSR's desire to
 curry favor with a regime that has standing in nonaligned circles and at least a part
 of the Arab world also play a part.

 The Soviets, however, do not want to push strategically located Morocco
 further into the arms of the US. They also value their commercial dealings with
 Rabat and want access to Moroccan phosphates, which may prove increasingly
 important to Soviet agriculture.
 In view of these conflicting interests, the Kremlin would probably like to
 continue to avoid having to choose sides in the conflict. Moscow's bias toward
 Algiers may nevertheless propel the USSR toward stronger support of the Algerian
 position, particularly, if-against Soviet desires-the Sahara situation deteriorates into
 a large-scale conflict.
 Moscow has announced that two naval ships are taking part in an official
 friendship visit to Port Louis, Mauritius for the island's independence day tomorrow.
 Rear Admiral Yasakov, the officer in tactical command of the Soviet Indian
 Ocean naval squadron, will be in Port Louis until March 17 aboard a Krivak-class
 destroyer. An Alligator-class tank landing ship is also taking part in the port visit. A
 supporting Soviet naval oiler is in the Mauritius area but is not expected to
 participate in the visit.
 Although Soviet naval units have made many calls at Port Louis in the past, this
 is the first by a Soviet naval combatant since last August. The visit emphasizes
 Moscow's continued interest in pursuing closer ties with Mauritius. Soviet naval
 auxiliaries called there as recently as last month when a space support ship made a
 one-day stop.

 PORTUGAL
 The campaign for legislative elections in Portugal is swinging into full gear with
 election day less than two months away.
 Fourteen parties have entered slates, but the bulk of the vote will be divided
 among only four-the Socialists, the centrist Popular Democrats, the conservative
 Social Democratic Center, and the Communists. Eight of the competing parties are
 minor groups to the left of the Communists.
 The shift to the right since last November is expected to narrow the gap
 between the Socialists and the Popular Democrats-who received 38 percent and 26
 percent respectively in last year's vote-and to bring the Social Democratic Center
 into contention for a leading role in a post-election government.
 To kick off their campaign, the Socialists have arranged a star-studded
 gathering of West European socialist leaders in the northern Portuguese city of Porto
 this weekend. Participants will include Brandt from West Germany, Mitterrand from
 France, Kreisky from Austria, Palme from Sweden, and party leaders from the
 Netherlands, Norway, Italy, and Spain. The session is intended to give the Socialists
 a boost in the heavily Popular Democratic north. Popular Democratic leader Sa
 Carneiro has already labeled the meeting as foreign interference in Portuguese
 politics and has scheduled a rally in Porto on Saturday in an effort to draw attention
 away from the Socialists.
 The Socialists have also come out a step ahead of the Popular Democrats in the
 number of nationally recognized figures heading their list of candidates and are
 benefiting from better media exposure. The Socialists profess to be hopeful of
 gaining enough votes to control the new national assembly and claim that they will
 "govern alone or not at all."
 The Popular Democrats are concentrating on widening their margin of victory
 in the densely populated north by courting Angolan returnees and conservative
 farmers. They are also counting on the vote of Portuguese workers living abroad and
 have challenged the Socialists, Communists, and far left in the constituent assembly
 in an effort to ease restrictions on voting by emigrant workers.
 The Popular Democrats, however, are caught between the Socialists and the
 Social Democratic Center. The party's tactical shifts to the left or right in the past
 have left it without a firm ideological base. In recent months, the party has moved
 away from the Socialists and adopted views closer to those of the center-right Social
 Democratic Center. The latter, however, is stressing its role as an opposition and is
 lumping the Popular Democrats with the left, tarring them with participation in past
 ineffective governments.

 The  Communists appear to  be  steadily  losing ground and are
 trying-unsuccessfully so far-to promote an alliance with the Socialists to preserve a
 role in Portuguese politics. The Communists are already preparing their supporters
 for a bad showing, and one party leader has already said that the Communists will
 not recognize the results of the election because his party will not be allowed to
 ca
 mpaign  in "reactionary "  areas,  such as the north or the Azores.

 Nine Spanish  military officers were sentenced yesterday to periods of
 imprisonment ranging from two to eight years for belonging to the secret officers'
 society called the Military Democratic Union and for attempting to foment military
 rebellion. The verdict must still be approved by the commander of the Madrid
 Military Region.
 Two of the nine qualify for immediate release under the terms of the royal
 pardon issued last November; the other seven must serve their sentences and suffer
 automatic dismissal from the service if the verdicts are approved.
 The sentences seem to indicate that hardliners in the military hierarchy won
 the upper hand over more moderate generals who favored leniency. The relatively
 harsh treatment of the nine officers could upset many younger officers who, like the
 rest of Spanish society, are becoming more politically aware and who already resent
 the ultra conservative bias of many officers in the upper echelons. The military
 authorities have apparently decided that they would rather risk this resentment than
 ease disciplinary control over junior officers.
 In the northwestern coal mining region of Asturias, heavily armed security
 forces yesterday successfully prevented a mass rally by miners to protest the killing
 of four demonstrators in the Basque country last week. Paramilitary civil guards set
 up road blocks around the town of Oviedo to prevent miners from gathering there
 and dispersed a crowd of about 2,000. At least four leaders of the clandestine
 workers  commissions wer  taken  into custody early yesterday morning.

 SINGAPORE
 The UK will permit the Singapore armed forces to use British military training
 facilities in Brunei. The Singapore air force will begin survival training in late March
 or early April. The UK has tentatively agreed to begin training Singapore instructors
 at the jungle warfare school in June or July.
 The development of Singapore's military establishment has been seriously
 hampered by a lack of areas suitable for jungle and conventional training. To
 overcome this obstacle, Singapore has sought the assistance of its neighbors and
 commonwealth allies. Only Thailand, Taiwan, and the oil-rich protectorate of
 Brunei, however, have responded favorably to requests for ground force training.
 Singapore's antiaircraft artillery units have trained in Brunei for the past two years,
 and Singapore hopes that a similar agreement can be negotiated to permit its
 infantry battalions to conduct unit jungle training there.
 The UK had been hesitant to approve Singapore's requests for training because
 of its plans to leave Brunei in 1978. Although British responsibility for the defense
 of Brunei is currently embodied in a mutual agreement, London is under fire from
 Malaysia and other Third World countries for hanging on to this "colonial vestige."
 The limited training and Malaysia's failure to react adversely to past use of Brunei
 '
 s request.
 probably induced the British to accede to Singapore

 YUGOSLAVIA
 March 11, 1976
 President Tito officially began his Latin American tour yesterday, following a
 flight the day before from Yugoslavia to Bermuda.
 Throughout the trip, Tito will probably preach the principles of nonalignment
 to his hosts and urge a more active role in the movement by Latin American
 governments. Belgrade hopes that the trip will strengthen ties between Yugoslavia
 and Latin America.
 While in Mexico from March  10 to 14, Tito will sign agreements for
 scientific-technical exchanges, trade, and tourism. Tito subsequently will go to
 Panama for a four-day state visit. He may feel obligated to support publicly
 Panamanian sovereignty over the Canal Zone. Yugoslavia is aware, however, of
 Washington's sensitivity over the negotiations. In Caracas, the Yugoslav leader is
 expected to push nonalignment and may also emphasize Yugoslavia's view that
 OPEC members like Venezuela have an obligation to help improve economic
 conditions in the less developed countries.
 Originally, Tito was also to have visited Cuba, but arrangements were canceled
 i
 n favor of meetings from March 6 to 8 with Prime Minister Castro in Yugoslavia.
