	    	-  II				    	malization  of  diplomatic  relations  in  1972,  the  trade
	     	,				    	volume  has  expanded  and  economic  ties  have  bee::
						   	promoted in m~ny spheres,  including Japan's offer of
	     	j				    	Ioans,  the establishment  of  joint  venture  companies

						    	ment plans. Japanese exports of industrial plants on a

							  	This coope,rative relationship now faces a serious
			'				    	trial  due  to  the  fauii~e  of  China's  economic  policy.
			'				    	China  tried  to  modernize  itself  too  quickly  by  im-

			  	power and Party Chairman Hua  Guofeng is believed
			  	to be resigning. Related problems are not likely to be
			  	settled just domestically.  Many Japanese companies
			  	tiave  made  preparations  to  promote  joint  pro}ects,
			  	and  contract cancellations  will  cause  them  to  suffer
			  	heavy losses.																						_
			     	~  In  the  spring  of  1979,  the  Chinese  authorities												     	_
			  	became aware of their economic policy failv.re,  froze
			  	several   	contracts   	including   	the   	$2,300-million
			  	Baoshan project,  and  began  reviewrng  the  situation.
			  	What took place during that time?
	 	,			w    	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
			  	has  reportedly  asked  Chinese  ~fficials  to  respect												    	_
			  	international  commercial  customs,  pointing out  that
	  	_			failure   	to   	compensate   	for   	losses   	resulting ~ from
			  	contract   	cancellations   	would   	force   	the   	Japanese
			  	government to pay export insurance. If such were the
			  	case,   	the  Japanese  government   	would  not  apply												    	-
	  	-			export insurance on future exports to China.
			   	=    	In   	announcing   	its   	plans   	to   	suspend   	certain
	  	-			operations,  the  Chinese  government  expressed  the												   	~
			  	hope  that  "talks  would  be  held  to  sQttle  pending												    	_
			  	problems."  It  is  our  hope  that  China  will  abide  by
			  	international customs and take appropriate measures
			  	to avoid obstru~:ting future Sino-Japanese relations.													  	_
				 	In  this  con;lection,  we  believe  that  the  Japanese												     	~
			  	business  firms  concerned  should  have  acted  more
			  	prudently. Amid the "China fever"  which emerged in
			  	Japan   	immediately   	after   	the   	normalization   	of
			  	diplomatic   	relations,   	some   	Japanese   	companies
			  	n~shed  headlong  into  this  huge  new  market  of  one
			  	b~llion people.						  	.
	  	-		     	China is a developing nation based on agriculture.
			  	After the purge of the "Gang of Four," China stepped
			  	up efforts to raise its living standards and modernize												    	-

				   	GOVERNMENT  INVESTMENT,  LOAN  PROGRAM  CRITICIZED
				   	Tokyo  EKONOMISUTO  in  Japanese  Vol  58  No  l~J~,   	28  Oct  80  p  3
				    	[Article:    	"Wastage  in  Second  Budget"]
				    	[TextJ    	Since  financial  rebuilding  is  an  urgent  task,   	an  active  debate  is  going  on
			~		    	over  the  budget  and  taxes.    	However,   	the  fiscal  treasury  investment  and  loan  program,
			;		    	knoti~n  as   	the  second  budget,   	is  almost  being  ovPr~looked.    	It  seems  as  if  everyone  has
				   	fallen  for  the  Ministry  of  Finance's  diversionary  tactics.    	The  money  for  the  national
			i		    	budget  is  tax  money  collected  under   	the  law  and  disbursed  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance
			'		    	after  the  budget  is  passed  by  the  Diet.    	The  fiscal  treasury  investment  and  loan
			~		    	program  is  known  as   	the  second  budget  but  the  Ministry  of  Finance  acts  as  if  it  views
			~		    	the  program  lightly  as  something  completely  different  from  the  budget  since  it  is
				   	only  used  to  make  loans   	to  special  government  corporations  using  money  from  the
			I		    	voluntary  Pos t  Office  savings  program.    	The  average  citizen  and  even  members  of  the
			'		    	Diet  have  been  taken  in  by  this  explanation  but  examination  of  the  facts  shows   	that
				    	this  is  a  kind  of  sophistry  based  on  old-fashioned  tax  ar~d  financial  theory.    	Using
	    	~I		    	such  sophistry,   	the  Ministry  of  Finance  enshrouds  the  investment  and  loan  program
			~		    	in  a  veil  of  mystery,   	thereby  covering  up  tremendous  waste  and  giving  bureaucrats
			~		    	unlimited  discretion.
			~		    	In  reality,   	at  present  the  budget  and  the  investment  and  loan  program  are  inseparably
				   	linked.    	Naturally,   	the  investment  and  loan  program  is  used  to  cover  up  shortages  in
			,		    	resources  for  General  Accounts  and  used  as  a  supplement  for  administrative  and
				   	quasi-administrative  expenses,  which  should  come  from  General  Accounts,   	by  means  of
				   	loans  and  investments  to  the  special  corporations.    	The  loan  and  investment  program
				   	is  hecoming  more  and  more  like  a  part  of  General  Accounts.    	In.  addition  to  this,
				    	the  Trust  Fund  Bureau  is  underwriting  national  bonds  to  aid  General  Accounts  in  the
				   	amount  of  2.6   	trillion  yen  for  1979   	(actual  amount)   	and  3.2   	trillion  yen  in  1980
				    	(estimate).    	The  Trust  Fund  Burea~t  is  also  making  large  loans  to  General  Accounts
				   	and  Special  Accounts.    	It:  is  makin~  loans  to  the  regional  self-governing  bodies  and
				   	underwriting  large  amounts  or  regional  bonds  in  connection  with  holding  of  tax  rate
				   	increases  for   	local  allocation  taxes.    	In  addition  to  this  huge  supplement  to  General
				   	Accounts  from  the  investment  and  loan  program,   	there  i~  an  increase  every  year  in  aid
				    	to  the  investment  and  loan  program  from  General  Accounts.    	When  special  cor~orations
				   	borrow  from  t:~e  program  money  is  disbursed  �rom  General  Accounts  to  the  investment
	   	-		     	and  loan  program  in   	the  form  of  interest  supplements,   	advances,   	subsidies,   	investments,
	    	-		     	etc.,   	under  such  pretexts  as  the  necessity  to  lighten  tl~e  interest  burden.    	In  1980,
				    	these  expenditures  amounted  to  1.3  trillion  yen.    	Because  of  this   	complicated  relation-
	    	-		     	ship,   	the  division  of  responsibiliry  between  the  two  areas  has  become  muddled.

				A  report  on  the  investment  and  loan  program  has  been  submitted  to  the  Diet  since  197?

				Z~~   	expenditures  included  in  the  1.3  trillion  yen  transferred  to  this  program  from
				General  Accounts  are  hidden  in  the  "autonomous   	funds,   	etc.    	column  under  a"referettce"
				heading  for  each  special  corporation  in  the  investment  and',loan  program  report.
				Subsidies  and  interest  supplements  cannot  be  found  anywhere  but  in  the  income  section
	  	~	    	of   	the  individual  profit  and  loss  statements  of  each  special  corporation.    	And   	the
				financial  statements  of   	the  special  corporations  cannot  be  seen  by  anyone  but  a
				handful  of  officials  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance.    	In  addition,   	the  handling  of   	13  to
			 	14  trillion  yen  in  short  term  loans  to  tize  special  corporations  is  shrouded  in  mystery.
			 	The  amount  of  money  remaining  unused  in  the  investment  and  loan  program  for  1979  was
			 	over  3.67  trillion  yen   	("unused  portion",  over  720  tril~   	~n  yen;   	"amount  carried
			 	forward",   	over  2.94  trillion  yen)   	or  about  18  percent  of  the  total.    	This   	trend  is			  	~
			 	a  continuing  one.    	The  figure   	for  1977  was  over  3.18  trillion  yen  and  that  for  1978
			 	more  than  4.78  trillion  yen.    	the  Ministry  of  Finance  defends   	this  by  say~.ng  that  the
			 	amount  carried  forward  is  due   	to  project  planning  delays  and  accounting  operations,
			 	related  especially   	to  local  self-doverning  bodies.    	However,   	this  explanation  is  not		    	=
			 	convincing.    	Briefly  put,   	the  loan  program  has  been  put  together  sloppily  and  has
			 	resulted  in  this  t~ernendous  amount  ef  waste.											    	?
			 	Ri  ht  now  large  industries  and  private  financial  institutions  have  plenty  of  funds			 	I
			    	g																						     	'
			 	and  the  neces.sityfor  these kinds  of  loans_for  governmentpolicy measures   	has  disappeared.		  	~
			 	When  the  government  is  in  financial  trouble,  why  is  it  necessary  to  make  such  a  large
			 	volume  of  low  interest  loans?    	Radical  excision  of  waste  from  the  fiscal   	treasury
			 	investment  and  loan  programs,   	reorganization  and  consolidation  of   	the  special  cor-
			 	porations,   	and  movement  in  a  more  urgent  direction  are  necessary  prerequisites   	for
			  	financial  rebuilding.

			     	United  States  was  surrounded  by  corporate  representatives  in  the  field  after  he

				corporate  concerns  have  not  had  such  a  strong  interest  in  the  achievements  made
				in  the  field  of  leading  basic  biology.
				'~Tn  the  1990's,   	a  considerable  part  of  various  reactions  in  the  chemical  industry
				may  be  replaced  with  biological  reactions...."   	(Liu  Yangyou   	[0491  3152  0671],
		     	Head,   	Dept.   	of  Research  Control,   	Sumitomo  Chemical  Industries).    	As  speculated
				above,  many  of  the  conventional  chemi.cal  reactions  requiring  high  temperatures
				and  high  pressure  will  possibly  be  replaced  by  energy-saving  biochemical  reac-
				tions.
				Aside  from  the  chemical  industry,  which  may  be  called  the  trunk  industry,   	the
				establishment  of  biotechnology  is  indispensable  for  the  develo~ment  of  inedicine
				and  agricultural  chemicals  as  well  as   	for  the  use  of  biomass,  which  is  in  the
				limeligh t  as  a  new  energy  source.    	In  addition,   	the  realization  of  crops  that  do
				not  require  fertilizer,  of  cold-resistant  varieties,   	of  multiple  crops,  etc.,  a			     	_
				new  technology   	to  convert  waste  wood   	to  feed  and  food,  and  the  continuous  produc-
				tion  of   	food  supplies  using  tanks  are  some  of  the  projects   	to  be  considered.    	In
				these  fields  of  many  new  industries,   	it  is  said  that  differences  in  the  ability
			 	to  do  research  in  basic  biology  will   	control  the  livelihood  of  enterprises  from
				now  on.
			 	For  these  reasons,   	the  Ministry  of  In ternational  Trade  and  Industry  chose  bio-
			 	technology  as  a  strategic  technology   	to  support  future  Japanese  industry  and
			 	made  it  a  big  part  of  a  large  10-ye~r  project  for  the  Next  Generation  Basic
	  	_	     	Industrial  Technology  R&D  System,  which  starts  in  1981.    	In  a  similar  measure,
			 	industrial  circles  inaugurated  a"biotechnology  symposium'   	(Eiji  Suzuki,  presi-
			 	dent  of  Mitsubishi  Chemical  Ind.,  Ltd.,  is  chairman)   	of  five  firms  consisting  of
			 	Mitsubishi  Chemical  Ind.  Ltd.,   	Sumitomo  Chemical  Co.  Ltd.,  Asahi  Chemi.cal  Ind.   	Co.
			 	Ltd.,  Kyowa  Hakko  Kogyo  Co.   	Ltd.,   	and  Mitsui  Toatsu  Chemicals,   	Inc.
			 	Furthermore,  one  step  ahead  of  such  an  official  movement,   	corporate  pharma-
			 	ceutical,   	food  supply,   	and  fermentation  concerns  as  well  as  various  chemical
			 	concerns  have  independently  begun  studies  in  biotechnology  in  earnest,  with
			 	emphasis  on  genetic  engineering.    	Nearly  ZO   	firms  are  thought   	to  have  already
			 	begun  full-scale  research  in  genetic  engineering  alone,   	and  the  number  of  firms
			 	engaged  in  all  areas  of  biotechnology  research  are  said  to  have  reached  as  high
			 	as  several  dozen.
			 	A  concrete  manifestation  of  this   	activity  is  seen  in  the  rush  of  new  installa-
			  	tions  of  high-level  safety  experimental  facilities  that  supposedly  are  indis-
			 	pensable  for  genetic  engineering  studies.    	These  facilities  enable  experiments
			  	using  microorganisms  under  containment  so  that  the  new  microorganisms  created  by
			  	genetic  engineering  will  not  escape   	into  the  environment.
			  	Manufacturers  state  with  a  happy  cry,   	"It  is  all  we  can  do   	to   	fill  orders  from

			  	biotechnology  will  unfold  in  a  wide  range  of  applications  such  as  petrochemi.cals,
			  	biomass,   	etc.,   	one  must  start  with  the  area  of  pharmaceuticals  in  order  to  be
			  	profitable."   	(M.   	Kanezawa,  head,  Dept.  of  Pharmaceutical  Work  Development,
	   	-	     	Kanegafuchi  Chemical  Co.  Ltd.)																	i
			  	The  "Third  Wave"   	of  Pharmaceuticals														    	'
			  	It  is   	also  said   	that  pharmaceutical  developments   	are  "about  to  be  washed  by  a
			  	third  w ave"   	(M.   	[or  A.]   	Niwa   	[or  Tamba],   	director,   	Life  Science  Research  Labora-
	   	_	     	tory,   	Mitsubishi   	Chemical  Ind.   	Ltd.).    	If  we  call  the  development  of  vaccination,
			  	which  began  with  Jenner  and  was  perfected  by  Pasteur,  the  "first  wave,"   	then  the
			  	establ.ishment  of   	chemotherapeutics  represented  by  antibioCics  is  the  "second
			  	wave,    	and  the  new  use  of  the  physiologically   	active  substances  which  are  present
			   	in  hum,~.n  body  in   	trace  amounts,   	and  which  could  not  be  used  as  pharmaceuticals  in
			   	the  pa:;t,  will  be  the  "third  wave."
			   	Interferon,  which  is  attracting  attention  as  a  new  anticancer,   	antivirus   	drug,
			   	and  human  insulin  without  side  effects  are  examples.    	Genentech  Inc.,   	a  venture
			   	business  specializing  in  genetic  engineering  in  the  United  States,   	collaborating
			   	with  major  pharn~aceutical  manufacturers  such  as  Hoffmann-La  Roche,   	Inc.   	and
			   	Eli  Lilly  and  Co.,  is  on  the  verge  of  mass-producing  these  new  drugs  using
			   	E.   	coli.
			   	These  physiologically  active  substances  have  very   	complex  chemical  structures
			   	and  are  virtually  impossible  to  manufacture  by  conventional  synthesis   	techniques.
			   	Some  substances  with  relatively  simple  structures   	are  being  synthesized.    	How-
			   	ever,   	most  physiologically  active  substances  have  to  be   	taken  out  of  human  body;
			   	this   	is   	the  case  with  growth  hormone,  which  is   	extracted   	from  the  hypopnysis  of  a
			   	corpse.    	"Due  to   	the  trace  amount  of  a  dose,   	lOg  is  enough  to  meet  the  world's
			   	annual  demand.    	However,  in  the  absense  of  a  mass   	production  process,   	lg  costs
			   	several  hundred  million  yen.    	It  costs  more  than  diamonds"   	(S.  Watanabe,  head,
