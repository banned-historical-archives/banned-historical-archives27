 WORLD TRADE:   President Nixon's trade bill has
 received generally favorable comment abroad.
 Although the Japanese press criticized the
 "strong protectionist coloring" of some features of
 the bill, the provisions for liberalizing world
 trade were welcomed.  The press urged Tokyo to ex-
 pand its efforts toward liberalization to avoid
 giving the US an "excuse" for adopting protectionist
 measures against Japan.   Some Japanese Government
 officials expressed fear that the powers requested
 by the President could be used to extract trade and
 currency concessions.
 Little in the US proposals surprised the Euro-
 peans and they are generally pleased that a start
 has been made toward a US negotiating mandate for
 multilateral bargaining scheduled to begin in Sep-
 tember.   Press comments on the whole approve of the
 "tone" of the President's proposals but, as in Japan,
 some commentators have noted the protectionist po-
 tential of the legislation and the dangers of a pos-
 sible trade war.   Considerable uncertainty persists
 about how the proposals may be changed by the Con-
 gress as well as how the Administration may ulti-
 mately use some of the broad powers requested.   In
 a public statement, the EC Commission again stressed
 reciprocity as the guiding rule for the negotiations.
 President Pompidou's economic adviser, Jean-Rene
 Bernard, has confirmed to the US Embassy that France
 will take a hard position in the trade negotiations.
 Along with some French press commentators, Bernard
 believes the US is out to dismantle the EC's common
 agricultural policy and he claims to see no positive
 benefits to the US from this "harsh policy toward
 the community."   The proposed changes in US tax laws
 governing subsidiaries operating abroad, meanwhile,
 have struck sensitive Belgian and Irish nerves.

 Both countries, particularly Ireland, offer generous
 incentives to US businesses that make an important
 contribution to economic growth.
 Officials of the General Agreement on Tariffs
 and Trade interpreted the President's proposals as
 a favorable sign that the multilateral trade talks
 will begin as scheduled in Tokyo next September.
 The authority requested by the President, they
 noted, would give the US power to negotiate flex-
 ibly and co       tively.

 C LEBANON-FEDAYEEN:   Lebanon brought Israel's
 latest raid before the UN Security Council yester-
 day, while Beirut remained tense following the
 funeral for slain fedayeen leaders.
 Schools and business establishments closed in
 observance of services for the dead.   Large crowds
 accompanied the cortege but the procession and
 demonstrations throughout the day were generally
 orderly.   There were, however, some instances of
 molesting of Westerners by some of three to four
 thousand armed fedayeen participating in the cere-
 monies.   The mood of the crowd was ugly; they chanted
 slogans denigrating the US, the Lebanese Government
 and Army.   Security forces, however, kept crowds
 away from the US Embassy.
 President Franjiyah has not yet accepted Prime
 Minister Salam's resignation, submitted Tuesday,
 and he continues to consult with political leaders
 on the formation of a new government.
 Lebanon's request yesterday to convene the
 Security Council reversed an earlier decision to
 go no further than lodge a protest.   The move was
 apparently prompted by domestic and Arab pressure
 for action.   In discussions with US officials, the
 Lebanese Ambassador said that among new elements
 influencing Beirut were Israeli threats of further
 commando operations against Lebanon.
 The Lebanese claim they seek a resolution that
 condemns all parties to terrorism,but it is not
 clear how much support for such wording they would
 have among the other Arabs.   The US mission at the
 UN reports that the Egyptians as well as the Soviets
 want the US to be forced to use the veto.  The
 Lebanese permanent representative opened debate
 last night by calling for "meaningful action" to
 end Israel's "a  r ssion" against Lebanon.

 LIBYA-ITALY:   Italy may be supplanting the
 USSR and Czechoslovakia as a supplier of ground
 forces equipment to Libya.   Rome has requested
 Washington's approval to export a second order of
 150 M-113 armored personnel carriers  (APCs)  to
 Libya.   The APCs are manufactured in Italy under
 US license and cannot be exported to third coun-
 tries without US approval.                              Permission to export
 the first 150 APCs was granted last year and most
 of them have already been delivered under a July
 1972 agreement.   The agreement also included self-
 propelled artillery, a large number of trucks,
 and other equipment.
 The USSR and Czechoslovakia have supplied
 Libya with almost 300 medium tanks, 350 APCs, and
 about 200 artillery pieces since 1970.   President
 Qadhafi's anti-Communist bent, however, has led
 him to seek other sources for arms.   No recent ne-
 gotiations with either Moscow or Prague for addi-
 tional equipment have been noted and deliveries
 under previous agreements have been virtually com-
 pleted.
 Italy's arms sales to Libya may lead to better
 relations between the two countries.   Rome recently
 received US approval to begin deliveries of 27

 *USSR-CHINA:   The Soviet regime has been making
 more information on China's strategic capabilities
 available to at least part of the Soviet public in
 recent months.
 Speakers at foreign affairs lectures in Lenin-
 grad have provided unusually specific details with
 respect to Peking's growing nuclear arsenal.  The
 audiences are usually made up of the party faithful
 and other citizens interested in international af-
 fairs.
 In late January, a public lecturer claimed
 that China had acquired a second-strike capability
 by putting missiles in silos built into rocks far
 from the Soviet border.  The speaker implied that
 the possibility of eliminating the Chinese missile
 threat by a "surgical" strike no longer exists.
 Early last month another lecturer stated that
 the Chinese have 80 to 100 nuclear warheads and
 could deliver these to targets deep within the So-
 viet Union.  A speaker at a public lecture last
 week predicted that China probably will have mis-
 siles with ranges of 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers by
 1975.   He spoke in terms of 40 to 50 missiles, but
 it is not clear whether he meant that all had this
 range.
 Although some lecturers have spoken of the
 need to keep in mind the contingency of war with
 China, the tone of their remarks on the Chinese
 nuclear capability has been matter-of-fact.  There
 has been no apparent attempt to alarm the audience
 or to convey the impression that hostilities are
 imminent, or even likely.
 The comments from Leningrad may be the first
 signs of an effort to accustom the Soviet public
 gradually to the notion that China already possesses
 a nuclear deterrent, while at the same time placing

 present Chinese capabilities in some perspective.
 A description of this kind could also serve as an
 indirect answer to those who may have wondered why
 the USSR does not simply destroy China's nuclear
 capability before it is too late.
 'The Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Re-
 search, Department of State, feels that the last
 sentence is too speculative and that the audience
 being addressed plays no role in Soviet decision
 making on such vital questions as nuclear strikes
 against China,  hence these lectures are simply a
 public information exercise.

 USSR-US:   Occidental Petroleum has signed an
 $8-billion fertilizer exchange contract with the
 USSR--the largest Soviet-American trade deal in
 history.     The agreement covers the sale of super-
 phosphate fertilizer to the USSR in return for So-
 viet urea and potash.  Under the terms of the
 20-year contract, Occidental will also build four
 ammonia-urea plants in the USSR and will be repaid
 with products of the plants.  Reports based on
 earlier negotiations indicated that the US firm
 would provide up to 1 million tons a year of su-
 perphosphoric acid used to produce phosphate fer-
 tilizer, rather than the finished fertilizer.
 The large shortfall in Soviet agricultural
 production last year and the chronic shortage of
 phosphate fertilizers encouraged the Soviets to
 conclude this agreement.  Although the USSR ranks
 second only to the US in production of phosphate
 fertilizers, their poor quality and outmoded as-
 sortment drastically reduce the effectiveness of
 the Soviet products.   In addition, Soviet ferti-
 lizers must be used over a sown acreage 70 percent
 greater than that in the US; half of the arable
 land in the USSR is deficient in phosphorus.   A
 larger supply of phosphate fertilizer could in-
 crease crop yields in the USSR, improve grain
 ualit    and accelerate the ripening of grain.

 CHINA:   Teng Hsiao-ping, the second highest
 ranking party official purged during the Cultural
 Revolution, reappeared at a banquet given by Premier
 Chou En-lai on 12 April.
 Although. Teng was given no party or government
 titles, the official Chinese news agency listed him
 with two vice-premiers in the government.  Teng had
 been a vice-premier and has probably been reinstated
 in his government post.   Peking appears to have
 skirted for the moment the more controversial issue
 of whether to return Teng to an important party po-
 sition..  Teng was formerly secretary-general of the
 party and sixth among the party's top leaders until
 his fall in December 1966.  Another former top party
 official, who was also a vice-premier, reappeared
 last December with his government title but has not
 been seen since.
 The decision to rehabilitate Teng may have been
 taken last month when important party officials were
 reportedly holding a meeting, although Teng's status
 has apparently been under discussion for several
 years.   Since 1968, there have been persistent rumors
 that he would be rehabilitated.
 With the current leadership unable to agree on
 a number of major personnel appointments, the return
 of former high-ranking officials may be an attempt
 by moderates such as Chou En-lai to push their can-
 didates forward.  Although Chou has differed with
 some of these veteran officials in the past, they
 are clearly more acceptable to him than the more
 radical newcomers who came to prominence during the
 Cultural Revolution.

 ITALY:   Prime Minister Andreotti faces growing
 erosion of his support.
 After repeated defeats in parliament, Andre-
 otti, on the eve of his visit to Washington, called
 for public votes of confidence.  Although the Sen-
 ate rejected government-sponsored articles on edu-
 cational reform by five votes in secret balloting,
 in three public confidence votes Andreotti won by
 a slim margin.   In contrast to the defections in
 the secret balloting, the government parties evi-
 dently held together well against a combined oppo-
 sition of the neofascist National Right, the Com-
 munists, and the Socialists.
 Earlier this month, an initiative by Vice Prime
 Minister Tanassi's Social Democrats for formal in-
 terparty talks about a successor government signaled
 spreading dissatisfaction with the Andreotti govern-
 ment.   The principal issues are economic policy and
 Socialist relations with the Italian Communists.
 The Republicans, Liberals, and Socialists lay par-
 ticular stress on economic issues, principally re-
 storing growth and stemming inflation.   The Social
 Democrats want the Socialists to withdraw from Com-
 munist-run local governments.   The Christian Demo-
 crats emphasize both issues.
 Despite unrest and talk of a new government,
 political leaders at the moment seem to favor post-
 poning action until June on whether or not to return
 to a center-left alignment.   Early in June a Chris-
 tian Democratic party congress will permit assess-
 ment of the strength of the                            eft and right within
 the party.

 URUGUAY:   The lines between the military and
 organized labor are being more clearly drawn.
 In a communique issued on 9 April, the armed
 forces commanders warned the Communist-controlled
 National Convention of Workers  (CNT)  to end its in-
 volvement in politics and to abandon the tactic of
 calling disruptive strikes and take-overs of fac-
 tories.   The document also gave tacit support to
 President Bordaberry's plan to submit to Congress
 legislation that would strictly regulate organized
 labor.
 Both Bordaberry and the armed forces command-
 ers had several reasons for wanting to get the com-
 munique on the record.   The President wanted a mil-
 itary commitment to support his union bill and a
 specific criticism of the CNT for demanding his
 resignation.   The military chiefs desired to cor-
 rect any impression that officers' recent contacts
 with labor mean that the armed forces are moving
 leftward and to warn the unions that the traditional
 rules of the political game will be changed as a
 result of the military's assuming a strong role in
 the government.
 The immediate reaction of the CNT was a fairly
 moderate statement playing down the differences be-
 tween the military and labor and claiming that the
 two institutions should work together against the
 common enemy--the "oligarchy."   In the long run,
 however,  serious friction bet een the military and

 YUGOSLAVIA:   Defense Minister Ljubicic has
 been dismissed from the party watchdog organization
 in the military during a general membership rota-
 tion.   Rumors also indicate that his departure from
 the ministry is only a matter of time.   His main
 political asset in the past has been unflinching
 loyalty to Tito, but he may have angered Tito by
 making a speech that implied threats against Vienna
 last December during a controversy over the Slo-
 venian minority in Austria.   Ljubicic's remarks
 brought a sharp reply from Vienna.   A recent ar-
 ticle in the party presidium's theoretical journal
 indirectly attacked this speech and pointedly re-
 minded the military that it should not threaten
 Yugoslavia's neighbors.
 Tito anticipates that the military will play
 a key role in maintaining the stability and effec-
 tiveness of the regime after his departure, and he
 will want a Defense Minister who is fully trust-
 worthy.   Likely successors to Ljubicic include
 Chief of Staff Stane Potocar and Dzemal Sarac,
 secretary of the party's military organization.

 LAOS:   North Vietnamese units supported by at
 least two tanks continued heavy artillery attacks
 on government units near Tha Viang on 12. April.
 Some government units have begun to pull back from
 forward positions.   Poor flying weather is restrict-
 ing Lao T-28 support, and heavy ground fire is ham-
 pering efforts to evacuate government casualties.
 Morale is poor among government troops .and, in the
 absence of air support, a general withdrawal from
 the Tha Viang area may be imminent.  Most govern-
 ment leaders are in the royal capital of Luang Pra-
 bang for the celebration of the Lao new year and
 there has been no official comment on the situation

 at Tha Viang.
 EC:   The Council of Agricultural Ministers
 failecT-to agree on the EC Commission's farm price
 recommendations for the 1973/74 marketing year.
 The Commission proposes that prices be raised by
 modest amounts, which would vary from country to
 country.    This would re-establish common prices and
 eliminate the compensatory taxes and subsidies
 prompted by currency shifts among EC countries dur-
 ing the past two years.  West Germany, whose cur-
 rency has appreciated, opposes this proposal because
 it does not entail a price gain for German grain
 producers.   The UK, whose currency has depreciated,
 also opposes the proposal because it would cause
 excessive price hikes there.   Despite these diver-
 gent positions, the Agricultural Ministers may be
 able to agree on new prices when they meet again
 on 16 April.   To mollify the Germans, EC Commis-
 sioner Lardinois has said privately that he may
 recommend slightly higher price increases than have
 been proposed to allow a token price boost for Ger-
 man grain farmers.

 BURMA:  Rangoon has decided to speed up its
 offshore oil development.   German and Japanese gov-
 ernmental oil organizations and about 25 private
 US companies soon will be invited to bid for ex-
 ploration rights.   Burma has indicated that in the
 initial bidding it will distribute three of 17 off-
 shore blocks, one to each nation.   The other 14
 blocks will be allocated later by Rangoon on the
 basis of performance in the initial blocks and the
 terms offered.   By seeking foreign private invest-
 ment in this instance Burma has reversed its normal
 policy of requiring that all foreign financing for
 development purposes come only from governments.
 Rangoon probably hopes that offshore production
 eventually will eliminate the need to import petro-
 leum, which accounted for 5 percent of total imports
 in 1971, and increase export earnings.
