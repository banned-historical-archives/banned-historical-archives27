 SALT
 RED STAR ARTICLE ATTACKS U.S. CRUISE MISSILE DEVELOPMrNT
 A Soviet military commentator writing in RED STAR ha.-, sharply criticized
 U.S. plans to develop long-range submarine-launched r.ruise missiles,
 asserting that their deployment wouiu enable the Un:4':.ed States to
 circumvent the restraints of the 1972 U.S.-Soviet, irl.rerim agreement
 limiting strategic offensive arms.  At the same tirel.!,  recent Soviet
 comment on the SALT negotiations has continued to e.nvey a sense of
 progress and restra:;.ned optimism that a new SALT agreement will
 result from Brezhnev'3 forthcoming U.S. visit.
 CRITICISM OF U.S.     Reserve Captain N. Shaskolsliy, writing in the
 CRUISE MISSILES       10 September TED STAR, charged directly only
 that the Pentagon's "plans" for the cruise
 missile indicated its desire to fuel the arms race and frustrate detente--
 charges that are routine in Soviet discussions of U.S. drill:.ary programs.
 But through his selection of "foreign press material" to describe the
 U.S. cruise miss-'1e program, Shaskolskiy in effect argued that full
 realization of the program would allow the United States to sidestep the
 1972 interim agreement--which covered onlT ballistic missiles--by
 allowing the deployment of strategic (cruse) 'missiles on up to 50
 submarines in addition to the 44 submarines with ballistic missiles
 allowed by the agreement.   (A cruise missile is, in effect, an unmanned
 aircraft which unlike a ballistic missile remains within the atmosphere
 throughout its flight.)
 Shaskolskiy clearly implied that the rekindled U.S. interest in cruise
 missiles was a direct result of the limitations on ballistic missiles
 set by the earlier SALT agreement.  He stopped short of directly asserting
 that the cruise missile program was incompatible with the 1972 agreements,
 as USA Institute observer Gecrgiy Svyatov had charged in relation to  the
 Trident submarine program in RED STAR articles in 1972 and 1973.
 Shaskolskiy's article represents the first known Soviet comment on U.S.
 cruise missile development since such missiles became a SALT issue in
 the wake of the November 1974 Vladivostok u.iderstanding between President
 Ford and CPSU General Secretary Brezhnev.  However, ZA RUBEZHOM, a
 Moscow-based weekly survey of the foreign press, last March reprinted
 a Herbert Scoville article in the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR that made
 similar charges.   The Scoville reprint had concluded that "the development
 of cruise missiles for submarines should be stopped immediately.  The
 United States cannot allow itself to create all. the technically feasible
 types of weapons not banned under the SALT agreements."
 Quoting Western sources, Shaskolskiy noted that the submarine-launched
 cruise missile was designed to be compatible with conventional torpedo

 tubes and to fly at low altitudes where defense radar is less
 effective.  He noted further that the new missile is scheduled to
 enter service in 1979, test resul t-s so far having been termed
 "excellent."  His article was published as part of regular series
 that discusses Western weapons developrents, nominally on the basis
 of foreign press sources.  Contributions to this series normally
 eschew politically sensitive issues.  But the Shaskols?'.iy article
 seems to carry implications for the current round of SALT in Geneva
 where the status of cruise missiles in a final agreement must be
 decided.
 Shaskolskiy's arguments suggest his support for a total ban on cruise
 missiles.  That po::ition was implied, for example, in his stress on
 the difficulties of verifying limits on such missiles if they were
 incorporated in a new agreement, due to their similarity to tactical
 missiles, their compatibility with conventional torpedo tubes, and a
 restricted capab.lity to monitor cruise missile testing programs due
 to their low altitude.  MosLu  normally shuns public discussion of
 technical issues such as verification and, in particular, discussion
 of the possibility that limits under considcration might be difficult
 to verify by national technical meai.s.
 ASSESSMENT OF      While as usual there has been very little direct
 SALT PROGRESS      comment on the SALT negotiations from Moscow, Soviet
 media have made use of the Ford-Brezhnev meetings
 at Helsinki and the August visit to Moscow by a U.S. Congressional
 dk.legation to suggest that only technical difficulties remain and to
 reject the notion of "'some Western observers" that an impasse has been
 reached.
 In a Moscow radio roundtable discussion on 12 August, TASS General
 Director Leonid Zamyatin quoted Brezhnev as having told the U.S.
 congressmen that "probably two or three meetings, including one at
 the foreign ministers level," would be required co resolve these
 technical problems.  Despite such official optimism, o:me concern about
 Washington's thinking on strategic issues seeaaad evident in remarks by
 CPSU Politburo candidate member Boris Ponomarev at an early July
 Kremlin conference on the 40th anniversary of the 7th Comintern
 Congress.  The text of Ponomarev's speech, just published in KOMMUNIST
 No. 11, 1975, reveals his complaint that some officials in the West
 "have again started saying that the United States should possess
 superior military potential."

 NUCLEAR  TEST  BAN
 MOSCOW PROPOSES NEW COMPREHENSIVE TEST PROHIBITION AT UN
 The new Soviet draft proposal for a comprehensive ban on nuclear
 weapons tests, offered as the. USSR's yearly arms control initiative
 for the UN General Assembly session that opened 16 September,
 rr:iterates Moscow's known position on a total test ban and incor-
 porates two relatively recent shifts in the Soviet position.  The
 text of the draft treaty submitted to the United Nations was
 published in PRAVDA on 12 September.
 The two adjustments in the Soviet position evident in the published
 draft treaty are these:
 +  The treaty would enter into force only after ratification by
 all nuclear powers, a position that Moscow first assumed in early
 1974.
 -1- Provision:. for exchange of seismic data as a supplement to
 national technical means of verification of the ban are incorporated
 into the text of the document as binding obligations.   In past
 years, Moscow had said it would agree to such an exchange on a
 voluntary basis subsequent to agreement on a total test ban.  The
 evolution in recent years from voluntary exchanges to binding
 obligations was confirmed last July in the U.S.-Soviet threshold
 test ban signed in Moscow, which stipulated the exchange of such
 data.
 There is no provisie,n for on-site inspection in the current draft.
 Moscow has long argued that such inspection was unnecessary in light
 of advances in the capability of national technical means, and it
 has contended that U.S. insistence on on-site inspection disguised
 a lack of serious U.S. interest in a total test ban.  The draft
 Soviet treaty specifically exempts peaceful explosions from its
 provisions banning nuclear tests.  Such explosions wot.ld be allowed
 subject, for non-nuclear weapon states, to guidelines established
 in the 1968 Treaty on Non-proliferation, and for states possessing
 nuclear weapons, to procedures yet to be agreed.    In  the latter
 case, "due consideration" would be given to recommendations of the
 International Atomic Energy Agency.
 The USSR has regularly voiced its support for a total ban on nuclear
 weapons tests since the 1950's.  Reacting to criticism of the
 limited nature of the 1974 U.S.-Sovie` threshold ban, Brezhnev and
 other officials had publicly reiterated that the Soviet Union was

 willing at any time to agree to a full ban.   In recent years the
 Chinese have increasingly replaced the United States as the main
 target of Soviet criticism for the failure of efforts to reach
 agreement on a comprehensive test ban.
 Early Soviet comment on the new initiative has shed little further
 light on it.  Underscoring its public relations aspect, one
 commentator on the 14 September Moscow domestic radio roundtable
 on foreign affairs said the new initiative "testifies to the fact
 that the Soviet Unior. is implementing the all-European conference's
 decisions not in words but in deeds."

 MOSCOW SNIPES AT SINAI ACCORD, U.S. POLICY, EGYPTIAN ATTITUDE
 Soviet media have continued to give only scant but critical attention
 to the recent Sinai disengagement agreement.   Scattered routine-level
 comment has again conveyed Moscow's displeasure with aspects of
 the accord and the U.S. diplomatic role in negotiating it.  Through
 selective citation of foreign reaction, Moscow has implicitly
 criticized Cairo for cooperating with Washington and for entering
 into the new pact with Israel.   Such criticism as has appeared in
 the Soviet press has come not in the major central papers but,
 initially, in the weekly NEW TIMES and subsequently in MOSKOVSKAYA
 PRAVDA and RURAL LIFE.  A wide-ranging critique of the accord in
 the 7 September MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA in effect recapitulated earlier
 comment, highlighting as a "complicating element" the provision
 for a U.S. presence at the Sinai early-warning stations.*  A RURAL
 LIFE article on the 13th warned that U.S. attempts to obtain unilateral
 advantages "directly or indirectly" in the Middle East would be
 incompatible with detente.
 Moscow has reacted cautiously to Western press reports concerning
 the existence of secret understandings among the United States,
 Israel and Egypt supplementing the public agreements. Careful
 to use non-Soviet sources, Moscow has publicized reported secret
 Egyptian commitments, citing  agreements to ease its stand in the
 Arab economic boycott against firms dealing with Israel and to reduce
 its anti-Israeli propaganda by stopping broadcasts to Israel and
 shutting down Palestinian broadcasts from Cairo.  Despite Moscow's
 circumspection in criticizing Cairo and its avoidance of direct
 attacks on President as-Sadat, there have been ample signs in Cairo
 media that Soviet-Egyptian relations have become increasingly strained,
 particularly following Moscow's refusal to attend the 4 September
 signing of the Sinai accord in Geneva.  And as-Sadat has been markedly
 explicit recently in citing Egyptian grievances concerning Soviet
 policy.
 U.S. ROLE      For the second time since the initialing of the Sinai
 accord, TASS Deputy Director General Sergey Losev has
 in effect questioned the U.S. commitment to detente in the light of
 U.S. actions in the Middle East.  His first such comment came in a
 2 September broadcast to North American audiences, and he again
 broached this idea in a 13 September RURAL LIFE article devoted largely

 to proclaiming the benefits of improved U.S.-Soviet relations
 and warning against persons and actions opposed to detente.  The
 fact that Losev's comments appeared in a specialized central press
 newspaper not noted for important foreign affairs articles seems
 to indicate Soviet hesitancy to express such views in a more
 authoritative vehicle.
 The concluding section of Losev's article began by criticizing in
 standard terms an alleged U.S. military buildup of its allies,
 asserting that such a policy was fraught with "highly dangerous
 consequences," especially in the Middle East, "which is currently
 being 'injected' with massive doses of the latest American arms."
 Losev then went ont to warn that
 Attempts to gain unilateral advantages directly or
 indirectly, including such attempts in the Near East
 area, would be incompatible with the strengthening of
 relations between the United States and the USSR; and
 it is not superfluous to recall this principle in this
 specific situation.
 An article by IZVESTIYA political commentator Mikhaylov in MOSKOVSKAYA
 PRAVDA on the 7th represented one of Moscow's most extensive critiques
 of the accord thus far, but the article largely recapitulated previous
 comment, and its appearance in the Moscow city party and soviet organ,
 rather than the central press, again suggests restraint.  Mikhaylov's
 most notable objection to the accord was his presentation of the
 talks as "obviously of a separate nature," despite the fact that the
 signing of the agreement took place in Geneva "to make it look as
 if the talks had taken place within the framework" of the Geneva
 conference.  Mikhaylov also complained that the agreement simply
 "freezes" the Mideast situation, and he objected to the idea of a
 U.S. presence in Sinai "replacing" the monitoring by UN mil..Ltary
 observers under UN Security Council decision.
 Moscow has continued to promote an impression of U.S. domestic unease
 over the new Sinai accord.  TASS reviewed a PRAVDA international review
 article by S. Vishnevskiy on the 14th, for example, which claimed that
 U.S. public and congressional opinion has become concerned over recent
 Mideast events, including Israel's prospective military buildup
 following the recent U.S. decision to lift its suspension of new
 weapons supplies and "plans for placing American experts in the
 Sinai, etc."  According to TASS, the article contrasted these develop-
 ments with the approach it said was favored by "many sober-minded
 Americans," one of "realism ant circumspection" toward "difficult
 international problems" which takes into account "the mutual interests
 of all the sides concerned."

 A short TASS account of President Ford's 16 September press con-
 ference noted that it was devoted "chiefly" to U.S.-Israeli
 relations and the Mideast situation.  The dispatch reported the
 President as saying, with regard to press reports of U.S. promises
 of F-16 fighter bombers and Pershing missiles to Israel, that the
 United States "did not give any firm promise" in this regard,
 but that these types of arms were included in the shopping list
 and would be discussed with Israeli. representatives.  As to
 whether the United States was moving toward concluding a security
 treaty with Israel, TASS reported President Ford as saying he
 would not use this term, and would simply reiterate that the United
 States had always supplied Israel with considerable quantities of
 military equipment and intended to do so in the future.
 CRITICISM      To convey thinly veiled criticism of Cairo for signing
 OF CAIRO       the Sinai accord, Moscow has sought to press the point
 that Egypt has entered into "secret understandings"
 with Israel and the United States, attributing such reports to non-
 Soviet sources.
 1-  Moscow's treatment of Egypt's 11 September suspension of broadcast
 privileges for the Voice of Palestine in Cairo is illustrative.   By
 citing Palestinian and Western sources, and ignoring Egyptian justi-
 fications, Moscow implied its support for the Palestinian-Syrian
 argument that Egypt had betrayed the Palestinians  in agreeing
 secretly to end propaganda against. Israel.   Soviet reportage on this
 issue has blurred the distinction between, on the one hand, Cairo's
 suspension of Voice of Palestine broadcasts because of what Cairo
 considered. unacceptable Palestinian criticisms related to the Sinai
 accord and, on the other, Cairo's reported agreement to reduce its
 own propaganda broadcasts against Israel as a nonpublic supplement
 to that accord.
 4-  Moscow has also transparently, if indirectly, swiped at Cairo in
 comment emphasizing the value of the Arab economic boycott of foreign
 companies dealing with Israel.  An Arabic-language commentary on
 29 August by A. Zlatorunskiy criticized the anticipated Sinai accord
 for "certain political aspects," referring to New York TIMES and
 REUTER accounts of reported Egyptian agreement to ease the economic
 boycott of U.S. and possibly European firms.  A commentary in Arabic
 on 8 September, pegged to a recent meeting of the Arab boycott
 organization, stressed that the boycott was "among the important
 steps" hindering Western-Israeli cooperation and had caused Israel
 difficulties in obtaining certain raw materials from regular Western
 suppliers.  The broadcast approvingly presented, as the opinion of

 the boycott organization, the view that "it is necessary for
 the Arabs to continue to use the boycott weapon  in the struggle
 against the a;g:essors."*
 1-  A third theme of Soviet comment, U.S. military aid to Israel,
 also at times seems implicitly critical of. Egypt for having been
 duped as to Israel's ultimate intentions.  A Moscow domestic service
 commentary by V. Aleksandrov on the lOch charged that Israel, "under
 the guise of peace talks," was concurrently seeking additional U.S.
 aid to enable it to "dictate conditions to the Arabs" and "blatantly
 challenge UN decisions."  TASS on the 8th took note of Drew Middleton's
 6 September New York TIMES article on Israel's arms procurement
 list, emphasizing the large quantities and sophisticated nature of
 the planned purchases.  Tying the military aid to the Sinai accord,
 TASS asserted without amplification that the changes  he accord would
 bring in the Arab-Israeli` military situation encouraged Israel to
 build up its military forces.
 SOVIET-EGYPTIAN    Moscow has continued to take no direct notice of
 RELATIONS          President as-Sadat's continuing public complaints
 against the Soviet Union, but has responded in low
 key to paraphrases of his remarks in the Cairo press.  A Moscow radio
 commentary in Arabic by A. Timoshkin on the 15th, for example, feigned
 surprise that "articles in some Cairo papers" would "mislead their
 readers regarding Soviet foreign policy in the Middle East."  As one
 example, Timoshkin ostensibly took issue with AL-AKHBAR for alleging
 that the USSR benefited from Arab disunity--a charge made on 4 September
 by as-Sadat in a speech to a joint session of the People's Assembly
 and ASU Central Committee.**
 Soviet annoyance over charges that the USSR has tried to obstruct
 a Mideast peace settlement was registered recently at the low level
 of Moscow's "unofficial" Radio Peace and Progress, which in an Arabic
 Egypt has exhibited sensitivity to charges that Cairo is no
 longer seriously committed to the Arab boycott.  Egyptian Foreign
 Minister Fahmi, in a statement published on the 12th by Cairo's
 AL-AHRAM, emphasized that Egypt remained committed to the principle
 of the boycott and denied that any Egyptian document pledged Egypt
 to lift the boycott from any organization or company.
 **  Moscow in the past has transparently responded to as-Sadat's
 criticisms through the device of answering press replays of his
 statements; see, for example, the TRENDS of 23 July 1975, pages 3-6.

 CHINA  FOREIGN  RELATIONS
 PRC SCORES CANCELING nc U.S. MAYORS' TRIP, NOTES OTHER VISITS
 Peking bzs responded belatedly and at. a low level to the U.S. announce-
 ment on 8 September canceling the scheduled visit to China by a U.S.
 mayors delegat-+,on because the Chinese had refused to admit one
 delegation member, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico.   China's
 response was conveyed by a 1.6 September NCNA report giving the text
 of "observations" by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs,
 the host organization for the mayors' visit.  These "observations"
 discreetly avoided mentioning U.S. officials and reaffirmed China's
 continued desire to promote Sino-U.S. exchanges under terms of the
 February 1972 Shanghai communique.  Peking's intent to continue
 such exchanges also was reflected in recent Chinese coverage of the
 first PRC trade delegation to travel to the United States and of the
 closing of the Chinese archeological exhibit's 8-month U.S. tour.
 Peking's reaction to the mayors' visit cancellation--coming over a
 week after the National Committee for U.S.-China relations, the
 sponsoring group on the U.S. side, had issued its press release--recalls
 Peking's low-key response on 2 April this year, after the State Department
 had announced cancellation six days earlier of a Chinese entertainment
 troupe's scheduled U.S. tour because the Chinese insisted on including
 a song regarding the "liberation" of Taiwan in the troupe's repertoire.*
 At that time Peking's reaction came in an NCNA report of an "interview"
 with the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign
 Countries and the spokesman of the foreign ministry's information
 department.  The language in the current response duplicates that of
 the 2 April complaint, accusing the U.S. side of "unreasonably" demanding
 Chinese concessions, of putting forth "groundless" charges, and of going
 against the "spirit" of the Shanghai communique, and it similarly
 concludes with stress on Peking's desire to continue Sino-U.S. exchanges.
 The "observations" on the mayoral visit cancellation claimed that
 because of the "special situation in Puerto Rico," it would be
 "inappropriate" and "inconvenient" to welcome the San Juan mayor,
 adding that Peking had sought to substitute him with someone else.**
 *    Peking's reaction ^t that time is discussed in the TRENDS of
 2 April 1975, pages 17-18.
 **   Though maintaining a low posture on the issue, Peking publicly
 characterizes Puerto Rico as under U.S. "colonial rule" and favorably
 notes the Putrto Rican people's "struggle" for independence--a position
 most recently set forth in a 28 July 1975 NCNA review of the economic
 situation on the island.

 it claimed that the U.S.           "unreasonably clung to iLr; own idea,"
 announced the cancellation "one-si.ded:Iy," and made groundless charges
 about which the Chinese "cannot but express our regret."  it went on
 to rebut as a "pretext for sel.C-)usta.f i.ctlLion" the 11.5. posi.tio.r
 that Chinese refusal. of the San Juan mayor had introduced a political
 element into such non-government exchange;; out of keeping with the
 spirit of the Shanghai communique.  The Chinese pointedly kept open
 the invitation to the mayors;, however, exiressing conviction that if
 the U.S. side acted appropriately,  the visit "will ultimately take
 place and other exchanges between China and the United States will
 proceed smoothly."
 OTHER CONTACTS,      Peking has continued to give favorable coverage
 VISITS IN U.S.       to the current visit by a PRC trade delegation
 to the United States, with NCNA on the 10th
 reporting tine group's visit with President Ford and Secretary Kissinger
 on 8 September.  NCNA noted that President Ford "welcomed" the
 delegation and asked them to convey his regards Lo Chairman Mao and
 Chou En-lai.  This coverage was less effusive than NCNA treatment of
 meetings by former President Nixon with visiting Chinese gymnasts in
 July 1974 and with PRC journalists in May 1973, when NCNA had quoted
 selected excerpts from the former President's formal statements on
 those occasions.  But President Ford did not make a formal statement
 upon receiving the Chinese delegates, as Nixon had done.
 Peking at the same time has sustained its extraordinary coverage of
 the recently completed U.S. tour by the PRC archeological exhibit.
 NCNA on 29 August reported a 27 August reception in San Francisco at
 which PRC Liaison Office Chief Huang Ilua recalled the Nixon trip to
 China and the Shanghai conununique and lauded the "step-by-  tep" develop-
 ment of Sino-U.S. exchanges.  The report also cited U.S. Assistant
 Secretary of State Richardson's reference to Secretary Kissinger's
 view that "normalization of relations" with the PRC was a "permanent
 and essential element" in U.S. foreign policy.  NCNA on 1 September
 similarly played up the exhibit's success as symptomatic of the
 "irresistible historical trend" in Sino-American friendship, and the
 agency on the 12th disclosed that on 10 September PRC museun?.officials
 had received U.S. officials aeclDmpanying the relics exhibit back to
 China.

 superpowers conforms with the keynote Chinese address  at  this year's
 session, which waF; softer on the United States and more explicit in
 depicting the USSR as the main l.nternntl.onal economic exploiter than
 was the major Chinese ;ddress at the April 1974 meeting.*
 Peking's only commen'- thus far on Secretary Kissinger's message to
 this year.', special session was contained in two paragraphs of a
 2 September NCNA review of speeches the previous clay.  The review noted
 critically that Kissinger had stressed the "worn-out tune of
 'interdependence" and was "attacking" oil-producing countries.
 Last April NCNA devoted four paragraphs to criticizing the Secretary's
 speech, stating that he not only "attacked" the oil producers but
 "threatened" the Third World and "groundlessly attributed" inflation
 to the increased price of international oil.   NCNA this  year also
 markedly reduces: from last year its coverage of UN delegates' and other
 foreign statements rebutting Kissinger's message.
 In contrast, Peking's criticism of the USSR was both: more extensive and
 more authoritati,re than !ts treatment of Gromyko's speech at last year's
 session.  Accompanying the usual NCNA  comment, a signed 13 September
 PEOPLE'S DAILY article harshly refuted the Soviet address this year by
 UN Ambassador Malik.  The ar.yacle gave a lengthy diatribe against Soviet
 economic policies, referring to the Soviets as "bloodsuckers, speculators,
 unfeeling creditors and merchants of death," and adding emphatically
 that "the old-line impccrtalists would be inferior in comparison with
 the Kremlin, as the latter has not only applied their traditional methods
 of exploiting the developing countries but perfected them."  Debunking
 Malik's claim of a "coincidence of views" between th;a USSR and the
 developing Third World states on economic issues, PEOPLE'S DAILY
 complained that the USSR, in its "plunder and fraud," has used such
 propaganda "as a pernicious supplement to rifle shots and leather whips."

 PORTUGAL
 MOSCOW DISPLAYS UNCERTAINTY IN TREATING POLITICAL SITUATION
 Moscow has seemed indecisive as to what tack to take vis-a-vis the
 various forces involved in efforts, to form a new government in
 Portugal, and has shown a tendency to fall back on Portuguese
 Communist Party (PCP) StaL:.,aents.  Thus Soviet media have reported
 PCP assertions of the need for "compromise" among forces attempting
 to form the sixth provisional government to be headed by premier-
 designate Pinheiro de Azevedo. Moscow has also given warmer treatment
 to the PCP's erstwhile chief enemy--the Socialist Party (PS)--since
 PS leader Mario Soares' statement to the effect that the possibility
 of a coup from the right was an immediate threat.  The PS' principal
 ally, the center-left Popular Democratic Party (PPD), has, however,
 been criticized by Moscow and the PCP for. "anticommunist" statements
 and an uncooperative attitude.  While the PPD has been labeled a
 "rightwing social democratic party" which is "outside the revolutionary
 process," PCP leader Alvaro r,inhal nevertheless has been quoted by
 Moscow as saying that PCP members may participate in a government with
 members of the PPD.  Moscow reported without comment Azevedo's remark
 that communists, socialists, and popular democrats had "reached
 agreement" on a "co-w,n political program for the future government."
 Moscow has also continued to criticize Western interference in
 Portuguese affairs, currently giving emphasis to ITT and other "foreign
 monopolies" whose CIA connections and "economic blackmail" have been
 called reminiscent of the pressure exerted against Chile before the
 1973 coup.
 DOMESTIC SITUATION    Moscow has continued to stress Alvaro Cunhal's
 call for a dialog of progressive forces, with
 Albert Grigoryants noting, on Moscow radio's 14 September observers'
 roundtable program, that "broad discussions among all forces interested
 in the revolutionary process" would be helpful.  And Soviet media have
 emphasized the PCP's willingness to compromise so that a new government
 can be formed.   Thus, in an 11 September PRAVDA article, correspondents
 Yermakov and Kotov reported Cunhal's statement that "the way out of the
 impasse can be fcund only on the basis of a compromise" because "no
 single political formation, including the MFA," could solve the
 problem alone.   In keeping with this seemingly conciliatory approach,
 Moscow has toned dowc! its blasts at the Portuguese Sccialists,
 especially since Soares' remark--in a L'EUROPEO interview replayed by
 Lisbon domestic service on the 13th--to the effect that a coup led by
 fascists, rather than communists, now seemed the "most likely threat"
 to Portugal.

 1.7 SEPTEMBER 1975
 However, Moscow has stepped up its criticism of the socialist-allied
 PPD, roundtable observer Cr.igoryants noting that the formation of
 the new government "was delayed bccau^e of the position taken by the
 leaders of the Popular Democratic Party."      Connecting the PPD with
 plans being made by "reactionary circles," Grigoryants asserted that
 "counterrevolution is abandoning all camouflage" in its efforts to
 reverse the revolutionary process.  TASS on the 12th noted Cunhal's
 statement that, while "the Socialist Party began to recognize the
 presence of a real threat of fascism," the PPD failed to see the
 danger and, "on the contrary, went to a direct collusion with the
 fascists."
 Although PRAVDA on the 11th reported the PCP as saying that the PPD
 was "outside the revolutionary process" and therefore unfit to
 participate in the government, other Moscow comment has shown an
 ambivalent attitude possibly because of an awareness that the PPD
 almost certainly will participate in the sixth government when formed.
 Thus TASS on the 12th reported Cunhal's refusal to enter into a
 "government, based on the principle of a classic party coalition,"
 but went on to quote him as saying that PCP members could participate,
 as individuals, in a government composed of members of other parties
 "or even members of the People's Democratic Party."  Having given
 cautious approval to premier-designate Azevedo, Moscow reported
 Azevedo's 13 September television address in which he stated that an
 agreement had been reached between the communists, socialists and
 popular democrats on a common political program.
 Soviet commentators, seemingly unsure of the line to take, have
 offered contradictory explanations for the removal of Azevedo's
 predecessor; Vasco Goncalves.*  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA claimed on
 9 September that "Goncalves' decision to refuse the post offered to
 him was by no means the result of pressure from the right" but was
 "an active step in the direction of further uniting the revolutionary
 wing."  A 13 September IZVESTIYA article, however, admitted that
 Goncalves "made his  exit under pressure from rightists" and that
 his departure was seen by the Portuguese press as "a temporary
 concession on the part of the leftwing forces."
 FOREIGN MONOPOLIES     ITT's announcement of a suspension of financial
 support for its Portuguese subsidiaries sparked
 a series of comments on Western economic pressure, typified by Rudolf
 Puchkov's 13 September PRAVDA article accusing "foreign monopolies"
 of conducting a "deliberate policy of economic blackmail."  Puchkov

 VIETNAM
 PRG STATEMENT SETS OFF CAMPAIGN FOR SOUTHERN ECONOMIC REFORMS
 Vietnamese communist leaders have launched what appears to be a major
 campaign to revamp South Vietnam's economy by eliminating big
 entrepreneurs who flourished under the former government and replacir,
 them with structures suitable for the "advance toward socialism"
 announced by DRV Premier Pham Van Dong in his 1. September DRV National
 Day speech.  The basic blueprint for the present mass campaign is a
 highly authoritative 10 September Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG)
 statement, the first such government statement issued since the end
 of the war.*  The statement lays down a 14-point program indicating the
 regime's intention to deal harshly with the ills besetting the South's
 postwar economy, and in a manner apparently designed to bring it into
 conformity with its socialist model in the North.
 The PRIG statement, titled "on some policies on the restoration and
 development of industry and trade and the elimination of comprador
 bourgeois monopolists," and attendant publicity make it plain that a
 vigorous government crackdown is now underway to punish severely South
 Vietnamese businessmen who have been accused of "disrupting the market"
 and "undermining the revolution" through such alleged practices as
 speculation, smuggling, and hoarding, as well as allegedly maintaining
 contacts with "foreign spies and CIA agents."
 In an apparent effort by the regime to enlist popular support for its
 policy of making scapegoats of the "comprador bourgeoisie" and to link
 their "crimes" with the South's economic problems, the media have been
 publicizing lists of those arrested and their crimes.  These indicate
 that the illegal activities for which they have been charged mainly
 involved consumer goods, such as monosodium glutamate seasoning, rice,
 textiles, and bicycle parts--products whose price manipulation would
 directly affect the livelihood of the average person.  As evidence of
 the beneficial results from the government's policy of punishing these
 "comprador bourgeoisie," a 14 September VNA report noted that prices of
 "many commodities" in Saigon's Chinese section of Cholon had dropped
 "20 to 50 percent" following issuance of the P:tG statement.
 Media reports of government attempts to curtail illegal business operations
 have made a number of references to Chinese being detained.  According to
 a 21 September Liberation Radio account, "many of those arrested are of
 Chinese ^:igin, and some are foreigners."  The same broadcast openly

 charged them with "exploiting Vietnamese .  .  . and Vietnamese
 compatriots of Chinese origin."  An earlier Liberation Radio broadcast
 on the 10th, in reporting the arrests of "ringleaders" who had
 reportedly "speculated" in monosodium glutamate, claimed that one
 of them had "closely colluded with .  .  . Taiwan Kuomintang special
 service agents."  An earlier instance of Vietnamese communist media
 focusing partictl/Lr attention on the Chinese was a 12 July Liberation
 Press Agency (LPA) report on people returning to the countryside from
 the Saigon-Gia Dinh area.  Noting that more than 1.25,000 people had
 gone to the rural areas since 10 May, the LPA report pointed out that
 some "5,000 Chinese residents in Saigon" had received farm tools for
 their use in Binh Phuoc Province.
 Premier Pham Van Dong ind?cated in his 1 September DRV Nat:t.onal Day
 remarks that South Vietnam now would be included--along with the
 North--in Vietnam's "advance toward socialism."  Without further
 elaboration, Dong noted the existence of a "nationwide plan" that was
 to be the basis for "new developmental steps" in the South.*  While
 the 10 September PRG statement could not be construed as a nationwide
 plan, it could represent some of the "developmental steps" to which
 the Premier was alluding.
 The 10 September issue of the Saigon newspaper GIAI PHONG (Liberation),
 in an editorial on the campaign, cited the National Day speeches of
 both Pham Van Dong and NFLSV Central Committee Presidium Chairman
 Nguyen Huu Tho** in urging "socialist reforms, socialist construction,
 [and] socialist industrialization" throughout the country.   The same
 newspaper's editorial the next day asserted that these same steps were
 "being gradually carried out throughout the country."  The editorial of
 the 11th also detailed the various "economic segments" expected to have
 a "parallel existence" during South Vietnam's "new stage of the revolution."
 The editorial said there would be:   "the state economic segment belonging
 to the entire people, the cooperative economic segment belonging to various
 collectives, the capitalist and private economic segment, the joint
 state-private economic segment, and the small-organization economic
 segment belonging to peasants and handicraftsmen engaged in private
 business."
 Hanoi's 14 September NHAN DAN also carried editorial comment on the PRG
 statement and on the need to "make the building of socialism throughout
 the country an irreversible trend."  According to the NHAN DAN editorial,
 the comprador bourgeoisie is "the sole exploiting class remaining in the
 South," and as such it constitutes "a tremendous obstacle on the path of
 advance of the South" that is "absolutely necessary to eliminate."

 victory, at the same time hailing their return to work "shoulder
 to shoulder" with leaders in Cambodia on the couatr.y's future
 policies.
 Sihanouk statements since his arrival. in Phnom Penh have stressed
 his support for the egalitarian domestic policies set forth at
 the April 1975 special Cambodian congress conducted in his absence,*
 and have explicitly lauded the "people's democratic revolution"
 currently underway in  Cambodia.    The prince presided over a
 10 September RGNU cabinet meeting at which he reportedly voiced
 his "great satisfaction" over reports on the current military,
 economic and social policies in the country.  The meetings and
 welcoming festivities have occasioned appearances by numerous
 Cambodian leaders, but the Phnom Penh media reportage on these
 has not yet provided any clear evidence of the leadership ranking
 below the level of deputy prime minister.**
 Following a grand welcoming ceremony at Phnom Penh's Pochentong
 airport on 9 September addressed by Prince Sihanouk and RGNU
 Deputy Prime Minister Son Seu, the prince was feted at a banquet
 that evening hosted and addressed by Deputy Prime Minister Khieu
 Samphan.  On 10 September Sihanouk met with several RGNU and NUFC
 officials and later held a me.-.zing of the "entire RGNU cabinet"
 to hear and approve reports on the current domestic situation.  On
 the 12th Sihanouk was honored and spoke at a Phnom Penh rally
 which was also addressed by RGNU information and Propaganda Minister
 Hu Nim, Khieu Samphan, and representatives of the Cambodian armed
 forces, people, and women.  Also on the 12th Sihanouk viewed a military
 parade in his honor and heard an address by Son Sen on military
 affairs.  Atmospherics throughout these festivities were uniformly
 described as "warm" and "intimate."

 17 SEPTEMBER 1975
 Son Sen's 9 September welcoming speech and Khieu Samphan's speeches
 on the 9th and 12th gave balanced credit for the April. insurgent
 victory to the contributions of insurgent armed forces, on the
 one hand, and to Sihanouk and "all patriotic personalities" who
 worked in the international arena on the other.            Both leaders also
 hailed Sihanouk's return to join "the forces of great unity" to
 work "shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand" in the future.  Neither
 Sihanouk nor his hosts referred explicitly to now standard Phnom
 Penh praise for the paramount leadership role in the liberation
 struggle and postwar development of the Cambodian "revolutionary
 organization"--a presumed euphemism for the Cambodian Communist
 Party.   Concurrent Phnom Penh editorial comment, however. has
 duly referred to the organization as the ultimwte inspiration for
 the regime's policies and practices.
 Sihanouk and P'nn Nouth received due protocol prominence at all
 welcoming events, followed by Khieu Samphan and Son Sen, the latter
 newly appointed deputy prime minister for national defense affairs.
 Phnom Penh failed to give a specific protocol order to lower-level
 officials, even though it repeatedly noted that "members of the
 entire RGNU" along with the NUFC Politburo and leaders of the CPNLAF
 were present at gatherings for Sihanouk.  Hu Nim enjoyed prominence
 in moderating both the 9 September ceremony at the airport and
 the 12 September rally.  He also read the cabinet report on the
 "situation of the people and production" at the 10 September cabinet
 meeting.   Interior Minister Hou Yuon, who traditionally has ranked
 on a level with Hu Nim, has not appeared nor been referred to in
 radio broadcasts since before the April victory.  Present among
 officials meeting with Sihanouk on 10 September was Touch Kim,
 hitherto unknown and now referred to as chairman of the NUFC commit-
 tee of Phnom Penh, a position previously assigned to Chey Chum.
 Ieng Sary, recently appointed deputy prime minister for foreign
 affairs, was abroad,  touring Latin .America following attendance at
 the nonalined meeting in Lima.

 KOREA
 DPRK NATIONAL DAY COMMENT STRESSES KIM IL-SONG LEADERSHIP
 M
 ~-IPQig1i-0
 The DPRK marked its 27th anniversary or. 9 September with the tradi-
 tional Pyongyang meeting, banquet, and NODONG SINMUN editorial.
 Neither the 9 September editorial nor speeches by Vice President
 Kim Tong-kyu at the 8 September meeting and by Premier Kim I1 at
 the banquet the following day broke any new substantive ground.
 Unlike past years, however, Kim Tong-kyu's speech and the NODONG
 SINMUN editorial noted the need to follow Kim Il-song's leadership
 from "generation to generation," a theme discussed at length in
 the September 1974 issue of the party journal KULLOJA but not
 raised in other 1974 anniversary pronouncements.  Missing from
 current anniversary comment was last year's heightened concern with
 'domestic economic and political tasks and the emphasis then placed
 on support for the "party center."
 Kim Tong-kyu reiterated standard Pyongyang support for the "struggle"
 of the South Korean people.  Kim noted--as did the speaker at the
 1974 anniversary meeting--that the struggle was experiencing
 "meandering," but he predicted that "in the not too distant future"
 the South Korean people would "overthrow the colonial fascist rule"
 of the United States and the government of South Korean President
 Pak Chong-hui.  Kim called on South Korean "revolutionaries" to
 combine "various forms and methods of struggle" to establish a "true
 popular government" in the South.*
 In line with standard DPRK propaganda, Kim accused the United States
 and the ROK of i.creasing tension in Korea and demanded that U.S.
 troops withdraw immediately from the South.  Kim refrained from
 harsh criticism of the Japanese role in Korea, calling on the
 "Japanese authorities" to avoid hampering Korea's reunification at
 the least, if they could not aid it.  He stated that Japan should
 immediately renounce its "hostile policy" toward the DPRK, and
 cautioned that "we will always maintain a close watch on the move-
 ments of th- Japanese authorities."
 PEKING      Peking's treatment of this year's DPRK anniversary was
 very similar to that in 1974, though it gave marginally
 less attention to the United State's role in Korea.  As last year,
 Li Hsien-nien led the PRC delegation to the DPRK ambassador's
 *  A representative of the Revolutionary Party for Reunification--a
 Marxist-Leninist party allegedly operating in South Korea--was listed
 as attending both the meeting and the banquet for the first time.
 Details are discussed in the TRENDS of 10 September, page 20.

 anniversary reception.  While last year. NCNA had reported brief
 remarks by the PRC foreign minister about the DPRK's success in
 the "struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and interference,"
 this year the 9 September NCNA report on the reception merely
 noted toasts to Chinese-Korean solidarity.  The Chinese leaders'
 greeting message to DPRK leaders--monitored this year, as last,
 only on ?eking radio's Korean-language service--returned to the
 language of the 1973 message, dropping last year's stated support
 for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.  Peking's
 message this year also dropped the 1974 reference to the North's
 "reasonable propositions" for reunification, noting instead that
 by upholding its "just stand" for reunification, the North had
 successfully opposed the "two Koreas scheme of L';S. imperialism
 and the Pak Chong-hui clique."
 The traditional PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the anniversary demanded
 that the "so-called UN Forces Command must be dissolved and U.S.
 troops must withdraw from South Korea totally."  Last yeai.'s
 anniversary editorial had been somewhat harsher, calling for with-
 drawal of U.S. "aggressor" troops.  Also omitted this time was
 last year's demand that the United States cease "interfering in
 the internal affairs of Korea."  Instead, this year's editorial
 charged that the Pak Chong-hui "puppet clique" had aggravated tension
 in Korea, trampled on the North-South joint statement, and engaged
 in fascist suppression "under the support and connivance of U.S.
 imperialism."  PEOPLE'S DAILY also noted Chinese sponsorship of
 a draft resolution on the Korean question in the United Nations,
 congratulated the DPRK for being admitted to the nonalined grc?ip,
 and closed with strong expressions of DPRK-PRC solidarity.
 MOSCOW      Soviet treatment of the DPRK anniversary indicated no
 thaw in the frosty state of Soviet-DPRK relations.
 Although the rank of Soviet represento_ives at the DPRK charges's
 Moscow reception and the Soviet-sponsored anniversary meeting in
 Moscow was slightly higher than last year, these functions were
 again reported only briefly in Soviet media.   The Soviet leaders'
 message of greetings was fully reported, but it offered only
 perfunctory support for Korean reunification and made no reference
 either to Northern proposals for reunification or to presence of
 foreign troops in Korea.  The Soviet message noted that by pro-
 clamation of the DPRK in 1948, the Korean people had exercised the
 right to independent development "within the framework of their
 own state,"  a phrase which has not appeared in previous Soviet
 messages on the anniversary.  Pyongyang apparently took umbrage
 at this phrase, possibly interpreting it as a hint at the existence
 of two Korean states, and dropped it from its own KCNA English-
 language and Pyongyang radio Korean-language versions of the message.

 17 SEPTEMBER 1975
 Soviet media comment on the anniversary included at least two
 radio commentaries, a 6 September IZVESTIYA item devoted mainly
 to detailing agricultural developments in the DPRK, and a brief
 7 September RED STAR article.  RED STAR noted Soviet insistence
 on the "unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops" from South
 Korea, as well as Soviet support for the DPRK's "constructive
 proposals" aimed at liquidating tension and fostering Korean
 reunification.  The article also noted DPRK support for a UN
 draft resolution on the Korean question, but failed to mention
 Soviet sponsorship of the resolution.  Both RED STAR and a
 9 September Moscow radio commentary cited an old Kim Il-song
 quotation paying homage to the decisive role-of the Soviet Union
 in Korea's liberation and thus the existence of the DPRK.  As
 usual, Soviet comment also called attention to Soviet economic
 aid to the DPRK.  The 9 September radio commentary tried to
 link Korean reunification with a pro-Soviet policy, claiming that
 the achievement of Korean reunification could become part  of
 practical action on the proposal for collective security in Asia,"
 a Soviet-sponsored proposal.

 CHINA
 TOP PRC I.EADERS ATTEND AGRICULTURAL CONFERENCE IN SHANSI
 NCNA on 15 September announced the opening that da+y in Shansi Province
 of a "national conference" on learning from Tachaiin agriculture,
 convened by the PRC Statn Council with "the cordial attention of
 Chairman Mao and the party Central Committee."  The conference,
 apparently designed to discuss and disseminate agricultural policies
 for China's next five-year plan period starting in January, marks
 the largest publicized gathering of CCP Politburo members outside
 Peking since the cultural revolution.  The opening meeting was
 addressed by Vice Chairman Teng Hsiao-ping, Chiang Ching,  and long-time
 Tachai leader Chen Yung-kuei.  Vice Premier Hua Kuo-feng, who had just
 returned to Peking from Tibet on 13 September, announced the opening
 of the congress,  Other Politburo members and alternates at the
 conference were Yao Wen-yuan, Chen Hsi-lien, and Wu Ku9i-hsien.  Four
 ministers of the State Council., it :eluding the minister of culture,
 also were listed in attendance.
 Thus far NCNA has released no details of Chiang Ching's "important speech"
 and has only noted that Teng conveyed central greetings in his "important
 speech" and that he was greeted by "outbursts of stormy applause."
 The available NCNA summary of Chen's speech highlighted the dual
 goals of achieving "farm mechanization in the main by 1980" and of
 further expanding the number of Tachai-type counties.   Chen noted
 the need to implement various concrete measures, including soil
 improvement, water control and industrial support for agriculture,  and
 he also stressed the necessity of ideological unity.  He credited the
 anti-Lin Piao and Confucius movement, and "par~i.cularly" the movement
 to study the dictatorship of the proletariat (but not the current
 "Water Margin" campaign), as factors in spreading the Tachai experience.
 Chen's reference to the dictatorship campaign, which at its outset this
 year seemed to involve controversy over the extent to which "bourgeois
 rights" would be allowed in production, payment and marketing, serves
 as a reminder that the "Tachai experience" deals not only with
 production but also with ideological line.
 The presence at the meeting of Chiang Ching, Yao Wen-yuan,  and the
 minister of culture, none of whom have any known agricultural duties,
 clearly indicates that the meeting will serve to popularize Tachai's
 ideological achievements as well as its production reccrds.
 NCNA's account of the session indicated that the meeting would not
 formulate any basic policies, but that rather participants would
 exchange experiences and popularize the conference line.   The meeting

 was attended by 3,700 delegates, and it seem:; doubtful that the
 attending Politburo members would present anything but a united
 front before such a gathering.  The show of leadership unity in the
 context of a discussion of rational economic measures may serve to
 quiet peasant fears of a sudden change in agricultural policies.*
 The meeting also serves to put a mass imprint on the five-year
 plan's agricultural . goals.   Chen stated that a "number of important
 measures regarding production" would be discussed at the conference,
 and within central guidelines the conference may have some discretion
 on specific measures.  The last five-year plan for agriculture seems
 to have been discussed also at a similar conference in 1970, which was
 not publicized until later.
 The holding of a national conference on agriculture appears to
 represent a renewed effort by Peking to speed general economic
 development by focusing on the key role played by agriculture.  NCNA
 on 16 September, for example, lauded Kwangsi for achieving "rapid
 growth in agriculture and in its light and heavy industry."  Endorsing
 the line that "it is agriculture that decides the scale and speed of
 industrial development," NCNA argued that "only a developed agriculture
 can supply industry with the food, manpower and raw materials it
 reqLlres, as well as with an expanding market for its products and
 funds for further growth."  NCNA praised local Kwangsi party units
 for learning from Tachai and for giving first place to "agriculture
 and steadily expanding light and heavy industry on the basis of
 agricultural development."  As a result of following the Tachai
 example, "Kwangsi not only meets its own needs in grain but also
 provides large amounts to the state."
 The conference report's emphasis on agricultural mechanization and
 Chen's stated goal of basically achieving such mechanization by 1980
 reflect Mao's longstanding concern with the problem.  Agricultural
 mechanization was a major issue in the dispute with Liu Shao-chi.
 This emphasis on agriculture and agricultural equipment indicates that
 for the next five years at least PRC economic priorities will remain in
 the order of agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry.  The
 significant increase in priority apparently accorded agricultural
 equipment also implies resource constraints in other sectors, possibly
 including the military.
 *  The image of a united leadership was also strengthened by NCNA's
 identification of Wang Chien as Shansi first party secretary, up from
 secretary, replacing Hsien Chen-hua, who has long been in political
 trouble.

 SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF CHILEAN COUP:  Soviet media gave pro r-)rma
 attention to the second anniversary of Lhe 11. September 1973 coup
 In Chile which toppled Marxist president Salvadore Allende, in
 marked contrast to the treatment of the first anniversary.  Last
 year, up to 12 percent of Moscow radio comment was devoted to
 Chile from 9 to 22 September--a period which coincided with
 President Ford's press conference  statements  on U.S. involvement
 in Chile prior to the coup.  This year only 3 percent of Moscow's
 comment for 8-14 September dealt with Chile.  This year's comment,
 beamed primarily to Latin tmerica, featured letters, statements
 and other expressions of support for the Chileans from a variety
 of sources in connection with a "week of international solidarity"
 with the Chilean people.   TASS reported on "big meetings of
 solidarity" said to have been held 1-i "various" Soviet cities and
 PRAVD., marked the oc,  sion with an L rticle or. the 12th by Vladimir
