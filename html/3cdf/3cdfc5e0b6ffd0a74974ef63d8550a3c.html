We sometimes get copies of memos 
sent from wire service reporters to their 
basses. They often contain interesting lit-
tle tidbits not significant enough to the 
world to be included in stories. 
For example, one of the first American 
reporters into Red China during the 
"ping pong diplomacy" stage mentioned 
that he was finding his way around (and 
learning facts about the country) from a 
CIA atlas. 
We knew the CIA was into a lot of 
things (purely military operations, assas-
sinations, etc.) but: we never dreamed 
that the successor to the puristic OSS 
was competing with Rand McNally.. . 
So just on the off-chance we sent a 
note to the superintendent of documents 
in Washington asking for a copy and a 
bill, just as though we had a right to se-
cret documents. 
? Then we forgot about it. 
It arrived this week, price $5.25. 
As is apparent in the photo of the 
cover, there's Central Intelligence Agen-
cy imprinted as big as can be, and no 
-secret or top secret stamp. 
It was compiled and published well 
prior to the first American visit, and 
bears a November, 1971, printer's date. 
There's no reason it should be stamped 
as secret, but its obvious that it repre-
sents a workmanlike job in a library 
well-stocked with publicatons from inside 
then-closed China. 
There's everything in it you've always 
wanted to know about Red China but 
didn't know how to ask. It doubtless is 
the best thing out, and it's worth the 
$5.25 several times over. Its maps, art-
work,. photos and text are magnificently 
done. Chapters go into forms of govern-
ment by various levels, languages, dia-
lects and subdialects? climate, metals, 
industries and the people themselves. 
There's even a tourist's guide to Peking. 
The last item is the only part that 
gave us a start. The Peking guide is a 
huge double-spread painting of the scenic 
city. It apparently is drawn to scale and 
looks much like an aerial photo. On it are 
81 numbered circles ? just like a Stra-
tegic Air CAppinivecEFarRellease12001/03/04 : CIA-RDP80-01601R000200340001-5 
closer look' we see that all 81 numbers 
refer to palaces, .ancient temples, .gar-
China atlas? 
denS, sacred gates and other points of 
historic and sight-seeing interest, unless 
someone considers the Soviet embassy to 
be a target. You find out from reading 
the skinny print hidden in the corner that 
the painting itself is taken from a 1957 
publication of Peking Publishing HoUse, 
Inc., or whatever the Chinese version of 
Inc. is. 
We have three points to make: 
(1) It's an excellent publication. 
(2) The CIA shouldn't be in the pub-
lishing business, using taxpayer's' money 
to put out fancy books (that obviously 
cost more than $5.25 to make). 
(3) The CIA, much to our surprise, 
has the soul of a poet ? or at least one 
CIA man, the editor of the atlas, has. 
Between the terse preface and the 
introduction is something in the nature of 
a dedication. It's a Chinese poem, written 
by r latter-day Communist about the 
"c 
goals of a commune. It urges hustle in ""L"- 
harnessing the land and its wealth, and 
ends wilh: 
a 
An inch of lime is an inch of gold, 
That's the value of yesterday. 
Time's word] today 
Is an inch for ten thousand pieces of 
gold. 
Can it be that the anonymous editor is 
spy-poet who came in from the 
cold?

By U. lANI 
MOSCOW 
Imperialist circles are using 
any and every expression of anti-
Sovietism in strngle against 
socialism. The anti-Soviet policy 
of Peking directly serves the 
needs of imprialisin: and reac-
tionary Western propaganda is 
using it to divert the attention 
of the peoples from the contra-
dictions rending capitalism, to 
justify imperialist ag4ression and 
to slander the peaceful policy of 
the Soviet Union and the other 
countries of the socialist com-
munity. 
In the United States the Pen-
tagon-reared news analyst Joseph 
Alsop especially feeds on fabri-
cations about Soviet-Chinese re-
lations. A few days -ago he pub-
lished in the inetropolitan news-
paper Washington Post a loud. 
article under the heading "Polit-
ical Hallucinations.- Whose and 
what hallucinations? It turns out 
that nearly all except the author 
have them, and they consist in 
that honest and decent world pub-
lic opinion is indignant at U.S. 
.aggression in Indochina and the 
U.S.-protected expansionist policy 
of Israel in the Middle East: 
whereas. says Alsop. the main 
feature of the world landscape 
is not at all the war in Vietnam 
and not even the dangerous situ-
ation in the Middle East. ? 
No. in the Alsop ''landscape' 
the main feature is a Soviet "red 
threat- to China. In the CIA and 
the Pentagon there are very sen-
sible inen who have explained 
everything to him and asked him 
to give an account in public. And 
this old hand at provocative 
things tried his best to calumni-
ate the Soviet Union, accusing it 
of nothing less than preparing a 
"preventive attack- on the Peo-
ple's Republic of China. 
The hallucination prompted by 
the "sensible inert- so much

of Alsop. the hater of socialism.

agined picture as a reality, in 
%.1 I Fl I 1 1 `I I I-
front of which he and his friends 
sat as the "third rejoicing... lie 
even yelped v:ith rapture. 
This patholcyical article of .\l-
sops is not unique. Back in Feb-
ruary this year he tried to fright-
en the woi.ld with his extravagant 
fancy of t he "cast ration of 
China.- Finally. two days after 
the above-mentioned article, in 
the same Washin;r,tun Post, Al-
sop made the crazy allegation 
that Pravda was advocating a 
"reduction ol Soviet support- for-
the heroic Vietnamese patriots. 
This goes beyond all measures 
of falsehood. 
But then, apart from Alsop, 
not so rudely and less noisily. 
other U.S. journalists and news-
papers almost simultaneously 
spoke out on the Soviet ''threat'' 
to China, also. apparently. on the 
advice of "sensible men" of im-
perialist reaction. 
As we see, there is a certain 
strategy at the bottom of all this. 
It consists. first of all, in an 
attempt to discredit the actual 
policy of the Soviet Union vis-a-
vis the People's Republic of 
China. This policy rests on a de-
sire to normalize relations, to 
restore good-neighborliness and 
friendship between the Soviet. and 
Chinese peoples. The reactionary 
imperialist forces are well aware 
of the fact that the improvement 
of relations between the U.S.S.R. 
and the PRC would accord with 
the vital, long-term interests of 
the two count ries, the interests 
'of world socialism, the interests 
of struggle against imperialism. 
The Soviet Union has placed be-
fore the PRC concrete and con-
structive proposals on non-aggres-
sion, non-use of force, settlement 
of border questions, improvement 
of relations on the basis of mu-
tual advantage. 
These proposals have not been 
accepted by China as yet. The 
Peking leaders think it ,unprofit-
able for themselves to speak the 
truth about these proposals of tile 
Soviet Union--that would be their 
self-exposure as great-power ex-
pansionisls ;nut splitters ing..!ra-
vating international tensioas and 
relations between the U.S.S.R. 
and the Alsop and his col-
leagues are also aware of all 
this. but deliberately pass it over 
in order to warp the real state 
of affairs. 
The anti-Communists and anti-
Soviet propagandists. in pablish-
ing their inventions ibout th,., So-
viet "threat.- do not abai:cion 
their attempts to discredit Soviet 
foreign policy as a whole. They 
are out to question the U.S.S.R.'s 
consistency in the struggle for 
stronger world peace. to present 
the Soviet proposals on European 
security, collective security in 
Asia. bilateral declarations on 
the non-use of . force and other 
measures to ease internatienal 
tension and to achieve disarma-
ment. put forward by the Soviet 
Union, as allegedly prompted 
only by: tactical considerations. 
There is nothing new in these 
methods, Imperialist propaganda 
has long been resorting to slan-
der concerning a "red menace" 
in its unsuccessful struggle against 
socialism: 
What has been new here in re-
cent years lies elsewhere. It con-
sists in :that the Peking leader-
ship willingly echoes slanderous 
concoctions of all kinds concern-
ing Soviet foreign policy. Peking 
brazenly -draws on and spreads 
in from filthy sources 
of imperialist propaganda, adding 
to it its own inventions tbotit. the 
Soviet Union and other countries 
of the socialist community. 
Therein lies the nutritive mc-
di urn for the hallucinations of 
Joseph Alsop and the "sensible 
men- froin the CIA and the Pen-
tagon, who are backing him. That 
is the v.?ay the Peking "propagan-
dists.' and the poisoners of pub-
lic opinion, who are filling the 
orders from the aggressive im-
perialist circles, are assiduous-
ly assisting each other.

L The Washington Nierry.Go-Ronnd STATINTL 
0S0, Notes 
By Jack Anderson 
: There is evidence in the se-
cret U.S. cable traffic that 
President Nixon's Military 
moves .in Vietnam may be 
driving the two great Commu-
nist antagonists, Russia and 
China, bacietogether. ? 
We.have been able to trace 
the dismaying developments 
through secret documents,. 
which the White House has 
carefully withheld from both 
Congress and the public. 
These. documents show that 
the.. Kremlin reacted to the 
Chinese-American rapproche-
ment by making its own secret 
overtures to Peking 'last Au-
gust. The Soviets worked 
through Lin Piao, the acerbic 
defense minister, who has 
been designated by Mao Tse-
tung to become his successor. 
Encouraged by his Soviet 
contacts, Lin opposed inviting 
President Nixon to Peking and 
advocated restoring the 
Chinese-Russian. p artnerihip-
This put .Lin ire direct conflict 
with Premier Chou En-lai, 
who had issued the invitation 
to Nixon. 
Lin lost the showdown and 
mysteriously disappeared. The 
crafty Chou spread the word 
to the party faithful that Lin 
had died in a plane crash after 
attempting to assassinate Mao. 
Chou's version, which was 
whispered around China and 
reached CIA ears, had it that 
Lin attempted to waylay Mao 
on the way home from South 
China by train last August. 
%????=1MINIMINN, JIISMINarwl 
? Knowing Mao's itinerary 
would take him through 
Shanghai and Wuhsi, Lin al-
legedly arranged an assassina-
tion party in Shanghai?and aft-
erward planned to blOw tip a 
bridge in Wuhsi to wreck 
Mao',s train. Both plots failed, 
according to the story, and 
Lin attempted to flee to Rus-
sia by jet on Sept.-13. The 
plane supposedly crashed in 
the Wenteukhan area of Mon-
golia. 
The whispers of the plot to 
kill Mao, who has deity status 
in China, apparently was in-
tended to cow Lin Piao's sup-
porters. So monstrous was the 
thought of assassinating, the 
great Mao, in Chinese minds, 
that the Lin faction was sup-
posed to be intimidated into 
silence. 
But the opposition to Chou 
continued to simmer under 
the surface, and the Russians 
quietly pressed for better rela-
tions. The plenum of the &v. 
viet Central Committee, in an 
unpublished action last No-
vember, sought to restrain the 
ideological struggle against 
the Chinese. 
Still, other events inflamed 
Chinese-Russian relations 
until the State Department re-
ported in a confidential sum-
mary last December: "Sino-So-
viet international polemics as 
distinct from domestic propa-
ganda have risen to the 
highest level since 1969 
. . . Peking, however, has 
so far avoided whipping up 
a war scare within China, 
and it appears to be attempt-
ing to restrict increased ten-
sion. with Moscow to verbal 
fireworks on international 
questions." 
Significantly, Chou is in 
charge of China's interna-
tional affairs and,. therefore, 
was responsible for the rising 
rhetciric. President Nixon's air 
attacks upon North Vietnam, 
however, have made it awk-
ward for Chou. . 
China and Russia have been 
competing for Hanoi's favor, 
as the two titans of commu-
nism maneuver for influence 
in Southeast Asia. 
Rivalry in Hanoi 
The Central Intelligence 
Agency, in a secret report, has 
declared: "Following Dr. 
Henry Kissinger's July. visit to 
Peking, Chinese Premier Chou 
En-lai made a Secret visit to 
Hanoi to reassure the Govern-
ment of the Democratic Re-
public of Vietnam, (DRV) of 
continued Chinese support. 
"The Chinese emphasized 
their support by increasing 
their assistance to the DRV_ 
for the 1971-72 period. This in 
turn resulted in an increase ity 
Soviet assistance to the DRV 
for the same period. ... 
"The DRV expressed its ap-
prehension to Chou regarding 
a ' U.S.-Chinese detente, and 
stated that the DRV is still 
suspicious about President'. 
Nixon's visit to Peking." 
In view of the Chinese-Rus-
sian rivalry in Hanoi, Nixon 
undermined Chou and justi-
gna 
lied Lin's poSition by .orclers 
air strikes against North Viet-
nam, Thi i has strengthened 
Lin's - survivors inside the 
Chinese policy councils. 
As a result, Lin's idea of re-
pairing Chinese-Russian rela-
tions is gaining support. At 
the United Nations, for exam-
ple, the relations between 
Chinese and Russian delegates 
are warming. . . 
A Soviet delegation, on: tour

The Washington Merry-Goatound 
jIy Jack Anderson 
Secret intelligence reports 
declare that President Nixon's 
high-risk military moves in 
Vietnam have undermined 
those in both Moscow and Pe-
king who want to ease ten-
sions with the United States. 
Although there had been no 
visible opposition to the Presi-
dent's trip to Peking and invi-
tation to visit Moscow, the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
claims the detente was fierce-
ly resisted inside the policy 
councils of both governments. 
To protect our sources, we 
cannot quete directly from the 
CIA documents. The CIA 
maintains, however, that the 
decision to invite Nixon was 
by no 'means unanimous in 
'Moscow or Peking. 
Citing "reliable" sources, 
the CIA claim's the Soviet mil-
itary hierarchy has opposed 
doing business with Nixon. De-
fense Minister Andrei 
Grechko, apparently, has be-
come the principal spokesman 
for this faction inside the 
Kremlin. 
The Russian marshals, .ac-
cording to the CIA, are eager 
to share credit in Hanoi for 
the North Vietnamese sue-
t fiFr Nixo 
cesses. For the military equip-
ment, which has smashed the 
South Vietnamese defenses, 
was made in Russia. 
The Soviets, in the bidding 
against the Chinese for influ-
ence in Hanoi, had offered the 
North Vietnamese a $110 mil-
lion military loan. Gen. Vo 
Nguyen Giap, the North Viet-
cided to spend it for tanks, 
heavy artillery and anti-air-
names? military genius, deci-
craft missiles. 
The Soviet military brass 
would like to see a setback for 
U.S. interests not only in Viet-
nam but the Middle East. The 
CIA warns that the Russians 
may counter U.S. moves in 
Vietnam with new initiatives 
in the Mediterranean. 
The CIA offers fewer specif-
ics about the opposition within 
the Chinese leadership to the 
Chinese-American detente. 
But bitter opposition, says the 
CIA, is simmering beneath the 
surface. 
Laird's Good Humor 
Our recent columns on the 
misuse of the Pentagon .auto 
fleet has drawn a good-humor-
ed reaction from Defense 
Secretary Mel Laird and or-
ders from on high to start 
obeying the regulations. 
Slightly 1 
But the Pentagon bigshots, 
as usual, are reading the regu-
lations to suit their expensive 
tastes, not to save the taxpay-
ers' money. Result: most of 
the staggering waste contin-
ues. ? 
We told, for example, how 
gon cars, intended for use 
only on pressing official busi-
ness, had become a luxury lim-
ousine service for military po-
tentates and their congres-
sional friends. 
Laird, meanwhile, still has 
two limousines at his constant 
call in case one should de-
velop motor trouble. His spe-
alai assistant, Carl Wabace, is 
also picked up each morning 
and delivefed hoine each eve-
ning by a military chauffeur. 
The men who toil in the 
Pentagon garage, however, 
were getting the word to put 
an end to excursions that vio-

ably, riseant stopping the prac-
tice of routinely chauffeuring 
members of Congress around 
Washington. 
But when the motor 'pool 
tried to follow orders, it found 
itself in hot water with She 
Pentagon's congressional liai-
son office which is resisansi 
popularity rating high on 
Capitol Hill, 
The clash between military 
regulations and congressional 
relations was quickly resolved 
in favor of keeping the Con-
gressmen happy. The soldiers 
who man the motor pool were 
ordered to provide whatever 
the congressional liaison of-
fice wanted. -

supplier so there will be 
plenty to serve to thirsty Con-

military flight. 
. 
The fact that such trips in-

transportation of liquor across 
the Vieginia border from 
Washington doesn't bother the

The Voice of 
? Toe Alsop Power 
Glory 
By Tom Kelly 
it Joe Alsop's pleasant garden room 
I four plump caged doves are cooing. 
Joe says when asked that he does 
not like doves?that out of their cages 
, they are dirty, mean, and hard to man-
age. 
Joe sits under the skylight sipping a 
tisane from a huge blue and white china 
cup and the doves in two large, elaborate 
cages pay him no mind. 
They're in and Joe's Out but nobody's 
free. 
Joe i a blue blooded falcon, a rare 
and endangered species. He is a falcon 
by inheritance, .a member of the estab-
lishment, a natural born leader, a cousin 
? of leaders, a classmate of leaders, a for-
mer roommate of leaders, and the chosen 
voice of the pedigreed "first-rate men" 
for thirty years. 
For generations we've all been run by 
the East Coast cousins. The first cousins 
went to Groton and the second cousins 
to St, Paul's. The Irish Catholic fifth 
cousins were named Kennedy?but that ? 
was later. First they were coachmen and 
named Pat and Mike. They went to 
Choate. 
It is difficult to tell the cousins without 
an alumni bulletin. Cousins are not mea-
sured by blood alone, but establishment 
cousins do tend to marry establishment 
cousins and produce geneological cousins. 
There are several (de facto) Jewish 
cousins named Lehmann, Ochs, and Mor-
genthau, but there are no Italian or 
Polish or Bulgarian cousins. Black people 
.are not ready to be cousins though some 
can be classmates. It is customary to 
speak well of the late Frederick Doug-
lass. 
Some cousins chuckle a lot and Joe's 
blood cousin Teddy Roosevelt grinned 
and shouted "Bully" but most were 
serious faced and did not laugh out loud. 
This was partly because many were from 
New England but also because they 
were born to assume the awful responsi-
bility .of running the world. , 
? 
Running the world' is not easy. Joe 
took up the burden in 1932. He was a 
strange youth?fat, an honor graduate 
of Groton and Harvard, son of a roar-
ing Connecticut reactionary father and 
a mother who was as well connected 
as the Connecticut Light & Power Co. - 
He was cousined to everyone important 
south of Portland and north of Phila-
delphia. He was literally a cousin to all t 
the Roosevelts?Teddy, Franklin, Elea-
nor, and Alice Blue Gown. 
When Joe was ready for the profes-
sional world his grandmother (a cousin 
of God's) decided that he was not to be 
a businessman, diplomat, banker, Episco-
pal bishop, or president of Harvard. It 
was suggested that he get a job on a 
newspaper, a startling idea. Cousins and 
classmates owned newspapers, of course, 
but they didn't work on them. Joe had 
a few precedents. Alexander Woollcott, 
who if not a cousin was at least invited 
to cousins' homes, was cutting a choleric 
swath through New York culture, and 
Bob Benchley, a blithe spirit but a Har-
vard boy, was working for magazines. 
Ogden Reid hired Joe at Joe's grand-
mother's suggestion and sent him to re-
port to the Herald Tribune's city editor, 
a disenchanted man. named. Stanley 
Walker. City editors are all low-born. 
Stanley had difficulty believing his own 
? eyes since Joe, though only twenty-two, 
was 245 pounds, dressed in well-cut vest 
and watch chain, and possessed of an 
extraordinarily arch accent that sug-
gested simultaneously the Queen Mother, 
Cardinal Newman, and the fatigue of a 
gentleman who'd just swum the English 
Channel backwards. 
He also couldn't type. 
Still, no one is perfect. Joe was broadly 
read and he could write a clear, ominous 
sentence. Alex Woollcott decided that 
Joe was the only educated youth he'd 
met since his own college days. Alex was 
given to extraordinary judgments?he 
was against sex and he believed Louisa 
May Alcott was a great writer. 
Joe was soon a featured byline writer 
at the Herald Tribune and in less. time \ 
than it takes to add up the Vietnam elec-
tion. returns he was the co-proprietor

THE TAU OF THE TOWN 
!Studies 
,ON it recent Tuesday evening, we 
spent an hour in the Grand Ball-
room of the Waldorf-Astoria listening 
to graduate students, lecturers, pro-
fessors, and an assortment of scholars 
. and specialists unwind from a day's 
work. It was the end of the second , 
day of the twenty-fourth 'annual meet-
ing of the Association for Asian Stud- , 
ies?with headquarters in Ann Ar-. 
bor?and more than half of the two 
thousand conferees- were relaxing at a 
reception after spending the day in such 
seminars as "The Emperor's New 
Clothes: Symposium on Interpreting 
the Meiji Restoration," "Continuity 
and Change in Princely India," "Lu 
listin: The Man, the Artist, and His 
Ambiguities," "Judicial Conscience in 
Modern Japan," "Wang Yang-Ming 
(1472-1529): In Commemoration of 
the 500th Anniversary of His Birth," 
. . 
and "Yogaciira Buddhism." . 
When we got there, at about five-
thirty, the ballroom was teeming with 
white Americans (who were easily in 
the majority), a handful of black 
Americans, and a liberal sprinkling of 
Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, Japanese, 
Indians, Burmese, and other Asians. 
At the center of the large stage that is 
a fixture of the ballroom was an elfin 
young Japanese lady?Fusako Yoshida, 
. we learned?plucking 
classical Japanese music 
from a long stringed in-
strument, whose ends 
were resting on wooden 
horses covered; with red 
cloth. There was nothing 
on the stage but Miss Yo-
shida and her instrument. 
She had on a sea-green 
kimono with a broad gold-
colored obi; her hair was piled high in 
what looked like a spiral of buns; and 
her feet were shod. in a pair of wooden 
clogs. Miss Yoshida was treated as a 
pleasant background to the evening, 
her music competing with the babble 
of .chatter, though in her demureness, 
the delicacy of the sonnds she brought 
from the instrument, and the economy 
of her physical stature she .quite domi-
nated the stage. . . ? 
So as ilk to look to_so, puch,4 stran-
ger in afnPIRTCP(19uEFsgcnNaigaS 
pherc, we went over to a bar, bought a 
bourbon-and-water, and, glass in hand, 
walked around, either listening to what 
people were saying or talking to them 
ourself. The first man we went up to 
was a short, middle-aged American 
who was sitting at a table in the vicinity 
)f the stage, seemingly engrossed in 
the music. He was a Bostonian, he told 
us, who had studied at the University 
of Wisconsin and was now .a professor 
in East-West relations at Cheyney 
State College, in Pennsylvania. 
"What instrument is that?" we 
asked. 
"A koto," he replied. "It belongs 
to a large family of traditional Jap-
anese stringed instruments, one of 
Which is the samisen?considerably 
smaller." 
"Good music," we observed. 
"Exquisite," he replied. "You know, 
I adore Orientals, feel very much at 
home in their company, and am just 
as fond of their culture. I even took up 
karate. Not to use it, mind you?or, at 
least, I hope I'll never have to?but to 
keep in touch with the Oriental spirit 
and sensibility." . ? 
We told the professor that the meet-
ing seemed remarkably well attended 
and asked him what had brought so 
many people out. 
"All sorts of things," he said. 
"There are some people here looking 
for jobs; some looking to change jobs, 
some looking for intellectual rejuvena-
tion, some just looking for old friends, 
and some, like me, hoping to meet 
scholars whose work we've

find people from the federal 
government here. Take the 
C.I.A.?they have an inter- V 
est in what goes on here." 
"Scholarly?" we asked. 
"Sure, scholarly?why 
not? Some of my best friends 
are in the C.I.A." 
At this point, seeking to 
broaden our acquaintance, 
we turned to a man standing 
nearby, who may or may not 
have overheard the conver-
sation. We hadn't broad-
ened things very much, it 
turned out, for there on the 
man's lapel badge along with his

a 
he was wearing a black suit' and a 
narrow, red-and-gray striped tie, and 
under tortoiseshell glasses was the 
gentlest pair of eyes we had seen that 
day. We asked him what he did for 
the C.I.A., and he said he was a 
China-studies specialist, doing research 
and analysis in the Agency's geography 
department. He had been there since 
the end of the Second World War, 
after he came back from New Guinea, 
the Philippines, and Japan, .where he 
had served in the armed forces. 
"What is the C.I.A.'s interest in this 
meeting?" we asked. 
"This is where you find the best 
minds in Asian studies," he replied. 
"They are my brethren. From time to 
time, We have to get in touch with 
them to find out what the new fron-
tiers in research are. In our business, 
accuracy is the name of the game. We 
can't afford not to keep up with what's 
going on." 
We said "Fair enough," thanked 
him, and moved on. 
Sauntering in the direction of Miss 
Yoshida, who, we had noticed, was 
taking a breather at a table near the 
stage, we passed two happy-go-lucky-
looking young men in cfumpled sports 
jackets, battered old suede boots, and 
collars open at. the neck?a uniform 
identifying them as graduate students. 
"Why are all the attractive girls in 
South Asian studies?" one of the young 
men said. The other laughed before he 
answered, and we didn't wait to bear 
what he said. 
Next, 
we 
overheard 
a fragment of 
another conversation, among a nearby 
foursome consisting of a Japanese, 
an Indian, and two white Americans. 
One of the Americans was saying, 
"Did you See all those professors run-
ning around with their bright graduate 
students in tow? I hear the job pick-
-.ings are slim this year. In 
fact, they seem to be getting 
slimmer every year. A few 
years ago, there was a great

ourself.- She seemed to be in 
her early-thirties, and her 
mouth and eyes were lovely 
and expressive. She told us 
she was not in Asian Studies but was 
appearing at the reception under the 
auspices of the Japan Society. We 
asked what she had been playing, and 
she said, "A number of modern and 
traditional Japanese pieces." She hand-
us the program of .a recital she had

:from Chiang Mai, Thailand, where, 
he said, he had done community-de-
veropment work for more than twenty 
years. We asked him what had brought 
him back to the States after a lifetime 
in the East. 
"Success," he said. "I worked my-
self out of a job." ? 
"Is that success?" we asked. 
"For me it is," he replied. "As a

work, you are not doing very. well if

We helded for ? an exit, slowing 
down to follow a conversation be-

smiling, open-faced Chinese girl and 
a short white American with a tooth-
brush mustache and a pair of granny 
glasses. 
"I've about had it," .the man said to 
the girl. "The first-day was great, but

? "Ah," the girl said, smiling. "You

"No, I don't miss my wife," he re-

The Washington Illerry.Go-Round 
Chineseder Ab 
By Jack An4orson 
t?-? 
A confidential Senate mem-
oranda, citing a source in-
side the Central Intelligence 
Agency, reports that the Red 
hinese are "wondering" 
about American Ambassador 
Arthur Watson. 
He is the International Busi-
ness Machine's heir and big 
Republican contributor whom 
President Nixon has put in 
'charge of exploring diplomatic 
relations with the Chinese in 
Paris, We reported that ? he 
had become gloriously drunk 
on at least two trans-Atlantic 
flights. On the plane that 
brought him to Washington to 
confer with the President 
about his sensitive new assign-
ment, Watson tried to stuff 
'money down the blouses of 
:stewardesses. And on an ear-
lier flight he petulantly pelted 
,a stewardess with grapes from 
the fruit basket after she 
turned down his invitation to 
become a mistress for his 
.teen-age son. 
Such drunken conduct of-
fends the Chinese and could 
jeopardize the Chinese-Ameri-
can negotiations in Paris. For 
in the Chinese culture, anyone 
who becomes drunk in public 
would be ashamed to associate 
again with his former friends. 
The confidental memo, writ-
ten by Senate aide Torn Din 
to Senator Frank Church (D-
Idaho) declares: "From people 
who know Watson at IBM and 
those who have dealt with him 
in France, no -one says he can 
handle the important, sensi-
tive and delicate job that the 
President has now placed in 
his less than steady hands." 
Dine urges the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee to 
phone foreign policy adviser 
Henry Kissinger and urge him 
to encourage the President to 
"bring Watson home swiftly 
and send a very top, man in his 
place." 
Explains. the Senate 'aide 
"A CIA source in contact with 
the Chinese delegation at the 
United Nations and with oth-
ers who are in contact with 
the Chinese in Paris, talked 
with me about the charges 
that Jack Anderson has made 
against Ambassador Watson:. 
? 
t Elra,VOy Wa1son 
sonaily onght to do something 
Watson relieved from his posi-
viftly and effectively to have 
ion. The charges are correct; 
more important, the Chinese 
are wondering what this all 
means... 
"Several Chinese diplomats 
have approached our people in 
Henry Kissinger and rge him 
New York and in Paris want-
ing to know what Watson's be-
havior means. If Watson is not 
very smart, if he is a drunk-
ard, and if he is licentious, 
too, then are the Chinese 
being used in the negotiations 
in Paris? 
"While President Nixon was 
in China, he found negotiating 
with Chou En-lai and' others 
most grueling experience. 
Each detail is discussed and 
only the fop man discusses 
them. 
"For instance, in Paris, the 
Chinese will not deal with any-
one but the ambassador. Our 
negotiator, therefore, must be 
persistent, tough, of sound 
mind, highly respected and 
show physical endurance as 
well." 
Instead of removing Watson 
from the delicate negotiations, 
however, the Nixon adminstra-
tion has decided to cover up 
`Well?Cminected' 
"This source, whom I have 
checked out and found well-
connected and straight, be-
lives the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee or you per-
his inadequacies. CIA Director- / 
Richard Helms wrote a hasty, 
private letter to the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee 
Insisting "We can find no in-
formation in this agency" to. 
support Dine's claims. 
"In fact," added Helms, 
"there has been no report of-
any PRC (Chinese Commu-
nist) reaction to the publicity: 
on Ambassador Watson's con-..i 
duct." - 
Watson himself wrote let-
ters of apology for his "rude" 
conduct on the PanArn flight 
to Washington. Finally, Secre-
tary of State Bill Rogers, the 
nicest guy in Washington, 
used his amiable relations on 
Capitol Hill to persuade both 
the Senate and House to call 
off their investigations of Wat-. 
son. 
Footnote: Members of the 
PanAm flight crew, who were 
questioned privately on Capi-
tol Hill about the Watson inci-
dents, completely confirmed 
our charges. State Department 
aides Robert Aylmer and 
Frank Dempsey, who picked 
up Watson at the airport, also 
wrote a confidential report 
saying he was "heavily intoxi-
cated."

Our new China policy is actually the same 
old Rockefeller policy STATINTL 
BY JOHN MITCHELL HENSHAW 
HE ROLE of the Rockefellers 
If 
f 
. in shaping America's Red China 
policy rCveals an amazing story 
'of behind-the-scenes power. The gene-
sis of. Rockefeller interests in China 
dates' to around 1886. And around 
1890 the "philanthropist" John D. 
Rockefeller, Sr. gave the Chinese 300,-
000 small kerosene lamps to encourage 
them to use his oil. At the turn of the 
century, the Chinese were buying over 
100 million gallons of kerosene annual-
ly, more than 90 percent of which came 
.from Mr. Rockefeller's Standard Oil 
Co. Rockefeller had already secured a' 
monopoly. of the American oil market 
? and was embarking on a. campaign of 
world conquest of the oil market. He 
had the 'help of the U.S. Department 
of State. . 
"One of our greatest helpers," Mr. 
Rockefeller, Sr. candidly stated, "has 
? been the State Department in Washing-
pan.' Our 'ambassadors, and ministers, 
and consuls have ?aided to push our way 
into new ?markets to the utmost corners 
? of the world." The State Department-
Rockefeller partnership has continued 
to this very day. The global expansion 
of Mr. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co. 
has resulted in that company becoming 
the dominant power in the internation-
al oil cartel, which controls develop-
ment, production and prices .in the 
world oil market. 
? 
? 
Access to Markets ? 
At the behest of Mr. Rockefeller the 
State Department established t h e 
"Ch;na Open Door. Policy" warning 
European nations against compromising 
the territorial integrity of China and es-
tablished the principle 'of .free access to 
her vast markets. Principal beneficiaries 
of this policy were John D. Rockefeller's 
'Standard Oil and his brother William 
Rockefeller's fledgling banking firm 
now known as' the First National City 
Bank. 
de-
scribedPresittagrefrsaoy 
open. do& 'to ? the goods of America." 
The elder Rockefeller and his descen-
dants are primarily responsible for the 
internationalist policies of the United 
States, which impels us to constantly 
meddle into the internal affairs of other 
countries. While many other American 
firms entered into China trade field, 
none became so well ensconced as the 
two Rockefeller giant financial institu-
tions, First National City Bank and the 
Chase Manhattan Bank, and the mighty 
Standard Oil. Historians have failed to 
adequately portray the Rockefeller sce-
nario in China affairs. Perhaps the de-
ficiency is due to the largesse of the 
Rockefeller Foundation to the scholarly 
gentlemen who write the academic text-
books of history. In fact, several widely 
used textbooks of oil history have been 
written without even mentioning the 
Word "cartel." 
State Department Coverup 
There is a dearth of detailed infor-
mation about the Rockefellers' manipul-
ation of U.S. China policy due to a. de-
liberate coverup by the State Depart-
ment. Ironically, Japanese scholars are 
more conversant with the Rockefeller 
machinations in China than American 
students of economics and history. But 
it can be conclusively established that 
the Rockefellers and their entourage 
have definitely shaped and reshaped 
U.S. China policy overa long period to 
meet the exigencies of their operations. 
For the sake of brevity, we will omit a 
half - century of Rockefeller philan-
thropy, encroachment and aggrandize-
ment in China, and come down to the 
third generation of the Rockefeller clan, 
namely, the five sons of John D. Rocke-
feller, Jr. ? David, Winthrop, John .D. 
3rd, Nelson A. and Laurance S. Each of 
the five brothers are reputed to ? be 
worth over one billion dollars. Their 
grandfather, John D. Sr., was the world's 
first billionaire. Collectively, the five 
brothers control a . financial-industrial 
? 
Lions like politics, philanthropy and 
conservation, but their principal occu-
pation .is to aggressively expand theit? 
private empire. 
In .late 1949 when Mao Tse-tung 
seized control of Mainland China, John 
D. Rockefeller III declared the Cold 
War against Red China in these words: 
"On U.S. trade with China, my own 
'reaction is, that it should be limited. It 
seems to we that the fastest way to con-
tain Conznitinisnz is to discredit it in the 
eyes of the people of China. It seems to 
me if the economy worsens, 'that this 
will 'arouse opposition.to it, and as I see 
it, the opposition is essential if new 
leadership, is to develop in China, and 
I do feel that this. new leadership is tre-
mendously important." 
? Historically, this was the real begin-
ning of the Cold War and the 20-year 
embargo of Red China.. While John D. 
III modestly said he was speaking for 
himsclf,. actually he had conferred with 
his four brothers, whose own funds 
were invested in the great Rockefeller 
Trust. The Rockefellers never act im-
petuously in' making momentous deci-
sions. And in their deliberations they 
always hold protracted consultations, 
with their coterie of specialists. Usually 
the Rockefeller concensus is accurate,, 
but it is' not always infallible as was cer-
tainly proved in this instance. 
Polig ? of "Containment" 
It will be noted that John D. III 
spoke of developing "new leadership" 
in China, Which meant that the Rocke- ? 
fellers were disenchanted with their old 
friend, Chiang Kai-shek. 
.It will also be noted that John D. III 
said: "the fastest way to contain Com-
munism is to discredit it in the eyes 
of the people of China." This Rocke-
feller advice quickly became the "pol-
icy of containment" of the State Depart-
ment in the Orient. 
? 
NOTE: The aforegoing quoted 
Rockefeller advice was offered in a 
roundtable discussion in the, office of 
Secretary of State Acheson. (Minutes 
of the meeting have now been declas-

Raymond B. Fosdick, president of the

? 
President Nixon knows that his leverage on 
the Soviet Union by his Peking trip has several 
unrevealed limitations. The first is the 
U.S.S.R.'s widely reported fear of China on 
Russia's 4,150-mile border; 
Nikon. regards this as hokey, hokus, 
hokum. 
In only the 31'years, '-'77,veen 1870 and 1901, 
Great Britain acquired 4.7 million square miles 
of territory; France, 3.6 million; Germany, one 
million; Belgium, -one million ? 77 times 
Belgium's own size. Most of these were in 
Africa and Asia. But Russia had been in there 
carving up China for nearly two centuries. 
The result is today's 4,150-mile Russian-
Chinese border, the longest in the world. It runs 
something like the distance from New York to 
Honolulu. 
WHAT PRESIDENT NIXON obtained from 
Central Intelligence Agency Director Richard 
M. Helms' final briefing at the White House 
before he left is that Mao's military position on 
the Russian border is much weaker than sup-
posed. 
order -issue 
I 
War starts with terrain. The Soviet axis for 
its position opposite China is Khabarovsk, 400 
.miles north of Vladivostok. The bdtder friction 
incidents have been . concentrated i n 
Heilungkiang Province ''and along the Ussuri 
River, which is a part of the border. 
MR. HELMS told ?resident Nixon that the 
Soviet has 22 crack divisions on this border, 
' controlled from Khabarovsk. Nine are 
mechanized. The terrain, he said, is excellent 
for their deployment. We hear much about So-
viet intercontinental ballistic missiles and 
bombers. But Mr. Helms emphasized that the 
Soviet has a large and.extremely effective tac-
tical air force for troop support as well. Mao 
has none. .. ' 
What Mr. Nixon is trying to determine in the 
border issue is: Who is provoking whom? 
China can do the shouting and talking and 
street demonstrating, as. for a long ? time. But 
President Nixon believes that if anybody is 
really picking a fight in this situation the 
weight of evidence is that the one who would 
pick a fight as a precaution against the future 
is the U,S.S.R.

By John Burns 
Special to The Christian Science Monitor 
? 1972 Toronto Globe and Mail 
The writer is a resident correspondent in the Chinese capital. 
Peking 
To somebody seeing him for the first time Mr. Nixon is a sur-
prise. He seems to be taller, slimmer, and better tailored than he 
looks on television, and altogether more relaxed. 
He arrived in Peking with a healthy suntan, which reportedly he 
has been careful to cultivate since 1960. On arrival in Peking, 
and at several public functions since, he has appeared to be wear-
ing television makeup. 
A A A 
? 
-The President's arrival was an occasion of disappointment for 
several hundred Peking diplomats and 
their families who were refused permis-
sion to drive to the airport to watch the 
arrival. Some of the diplomats have 
been in Peking for years and could 
hardly believe that the Chinese would 
bar them from the most exciting event 
in all their time here, especially when 
the whole world would be able-to see the 
-arrival on television. . 
Since Chinese television carried no 
live coverage, the diplomats had to 
rely on descriptions from resident corre-
spondents who were allowed to see the 
;arrival. 
? A A A 
, It was no coincidence that Mr. Nixon 
referred to the worldwide television au-
dience? "More people are seeing and 
hearing what .we say than on any other 
such obcasion in the whole history of 
the world" his opening remarks at 
the state banquet the night he arrived. 
Throughout the visit he has seemed 
very conscious of the television cam-
eras, and the banquet speech seemed 
to have been written as much for con-
sumption by the television audience at 
home as it was for the Chinese leaders 
listening to him in the Great Hall of the 
People. Certainly its delivery was tail-
ored for TV, with Mr. Nixon running 
straight through the speech in English 
first, rather than having the Chinese in-
terpreter translate it a paragraph at 
a time. 
A A A 
According to Ronald L. Ziegler, the 
President's press secretary, the banquet 
speech was finalized only hours before it 
was delivered, with the President sitting 
down over the draft with Dr. Henry A. 
Kissinger immediately after returning 
from his epic meeting with Chairman 
Mao. ? 
Many observers here were critical of 
the speech, feeling that its mixture of 
sentimentality and heroics were ill-
suited to the situation. "A mixture of 
Gettysb r r4GivAkg.r,C.Ica MO" 
one di 
to the President's borrowing of a phrase 
from Abraham Lincoln's famed Civil 
STATI NTL 
War speech ("What we say here will not 
be long remembered") and his television 
address during the 1952 election cam-
paign when he mentioned his dog Check-
ers while defending himself against 
charges of receiving improper financial 
assistance frbm friends. ? 
Whatever the Chinese leaders may 
have thought of the speech it seemed 
to be a hit with ordinary Chinese, many 
of whom expressed pleasure at the 
President's quotation?"seize the day, 
seize the hour"?from a poem by Chair-
man Mao. "It's a good thing he should 
do that," said one educated Chinese. 
"The Chtlirman has written many great 
things, and everybody can learn from 
him." 
It was noticeable that the quotation 
brought one of only two bursts of ap-
plause from Chinese leaders which inter-
rupted the speech. The other came when 
the President complimented the Army 
band for its professional handling of old 
American melodies. 
The guest list at the banquet was led 
by a galaxy of Chinese leaders includ-
ing Premier Chou and two other high-
-ranking members of the Chinese Polit-
buro, Yeh Chien-ying and Li Hsien-nien. 
Other interesting guests were several 
former generals in the Nationalist Army 
of Generalissimo Chiang Xai-shek, in-
cluding Fu Tso-yi, the military governor 
who surrendered Peking to the Red 
Army in October, 1948. 
The presence of the generals ? all old 
men now, at least one of them on

One of the remarkable features of the 
President's meeting with Chairman Mao 
was the ublication in the Peoile's 
Nixon relaxing with Mr. Mao in the  
the first time in at least ,10 years that 
the Chinese press has shown the Chair-
man at home, and it served to break the 
silence Chinese officials have always 
maintained on where the Chairman 
lives. 
A A A 
Chinese officials have been candid and 
relaxed toward correspondents during 
the President's visit. Normally the offi-
cials are unfailingly courteous but are 
careful not to encourage any familiarity. 
While Mr. Nixon has been here, the 
officials have been markedly more con-
vivials stopping the press center to chat 
easily with correspondents and joking 
with them in a manner that was previ-
ously .quite rare. 
One official startled a correspondent 
he had known for eight months when he 
addressed him by his Christian name, 
the first time it had happened. Another 
sign of relaxation has been the absence 
of Mao , badges from the tunics of the 
officials from the Foreign Ministry's in-
formation department who are on duty 
in the center.

The books contain several hundred 
pages of information compiled by the 
White House, the State Department, and 
the Central Intelligence Agency, includ-
ing a run-down on the Chinese leader-
ship. 
It is intriguing to note that the section 
omits all mention of Defense Minister 
Lin Piao, Chairman Mao's nominated 
successor, and of several high-ranking 
military officers who disappeared with 
him last fall.

-ixon's Peking Talks Jolted 
/ The CIA has reported to President Nixon in 
/ Peking that, as we withdraw our troops, the 
Red forces?are moving over Southeast Asia like 
termites on a log. The current alarm concerns 
Cambodia, Thailand and Burma, all three. 
, Cambodia is only the size of Oklahoma but it 
has 6.7 million people. The President's Vietnam 
pull-out was threatened b.? ?30-,-000 North Viet-
namese in Cambodia. Our incursion into Cam-
bodia was a spoiling action covering our rear 
guard in Vietnam. But since then the keystone 
of the Nixon policy ? Vietnamization ? was 
tested by the Vietnamese Army's protectionary 
assault into Cambodia. And, as a demonstra-
tion to support the hope of Vietnamization, it 
was tragically unpromising. 
The CIA advised the President that the 
disintegration heightens. The Cambodian Army 
has only 33,000 men. Phnom Penh, the capital 
Is Cut off, of course, except for a single uncer-
tain road, but the Reds have now finished for-
tifying even fabulous Angkor Wat apd corn-
pletley control strategic Tonle Sap, the great 
lake of Cambodia. Premier Lon Nol is pressed 
toward a cease-fire. . 
THAILAND BORDERS on Cambodia; it 
stands between Cambodia, Laos and Burma. 
The Siamese (34.7 million people) call their 
? country Muang Thai, meaning Land of the Free 
People, 
It has always been fiercely independent. In 
fact, Thailand is the only nation in the entire 
area that never has been ruled by a foreign 
power. 
But the CIA has notified Mr. Nixon that Thai 
Army Commanding Gen. Prapas Charusathien 
reports that his units have intercepted Red 
Chinese and North Vietnamese soldiers cross-
ing into Thailand's Sisaket and Surin prov-
inces, 250 miles northeast of Bangkok. General 
Charusathien has .only a 141,500-man force to 
meet this expansion. 
U." S. AMBASSADOR TO CAMBODIA 
Emory C. Swank, in turn, apprised of this, is 
urging General Charusathien to add an army of 
ethnic Cambodians to meet Mao Tse-tung and 
Chou en-lai's expansion. 
? Burma, about the size of Texas, has a long 
common border with Thailand on Burma's 
Shan states. But ? Burma (27 million people), 
fabled in Kipling's verses, is as different frpm 
Thailand as day and night. The home country 
of vacillating, mercurial former United Nations 
Secretary General U Thant, Burma is one' of 
Southeast Asia's most inaccessible and 
mysterious countries 
Its actual name is the Pyee-Daun,g-lu 
Myanma Nainggan-Daw Union of Burma. The 
country is utterly provincial, totally fatalistic 
and unalterable Burmese. Neutralism, which 
likewise mesmerizes U Thant, is a fixation and 
isolationism a creed. 
BURMA CIIIEF OF STATE Gen. Ne Win, 
60, his lidded eyes as rich as jade in a face as 
? pale as bread and a man as wily and suspicious 
as U Thant himself, once told me in Mandalay, 
"Only Buddha can help anyone." And, not sur-
prisingly, Burma's Marxist economy ? 'ap-
proaches absolute thrombosis. " ? '? 
Burma has a wild, mountainous 1,200-Mile 
frontier ? a third as long as our Canadian 
border ? with Red China. Its armed forces 
total 137,500 men ? 6,500 of them iu a .com-
pletely meaningless Air Force. ? 
The. CIA reported to President Nixon In 
Peking'that 20,000 China-armed insurgents 'are 
now battling these forces. They are in a Major 
engagement near Lashio, close to Red China's 
border. And, . reported the CIA, 3,000 North 
Vietnamese are heading into Burma ? Shan 
state. ?. 
Ne Win incessantly travels abroad always 
flamboyantly ? plays golf and hobnobs :With 
world dignitaries whenever possible and 15re-
fers the city of Mandalay where "the dawn 
comes up like thunder" to his capital' of 
Rangoon. And until now Red China has adopted 
a restrained role toward Burma. The CIA opin-
ion is that Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai felt 
that they can wait until Ne Win dies or ,is 
booted out, as he booted out predecessor 1.1 
and then Red China will be sucked into Burnia 
as in a vacuum. 
The CIA message to .the President changes 
this. Unrevealed, Cambodia, Thailand ,and 
Burma alike suddenly jolt Mr. Nixon's Peking 
talks and further complicate his success over 
there.

By STAN CARTER. 
NEWS Diplomatic Correspondent 
Fifth' of a series 
UNE of the eight black-bound loose-leaf volunieS that 
President Nixon studied in preparation for his journey 
. to Peking contained a top secret analysis by the Central 
j Intelligence Agency of the strange and still only parti-
s" -ally explained events in China last fall?and the effect 
that the internal power struggle they revealed may 
have on his summit talks with the surviving Communist 
leaders. 
What went on in China in mid-September is still shrouded 
in mystery. Communist cadres in the provinces have been told 
? that Defense Minister Lin Piao?until then the regime's no. 2 
man?was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate party Chair-
man Mao Tse-tung and that when tee plot failed, Lin and his 
cohorts were killed in a plane crash in Mongolia while trying 
to flee to the Soviet Union. 
A British-built Trident jetliner, one of four purchased by 
-China from Pakistan and used exclusively by high-ranking 
- Chinese officers, did indeed crash in Mongolia, 100 miles be-
yond the Chinese border, on the night of Sept. 12. But American 
analysts doubt that Lin was among the seven men and two 
women whose bodies were recovered from the airplane, burned 
beyond recognition. . ? 
But it is clear that the power struggle has ended?at least 
.for the time being?and that a moderate faction led by Premier 
Chou En-lid triumphed over a radical faction led by Lin Piao. 
' ? 'Lin and hundreds of his followers have beenn purged, but are 
though to be still alive. 
Whatever the reasons for the purge, the timing for it seems 
-to have been sparked by Chou's invitation to Nixon to Visit the 
People's Republic of China. 
? Quarrel over resources 
Despite ApproviecifForaReleasTe'200410304n: 
elusions are probably similar to those of analysts from other. 
, government agencies and from experts outside the government, 
-
For example, Rand Corp. Sinologist William' W. Whitson ? 
has come up with a theory fitting the known facts. It suggests 
that the power struggle was the culmination of a debate within 
tho Chinese hierarchy over allocation of resources to China's 
,? nuclear weapons program?and that Chou's victory - over Lin ? 
will make China less of a threat to -U.S. allies in Asia in the 
.immediate future than it has been considered in the past. 
r-- Whitson, a military specialist, is one of those China ex-
perts who.does research for the government and also maintains 
ties with the academic community. Ills new book, "The 
Chinese High Command, 1927-1971?a History of Communist 
Military Politics," will be published this spring. 
According to Whitson, Lin Piao vigorously opposed last 
year's decision by Chou?with Mao's concurrence?to reduce 
tensions with the United States. . 
- 
The reason was that Lin and his supporters ? in the Air 
Force and Navy needed the supposed American threat to 
justify development of bigger and bigger nuclear weapons and 
long-range missiles to deliver them. 
The cost of China's nuclear and missile programs are 2% 
of the still underdeveloped country's total national product? . 
?so high that Whitson argues that "some peeple across the river 
(a euphemism in Washington for CIA headquarters in Langley, ./ 
.Va.) say that we ought to encourage them to keep at it, because 
it will make them go bankrupt." 
Challenge fo Lin 
; Whitson's contention is that Chou En-lai, in contrast to Lin, 
;recognized that the real threat to China was from Russia?
! which had massed one million troops on China's northern border 
?and threatened a "surgical strike" against Chinese nuclear in-
stallations?instead of from the United Sates, which the premier 
'could see was in fact withdrawing from Southeast Asia. 
To cope with the Soviet threat, China needed tactical nuclear 
weapons as well as more modern conventional armament?not 
necessarily long-range ICBMs. Therefore, it is Whitson's belief 
that Chou wanted to slow down the costly advanced weapons 
program and thus welcomed Nixon's overtures tn.end the 2:1-
year-old confrontation between the United States and China. 
- But the invitation to Nixon presented a challenge to Lin and 
the generals associated with part strategic planning. Whitson 
ruts it this way: 
many of the Senior officers of the .secOrid 
2%4 ? 
ation, probably including. Lin Piao, Wu Fa-hsien, Li Tso-p'eng 
and Huang Yung-sherg, the? historical image of the United 
States as the principal adversary most heavily armed with nu-
clear weapons targeted against China must have been the cor-
nerstone of their premises for strategic planning and weapons 
development. 
"President Nixon's visit to China could not have been a wel-
come shift in the image that had presumably guided their 
strategic thinking for 20 years." 
Smaller bangs 
Since the mid-1960s, China has exploded 13 nuclear devices, 
including three hydrogen bombs with yields of three megatons 
each,-in 1968, 1969 and 1970. But the last two tests, in November, 
1971 and January of -this year, were of smaller devices with 
yields of 20 kilotons or less?the size of the Hiroshima A-bomb. 
According to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the 
latest two tests could either have been of triggers or larger 
thermonuclear weapons or of prototypes of comparatively small, 
tactical nuclear warheads. If they were the latter, it would tend 
to confirm Whitson's theory that 'Chou, after defeating Lin, has 
shifted priorities ? to concentrate on medium and intermediate 
range missiles instead of a costly intercontinental missile - 
. 
arsenal. 
"Such an emphasis would provide an immediate deterrent 
against the Soviet Union," Whitson says. "It would also promise 
the greatest intercontinental utility once an appropriate sub- ? 
marine or two had been built." 
If Whitson is right; this will be disconcerting to U,S. mil- ' 
itary planners, who have advocated construction of an anti-' 
ballistic missile defense system for protection of the United 
States against Chinese ICBM's expected to be operational as 
-early as 1975, as much as against the nuclear-tipped Soviet 
intercontinental rockets already in their underground silos. 
. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird acknowledged to Congress 
this week that "it is difficult to asee i h_er the strategic 
C IPliaFfa0 -10 *6 (MR0002003 ialtina, or how 
that threat will evolve through the 1970s." But Laird said the

to know. "Experience with post-Stalin Russia," Whiting 
wrote, "has shown the importance of anticipating succession

". The presence of the task 
force in the Indian Ocean was 
never fully explained by the 
Nixon Administration. Because 
of Washington's condemnation 
of Indian actions during the

the task force as a provocation, 
a view that set off anti-Ameri-

Indian protest and a worsening 
of Indian-American relations.

cablegrams made publib by the

Well, they're all loyal Americans 
and they all share space in a remark-
able reference work called "Who's 
Who in CIA." 
? For at least a decade, broad areas 
of American intelligence operations 
have been known intimately by mem-
bers of the press and by leading 
newspaper, magazine and broadcast-
ing executives. Some of these people 
.were iiv the service of the CIA them-
selves. Others presumably allowed 
members of their staffs to cooperate 
with and report to the CIA. 
This information does not come 
from The New York Times or the Co-
lumbia Broadcasting System. It does 
not come directly from classified doc-
uments within the CIA. It does not 
come from a gossip column or a late-
night news show. It does not come 
from the Rand Corporation. 
? It comes from a 605-page book ti-
lled Who's Who In CIA and subtitled 
A Biographical Reference Work of 
the Officers of the Civil and Military 
Branches of the Secret Services of the 
USA in 120 Countries. 
Dan Pinck is a freelance writer, teacher 
and education consultant who lives in 
Belmont. Graphic art is by Herbert Ro-
9alski.  
Who's Who's In CIA was pub-
lished in English, in 1968, by Julius 
By Dan Pinck 
In his introduction publisher 
Mader refers to the United States' 
"disposal-subversionist war" and he 
writes that "the intelligence service in 
the USA is the largest and most in-
fluential in the imperialist- world" 
?and further observes that "the intelli-
gence service of the USA has always 
been the domain of the fanatical ene-
mies of democracy and a stronghold 
of the anti-communists." There's no 
doubt where Mader's sympathies lie. 
In his introduction he also notes 
those who helpea him compile the 
book. These include Mohamed Abdel-
nabi, of Beirut, Lebanon: Ambalal 
Blib.tt, of Bombay, Fernando Gainar-
ro or Mexico City, and Shozo Oliashi, 
of Yokohama. There are 3000 entries 
in the reference work and they range 
from US ambassadors, artists and 
museum curators to the directors of 
Asian and Russian research centers 
at leading American universities to 
political affairs officers,. cultural af-
fairs officers and AID controllers at 
various US embassies overseas to em-
ployees of The New York Times and 
CBS. The listing is an impressive one 
and even allowing for errors that 
even intelligence services can make, 
it is likely a reasonably accurate ac-
counting of certain leading opera-
tives and associates of the CIA. 
I bought my copy of Who's Who 
in CIA in a book shop In Georgetown, 
in Washington, D.C. for $4.95. The 
bookshop is not a subversive one; its 
main fare is academia, fiction and lit-
erary biographies. It was bought be-
cause of my curiosity about intelli-
gence services in general, an interest 
that began when I was in the OSS in 
China, as the nearest American to 
Hong Kong. A cursory sampling of 
names were recognizable to me, bear-
ing out my own personal knowledge

In the intervening months I read 
the book through, and with the publi-
cation of the Pentagon Papers, it be-
came a lively and fascinating re-
source and complement to the pub-
lished secret documents. 
In one embassy with approxima-
tely 55 staff members, for example, 
the book picked out one person as the 
CIA operative. Since that particular 
name was known to me it began to 
give a ring of authenticity to the en-
tire listing. When it noted certain US 
officials that I had met on several 
tours in 16 African nations as being 
CIA-associated, the sense of authen-
ticity grew firmer; when it listed the 
name of Dan A. Mitrione, who was 
kidnaped antl killed in Brazil several 
years ago and who was identified at 
that time as an AID official, as an op-
erative of the CIA, it's additional evi-
dence that the work is as legitimate 
(and as nefarious) as it can reason-
ably be. 
The book lists the operatives who 
have served throughout the world. 
The German Federal Republic leads 
the roster with 264 operatives. Mona-
co and Antarctica bring up the end of 
the list, with one each. In between: 
Ghana (14); the Union of Soviet So-

William Worthy, correspondent of 
The Baltimore Afro-American, was 
the first US newsman (1956-57) to 
defy the US travel ban on China. The 
resulting legal hassle over his pass-
port, which was not renewed for 11 
years, is recounted in "The Ballad of 
William Worthy" by folksinger Phil 
Ochs. 
A year or two after returning 
from China, while I was lecturing for 
a day at Texas Southern University, 
'a:Negro faculty member came up at 
the end of a seminar and identified 
himself to me as an economics pro-
fessor. 
In a- voice audible to everyone, 
and. with a broad "I know all about 
? you" grin on his face, he said: 
"You know, Mr. Worthy, when 
you were in China, I was working on 
the CIA's China desk in Washington. 
Every morning, we used to receive a 
top-secret report of your movements 
in Chinn the day before." 
. Presumably, CIA operatives still 
function inside China?possibly in 
the two-payrolls role that Khrushchev 
once joked about with CIA Director 
Allan Dulles. 
"Oh, I know you," Khrushchev 
kidded when they were introduced at 
a Washington reception: 
'We read the same reports from 
-the same agents. Why don't we get to-
gether and pay those fellows just one 
combined salary?' 
So I can't help but wonder if the

level computers in Washington. The 
speculation isn't entirely far-fetched. 
After all, however politically primi-

finding, and Lyndon Johnson did sus-
pect that the CIA tapped his Whit 
House phones. 
The day after Mr. Nixon an-
nounced his Peking travel plans, 
NBC New g contacted Chinese author-
ities about the possibility of satellite 
television coverage. Flow different 
this journalistic initiative from the 
time when I was there. In the 1950s, 
the mass media consistently played 
footsie with the Washington myth-
makers about the non-existence or 
the "imminent collapse" of the Peo-
ple's Republic of China. (Ditto revo-
lutionary Cuba not long afterwards.) 
The gospel according to Secretary 
Dulles was that any journalistic visits 
would "lend respectability" to what 
he decreed to be a tottering, outlawed 
regime. 
Under this stern edict, CBS News, 
which in its 1955 "Report to Stock-
holders" had cited me for having 
made.. the first. broadcast from Mos-
cow in eight cold-war years, ada-
mantly refused to let me take along 
to China any of their cameras or tape 
recorders. This was to protect the net-
work from any official charge of "col-
lusion" in my going. But the under-
standing was that, if I could borrow

Twice from Peking and once from 
Shanghai I was also able to broadcast 
for CBS. The first .voicecast was, of 
course, a journalistic scoop, and the 
cablegram from the New York news 
desk several hours later expressed 
professional delight. The signal to 
Oakland had been clear, the content 
satisfactory. But there was one prob-
lem. Not being attuned to the State 
Department "non-recognition" non-
sense, I had used "Peking" in the 
broadcast, instead of the old Kuomin-

Thus the punch-line Suggestion.

If acted upon, the suggestion 
would have been totally self-defeat-
ing, and I hadn't the slightest inten-
tion of heeding it. Justifiably, the 
Chinese would have been offended. 
and studios for future broadcasts 
would not have been made available. 
Knowing that David Chipp, the Reut-
ers correspondent in Peking, would 
be both amused by and scornful of 
this typical American childishness, I 
let him read the cable. 
"I'll tell you what you should do, 
Bill," he said. "On your next broad-
cast, when you reach the return cue, 
just say: 'This is Bill Worthy in Peip-

WASHINGTON, D.C. 
7.41he most elaborate security precau-
tions ever devised for a Chief of 
State will surround President Nixon 
when he arrives in Peking for his 
historic meeting with the mainland 
Chinese leaders. 
And this may come as something of 
a surprise to many Americans: the 
'United States Secret Service, traditional 
guardian of the President's safety, is 
leaning heavily on its Communist Chi-
nese counterpart to make certain that 
Mr. Nixon's visit, however sensational 
its diplomatic implications may be, is 
absolutely uneventful from the stand-
point of his personal security. 
"No matter how you slice it," a top 
U.S. security official told PARADE, "we 
must depend on the host country to 
assume the major burden of protecting 
our President. And the Chinese have 
been cooperating magnificently." 
Many of the details of the protective 
measures arranged between the Secret 
Service and Peking's -security forces 
are wrapped in secrecy, but this much 
can be told: 
The advance security preparations 
are not confined to the streets along 
which Mr. Nixon's party will travel 
through the Chinese capital or the 
quarters in which he will stay?they ex-
tend around the world. 
- Ever since the dramatic announce-
ment of the American President's forth-
coming journey burst upon the world 
last August, U.S. and Chinese security 
:experts behind the kenos have been 
checking and cross-checking every-
thing and everyone he is likely to come 
in contact with, from his drinking water 
to the elevator operator in his Peking 
guest house. 
These are the key areas of security 
concern:

has a range of 7000 miles, an 11-man 
crew, and room for 59 passengers, will 
fly from Guam to Shanghai, where it 
will pick up an English-speaking Chi-
nese navigator for the final leg. ? 
. Navigator knows 
Col. Albertazzie has no qualms about 
the professional ability of the navigator, 
the same officer who guided him into 
Peking on the Kissinger flight. 
"I was delighted with him; he's an 
excellent navigator," the American 
pilot told PARADE. "And the Peking 
International Airport has all the neces-
sary facilities, including electronic 
equipment. They have been handling 
Air France and Pakistani 707s on a 
regular basis, and they know what 
they're doing." 
Other American aircraft will precede 
and follow "The Spirit of '76" into the 
Peking Airport, including a still-un-
known number of press- planes and a 
cargo jet carrying four White House 
automobiles?one of them the armored 
Lincoln limousine in which the Presi-
dent rides wherever he goes, at home 
or abroad. 
Gasoline tested 
On the ground, the Presidential 
plane will be guarded around the clock 
by U.S. Air Force police and Chinese 
military detachments, as will the jet 
fuel for all the U.S. aircraft and the 
gasoline for the White House cars. The 
Chinese will supply a full load of 24,-
000 gallons of fuel for the return flight, 
but every drop will be tested and fil-
tered before it goes?under guard?

President's safety in the air, but it is no 
slap at his Chinese hosts: the same pre-

cooperation with their Chinese oppo-

of the way. Every manhole the Presi-

make sure that no one has planted an 
explosive device in his path (a routine 
Secret Service precaution taken on 
Presidential trips in the United States), 
and even the utility poles lining the 
streets will be examined at the very 
last moment, just in case someone 
might decide to saw three-quarters of 
the way through a pole with a view to 
toppling it into the street, thus block-
ing the cavalcade and "setting up" a 
dangerous opportunity for an attack. 
More routinely, Chinese security agents 
will keep an eye on rooftops and win-
dows along the way. 
Elevator feared 
If plans call for Mr. Nixon to enter an 
elevator at any time, the Secret Service 
wants the Chinese to check not only the 
mechanical equipment, but the oper-
ator, too. 
"There can be nothing more hair-
raising," says one veteran security 
agent, "than to have the President of 
the United States stalled in the narrow 
cOrifines of an elevator, especially if 
the operator might turn out to be un-

Diplomats as Spies 
Washington, with the welcome mat out for the Peking 
Chinese, now on American soil for the first time in over 20 
years, has been somewhat taken aback to learn that the 
leader of the advance party is one of China's top spies. 
He is Kao Liang, who with five other officials arrived in 
New York last Monday and paid his first visit to the United 
Nations Tuesday. Now out own intelligence people, pre-
sumably the CIA, have caused surprise and concern by let-
ting it be kn8rct'n that Kao has had the following assign-
ments: 
Under the "cover" of being chief African correspondent 
for the New China News Agency, he 'traveled extensively 
through Africa in the early 1960s as Peking established it-
self on the continent. 
He was the prime mover in the pro-Peking uprising in 
Zanz'ibar in 1964, passing out arms and money to the insur-
gents. When it was over, the local agent Mr Kao's news 
agency emerged as foreign minister of the new govern-
ment. 
Nobody should be surprised. The Russians regularly use 
' members of their diplomatic missions as spies. One such,. 
recently revealed by the CIA, was Vladimir Pavlichenko, 
director of external information of the United Nations Pub-
he Information Office. Pavlichenko, said the CIA, is a "vet-
eran officer" of the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency. 
Furthermore, it must be presumed that our own intelli-
gence agencies take advantage of the cloak of diplomatic 
immunity in foreign countries. Just about everybody else 
does it, so why shouldn't we? 
On the ,other hand, there is no United Nations headquar-
ters in China to which we could send a mission including 
spies. It is one more reason for establishing diplomatic re-
lations, so we can get our intelligence people in Peking. ,

The United Ste es intelligence

cial meetings -throughout main-

Communist warty groups are 
said to be advised by top party 
'delegates that Lin Piao "no

The White House has im-
posed a ban on public 
t'omment by American officials 
an political events in China. 
fIowever, reliable intelligence 
sources in Washington pri-
vately say the reports of the 
Communist party briefings are 
the most convincing evidence 
so that Mr. Lin has fallen into 
political disfavor. It is believed 
that Mr. Lin has been re.: Little Red Books Vanish

American specailists said, 
however, I hat wide gaps re-

These specialists said that 
further evidence of ,Mr. Lin's 
downfall came on Monday at 
the United Nations when the 
Peking delegation made its 
debut.. They pointed out that

countries and some of the so-
called "third world" nations,

But intelligence specialists 
believe that the crisis around

Washington, Nov. 10 (NEWS Bureau)?Kao Liang, head of Red 
China's advance party at the United Nations, is an espionage expert who 
once sckcted African recruits for guerrilla training at ChineE,e camps in 
Cuba, United States officials disclosed today.. 
These officials, revealing Kao's role as a top Chinese 
intelligence agent, told THE NEWS that he was active in 
East Africa between 1961 and 1967. 
While ostensibly serving as a 
. journalist for Peking's New China 
news agency, they said, Kao was 
a major figure in a pro-Peking 
'coup in Zanzibar in 1961, then 
moved to the French Congo 
(Brazzaville), when he advised 
the government's counterespion-
..age police and served as China's 
chief guerrilla recruitey for East 
- Africa. 
-
Kao arrived in New York Mon-
day as head of a six-man advance 
party for the offiCial. Peking UN 
delegation scheduled to arrive to-
Morrow. He paid his first visit 
to UN headquarters yesterday. 
U.S. intelligence maintains a 
fat file on the Chinese diplomat-
- journalist, who was kicked out of 
India in 1960 for "tendentious 
reporting." 
Kao had arrived in New Delhi 
as a New China news agency 
correspondent four years earlier. 
About a year after his expulsion, 
he surfaced as a roving corre-
spondent in Africa. 
Soon after, Western intelli-
gence identified . him as the 
principal Chinese Communist es-
pionage agent in East Africa. Ile 
was expelled from Mauritius, an 
island nation in the Indian Ocean 
off the African mainland, in 1961:. 
He was reportedly active in 
Nepal and in Switzerland, where 
he attended the 1961 Geneva con- Chiao Koan-hua 
ference in Laos. his most recent User to he newsman hirnself 
public appearance was last 
spring, when he accompanied the 
ChineSe,Ping-Pcmg team to Japan 
for a tommament that led to the 
historic. invitation for a U.S. team 
to visit Red China. . 
. SourceS said that Xao pastexl 
out Money and arms to pro-Chi-
nese insurgents in Zanzibar in 
194. One of them was Shiek Ab-
dul Ralunan Muhammed, a New 
China news agency stringer who 
emerged as foreign minister after' 
:the coup. 
While in Africa, Kao lived lay-
.ishly, maintaining a large house' 
and car and throwing expensive 
parties. He left Africa in March 
1967, 
' - Began With New China 
. The Chinese news agency, like 
the Tass news agency, its Soviet 
-counterpart, is considered by 
United States intelligence as a 
front for espionage activities in 
some countries. Red China's dep-
"uty foreign Minister, Chiao'Kuan-
hua, who heads the official dele-
gttion . to the :UN, began his 
career as a correspondent for the 
agency before -entering the diplo-
matic service. 
? Using the UN as a cover for 
:espionage is not new, according to, 
.U.S. sources. Last month, Ameri-
can intelligence sources leaked a 
charge that Vladimir Pavlicheako, 
. a director of the UN public in-
formation office, is an off jeer of 
the Soviet intelligence agency, the-
. C'ClAin31.erican intelligence estimated ? 
that at least half the Soviet of-
ficials at the UN are KGB agents.
