 CONSTITUTION OF THE TRADE UNIONS OF THE
 PEOPLE 'S> REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 Adopted by the Seventh All-China Congress of
 Trade Unions, 10 May 19513
 Pre amble
 The Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Cormunist
 Party of China and its great leader Comrade Mao Tse-tung, has waged a
 protracted struggle in which it established the closest alliance with
 the peasants, formed a united, front with all patriotic and' democratic
 fors to fight against imperialism, feudalism and 'bureaucratic cap!-
 tall.6m and consequently defeated the foreign imperialists and the
 inte::3aal counter-revolutionaries, thereby achieving great victory in
 the coopleis democratic revolution.
 It was after the birth of the Chinese Communist Party -a party
 of the Chinese working class itsalf,--anr under its direct leadership
 that the working-class movement of present--day China progressed along
 the road to victory.
 The trade unions of China led by- the Communist Party have rallied
 the broad ;masses of the workers around the Party and have thus become
 transmiss.on belts between the Party and the masses.  After the
 establishment of the peoples democratic dictatorship,, the trade unions
 under the leadership of the Party have become a school of administration,
 a school of management and 'a school of communism for the workers,
 The trade unions of China are mass organizations of all manual
 and not manual workers living e :hire ly or mainly on their wages, formed
 on a voluntary basis without distinction of nationality, sex or
 religious beliefs,
 The People's Republic of China is a republic led by the working
 class.  Hence, the interests of the state and the, common interests of
 the entire people constitute the .funa.asnental interests of the working
 class.  The trade unions, on behalf of the workers, should therefore
 take an active part in the enactment of laws and decrees of the state
 concerning production, labour as well as the material and cultural life
 of the workers, firmly support and carry out all the policies, laws
 and decrees of the Peoples Government, and serve as firm social.. pillars
 of the people's democratic dictatorship,

 The most important tasks of the trade unions of China during the
 period of national construction are to strengthen the unity of the
 working class, to consolidate the alliance of workers and peasants, to
 educate the workers to observe consciously the laws and decrees of the
 state and labour discipline, to strive for the development of production,
 for the constant increase of labour productivity, for the fulfilment
 and over-fulfilment of the production plans of the state, for speedy
 industrialization of the country and for steady advancement towards
 socialism.  The trade unions should constantly show concern for the
 improvement of the living and working conditions of the workers and,
 on the basis of developing production, gradually but actively improve
 the material and cultural life of the workers.
 In the state-owned enterprises, the workers are the masters of the
 enterprises, and it should be the sacred duty of the trade unions to
 mobilize and organize the workers to ensure the fulfilment and over-
 fulfilment of the state production plans.
 In enterprises jointly owned by state and private capital and in
 the enterprises which regularly do processing work for the state, it
 is the -oaramount duty of the trade unions to raise production and to
 supervise the implementation of contracts.
 In privately-owned enterprises, although the workers are still
 subjected to exploitation, their political rights anad legitimate
 economic interests are afforded effective protection by law of the
 state and by the trade union organizations.. Therefore it is also the
 duty of the trade unions in the privately owned enterprises to
 organize and educate the workers to raise production and see to it
 that the capitalists are observing the government laws and decrees,
 thus enabling these enterprises to play an active part in the national
 welfare and peoplels livelihood under the leadership of the state-
 owned sector of national economy.  This conforms with the fundamental
 interests of the working class.
 The trade unions of China are orryanized along the industrial lines,
 based on democratic centralism.  They must take collective leadership,
 persuasion and education as main methods of their work.  They must
 show concern over the interests of the"masses, crystallize their views
 and promote criticism and self-criticism.  They must consistently pay
 attention to the fight against bureaucracy and commandism which
 separate them from the masses, and at the same time, constantly improve
 the organization and discipline of the workers.
 The trade unions of China must constantly educate the workers in
 internationalism and actively take part in the international working-
 class movement.  They must strive for the unity and solidarity of the
 movement and for the defence of lasting peace in the Far East and
 throughout the world,,
