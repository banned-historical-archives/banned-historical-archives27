 The North Korean Succession
 Central Intelligence Agency
 National Foreign Assessment Center
 Key Judgments
 North Korea presents a difficult intelligence problem, because Pyong-
 yang still rules over one of the most tightly closed societies in the world. Our
 understanding of the dynamics of the domestic political situation is especially
 limited because of the highly personalized rule of North Korean President
 Kim 11-song. Still, there is a need to assess the prospects for the post-Kim era.
 In examining Kim 11-song's highly unorthodox approach to the succession
 question, we have reached the following conclusions:
 ? For the past five years or so, North Korean President Kim 11-song has
 been quietly grooming his elder son, Kim Chong-il, as his successor.
 ? Kim Chong-il, now in his late 30s, has been allowed gradually to
 assume greater responsibilities in the domestic political and economic
 realm. He is not, however, identified at public gatherings; his name is
 not mentioned by the media; and he does not meet with foreigners.
 ? The elder Kim probably sees several advantages in keeping his
 succession scheme under wraps:
 -It provides an opportunity for the son to be tested while keeping the
 elder Kim's options open if his heir does not measure up.
 -It enables Kim 11-song to avoid a lame duck status for himself.
 -It shields North Korea from possible embarrassing commentary
 from its allies as well as its detractors.
 ? Socialist states have historically had problems in arranging an orderly
 transfer of power, and the precedent-setting father-son succession
 scheme further complicates the task. Still, the special conditions at
 work in North Korea-its isolation and Kim I1-song's firm grip on the
 levers of power-render the son's chances perhaps greater than might
 otherwise be expected.

 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP81 B00401 R002100110012-7
 ? Kim Chong-il's chances will improve if the active, 66-year-old elder
 Kim holds power for another five or 10 years-particularly if the son
 finds an appropriate time to "go public." The early removal of
 Kim 11-song, however, would measurably increase the likelihood of a
 succession struggle, possibly accompanied by violence. A crucial
 question will be the extent to which the son has been able to develop
 alliances in the military and security establishments.
 ? There is no evidence that the succession scheme is having a significant
 impact on North Korea's policy. Kim II-song appears to be keeping a
 firm grip on all important policy questions, including the central issue
 of North Korea's strategy and tactics toward reunification of the
 Korean peninsula on Communist terms.
 ? If Kim Chong-il does succeed his father, he is likely to emulate him in
 taking a direct personal interest in various projects and making
 contacts at the local level; he has shown intense pride in North Korean
 performance under proper organization and motivation.

 The North Korean Succession
 Kim Chong-il-The "Party Center"
 Since at least early 1973, North Korean Presi-
 dent Kim I1-song has been grooming his elder
 son, Kim Chong-il, as his successor. The first
 indirect allusions to the process occurred in
 February 1973 when Kim I1-song unveiled the
 so-called "three revolutions team" movement at
 a major gathering of the Korean Workers Party
 (KWP). These teams, made up of representatives
 from the party, technicians, and students, subse-
 quently have been directly associated with Kim
 Chong-il. Indeed, the South Korean press jocu-
 larly refers to them as Kim Chong-il's "shock
 troops."
 Detailing the activities of Kim Chong-il is not
 an easy task. The North Korean media do not
 refer to the son by name and do not identify him
 at leadership turnouts. Kim Chong-il has never
 met with foreigners. For a while his picture was
 displayed in public places in North Korea, but
 even this practice has been curtailed to reduce
 speculation among foreign visitors about the
 son's identity and status.
 The regime nevertheless feels that it is neces-
 sary to chronicle the exploits of the younger Kim
 in some manner. To do so, Pyongyang uses
 special honorific expressions. The most promi-
 nent codeword for the son is "party center."
 The unraveling of the mystery surrounding the
 term "party center" is in itself an analytical coup
 of some merit. At first it was thought that the
 term was merely an abbreviated reference to the
 Korean Workers Party Central Committee-a
 group of more than 100 important party leaders
 that meets once or twice a year in plenary
 session. An analyst with FBIS noted, however,
 that the party center was credited with perform-
 ing tasks and conducting activities that seemed
 to be more fitting for an individual than a group.
 President Kim II-song and his son Kim Chong-il (left)
 The party center, for example, directed films,
 made inspection trips, designed city plans, orga-
 nized youth festivals, and met with various
 North Korean groups. Moreover, the party cen-
 ter has increasingly been described in terms
 usually reserved only for Kim 11-song; it is
 portrayed in the same paternalistic manner-an
 all-knowing, omnipresent, and compassionate
 leader who mingles with the common folk and is
 attentive to their needs.
 Early Life, Family
 Nepotism is not a new phenomenon in North
 Korea or, for that matter, other countries in

 Asia. A large number of Kim 11-song's relatives
 hold important positions in the North Korean
 hierarchy. Some  have demonstrated  talent;
 others clearly have advanced solely on the basis
 of their relationship to the "great leader."
 At one point it appeared that Kim 11-song was
 actively preparing his younger brother, Kim
 Yong-chu, for a leading role. At the fifth con-
 gress of the KWP in 1970, Kim Yong-chu was
 elevated to full membership on the KWP
 political committee, an elite group of some 10 to
 15 top party officials. In 1972 Kim Yong-
 chu led North Korea's delegation to the historic
 talks between North and South Korea on
 reunification.
 By early 1973 the talks foundered, and Kim
 Yong-chu began to slip in party ranking. He has
 since joined the ranks of "nonpersons." Some
 reports assert that Kim Yong-chu was demoted
 because of the breakdown in the talks; other
 reports claim he was in ill health. In any event,
 Kim Chong-il's fortunes began to rise dramati-
 cally at about the time his uncle's took their
 downturn.
 Reliable information on Kim Chong-il's early
 life is scant. His birthday is celebrated on 16
 February; there is still uncertainty about his
 birth year, although most reports place it in 1940
 or 1941. There is also uncertainty concerning the
 whereabouts of Kim 11-song and Kim Chong-il's
 mother, Kim Chong-suk, in the early 1940s.
 Most accounts suggest that Kim 11-song took
 refuge in the Soviet Union after Japanese forces
 moved vigorously against Korean Communist
 guerrilla units in Manchuria in the late 1930s.
 North Korean hagiographers put guerrilla leader
 Kim in the Korea-Manchuria border area.
 The issue could have important implications
 for the younger Kim. As successor it is important
 that his birthplace be established on Korean soil.
 In recent years, Pyongyang has focused greater
 attention on the activities of Kim 11-song and
 Kim Chong-suk during the anti-Japanese guer-
 rilla war period. Although the details of these
 accounts are vague, they leave the impression
 that Kim senior spent much of his time operating
 out of a guerrilla stronghold in the Mount
 Paektu area of the border. As such, North
 Korean propaganda extolling the "spirit of
 Mount Paektu" can be interpreted in part as an
 effort to establish the legitimacy of the younger
 Kim.
 Kim Chong-il's early family life is also ob-
 scure. According to one account, Kim Chong-il
 had a younger brother who drowned in a back-
 yard pond when the caretaker left the two boys
 unattended. Since 1974 a campaign has been
 under way to depict Kim Chong-suk, Kim
 Chong-il's mother, who died in 1949 at the age of
 32, as a fervent follower of Kim 11-song and a
 staunch revolutionary in her own right. That
 program is unquestionably meant to lend support
 to Kim Chong-il's candidacy.
 Kim 11-song remarried in the early 1950s. His
 second wife, Kim Song-ae, is a member of the
 KWP Central Committee and chairman of the
 women's league. She appears regularly in public
 and is identified as Kim 11-song's wife. Kim
 11-song reportedly has a son and daughter by this
 second marriage, but neither has been mentioned
 by name in the press.
 Expanding Duties
 Kim Chong-il is said to have made his first
 major contribution in the realm of literature and
 art soon after completing his schooling. He is
 given credit for directing the film adaptation of a
 number of well-known Korean plays and classic
 works. These films, the accounts continue, were
 produced in record time, and this has been used
 to characterize his approach to all subsequent
 endeavors.
 Kim Chong-il is also portrayed as having a
 special interest in engineering and science. He is
 credited with two concepts in industrial develop-
 ment, in particular the use of computers and
 long-distance conveyor belts. The North Korean
 press regularly contains laudatory articles about
 the successful automation of various industrial
 processes throughout the country. Some of these

 projects have become the butt of humorous sto-
 ries
 slurry pipeline is said to-have been inoperative
 for an entire year after Pyongyang announced its
 commissioning.
 There is some circumstantial evidence that
 Kim Chong-il's role-and hence his stake-in
 economic affairs goes well beyond these cele-
 brated technical innovations. In February 1974
 at the 8th plenum of the KWP Central Commit-
 tee, Pyongyang introduced a new set of long-
 range economic targets-the so-called "10 pro-
 spective goals." Long-term economic plans are
 normally promulgated at party congresses; in
 early 1974 North Korea was just entering the
 second half of its six-year plan (1971-76), an-
 nounced at the fifth party congress of the KWP
 in November 1970.
 In retrospect, it appears that the 8th plenum
 served, in effect, as a small-scale party congress
 to put the stamp of approval on these new
 targets. One reason behind this unusual step may
 have been the desire to mask the involvement of
 Kim Chong-il in formulating or supervising the
 implementation of these long-range objectives.
 Shortly after this plenum, the term "speed bat-
 tle"-a hallmark of Kim Chong-il-was first
 applied in a major way to economic production
 campaigns. The "speed battle" refers to the
 technique of mobilizing all available manpower
 resources to achieve a selected goal over a rela-
 tively short period of time.
 If Kim Chong-il did, in fact, make his debut
 on the economic scene in early 1974, his timing
 could not have been worse. Because of the world-
 wide recession of 1974, demand for North Ko-
 rean exports of raw materials dropped sharply,
 and Pyongyang in a short time began to default
 on the foreign loans it had received to cover
 imports of whole plants, machinery, and technol-
 ogy from Western Europe and Japan. North
 Korea's inability to meet even the interest pay-
 ments on the loans soured Pyongyang's global
 trade relations and in many cases delayed the
 delivery of machinery needed to complete the
 plants.
 Despite its economic woes, the regime has not
 abandoned its ambitious development plans.
 Pyongyang, after two successive years of "read-
 justment," formally launched its new seven-year
 plan (1978-84) in late 1977. The forum was the
 first sitting of the newly elected national assem-
 bly. Four of the original 10 prospective goals-
 cement, steel, coal, and marine products-were
 scaled back significantly, but the overall plan
 still seems to be beyond North Korea's reach.
 Kim Chong-il, for his part, seems to have
 weathered the poor economic performance with-
 out any noticeable change in his status. In fact,
 the adoption in May of this year of a new slogan
 seems to suggest a somewhat more institutional-
 ized role for Kim Chong-il in guiding the econo-
 my. That slogan exhorts the populace to produce
 more in the "spirit of Chollima spurred on by the
 speed campaign."
 The Chollima, or winged-horse, campaign re-
 fers to a labor-intensive production campaign
 instituted by Kim 11-song in the late 1950s-then
 the Korean version of China's "Great Leap
 Forward." For all practical purposes, Kim
 Chong-il's speed campaign or "speed battle" is
 simply an updated version of the earlier move-
 ment. Nevertheless, by formally coupling the two
 concepts, the new slogan elevates the son's con-
 tribution in directing the national economy to the
 same level as that of his father.
 Building a Political Base
 Some of the techniques used by Kim Chong-il
 to strengthen his grip on the economy have a
 political payoff as well. The three revolutions
 teams, for example, provide the younger Kim
 with a separate institutional arm to check on the
 performance of local party and administrative
 leaders. The teams are credited with eradicating
 all sorts of bureaucratic evils and outmoded
 concepts. In practical terms, this frequently
 means that many veteran functionaries who have
 been unable to cope with the new demands made
 by Pyongyang have been purged or demoted.
 Over a period of time this process provides an
 opportunity for the younger Kim to install hand-
 picked party representatives responsive to his
 leadership.

 Kim Chong-il also is in a position to exercise
 his influence through more conventional party
 channels. According to most reporting, Kim
 Chong-il has been the party secretary responsible
 for the important Organization and Guidance
 Department of the KWP Central Committee
 since at least 1974. This department coordinates
 sensitive personnel matters, including promo-
 tions, transfers, and demotions for party func-
 tionaries from the national to the local level.
 The North Korean press has discussed the
 relationship between the conventional party
 structure and the three revolutions teams at some
 length. It has revealed that considerable friction
 has sometimes arisen between local party offi-
 cials and team members. Kim 11-song evidently
 believes that the dynamic tension created by this
 interaction serves a useful purpose. It broadens
 political participation by thrusting the youthful
 members of the teams into the political process
 earlier than might otherwise be the case. It also
 keeps the party veterans off balance and prob-
 ably more attentive to Pyongyang's directives.
 In any case, the teams are developing into a
 permanent fixture on the North Korean political
 scene. At recent 30th national day celebrations
 in Pyongyang, Kim 11-song gave the teams a
 relatively strong endorsement by declaring that
 the work of the teams in the last five years had
 confirmed their "advantages and vitality." Inas-
 much as the teams have come to be closely
 identified with Kim Chong-il, the son is a pri-
 mary beneficiary of the endorsement on national
 day.
 Perhaps the most potent political weapon
 available to Kim Chong-il is his evident role as
 chief interpreter, protector, and propagandizer of
 Kim 11-song's thoughts. Since early 1974 there
 has been a nationwide movement known as "dye-
 ing the whole of society" with Kim 11-song's
 thoughts.
 Pyongyang's own treatment of the movement-
 leaves little doubt that Kim Chong-il is its motive
 force.
 The movement can be viewed at different
 levels. First of all it is an effort to link virtually
 every aspect of North Korean political life to
 some statement or aphorism from Kim's collec-
 tive works. Like Mao Tse-tung's written legacy,
 practically every word uttered by the elder Kim
 has been recorded for posterity. Six volumes of
 Kim's works, some with appropriate revisions,
 have already been published by Pyongyang.
 As Kim 11-song's personality cult has deep-
 ened, drawing a distinction between the policy of
 the KWP and Kim's testimonials has become
 increasingly difficult. As a result, whoever con-
 trols the interpretation and elaboration of Kim
 11-song's thoughts in effect sets the party line. By
 guiding the movement to indoctrinate all of
 society with Kim's thoughts, the younger Kim is
 in a position to evaluate the ideological rectitude
 of party officials and, more importantly, to cen-
 sure or demote those who are found lacking. As
 keeper of the faith and as secretary in charge of
 organizational affairs, Kim Chong-il has two
 powerful levers by which to expand his influence.
 Any attempt to assess the personal traits of
 Kim Chong-il is, of course, complicated by the
 absence of firsthand reporting about him. His
 activities, as portrayed in the North Korean
 press, do, however, provide a basis for some
 tentative observations. Like his father, Kim
 Chong-il has exhibited an intense national pride
 in the ability of the North Korean people to
 perform prodigious tasks against all sorts of
 obstacles ^ if they are properly organized and
 motivated through mass campaign techniques
 such as the "speed battle."
 The younger Kim has also displayed his fa-
 ther's penchant for taking a direct personal
 interest in various projects throughout the state
 and for meeting face to face with workers and
 officials at the local level. If Kim Chong-il
 departs in any way from the practices of his
 father, it may be that his plans are more ambi-
 tious and his own budding personality cult more
 extreme. But he also has demonstrated on occa-
 sion an awareness of what the traffic will bear,
 and  he  has  evidently  made  adjustments
 accordingly.
 The Elder Kim's Strategy
 Kim 11-song has taken great pains to conceal
 the plans for his son from the outside world. Kim
 almost certainly has domestic as well as foreign

 considerations in mind in adopting this unusual
 scheme. He undoubtedly wants to give the son an
 opportunity to prove himself in a key but unpub-
 licized role. Despite the elder Kim's immense
 power and prestige, it will take some time to
 transfer the political acceptance and legitimacy
 he enjoys to the son.
 By not acknowledging the son's existence to
 the outside world, Kim 11-song also retains the
 option of changing his plans if the son, like the
 President's younger brother, fails to measure up
 to expectations. The North Korean populace, of
 course, is fully aware of the father-son succession
 scheme. As time goes by, it will become increas-
 ingly difficult for Kim 11-song to reverse himself
 without undermining his own prestige. Whether
 the point of no return has already been reached is
 a moot question.
 Kim 11-song-an activist leader-wants to
 avoid a lameduck status for himself. He greets
 foreign dignitaries at the airport, personally pre-
 sides over all major leadership gatherings, and
 makes frequent inspection tours of the provinces.
 The father and son seem to have struck up a
 workable division of labor, with the son playing
 the behind-the-scenes role of organizer and
 enforcer.
 By keeping the younger Kim under wraps,
 Kim 11-song shields North Korea to a certain
 extent from embarrassing commentary from its
 allies as well as its detractors. Thus far, China
 and the Soviet Union, Pyongyang's two treaty
 allies, have avoided any commentary, public or
 otherwise, about Kim Chong-il by taking the
 position that the succession issue is strictly an
 internal matter.
 For reasons of cultural affinity, China is prob-
 ably more inclined to take at least a tolerant view
 of a family succession. Peking wants to keep
 Pyongyang firmly in its camp and therefore is
 willing to play up to Kim 11-song's personal cult.
 North Korea, for its part, has been relatively
 supportive of Hua Kuo-feng's efforts to prevail
 over his domestic opponents. Pyongyang was one
 of the first foreign countries to endorse Peking's
 attack on the Gang of Four.
 The Soviets are more distrustful of Kim
 fl-song and are unwilling to endorse Kim's cult.

 They have not forgotten Kim's ingratitude for
 past assistance and his penchant for taking high-
 risk actions that jeopardized Soviet strategic
 interests such as the Pueblo affair and the shoot-
 down of an unarmed US reconnaissance aircraft.
 Moscow undoubtedly does not cherish the pros-
 pect of trying to cope with Kim junior, who could
 well be as irascible and unpredictable as his
 father and in addition lack the seasoning influ-
 ence of long years of grappling with the tasks of
 nation-building.
 Kim 11-song probably is objective enough to
 recognize that his succession move is unpopular
 with other senior North Korean leaders. He
 certainly has the power to declare his son succes-
 sor at any time, but he may reason that such an
 abrupt step might only drive disgruntled ele-
 ments within the party under cover. Moving in a
 more deliberate fashion provides the elder Kim a
 better opportunity to gauge the reaction within
 influential party circles.
 The Case for Opposition
 Kim 11-song's wariness may not be misplaced,
 as there have been signs that Kim Chong-il's
 candidacy is coming up against some resistance.
 Clearly that opposition is not taking the flagrant
 form of the alleged assassination attempt in the
 fall of 1977 that had supposedly left Kim
 Chong-il a vegetable. The story, which did not
 surface until February 1978
 L
 Rather, the opposition is passive and difficult
 to measure, even when it surfaces. For example,
 some of the political movements initiated by Kim
 Chong-il have elicited less than a positive re-
 sponse from high-ranking party leaders and the
 national media. The so-called "Campaign to
 Capture the Red Flag of the Three Revolutions"
 is a case in point. Kicked off with much enthusi-
 asm in December 1975, the campaign has never
 really taken hold. It is essentially a mass exhorta-
 tion movement that seeks to spur greater produc-
 tion by bestowing symbolic rather than material
 rewards. If the recipient fails to maintain a high
 level of achievement, the Red Flag award passes
 on to the next deserving winner.

 On occasion the North Korean media have
 acknowledged that opposition to the son exists. A
 Although it is possible to isolate muted signs of
 opposition to Kim Chong-il, identifying the
 sources of that opposition is a far more difficult
 task. A few North Korean leaders have openly
 identified themselves with Kim Chong-il's cause.
 They have referred to the "party center" in
 speeches or have associated themselves with po-
 litical events designed to boost the younger Kim's
 prestige. Most of the leadership, however, has
 not publicly taken a stand.
 Despite all of the presumed backstage maneu-
 vering over the succession question in recent
 years, the top echelon of the party hierarchy has
 remained relatively stable. At the secondary
 level, however, there has been considerable
 turnover. It is tempting to speculate that these
 personnel changes are related in part to the son's
 efforts to solidify his control by moving trusted
 allies into positions of authority. No clear pattern
 emerges, however; indeed, among some of the
 political casualties have been persons who were
 thought at one time to number among the son's
 political allies because of their relative youth.
 The Succession Outlook
 Historically, Communist states have had great
 difficulty in arranging an orderly transfer of
 power. By most standards, Kim Chong-il would
 seem to have more going against him than for
 him because Kim 11-song's father-son succession
 scheme has no precedent in the Communist
 world.
 There are, however, some special conditions at
 work in North Korea that render the son's
 chances greater than might otherwise be ex-
 pected. First, of course, is Kim 11-song's great
 personal power. Many of his senior lieutenants
 may be unenthusiastic about the younger Kim,
 but they are probably loyal to Kim 11-song-he
 has systematically eliminated his rivals or near-
 rivals over the years. Thus, their resistance is
 likely to remain passive as long as Kim senior is
 around, and, as time goes by, their own numbers
 will diminish through death and illness.
 There are also no obvious challengers to Kim
 Chong-il. The elder Kim's penchant for person-
 ally overseeing virtually every aspect of North
 Korea's development has created an enormous
 gap between Kim 11-song and his immediate
 subordinates. Only party veteran Kim Il has
 anything approaching an independent stature,
 and his health is poor.
 Finally, North Korea is probably more of a
 "closed society" than any other country in the
 world. Cambodia may be more primitive and
 ruthless, but in North Korea a generation, which
 has matured under the rigid control of the
 Korean Workers Party, has received virtually
 exclusive  indoctrination  in  Kim  11-song's
 thoughts. To the people, Kim 11-song is both a
 political leader and a father figure. North Ko-
 rean propaganda has sought to capitalize on and
 magnify this personal appeal in order to establish
 the legitimacy of the son's claim. Kim Chong-il
 is presented by Pyongyang as the "embodiment"
 of Kim 11-song's thoughts.
 In assessing Kim Chong-il's chances, much
 depends on the timing and circumstances sur-
 rounding Kim 11-song's departure from the scene.
 Should the elder Kim, who at age 66 maintains
 an active schedule, continue his reign for another
 five or 10 years, Kim Chong-il's chances will
 improve correspondingly. An interval of this
 magnitude would allow time for several processes
 to unfold that would be beneficial to the son.
 At the most elementary level, it would permit
 the youthful-looking Kim Chong-il to mature
 physically and to develop more poise and the
 kind of commanding presence that has long been
 exhibited by his father. Korean society, like most
 Asian cultures, still places a premium on age,
 equating it with wisdom and authority.

 It would also give the elder Kim sufficient
 time to orchestrate his son's public unveiling at
 an appropriate time. When that time might come
 about is anybody's guess. Given Kim Chong-il's
 evident role in the current seven-year economic
 plan, the successful conclusion of that plan might
 make a suitable occasion for bringing the son
 forward. The plan is not supposed to end until
 1984, but if past experience is a guide, North
 Korea might claim "prefulfillment" of the plan
 as early as 1982.
 Most of the veteran party leaders who now
 form Kim 11-song's inner circle of advisers are in
 their 60s or older. In five to 10 more years a
 younger generation of leaders inevitably will
 move into the party elite. These new leaders
 presumably would be more responsive to the
 younger Kim, or at least they would present less
 of a challenge to his authority.
 If, on the other hand, Kim 11-song dies or
 becomes incapacitated in the near term, the
 likelihood of a struggle over the succession in-
 creases measurably. The contest might well take
 the form of the traditional palace intrigue. Inas-
 much as Kim Chong-il has never been introduced
 to the outside world, he could be quietly moved
 off center stage by a coalition of party and
 military veterans. The anti-Kim Chong-il plot-
 ters presumably would be united only in their
 opposition to the younger Kim.
 A succession struggle in North Korea could be
 accompanied by violence. Kim II-song has ruled
 continuously since 1945, and there is no prece-
 dent to serve as a guide for a transfer of power.
 outcome, it is doubtful that unrest would-be
 permitted to spread uncontrolled throughout the
 country or that there would be a general break-
 down in law and order. That could invite un-
 wanted intrusion by China or the Soviet Union;
 worse yet, it could encourage Pyongyang's rival
 in the South to take advantage of the North's
 disarray.
