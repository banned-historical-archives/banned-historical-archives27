 scribe as "offensive," aimed at controlling northeast Asia, driving out the
 United States, and encircling China both politically and militarily. We
 believe the Chinese"are acutely aware of their weak and vulnerable position
 relative to both of the superpowers-especially the USSR. Chinese preoc-
 cupation with the Soviet threat is evident in the assertion by the Chinese
 that they share a common interest with the United States in opposing
 Soviet expansion in some areas and, thus, that they cannot follow an
 equidistant course between the superpowers.
 Despite its concern over encirclement, Beijing regards the Soviet military
 presence on its borders as less of an immediate threat than a form of
 intimidation intended to influence Chinese policy and to reduce Chinese
 influence in the region. We believe Beijing has, for a variety of reasons,
 concluded that a Soviet military attack is highly unlikely and that the
 threat does not now require a substantial increase in military spending.
 In our view, a combination of factors relating to China's security led to this
 reassessment; the following appear to be most important:
 ? An assessment that internal economic and political constraints on
 Moscow would weigh against Soviet involvement in a land war in China,
 a conviction that the Soviets are overextended in Afghanistan, and a
 belief that the Soviets would fear being caught in a two-front war with
 NATO in the event of hostilities with China.
 ? Evidence of a buildup of US military forces in the Pacific, which serves
 to counter Soviet military increases.
 ? Clear Soviet concern about closer Sino-US relations, especially following
 the visits of Secretaries Baldridge and Weinberger.
 ? A growing confidence in the deterrent value of Chinese conventional and
 strategic forces, strengthened in recent years by the modernization
 program, and in China's defense strategy, which promises a long, hard
 fight to any potential aggressor.
 ? A judgment that Soviet forces now on the northern border are insuffi-
 cient to take and hold a sizable portion of China.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/09/27 :CIA-RDP84S00928R000100150003-4
 We believe Beijing is also taking deliberate measures to avoid provoking
 the Soviets and to reduce tensions along the border:
 ? Despite the lack of significant progress in the Sino-Soviet consultations
 that began last year, Beijing has continued the discussions and views
 them as a useful means of easing tensions.
 ? China is no longer publicizing military exercises that might be construed
 as anti-Soviet, such as the large and highly publicized exercise in 1981
 north of Beijing.
 The Soviet threat has had a major impact on the thinking of Chinese
 military officers who must prepare the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for
 a possible Soviet attack. Development and acquisition of new weapons,
 training, and tactics and strategy are heavily influenced by China's
 knowledge of Soviet capabilities. To defend against an attack the Chinese
 are focusing on relatively inexpensive antiarmor and antiaircraft weapons,
 development of combined-arms tactics and forces to cope with superior
 Soviet mobility and firepower, and improvement of measures to enable
 forces to survive during the first critical days of combat.
 Beijing showed in its 1979 invasion of Vietnam that it was willing to take
 risks in order to challenge Soviet expansion in Asia. We believe the
 Chinese will continue to take tough political and diplomatic stands on
 important regional security issues, but a mix of factors makes alarge-scale
 Chinese assault unlikely:
 ? Vietnam's massive military buildup of border forces since 1979 mitigates
 against a replay of China's first invasion in which Chinese troops made
 shallow penetrations along the entire frontier.
 ? Beijing's desire and need for a prolonged era of peaceful relations with iYs
 neighbors in order to modernize the economy will make China approach
 potentially volatile situations with caution.

 There are, however, circumstances that could well lead Beijing to mount
 another punitive attack on Vietnam-the most likely would be in response
 to an escalation of Vietnamese military activity that threatened Thailand:
 ? China could mass its air, ground, or naval forces and strike a specific
 area or targets in Vietnam in such a way as to have the military
 advantage.
 ? The most likely targets would be strategically or economically important
 facilities such as the coalfields in the northeast, but China could also
 exploit its naval advantage by mounting an amphibious operation against
 one or more Vietnamese-held islands in the Spratlys.
 In our view, the persistence of Soviet military pressure on China and the
 lack of indications of a willingness to concede on any of China's precondi-
 tions for improved relations will continue to nudge Beijing closer to
 Washington. We believe such a leaning is not inconsistent with Beijing's
 independent foreign policy line which accepts a tilt toward the United
 States on the basis of a shared interest in opposing the Soviets. In our judg-
 ment, however, barring a collapse in the Sino-Soviet talks and a sudden in-
 crease in tensions, China will scrupulously avoid steps-such as signing
 formal defense commitments-that could jeopardize its ability to manage
 the Soviet threat unilaterally.

 China:
 Managing the
 Soviet Threat
 Policy Shifts
 The Chinese are entering the mid-1980s with no signs
 of a diminution of the Soviet buildup of military
 capabilities in Asia that has gone on for over 15 years.
 During that time Beijing, from a position of military
 inferiority, has observed the varying pace and extent
 of Soviet expansion in the region and has adjusted its
 foreign and defense policies accordingly. We believe
 the adjustments are Beijing's means of managing the
 Soviet threat in order to maintain China's security
 and independence while preserving a peaceful setting
 for national modernization.
 Although acause-and-effect relationship tying Chi-
 nese actions to Soviet military developments is not
 apparent in every case (important economic and politi-
 cal factors were also at work), there has been a strong
 correlation between the two:
 - Soviets appear aggressive to China following
 the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the military
 buildup on the Sino-Soviet border and in Mon-
 golia, and the strong reaction to the border
 crisis with China.
 China, worried about the imminence of war,
 steps up defense production to record levels,
 redeploys armies to the north, and breaks from
 strict diplomatic isolation with the beginning of
 substantive contacts with the United States.
 ? 1972-77.
 The pace of Soviet military expansion along the
 border slows down; Soviets await a positive
 change in Chinese attitude following the death
 of Mao.
 - China talks less of the imminence of war,
 sharply reduces defense production, slows the
 fortification of the northern front, continues
 normalization of relations with the United
 States, and maintains ongoing but unproductive
 border talks with the Soviets.
 - The Soviet buildup in the Far East resumes and
 includes construction of SS-20 bases, deploy-
 ment of Backfire bombers, establishment of a
 new high command, modernization of the Pacif-
 ic Fleet, and a friendship treaty with Vietnam
 plus military aid to Vietnam in exchange for air
 and naval basing rights, and Afghanistan is
 invaded.
 - China establishes formal relations with the
 United States, breaks off new border talks with
 the Soviets in response to the invasion of
 Afghanistan, invades Vietnam as a challenge to
 the Soviet-backed Vietnamese occupation of
 Kampuchea, institutes a new buildup of its
 northern defenses, and talks of a united front of
 strategic cooperation with the United States
 and Japan against the USSR.
 Since 1982 the Soviets have continued to threaten
 China by modernizing their forces in the Far East,
 adding new ground force units, and deploying addi-
 tional SS-20 missiles. But Moscow has added no
 ground force divisions in Mongolia since 1979, which
 is also the year of the last major Soviet military
 exercise along China's borders; and, although their
 use of air and naval facilities in Vietnam has expand-
 ed, the Soviets have not supplied the Vietnamese with
 sophisticated equipment that would enhance their

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/09/27 :CIA-RDP84S00928R000100150003-4
 capabilities against China.
 During the same period, Beijing readjusted its rela-
 tionship with the USSR and the United States. Last
 year China proclaimed an "independent" foreign poli-
 cy and strongly reemphasized its intent to remain
 largely self-sufficient in defense modernization. It has
 stopped calling for a united front and last year began
 high-level talks with the Soviets aimed at normalizing
 relations. The Sino-US relationship, which cooled off
 in 1981 over the issue of arms sales to Taiwan, has
 recently warmed up. The communique signed in 1982
 established an understanding on arms sales to Tai-
 wan, and both sides have made efforts in 1983 to
 smooth out bilateral irritants over trade and the
 transfer of US technology to China. As a result of
 Defense Secretary Weinberger's visit to Beijing in
 September 1983, the two sides have agreed in princi-
 ple to exchange military missions beginning in 1984,
 and the United States has offered China the opportu-
 nity to buy defensive weapons, such as antitank and
 antiaircraft missiles
 Description of the Threat
 The Chinese remain deeply suspicious of Soviet inten-
 tions and genuinely concerned about the expansion of
 Soviet power. This is true despite Beijing's announce-
 ment last year that it had adopted a policy to establish
 a more balanced relationship with the United States
 and the Soviet Union. The opening of consultations
 with the Soviets toward normalizing relations and the
 gradual improvement over the last year in Sino-Soviet
 trade and cultural exchanges have not been accompa-
 nied by any softening of China's hostility toward the
 Soviets. Instead, at the highest levels of the party and
 in the Foreign Ministry, there persists awell-formu-
 lated and widely accepted perception that the Soviets
 pose the greatest long-term threat to China:
 ? In a speech early this year on China's foreign policy
 concerns, Vice Foreign Minister Yao Guang told his
 audience that, in Beijing's view, the Soviet Union
 would continue its worldwide offensive throughout
 the 1980s.
 ? The Chinese Foreign Ministry recently reiterated
 Beijing's view that the Soviet Union is the main
 threat to China and to Asia and concluded that any
 attack in the region would be made by the USSR.
 Afghanistan
 Specifically, the Chinese see themselves as the focus
 of Soviet strategy in Asia, which they describe as
 "offensive," aimed at controlling northeast Asia, driv-
 ing out the United States, and encircling China both
 politically and militarily. In that regard, they link
 Soviet military and political ties to India, the Soviet
 invasion of Afghanistan, the ongoing Soviet military
 buildup and modernization on China's northern bor-
 der, the expansion of the Soviet Navy in the Pacific,
 and Soviet support of Vietnam and the expanding
 Vietnamese presence in Indochina. As a measure of
 their concern, the Chinese take account of these
 conditions in setting preconditions for normalizing
 relations with the Soviets: reduction of forces along
 the Sino-Soviet border and in Mongolia, an end to
 Soviet support of Vietnamese occupation of
 Kampuchea, and withdrawal of Soviet forces from

 The encirclement concept has become the hallmark of
 Beijing's portrayal of Soviet designs against China. It
 not only reflects real concerns but it conveniently
 unifies in one idea the military and political aspects of
 China's case against the Soviet Union-the trend,
 extent, and offensiveness of Soviet expansion. It also
 has great propaganda utility because it is supportable
 by objective criteria; places the Soviets on the defen-
 sive; and, for world and local opinion, it puts China-
 a weaker power-in the sympathetic position of a
 victim of Soviet expansion. In talks with Western and
 Soviets who the  sa  now directl  threaten China on
 two fronts.

 The Northern Border. The Chinese dedicate the bulk
 of their air and ground forces to defense against the
 Soviet threat on their northern border. They are
 vulnerable there with the industrial northeast sur-
 rounded on three sides by Soviet forces, the capital
 only some 600 kilometers from the Mongolian border,
 and the vast territories of the northwest only lightly
 defended. Beijing knows that the Soviets have some
 50 well-armed and highly mobile divisions and over
 2,000 combat aircraft arrayed for use against China.
 Chinese spokesmen are concerned about the deploy-
 ment to the Far East of 108 SS-20 missiles capable of
 hitting targets in China and are aware that the
 expansion of the Pacific Fleet has made it the largest
 in the Soviet Navy.
 Vietnam. Soviet aid to Vietnam and the Vietnamese
 political and military involvement in Southeast Asia
 are nettlesome issues to the Chinese. With Moscow's
 help since the Chinese invasion of 1979, Hanoi has
 stand on Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, as carried
 in the People's Daily in December 1982, is that it
 represents "a major step in the Soviet global strategy
 for world domination." More specifically, according
 to comments in April 1983 by Ma Xusheng, the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs' senior specialist on the
 Soviet Union, Soviet strategy in South Asia revolves
 around its long-term drive to the Indian Ocean.
 Moscow would not necessarily employ military force
 but would use political influence as a lever to force out
 the United States.
 Our assessment of Chinese behavior and statements
 indicates that Beijing draws a sharp distinction be-
 tween the long-term threat from Soviet global aspira-
 tions and the short-term threat from Soviet forces on
 China's periphery. We believe the Chinese have be-
 come increasingly confident that the Soviet Union
 poses no immediate threat to China's security.
 Chinese officials have described the air and naval
 basing rights the Soviets gained in exchange for their
 assistance as steppingstones for further Soviet expan-
 sion. They portray the Vietnamese as proxies of the
 gained general acceptance in China over the last few
 years as a result of careful Chinese analysis of Soviet

 na's defense posture, an assessment of other factors
 constraining the Soviets from taking military action,
 and the growth of US military power.
 Soviet Capabilities
 Chinese military officers and strategists are nearly
 unanimous in their assessment that Soviet forces
 along the northern border and in Mongolia are insuf-
 ficient to take and hold a large portion of northern
 China. Deng Xiaoping and other officia
 The Chinese now play down the likelihood of a Soviet
 "surgical strike" against strategic targets such as
 storage sites for nuclear weapons. Zhang Jingyi, head
 of the Strategic Studies Institute of the Chinese
 Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), in September
 1983 told a US official that the Chinese believe the
 threat of such an attack has significantly diminished
 since the Cultural Revolution, when tensions with the
 Soviets peaked and China's military capability was at
 its low point.
 China's Defense
 Although China's forces lack the firepower and mo-
 bility of the modern armies arrayed against them,
 defense officials are confident their manpower re-
 serves, terrain, and strategy of protracted war will
 25X1

 deter a Soviet attack. A Chinese military strategist   25X1
 recently noted that, although the Chinese expect to
 take heavy losses during the early stages of conflict
 with the Soviets, they believe that "geography, time,
 and manpower" would turn the tide in China's favor.

 They appear convinced, moreover, that their strategy
 of "people's warfare" would ensure that a Sino-Soviet
 conflict would be protracted-a situation they believe
 the Soviets would want to avoid.
 The Chinese also appear confident that their small,
 concealed missile force deters a preemptive nuclear
 attack by the Soviets.

 Soviets "uncertain" and "sometimes, that is
 enough."'
 This perception has a bearing on China's approach to

 committee foreign policy research group-called the
 SS-20s "political weapons that are not of much
 military use." He noted that the Chinese believe
 SS-20s are targeted on China as well as on Japan and
 the United States, but that they are no greater threat
 than existing Soviet ICBMs presumably also targeted
 against China. Beijing will, of course, continue to
 press Moscow to reduce its deployment of SS-20s in
 the eastern USSR.
 In our view, China's recent success in providing newer
 weapons to the conventional forces and in its overall
 program for military modernization has helped to
 reinforce Chinese confidence in their ability to stand
 up to the Soviet Union.2 Chinese military officers take
 pride in the advances made in military training,
 education, and weaponry toward making a truly

 expansion is an unalterable aspect of Moscow's for-
 eign policy will, over the long term, continue to play a
 prominent role in China's relations with the Soviet
 Union and the United States and will be a major
 factor in China's defense planning and strategy. Bar-
 ring any sudden unforeseen increase in the immediate
 Soviet military threat, we believe Beijing will remain
 confident it can manage the threat and will not be led
 to act precipitously in its relations with the super-
 powers.
 For Defense
 The Soviet threat has had a major impact on the
 thinking of Chinese military officers who must pre-
 pare the PLA for a Soviet attack, and we believe that
 impression is unlikely to change. The military mod-
 ernization program is aimed, in large measure, at
 improving training and developing conventional weap-
 ons to combat a major Soviet offensive, and we expect
 that trend to continue, especially in the following
 areas:
 ? Weapons. The priority items for Chinese develop-
 ment and technology acquisition will be light anti-
 tank and antiaircraft weapons, which can be pro-
 duced relatively cheaply and in large quantities, to
 help offset the threat posed by Soviet superiority in
 armor and combat aircraft and helicopters. Acquisi-
 tion of armored vehicles and fighter aircraft will
 continue, but, because of their expense, they proba-
 bly will not enter the force in large numbers.
 ? Training. Recent efforts to develop combined-arms
 tactics, necessitated-we believe-by China's con-
 cern about the mobility and firepower of Soviet
 armies opposite China, will expand to involve more
 units in the north, and more Army divisions will be
 mechanized for improved cross-country operations.
 We believe China's current moderate and stable level
 of defense spending is in part a reflection of the
 perception that the Soviets pose little immediate
 threat. One aim of Beijing's attempt to reduce ten-
 sions along the border almost certainly is to avoid
 additional justification for the military to demand
 increases in defense appropriations. Modernization of
 agriculture, industry, and science and technology
 holds higher priority in China's four modernizations
 than does defense, and we believe Beijing will make
 every reasonable effort to keep to a minimum the
 military's competition for state funds.
 For Risk Taking
 China is not immune to Soviet military pressure, but
 we believe Beijing would be willing to take certain
 risks in order to challenge Soviet expansion in Asia.
 The Chinese appear confident that their own
 strengths combined with what they see as constraints
 on a major Soviet attack give them some leeway to
 take tough stands on important regional security
 issues, particularly in Southeast Asia. In our view,
 escalation of Vietnamese military activity in
 Kampuchea or Laos that spilled over into Thailand
 and threatened Thai security could lead Beijing to
 teach Hanoi a "second lesson," but it almost certainly
 would take a different form than the scenario used in
 China's first invasion in which Chinese troops made
 shallow penetrations along the entire Sino-Vietnam-
 ese frontier. In order to mount successful punitive
 actions against Vietnam in the future, we believe the
 Chinese would have to mass air, ground, or naval
 forces against one or two specific Vietnamese targets.
 Beijing's desire and need for a prolonged era of
 peaceful relations with its neighbors in order to
 modernize the economy will, nevertheless, at a mini-
 mum make China cautious in its approach to situa-
 tions with the potential for volatile repercussions.
 For the United States
 In our view, the persistence of Soviet military pressure
 on China and lack of indications of a willingness to
 concede on any of China's preconditions for improved
 relations will continue to nudge Beijing into close
 company with Washington. We believe such a leaning
 is not inconsistent with Beijing's independent foreign
 policy line which accepts a tilt toward the United
 States on the basis of a shared interest in opposing the
 Soviets. In our judgment, however, barring a collapse
 in the Sino-Soviet talks and a sudden increase in
 tensions, China will scrupulously avoid steps-such as
 formal defense commitments-that could jeopardize
 its ability to manage the Soviet threat by and large
 unilaterally.
