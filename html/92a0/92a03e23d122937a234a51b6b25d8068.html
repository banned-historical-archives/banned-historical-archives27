 Communist China: IsMaolll?
 Peking's decision to curtail sharply the tra-
 ditional National Day celebrations on 1 October
 almost certainly was due to a major internal polit-
 ical development perhaps precipitated by the ill-
 ness of Mao Tse-tung. Several Western press
 services, attributing their information to diplo-
 matic observers in Peking, report that prepara-
 tions for the major rally scheduled for National
 Day were inexplicably suspended last week; this
 has since been confirmed by a spokesman of the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The cancellation of
 these festivities is unprecedented.
 Peking's decision does not appear
 25X1   to have been taken by a plenary
 session of the party central com-
 mittee but by a smaller group of
 central politburo fi ures.
 The regime apparently had
 intended to put on a spectacular
 show. The French AFP corres-
 pondent in Peking reported on
 21 September that beginning in
 late August thousands of parade
 participants were seen daily prac-
 ticing in formation at Tien An
 Men Square and that workers were busily con-
 structing floats for the parade. He noted that
 these preparations came to an abrupt halt at the
 "beginning of last week." This would suggest that
 the decision to scale down the celebrations was
 probably made on or about 12 September.
 The most obvious explanation for the re-
 gime's reluctance to put on its traditional show,
 with its mandatory leadership turnout, is that a
 FAR EAST
 key member of the ruling politburo is seriously
 ill. Mao Tse-tung last appeared on 7 August and
 his designated heir, Defense Minister Lin Piao, has
 not been seen since early June. Premier Chou
 En-lai, Madame Mao, and other important civilian
 politburo members evidently are not seriously ill
 since they have made public appearances in the
 past few days. Despite the fact that frequent
 public absences by both Mao and Lin are not
 unusual, Mao has never missed a National Day
 celebration; the assumption he would not appear
 Mao Tse-tung
 this year has triggered intense
 speculation  concerning  his
 health. It seems highly unlikely
 that Peking would delay an an-
 noucement of his death for as
 long as one week. Chinese Com-
 munist spokesmen in Hong Kong
 and at several Chinese embassies
 have claimed that Mao is in ex-
 cellent health.
 Another  possible  explana-
 tion is that the jockeying for po-
 sition that has been under way
 within the ruling politburo for
 some time has taken a new turn.
 Since  last March, four civilian
 members of the 25-member polit-
 buro have dropped from public view for varying
 lengths of time. They appear to be in serious
 political trouble as a result of a prolonged investi-
 gation into extremist policies associated with the
 Cultural Revolution. Recently, there have been
 tenuous indications that the investigation has
 broadened to involve key military figures. Over
 the past week, all but one of the military leaders
 on the politburo have failed to make public ap-
 pearances, a possible indication that they are

 involved either in further behind-the-scenes ma-
 neuvering in Peking or, if Mao really is ill, in
 discussions on maintaining leadership unity and
 internal security.
 The nonappearance of China's ranking mili-
 tary authorities and the cancellation of prepara-
 tions for the 1 October rally have coincided with
 a nationwide standdown of most military flights
 since 12 September. Thus there may be a relation-
 ship between this unprecedented suspension of
 flight activity and internal political developments.
 Communist China:  Drumming Up Business Abroad
 Peking's dispatch  of several high-ranking
 trade delegates abroad has highlighted China's ef-
 fort to strengthen international economic and
 political ties, particularly with European states.
 The minister of foreign trade is to head a delega-
 tion to France, Italy, and Algeria next month.
 The trips to Paris and Rome are to reciprocate
 similar visits to Peking during the past year and to
 assess interest in increased trade, while the stop in
 Algiers will concern, at least in part, utilization of
 a recently concluded Chinese credit agreement.
 China's deputy foreign trade minister, who
 recently completed a visit to Guyana, is currently
 on a tour of Scandinavian countries, meeting with
 industrial representatives and political leaders.
 China's minister of light industry has been visiting
 Yugoslavia over the past week in conjunction
 with Peking's participation in the Zagreb trade
 fair for the first time in over ten years. Later this
 month, Chinese textile experts are expected to
 visit Italy, France, and Switzerland.
 With these initiatives, the Chinese are at-
 tempting to exploit foreign interest in developing
 a larger China market; Peking hopes to gain sup-
 port from these countries for its international
 political position,. At the same time, face-to-face
 contacts with foreign industrialists will further
 refurbish the international business community's
 confidence in China, badly damaged by Peking's
 erratic behavior during the Cultural Revolution.
 Wider trade relations, particularly with developed
 European states, also may enable the Chinese to
 obtain much-needed sophisticated equipment at
 favorable  prices.
 SECRET
 So far, there has been no public reaction in
 Peking to the decision to scale down National
 Day festivities. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs has announced that cancellation of the
 usual parade in Peking and other major ceremo-
 nial activities throughout the nation is merely a
 "reform" designed to change the traditional way
 of celebrating the holiday. This rationale appears
 singularly thin given the abruptness with which
 the unprecedented decision apparently was taken,
 the continuing standdown in military flight activ-
 ity, and other anomalous developments, which all
 convey the impression that the decision was 25X1
 prompted  by some  major  problem besetting
 China's unsettled leadership coalition.

 Indochina
 Opposition is mounting against President
 Thieu's plan to run alone, but he seems deter-
 mined to ride out the storm. Radical student
 groups in Saigon are taking a leading role in the
 protest movements so far. They have made fire-
 bomb attacks and have caused the most violent
 confrontations with police since the student and
 veteran demonstrations more than a year ago.
 American personnel and property have been at-
 tacked in Hue and Saigon. Student protests are
 focusing on Thieu's referendum policy, but other
 long-term grievances, such as compulsory student
 military service, are also at issue.
 It is clear that Vice President Ky and his
 staff are actively supporting the students and that
 they still are trying hard to rally all anti-Thieu
 factions, including veterans and  religious, po-
 litical, and military groups as well as students,
 into a united front. Ky has close ties with some
 veteran groups and apparently has gained ground
 among the students. He also has approached Big
 Minh and may have won over some members of
 Minh's staff. But Big Minh himself as usual is
 wary of being used by Ky, and it is questionable
 whether the two will be able to cooperate.
 The feeling of crisis in Saigon may have been
 intensified by a number of seemingly random,
 violent actions; last week, an explosion devastated
 a night club in the middle of the downtown area,
 and this week terrorist attacks were reportedly
 made against the country's foremost labor leader
 and a prominent senator. Critics are likely to
 speculate that the government is somehow in-
 volved in these incidents. It seems at least equally
 likely, however, that they are the work of the
 Communists or radical opponents of the govern-
 ment bent on heightening tensions.
 A surprising number of personalities and
 groups who have backed Thieu in the past have

 been adding their voices to protests against the
 referendum.
 Stirrings of dissent also are being heard in
 the National Assembly from former Thieu sup-
 porters as well as from long-term oppositionists.
 A Lower House bloc has adopted a manifesto
 urging that all means be used to oppose Thieu's
 re-election. The Upper House has passed a resolu-
 tion criticizing the President's tactics and urging
 him to step down while a new, contested election
 is organized.
 Despite this heavy fire, Thieu retains over-all
 control of the situation. The army still seems to
 be behind him, the An Quang is not on the
 attack, and the various opposition elements are
 having trouble agreeing on a specific alternative to
 the referendum plan. The population in the coun-
 tryside outside of Saigon, among whom Thieu has
 cultivated support for years, is largely indifferent
 to the concerns of students and other urban po-
 litical factions. These considerations will work in
 Thieu's favor during the turmoil of the next
 couple of weeks, but it seems likely that he will
 have to do a good deal of fence-mending if he
 hopes to restore political stability in the cities
 over the longer term.
 Enemy Action Up
 Communist attacks inflicted  fairly sub-
 stantial allied casualties in several parts of South
 Vietnam last week. The most damaging assault
 was conducted by a sapper unit against a major
 South Vietnamese command post just west of
 Tay Ninh city early in the week. The assault was
 preceded  by a heavy mortar and large-caliber
 rocket barrage-a new twist in sapper tactics. It
 accounted for 21 South Vietnamese troops killed
 and 63 wounded, against 54 of the attackers
 killed and seven captured.
 Most Communist attacks this week were
 staged by local force and sapper units, but in the
 western delta the Communists are deploying
 larger units against South Vietnamese troops at-
 tempting to clear the U Minh Forest. In the most
 vigorous enemy countereffort since the govern-
 ment operations began there late last year, the
 enemy is accepting heavy casualties in order to
 maintain pressure on positions established by the
 South Vietnamese 21st Division. This enemy
 action has probably been prompted by the need
 for the North Vietnamese 95th and 18B and the
 Viet Cong D-2 regiments to defend important
 base camps in the forest. The actions, however,
 could also be in response to appeals from higher
 commands for attacks in strength before Presi-
 dent Thieu's referendum on 3 October.
 There have been a number of exhortations
 to increase military harassment and intimidate
 voters in order to disrupt the balloting through-
 out South Vietnam. Most of these have called for
 stepped-up activities from 20 September through
 5 October. Major North Vietnamese combat units
 could  begin larger scale offensive activities in
 some regions, the  DMZ area and the central
 highlands for example, but these are more likely

 25X1       October.
 Cambodia: On the Road to Kompong Thom
 Government forces are resuming their drive
 to reopen Route 6 to the long-isolated town of
 Kompong Thom. The light enemy resistance that
 the Cambodian Army's Chenla II operation has
 encountered since it was launched a month ago
 probably prompted Prime Minister Lon Nol to
 reverse his earlier decision to halt the drive at
 Kompong Thmar, at the junction of Routes 6 and
 21. Four battalions from the Chenla I I task force
 have now occupied Tang Krasang. They are
 expected to continue the effort to clear the
 remaining  15 miles between that town and
 Kompong Thom.
 The success of Chenla II appears to have
 stimulated the army high command to begin map-
 ping out similar campaigns to reopen sections of
 other key highways during the dry season. A
 senior army officer recently told the US defense
 attache that Phnom Penh's plans call for reoc-
 cupying Route 15 north of Prey Veng, reopening
 Route 7 from Krek to Tonle Bet, and clearing
 Route 3. The officer also said that Lon Not is still
 talking  about trying to retake Kratie Province,
 although other Cambodian leaders recognize that
 this would be a very difficult and ambitious
 undertaking.
 The Communists' failure to offer any sig-
 nificant opposition to Cambodian units on Route
 6 has been in keeping with the generally conserva-
 tive military posture they have maintained during
 most of the rainy season. Relying on economy-of-
 force tactics, they have focused on harassing a
 number of other main lines of communication. In
 recent weeks, they have been particularly active
 in the northwest, where they have carried out a
 series of disruptive actions against Route 5 and
 the rail line running from Battambang to Phnom
 Penh. Enemy elements have also been putting
 more pressure on Siem Reap town.
 Enemy activities were capped by another
 "spectacular" in the Phnom Penh area when, on
 19 September, the Communists struck Esso and
 Shell petroleum storage tanks with rocket and
 mortar fire. The attack was the most significant
 action in Phnom Penh since the raid last January
 on the city's airfield. Eight of the 14 tanks at the
 Esso facility and six of the 15 tanks at the Shell
 facility were damaged; 2 million gallons of fuel
 went up in smoke.
 The damage has produced a temporary dis-
 ruption of petroleum supplies for Phnom Penh's
 civilian population, and gasoline rationing has
 been reinstituted. Military operations will not be
 affected.
 The
 Cambodians currently have a surplus of chartered
 petroleum vessels and can use some of these as
 floating reserves until the stationary tanks are
 repaired.
 Laos: Preparing for the Future
 Both sides in north Laos are preparing for
 the dry season, no more than a month or so away.
 Restrained by policy considerations from probing
 farther eastward, Vang Pao's irregulars are digging
 in on the ground they already hold and are trying
 to take a number of tactically important positions

 on the northern edge of the Plaine des Jarres. The
 irregulars lost these positions in late August.
 The North Vietnamese, although they have
 been avoiding large-scale attacks, have been trying
 to keep the irregulars off-balance. Some enemy
 troops have redeployed to contest Vang Pao's
 moves north of the Plaine, but otherwise the
 North Vietnamese have given no firm sign of
 where or when they will start the offensive to
 retake the Plaine.
 PHILIPPINES: President Marcos last week rein-
 stated the writ of habeas corpus in 27 of the
 Philippines' 66 provinces because, he said, the
 "Communist insurgency" has substantially ended.
 Habeas corpus was suspended on 23 August after
 grenades killed ten people at an election rally in
 Manila. Marcos' action in suspending the writ
 brought heavy criticism that he had overreacted
 and was trying to use the bombing incident to
 move  against  his political enemies. Although
 Vang Pao's forces this summer captured
 nearly 1,000 tons of supplies, including 863 tons
 of food, 88 tons of ammunition, and 12 tons of
 weapons. This is only about one eighth of the
 amount they lost to Vang Pao in 1969. Although
 the losses will set back the Communist timetable,
 the supplies can be replenished within a relatively
 short time.
 Government forces are continuing to-expand
 their control around the town of Paksong, taken
 on 17 September. Several high-ground positions
 have been occupied and additional government
 units have been flown in. Both sides suffered
 heavy casualties in the final battle; government
 forces lost 58 killed and 137 wounded with 45
 still missing while the enemy had 134 known
 killed and 20 wounded.
 Marcos' recent action will dampen the criticism,
 opposition leaders have been quick to point out
 that the suspension of habeas corpus is still in
 effect in the populous areas of central and eastern
 Luzon, Mindanao, and in other regions in which
 antigovernment dissidence is strong. In particular,
 the writ remains suspended in the Manila area,
 scene of the most active opposition to the Marcos
 regime.

 Korea:  Verbal Sparring
 The preliminary stage of the bilateral talks
 between the North and South Korean Red Cross
 delegations on the problem of divided families
 began on 20 September with both sides jockeying
 to gain the advantage. Pyongyang adopted a con-
 ciliatory tone at the meeting and sought to up-
 stage Seoul by claiming credit for proposing the
 talks. The North Koreans also urged that the talks
 move ahead swiftly and held out the possibility
 that they could soon evolve into full-fledged bi-
 lateral negotiations on the unification of Korea.
 Pyongyang's position is clearly designed to im-
 prove its domestic and international image, spe-
 cifically in anticipation of a discussion of the
 Korean question'at the current session of the UN
 General Assembly.
 Seoul is using the talks as leverage for re-
 questing a postponement of substantive discus-
 sion of the Korean question at the UN lest its
 position suffer from repercussions of the Chinese
 representation debate. At the same time, the
 South Koreans are attempting to prevent the talks
 from moving too rapidly in the direction of politi-
 cal discussion. Speaking at a cabinet interpellation
 on 14 September, Prime Minister Kim Chong-pil
 ruled out any consideration at the talks of na-
 tional unification within the next decade. Under-
 scoring this official view, Seoul has drawn up a
 scenario for spinning out the preliminary stage
 through detailed negotiations on the place, date,
 and agenda for the plenary session. The South
 Koreans did press for a continuation of the pre-
 liminary sessions at the meeting on 20 September,

 Mixed Tidings from Brandt-Brezhnev Meeting
 Chancellor Brandt's visit to the Soviet Union
 on 16-18 September produced no major break-

 frank exchange of views between West German
 and Soviet leaders. The meeting represented an-
 other step toward removing the aura of distrust
 that has surrounded contacts between the two
 countries and thus helped to normalize relations.
 phase Berlin talks must proceed on the basis of an
 agreed German text of the Four-Power accord.
 Thus, a test of wills, similar to that which charac-
 '~erized the earlier Four-Power talks, continues
 between Bonn and Pankow, though the impasse
 will probably be broken eventually.
 Brandt returned generally optimistic about
 Soviet policy toward Western Europe and West
 Germany, but without illusions as to Soviet will-
 ingness to make his task much easier, particularly
 on the inter-German negotiations. Brezhnev de-

 On East-West questions, Brezhnev projected
 an image of flexibility and interest without exert-
 ing any pressure on Brandt. He convinced the
 chancellor that Moscow wants an early confer-
 ence on European security, but agreed with 25X6
 Brandt's wish to drop from the communique the
 phrase "in the near future," which Soviet drafters
 had suggested.
 On the question of mutual and balanced
 force reductions, Brezhnev reiterated the Soviet
 position that the talks should not be limited to
 the US and USSR or to the area of Germany and
 that foreign and indigenous forces should be in-
 cluded-positions generally conforming to
 NATO's. In addition, he made a nod toward
 NATO's concern for "balanced" force reductions
 by saying that, while he objected to "balanced"
 as a NATO word, reductions should be effected
 "without  detriment  to the participants.
 USSR:  Brezhnev Widens His Personal Role
 Following his success last spring at the party
 congress, where he significantly strengthened his
 personal position, General Secretary Brezhnev is
 broadening his role from party boss to that of
 world statesman. In the former role, he dealt
 primarily with the party leaders of other Commu-
 nist countries, generally leaving official Soviet
 contacts with the rest of the world to Premier
 Kosygin and President Podgorny. His talks last
 week with West German Chancellor Brandt and
 his forthcoming trip to Paris mark his emergence
 in his new role for which he has clearly been
 preparing himself.
 Commenting on the meeting, Brandt noted
 signs of Brezhnev's increased self-confidence since
 the chancellor's visit in August 1970. On that
 occasion, Brezhnev had many papers and read
 from them frequently. This time, Brezhnev alone
 saw the chancellor and, in Brandt's view, he went
 out of his way to make the exchange a state-to-
 state and government-to-government one. He dis-
 cussed matters in a more relaxed way and only
 occasionally consulted the few papers that were
 in evidence.
 Soviet press treatment of the Brandt-Brezh-
 nev talks has left no question as to who is in
 charge of this area of the USSR's foreign policy.
 Large front-page pictures and prominent articles
 have emphasized the extent to which Brezhnev
 alone dealt with Brandt. Moreover, Pravda on 18
 September also front-paged a letter from North
 Vietnamese  First Secretary Le Duan thanking
 Brezhnev for a previously unpublished message of
 sympathy on the flood in North Vietnam. Ac-
 cording to Le Duan, the message was sent by
 Brezhnev personally in the name of the party
 central committee and the "Soviet Government."
 The latter is a formulation usually reserved for
 Premier Kosygin or President Podgorny.
 It is a measure of Brezhnev's relative lack of
 firsthand experience with the rest of the world
 that his Paris visit next month will be his first trip
 to a non-Communist country since he became

 Monetary Developments:  Urgent Waiting
 Following the meeting in London last week
 of the Group of Ten, the EC Council again de-
 bated on 20-21 September possible responses to
 the new US economic program. It did not ad-
 vance beyond the community's previous position
 of urging abolition of the US import surcharge as
 a condition for realigning exchange rates. Since
 London and other European capitals generally
 agree with the EC line, little progress is expected
 toward meeting US demands at the sessions this
 weekend of the Ten in Washington or the annual
 IMF meeting that follows immediately.
 At the beginning of the week, reports in the
 German  press that Washington was seeking a
 15-percent revaluation of the mark caused the
 mark to rise sharply against the dollar. Because
 the  Bundesbank  failed to intervene Monday,
 many foreign exchange dealers believed Bonn
 would accept a higher revaluation. The Bundes-
 bank, however, did enter the market Tuesday
 when the effective mark revaluation approached
 10 percent. This was the first intervention by
 Germany's central bank in a month, and it repre-
 sents a decision to hold the effective revaluation
 vis-a-vis the dollar to around 8 percent. Other
 currencies also floated upward: the Belgian "fi-
 nancial" franc for the first time appreciated more
 than 5 percent above its old parity; the Dutch
 guilder was up about 6.25 percent; and the British
 on Premier Kosygin's preserves. Despite the shift
 in their relative roles, however, Brezhnev seems to
 be continuing to operate within the framework of
 collective leadership. For example, he broke off
 his working vacation in the Crimea immediately
 before Brandt's visit there and made a brief trip
 to Moscow, apparently for last-minute consul-
 tations with his colleagues on the Politburo.
 Moreover,  both  Kosygin  and  Podgorny have
 extremely active travel schedules themselves-the
 former to Algeria, Canada, Norway, and Den-
 mark, and the latter to Hanoi and Iran.
 pound rose to about 3.25 percent over the former
 rate. In part, the renewed pressure on the dollar
 reflected the belief that substantial European re-
 valuations  would  be required  before the US
 would agree to any increase in the dollar price of
 gold or remove the 10 percent import surcharge.
 Official and press comments on the London
 session of the Ten have ranged from characteriz-
 ing it as a "dialogue of the deaf" to occasional
 more hopeful analyses. The London Times, for
 example, took heart from the general agreement
 that currencies need realignment and that radical
 remedies are required to restore equilibrium to
 the US balance of payments. The paper also
 noted that no one any longer envisages a huge
 increase in the gold price, adding that multilater-
 alism is not dead when everyone agrees on the
 need for study on the international level of the
 currency realignments necessary to bring about a
 reversal of US deficits. Nevertheless, the political
 drumfire on the US persists. There is evidence
 from discussions in NATO and elsewhere that the
 US program, and specifically the linkage between
 remedying US payments and reducing US military
 expenses in Europe, are detracting from an atti-
 tude of mutual trust likely to be increasingly
 necessary to upcoming discussions on East-West
 issues.

 Within the community, Germany is advocat-

 The French continue privately to underscore the
 "shameful American challenge," as one high Quai
 official termed the new economic program, and
 to lament the strong position vis-a-vis the Euro-

 1967. The only major issue in the two-day elec-

 Italy's New Regional Governments
 Government decentralization is proceeding
 despite  long-standing  concern  that the move
 would improve the Communists' political position
 and increase administrative inefficiency. The new
 regional governments do seem in fact to be adding
 to the Communists' political standing, but the
 party apparently is not operating in an authoritar-
 ian or exclusive manner. The effect of the reform
 on governmental efficiency seems likely to vary
 considerably from one region to another.
 Regional  administrations throughout  the
 country were required by Italy's constitution of
 1947, but their establishment-except in some
 special cases-was long delayed. Assemblies for
 the regions were not elected until May 1970. The
 assemblies then elected regional executives, of
 which  three were Communist or Communist-
 Socialist while the other twelve were centrist,
 often with Christian Democratic leadership.
 All of the new regional assemblies have now
 enacted constitutions, and these have received the
 required endorsement of the national parliament.
 The statutes of the Communist-dominated regions
 show no significant political differences from the
 statutes of non-Communist areas.
 The regions are constitutionally entitled to
 legislative and administrative powers within as yet
 unspecified limits in a number of fields including
 urban  and  rural  police,  agriculture, forestry,
 public welfare, town planning, and public works.
 To assure an orderly transition from national to
 regional authority in these areas, Rome will issue
 decree laws to define boundaries between regional
 and national competence as well as to provide
 essential  central  government coordination and
 supervision. These laws will probably be in effect
 next January, although some may be delayed
 until January 1973.
 Regional leaders are now absorbed in the
 preparation of comments on the initial drafts of
 the decree laws. They have become aware that the
 regions will be better able to deal with Rome if
 they stand together when their interests coincide,
 and they realize also that many seemingly local-
 ized concerns are part of larger problems affecting
 other regions, even distant ones. Consequently,

 Officials of the three Communist-run regions

 They  have  been consulting freely with  non-

 UK-Malta: Deadlock Finally Broken
 After several months of intense negotiations,
 which at times appeared to be at the breaking
 point, the UK and Malta agreed last weekend on
 procedures and a timetable for the negotiation of
 a new defense and financial agreement. The dead-
 lock was broken in talks between Prime Ministers
 Heath and Mintoff in London. The two leaders
 agreed that financial terms should be worked out
 within three months and a detailed agreement
 completed within six months. Mintoff implicitly
 accepted the UK-NATO cash-aid offer, which is
 expected to rise to $24 million, on the under-
 standing that bilateral aid from individual NATO
 countries be negotiated promptly.
 The Maltese leader agreed to lift restrictions
 placed on British forces on the island and to
 restore the previous arrangements, which gave
 London a veto over third-country military use of
 Malta's airfields and harbors. Mintoff made clear,
 however, that his dependence on the West would
 not be as complete as that of the former govern-
 ment. He told Heath that regular visits by the US
 Sixth Fleet would be acceptable, but with the
 clear  understanding  that  "very  occasional"
 courtesy visits by Soviet naval forces would be

 required to maintain Malta's neutrality. Further,
 Mintoff implied that he would agree to the
 establishment of a Soviet Embassy on Malta.
 NATO approved the Heath-Mintoff agree-
 ment on 21 September and has instructed its
 military budget committee to meet as soon as
 possible to work out financial details. The British
 are contributing a little over half of the $24
 million annual package, most of which is in the
 form of a direct cash payment, and have promised
 to pay a portion of the total by 30 September.
 The US, Germany, and Italy are the other major
 contributors,  with  smaller  amounts  expected
 from Belgium, Canada, and Iceland.
 Mintoff is already turning his attention to
 striking the best bargain possible in bilateral aid
 negotiations.  In talks with  Chancellor Brandt
 following his London visit, Mintoff tried without
 success to get Brandt to "quantify" Bonn's bi-
 lateral aid intentions. He also failed to get a
 German commitment to expand its previous offer
 of approximately $7.3 million in technical assist-
 ance plus equipment.

 Denmark:  Election Results Produce no Majority
 To no one's surprise, Denmark's quadrennial
 parliamentary election  on  21 September gave
 neither the incumbent center-right coalition nor
 the chief opposition party a majority in the next
 parliament.
 Jens Otto Krag, head of Denmark's largest
 party,  the Social Democrats, called on Prime
 Minister Baunsgaard to resign and clear the way
 for  Krag to  form  a minority government. A
 former prime minister himself, Krag had said be-
 fore the election that he would form a minority
 government, with the tacit parliamentary support
 of the left-wing Socialist People's Party, if his
 party regained the seven seats it lost in the 1968
 election and if the incumbent coalition lost its
 majority. As it turned out, the Social Democrats
 gained eight seats, for a total of 70 of the 179,
 while the coalition lost its majority, dropping
 from 98 to 88 seats. Krag would have the support
 of two and possibly three of the four representa-
 tives from Greenland and the Faeroe Islands,
 although this will not be confirmed until 5 Octo-
 ber.  With  the tacit support  of the Socialist
 People's Party, which jumped from 11 to 17
 seats, Krag would have the backing of 89 or 90 of
 the 179 deputies.
 Baunsgaard, whose Radical Liberals were the
 only one of the three coalition parties to emerge
 unscathed, has refused to resign pending a re-
 count, but it should not improve his situation.
 Baunsgaard has not been willing to reconstitute
 his coalition as a minority government.
 If Krag forms a minority government, he
 may well find broad support for his domestic
 program, which has not differed markedly from
 the coalition's. On foreign policy, however, he
 may drift somewhat to the left in areas where
 there is some identity of views with the Socialist
 People's Party while seeking to avoid contentious
 issues on which the two parties differ. The gov-
 ernment could pursue a cut in defense spending
 and a retrenchment in the defense establishment,
 and  it may extend diplomatic recognition to
 North Vietnam. But it could decline any initia-
 tives on the divisive issue of Danish entry into the
 European Communities, which will in any event
 be decided next year by popular referendum.
 The  difficulties  facing  a  minority  gov-
 ernment are likely to be so great, however, that
 Krag may call for new elections during 1972. He
 would probably wait until after the referendum
 on the EC so as to keep this question out of the

 MIDDLE EAST-AFRICA
 India: Mrs. Gandhi Tightens the Reins
 Prime Minister Gandhi's dominance over her
 Ruling Congress Party is becoming more ap-
 parent. In the six months since she led her party
 to an overwhelming victory in national elections,
 she has made several bold moves that highlight
 her growing political power.
 Last July, she forced the resignation of
 Mohan Lai Sukhadia, chief minister of the pre-
 dominantly Hindu northern state of Rajasthan.
 Sukhadia had held the state's top political office
 for 17 years and, until Mrs Gandhi's low-key but
 relentless attack against him began, his position
 seemed inviolate because he appeared to possess
 an independent political base. Sukhadia was re-
 placed by Barkatullah Khan, a Muslim who owes
 his new job to no one but Mrs. Gandhi. Earlier
 this month, Mrs. Gandhi moved against Brahman-
 anda Reddi, chief minister of the southern state
 of Andhra Pradesh, whose domination of local
 politics had made him one of the most powerful
 figures in the Ruling Congress Party. Reddi's suc-
 cessor has yet to be named, but Mrs. Gandhi has
 made it clear that she will do the choosing.
 With Reddi's fall, pundits in New Delhi are
 openly  speculating about the prospects of
 Maharashtra State's chief minister, V. P. Naik, a
 member of Finance Minister Y. B. Chavan's inner
 circle. Chavan was Maharashtra's chief minister
 until he left some years ago to accept a position
 in Mrs. Gandhi's cabinet. The prime minister
 probably sees Chavan as her greatest potential
 rival for power, and has long been interested in
 eroding his support.
 Although all four men declared their al-
 legiance to Mrs. Gandhi when the Congress Party
 split in 1969, they were all ranged against her in
 various degrees before the split and mutual trust
 has never been high. With the two dismissals, Mrs.
 Gandhi will gain a free hand to ensure that candi-
 dates of her choice are nominated by the local
 Ruling Congress to represent the party in state
 electoral contests, scheduled to take place by
 March 1972.
 The two high-level dismissals, together with
 other local Ruling Congress purges, have stimu-

 Pakistan:  Bleak Prospects for Reconciliation
 President Yahya Khan continues to take
 steps ostensibly aimed at improving the domestic
 political  situation  but probably designed  pri-
 marily to assuage international criticism of his
 government. His recent efforts are unlikely to
 improve relations between Pakistan's two wings.
 In East Pakistan, a civilian cabinet was ap-
 pointed on 17 September by A. M. Malik, the
 civilian  provincial governor named earlier this
 month to replace an unpopular West Pakistani
 general. Malik and his cabinet ministers all are
 East Pakistanis, but he shares his authority with a
 West Pakistani general who holds the post of
 Adding to
 Malik's-and Yahya's-problem is the suspicion
 with which army leaders in the East regard any
 move toward civilian government.

 government disqualified a majority of Awami
 Leaguers who had been elected to the national
 and provincial assemblies. The large number of
 disqualifications,  together with the likelihood
 that many of the "acceptable" legislators prob-
 ably will decline to take their seats, will dilute
 whatever legitimacy these assemblies might have
 had in the eyes of the East Pakistanis. Addition-
 ally, there is considerable doubt that government
 forces will be able to remove the threat of guer-
 rilla actions before the poll.
 In a measure aimed at increasing civilian
 participation on the national level, Yahya has
 agreed that the new constitution to be drawn up
 by his government will be submitted to the na-
 tional assembly for its consideration before being
 proclaimed by the executive branch. The assem-
 bly will have 90 days to suggest revisions; Yahya
 retains the power to veto any recommended

 dealings with the Bengalis.
 Another action taken by Yahya earlier this
 month-the announcement of an amnesty for
 most East Pakistani insurgents-does not appear
 to have made much of an impression so far on the
 Bengalis; the latest measures will not do much
 either to lessen their hostility toward Islamabad.
 Bengali leaders have indicated that as long as
 Awami League chief Mujibur Rahman remains
 imprisoned, they will not respond favorably to
 Yahya's political moves. Mujib is currently being
 tried in secret for treason before a military tribu-
 nal, and is expected to be found guilty and pos-

 reviewed by Yahya, whose decision to uphold or
 commute it could indicate whether he intends to
 pursue a hard or a conciliatory line in future

 Egypt-Israel: All Quiet on the Canal
 There have been no further incidents along
 the Suez Canal following the Israeli air strikes on
 18 September. The sequence of events that led to
 the Israeli action began on 11 September when
 the Israelis shot down an Egyptian SU-7 conduct-
 ing low-level reconnaissance of Israeli positions
 along the canal.
 The Egyptians retaliated for the loss of the
 SU-7 on 17 September when they used missiles to
 shoot down an Israeli C-97 which, according to
 the Israelis, was flying "well on the east side of
 the canal." Seven of the eight Israeli crewmen
 were killed. Because the plane was over Israeli
 territory and unarmed, an Israeli response was
 almost guaranteed. The following day, the Israelis
 responded with air strikes at Egyptian SAM sites
 along the canal. Israeli aircraft first flew along the
 canal to induce radar emissions from seven pre-
 selected sites between Ismailia and Suez City.
 Then eight Israeli Phantoms launched a total of
 12 Shrike missiles at the targets from the Israeli
 side of the canal. None of the Shrikes hit the
 targets, however, and all seven sites were still
 operational when the Israeli planes left the area.
 The Egyptians launched missiles at the Israeli
 planes during the attack, but the Israelis were out
 of range and no missile came close.
 The Israelis probably regard their action,
 even though not a success, as a sufficient warning
 to the Egyptians of Israel's intention to respond
 forcefully to future Egyptian acts against Israeli
 forces. The Egyptians have claimed that they suf-
 fered no losses as a result of the Israeli action,
 indicating that they are probably willing to regard
 the events of last week as a closed chapter.
 Neither the Egyptians nor the Israelis appear
 to desire an escalation of the fighting in the near
 future. The recent events, however, have illus-
 trated the basic fragility of the present cease-fire
 and the way in which military action by either
 side is likely to provoke reactions.

 Egypt: Sadat Speaks Out
 President Sadat's words and actions during
 the past week reflect his determination to focus
 international attention on the Middle East and to
 put his personal stamp on the restructuring of the
 Egyptian state.
 In a nationwide address on 16 September,
 Sadat took the US to task for its "failure" to
 define its own position on a settlement of the
 Middle East dispute. Although he claimed that
 the Americans had given up their role as "mail-
 man" between Egypt and Israel and that they had
 even misrepresented the positions of the dis-
 putants, Sadat stopped short of denouncing US
 mediation efforts. Instead, he called for a UN
 Security Council session at some unspecified time
 so  that  the  international  community  could
 "shoulder its responsibility" toward the Middle
 East. By using these tactics, Sadat seemed intent
 both on goading the US into wringing concessions
 from the Israelis and on refocusing international
 attention on the continued deadlock in the talks.
 He no doubt views the shootdown of the Egyp-
 tian SU-11 and the Israeli C-97 in the past two
 weeks as having the merit of reminding Washing-
 ton of the fragility of the cease-fire and the
 dangers inherent in the protracted diplomatic im-
 passe.
 Although foreign policy overshadowed the
 domestic aspects of Sadat's speech, he did outline
 plans for a broad reorganization of the state ap-
 Page 19
 paratus and the economy. The central theme of
 this portion of his address was that the reforms
 were not ends in themselves but were instead
 necessary in order to build a new domestic foun-
 dation for the "battle."
 Among the significant specifics of his action
 program, Sadat has directed the simplification of
 the cumbersome bureaucratic processes that have
 hampered expansion of industrial  production.
 New legislation will provide for tighter guarantees
 to foreign investors and for the creation of indus-
 trial "free zones" where customary trade restric-
 tions will be waived to facilitate the formation of
 new export industries.
 The first step in government reorganization
 was taken on  19 September when Sadat ap-
 pointed a new, modified cabinet. Although the
 key members were retained, several ministries
 were abolished and two new ones-war produc-
 tion and maritime transport-were created.
 Sadat has portrayed Egypt's new constitu-
 tion, which came into force on 11 September, as
 his administration's blueprint for the building of a
 modern industrial society. Since dismissing those
 who shared power with him last May, Sadat has
 given high priority to the reshaping of govern-
 mental, political,   and economic institutions.

 .7.Gljlt.r, I
 Yemen (Sana) : A New Cabinet
 Muhsin al-Ayni, 39-year-old diplomat and
 politician, accepted the premiership and ap-
 pointed a cabinet late last week. The cabinet,
 with its many old faces, is composed of both
 right- and left-wingers. The naming of military
 officers as deputy premier and as ministers of
 interior and communications reflects the army's
 key role in national politics.
 In addition to the post of premier, al-Ayni
 has also assumed direction of foreign affairs. The
 previous holder of the portfolio was an Adeni
 whose appointment had been interpreted as sig-
 naling stepped-up assistance for Adeni dissidents
 operating out of Yemen with Saudi Arabian back-
 ing. Although al-Ayni is known to oppose the
 radical government in Southern Yemen, his in-
 Malagasy Republic: Tsiranana Rides High
 President Tsiranana's pre-eminence was reaf-
 firmed at the conference of the ruling Social
 Democratic Party earlier this month. In a care-
 fully manipulated vote, Tsiranana was designated,
 without opposition, as the party's presidential
 candidate for the national election scheduled for
 early 1972. He also solidified his control over the
 party's executive body, renamed the political
 bureau, and apparently became party chief for
 life. Moreover, the President downgraded the post
 of party secretary general, last held by discredited
 former vice president Resampa. Resampa, before
 his downfall, was Tsiranana's heir apparent and a
 potential rival. According to a new party statute,
 Tsiranana will appoint the secretary general an-
 nually from among the members of the political
 bureau, who are also appointed by the President.
 tentions toward it. have not yet been spelled out.
 In the past, he has supported the idea of a
 "Greater Yemen,"but it is likely that he will be
 less intransigent toward the Aden regime than his
 predecessor, who favored a military solution. Al-
 Ayni has re-established a Ministry for Unity Af-
 fairs, which may indicate that he intends to
 launch a propaganda campaign in favor of uniting
 the two Yemens.
 In an interview, al-Ayni declared that posi-
 tive neutrality and nonalignment would charac-
 terize Sana's foreign policy. Although this may be
 rhetoric, it could also signify hesitancy about
 resumption of relations with the US.
 Tsiranana's Tsiranana's renomination means his almost
 certain re-election to the presidency. The gov-
 ernment's prestige was badly damaged by a
 bloody uprising last year in the southern part of
 the island and by the detention of Resampa for
 alleged coup plotting. Tsiranana, however, has
 recently made an effort to soften the effects of
 these events with a series of country-wide per-
 sonal appearances. His opposition in the election
 will be modest at best; the main opposing party,
 which won only three of the 107 seats at stake in
 the last legislative election, has so far failed to
 nominate a presidential candidate.
 Tsiranana may have more in mind than just
 another seven-year term. According to rumors

 circulating in Tananarive, he may be planning to
 become president for life. Tsiranana was ap-
 parently impressed by the election of President
 Banda of Malawi to a life-long term last July. It
 has also been rumored that Tsiranana may call for
 immediate elections, instead of waiting until 1972
 as scheduled. Such a move would be uncon-
 stitutional, but this factor would probably not
 dissuade the mercurial Tsiranana, who advanced
 the date of the 1965 presidential elections.
 The party conference also endorsed Tsir-
 anana's policy of developing closer ties to South
 Africa. Relations between the two countries were
 put on a more formal footing last month with the
 establishment of a joint commission that will ex-
 amine, among other things, customs problems,
 trade, and technical assistance. The party's en-
 dorsement increases chances that Tananarive may
 establish diplomatic relations with South Africa, a
 move  the Malagasy Government has recently
 hinted it is considering.
 Ethiopia-Japan: Growing Economic Ties
 Ethiopian economic relations with Japan
 have grown substantially. Tokyo has found an
 enthusiastic trade partner in Addis Ababa and
 Ethiopia has been host to numbers of Japanese
 missions searching for export markets, investment
 opportunities, and sources of raw materials.
 A number of Japanese-financed factories
 have opened during the past year and imports
 from Japan increased by more than 50 percent in
 1970 to $25 million. Japan's climb to second
 place as supplier of imports has been at the ex-
 pense chiefly of the US, UK, and France, all of
 whom suffered an absolute decline in exports to
 Ethiopia last year.
 Exports to Japan-primarily coffee-are in-
 creasing rapidly but are still overshadowed by
 imports, which last year were almost four times
 the value of sales. While Addis Ababa has sought
 out Japanese industrial projects that reduce its
 needs for imports, these have frequently led to
 high-cost production. The cost of products from
 recently inaugurated factories producing garments
 and steel pipe, for example, will be higher than
 previous imports. Furthermore, Ethiopia is pro-
 curing only one Japanese factory-a meat-process-
 ing plant-that is designed to spur exports.
 Earlier this year, Japan attended for the first
 time the meeting of the international consortium
 providing aid for Ethiopia. Ethiopia may hope
 that Japan will provide sufficient aid to coun-
 terbalance any reduction from the US, currently
 the chief donor. Addis Ababa is trying to step up
 implementation of an already much-delayed de-
 velopment program. The current budget places
 heavy emphasis on development expenditures,
 with more than half the capital outlays ex ected
 to come from foreign borrowin .

 Breakup of East African Community Seems Possible
 The four-year-old East African Community
 is threatened by the political tensions that have
 arisen between Tanzania and Uganda since the
 coup in Kampala last January. Despite some bene-
 ficial developments, the community has not fos-
 tered the hoped-for regional unity and its breakup
 would not be deeply felt, especially since most
 present common services could probably be sal-
 vaged.
 The community's operations-common eco-
 nomic and communications services for these two
 countries and Kenya-are stymied by Tanzania's
 refusal to recognize the new Uganda Government.
 This blocks any meeting of the community's
 governing authority, consisting of the three heads
 of state, which must approve major decisions. At
 present, only routine business is conducted, and
 continuity is maintained through informal con-
 tact by lesser officials. A number of important
 fiscal and administrative matters need to be unre-
 solved, however.
 Since its inception, the hoped-for regional
 unity of the grouping has been impaired by ret-
 rogressive  measures  and  petty jealousies:  the
 demise of a single east African currency, the
 creation of competing industries, the imposition
 of  exchange  controls,  and the restriction of
 worker  movement. Furthermore, economically
 advanced Kenya is restive over being "held back"
 in favor of the others, while Uganda and Tanzania
 feel that Kenya's industrial economy has grown
 largely because of its unrestricted access to their
 markets.
 Nevertheless, the community has been mutu-
 ally beneficial in some aspects. East African trade
 with the world, conducted largely under a com-
 mon external tariff, has expanded rapidly in re-
 cent years. With a market of about 35 million
 people having an income of about $3 billion an-
 nually-relatively high by African standards-the
 community provides one of the most attractive
 markets in Africa to foreign investors and credi-
 tors. In practice, however, most of the industry
 has gone to Kenya, by far the most receptive to
 foreign capital.
 Some worth-while features of the commu-
 nity  probably could  be salvaged  should  it
 break up. The free trade area and the four present
 East African corporations-originally established
 by the UK to handle railways, harbors, telecom-
 munications, and postal services-probably would
 be maintained. Moreover, the close economic rela-
 tionship between Kenya and Uganda would prob-
 ably survive because Kampala is dependent on
 overland transport routes via Kenya for its ex-
 ports and imports. Tanzania, because of its lim-
 ited resource base, would suffer most, offering
 further  openings  for the Chinese Commu-
 nists.

 Brazilian Extremists Dealt New Blows
 During the past two weeks, radical oppo-
 nents of the Medici government have lost a top
 terrorist leader and have seen several priests sen-
 tenced to prison on charges of aiding subversives.
 On 17 September, military and civilian secu-
 rity forces located and killed renegade army Cap-
 tain Carlos Lamarca and a companion, culminat-
 ing an extensive manhunt in the northeastern
 state of Bahia. The 33-year-old Larnarca had
 become the central figure in the terrorist move-
 ment since his desertion from the army in early
 1969. Under his leadership, the Popular Revolu-
 tionary Vanguard carried out extensive operations
 in urban centers, including bombings, bank rob-
 beries, and three of the four kidnapings of foreign
 diplomats. Unrelenting pursuit by security forces
 beginning in  late  1969 cut deeply into his
 strength, however, resulting in dissension within
 the group that apparently caused Lamarca to
 leave it in March 1971.
 Lamarca and several followers went to the
 hinterlands of Bahia in late July to prepare for
 rural  guerrilla  activities,  but  the  authorities
 learned of his presence before he was able to gain
 significant support among the populace. His en-
 trapment demonstrates anew the hazards that
 face Brazilian terrorists who attempt to shift their
 operations from a known urban environment to
 an unfamiliar rural one. Lamarca was the last
 active figure in the circle of terrorist leaders who
 once headed the several groups that advocate vio-
 lence against the government; his loss will be a
 severe psychological blow to the subversives. It
 may force them to adopt less visible, and there-
 fore less vulnerable, methods of operation. These
 would also be less effective.
 25X1
 Another setback to the extremists was the
 conviction on 14 September in a Sao Paulo mil-
 itary court of four priests charged with violating
 national security laws by collaborating with the
 National  Liberating  Action  group  of  Carlos
 Marighella,  Lamarca's predecessor as principal
 terrorist leader.
 Although their prolonged
 detention without trial has been the subject of
 frequent  protests,  church officials apparently
 were satisfied with the four-year sentences meted
 out to the three defendants who faced the most
 serious charges; a fourth defendant received a
 six-month term, while eleven others were ac-
 quitted.
 The hierarchy's restrained reaction to the convic-
 tions may warn the small number of radical
 clerics that they can expect little assistance from
 ranking church leaders if they become involved

 Argentina: Election Date Set
 President Lanusse's announcement that na-
 tional elections will be held on 25 March 1973
 may have been prompted by the rising level of
 civil unrest and the notable increase in rumors of
 military  plotting.  The announcement of elec-
 tions-the first for president since 1963 and the
 first for congress since 1965-was made nearly a
 month earlier than originally planned with the
 apparent intention of sidetracking or pacifying
 Lanusse's critics.
 The  rumors  of  military  plotting against
 Lanusse that have circulated widely in Buenos
 Aires are to some extent a reflection of dissatis-
 faction with the President's policy of accom-
 modation with the Peronists and his failure to
 deal with the nation's serious economic problems.
 The unrest at this time, however, may be more
 directly attributed to the confusion and appre-
 hension over army promotions and assignments,
 which reportedly are being made early this year.
 Lanusse reportedly is in the process of moving his
 most loyal military supporters into key troop
 commands to frustrate any coup plotting, and
 many officers are angered over the favoritism
 being shown presidential "cronies."
 Business and labor groups are agitated over
 the President's failure to deal effectively with the
 sagging economy and spiraling inflation. Lanusse
 must have the support of the large and well-
 HONDURAS:  Tottering  President  Cruz  has
 gained a temporary respite from the disorders
 threatening his "unity" government. Bombings
 have tapered off over the past two weeks, and bad
 weather has apparently dampened student enthu-
 siasm  for demonstrations. The last significant
 bombing occurred on 14 September when ex-
 organized Peronist labor movement if he is to be
 successful in returning Argentina to elected gov-
 ernment.  Moderate labor leaders are generally
 satisfied with the President's performance so far,
 but pressure from more radical groups has forced
 the moderates to make a show of opposition to
 the government's economic policies. The national
 leadership was able to outmaneuver the radicals,
 who were calling or a series of active nationwide
 general strikes, but only by calling for a "passive"
 general strike on 29 September. Any overreaction
 by security forces during the strike would cost
 Lanusse heavily in political terms, but, in any
 case, it is becoming obvious that he must soon
 show some success on the economic front or risk
 losing all the political gains he has made since
 coming to power six months ago.
 With the announcement of an election date,
 President Lanusse retains the political initiative
 and demonstrates the political astuteness that has
 served him well thus far. The announcement has
 been generally well received by the public and
 should  reduce the threat of a military coup,
 which  now would  be  interpreted  as a move
 against the expression of the popular will at the
 polls. Similarly, it should temporarily quiet the
 President's civilian critics and give the government
 more  time  to devise a  new  economic   ro

 Peru:
 Strike Increases Influence of Communists
 The recent nationwide teachers' strike has
 increased the influence of the pro-Moscow Com-
 munist labor federation (CGTP) at the expense of
 the more moderate APRA labor leaders and of
 the extreme leftists in the labor movement.
 The military government in recent months
 has displayed an ambivalent attitude toward the
 CGTP. Since coming to power in 1968, it has
 looked on the confederation as a means of de-
 stroying  the  labor  federation  controlled  by
 APRA, with which the army has been at odds
 since the 1930s. For a while last month, the
 administration seemed to be moving toward an
 open crackdown on the CGTP's sponsorship of
 labor stoppages, especially those at government-
 controlled  installations.  The  government  de-
 nounced agitators of both the extreme right and
 the extreme left, and President Velasco, while
 blaming rightists for the government's problems,
 said that the Communists had become unwitting
 tools of the right.
 The CGTP, having gained influence in the
 labor movement by associating itself from the
 URUGUAY: The campaign for the November
 presidential elections is proceeding apace, with all
 three parties able to point to some recent prog-
 ress.                   In the incumbent Colorado Party, Jorge
 Battle has emerged from internal party elections
 as a likely-and strong-contender for the presi-
 dency,  along with the several other Colorado
 candidates allowed to run under Uruguay's com-
 plicated electoral system. If the Colorados are
 able to attract the law-and-order vote via Presi-
 dent Pacheco's renomination and field several
 other attractive candidates as well, they will be
 favored to retain the presidency. The campaign of
 the principal Blanco candidate, Ferreira Aldunate,
 beginning of the strike with the teachers and their
 legitimate grievances, began working behind the
 scenes for acceptance of the government's com-
 promise  offer.  As  a  result,  the  government
 charged APRA and the "ultraleft," but not the
 CGTP, with attempting to manipulate the strike
 for  "partisan and counterrevolutionary" pur-
 poses. The APRA federation jumped on the
 teachers' bandwagon only after the strike was
 under way, but it was Apristas and members of
 extremist splinter groups who were arrested on 13
 September for counterrevolutionary activities.
 The government apparently hopes to break
 the back of APRA, which has had strong labor
 support, then turn its attention to the Commu-
 nists if necessary. The willingness of the leaders of
 the CGTP to cooperate with the Velasco regime
 will encourage this attitude. New troubles could
 develop, however, if the government goes through
 with its plan to impose a new law removing the
 trade union movement from politics. Such a law
 could  bring  a  direct confrontation with  the
 CGTP, with possibly serious consequences for the
 already fragile economy.

 F       Security Council Takes up Jerusalem
 As of noon on 23 September, the Security
 Council had yet to resume last week's two-day
 debate on Israeli actions in Jerusalem. Continuing
 intra-Arab disagreement over the terms of a draft
 resolution has held up reconvening of the council.
 The Arab discord that has surfaced in New
 York reflects the long-standing dissatisfaction of
 some of the more radical states, led by Syria, with
 Jordan's desire to work out a resolution that
 would be palatable to the US. Syria took a tough
 stance against Amman's position at the meeting
 on 11-12 September of Arab League foreign min-
 isters and wanted an indefinite postponement of
 any council debate. Jordan pushed ahead, how-
 ever, because it hoped that its scenario fora quick
 vote in the council could still be achieved. Am-
 man also could hardly have afforded to back
 down on a matter it regarded as vital and on
 which  so  much diplomatic capital  had been
 expended during the summer months.
 Debate  speeches have covered the usual
 gamut of charges and countercharges. The ten
 Arab statements have all played on the theme
 that Israel is "bent on Judaizing Jerusalem" and is
 thus violating the UN Charter and numerous
 resolutions. Israeli replies have focused on the
 alleged Jordanian trampling on the rights of Jews
 in Jerusalem during the 1948-67 period and have
 accused Amman of using the Jerusalem issue to
 divert attention from its problems with the other
 Arab states.
 Soon after the council convened last week,
 the Syrians offered to the Arab group an alterna-
 tive text that would have sent a council mission
 to Jerusalem and have required it to report back
 within 15 days. The draft also cited the possible
 need for UN sanctions against Israel. The Soviets
 favor such language, largely because they want
 any mission to be under the auspices of the coun-
 cil rather than the secretariat.
 Reacting to the Syrian move, the Jordanians
 have consulted intensively within the Arab group
 on alterations of the text agreed to between Am-
 man and Washington. Jordan now maintains that
 Syrian UN delegate Tomeh has given "his word"
 to support an amended draft that would not refer
 to UN sanctions or use the formula for a Security
 Council mission. Should the original Jordanian-
 US text be presented, Syria probably will offer a
 number of amendments.
 The upshot of these developments, com-
 bined with the presence in New York of many
 foreign ministers from the states concerned, is to
 upgrade the significance of any council vote that
 may F.
 Africans Gird for Major Initiatives
 The Africans have obtained a special high-
 level meeting of the Security Council for next
 week to consider South Africa's continuing asser-
 tion of hegemony over South-West Africa. The
 session should be the high point of African efforts

 at the UN this fall, which will also focus on the
 Portuguese territories and the Middle East situa-
 tion. The activism of the Africans contrasts
 sharply with their relative stand-down at the UN
 last year and denotes their increasing frustration
 on anticolonial issues, something that OAU Chair-
 man Quid Daddah is certain to stress next week.
 Impetus for the council meeting on South-
 West Africa was provided by the International
 Court of Justice in June, when it issued an ad-
 visory opinion upholding the action of the Gen-
 eral  Assembly in  1966 terminating Pretoria's
 mandate over the territory. Ould Daddah will
 make the principal speech before the council, and
 five OAU foreign ministers are also scheduled to
 make statements. The council's ad hoc committee
 on South-West Africa is drafting a report for
 council consideration, and the Africans appear
 inclined to push for a text that would call for UN
 sanctions against South Africa should it-as is
 certain-fail  to  withdraw  from  the territory.
 Another reference unpalatable to the West would
 provide  a  controversial  interpretation  of the
 council's arms embargo against Pretoria.
 The Africans have been angling for years to
 have the General Assembly designate delegates of
 the national liberation movements for the un-
 represented Portuguese territories in the Addis
 Ababa - based  UN  Economic Commission for
 Africa (ECA). The assembly is slated to vote this
 fall on the issue, as all Western attempts so far to
 defer the matter have failed. The Africans may
 well have the votes needed to secure the designa-
 tions to the ECA. If successful, this could spark
 similar moves on  behalf of dissident groups
 elsewhere.
 Rhodesia has been a focal point of African
 concern for years, but the Africans have not
 indicated that they have any new moves in mind
 regarding Salisbury.
 The OAU is sending a special committee of
 self-designated "wise men" to Cairo and Tel Aviv
 in early November to look into prospects for a
 settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Last fall,
 African support greatly aided the Arabs in rolling
 up a 57-16 majority in the assembly for a con-
 tentious resolution strongly opposed by the US
 and Israel. The Arabs have indicated they are
 willing to await the conclusion of the OAU mis-
 sion before commencing this year's assembly
 debate on the Middle East. The Israelis hope to
 persuade the OAU mission to favor a more bal-
 anced text.
 The meeting of the Commission on Narcotic
 Drugs of the UN Economic and Social Council,
 which opens next week, could eventually lead to
 a considerable stiffening of international legisla-
 tion to deal with drug traffic. The US hopes to
 use the session to obtain more support for amend-
 ing the 1961 convention to provide mandatory
 powers for the International Narcotics Control
 Board, which presently can only call for volun-
 tary compliance with the convention. The en-
 forcement amendments, about which many coun-
 tries have reservations, are to be considered
 formally at a high-level diplomatic conference
 next year. The UN Drug Commission meeting is
 also likely to produce greater adherence to the
 recently completed convention on psychotropic
 (mind-bending) substances, which permits cov-
 erage  of  the  LSD  problem  for  the  first
 time.
