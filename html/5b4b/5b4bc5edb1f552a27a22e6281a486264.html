 THE WORLD SITUATION
 I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THE OVERSIMPLIFIED AP-
 PROACH THAT COMMUNISM IS AT THE ROOT OF ALL OF THE
 PROBLEMS THE UNITED STATES FACES IN THE WORLD TODAY
 FOR ONE THING. THERE ARE TODAY A GROWING VARIETY OF
 COMMUNISMS WHICH MAKE SUCH A WHOLESALE, MEAT-AXE AP-
 PROACH MISLEADING IF NOT DANGEROUS   FOR ANOTHER,
 WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS SO THAT IN SOME OF THEM--
 NIGERIA. OR CYPRUS. OR PERU, TO CITE A FEW--COMMU-
 NISM HAS PLAYED ONLY A MINOR PART. IF ANY AT ALL,
 BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO THE
 MAJOR CHALLENGE TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.
 YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOVIET RUSSIA, AND COMMUNIST
 CHINA, THE MEN WHO RUN THESE COUNTRIES. THE OBJEC-
 TIVES THEY PURSUE, AND THE ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL
 POWER THEY CAN BRING TO BEAR AGAINST US.
 I PROPOSE. THEN, TO START WITH A DISCUSSION OF
 THE POSTURE AND POLICIES OF THE USSR AND COMMUNIST
 CHINA. AFTER WHICH I WILL TAKE UP THE ACTIVITIES OF
 THE SOVIET. THE CHINESE. AND THE CUBAN COMMUNISTS
 IN AFRICA AND IN LATIN AMERICA. THEN THE MIDDLE
 EASTERN SITUATION, AND FINALLY THE WAR IN VIETNAM

 THE SOVIET UNION
 THIS PAST SUMMER, THE SOVIET UNION PASSED A
 BENCH-MARK IN THE MILITARY RIVALRY BETWEEN EAST
 AND WEST, t~JHEN IT MATCHED THE UNITED STATES IN
 NUMBERS OF OPERATIONAL LAND-BASED INTERCONTINENTAL
 BALLISTIC MISSILES
 THIS WAS A GOAL THE SOVIET LEADERS HAD SET FOR
 THEMSELVES EARLY IN THIS DECADE OF THE SIXTIES. AT
 A TIME WHEN U.S. SUPERIORITY IN STRATEGIC DELIVERY
 SYSTEMS LEFT THE SOVIET UNION AT A MILITARY. POLITI-
 CAL. AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISADVANTAGE
 IT CAN. OF COURSE. BE ARGUED THAT THE SOVIETS
 STILL LAG IN STRATEGIC OFFENSE. BECAUSE THEIR MANNED
 BOMBER FORCE IS FAR INFERIOR TO OURS, AND BECAUSE
 IT WILL TAKE THEM ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR YEARS TO
 MATCH OUR POLARIS PUNCH IN SUBMARINE BALLISTIC MIS-
 SILES
 P~EVERTHELESS, AS THE SOVIETS FORGED AHEAD IN
 THE ICBM COUNT, THEY UNDOUBTEDLY FELT THAT THEY HAD
 ARRIVED AT THE STAGE KNOWN AS AN NSSURED DESTRUC-
 TION CAPABILITY--THAT THEORETICAL STATUS IN WHICH
 A NATIONS STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE SYSTEMS CAN ABSORB
 AN INITIAL ATTACK. AND STILL RETALIATE WITH SUFFI-

 PEOPLE. THE FORCES. AND THE RESOURCES OF THE AT-
 TACKER,  IF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION
 EACH HAVE THIS CAPABILITY. IN THE CONCEPT OF MUTUAL
 DETERRENCE IT BECOMES ACADEMIC TO ARGUE ABOUT THE
 FINER  POINTS  OF ti.411 MUCH  STRATEGIC OFFENSE EACH
 SIDE HAS,
 THE SOVIET LEADERS. THEN. HAVE BEEN PLAYING NU-
 MERICAL CATCH-UP IN THEIR MILITARY PLANNING THROUGH
 THE SIXTIES. BUT THEY FACE DIFFICULT AND SIGNIFI-
 CANT DECISIONS FOR THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES,
 EVEN AS THE SOVIETS PULL AHEAD IN NUMBERS OF
 ICBMs. AND INVEST HEAVILY IN MISSILE SUBMARINE CON-
 STRUCTION. THE UNITED STATES HAS BEGUN THE MINUTEMAN
 THREE AND POSEIDON PROGRAMS. WHICH WILL MORE THAN
 DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF RE-ENTRY VEHICLES AND WARHEADS
 THAT COULD BE USED AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION,  WE ARE
 DEPLOYING SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS THAT CAN OVERWHELM
 OR PENETRATE THE LIMITED CAPABILITIES OF THE ABM SYS-
 TEM THE SOVIETS ARE BUILDING AROUND MOSCOW,  WE ARE
 BEGINNING TO ESTABLISH A FAR MORE MODERN ABM SYSTEM
 OF OUR OWN,
 THUS THE SOVIETS ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE NEED
 FOR NEW DECISIONS ON THE FUTURE SIZE AND COMPOSITION
 OF THEIR OWN STRATEGIC FORCES,

 A CONTINUED INCREASE IN THE SHEER AIUMBERS OF
 THEIR PRESENT WEAPONS WOULD MAINTAIN A MEASURE OF
 MUTUAL DETERRENCE. BUT IT WOULD OFFER LITTLE IMPROVE-
 MENT BEYOND THEIR PRESENT LEVEL
 WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE WORKING HARD FOR QUALITA-
 TIVE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR STRATEGIC SYSTEMS   THEY
 ARE TESTING NEW ELEMENTS FOR DEFENSE AGAINST BALLIS-
 TIC MISSILES   THEY ARE DEVELOPING MULTIPLE RE-ENTRY
 VEHICLES FOR THEIR ICBP1 WARHEADS. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE
 AS YET SHOWN NO CAPABILITY FOR MULTIPLE WARHEADS
 WHICH CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY TARGETED. LIKE OUR MINUTE-
 MAN THREE AND POSEIDON
 THESE QUALITATIVE ADVANCES COME HARD. AND THE NEW
 ADVANCED WEAPONS ARE EXPENSIVE--PARTICULARLY FOR THE
 SOVIET UNION   ADVANCED WEAPONS PROGRAMS DRAW HEAVILY
 ON JUST THOSE HIGH-QUALITY RESOURCES IN MEN, MATERIAL.
 AND PLANT WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY IN THE SOVIET
 UNION, AND ARE BADLY NEEDED TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC GROWTH
 AND TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF LIVIN G
 ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS ALMOST CERTAINLY WERE
 AMONG THE PRINCIPAL REASONS FOR THE SOVIET DECISION
 MORE THAN A YEAR AGO TO TAKE UP THE U.S. OFFER TO
 DISCUSS THE LIMITATION OF STRATEGIC ARMS   WE KNOW
 THAT THIS DECISION CREATED FRICTION IN THE SOVIET

 LEADERSHIP, BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL SIGNS OF UNHAP-
 PINESS IN SOVIET MILITARY JOURNALS AND IN ARTICLES
 BY MILITARY LEADERS   WHATEVER THE COURSE OF THE
 ARMS LIMITATION TALKS. THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO CON-
 TINUE TO CAUSE STRAINS IN THE MOSCOW POWER STRUCTURE
 IT WOULD BE WELL. THEN. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE
 NATURE AND THE POLICIES OF THE PRESENT SOVIET LEAD-

 THE ELEVEN MEN WHO MAKE UP THE CURRENT POLIT-

 POWER FROM KHRUSHCHEV IN REACTION TO HIS MERCURIAL
 ADVENTURES: AND AS A RESULT THEY ARE PUBLICLY COM-
 MITTED AGAINST A REVERSION TO ONE-MAN RULE IN RUSSIA
 THIS IS A COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP. AND IT INTENDS
 TO REMAIN ONE,  SOME OF ITS MEMBERS--BREZHNEV IN
 PARTICULAR--ARE "MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS.~~ AS ORWELL
 PUT IT.  IN OUR ANALYSIS. HOWEVER. ALL OF THEIR DE-
 CISIONS SINCE KHRUSHCHEV WAS DEPOSED FIVE YEARS AGO
 HAVE PROBAB LY REFLECTED A CONSENSUS OF AT LEAST THE
 FOUR MEN WHO FORM THE INNER CIRCLE: THE PARTY BOSS.

 THE LEADERSHIP HAS FACED UP ONLY TO ONE HARD
 DECISION: THE INTERVENTION IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA,  THE
 RECORD IN 1968 WAS ONE OF HESITANCY AND TEMPORIZING
 FROM THE BEGINNING OF DUBCEK~S REFORM PROGRAM IN
 .JANUARY UNTIL THE ACTUAL INVASION IN AUGUST,  WHILE
 WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE POLITBURO WAS ALIGNED
 FOR AND AGAINST INTERVENTION. THE FRICTION WAS UN-
 DOUBTEDLY THERE. AND HAS BEEN REFLECTED--EVEN AFTER
 THE INVASION--IN THE CONTINUED PULLING AND HAULING
 ABOUT HOW TO GET THE CZECHS BACK ON THE MOSCOW PARTY
 LINE,
 THESE SOVIET LEADERS ARE ORGANIZATION MEN. UN-
 COMFORTABLE WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE UNFAMILIAR AND
 THE UNEXPECTED,  THEY CONSORT TOGETHER AS MUCH FOR
 MUTUAL SAFETY AS FOR UNITY,
 IN .JULY 1968, FOR EXAMPLE, THE WORLD WAS TREATED
 TO THE SPECTACLE OF NINE OF THE 11 POLITBURO MEMBERS
 TROOPING OFF TOGETHER FOR THE TALKS WITH THE CZECHS
 AT CIERNA ON THE BORDER,  PART OF THE APPEAL OF
 THIS TOGETHERNESS IS THAT NEITHER BREZHNEV NOR KO-
 SYGIN APPEARS TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO RISK THE RESPON-
 SIBILITY FOR A SERIOUS MISTAKE, AND EVEN IF THESE TWO
 HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TRUST AND RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER--
 WHICH IS DOUBTFUL--THEY ALSO NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON

 MEN IN THE POLITBURO--SHELEPIN SHELL-YAP-PEEN) AND
 POLYANSKY. FOR INSTANCE--WHO ARE READY AND WILLING
 TO ASSUME LEADERSHIP,
 COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN TRIED IN RUSSIA
 BEFORE. AND THESE MEN ARE ACUTELY CONSCIOUS OF THE
 FACT THAT IN THE END. IT HAS ALWAYS GIVEN WAY TO
 ONE-MAN RULE,  HISTORY DOES NOT HAVE ZQ REPEAT IT-
 SELF. BUT THE MEN IN THE KREMLIN TODAY WILL HAVE TO
 OVERCOME THEIR INCREASING TENSIONS AND THEIR UNSOLVED
 PROBLEMS TO AVOID IT,
 I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE
 GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA IS IN THE HANDS OF BUMBLING
 SECOND-RATERS,  THESE MEN GREW UP UNDER STALIN. AND
 THEY HAVE NO WISH TO RETURN TO HIS MANIC TYPE OF
 DESPOTISM. BUT THEY ALSO GREW UP UNDER COMMUNISM
 AND THE SO-CALLED "DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT."
 AND THEY ARE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO ITS PRINCIPLES AND
 GOALS,  MOSCOW'S TACTICS MAY HAVE BECOME MORE CAU-
 TIOUS. MORE GRADUAL. AND LESS BLATANTLY AGGRESSIVE.
 BUT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE KREMLIN REMAIN UNCHANGED,

 ANOTHER TWO YEARS FOR THE AXE TO FALL,  THE MEN

 IRONICALLY, THESE SOVIET ADVANCES ON ABROAD

 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION APPEARED TO BE PERSECUTING

 CHINESE IN BURUNDI WERE EXPELLED FOR THEIR EXCESSES
 IN SUPPORTING THE REBELS IN THE CONGO,
 THUS THE MAIN EMPHASIS IN THE ACTIVITIES OF
 BOTH '~OSCOW AND PEKING HAS BEEN ON OPEN ECONOMIC

 WITHOUT PAYING TO0 MUCH ATTENTION TO THE POLITICAL

 BOTH r`~OSCOW AND PEKING, OF COURSE, LOOK TO THEIR
 ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID PRUGRAMS TO BUILD CONTACTS

 TO ADVANCE COMMUNIST INTERESTS.  THE MILITARY AID
 ~'iOSCOW  HAS BEEN GIVING THE -`JIGERIANS  IS ONE  EXAMPLE,

 WAS OVERTHROWN IN uHANA IN 196, THE SOVIETS AND EAST
 EUROPEANS RAN A MAJOR INTELLIGENCE AND SUBVERSION

 TRAINING CAMP UPCOUNTRY FOR REVOLUTIONARIES.

 THING, THAT THE MOST A NATION SHOULD EXPECT FOR ITS

 IS A WINDFALL, AND CONTROL AN OUTRIGHT MIRACLE,  THEY
 HAVE ALSO LEARNED TO RESIST THE SPLASHY, SHOWY AID
 PROJECTS THAT DONUT PAY FOR THEMSELVES IN THE LONG

 THERE IS ONE FUNDAMENTAL FACT TO BE KEPT IN
 MIND IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE
 IN AFRICA;  THIS IS THE EXTREME SHORTAGE OF COMPETENT
 NATIVE LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW AFRICAN NATIONS  ON THE

 SOVIETS ARE BUILDING A PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST
 WHICH IS DISPLACING AMERICAN AND BRITISH INFLUENCE,
 IT SUITS SOVIET PURPOSES TO KEEP THE MIDDLE EAST IN
 A STATE OF TURMOIL AND UNREST,
 AT THE SAME TIME, MOSCOW RECOGNIZES THAT THERE
 ARE DANGERS,  ANOTHER WAR AND ANOTHER ARAB DEFEAT
 COULD DESTROY REGIMES ON WHICH MOSCOW HAS LAVISHED
 A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY, MATERIAL. AND EFFORT,  AND
 THERE IS ALWAYS THE DANGER THAT ANOTHER WAR. WITH
 RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES BACKING OPPOSING SIDES.
 COULD LEAD TOWARD DIRECT INVOLVEMENT AND CONFRONTA-

 THE SOVIETS ARE DETERMINED TO AVOID,

 TO ARAB TERMS--AND ON THAT BASIS, THERE CAN BE NO

 DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO RESTRAIN THEIR ARAB CLIENTS

 BUT THE RUSSIANS GROSSLY MISCALCULATED BOTH THE ARAB

 AND CLOSED THE STRAIT OF TIRANA  EVEN BEFORE THE

 THE RUSSIANS DID NOT KNOW THAT CLOSING THE STRAIT
 WOULD BE TAKEN AS AN ACT OF WAR BY THE ISRAELIS.
 AND THAT TEL AVIV BELIEVES ITS CHANCES TO BEAT THE
 ARABS DEPEND ON STRIKING THE FIRST BLOW IF THERE
 IS TO BE WAR.  THE RUSSIANS ARE BEING SOMEWHAT MORE

 THE PRESSURE ON THE CIDG CAMPS HAS CAUSED SOME
 INCREASE IN SOUTH VIETNAMESE CASUALTY FIGURES--AND
 TO A LESSER EXTENT IN U,S, CASUALTY FIGURES--BUT AT
