 A Chinese official has confirmed to Western newsmen
 a    ua Kuo-feng has been elevated to the posts of chairman
 of the party and of the military affairs commission, but there
 has been no public announcement of the move. There has also
 been no statement on the reported arrest of the four "leftist"
 members of the Politburo.
 The four are Chiang Ching, Mao's widow; party vice
 chairman Wang Hung-wen;  fourth-ranked party leader Chang Chun-
 chiao; and party propagandist Yao Wen-yuan. An official's re-
 sponse of "no comment" to journalists' questions on the matter
 is tantamount to acknowledgment that the arrests have occurred.
 Announcements on these and other subjects are likely to be made
 only at the conclusion of the Central Committee plenum which is
 apparently now in session.
 I    I One Western news report, citing "sources close to the
 Chinese government" says that over 30 persons have been arrested,
 including Mao's nephew, Mao Yuan-hsin, who apparently acted as
 head of Mao's personal secretariat in the final days of the
 chairman's life. This report claims that those arrested have
 been charged with "forging" Mao's will. There is no direct evi-
 dence supporting this claim,  but it seems plausible.
 //Several Western embassies in Peking have heard
 that one of the charges against the leftists is that they "dis-
 torted" Mao's writings and had concocted a slogan,  "act accord-
 ing to the instructions laid down," which has been widely used
 in Chinese propaganda since Mao's death.//
 The Central Committee is probably reviewing the
 charges against the leftists. The leading leftists are widely
 and deeply disliked,  and if the record of the past ten years
 is reviewed, as seems likely,  the list of "crimes" is certain
 to be a long one.
 The plenum may also be considering the case of Li
 Te-sheng,     the one regional military commander who has unequivo-
 cally espoused leftist positions since the fall of Teng Hsiao-
 ping. Li,                      a member of the Politburo,  appears to be in serious
 trouble, but he commands troops and his  "case" is probably a
 delicate one.

 The plenum is likely also to be considering the ap-     25X1
 pointment of a reconstituted Politburo, depleted by the deaths
 of five members as well as by the recent purge and the earlier
 dismissal of Teng Hsiao-ping.
 LEBANON:  Situation Report
 Syrian forces based in Jazzin launched a two-pronged
 attack on Palestinian positions early yesterday in what appears
 to be the first phase of their offensive in southern Lebanon.
 The attacks--which came only hours after Arab League mediator
 Hasan Sabri al-Khuli announced that Palestinian and Syrian rep-
 resentatives had reached a new tentative cease-fire agreement--
 will seriously damage the credibility of President Sarkis, who
 had been primarily responsible for convening the settlement
 talks.
 A Western journalist in the area reported
 late yesterday that most of the defenders of Rum had begun re-
 treating and that Syrian forces were continuing to move west
 along the main road to the coast.
 to Hatura in what appears to be a drive toward the Palestinian
 redoubt at Nabatiyah.
 I                Althouqh Christian forces south of Marl  Uyun have
 been shelling Palestinian positions since last week, there is
 no evidence yet that the Christians have assumed a major role

 Palestinian leaders believe Syria is determined to seek a mil-
 itary solution in the absence of a complete Palestinian capitu-
 lation. Yasir Arafat and other moderate Palestinians reportedly
 feel they submitted their "final" position during recent nego-
 tiations at Shaturah and that any further compromises would de-
 stroy the independence and the present leadership of the PLO.//
 Palestinian leaders have little confidence they can hold
 their positions near the major coastal cities of Sidon, Tyre,
 and Beirut,  and that they are resigned to the fall of their po-
 sitions in Tripoli if the Syrians and Christians press their
 advantage there.//
 Palestin-
 ian leaders concede that they     l   not hold out against a pro-
 longed Syrian blockade of Beirut and Sidon, but are hoping that
 under such circumstances they would be rescued by international
 intervention.//
 I             The Palestinians issued an urgent request yesterday
 or an emergency meeting of the Arab League foreign ministers
 and will presumably follow up with direct appeals to the Egyp-
 tians and Soviets for help. Arab League mediator al-Khuli left
 Lebanon for Damascus yesterday, probably on his way to Cairo.
 Syria's actions have thoroughly discredited the
 League's mediation effort and could scuttle plans for a summit
 meeting now scheduled for October 18. The resumption of the
 Syrian offensive suggests that Sarkis and al-Khuli were misled,
 perhaps intentionally, by Syrian representatives to the negotia-
 tions over the weekend.  Few Lebanese are likely to accept sug-
 gestions in the Syrian media that Syria's actions were taken
 in response to the weekend Palestinian attacks on several of
 Syria's embassies.

 USSR:  Gribkov Appointment
 The Soviet news agency Tass announced yesterday that
 Colonel General Anatoly Gribkov has been appointed First Deputy
 Commander in Chief and Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Pact forces,
 filling the position left vacant by the death of Army General
 Shtemenko last April. Judging from past experience, Gribkov
 will also serve as a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff
 of the Soviet Armed Forces.
 //The delay in naming a replacement for Shte-
 menko suggests the Soviets had some difficulty finding an of-

 I                     I During World War II Gribkov served as a major in the
 corps o     the General Staff officers who were sent to field
 units as representatives of the General Staff.  In 1967, he was
 elected to the Supreme Soviet of Armenia.  Since 1973,  Gribkov
 has commanded the key Leningrad Military District, and in June,
 he directed the much publicized exercise  "Sever"--the second
 Soviet exercise announced in compliance with the Helsinki ac-

 57-year-old Gribkov was elected a candidate member of the Cen-

 CUBA:  Anti-US Propaganda
 //Cuba apparently intends to mount a major propa-
 ganda attack on the US over the crash of a Cuban airliner last
 week.//
 I          I Cuban media have highlighted a Miami-based exile or-
 ganizati.on's claim that it was responsible for the crash. The
 Cubans allege that the US has given explosives and other aid to
 counterrevolutionary organizations to attack Cuban personnel
 and installations.
 Cuban Prime Minister Castro may take the opportunity
 of a mass rally in Havana today to accuse the US of direct in-
 volvement in exile attacks.  In the past several months, Castro
 has threatened to renounce the 1973 US-Cuba Memorandum of Under-
 standin                        on hilacking and to respond in kind to terrorist ac-
 tions.
 //Egypt is trying to muster an additional $1 bil-
 lion in balance-of-payments support to prevent a substantial
 cutback in imports and consumption in the coming months.//
 //Last year Arab cash aid covered about two thirds
 ot Egypt's     billion external financial gap. Only about $1 bil-
 lion in Arab aid has been disbursed so far this year, and unless
 more cash aid is received over the next two months Egypt may be
 forced to cut back drastically on imports of food, consumer
 durable goods,  and industrial inputs.//
 //Egypt has postponed payment on many of its for-
 eign             e   s to free cash for needed imports.  Last month, debt
 service arrears totaled $700 million--equivalent to 70 percent
 of the balance-of-payments financing that Cairo is still seek-
 ing for 1976.//

 have tolerated periodic delays in repayment on the assumption
 that Arab aid would be forthcoming. Now, with both Saudi Arabia

 //The newly established Gulf Organization for De-

 year. The organization probably will guarantee $250 million in
 Western bank loans and has offered an additional $250 million
 in direct balance-of-payments support, although negotiations
 have bogged down.//
 //Egypt also hopes Iran will provide $250 million
 in loan guarantees. If all these funds materialize, the remain-
 ing shortfall could be financed with a rollover of short-term
 debt or continued deferment of repayments.//
 //Egypt's balance-of-payments problems will con-

 EC-IRAN:  Negotiations Back on Track
 //French President Giscard's visit to Iran this
 weer   as c eare   the way for early negotiations between the EC
 and Iran on a nonpreferential trade agreement.  Giscard had ob-
 jected to the EC Commission's proposals and refused to go along
 with resumption of the stalemated talks until he had discussed
 the issue personally with the Shah.//
 //The Shah,  taking advantage of his country's
 enhanced political and economic importance, had been seeking
 broad trade preferences similar to those the EC has granted to
 most Mediterranean countries. He may now be willing to settle
 for the more modest relationship the EC Commission has proposed,
 which is modeled on the EC-Canada cooperation agreement that
 came into force last week.//

 //The EC foreign ministers plan to take up the
 Commission's guidelines for the negotiations with Iran when
 they meet in Brussels on October 18 and 19. The Commission has
 suggested an agreement, of unlimited duration, which would:
 Approved For Re1e4
 --Enhance Iran's access to the EC market for certain in-

 --Grant most-favored-nation status to both parties.
 --Promote industrial,  scientific,  and environmental coop-
 eration.
 --Encourage mutual investments and joint industrial ven-
 tures.
 --Establish a joint commission to consider trade problems
 and guide the future evolution of the pact.//
 //The Community is also expected to ask for a
 firm commitment that Iran will continue to supply crude oil to
 its members, even in the event of renewed hostilities in the
 Middle East.  Iran is the EC's second most important supplier
 after Saudi Arabia,  accounting for 18 percent of the Community's
 crude oil imports.//
 //The Nine believe an agreement would also as-
 sure improved access to the Iranian market, which they expect
 will expand greatly over the next decade.//
 //France and Denmark strongly advocated accep-
 tance of the Shah's initial demands for trade preferences on
 the grounds that the EC could not afford to antagonize an im-
 portant oil supplier.//
 //Despite public expressions of support for
 Iran, most other EC members--led by the UK--have opposed pref-
 erential treatment for Iran in private. They cite Commission
 arguments that granting preferences would open the door to sim-
 ilar requests from other countries and violate commitments made
 to the US on the nonproliferation of special trading arrange-
 ments.//

 //Although the Commission now seems to have the
 genera     support of the Nine for its proposals, there are some
 outstanding difficulties. Some members--Italy and the Nether-
 lands for example--are apprehensive that increased imports of
 refined petroleum products from Iran would further aggravate
 their present. problem of excess refinery capacity. Others point
 to Iran's potentially high degree of competitiveness in some
 industrial sectors.//
 //Some members are also concerned that the use
 of the Community's generalized system of preferences for Iran
 would dilute benefits going to the poorer developing states,
 and may constitute a misuse of the system by undermining the
 EC's flexibility to determine what preferences will be offered
 on a year-by-year basis.//
 //Despite these problems,  the Commission will
 probably get a green light to open negotiations before the end
 of the year. The talks could be protracted, particularly if the
 Shah continues to insist on special treatment for such products
 as petrochemicals, metals,  shoes, and textiles. The Community
 is currently in no position, either economically or political)  ,
 to permit easier access       such highly competitive goods.               25X1
 ITALY:  Austerity Measures
 //The austerity measures announced by Italian
 Prime Minister Andreotti on Friday probably will not have a
 significant impact on inflation--currently running at an annual
 rate of 17 percent. The government apparently believed, how-
 ever, that stronger measures would have less chance of accep-
 tance by the labor unions and by the Communist Party, whose
 cooperation in Parliament is essential. A temporary program
 was instituted on October 1 to brake the plunge of the lira
 and shore up business confidence.//
 Most of the measures were discussed extensively in
 e press prior to the cabinet meeting last Friday, but some
 of the measures, including a tax that will raise the price of
 gasoline by 25 percent,  came as a surprise.

 I                 I Apparently, Andreotti,  under pressure from the Com-
 munists, had agreed earlier that measures such as these would
 go into effect only after consideration by Parliament. Although
 Andreotti said over the weekend that he would accept "improve-
 ments" by Parliament,  the Prime Minister hinted that he would
 resign if the measures are watered down.
 I              He appears to be gambling that none of his critics
 wi    wan to risk public disapproval for precipitating the fall
 of the government.
 D
 The government actions, many of which will force up
 consumer prices even more,  include:
 --A 15-percent increase in fertilizer prices.
 --Adjustment of motor vehicle taxes in favor of smaller
 cars.
 --An immediate increase in postal and telegraph rates as
 well as a 10-percent increase in rail fares effective
 December 1.
 --An increase in the withholding tax on dividend payments.
 A decision on electricity and telephone rates was deferred
 to allow more time for consultations with the Communists and
 the unions.
 //In a weak attempt to curb the inflationary im-
 pact o                      rising wages,  Italy also announced a two-year freeze on
 cost-of-living wage increases for upper income workers. Middle-
 income salary earners will have half of their cost-of-living
 adjustments frozen.//
 //This move will do little to slow the rise
 in
 labor
 costs, however, since it will only affect about
 25
 per-
 cent
 of the work force.  Industrial wages probably will
 rise
 more
 than 20 percent this year mainly because they are
 linked

 I             The Communist-dominated labor union is officially
 supporting most aspects of the program, with the notable excep-
 tion of the proposed gasoline price increase. The Communists
 normally exercise predominant influence in the labor movement,
 but in this instance they are having trouble convincing their
 own rank and file and some of the non-Communist unions to go
 along.
 I     I Rank-and-file discontent with the austerity measures
 has produced wildcat strikes in cities such as Turin, Bologna,
 and Milan and a call by militant metalworkers for a general
 strike. In response,  Communist officials have been dispatched
 to key industrial centers to explain the necessity for auster-
 ity measures and the reasons behind the substantial Communist
 support for the program.
 Nevertheless, the federation that represents all of
 Italy's major unions may be forced against Communist wishes to
 call a general strike in order to placate worker discontent.

 BRAZIL-CHILE:  Military Relations
 I                  I The recent official visit of Brazilian Army Minister
 Frota to Chile reaffirmed the countries'  traditionally close
 ties and may have laid the groundwork for an expansion of
 Brazil's military assistance and sales program.
 Frota went to Santiago on the occasion of the 166th
 anniversary of Chilean independence, but there is good reason
 to believe that his private discussions with Chilean officials
 focused on an increase in the sale of Brazilian arms and mili-
 tary equipment to Chile. The Bank of Brazil last month report-
 edly approved a new $40-million credit to Chile for military
 purchases.
 25X1
 I                  I Such arrangements are attractive to both coun-
 tries  .or economic and strategic reasons. Brazil is trying to
 ease its balance-of-payments problems by promoting exports and
 is especially interested in establishing its fledgling armaments
 industry on a firm footing. Chile is aggressively seeking new
 foreign sources of arms now that US military assistance has
 ended.
 1A member of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has told
 US embassy officials that Brazil prefers to restrict high-level
 exchanges with Chile to military channels, and,  for the sake of
 international appearances, politely to stall on Chilean over-
 tures for an exchange of presidential visits.

 SOUTH KOREA:  Strong Economic Recovery
 I      I South Korea's export-led recovery is surpassing all
 earlier forecasts. Paced by a two-thirds rise in exports,  real
 gross national product grew 17.4 percent in the first half of
 the year.  Government officials now project a 14 percent growth
 in GNP for 1976, up from earlier estimates of 9 percent.
 South Korean exports have taken advantage of the con-
 sumer-led recovery in the US and have successfully penetrated
 the lucrative Middle East market.  Import growth, has been more
 moderate, partly due to prospects for a bumper grain harvest
 and Seoul's effective energy conservation program. As a result,
 South Korea's current-account deficit probably will fall to
 about $0.5 billion this year from $2 billion in both 1974 and
 1975.
 The pace of the recovery, while remaining brisk, is
 likely to slow somewhat during the remainder of the year. New
 export orders have already begun to slow. Trade barriers in
 importing countries and the recent weakening in the US economy
 also will moderate export growth.
