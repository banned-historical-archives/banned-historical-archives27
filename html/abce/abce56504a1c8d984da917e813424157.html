 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST NEGOTIATIONS .  .      . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The Soviet proposal of 19 March for a permanent ban
 on all nuclear tests except small underground explosions,
 which would be covered by a moratorium pending the results
 of joint research to improve detection techniques, climaxes
 Soviet maneuvers to draw the Western powers into a compre-
 hensive ban on all testing.  The USSR is seeking to force
 the United States either to accept what is in effect a com-
 prehensive ban on all tests, or to risk an open break with
 London by rejecting the small-tests moratorium.   In the
 disarmament conference, the bloc delegations have refrained
 from their customary procedural disputes, and have sought
 to demonstrate a desire for serious negotiations.   In his
 first days in Paris, Khrushchev lost no time in developing
 the main themes of his visit--the need for Soviet-French
 cooperation on the German problem, disarmament, and the
 elimination of nuclear weapons.
 MIDDLE EAST HIGHLIGHTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page 4
 The Qasim government, apparently fearing further
 clashes between Iraqi Communists and anti-Communists, has
 tightened security precautions.       King Husayn of Jordan
 has reiterated his determinrtion to proceed with plans
 for a plebiscite among the large Palestinian population
 of West Jordan.  President Nasir included several sup-
 porters of Syrian security chief Sarraj in his appoint-
 ments on 18 March to fill vacancies in the Syrian cabinet.
 VIOLENCE IN SOUTH AFRICA .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 6
 The riots on 21 and 22 March in Transvaal and Cape
 provinces of South Africa resulted from the first well-
 organized African nationalist protest action since 1957.
 The Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), which arranged the
 demonstrations,  is a relatively new, militantly antiwhite
 political group
 The South African
 Government can be expected to res r  t the activities of
 the PAC's leaders and to attempt to suppress the organiza-
 tion.

 PART I (continued)
 THE CUBAN SITUATION     .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  7
 The Castro regime is tightening its control over com-
 munications media and extending its radical socio-economic
 programs.  Opponents of Castro's policies are becoming
 more outspoken, however, particularly on the Communist
 issue.  Meanwhile, the extent of Chinese~Coaunist inter-
 est in Cuba is emphasized by the appearance of Chou En-lai
 at a rally of the newly formed China - Latin American Friend-
 ship Association in Peiping.
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 PEIPING ELABORATES DOCTRINAL CLAIM FOR MAO .  .  .  .  .    .  .  Page  1
 The Chinese Communists have substantially expanded
 their claim for Mao Tse-tung as a theorist, crediting him
 with a whole series of "discoveries" and formulations in
 political economy.  A recent article in People's Daily for
 the first time attributes to Mao the "discovery" that
 political indoctrination is more important than material
 incentives in increasing worker productivity.   It also
 credits Mao with solving the economic problems connected
 with China's own "road" to industrialization.   Thus the
 Chinese, in claiming "doctrinal originality" for Mao, con-
 tinue to"raise a challenge to Moscow.
 SINO-INDONESIAN RELATIONS   .
 .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  Page
 Peiping, apparently fearing a burdensome increase in
 the number of Overseas Chinese desiring repatriation from
 Indonesia, has called on Djakarta to relax the pressures
 forcing their departure.  Djakarta may reduce harassment
 of Chinese; but it is unlikely to accede to Peiping's re-
 quest for a formal agreement on repatriation or to other
 of its demands.
 TAIWAN AND PEIPING COMPETE FOR AFRICAN RECOGNITION .
 Communist China's recent threat to break diplomatic
 ties with Guinea if Conakry received another Chinese
 Nationalist delegation reflects Peiping's concern that
 the "two Chinas" concept may be gaining acceptance in
 Africa.  Competition between Taipei and Peiping for rec-
 ognition by emergent African republics was sharpened by

 the recent success of Nationalist China in establishing
 relations with Cameroun and the favorable impression made
 by Nationalist delegations on several African nations
 which will become independent this'year.
 SOVIET REPUBLIC PARTY CONGRESSES .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  5
 Information coming out of the recently concluded Com-
 munist party congresses. in various Soviet republics re-
 veals that the shake-up last year in the top leadership
 of several republics was part of a more extensive turnover
 in important party and government officials than that fol-
 lowing Stalin's death.  The underlying aim seems to have
 been to bring new blood to the leadership of party and
 government at all levels to carry out Khrushchev's dynamic
 new programs.
 THE YUGOSLAV ECONOMY IN 1959 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  6
 The economic gains achieved in Yugoslavia in 1959
 indicate a sound basis for continued rapid economic expan-
 sion.   Significant increases in agricultural and industrial
 production have reduced Yugoslavia's chronic foreign ex-
 change deficit and will enable Yugoslavia to expand its
 export trade, especially with underdeveloped countries.
 Belgrade continues to need foreign economic investment,
 ever, to ensure present rates of growth.
 RUMANIA PLANS INCREASED EMIGRATION OF JEWS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  7
 Bucharest has apparently decided to permit a sizable
 increase in the number of Jews emigrating to Israel.  Arab
 pressure led to a suspension of such emigration in Febru-
 ary 1959 after 16,000 Jews had left Rumania in the pre-
 ceding six months.  To date, there has been only limited
 Arab reaction to the small number permitted to leave
 Rumania during the past four months.  The Rumanians are
 seeking to avoid publicity by increasing the number of
 exit routes but have bad difficulty in securing coopera-
 tion from Greece.
 POLITICAL SITUATION IN KENYA  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  9
 Although the London constitutional conference on
 Kenya last February pointed toward eventual independence,
 those Africans demanding immediate freedom have not been
 satisfied by concessions such as London's agreement to an
 African-dominated Kenya legislature.  European settlers,
 concerned over isolated instances of Mau Mau - type ter-
 rorism, are deserting the moderate New Kenya party in
 favor of the right-wing United party, which is pledged to
 support white rule in Kenya.

 24 March 1960
 PART II (continued)
 MOROCCAN LABOR CONFLICT SEEMS IMMINENT .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  Page   9
 A prolonged struggle for dominance over organized
 labor seems imminent in Morocco.  A recently launched
 right-wing labor federation, expected to be legalized by
 royal decree, seeks to win over 650,000 workers affiliated
 with the leftist Moroccan Union of Labor.    While police
 repression of leftist activities may have deterred an at-
 tempt- to disrupt the right-wing organizing meeting.
 clashes between rival labor factions seem almost certain
 when leftist labor leader Ben Seddik returns to Morocco.
 MODERATE GOVERNMENT FORMED IN CEYLON .  .  . .       .  .  .  .  .  Page  10
 Moderate elements scored a substantial victory over
 the leftists in Ceylon's parliamentary elections on 19
 March, but political instability is likely to continue.
 The conservative United National party (UNP) has only 50
 seats, 29 short of a majority.  Prime Minister Senanayake
 intends to rule with a minority government, and may stay
 in power temporarily by virtue of the opposition's dis-
 unity, but new elections could become necessary in the
 relatively near future.
 SITUATION IN LAOS   .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  11
 The Communist-front Neo Lao Hak Sat (NLHS) has be-
 latedly entered 9 candidates for the 59 National Assembly
 seats at stake in Laos' 24 April elections.              Hanoi radio
 has broadcast a purported NLHS appeal to the Laotian
 people to vote for NLHS and other "peace-loving" candi-
 dates.  These developments suggest that the Pathet Lao
 insurgents will not make a widespread effort to disrupt
 the elections; however, they may'try to'influence the
 vote in rural areas.  Of the non-Communist candidates,
 who make up most of the total of 158, some 60 are on the
 government's "unified slate," and the rest are unaffil-
 iated candidates, many of whom may be induced to withdraw.
 DETERIORATING POLITICAL SCENE IN SOUTH KOREA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page
 The widespread resentment aroused by the Rhee govern-
 ment's repressive and fraudulent election tactics marks an
 increasing tnedency by the regime over the past year to
 rely on force and repression:.

 self to refrain from future seizures nor to release an
 additional 47 fishermen when they complete their sen-
 tences.  A broad settlement of the many differences be-
 tween the countries remains remote.
 PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION TO DE GAULLE REGIME RISING   .  .  .   Page  15
 De Gaulle's refusal to call a special parliamentary
 session on agricultural policy has evoked widespread
 criticism from the press and from parliamentary spokesmen.
 While he has muzzled parliamentary opposition during
 Khrushchev's visit, he will shortly face further demon-
 strations by farmers in addition to efforts to topple the
 Debrd government.
 NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS' MEETING   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page
 The special meeting of NATO defense ministers in Paris
 planned for 31 March and 1 April has been called to follow
 up proposals made at the December 1959 ministerial meeting
 on means of improving the Western defense effort in the
 face of chronic deficiencies.  While wide-ranging discus-
 sions may be expected, significant decisions must await
 the results of other studies not due for completion until
 May, when the foreign ministers hold their regular spring
 meeting.
 THE OUTLOOK IN COLOMBIA   .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page
 Preliminary returns from the 20 March elections in
 Colombia for the lower house of the national Congress indi-
 cate that the National Front government headed by President
 Alberto Lleras can no longer count on the two-thirds con-
 gressional majority required to pass virtually all legisla-
 tion.            Lleras will arrive in the United States on 4 April
 for an official visit, and he will probably seek to deter-
 mine the availability of credits to promote his comprehen-
 sive economic development plan, which was not an issue in
 the recent elections.

 THE BOLIVIAN REVOLT     .   .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  ...  .  .  Page  19
 The brief threat posed by the rebellion of a police
 regiment in La Paz on 19 March temporarily allayed feuding
 within Bolivia's governing Nationalist Revolutionary Move-
 ment.  Further disorders are likely in the next two months
 as the government prepares for the country's second presi-
 dential election with universal suffrage. The quick sup-
 pression of the police revolt suggests that President Siles
 is likely to be the first Bolivian president in 30 years to
 serve for a full term
 VIOLENCE IN THE ECUADOREAN POLITICAL CAMPAIGN   .  .

 Recent politically motivated violence in Ecuador re-
 flects the explosive and acrimonious nature of the campaign
 for the June presidential elections and indicates that the
 incumbent Conservative government will be hard-pressed to
 maintain order both during and after the voting.  The Com-
 munist-backed coalition
 will prob-
 a  y a  emp   o  n ens  y t e interparty animosity to ex-
 ploit unrest.  An organized revolutionary move is more
 likely after the elections than before.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 KREMLIN POLITICS AND THE KHRUSHCHEV SUCCESSION .  .  .  .  .  .  Page
 The Soviet system has no mechanism for the orderly
 transfer of the great power which in the USSR inevitably
 becomes concentrated in the hands of one man.   Many of
 the dismissals of important central and regional officials
 since late 1958 are probably attributable to failure to
 get things done to Khrushchev's satisfaction, but some of
 the principal changes seem to arise from rivalry for the
 succession.  The sharp decline of Aleksey Kirichenko, con-
 trasted with the growing prestige and authority of Frol
 Kozlov, presents the clearest recent evidence of this
 rivalry.  Kozlov seems at the moment to be in front.
 SATELLITE ATTITUDES TOWARD EAST-WEST DETENTE .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page    5
 The East European satellites' attitudes toward im-
 provement of East-West relations have ranged from full
 support of Khrushchev's position to echoes of Peiping's
 divergent opinion.  Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and
 Albania particularly are at some variance with Moscow.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PART III (continued)
 Soviet pressure has been increasing for a greater degree
 of conformity on central issues in the pre-summit period.
 Many satellite leaders continue to fear that a rapproche-
 ment with the West may make their maintenance of internal
 controls more difficult; expression of their reservations
 as to the wisdom of Soviet policy probably have not been
 completely silenced.
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 8
 Successes of the African nationalist drive for self-
 government emphasize the problem posed by the entrenched
 European communities.  A policy of hard opposition to
 local nationalist movements is dominant among the 5,000,000
 Europeans in Algeria, Portuguese Africa, Rhodesia, and
 South Africa.  This attitude tends to negate the efforts
 of London, Brussels, and Paris to develop good will by
 yielding control elsewhere in Africa to nationalist move-
 ments.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 OS.IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 The Soviet proposal of 19
 March for a permanent ban on
 all tests except small under-
 ground explosions--the latter
 would be covered by a moratorium
 pending the results of joint
 research to improve detection
 techniques--climaxes a long
 series of Soviet maneuvers to
 draw the Western powers into a
 comprehensive ban on all test-
 ing.  This is the second time
 that the USSR, at a critical
 point in the long negotiations,
 has adopted a proposal favored
 by Britain as a means of com-
 promising differences between
 the Soviet and American posi-
 tions.
 The moratorium proposal,
 based on a concept first ad-
 vanced last October by Britain,
 is designed to force the United
 States either to accept what
 is in effect a comprehensive
 ban on all tests, or to risk
 an open break with London by
 rejecting the moratorium on
 small tests.
 Moscow is also seeking by
 this move to strengthen Khru-
 shchev's advocacy at the sum-
 mit conference of a compromise
 treaty incorporating the So-
 viet proposal for an annual
 quota of on-site inspections of
 suspected nuclear explosions--
 a concept first advanced by
 Prime Minister Macmillan.   25X1
 Before introducing the pro-
 posal, Tsarapkin listed "nu-
 merous Soviet concessions" which
 have preceded this move:   the
 quota concept for on-site in-
 spections; the package proposal
 of 14 December for the compo-
 sition and voting procedures
 of the control system; the
 "temporary criteria" proposal
 introduced on 16 February, in
 effect accepting American cri-
 teria for dispatching inspec-
 tion teams during the period
 required for installing the con-
 trarl system; and the agreement
 to begin joint research for im-
 proving the control system im-
 mediately upon signing the
 treaty.
 Each of these proposals
 was intended to press for a
 total ban without requiring
 Moscow to yield to any great
 extent in its insistence on
 maintaining control over the
 day-to-day operation on Soviet
 territory of the proposed in-
 spection system.
 Tsarapkin's public and pri-
 vate interpretations of the
 moratorium proposal suggest a
 desire to blur  the line be-
 tween tests prohibited by the
 treaty and those banned by the
 temporary moratorium.   On 21
 March he asserted that the in-
 spection quota should apply to
 all underground events regard-
 less of yield, therefore making
 the question of magnitude "ir-
 relevant."
 In agreeing to a joint re-
 search program, the Soviet pro-
 posal moves beyond the 16 Feb-
 ruary proposal to adopt "temporary

 criteria" for determining when
 to send out on-site inspection
 teams.   While part of any re-
 search program would be de-
 voted to refining these cri-
 teria, the principal effort of
 the experts under the latest
 proposal would be devoted to
 studies and experiments for de-
 veloping adequate techniques
 for detecting and identifying
 possible underground explo-
 sions.   The joint research
 would include underground ex-
 plosions,intended to improve
 available.data on seismic dis-
 turbances.
 On 21 March, however,
 Tsarapkin repeated the asser-
 tion he made earlier to the
 press that the joint program
 should be limited to non-nu-
 clear chemical explosions,
 thereby supporting the long-
 standing criticism of Western
 efforts to include nuclearexplo-
 sions in any technical program.
 Since introducing its 19
 March proposal,  the Soviet del-
 egation has sought to create
 the impression of flexibility
 in working out a satisfactory
 compromise.   Tsarapkin asserted
 on 21 March that the moratorium
 should remain in force for four
 or five years, although he im-
 plied that this would be sub-
 ject to negotiation.   He sug-
 gested that during this time
 the joint research program
 should stress the specific prob-
 lem of detection and identifica-
 tion of underground tremors,
 with a view toward extending
 the limited treaty to include
 all testing.
 Tsarapkin stated that if
 the experts were unable to
 solve the problem within the
 time limit, the three powers
 would have to work out a new
 arrangement for the future. He
 had told the press earlier that
 in this case he presumed the
 moratorium would be extended.
 Although the Soviet bloc
 delegates at the general dis-
 armament conference continued
 their efforts to secure priority
 consideration for Khrushchev's
 proposals by establishing that
 "general and complete disarma-
 ment" is the principal task of
 the conference,  they have re-
 frained from resorting to cer-
 tain tactics employed in previous
 negotiations, such as refusing
 to proceed to serious discus-
 sions until the Western powers
 agree to Soviet demands on the
 agenda.  The Communist dele-
 gates also avoided raising ob-
 stacles to a quick agreement
 on procedural arrangements.
 The European satellite del-
 egates apparently have been as-
 signed the task of prolonging
 the exchange over complete and   25X1
 general disarmament as the main
 objective of the negotiations.

 time in seeking explanations

 Western plan as a means of dem-
 onstrating their desire for
 serious negotiations.   Zorin's
 remarks in particular were in-
 tended to convey an impression
 of reasonableness and flexi-
 bility.  He offered to change
 the timetable of the Soviet
 plan, moving a prohibition of
 nuclear weapons from the last
 stage to the first, and stated
 it did not matter at what stage
 the liquidation of foreign
 bases would come about.
 The bloc delegates have
 also attempted to emphasize the
 first stage of the Soviet plan
 --reduction of forces--by de-
 scribing it as a response to
 previous Western proposals. In
 presenting a detailed comparison
 between the Western and Soviet
 plans for conventional disarma-
 ment in the first stage, Zorin
 recalled force levels set otit
 in the Western plan of August
 1957.
 He countered British crit-
 icism of lack of precision in
 the Soviet plan by requesting
 specific force levels for Brit-
 ish and French forces in the
 first phase of the reductions
 under the Western proposal.
 The bloc has reinforced these
 moves by strongly criticizing
 or ignoring the other features,
 such as preparatory studies
 and arms storage, which are
 proposed in the first stage of
 the Western plan.
 Khrushchev in France
 In his public statements
 during the first two days of
 the visit, Khrushchev departed
 from the usual generalities and
 .emphasized the main theme of
 his visit--Soviet-French coop-
 eration against Germany.   He
 began this campaign in his ar-
 rival speech by recalling De
 Gaulle's wartime role and,
 referring obliquely to the
 problem of Germany and Berlin,
 he indicated the possibility
 of a concerted French-Soviet
 position.   In the formal toast
 at a banquet on 23 March,Khru-
 shchev again stressed the pos-
 sibility of "working out a
 common approach to the solu-
 tion" of the problem of re-
 straining German "revanchism."
 The Soviet leader also be-
 gan his effort to play on the
 historic ties between the two
 countries and on France's great-
 power status.   Foreshadowing a
 possible proposal, similar to
 the one offered Macmillan last
 February, for renewing the war-
 time treaty of friendship and
 alliance, Khrushchev interspersed
 his remarks with frequent ref-
 erences to "Joint efforts,"
 and "concerted positions on
 basic questions."   He asserted
 that the situation in Europe
 depends to a great extent on
 relations between the two larg-
 est countries--the USSR and
 France.
 Khrushchev placed his
 visit in the context of the
 forthcoming summit, and repeated
 his forecast that his talks
 with De Gaulle would be "good
 preparation" for the summit.
 As he did in Asia last month,
 the Soviet premier expressed
 hope that the May summit meet-
 ing would lead to "a series of
 important negotiations between
 leaders of the great powers."
 In addition to the German prob-
 lem, Khrushchev listed disarma-
 ment and elimination of nuclear
 weapons as subjects which would
 be taken up during his visit.
 He attempted to demonstrate
 Moscow's serious interest in
 reaching settlements on these

 was not "preparing to do so."
 He portrayed    the nego-

 ban as on the verge of agree-
 ment in claiming that,if the
 Soviet 19 March  proposal is
 adopted, "all issues will be

 to further the impression of

 The Qasim regime has tight-
 ened its security precautions
 during the past week,apparent-
 ly fearing major clashes  be-
 tween Communists and anti-Com-
 munists.  A serious incident
 between these groups took
 place in Basra on 19 March and
 was followed by many arrests.
 A rash  of Communist-in-
 spired strikes in Baghdad and
 labor difficulties  in Basra
 have accompanied an intensifi-
 cation in antiregime propa-
 ganda by the pro-Communist
 press. The campaign,which be-
 gan in mid-February, has been
 particularly aimed at municipal
 and provincial  authorities,
 who have for various reasons
 arrested Communists and their
 supporters, and at provincial
 governors, who have  been ac-
 cused of discriminating
 against Communist-dominated
 peasant organizations.
 At first this criticism
 was aimed at individuals and
 anti-Communist elements;   it
 now is aimed at the government
 itself, which is charged   with
 "intellectual bankruptcy." The
 propaganda does not, however,
 attack Qasim personally.   The
 non-Communist press has  re-
 sponded in kind and is defend-
 ing the regime, while accusing
 the Communists  of mastermind-
 ing the labor troubles.

 King Husayn has reiterated
 his determination  to  or.oceed

 Husayn could cite this and
 other manifestations of Pales-
 tinian support he has received
 as reason for not holding a
 plebiscite if he should change
 his mind.
 Opinion in Jordan varies
 as to what-might be the result
 of a free plebiscite. The Amer-
 ican Consulate General in Jeru-
 salem reports that private re-
 actions there to the King's
 offer have ranged from cynical
 apathy to heated questioning.
 Some Western diplomats in Amman
 believe UAR propaganda might
 swing a vote in favor of West
 Jordanian independence.
 Husayn professes confi-
 dence that UAR propaganda would
 not affect the outcome, since
 he believes the experience of
 Syria, as a member of the UAR,
 has "opened the eyes" of Pal-
 estinians to what he implied
 were unhappy consequences of
 accepting Nasir's leadership.

 The selection of Husni al-

 Thabit al-Aris, is a Christian

 appointments seems clear, it
 is not conclusive.  Such young,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1960
 The demonstrations were
 organized by the anti-Communist
 Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC),
 which broke with the older,
 Communist-influenced African
 National Congress (ANC) in early
 1959.   While the ANC is willing
 to grant rights to non-African
 minorities, the PAC's program
 is militantly antiwhite; both
 organizations, however, deny at
 present that they plan to at-
 tain African domination through
 violence.
 a result of a dynamic organiza-
 tional campaign, this group
 has apparently supplanted the
 ANC as the nationalist spokes-
 man for important areas of
 Transvaal and Cape provinces.
 The recent demonstrations were
 part of a PAC campaign,  in
 which the ANC did not partici-
 pate, against the South African
 system of identity cards for
 nonwhites.  Taking advantage
 of the present state of tension,
 the ANC has called for a work
 stoppage and day of mourning
 on 28 March.
 The Castro regime is tight-
 ening its control over communi-
 cations media and extending
 its radical socio-economic pro-
 grams.   Over 80 radio and tele-
 vision stations have been formed
 into the "Independent Front of
 Free Transmitters" (FIEL) with
 the avowed purpose of "consoli-
 dating the revolution and
 orienting the people."  Many
 of the announcers are pro-Com-
 munists, and the output often
 follows the Communist line.
 One FIEL announcer has said
 The South African Govern-
 ment can be expected to restrict
 the activities of the PAC's
 leaders and to attempt to sup-
 press the organization.   Presi-
 dent Robert Sobukwe, a former
 instructor at Witwatersrand
 University in Johannesburg, has
 been arrested and charged with
 incitement and sedition, along
 with 12 other PAC leaders.
 Prime Minister Verwoerd has
 stated,that they will be charged
 with sedition.
 Racial tension in South
 Africa will probably increase
 further.   The 10,000 white
 police--an estimated one third
 of them under 21--have shown
 a growing tendency to fire at
 demonstrating crowds.  Africans,
 on the other hand,  are increas-
 ingly effective in organizing
 their protests, and the wide-
 spread response to the PAC's
 call for demonstrations indi-
 cates a new willingness to suf-
 fer the consequences of militant
 organized protests.  Disturbances25X1
 will probably occur with in-
 creasing frequency in the
 future.
 that an inter-American network
 is planned, with branches in
 Mexico, Venezuela, and possibly
 Panama.
 According to Peiping's
 New China News Agency, which
 has been timely and accurate
 on recent internal Cuban de-
 velopments, the "people's
 stores," organized by the re-
 gime's Agrarian Reform Institute
 to "eliminate exploitation by
 the middleman" in retail sales,
 are being extended to the cities.

 Five such markets are said to
 be operating in Havana, in
 addition to more than 1,300
 already established in rural
 areas.   Working on a 10-percent
 margin, they may drive inde-
 pendent grocers out of business.
 The recent defections of
 Cuban service attaches in the
 United States and Venezuela and
 the resignation of the moderate
 finance minister, Lopez Fresquet,
 coincide with increasingly out-
 spoken attacks on Communism
 by Cuban groups alarmed at re-
 cent Communist gains.  The
 Autentico organization of former
 President Prio issued a sharply
 worded attack on Communism on
 14 March and called for a "unity
 congress" of groups supporting
 the Cuban revolution.   It warned
 these groups against abdicating
 their responsibilities, as such
 a course would leave the field
 open to the Communists.
 Unrest is also reported
 among Cuban students worried
 by Castro's stated intention of
 "reforming" the university,
 eliminating its jealous
 guarded autonomy.
 The "Week of Solidarity
 with the Struggles of the Latin
 American People," declared by
 the Communist-infiltrated Cuban
 Labor Confederation for 20-26
 March and warmly endorsed by
 the Cuban Communist party, re-
 sulted in several public mani-
 festations and much propaganda
 against the "dictatorial" re-
 gimes in Latin America and in
 support of the Puerto Rican
 people's "struggle against
 colonial rule."
 The Chinese Communists
 gave strong support to the
 Cuban manifestations with a
 mass rally in Peiping on 19
 March, the first of the "China
 - Latin America  Friendship
 Association" which was formed
 in China on 16 March,   Radio
 Peiping reported that the rally,
 "in support of the Latin American
 people's national and democrat-
 ic. movement and the Cuban peo-
 ple's struggle against US im-
 perialist aggression," was
 addressed by Premier Chou En-
 lai and a number of Latin
 American delegates.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 PEIPING ELABORATES DOCTRINAL CLAIM FOR MAO
 The Chinese Communists
 have considerably expanded
 their claim for Mao Tse-tung
 as a theorist, crediting him
 with a whole series of "dis-
 coveries" and formulations in
 political economy. An article
 in People's Daily on 25 Feb-
 ruaryryc=e  that Mao "cre-
 atively" explained the proper
 relationships in a developing
 Communist economy and "dis-
 covered" the underlying prin-
 ciple of "high-speed expansion
 of socialist construction."
 For at least 16 years,
 the Chinese have been adding
 new components to what they
 term the "ideology of Mao Tse-
 tung"; by 1957 the elements of
 philosophical, military, lit-
 erary, and governmental theory
 were discernible.   The People's
 Daily article, which co-nT-alns
 the most precise elaboration
 of Mao's thinking on economic
 problems thus far published,
 appears designed to add a
 political-economy component to
 the "ideology of Mao-Tse-tung."
 The article for the first
 time attributes to Mao the "dis-
 covery" that political indoc-
 trination is more important
 than material incentives in in-
 creasing worker productivity--
 a view previously expressed
 by lesser Chinese spokesmen.
 "The ideology of economism,
 superficially emphasizing ma-
 terial incentives and...'pay
 according to work'... corrupts
 the revolutionary will of the
 working class," People's Daily
 states.
 "Comrade Mao Tse-tung,"
 the article continues,'formu-
 lated the concept that 'politics
 takes command' and, in a basic

 manner, solved the relationship
 between economics and politics
 under socialism....   He dis-
 covered the definite principle
 for the encouragement of posi-
 tiveness among workers:  politics
 taking command is first, while
 material incentives can only
 occupy the second position."
 This line appears to be
 intended as theoretical justi-
 fication for China's departure
 from certain Soviet practices.
 It is an explicit contradiction
 of Soviet doctrine and an im-
 plicit rebuke to Khrushchev,
 who had criticized the Chinese
 for neglecting material incen-
 tives in their commune program.
 Another indication of Chinese
 divergence is the article's
 claim that Mao "solved" prob-
 lems concerning the proper
 proportion to be given to ag-

 for him in Moscow's appeal to
 Lenin against Stalin on 30 June

 Chinese claims was indicated on
 21 March by the first secretary
 of the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous
 Region, who stated that Mao's

 in China "but also has a great     25X1
 influence on the socialist and
 Communist movements in the world."
 SINO-INDONESIAN RELATIONS
 Chinese Communist Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi has called on
 Djakarta to negotiate promptly
 a formal agreement on  Chinese
 repatriation.   Chen's request
 was made on 15 March in  reply
 to Indonesian Foreign Minister
 Subandrio's letter of 23  Jan-
 uary denying that Indonesia had
 violated the lawful rights and
 interests of Overseas Chinese
 and stating that consequently
 there was nothing to negotiate.
 Chen reiterated Peiping's
 demands that Djakarta refrain
 from "forcible" evacuation of
 Chinese under its ban on alien
 retailers in rural areas, com-
 pensate those already evacuated,
 and give those faced with  re-
 moval more time to decide be-
 tween being relocated and re-
 turning to China.   Chen also
 asked that dispossessed Chinese
 who elect repatriation be per-
 mitted to sell their property
 and take the proceeds out of
 the country, and that Djakarta
 transport repatriates to ports
 of embarkation, assume respon-
 sibility for their accommoda-
 tion while awaiting ships, and
 provide "shipping facilities"
 for their return to the main-
 land.
 ing hardships suffered by Chi-
 nese may greatly increase the
 number desiring repatriation.
 There are growing indications
 that Chinese in Indonesia be-
 lieve they will remain "second-
 class" nationals even if they
 adopt Indonesian citizenship,
 and that consequently they have
 no real future in Indonesia.
 Communist China has scored
 an initial propaganda gain among
 overseas "compatriots" by its
 { quick action in repatriating
 some 7,500 Chinese, but the re-
 gime has been indirectly en-
 couraging others to remain abroad.
 A mass influx of Indonesian Chi-
 nese to the mainland, together
 with the cost of transportation
 and resettlement, would place a
 heavy burden on the regime. The
 majority of these already repa-
 triated are indigent women, chil-
 dren, and aged, according to
 Peiping.
 Probably the primary Chi-
 nese Communist concern at this
 point was expressed in a Peo-
 ple's Daily editorial of i'3-
 -M rch which stated that Peiping
 would welcome "appropriate meas-
 ures"   by Djakarta to encourage
 Peiping apparently is moti-

 TAIWAN AND PEIPING COMPETE FOR AFRICAN RECOGNITION
 Communist China recently
 threatened to break diplomatic
 relations with Guinea if Cona
 kry again officially received
 a visiting Chinese Nationalist
 delegation as it did last Jan-
 uary.   The harshly worded note,
 delivered by a charge only a
 few weeks after the Chinese
 Communist Embassy was opened
 in Conakry, shows Peiping's
 apprehension that the concept
 of "two Chinas" may be gaining
 acceptance among emerging
 African republics.
 Communist China is spend-
 ing a good deal of time, money,
 and effort bidding for recog-
 nition in Africa.  Peiping so-
 licits governmental contacts
 with those nations which have
 achieved independence and, as
 the "true friend of national
 liberation," is actively sup-
 porting those Africans still
 engaged in the "anticolonial
 struggle."  The Communists
 view this support as an in-
 vestment in future recognition.
 Despite the appeal Peiping
 holds for many Africans, how-
 ever, the competition with
 Taipei has become keener, and
 the Chinese Communists have
 real cause for concern.
 Last year Libya recog-
 nized Taipei.   In January 1960
 the new Cameroun Republic did
 likewise, and last month the
 Chinese Nationalist Legation
 in Liberia was raised to em-
 basSy status.  Ethiopia.report-
 edly, has put off a Chinese Com-
 munistbid for recognition on
 the grounds the moment'is not
 opportune.   Reluctance of these
 countries to accept Peiping or
 their preference for Taipei
 may stem in part from Communist
 China's bellicosity in Asia,
 but, political considerations
 for relations with the West and
 renewed efforts by Nationalist
 China in the area seem largely
 responsible.
 The Chinese Nationalists,
 just. as bitter opponents of the
 "two Chinas" concept as.the Com-
 munists, realize the potential
 value of recognition by new
 African republics--each of which
 will eventually' vote on the
 Chinese representation 'issue in
 the United Nations.  Taipei has
 sent. two official delegations
 toAfrica in recent months in
 an effort to promote recognition
 and expand contacts..

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Peiping's note to Guinea
 indicates the seriousness with
 which the Chinese Communists
 view the Nationalist challenge,
 but Peiping is not likely to
 jeopardize its African program
 by severing relations with
 Guinea or any other nation
 which briefly entertains visit-
 ing Nationalists.   Instead,
 Peiping is likely to increase
 its own political and economic
 effort to broaden contacts at
 all levels, calling on Africans
 to "resist the trap set by the
 United States and the Chiang
 Kai-shek clique to undermine.
 friendship between the peoples
 of China and Africa."
 SOVIET REPUBLIC PARTY CONGRESSES
 Information coming out of
 the recently concluded Commu-
 nist party congresses in vari-
 ous Soviet republicsreveals that
 the shake-up last year in the
 top leadership of several re-
 publics was part of a more ex-
 tensive turnover in important
 party and government officials
 than that following Stalin's
 death.   The congresses were the
 required periodic meetings of
 republic party organizations to
 review the work of the leading
 party bodies (central committee
 and auditing commission) in the
 republic and elect new members
 to them.   Four of the republics
 --Belorussia,  Kazakhstan, Uzbeki-
 stan, and the Ukraine--hold con-
 gresses every four years; ten
 meet every two years; there is
 no republic party organization
 in the Russian republic.
 The report of the central
 committee, normally given by
 the first secretary, covers
 major topics of domestic con-
 cern to the republic--industry,
 agriculture, science, culture,
 and party work; foreign affairs
 are not discussed.   All reports
 this year followed closely the
 basic themes expounded at the
 special 21st national party
 congress last year, with empha-
 sis on fulfillment of the Seven-
 Year Plan (1959-65) as a major
 step toward the establishment
 of a Communist society.
 Underlying nearly all the
 criticism voiced at the con-
 gresses was deep concern for the
 human factor in increasing eco-
 nomic productivity.   In discuss-
 ing deficiencies in the program
 for developing the "new Com-
 munist man," for example,
 speakers emphasized the practical
 need for inculcating in Soviet
 citizens a more selfless atti-
 tude toward work.

 present Kazakh party boss, Din-
 mukhamed Kunayev, that work
 stoppages had occurred last
 year at a construction site in
 central Kazakhstan suggests
 that the strike may have been
 an added factor in the ouster
 of former Kazakh party boss
 Nikolay Belyayev.
 Membership on the leading
 bodies elected by party con-
 gresses is given on the basis
 of the individual's political
 standing and position as an
 important leader at some level
 in the republic hierarchy.
 Changes in these bodies, there-
 fore, provide a good measure of
 the turnover in officials at all
 levels in periods between party
 congresses.
 The composition of the cen-
 tral committees and auditing
 commissions elected this year
 shows that in eight of the four-
 teen republics holding congresses,
 the turnover in the period 1956-
 60 was greater even than in the
 period 1952-56, during which
 the Beria purge  and  the
 Khrushchev-Malenkov struggle for
 power ravaged party organizations
 throughout the Soviet Union.
 Considerations of political
 loyalty to Khrushchev,  however,
 The favorable economic
 gains achieved by Yugoslavia
 in 1959 indicate a sound basis
 for continued rapid economic
 expansion.   Economic successes
 were highlighted by the larg-
 est agricultural harvest in
 Yugoslav history and by?the-re-
 gime's announcement in Novem-
 ber that the goals of the 1957-
 appear to play only a minor
 role in the 1956-60 turnover,
 as most of the changes occurred
 in late 1958 and 1959 after
 the repercussions of the  oust-
 er                                                       of Malenkov, Molotov, and
 Kaganovich had largely died
 away.   The republics most af-
 fected are, for the most part,
 those least affected by the
 events of the post-Stalin
 struggle.   In all republics,
 moreover, carry-overs from the
 Stalin era constituted  a  rel-
 atively  large proportion of
 those dropped, suggesting that
 the aim was to bring new blood
 to the leadership  of   party
 and  government in  order  to
 cope with the  demands  of
 Khrushchev's dynamic  new
 programs.
 An editorial in one re-
 public  newspaper expressed
 the problem this way:   "In
 his time he was not a bad
 leader. However,  the new tasks
 and accelerated pulse of our
 entire life after the 21st
 party congress demanded better
 qualified party lea der;hip
 over the economy, but Comrade
 X, having attained his goal,
 approached everything with an
 old measuring tape."
 61 plan should be essentially
 achieved by the end of 1960.
 In 1959, Yugoslavia in-
 creased industrial production
 13 percent and maintained a
 high investment rate.   An in-
 crease of 17 percent in per
 capita income, coupled with a
 pi-ice index rise of only 2

 Bucharest is making every ef-
 fort to avoid any publicity
 over the renewal  of  emigra-
 tion.            In February 1959 strong
 Arab pressures on Rumania and
 the USSR forced the suspension
 of Jewish emigration after 16,-
 000 Jews had left Rumania in
 the previous six months.
 Bucharest has granted be-
 tween  3,000  and  4,000  exit
 permits since November  1959.
 Since 1 January between 700
 and 800 Jewish emigrants have
 arrived  in  Greece,   nearly
 all of them on special char-
 tered Rumanian civil airline
 (Tarom) flights from Bucharest.
 The Rumanian decision to
 extend Jewish emigration ap-
 pears to have been motivated
 by internal considerations.
 The political unstable Jew-
 ish element, which numbers
 about 225,000 persons, has re-
 fused to be assimilated into
 the "socialist" society.   In
 addition, Bucharest stands to
 gain considerable economic
 benefits as a result of the
 exodus and concomitant appro-
 priation of properties.
 Nevertheless, the regime is
 fully aware that it can pro-
 ceed only gradually and cau-
 tiously if it is to keep the
 magnitude of the movement as
 secret as possible.
 The Rumanians have sought
 to diversify the exit routes
 for the emigres.  Future siz-
 able emigration to Israel may
 be imperiled, however, as
 Greece--one of the main exit
 routes for the Jews--has not
 been particularly cooperative
 because of pressure from the
 UAR and concern for the safety
 of large Greek colonies in
 Arab countries.
 In a further complica-
 tion, France has suspended the
 issuance of all East European
 visas from 1 March until the
 end of Khrushchev's visit.
 Limited emigration continues
 via  Hungary,   Austria,   and
 Italy, and there is specula=
 tion that a route through
 Yugoslavia may be revived.
 In an effort  to  reduce
 Arab criticism of Rumania's ac-
 tions, tacit agreements have
 been reached among Israel, Ru-
 mania, and some West European
 countries--particularly France
 and Italy--to provide "sojourn
 visas" which do not state the
 ultimate destination as Israel.
 There is as yet no evi-
 dence of Arab complaints to
 West European nations concern-
 ing this procedure. Other than
 the pressure brought on Greece,
 there has been no known adverse
 Arab reaction to the renewed
 emigration.   Last month Radio
 Cairo took cognizance of the
 renewal, but played down the
 development by saying that it
 was restricted to the sick and
 and the aged.

 Bucharest is making every ef-
 fort to avoid any publicity
 over the renewal  of  emigra-
 tion.            In February 1959 strong
 Arab pressures on Rumania and
 the USSR forced the
 suspension
 of Jewish emigration
 after 16,-

 in
 Bucharest has granted be-
 tween  3,000  and  4,000  exit
 permits since November  1959.
 Since 1 January between 700
 and 800 Jewish emigrants have
 arrived  in  Greece,   nearly
 all of them on special char-
 tered Rumanian civil airline
 (Tarom) flights from Bucharest.
 The Rumanian decision to
 extend Jewish emigration ap-
 pears to have been motivated
 by internal considerations.
 The political unstable Jew-
 ish element, which numbers
 about 225,000 persons, has re-
 fused to be assimilated into
 the "socialist" society.   In
 addition, Bucharest stands to
 gain considerable economic
 benefits as a result of the
 exodus and concomitant appro-
 priation of properties.
 Nevertheless, the regime is
 fully aware that it can pro-
 ceed only gradually and cau-
 tiously if it is to keep the
 magnitude of the movement as
 secret as possible.
 The Rumanians have sought
 to diversify the exit routes
 for the emigres.  Future siz-
 able emigration to Israel may
 be imperiled, however, as
 Greece--one of the main exit
 routes for the Jews--has not
 been particularly cooperative
 because of pressure from the
 UAR and concern for the safety
 of large Greek colonies in
 Arab countries.
 In a further complica-
 tion, France has suspended the
 issuance of all East European
 visas from 1 March until the
 end of Bhrushche$'s visit.
 Limited emigration continues
 via  Hungary,   Austria,   and
 Italy, and there is specula-
 tion that a route through
 Yugoslavia may be revived.
 In an effort  to  reduce
 Arab criticism of Rumania's ac-
 tions, tacit agreements have
 been reached among Israel, Ru-
 mania, and some West European
 countries--particularly France
 and Italy--to provide "sojourn
 visas" which do not state the
 ultimate destination as Israel.
 There is as yet no evi-
 dence of Arab complaints to
 West European nations concern-
 ing_this procedure. Other than
 the pressure brought on Greece,
 there has been no known adverse
 Arab reaction to the renewed
 emigration.   Last month Radio
 Cairo took cognizance of the
 renewal, but played down the
 development by saying that it,

 this 66-member group,  Senanayake
 apparently hopes to retain power
 because of the opposition dis-
 unity and defections.                  He may
 succeed temporarily.   The SLFP
 apparently does not yet intend
 to ally with the leftists in
 Parliament, and UNP elements
 are trying, reportedly with
 some success, to attract SLFP
 members. The small size of Sen-
 anayake's cabinet suggests that
 he has reserved a few minis-
 tries to offer likely defectors.
 However, opposition elements
 can topple his government at
 any time they decide to unite
 in a no-confidence vote. Opposi-
 tion pressure alone might cause
 him to resign voluntarily, as
 he lacks the political nimble-
 ness and tenacity of his prede-
 cessors.
 New elections would be the
 most likely consequence.   Gov-
 ernor General Goonetilleke would
 prefer to have the SLFP in power
 and might maneuver toward this
 end.  The SLFP, however, prob-
 ably could do no better than the
 UNP. The principal leftist par-
 ties are not in a position to
 form a government, either singly
 or in coalition.  The Trotskyite
 party, which won second place
 in the 1956 elections, has suf-
 fered considerable losses, and
 former Agriculture Minister
 Philip Gunawardena's Marxist
 party made a poor showing despite
 its appeal to the majority
 Singhalese-Buddhist community.
 The Communist party ranks low-
 est of the main parties, with
 only three seats.
 New elections could result
 in a large plurality or possi-
 bly a majority for one party.
 A substantial number of minor
 party candidates who lost presum-
 ably would not care to incur
 the cost of another contest, and
 most of the votes they divided
 on 19 March probably would go
 to the UNP and the SLFP.  The
 leftists would not make signif-
 icant  gains.
 UNP leaders reportedly
 fear that new elections would
 result in a majority for the
 SLFP. This seems unlikely,
 provided elections are not held
 immediately, for the wave of
 emotional sympathy which the
 SLFP aroused by evoking the
 image of the late Prime Minis-
 ter_  Bandaranaike probably can-
 not be sustained indefinitely.
 The Communist-front Neo
 Lao Hak Sat (NLHS) has belated-

 support     NLHS, Santiphab, and
 other  "patriotic and  peace-

 small  left-wing  neutralist
 party which generally voted
 with the NLHS in the previous
 assembly'.  It has openly pre-
 sented only            five candidates,
 but a few of the unaffiliated
 candidates are believed to be
 associated with it. The  NLHS
 is  also probably hoping that
 other unaffiliated candidates,
 if elected,  will support the
 leftist bloc in the next  as-

 These develop-
 ments suggest that
 the Pathet Lao in-
 surgents will make
 no generalized ef-
 fort to disrupt the
 elections.   They may,
 however, exercise
 their probably sub-
 stantial capability
 for influencing the
 rural vote, endeavor-
 ing to swing it in
 favor of leftist can-
 didates in districts
 where there are such
 candidates, and to
 limit it in districts
 where there are not.
 The NLHS could still
 withdraw from the
 race if it considered
 the odds too heavily
 against it, but pres-
 ent indications  are
 that it seriously in-
 tends to participate.
 While the NLHS and
 allied elements
 could not win control
 of the assembly, the
 Communists may hope
 to elect a small
 leftist bloc which
 can use the assembly
 as a propaganda forum
 and can maneuver to
 split the non-Commu-
 nist majority likely to emerge
 from the elections.
 Of the nonleftist candi-
 dates, who make up most of the
 list of 158 candidates, some
 60 are on the "unified slate"
 agreed to by the reformist Com-
 mittee for Defense of National
 Interests (CDNI) and  former
 Premier Phoui's Rally of the
 Lao People (RLP).   This group
 presumably will receive most
 of the funds and other forms
 of assistance the government
 will probably commit to  the
 campaign.

 DETERIORATING POLITICAL SCENE IN SOUTH KOREA
 The widespread resentment
 aroused by the Rhee government's
 repressive and fraudulent elec-
 tion tactics--which resulted
 in serious election-day dis-
 turbances--could lead to es-
 trangement between the govern-
 ment and a majority of the
 Korean people.   There has been
 an increasing tendency by the
 regime during the past year to
 rely on force and repression.
 Those newspapers not con-
 trolled by the government have
 been outspoken in their criti-
 cism of the administration's
 election tactics, which pro-
 duced an overwhelming victory
 for President Rhee and his
 running mate, Yi Ki-pung.Large
 numbers of students have par-

 demonstrations.   Korean youths,
 already disenchanted with the
 Rhee government, now have a
 group of martyrs--the students
 killed by police during the
 bloody election-day riots at
 the southern port city of
 Masan.
 The
 Democratic leadership has
 called the election "null and
 void," and the party's repre-
 sentatives have walked out of
 the National Assembly.
 There are indications
 that the government is con-
 cerned and would like to bring
 about a relaxation of tensions.
 The home minister has publicly
 accepted responsibility for
 the Masan riots, and Rhee has
 accepted his resignation. The

 South Korea's reluctant

 has insisted that they "quietly"
 be sent to South Korea, but
 Japan is unlikely to agree.
 Immediately prior to South
 Korea's agreement to the ex-
 change, Tokyo was considering
 a stronger policy toward Seoul.
 This included referring the
 Rhee line and the detainee dis-
 putes to the UN, expelling the
 South Korean diplomatic mission
 in Japan, and taking additional
 measures to protect Japanese
 fishing vessels from seizure.
 Inasmuch as there are many
 differences remaining between
 the countries--including the
 continued existence of the Rhee
 line, the threat of future sei-
 zures, and vast unsettled prop-
 erty claims--an over-all solution
 appears remote.  Tokyo already
 has announced that after 1 April
 its patrol boats in the Rhee
 line area will , mount three-inch
 guns as well as machine guns,
 although orders lifting firing
 restrictions have not been is-
 sued.   Other countermeasures       25X1
 will probably be considered if
 Seoul returns to an intransigent
 position.
 PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION TO DE GAULLE REGIME RISING
 De Gaulle's refusal to
 call a special parliamentary
 session on agricultural policy
 has evoked widespread criticism
 from the press and from parlia-
 mentary spokesmen.   While he
 has muzzled parliamentary op-
 position during the 23 March -
 3 April visit of Khrushchev,
 he will shortly face further
 demonstrations by farmers in
 addition to efforts to topple
 the Debr6 government.
 The farm bloc includes
 enough deputies in the major
 assembly groups to put consid-
 erable pressure on the govern-
 ment when parliament reconvenes
 on 26 April.   The agricultural
 lobby can count on other in-
 terests, too, because several
 groups opposed to De Gaulle's
 tactics and policies are using
 the farm issue as a vehicle for
 their own ends.
 The rightist Independents,
 with few exceptions, are against
 De Gaulle's self-determination
 policy in Algeria, and they
 have been moving into overt op-
 position to the government since
 the dismissal of Finance Minister
 Pinay.   The Independent right
 wing, convinced De Gaulle will
 be unable to solve the Algerian
 problem, is maneuvering with an
 eye to the period after De Gaulle.
 The Union for a New Republic
 (UNR), the other principal member
 of the Debr6 coalition, although
 under control of "loyal" Gaull-
 ists, is split on De Gaulle's
 Algerian policy.   Dismissed UNR
 leader Jacques Soustelle may '

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NATO defense ministers,
 who meet in Paris on 31 March
 and 1 April, will follow up pro-
 posals made at the  December
 1959 ministerial meeting, and
 developed in subsequent studies,
 on means of improving the West-
 ern defense effort in the face
 of chronic deficiencies in man-
 power, training, equipment, and
 installations. Other studies on
 ways of overcoming the defici-
 encies in the individual coun-
 try programs, which were author-
 ized at the December 1958 min
 isterial meeting, are not due
 until May, however, and impor-
 tant decisions are unlikely
 without them.   The agenda in-
 cludes logistics in peace and
 war; cooperation in armaments
 research, development, and pro-
 duction; NATO defense planning;
 and meeting the defense burden.
 The scheduled report on
 the air defense integration
 question was deleted for fear
 of jeopardizing "the very deli-
 cate discussions now in progress"
 between the French and NATO
 military authorities.   In view
 of urgent requests for substan-
 tive information on this matter,
 especially on the part of Bel-
 gium and the Netherlands, Sec-
 retary General Spaak has called
 for a report to the North At-
 lantic Council (NAC) as soon as
 possible, but  in  any  event
 shortly after the spring minis-
 terial meeting in May.
 A German paper proposing
 to keep the German build-up coor-
 dinated with NATO by establish-
 ing substantial integration in
 logistics poses the alternative
 of erosion of the system, estab-
 lished by the 1954 agreements,
 of checks and balances on the
 development of an independent
 German military force.   This
 item is likely to be referred
 to General Norstad for study
 and recommendation.
 German and British propos-
 als designed  to give  impetus
 to cooperation in armaments pro-
 duction will be discussed. De-
 fense Minister Strauss may also
 raise a German suggestion for
 NATO-wide cooperation and coor-
 dination in the field of psycho-
 logical warfare.   A British
 paper on defense planning pro-
 poses greater emphasis on NATO
 preparedness for the first phase
 of a nuclear war at the expense
 of the second.
 The lack of response to
 the American plea for European
 members to undertake an increased
 share of the common defense
 effort has prompted Spaak to
 call for specific proposals by
 member governments to be dis-
 cussed at this meeting.  None

 is known to have advanced any
 such proposal so far.
 Recommendations by a spe-
 cial steering group on the re-
 form of the Annual Review ex-
 ercise, including the addition
 of a triennial review, have
 been approved in principle by
 NAC and referred to the Annual
 Review Committee for detailed
 study.   This matter was con-
 sidered to be too complex for
 useful discussions by the de-
 fense ministers.
 Preliminary returns from
 the elections on 29 March in
 Colombia for the lower house of
 the national Congress indicate
 that the National Front govern-
 ment headed by President Alberto
 Lleras can no longer count on
 the required two-thirds con-
 gressional majority required
 to pass virtually all legisla-
 tion.
 Colombia's National Front
 is a parity system under which
 elective and appointive posi-
 tions at all levels are divided
 equally between the Liberal and
 Conservative parties.   Each
 party must contend with dissi-
 dent factions, which reportedly
 gained enough  congressional
 seats in the elections to be
 able to disrupt the government's
 two-thirds majority. Although
 the dissident elements are un-
 likely to cooperate to obstruct
 the administration,  a long-
 standing struggle between the
 two principal Conservative
 factions for control of the
 party may flare up again and
 create new strains for the Na-
 tional Front.
 Lleras,  a Liberal with con-
 siderable popularity in his
 country and prestige in Latin
 America, has restored democratic
 government to Colombia since he
 took office in August 1958 with
 an overwhelming popular mandate.
 Prior to his accession to pow-
 er, an interim military junta
 had ruled for more than a year
 after the ouster of former mil-
 itary dictator Rojas Pinilla
 in May 1957.
 In the economic sphere,
 the government has practiced
 import austerity, rebuilt for-
 eign exchanges reserves,  and
 refunded the backlog of commer-
 cial debts accumulated during
 the dictatorship.  Its recently
 issued development plan en-
 visages the need of about $185,-
 000,000 annually in public
 credits from abroad and private
 foreign investment.   This basic
 program emphasizes increased
 agricultural production and
 crop diversification.
 Lleras will arrive in the
 United States on 4 April for an
 official visit,  and he will
 probably seek to determine the
 availability of credits to pro-
 mote his comprehensive economic
 development plan, which was
 not an issue in the recent elec-
 tions.   Lleras is expected to
 press for credits for agrarian

 reform, which he considers
 essential to end prolonged
 and widespread rural violence
 and to undercut the Communist
 potential for subverting the
 rural population.
 Lleras' ability to dem-
 onstrate  progress in socio-
 economic improvement during
 his last two years in office
 could bear heavily on the
 survival of the National Front,
 which may face a critical test
 in 1962 when a Conservative
 candidate is scheduled to fill
 the  presidency.
 The brief threat posed by
 the rebellion of a police regi-
 ment in La Paz on 19 March tem-
 porarily allayed feuding within
 Bolivia's governing Nationalist
 Revolutionary Movement (MNR),
 although the rebels apparently
 favored the party's right-wing
 faction.   Both the party ma-
 jority leader, Victor Paz
 Estenssoro, and his bitter op-
 ponent, Walter Guevara, rallied
 to President Siles'   support
 while the fighting was in prog-
 ress.   Despite recent serious
 dissension within the army,
 air force, and civilian mili-
 tia  over the approaching pres-
 idential and congressional
 elections, none of these forces
 joined the rebels.
 Two days later, however,
 an armed band fired on Guevara,
 who was unharmed.   The attack
 was evidently designed to deter
 him from resuming active lead-
 ership of a right-wing splinter
 group of the government party.
 This attack and the resigna-
 tion of two cabinet ministers
 in apparent protest against
 President Siles' tolerant at-
 titude toward the splinter
 group suggest the likelihood
 of further disorders prior to
 the presidential elections on
 22 May.
 The revolt was led by
 Guevara supporters, although
 Guevara seems to have been un-
 aware of the plot.
 The willingness of key
 followers of Guevara to attempt
 a revolt reflects their pessi-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1960
 VIOLENCE IN THE ECUADOREAN POLITICAL CAMPAIGN
 Recent politically moti-
 vated violence in Ecuador re-
 flects the explosive and acri-
 monious nature of the campaign
 for the June presidential
 elections and indicates that
 the incumbent Conservative gov-
 ernment will be hard pressed
 to maintain order both during
 and after the voting.   The
 Communist-backed anti-Conser-
 vative coalition (UDNA)i
 will probably
 attempt to intensify the ani-
 mosity among the parties and to
 exploit unrest.      Although the
 possibility of widespread dis-
 order will continue, an organ-
 ized revolutionary movement is
 more likely after the elections
 than before.
 Political violence erupted
 in two provincial capitals in
 early March, and campaign ten-
 sion was heightened by the
 deaths of five persons in riot-
 ing on 19 March in Quito, when
 former President Velasco--a
 slight favorite in the presiden-
 tial race--arrived for a polit-
 ical rally.   The clashes were
 primarily between Velasquistas
 and members of the National
 Democratic Front, a coalition
 of Liberals and moderate Social-
 ists which supports former Presi-
 dent Galo Plaza.   The Conserva-
 tives, whose candidate   is for-
 mer cabinet minister Gonzalo
 Cordero, were involved to a less-
 er degree.
 Communists were also
 charged by a high government
 official with some responsi-
 bility for the riot;
 SECRET
 PART II NOTES AND COMMENTS
 The Communist coalition,
 which includes leftist So-
 cialists and the demagogic Con-
 centration of Popular Forces,
 will probably attempt to pro-
 voke disturbances in order to
 take advantage of a favorable
 moment for a revolutionary
 attempt--particularly if its
 candidate, Antonio Parra, is
 defeated.   Parra's chances
 are not considered so favor-
 able as those of Velasco or
 Plaza, but his backers have
 an excuse for an extralegal
 move in the public statement
 of the top Velasquista leader
 that his party will not per-
 mit the election  to be stolen
 from it, and that it will
 take the presidency by "as-
 sault" if necessary.   Conserva-
 tive President Ponce is a
 bitter antagonist of Velasco,
 and if the Velasquistas are
 defeated in June, they will
 probably charge that the Presi-
 dent conducted a dishonest
 election.
 Government concern over
 the political climate is re-
 flected in the decree issued
 after the riots on 19 March
 banning outdoor political ral-
 lies through the electoral
 period.   The possibilities of
 widespread disorders during
 the campaign may also be re-
 duced by the increased capa-
 bility of the army and police,
 which recently received train-
 ing and equipment from the
 United States for controlling
 riots.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 KREMLIN POLITICS AND THE KHRUSHCHEV SUCCESSION
 After more than 40 years,
 the Soviet system still has no
 mechanism for the smooth trans-
 fer of the enormous power which
 in the USSR inevitably becomes
 concentrated in the hands of
 one man. Heretofore there has
 been a period of transitional
 committee rule overlying an
 intense dogfight from which
 has emerged the new "sole lead-
 er," the man who best combines
 a determination to lead with
 two other staples of political
 strength: first,a program which
 most nearly fits the temper of
 the handful of oligarchs who
 command decisive voices, and
 second ,organizational support,
 which rests on a consensus--
 primarily among top party pro-
 fessionals--that the dominance
 of one or another of the con-
 tenders is the best safeguard
 of their own future.
 must combine the qualities of
 discretion, a keen sense of
 political timing, and strong
 nerves.
 A potential successor
 must also reckon now with Khru-
 shchev's image of himself. Ever
 since 1957, when he finally
 eliminated the remaining ob-
 stacles to total power--Malen-
 kov, Molotov, and Zhukov--Khru-
 shchev's view of himself has
 come increasingly to center on
 two symbols of accomplishment:
 domestically, on an economic
 program which promises to pro-
 vide greater material comfort
 as well as more personal secu-
 rity; internationally, on the
 establishment of the USSR as a
 great-power equal of the United
 States.
 Party "Reorganization"
 The Question of Succession
 Khrushchev, now approach-
 ing his 66th birthday, may re-
 main on the scene for many
 years. His concern about his
 durability is shown, however,
 by his frequent allusions to
 the subject and his lengthen-
 ing vacation periods.  There
 is no doubt that Khrushchev
 would like to handpick his
 successor.   Much as he might
 want to guarantee an orderly
 transition, however, it is in
 the very nature of his posi-
 tion, as well as of his per-
 sonality, that he can del-
 egate or bequeath only a lim-
 ited amount, if any, of his
 authority.
 Thus, despite the more
 "civilized" aspect of the post-
 Stalin regime, Kremlin pol-
 itics remain an intricate,
 brutal, bitter,  "dog-eat-dog"
 business.  Anyone who has his
 sights on Khrushchev's powers
 For the men closest to
 Khrushchev, his present sense
 of destiny presents both the
 hazard of failing to meet new
 criteria and the opportunity of
 influencing significant new ap-
 pointments.   In Khrushchev's
 eyes, political loyalty is no
 longer a sufficient test for
 important office in a man whom
 he otherwise rates as inept or
 clumsy.  As he told the party
 central committee last Decem-
 ber,   "Friendship is friend-
 ship, but work is work." It is
 probably this thought which
 largely accounts for the changes
 made, }beginning in late 1958, in
 most of the USSR's 15 republics
 and many key sectors of the cen-
 tral party and government ma-
 chine.
 Altogether, this "reorgan-
 ization" has cut more deeply in-
 to the ranks of the higher party
 and government hierarchy than
 any of the earlier, more drh-
 matic post-Stalin  "purges,"

 Averky Aristov, Leo-

 shchev's preoccupa-
 tion with high-level
 affairs of state prob-
 ably means that he
 has come to rely in-
 creasingly on the ad-
 vice of his lieuten-
 ants in making key
 appointments.
 Kozloy--A Beneficiary
 The major bene-
 ficiary of Kirichenko's
 decline may well be
 Frol Kozlov--Kirichen-
 ko's contemporary and
 obvious rival for the posi-
 beginning with Beria and end-
 ing with the Malenkov-Molotov
 debacle.  Many of the men af-
 fected are graduates of organ-
 izations headed by Khrushchev
 in the Stalin era, either in
 the Ukraine or in Moscow
 Oblast.
 Some of these men have
 been given responsible but less-
 er            new jobs.   In other cases,
 demotion is more clearly in-
 volved.   Presidium members
 Nikolay Belyayev and Aleksey
 Kirichenko, once rated among
 Khrushchev's closest political
 allies, have tumbled far from
 the summit of power.
 Some of the changes will
 have only an indirect bearing
 on high-level political rival-
 ries.            The disgrace of Kiri-
 chenko, especially, is bound
 to have its effect on the
 alignment of power at the top
 today and on the prospects for
 the succession in the future.
 His transfer from Moscow to
 Rostov opens up to others the
 substantial authority in party
 affairs he once exercised.  The
 so-called cadres function--
 overseeing key party appoint-
 ments--assumes particular sig-
 nificance.   It is most likely
 tion of heir apparent.  The ear-
 nestness of Khrushchev's declara-
 tion to Governor Harriman last
 June now becomes more believable:
 Kozlov would succeed him, Khru-
 shchev asserted, adding that
 Harriman would be backing the
 wrong horse if he picked Kiri-
 chenko.   Since then the groom-
 ing of Kozlov has apparently
 continued: his visits to the
 United States in June and July
 1959 and to India in January       25X1
 and February 1960 signify a wid- 25X1
 ened scope of interest and ex-
 perience;

 Kozlov's lack of a posi-
 tion in the party secretariat
 and, therefore, presumably of
 direct influence on party op-
 erations and appointments has
 been considered his most seri-
 ous handicap in the succession
 sweepstakes.  Kozlov himself
 may no longer be a member of
 the central committee's Bureau
 for the RSFSR (Russian Repub-
 lic), the dominant party or-
 ganization in the USSR's larg-
 est and most important repub-
 lic, but two men who are con-
 sidered close to him politi-
 cally are+-Dimitry Polyansky,
 premier of the Russian repub-
 lic, and Ivan Spiridonov, Koz-
 lov's successor as chief of
 the Leningrad party organiza-
 tion.
 The Leningrad Network
 There are signs of the
 emergence of a kind of Lenin-
 grad network in the upper
 echelons of the Soviet party.
 In view of Kozlov's long con-
 nection with Leningrad, cover-
 ing the better part of 30 years,
 the staffing of pivotal posts
 with alumni of the Leningrad
 organization is a potential
 gauge--although one which has
 its limitations--of Kozlov's
 strength.
 Among such appointments,
 the most recent was the trans-
 fer in January of Nikolay
 Rodionov from second secretary
 of the Leningrad Oblast party
 to the party's second-in-com-
 mand in the troubled Kazakh
 Republic.   In discussing the
 appointment before the Kazakh
 party central committee, the
 first secretary, himself newly
 named, described Rodionov as
 "a pupil of the Leningrad party
 organization, which is strong
 in its revolutionary tradition."
 The past year has also
 brought the appointment of sev-
 eral Leningraders to posts in
 the party's central headquar-
 ters, a string-pulling center
 through which party function-
 aries, although not of the first
 rank themselves, can exert con-
 siderable influence on the
 course of party politics.   For-
 mer Leningraders are now head
 and deputy head of the central
 committee's Department of Agri-
 culture for the Russian.: Repub-

 Aristov-Brezhnev-Ignatov
 Besides Khrushchev;-'s pa-
 tronage, Kozlov would do well
 to have the support  or at
 least the benevolent neutral-
 ity of men like Aristov,Brezh-
 nev, and Ignatov.   These three
 --all experienced veterans  of
 the party machine--are members
 of  both the party  presidium
 and  the secretariat.   `"heir
 roles are played mostly behind
 the scenes, but they are high-
 ly skilled in high party poli-
 tics.
 Aristov, formally second-
 in-command  to Khrushchev  on
 the Bureau for the RSFSR, ac-
 tually exercises day-to-day
 control of operations and ap-
 pointments in the Russian Re-
 public.
 Brezhnev, who has had  a
 role in the party supervision
 of the armed forces and possibly
 the security organs, may have
 taken on some of the responsi-
 bilities for personnel appoint-
 ments in the wake of Kiri-
 chenko's removal. For example,
 he presided over the recent
 change of command in Kazakhstan
 and was treated to the kind of
 elaborate flattery which would
 befit a man of growing conse-
 quence.
 The third member of this
 trio,Ignatov, has made a come-
 back after a brief period  of
 apparent eclipse, and he may
 be entrusted once again with
 top-level party supervision of
 agricultural  policy. For  a
 period of several months  in
 1953 he was Kozlov's superior
 in the Leningrad party,  but
 whether this ephemeral rela-
 tionship produced political
 friendship or enmity is not
 clear. There is a hint of the
 latter in the fact  that  the
 appointment of the Leningrader
 Vorobyev to his central com-
 thittee agricultural post                                                                in
 April 1959 coincided with Ig-
 natov's  presumed  removal,
 temporary though it may have
 been, from authority  in the
 agricultural sphere.
 The more Kozlov appears
 the heir apparent,   the more
 likely he is to   become  the
 target of other ambitious men
 and the more he may be  in-
 clined to overreach himself.
 For now, however, he seems to
 have some  formidable assets:

 in both domestic and interna-
 tional affairs, and at least
 the nucleus of a personal ma-
 chine.  He probably needs time
 to build on these beginnings.
 If Khrushchev were to leave
 East European attitudes
 toward improved East-West re-
 lations range from support of
 Khrushchev's position favoring
 "peaceful coexistence" to  an
 echo of Peiping's avowed dis-
 trust of the detente and in-
 terest in maintaining world
 tensions. The Stalinist re-
 gimes of Czechoslovakia, East
 Germany, and Albania have
 adopted propaganda positions
 in sharpest variance with Mos-
 cow, while Rumania and Poland
 have been most responsive to
 Khrushchev's example on this
 issue.   The responses of  the
 satellite leaderships reflect,
 to varying degrees, their
 basic political orientations,
 the degree of their servility
 to Moscow, the geographic sit-
 uations of their countries, or
 their involvement in a specific
 foreign policy situation.
 All the satellite regimes
 are mindful of events  in 1955
 and 1956,  when  the  "Geneva
 spirit" contributed to danger-
 ous internal relaxations. Con-
 cern over the effects of de-
 tente at home have been expressed
 publicly and privately, par-
 ticularly last fall in all the
 satellites.   Soviet efforts--
 most recently at the bloc meet-
 ings in Moscow in February--to
 interpret and explain Khru-
 shchev's detente policy have
 evidently silenced some of the
 fear.   Initial reactions coupled
 with some later expressions of
 concern, however, indicate don-

 Mikoyan might become a sort of
 interim chairman of the board.
 Over the longer run, however,
 Kozlov now looks like the man
 to beat.
 tinuing apprehension among  a
 number of the satellite leaders.
 Rumania and Poland
 The Rumanian and Polish
 regimes have come closest to
 echoing Khrushchev's policies
 of internal relaxation.  Bucha-
 rest,  although hard-line*in
 orientation, has followed the
 line primarily because of its
 fidelity to Moscow.   Early
 fears of the effect of such a
 program on internal Rumanian
 developments were admitted by
 Rumanian leader Gheorghiu-Dej
 at a diplomatic gathering on 7
 November:   "My people," he said,
 "had some doubts at first about
 the benefits that could result
 from Khrushchev's American
 visit."
 This fear evidently  has
 been relegated to the back-
 ground, for Bucharest has pressed
 for claims settlements and great-
 er cultural and economic ex-
 changes with the West, and it
 has been the loudest advocate
 of Khrushchev's calls for  a
 Balkan "zone of peace."   It has
 also used detente for its  own
 specific ends, and began even
 before Khrushchev's US trip to
 make friendly gestures in  the
 economic and cultural fields.
 The. more liberally inclined
 Polish regime has also been  a
 strong advocate of rapproche-
 ment, but for different reasons.

 Soviet foreign policy since
 1957,partly to lessen pressures
 for conformity in internal pol-
 icies, and it has been a leader
 in Central European disarmament
 schemes since Foreign Minister
 Rapacki presented his plan to
 the United Nations in  October
 1957.  Poland may also be moti-
 vated by a belief that a detente
 would lead to a settlement of
 the German problem and Western
 recognition of the Oder-Neisse
 line, and that a lessening  of
 world tensions would reduce So-
 viet pressures on Warsaw.   Most
 recently,  Poland has reached
 agreement with the United States
 over outstanding American claims
 for nationalized properties.
 Bulgaria
 The Bulgarian leadership,
 one of the most rigidly ortho-
 dox in East Europe, has  re-
 verted to total support of Mos-
 cow's internal and foreign pol-
 icies after having strayed be-
 yond Soviet examples  in evolv-
 ing a "great leap forward"  in
 late 1958 and early 1959.  In
 recent months Sofia has pub-
 licly echoed Moscow's "peace-
 ful coexistence" theme, co-
 operating with Rumania, Albania,
 and the USSR in supporting So-
 viet plans for a Balkan nuclear-
 free area.
 Further ev  ence
 of a warmer attitude toward the
 West is the cooperation the
 American advance party, and now
 the legation, has obtained from
 Bulgarian officials since last
 fall.                            25X1
 Despite these public ex-
 amples of support for "peace-
 ful coexistence," however, some
 party members I           I appear     25X1
 very concerned about the desir-
 ability of a rapprochement with
 the West.   A high-ranking Bul-
 garian official, for example,
 noted at the time of  Khru-
 shchev's visit to the United
 States that international re-
 laxation could lead to a weaken-
 ing of internal control in Bul-
 garia.   Bulgarian Foreign Min-
 ister Karlo Lukanov warned the
 National Assembly on 3 Novem-
 ber of
 effect
 the
 of a
 possible harmful
 detente on the
 "na-
 tional
 liberation movement."
 Czechoslovakia
 The Czech leadership has
 also expressed considerable
 skepticism concerning a de-
 tente. Czech propagandists have
 emphasized anti-American themes.
 and seized every opportunity to
 charge that the West is working
 against coexistence and is in-
 terested in rapprochement only
 in the hope of stimulating re-
 visionism from within through
 increased contacts.
 Certain Czech actions have
 reflected this attitude. While
 there have been isolated tac-
 tical moves to conform with Mos-
 cow's line, these are more than
 counterbalanced by such actions
 as the virtual suspension of
 the four-year-old negotiations
 with the United States on an
 economic settlement,  the rejec-
 tion of the US efforts to ex-
 pand cultural exchanges, and
 the defaulting on British and
 French loan payments, which
 had been serviced without inter-
 ruption since before World War
 II.
 Party leader Novotny,long
 an advocate of tough policies,

 to compromise with the West.
 Novotny, who demonstrated his
 understanding of Chinese re-
 luctance to a detente during
 anniversary celebrations in
 Peiping in October, has in-
 sisted on tight control and
 isolation from the West,  be-
 lieving this to be-`the only
 means of communizing a nation
 with advanced West European
 democratic traditions and
 orientation. He apparently be-
 lieves  coexistence would
 erode the internal progress
 toward the Soviet model which
 the Czech party has achieved.
 Czech leaders--and Novotny
 in particular--may still have
 reservations about the thesis
 and may have expressed them at
 the recent Moscow meeting of
 the Warsaw Pact.  Such an ac-
 tion could, in part, explain
 why Novoay was the only party
 first secretary who did  not
 have a private audience with
 Khrushchev while in Moscow.
 East Germany, Albania, Hungary
 The attitude toward a de-
 tente exhibited by East Germany,
 Albania, and Hungary is heavily
 influenced by fear that it would
 permit external forces to affect
 their stability. The East German
 leadership fears that East-West
 negotiations might lead to  a
 settlement detrimental to East
 Germany.  It has followed a pol-
 icy  of maintaining tension and
 challenging the integrity of
 any Western proposals designed
 to ease the cold war.   Last
 September, Ulbricht
 feared that Khrushchev, in his
 eagerness to secure agreement
 with the United States, might
 make concessions at East Ger-
 many's expense.   There is, how-
 ever, agreement on the basic
 goals of Moscow's German policy,
 and Khrushchev has sought to
 allay Ulbricht's fears of anyad-
 verse settlement of the German
 issue.
 Recent East German propa-
 ganda--perhaps reflecting Ui-
 bricht's Satisfaction with
 Khrushchev's tactical planning
 for the summit--has conformed
 with the Kremlin line on Soviet
 policy toward Germany. Never-
 theless, some East German ap-
 prehension over the tactical
 treatment-of the German prob-
 lem will remain as long as
 East Germany's international
 Albania has given lip
 service to detente but has a-
 dopted a hostile and militant
 propaganda position.   Tirana's
 reservations, which parallel
 Peiping's position, are based
 largely on a fear of the al-
 leged threat Yugoslavia poses
 for Albanian security in  the
 event of international relaxa-
 tion. Party leader Hoxha under-
 lined this fear on 21 September
 when he warned, "Vigilance  is
 essential, because the imperial-
 ists and their servants the re-
 visionists are waiting to pounce
 on any bloc weakness to stab us
 in the back."
 Hungary has, in the main,
 supported a rapprochement, but
 it has taken a more hostile at-
 titude than Moscow toward the
 United States because of a con-
 tinued American challenge  to
 the legitimacy of the present
 Budapest regime.   Hungarian
 party First Secretary Kadar, a
 loyal supporter of Khrushchev,
 gave evidence of concern over
 the possible internal effects
 of international relaxation in
 a speech in November to the
 party congress.

 in part, to clarify Khrushchev's

 West Africa, the few small
 European settlements pose no
 great problem.   In the higher
 altitudes of East and South Af-
 rica, whites are more numerous
 and in several areas show a de-
 termination to retain their in-
 fluence regardless of the con-
 sequences.
 Areas With Little Tension
 In West Africa, European
 merchants and slave traders be-
 gan to exercise growing mili-
 tary and political power along
 the coast more than 250 years
 ago.   Adverse climate limited
 the European element to trad-
 ers, missionaries, and a few
 administrators until late in
 the last century, when exten-
 sive penetration of the hinter-
 land began.
 Today, in the vast region
 stretching from the Sahara to
 the Congo River, there are over
 74,000,000 Negroes and only
 about 165,000 whites.  Of these
 Europeans, at least a third are
 located at Dakar, which  has
 played an important role as the
 French administrative capital,
 defense post, and economic cen-
 ter.   In this area, where there
 are few white settlers, racialism
 is relatively unimportant, and
 the white minority enjoys no
 special privileges which would
 delay the achievement of inde-
 pendence by African states.
 In the East African terri-
 tories of Ethiopia, Uganda, Rw-
 anda-Urundi, and the Somalilands,
 there are about 30,000,000 indigenous
 people. and only 45,000 Euro-
 peans.   Here, too, the influ-
 ence of the white man in com-
 mercial and adminis-
 trative capacities is
 decreasing and the
 African exercises in-
 creasing political
 power.

 total about 25 percent of the
 employed Europeans, are centered
 at the capital in Leopoldville
 and have no strong ties to hinder
 their return to Belgium. How-
 ever, the  future holds greater
 concern for the rest of the com-
 munity, including the 50 percent
 concerned with manufacturing and
 industry and the 20 percent en-
 gaged in independent commerce.
 Many of these persons, par-
 ticularly those in the eastern
 Congo and in mineral-rich Ka-
 tanga Province, fear heavy eco-
 nomic losses whether they sell
 out and return to Belgium or re-
 main under an inexperienced Afri-
 can regime. Some settlers in Ka-
 tanga may emigrate to neighboring
 Rhodesia. Others are apparently
 already supporting schemes for
 Katanga's secession from a Congo
 state.   The large foreign com-
 panies--particularly the copper-
 processing Union Miniere--ap-
 parently expect to weather the
 transition period and do busi-
 ness with the new Congolese gov-
 ernment.   They may, however,
 face early nationalization.
 The recent constitutional
 conference in London clearly in-
 dicated that the British colony
 of Kenya would be developed as
 a predominantly African state.
 This served notice on the 65,000-
 member European community that
 most of its economic, political,
 and social privileges would soon
 end.
 To date, a small minority
 of the whites--primarily the
 families on the 4,000 European
 farms--have spoken for the en-
 tire white community.   Their
 conservative policies frequently
 have not been genuinely repre-
 sentative.   This group also has
 had a disproportionate influ-
 ence--as have its counterparts
 in Rhodesia--on the formulation
 of British policy.
 The Europeans, however,
 have recently lost their exclu-
 sive right to inhabit the re-
 served highlands in Kenya. They
 will probably soon lose their
 advantage in the civil service
 pay scale, in educational facili-
 ties, in credit arrangements,
 and in agricultural regulations.
 The prospect of rule by Af-
 ricans in the next few years
 probably will decrease the size
 of the European community in
 Kenya.   Hard-core rightist set-
 tlers are likely to instigate
 incidents during this period.
 Of the 4,000 landowners, 40 per-
 cent are reportedly considering
 emigration to South Africa, 40
 percent to the Rhodesian Federa-
 tion and Commonwealth countries,
 and 10 percent to Britain.  Only
 10 percent desire to remain in
 Kenya under an African govern-
 ment.
 European Strongholds
 Algeria is one of the four
 areas in which an entrenched
 European minority appears de-
 termined to resist an indigenous
 take-over of power.   Here 1,200,-
 000 French, Spanish, and Corsican
 settlers are resisting the grow-
 ing political demands of almost
 10,000,000 Moslems,
 In Algeria, as elsewhere,
 out of the 330,000 gainfully
 employed Europeans, a small
 landed minority of about 40,000
 has exercised influence out of
 proportion to its numbers. The
 groups engaged in manufacturing,
 construction, the professions,
 and administration  are three
 times as numerous as the landed
 class, but they seldom speak
 with a united voice.   Under
 French President de Gaulle the
 settlers have suffered a rebuff,
 but their determination remains
 unshaken.   They might even con-
 sider secession from France
 rather than face the prospect
 of Moslem domination.

 nationalism is likely to lead
 to bloodshed eventually.         In

 colonization plan in Africa

 000 Africans.      However, no
 radical change in the racial
 proportions is likely because
 of Portugal's limited popula-
 tion and economic strength.
 Another crucial area   is
 the Federation of Rhodesia and
 Nyasaland,where 300,000 whites
 face almost 3,000,000 Africans.
 In the 60 years of European
 settlement, the whites  have
 maintained virtually complete
 domination, although African
 economic strength and politi-
 cal awareness are rapidly in-
 creasing.   There is a slow
 trend toward some official
 amelioration in the natives'
 status, but advocates of white.
 supremacy are supported by newly ar-
 rived settlers, and they may expect
 more backing from future immigrants
 from Kenya and the Congo.
 At a conference in London
 next October, a decision prob-
 ably will be reached concern-
 ing the  federation's readi-
 ness for independence. Britain
 faces a dilemma because of the
 increasing racial antagonism
 in the federation. Pronounced
 support for the Africans could
 lead the 220,000 whites  of
 Southern Rhodesia--and perhaps
 the 80,000 in Northern Rhodesia's
 copper-producing region--to de-
 clare for separate independence.
 On the other hand, British sup-
 port for the white minority
 would provoke African nation-
 alist disorders and might im-
 peril the federation's con-
 tinued existence in view of
 the growing native opposition
 to the white-dominated federal
 government.
 Southern Rhodesia, which
 has considerable secondary in-
 dustry, mineral wealth, and
 agricultural riches, could be
 viable as an independent state.
 Moreover, most Europeans there
 believe that if they are pushed
 too far by pro-African interests,
 Southern Rhodesia can probably
 associate itself with the Union
 of South Africa, even though
 they openly criticize the ex-
 tremism of Pretoria's racial
 policies.
 The strongest white cita-
 del is the Union of South Afri-
 ca, whose 3,000,000 Europeans
 constitute over half of all
 the whites in Africa.   There,
 both tradition and a govern-
 ment dedicated to a vigorous
 espousal of white privileges
 minimize any immediate threat
 to white supremacy.   Neverthe-
 less, the influence of the 12,-
 000,000 natives, those of mixed
 blood, and Asians is growing in
 the economic field. They  are
 increasingly doing semiskilled
 and even skilled labor, even
 though it is illegal. However,
 their political strength has
 shown no significant gain in
 recent years because of govern-
 ment repression and a lack of
 unity.
 None of the solutions for
 racial relations advanced so
 far in South Africa--e.g., de-
 velopment of separate, self-
 contained native areas--is
 either economically or political-
 ly feasible.   Because of the
 unwillingness of the Europeans
 in South Africa to compromise,
 the non-Europeans probably will
 ultimately seek a revolutionary
 solution. The English-speaking
 minority--largely engaged in
 commerce and mining--may be will-
 ing under heavy native pressure
 to give up and emigrate else-
 where.   However, the more numer-
 ous Afrikaners, descended from
 17th century Dutch settlers,
 have no ties outside of South    25X1
 Africa and are likely to resist
 any African domination by  all
 means available.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ISSUES BETWEEN COMMON MARKET AND
 Prospects   are  poor  for
 compromising the key differences
 between Western Europe's in-
 creasingly competitive trade
 groupings--the European Eco-
 nomic Community (EEC) and                       the
 European Free Trade Association
 (EFTA).   While a showdown may
 be avoided at a 29 March meet-
 ing of all countries directly
 concerned, EEC efforts to ac-
 celerate its tariff reductions
 are viewed by members of the
 EFTA as a new threat to the
 major purpose of their organi-
 zation--the establishment of a
 preferential Europe-
 wide free trade area.
 Underlying Issues
 A major objective
 of the proponents of
 the EEC is eventual
 political union.  As
 a first step toward
 this goal, the six
 members--France,  West
 Germany,  Italy, and
 the Benelux countries
 --are making important
 sacrifices of sover-
 eignty and national
 economic freedom, in-
 cluding adoption of a
 single common tariff
 against all other
 countries.  The seven
 members of the EFTA--
 Britain, Portugal,
 Switzerland, Austria,
 and the Scandinavian
 countries--are unwill-
 ing to accept the re-
 strictions inherent in
 membership in a simi-
 lar system, but they
 want free commercial
 access to the EEC, the
 largest and fastest
 growing trading area
 in the world.
 The  EFTA coun-
 tries are urging the
 EEC to link up with
 them in an association

 member states but leaving the
 original EFTA countries free
 to fix national tariffs against
 the rest of the world.   The
 EFTA maintains that the link-
 age it proposes is necessary
 to prevent political friction
 between two trade blocs and to
 discourage discriminatory EEC
 policies that would damage the
 trade of outsiders.

 economic rationale and long-
 range political aims of the
 EEC.            The United Kingdom, as a
 nexus of two trading systems
 in Europe and the Commonwealth,
 would, EEC countries argue, be
 thereby in a particularly ad-
 vantageous position to attract
 most of the heavy American in-
 vestment now flowing into the
 EEC area.
 Discriminatory practices
 against the trading interests
 of outsiders arerestrained,
 however, by the General Agree-
 ment on Tariffs and Trade
 (GATT).  A session of the GATT
 this fall will review EEC and
 EFTA conformity with its cri-
 teria, and non-European signa-
 tories will oppose any dis-
 criminatory arrangement that
 may be worked out between the
 EEC and the EFTA.
 Current Differences
 Relations between France
 and Britain were cool follow-
 ing the acrimonious breakdown
 of EEC-EFTA  negotiations at
 the end of 1958.   Some improve-
 ment is apparent,, however, as
 a result of an agreement' reached
 in the mid-January meeting in
 Paris of representatives of
 both groups and the United
 States and Canada.   It was
 agreed that the interested par-
 ties would undertake to find
 organizational and procedural
 arrangements to accommodate
 conflicting interests and as-
 sure coordinated use of free-
 world resources.  The
 tariff reductions
 scheduled to be made
 by both groups on 1
 July and the need to
 minimize the impact
 these cuts will have
 on other contracting
 parties to the GATT
 lend special urgency
 to the 29 March meet-
 ing..
 EEC Position
 An interim solution per-
 mitting coordination of tariff
 cuts and avoidance of discrim-
 ination had seemed in prospect
 following a proposal last No-
 vember by the EEC to extend on
 a reciprocal basis to EFTA and
 other GATT parties the 10-per-
 cent tariff cut EEC member coun-
 tries are scheduled to make on
 1 July.  A recent recommenda-
 tion of the EEC Commission makes
 the EEC position uncertain.
 Under the terms of this
 new proposal, cuts in tariffs
 among EEC member states sched-
 uled for this July would be
 doubled to 20 percent to satis-
 fy desires of the six, par-
 ticularly of France,for accel-
 erated consolidation of the
 EEC as a distinctive unit.  As
 a further move to speed up the
 EEC timetable, initial steps to
 establish the common external
 tariff would be advanced by 18
 months to 1 July 1960.  As a
 concession to internal and ex-
 ternal pressure for a liberal
 trade policy,  however,  it would
 be agreed to reduce eventually
 the level of this common ex-
 ternal tariff by 20 percent.
 Such a voluntary reduction
 would go a long way toward
 countering the EFTA argument.
 that linkage in a larger free
 trade area is necessary to pre-
 vent a protective EEC policy.
 France appears to be will-
 ing to go along with the proposed
 cut in the common tariff only

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 on condition that EFTA and
 other GATT countries, particu-
 larly the United States, grant
 reciprocal 20-percent cuts.
 Other forces within the'EEC,
 notably in the Netherlands and
 among West German industrial-
 ists, have strong reservations
 about both accelerated action
 and cutting the common external
 tariff.   They desire a merger
 of the EEC with the EFTA in a
 larger free trade area and are
 apprehensive that the EFTA
 might not be able to coordi-
 nate its own 1 July tariff
 reductions with those of the
 EEC so as to keep open the
 possibility of later union.
 EFTA Position
 The speed-up  proposed by
 the EEC Commission would be a
 setback for the EFTA,  limiting
 the time and scope for bargain-
 ing toward a multilateral trad-
 ing arrangement.                    British of-
 ficials profess readiness to
 accept compromise arrangements
 on the 1 July tariff cuts so
 long as they do not foreclose
 an eventual tie-up between the
 two groups, but London's free-
 dom to compromise is limited
 by demands of other EFTA mem-
 bers which,  because of their
 great dependence on trade with
 the EEC area, are pressing for
 arrangements to facilitate
 linkage in a large free trade
 area.
 Toward this end they would
 have EEC countries extend to
 the EFTA  nations   the 10-per-
 cent reduction in internal EEC
 tariffs scheduled for 1 July.
 Such an extension in addition
 to the 10-percent EEC cut of 1
 January 1969--which was made
 available to all GATT.' countries
 --would put EEC tariff reduc-
 tions in phase with those of
 20 percent to be made by EFTA
 countries on 1 July.  Tariff
 reductions coordinated only be-
 tween the two groups, however,
 would discriminate against
 other GATT countries. Member
 countries of the EFTA now con-
 strue as favoritism in support
 of the EEC the emphasis by the
 United States and Canada on
 the need to adhere to GATT'
 principles of nondiscrimina-
 tion against outside GATT par-
 ties in reaching an EEC-EFTA
 agreement.
 Subject to these internal
 pressures and external bargain-
 ing disadvantages, the EFTA
 countries decided at their
 meeting in Vienna on 11 March
 to proceed on 1 July with their
 scheduled 20-percent cut in
 tariffs against each other and
 to offer to extend this cut on
 a reciprocal basis to EEC mem-
 ber countries.
 Prospects
 In view of France's tra-
 ditional protectionism and its
 recent tendency to exploit its
 key position in the EEC for ad-
 vantages of national prestige,
 French acceptance of the pro-
 posed 20-percent cut in the
 EEC external tariff would be an
 impressive step toward multi-
 lateral trade liberalization.
 If other GATT countries,  in-
 cluding those of the EFTA, were
 to agree to such a proposal and
 to negotiate reciprocal reduc-
 tions in the GATT mechanism,
 problems relating to external
 trade relations of the EEC could
 be considerably eased.
 On the other hand, hostile
 reaction among EFTA countries
 to the EEC Commission's   pro-
 posal on, tariff reductions
 augurs ill for any arrangement
 at the 29 March meeting for co-
 ordinating future action on
 tariffs.   Sweden and Switzer-
 land see the suggested cut of
 20 percent in the common ex-
 ternal tariff, with the stipu-
 lation that it be generally ex-
 tended, as deliberately de-
 signed to undercut the EFTA and
 forestall any later merger be-
 tween the EEC and the EFTA.
 They contend that agreement on

 their part to go along with
 the proposal would prevent
 their practicing the limited
 degree of discrimination au-
 thorized by the GATT' as es-
 sential to the existence of
 a free trade area.
 It is possible that re-
 criminations may break out
 at the meeting and revive po-
 litical                                                                 controversy  between
 the  two  groupings.  In  any
 event,a renewed effort to
 find bases for a compromise
 on  coordination  of  tariff
 reductions on 1 July appears
 necessary.
