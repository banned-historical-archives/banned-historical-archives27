 ning to lose much of its validity. Pessimistic assessments in the late 1970s
 of China's prospects for military modernization grew from a lack of visible
 progress in weapons development and Beijing's reluctance to sign major
 contracts for foreign weapon systems after lengthy negotiations. This paper
 takes a fresh look at military modernization using newly available evidence
 on defense programs and cataloguing recent, notable advances in develop-
 ment and production of defense weaponry. It places China's military
 equipment modernization within the context of the overall defense modern-
 ization effort and assesses the implications for China, its neighbors, and the
 United States.
 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has begun to procure a new
 generation of conventional military weapons and equipment. Other weap-
 ons long in development have progressed to a testing or trial production
 stage and follow-on programs are already in research. None of the recently
 fielded systems is as modern as new conventional weapons in Soviet or
 Western arsenals, but they are products of China's own arms factories and
 represent a significant step forward long awaited by the Chinese military:
 ? The Army has an improved tank, an early generation antitank guided
 missile, and a new antitank rocket and is procuring more armored
 personnel carriers and other tracked systems for mechanized units. It is
 also about to receive tactical air defense missiles for the first time and is
 testing a new self-propelled gun.
 ? The Air Force is acquiring, in limited quantities, its first new fighter in
 10 years and is improving existing fighters with better avionics and
 weapons. Newer air-to-air missiles are on tap, and more advanced
 fighters are in the early stages of development and probably will not be
 available for several years.
 ? The Navy is getting a few additional nuclear-powered attack submarines,
 is improving its older diesel submarines, and is developing a diesel
 submarine that carries antiship missiles. It is also improving fleet air
 defense and antisubmarine warfare capabilities.

 The improvement in China's ability to develop and produce weapons is on
 track with Beijing's goal of self-sufficiency in defense modernization.
 Although difficulties remain, the recent successes are encouraging to
 China's military and civilian leaders, who over the past six months have re-
 newed pledges that China will remain largely independent of foreign
 sources of military hardware. In our view the Chinese will continue to
 resist importing large quantities of expensive weapons.
 We believe Beijing will still seek increased contacts with Western manu-
 facturers to gain access to advanced military technology. Beijing has shown
 renewed interest in American weapons and technology and recently
 requested US permission to purchase the F-100 jet fighter engine. We
 believe the Chinese will buy production rights for selected items, but they
 will try to avoid terms that require the purchase of large numbers of
 finished products. China will also continue to seek technology illegally and
 attempt to acquire copies of advanced Western and Soviet weapons
 through third countries.
 Although new weapons are deployed first with units opposing Soviet forces,
 they have not appreciably closed the gap between Chinese and Soviet
 capabilities. We believe China will continue to rely on its small nuclear
 force and a combination of terrain and a strategy of defense in depth as a
 deterrence to a Soviet attack.
 Because China still lacks the amphibious lift capability to take Taiwan by
 force, the current level of modernization will have little impact on the
 balance in the Strait. We believe, however, that by the early-to-mid-1990s
 newer weapons will significantly enhance China's capabilities against
 Taiwan's air and naval forces.
 The Chinese forecast no rise in military spending through 1985, but money
 probably will be available for research and development and for production
 of the small and relatively inexpensive weapons currently receiving highest
 priority. China has sharply reduced spending on procurement of older
 military equipment, and the savings can be applied more selectively to
 improved systems.

 Secret
 The speed of modernization is in large measure governed by the develop-
 ment and production process, which we believe will improve as China
 expands its experience and technology. New weapons have languished for
 years in development, and production of more sophisticated items often
 suffers from problems in quality control. In comparison with similar Soviet
 and US programs, Chinese weapons can take twice as long to get from the
 drawing board to the field.
 We believe, however, that the prospects for military modernization over the
 long term hinge to a considerable degree on Beijing's success in building up
 the economy and improving the industrial base. Military leaders appear
 resigned to current strictures on spending and on the need to improve
 civilian areas of the economy and science and technology. Barring
 significant increases in tensions, they will be forced to accept a compara-
 tively low-cost program of selective equipment upgrades through the
 current five-year plan (1981-85). As better weapons become available, and
 as the economic climate improves, we expect the PLA will increasingly
 lobby for higher defense allocations.

 China: New Weapons for the
 Conventional Forces
 Within the confines of limited resources and amid
 serious distractions, Beijing has persisted over the
 years in its stated objective of modernizing the PLA.'
 Despite their oft-repeated and long-held belief in the
 primacy of human factors in war, China's leaders also
 have increasingly emphasized in articles for army and
 party publications the importance of advanced weap-
 ons in modern warfare. There have been many diffi-
 culties that have impeded rapid progress in Beijing's
 quest for those weapons:
 ? The Chinese were slow to acquire the facilities and
 train the personnel needed for research and develop-
 ment of advanced weapons. Soviet aid in the 1950s
 concentrated on the manufacture of existing Soviet
 systems rather than on R&D.
 ? The complete loss of Soviet aid after 1960 dashed
 Beijing's hopes of getting foreign assistance in creat-
 ing a solid research foundation for the development
 of weapons for all services and led China to focus on
 strategic missile and nuclear weapon programs to
 the detriment of conventional weaponry.
 ? Pressures in the 1960s arising from the Vietnam
 war and the growing threat from the Soviet Union
 created a need to produce large quantities of older
 model, conventional Soviet weapons-relatively fast
 means of building up military strength-than to
 develop newer systems.
 ? Finally, 10 years of internal problems-school clo-
 sures, work stoppages, and violence-caused by the
 Cultural Revolution interrupted numerous defense
 projects and severely set back the education of
 scientists, engineers, and technicians.
 ' This paper focuses on the modernization of China's conventional
 military forces-the ground, air, and naval forces-which com-
 bined are a key element in the Chinese deterrence of attack across
 Strategic force development was largely protected
 from the vicissitudes of the 1960s and 1970s. The
 Chinese apparently concluded that a credible Chinese
 nuclear force that could retaliate, if attacked by
 growing Soviet and US nuclear arsenals, would bring
 more security than modern conventional forces. That
 strategy did not bring quick results, but it has given
 China a small but steadily growing force of nuclear-
 tipped missiles that the Chinese believe would survive
 a Soviet first strike. It has also led to the apparently
 successful testing of a nuclear-powered ballistic mis-
 sile submarine and the solid-propellant missile that it
 will carry. Only France, the USSR, and the United
 States preceded China in such developments (the
 United Kingdom builds its own SSBN, but buys the
 missile from the United States). For China's conven-
 tional forces, however, the trade-off has been an
 inevitable slippage in deployment of modern weapons
 and equipment.
 Deng's Program
 The calmer political atmosphere in China since Mao's
 death in 1976 and the emergence of reform leaders
 such as Deng Xiaoping have buoyed prospects for
 modernizing the conventional forces. Deng reportedly
 drew new blueprints for defense modernization in the
 mid-1970s. At a meeting of the General Staff in
 January 1975, Deng-then Chief of the General
 Staff-delivered a speech titled "The Army Needs
 Consolidation." He followed up in July with a speech
 to the Military Commission of the Chinese Commu-
 nist Party on the "Tasks in Consolidating the Army."
 An outline of Deng's program first surfaced in a party
 document, (Central Directive 18) in 1975. It set down
 a straightforward ambitious agenda:
 ? Returning the PLA to the barracks by removing it
 from the political role it took during the Cultural
 Revolution.

 Approved For Release 2009/02/02 : CIA-RDP84SO0553R000300060004-7
 ? Streamlining the forces by reducing the number of
 overaged, unfit, and excess personnel.
 ? Creating a more professional force by recruiting
 better qualified people, improving military educa-
 tion, and introducing more rigorous and sophisticat-
 ed training.
 ? Equipping the forces with improved weapons.
 The program was strongly attacked by the Gang of
 Four and scrapped. With Deng's return to power late
 in 1977, the program again became the blueprint for
 military modernization.
 Reforms
 The reforms have already begun to change the way
 the PLA looks and operates and reflect Beijing's
 commitment to a more professional, less political
 military. The political influence of the PLA has
 steadily declined since its high point in the early and
 mid-1970s. Last year, for example, the PLA began to
 turn over many of its internal security duties to the
 newly created People's Armed Police under the Min-
 istry of State Security. The General Staff has desig-
 nated special PLA training units to evaluate new
 combat tactics and has held large exercises over the
 past two years to test combined arms operations. The
 services have reopened military schools and are rais-
 ing entrance requirements to get higher quality people
 and establishing lower maximum age requirements
 for line officers. Moreover, there is a move afoot to
 reinstate military ranks-possibly as early as 1984 or
 1985. This will improve discipline and morale, and
 add to the new professional image of the PLA.
 Finally, in 1980 the PLA began to clean out its ranks
 with the goal of trimming as many as a million
 troops--mostly from service and support units.2F---
 Weapons
 The Chinese are also making headway in the more
 difficult task of improving the PLA's weapons and
 equipment. Since 1980, they have begun production of
 newer weapons, have made progress in longstanding
 developmental programs, and initiated work on more
 advanced weapon systems. Although most of these
 programs involve systems more than a decade behind
 those fielded by Western and Soviet forces, they are
 new for the Chinese military, which has had to
 depend on even older equipment
 The steadily improving pace of weapons programs for
 the PLA indicates that Beijing is firmly behind the
 defense modernization program despite the extensive
 resources that developing and fielding new military
 equipment require. In fact, the professionalization,
 training, and streamlining of the PLA assume the
 introduction of better equipment. Moreover, to guard
 against a drop in morale and to minimize complaints
 from the PLA-still a force in Chinese politics-
 Beijing needs to follow administrative reform with
 solid evidence of its commitment to rearm the mili-
 tary, even if only incrementally.
 A panoply of new or improved conventional weapons
 has begun to emerge from China's research and
 production industries.
 in Chinese weapons programs are reminders that we
 will learn of some new weapons only when they are
 tested or deployed. The trends of the modernization
 program include:
 ? Giving the ground forces, by far the largest service
 arm, the highest priority for equipment moderniza-
 tion, with the air and naval forces not far behind.
 ? Acquiring weapons to supplement or improve older
 equipment rather than replacing large, expensive
 systems on a one-for-one basis.
 ? Rather than giving the PLA a capability to project
 power, the thrust of the armaments program ap-
 pears essentially defensive, keyed to specific threats
 to China's borders.
 Despite an expanded effort to acquire new weapons,
 the Chinese still experience considerable delays in
 moving a weapon from development to deployment.

 Chinese military officials have acknowledged
 skirts for added protection, a first for Chinese tanks.
 The domestic model has a larger gun (probably 105-
 mm instead of 100-mm) with a smooth bore that can
 (that the ground forces rank
 first in the lineup for more modern weapons and
 equipment. The officials cite the need to counter
 Soviet weaponry deployed along the border as the
 prime reason for that priority. The political power of
 the ground forces, however, is almost certainly anoth-
 Clearly, the Army needs newer weapons and equip-
 ment to improve its capabilities against the relatively
 well-equipped ground and air forces of the Soviet
 Union. All 50 Soviet ground force divisions along the
 border are highly mobile, heavily armored, and have
 substantial firepower. The Soviets also have modern
 ground attack fighters and attack helicopters opposite
 China. According to Chinese Army officers, it is the
 Soviet threat that has led to putting the focus of
 ground force modernization on improving armor and
 mobility, and acquiring antiarmor and air defense
 systems.
 Newer weapons are also needed to accord with Chi-
 na's changing defense tactics. Beijing recognizes that
 the speed of advance and massive firepower of Soviet
 forces require a more aggressive defense than the
 "luring-in-deep" strategy of Mao Zedong. The new
 concept has units meeting an invasion farther for-
 ward. We believe that such troops would require a
 new arsenal of lightweight antitank and antiaircraft
 systems with enough firepower to destroy heavily
 armored vehicles and low-flying, high-performance
 aircraft. They also need additional tanks, armored
 personnel carriers, and self-propelled guns to provide
 greater firepower and better protection.
 Armor and Mechanization. Last year Beijing began
 producing a new tank designated the Type 69 (see
 figure 1). It is an improved version of the Type 59 and
 incorporates features common to tanks of the 1960s,
 most notably the Soviet T-62.
 it has a more powerful engine, better
 capabilities for firing on the move, improved radios
 and aiming devices, and night vision equipment. The
 export version-Iraq has ordered 2,000-has fender
 fire modern fin-stabilized ammunition.
 Deployment of Type 69s in China has been limited so
 far.                            only a few       25X1
 units in the north have them. This is presumably
 because of the export contract with Iraq, but Beijing
 may be awaiting further improvements on the tank
 before building it in large numbers for the PLA.
 China's contacts with Western tank manufacturers
 indicate that it is seeking ways to improve armor
 protection and the armor penetration of the tank's
 main gun.

 A new armored vehicle designed to improve battle-
 field repair of tanks also entered production last year.
 this ar- 25X1
 mored recovery vehicle has a crane, which older
 vehicles lack, permitting removal of tank engines, and
 possibly turrets, in the field. Like the Type 69-tank,

 Other tracked vehicles in production and under devel-
 opment are intended to increase the mobility of
 infantry units. Unlike the Soviet counterpart, Chinese
 infantry has little ability to move rapidly across open
 terrain or under enemy fire because troops must move
 on foot and artillery weapons must be towed into
 position. To correct this deficiency Beijing is:
 ? Adding M-1967 armored personnel carriers (APCs)
 to units in the northeast. So far each of six infantry
 and tank divisions has received a regiment of 150
 tracked APCs, which will enable troops to keep pace
 with tanks in an assault.
 ? Assigning new tracked multiple rocket launchers to
 infantry units. Utilizing the APC chassis, these
 130-mm rockets constitute a highly mobile fire
 support weapon.

 The infantry is also receiving a new lightweight
 antiarmor rocket designated the Type 70-1. This
 short-range weapon is designed as a tank-killing
 system for the individual soldier, who can easily carry
 a load of three rockets. The Chinese claim that at 150
 meters the 62-mm rocket can pierce the armor of the
 T-62 tank, except for the turret, and the side armor of
 the T-72. Used in conjunction with the longer range
 (500 to 3,000 meters) Hongjian 73 missile, this rocket
 will give units a layered defense against armored
 assaults.

 began in the mid-1960s, probably to counter the
 prevalent threat of attack by supersonic aircraft ap-
 proaching at high altitudes. With the advent of
 sophisticated terrain-following radars that allow US
 and Soviet fighters and bombers to attack at low
 altitudes and thus avoid detection, the utility of the

 The modified boat with four launch canisters was first

 missile like the Exocet would give the Chinese several
 advantages over their widely deployed Styx missiles.

 detect and defeat, its solid fuel is safer to handle than
 the volatile liquids of the Styx, and a Chinese boat

 Air Defense Weapons. The Navy is trying to overcome
 deficiencies in air defense by developing a surface-to-
 air missile and newer antiaircraft guns. The missile,
 designated CSA-NX-1, is undergoing testing. It is
 identical to the mobile landbased SAM being devel-
 oped for the ground forces. China's new frigates are
 being fitted with additional large-calibre antiaircraft
 guns and may also receive the new air defense missile
 Plans for New Ships. China is considering develop-
 ment of several new surface combatants:
 ? A new frigate using American and West German
 engines. The Chinese indicate that they plan to
 build 10 to 20 of the ships.
 ? Air cushion vehicles, the most promising of which is
 a personnel landing craft with ramps in the bow and
 stern.
 Weapon Modernization in Perspective
 The newer weapons becoming available to the PLA
 attest to the progress China is making in replacing or
 improving its vintage inventory. For example, as
 recently as five years ago, the PLA's only tactical
 missile in production was the Styx antiship missile, a
 1950s system acquired from the Soviets. The new
 guided missiles the PLA is getting will enable troops
 to damage or destroy tanks and low-flying aircraft
 and give fighter pilots better means for downing
 aircraft. And prospects are good for fielding other and
 better missiles soon. Overall, China's new weapons
 are taking the PLA away from complete reliance on
 systems discarded or rapidly disappearing from the
 arsenals of Western and Soviet forces, and they are
 leading the PLA toward warfighting capabilities that
 stress speed, mobility, quick reaction, and endurance.
 Still, modernization has come grudgingly, and the
 PLA's newer weapons are just one step ahead of those
 being replaced and are far behind capabilities of
 potential adversaries. The Chinese Sagger antitank
 missile must be guided to the target by a soldier
 operating a control stick at the point of launch. Later
 generation antitank missiles now being fielded by
 Western and Soviet forces are much less susceptible
 to human error. They require only that the firer
 maintain his sights on the target or, as in the case of

 delivered to a unit so far. Although a few infantry
 units have received regiments of armored personnel
 carriers, the vast majority of soldiers must maneuver
 on the battlefield on foot. The Navy's lack of modern
 air defenses for its warships confines it to operations
 within range of land-based aircraft. Nevertheless, by
 upgrading equipment and developing small and rela-
 tively inexpensive weapons, China can prolong the
 service life of its older, larger weapon systems.
 The speed of modernization is in large measure
 governed by the development and production process,
 which will improve as China expands its base of
 experience and technology. New weapons have Ian-.
 guished for years in development, and production of
 more sophisticated items often suffers from problems
 US programs, Chinese weapons can take twi
 to get from the drawing board into the field.
 For Self-Sufficiency
 The success of China's defense industry in turning out
 more modern weapons and equipment will encourage
 those in Beijing who argue for self-sufficiency in
 defense modernization. Soon after taking office late
 last year, Defense Minister Zhang Aiping, the most
 outspoken public proponent of self-sufficiency, stated
 that defense modernization must be tailored to Chi-
 na's specific conditions and capabilities. And in a
 major speech on the subject last March, he emphati-
 cally reiterated that theme, noting that "buying arms
 from abroad is unrealistic." In the following weeks he
 reportedly canceled a major arms contract with the
 British for naval defensive missiles and other equip-
 ment for use on destroyers. During the Sixth National
 People's Congress in June, Chief of the General Staff
 Yang Dezhi proclaimed that "We will rely mainly on
 our own efforts to improve our weaponry and equip-
 ment." The strong support for that sentiment makes it
 extremely unlikely that China will purchase major
 military weapon systems from abroad.
 On the other hand, the Chinese still want advanced
 weapon technology to help speed up programs and to
 overcome problems. They continue to contact West-
 ern arms manufacturers to discuss modern military
 hardware and obtain insights into research and pro-    25X1
 er engine.
 duction procedures. Moreover, Beijing is negotiating
 for the production rights to modern artillery from
 Belgium, has signed an air-to-air missile consultancy
 with a British firm, and is negotiating with a US
 aircraft company for assistance in modernizing the
 Y-8 military transport that just entered production.
 The Chinese also are showing strong interest in
 obtaining production rights for an advanced US fight-
 The continual improvement of China's military re-
 search and production know-how is also enabling it to
 experiment with reverse engineering of copies of

 level of defense spending for weapon modernization.

 1981 from record highs in 1979 (to pay for the
 invasion of Vietnam) and 1980 and declined as a
 percentage of overall national spending. Projections
 for the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85) suggest that
 defense: expenditures will hold at the current levels
 through at least 1985. (See figure 11.)
 The leadership of the PLA publicly supports the
 current level of defense outlays and appears to accept
 the argument that the development of the civilian
 economy must receive priority. In a recent article on
 defense: modernization, Defense Minister Zhang
 Aiping quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying, "We must
 improve our military equipment and speed moderniza-
 tion of our defenses on the basis of continuous devel-
 opment of our national economy." All of the PLA's
 department heads have endorsed this course with
 similar public statements in the past few months.
 Yang I)ezhi told PLA deputies at the recently con-
 cluded Sixth National People's Congress that "army
 building" must be subordinated to national economic
 construction as a "part must subordinate itself to the
 whole."
 Cost-cutting measures and a new source of revenue
 for defense-exporting arms to the Third World-are
 enabling the PLA to sustain the modernization effort
 within the confines of its current budget:
 ? Since 1979 the services have sharply cut procure-
 ment of older aircraft, tanks, and main naval com-
 batants (see table). In previous years procurement of
 those, systems represented as much as 40 percent of
 defense spending. The savings will allow adequate
 procurement rates of the mostly small and less
 costly weapons slated for the forces. Expensive
 weapon systems, such as the F-8 fighter, are being
 fielded at a relatively slow pace.
 ? Demobilization-as many as 20 percent of the
 PLA-is resulting in savings in payroll and housing
 costs. In addition, units have been ordered to cut
 costs by conserving fuel, limiting travel, and produc-
 ing more of their own foodstuffs.

 $4 billion. Moreover, defense plants now use excess
 production capacity to produce consumer items for
 both domestic and foreign markets. We believe a
 portion of the profits from those measures will be
 used to support weapon research and development
 and help modernize defense plants.
 For the Soviet Threat
 Although new weapons are deployed first to units
 opposing Soviet forces, they are not appreciably clos-
 ing the gap between Chinese and Soviet capabilities.
 The modernization of Soviet forces in the Far East is
 likely to outpace China's relatively modest efforts for
 the foreseeable future. We believe China will continue

 missiles and a
 combination of terrain and a strategy of defense in
 depth to deter the Soviets. The new weapons would be
 intended to raise the cost to Soviet forces attacking
 along traditional invasion corridors.
 For Taiwan
 Because China still lacks sufficient amphibious lift
 capability to take Taiwan by force, the current level
 of modernization will have little impact on the strate-
 gic balance in the Strait. Earlier CIA studies have
 concluded that China would need to build 70 to 100
 tank landing ships to pose a real invasion threat. A
 program of that magnitude would take at least five
 years and would be easily detected long in advance.
 The modernization effort, we believe, will enable
 Chinese air and naval forces to improve their capabili-
 ties by the early-to-mid-1990s (when systems now in
 research and testing are likely to be fielded in force)
 against weapons currently in Taiwan's inventory.
 Taipei, however, could overcome PRC advances by
 acquiring appropriate defensive weapons:
 ? The anticipated deployment of new Chinese fighters
 and AAMs will give the Air Force a qualitative as
 well as a quantitative advantage in the air balance.
 Taiwan, however, probably will retain its advan-
 tages in command and control and pilot training.
 ? New Chinese air-, ship-, and submarine-launched
 antiship missiles would present an increased threat
 to Taiwan's naval forces operating in the Taiwan
 Strait.
 China's recent success in fielding new weapons and
 expanding its technology base suggests that for the
 foreseeable future there will be steady growth in the
 number of products from the military research and
 production facilities. Technological limitations will
 persist, however, and continued high priority for
 strategic systems will prevent any rapid acceleration
 in modernization of the conventional forces. In the
 next few years, we believe the Chinese will:
 ? Deploy the new tactical SAM system with ground
 force units and on naval ships, field the Army's new
 self-propelled gun, and deliver the air-launched
 antiship missiles to the naval air force.
 ? Begin trial production of a radar-guided AAM and
 undertake advanced development of the Navy's
 submarine that carries antiship missiles and of an
 improved antitank missile for the Army.
 ? Initiate testing of a more advanced copy of the F-8
 fighter and a follow-on fighter, of a self-propelled
 antiaircraft system for the Army, and of an im-
 proved, Exocet-type antishi missile for the Navy.
 Longer Term Defense Spending
 China almost certainly will need to increase the
 military budget substantially in the Seventh Five-
 Year Plan (1986-90) to procure weapons now in the
 pipeline. For the time being, the lack of suitable
 follow-ons to the PLA's most expensive weapon sys-
 tems (aircraft, armor, and major naval combatants)
 will obviate a call for greater defense spending.
 Moreover, the PLA leadership's apparent acceptance

 Approved For Release 2009/02/02 : CIA-RDP84S00553R000300060004-
 of current spending levels in expectation of reaping
 benefits from overall economic improvement should
 help to prevent the military budget from becoming a
 major area of contention through 1985. After that
 time, however, the increasing number of more ad-
 vanced weapon systems available to the military will
 raise requirements for military spending, and we
 expect the PLA will increasingly lobby for higher
 defense; allocations if the economic outlook improves.
 Arms Sales
 We believe Beijing will attempt to expand on its
 success in the world's arms market to gain more
 foreign exchange, political influence, and access to
 foreign weapons. China has a reputation of supplying
 inexpensive and reliable weapons on relatively short
 notice, and its new line of weapons is likely to attract
 new customers among the less developed countries.
 Beijing may be able to exchange its new weapons for
 samples of later generation weapons or to entice
 nations not traditionally buyers of Chinese arms into
 an arms relationship and possibly greater political
 ties. For example, Beijing for the first time is training
 pilots from Zimbabwe, which is now looking to China
 as a source of weapons.
 Its new military products will certainly stimulate
 interest in new purchases among China's traditional
 customers. The Chinese have lost numerous sales
 opportunities because they lacked more sophisticated
 Technology Acquisition
 We expect China to continue aggressively seeking
 production technology that will allow the defense
 industries to leapfrog ahead and shorten leadtimes for
 the acquisition of more modern weapons. Because of
 prohibitive costs, the Chinese almost certainly will not
 place large orders for advanced weapons. But Beijing
 will seek to buy, or acquire covertly, samples of
 foreign weapons and their production technology and
 equipment. Its preference for American equipment
 notwithstanding, China is unlikely to accept older
 technology items or agree to deals for production
 technology that require purchase of large numbers of
 finished products.
