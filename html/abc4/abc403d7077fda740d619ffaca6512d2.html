SUBJECT: Briefing Book for Secretary Kissinger 
bqk Com KEATS' 
/k) 
C1 ,FAP'Er--5 
kt-t,c, ) 
We have looked over the briefing book for the Secretary's visit 
which you showed us, and--with the exception of the internal political 
paper--we consider it good work. The Sino-Soviet piece is very well 
done, and we have no problems with the two military papers. The 
articles on China's view of relations with the US and the general 
wrap-up on PRC foreign policy are also good, though we have a few minor 
criticisms which I will mention below. Our main problem is with the 
internal paper which we feel contains considerable over-interpretation. 
Rather than prepare a point-by-point critique, Chris Szymanski has 
drawn up an alternative view, which I enclose. 
In our view, one major problem with the internal paper is its 
portrayal of a Mao under attack. This seems to hinge in part on 
interpretations of the recent Water Margin campaign with which we do 
not concur and which--at the very least--are debatable. Related to 
this inaccurate picture is the portrayal of a die-hard, anti-Soviet 
Mao "digging in his heels" against presumably powerful forces favoring 
relaxation in Sino-Soviet tensions. The paper admits that these 
supposed forces cannot be clearly identified, and this is a significant 
flaw. We do not see sufficient evidence to justify the assumption that 
a sizeable number of leaders, civilian or military, currently oppose 
Mao on this issue. Admittedly, "capitulation to Soviet revisionism" was 
mentioned in connection with the Water Margin campaign, but our readings 
of the material indicate that it is "capitulation to revisionism" in a 
domestic context which is under attack and that foreign policy is not 
directly involved. Another point--Huang Hua's alleged attack on Mao's 
Soviet policy which supposedly "identified him" with "the opposition" 
is apparently based solely on comments he made a while ago to an 
academic. We find it hard to justify such sweeping conclusions on the 
basis of one reported conversation. 
Another, misimpression regards the PRC military and its role in a 
presumed debate over China's Russia policy. ("The core element arguing 
for a change in policy is almost certainly the military.") We agree 
it is logical there must be some sentiment for PRC-USSR rapprochement 
in military quarters but see no hard evidence that such feelings are 
widespread. We agree that regional military commanders were under 
attack in last year's anti-Confucius, anti-Lin Piao campaign and that

the campaign also contained attacks on persons accused of wanting 
to "sell out" the country to a foreign power. However, we saw no 
clear linkage in those debates between the former and the latter. 
The main issue for which regional commanders were under attack 
involved domestic politics and the commanders' alleged lack of 
responsiveness to central authority. 
At another point, the paper overstates the civilian-military 
rivalry in China today, That Teng's job is to "chastise, split and 
partially mollify" the military establishment is a bit too dramatic. 
This is a basic problem with the entire paper--it generally paints 
too stark a picture of the "deep cleavages" in the "body politic" and, 
through overstatement and overgeneralization, creates an impression 
that is inaccurate and too pat. 
Turning to the two other papers, the one on PRC views of relations 
with the US gives a slightly darker picture than we would paint, though 
it is generally close to the mark. The Chinese probably are more 
skeptical of the benefits of US-PRC detente now than they were two years 
ago. Certainly they worry that we are weaker today vis-a-vis the USSR 
than we were earlier, particularly before the fall of Saigon. Neverthe-
less, the PRC clearly wants Sino-US dialogue and normalization to stay 
on track. As the final sentence in the briefing paper points out, there 
is no indication whatsoever that the Chinese would want to run the risk 
of a return to their former hostile relationship with the US. As for 
the paper's contention that China is unwilling to "make many sacrifices" 
for continued good relations with the US, while the Chinese may not 
compromise on certain issues (e.g., on Tibet, the performing arts troupe, 
Mayors delegation, .etc.) they do continue to make some significant 
concessions. Not the least of these is their willingness to maintain a 
high level diplomatic relationship with us despite our continuing 25X1 
recognition of Taipei. With no other country have they tolerated si4i 
an arrangement. 
Concerning PRC intentions regarding Taiwan, the paper (and other 
portions of the briefing book) is too ominous and invites a seriously 
erroneous conclusion. 
The paper on PRC foreign policy orientation is an excellent wrap-
up of Chinese foreign policy goals. Again we think "plans 'to liberate' 
(Taiwan) perhaps within five years" gives an incorrect impression, and 
we do not believe it is "fairly certain that some important leader25X1

prefer a less abrasive relationship with the Soviets." We also 
wish the authors of the paper and of the entire book would disabuse 
themselves of the idea that the recent further deterioration in Sino-
Soviet relations can be traced to Mao's return from the provinces 
six months ago. In our view, the heightened Chinese Anti-Soviet line 
stems from events both pre-dating and post-dating the fall of Saigon, 
as well as from the changed situation in Southeast Asia brought on by 
that event.

China in 1975: The Domestic Political Situation 
The Chinese political situation in the past year has been 
characterized by a renewed emphasis on political stability, 
restructuring the government, and economic development. However, 
tension remains over such issues as succession:, rehabilitation 
of cadres purged during the Cultural Revolution, local faction-
alism, and industrial problems. Disagreement over internal 
issues continues, and will most likely compound the succession 
process, but it is not evident that the Chinese leadership has 
hardened into several competing factions. There is no reason to 
postulate that there is active opposition to Mao Tse-tung not 
solid evidence to suggest Major disagreement over foreign policy 
issues. It is unlikely that Chinese foreign policy will be 
radically altered as a result of Chou's or Mao's death. 
* * * * * * * * * * * 
With Chou En-71ai's health apparently worsening and precluding 
active involvement in state and Party matters, Vice Premier Teng 
Hslao-p'ing has emerged as China's day-to-day leader. Since the 
restaffing Of the government bureaucracy at the January National 
People's Congress: (NPC), Teng has established himself as the PLA 
Chief.-of-staff, a vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party 
and a member, of the powerful Politburo Standing Committee. .Both 
Mao and Chou have come to rely increasingly on Teng who can be 
expected to succeed Chou as Premier and play a key role in Party 
affairs after Mao's death. However, without the presence and 
support of Mao and Chou, the once-disgraced Teng could find his 
prestige and authority weakened, leading to increased leadership 
Competition 
Compounding the succession problem is the recent rehabilita-
tion of key figures purged during the Cultural Revolution who 
may or may. not be allied with Teng. With the support of Mao, a 
September: central directive called for the rehabilitation of 
once prominent pre-Cultural Revolution figures such as Chou Yang, 
Hsia yen, Yang Han-sheng, Pa Chin, and Yu Chen-fei. Paralleling 
this are persistent rumors that former Peking mayor and Polit-
buro Member Peng Chen, once accused of actively opposing Mao, 
Might be restored to a government position. To rehabilitate 
such individuals and restore thousands of other purge victims 
to important government and Party positions calls into question 
the goals and achievements of the Cultural Revolution itself. 
Many of Peking's so-called leftist leaders such as Chiang Ch'ing, 
Ya(t) Wen-yuan, and Chang Chun-ch'iao based much of their careers 
On striking down these "rightists" and "revisionists." It would 
appear that beneath the surface the "left" would be deeply 
incensed and apprehensive Over the widening circle of rehabilita-
tion. Recent appearances of the leadership seems an obvious

attempt to portray a sense of "stability and unity" at home 
and abroad. Meanwhile, local factional disputes such as the 
tumultuous Chekiang situation continue, coupled with bottle-
necks in coal and steel production as China struggles, amid 
continuing labor problems, to meet the goals of the fourth 
five-year plan. 
Despite the emphaSis on stability and economic themes in 
the past year, the Chinese leadership and particularly Map 
remain Committed to the achievement of ideological purity in 
Chinese society a potentially disruptive issue. A resurgence 
of 'revisionism" and a "restoration of capitalism" has been a 
real fear to the Chairman since the 1950's. Immediately after 
the January NPC, with its emphasis on stability and economic 
development, a ."Dictatorship in the Proletariat" campaign was 
launched to remind the Chinese populace to be on guard against 
the spread Of "bourgeois rights" and "bourgeois factionalism." 
More recently, the Criticize Water Margin campaign may be 
seen: as: part of the :historical effort by Mao to prevent the 
development of "revisionism" in China. While the initial stages 
of the Campaign in August suggested that one or more Chinese 
leaders such as Teng Hsiaop'ing, Wang Hung-wen, or even Chang 
Chun7ch'ia0 might be coming under attack, later articles and 
statements by Chinese officials suggested broader themes. The 
campaign, reportedly initiated by Mao himself, remained within 
closely guarded parameters. The evidence available does not 
indicate that Mao was under attack or that some elements were 
attempting a defense of the deposed Lin Piao. As the campaign 
broadened, its attack centered on the general issue of'."capitu-
lation to revisionism" within China (i.e., backsliding towards 
capitalism reduction of ideological commitment, etc.), rather 
than focusing on specific individuals. The campaign did not 
directly involve foreign policy issues, although fear of 
"capitulation to Soviet revisionism" did emerge as a 
minor theme in conjunction with the caMpaign. In any case, 
the campaign lost national focus after only one week of press 
attention, and the political mood shifted to the more mundane 
topics of agricultural development and the October 1 National 
Day celebration. The latter were marked by the conspicuous 
absence of the traditional October 1 editorial and the non-
appearance of Chou En-lai, who has not been seen publicly since 
September 7: amid reports of worsening health problems

sial and has achieved broad agreement lies in the reassessment

Of Chinese foreign policy and Strategic objectives in the wake 
of the Indochina, denouement. Last May the Chinese leadership 
probably undertook a broad reevaluation of China's strategic 
world position... Since then, publicly and privately the Chinese 
have expressed increased concern over possible expansion of 
Soviet influence in, the Far East and seemed to worry that the: 
Soviet "Asian Collective Security" arrangement might be more 
than a remote POSSibility. Some Chinese officials have even 
commented that China can no longer hope to avoid involvement 
in a war between the two superpowers. ,In this context, there 
has been no evidence that any group or individual Chinese ' 
leaders are actively pressing for a rapprochement with the USSR 
at this time. 
Paralleling this, 4 series of central level meetings in 
June and July resulted in a re-evaluation Of PRC defense polity. 
At 4 July meeting of the Military Affairs Commission, Teng and 
Defense Minister Yeh Chienying criticized China's army as weak 
and inefficient, A subsequent central directive, endorsed by 
Mao., called for Modernization of the air force and the navy as 
well AS streamlining the army And improving its combat readiness. 
,Such a Shift to 4 l'ac:47e conventional defense posture with less 
political involvement for the armed fortes represents the 
culmination of a process begun following the Ninth Party Congress 
in 1969 and accelerated by the Lin Pia() affair in 1971. Through-
out this past summer, little evidence emerged to suggest major 
disagreement Or 'factional disputes over these foreign policy and 
military issuei. This apparent consensus stands in contrast to 
cOntinued tension and differing policy stances over such domestic 
issues as succession, , rehabilitation Of purge victims, And the 
broader issue Of Maoism versus revisionism.

MEMORANUUM 
SuBJECT: China's View of Relations with the United States 
China continues to see the United States as a major 
piece in the international chess game, but it seems to 
be more skeptical of the immediate and tactic./ advantages 
of the relationship than perhafs it was in the 1971-1973 
Period. The Chinese at this Etat* do not seem prepared 
to see the US connection deteriorate visibly, but they 
also do not seem prepared to Oak* Vmar sacrifices to keep 
it on course. Although the Soviet Union continues to 
receive the lion's share of adverse Chinese propaganda, 
in the peat year the decibel level of anti-US rhetoric has 
risen somewhat; moreover, Peking obviously has no qualms 
in accepting such strains as the flops over the Chinese 
cultural troupe and the US mayors' delegation have produced. 
The Chinese entered into the present relationship 
with the Soviets very much in mind, and this consideration 
is still paramount in China's View of the Washington 
connect:IMO. Because of its possible salutary effect on 
Soviet attitudes the Chinese have very much wanted the 
Presidenes visit to take place. Their reading of the 
political atmosphere in the United States in the wake 
of the Vielinam debacle, however, appears to have suggested 
to them that the trip might have been deferred. To 
ensure that it took place on schedule, throughout the 
spring and Summer they were busy passing the word in 
all quarters that Mr. Ford would be welcome in China, 
that Peking considered the visit important, and that there 
were no preconditions attached to it. At the same time 
domestic audiences were being conditioned to expect little 
in the way of substantive advances In the bilateral 
relationship as a result of the trip. Specifically, 
they were informed that a breakthrough on the Taiwan 
problem lOme unlikely.

These themes have also been prominent in Chinese 
conversations with goreigners. Chinese leaders and 
diplomats have stressed that China remains patient 
concerning the Taiwan problem and that it is in no 
hurry to see the issue ricallv0A T"ri. 11142"(1-n4T" 
in

the proposition that China 
would prefer a peaceful 
resolution of the issue;

An actual attack on Taiwan would divert considerable 
military resources from China's defense against a possible 
Soviet thrust; moreover, such an attack would not only 
destroy the nascent relationship with Washington but also 
that with Japan while souring relations with Western 
Europe and scaring off the nations of Southeast Asia. 
For these reasons it is unlikely that China is actually 
contemplating a move against the island, particularly 
within the time period mentioned in the documents. 
Nevertheless, these directives and instructions may well 
represent an accommodation to those who may be arguing 
that the current relationship with Washington has brought

re cove 
an no nearer,/ 
The five-year deadline mentioned in the instruction would 
correspond with the 1980 elections in the United States 
and could mean that Chinese leaders were considering 
stepped up pressure on Washington if it appeared at that 
time that the United States was prepared to postpone 
resolutioh of the problem indefinitely. 
SignS'of frustration regarding current US attitudes 
do not appear to be confined to this bilateral issue 
but also seem to spill over into areas of greater 
ultimate importance to China. Peking seems genuinely 
concerned about what it considers to be a deterioration 
of the balance of military power between Washington and 
Moscow, The Chinese appear to believe that Washintgon's 
overall international posture is defensive, while that 
of Moscow is aggressive; they seem concerned that the 
United States is entering at least a temporary period 
of neo-isolationism and probably fear that quarrels 
between the executive and legislative branches could limit 
Washington's freedom of action. US congressmen have 
been repeatedly advised to build up the American military 
arsenal, particularly in the area of conventional weapons. 
In this connection the Chinese have generally pointed to 
the possibility of a conventional war in Europe. 
A parallel concern for the Chinese is continuing 
US efforts to cement detente with the USSR. They almost 
certainly believe that far greater. US time and energy 
is expended on furthering the Soviet relationship 
than is expended on the Chinese connection, and that this 
effort has tended to strengthen Soviet self-confidence 
while correspondingly weakening the US will to resist 
putative SoViet encroachments. They also seem to suspect 
that the executive's defense of its Soviet policy in 
the public forum and in congress tends to create "false 
illusions" both among the US public and in Western Europe. 
The current negotiations concerning Soviet purchases of 
U8 wheat, for example, are almost certainly viewed in 
Peking as an example of US "defensiveness" and willingness 
to selieve Soviet distress. Given the multifaceted 
nature of the current US-Soviet connection compared to

Peking, to be sure sees such events as the Sinai II 
agreement as,a positive development, but in the Middle 
East as in Europe it does not seem convinced that US 
staying power is very great, and the Chinese have warned 
the Egyptians and other Arabs to be prepared for a Soviet 
riposte, In any event, gains in the Middle East are 
probably offset in Chinese eyes by what they consider to 
be the deleterious effects of the Helsinki summit on the 
situation in Europe. They seem genuinely to subscribe 
to the semi:what simplistic view that at the conference 
the US gratuitously accepted the legitimacy of the Soviet 
position in Eastern Europe. 
All of this does not imply that the Chinese no longer 
see much utility in the US connection; obviously they do. 
However, Peking's recent return to the theme that'China 
must be prepared for war with the Soviets, which was in 
abeyance in the past two years, suggests that its view 
of the international scene, and by extension of the US 
connection, has darkened in the past six months or so. 
The Chine**, nevertheless, probably doubt that the factors 
they seem to believe limit DS flexibility in the international 
sphere are permanent. And in any event they clearly do 
not, at this juncture, wish to run risks even greater than 
those they now face by reactivating an unlimited quarrel 
with Washington or permitting a public breach in the 
current relationship.

MEMORANDUM 
SUBJECT: PRC Foreign Policy Orientation 
There have been no major departures in Chinese 
foreign policy over the past year, although Peking has 
continued to make adjustments in .he general diplomatic 
orientation it established in the early 1970s. In the 
Past half year there has appeared to be a growing sense 
of strain, 'Underlying China's view of its prospects ' 
abroad, to which the outcomeof the war in Vietnam, the 
Helsinki summit conference and continuing stagnation in 
its bilateral relations with the United States have 
probably ,all contributed. Despite the sometimes 
spectadulardiplomatfti gains of the early 1970s, Peking 
at this juncture does not seem pertain that it has 
achieved a Permanent and decisive breakthrough in the 
international sphere. But while there may be a growing 
sense of Pessimism in China, this mood does not yet 
appear so pronounced as to result in a major reorientation 
of policy. 
major preoccupation continues to be the 
-Soviet Un1ori. Peking continues to attempt to undercut 
Soviet po1i Wherever possible, and to consolidate its 
own influence at Nbsocies expense whenever it can. Since 
last springy however, Peking has appeared to view Soviet 
intentions With greater apprehension, showing renewed 
concern that Moscow is maneuvering to "surround" and 
isolate Chia*. ?This heightened concern seems directly 
related to the outcome of the Indochina war, which the 
Chinese Seta to believe foreshadows further diminution 
of US power in Asia and consequent opportunities for 
Moscow to pick up some of the slack, particularly in 
Southeast Asia. Since last simmer Chinese anti-Soviet

Chinese, however, have again begun to stress the possibility 
of a Soviet attack to domestic audiences, and a 
"preparations for war" movement reminiscent of that of  
1969-72 appears to be beginning./ 
a decision was apparently taken to streamline and 
modernize the Chinese force structure over the next 
several Years; this decision was justified in terms of 
the necessity to fend off a putative Soviet attack. 
Bilateral relations between the two powers remain 
frozen, and both have claimed that there are no prospects 
for early improvement. The Chinese, moreover, have recently 
begun to raise in public issues of considerable sensitivity 
to Moscow. , They have begun to refer to the Soviet 
helicopter they downed in northwest China for the first 
time since shortly after its crew was captured in mid-March 
1974, and in a speech early this month a member of the 
Chinese Politburo raised the spectre of a Soviet attempt 
to stir up trouble among the ethnic minorities in Sinkiang 
province. The annual Sino-Soviet river navigation talks 
(which normally deal with such mundane matters as the 
setting of navigational buoys in the Ussuri and Amur 
rivers) were skipped this year because of Chinese 
insistence that the discussions would have to include 
larger issues. The border talks in Peking remain 
deadlocked and are currently in recess. 
Signs continue to surface in China from time to time 
that the issue of the proper relationship with Moscow is 
a contentious one in the upper reaches of the regime. It 
seems fairly certain that at least some important elements 
in the Chinese leadership would prefer a less abrasive 
relationship with the Soviets, but it is impossible to 
judge how widespread this sentiment is. In any event, 
it is likely that some at least consider the issue less 
as a serious policy question than as a means of scoring 
points off possible opponents in the jockeying for power 
now taking place in Peking. In fact, relations with 
Moscow have probably deteriorated rather than improved 
over the past six months--that is, since Mao returned 
to the capital after a long sojourn in the provinces. 
Chinese concern that Moscow might succeed in isolating 
and "surrounding" China has clearly conditioned Peking's 
approach to relations with North Korea. In the past

year China hag supported Pyongyang's position on 
reunification and withdrawal of US forces from the 
peninsula and on related issues in the United Nations 
far less equivocally than was the case in the early 
1970s. Kim Il-song's visit to China last spring and the 
recent visit of Politburo member Chang Chun-chiao to 
Korea clearly was meant to underline the closeness of 
the present relationship?from China's point of view at 
least--at the expense of Moscow. This unabashed 
cultivation of Pyongyang has paid off to some degree. 
For the past year the Koreans have not bothered to edit 
out anti-Soviet remarks by Chinese leaders when replaying 
their speeches in Korean media. Moreover, by identifying 
closely with Chinese support for Prince Sihanouk and 
with the Chinese position On Cambodia generally the 
Koreans have appeared to endorse--by implication at 
least?Ching-Se attempts to circumscribe Soviet influence 
in Indochina. "Wang's cultivation of Pyongyang 
underscores its belief that it is playing for high stakes 
in Korea and that its vital interests are involved in 
the attempt to ensure a lesser degree of Soviet influence 
on the peninsula than it seems to believe now exists in 
Indochina. 
concerns about Soviet machinations also condition 
Peking's relations with Japan, but in this case China's 
fears are clearly exaggerated. The Chinese game here 
is to keep Moscow off balance and to throw as many 
roadblocks as Possible in the development of closer 
Japanese-Soviet relations. In any assessment of the 
possibility of expansion of Soviet influence in Asia, 
Japan obviously assumes an important place in Chinese 
eyes, and Peking's hardening on the issue of the anti-Soviet 
"hegemony clause" in the proposed Sino-Japanese treaty 
of peace and ,friendship roughly paralleled the denouement 
in Indochina. The Chinese clearly see the issue as a 
litmus test Of current Japanese attitudes toward Peking 
and Moscow respectively, and crude Soviet pressure on the 
Japanese to resist inclusion of the clause in the treaty 
certainly raised the stakes for the Chinese. Moreover, 
Peking is apparently more suspicious of Mai than it was 
of the amiable Tanaka, and this suspicion doubtless was 
reinforced by what the Chinese clearly regard as Japanese 
backtracking from the position Tokyo adopted when relations 
were established in 1972.

? However, despite the continuing difficulties over 
the hegemony clause, Peking is certainly not prepared 
to write off Tokyo. The Chinese took a relatively 
relaxed view of Jap'anese arrangements allowing for 
resumption of air traffic to Taiwan and Chiao Kuan-hua 
showed considerable flexibility in exploring face-saving 
formulas to resolve the hegemony issue in his recent 
talks with Miyazawa in New York i Economic relations 
between the two countries remain strong, and the Chinese 
have largely kept the negotiations on the peace treaty 
isolated from other aspects of bilateral relations. 
PliyataWa's talks with Chiao were characterized as the 
most extensive and productive discussions between the two 
countries since relations were established. 
Peking continues to go through the motions of 
searching for a gesture that would lead Taipei to enter 
into meaningful talks on the future of the island--the 
latest such gesture was the release of a considerable 
number of "agents" who had been captured while infiltrating 
the mainland in the 1960s, but it clearly does not expect 
a response from ,the Nationalists. In fact, the Chinese 
mood with respect to the Taiwan problem has darkened 
somewhat in the past few months. Teng Hsiao-ping 
continues to tell foreign visitors that Peking is prepared 
to wait for quite some time before the resolution of the 
problem and can afford to do so, but internal audiences 
are now being warned that there is a strong possibility 
that Nationalist leaders--in particular Chiang Ching-kuo 
himself?will attempt to reach an accommodation with 
Moscow. At the same time the populace is apparently being 
told that China's military establishment has been 
instructed to draw up plans to "liberate" the island, 
perhaps in five year's time--that is, by the time of the 
1980 elections in the United States. 
It is unlikely that the Chinese leadership rates 
the possibility of a rapprochement between Moscow. and 
Taipei as highly as these internal instructions 'would 
suggest, or that, given China's problems with its northern 
neighbor, it would be willing to divert the major military 
resources required for a conquest of the island while 
at the same time ensuring a disruption of its relations 
with Washington and the creation of major problems in 
its relations with Western Europe, Japan and the countries 
of Southeast Asia. However, the new instructions may

represent e 00nCession to elements in Peking who may be 
arguing that China's current foreign policy line has not 
brought reunification of the island with the mainland 
significantly closer. It is probably no coincidence that 
the Chinese Populace is also being told not to expect a 
major breakthrough on the Taiwan issue as a result of 
President Ford's upcoming visit to China. 
In contrast, the Chinese undoubtedly consider 
Southeast Asia an area where they have made some progress 
in the past year. Thai recognition followed quickly on 
that of the Philippines; both moves were clearly a gain 
for Peking, bUt,it almost certainly does not expect 
either Indonesia or Singapore to follow suit any time 
soon. China is Continuing to offer material aid to the 
insurgencies in Burma and Thailand and to offer moral 
support to insurrectionaries in Malaysia and the Philippines, 
but its current emphasisis clearly on state-to-state 
relations. Ne, Win, for example, will visit China later 
this year. wpart of their effort to draw the nations 
of Southeast Asia closer to Peking, the Chinese are 
emphasizing the potential threat from the USSR--an 
expansionist superpower with vast if undefined designs on 
the region. These scare tactics undoubtedly reflect 
genuine Chinese concerns, but Peking is also very much 
aware of the utility,of this line of argument in 
creating a bond of common concern with the countries 
in the area. A similar mix of genuine concern and tactical 
considerations lies behind Peking's parallel claim 'that 
the Southeast Asian nations have much to fear from Hanoi 
but little to fear from China; this second argument is 
likely to fall on fertile soil and already has had a. 
positive effect in building a new relationship with 
Thailand. At this juncture the Chinese clearly see a 
period of relative stability in the region to be in their 
interest; they remain relaxed on the question of US 
bases in Thai/and and the Philippines, both with Thais 
and Filipinos and with third parties. 
In contrast, Peking does not appear to be relaxed  
about relations with Vietnam;. 
While the Chinese view of Soviet influence in Hanoi is 
undoubtedly exaggerated, Peking certainly does believe 
that Moscow has the inside track in Vietnam?,-a? view that 
is apparently shared by the Soviets theinselves. Even

apart from pRtative Soviet influence in Hanoi, the Chinese 
appear to consider Vietnam a relatively well-armed, 
potentially expansionist and generally troublesome close 
neighbor, and it seems prepared to take the lead in 
keeping Hanoi in check. Chinese relations with Cambodia 
are apparently being cultivated with an eye to both 
Moscow and Hanoi without very much regard for Vietnamese 
sensibilities, and Peking has been telling its populace 
in south China that a dispute with Hanoi over the common 
border is developing. It has also instructed its diplomats 
to admit to differences with Vietnam if asked, and it is 
apparently preparing to emphasize publicly its claims in 
the South China Sea through a slogan calling for "liberation" 
of the Spratly Islands, many of which are occupied by 
Vietnam. 
The Chinese undoubtedly recognize the disadvantages 
of an open breach with Hanoi, however, and it is not yet 
clear how far they are Prepared to push their differences. 
If the recent visit of Le Duan to China was designed to 
patch up the developing quarrel, it does not seem to have 
achieved this and. There are indications that the 
Chinese were fairly niggardly in their aid offers, and 
the VietnaMese left without the publication of a joint 
communique and without entertaining the Chinese at the 
customary farewell banquet. The Chinese seem relatively 
relaxed about Vietnamese and Soviet influence in Laos, 
however, claiming that Lao xenophobia will eventually 
reduce the role of both Hanoi and Moscow in that country. 
Relations with India, like those with the USSR, 
remain frozen. The Chinese seem somewhat more relaxed 
about the Himalayan border kingdoms than they did a year 
ago, but they are certain to consider Mrs. Gandhi's 
"legal coup" a good indicator that relations with Delhi 
will remain strained for some time to come. Peking is 
apparently unwilling to provoke India--it may have possible 
Indian moves in the Himalayas in mind--and it has 
reported the developments in Delhi in low key, but the 
Chinese are probably pessimistic about a significant 
improvement of their position on the subcontinent. They 
undoubtedly take satisfaction both in the coup in Dacca 
and in their subsequent establishment of relations with 
Bangladesh?Chiao Kuan-hua played a major part in the 
Bangalee-Pakistani negotiations which paved the way for 
the latter development, but Peking is not likely to

believe these gains greatly alter the balance of power on 
the subcontinent and may even fear that Delhi will be 
tempted to intervene in Bangladesh in order to restore 
the status quo ante. The Chinese continue to cultivate 
the Pakistanis" and are perhaps more relaxed about the 
situation in Afghanistan than they were a year ago. 
Peking continues to see Iran as the key to its Middle 
East policy and is persisting in its low-key wooing of 
Teheran. The Chinese have told the Iranians that they 
welcome improvement of Iran's relations with Iraq, but 
they consider Syria far more important to the balance of 
forces in the area than Baghdad and have urged Teheran to 
forge ties to Damascus in order to draw Syria away from 
Moscow. The Chinese are clearly pleased with the Sinai II 
agreement and have told the Egyptians as much, in particular 
commending Sadat for his open criticism of the Soviets. 
Peking is not especially optimistic that anti-Soviet 
momentum in the area can be maintained, however. The 
Chinese appear to fear Syrian intervention in the Lebanese 
situation, and they seem to think that Moscow may attempt 
to play the Palestinian card, arming and encouraging the 
fedayeen. To cover their flank they continue to refuse 
to write off the Palestinians entirely and they continue 
to offer them verbal support in the United Nations and 
other forums. China's current interest in the Gulf states 
does not appear to be especially high. As they have since 
late 1973, however, the Chinese conianue to endorse the 
actions of OPEC. Nevertheless, they seem unable to 
reconcile their position on this matter with arguments 
that rises in the price of oil tend to harm the economies of 
the Western European and Third World states, and have 
generally responded to such arguments with embarrassed 
evasions. 
In general. the Chinese continue to make what they 
consider the proper noises with respect to Third World 
issues. Much of this rhetoric, however, is just that; 
in practice Chinese actions remain cautious. Historically, 
Chinese interest, in the underdeveloped nations has been 
highest when Peking has been unsure of its position in 
the international arena. Attention to the Third World 
in the past two years is probably a reflection of current 
uncertainty, In the past year some strains--none thus 
far overwhelming-..have developed in China's relations 
with several -African states which Peking has been

cultivating for some time. Last summer the Chinese were 
at odds with Zaibia over Kaunda's desire to achieve a 
solution to the Rhodesian problem in concert with South 
Africa. The Chinese pressed for an insurrectionary policy 
and argued vigorously against cooperation with Pretoria--
a position they doubtless thought would keep their 
revolutionary credentials untarnished without much cost. 
Peking is also almost certainly concerned about gains by 
the MPLA in Angola, but thus far they have not protested 
a Tanzanian decision to embargo Chinese arms shipments to 
Holden Roberto's rival MLA. 
Chinese interest is much more directly focused on 
Europe, which continues to remain the central factor in 
Peking's rhetorical and rather apocalyptic public 
analysis of the international scene. China continues to 
cultivate nearly all of the West European states; streams 
of visitors, both officials in office and opposition 
leaders, have visited China in the past year. Both 
Franz-Joseph Strauss and Edward Heath have recently 
completed second visits to Peking; Teng Hsiao-ping visited 
France last spring--his only official visit other than to 
the United Nations since his return to power in 1973. The 
burden of the Chinese message to the Europeans remains 
constant: Unremitting vigilance is necessary to frustrate 
Soviet designs on Europe. This message in only slightly 
different form is being passed to the maverick nations 
in Eastern Europe as well. Official Romanian delegations 
to China have all but tripped over each other in the past 
two months, and the Yugoslav premier is currently in China--
the first Yugoslav premier to make the journey. At the 
welcoming banquet for Bijedic, Teng Hsiao-ping unabashedly 
raised the spectre of a Soviet attack on Yugoslavia 
following Tito's death, occasioning a Soviet walkout. 
Chinese importunings in Europe are obviously undertaken 
with an eye toward Moscow, in the hope that if the Soviets 
become more preoccupied with their western flank they will 
have less energy and inclination to concentrate on problems 
in the east. Peking's interest in Europe, however, is not 
simply tactical; they seem genuinely concerned that Moscow 
is gaining a freer hand there. In this regard, the recent 
Helsinki summit unquestionably increased Chinese anxieties. 
Although they have not devoted as much propaganda attention 
to the meetinq at; they have to some other issues, the 
Chinese almst certainly believe that the conference tended

to legitimize the SoViet position in Eastern Europe while 
presenting Moscow with opportunities for political 
advances further west. The publicity surrounding the 
signing ceremony and the fact that the meeting was held 
at the summit level probably reinforces this line of 
Chinese analysis and may have increased Peking's current 
sense of relative isolation and vulnerability.

OCX No. 1025/75 
SUBJECT: The Domestic Political Situation in China 
China has damped down the political ferment so 
evident last year and has made some progress toward 
defining a new structure of power in anticipation of 
the death of Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai. Last 
January's National People's Congress (NPC) restaffed 
the governmental apparatus and probably defined the 
political roles of several leading figures more clearly. 
However, deep cleavages remain in the body politic, 
evidencad by Continuing unrest in several provinces, 
strikes in trial sector, and the emergence 
of a new calopm, .tieising the 14th century novel 
"Water Ma At this juncture political problems 
do not seem to hIVe. gotten out of hand, as they may 
have done in the spring of 1974, but despite repeated 
calls for "stability and unity," that goal has not yet 
been achieved in a meaningful sense. 
Chinese politics continue to be dominated by the 
succession question. This is a problem of at least ten 
years standing, but in many respects it is still 
unsolved. 00keYing for position is more muted than 
last year, but it obviously continues just below the 
surface of events. Major political fault-lines remain 
a split between left and right within the party and a 
cleavage between civilians and important elements 
within the military. Within these major groupings 
personal olive's and political shadings almost certainly 
also exist. Despite the obvious gains associated with 
the NPC and its ancillary meetings, Vice Premier Teng 
Dsiao-ping recently admitted to a group of New Zealand 
journalists that the succession, when, it occurs, is 
likely to be troubled.

Teng himself has been a major gainer over the past 
year. As PLA chief-of-staff, he now holds a major 
position within the military hierarchy; he is in addition 
a vice chairman of the party and a member of the powerful 
Politburo Standing Committee. He is clearly slated to 
succeed Chou as premier and already runs China on a 
day-to-day basis. Over the past year Chou has remained 
a highly influential figure behind the scenes, but his 
recent relapse has almost certainly placed him on the 
sidelines for the moment. He could partially recover 
from his present illness, as he did late last year, but 
continuing bouts of illness are likely to make his role 
? in decision-making a constantly diminishing one. His 
death, however/ would not be as traumatic for China as it 
would have been a year ago or in an earlier period. 
Indeed, the regime can count as a major success its 
management of the transition from Chou to Teng of primary 
administrative Authority. 
Although Tang's central responsibilities are 
governmental, he has long been an advocate--and a symbol--
of party supremacy in the management of the state. As 
his political fortunes have risen, not surprisingly the 
institutional balance of power within the regime seems to 
have shifted somewhat toward the party, partially at the 
expense of the military. The "rehabilitation" of party 
aParachiki disgraced during the Cultural Revolution has 
been going on for some tine, but it seems to have 
accelerated since the NPC, and has included an increasing 
number of controversial party figures who were major 
targets of the 1966-1969 upheaval. Most of these figures 
have been close associates of Teng, and many have been 
reappointed to the very jobs they held prior to the 
Cultural Revolution. Revitalization of the party is far 
from complete, however. The important Central Committee 
secretariat, which went into limbo early in the Cultural 
Revolution, has not yet resurfaced. Moreover, given his 
close association with arch-villain Liu Shao-chi before 
that "revolution" and his own fate during the upheaval, 
Teng is a far more controversial figure than Chou En-lai 
has ever been. 
As an advocate of the "rehabilitation" process and 
as the primary beneficiary of that policy, Teng is almost 
certainly regarded by the left wing of the party with 
some antipathy and apprehension. Signs of opposition 
to him have surfaced from time to time in domestic 
propaganda, and an attack on the "rehabilitation" policy

appeared ?to be a major theme in the 'initial propaganda 
associated 4ith the campaign criticizing "Water Margin." 
But the left 'does not appear to be doing well at this 
juncture. 
This is particularly true of the chief spokesman 
for that wing of the party, Chiang Ching, who appears 
to have been eased out of her sensitive position as  
overseer of Cultural and educational affairs.  
A recent directive, endorsed by the 
Chairman, which rehabilitates a considerable number of 
cultural bureaucrats who were major targets of the early 
Phases of the Cultural Revolution is still another 
political body blow to Chiang Ching. In fact, the 
symbolic importance of several of the cultural bureaucrats 
is such that their restoration to grace tends to undercut 
the entire rationale of the Cultural Revolution itself. 
The legitimacy of the 1966-1969 upheaval still 
remains a political issue in China, and one in which 
Mao's own prestige is engaged. But he now may be prepared 
to suffer losses on this score in order to make gains 
in other quarters. The newly-rehabilitated cultural 
figures were advocates of literary policies which the 
Chairman opposed for many years, but those policies 
include an effort to create a more popular and less 
overtly propagandistic cultural milieu. Mao may hope 
to broaden the base of support for policies he currently 
considers to be of overriding importance by cultivating 
China's influential intelligentsia. Moreover, some of 
these newly-rehabilitated bureaucrats are close personal 
friends of Tang Hsiao-ping. Mao now seems prepared to 
rely on Teng and on the strength the vice premier commands 
through his ties and contacts in the party and government 
apparatus even if this means giving way on minor policy 
issues and tolerating personnel appointments he might 
abjure in ideal circumstances. This approach roughly 
parallels that which he took with Lin Pia? and Chou

? It may well be that at this ptiifit the Chairman 
feels it necessary to co-,opt strength where he can find 
it. The peat year does not seem to have been an easy 
one for him. The'problem of the succession is as much 
on his mind as it is on the minds of his subordinates,

and he appears to be far from certain that the policies 
he has been pushing most strongly -for the past several 
years--in particular unremitting opposition to the Soviet 
Union--will be pursued with equal vigor after his death. 
Circumstantial evidence suggests that he would have 
preferred last year's anti-Confucius campaign to have 
continued somewhat longer than it did--perhaps until it 
had claimed several significant victims. There were 
almost certainly aspects of last January's National 
People's Congress about which he was unhappy--his absence 
from the congress and the party meeting immediately 
preceding it was a telling and unmistakable gesture of 
disassociation. More interestingly still, Mao in the 
past year Seems to have been subject to personal criticism 
unparalleled since the difficult days following the 
collapse of the Great Leap Forward. 
This criticism has not been widespread or concerted, 
but it is obviously significant. The Chairman appears to 
have been vulnerable on two counts. On the one hand, 
he has been accused of choosing his lieutenants (particularly 
Lin Piao) unwisely, of shifting domestic policies 
erratically, and of undermining the prestige of the regime 
by encouraging the ferment associated with the Cultural 
Revolution and the anti-Confucius campaign. On the other 
hand, Mao has also been accused ,of being too rigid in his 
opposition to the Soviet Union. One of those making this 
charge was Huang Hua, China's ambasSador to the United 
Nations. Finally, a. call to criticize the Chairman on 
unspecified grounds appears to have been embedded in at 
least one of ttis initial articles associated with the 
"Water Margie campaign. 
Mao seems to have readted to this criticism in 
two ways. AS, noted above, he appears to have attempted 
to mollify and co-opt his critics on the right by 
further disassociating himself from his wife and from 
the Cultural Revolution itself. These moves undoubtedly 
have net sat well with the left wing of the party, and 
the cry to oppose the "emperor" which sounded at the 
outset of the "Water Margin" campaign was probably a 
leftist reaction to them. On the other hand, Mao has 
continued to dig in his heels on the issue of opposition 
to the USSR. He is obviously obsessed on this subject 
and is probablY prepared to sacrifice a good deal to 
gain his way on this issue, 
25X1

No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/07/22: LOC-HAK-469-16-1-3 25X1 
The suggestions that Mao was overly rigid on this 
question surfaced shortly after the National People's 
Congress, and it is entirely possible that the Chairman 
came under some pressure to modify his Soviet policy at 
the congress and in the months preceding it. It would 
appear, however, that he has subsequently attempted to 
turn the tables on his critics. The key moment may have 
occurred last spring when, after nine continuous months 
in the provinces, Mao suddenly reappeared in Peking. His 
reappearance in the capital coincided almost exactly with 
the fall of South Vietnam, and it is likely--although 
direct evidence is lacking--that the Chairman seized on 
this event to argue that the Soviets, with greater 
influence than China in Hanoi, were in a good position 
to "surround" and isolate China--and that consequently 
his policy of unyielding opposition to Moscow was the only 
reasonable course to follow. Subsequent events--Moscow's 
renewed interest in an Asian security pact, Mrs. Gandhi's 
"legal coup" in India, and large-scale Soviet exercises 
in Siberia--could only have reinforced this argument. 
In any event, following Mao's return to Peking Chinese 
propaganda against Moscow hardened noticeably, relations 
with Hanoi deteriorated markedly, Peking grew more rigid 
on the issue of the anti-hegemony clause in the proposed 
Sino-Japanese treaty of peace and friendship, and for 
the first time in two years Peking began to stress the 
possibility of a Soviet attack on China to domestic 
audiences. 
If these signs represent a tactical victory for the 
Chairman, there is no indication that the fundamental 
issue has been resolved. Chinese propaganda continues 
to inveigh against possible backsliding and eventual 
compromise with .Soviet "revisionism." Low level Chinese 
cadre are being officially told that the "Water Margin" 
campaign is designed to immunize the country against this 
possibility, and in fact the emphasis on the propaganda 
connected with the campaign has shifted from an initial 
attack on the evils of "amnesty"--i.e. rehabilitation--
to the terrors of "capitulationism," a shorthand phrase 
for compromise with Moscow. While this strongly suggests 
that the debate has not been still-ed, the propaganda 
presents the possibility of Chinese leaders knuckling 
under to Moscow not so much as a clear and present danger, 
as was the case during the anti-Confucius campaign, but 
rather as a danger in the period after Mao's death.

It is, however, much easier to identify the outlines 
of the debate on the issue of relations with Moscow than 
to identify specific individuals who may be arguing for 
a less antagonistic policy toward the Soviets. Those 
Chinese officials who have commented on opposition to 
Mao's rigid approach to this issue have suggested that 
this opposition included a number of disparate elements; 
the fact that Huang Hua appeared to identify with the 
opposition suggests that at least some members of the 
foreign ministry may question current policy--not 
surprisingly, since diplomats would be likely to see the 
disadvantages of unrelenting antagonism to Moscow in 
the context of the Sino-US-Soviet triangular relationship. 
But the core element arguing for a change in current 
policy is almost certainly the military. Traditionally 
the PLA, or at least some portions of it, have seen 
advantages in a greater degree of cooperation with 
Moscow; both Of China's former defense ministers, 
Peng Te-huai and Lin Piao, were accused of preparing 
to "sell out" to the Soviets. moreover, propaganda 
connected with the anti-Confucius campaign, while not 
identifying specific individuals, seeted to indicate that 
opposition to current policy was centered among the powerful 
regional military commanders. 
For Mao the military may be an obsession second only 
to the Soviet issue itself. He has many reasons to 
distrust important elements in the military hierarchy, 
particularly the regional commanders. They tended to 
play their own power game during, the Cultural Revolution, 
and a number of them may have sat on the fence during the 
Lin "coup" ,crisis in 1971. The power of these men and 
of many Of their subordinates has declined in the past 
several years, but--significantly-,-zone has suffered 
ultimate political disgrace, despite the major assault 
on them mounted during the anti-Confucius campaign. In 
fact, several commanders who remained under a political 
cloud Wore apparently restored 10 good standing at 
a major mset?ig of military leaders in Peking early last 
suOmer. 
This meeting seems to have been of major importance, 
and the decisions that have flowed, from it smack strongly 
of compromise. Individual commanders were given a clean 
bill of health, but the military establishment as 
a whole was satjected to a new assault, initiated by Mao,

by Defense banister Yeh Chien-ying and by Teng Hsiao-ping. 
All charged that the military was flabby, inefficient and 
overly concerned with political action at the expense 
of military preparedness, the remedies prescribed were 
streamlining, specialized military training and modernization 
of the military Plant. Taken together, the assault and 
the remedy are likely to further diminish the army's 
prestige, reduce its active political role and to make it 
more responsive to centralized political direction. At 
the same time the prospect of specialized training and 
modernization are likely to make a powerful appeal to 
those elements of the military who have long argued for 
greater efficiency and professionalism; this group suffered 
a mslative eclipse in influence during the Lin Piao era. 
Significantly, the appeal for greater professionalism 
was made in the context of the need to prepare for a possible 
Soviet attack on China. 
This line, which, as noted above is being fed to the 
general populace as well, represents a departure from 
that which was dominant last year, when Chinese propaganda 
appeared to argue that neither compromise with the Soviets 
nor a step-up in development of advanced weapons was 
necessary since MOSCOW was planning to attack in the 
WeSt, not the East. Although the possibility of a Soviet 
attack is now conceded, the issue of advanced weapons 
procurement is carefully avoided in the document which 
sets forth the decisions of last summer's military 
conference. Recent propaganda indicates, however, that 
while modernization of China's conventional weapons 
armory is contemplated, no crash advanced weapons program 
is likely to be undertaken. This essentially is the 
"Maoist" position established in last year's anti-Confucius 
debates. 
This half-a-loaf policy coupled with the effort 
further to diminish the PLA's prestige undoubtedly does 
not recommend itself to at least some elements within 
the military. Indeed, the issue of the army's prestige 
was raised directly in several articles connected with 
the opening phase of the "Water Margin" campaign; these 
articles harked back nostalgicly to the palmy days of 
Lin Pia? and appeared to defend and praise Lin for the 
glory he reflected on the army. Like the apparent 
leftist harping on the "amnesty" issue which occurred 
at the same time, these articles suggest that China's

current political "outs"--the left and the military--
attempted tol capture the new campaign, much as they 
attempted tO divert the anti-Confucius campaign in the 
spring of 1974. An authoritative People's Daily editorial 
on September 4, however, appeared to turn back this 
challenge, and the campaign has subsequently subsided 
into a relatively low-key affair. 
In the complex attempt to chastise, split and 
partially mollify the military establishment, Teng 
Heiao-ping is undoubtedly playing a major role. His 
relationship t? the soldiers, like his relationship to 
Mao, is ambiguous: he acts as their civilian overseer 
and taskmaster, but he is also more acceptable in this 
role than many other civilian leaders. Teng undoubtedly 
hopes to secure the support of significant military 
elements during the succession period, and he has been 
inserting men, -close to him in important posts within the 
central military hierarchy, some in the Political 
Department headed by the army's other civilian overseer--
and Tong's Potential rival?sChang Chun-chiso. 
Teng, bOANover, has constituencies other than the 
army to consider. He is, for eXample, playing an 
important part in the drive to develop and modernize 
China's economy--a drive which the low-keyed "bourgeois 
rights" campaign initiated early this year seems designed 
to support. He is also deeply involved in a recent effort 
to mechanize Chtnese agriculture. Both these efforts 
are likely to absorb a significant portion of China's 
limited budget, leaving less for a resentful military. 
Moreover, the conservative cast of these policies is 
likely over time to generate counterpressure from the 
now-eclipsed left, which still has deep roots in the 
political soil. In short, the potential for powerful 
strains which could pull apart the collegial leadership 
slated to share power after the demise of Mao and Chou 
is already present?and most of the major domestic 
problems of the past decade still remain largely unsolved. 
A period of prolonged division in Peking could very 
largely immobilize China both at home and abroad before 
the eventual emergence of a younger and presumably more 
technically oriented leadership group.

1. Peking has the largest conventional armed forces 
in the world and a small, but growing nuclear capability. 
China's army, navy, and air force have a combined total 
of more than four million men. These forces maintain 
largely a defensive posture. Peking reportedly intends 
to streamline and modernize its armed forces in order 
to improve their combat effectiveneSs. 
2. The Chinese army currently has approximately 
three and a half million men in main, local, and support 
forces backed up with 6000 tanks and assault guns and 
14,000 pieces of field artillery. Most of the main 
forces are organized into 37 armies. Nearly half of the 
Chinese ground forces are nowconcentrated in the four 
military regions which border the Soviet Union. 
-Following a meeting of the party military 
commission in,July, Peking distributed a new 
central directive which calls for reducing 
the armed forces in size and giving increased 
emphasis to specialized units. 
the only evidence that Peking might be imple-
menting this directive has been an increase in 
naval training.

6. Before 1969 the major threat perceived by 
Peking was an attack from the sea by the US and/or 
the forces of the Republic of China. But after the 
Sino-Soviet border clashes of 1969 (the Damansky Island 
incident most notably) Peking was increasingly concerned 
with the threat of attack by the USSR. Accordingly, those 
in charge of defense planning were forced to rethink 
their defensive concepts and to reorient the armed 
forces to meet these new conditions. 
7. They wasted little time. By mid-1970, five 
armies were repositioned northward--three armies rein-
forced the immediate border regions and two armies 
became part of the augmented strategic reserve forces 
in the Wuhan Military Region. Concurrently, units were 
reoriented within the border regions to defend against 
a Soviet attack. 
--Illustrative of these deployments is the 
fact that prior to 1969 there were six 
armies in the Peking Military Region--five 
? in the north China Plain and one in reserve. 
--Sy 1970 the force had been increased to nine 
armies. Two army groups of three armies each 
were positioned in the mountains north of the 
capital with one army group in reserve.

and the long term--had become the dominant factor in 
Chinese strategic planning. BY the time the Chinese

"a reduction of the degree of hostility" would be more

2. Strategically, the Chinese:are 
less concerned 
about the possibility of an iinent Soviet attack than 
they were in 1469. Although they have recently briefed 
cadres on the probability of China being involved in any 
future US-U war, they still take the position that the 
main Soviet threat is to the West and that a US-USSR war 
is the most likely, form of war. 
-.The line that China probably would be involved 
? in a new world war is not new: the Chinese 
have said, and continue to say privately, that 
a Major Soviet attack in the East would involve 
Mims (after involving the US and Japan). 
-The Chinese are still .avoiding aggressive 
Patrolling along the Sino-Soviet border, which 
ebained free of fire-fights ever since 
the Chinese agreed to.resmte border negotiations

Soviets by resuming such patrolling or by 
withdrawing from the border negotiations. 
A continuation of the negotiations stale-
mate seems to be the prospect for the near 
fUture. 
An increasingly active concern is the Chinese 
fear that the Soviets might further "encircle" 
(POUng's word) China by attaining bases in 
Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia as 
the US reduces its presence. 
3. The Chinese despite the events of April 1975 in 
Indochina, still view the US as the only counterweight 
to the USSR globally. They seem willing to acquiesce in 
a continued up military presence in the Far East (other 
than in the Special case of Taiwan) and have privately 
chided foreign diplomats for opposing the building of a 
U$ base in the Indian Ocean. 
4. TheliAr,0 also worried about the Helsinki Con-
ference 
fearing that Europeans will not further 
expand, andAindeed may even redu*e, their armed forces. 
--Tong itsiao-ping recently stressed 
that the US must recognize the significance 
of a strong and united Europe because the 
fOCUS of Soviet policy was Europe.

--The Chinese position is: any reduction in the 
overall military strength of Western Europe 
improves the Soviet capability to deal 
militarily with China. 
5. The Soviets see no sign of a diminution of 
Chinese hostility to Moscow, and their private assess-
ment--namely, that even Mao's immediate successors will 
not significantly reduce this hostility--has been surfaced. 
--The Soviet party journal, Kommunist, which 
declared in August 1975 that it would be 
"unrealistic to expect change" in Peking's 
policy only as a result of Mao's or Chou'S  
death (only as a result of "one or two 
crisis phenomena" in China). 
6. Our own estimate is that Mao's antii-Soviet 
animus exceeds that of other Chinese leaders, and that 
his death probably will allow for a reduction of ?the 
intensity of Peking's hostility. The result probably 
will be a UmAted improvement of relations, however, and 
still short of reconciliation.
