 Political, sociological, and economic data,. including monetary
 conversion rates, generally reflect information through mid-October
 1974, except for population estimates, which have been projected to 1
 January 1975. Military manpower estimates are as of 1 January 1974
 except for average number of males reaching military age, which are
 projected averages for the 5-year period 1974-78. Military and com-
 munications data are as of 31 October 1974 unless otherwise in-
 dicated.
 Most of the land utilization estimates are rough approximations,
 and most of the statistical data are rounded (thousands and millions).
 Figures for "arable" may reflect only the area actually under crops
 rather than the potential cultivable. Fishing limits are included only
 when they differ from the territorial limits.
 For some countries GDP, rather than GNP, is shown. The
 difference between the two is in the addition or subtraction of the
 value of return on foreign investment. GDP equals GNP plus income
 earned in the country but sent abroad, minus income earned abroad
 but sent into the country. GDP thus tends to exceed GNP in debtor
 countries, and the reverse is true in creditor countries.
 Major ports are the largest maritime ports of the country, relative
 to other ports of the same country, on the basis of estimated port
 capacity, alongside berthing accommodations, and commercial or
 naval importance. Minor ports are the remaining ports of a country
 which have, relative to the major ports, significantly lower estimated
 port capacity, fewer alongside berthing accommodations, are of less
 commercial or naval importance. Major transport aircraft are those
 weighing over 20,000 pounds. Military budgets are in U.S. dollar
 equivalents. The dollar sign refers to U.S. dollars unless otherwise
 stated. The abbreviation FY stands for U.S. fiscal year; all years are
 calendar years unless otherwise indicated.

 ECONOMY
 Principal economic activities of San Marino are
 farming, livestock raising, light manufacturing, and
 tourism; the government's total budget for FY71 was
 about $12 million, with the largest share of revenue
 derived from the sale of postage stamps throughout
 the world and from payments by the Italian
 government in exchange for Italy's monopoly in
 retailing tobacco, gasoline, and a few other goods;

 finance badly needed water and electric power
 systems expansions
 Agriculture: principal crops are wheat (average
 annual output about 4,400 metric tons/year) and
 grapes (average annual output about 700 metric
 tons/year); other grains, fruits, vegetables, and animal
 feedstuffs are also grown; livestock population
 numbers roughly 6,000 cows, oxen, and sheep; cheese
 and hides are most important livestock products
 Electric power: obtained from Italy, 1973
 Manufacturing: consists mainly of cotton textile
 production at Serravalle, brick and tile production at
 Dogane, cement production at Acquaviva, Dogane,
 and Fiorentino, and pottery production at Borgo
 Maggiore; some tanned hides, paper, candy, baked
 goods, Moscato wine, and gold and silver souvenirs
 are also produced
 Foreign transactions: dominated by tourism; in
 summer months 20,000 to 30,000 foreigners visit San
 Marino every day; a number of hotels and restaurants
 have been built in recent years to accommodate them;
 remittances from Sanmarinese abroad also represent
