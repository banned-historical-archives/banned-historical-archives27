By Carroll Kilpatrick

Washington Post Staff Writers 
The exodus of high ranking 
plixon administration officials 
continued yesterday, led by 
Gerard C. Smith, who headed 
the American delegation at the 
!Strategic Arms Limitation 
'Talks with the Russians over 
the last four years, and Phil-
lip V. Sanchez, director of the 
Office of Economic Opportu-
nity. 
The resignation of Smith 
was confirmed by the Reuter 
news agency, who spoke with 
ably provoked a strong moral reaction 
in this country, as in the Department 
of State. if ? followed other actions in ' 
Uganda such as the abrupt expulsion 
of the Asians, the arrest and disap-
pearance of some of the lay intellectu-
als, harassment of Americans, and ver-
bal attacks against the United States 
which had already attracted notice and 
awakened concern in this country. 
At the same time Uganda was expe-
riencing not only serious internal 
problems but also the attempted inva-
sion by political exiles in Tanzania. 
- Tension was high in the country and 
the safety of U.S. citizens in Uganda, 
numbering over 1,000, were judged to 
? be in some jeopardy. Their, safety was 
and always is the U.S. government's 
first preoccupation. We were certain 
that any abrupt or seemingly hostile 
action on our part would increase this 
? threat. 
On Sept. 14 the department's spokes-
man, Charles Bray, was asked for our 
? reaction to Gen. Amin's telegram and. 
subsequently during his briefing, for 
U.S. intentions with respect to aid pro-
grams to Uganda. He replied that in 
the circumstances?the expulsion of 
the Asians, the harassment of Ameri-
cans, and Gen. Amin's telegram to Mr. 
Waldheim?we did not contemplate 
signing new loan agreement at this 
time. He noted that technical assist-
ance would continue. 
Mr. Bray had asked the Assistant 
Secretary for African Affairs just be-
ffore his noon briefing that day if we 
were going to sign the loan which was ? 
then under negotiation and had been 
told that we certainly could not sign it 
, under the existing circumstances, i.e., 
harassment of Americans, expulsion of 
Asians, the telegram to Mr. Waldheim. 
In retrospect, and as this thought 
was conveyed at the noon briefing, it 
was interpreted by reporters present 
Ice with the 'Atomic 
Commission in 1950. 
Sanchez' resignation, it was 
learned, soon will be accepted. 
One of two second-line ap-
pointees is in line to succeed 
Sanchez. Administration 
sources identified them as 
Nicholas Craw, director of re-
cruitment at Action, and How-
ard Phillips, the program re-
view director of 0E0. 
Craw was in charge of man-
power and training at Volun-
teers in Service to America 
(VISTA) when that volunteer 
program was part of 0E0, and 
was formerly director of open 
ations for Project Hope, the 
hospital ship. Phillips was an 
unsuccessful Republican can-
didate for , Congress from 
Massachusetts in 1970.

facts, which had perhaps not been

which he subsequently noted in his 
briefing on Sept'. 19, however, were

in Uganda and of the possible impact

the 'noon briefing, we authorized Am-
bassador Melady to inform Gen. Amiti 
of the circumstances surrounding the 
loan, which I have just described. ? ? 
Recognizing that these events had 
left some. uncertainty regarding our 
position on these various Matters, the 
Assistant Secretary for African Affairs , 
took the occasion of a call on him by 
the Ugandan Minister of Finance on ; 
Sept. 28 to inform him that the circum-
stances surrounding events in Uganda, .; 
including the harassment and arrest' 
of our citizens (since ended) and the 
expressed attitudes of Ugandan lead-
ers on matters of deep concern to 
Americans would not permit us to go 
forward with the signature of the loan 
at that time. This remains our position. 
There will he no change in our posi-
tion, moreover, without appropriate 
consultation with the Congress and a 
full evaluation of the state of our rela-,

HINDUSTAN TIMES 
5 December 1972 ? 
RECENTLY, following a re-
ference to the subject by 
Mr Z. A. Bhutto, when diplo-
mats and newsmen tried to 
assess U.S. thinking on the issue 
of resumption of arms aid to 
Pakistan, they were unable to 
make what could be described 
I even as a moderately accurate 
appraisal. Their bafflement was 
typical of ? the difficulties they 
have encountered here in recent 
years and which should persist 
for another four years. 
Not merely on the subject of 
supply of arms to Pakistan but 
on other, often less controversial, 
Issues one finds the Nixon Ad-
ministration excessively, almost 
pathologically, secretive. Mr 
Johnson was known to hold his' 
cardspretty close to his chest 
but, by comparison to his sticces-
sor, his Administration could 
claim to have had the openness 
of a market place. 
When he chose his Cabinet four 
'years ago, Mr Nixon introduced 
? 1t3 members at a specially tele-
vised function and presented 
; them as a group of remarkable, 
; "extra-dimension" personalities 
who would be entrusted with 
:considerable autonomous power. 
;In a matter of weeks, however, 
,most of them became faceless 
persons and remembering the 
names of the "Nixon Dozen," as 
they were called, become a fav-
ourite party game in Washington. 
Presidential Rchuffs 
Most of them counted for little 
:In the decision making processes 
that Mr Nixon estiblished. One 
of them, the Interior Secretary, 
was so distressed over having no 
role to play that he wrote a 
letter of protest to. his boss . and 
was prorriptly dismissed. Anomer, 
: the Housing Secretary, got his 
1 audience with Mr Nixon in the 
:fourth year of his appointment 
and only when he had a politi-
cally sensitive report to make and 
threatened to go to the Press 
with it if he were not ushered 
Into the Presidential presence. 
Yet another, who at the time of 
his appointment was considered 
as a leader with a future, re-

Krishan Bhatia writes from Washington 
hope of saving that future, but 
in reality only to slide further 
into oblivion. 
Real power has rested In the 
hands of individuals, not even 
half a dozen in 'number, in the-
White House and most of them 
have shared Mr Nixon's over-
whelming, compelling desire for 
secrecy. Barring Dr Henry Kis-
singer who at least did not ob-
ject to a certain measure of so-
cial limelight, ? these Presidential 
advisers have assiduously courted 
anonymity and have remained?
by choice, of course?as "faceless" 
as the cabinet members. They . 
almost never speak to the Press 
or the diplomats or , even attend 
social functions. 
Other Influences 
Two of Mr Nixon's senior .ad-
visers, whose personal influence 
and power equals that of Dr 
Kissinger, are Mr H. R. Haldeman 
and Mr John Ehrlichman. After 
four years of their powerful exis-
tence in the U.S. capital, they 
could probably walk through a 
crowd of diplomats and journal-
ists without being recognised. Mr 
Haldeman has appeared on tele-
vision only once. (Or may be it 
was Mr Ehrlichmant) The name 
of another important Nixon aide 
came to light recently when the 
Press was investigating alleged 
political espionage by the Repub-
licans and it was discovered that 
he had been on the White House 
staff for over three years without 
his name appearing even on the 
private White House . telephone 
directory. 
Because the number of persons 
_nvolved in decision-making is so 
small and because they tend to 
prefer dark corners, the dissemi-
nation of information is in the 
nature of a miserable trickle. 
When a decision is finally reach-
ed, it has to be made public, but 
how that particular resolve was 
made and what considerations 
weighed with the Administration 
is seldom known. Prior inkling of 
any important decision, particu-
larly if it is sensitive and con-
troversial, is, in the circumstances, 
'virtually impossible. If and when 
Mr Nixon decides to resume sup-
ply of arms to Pakistan, the pub-
lic?and the Secretary of State, 
Mr William Rogers?will learn of 
IL more or less simultaneously. 
How and why that decision is 
taken will probably remain a 
secret between the President and 
Dr Kissinger. 
This secrecy apart, what makes 
assessment of the Administra-
tion's approach to any issue ex-
ceedingly difficult is the fact that 
it lacks any firm "moral moor-
ings". In the case of every gov-
ernment, here or elsewhere, there 
is always a sizable gap between 
Its public professions and real 
actions. In defence of national 
or party or even certain personal 
Interests, a government would 
sometimes deviate markedly from 
the principles by which it claims 
to stand. Yet, usually there is a 
limit beyond which it will not 
go. After studying its actions and 
declarations for a few months, 
observers are usually able to 
prescribe the outer limits to 
which a government will go in 
pursuit of selfish objectives. But 
the Nixon administration has 
foxed even seasoned students of 
government and diplomacy. What 
it would do in a particular situas 
tion would be a hazardous guess 
to make. 
Devious Manner 
How far it may go for how 
little was , demonstrated last 
month when President Amin of 
Uganda publicly praised Hitler 
for what he did to the Jews. Mr 
Nixon was by then entirely as-
sured of a landslide? victory in 
the elections. Yet he was not 
?averse to taking away a few more 
votes from Senator McGovern by 
exploiting what the Ugandan dic-
tator had said. In Washington, 
therefore, the official spokesman 
promptly announced that U.S. 
economic aid to. Uganda was 
being held back as a mark of 
displeasure over the Amin. utter-
ance. But even as Jewish hearts 
were being mellowed, the U.S. 
ambassador in Uganda was direct. 
ed to privately assure President 
Amin that aid was on its way 
and that the official spokesinan 
had spoken out of turn. He was 
also urged to keep this assurance 
private but he declined to oblige. 
His disclosure made Nixon watch-
2 
ers wonder why the Administra-
tion should act in this devious 
manner when the Jewish votes it 
could bring the President were 
not really needed and when U.S. 
interests in Uganda were far from 
vital. 
Again, last year, Mr Nixon per-
sonally assured Mrs Gandhi that 
a solution of the conflict between 
the two wings of Pakistan was 
within sight and that the U.S. 
had been permitted to meet 
Sheikh Mujib In jail when, in 
reality, all that had happened 
was that President Yahya Khan 
had grudgingly permitted a U.S. 
embassy representative to meet 
Sheikh Mujib's , lawyer. Even a 
committed Republican like Mr 
Kenneth Keating was disturbed 
by the obvious lack of truth In 
the official claim and sent a 
coded message of protest from 
Delhi. 
Buoyant Spirit 
Apparently, the Administration 
plays this game as readily with 
its own people as with foreigners. 
Last month, Dr Kissinger publicly 
announced that Peace in Vietnam 
"is at hand". For the first time 
In four years he allowed his 
voice to be recorded for tele-
vision and radio broadcasts. The 
announcement roused tremendous 
optimism. Wives of American war 
prisoners who had previously 
sharply criticised and often even 
booed Mr Nixon were so cheered 
by the disclosure that at their 
? 
annual meeting in Washington 
they gave Mr Nixon a standing, 
tearful ovation. The spectacle of 
their buoyant spirit carried tens 
of thousand of other Americans, 
too, behind Mr Nixon. The im-
portance of the peace news push-
ed allegations of corruption 
against the Republicans off the 
front pages just when the public 
was beginning to get agitated 
about the matter. After the elec-
tion however, the White House 
stated that Dr Kissinger had 
"overstated" the situation and 
that peace was farther than 
everyone had been led to be-
lieve. 
Watching the Nixon Adminis-
tration for another four years 
promises to be a fascinating but 
frustrating experience.

Washington Bur 
Washington ? Frank C. Car-

No. 2 slot in the Department of 
Health, Education and Wel-
fare makes him the "star per-
former" in a program to 
spread the State Department's 
brainpower around the govern-
ment. 
Mr. Carlucci, who is moving 
from the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, belongs to 
the nation's elite corps of 3,279 
Foreign Service officers, of 
whom 1,385 are based in Wash-
ington. 
Agnew, Kissinger aides 
Today, 120 of these work 
outside the State Department 
in other government agencies. 
Their assignments stretch 
from the White House to the ' 
National Bicentennial Comis- ' 
sion, from the Justice Depart-
ment to the Council on .Envi-
ronmental Quality, from the 
Interior Department to the 
Conference on the Industrial 
World Ahead. 
Vice President Agnew has 
one Foreign Service officer in 
his office. Henry A. Kissinger 
has three on his personal staff. 
And half the foreign affairs 
professionals on the National 
Security Council are Foreign 
Service officers. 
Explaining the outside de-
mand for Foreign Service offi-
cer's, Robert T. (Ted) Curran, 
the State Department's deputy 
director of personnel for man-
agement, said: 
"I believe there is quite a 
market for the type of back-
ground the FSO's present to 
the federal administration. 
They are carefully selected. It 
is a very competitive service. 
People in it tend to do well. I

Stanley Carpenter, on loan 
for the last year as deputy 
assistant secretary of interior 
for territorial affairs, ques-

assignment helped a Foreign 
Service career. 
But he added, "I frankly feel 
more FSO's should be sent to 
other departments. My own 
feeling is that the future of the 
Foreign Service really lies in 
doing this sort of thing. 
"It is the Foreign Service of

? By BARRY KALB 
Star?IsIesvs Staff Writer 
The Los Angeles Times to-, 
day gave U.S. District Court 
here tape recordings of an in-
terview in the Watergate bug-
ging case after the subject of 
the interview agreed. 
The newspaper's action 
frees its Washington bureau 
chief, John F. Lawrence, of a 
contemp citation issued by the 
judge in the Watergate case 
after Lawrence refused to turn 
over its recording of the inter-
view. 
Until today's surprise move, 
it had appeared that the case, 
considered a test of the court's 
contempt powers and the 
newspaper's 1st . Amendment 
rights, would go to the Su-
preme Court. 
Surrender of the tape re-
cordings was approved by 
Alfred C. Baldwin III, who 
says he participated in the 
bugging last summer of Demo-
cratic National headquarters, 
and followed almost exactly 
the course suggested yester-
day by Judge Harold Leven-
thal of the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals. 
Lawrende was held in con-
tempt of court and ordered to 
jail by Chief U.S. District 
Court Judge John J. Sirica on 
? Tuesday after the Times bu-
reau chief refused to obey an 
order directing him to turn the, 
tapes over to the defense. 
The Court of Appeals yester-
day refused to delay jailing of 
. Lawrence beyond a brief per!-
, ,od allowed the Times to take 
an appeal to 'the Supreme 
Court. The Times bureau chief 
spent over two hours in a 
courthouse lockup on Tuesday 
after refusing Sirica's order. 
He was freed after an appeal 
was taken to the appellate 
court. 
The contempt finding 
against Lawrence now is ex-
/ pected to be dismissed. 
As a pre-trial conference in 
the Watergate case began this 
morning, Asst. U.S. Atty. Earl 
J. Silbert antionnced I hat ' 
lowing yesterday's Court of 
Appeals hearing, he had, as 
Leventhal had suggested, 
called Baldwin in Connecticut 
Ito see If the iiiterView'aiib 
jeet would voluntarily tiEW4to to 
disclosure of the tapes' con-
tents. 
The prosecutor told Sirica 
that Baldwin, through his law-
yers, had agreed to release of 
the tapes. They were handed 
over later to one of the judge's 
law clerks. 
The Times had refused to 
turn over the tapes on the 
grounds that Baldwin granted 
the interview after being as-
sured that only parts of the 
interview authorized by him 
would be published, with the 
rest kept confidential. 
The only condition set by 
Baldwin, in agreeing to re-
lease of the tapes, Silbert said, 
was that voices on the tapes 
other than his own be erased 
and not made public. 
In a telegram sent to Jack 
Nelson and Ronald J. Ostrow, 
the two Times reporters who 
conducted the interview, Bald-, 
win's attorneys, John V. Cassi-
dento and Robert C. Mirto, 
said yesterday: 
"On Mr. Baldwin's behalf 
we are requesting that you 
withdraw your opposition to 
the subpoena and that you 
agree to the submission of the 
tapes . . . we appreciate the 
fact that both of you, as re-
porters for the Los Angeles 
Times, have steadfastly honor-
ed your agreement of confi-
dentiality.'.' 
The defense in the Water-
gate:.'ace wants the tapes in 
order to study Baldwin's full 
statement and possibly'attack 
his credibility when Baldwin 
takes the stand for the prose-
cution. 
Baldwin said in the inter-
view that he took part in the 
bugging of Democratic Nation-' 
al Committee headquarters as 
an employe of the Nixon re-
election committee. He impli-
cated some of the seven de-
fendants is the case, who in-

mer chief security officer of 
the Nixon re-election unit, E. 
Howard Hunt Jr., a former 
White House consultant, and 
G. Gordon Liddy, former re-
election committee treasurer. 
Sirica said after today's de-
velopment that he would ac-
cept the tapes and keep them 
locked in a courthouse safe 
until the trial.

Defense Sees Constitutional Test 
As Ellsberg-Russo Trial Starts 
By MARTIN ARNOLD 
special to The New York Timee 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3 
the modern, almost antiseptic 
Federal Building downtown 
here, thousands of miles from 
Vietnam, the final act of the 
Pentagon papers case began 
to unfold today with the start 
of jury selection in the trial of 
aniel Ellsberg and Anthony 
J. Russo Jr. They are accused 
of espionage. 
The incidents leading to the 
revelations of secret documents 
can sometimes be as intriguing 
as docments themselves, and 
the trial is expected to be filled 
with thriller-story talcs of 
documents clandestinely copied 
and distributed, of people hid-
ing away and of F.13.l, stake-
outs in the dead of night. ! 
But more important than 
these mystery story ingredients 
are the legal issues involved, 
and their implications. Many 
lawyers see the trial of Dr. 
Ellsberg and Mr. Russo as a 
major test of the First Amend-
ment to the Constitution, of the 
Government's authority over 
information and of the public's 
access to that information. 
security -classification proce-

And although it is not direct-
ly part of the Ellsberg-Russo 
trial, in the background is the 
fact that when the papers were 
made public, a newspaper of 
general circulation, The Times, 
for the first time in the coun-
try's history, was restrained by 
prior court order from publish-
mg articles. 
Ruling by High Court 
This restraint was lifted by 
the Supreme Court, in a 6-to-3 
finding, but that ruling left im-
portant questions unresolved, 
questions that could in part 
be cleared up as a result of 
this trial. 
The Times case drew sepa-
rate opinions from all nine jus-
tices, leaving freedom of the 
press rights under the First 
Amendment somewhat blurred. 
The Court did say that the 
Government had not met the 
"heavy burden" of proving 
enough damage to the national 
defense as balanced against a 
crack in the First Amendment 
to allow prior restraints. 
However, the Court gave the 
Government the' right to prose-

right left the issue of "national

The Pentagon papers, a top-
study of America's involve-
ment in Indochina through four 
Presidential Administrations, 
were first made public on June 
13, 1971, in The New York 
Times.

counts of espionage, theft and

years in prison. 
Mr. Russo, 36, an aeronauti-
cal engineer and economist, is 
charged with three counts of 
espionage, theft and conspiracy 
and could receive 35 years in 
prison. 
There are also two alleged 
co-conspirators ? Miss Lynda 
Sinay, a Los Angeles advertis-
ing woman, and Vu Van Thai, 
a former South Vietnamese 
Ambassador to the United 
States. Neither was indicted. 
FOCUS of Indictments 
The Indictment-6 Wild main-
ly eti BOW OP, Ellsberg copied 
the Pentagon papers while he 
was employed at the Rand Cor-
poration in nearby Santa 
Monica, but they do not go into 
the question of how the papers! 
were- finally made public. (The 
corporation does considerable 
work for the Defense Depart 
meat and had two copies.) 
The 15 counts in the indict 
ments cover the period between 
March 1, 1969, and Sept. 30, 
1970?nine months to more 
than two years before tin 
papers were first made pi:blic 
by The Times. 
They say that Dr. Ellsberg. 
during that period, first took 
many of the heavy Pentagon 
papers volumes out of the Rand 
Corporation offices in Wash-
ington and transported them to 
Los Angeles. The first cross-
country trip, with 10 volumes 
of the 47-volume study, is said 
to have been made on March 4, 
1969, and a second with eight 
more volumes on Aug. 29, 1969. 
the Government during the 
trial. 
The six counts allege viola-
tion of Title 18, section 641, of 
?I the Code, which involves the 
embezzlement and theft of Gov-
ernment property. 
? The final eight counts involve 
unauthorized possession and 
reception of the Pentagon pa-
pers in violation of three sub. 
divisions of Title IS, section 
' 793, of the Code,, which per-
tains to espionage and censor-
ship, most particularly the. 
gathering, transmitting or 
losing of defense information. 
The subdivisions have to do 
with receiving and obtaining 
information about the national 
defense, whether they are docu-
ments or blueprints, photo-
graphs or sketches, and copy-
ing and distributing them to un-
authorized persons. 
Maze of Issues 
Details of Allegations 
The allegations are that Dr. 
Ellsberg, who by the nature of 
his position was authorized to 
have access to the papers, took 
the volumes, and other related 
material he had obtained from 
the Rand Corporation in Santa 
Monica, to Miss Sinay's adver-
tising 'office at .8101 Melrose 
Avenue here and, along with 
Miss Sinay and Mr. Russo, 
copied them on Oct. 4, 1969. 
Neither Miss Sinay nor Mr. 
Russo nor later Mr, Thai Was 
authorized to haVe or see the 
papers. 
Mr. Thai, who came to op-
pose the war in Vietnam, was 
alleged to have entered into a 
conspiracy with Dr. Ellsberg in 
the spring of 1969 to reveal to 
the public the classified papers, 
and the Government contends 
that it has found his finger-
prints on several of the pages 
of the Pentagon papers. 
The first count charges that 
in violation of Title 18, section 
371, of the United States Code 
Annotated, Dr. Ellsberg and Mr. 
Russo conspired against the 
Federal Government to: "Ob-
tain and caused to be obtained 
classified Government docu-
ments relating to the national 
defense . . . The documents 
would be communicated de-
livered and transmitted to de-
fendants and others, none of 
whom would be authorized to 
receive them." 
That is the conspiracy 
charge. 
The next six counts involve 
specific acts of stealing, con-
cealing and receiving stolen 
Government property?includ-
ing nine volumes of the Penta-
gon papers, a 1968 memoran-
dum from the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff about Vietnam and a 
case study of the 1954 Geneva 
Conference on, Indochina. 
trio We 
in these counts were among the 
18 that Dr. Ellsberg allegedly 
transported across the country, 
and why only these nine are 
mentioned in these counts will i 
presumably be made clear by 
If the charges in the indict-
ments sound cut and dried, the 
maze of legal 'and constitution-
al issues underneath Is not, and 
because of that the Ellsberg-
Russo case could become one 
of the most extraordinary trials 
in an era of spectacular court-
room encounters. 
The Government alleges, for 
instance, the Dr. Ellsberg had 
illegal possession of documents 
"relating to the national de-
fense." This means that the 
Government must prove that 
the documents are, in fact, re-
lated to the "national defense," 
not merely classified top secret. 
In the case of the Govern-
ment against The Times, the 
issue of "national defense" was 
resolved only insofar as it was 
related to the freedom of the 
press issue. The Court said The 
Times could print the papers 
because they did not imperil 
the national defense enough to 
justify the unprecedented step 
of prior restraint. 
But the Court did not define 
"national defense," and it did 
ay that perhaps, in a different 
action, the Government could 
prove that making the material 
public did imperil the national 
defense enough to make pos-
sible criminal convictions at a 
later date, after the papers 
were published. 
So the Ellsberg-Russo trial 
could involve expert testimony 
from high officials of this and 
previous Administrations on 
just that point?what imperils 
the national defense. 
Furthermore, the espionage 
statute requires that the de-
fendants must have knowingly 
acted "against the best inter-
ests of the United States" and 
any arturrient rivet the liatibril.S

His argument here is that he 
performed a public service by 
providing the nation with in-
formation that it should have 
about the conduct of the war in 
Vietnam and of American for-
eign policy. 
All of this, of course. tends 
to obscure the ,cry real con-
stitutional issues, particularly 
the crucial First Amendment 
Implications of the case. 
Many constitutional lawyers 
believe, for instance, that con-
viction of Dr. Ellsberg and Mr. 
,Russo would set legal preced-
ents that could give the Gov-
ernment a greater degree of 
control over Information than 
has ever before existed. 
1_ .There are several reasons for 
'this conclusion. The first is that 
'the Ellsberg-Russo trial is, in 
essence, the Government's first 
.iattempt at imprisoning a per-
son who "leaked" information 
Ito the. public. That is, Dr. Ells-
berg has admitted being the 
'source of the Pentagon papers 
that appeared in the news 
media. 
And while it is not the stated 
purpose of prosecuting Dr. Ells-
berg, many constitutional au-
thorities believe that successful 
use of the espionage laws 
against persons who have made 
information available to the 
public could have a deadly ef-
fect on others who might have 
Information they believe should 
be made public. Such a develop-
ment could give the Govern-
ment unprecedented authority 
to conceal embarrassing facts. 
In a separate case involving 
the Pentagon papers, a Fed-
eral grand jury in Boston in-
vestigated how The New York 
Time 5; and other media obtained 
the papers. That grand jury 
was discharged shortly after 
Thanksgiving, without having 
handed down any indictments. 
A spokesman for the United 
States Attorney's office in Bos-
ton said no final decision 
would be made on whether a 
new grand jury should be im-
paneled until after the Ellsberg-
Russo trial. The office had said 
j that the 'Boston ? jury was dis-
missed to avoid any conflict 
,with the prosecution of crimi-
nal charges against Dr. Ells-
berg. 
How to keep Government se-
crets, has always been a pro-
found dilemma for the nation, 
since the First Amendment says: 
"Congress shall make no law... 
abridging the freedom of speech, 
or of the press?   " 
Consequently, Congress has 
made several unsuccessful at-
tempts to pass official secrets 
acts that would make it a crime 
to disclose or publish any in:. 
formation classified as .secret. 
? However, with very few ex-
ceptions, these attempts have 
never succeeded for two rea-
sons: many CongreaSnien be-
lieved finally that such laws 
would have questionable valid-
ity under the First Amendment, 
and they feared that such laws 
would allow Presidential Ad-
ministrations to hide their mis-
takes simply by stamping them 
"classified."

that Dr. Ellsberg stole the docu-

under that provision of the act. The defense argues further 
that since Congress did not 
pass an official secrets 'act, the 
Government is in effect asking 
the judge and jury to make law 
concerning classified docu-
ments, something that Congress 
has steadfastly refused to do. 
Indeed, there is no statute 
that gives the Executive Branch 
of Government the right , to 
establish its system of classi-
fying information with such 
labels as "top secret." 
The classification system 
rests, instead, on executive 
orders, not Congressional ac-
tion. Violators of the system 
have not suffered criminal 
prosecution, only administra-
jobs. 
So if the two men are con-
victed, and the conviction is 
sustained through the Supreme 
Court, it could mean that mak-
ing public classified information 
would have been declared a 
crime, even though no .statute 
makes it a crime. 
It could also mean that the 
Government would not be re-
quired to show that the act of 
passing information was in-
tended to do' injury or to help 
a foreign power, as the espion-
age laws now require. 
Prof Melville B. Nimmer of

leading authority on the First 
Amendment, has/ said: "The

against the defendants that 
have never been made by the 
Government in any previous 
case, and both also raise pro-

The first is that Dr. Ellsberg

"defraud the United States" by 
"impairing, obstructing, and 
defeating its governmental 
function of controlling dissemi-
nation of classified Government 
studies, reports, memorandums 
and communications." 
If upheld, this 'could allow 
the Government to invoke 
general federal anticonspiracy 
statutes against, for example, 
Government officials and 
newsmen who work together 
to make public information 
marked "classified" ? even 
though Congress has never 
made it a crime to make such 
material public. 
Secondly, and perhaps even 
more far-reaching in the view 
of some constitutional authori-

berg and Mr. Russo under the 
general Federal statutes involv-
ing theft. 
Dr. Ellsberg, for example, 
apparently never intended to 
keep a Government copy of the 
Pentagon papers. Rather, he 
made a copy and returned the 
original.

Furthermore, the Freedom of 
Information Act of 1966 pro-
vides exemptions for nine 
board categories of informa-
tion, including the exemption 
for "matters ,that are'.... specl.

be argued that in providing 
exemptions, the right of the

One of the main defense con-

the physical papers themselves

Dr. Ellsberg is not contending 
that the documents themselves,

Schlesinger to Get 
Hel s' Post at CIA 
. By Carroll Kilpatrick 
Watiliington ro. fiLar f Writer 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla., Dec. 
21?President Nixon today 
confirmed reports that he will 
/nominate James R. Schle-
singer, chairman of the At-
omic Energy Commission, to 
be the next director of the 
Central Intelligence Agency. 
Richard M. Helms, who has 
been director since 1966 and 
an official of the agency since 
1947, will be nominated ambas-
sador to Iran. 
The President worked at his 
residence here today and con-
ferred ?vith inchiding'

Henry A. k issinger, by tele. 
phone, White I louse press sec-
retary Ronald L. Ziegler said. 
In Washington, it was 
learned that Mr. Nixon is ex-
pected to nominate Under See-
rotary Joseph N. Irwin, the 
No. 2 man at the State Depart-
ment, as ambassador to 
France. 
It was understood that nom-
ination of the 59-year-old Ir-
win will be made this week. 
He would replace Arthur K. 
'Watson, former IBM executive 
who has resigned. 
The White House already 
has announced that Irwin?
previously described as slated 
for "a high-level ambassado-
rial post"?will be succeeded 
at State by Kenneth Rush-, 
who now is deputy defense 
secretary.

Ziegler refused to comment 
on reports from Saigon that 
the President had in effect de-
livered an ultimatum to both 
Saigon and Hanoi. 
The reports said that the 
President warned Hanoi it 
could expect continued and in-
tensified bombing if it refused 
In accept a negotiated settle-
mein and told Saigon to stop 
making pence propiisais that 
make it more difficult to 
reach a settlement. 
Significantly, Ziegler did 
not deny the reports. Rather, 
he branded them a "rumor" 
and said he would not com-
ment on rumors. 
When a reporter asked if it 
was the word "ultimatum" 
that bothered him, he again 
declined to comment. If the 
reports had been entirely 
without foundation he almost 
certainly would have said so. 
Haig left Bangkok today.. 
Kissinger flew here with the 
President on Wednesday and 
Is scheduled to leave some-
time this weekend to spend 
Christmas with his children. 
Reporters have repeatedly 
asked Ziegler this week why

the same time, the departure 
from the C.I.A. is touched with 
symbolic overtones. 
In the opinion of knowledge-
able officials, it means the end 
of an era of professional intel-
ligence operatives and the be-
ginning of an era of systems 
management. Mr. Helms, who 
once interviewed Hitler, as a

Mr. Schlesinger, by contrast,

author of a detailed report on 
the intelligence community for 
Mr. Nixon last year, he is ex-
pected to take over at the C.I.A.

Marshall's post, as head of 
the "Net, Assessment Group," 
within the NSC staff, was cre-
ated by Schlesinger's reorgani-
zation plan. 
Schlesinger had joined the 
Nixon administration in Feb-
ruary 1969, primarily as a 
budget-watcher. His main as-
signment was to oversee the 
Pentagon's budgeting proce-

in-law. 
In the first news briefing of 
the President's week-long 
Christmas trip here, Ronald L. 
Ziegler, the White House press 
secretary, also dealt with the 
following appointments topics: 
ciMr. Nixon has accepted 
"with very special regret" the 
resignation of David M. Ab-
shire as Assistant Secretary of 
State for Congressional Rela-
tions. Mr. 'Abshire will become 
chiarman of the Georgetown 
University. Center for Strategic 
and International Studies on 
Jan. 9. 
9ISpeculation about the direc-
torship of the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation should be dis-
counted for the time being Mr. 
Ziegler said. One newspaper 
the 
other, he also has a reputation 
for being sensitive about envi-
ronmental issues. 
, Ecology Stand Tested 
His friends recall that; 
among his other activities 
within the government, he per-
suaded the administration to 
reverse itself and to allow the 
Taos Indians to keep their 
sacred Blue Lake lands in 
New Mexico. 
The chairmanship ? of AEC 
tested his devotion to ecology. 
Although environmental orga-
nizations strongly criticized 
his full support for the Am-
chitka atomic blast, they have 
praised his stand on the so-
called Calvert Cliffs case. 
Pressed by the atomic ener-
gy industry to appeal a federal 
court decision ordering the 
AEC to act much more ag-
gressively to protect the envi-
ronment, Schlesinger refused, 
choosing to obey the court. 
The chairman also has taken 
the position that it is not ap-
propriate for the AEC to pro-
mote atomic energy, or to esti-
mate how much nuclear power 
the nation will need. Instead; 
It has been his policy to have 
the agency develop energy op-
tions that the public may de-
cide to use as It wittheo. 
Trained as an economist,

travel in Europe on a fellow-

formally nominated, another 
has said he would not be, and 
a third has been in between, 
Mr. Ziegler said. The fact is, 
he continued, that no decision 
has been made. 
Another vacancy arose in 
Washington today with the 
resignation of John P. Olsson 
after 20 months as deputy un-
der secretary of transportation 
to return to private business. 
Mr. Helma's new position 
comes after 30 years in Intelli-
gence work. After graduation 
from Williams College, he be-
came a United Press corre-
spondent in Germany from 
1935 to 1937. Until 1942, when

After, that, he taught eco-
nomics at the University of 
Virginia, and began concen-
trating on the budgetary side

titled "The Political Economy 
of National Security." 
In part as a result of the 
book's favorable notice among 
experts in the national securi-
ty field, Schlesinger was of-
fered the job at Rand in Santa 
Monica which carried out 
much of the defense establish-
ment's computer-based analy-

While at Rand, Schlesinger 
headed a study of nuclear 
arms proliferation, and 
worked on a study of the role 
of "systems analysis" in polit-

work brought him to the atten-

Faced with trying to recon-

Schlesinger began by indicat-
ing that he was no longer go-

A.E.C. position of champion-

energy above all others, in-
cluding those of citizens. 
This he did by deciding,

Not long after this, he told 
representatives of the nuclear 
industry that the commission 
"exists to serve the public in-

During his 17 months as 
chairman of the commission, 
he has also undertaken a 
drastic reorganization of its 
structure ? cutting back on 
high-level staff and creating 
a new "assistant general man-
ager for environmental and 
safety affairs." . 
While the 43-year-old Mr. 
Schlesinger has, made no se-

Choke of Helms. 
By OSWALD JOHNSTON

The White House apparently 
bypassed normal channels 
when it informed the Iranian 
government that Richard M. 
Helms, outgoing director of 
the Central Intelligence 
Agency, would be the next 
U.S. ambassador in Tehran. 
Iranian specialists at the 
State Department have indi-
cated their office was totally 
uninformed as recently as yes-
terday about Helms' nomina-
tion, Yet it is understood the 
Iranian government was in-
formed of the choice through 
less bureaucratic channels as 
long as three weeks ago. 
Bypassing the bureaucracy 
in obtaining compliance from 
a foreign ministry to an am-
bassadorial appointment from 
outside the career foreign 
service is not that rare an oc-
currence. But Foreign Service 
veterans are noticing some un-
usual aspects to the Helms' 
nomination. 
First is the generally recog-
nized fact that the CIA has 
acquired a largely mythical 
but highly potent reputation in 
much of the underdeveloped 
Third World as an agent of 
"U.S. imperialism" and an in-
stigator of political intrigue. 
Second is the historical fact 
that the origins of this reputa-
tion. lie in the CIA's spectacu-
larly successful 1953 coup 
d'etat in Iran which, under the 
direction of Kermit Roosevelt, 
unseated the anti-Western pre-
mier, Mohammed Mossadegh, 
and reinstalled the present

The Change at CM 
There are such strict limits to what is knowable about 
,the Central Intelligence Agency and its workings that ' 
?any discussion of Mr. Helms' departure from the direc-
torship and Mr. Schlesinger's appointment to replace 
him must necessarily rest on a comparatively small store 
of information. Even sO, one .or two things are plain. 
And chief among these is the fact, evident from what 
is known about the two men themselves, that one highly . 
qualified and eminently capable official is being re- ? 
placed by another. 
Richard Helms has spent most of his professional life 
in intelligence work, and he has acquired a reputation 
among those qualified to judge, as a man of great hon-
esty and tough-mindedness. The term "tough-minded" 
,In? this connection can only summon forth imaginary 
;zither music for some people and visions of grown men 
running around endlessly shoving each other under

Intelligence is the nerve 
center of the Soviet system 
and the White House move 
will inevitably put the com-
rades into a spin. Their con-
jectures on Helms' reassign-
ment are certain to be laced 
with conspiratorial intrigues 
and suspicions that Nixon has 
dark plans for deeper med-
dling near the under-belly of 
the Soviet Union. 
The Muscovites would in-
telligently brush aside most 
of White House press secre-

? lion that Helms had asked to 
retire as CIA director because

a man who keeps, fit with 
daily stints on an indoor track 
at the CIA and he is lean, 
healthy and young - minded 
enough to qualify easily for 
an exemption to stay at his 
job. 
The Soviet experts also 
would be correct in brushing 
aside published speculation 
that Helms fell out of favor 
or disappointed the President 
with the quality of his per-
formance as the government's 
chief intelligence officer. He 
has not always told the ad-
ministration what it wanted 
to hear but his record of dis-
cretion?in the men he sent 
abroad, in his intelligence as-
sessments and in his dealings 
with Congress ? is widely 
judged to have been remark-
ably solid. 
Possibly his greatest feat 
has been to hold the confi-
dence and credibility of Con-
gress through a period in 
which the executive branch , 
wa lattii with deep miateust 
on foreign policy. It also was 
a time when the CIA's chief

sity of responding to every wild surmise of what the I 
Russians were up to in nuclear weapons. development, 
Mr. Helms has offered a practical, dispassionate and 
rigorously honest?if not always popular?view. 
That the Congress will be pushing for some greater 
degree of responsiveness from the CIA in the coming 
session seems pretty certain. And there also is at least 
a chance that internal bureaucratic difficulties at the 
Agency will require some managerial rearrangements. 
In a way, solely because he comes to CIA from outside 
(not from up the ranks), James Schlesinger inay be 
specially suited to take on both. But he has other quail. 
fciations. At the Rand Corporation in California, Mr. 
Schlesinger did analytic work that gave him more than 
a passing familiarity with the intelligence estimating 
' business. At the Budget Bureau?as it was then known 
?in the early days of the Nixon administration he 
proved himself a very astute, not to say downright cold-
eyed, scrutinizer of military budget requests. His brief 
term at the AEC was notable in several respects. Mr. 
Schlesinger bucked the pressure of the atomic energy 
establishment to insist that. the AEC take note of and 
respond to the claims of its ecological critics.. And he 
attempted to push the agency back from its political role 
toward the more disinterested service role it was meant 
in the first place to fulfill. He, like Mr. Helms, is 
demonstrably a man of talent, dedication and impressive 
intellect. We should have been content to see them ? 
stay on in their present jobs. But if Mr. Helms Is to 
leave the Central Intelligence Agency, we think Mr. 
Schlesinger is a first class choice to replace him. 
f 110115m7 
neering men like Sen. Rich-
ard Russell, D-Ga., and Rep. 
Mendel Rivers, D-S.C., were 
passing from the scene. 
Actually the agency gained 
respect in a period when it 
easily might have fallen vic-
tim to the popular mood be-
cause Helms held tautly to 
his professional role. Once he 
persuaded skeptics that he 
was not a man who would 
play partisan games, he was 
able to head off those sena-
tors who were bent on shrink-
ing the CIA's cloak so they 
could have a better look at 
what was going on. 
Ironically, the events which 
led to Helms' replacement 
were launched many months 
ago by James Schlesinger, 
the Rand analyst Who has 
agreed, reportedly with great 
reluctance, to take Helms' 
job. As the Budget bureau 
specialist on defense,. Sala. 
Inger was asked to study how 
the government's intelligence 
needs could be accomplished 
more economically. 
This is not a small problem 
10 
for a pinched government. 
Intelligence costs run about 
$3.5 billion a year and the up-
ward pressures on that 
spending level grow more in-
tense as inflation bites into 
the dollar. Schlesinger's study 
concluded that the director of 
central intelligence would 
have to reach out beyond his 
agency to perform budget sur-
gery in the overlapping areas 
of Pentagon intelligence. 
Helms was handed this task 
with an unreassuring fanfare , 
at the White House. He de-
clined to move his office into 
the Budget Bureau and held 
as closely as he could to his 
old activities as an intelli-
gence officer. This was ra-
tional prudence because an 
abrupt move to chop the Pen-
tagon's intelligence budget 
would stir many enemies and 
perhaps 'shatter the working 
alliance he had forged on the 
Hill. Some believe he decided 
to postpone any strong moves 
until the elections were over. 
But the President, pinched

Very well, the Russians will 
say, but why Iran? The fact 
is there are few, significant 
nations to which an ex-CIA 
director, even with Helms' 
charm, could go as ambassa-
dor without stirring mass 
protests. Iran is one and the

Helms', the Shah and the CIA 
THERE IS A CERTAIN irony in the 
fact that Richard Helms will go to Iran 
as the American ambassador 20 years 
after the agency he now heads organ-
ized and directed the overthrow of the 
regime then in power in Teheran. The 
tale is worth recounting if only be-
cause of the changes in two decades 
which have affected the Central Intel-
ligence Agency as well as American 
foreign policy. 
Helms first went to Work at the CIA 
in 1947 and he came up to his present 
post as director through what is gener-
ally called the "department of ? dirty 
tricks." However, there is nothing on 
the public record to show that he per-
sonally had a hand in the overthrow of 
the Communist backed and/or ori-
ented regime of Premier Mohammed 
Mossadegh in 1953, an action that re-
turned the Shah to his throne. One can 
only guess at the wry smile that must 
have come to the Shah's face when he 
first heard that President Nixon was 
proposing to send the CIA's top man 
to be the American envoy. 
The Iranian'affair, and a similar 
CIA action in Guatemala the following 
year, are looked upon by old hands at 
the agency as high points of a sort in 
the Cold War years. David Wise and 
Thomas B. Ross have told the Iranian 
story in their book, "The Invisible Gov-
ernment," and the CIA boss at the 
time, Allen Dulles, conceded in public 
after he left the government that the 
United States had had a hand in what 
occurred. 
IRAN IS NEXT DOOR to the Soviet 
Union. In 1951 Mossadegh, who con-
fused Westerners with his habits of 
.weeping in public and running govern-
ment business from his bed, national-
ized the British-owned Anglo-Iranian 
Oil Co. and seized the Abadan refin-
ery. The West boycotted Iranian oil 
and the country was thrown into crisis. 
Mossadegh "connived," as Wise and 
Ross put it, with Tudeh, Iran's Com-
munist party, to bolster his hand. The 
British and Americans decided he had 
to go and picked Gen. Fazollah Zahedi 
to replace him. The man who stage-
managed the job on the spot was Ker-
mit "Kim" ilotmOvelt (who also bad a 
hand In some fancy goIngsoon In 
,Egypt), grandson of TR. and seventh 
cousin of F.D.R., and now a Washing-
tonian in private business. 
Roosevelt managed to get to Teheran 
and set up underground headquarters. 
A chief aide was Brig. Gen. H. Norman 
Schwarzkopf, who, as head of the New 
' Jersey state police, had become famous 
during the Lindbergh baby kidnaping 
case. Schwarzkopf had reorganized the 
Shah's police force and he and Roose-
velt joined in the 1953 operation. The 
Shah dismissed Mossadegh and named 
Zaheldi as Premier but .Mossadegh ar-
rested the officer who brought the bad 
news. The Teheran streets filled with 
rioters and a scared Shah fled first to 
Baghdad and then to Rome. Dulles 
flew to Rome to confer with him. Roo. 
sevelt ordered the Shah's backers into 
the streets, the leftists were arrested 
by the army and the Shah returned in 
triumph. Mossadegh went to jail. In 
time a new international oil consor-
tium took over Anglo-Iranian which 
operates to this day,though the Shah 
has squeezed more and more revenue 
from the Westerners. 
In his 1963 book, "The Craft of Intel-
ligence," published after he left CIA, 
Dulles wrote that, when in both Iran 
and Guatemala it "became clear" that 
a Communist state was in the making, 
"support from outside was given to 
loyal anti-Communist elements." In a 
1965 NBC television documentary on 
"The Science of Spying" Dulles said: 
"The government of Mossadegh, if you 
recall history, was overthrown by the 
action of the Shah. Now, that we en-
couraged the .Shah to take that action 
I will not deny." Miles Copeland, an 
ex-CIA operative in the Middle East, 
wrote in his book, "The Game of 
Nations," that the Iranian derring-do 
was called "Operation Ajax." He cred-
ited Roosevelt with "almost single-
handedly" calling the "pro-Shah forces 
on to the streets of Teheran" and su-
pervising "their riots so as to oust" 
Mossadegh. 
TODAY THE IRAN to which Helms 
will go after he leaves the CIA is a sta-
ble,, well armed and well oil-financed 
regime under the Shah's command 
which has mended its fences with Mos-
cow without hurting its close relation-
ship with Washington. The shah has 
taken full advantage of the changes in 
East-West relations from the Cold War 
to today's milder climate. 
While Iran and Guatemala were the 
high pointti Overt ?IA 001t1 Wor 00. 
tivity, there were plenty of other suc- ' 
cessful enterprises that fell short of 
changing government regimes. Today 
the CIA, humiliated by the 1961 Bay of 
Pigs fiasco it planned and ran, has 
withdrawn from such large scale af-
fairs as Iran, save for its continuing 
major role in the no longer "secret 
war in Laos." The climate of today 
would not permit the United States to 
repeat the Iranian operation, or so one 
assumes with the reservation that ' 
President Nixon (who was Vice Presi-
dent at the time of Iran) loves sur-
prises. 
The climate of 1953, however, was 
very different and must be taken into 
account in any judgment. Moscow 
then was fishing in a great many 
troubled waters and among them was 
Iran. It was probably true, as Allen. 
Dulles said on that 1965 TV show, that 
"at no time has the CIA engaged in 
any political activity or any intelli-
gence that was not approved, at the 
highest level." It was all part of a' 
deadly "game of nations." Richard Bis- ? 
sell, who ran the U-2 program and the 
Bay of Pigs, was asked on that TV 
show about the morality of CIA activi-
ties. "I think," he replied, that "the 
morality of . . . shall we call it for 
short, cold war .. . is so infinitely eas-
ier than the morality of almost any 
kind of hot war that I never encoun-
tered this as a serious problem." 
?PERHAPS the philosophy of the. 
Cold War years and the CIA role were 
best put by Dulles in a letter that he 
wrote me in 1961. Excerpts from his 
then forthcoming book had appeared 
in Harper's and I had suggested to hint 
some further revelations he might in-
clude in the book. He wrote about ad-. 
ditions he was making: "This includes' 
more on Iran and Guatemala and the 
problems of policy in action when 
there begins to be evidence that a 
country is slipping and Communist 
take-overis threatened. We can't wait 
for an engraved invitation to come and 
Ore aid." 
There is a story, too, that Winston 
Churchill was so pleased by the opera-
tion in Iran that he proferred the 
George Cross to Kim Roosevelt. But 
the CIA wouldn't let him accept the 
decoration. So Churchill commented to 
Roosevelt: "I would be proud to have 
served under you" in such an opera-
tion. That remark, Roosevelt is said to 
have replied/ Wag beam- than the tikes 
ration, 
Helms doubtless would be the last to 
say so out loud but I can imagine his 
reflecting that, If It hadn't been for 
what Dulles, Kim Roosevelt and the 
others,did In 1953, he would not have 
the chance to present his credentials 
to a Shah still on the peacock throne

Tom lirttil Pit

Had to Be a Tersoppr DecialerA 
THIS CITY'S BEST wisecracker pro-
posed last summer to Soviet Ambassa-
dor Anatolly Dobrynin that he make 
himself available AS a replacement for 
Sen. Thomas Eagleton on the Demo-
cratic ticket. "Mr. Dobrynin," he said 
In mock seriousness, "you would not 
be fooled by briefings from the De-
fense Department about the strength 
of U.S. weapons. You would know." 
I would not argue?even in the same 
vein?that Richard Helms, whom Mr. 
' Nixon recently deposed as director 
of the Central Intelligence Agency, 
knows more about Soviet weapons 
than leaders in the Kremlin. But it is a 
demonstrable fact that he knows more 
about them than the Defense Depart-
ment does. Helms was right, a couple , 
of years ago, when the question of 
whether or not to build an ABM sys-
tem was being argued in the Senate?
and Melvin Laird, and his research 
chief, John Foster, were wrong. 
Laird told the President that the So. 
viets were going for a first-strike cepa. 
billty with the development of the 
huge SS-9s. ,He prected they would' 
'build them at the rate of 50 or 60 a 
year. By 1974, he suggested, the Soviet 
Union, possessed of 500 SS-9s, would 
be ready to call the tune. 
1T WAS A FiticulTENING medic 
-
tion but it happencd?perhaps by coin,: 
cidence?to come at the time when 
President Nixon was trying to con-
vince the U.S. Senate to embark upon 
an ABM system. Laird's predictions Pt. 
tell neatly with the arguments Mr. Niro 
, ores men were making on' Capitol Hill. 
No doubt, the President was pleased to 
have them. 
In this context, the word frdm, 
Helms cannot have been pleasing.: 
Helms said the Soviet Union was not 
going for a? first strike; it would not 
build SS-Os at the rate of 50 or 60 per. 
year; it would not, reach the level ;of. 
500. 
As it turned 'out, Helms was right and 
Laird and Fosterwere wrong. The S?i 
viet Union built 34 more SS-9s and then' 
stopped at 310;. the balance of terror 
preserves the peace; nothing suggests 
that it can be disrupted by 1974.

It would be easier to evaluate the 
partially "confirmed" rumor that

? 
one were able to get some kind of

? :.every phase of CIA activities, how-
ever, reduces one to an evaluation of 
such extraneous but. relevant facts 
..as are available, and there is?no ex-
? pess of comfort in any of these. 
it is disconcerting to learn, for 
; example, that the background of Mr.

Nixon's dissatisfaction with him) 
nincludes disputes with both Henry 
'."KiSsinger, Mr. Nixon's 'foreign policy 
adviser, and Melvin Laird, the retir-
:?ing Secretary of Defense. 
Mr: Laird's quarrel with Mr. 
Helms reportedly stems from their 
disagreement in 1969 when Mr. Laird 
insisted that the Soviets were 
neuvering to attain a "first-strike 
'Capability" against the US and Mr. 
Helms insisted that Moscow had in 
no way shifted from its traditional 
e emphasis on defense. That we .are all 
- here may not prove conclusive-
ly that Mr. Laird was wrong and Mr. 
Helms was right, but we ARE still 
here. 
, ?;?. His dispute with Mr. Kissinger, or 
vice versa, was predictable a year ago 
when Mr. Nixon set up an intelli-
gence committee within the National 
",.Seenrily Council and made Mr. Xis-
'singer its head. Whether Mr. Nixon is 
perhaps giving Mr. Kissinger ? too 
'much Uuthority and is spreading him 
too thin would be a subjective judg-
ment incapable, for now at least, of 
objective proof. 
? But the reputed Kissinger objec-
tion that Mr. Ilelms,"was not sup--

question. The CIA director's chief

support the Administration or Dr. 
Kissinger either when the facts as he ? 
knows them dictate otherwise.. His 
job is to let?the facts fall where they 
may. 
Mr. Nixon spoke highly. of Mr.. 
Helms just year ago when. he an-
nounced that Mr. Helms would as-
sume "enhanced leadership" in plan-
ning; reviewing, coordinating and 
evaluating all intelligence programs 
and activies. By most estimates, he. 
had earned the accolade. , 
? .For one thing, he had both the 
wisdom and the courage to. oppose 
the CIA's disastrous attempt to in-
vade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in , 
1961, opposing not only the then CIA 
hierarchy but also the admirals and 
generals ;in. the Pentagon. President 
Kennedy. thereafter was as leery of 
Pentagon-counsel as Mr. Helms had 
been. "If it wasn't for the Bay of 
Pigs, I might have sent Marines into 
Laos in 1961; as a lot of people 
around here. wanted me to do." 
; Mr. ?Helms showed his perspicac-
ity also in 1967 when Air Force in-
telligence insisted that bombing 
would bring North Vietnam to its 
? 
kness, and Mr. Helms said that it 
would unite the North Vietnamese 
and firin up their resolve to fight to 
the death if necessary. Lyndon John- ' 
?son could have saved his Presidency 
and the war could have been ended 
long ago -if the White ,House had 
listened to the facts of the situation 
rather than the politics of it. 
One does not lightly endorse a 
secret police agency even when, as 
in the ?case 'of the CIA under Mr.. 
Helms, "we d6 not target on Amer- ?

spies are one of the facts of inter-

THE. VILLAGE VOICE 
7 Dec 1972 
Debriefing the press: --' 
'Exclusive to the CIA' 
by William Worthy 
In April 1961, a few days after 
the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs in-
vasion of Cuba, Allen Dulles, at 
that time the director of the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency, met in 
off-the-record session with the 
American Society of Newspaper 
Editors at their annual conven-
tion. 
Given the Cuba intelligence, by 
then obviously faulty, that had en-
tered into Washington's rosy ad-
vance calculations, he inevitably 
was pressed to tell: "Just what 
are the sources of the CIA's infor-
mation about other countries?" 
One source, Dulles replied, was 
U. S. foreign correspondents who 
are "debriefed" by the CIA on 
their return home. The usual 
practice is to hole up in a hotel 
room for several days of intense 
interrogation. 
Much of the debriefing, I've 
learned over the years, is agreed

sociates attributed the misleading 
coverage to a number of factors. 
Especially cited in the survey 
were the transcending win-the-
war .and anti-Bolshevik passions 
of Times personnel, as well as 
"undue intimacy" w:th Western 
intelligence agencies. 
After 1959, when Fidel Castro 
came to power after having 
ousted the corrupt pro-American 
Batista regime, Miami became a 
modern-day Riga: a wild rumor 
factory from where Castro's 
"death" and imminent overthrow 
were repeatedly reported for sev-
eral years. Both in that city of ex-
patriates and also in Havana, 
"undue intimacy" with the CIA 
caused most North American re-
porters covering the Cuban revo-
lution to echo and to parrot of-
ficial U. S. optimism about the 
Bay of Pigs invasion. 
In the summer of 1961, on my 
fourth visit to that revolutionary 
island, a Ministry of Telecom-
munications official told me of a 
not untypical incident shortly 
before the invasion. Through mer-
cenaries and through thoroughly 
discredited Batistianos, the CIA 
was masterminding extensive 
sabotage inside Cuba?a policy 
at least one case, as admitted to 
me by the. Latin-American spe-
cialist on one of our mass-circula-
tion weekly newsmagazines, the 
debriefing took- place very reluc-
tantly after his initial refusal to 
cooperate was vetoed by his supe-
riors. But depending on the par-
ticular foreign crises or obses-
sions at the moment, some of the 
eager sessions with the CIA 
debriefers bring' handsome re-
muneration. Anyone recently re-
turned from the erupted Philip-
pines can probably name his 
price. 
Despite its great power and its 
general unaccountability, the CIA 
dreads exposes. Perhaps because 
1 a "prickly rebel" family repu-
tation stretching over three gen-
erations, the CIA has never 
approached me about any of the 
48 countries I have visited, 
including four (China, Hungary, 
Cuba, and North Vietnam) that 
had been placed off-limits by the 
State Department. But the secret 
agency showed intense interest in 
my travels to those "verboten') 
lands. In fact in those dark days; 
Eric Sevareid once told me that 
, Allen Dulles,. the intelligence 
of a "moderate" New York-based 
national organization, supported 
by many big corporations, that 
has long worked against employ-
ment discrimination. The CIA 
cash was paSseJ to the organiza-
tion's direetor by a highly placed 
Eisenhower arlinintsfration of-
ficial overseeing Latin-American 
affairs who later became gover-
nor of a populous Middle Atlantic 
state, and whose brothers and 
family foundation have long been 
heavy contributors to the job op-
portunity organization. 
Because of the serious implica-
tions for a press supposedly free 
of governmental ties; I relayed, 
this information to the American 
Civil Liberties Union. I also told' 
Theodore Brown, one of A. Philip 
Randolph's union associates in 
I the AFL-CIO Brotherhood of 
Sleeping Car Porters. Ted's re- . 
sponse has always stuck in my 
children in their classrooms an 
women where they shop.. 
On one such occasion a born

earlier, at 9.03 p. m., an ambitiou 
U. S. wire-service corresponden

from the Western Union , tele 
printer in his bureau office, re-
porting the explosion that, awk-
wardly for him, came five min-
utes after the CIA's schedule 
time. When that corresponden 
and most of his U. S. colleague 
were locked up for ,a week or Lw 
during the CIA-directed Bay o 
Pigs invasion and were then ex 
pelled, many U. S. editorial writ 
ers were predictably indignant. 
Except perhaps in Washingto 
itself and in the United Nation 
delegates' lounge, the CIA' 
department on journalism 
probably busier abroad than wit, 
newsmen at home. In 1961, durin 
a televised interview, Waite 
Lippmann referred casually t 
the CIA's bribing of foreigi 
newsmen (editors as well., as lb 
working press), especially at th 
time of critical elections. All ove 
the world governments and politi 
cal leaders, in power and in op 
position, can usually name thci 
journalistic compatriots who at

Trotsky who once observed tha

U. S. newsmen. In early 1967, 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk ex-
pelled a black reporter after 'just 
24 hours. In an official statement 
the Ministry of Information al-
leged that he "is known to be not 
only a journalist but also an agent 
of the CIA." In a number of Afro-
Asian countries, entry visas for U. 
S. correspondents, particularly if 
on a first visit, can be approved 
only by the prime minister or 
other high official. 
As recently as a generation ago. 
it would have been unthinkable 
for most U. S: editors, publishers, 
newscasters, and reporters to ac-

White at the Emporia Gazette or 
a Robert Maynard Hutchins at the 
University of Chicago, the rebuff 
would have been as explosive as 
the retort to the CIA five or six 
years ago by the president of the 
',New Mexico School of -Mines. 
Describing himself as a "fun-
damentalist" on fidelity to intel-
. 
:.lectual freedom and on adherence 
to professional codes, he told me 
of his having been asked by the 
CIA to alert the agency whenever 
any of his faculty members were 
. about to t:?avel abroad "so that we 
can ask them to keep their eyes 
open." "You people . ought to be 
put in jail," he spat at the agent.. 
?"YOU have no right to involve aca-
.demics and innocent people in 
your dirty business." To his disap-
pointment, however, not everyone 
on his teaching staff saw it his 
way. At the next faculty meeting, 
when he related the conversation, 
some of the professors missed the 
underlying principle by asking: 
"Well, what's wrong with the 
CI A's proposition?" . 
? At Harvard, during our 1956-7 
Nieman Fellowship year, New 
York Times correspondent Tony 
Lewis and I were told by an an-
thropologist that during 
'at the State Department at the, 
height of the cold war, she had 
been horrified to find herself 
reading CIA transcripts of the' 
debriefing of academics upon 
:their return home from foreign 
"scholarly" .trips. She had com-
plained to the Social ? Science 
Research Council, but , at that 
time was unable to get that pro-. 
tigious body to denounce the prac- ; 
lice. 
But now the times?and the all-
important intellectual climate= 
have changed, thanks in large 
part to a new image of the govern-
ment after its eye-opening crimes 
and disasters in Indochina and 
elsewhere. Today, to at least 
some degree, a goodly number of 
the most respectable spokesmen 
for establishment journalism are 
fighting the government's insis-
tence on turning newsmen into ex-
tensions of the police and prosecu-
tion apparatus. 
? Under the sobering impact of 
dismaying troubles ahead, the 
older, tradition of this country is 
re-asserting itself, Far fewer of us 
are still living in the fool's para-
dise of the Eisenhower-Kennedy 
years. In the mass media and on 
the campuses the "fun-
damentalists" may never become

a majority. They don't have to. 
They are again "raising a stan-
dard to which all honorable men

sequent case, in Which the Siipreme 
Court has just denied. review, raises 
the specter of Government censorship 
to a far, greater degree?Marchetti v. 
United ;States. . 
' April, 1972, the Government in-
stituted. legal proceedings against' 
Victor L. Marchetti, a former...CIA. 
'agent; by- obtaining a temporary 
re-
straining order from the United States 
District Court for the' Eastern District ? 
'of Virginia. The ' temporary order, 
'which later became a preliminary and' 
permanent injunction, requires Mar-
chetti to submit to the C.I.A., thirty 
stays_in. advance _oLrelease,...all writ-
ings, even fictional, which relate or 
purport to relate to intelligence, intel-
ligence activities, or intelligence 
sources and methods. 'The C.I.A. may,, 
forbid disclosure of any information,. 
which it has classified and which has 
not been placed in the public domain 
by prior disclosure. The basis of this 
broad injunction 'was a secrecy agree-
/neva Signed by Marchetti in 1955 
when he began working for the CIA. 
The decision of the District 'Court 
was affirmed, with .slight mddification, 
by the 'Court of Appeals for the Fourth 
Circuit. It is that oninon which now 
stands by 'reason of the Supreme 
Court's denial of certiorari. 
Although the 'Circuit Court of Ap-
peals' opinion does allude to the im-
portance of the First Amendment, it 
allows the C.I.A. full discretion to pre-
vent the publication of any material 
which is "classified" and not' in the 
public domain. The ruling means that 
once material has been stamped "clas-
sified," ,no court may look .behind that 
stamp to determine whether or not it 
is-reasonable?let alone necessary. 
In effect, it purports to allow the 
executive branch unfettered discretion 
in determining what information can 
be withheld from the public. 'It im-
poses no requirement. that .some need 
for secrecy exists. ; ? , 
While a? traditional view of the First 
Aniendment would impose a firm man-
date against any prior restraint by the 
Government, it cannot be denied that 
some judicial inroads have been made 
on this doctrine. A recent example is, 
of course, the Pentagon Papers case 
where there was a temporary period 
of restraint to enable the judiciary, 
at Various levels including the Supreme 
Court, to determine whether or not 
dissemination of, the publications 
would be harmful to the -nation: In 
the Marchetti case, however, the de-
cision of the Circuit Court of Appeals 
'allows prior restraint by the execu-
tive branch without meaningful WI. 
cial review. 
Moreover, by holding that the courts 
may .not leek behind the goverhitifeit 
label of "classified," the Fourth Circuit., 
would abrogate the important role of 
the judiciary to protect the First 
Amendment rights of the people. To,' 
allow the executive branch such uni-
lateral determination not only under-
mines the very purpose of the First 
Amendment but it serves to weaken 
the whole concept of responsible gov-
ernment so vital in a democracy. 
While it is difficult to?attribute ally- 
concrete reason to the denial of re-
view by the Supreme Court, one can 
hope that the determining factor was 
that no attempt to restrain publication 
of specific material had been made. 
In its brief to the Supreme Court,' 
the 'Government argued that the issue 
of prior restraint as posed by the 
Marchetti' situation was' now only 
"academic." It emphasized that Mar-
chetti had not yet submitted any pro-
posed publication to the' C.I.A. and 
that the C.I.A. had not denied approval 
for publication of any material. To that' 
extent, the Marchetti case can be dis-
tinguished factually from the govern-
ment's action to restrain publication 
of the Pentagon Papers. 
Should Marchetti proceed with his 
writing and should the C.I.A. order the 
deletion of certain materials prior to 
publication, the Supreme Court justices 
could still determine that judicial re-
view of the appropriateness of such 
deletions is required.

The Myth and the Madness 
By Patrick J. McGarvey 
Saturday Review. 210 pp. $6.95 
By THOMAS B. ROSS 
NOTHING WOULD better serve the 
American people in their current stage 
of cynicism, paranoia and fear of re-
pression than an honest book from in-
side the CIA. There have been a number 
of competent books by outsiders and a 
number of cover stories by insiders, 
notably Allen Dulles's The Craft of In-
teffige.nce and Lyman Kirkpatrick's The 
Real CIA. But no one yet has .success-
fully shed the eloa!;-. as he turned in his 
dagger. Victor Marchetti, who rose to the 
top suite of the CIA only to quit in dis-
illtisionment, is trying to publish a book 
about his expericnc. But the lower 
courts have upheld tlie ar,ency's demand 
that it be sin yr(.:..c.ft and there is no 
guarantee that the Niipreme Court, which 
ruled so narrowly in the case. of The 
New York Times and The Washington 
? THOMAS B. ROSS, Washington bureau 
chief of The Chicago :tin-Times, is co-
author of The InriMce Government. 
Post, will. extend the 'First Amendment 
to an ex-CIA operative. 
Into the breach comes Patrick J. Mc-
Garvey, a former intelligence officer of 
14 years' service in the military, the CIA 
and the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
The fact sthat .he has gotten into print 
might suggest that the CIA feels it has 
nothing to fear from him. And certain 
deletions in the advance-proofs indicate 
a degree of censorship or at least self-
censorship. (Hold the page to the light, 
and you can read through the inked 
crossovers?a familiar process recalling 
the Pentagon's decision to publish a 
censored version of the Pentagon Paper 
after the full text was in print. Foreign 
agents come see what we really think is 
sensitive.)-
. 
But McGarvey's book, though flawed?
almost fatally so?by bad writing, bad 
taste and bad logic, contains several 
startling disclosures, allegations and hor-
ror stories: how the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
recommended a retaliatory air strike 
against the Israeli . naval base that 
launched the attack on the U.S. intelli-
gence ship Liberty in the 1967 Middle' 
East war; how CIA agents obtained a 
sample of King Farouk's urine from the 
men's room of a gambling casino in 
Monte Carlo; how an investigation of 
the Pueblo fiasco turned up 'the fact 
that the Air Force had been flying a 
routine reconnaissance, mission over Al-
bania for 12 years, without purpose and 
*without authorization; how a leper col-
ony in' North Vietnam was bombed on 
the advice of the CIA that it was an 
army .headquarters; and how CIA psy-
chologists rewarded Vietcong defectors 
by. subjecting them to ghoulish experi--
melds in which they were exposed to 
rapid changes in color, light and tem-
perature. 
MeGarvey also lodges serious allega-
tions against a number of important in-
dividuals and institutions. He contends 
that Richard M. Helms made his way to 
the top of the CIA by .systematically de-
stroying his competitors: Ray Cline, for-
mer deputy director for intelligence and 
now head of .the State Department's 
Bureau of Intelligence and Research; 
Admiral Rufus Taylor, 'Helms's former 
deputy; and Admiral William (Red) Ray-
born, his predecessor. "I thought for a 
time When I was director of the 'CIA," 
McGarvey quotes Rayborn as telling 
him, "that I might be assassinated by 
my deputy." 
McGarvey also accuses Helms' of blunt-
ing the investigative spirit of the major 
newspapers and /magazines by taking 
their correspondents to lunch and keep-
ing them happy with periodic leaks about 
other matters and other agencies. 
16 
Ile alleges further that Congress has 
given the CIA a veto over which senators 
and representatives are to be seated on 
the subcommittees that are supposed to 
serve as watchdogs on the agency's activ-
ities. 
Against the obvious implication of 
many of his citations, McGarvey's thesis 
is that the crucial problem with the CIA 
is mismanagement, not an excess of 
power and secrecy or a lack of account-
ability. ? 
"CIA is not a ten-foot ogre," he writes.' 
"It is merely a human institution badly 
In need of change. CIA is not the invisi-
ble government. Rather, it is a tired old ? 
whore that no one has the heart to take 
off the street." 
Too much intelligence is collected, Mc-
Garvey argues, and toe little is properly 
analyzed. There is less danger in the 
CIA's excursions into sabotage and sub-
version, he contends, than in the insati-
able electronic search that put the U-2, 
the Liberty and the Pueblo in extremis. 
His recommendations for change are 
rather forlorn. He concedes that Con-
gress has abdicated its responsibility, the 
so-called oversight committees sitting 
mute through I [elms's annual "lantern 
slide show," wilfully ignorant of how 
much is being spent on Intelligence and, 
wire, never informed before or after 
the fact about covert operations. Yet 
McGarvey's cure is the weary old recom-
mendation: write your congressman ? 
the one, perhaps, who is telling Helms 
he'd rather not know what's going on 
lest he have to assume responsibility. 
I.fear we must await a more compel-
ling book before the establishment is 
moved to reform itself. The Supreme 
Court willing, Marchetti may provide it 
for .us. It does not seem too much to 
ask that he be able to use his CIA expt., 
rience to inform the people, when the 
three ex-CIA agents of the Watergate 
bust-in (or were they, too, just on loan 
for the campaign?) ? can apply their 
ragency-imparted expertise to subvert 
the political process of a supposedly free 
nation.

secrecy stories 
By Luther Huston 
Reporters who write "inside" stories 
about the operations of government intel-
ligence agencies could find themselves in 
trouble because of a Federal Court of 
Appeals ruling in the cage of Victor L. 
Marchetti. 
Marchetti signed a secrecy oath, which 
is required of all CIA employees, when he 
went to work for the agency 14 years ago. 
He resigned in 1969 and wanted to write 
a book about the CIA and arranged with a 
publisher to publish it. His years with 
CIA gave him 'access to many of the agen-
cy's secrets. 
When the CIA learned of his plans for 
a book, it sought an injunction against 
publication, claiming the secrecy provision 
of his contract. applied. Opposing issuanee 
of a restraining order, Marchetti claimed 
an injunction would infringe his First 
Amendment rights. ? 
? Judge Albert V, Bryan, in U.S. District 
Court, Alexandria, Va.,- rejected the 
First Amendment argument, held that it 
was a question of Contract law, and issued

raA? 
actuality was V,irginia's Camp 
Peary, taken over by the De-
partment of Defense 21 years 
ago. ? 
The newspaper said it was 
told by Maggio that he was at 
Camp Peary for three months 
in 1966, enrolled in a "special 
intelligence tradecraf course" 
given CIA recruits. 
It said Maggio said in the 
interview that the "training 
methods and techniques cov-
ered by the CIA" at Camp 
Peary included "assassination 
training, demolition training, 
parachute training, courses in 
wiretapping and intelligence-
gathering, and experiments 
with special weapons for use 
In the field, including what 
Maggio labeled as 'mini-
nuclear bombs." 
'Disneyland of War' 
The Gazette quoted Maggio 
as saying, "I'm sure if you 
had a blue ribbon committee 
go in there, they'd find a 
whole new world ? a Disney-
land of war." 
The Gazette quoted him as 
saying "the information con-
tained on Camp Peary in the 
novel is factual." 
Among other weapons the 
Gazette quoted Maggio as say-
ing are being tested at Camp 
Peary were a laser beam 
weapon used to capse bodily 
detee^ration within 24 hours, 
experimental f or mulas of 
drugs such as LSD, and a vari-
ety of chemical warfare mate-
rials. 
"Some day, somewhere," 
the Gazette said it was told by 
Maggio in a taped telephone 
interview, "that base is going 
to have a catastrophe ? some 
Dr. Strangelove explosion that 
really is going to rock that 
area." 
, a permanent injunction. Marchetti took 
. the case to the Fourth Circuit Court of 
A ppeals. 
Appeal to Ifilyncsworth 
In an opinion written by Chief Judge 
Clement F. Haynesworth, the appellate 
court affirmed Bryan's decision, holding 
that the CIA's contract with Marchetti, 
including the secrecy provision, was legal 
and constitutional. The appeals court, 
however, modified the injunction to make 
it reach only to classified information, 
inapplicable to information that is unclas-
sified or that has been officially disclosed.' 
Haynesworth wrote that, although the 
upon information that is not classified and 
has been officially made public, the court 
First Amendment precluded restraint 
in the case before it, was "concert-led with 
secret information touching upon the na-
tional defense and the conduct of foreign 
affairs, acquired by Marchetti in a posi-
tion of ? trust and confidence," and the

I P13% 
Although the Marchetti ease involved 
only, a book, the ruiiig could conceivably 
be invoked by the government in any sub-
sequent case ? involving publication of 
stories purporting to relate secret activi-
ties of a government agency. The Supreme 
Court, conceivably, might be ? asked to 
reconcile its ruling in the Pentagon Pa-
pers case that prior restraint on publica-
tion was unconstitutional with the lower . 
court judgments in the Marchetti ? case.

Must We Manipulate the Underdeveloped World? 
For.ihe clandestine (Plans) side of CIA. a large insti-
tutionalized budget now sees little future in the developed 
world. In the developed free world, the stability of Gov-
ernments now makes politictil operations unnecessary. In 
the ("minimillsi developed w?Orld, these political operations

by traditional techniques seems to have been relatively

Said to have left CIA with a total net negative balance of

? In tacit agreement with this, CIA Director Helms 
rc-
ccntiy said: ? ? t ? ? 
'America's intelligence assets (sic),. however, do ?not 
exist solely because of the Soviet and Chinese threat.? 
or against the contingency of a new global conflict. The'

? makers." .; . 
Thus, where the Office' of Strategic _Services (OSS) of 
World War II was justified by a hot War; and the CIA by 
a cold war, the present justification for intelligence activi-
ties in the, underdeveloped world springs ever more only 
from, Aincrica's.role as a "great power." 
Moreover, the word "assets" above is significant. If in-, 
formation were all that were at issue, a strong case could 
be madc for getting needed inforniation when you need it, 
through open sources, embassies and reconnaissance, But 
if clandestine political manipulation is at issue, then one 
requires long-standing penetration of institutions of all 
kinds and a great deal of otherwise unimportant info;nation necessary to plan and hide local maneuvers. 
. .

? Political Control of Agents in the Field 
Because political operations pre. so sensitive and, po-
tentially so explosive, it is imperative that the agents be 
under strict control. But is this really possible? To each 
foreign movement of one kind or another?no matter how 
distasteful?CIA will assign various operatives, if only to' 
gp) information. In the process, these operatives muse 
ingratiate themselves with the .moverrient. And since they 
are operating in a context in which subtle signals -arc the 
it is inevitable that they will often signal the move-
pient that the United States likes it, or might support it. . 
Indeed, the agents themselves may think they are cor-
rectly interpreting U.S. policy?or what they think it 
should be?in delicate maneuvers which they control. 
What, for example, did it mean.When CIA ag,ents told 
Cambodian plotters that they would do "everything possi: 
he to help if a toup were mounted. (See Philadelphia 
Inquirer, April 6, 1972, "CIA Role Bared in Sihanouk, 
Ouster.") 
No one who has ever tried to control a bureaucracy 
will .be insensitive to .the problems to which these' situa-? 
tirins give rise. These problems would be dramatically 
diminished, however, if CIA were restricted to information, 
gathering and were known to be. The movements would 
then cease to look to CIA for policy signals.

AGENTS LIKE FREEDOM OF ACTION 
Writing after the war of his negotiations for the sur-
render of the German forces in North Italy, Dulles 
cautiously suggested:. "An intelligence officer in the 
field is supposed to keep his home office informed 
of what he is doing. That is quite true, but with some 
reservations, us. he may overdo it. If, for. example, 
he tells too much or asks too often for Instructions. 
he is likely to get sonic he doesn't relish, and what is ? 
worse, he may well find headquarters trying to take 
. over the whole conduct of the operation. Only a man 
on the spot can really pass judgment on the details 
ns contrasted with the policy decisions, which, of. 
course, belong to the boss at headquarters." Dulles 
added, "It has always nmazed me bow desk personnel 
thousands of miles away seem to ncquirc wisdom and 
special knowledge about local field conditions which 
they assume goes deeper than that available to the 
man on the spot." Almost without exception, Dulles 
and other OSS otter:dors feared the burden of a high-
level decision that might cramp their freedom of 
action. ?

Even when the control is tight rind effective, I. more

to rely too notch on clandestine and illicit nclivities, 
hack-alley tactics, subversion nad what is known in 
?Metal jargon as "dirty tricks." 
Finally regardless of the fads, the CIA's reputation 
In the world is so horrendous and its role in events 
so exaggerated flint it Is becoming a burden on Airier-
kiln foreign policy rather, than the secret weapon it 
was intended to be. 
.0?The New York' Times, April 25, 1966 
2. The Government should prnmptly develop and estab-
lish a public-private mechanism to provide public funds 
? openly for overseas activities Or organizations which arc 
? adjudged deserving, in th.:.) national interest, of public 
support. 
On March 29, 1967, President'iohnson said he ac-
cepted point 1 and directed all Government agencies to 
implement it fully. I-1c said he would give "serious con-
sideration" to point 2 but apparently never implemented it. 
When these operations were first proposed by Braden, 
Allen Dulles had commented favorably on them, noting: 
?Thero is no doubt in my mind that we are losing the cold 
war." Twenty years later, though we arc nolonger in any 
risk of "losing the cold mar," some would like to continue 
despite the regulations. ? 
At least one influential forrher CIA official's thinking 
was simply to move to deeper cover. And sympathy for 
-- this approach probably goes very deeply into the so-called 
"Establishment." For example, when the National Student,. 
Association scandal broke, those who ran tit: liberal, now' 
defunct, Look Magazine, were so iticensed at general ex-
pressions of outrage that they wrote their first editorial in 
thirty years(1) defending the students. In such an atmos-
phere one must expect liberal' (much less conservative) 
foundations and banks to cooperate whole-licartedly with 
the CIA whatever the cover. 
In any case, what could stieli deeper cover be? In l'oe 
first place, commercial establishments or profit-making 
organizations are exempt from the ban. Hence, svith ot 
without the acquiescence of the Officials of the company. 
!CIA agents might be placed in strategic. positions. H 
possible also that organizations which seemed to be volun? 
tary were actually, incorporated in such a way as to /IN 
profit-making, Othcr possibilities nelude enriching Indi., 
victuals by throwing business their way and having !hest.. 
individuals support suitable philanthropic enterprises. 
To the extent that these_arrangementsmwich voluntar) 
'organizations, they pose the sante problems whichsreatec 
the distress in 19(m6. in short, the policy approved ill Presi? 
dent Johnson was sensible when it proscribed "tiVrecf ot 
indirect" support. Moreover, in' the coining gencration.:we 
can expect n continuation of the existing trend toward 
whistle-blowing. The CIA's reputation and its ability in, 
keep secrets can be expected to decline. Even the most . 
`7,tiiirect"'support may eventually become known. ? 
? 
All of these deep cover arrangements are made much 
easier by the intelligence community's so-tailed "alumni 
association." These arc persons who arc knowo, to. the,. 
community through past service and, who arc willing to 
turn a quiet hand or give a confidential favor, Sometimes, 
much more is involved, Examples from the past include 
these. A high official of CIA's predecessor?the Oflice 
of Strategic Services (OSS)?becosnes head of the CIA-
financed National Committee for a Free Europe, Another 
becomes an official of the CIA-funded American. Friends 
of the Middle East, A Deputy Director of State Depart-
ment Intelligence becomes President of Operations and 
Policy Research, Inc., a CIA conduit which financed 
"studies". of Latin American electoral processes. (This 
official is simultaneously well placed to 'arrange studies, 
of elections as the Director of ,(he American Political 
Science Association!). 
Thus, i. large and growing domestic network of perions 
trained in dissembling, distortion, and human nuinipula.-
tion, may be growiqg in our country. And the use of these 
kinds of skills may also be growing more acceptable. 
During the Republican campaign for President, a memo-
randum went out to Republican college organizers Welt 
urged them to arrange a mock election and gave _what 
seemed to be pointed hints about how to manipulate' the 
election. 
This kind of thing produces a suspicion and paranoia. 
that divides Americans from one another. It makes them. 
.ask -questions .about their associates, colleagues, secre-
taries and acquaintances'?questions that are destroetive 
of the casual and trusting atmosphere traditional in Amer-
ica. (Already, mibclievable numbers of persons Acem to 
assume that their phones are tapped find their mail read.) 
As 'lie public sense of cold war dissipates; the American 
distaste for secret organizations can be expected to-grow. 
The occasional disclosure of- any "dirty trick" or political 
panipulation sponsored by CIA will certainly deepen thi$ 
sense of unease, lo the end, as now, miiny of the best ant, 
most sophisticated colleee graduates will not be willing 
to work for the CIA. And professional consultants will he 
discouraged -as well. The result can change the charadem 
of the Agency in such a way as to further threaten Ameri? 
can values, 
. One method. in the American tradition, for keeping CIA 
honest would he a public-interest organization of alumni 
of the intelligence community (and those who are serviced 
-by intelligence in the Government). This public interest 
group would, as dn so many others, offer its testimony to 
Congress on mailers of interest to it?in this case, Hoc!. 
ligenc?. The testimony niight be given in public or in exec-
utive session, as appropriate; And Constructive suggestions 
and criticisms could he'rnade. ? 
Such an organization wank!' have a credibility*and au-
thority that no other group 611 have and a general knowl-
edge of The relevant intelligence problems facing the nation, 
and public, it goes without saying that no one in this 
organization, or communicating. with it, would violate 
laws, or oaths, associated with' classified information. The

Downgrading the U.N. 
? The above title appeared over an editorial on this page 
last week, commenting on President Nixon's removal of 
George Bush as United States Ambassador to the United 
Nations in order to make him Chairman of the Republi-

headline comment on Mr. Nixon's nomination of John A. 
Scali to replace Mr. Busp at Turtle Bay. 
Mr. Scali was known; as a shrewd, aggressive foreign 
affairs reporter for The Associated Press and the Ameri-
can Broadcasting Company:. As an unofficial liaison 
between State Department and Soviet Embassy in Wash-

the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. But his only official

appeal to their constituency, the sknowledge?of secrets only 
makes them vulnerable to tlic flietir that they leaked a

functions. The most common resolution has Failed for a ?' 
Joint Committee on intelligence, and ...there is much *to be 
said for it. Such a renewal of Congressional authority to ! 
review such matters might strengthen Congressional over- . 
tight. 
Two more recent 'efforts, both sponsored by Senator 
Stuart Symington, have tried different tacks. One resolu-
tion called for a Select Committee on the Coordination Of 
U.S. Government activities abroad:* such a committee 
. would have authority over CIA and DOD foreign activities 
in particular. Another approach called for limiting the 
.U.S. intelligence expenditures of all kinds to $4 billion.' 
Senator Clifford Case ? ( Rep., Ni.) has sought to control. 
.The .CIA by offering resolutions that simply apply to "any 
agency of the U.S. Government." These resolutions em 
body existing restraints on DOD which CIA was circum-
venting: c.g. he sought .to prevent expenditure of funds 
for training Cambodian military.forces, In short., Senator 
Case is emphasizing the fact th4 CIA is a statutorily de-.

Congress can Control. ! ; ? ? 
Congress has not only given the Executive Manch a' 
blank check to do intelligence but it has not even insisted 
; on seeing the results. The National Security Act of 1947 ? 
requires CIA to "correlate and evaluate intelligence relat-o.

Johnson were all guilty of overbuilding and overselling 
the U.N. ambassadorship as a Cabinet-level job virtually 
on a par with that of Secretary of State. Stripped of the 
hyperbole, however, it remains by a wide margin the 
most important of United States ambassadorial posts.

Watch o a the Media 
By Herbert Mitgang 
More than five years after the Free-
dom of Information Act became 
Federal law, it is still difficult for 
journalists, historians and researchers 
to obtain information freely. The idea 
behind the law was to take the rubber 
stamp marked "Confidential" out of 
the hands of bureaucrats and open up 
public records, opinions and policies 
of Federal agencies to public scrutiny. 
It hasn't worked that way. 
When President Johnson signed the 
bill, he declared that it struck a proper 
balance, between Government con-
fidentiality and the people's right to 
know. In actual practice, it has taken 
court actions to gain access to Gov-
ernment records. An effort is finally 
being made to declassify the tons of 
documents by the Interagency Classii 
fication Review Committee, under the 
chairmanship ,of former Ambassador 
John Eisenhower. This historical sur-
vey will take years. 
But more than mere documents 
are involved. There is a matter of the 
negative tone in Washington. 
The White House and its large com-
munications staff have lengthened the 
distance between executive branch, 
Congress and the public. Of course, 
every Administration has instinctively 
applied cosmetics to its public face, 
but this is the first one operating for 
a full term under the mandate of the 
Freedom of Information Act, The Je-
suit is that official information 
especially if it appears to brush the 
Administration's robes unfavorably ? 
is not communicated but excommuni-
cated. 
The other day Senator Symington 
of Missouri, a former Air Force Secre-
tary who has been questioning the 
wisdom of the President's B-52- foreign 
policy in Southeast Asia, said: "I would 
hope that during this session of Con-
gress everything possible is done to 
eliminate unnecessary secrecy especi-
ally as in most cases this practice has 
nothing to do with the security of the 
United States and, in fact, actually 
operates against that security." 
This point was underscored before 
the House Subcommittee on Freedom 
of Information by Rear Mm. Gene R. 
La Rocque, a former Mediterranean 
fleet commander who since retiring 
has headed the independent Center for 
Defense Information. Admiral La 
Rocque said that Pentagon classifica-
tion was designed to keep facts from 
civilians in the State and Defense 
Departments and that some Congress'-
men were considered "bad security 
risks" because they shared informa-
tion with the public. 
Reputable historians trying to un-
earth facts often encounter Catch-22 
conditions. The Authors League of 
America and its members have resisted 
those bureaucrats offering "coopera-
tion" on condition that manuscripts 
be checked and approved before book Herbert. Mitgang is a member of the 
ing and Urban Development has 
denied requests for information about 
slum housing appraisals. The Depart-
ment of Agriculture turned down the 
consumer-oriented Center for the 
Study of Responsive Law in Washing-
ton when it asked for research mate-
rials about pesticide safety. 
The unprecedented attempt by the 
Administration to block publication 
of the Pentagon Papers, a historical 
study of the Vietnam war, took place 
despite the Freedom of Information 
Act, not to mention the First Amend-
ment. And the Justice Department is 
still diverting its "war on crime" 
energies to the hot pursuit of scholars 
who had the temerity to share their 
knowledge of the real war with the 
public. Such Government activities 
not only defy the intent of the Free-
dom of Information Act; they serve 
as warnings to journalists, professors, 
librarians and others whose fortunes 
fall within the line of vision ? 
budgetary, perhaps punitive? of the 
Federal Government. 
The executive branch's battery of 
with 
media 
watchmen 
are 
busiest 
broadcasting because of its 'franchises 
and large audiences. At least one 
White House aide, eyes glued to the 
news programs on the 'commercial 
networks, grades reporters as for or 
against the President. In one case that 
sent a chill- through network news-
rooms, a correspondent received a 
personal communication from a highly 
placed Administration official ques-
tioning his patriotism after he had 
reported from North Vietnam. Good 
news (meaning good for the Ad-
ministration) gets a call or a letter of 
praise. 
The major pressure on the commer-
cial and public stations originates from 
the White House Office of Telecom-
munications Policy, whose director 
has made it clear that controversial 
subjects in the great documentary 
tradition should be avoided. The same 
viewpoint has. been /echoed by the 
President's new head of the Corpora-
tion for Public Broadcasting, which 
finances major programs on educa-
tional s.tations. This Government cor-
pot'ation is now engaged in a battle 
to downgrade the Public Broadcasting 
Service, its creative and interconnect-
ing arm responsible for serious news 
shows. 
Long before there was a Freedom 
of Information Act, Henry David 
Thoreau was jailed for speaking out 
and defying the Government's role in 
the Mexican war, last century's Viet-
nam, "A very few men serve the State 
with their consciences," he wrote, 
."and they are commonly treated as 
enemies by it." Grand juries, sub-
poenas and even Government jailers 
will be unable to overpower today's 
men of conscience.

Corned the appointment of El-

him as a man of "moderate

The desenpuon contrasted 
with the standard Soviet prop-

budget is not likely to be re-

However, Western observers 
here saw today's relativelY,

Richardson to the Soviet

of Washington's policy [of

THE NEW REPUBLIC 
DECEMBER 16, 1972 
An Interview with Oriana Fallaci 
ISSINGER 
In his White House office, November 4, Henry Kissinger 
talked with the distinguished Italian journalist, Oriana 
Fallaci, and his remarkable taped conversation with her, 
reprinted in full here, first appeared in the magazine L'Eu-
ropeo. "Why I agreed to it," Mr.: Kissinger later com-
mented, "I'll never know." 
The Editors 
Fallaci: I wonder what your feelings are, these last few 
days, Dr. Kissinger. I wonder if you too are disappointed, 
like us, like most of the world. Are you disappointed, Dr. 
Kissinger.? 
Kissinger: Disappointed? Why? VVhat has liaripened, 
within the last few days, to disappoint me? 
Q: Something unpleasant, Dr. Kissinger: although you 
said that peace was "within reach," and although you 
confirmed that an agreement with the North Vietnamese 
had been drawn up, peace has not conic. The war goes on 
as before, and worse than before. 
A: There will be peace. We're determined to obtain it 
and we shall have it. It will come within a few weeks 
or even less, i.e. immediately following the resumption 
of negotiations with the North Vietnamese for the final 
agreement: This is what I said ten ,days ago and I re-
peat it. Yes, we'll have peace within a reasonable pe-
riod if Hanoi accepts another meeting before signing 
the agreement, a meeting to define the details, and if 
they accept it in the same spirit and with the same 
attitude adopted in October. Those "ifs" are the only 
uncertainty of the last few days. An uncertainty, how-
ever; that I refuse even to consider; you are giving in 
to panic, and one shouldn't panic in cases like this. 
Nor succumb to impatience. The fact is that . Well, 
we've been conducting these negotiations for months, 
and you newspaper people wouldn't take them seri-
ously. You kept on saying they wouldn't end in any-
thing concrete. Then, suddenly, you proclaimed that 
peace was already around the corner, and now, finally, 
you say the negotiations have failed. That way you 
take our temperature every day, four tient% it dity, thit 
you take it from Hanoi's point of view. 'And ... please 
take note, I understand Hanoi's point of view. The 
North Vietnamese wanted us to sign on October 31: a 
proposition that was reasonable and unreasonable at 
the same time and . . . No, I don't want to engage in 
polemics on this subject. 
Q: But had you actually engaged to sign on October 31? 
A: I say and repeat that they were the ones who in-
sisted on this date and that, to avoid an abstract de-
bate about dates that seemed in fact merely theoretical 
at the time, we replied that we'd make every effort to 
conclude the negotiations within October. 31. But it. 
was always clear, to us at least, that we wouldn't be 
able to sign an agreement until the last details had 
been discussed. We couldn't be expected to respect a 
date merely because, in good faith, we had promised 
to exert every effort to do so. So where does that put 
us? At the point where those details still need to be 
discussed and a further meeting is indispensable. 
They say it isn't indispensable, that it isn't even neces-
sary. I.maintain it is indispensable and that it will take 
place. It will take place as soon as the North Vietnam-
ese summon me to Paris. But this is only November 4, 
today is November 4, and I can quite understand the 
North Vietnamese not wishing to resume negotiations 
just a few days after the date on which they had asked 
us to sign. I can understand this adjournment on their 
part. But it isn't, conceivable, to me at least, that they 
should refuse to agree to .a further meeting. Especially 
now, when we have already covered ninety percent of 
the road and are near our destination. No, I'm not dis-
appointed. I should be, certainly, were Hanoi to break 
the agreement, were Hanoi to refuse to discuss any 
alterations. But, no, I can't believe it. I can't even sus-
pect that we've come so far only to fail on a matter of 
prestige, of procedures, of dates, of nuances. 
Q.: And yet, it looks as if they've really stiffened, Dr. 
Kissinger. They've reverted to a harsh vocabulary, they've 
proffered serious, almost insulting charges against you . . . 
A: .0h, that doesn't mean a thing. It's happened be-
fore and we've never paid any attention. I'd say that 
serious charges, even insults, are part of a normal pic-
ture. Essentially, notlilagiiii Eliiihned: 
Octtibor 31, nitice, that is, we've calmed down here, 
you keep on asking me whether the patient is ill. But 
I can discover no illness. And I really believe things 
will fall out more or less as I claim. Peace, I repeat, will 
come within a matter of weeks after talks are resumed;

item: about the twenty-two Americans shot down in their 
helicopter by a Vietcong grenade three dais after October 
31. And while you condemn haste,. the American Depart-
ment of Defense is sending fresh arms- and munitions to 
Thieu. Hanoi is doing-the same: 
A: That was unavoidable. It always happens before a 
cease-fire. Don't you remember the maneuvers in the. 
Middle East at the. time of the cease-fire? They lasted 
for two years, to say the least. You know, the fact that 
we're sending Saigon arms and that Hanoi is sending 
arms to the North Vietnamese-quartered' in South Viet-
nam means nothing. Nothing. Nothing. And don't 
make me talk of Vietnam any more, please. 
Q: Won't you even talk of the fact that, according to some, 
the agreement you and Nixon have accepted is, to all prac-
tical purposes, an act of surrender to Hanoi? 
A: That's absurd! It's absurd to say that President 
Nixon, a President who, towards the Soviet Union and 
Communist China, and on the eve of his own election 
has taken up a stance of assistance and defense as 
regards South Vietnam against what he considered a 
North Vietnamese invasion . . . it's absurd to think 
that such a President could surrender to Hanoi. And 
why should he surrender now? What we have done is 
not a surrender. What we have done is give South 
Vietnam an opportunity to survive under conditions 
that are, today, political rather than military. It is now 
up to the South Vietnamese to win the political con-
test awaiting them, as we have always maintained. If 
you compare the agreement we have accepted with 
our proposals of May 8 last, you will see that it's 
almost the same thing. There are no great differences 
between what we proposed last May and what the 
draft of the accepted agreement contains. We haven't 
added new clauses, we haven't made new concessions. 
I totally and absolutely reject the opinion of a "sur-
render." But that's really enough about Vietnam 
now. Let's talk of Machiavelli, Cicero, anything except 
Vietnam. 
Q: Let's talk of war, Dr. Kissinger. You're not a pacifist, 
are you? ( 
A: No, I really don't think I am. Even if I respect gen-
uine pacifists, I don't agree with any pacifist and espe-
cially with half-and-half pacifists: you know, those 
that are pacifists one way and anything but the other. 
The only pacifists I agree to talk to are those that bear 
the consequences of non-violence right to the end: but 
even to them I talk willingly Merely to tell them that 
they will be crushed by the will of those that are strong 
and that their pacifism can lead to nothing but hor.

'Hitler; for instance, was a necessary one. By that I 
don't mean that war is necessary as such; that natiols 
have to wage war to preserve their :virility. What' I 
mean is that there are certain principle's for which 
nations must be ready to fight. 
Q: And what can you tell me about the war in Vietnam, 
Dr. Kissinger? You have never been against it, have you? ? 
A: How could I be? Even before I occupied the position 
I occupy today. . . . No, I have never been against the 
war in Vietnam. 
Q: But don't you think [Arthur] Schlesinger is right when 
he says that all the war in Vietnam has managed to prove . 
is that half a million Americans,.with all their technology, . 
were unable to defeatpoorly armed men dressed in black 
pajamas? 
A: That's a different problem. If it is a problem whether 
the war in Vietnam was necessary, a, just war, rather 
than. . . Opinions of that kind depend on the position , 
one takes up when the country is already caught up in 
the war and all there remains is to devise a method to 
extricate it. After all, my, our part has been to reduce 
increasingly America's involvement in the war, and 
then terminate the war. Eventually, history will judge,, 
who achieved most: whether those who merely criti-
cized or we who tried to reduce the war and then 
ended it. Yes, judgment belongs to posterity. When a.. 
country is involved in a war, it's not enough to say: 
we must put a stop to it. One must end it wisely. And 
that's very different from stating that we were right to 
start the war. 
Q: But, Dr. Kissinger, don't you think it was a useless war? 
A: I may agree. But don't forget the reason why we 
started that war was to prevent the North gobbling up 
the South, to enable the South to hold on to its terri-
tory. Of course, by that I don't mean that we had no 
other aim; it was something more as well. But today I 
am not in a position to judge whether the war in Viet-
nam was a just one or not, whether it was useful or 
useless for us to become involved in it. But are we still 
talking of Vietnam? 
Q: Yes, and, still concerning Vietnam, do you think you 
might say that these negotiations have been and are the 
most important undertaking in your career, or even in 
your life? 
A: The most difficult undertaking. Often, too, the most 
painful. But maybe it isn't right to describe them as 
the most difficult undertaking: it LS entiee accurate to 
say that they have been the most paitifiii ittitleetaking. 
Because they involved me erfidkiiMaY? N'Ai4 WI/ firs-.

'ally difficult task. As for describing those negotiations 
!: as the most important thing I've ever done. . . No, what 
I wanted to achieve wasn't merely peace in Vietnam: it 
. was three, things. This agreement, the rapprochement. 
with China and a new relationship with the Soviet 
, 
Union. I have always attached great imporiance to the, 
:problem of a new relationship with the Soviet Union.. - 
II'No leis, I might say, than to the rapprochement with 
'}Chin?nd the end of the war in Vietnam. 
1(2i A d you've done it. You succeeded ivith China, you 
icurcee Icdwith Russia, yoit almost succeeded with peace: 
frilliie nam. So, at this point, Dr. Kissinget, 01 ask you the, 
. , 
''sai,neuestion I asked the astronauts when they, were fly-? 
I 
!hing to theAloon: "What next? What wilryou do after tIt, ' 
; MoOttA what more can youldo than your astronaut's job?" 
.. 1  ' f 
iilAi ! Oh:! And what did the astronauts answer? 
Q: TO question bewildered them, and they answered:; 
"We'd see.. I don't know." 
A: Neither do I. I really don't know what I'll do after-
ward. However, unlike the astronauts, I'm not be-; 
; lwildered. I've always found so many things to do in 
I. life mid, I'm certain that when I leave this job'. . 
Of course, I'll need some time to recuperate, .a decom-
pression period; one can't be in the position I now: 
- occupy, then leave it and begin something else at; 
'Once. However, once decompressed, I'm certain of; 
finding a worthwhile job. I don't want to think about; 
It noW. It could influence my. . my work. We are liv-; 
ling in such a revolutionary period that to plan one's'; 
life, nowadays, is to revert to a Victorian middle-class 
mentality.. 
9: Would you go back to teaching at Harvard? 
A: I might. But it's very, very unlikely. There are more, 
'interesting things. And if, after all the experience I've 
acquired, I'm unable to keep on leading an interesting 
life, it will be my own fault entirely. Besides, I've by, 
! no means decided to give up this job yet. You know, 
enjOy it very mach. 
Q: Naturally. Power is always seductive. Dr. Kissinger, to 
what extent does power fascinate you? Try to be sincere. 
!A: I will be. You see, when one wields power, and 
when one has it for a long time, one ends up thinking 
one has a right to it. I'm sure that when I leave this job 
!I shall feel the lack of power. However, power as an 
instrument in its own right has no fascination for me. 
1 don't wake up every morning exclaiming by God, 
isn't it extraordinary that I am able to dispose of a 
plane, that 'a car with a driver waits at my door? Who 
would have thought it possible? No, I'm not interested 
in such reflections. And if I do happen to entertain 
them, they certainly never become acleterminating 
'factor. What interests me is what one can achieve with 
,l power. Splendid things, believe me. . . However, it 4 
1 , 
not the craving for power that has spurred me on tO 
take this job. If you examine my'political Past, you will 
; 
, discover that President Nixon couldn't have been inr 
H. cluded in my plans. I've been against him in three 
.elections. 
? ? ? ' 
' Q: I know. You' even once declared that .Nixon "wasn'i ' 
. ! 
. ? . .. 
. suited to be President.", Does this fact ever make rule I 
, embarrassment in.Nixon's presence,..Dr. 
A: I don't remember the exact words I Ma) hate use( 
?,l-against, Nixon. I presume that is more': or lesswhat 
? !, must have said, since the phrase is consta tly :quote( 
between inverted commas. However, if :I ail say it, it' 
a proof that 'Nixon was not included in inyI plahs for 
?,: rise to power. As for feeling embarrassatent'? in hii 
presence. .. No, I didn't know him, that's all. My atti-
, 
!tude towards him was the conventional highbrow one 
that's all. I was wrong. President Nixon has show 
great -strength, great skill. In summoning me to, hi. 
I. side, too. I had never met him'when he offered me Mil 
job. I was astonished. After all, he was acqu, inted with 
; the unfriendly and unsympathetic : attitud I had ail 
ways assumed towards him.'Yes indeed, lie showec 
great courage in turning to me. 
Q: He made a good deal, Dr. Kissinget'. Except for ai 
charge people proffer against you today, tlat you ar 
Nixon's mental nurse. 
? A: It is an utterly senseless charge. We mustn't forget 
!! that, before he ever met me, President Nixon had been 
very active in matters of foreign policy.. It had always 
':been his consuming interest. Even before he waS 
elected it was obvious that foreign policy mattered 
greatly to him. He has very clear ideas on t le subject.; 
He is a strong character. Besides, a weakling would 
'inever have been twice nominated presidential candi-
date, would never have survived in politics for scii, 
long. You can think what you like of President Nixoni: 
but one thing is certain: you don't become President: 
of the United States twice running becolise you're' 
! another man's tool. Such interpretations or- romalltid 
! and unjust. 
I 
9: You're very fond of him, Dr. Kissinger, aren't your 1 
, A: I have great respect for him. 
Q: Dr. Kissinger, people say you don't care allout Nixon., 
.They say all you care about is the job you are doing. They1 
say you'd have done it under any president. 
A: I on the other hand, am not at all so sure I could 
have done what I've done with him with another pres-
ident. Such a special relationship, I mean the relation-; 
ship between the President and me, always depends! 
on the style of both men. In other words, I don't know 
many leaders, and I've met several, who would have,

Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100040001-2 
the courage to send their aide to Peking without tell-
ing anyone. I don't know many leaders who would 
entrust to their aide the task of negotiating with the 
North Vietnamese, informing only .a tiny group of 
people of the initiative. Really, some things depend 
on the type of president. What I've done was acheived 
because he made it possible for me to do it. 
Q: And yet, you have been an adviser to other presidents 
too, presidents who were Nixon's opponents, in fact. I 
mean Kennedy, Johnson. 
A: My position towards all presidents has always been 
the same: I let them decide whether they wanted 
my opinion or not. When they asked for it, I gave it 
to them, telling them all, indiscriminately; what I 
thought. I was never concerned with what party they 
belonged to. I answered Kennedy's, .Johnson's and 
Nixon's questions with the same independenCe. I gave 
them the 'same advice. There was some difficulty in 
'Kennedy's case, true. In fact, people usually state that 
I disagreed with him. Well, yes, it was my fault, in 
substance. I was much too immature at the time. More-
over, I was only a part-time adviser; one can't hope to 
influence a president's day-to-day politics if -one only 
meets him twice a week while there-are others-who-see 
him every day. I mean that in Kennedy's and John-
son's time I was never in a comparable position .to the 
one I now enjoy with Nixon. 
.Q: Not Machiavellian by,any chance, Dr. Kissinger? 
A: No, not at all. Why? ? 
Q: Oh, only that, listening to you, one sometimes won-
ders not how much you have influenced the President of 
the United States, but to what extent you have been in-
fluenced by Machiavelli. 
A: To none whatever. There is really very little of 
Machiavelli's one can accept or use in the contempo-
rary world. The one thing I find interesting in Machia-
velli is his estimate of the Prince's will. Interesting, 
but not such as to influence me. If you want to know 
, who has influenced me most, I'll answer with two 
philosophers' names: Spinoza and Kant. Which makes 
it all the more peculiar that you choose to associateme 
with Machiavelli. Most people associate me -with-Met-
ternich. And that is childish. My only connection with 
Metternich is a book I wrote: it was to be the first' 
volume in a lengthy study of the construction and dis-
integration of international order in the nineteenth 
century. The series was to cover the whole period up 
to the first world war, that's all. There can be nothing 
in common between me and Metternich. He was chan-
cellor and foreign minister at a time when it took three 
weeks to travel from Central Europe to the ends of -the 
continent. He was chancellor and foreign minister at a 
time when wars were conducted by professional sol-
diers and diplomacy was in the hands of the aristoc-
racy. How can one compare such conditions with the 
ones prevailing in today's world, a world where 
there is no homogeneous group. of leaders, no homo-
geneous internal situation and no homogeneous cul-
tural background? 1 
Q: But, Dr. Kissinger, how do you explain your incredible 
superstar status, how do you explain the fact that you 
have became almost more famous and popular than a pres-
ident? Have you any theories? 
A: Yes, but I won't tell you what they are. Because they 
don't coincide with the common theory. Intelligence, 
for instance. Intelligence is not all that important in 
the exercise of power,. and is often, in point of fact, 
useless. Just as a leader doesn't need intelligence, a 
man in my job doesn't need too much of it either. My 
theory -is quite different, but, I repeat, I won't tell you 
what it is. Why should 1, while I'm still in the middle 
of my jobTInstead, you tell me yours. I'm sure you too 
have some theory on the reasons for my popularity. 
Q: I'm not sure, Dr. Kissinger. I'm looking for a theory in 
this interview. But I haven't found one yet. I expect the 
root of all lies .in success. What I mean is, like a chess 
player you've made two or three clever moves. China, 
first of all. People admire a chess player who makes away 
with his opponent's king. ? 
A: Yes, China was an important element in the me-
chanics of my success. And yet, that isn't the main 
point. The main point. . . Well, why not? I'll tell you. 
What do I care after all? The main point stems from the 
fact that I've always acted alone: Americans admire 
that enormously. Americans admire the cowboy lead7: 
ing the caravan alone astride his horse, the cowboy ? 
entering a village or city alone on his horse. Without ' 
even a pistol, maybe, because he doesn't gel in for ' 
shooting. He acts, that's all: aiming at the right spot at ? 
the right time. A Wild West tale, if you like. 
Q: I see. You see yourself as a kind of Henry Fonda, un-
armed and ready to fight with his bare fists for honest 
ideals. Solitary, brave. 
A: Not necessarily brave. This cowboy doesn't need 
courage. It's enough that he be alone, that he show 
others how he enters the village alone and does every-
thing on his own. This romantic, surprising character 
suits me, because being alone has always been part of 
my style, or of my technique if you prefer. Independ-
ence too. Yes, that's very important to me and in me. 
And, finally, conviction. I am always convinced of the 
necessity of whatever I'm doing. And people feel that, 
believe in it. And I attach great importance to being 
believed: when one persuades or conquers someone, 
onemustn't deceive them. Nor can one do everything 
by calculation alone. Some believe I carefully plan 
whatever consequences on the public one of my initia-
tives or efforts may have. They believe that is a con-

' stant preoccupation of mine. On the contrary,,. the 
.I'consequences of my actions, I mean public opinion's 
r verdict, have, never worried me. I'm not asking for, 
popularity, I'm not seeking it. In fact, if. yon really

A: In tactics, not in strategy. In fact, I believe in human 
relations More than in ideas. I make use of ideas, but 
. I need human relations, as I've shown in my work.' ' 
, After all,' didn't what has happened to me happen by 
chance? FOr God's sake, I was a totally unknown pro-: 
fessor, wasn't I? How could I possibly tell myself: 
?Now I'm going to fix things so as to become an in- ' 
? ternational celebrity"? It would have been pure folly: , 
I, wanted to be where the action is, true, but I never 
paid a price to get there. I never made any concessions. 
I have always been guided by spontaneous decisions. 
One might retort: then it happed because it had to,, 
happen. That's what people always say when things.' 
:have happened. One never hears it said of things that 
haven't happened; nobody has ever written the his-
tory of things that haven't happened. In a sense, how-, 
ever, I am a fatalist. I believe in fate. True, I believe 
one mustfight to attain a goal. But I also believe there 
are ;limits to the fight a man may engage in to reach 
his gpalt 
; Q: Another thing, Dr. Kissinger: how do you reconcile,the 
tremendous responsibilities you have shouldered with the 
frivolous reputation you enjoy? How can you succeed in 
being taken seriously by Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-mai and 
Le Due Tho on one hand and be judged a carefree Don Juan 
or even playboy on the other? Doesn't it embarrass you? 
A: Not at all. Why should it embarrass me when I go 
off to negotiate with Le Duc Tho? When I'm talking to 
Le Duc Tho, I know how to behave with Le Dc Tho, 
and when I'm with a girl, I know how to behave with 
a girl. Besides, Le Duc Tho isn't agreeing to negotiate 
with me because I'm an example of all, the moral vir= 
Weft, He agrees to negotiate with me because he wants; 
certain things from me as I do from him, As a matter of ? 
'art. y, 
e if, is .1 
ints is ; 
are no more than a pastime, a hobby. Nobody devotes, ! 
too much time to a hobby: Moreover, my engageme,nt 
book is there to show I only devote a limited portion of '! 
my time to them. What's more, I often prefer to visit 
my two children. I still see them often, although I4,ss 
frequently than before. As a rule I spend Chrii4tmas, 
other holidays and several weeks in summer with 
,them, and I go to Boston once a month to see them. ! 
You probably know I've been divorced for several ; 
years. No, being divorced doesn't bother me. The fact 
? that I don't live with my children doesn't give me any 
guilt complexes. Since my marriage was through, and 
not owing to any fault on either side, there as no! 1: 
reason not to divorce. Besides, I'm much closer to ni)i; ! 
children now than when I was their mother's hu band. ; 
,I'm also Much happier in their company now. 
Q: Are you against marriage, Dr. Kissinger? 
? 
A: No. The problem of marriage for or again4t is a 
dilemma that can be solved as a question of pripciple. 
:I might marry again ... oh, yes, I might. However!, ypu 
know, for a serious person like me, after all, it is very 
difficult to co-exist with someone else and to survive 
such co-existence. The relationship between a Woman' 
and a man of my type is unavoidably very cotinplex. 
:One must be cautious. Oh, how 'hard it is for me to 
;explain these things. I'm not a person that usually 
;confides in journalists. 
Q: So I gather, Dr. Kissinger. I've never interviewed any-
one that evaded close questions and definitions like You, 
anyone that defended themselves as strenuously as you ? 
from attempts to penetrate their personality. Are y9u shy, 
by any chance, Dr. Kissinger? 
'A: Yes, I am rather. On the other hand, however, 11 ? 
.? 'believe I'm fairly well balanced. You see, there are' i 
,those that describe me as a mysterious, tormented char-I ! 
acter, and others who see me as a merry guy always' ; 
smiling, always laughing. Both; these images aiv un-ft 
true. I'm neither the one nor the other: I'm. . NO, 1

?..'3hrevitiness of KiSSiD 
By C. L. Sulzberger
dS , 
? PARIS?Numerous wor are -ap-
plied to groups of differing species 
including a school of fish, an ostenta-
tion of peacocks, a pride of lions," a' 
swarm of bees and, a shrewdness of 
apes. In considering the contemporary 
Kissinger Phenomenon?which' exists 
in other countries beSideS the United 
States?I have decided that perhaps' 
the most apt word applicable to this 
particular species is shrewdness; not 
because they are in any way; apish but 
they have to be unusually astute. 
Henry Kissinger, who gives his 
name to this form of super-counsellor, 
is not the first in American history. 
Before him there came such Presi-
-dentist advisers as Colonel HouSe (for 
Wilson), Harry Hopkins (for Roose-
velt), Mac Bundy (for Kennedy) and 
Walt Rostow (for Johnson). In ?the 
autumn of 1948, when it seemed cer-
tain Dewey would be elected U.S. Presi-
dent, I asked his principal foreign af-
fairs expert, John Foster Dune% wheth-.. 
er he would be Secretary. of State. 
. "I haven't yet decided," said Dulles 
with beguiling absence of modesty.. 
,He wasn't certain whether he Wanted 
the job. He might prefer, a position,. 
like House or Hopkins who had"muCh' 
more fun." Dulles complained tile sec-
retary Was. too tied up with political , 
Maneuvers. In the event,' Truman de-
feated Dewey and Dulles had. to wait
four years for EisenhoWer's victory. 
He solved his, problem by becoming 
Secretary of State and serving as his 
own 'Kissinger.. 
Henry Kissinger has proven to be 
the outstanding Kissinger in American

international "Kissinger." But, in vary-
ing degrees and with differing opera-
tional methods,. other Kissingers are 
active abroad. 
A.M. Aleksandrov, assistant to the 
General Secretary of the Central Com-
mittee of the Soviet Communist party, 
is.Brezhnev's Kissinger.. Aleksandrov, a 
quiet; cautious man who speaks good 
English and adequate French, is at-
tached to the Russian boss's office 
and, handles important policy matters. 
He ,travels with Brezhnev and plays a 
key. role in. many ,negotiations. 
Gen. Aharon Yariv, former chief of 
Israeli intelligence, is. now. said to be 
, .Golda Meir.',s Kissinger. He is a slender, 
fit, cool officer, unemotional and Objec-
tive. Egon Bahr, a, short, square, 50- 
. year-old. German. civil servant, with 
long thin nose,,,mouSe-colored hair and 
brown eyes, is the equivalent of Willy 
Brandt's KiSsiriger. A former journal-
:1st; he is renowned for his discretion. 
SOMC people callInin "the fox .in the 
chancery." " 
Brandt told me: .!'There. is one big 
difference between 'our type of govern-
ment and yours. I have a Cabinet in 
a different sense than Nixon.' While ? 
I make decisions on the general -lines: 
of foreign policy; my, Foreign Minister, 
(Scheel,, who also heads the. Liberal. 
party in Brandt's coalition) is still re-
sponsible for policy vis-?is Parlia-
ment. 
"Bahr gets only ad hoc . tasks.. And 
there is stronger .coordination between . 
his work and the Foreign Ministry than 
is the practice in the U.S.A. Kissinger 
deals with all your foreign policy. Bahr.. 
is more my. ambassador at large. First 
he worked on negotiations with Mos-
-P-erse-r-
cow. Then on Berlin and relations with 
the 'G.D.R. (East Germany). So it is 
really different. But I suppose Bahr 
might, be called the nearest thing I 
have to a Kissinger." 
The English Kissinger?or. the near-
est equivalent?is Sir Burke St. John. 
Trend, Secretary to the Cabinet. Trend 
.is a tali, pale, white-haired man with 
glasses. He graduated from Oxford 
where he' studied 'the Classics and, 
after entering the Civil Service, worked 
.for the Education :Ministry, then, the? 
Treasury. His particular role will be 
,discussed 4.1 more detail later. 
French President Pompidou likewise. 
,has his Kissinger, a short,. thin,, subtle 
and highly intelligent man of 51 named 
Michel Jobert. Under the Fifth Repub-
lic eStablished by de Gaulle, the Presi- ? 
dent has great executive power. There-
fore the Secretary-General .of the Elysee 
Palace (Presidential ..residence). has .1 
enormous influctic,e although he is' rare7-I 
ly ?4411 known to the Public. 
?? ,Wlien Etienne Burin de Roziers 
(now:French Ambassador,to the Com-, 
mon Market) was de Gaulle's S. ecre-
tary-General, he was' .perhaPS the 
second most important man in' Franee. 
although few people were aware of 
this. The same might now be said of 
Jobert. 
Although, apart from stenographers, 
.he has only two full-time staff mem-
?bers and all told there are only fifteen, 
including experts on monetary matters, 
internal affairs and foreign policy, his 
scope is in some ways even larger than 
Henry Kissinger's: This and similar 
comparisons will be discussed in sub.-
sequent column. 
A Shrewdness of Kissingers: II 
By C. L. Sulzberger 
PARIS ?Not even the Kissingers 
of this world are entirely sitrc just 
who are full members of their climb. 
Thus I have been told at various times 
by one or another of this select estab-
lishment that Frau Katharina Focke, 
charming expert on Western Europe, 
is really Chancellor Brandt's Kissinger 
or that Robert Temple Armstrong, 
principal private secretary to the Prime 
Minister, is really Mr. Heath's Kis-
singer. In neither case is this correct:. 
Dr. Focke, now a Cabinet member 
but who recently adorned the Chan-
cellor's office, is the daughter of a 
famous German journalist and advised 
on .European matters. Mr. Armstrong, 
a charming old Etonian who Werke at 
the prime Minister's right hund and is 
an.expert on finance, is not the near-. 
est British equivalent to Henry Kis-
singer. The original of the species con-
siders Egon Bahr and Sir Burke Trend 
as his German and British peers. 
Confusion arises because it is im-
possible to have 'a genuine Kissinger 
in a parliamentary system of govern-
ment. Mr. Brandt explained to me he 
must always deal the Foreign Ministry 
into diplomatic games because the Min-
ister, Walter Scheel, also heads the 
Liberal (E.D.P.) party, whose minority 
coalition participation keeps Brandt 
Chancellor. 
Therefore, Mr. Brandt says he can 
only use Mr. Bahr as a special agent on 
an ad hoc basis and not as a full-
fledged Kissinger. That would risk 
splitting the coalition. Even with this 
limitation, there is irritation in the 
Foreign Ministry because of Bahr's role 
and a feeling that at times the ministry 
is insufficiently informed. 
Mr. Brandt also emulates President 
sytiteril af ihniteneiitS 
apart from Bahr. Horst Ehmke, Mints 
-
ter without Portfolio, has been a 
trouble-shooter doing something like 
the White House jobs of Messrs. Halde-
man and Ehrlichman. Herbert Wehner, 
Social Democratic floor leader in the 
Bundestag, serves as an idea man for 
32 
the Chancellor. 
A somewhat comparable situation 
exists in England. Sir Burke Trend is 
the closest thing to a Kissinger. When 
Henry Kissinger himself goes to Lon-
don and wants to talk with an alter-
ego he consults Sir Burke. Under the 
British.governing system Mr. Kissinger 
knows that whatever he confides to 
Mr. Trend goes to the Prime Minister 
himself, not just the Foreign Secretary. 
However, no genuine Kissinger 
would be tolerated by the English - 
Cabinet, which would resign if there 
were one, or by Parliament, which 
would raise hell. On two occasions 
when a Prime Minister tried to use the 
Kissinger formula ?during the 1938 
appeasement of littler and ripripg the 
I956 Suez c011ahofatifin withFfRiikie 
and ifirfull---,-thoro were explosions of 
wrath after the news eventually, 
leaked. 
As Cabinet secretary, Mr. Trend is in 
charge of assembling the views of all 
ministers concerned with any problem 
and, if possible, with compiling op-
tions for Prime Ministerial decisions.

But Trend is a nonparty civil servant. 
He was just as loyal to Harold Wilson 
as he is to EdWard Heath. When Mr. 
Nixon and Mr. Heath have a personal 
summit, Messrs. Trend and Kissinger 
first work out the approximate agenda. 
In France, where the position of 
President is nearer to that of Mr. Nix-
on than the position of Prime Minister 
in England or Chancellor in Germany, 
Michel Jobert has an easier time and 
less inhibited authority than his 
. equivalents in London and Bonn. 
Mr. Jobcrt is immensely intelligent 
and hard working. He often looks tired, 
rarely emerges in Paris society, is 
frequently called to the Elysee even 
on Sundays. He takes an annual one-
month holiday but returns to Paris 
every week. Although he has one 
weak arm, he plays a determined game 
of tennis, likes to paddle a kayak and 
is a passionate gardener. 
Mr. Jobert is in charge of everything 
that passes the President's desk; for-
eign policy only occupies about a third 
of his time. His job is to coordinate, 
and to get the proper experts working' 
on any problem that arises. , 
, When U.S. Ambassador Watson 
(recently resigned) arranged Mr. Nix-
on's Azores meeting with Mr. Pompi-
dou, the entire matter was handled be-
tween the White House and the Elysee; 
with Watson and Jobert discussing the 
details. Neither the State Department 
nor the Quai d'Orsay knew about it 
until the program had been settled. 
Nobody in France's executive branch 
has any complexes about not dealing 
with the Foreign Ministry. President 
. Pompidou, like General de Gaulle, con-
siders diplomacy and defense "reserved 
domains" which the Elyse? runs. Mau-
-rice Schumann, head of the Quai 
d'Orsay, has no more ultimeas 
ity than William Rogers, Lord of 
Foggy Bottom. Each is hoist by hiS 
own Kissinger.

? Mr. Kissinger originally regarded his 
primary function as that of eliciting 
options from various Government ex-

Nixon's choice. The job grew as these 
options dealt with increasingly im-

a foreign accent who had previously

arose. Mr. Nixon had his own 'coherent 
philosophy on foreign affairs and didn't 
intend to he anyone's rubber stamp. 
. The White Hotise-developed' a new 
kind of blueprint for long-term policy. 
This was featured in 1972 by the Pres-

in the road, and 'to Moscow, which was, 
regarded aS a historical landmark. The

the Kissinger approach has proven its 
value?ultimately depending on wheth-

- It was the judgment of the Kissinger

that cooled a potential crisis with Mos-

policymakers into reckoning what may 
happen to Yugoslavia when President

Mr. Kissinger has become an inter-

adding: "On more than one occasion

has been independent of the State De-

Factor in Cabinet-Making: 
A Possible Kissinger-Connally Clash 
PRESIDENT NIXON has confided 
to political intimates that one reason 
he did not press John B. Connally to 
become Secretary of State was his con-
cern that Connally could never work 
harmoniously with Dr. Henry Kis-
singer, Mr. Nixon's top foreign policy 
aide. 
As Mr. Nixon views it, a clash of 
powerful personalities, both skilled in 
the underworld wars of competing bu-
reaucracies, would inevitably break 
out if Connally took over the State De-
partment while Kissinger remained in 
charge of the National Security Coun-
cil machinery. 
Mr. Nixon gave the matter much 
thought last fall, when William P. Rog-
ers, a victim of repeated humiliations 
as Secretary of State, was prepared to 
resign beginning Mr. Nixon's ECCOMI 
term. Rogers then changed his mind 
about leaving, partly because of last 
fall's flurry of press criticism. White 
House aides now believe Rogers will 
stay no longer than one more year. . 
Kissinger is also believed to be plan-
ning his departure around the end of , 
1973, although developments abroad 
could change that tentative timetable. 
He has informed colleagues at Har-
vard, which gave him an unprece-
dented four-year leave of absence with 
full proterthm of tenure, that he does 
not plan to vet urn. 
Thus, I he grand entrance on the dip-
lomatic scene of the former Demo-
cratic governor of Texas may occur 
early in 1974 as the possible spring-
board for a switch in party registration 
and a run for the Republican presiden-
tial nomination. This is precisely the 
Connally scenario expected by some 
Nixon-wise White House aides.

Despite clamors in Congress

istic goat of a world dominated by the 
U.S., from trade to monetary relation-
ships to military power. 
The irony of the 'reform drive 
against the congressional seniority sys-
tem is that its only possible victim is 
one of the reformers' favorite commit-
tee chairmen: Rep. Wright Patman, 
the 79-year-old populist from Texas. 
After much agitation,, the reformers 
now seem likely to subject every coin-
mittee chairman to formal endorse-
ment by the House Democratic caucus. 
The only chairman who might fail that 
test is Palman, whose age, erratic be-
havior and autocratic methods as 
chairman of the Banking Committee 
will generate opposition votes in the. 
caucus. 
However, that's not at all what the 
outside reformers have in mind. They 
are not so much interested in purging 
erratic, autocratic, old committee 
chairman as in dumping conservative 
chairmen. Thus, the recent broadside 
by Common Cause against the senior-
ity system 'does not include Patman in 
its rogues' gallery of high-handed com-
mittee chairmen. The reason: Officious 
though he is, Patman s year-around 
vendetta against the banking industry 
fits the Common Cause line. 
Conservative Rep. W. R. (Bob) Poaite 
of Texas is no winner of House popu-
larity contests and will receive sonic 
"no" votes for retention as agriculture 
committee chairman. Some doves will 
vote to remove Rep. F. Edward Hebert. 
of Louisiana, personally popular but 
'hawkish, as armed services committee 
chairman. A few southerners might op-
pose Rep. Charles Diggs of Michigan, a 
black man, to become the new chair-
man of the District of Columbia com-
mittee. 
But only the vote on Patman will be 
close, and even he probably will sur-
vive. 
A footnote: the post of house ma-
jority whip (No. 3 in the Democratic 
hierarchy), now appointive by the 
speaker, would become elective by the 
caucus where it not for the aggressive 
campaign for whip being waged by lib-
eral Rep. Phillip Burton of California. 
Even old-line establishment Demo-
crats believe that since the whip's job 
has become a stepping-stone to 
speaker, it should be made elective. 
But they don't want 'Burton on the 
leadership escalator and would feel in - 
comparably safer with Speaker Carl 
Albert's presumed appointment, Cali-
fornia Rep. John McFall. They would 
relent, however, if they were certain 
that the caucus would elect a less pas-
sionate liberal than Burton ? say Rep. 
Morris Udall of Arizona.

tion of Texas politician Anne Arm-

WASHINGTON STAR 
10 December 1972 
11 
By JAMES J. WADSWORTH 
and JO POMERANCE 
The SALT arms control agreement is a 
step in the direction of a more secure world. 
But the arms race is not over. 
Indeed, while President Nixon has char-
acterized the SALT agreements as signifying 
a "new era of mutually agreed restraint," he 
at the same time ordered full speed ahead on 
new strategic weapons systems. It becomes 
all the more important, therefore, that the 
United States and the Soviet Union press for-
ward on negogiations on a comprehensive 
test ban?the measure which, above all, 
would signify that the superpewers are se-
rious about halting the arms race. 
' ONE OF THE arguments used by op-
ponents of a comprehensive test ban agree-
ment among the nuclear powers is that it 
would eliminate the testing of nuclear de-
vices for peaceful purposes. 
This opposition is based on the scientific-
ally valid point that these tests could not be 
permitted since they might be used for weap-
ons development to circumvent a test ban 
agreement. It Is contended that a total test 
ban would, therefore, force the termination 
of the highly touted U.S. Plowshare Program. 
But the fact is that the once promised 
boon to man of peaceful nuclear explosions 
may be a dangerous and perhaps worthless 
activity. 
There have been two types of industrial 
applications of peaceful nuclear explosions. 
One is for large-scale excavation proj-
? ects, such as forming new harbors, the con-
struction of canals and the creation of passes 
through mountain ranges for railroad and 
highway routes. 
The second is designed to fracture large 
volumes of rock underground ,for the purpose 
of recovering natural resources, particularly 
natural gas and oil from shale deposits. 
Other underground applications are for 
the creation of underground storage facilities 
for fuels and waste disposal and the pos-
sible stimulation of geothermal heat sources 
for electric power production. 
After several years of experience it is 
doubtful that any of these applications has 
proved to be practical. 
The United States has halted develop-
meat of devices for excavation. There have 
been no tests since 1970. In that same year ' 
a government commission concluded that a 
peaceful explosion for creating a new canal 
across the Isthmus of Panama was neither 
technically feasible nor politically acceptable. 
The tests conducted through 1970 showed 
that while radioactive emissions from these 
testa had been redueedi 41110i WA? h fill a

problem. 
Fallout presents not only environmental 
and safety hazards but a political risk as 
well. The Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 
prohibits any nuclear blast that causes radio-
active debris to drift beyond the territorial 
limits of the nation conducting the explosion. 
This is apparently a condition that cannot be 
guaranteed with the excavation type of peace-
ful explosion. Other excavation projects 
once considered and now cancelled include a 
harbor excavation at Carle Keraudren, Austra-
lia, and plans to blast a railroad pass through 
mountainous terrain in the U.S. 
The Plowshare device for the recovery 
of oil, gas and other natural resources has 
also been unproductive. The list of projects 
proposed and later cancelled is long. These 
include Project Sloop?a plan to recover cop-
per ore; Projects Bronco and Utah?both 
designed for oil shale recovery, and Projects 
Wagon Wheel and WASP?for natural gas 
stimulation. 
Of all these plans and programs promoted 
over the years only a gas stimulation program 
in the Rocky Mountains is now funded by the 
Atomic Energy Commission. 
There are three problems associated with 
the concept of natural gas recovery by nu-
clear explosion?economic, technical and en-
vironmental. The program can be economic-
ally viable only if the price of natural gas 
increases considerably over the present mar-
ket. To reduce the radiation received by con-
sumers, the gas from the nuclear-stimulated 
well must be diluted with gas from other 
sources at least tenfold before being shipped, i 
a requirement that many experts consider 
impractical. 
The full program for gas recovery calls 
for the detonation of 4,000 nuclear devices of 
1000 kilotons each in 1,000 wells over a 20-
year period. The regions where the explosions 
are to take place?Colorado, Utah, New Mexi-
co, Wyoming and Arizona?contain areas of 
high natural rock stress. It has not been 
established that these nuclear blasts won't 
cause earthquakes. 
PEACEFUL EXPLOSIONS can also 
cause the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
capability. Several near-nuclear powers, such 
as India, Israel, Japan and even less tech-
nically sophisticated nations such as Brazil, 
are understandably interested in whatever 
benefits may be produced by the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy. 
But any nation could conceivably test 
nuclear weapons under the guise of peaceful-
uses programs requiring nuclear explosions.. 
And who can be sure that any nation might 
not attempt to develop nuclear weapons to 
meet a rot or irjpu1OFR. iq lig 134iii7:

and power. 
The evidence is persuasive that the Plow-
share programs may be more trouble than 
they are worth. The excavation program has 
been hailed without achieving technically 
suitable devices for application. Nor have 
ways been found to overcome the safety, 
political and international problems. 
On balance, the entire program is simply 
not promising enough to impede the complet-
ion of a total nucleai test ban. No provision 
for continued Plowshare device development 
should be contained in a test ban agreement 
since the chances of weapons application are 
too high and the potential benefits of these 
devices as peaceful explosions are lbw. 
UNTIL THE BENEFITS of peaceful nu-
clear explosion are conclusively established, 
the nuclear powers should declare a mora-
torium on these explosions as part of a com-
prehensive ban on all .tests.A careful evalu-
ation could be conducted by an international 
-authority, perhaps the International Atomic 
Agency, to ?determine under what conditions 
peaceful explosions could be conducted in the 
future, if at all. 
Now that the American people have given 
President Nixon the "four more years" he 
wanted, he should move forward to negoti-
ate a ban on all nuclear tests. 
The name of the Plowshare program was, 
of course,inspired by a Biblical passage from 
Isaiah, "They shall beat their swords into 
plowshares, and their spears into prunning 
hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against 
'nation, neither shall they learn war any 
more." The true spirit of that ancient admon-
ition can best be realized by not allowing our 
modern-day Plowshare to stand in the way 
of the pursuit of peace.

, LONDON, Dec. 25?Some four 
.'weeks ago, at 10:30 in the 
:morning, two Scotland Yard 
!men walked into the offices of 
ithe obscure Railway Gazette, a 
monthly publication with a cir-
culation of 12,000. After pro-
ducing a search warrant, they 
proceeded to spend nearly three 
hours opening filing cabinets 
and desks for clues concerning 
a leak of a Government docu-
ment on proposed changes in 
the country's railway network. 
The incident is stirring a 
national controversy and rais-
ing new questions about the 
'relationship between the Gov-
ernment and the press. Mem-
bers of Parliament and the press 
,described the search as a sinis-
ter blow to the freedom of the 
press. And Richard Hope, the 
Gazette's editor, charged last 
week that his telephone had. 
been bugged by the police. ! 
The dispute, which has in-' 
volved Prime Minister Heath' 
in parliamentary exchanges, i.c! 
the latest in a series focusing 
on Fleet Street, Britain's publish-. 
Ing district. The Sunday Times! 
of London, which printed the 
rail report, was recently stopped 
by a court from publishing a

the United States. Libel laws, raid, which Mr. Heath defended I 
the rules of contempt, the 
claims of parliamentary privi-

in Britain. 
The case of Wiliam T. Farr; 
the Los Angeles journalist now 
in jail for refusing to reveal 
his sources, dramatically illus-
trates the differences. During 
the Charles. Manson murder 
trial in 1970,. Mr. Farr wrote 
in an article that one of' the 
Manson "family" had confessed 
to a plan to kill Richard Burton, 
Elizabeth Taylor and Frank 
Sinatra. Mr. Farr then refused 
to reveal who had told him. 
In Britain. Mr. Farr or his 
editor would probably have 
been arrested' within an hour

underscores the restraints on 
newsmen. So few Government 
documents get out. without a 
minister's approval that the 
circulation of one stirs a huge 
inquiry. 
"There are so ninny classified 
documents floating around in 
Washington that nobody pays 
any attention any more, unless 
it is really.big," said one editor 
here. "One document floats1 
around here?an innocuous one; 
at that?and they call in- Scot-
land Yard, produce search war-
rants and' touch' off a major 
controversy." 
Eyes on the United States 
Against this background of 
their own problems, British 
editors are viewing with ex-
treme interest the events in 
the United States after the 
Supreme Court decision hold-
ing that the First Amendment 
did not exempt journalists from 
the obligation to testify before 
grand juries whether or not 
they were protecting their 
sources. 
"We regret what we see go-
ing on there," said Anthony 
Howard, a former Washington 
correspondent and now the 
editor of The New Statettitum, 
"I've always Mt: It was far 
easier to be a reporter in 
Washington than in London." 
"Small things illustrated it 
all for me,". he went on. "Take 
that State Department book 
with all the home phone mini-
hers of every official. Try and

call a 'Foreign Office man- out-
side the press office at night 
or on the weekend. You'll never 
get his number. 
"Another example is the 
budget. You actually get briefed 
on, the thing before it's an-
nounced. A Chancellor of the 
Exchequer whispers an innocent 
word about the budget before 
he speaks in the House and, 
he's out of a job."

reporter usually has trouble

"British officials remain espe-

said Joe Rogaly of The Finan-
cial Times. "Anyone who has 
lived and worked in America 
knows the difference: it is like 
night and day." 
The reluctance of British of-
ficials to speak frankly to the 
press is backed by strong legal 
powers, particularly the 60-
year-old Official Secrets Act, 
which guards the Government 
from overzealous newsmen. Un-

THE; paradox about Mutual 
and Balanced Force 
Reductions?a piece of dip-
lomatic jargon as irritating as 
SALT is appealing?is that 
although nearly everyone in 
NATO wants to talk about 
them, the prospect of the 
talks actually succeeding 
makes a lot of people dis-
tinctly 'nervous. 
This nervousness is concen-
trated,. as one would expect. 
among the M Lary men 
rather than the politicians. 
And It is based on the simple 
arithmetical fad, that. if you 
have two numners, one bigger 
than the other by a certain 
ratio, reducing each of them 
by the same absoiute amount 
Increases the ratio. 
It happens that all the 
.obvious, numerical indicators 
by whichsone might compare 
the military strength of NATO 
with that of the Warsaw Pact 
in .Northern and Central 
Europe?manpower, divisions, 
tanks,' or aircraft?show a 
heavy advantage for the 
Eastern Block., And the same 
is true to a lesser extent 
even if one compares toe 
NATO forces with the Soviet 
Union on its own. For 
example, the Institute of 
Strategic Studies' count of 
main battle tanks on these 
fronts shows that NATO has 
0,000 and the Warsaw Pact 
10,000 (of which 10,000 are 
Russian). 
Such crude comparisons, of 
course, may give only the 
vaguest idea of the true 
. military balance in a 
'particular area. But 
unfortunately that is not the 
point. The SALT negotiations 
have demonstrated over the 
past two and a half years how 
'difficult it is to escape, in. 
this sort of bargaining, from

arithmetical comparisons 
balanced " has to mean 
" proportional," which imme-
diately gives the Warsaw 
Pact negotiators something to 
complain about, however 
unreasonably. And that is 
just a start. If one talks in 
terms of proportional with-
drawals of, say, American and 
Russian troops from Central 
Europe. one. tot would be pull-
ing back a fv?v hundred miles 
to their bases in the Soviet 
Union while the others were 
airlifted 3,000 miles across 
the North Atlantic. 
NATO commanders are 
already worried by the com-
Parative weakness of their 
conventional forces and what 
they regard as complacency 
among some members of the 
alliance. As. soon as they 
start trying to think what 
MUT might actually mean, 
they get even more worried. 
They fear that the end result 
might be a lopsided dis-
armament which left NATO 
simultaneously less able to 
defend herself and less con-
vinced of the:. need. to do so. 
Yet they have to admit that 
if such negotiations . could 
eventually prompt some 
measure of real disarmament, 
as opposed to in shuffling 
the military pieces around, or 
even just help to build mutual 
confidence in each other's 
peaceful intentions, they 
should be worth trying. Even 
such a small thing as an agree-

There a Way to Eradicate the Opium Poppy? 
? 
The ?Heroin Supply Problem, ? 
? by Peter J. O0crnibene 
. - 
There's no business like the illicit drug bUsiness,. 
, Peasants harvest by hand the poppy fields of Asia to 
collect the raw opium which they sell for $12 to $32 a 
kilogram, depending on its quality. A simple chemical 
process converts 10 kilograms of opium into a kilo-
gram, of heroin which can bring retail, sales on the 
streets of New York of a quarter of a million dollars. 
With. illicit opium production estimated to be in excess 
of a million kilograms a year, the heroin trade has a 
$25 billion a year potential, roughly the annual sales 
of General Motors and more than the gross national 
product of Switzerland. Most illicit opium is thought 
witio enter the international market. 
Heroin'. traffic has been supported by legitimate 
American businesses which supply the products used 
.to distribute the drug. Two years ago the House Select 
Committee on Crime documented one corporation's 
sales of small (11/2 inches square) "glassine" envelopes 
to a stationery store in Harlem. They are sometimes 
used by stamp collectors but more often used as heroin 
bags. Of the company's 1969 production of 152 million 
of these envelopes, 140 million were sold to New York 
City businesses. The Harlem stationery store probably 
did noCsell the 52 million it bought to. philatelists. 
Quinine hydrochloride and mannite are two of the 
materials used to "cut" or dilute pure heroin. A typical 
formula might be three ounces of marmite and two 
tablespoons of quinine lo an ounce of heroin. Quinine 
of course has a legitimate use as an anti-malarial drug, 
.and mannite has been used as a children's laxative. 
Crime committee 'investigators found Ailinine. .and 
marmite readily purchasable (at high prices) in several 
New York drugstores. One Harlem pharmacy' has sold 
40,000 ounces of quinine, buying it for $3 an ounce 
and selling it for up In $35, Ivhile also moving an in-
credible four tons of mannite at $5 a pound. Malaria 
and constipation have little to do with these sales. 
Stopping the sale of glassine envelopes might have 
a temporarily disruptive effect on the heroin 'trade, but. 
other means of packaging, such as gelatin capsules/ 
can take their place. 'Quinine and marmite could be 
replaced by other diluents such as lactose and dex-
!rose. To present an obstacle to drug trafficking one 
must eliminate the source 'Of supply. 
The war against the supply of heroin has so far been 
more a series of skirmishes than an alkout offensive; 
but it has had its suceesses. The Cabinet Committee 
on International Narcotics Control reported in Septem-
38 
ber that worldwide seizures of heroin and ,morphine 
base had increased from 7.3 tons. in 1970 to 21.6 tons in 
1971; 1972 seizures were said to be running at twice 
those of :last year. Turkey limited cultivation of the 
opium poppy to four provinces this year and will ban 
it altogether next year. Paraguay extradited to the 
United States a man alleged to have headed 'an opera-
tion which smuggled three to six tops of.heroin into 
the US, but the cabinet committee did not report that, 
his ring had been put out of business. Th'ailand, staged. 
a well-publicized but allegedlY phony burning of 
thousands of pounds of opium. 
Progress will probably continue to be measured by 
such episodes, but incremental steps can be counter-
acted. Higher prices for raw opium could turn sub-
stantial amounts now retained for local Consumption 
into international traffic. The governments of Burma, 
Thailand and Laos have no control over the so-called 
"Golden Triangle" where most of the world's illicit 
opium is now grown. Similar situations obtain in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan which produce about 12 
Percent of the world supply of illicit opium. The cabi-
net committee estimates it costs about $4000 to set up 
a "laboratory" which can process 100 kilograms of 
heroin a week. Even if we succeed in ,getting those 
nations, suclv as Paraguay, which are used as trans-
shipment points to stop their heroin traffic, labora-
tories could he quickly set lir ill ow remote Asian 
areas where opium is .grown, and new channels of 
distribution ?"direct from factory to you" 7- could be 
established. By the time we catch on to the changed 
pattern, a new one might have replaced it. It hap-
pened before when we thought the key to controlling 
heroin was the Turkey-Marseilles-New York route: the 
so-called French connection. Now most of the illicit 
opium is grown in the Golden Triangle. If the com-
mittee's estimate for heroin seizures in 1972 is correct, 
officials will have succeeded in capturing four percent 
of the world's illicit opium crop. 
In spite of the magnitude of the heroin supply prob-
lem, the step-up in heroin seizures has apparently had 
some effect. The price of heroin on the street has gone 
up while the purity has gone down; undercover agents 
have reported difficulty in purchasing the drug. Nek 
son Gross, the State Department's senior adviser On 
internotIoned noreottes mattpr5, lelieveb that A "gli011. 
age of drugs, will then tend to drive addicts into treat-
ment; as well as prevent them from addicting others

who might be tempted to experimeht %yith the drug." 
There seems to be some truth in Gross', statement: the 
number of heroin; users in treatment ',has increased 
appreciably in the past year. But there is a darker view. 
The addict who has. been feeding his $40 or $50 a day. 
habit by crime may increase his criminal activities to 
cover the. higher costs of getting heroin:Some might: 
turn to ;barbiturates or other drugs. More might seek 
a drug rehabilitation program; such as methadone, 
maintehance, only to stave 'off the pain of withdrawal,: 
until street heroin becomes available at cheaper prices.: 
Dick Gregory used to say: "If a twelve-yean-old kid 
ini Chicago can find a dope pusher, why can't the 
cops?" Now he talks about nine-year-olds on heroin. 
Sometimes ?police arrest heroin pushers only to find 
their hard work frustrated by other elements of the 
criminal justice system. Take the matter of bail. In the 
southern (judicial) district of New York during the 
1960s, there were 121 bail forfeitures, and 77 of them 
were by persons facing narcotics charges. These 77 
. forfeited bails totaled $836,200. Even a drastic increase 
in bail for persons arrested as narcotics couriers? has 
? 
had little effect. US attorney told the House Select 
Committee on Crime that bails for South American 
couriers had gone higher than $100,000. but that "every 
South American that's been arrested in the past three. 
years 0967-70] . . . who has posted cash bail, and I 
can't think of anyone who has done anything but post 
cash bail, every single one of them is a fugitive:" . 
The law enforcement problem cannot be laid en-
tirely on .the doorstep of the courts however. The 
Knapp Commission hearings in Ne* York found that 
some police officers there were being paid off by drug 
traffickers, an odious alliance that has led to a complete 
breakdown in law enforcement in some Communities. 
One resident told the House committee about police 
pay-offs in his South Bronx neighborhood: 
You see a squad car come up. You know. where the? 
building is so you see a squad car come up.. One . 
of them will get out of the car and go in the base-
ment, go in the hallway, or go in the back of the 
store and they will stand there talking for a while 
and then come back and get in the car-and this is 6 
regular routine all the way down.... You under-
stand, like there is three shifts. Every shift must 
. get his pay,. no one shift for the whole term, the 
whole 24 hours. There is three shift changes . 
A woman from the same community described whot 
happens when heroin activity is reported to the police: 
1 
We have seen people buy and sell the dope. We 
have seen them' bring the dcipe in. We call the 
police department. They ask your name, .phone 
number; and what apartment you are in.l... In the 
, meantime if you go around police headquarters 
you will find my name there about 50,900 times. 
called and they ask your name. FirsCI [wouldn't 
tell the,m. They tell the addicts somehow. They 
come to your house and do things to you. They 
. push your door in, and they beat your children. up ? 
or they give your children a needle. !' ?

In April the Justice Department established a "her-
oin hotline": a toll-free number (800-368-5363) which 
citizens can call from anywhere in the United States?to 
report suspected narcotics traffic. withotlt revealing 
?1 their own identity. Although 33,000 phone calls were 
received in its first three-and-a-half months of opera-. ? 
tion, only 5200 were considered "serious calls." These.... 
calls, in turn, led to the arrest .of 14 p. erscins .and the:. 
,seizure of four-and-a-half kilograms of !marijuana, 
'3300 doses. of LSD but only two gram's of.heroin. The ? 
.Justice Department has awarded 'a Madison Avenue 
firm a $124,000 contract to publicize the hotline. 
' "Once the opium poppy is .cut and the opium gum 
is diverted to the illicit market and processed into her-
oin," concludes one General Accounting Office study, 
."it is a formidable task to prevent the herOin from en-
tering the United State's." The Bureau of Narcotics and 
Dangerous Drugs and the Customs. Bureau have made 
? modest increases in their worldwide strength, and 
diplomatic efforts are being made to induce other; 
governments to cooperate in eradicating illicit opium. 
cultivation. These efforts, unfortunately, have so far 
been unsuccessful because' the governments of Burma, 
Thailand and Laos, for example, cannot 'control the 
Golden Triangle' where remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's 
defeated ? army rule the opium trade like "warlords" 
(to use one government official's characterization). 
If the US is to face up to the magnitude of the heroin - 
supply problem, it will have to realize the limits of the 
conventional methods it is now using and consider 
some unconventional ones. If American reconnais-
sance satellites can pinpoint the location of Russian 
missiles, might they nOt also be able to locate opium 
fields? If the governments responsible for opium-
growing areas.cannot control them, the United States 
might be able to assist these nations with its tech-. . 
nology and resources. We used defoliants- and other ? 
chemical agents* to destroy trees in Vietnam; perhaps . 
that same technology might be used to destroy the 
opium Poppy. The heroin supply is too, vast to ,be 
controlled by ordinary intiana?

that wasn't. 
The Russians, as well as Henry Kissinger and the North Vietnamese, 
had better look at the consequences of more war in Vietnam 
There is no reason that a liberal should accept why the 
two Vietnams ought to be reunited until it has been, 
shown that a majority of the people in both of them, or 
at least of those in the south, wish it to be so. Until 
that 'happens, a liberal would add, South Vietnam should 
have a government of its own based on some sort of 
reasonably accurate measurement of the preferences of the 
South Vietnamese. Most people in the west would accept 
those principles, as principles ; after all, it is what they 
say about that other divided nation, Germany, and they 
would be outraged if one half of Germany sent its army 
into the other half in order to insist on putting its own 
preferred sort of government into power there. The 
difference in 'Vietnam is the reluctance of so many people 
to apply these principles as the necessary test of the terms 
on which the war is ended. It was imprecision in applying 
this test that lcd Mr Kissinger to say on October 26th 
that "peace is at hand," when it turns out that it was 
not. The same imprecision is now making many bone-
weary people say that he should nevertheless embrace in 
December the consequences of what he let his eye slide 
over too easily in October: 
. By sending his bombers back north of the 20th parallel 
this week, and losing quite a lot of them, President Nixon 
has reverted to the argument of force to end the war. 
He is using the means at his disposal, as the North Viet-
namese used the means at their disposal when they sent 
their army over the 1 7 th parallel in the spring. They 
employed the firepower carried by their army ; he is using 
the? firepower of his air force. The pictures from An 
Loc and Quang Tri show that there is not much difference 
between them in what they do to the places where the 
artillery shells or the bombs fall. But there is a fundamen-
tal difference, and it should be recognised, between the 
purposes for which Mr Nixon and the North Vietnamese 
politburo are using the different sorts of power available 
to them. Mr Nixon is using the argument of force to try 
to get the North Vietnamese to agree that the next 
government of South Vietnam should be chosen by a more 
or less violence-free election. 'rite North Vietnamese are 
using their sort of force to try to insist that that govern-
ment should itself be the product of the further violence 
which they and their friends in the south would bring 
to bear after a nominal eensetirc. These are the two very 
different meanings that lay concealed beneath the skin of 
the agreement that seemed So close in October. 
? Mr Kissinger, and those who hoped he was right, had 
their eyes fixed on the passage in clause 4 of the agree-
ment which said that "the internal matters" of South 
Vietnam were to be settled between "the two South 
Vietnamese . parties." By saying that, North Vietnam 
, seemed to be renouncing its own claim to decide what 
should happen in the south ; and if the North Vietnamese. 
kept out of it all there was little doubt that .the ndry-
cominunists would win a large majority in the election. 
Presided 'linen has long been offering to hold after the 
ceasefire: It is true, of course, that clause i of the agree-
40 
matt paid due respect to the unity of Vietnam. But it 
was hoped that that was the equivalent of the letter the 
west Germans have sent to the east Germans about 
Germanl unity, a form'al but at the moment non-operative 
reminder of their right to bring the subject up again later 
on. If North Vietnam carried out its promise (clause 
'7) to withdraw its troops from Laos and. Cambodia, and 
if its men in South ,Vietnam had a real team of truce 
supervisors watching over them, it seemed that the North 
Vietnamese army could be more or less neutralised. And 
? from 1965 onwards the removal of the North Vietnamese 
intervention has been the main argtirnent used to justify, 
the American intervention. 
That was the pattern Henry Kissinger thought he saw 
in the agreement, but Le Due Tho plainly saw a different 
one. It ,has been known for some time?from Cosvn-6, 
the document the communist headquarters issued in mid- , 
September?that the Vietcong has been telling its men to ' 
organise undercover squads for a campaign of "tyrant, 
elimination, abduction and assassination" after the cease- , 
fire. Mr Thietes army and police force could probably 
cope with that if North Vietnam's 14 regular divisions' 
really did stay out of the war. But the sort of inter- , 
national inspection system the North Vietnamese turn out', 
to have been calling for makes it highly unlikely that they , 
ever intended tp stay out of it. They apparently proposed - 
a total of 250 men for the whole of Indochina, only half 
of whom would actually be allowed to travel around the 
countryside, and even those few would have had to rely 
for, transport on the people they wanted to inspect.. , 
Two states in one nation 
11 would be a bad joke, if. the old control commission 
set up in 1954 had not stopped people laughing about 
supervisors 'who supervise nothing. Such a handful cot 
inspectors could not possibly know what ,General Giap's 
men were doing in South .Vietnam, let alone check that 
they had got out of LAOS and Cambodia. This is not the 
proposal of men who, in the Guardian's bland phrase on* 
Wednesday, " know that they . . cannot win." It seems 
only too likely that North Vietnam's leadtrs wanted 
nobody watching their' army while ,it pursued its own 
definition of victory in the south after the last Americans 
had left. The question of the supervisory force is not .in 
itself the one last decision that Mr Kissinger says the. 
North Vietnamese still have to take. 'That decision is to 
leave the politics of the south to the southerners, within 
' the procedures already agreed to in October 1. but the 
powers of the supervisors arc a decisively important t4st 
of,' whether North Vietnam is really ready for that. I 
What Mr Nixon is still trying to get is the Vietnamese 
version of what lick nrtintic hnstdati4(1 for in tlermaily i 
the acceptance by North Vietnarreg leaders that there 
are 1.` two states within one nation." The INorth 
narnese went part of the way to accepting that in October, 
when they dropped the idea that the United States should" 
remove Mr Thicu front power, and put a coalition goveht-
ment in his place, before they would agree to a ceasefire.

But they will still be evading the central isst:te. so long as .

Congress Demands Peace 
Whatever 'its impact on the negotiating position. of 
the other side, it is now clear that President Nixon's 
- 12-day aerial blitz against North! Vietnam has had a. 
backlash at home that Cannot but affect the American; - 
bargaining stance.' When Henry Kissinger returns to thq 
Paris talks, he will have, in addition to Presidents Nixoti 
and Thieu, an aroused Congress looking over his shoulder. 
Republican Senator Saxbe's prediction last week that , 
"all hell is going to break loose" unless the President 
changes course in Indochina appears to be sustained by ' 
the angry mood in which Congress has convened. The 
Democratic majority in both houses ha S gone on record 
demanding an immediate end to American involvement 
'in the Vietnam conflict. Leaders in both houses have., 
warned that unless a settlement is speedily negotiated 
?by Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, accsording to Senator.. 
Fulbright?Congress will move to cut off further funds ' 
for the war effort. 
Even members of his own party are faltering in their 
support of the President's policy. Senator Percy of.'..: 
Illinois could not muster more than a 16- to - 10 vote 
among Republican Senators in support of Mr. Nixon's .' 
efforts "to end the tragic conflict in Indochina no* 
through a negro hi Id settlement," Senator Saxbe, whOse, 
defection was early and notable, spoke for many In kith 
parties when he cited the indignation of "the average 
upright American who's had enough.'' 
It is beyond dispute that, as Administration spokesmen ? 
have taken pains to point out, this ugly division. 'does-. 
not offer the !most favorable basis for American partict-
pationjn the, coming negotiations. The ',fault, however,...' 
does not lie with the critics whose patience has been:,,. 
tried beyond endurance through four long years: It rests;i 
rather with a President who has sacrificed his most.:? 
precious bargaining asset?the confidence and ?support';\ 
of a free people?by arrogantly disregarding the Coil-
guess and ordering military actions that have horrified , 
the civilized world. 
Mr. Nixon can regain the unity and self-respect this, ?/ 
nation .desperately needs by abandoning the dangerous'-, ? 
illusion that negotiation through terror is the sane 
as negotiating from strength and by sending Mr. Kissin-
ger to Paris with instructions to seek an accord that 
will guarantee the speedy safe return of American troops , 
and prisoners from Vietnam. This fundamental objective. 
has the support of all Americans. It appears to be within ? 
reach today, just as it was apparently within reach last . 
October when Mr. Kissinger proclaimed that peace was - 
"at hand."

A Last ,oduiobling- Scene 
By C. L. Sulzberger 
PARIS?When President Nixon re-
ceived French Foreign Minister Mau-
rice Schumann last September he said 
he wanted to end the Indochina war 
before his reinauguration (which he 
already expected) in order to wipe 
clean the diplomatic slate for major 
negotiations with Western Europe and 
Japan. 
There now seems to be some chance 
that this desire may be realized. Con-
tacts between American and North 
Vietnamese delegations have resumed 
nt whin i: "c.c.:gun:1W" 
and the iCissingor-i_g 
begin again Monday. 
If there is any logic to the situation 
?which may at times be doubted?
new pressures favor an end to the 
fighting, at least for U.S. involvement 
Whether there will be a total halt to , 
the purely Indochinese and purely po-
litical civil war (involving. three coun-
tries) is less probable. 
Washington is certainly eager to get 
out of the conflict. Now that the Sai-
gon Government has been given an 
impressive arsenal of ground weapons 
and tactical aircraft, the White. House 
clearly assumes the South Vietnamese . 
should be able to look after themselves 
. for a considerable time to come. 
Moreover, merciless bombing of the 
North during the December aerial of-
fensive that followed interruption of 
Paris negotiations has undoubtedly 
curbed the possibility of any serious 
resumption of the Hanoi offensive so 
frequently bruited as a possibility. 
Indications are that both Moscow 
and Peking .he been active in trying 
to encourage a settlement although it 
is not easy for either capital to indi-
cate anything other than full endorse-
ment of the North Vietnamese and 
Vietcong. France, which has little 
power in the area involved but more 
experience than anyone else, has add-
ed its own diplomatic wisdom. 
From the American viewpoint, Mr. 
Nixon is eager to start a new foreign 
chapter which will prove far ? more 
important when regarded by future his-
torians, focusing on the primordial 
areas of Europe and Japan that can 
tilt the power balance in this multi-
polar world. 
He also knows an angry Congress is 
about to assemble on his doorstep, a 
Congress in which both houses are 
dominated by his opponents. These leg-
islators have been incited by hostile 
official opinion abroad where a "reli-
gion" of unconditional peace has been 
widely expressed, most shrilly in Swe-
den. 
And, although polls indicate Amer-
Approved 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
ican public opinion is so far less exer-
cised, the influence of important and 
adverse newspaper criticism, when 
taken up and echoed by Congress, may 
veil change this situation if a settle-
ment isn't swiftly arranged. All ob-
jectivo factors therefore indicate a 
speedy formula is likely to be agreed 
upon in Paris and even truculent and. 
suspicious Saigon seems aware that 
this is inescapable.

small groups of Vietnamese were all 
involved before Tokyo surrendered in 
August, 1945. That same month the 
Vietcong's predecessor, Vietminh occu-
pied administrative buildings and pro-
claimed a republic. 
The French struck back and a series 
of negotiations occurred at Dalat, Viet-
nam, and at Fontainebleau in 1946 
but, after the struggle renewed that 
December, massive bloodshed set in. 
It hasn't ceased yet. The Indochina 
conflict has tarnished every participant.

there was a surcease of only seven 
years before flip United States, at first 
tentatively, mOVed in. The Americans 
used more napalm plus, for the first 
time, six-engined jet bombers, laser 
bombs and new types of delayed-ac-
tion mines. 
Hanoi's generals, With Soviet aid, 
built up the greatest antiaircraft artil-
lery ever seen and developed remark-
able improvements in the tactics of 
revolutionary warfare. And what both 
North and South Vietnamese did to 
trr 'Jr% :th-;IW-

description. 
Now, just as a quarter of a million 
French troops departed in 1954-5, the 
last of more than half a million 
American troops are clearly on their 
way out, leaving the Vietnamese to 
each other's mercy, which is not re-
nowned for tenderness. 
Whether, months or years hence, 
there will be a ;renewed war for that 
unification which has been denied to 
Ireland, Palestine, Germany, India and 
Korea, no one can predict. But this

against abuse. Evidently this is what President NIXON is 
determined to do, rather than to bow to the storm against 
him with which his domestic adversaries are seeking 
revenge for their election failure. By making. one of their 
main complaints the fact that the 500 American prisoners 
will not now be home for Christmas, and by accusing Dr 
KISSINGER of bad faith rather than the devious and 
secretive Communists, they arc once again playing Hanoi's 
game.. Hanoi tried to double-cross Mr NIXON into signing 
just before the elections. They are now doing the same 
with regard to the Christmas deadline. It is sad that the 
prisoners ? Will - not be home. But it would be in1initel3i 
worse if, after the Americans and South Vietnamese have . 
sacrificed so much, the Communists should be allowed to 
gain at the conference what they failed to gain in battle. 
Mr NIXON is once again being true to his pledge not 
to allow this to happen. , While still leaving all doors open 
for negotiations, he has resumed the bombing deep into 
the North which he stopped two months ago to imprbve? 
the atmosphere. In the South the intensity of the fighting 
continues to grow, as does the weight Of American bombing 
on North Vietnamese reinforcements and supplies, which 
ate now flowing on a great scale. Dr KISSINGER Was right' 
to accuse Hanoi of planning to launch a major offensive - 
under cover of a cease-fire. 
Mr NIXON'S enemies are blaming President Tatty- for 
the deadlock. But the differences between Mr N/koN and 
Mr THIEU should not be exaggerated. Mr Thicu's toughness 
in resisting American pressure has vastly enhanced his 
already considerable stature as a national leader, and 
also that Southern patriotism Which, throughout; has been

Hanoi Pressing Its Charge That

WASHINGTON POST

U.S. Snagged'Talks 
POWs Ask 
By BERNARD GWERTZMAN 
Special to The New York Tittles 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 ? 
North Vietnam has undertaken 
an effort to convince Ameri-
cans and others that the Viet-
nam negotiations broke down 
in Paris not because of its re-
calcitrance, as charged by 
Washington, but because the 
United States made new de-
mands that reopened the entire 
scope of the negotiations. 
According to Hanoi's account, 
!Henry A. Kissinger sought ma-
jor changes in at least five 
'areas of the draft agreement 
reached in October, and this 
produced counterdemands by 
North Vietnam and the ac-
knowledged impasse. 
? Hanoi has also nsserted that 
Mr. Kissinger, the chief Ameri-
can negotiator and President 
Nixon's adviser on national se-
curity, said at the Paris talks 
on Nov. 24 and 25 that the 
President would launch heavy 
bombing raids over North Viet-
nam if the United States pro-
posals were not accepted. 
Several Channels Used 
North Vietnam's rationale for 
the collapse of the negotiations, 
and the stepped-up Amierican 
bombing, is being made known 
through several channels. Xuan 
Thuy, the chief Hanoi delegate 
to the regular, semipublic Paris 
talks, provided a public explan-
ation when he appeared last 
Sunday on the American Broad-
casting Company program 
"Issues and Answers.' 
Additional amplification has 
been given to Tom Hayden, a 
leading antiwar activist, and 
David Livingston, a New York 
labor leader who opposes the 
war, by Hanoi officials in Paris 
in recent days. The Americans 
have relayed these views to 
The New York Times in sepa-
rate interviews. 
Hanpi's arguments occasion-
ally parallel the official Ameri-
can explanation given by Mr. 
Kissinger at a news conference 
on Dec. 16; but they are more 
often at odds with his remarks. c 
The North Vietnamese i 
sources said that Mr. Kissinger a 
made the following substantive P 
proposals, which, they said, d 
would have changed the agree- P 
ment drastically if they had t 
, been accepted. 
NORTH VIETNAM TROOPS e 
The Hanoi officials said that t 
Mr. Kissinger, claiming to be t 
speaking for Saigon, indirectly 
raised the issue of withdrawal t 
of North Vietnamese troops ed 
from South Vietnam. For in- th 
stance, Mr. Thuy said, "Kissin- in 
ger insisted that there should Ii 
be some phrase, some sentence S 
in the agreement, implying the 
total withdrawal of North Viet-
namese forces." 
North Vietnam has always 
refused to acknowledge the 
145,000 troops it is said to have 
in South Vietnam, and Mr. 
Kissinger said on Dec. 16 that 
although Saigon might want a 
total withdrawal, that was not 
the American position. The 
United States, Mr. Kissinger 
said, wanted language, how-
ever, that would "make clear 
that the two parts of Vietnam 
would live in peace with each 
other." 
VIETCONG RECOGNITION 
Hanoi claimed that the origi 
nal draft accord called fo 
formal recognition of the Pro 
visional Revolutionary Govern 
ment, or Vietcong, as one o 
the two political forces in 
South Vietnam after a settle 
=ire 
But the Hanoi officials said 
that Mr. Kissinger wanted to 
eliminate any mention of the 
Provisional Revolutionary Gov-
ernment. They said that he 
was trying to get language in 
which only the Saigon Govern-
ment would be recognized as a 
legitimate force in South Viet-
nam. This issue has not been 
discussed by the United States 
in public, and Hanoi did not 
provide specific examples. 
"I 
NATIONAL COUNCIL ROLE 
The original draft accord 
called for the establishment of a 
Council for National 'Reconcili-
ation and Concord, with repre-
sentatives from Saigon, the 
Vietcong and neutralists par-
ticipating. 
The Hanoi officials said that 
because of Saigon's concern, 
Mr. Kissinger wanted to reduce 
the importance of this council. 
They said that the original 
agreement provided that the 
council would be organized on 
a national and a local level, 
but that Mr. Kissinger, in the 
latest talks, wanted to elimi-
nate the lower levels of the 
council. 
Mr. Thuy said that the origi-
nal accord had set up the coun-
il as a body to oversee "the 
mplementation of the signed 
greements, of the cease-fire, of 
reserving the peace, and of 
eciding the modalities and 
rocedures for the general eleo-
ions and to organize the elec-
ions." He said that in the lat-
st talks, Mr. Kissinger wanted 
he council only to organize 
he general elections. 
Mr. Kissinger, in discussing 
he council, said that the Unit-
States wanted to make sure 
at the group could not be 
terpreted as a disguised coa-
tion government, to which 
aigon objects. 
SUPERVISORY FORCE 
Mr. Kissinger said at his news 
conference that Hanoi's propo-
sal for an international super-
visory force was inadequate to 
maintain the cease-fire since it 
would allow only 250 inspec-
tors instead of the 5,000 sought 
by the United States. The North 
Vietnamese sources said that 
the American plan would im-
pinge on the right of Vietna-
mese to conduct their own af-
fairs. Hanoi insisted that it 
would live up to the cease-
fire provisions , and rejected 
'American claims that it was 
preparing to violate the cease-
fire. 
Mr. Hayden said that the 
North Vietnamese had assert-
ed that the military provisions 
of the 1954 Indochina agree-
ment had been carried out with-
out violation even tough the 
International supervisory force 
had been limited to 350 men. 
American officials have assert-
ed that in October, Hanoi agreed 
to the 5,000-man force. Hanoi, 
however, has not acknowledged 
this. 
? PRISONERS 
The original accord called for 
the release of American prison-
ers of war within 60 days, pa-
rallel with the withdrawal of 
American forces from South 
Vietnam. It called for the re-
lease of political prisoners in 
South Vietnam within 90 days, 
Hanoi said. Mr. Thuy said that 
at the latest talks Mr. Kissinger 
had made the release of politi-
cal prisoners ? mostly Viet-
cong?contingent upon the with 
drawal of North Vietnamese 
forces." 
American officials have:iruli-
cated in recent days that Hano-
oi, in retaliaticm made a new 
proposal linking the rele4o of 
American prisoners to the re-
lease of political prisoners.: 
Tell of Bombing Threat 
The Hanoi sources insisted 
that Mr. Kissinger had threat-
ened them with renewed; and 
heavier bombing similar to 
what is now going on if the 
American proposals were: not 
accepted. That is why, Mr. 
Thuy said, children were evac-
uated from Hanoi on Dec. 3, 
before the breakdown ir( the 
talks. 
End of ar 
TOKYO, Jan. 2 (AP) 
North Vietnam Said today 
that 30 American prisoners of 
war, including 20 crewmen 
from 13-52 bombers . downed 
recently, have issued a Joint 
statement urging the U.S:' 
Congress to try to help end' 
the Vietnam war. 
The official Vietnam News' 
Agency broadcast. the text of 
the statement and the names 
of I he 30 POWs. Hanoi had re-
ported the capture of all them' 
previously. 
? The statement recalled the 
remark made in late October 
gw _Henry Kissinger, President 
Nixon's adviser for national 
security, that "peace is at 
hand" in Vietnam. 
"But," the statement contin-
ued, "now the war is more 
; fierce than ever before, and 
American lives are in grave 
jeopardy from the round-the-

members of Congress to exer-

power to bring about peace."

WASHINGTON POST 
4 JANUARY 1973 
Joseph, N7r-- 
Mr. Nixon's Decision 
'Compromised' Dr. Kissinger.. 
? IS HE the little Dutch boy, finger in 
the dike stemming the tide of disaster? 
,Or is he just a good German lending a 
cover of respectability to whatever 
' monstrous policy President Nixon is 
pleased to pursue? 
Those questions now have to be 
'raised explicity about Henry Kissinger. 
For since the 12 days of murder-bomb-
ing against North Vietnam, the an-
swer is not clear. 
It used to be. For most of the past 
four years, Dr. Kissinger has been an 
undoubted force for good. 
A supreme example is the accord 
with Russia in the Strategic Arms Lim-
itation Talks or SALT. President Nixon 
entered office hostile to an agreement. 
limiting defensive missiles, or ABMs, 
which had been projected by the John-
son administration. 
As late as January inn, Mr. Nixon 
was moving toward full development 
of an American ABM?a step that 
would have precluded any limit on ei-
ther offensive or defensive missiles. 
.But Dr. Kissinger organized within the 
administration a process of analysis 
which showed that an effective ABM 
could not be built. By the same means 
he demonstrated that it would be pos-
sible to monitor any secret Soviet 
moves to develop a full-scale ABM 
.system. 
The upshot was not that Dr. Kis-
singer changed the President's mind. 
What he did was build a track along 
which the President was able to move 
toward what eventually became the 
Moscow agreements on arms limita-
tion. 
Apart from such activities, Dr. Kis-
singer acted as a bridge to foreign 
leaders not easy for President Nixon 
to approach. In that. respect, the clas-
sic example is Premier Chou en-Lai of 
China. 
From, his first encounter with Chou, 
Dr. Kissinger sensed as not many 
Americans could sense?how much ab-
stract principle mattered to the Chi-
nese Communists. On that Inisis he 
was able to eut a deal whereby this 
country acknowledged a set of prince 
'pies that pointed to an eventual rever-
sion of Formosa to China. 
On Vietnam Dr, Kissinger has been 
at all times the chief proponent inside 
the administration for a political set-
tlement ? "The Don Quixote," as he 
once put it, "of negotiations." At the 
end, when a negotiated settlement 
seemed possible after years of effort, 
Dr. Kissinger not surprisingly became 
euphoric. He overestimated, and over-
stated In public, the easiness of bring-
ing President Nguyen Van Thicu of 
South Vietnam to support the agree-
ment worked out with Hanoi. 
Even so the agreement he worked 
out was the best one possible. It se-
cured the return of American prison-
ers and gave the Saigon Government a 
very good shot at survival. By estate 
"Ming a rei'dtutteitetion program, 
? 
gave Hanoi a powerful incentive to 
abide by the ceasefire. 
Moreover, Dr. Kissinger was not the 
only one who believed that peace was 
"at hand." The President thought so 
too, and said as much publicly on a pre-
electoral swing through Kentucky. 
Subsequently President Thieu and 
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker reached 
the President with the argument that 
Hanoi was going to break the ceasefire 
as soon as the Americans withdrew 
from Vietnam. When American efforts 
to tighten the agreement yielded only 
counterclaims from Hanoi; Mr. Nixon 
broke off the talks. He launched the 12 
days of murder-bombing to give Hanoi 
a foretaste of what would happen if in 
fact the Communists did break the 
ceasefire, 
Dr. Kissinger may have opposed the 
murder-bombing. But he certainly did 
not. put everything he had into the 
fight against what is probably the 
worst step taken by the United States 
In the memory of most Americans. On 
the contrary, several members of the 
Kissinger staff felt free to advocate 
the bombing and to knock the original 
agreement worked out by Dr. Kis-
singer. 
Furthermore, Dr. Kissinger did net 
organize a canvass of the rest of the 
government. As it turns out, there was 
significant opposition to the bombing 
inside . the Defense Department, the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central In-
telligence Agency and the State De-
partment. 
Despite all this, Dr. Kissinger re-
mains perhaps the only instrument for 
effective foreign policy available to 
President Nixon. But he has been eom?

it. Unless he gets a new mandate from

The strategy now adopted by

all this do ? Nothing is likely to. be

the death and destruction now '

and bombs. That the Vietcong and: 
North Vietnamese 'have resumed 
thoir? offensive operations in parts 
of the South is deplorable,, too, but 
the political reasoning behind it is 
more intelligible and the devasta- ? 
tion less frightful than that caused. 
by massive air and til'a bombe rd-

North and South the war is being 
resumed in all its misery and terror. 
Does President Nixon really 
believe that he can bludgeon- the 
North Vietnamese back to the con-
ference- table ? Rather the reverse' 
will happen. They are likely to 
break off diplomatic contact and dig.

are tired of the war, of course, and 
by now they must know that they

The proper course for President

was to resume only limited military 
activity. In truth, unduly heavy

unleash the bombing again with full

Power 
Without 
Pity 
By James Reston 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26?President 
Nixon has sent the bombers over 
North Vietnam again, but it is hard 
to see how this air war can go on 
for long at the present rate. 
In the first place, there are not that 
many legitimate , military targets in 
North Vietnam and the cost to the 
United States of the present offensive 
is also rising steeply. North Vietnam 
claims to have shot down eight B-52's 
and one F-4 fighter-bomber since the 
Christmas recess, and the U.S. com-
mand acknowledges the loss of eight-
een aircraft and seventy flyers since 
heavy raids began on Dec. 18. 
Second, the President no longer has 
the excuse that this heaviest bom-
bardment of the war is essential to 
stop an enemy offensive. The White 
House spokesman, Ronald Ziegler, 
linked the air raids to the threat of 
another Communist drive but no evi-
dence of this was ever produced and 
the plain fact is that nobody, believed 
him. He has since given up this part 
of his charade. 
Third, the President has mounted 
this aerial war while the Congress was 
in Christmas recess and has never , 
offered a single word of explanation 
as to why it was necessary or what it 
was intended to achieve. 
The result is that he has left the 
Impression that he is bombing, not 
as a necessary instrument of war but 
as a brutal weapon of negotiation, 
and that he feels free to turn the 
bombing on or off as he pleases. 
For the last two years, the Senate 
of the United States has tried to get 
some control of the President's power 
to fight the war as he likes, and al-
ways it has failed because a majority 
simply would not withhold funds from 
WASHINGTON 
a Commander in Chief in the middle 
of a battle; but the situation is differ-
ent now. 
He is not in the middle of a battle 
but in the middle of a negotiation and 
is insisting on using the same wea-
pons of war to compel the enemy to 
accept terms that have never even 
been made clear to the American 
people. 
Also, the excuse given by Or. Henry 
Kissinger is that the war is going on 
because the Communists elumged the 
truce terms, though the impression he 
left with French officials and others 
in Paris was that Saigon caused the ? 
impasse by insisting on sovereignty 
over all of South Vietnam, including 
territory the United States was will-
ing to leave in the hands of the North 
Vietnamese. 
Ever since October of 1970, the U.S. 
has said it was prepared to arrange 
a cease-fire in place, without demand-
ing that the North Vietnamese with-
draw their troops from the South. The 
military and political aspects of the 
truce were to be separated: there 
would be a military cease-fire, the re-
turn of U.S. prisoners, and later on 
negotiation between the Vietnamese 
themselves about the political future 
of Vietnam. 
But now the U.S. is deeply involved 
in the political future of the country 
and is complaining that the North 
Vietnamese want to "intervene" in the 
affairs of South Vietnam. What did 
Mr. Nixon and Dr. Kissinger think the 
North Vietnamese would be doing with 
troops in South Vietnam when they 
agreed to leave them there in the first 
place? 
This tangle over who ruined the 
peace at hand, however, is not the 
immediate question. Nobody had 
signed anything, and everybody prob-
ably had second thoughts When it 
came to the point of decision. The 
interesting thing is how the President 
reacted to all this, using power with-
out pity, without consultation and 
without any personal explanation. 
If this is how Mr. Nixon interprets 
the mandate of his election, we had 
better know it now, for even in the 
.long and shameful record of the Viet-
nam war we have never seen such 
power used with so little provocation. 
This is war by tantrum, and it is 
worse than the Cambodian and Lao-
tian invasions, for Mr. Nixon had at 
least a strategic .purpose in those 
offensives, and back then he ex-
plained what he thought he was doing. 
Now, Mr. Ziegler merely says "we 
are not going to allow the peace talks 
to be used as a cover for another 
offensive." If there's not an offensive, 
he merely suggests there might be 
one. If you're going to bomb North 
Vietnam, of course you have to blame 
North Vietnam for wrecking the 
talks; and if you're asked about South 
Vietnam's part in the wreck, you can't 
discuss "questions of substance." 
Maybe none of this is surprising. 
The war has corrupted everything 
else, and is now corrupting the Amer-
ican democratic process, not for the 
first time. The trouble is that this 
sort of thing is bound to produce an 
ugly confrontation with the Congress 
when the members come back early 
in the new year if there is not a lull 
in the bombing and a return to the 
negotiating table by that time. 
Violence of this intensity for such 
ambiguous reasons cannot help but 
produce trouble on the Hill, if not a 
constitutional crisis, and even more 
violence in the streets. This was not 
what Mr. Nixon had planned for the 
beginning of his second term, but he 
has treated the Congress and the 
people with contempt and even made 
a mockery of the Christmas spirit in 
the process.. 
NEW YORK TIMES 
22 December 72 
Terror From the Skies 
Asked whether civilian centers would not inevitably 
be hit during the resumed massive air .assault on North 
Vietnam, a Pentagon spokesman replied: "No. We don't 
strike civilian targets." He then amended his comment 
to say: "We do not target civilian targets." 
The difference is crucial. 
The big B-52 bombers that are being used for the first 
time over the heavily populated Hanoi-Haiphong area 
are not precision weapons. Normally they operate in 
flights of three that lay down a pattern of bombs-20 
tons to a plane? which scatter over an area more than 
half a mile wide and more than a mile and a half long. 
Even if the "targets" were strictly military, a great 
deal more than military would inevitably be caught up 
in such sweeping devastation, especially in a blitz that 
in the first two days alone is estimated to have dropped 
20,000 tons of explosives?the equivalent of the Hiro-
shima bomb. Imagine what would happen to New York 
or any other American city if a comparable enemy 
force were unleashed to attack such targets on the 
Pentagon's authorized list as rail yards, ship yards, 
command and control facilities, warehouse and trans-
shipment areas, communications facilities, vehicle-repair ? 
facilities, power plants, railway bridges, railroad rolling 
stock, truck parks, air bases, air-defense radars and gun 
and missile sights. 
It requires no horror stories from Hanoi radio to 
deduce that the destruction and human suffering must 
be very extensive indeed. And to what end? 
Officials in Washington and Saigon have suggested 
that the raids are intended to disrupt a Communist offen-
sive. But military men in Saigon say they have seen no 
indication that the North Vietnamese are preparing for 
such a strike. 
Administration spokesmen have also reported that 
this brutal assault is intended to convey, to North 
Vietnamese leaders President Nixon's displeasure over 
Hanoi's intransigence at the Paris peace talks. Only last 
week, however, a responsible American official in Paris 
indicated that the impasse centered on President Thieu's 
insistence, backed by President Nixon, that any agree-
ment specifically recognize Saigon's authority over all 
of South Vietnam. This amounts to a demand that the 
Communists acknowledge a defeat they have not suf-
fered on the battlefield. 
No matter who is to blame for the breakdown in talks, 
this massive, indiscriminate use of the United States 
overwhelming aerial might to try to impose an American 
solution to Vietnam's political problems is terrorism on 
an unprecedented scale, a retreat from diplomacy which 
this nation would be the first and loudest to condemn 
if it were practiced by any other major power. In the 
name of conscience and country, Americans must now 
speak out for sanity in Washington and peace in Indo-
china.

Margitis Childf; 
Congress Moving to Seize the Initiative for Peace 
. ALREADY taking shape following 
the disastrous failure of the cease fire 
negotiation is a determination in Con-
gress to seize the initiative for peace. 
This conies out of a growing conviction 
that the. White House now has no way 
? Out of the tanelcd web that Henry A. 
? Kissinger so painfully delineated. 
The gloss of optimism he put 04 cne 
sorry record of failed intentions and 
- the haunting, humiliating 'mernory of 
"Peace is at hand" rates as hardly more 
than cosmetics. To think that Hanoi 
will now negotiate on Washington's 
terms is the same kind of wishful 
dream stuff of a decade oI tragedy and 
frustration dressed up in ignorant pre-
; dictions of light at the end of the tun-
nel and victory just around the corner'. 
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mans-
field has been steadfast in supporting 
past attempts to use the power of the 
purse to shut down the war. Three 
times the Senate voted to out off funds 
for Vietnam after a date certain and 
three times the House rejected the 
Senate resolution. 
THIS has the highest priority for 
Mansfield today and he is determined 
in the new Congress to try once again 
to. compel the Administration to end 
? the war and bring the remaining 
American troops home. As pest efforts 
have shown that is easier said. than 
done. But the shock and total disillu-
sion over what had been heralded, in 
late October as imminent success gives 
it a new urgency. ? 
Those considering this coin-so sug-
gest that privately it might even be 
welcome to President Nixon. If Con-
gress look the initiative out of his 
hands he could say to President 
Nguyen Van Thieu in Saigon and to 
the small right wing fringe here at 
home that he had no option but to 
move out. The consequences would fall 
on Congress and not on the chief 
executive. . 
This is on the assumption that 
Thietes stubborn fear for his own fu-
ture is the root cause of the failure. 
Despite Kissinger's kind words about? 
compassion and understanding it is 
evident that Thiett worked his own 
form of blackmail to undermine the 
negotiation. Part of that blackmail has 
been the vilification of Kissinger over 
the Saigon radio in Hitlerite terms. 
IF AN)) 'WHEN Congress gets down 
to still one more attempt to bring an 
end of the shooting the charge will 
inevitably arise that this is certain to 
prolong the conflict. Every effort to 
get a negotiated peace during the past 
two years has drawn this same charge. 
It was raised against Sen. George Mc-
Govern in the campaign when he prom-
ised to end. the war,. bring home the 
troops and the American prisoners im-
mediately after his inauguration, inci-
dentally even his principal foreign 
policy advisers who are convinced that 
"peace is at hand" was part of a 
planned deception on the eve of the 
election feel that it made no essential 
. difference in the outcome. They con-
sider it to have been a kind of insur-
ance against the use of the war issue, 
by the Democrats and an extra push 
toward a landslide. 
In light of what, has now happened 
this is singularly unimportant. What 
matters is that the war, goes on with 
the massive bombing of the north 
adding thousands to the toll of dead 
and injured. These, of course, are 
"natives" and apparently in the Ameri-
can conscience count for nothing. By 
one caleulation four tons of bombs fell 
every minute night and day during the 
latest round of Kissinger-Le Due Tho 
talks. 
This will not bring an end to the 
war. It will not compel Hanoi to return 
to the bargaining table. That has been , 
amply proved in the past. The North 
Vietnamese have the will and the ca-
pacity to conduct an underground war ' 
for an indefinite time terrible though ' 
the cost may be. 
Hanoi has just signed a new military-
economic agreement with the Soviet 
Union. This will mean something in 
the ability to continue the war. If the 
United States goes to even further 
lengths to shut off Haiphong Harbor 
and bomb the land entries, the hopeful 
Nixon overture to Moscow will be in 
jeopardy. That is a measure of what 
Thieu's demand for victory, and it is 
no less than that, can cost.

After the ombino-b, hat's Next If 
the Communists Refuse to Negotiate? 
,WHAT IS MR. NIXON going to do 
now? Nuke Hanoi? Hit the dikes?' Or 
just go on bombing North Vietnam 
till hell freezes over? 
,These ...questions .are being asked ? 
rather gloatingly, in a tone implying: 
little man, what -now? They are being 
asked as though they were questions 
Without an answer. And yet there is a 
perfectly sensible answer, and Mr. Nix-
on luts already given it, 
few tveel before l OM ion; he 
was 11SkOd Al it it C10114.-111.0 press 
conference what would happen, if the 
Communists refused to negotiate -a 
settlement. His answer: 
:"As far as the future. is concerned, 
We ,believe that .our training program 
for -the South Vietnamese, not only 
oh the ground but in the air, has gone 
forward so successfully ..that if the 
enemy still refuses to negotiate, then 
the South Vietnamese will be able to 
undertake ? the total defense of their 
country." 
IF THAT ANSWER was valid then, 
it is more valid now. The South Viet-
namese have been re-equipped ? with 
tanks, aircraft and other weaponry 
on a crash basis in anticipation of the 
tease-fire that never happened. More 
inmortant, President Thieu now has. 
fOr the first time a real political base. 
He has built this .new base by the 
simple- expedient of thumbing his nose 
at :the United States, and thus appeal-
ing 'to the nationalism and .xenophobia 
of, his 'people. 
,Again and again, Thicu has reiterat-
ed the same. theme: "The Republic of 
Vietnam has ... the sole right to solve 
the war. Any solution must come from - 
the right Of self-determination of 
South Vietnam and only South Viet-
nam. And so, on. The sensible answer 
to., the ' little-man-what-now? question , 
I s to take President Thieu at his word, 
If 1rd" when it ,becomes clear that - 
there is no hepe thr?negotiating a "just 
arri uscitlement of the war. 
ThaVare t hose who think that. is 
clear _ already. There arc even those 
- (including this writer) -who think it 
? has been clear from the very begin-
ning. Obviously, it would be fine if 
Henry Kissinger could negotiate a set-
tlement that was, in President. Nix-
on's phrase 'right for South Vietnam 
right for North Vietnam, and right for 
us." Obviously, it was worth trying 
to negotiate such a settlement. Ob-
viously, if the thing could be done, 
Henry Kissinger was the man to do 
it. But could the thing really be done? 
'TO PUT ? THE QUESTION another 
? way: ? Are there really 'words in the 
dictionary that would insure a genuine 
and lasting settlement ,of the endless, 
hateful mar? If the answer to that 
question is -"yes," are they words that 
.a self-respecting American President 
could -put his : name to? And if the 
?answer to that question is "yes" are 
they words that the men in Hanoi and 
Saigon, who -hate each others' very 
guts, could put their name to? And it 
the answer to that question is "yes,". 
.would the words have any real mean-
ing at all? 
A sentence from lienry Kissinger's 
sad ?prei:s ?iint,.rimet. or Dee. it; sug-
gests the answer to the LINI, question, 
At the end of October, he said, "it 
? became apparent that there was in 
-preparation a massive . Communist 
effort to launch an attack throughout 
South' Vietnam to begin several days 
before the cease-fire would have been 
?declared, and to continue for some 
"weeks after the cease-fire came into 
being." 
The Communists, in short, were pre-
-paring to cheat on the Whole Kissinger-
'Tho agreement, and on a "massive" 
scale. .To cheat on ,agreements with 
"the imperialists .and their running 
dogs" is a' Communist imperative sanc-
tified in the Leninist holy books. No 
Communists have obeyed this impera-
tive more assiduously than the Hanoi 
Communists. So what would all those 
words that Mr. Special Adviser Kissin-
ger and Mr. Special Adviser Le Due 
Tho (they thus address each other) 
have wrangled about so interminably 
, really be worth? 
There is a. two-word answer: "Our 
-prisoners." In listing the "main prin-
ciples that the President has always 
enunciated as being part of the Ameri-
can position," Henry Kissinger listed 
."unconditional -release of American 
prisoners" first:Getting the prisoners 
back is what the whole elaborate cha-
rade has mostly been about. 
THE PRISONERS are the Commu-
nists' chief .bargaining counter: Indeed, 
they are just about their only bargain-
. 
-lug' counter vis-a-vis the United States. 
The North Vietnamese can do a lot of 
things to. hurt the South Vietnamese, 
but they can do only one thing to hurt 
this country?they can refuse to re-
lease- the prisoners. 
The North Vietnamese are, of course, 
perfectly aware of the bargaining pow-
er the prisoners provide. They have 
repeatedly offered a simple deal. We 
-Americans can have our prisoners 
back, they have said in effect, if we 
agree to halt all logistic support for 
South Vietnam, thus cutting off the 
South Vietnamese at the knees and 
insuring a Communist take-over in 
Saigon. Not only George McGovern, 
but all the Democratic presidential 
hopefuls, except Henry Jackson, were 
willing to make this deal. President 
Nixon has repeatedly denounced it-
48 
with good reason?as 'a "betrayal." He 
cannot now make such a deal, even if 
he wanted to, which he doesn't. 
Then what can he do? His own an-
swer for the moment seems to be:. 
. bomb the bejesus out of North Viet-
nam. It is conceivable, of course, that 
this may turn out to be an adequate 
answer, that the negotiations wilt start 
again and lead to can agreed settlement. 
leery Kis:tinge'. is satil in believe that 
I here is at, least. a riti tin chance of melt 
an out come, anti Henry issinger is 
no fool. 
But if there is no such outcome, the 
President surely cannot go on bomb-
ing the bejesus out of North Vietnam 
forever. To do so would make the 
United States look like a bully and a 
brute and, what is more, an ineffective 
bully and brute. If the bombing goes 
' on much longer, the Senate is sure to 
pass another "date- certain" withdrawal 
amendment and this time the House 
seems likely to go along. 
IN SHORT, with every day that. 
passes without a negotiated settlement, 
the President's real options are nar-
rowing. They are narrowing down to' 
the one remaining course, embodied 
in the answer he gave at that San:, 
Clemente press conference. 
If the South Vietnamese "undertake 
the total defense of their country," 
there is no guarantee that they will be 
able to defend it, even with generous 
American logistic support. There is no 
.guarantee either that our prisoners 
will be released. But at least the Presi-
dent will be able with justice to claim 
that he has done everything possible 
to free our prisoners, short of betrayal 
of a small ally, and that he has done 
everything possible to give that ally a" 
"reasonable chance" to defend itself. 
There would he one added advantage. ' 
The United States would not be re-
sponsible for the failure of a settle-
ment that is sure to fail.

Charles W. 17:?st 
Renewed Bombing: A Threat to Detente. 
IN WRITING a year-end retro-
spective of international relations dur-
ing 1972 it had been my expectation to 
express real jubilation at what seemed 
to me a banner year. It had been a 
banner year, moreover, despite serious 
hazards which had at critical moments 
jeopardized each one of its major ac-
complishments. 
From the United States' point of 
, view, the outstanding achievements 
were the opening of the door to China, 
after so many years in which we our-
selves had kept it shut, and the com-
mencement of a new era in relations 
with the Soviet Union, after so many 
years of cold war and almost unmiti-
gated hostility. That both of these 
were achieved was a tribute to the 
boldness and realism of the Nixon ad-
ministration -which, in these respects 
at least, was prepared to admit that 
old dogmas and delusions were dead. 
Yet each was at the last moment sub-
jected to stresses from our side and 
preserved primarily by the tolerance 
or prudence of others. 
The President's epoch-making visit 
to China in February was placed in 
hazard by the United States' effort in 
the previous U.N. General Assembly to 
push through a "two China" resolution 
which, if successful, would have made 
us responsible for once again exclud-
ing the Peoples Republic from the 
United Nations. Fortunately we were 
saved from this blunder by the defeat 
of our resolution by an Assembly ma-
jority which included most of our clos-
est friends. 
Similarly, the President's equally 
momentous visit to Moscow in May 
was called in question by his decision 
to mine Haiphong harbor and resume 
the bombing of North Vietnam, a di-
rect affront both to the interests and 
prestige of the Soviet Union. Fortu-
nately, again we were saved by the over-
riding interest of the Soviets in the 
summit and their decision to swath:ivy 
the affront and proceed with the meet-
ing, which firoved an extraordinary 
SUCCESS. 
The achievements of the year were 
not by any means limited to United 
States' relations with the Communist 
great powers. Prime Minister Heath 
triumphantly brought Britain into the 
Common Market. Chancellor Willy 
Brandt resolutely carried through his 
"Reaction of most of our 
allies . . . makes clear that 
our title to leadership of the 
'free world' is tarnished 
with each bomb that falls?' 
ostpolitik, decently 'buried the cold 
war in Central Europe and won his 
greatest electoral victory on this plat-
form. 
In consequence of these auspicious 
developments, preparations for a Euro-
pean 6ecurity Conference are well un-
der way, parallel negotiations concern-
ing mutual force reductions in Europe 
are about to begin, and the second 
phase of the strategic arms talks be-
tween the United States and the Soviet 
Union has started. There seemed every 
justification, therefore, for hailing 1972, 
not perhaps as ushering in "a genera-
tion of peace," but at least as having 
removed some of the artificial obsta-
cles to collaboration among all the 
great powers in coping with the real 
problems of the real world. 
UNFORTUNATELY, these achieve-
ments, actual and potential, have been 
thrown into hazard at the end of the 
year by the cruel and foolish resump-
tion of the bombing of North Vietnam. 
The detente with the Soviet Union and 
China removes the only convincing rea-
son for United States' concern with a 
Vietnamese war, which was originally 
? ? 
conceived of as an instrument of thCir 
expansion. 
One can therefore say that rarely in 
history has so much been risked for so 
little, as by the belated revival of the 
war risking that very detente and all, it, 
holds. Seriously as the Soviets and 
Chinese need and want mutually prof-
itable relations with the United States, 
there are limits to what they can toter-
ate in the way of abuse of one of their 
allies. Brezhnev issued a clear warning 
to this effect last week, and so did the 
Chinese. The outraged reaction of 
many of our allies, moreover, makes 
clear that our title to leadership of the 
"free world" is more profoundly tar-
nished with each bomb that falls. ? 
There seems to be an almost irresist-
ible inclination among American presi-
dents who win landslide electoral vic-
tories, to what Stalin called "giddiness 
from success." After Roosevelt's tri-
umph in 1936, he attempted his "court-
packing" and "purge," both of which 
failed miserably and might have ended 
his political career in deep disappoint-
ment but for the coming of the war. 
Johnson, within a few months of his 
1964 victory, involved us so deeply and 
-divisively in Vietnam that he soon. 
squandered the decisive majority he 
had won. Hubris has been the greatest 
curse of captains, kings and presidents 
since human history began. 
So one must, most regretfully, end 
one's assessment of 1972, which had 
seemed certain to be so positive, with 
a sombre question mark. We can only 
pray at this Christmas season that re-
sponsible men in Washington and Viet-
nam will quickly come to their senses, 
will resume with cooler heads the friv-
olously aborted negotiations, and will 
bring them to a rapid and successful 
conclusion. If they do, 1972 may still 
go down in history as marking the end 
of one era and the beginning of a Very 
different one, more rational, more con-
structive, and more humane.

and then a party. It could be beautiful 
tonight. But the last six days have 
been horrible. 
Monday afternoon, we walked 
around Hanoi among the thousands 
of bicycles that crowd the streets. 
Children everywhere were smiling at 
us, playing in the streets of what still 
looks like a lovely French city. 
Then, Monday night, the bombs fell. 
No one expected them. I stood on 
the balcony with the French reporter, 
watching tracer bullets and an occa-
sional rocket cut across the sky. 
Then, to the north, the sky grew 
red and smoke billowed against a full 
moon. Then the sky grew red to the 
west and I heard the sound of jets 
overhead. My own fear mounted and 
the Frenchman led me to the shelter. 
The sirens sounded again and again 
as wave after wave of bombers passed 
over. But the worst was around 5 a.m., 
when I was sure the hotel was next. 
TUESDAY, we saw the first pilots 
captured during last week's bombing, 
apparently still in a state of shock. 
One had bandages around his head. 
They looked so confused, hurt and lost. 
We were no longer anonymous to them 
nor they to us. 
Since then, the Vietnamese have 
shown us no more. They don't want to 
humiliate us, they say, and I believe 
them. 
Afterwards, we saw the first site?
the little village of Noc, west of the 
central city. Little shacks and rice pad-
dies were .all blown to bits and the 
ruins were still smoking from the fire. 
People were wandering about aim-
lessly, picking up their few belongings. 
I found it terrible and very painful to 
see. Bombs fell again that night and 
through Friday. 
Wednesday, we saw 12 POWs. A. 
bomb had fallen next to the camp and 
the ceilings of their rooms had caved 
in. I think they were as seared as we 
were. Joan and I conducted a brief 
Christmas service, took their names 
and promised to call their families. 
? But the worst was Friday, when we 
saw Bach-Mai Hospital?Hanes largest 
?totally destroyed. There were unex-
ploded bombs here and there, . and 
people were working to uncover the 
shelters where victims were still trap-
ped. Some of the workers could hear 
their cries. 
A Vietnamese man, helmet on his 
head, passed by. He had a notebook 
over his face to hide his tears. I was 
crying too. ' 
THE CHIEF DOCTOR talked to us 
in a voice touched with hysteria. No 
one will say how many died in the 
raid, but I am sure there were many. 
We saw collapsed buildings, rubble 
everywhere, enormous bomb craters?
some enlarging those from a previous 
raid this fall. And everywhere little 
groups of people standing, their faces 
blank with pain. 
Most of the principal services in 
Hanoi are gone. There is almost no 
electricity for the city. The railroad 
station has been destroyed and the air-
port is only semi-operational. 
That afternoon we saw the village 
of Anduong. A housing project built 
in the '50s for working people was 
totally destroyed. 
I saw an old man standing in the 
ruins of his house, putting on his coat 
and taking it off again endlessly, as 
if the ritual act could recreate his 
past. There were impassive faces but 
also many tears.

Red Cross Ends Some Vietnam Visits 
Friday night was supposed to be 
our going-away party, but it was in-
terrupted by the bombers and we fin-
ished it in the shelter, packed in like 
sardines. Joan sang freedom songs 
and two Vietnamese women sang folk 
songs among a ragtag group of Vietna-
mese and foreigners. We 'couldn't hear 
the bombs atave the music. 
So life goes on here. The streets 
still are full of bicycles and the chil-
dren still smile as we four Americans 
pass by. 
But many people are being evacu-
ated. They say everything of any Stra-
tegic worth has long since gone, 
There are only the people, and' I 
see no signs of weakening. They say 
they have fought for independence for 
1,000 years and they won't stop now. 
This afternoon I visited the Domini-
can Church. They are putting up deco-

terns and light bulbs. What little elec-
tricity there is here is going for church 
decoration. 
Over the altar a freshly painted sign 
in latin, "God has made His dwelling

They say not as many people as 
usual will come tonight, but they will 
say Mass with or without bombs. 'We 
will be there, too. 
Special to The NeW York Times 
GENEVA, Dec. 28?The Inter-
national Committee of the Red 
Cross has suspended indefinite-
ly the visits it had been making 
to political prisoners_ in South 
Vietnam. 
The suspension was decided 
upon because the South Viet-
namese authorities have denied 
the Red Cross delegates the 
right to see the prisoners in the 
absence of all witnesses, a 
spokesman for the all-Swiss 
committee said today. 
However, Red Cross visits to 
prisoners of war in South Viet-
nam continue in the normal 
way as provided in the 1949 
Geneva conventions on the pro-
tection of war victims, the 
spokesman said. 
The prisons in which civilians 
are held are officially called 
"re-education centers." Because 
the term "political prisoner" is 
frowned upon by the authori-
ties, the Red Cross refers to 
the inmates only as persons 
held "because of the events" in 
South Vietnam. 
Red Cross delegates had 
been visiting the national cen-
ters in Saigon and in the 
provinces on an irregular basis 
for a number of years, the 
spokesman said. 
Occasional Private Talks 
No general authorization for 
private talks with the prisoners 
was ever granted, but occa-
sionally such discussions with-
out witnesses were permitted by 
the official in charge of a pro-
vincial center. ? 
The Red Cross source said 
that he did not know how many 
in South Vietnam but that it 
was estimated that there Were 
22,000 in the centers that, the 
committee's delegates vi:sitel 
last year. ? 
The visits were continual un-
til last August in the hope:that 
the authorities in Saigon would 
eventually grant the authoriza-
tion to see the prisoners with-
out witnesses as provided for 
n the Geneva convention (heal-
ing specifically with civilian 
war victims. 
But after making another ap-
peal for such an authorization 
the Red Cross decided against 
pursuing the visits without it. 
"We felt that if the prisoners 
could not speak freely in the 
absence of witnesses we could 
not determine precisely what the 
prisons' conditions were like,"

Issue and Debate 
Efficacy of the Bombing of North Vietnam 
By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 
special to The New York Time, 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 25?
The resumption of sustained 
bombing by the United States 
throughout North Vietnam 
has revived the debate here 
and abroad over the, efficacy 
of the bombing strategy. , 
Does the bombing of mili-
tary and industrial targets 
significantly hamper the ca-
pacity of North Vietnam to 
fight the war? Does it pre-
vent the movement of North 
Vietnamese troops and sup-
plies into the South? Does 
it make the Hanoi Govern-
ment more willing to nego-
tiate or concede, or does it 
strengthen resistance and de-
termination to pursue the 
war? 
If there are military and 
diplomatic benefits from the 
bombing, do they justify the 
civilian casualties? What 
were the provocations that 
triggered the latest cam-
paign? Are the current raids 
different, in magnitude or in 
terms of the targets assault-
ed, from those of the past? 
Is it immoral, in time of war, 
for a large nation that it-
self is not under attack to 
drop bombs on a small nation 
? that has no offensive capaci-
ty in the air? 
r These are the questions 
that provide the meat. of the 
debate, although, clearly, 
only the North Vietnamese 
know precisely how badly 
the country, its people and 
? its military system have been 
and are being hurt by the 
bombing. 
The Background 
,Early in the morning of 
Feb. 7, 1965, on orders from 
? President Lyndon B. Johnson, 
49 carrier-based fighter 
planes bombed and strafed 
barracks, and staging areas 
of Vietcong guerrillas near 
Dong Hoi, just north of the 
border between North and 
South Vietnam. Once before 
?in August, 1964?there had 
been a day of raids on the 
North, in *retaliation for al-
leged attacks on American 
ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. 
But the 1965 strikes, follow= 
ing several guerrilla attacks 
on major American installa-
tions in South Vietnam, were 
the first involving carefully 
planned, concerted raids 
north of the border. 
President Johnson declared. 
that they represented a lim-
ited response to "provoca-
tions ordered and directed by 
the Hanoi regime" and did 
not mean a widening of the 
war. Nonetheless, these first 
sorties marked a major turn-
ing point in the Indochina 
conflict. 
In May the United States 
stopped bombing the North 
for a week in an effort to 
elicit peace feelers, but there 
was no response, so the 
bombing resumed. In Decem-
ber, 1965, a 37-day pause 
began as Mr. Johnson pur-
sued a "peace offensive." 
Bombardment of the North 
was resumed on Jan. 31, 
1966, because, according to 
Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk, the only response 
from Hanoi had been "nega-
tive, harsh and unyielding."' 
Mr. Johnson pledged that 
only lines of supply and 
other military targets would 
be bombed. As justification 
he asserted, "Those who di-
rect and supply the aggres-
sion have no claim to immu-
nity from military reply." 
The bombing continued 
unabated for nearly three 
years. By 1967 the United 
States was flying about 300 
planes a day over the North. 
In that year, according to 
the Air Force, 250 planes of 
all services were shot down. 
In September, 1967, Pres-
ident Johnson, speaking in 
San Antonio, announced that 
Hanoi had been , told the 
month before that the United 
States would stop the bomb-
ing of the N.orth "when this 
will lead promptly to pro-
ductive discussions." ? 
Mr. Johnson startled the 
nation on March 31, 1968, 
by announcing that he would 
not run for re-election. He' 
also declared that he had 
ordered a halt in all bom-
bardment north of the 20th 
Parallel, where more than 90 
per cent of the North Viet-
namese live. 
Seven months later, a 
week before the President-
ial election, Mr. Johnson. 
ended all bombing of the 
North. He said he believed 
the action would lead to a 
peaceful settlement. 
In the first year of the 
Nixon Administration, the 
Government acknowledged 
only occasional incidents of 
"suppressive fire" by small 
numbers of planes against 
antiaircraft installations in 
North Vietnam that threat-
ened American reconnaiss-
ance aircraft. 
But in May, 1970, follow-
ing the movement of Ameri-
can troops into Cambodia, 
e United Statesconducted 
a series of heavy raids on 
supply dumps and other tar-
gets north of the Demilitariz-
ed zone. The raids were de-
scribed as "protective reac-
tion." Similar attacks con-
tinued over the next two t 
rears. 
In April, 1972, in response t 
to a North Vietnamese of- L 
fensive, the rule of protec- n 
five reaction was officially 
lifted and intensive bombing 
resumed throughout the 
North. For the first time B-
52's were used extensively 
and, for the first time since 
1968. Hanoi and Haiphong 
were attacked. 
The Hanoi government as 
serted, and visiting Ameni 
can newsmen confirmed. tha 
civilian as well as militar 
targets were damaged. Hano 
maintained that the Ameri 
can planes were deliberately 
bombing dikes, a charge tha 
the United States repeatedly 
denied. 
The Nixon Administration 
gave three principal reasons 
for the resumption. It was 
necessary, officials said, to 
choke off the movement of 
men and supplies into the 
South, to help Saigon's 
forces demonstrate that they 
could stem the most serious 
enemy attack in more than 
four years and to provide 
a new bargaining chip to ob-
tain concessions from Hanoi. 
President Nixon warned in 
May that the heavy bombing 
would continue, but he 
pledged to stop it when 
Hanoi agreed to a cease-fire. 
and a return of American 
prisoners. The bombing was 
essential if a "genuine peace" 
was to be obtained, the 
President said, and it was 
necessary? to support ? the 
dwindling American ground 
troops. 
On Oct. 25, with peace 
negotiations at a delicate 
stage, the President ordered 
a bombing halt beyond the 
20th Parallel as a sign of 
good faith. The pause lasted 
until Dec. 18. 
In the eight years of the 
air war, the United States 
has dropped more than seven 
million tons of bombs on 
Indochina, more than three 
times the tonnage in World 
War II.. 
Through the end of No-
vember 1,056 American 
planes had been shot down 
by the 
Vietnamese. 
Nearly all of the more than 
430 prisoners of war in the , 
North were ...airmen, as were 
most of the more than 1,200 
men listed as missing. 
Current Bombing 
On Dec. 18 waves of Amer-
ican B-52's began the heavi-
est raids of the war on North 
Vietnam. The strikes, which 
continued unabated until a 
Christmas halt, followed the 
breakdown in peace negotia-
ions between Henry A, His-
lager, President Nixon's na-
lonal security adviser, and 
e Due Tho, Hanoi's special 
egotiator. 
Administration off dais.; 
have said that Pres'dent 
Nixon ordered the raids he.: 
cause he felt Hanoi was stalk' 
ing at the peace negotiations, 
They said that he had stis;?? 
pencled raids north of the 
20th Parallel in return for 
Hanoi's "goodwill" in Octo-
ber and had reinstated full-
- scale bombing?after the talks 
- broke down. There has been 
t? no explanation for the mas-
Y sive scale of the bombing. 
It was the first time that 
? B-52's, which carry a. crew of ? 
six or seven, had been used , 
t so extensively, and many 
military experts believed that ., 
It represented a shift in 
strategy. 
? The planes carry 20 to 30 
tons of bombs and drop them 
from a height of five to seven 
miles in a 'pattern roughly 
half a mile wide and a mile . 
and a half long. Pinpoint 
bombing is conducted by' 
fighter-bombers. 
According to some reports, 
as many as 500 plane, more, 
than 100 of them 11,52's.,!..: 
were being sent over the : 
North each day. Such figures 
were discounted by the Pen-; 
tabon spokesman, Jerry W. 
? Friedheim, who would char-
acterize the level of bombing 
only as "a very major effort." 
Some reports from Saigon 
suggested that 20,000 tons 
of munitions?the equivalent 
of the atomic bomb used on 
Hiroshima ? had been 
dropped in the first two days., 
United States officials said 
That some targets in the.? 
Hanoi and Haiphong regions 
were attacked for the first 
time. The official North Viet-
namese press agency report-
ed attacks on the Gia Lam 
area, where the Honoi air-
port is situated. 
The Defense Department 
insisted that civilian areas 
were not on the target list, 
t 
included "such categories as 
rail yards, shipyards, coin, 
mand and control facilities, 
warehouse and transshipment 
areas, communications facili-
ties, vehicle-repair facilities,,. 
power plants, railway bridges, 
railroad rolling stock, truck ' 
parks, MIG bases, air-de-
fense radars, and pm and 
? missile sites." 
Tess, the official Soviet 
press agency, reported, how-
ever, that the American raids 
had caused "heavy civilian 
casualties" and had detitrOyed 
'thousands of hoiilds." Tho

The Hanoi rad, asserted 
that thousands were killed 
and wounded from Dec. .18 
to 24. 
The Justification 
The objectives to be gained 
from bombing North Vietnam 
have varied over the course 
of the war. As a staff study 
for the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee noted ear-
lier this year, there have 
been five principal objec-
tives: 
9To reduce the movement 
of men and supplies into 
South Vietnam. 
9To make North Vietnam 
, pay a high cost for support-
ing the war in the South. 
9To break the will of North 
Vietnam. 
To force the North Viet-
namese to make concessions 
in the peace negotiations. 
41To strengthen morale in, 
? South Vietnam and the Unit-
ed States. 
As public justification for 
the action, the Government 
nas generally given military 
reasons?the first two listed 
above. However, officials of 
both the Johnson and Nixon 
Administrations have ac-
knowledged privately that 
diplomatic and political con-
siderations were as import-
ant as, if not more important 
than, the military oncs. 
Explanations of the current 
campaign fit this pattern. The 
official spokesmen in Wash-
ington -- Ronald L. Ziegler 
at the White House and Mr. 
Friedhelm at the Pentagon ? 
? have maintained that this 
phase is a military necessity. 
Official spokesmen in Saigon 
. have also made that point. 
In individual interviews, how-
ever, top Government. and . 
military officials as well as 
lower-ranking analysts have 
acknowledged that the basic 
reasons are diplomatic and 
political. 
Mr. Ziegler has not deviat-
ed from his statement on Dec. 
IS that "we are not going 
to allow the peace talks to 
be used as a cover for an-
other offensive." There was 
grave danger of such an of-
fensive, he maintained, add-
ing that "the President will 
continue to order any action 
he deems necessary by air 
or by sea to prevent any 
build-up he sees in the 
South.", 
At the .same time top Ad-
ministration officials de-
clared that the resumption of 
heavy bombing was primarily 
a result of Hanoi's lack of 
? seriousness at the Paris ne-
gotiations. 
One official said that the 
bombing served the purpose 
of showing American anger 
at what Mr. Nixon regarded 
as Hanoi's delaying tactics. 
Knowledgeable sources here' 
believe that, by intensifying 
the bombing, President Nixon, 
hoped to show Hanoi that he 
could take the political heat 
at home and abroad. He was 
also trying to indicate, they 
believe, that he was willing 
to discard any past restric-
tions on targets. Some ex-
perts said that by using 
B-52's, Mr. Nixon was im-
plicitly threatening antiper-
sonnel bombing as well. 
Administration officials are 
willing to concede that the 
American bombing of Indo-
china has not always been 
effective. But that, they said, 
was because of the restric-
tions set by the Johnson Ad-
ministration. 
Administration officials are 
convinced that the heavy 
bombing of last spring?to-
gether with the President's 
trips to Moscow and Peking 
?led directly to the more 
productive negotiations in 
the fall. 
On the one hand, accord-
ing to this argument, Hanoi 
feared a lack of support from 
its chief allies and, on the 
other, it was being badly 
hurt. Those factors almost 
produced a, peace agreement 
in October, the officials be-
lieve. 
By fall American bombs 
had knocked out about 70 
per cent of North Vietnam's 
power-generating facilities 
and the major bridges on the 
rail lines from China. Those 
facilities were being rebuilt 
in recent weeks, according 
to military intelligence, and 
the United States hopes to 
destroy them again. 
The Opposition. 
Since the outset of the 
bombing eight years ago, the 
strategy has engendered stiff 
? --
.opposition. Many opponents 
have argued that it is a futile 
' tactic that it has not and 
will -never accomplish either 
its political or its military 
? objectives. Others have ar-
gued that, 'regardless of ef-
fect ix;eness, it. is immoral to 
wreak devastation on a small 
country. 
An early as 1967 a group 
of leading Government-
oriented scientists, under the 
auspices of the Institute for 
Defense Analyses, concluded 
that "the U. S. bombing of 
.North Vietnam has had ?no 
measurable effect on Hanoi's 
ability to mount and support 
military operations in the 
South." 
As to the question whether 
the bombing.could break the 
will of the Vietnamese peo-
ple, the study declared: 
"The expectation that bomb-
ing would erode the deter-
mination of Hanoi and its 
people clearly overestimated 
the persuasive and disruptive 
effects of the bombing and, 
correspondingly, undcrest 
male the tenacity and recu-
perative capabilities of the 
North Vietnamese." 
The study went on to cite 
"the fact well-documented in 
the historical and social 
scientific literature that a di-
rect frontal attack on a so-
ciety tends to strengthen the 
social fabric" and "to im-
prove /he determination of 
both the leadership and the 
populace to fight back." 
In the Johnson Administra-
tion, proposals to bomb the 
Hanoi and Haiphong areas 
were repeatedly rejected. The 
Pentagon papers make clear 
that the principal reason was 
the expectation of heavy civ-
ilian casualties. 
The critics of the bomb-
ing contend that it is pre-
nosterous for the Govern-
ment to assert that only mili-
tary targets are scheduled 
when vast tonnages are being 
dropped from great heights 
on extensive areas. 
? A leading Congressional op-
ponent of the bombing, Sen-
ator Mike Mansfield of Mon-
tana, the Democratic leader, 
declared at a news confer-
ence Wednesday: 
'The bombing tactic is 
eight years old. It has not 
produced results in the past. 
It will not lead to a rational, 
peaceful settlement now. It 
is the 'Stone Age' strategy 
being used in a war almost 
unanimously recognized in 
this nation as a 'mistaken' 
one. It is a raw power play 
with human lives, American 
and others, and, as such, it 
is abhorrent." 
Senator Harold E. Hughes, 
Democrat of Iowa, said in an 
interview that the bombing 
was futile and immoral. 
"It is unbelievable savagery 
that we have unleashed in 
this holy season," he de-
clared. "The only thing I can 
compare it with is the sav-
agery at Hiroshima and Nag-
asaki." 
52 
Asked whether he would 
approve of the bombing if 
it could be proved effective 
in bringing concessions from 
Hanoi, the Senator said: 
"I cannot imagine the holo-
caust that the bombing must 
be causing. There can be 
no victory in this kind of 
war." 
The critics of the bombing 
argue, furthermore, that 
American airmen are being 
killed and made prisoner and 
that the lives of priconers en-
dangered. . 
The staff study for the Sen- ? 
ate committee concluded 
that "throughout the war, 
the results of the bombing of 
North Vietnam have con-
sistently fallen far short of 
the claims made for it." 
"Compared to the damage 
to U.S. prestige and the in-
ternal division created by the 
bombing policy, its meager 
gains must be seriously 
questioned," the study 
asserted.

Comment 
PARIS?There was a time not very 
long ago when one Guernica, while 
not actually provoking an offensive 
against barbarity, caused nausea in 
the West when the West discovered 
it was capable of the worst against 
mankind. It was already a caso of air-
planes massacring a civilian popula-
tion, a case of airplanes dispatched 
by a foreign power to support dic-
tatorship. 
? Since then, perversion has made 
headway. Today it has reached a new 
high in a North Vietnam covered with 
"big cemeteries under the moonlight." 
A hundred B-52's and hundreds of 
fighter-bombers unleashed night and 
day on the network of tightly knit' 
webs of Delta villages?it is hard to 
Imagine what this represents in terror, 
In blind murders, In atrocious physical 
and psychological Mutilations. 
? The fact that the center of Hanoi 
has not been?or not yet been?anni-
hilated is not reassuring: the heart of 
the capital which has long been evacu-
ated has less population left than the 
immediate suburbs and the country-
side, which is swarming with peasants, 
and also with children, with old peo-
ple, with the inactive population from 
the cities dispersed among straw huts. 
To cover this dense crowd of civil-
fans with a carpet of bombs is perhaps 
not to exterminate a people, but it is 
to undertake a succession of localized 
exterminations. It is to put to sword 
and fire the houses and the huts, the 
hospitals, the schools, the shops and 
the cooperatives.

The American leadership believes 
that the era of contempt which they 
have entered without troubled con-
science will be succeeded by the era 
of surrender or their adversaries. But 
the latter have toughness of mind be-
cause they have the intelligence which 
grows from pride. These people who 
call the Americans "the Huns of the 
Twentieth Century" have just pub-
lished, in French, a very polished an-
thology of their most ancient poems. 
But Mr. Nixon, on the other hand, 
is right: he, is right in believing that 
hospital, hut and rice field must be 
destroyed, because it is from there as 
much as from military command posts 
that the resistance draws its ideals 
and its men. Mr. Nixon is translating 
this reality into his own language as 
"Communist offensive." 
If he dared go to the very end of 
his logic, he should now bomb Saigon. 
A priest there has just let it be known 
that for the past ten days hundreds or 
prisoners have gone on &hunger strike 
at the capital's Chi Hoe prison. They 
Are "politicals," picked up in the street 
by General Thieies policemen or jailed 
because they are wrong-thinking Cath-
olic or students disgusted with the dic-
tatorship. They have dared ask for the 
freedom of their. people and for the 
end of the massacres. 
Perpetually in search of victory, Mr. 
Nixon is thus led to give harder and 
harder blows everywhere because his 
enemies are everywhere. In the view 
of many he still is given the benefit 
of tentative explanations or of justifi-
cations, because he has been re-elected 
and because the United States is not a 
totalitarian country. But may one not 
question 'one's self about the exact' 
value of those liberal mechanisms 
which have been bypassed, betrayed 
as they have been by the logic of an 
imperial system and deviated from 
their original meaning to permit such 
abomination, the crushing of a small 
country that could well have been 
spared promotion to the rank of martyr?

TO See If They Trust Him 
REPORTS of a 'Nixon-Kissinger rift 
have upset the White House; which has 
denied, them, publicly. ? PrivatelY, 
sources inside the Nixon administra-
tion have \said that they are worried 
about "damage to Kissinger's eredibil-
ity" as a negotiator. "A prime point of 
concern," according to The Washington 
Post's Murrey Mercier, "is said to be 
what the North Vietnamese may con-
clude from these reports.". . ? e. - 
But the damage to Kissinger'.S credi-
bility could be far greater than that. It 
could extend to his dealings With the 
Russians and the Chinese and tie Mr.' 
Nixon's own grand design* for an "era 
of negotiation '-and for the "generation ? 
of peace!' that was to crown his second 
term. . ? . . ? 
The Kremlin as Well as. Pellinghave 
been watching Mr.. Nixon's negotiating 
strategy in order to determine how. far ? 
they could trust him. :If they decide 
that he has gone back on his own word 
in the Paris talks, or on Kissinger's, . 
they will be less likely to enter into 
agreements with the United. ?States 
which might expose. them to similar 
risks. 
THIS COLUMN has sometimes tried 
to analyze the administration's foreign - 
policy from the 'standpoint. of its for-
eign adversaries, in the belief that a 
better understanding of both sides' at-
titudes may be acquired thereby., 
When the Paris impasse Is viewed 
from this angle,, there is no doubt that 
powerful elements in all the Commu-
nist capitals are 'now' claiming it AS 
proof of groSs .deception by the White 
House. The hawks 'in Moscow and Pe-
rking were . only narrowly defeated in 
the infighting that preceded Mr.' 
Nixon's summit visits. But defeats in 
Communist power struggles are never 
as conclusive as they seem. 
The hawks argued, to judge from the 
evidence between the lines of the Com-
munist press, that Mr. Nixon was not 
to he trusted?not just on Vietnam, 
but on all the other issues which, to 
them, involve the very survival of the , 
Communist system. The doves, on the 
other hand, maintained that the Com-
munist concessions on strategic arms 
limitation, on trade and aid, on politi-
cal issues, were paid for by' American 
concessions as well as by promises of ? 
future benefits. But now the. hawks 
, would claim that Soviet and Chinese

can promises reneged upon ? !whenever- '

cerned at the.dasnage done to ?KisSin-

gested was that an attempt to look at

of Hanoi would lead the ,Communists 
to conclude that the agreement negoti-,,

by Mr. Nixon. The fuss noW made by.''

of such an analysis on Kissinger's cred-

THE DAMAGE, whieh is ',of the ad-,

Terror Borabinoo- in the Name of Peace 
-How did we get in a few short weeks from a prospect 
for peace that "you can bank on," in the Presidents 
werds, to the most, savage and senseless act of war ever-
-,visited, over a scant 10 days, by one sovereign people 
"'upon another? And perhaps more to the point, what is 
:the 'logic and where are the lessons of history. that 'say 
can run?this reel backwardafter a time and proceed 
:.from terror bombing to "peace"?that there Is, in other 
words, some rational cause and effect here, running ei-
ther way? 
The sad, hard answer is that while there are few con 
*-
elusive lessons from history in this matter, the supposed 
"logic" of proceeding from bargaining to bombing rind 
hnek to bargaining, in tinN name or peace, has been fun-
dainenial to tills Vliquani stran-ey or "limited. 
,wsr" hy "graduated response" over more than .eight 
years and two administrations. In the beginning, it was 
accepted, with precious little protest, by Democrats and 
'llepublicans'alike; and it was quietly acquie'sced in by a 
gOod many of the people who now talk of "genocide" and 
"war crimes" and of the intolerable "immorality" of our 
:current policy. 
That we recite this background is hr no Way to sug-
gest that we think :Mr. Nixon is somehow mandated to. 
continue to compound past follies. On. the contrary, hav-
ing 'promised us so many times to -end this war within 
'his first four years and having failed so dismally,, for all 
,that he might have learned from recent history, he is 
Under greater obligation than any of his predecessors. 
were to re-evaluate the mission, to reassess our capabili-
ties; to recognize our limitations?and to change our 
strategy. But the change that is needed is not likely to 
be encouraged by denouncing the horror now unfolding. 
In the skies over North Vietnam as something entirely 
new and different and essentially Nixonlan. If this strat-
egy is contrary to all we hold sacred, it would seem to 
follow that in some measure it always was. In short, we 
are not going to find it easy to work our way out of a 
10-year-old war effort that has demonstrably failed of 
its early high hopes unless we are prepared to begin by 
admitting that this is so; that we are all caught up,. 
in one degree or another, with the responsibility for a. 
war plan gone horribly wrong; that this country under-
took an enterprise it could. not .handle, at least In any 
tithe frame and at any expenditure oflives-and resources 
worthy of the objective; and that it would be the mark 
of a big power to cut our losses and settle for the only 
reasonable outcome that we now must know could ever-
have been realistically expected. 
We should begin, in other words, not simply by shout-
ing about the immorality of what we are now doing, but 
by first acknowledging the tragic impracticality of what 
.we set out to do, and the enormity of the 'miscalculations 
and misjudgments that have been made, however hon-
,eStly, from the very start. For only from this admission 
can 'we proceed rationally to deal with the monumental 
contradiction in the administration's current strategy. 
The contradiction begins with the adininistration's seem-
ing,insistence on a fully-enforceable, guaranteed settle-
ment of the war on the old, familiar, original terms?
"freedom" and "independence" and "enduring peace" 
for 'South Vietnam; anything seriously short of that, 
Mr. Nixon would have us believe, would be abject sur-
render, the abandonment of an ally, and a "stain upon 
the honor' .of the- United States. 
Leaving aside the cliches which have conic to be so 
inevitable a part of every serious presentation of our 
policy, there are two things t.ragically wrong about this 
statement of our aims, and the first is that such objec-
tives are demonstrably unobtainable. The violent and 
embittered conflict that has engulfed Indochina for sev-
eral decades Is not going to hn "settled" by any pier(' of 
paper that Dr. Henry Kissinger (-mild conceivably OW-
mulct() both North and initIu Vietnam to sign. That. Is 
the loud lesson of the collapse of the last peace plan; it 
asked too much of a situation which can only be resolved 
in ambiguity. Such is the conflict of purpose on both 
sides, in fact, that it can fairly be said that in negotiat-
ing a "settlement" we are in fact merely writing the 
rules of engagement for a continuing struggle for control 
of South Vietnam by other less openly military means. 
So we are not talking about "peace," and still less 
about "abandoning art ally," for there can be no resolu-
tion of the fighting which will not present each side both 
with risks and with opportunities of losing?or winning 
?in large measure what each has been fighting for. To 
pretend that we are doing otherwise?that we are mak-
ing "enduring peace" by carpet-bombing our way across 
downtown Hamel with 52s?is to practice yet one more 
cruel deception upon an American public already cruelly 
deceived. It is, in brief, to compound what is perhaps the 
real immorality of this administration's policy?the con-
tinuing readiness to dissemble; to talk of "military tar-
gets" when what we are hitting 'are residential centers 
and hospitals and commercial airports; to speak of our 
dedication to the return of our POWs and our missing 
in action even while we add more than 70 to their num-
ber in little more than a week. 
We think the American people could face the truth'of 
how little there is we can really count on accomplishing 
in Vietnam?if they were to hear it from the President. 
But we have not heard from the President?not since 
"peace was at hand." Instead, we have heard from sur-
rogates and spokesmen and military headquarters, cryp-
tically; about the loss of men and aircraft and the al-
leged military significance of the raids. It is from others, 
around the world, that we hear about the havoc our 
bombers are wreaking on innocent civilians with the' 
heaviest aerial onslaught of this or any other war. All 
this we are presumably doing to redeem the "honor of 
America" and this is the second part of what's wrong 
?
and contradictory?about the President's bombing pol-
icy. For it is hard to envisage any settlement that we 
could realistically hope to negotiate which could justify 
the effort now being expended to achieve it or wash 
away the stains on this country's honor of the past 10 
days.

U.S. bombs, chemicals and 
other advance weapons on the 
land and people of Vietnam. 
In another "emergency" res-
olution, the large scientific or-
ganization's legislative council 
overwhelmingly condemned 
U.S. actions in Vietnam, and 
urged immediate withdrawal 
of all U.S. forces from Viet-
nam, Laos and Cambodia. 
It was the first time antiwar 
forces have been able to get 
such a resolution through the 
largely middle-of-the-road 
group, a federation of 300 sci-
entific bodies who have a total 
of 7 million members. 
By an amendment offered 
by Lewis M. Branscomb, re-
search director of IBM, the 
group deleted clauses oppos-
ing U.S. military participation 
in Thailand. "We're there by 
treaty, and I'm not sure that 
the situation parallels" that in 
the other countries'said Brans-
comb, who until recently 
headed the National Bureau of 
Standards. He favored the re-
mainder of the resolution. 
The study of Vietnamese 
war damage was urged in a 
resolution stating that both 
scientists and the public de-
serve a full assessment of all 
that "American science" has 
done in Vietnam, "construc-
tive as well as destructi've." 
"We have done some con-
structive forestry, built high-
ways and some hospitals and 
medical care," said Professor 
E. W. Pfeiffer of the Univer-
sity of Montana, one of the ac-
tion's sponsors. "But the dam-
we've done far outweighs 
Giese." 
Dr. Leonard Rieser, vice 
cpreFident of Dartmouth Col-
Qs' T 
2.1.) LTUICL 
lege and AAAS presiden 
starting in January, said, "We 
need a body like the U.S 
Atomic Bomb Casualty Com 
mission, which studied the 
long-range effects of the Hiro 
shima and Nagasaki bombings 
after World War II. 
"Unless Congress sets up 
such a study, we'll never 
know" the truth about many 
allegations?for example the 
charge that U.S. chemicals 
have begun to cause genetic 
mutations and consequent 
malformations in Vietnamese 
children, he said. 
Also, he said, such a study is 
vital if the United States is to 
help rehabilitate Vietnam in-
telligently?a goal that Presi-
dent Nixon has endorsed, ac-
cording to reports of .U.S.-
North Vietnamese peace talks. 
Specifically, the AAS coun-
cil backed a bill proposed by 
Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D-Wis.) 
and Rep. Gilbert Gude (R-Md.) 
calling on President Nixon to 
ask the National Academy of 
Sciences to determine both 
the war's ecological effects 
and "effective ways and 
means of rectifying" them. 
It called for assessment of 
the results of "aerial bombing, 
including so-called carpte 
bombing," of wide use of "CS" 
gas and of bulldozing large 
areas of land with "Rome 
plows," a defoliation method 
sometimes called more de-
structive than chemicals. 
Every government depart-
ment would have to give the 
science academy any informa-
tion it said it needed, accord-
ing to the Nelson-Gude bill, 
and there would have to be a 
"final" report within six 
months. 
But AAAS proponents of a 
Vietnam study envision this 
first report as only a start on 
the kind of long-range obser-
vations that the federally fi-
nanced Atomic Bomb Casualty 
rco-ed. 
Commission has made in Ja-
pan, observing cancers and 
other delayed results of the A-
bombs. 
The AAAS council has some 
550 members, but only 175 
were present yesterday. The 
vote on the anti-Vietnam war 
resolution was 80 to 41, with 
many abstentions. These in-
cluded those of the presiding 
officers, including Dr. Glenn 
T. Seaborg, until recently At-
omic Energy Commission 
chairman. 
? The council also voted to 
pare down its size to make it 
less unwieldy, and to give ma-
jor power to the NNNS's some, 
150,000 direct dues-paying 
Members, rather than to the 
federated organizations. These 
groups will still be repre 
sented through broad sections 
representing scientific disci-
plines such as physics and 
chemistry. 
Despite a plea from Dr. Gar-
land Allan of Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis, the coun-
cil 'refused to assure future 
space to the anti-establish-
ment Scientists and Engineers 
for Social and Political Action. 
Eight SESPA members were 
arresttd Wednesday after ref-
using to take down an unau-
thorized exhibit table. 
But the table stood yester-
day in a new area provided by 
the AAAS, and some AAAS 
leaders indicated that they 
will be willing to provide such 
space again rather than face 
disorders and arrests. SESPA 
members said they intend to 
continut "orderly protest" 
against uses of science for war 
and oppression, and will reap-' 
pear at future AAAS sessions. 
The organization ended its 
annual meeting here. It will 
reconvene in Mexico City in 
late June for a largely inter-
American session.

Paris (Reuter)?The Rev. 
Daniel J. Berrigan yesterday 
informed the North Vietnam-
ese delegation to the Paris 
peace talks that $250,000 had 
been raised in the United 
States to help reconstruct Bach 
Mai Hospital, hit during the 
recent United States bombing 
of Hanoi. 
The money was raised by 
the U.S. Medical Aid Commit-

day that France would set 
aside $400,000 this year to mod-

Father Berrigan, on parole 
after serving a prison term for 
helping to burn draft files in 
Catonsville, said he also told 
the Hanoi emissaries he would 
continue to oppose the war. 
Father Berrigan told a group

The Saigon government has lost. estabi.-? -
lished a new politicill party here, but many of 
- its member&-are nolquite sure? what it:is-all_ 
about. 
, "We were told to go to i. meeting at the 
OoVince capital," said alarrner Who claimed 
to be a member of the.new,,Democracy Patty 
"We shouted some slogans-, and then they let 
us go home." , ? ? 
The farmer didn't.seem to.'fmnd the slogan-
shouting too much. But he was-at-a loss to 
explain What its-purpose-was; 
, Democracy Party organizers say the-panty. 
is intended ta lead a "political" struggle' 
against the --Communists once there is a-
Cease-fire.. They claim to have already 
recruited some 2-00,000 'Members. A' national 
'party convention. is to be- held 
in mi-d-
February. 
Organizers- in Go Cong. Province to the 
south of.Saigon-claim to have brought in more 
than 10,000 recruits: Go Cong-is the party's 
pilot province for the-Mekong-Delta. 
In some, of the province'& hamlets, it' 
appears_ that just about-every male 'over:the 
age of 18. was expected: by government 
authorities to? join the new party., Many 
appear to regard joining-as sirnply-one_mere 
way of. staying on- the right. Ode of the 
government. Some apparently fear that if 
they do not join, they will,have trouble getting 
official licenses, residence permits, And other 
legal papers from the-government.. 
A mason in the province capital explained 
how he came to join the party. 
"Some government cadres. came around 
and asked me to fill out application forms," 
he said. "So I filled them out." 
"Everybody has to join," he. said. "It's by 
order of the government. If you -don't join, 
you might have trouble with the govern-
ment." 
In one hamlet, each house was flying not 
only the government flag but. also the new 
party flag, which consists of a red star on-a 
yellow backround. 
Hamlet residents said they were ordered 
by local authorities to buy the party flag, 
which cost 200 piasters (about 50 cents) each. 
Party leaders said the flag is supposed to 
demonstrate the "anti-Communist spirit." 
"The North Vietnarne.se flag has a red 
background with a yellow star," said one of 
the party's leaders. "So we chose the opposite 
? a yellow background with a red.star." 
Party leaders insist that they want to co-
exist peacefully with other anti-Communist 
parties, and that they want to encourage the 
development of a two-party system. But the

There were reports this week 
that American pressure on North 
Vietnamese negotiators for some 
:sort of agreement on the with-
' drawn' of North Vietnamese fight-
ers from the South contributed to 
the- impasse which first developed 
in Paris. North Vietnam does not 
admit to any of its regular troops 
being in the South. The reports 
implied that Hanoi would make 
a, concessional gesture provided 
the U.S. ' agreed to get prisoners 
In South Vietnam released.

was that Hanoi would withdraw 
Its own men from the South if 
"communist sympathisers" now 
kept in prison in the South are 
freed so- that the latter- can play 
a crucial role in the post-cease??

State Department Urges End 
Of Pentagon Role in Pacification 
By TAD SZULC 
Special to The New York'Thneo 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23?The 
State Department has recom-
mended the virtual elimination 
of the Defense Department's 
role in pacification efforts in 
South Vietnam. 
The proposal, according to 
officials here, is ,aimed at es-
tablishing civilian control over 
major United States social and 
economic programs. The long-
dominant military role in run-
ning purely civilian and hu-
manitarian programs has been 
the target of frequent criticism 
within the Administration and 
in Congress. The Pentagon and 
the intelligence agencies have 
been Acersrni of often distort-
ing the plograms Mto opora-
tions with military objectives. 
' The change would be ac-
complished, the State Depart-
ment said, through a transfer 
to the civilian Administration 
for International Development 
of the program to assist war 
victims in South Vietnam. 
The bulk of this program is 
currently managed by the 
War Victims Directorate of an 
agency under the Pentagon's 
control known as CORDS; for 
Civilian Operations Rural De-
velopment Support. Heretofore, 
this agency, whose chief is 
directly subordinate to the 
United States military com-
mand in Saigon, has been res-
ponsible for most of the paci-
fication efforts. 
Parallel to the Vietnamiza-
tion program, which gradually 
switched combat responsibili-
ties from American to South 
Vietnamese forces, pacification 
was dimed at securing the Sai-
gon Government's hold over 
rural populations through oper-
ations ranging from care of re-
fugees and resettlement to the 
training of the Vietnamese na-
tional police and the joint anti-
Vietcong program known as 
Operation Phoenix. The war 
v;ctims' program, however, is 
currently the major operation 
of CORDS, as most of the other 
pacification ventures have col-
lapsed since the start of the 
North Vietnamese offensive in 
the South last March 30. 
Based on Inspection Tour 
The State Department said 
that long-range rehabilitation 
programs 'are more compatible 
with the development aims of 
A.I.D. than with CORDS, which 
Is a sport-term agency." 
The recommendation to trans-
fer the refugee program to ci-
vilian control was contained in 
an internal departmental docu-
ment sent on Dec. 6 by An-
thony Faunce, the acting in-
spector general of foreign as-
sistance, to John A. Hannah, 
; the aid administrator. The doc-
ument is based on a lengthy 
report by a team of foreign as-
sistance inspectors who visited 
Vietnam during the fall. 
Mr. Faunce is a senior State 
Department official who is di-
rectly responsible to Secretary. 
of State William P. Rogers. His 
office supervises all United 
States aid programs, which Mr. 
Hannah administers. 
Administration officials said 
that the National Security 
Council would make the final 
decision to recommend the 
transfer of the program. 
The 33-page report which 
concentrated almost entirely on 
the refugees in South Vietnam, 
said: The United States should 
support long-term physical and 
economic rehabilitation of war, 
victims, including displaced 
persons, war widows, orphans 
and the physically and mentally 
handicapped." 
"It will simply not be enough 
to help rebuild the Vietnamese 
economy," the report added. 
"This alone is not sufficient to 
restore the social fabric." 
South Vietnamese Criticized 
The report was highly critical 
of the performance of South 
Vietnamese officials running 
the refugee programs in con-
junction with the United States, 
urging the removal of "corrupt 
administrators" and charging 
South Vietnamese "sloppiness 
in administration." 
The inspectors accused some 
South Vietnamese officials of 
the Social Welfare Ministry of 
falsifying name lists of refugees 
to steal commodities. 
The inspectors said that on 
the basis of a count by the Sai-
gon Government 1.2 million new 
refugees had been created by 
the fighting in South Vietnam 
between March 30 and Nov. 23. 
The number of refugees is not 
precisely known but the report 
said that last June the United 
States and South Vietnam were 
preparing plans to care for 1.5 
million refugees. According to 
the Senate subcommittee on 
refugees the total may be close 
to two million, including some 
200,000 living in areas under 
Communist control. 
, The inspectors said they 
found that since March 30, 
when responsibility for relief 
resettlement and return-to-vil-
lage programs was between 
CORDS and AID, that opera-
tions were characterized by 
"confusion and lack of coordi-
nation." 
"This lack of coordination 
and duplication of effort be-
tween AID and CORDS, which 
is an old story, must be cor-
rected as soon as possible," the 
report said. "We believe that in 
any case the war victims pro-
gram could probably be more 
efficiently administered and 
that its long-range responsibil-
ities would be better protected 
if the War Victims Directorate 
were transferred now to AID."

Cambodian Confession 
As the aerial blitz against North Vietnam continues 
In full fury, the American people have been treated to 
another sordid glimpse of what they are getting for the 
continuing high investment in lives, money and national 
honor throughout Indochina. 
The United States-backed Government of Cambodiahas 
acknowledged that because of corruption by military.. 
commanders and other "irregularities," it has paid cial-
aries to as many as 100,000 nonexistent soldiers. he 
misappropriated funds for this phantom army have.cpme 
almost exclusively from a $300-million American aid 
program that President Nixon once called "probably the . 
best investment in foreign assistance that the United 
States has made in my lifetime." 
The President to the contrary notwithstanding, there 
Is nothing remarkably new in the latest .disclosure from 
Phnom Penh, except perhaps the surprising candor of 
a regime that has long shared with its neighbors in 
Vientiane and Saigon a reputation for corr.,3tion, 
Only last month, a Times correspondent on the scene. 
described Cambodia as a place where "the sons of gen-
erals drive Alfa Romeos and Cougar fastbacks . . . the , 
governor of a province is known to sell ammunition and , 
drugs to the enemy . . . other Government officials can 
be seen selling automatic rifles and uniforms to wealthy 
merchants, who in turn sell them to both sides .. . low-
salaried colonels?some accused of pocketing the pay-
rolls of their units?build luxury villas here in tie 
capital and rent them to Americans for $700 a month." 
Is it any wonder that since Mr. Nixon threw American 
support?including briefly? American troops?behind 
a new anti-Communist military regime in early 1970, 
Communist forces have overrun three-quarters of Cam-
bodian soil and ,the indigenous resistance movement has 
expanded from a force of about 3,000 to an estimated 
30,000? 
Meanwhile, most of the country's towns and cities 
have been heavily damaged or destroyed either by allied 
?bombs or by Communist shells, or both, and up to one-
third of the seven million population has been rendered 
homeless. Neither the newly affluent generals nor the 
American Government has shown 'serious concern for 
these hapless refugees, caught up in a conflict that is 
beyond their understanding. 
And all this goes on while the Administration weighs 
plans for an eighteen -month freeze of Federal housing ? 
construction and other "economy" cuts in programs to 
aid America's own disadvantaged. Some day perhaps the 
President will explain who at home or abroad is being 
helped by the extension of this war without end.

Thieu TLJsin 
To uild His Panv 
Jr 
y Thomas W. Lippman 
Washington Post Foreign Service 
GOCONG, South Vietnam, 
Dec. 31?President Thieu is 
openly using soldiers, civil 
servants, and publicly owned 
equipment, including materi-
als paid for by the United 
States, to promote the devel-
opment of his new political 
party. 
The party, known as Dan 
Chu or the Democracy Party, 
Is theoretically an independ-
ent organization with volun-
tary membership and no for-
mal connections with the pres-
ident. But it represents a ma-
jor part of his effort to soli-
dify his personal grip on the 
country and its people in an-
ticipation of a postwar politi-
cal struggle. 
, The party's organizers 
have been at work for more 
than a year, but stepped up 
the pace sharply in late Octo-
ber, when a peace settlement 
that would legitimize a Com-
munist presence in South Vi-
etnam became a real possibil-
ity. 
Thieu has used the delay in 
reaching a peace agreement to I 
move on several levels to en-
trench himself in office. The 
chief public and ostensibly 
non-governmental move has 
, been the unveiling of the 
party, which has opened chap-
ters around the country 
though it has largely avoided 
scrutiny from foreigners by 
postponing its debut in Sai-
gon. 
. The chapter here in Gocong, I 
a sleepy delta province capital 
30 miles south of Saigon, is 
one of the most fully organ-
ized, and no attempt is being 
Made to hide the extensive 
use of public resources and 
government personnel in its 
development. 
The staff at the party's tem- I 
porary office in a. Buddhist I 
temple consists of four civil 
servants three young men 
from province headquarters 
assigned by the province chief 
to work at, the party office, 
and a ?voinon front the 
Agricultural Development !W-
renn. Printing and typing of 
party documents and letters 
are done in government of 
flees on government equip-
ment. .? 
The Party's permanent Go-
cong headquarters is being 
constructed a few blocks away 
by a platoon of army engi-
neers, using American-sup-
plied equipment and imported 
Korean cement paid for by 
U.S. aid funds. The site is pub-
licly owned land next to pro-
vince police headquarters. 
There are 2,673 names on 
the party's current Gocong 
province membership list. 
Among them are 459 police 
men and 1,134 teachers, agr 
cultural development officials 
and other civil servants. Ac 
cording to party ehairma 
Nguyen Minh-Huan, the roste_ 
comprises all public employ 
ees in the province. 
In addition, Huan said a le 
gal ban on partisan politics by 
military officers has been 
partly circumvented with gov-
ernment approval to permit 
officers assigned to non-mill 
tary duties to join the party. 
He called them "civilian offi-
cers." 
He said there are about 50 
such officers in Gocong, a mi-
nor and generally peaceful 
province where the govern-
ment's military presence is 
minimal. There are several 
thousand of them around the 
country, according to other 
sources. 
Huan said he was one of 
about 30 persons recruited for 
;the party by the Gocong pro-
vince chief and that the appli-
cation forms filled out by all 
Ithe members were being kept,

Last, week, however,Thieu

Thieu in an even stronger pos-

"We just want to be left alone

largely subsided.

the other countires of indo-
China. For even if a cease-
fire were to extend to Cam-
bodia it is difficult to see 
what kind of political follow-
up there could possibly be. 
The mood of pessimism 
deepened with recent Com-
munist military successes. 
For a time the. Communists 
had closed four of the coun-
try's six main railroads and 
were threatening the other 
two. They crowned their 
teniporary dominance with 
the destruction of a heavily 
escorted convoy and conse-
quent butchery of the gov-
ernment troops and a num-
ber of women and children, 
the soldiers' dependents. 
President Lon Nol has 
given his new prime minis-
ter, Hang Thun Hak, a brief 
to arrange talks with the 
other side at the local level. 
Officially all that is on offer 
is service in the govern-
ment, army or re-settlement 
?on the land. According to 
rumor, there may also have 
been some vague sugges-
Lons of a "place in political 
life," 
The official government 
line has always been that if 
the North Vietnamese with-
drew. Khmers?as the Cam-
'b odians are historically 
known?would soon settle 
their differences amicably. 
Since it is unlikely that all 
Vietnamese will withdraw 
and since it is reluctant-
ly conceded that there ID 
such a thing as a dedicated 
Khmer Communist, the ac-
tual government strategy is 
to try to make little local 
settlements with the less 
committed Khmer dissi-
dents. 
It is recognized that a

eminent view suggest that 
"over time" the Cambodian 
army will be able to get the 
better of these units. ? 
The government's plan is 
thus essentially to bring 
about the capitulation . of 
some hostile units and. to de-
stroy the others, a plan for 
continuing the war rather 
than ending it. It is based 
on the hope that the major-
ity of Nmtil Viol IlaltleSe 
units, advisers and support 
per.soimel will indeed de-
part, or at least, even if they 
stay on Cambodian terri-
tory, will cease to intervene 
in a major way in the Cam-
hod i a n war. 
It ignores the signs over 
recent months that the 
Khmer dissidents are in-
creasing in number, now to 
an ? estmiated 30,000-35,000, 
and in combat effectiveness 
while the Cambodian army 
.doesn't seem to be getting 
significantly better. It ig-
nores, too, the possibility 
that there may soon be a 
major reduction in Ameri-
can supplies of arms and 
equipment, even if the 
United States provides 
straight cash for arms pur-
chases to circumvent any re-
striction in a cease-fire 
agreement on direct supply. 
One Khmer opposition 
party member commented: 
"Lon Nol isn't interested in 
any settlement. He tells 
Hang Thun Hak to get some 
talks going hut he wohl let 
him offer anything that the 
other side would accept." 
Other critics of Lou Nol 
who take the same view 
would like to see him re-
placed, somehow, by a more 
honest and less lackadaisical 
government. 
What would the other side 
accept.? The answer seems to 
be that, like the Phnom 
Penh government, it too is 
opposed to a settlement. 
Exiled Prince Norodom Si-

One-Third of Army 
In Cambodia Found. 
To Be Nonexistent 
By SYDNEY H. SCHANBERG 
SoeciAl In Sc 1rw York !Ours 
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, 
Dec. 27?The Cambodian Gov-
ernment acknowledged today 
that, because of corruption by 
military commanders and other 
"irregularities," it has "at 
times" paid salaries to as many 
as 100,000 nonexistent soldiers. 
The Government said that it 
had sometimes met payrolls of 
300;000 troops even though it 
has now found that the actual 
number of Men in the army is 
about 200,000. These "phan-
tom" troops?a creation of 
false payrolls submitted by 
unit commanders ? represent 
the most widespread form of 
corruption in Cambodia and 
have become the focus of bit-
ter popular complaint. 
A private in the Cambodian 
Army receives about $20 a 
'month, so 100,000 "phantom" 
privates would put $2-million a 
month into the pockets of com-
manders. Virtually all of this 
'money comes through United 
States aid, which will total 
about 5300-million this year. 
The information about Cam-
bodia's inflated army was dis-
closed by the Information Min-
ister, Keam Relit, at a news 
!cenference. 
The Government has men-
" 
tioned the problem of corrup-
tion in general terms before, 
but has never discussed it with 
-such candor and in such detail. 
The Information Minister said 
the Government had almost 
completed a payroll survey of 
the Army and had so far found 
only 180.000 real soldiers on 
tions are further corn-
pounded by the policy dif-
ferences among Peking, 
Hanoi, and Moscow. 
"If they tried to get to-
gether a national leadership 
that could negotiate with 
Phnom Penh," one informed 
student of their affairs here 
/ said, "they would bring into 
the open so many problems 
and differences within their 
own ranks, it just wouldn't 
be worth it for them at this 
stage." 
Others would argue that 
there is no need to go into 
the internal problems of the 
Khmer Rouge, one of three 
major rebel groups, to con-
skler a settlement. Commu-
nists and ? noyt-commpnists

duty. He said this survey 
would he finished by the end 
of this month. 
The Minister said that at 
present the number of soldiers 
"on' paper" was 220,000, having 
been reduced recently from the 
paper high of 300,000. 
The Government of President 
Lon Nol is reportedly under 
heavy pressure from the United 
States, its principal benefactor, 
to crack down on the military 
corruption and improve the 
performance of the Cambodian 
armed forces. There were re 
ports, not confirmed ? officially, 
.that ? this was one of the mes-
'sages conveyed to. President 
Lon Nol by Gen. Alexander M. 
Haig Jr., President Nixon's rep-, 
resentative during his ...brief 
visit to Phnom Penh last wecic. 
There have also been unof-
ficial reports that men from the 
American Embassy's large mili-
tary aid team are assisting and 
overseeing the Cambodians in 
the current army payroll check. 
False payrolls are but one of 
the methods of military corrup-
tion here. Military supplies, 
from uniforms to medicines, 
often find their way to the 
open market?and sometimes 
into enemyhands. 
There is no doubt that the 
Government's awareness of the 
seriousness of the corruption 
probTeirrilia?? increased., But the 
Government has not taken a 
punitive approach toward the 
perpetrators, and reports of cor-
ruption continue. 
Just two days ago, a local 
newspaper reported that, in one 
largely "phantom" unit, the 
commander?because he feared 
his false payroll was about to 
be exposed?suddenly reported 
that 733 'men had deserted over 
the past month out of the unit's 
supposed total of 1,100. 
Other newspapers reported 
this Week that $1-million in 
uniforms provided through 
American aid had been un-
accounted for !since iast year. 
The Government has charged 
a few unit commanders with 
falsifying payrolls and has 
jailed them pending trial, but 
officials acknowledge privately 
that this only scratches the 
surface of the problem. Some 
officials say that if every guilty 
commander was put behind 
bars, the army would lose the 
bulk of its leadership and would 
disintegrate. . 
.? The Information Minister said 
the Government was attacking 
the problem "not., by suppres-
.i 
son but through prevention 
and . education." Asked later 
why the Government had not 
adopted a policy of stern pun-
ishment, he said: "The Khmer 
mentality does not depend on 
whether or not you punish ? a 
person. That's why we have 
chosen education and preven-
tion first. But if we ? have to 
punish, we will punish, because 
It has been preStribed by law."

Washimiten, D. C., Wrdriecriny, December 13, 1972 
Au

Td17] c 
By JOHN BURGESS 
Special to The Star?News 
BANGKOK ? "The flying is 
non-military; in other words, 
civilian flying. You are flying 
for the U.S. government, that 
is government agencies such 
as USOM, USAID, USIS, etc. 
While these agencies may be 
under CIA direction, you don't 
know and you don't care. The 
government agencies direct 
the routings and schedulings, 
your company provides the 
technical know-how and you 
fly the airplane." 
Thus an unnamed American 
pilot describes "civilian 
? flying" in Southeast Asia for 
Air America and the lesser 
known Continental Air Serv-
ices ? both private companies 
on contract to the U.S. govern-
ment. The pilot's comments 
are part of a confidential, 
16-page brochure available at 
certain Air Force personnel of-
fices. It is shown to Air Force 
pilots interested in flying for 
one of the companies upon 
completing their military serv-
ice. 
TKO brochure lists no author 
or publisher, but it offers an-
illuminating view into the in-
ternal operations of Air Amer-
ica, which has played a cru-
cial role in the Indochina war 
theater since the 1950s. Air 
America, along with the other 
companies, has airlifted 
troops, refugees, CIA agents, 
American politicians, war ma-
terial, food and occasionally 
prisoners all over Southeast 
Asia. 
Extravagant Salaries 
The brochure, dated June 29, 
? 1972, boasts that Air America 
ranked as one of the most 
profitable corporation in the 
United States in 1969, a year 
when most of the world's air-
lines lost heavily. Air Ameri-
ca's customer is the U.S. 
government. 
It employs about 436 pilots, 
according to the pamphlet, of 
? 
which 384 are working in 
Southeast Asia. The center of 
Air America's operation is 
Laos, where the presence of 
military or military-related 
personnel is prohibited by the 
much-abused Geneva Confer-
ence of 1962. 
Air America's profits are 
high despite the somewhat ex-
travagant salaries it pays for 
flying personnel. According to 
the report, a pilot with 11 
years experience, flying a 
UH-34D helicopter based at 
Udorn air base in Thailand an 
, average of 100 hours monthly, 
will take home $51,525. All sal-
aries are tax free. 
A newly hired pilot flying a 
C-7 Caribou transport based in 
Vientiane, averaging 100 hours 
flying time monthly, would 
earn a minimum $29,442. The 
U.S. commercial pilot average 
Is $24,000. 
Also available to Air Ameri-
ca personnel, in addition to a 
liberal expense account, is life 
and medical insurance, two-
weeks leave, tickets on other 
airlines at 20 percent normal 
cost, PX and government 
mailing privileges and educa-
tional allowances for depend-
ents. Many Air America pilots 
are retired military men re-
ceiving military pensions. 
'Good' Investment 
Americans can also become 
"air freight specialists", com-
monly called kickers. Their 
job is to push cargo out over 
drop zones. Salary is 
$1,600-$1,800 per month. Quali-
fications: American citizen-
ship, air borne training, expe-
rience with the U.S. Air Force 
preferred. 
Air America, Inc., is owned 
by a private aviation invest-
ment concern called the Pacif-
ic Corp. Dunn and Brad-
street's investment directory 
places its assets in the $10-$50 
million category, and rates it 
"good" as an investment risk. 
Air America itself employs al- .1 
Ili'; . _: ? l'") ? 
together about 8,000 persons, 
ranking in size just below Na-
tional Airlines and above most 
? of the smaller U.S. domestic 
airlines. 
Formerly called Civil Air 
Transport (CAT), Air America 
was organized after World 
War II by General Claire 
Chennault, commander of the 
American fighter squadrons in 
Burma and China known as 
the Flying Tigers. CAT played 
a major role in post-war China 
supplying Nationalist troops. 
CAT also supplied the French 
during their phase of the war 
in Indochina. 
Air America is commonly 
considered an arm of the CIA. 
In Laos, the CIA for the past 
10 years or more has main-
tained an army of hill tribe-
men, mainly Thai and Lao 
mercenaries. Most of the air 
supply and transport needs for 
this army have been handled 
by Air America., 
Military Assistance 
Though the brochure does 
net mention opium explicitly, 
it hints at the subject of con-
traband: 
"Although flights mainly 
serve U.S. official personnel 
movement and native officials 
and civilians, you sometimes 
?engage in the movement of 
friendly troops, or of enemy 
captives; or in the transport of 
cargo much more potent than 
rice and beans! There's a war 
going on. Use your imagina-
tion!" 
Air America works hand-
in-hand with the U.S. Air 
Force. At Udorn air base in 
Thailand, Air Force mechan-
ics repair the airline's trans-
ports and helicopters, many of 
them unmarked. The Air 
Force has reportedly leased 
giant C130 transports when the 
planes were needed for opera-
tions in Laos. In the section on 
Air America's benefits, the 
brochure lists in addition to 
normal home and sick leave: 
"Military leave will be grant-
ed appropriately" ? an appar-
ent acknowledgement that 
there are military people 
working directly with Air 
America. 
One should not conclude, 
however, that the salaries, ex-
citement and tax advantages 
mean that Air America pilots

hope the war will continue. As 
the brochure's author notes in 
a typed postscript: 
"Foreign aid situation un-

tary situation in RVN (Repub-
lic of Vietnam), but it looks as 
if we'll finish the war (and

of changing crops. 
But the Government price for 
opium is Only about onc-fifth 
the price on the open

west .Laos is dangerous enough 
as it is without extra antago-
nizing of the tribes." 
?Enforcement officials hope 
that narcotics passing .through 
Laos will .be steadily ? reduced, 
but they acknowledge that the 
smugglers involved are experts, 
generally a step or two, ahead 
of them. - 
One enforcement official said: 
"The ?old days when Corsican 
adventurers flew a fleet of light 
planes from Laos to deliver 
their stuff around Indochina 
are over. Now the big dealers 
seem to be relying on military 
aviation, and that is very much 
harder to control. We 'hope 
military police will cut the 
traffic . down, but you can 
imagine the problem, having to 
check every T-28 fighter before 
it takes off on a mission." . 
And then, referring to a Balti-
more Federal Court case re-
ported on last week, he added: 
"And when you hear that heroin 
has been shipped to the States 
inside the bodies of G.I.'s killed 
in action, you know you're up 
against . periple who will ? stop 
t elease 2001/0 
ma and northern Thailand, La-
os is a traditional transship-
ment area for smugglers send-
ing drugs through Thailand to 
Singapore, Hong Kong and oth-
er major ports. 
" In Laos herself it is believed 
" that somewhere between 10 
and 30 tons of opium are 
grown each year. The manu-
facture of heroin requires about 
20 pounds of opium for each 
round of heroin. 
? , During the height of Amer-
ican .ground combat participa-
tion in South Vietnam, most of 
the heroin reaching American 
soldiers in that country is be-
lieved to have been manufac-
tured * at a jungle refinery 
called Hoy Tay in the vicinity 
of the Laotian border village of 
Ban Houei said. 
This refinery was discovered 
by anti-narcotics agents after 
it had been dosed down and 
demolished by its operators. , 
Two full-time narcotics 
agents of the Bureau of Nar-
.cotics and Dangerous Drugs, 
as well as American customs, 
civil and military police advis-
ers, are currently working in 
Laos, and more are on the way 
here. 
Paradoxically, narcotics ex-
perts say, the success achieved 
,in recent months in blocking 
narcotics traffics between the 
royal capital of Luang Prapang 
and Vietiane has apparently 
provided an incentive to poppy 
farmers to grow more opium.
