 DOICECASTS OF THE CHINESE COX'4UNIST RADIO
 a.  Background:  Before the end of World War II the Chinese Communists began their radio
 propaganda war against the HYtominteng Nationalist Government from a transmitting point
 announced an Yenan, then the capital oflCou muniat China.' With Yenan'e fall Sri 19 March
 1947, Chinese Communist broadcasting was transferred, without a break in trans-!scion,
 to somewhere in North Shensi.
 After the Communist capture of Peking, the North Shensi station was immediately, relegated
 to a position of lees than secondary importance.  In its place, the Peking Navl China
 Broadcasting Station was set up as the center of Communist radio propaganda.  Associated
 with it is a loose network of stations in many major cities, among them Harbin;IMUkden,
 Sian,! Hanirow, the Central Plains, Shanghai, Nanking, and 'Canton.  Those stations carry
 Peking broadcast material and, in addition, present news of local interest.
 b.  Sources of Broadcast Material:  TheINEil CHINA NEWS AGENCY, the official Chinese
 Communist news-gathering agency, provides all Communist radio stations with news.  It is
 also probable that some of the news items with a Soviet .ateline are supplied by TASS
 which', as for as is known, is the only foreign nave agency which is permitted to operate
 in Communist China.
 a.  Dialects and LanguSges Used:  The Yenan and North Shenel Broadcasting Stations
 originally broadcast only in putunghua'I or "Muo Yu," whi,oh litereily means the "cocoa
 language." that is, the type of Mandarin spoken in the Peking area.
 Althou6h this dialect prcee
 me certain difficulties to
 the announcer in
 pronunciation and
 intonation as well as in the use of local expressions which vary to a greater or lesser
 degree in other parts of China, the Communists probably chose this dialect for their radio
 propaganda because it is  the most wide'v spoken dialect.'  Later, Japanese and $agliah
 language voioeoaete were added; but no ot: .er Chinese dialects were used until Poking came
 under 'ommuniet control in March of 1949'.  The Harbin station was the first to carry the
 Cantonese dialect, but dropped it when the Peking stationllbegan broadcasting Cantonese
 and other local dialects.
 Early~in 1919, following the capture of Nanking and Southwest and Southeast China, the.
 New China Broadcasting Station expanded its operations tolinclude dailylbroadca'atain
 the Cantonese, Cheochow, and the Amoy dialects.  The news carried on these additional
 voloeoasts is generally a more condensed version of the news broadcast in Mandarin,
 The Chinese Communists' radio propaganda is noteworthy for Its simplicity and charity of
 language and the avoidance of the literary 1Pnguage so often found in Nationalist voice-
 caste Which are quite beyond the grasp of the masses.  The Communists appear tolhave
 adapted the language of their broadcasts in such a manneras to make them as understand-
 able as possible to the average Chinese peasant and worker.
 The scripts of the newscasts are prepared in the simple, clear, and effective "Pal hug"--
 the modern version of Mandarin in its simplest form. This dialect was introduced about
 thirty years ago as the beat available common denominator for the unification of the
 various Chinese dialects.  It is also the one which has been most widely teughtland
 studied in Chinese secondary schools over the past twenty years.  (It would probably
 take the average Chinese student six to eight years to learn the Cantonese dialect, but
 only two or three years to become conversant in the common "Dal hua."  The Nationalist
 radio, on the other hand, still clings to its lose intelligible literary style which
 is stilted, platitudinous, and beyond the grasp of most Chinese who have~not hadia
 secondary education.)
 Although the Communist radio uses long sentences, it breaks them up into intelligible
 phrases of simple words.  Only broadcasts made directly bye important Chinese Communist
 Party officials would be unintelligible to the average listener; and then the substance
 of such broadcasts is rewritten and rebroadcast in simpler terms by competent station
 announcers.

 The Cormunlet, news and commentaries appear to be written with the least literate person in
 mind.  The, announcers move down to the level of the masses by meticu ously explaining any
 u?:conm(in words in their broadcasts.
 d.  Announcers:   Communist radio announcers give the appearance of being well-trained ard
 well-educated.  Althoughlthe substance of their material is directeL.iby the Party line, they
 present it! in,
 unemotional fashion.  Generally, Communist radio announcers
 appear to !be more concerned with clear enunciation of each individual word than with
 inflecting', words, phrases, or sentences in a manner that might appeal to the emotions or
 literary tastes of the radio audience.
 'Women announcers seem tobe preferred to men in Communist China.  To many (and perhaps
 most) Chinese listeners,la woman announcer has a crisper and clearer delivery and more
 precise tonal inflectional with generally make for a more effective broadcast.
 e.  The Written Word:  Recently, a continuous improvement in the preparation and writing of
 news commentaries has been noted.  The better choice of words for the general listener and
 the simpler' sentence structure are the more noticeable of such improvements.
 All observations made)                       indicate that the scripts for the voicecaste are  25X1
 written byla'staff of wri ere although       is likely that a few or even one person passes
 final judginent on the finished copy.
 f.  Technical Qualities of PekinRStation:  The Peking station's transmitting (Morse) and
 broadcasting, voice  foci"sties, which were captured from the Nationalists, have proven
 far superior; to those of the old North Shensi station.  This was ref acted' in the increased
 intelligibility, (reception-wise) of the Communist broadcasts after the Peking radio
 station fell', into the hand's of the Communists.
 Further, the, Communists hl,'ve greatly improved the station's operation as compared to its
 operation by the Nationalj''ate.  This is evidenced primarily in the much-reduced number of
 Peking breakdowns.  Since the Chinese Communists are known to have feu radio technicians
 cenebl. of keeping a large radio station in excellent operating condition, it appears
 probable that they may have called in foreign technicians to maintain the station.  In any
 event, iteIgreatly improved maintenance is an indirect testimony to t1 he importance accorded
 mess comm..znioationa by thei Chinese Communists.
 g.  Portrayal of Leaders:  The Communists appeal to the masses by picturing Mao Tse-tung,
 Chu Teh, and, itheir other leaders as common man who are only interested in the masses, whore-
 as the Nationalists have played up Chiang iai-ehek as somewhat of a god.  The Nationalist
 leaders have remained on somewhat of a pedestal out of reach of the C ineso masses; but
 a Communietlleader is pictured as "one of the toys."

 PIICING'S "NEAT CHINA NEWS AGENCY" MORSECAST TO NORTH AMERICA
 Technically the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (NCNA) transmitters have been improved from the
 unstable ones which frequently went off the air in the daily tto-hour Itranemiasion from
 Yenan a few years ago.  Currently, NCNA'a dispatches go out over stable, three to five-
 hour automatic tape transmissions from higher-powered transmitters InlPeking.   (Although
 there still, are occasional,        in the code transmissions from the  eking Communist
 station, it isbelieved tat these breaks may pueaibly be due to line ~troublea between the
 studios and the transmitter, which probably is located outside Peking.)
 Also, although the old transmitter of Yemen and North Shensi was ofte  drowned out by louder
 signals, the' new transmitters in Peking remain loud and clear           long after moot
 other signals from the Far' Boat have faded out with the coming of daylight at the receiving
 station.
 The operators at the Peking NCNA station seldom out a wrong letter In the transmitting
 tape.
 During the past four and one-half years, the NCNA transmission has steadily improved in

 Its news ettiyle until toda-v It is far ba tter written, punctuated, and edited than any foreign
 newscast received                          Four years ago this program had such an involved
 style that it often was airricult to     ecover the meaning of some of the long and compli-
 cated sentences, and sometimes the editor would have 1o give up and say "as received."
 Peking's NONA Morse transmission Ia now received eompl "to with definite and indefinite
 articles, meticulous punctuation, and carefully paragraphing no that it may be          d
 to Washington with less editing than any newscast oves1 received
 There Is strong evidence that after the copy is transmitted it is carefully checked for the
 smallest detailo, as the operator on completion of a program often (until recently) sent
 nor corrections to his copy which usually did not 1r4 any way change the meaning of the
 If the Copy is written originally in Chinese and they. tranalated into English, which
 appears likely, then the NSW CHINA NEWS AGENCY translators do a remarkably good Job.  The
 rather involved Chinese Communist ideological jargon a pears in free-flowing English.
 And the texts as received in English Morse have always been found quite accurate, when
 compared with the original Mandarin-language broadoaat of the same item.
 The consistently well-edited transmissions and the slLilarity in style of almost all of the
 copy would indicate that' either one editor carefully cieoka over all of the copy, even,
 when it carries the by-line of a so-called "field corrpepondent," or a few editors with
 similar news backgrounds carefully check all copy before transmission.
 It almost always takes the Communist NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY about two or three days to
 comment on important events.
 RADIO =COW'S KOREAN-LANGUAGE BROADCASTS
 Th'a revt+* Is based on daily programslimonitored                        at 0300, 04.30. and
 0715 L'..   The first two programs emphasize interne  o    affairs, x arose the third
 atressee nave of more particular interest to Koreans. ?The propaganda line in all three,
 however, is that the Soviet Union wishes to unite Korea and rid it of the so-called inter-
 fering American imperialists.
 a. I POMMatarlea:  Moscow's Korean-language broadcasts follow the Soviet radio's
 al
 gener
 poli   of Including one commentary in each program.   T~e commentary subjects range from
 diatriboe against Anglo-American warmongering and imperialism' to praise of the People's
 Democraoiae and the Soviet Union's leadership in the camp of peace.  On such oooasions
 as the co  quing of the Paris World Peace Congress and Ithe anniversary of the October
 Revolution, on-the-scene recordings of Moscow oelebrat ens are usually given in place of
 the regular ostmentaries.,
 At least onecommpntary each day Is devoted exclusively to Korean affairs.  Frequent
 themes are: (1) the, Soviet Union is the liberator of thfe Korean people; (2) the govern-
 ment of the Demoora.~Io People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) Is the sole legal
 government representing the people of both North Korea pnd South Korea; (3) the South
 Korean Government is thq., puppet government of Syngman Rhea, who is a traitor to Korea
 And a tool of the Uni~;et1~ takes imperialiste; (4) the United States hopes to transform
 South Korea into a Colo  ;._   a military base in the Far East to be used against the
 people's. liberation movemen sand the Soviet Union; (5) the United Nations Commission on
 Korea is an instrument of W r7. Street and Is carrying out the schemes of the imperialists.
 The Moscow radio also praises the democratic reforms and the economic progress that
 allegedly have led to a higher standard lof living for North Korea than for South Korea.'
 Numerous reports on guerrilla activity in South Korea a so are said to indicate how
 deeply the South Koreans hate the United States.        fi
 b.  News Items:,  Except for somewhat more attention to orean events, the substantive
 pattern of Moscow's Korean-language news itemb is othe   so generally undistinguisheble,

 from Moscow's news items broadcast in other languages.
 There is a considerable time lag between news events and Mosociv'~ Korean-language reporting
 of them   The lag appears to be greater than is true of MoeoowiaI broadcasts to Western
 Europe.  This is true even in news of great interest to Koreana,1  For example, the
 assassination of Kim Koo, chairman of the Korean Independence Pi ty and past president of
 the Korean Proviaional-Government in exile, was not reported nnti1 28 June 1949, two days
 after it had occurred.  Even quotations from the Pyongyang radio or the Chinese Communist
 NEW CHIl!A NEWS AGENCY,    usually given with a TASS credit line, are broadcast at least
 two days late.
 o.  Announcing:  During the past few year: there has been a noticeable    rovemen t
 in
 Moscow's announcing of the three programs monitored                         About two and
 one half years ago, for example, the                                                               25X1
 programs were a re  by one: ocean-language announcer
 who spoke Korean with a decided Russian accent.  Now, however ,''!'there are two announcers
 who speak Korean as if it were native to them.
 Two of the three monitored Korean -language programs are brToadooa1 by a male announcer who
 reads his scriptslIcarefully and pronounces his words diatinotly'  His tone is even and he
 paces himself well.  He sounds like a well-educated Korean.
 The third Korean-language program is broadcast by a woman announcer who sounds somewhat
 less educated than the man and whose broadcast style is less profession].
 Usually she becomes excited and raises her voice, especially when reading padsages denounc-
 ing the American imperialists in South Korea, Synguan Rhe, or other representatives of
 capitalist countries.  She does not pace herself well and~gives~;,~he listener the
 impression she wishes to cram every possible word into her broadcast, with the result that
 she sometimes mispronounces words in her hosts.
 The sentence structure of all the monitored Korean-language items is
 generally consistent
 and would be intelligible to almost all Koreans.
 KHABAROVSK'S KM MN-LANGUAGE BROADCASTS
 a.  Content:  Although most of Khabarovsk's Korean-language broadcasts are repeats of
 broadcast items originated by Moscow, the Khabarovsk station applars to have some freedom
 in initiating comment  lea of its own, partioularl,r on Asian affairs and economic develop-

 MOSCOW'S JAPANESE-LANGUAGE BROADCASTS
 On the average, Moscow's Japanese-language programs devote from:lfjtve to seven minutes to
 Soviet news, about five minutes to international news, two or thr a minutes to music, and
 from ten to twenty minutes to commentaries.                        I
 Among the deviations from the general time allotments for variouainews categories were
 the prisoner-of-war messages which were first broadcast early In'' .947 and continued until
 October of 1949.  These messages consisted of the names andTaddreeses of   prisoners of
 war together with reassuring messages from them.  These messages`have been given only once-'
 on 2 November 19149 -since they were generally discontinued in Oct bar 1949.

 ;2ecently a month's and program hitherto only broadcast irregularly has become a  egular
 feature of the Moscow's Japanese-language br.adcasts.  In this feature, the announcer asks
 listenerso send in requests for programs or questions to be answered! In spite of the
 announcer's suggestions, however, only a very few listeners' requests have been answered,
 and those ponsieted of such innocuous questions as those concerning the role of women in
 a country like the USSR or comparisons of the Japanese and Soviet governmental systems.
 The Moscow radio has often deviated from the regular broadcast pattern with such special
 features aQ "The Woman's Hour," "The Youth Hour," and a Sunday evening ,concert hour.
 Although Moscow's Japanese-language propaganda themes follow the general Soviet propaganda
 pattern, there appears to be greater attention to the Japanese scene than in Soviet broad-
 casts beamed to other audiences.  As everywhere, however, attention is called toithe
 perfidy of the American imperialist warmongers who in the case of Japan are turning it
 into a military base for their nefarious purposes.
 a.  Announi,       All of the Japanese-language announcers currently used by Radi' Moscow
 speak the language as if they were native Japanese.
 Japanese monitors                           believe one of the women Ja anele-le   aa~ announcers !        ngu                 25X1
 is Yoehiko Okada, a ramous Japanese actress who went into exile In the early thirties.
 This particular announcer has an extremely dramatic manner of broadcasting.   Sheiuses the
 typical masculine style used in the Japanese press rather than the polite feminine style
 of Japanese with its, frills and honorifice - "gozaimasu."  (It Is not considered, good form
 for a woman} to speak the masculine style of Japanese.)  Although it cannot be conclusively
 stated tha~ Yoehiko Okada is one of Moscow's principal Japanese-language announcers, it
 is known that she Is with the Soviets and connected with the broadoeeta from the
 USSR.
 The announcer believed to be Miss Okada has frequently come on the air with such announce-
 ments as, 'this is Yoshiko Okada's impression of the Octo..er Revolution."
 Moscow's poorest Japanese-language announcer is a man who at the and of each sentence drops
 his voice ifo such an extent that he often renders the entire sentence unintelligible.
 b.  The Japanese Style Used by the Moscow Radio:  The style of Japanese used by the Moscow
 radio leaves -Ruch to be desired.  The Japanese sentences ramble on into long series of
 phrases anc~ clauses which often cover half a typewritten page.  Such sentences often would
 appear to be almost unintelligible to the average Japanese listener, or at least difficult
 to follow.  In the Japanese language, the subject with its modifiers, the object with Its
 modifiers, and other'sections of the sentences are given before the ve-b.  And as a result
 of Moscow's exceedingly long sentences, a Japanese listening to the Mosccow radio would
 have the ccnfueing challenge of listening to and remembering a half-page sentence before
 Ye could understand what had actually been said.
 There are, however, some differen.es in the styles of Japanese used over the Moscow radio.
 Some of the translators appear to translate more freely, thereby producing a more
 acceptable newscast than others who translate quite literally and produce a more stilted
 broadcast.  Generally, however, the over-all translating could not be considered good, in
 en+.te of the fact that some tra? 9lat:ons are far better than others.

 The operators of the Viet Minh station seem to be primarily concerned withI,,ving their
 hietenera every Scrap of information about the progrese!of the struggle against the French,
 oven if it means sacrificing current covereae for the sake of news months old.  For example
 !about two years ago when the fighting was heavy around!Hanoi, the station went off the
 air in the middle of a transmission and was presumed to! have been captured.)  About Seven
 months later the transmissions were resumedlrith the announcement that the lstation had been
 bombed and that it was then operating in a new location somewhere on the Tonkin border.'  It
 then proceeded for the next several weeks to bring itei!listeners up to date on the war
 developments with a summary of all events which had taken place since the station was
 bombed.
 Recently the propaganda bleats at the French centered on the attack by the 'French on the
 Vietnam center of Catholicism, Phatdiem.  The Viet Mia',Ireporto emphasize the faith of the
 victims andllpicture the French as anti-religious.
 The le
 aguage used on the Viet Minh transmissions is often crude and extremely frank to the
 point of being objectionatle.  Many details of the rape; and murder allegedly committed by
 the Wrench would not be printable In the United States.  The tranamissic.is are also replete
 with such grotesqueries as "heartfelt afflictions" for the victims of the French. Ge ly the Viet Minh English Morse transmissions are, the worst received
 romlthe Orient; they have more misspelled and misused words and poorer grammar

 Judging by the monitored broadcasts, the newawriters for the Korean-language' programs use
 both Chinese characters and the more easily understood Korean alphabet in the preparation
 of their scripts.
 It appears that Radio Seoul does not aim its broadcasts at the average listener as consist-
 ently se does the Soviet radio.
 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE VOICE BROADCASTS FROM THE FAR EAST
 a.  Saigon in English:  The Saigon radio's newscasts' consist almost entirely of foreign
 news items.. A typical program might begin with a Hong Kong or China item, followed by one
 or two items from India, and is sprinkling of internationally datelined news from such
 countries as Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Britain, the Philippines, and the United States.
 Local Indochinese news is played down.
 The Saigon radio does not appear to be a vary well-managed station or to ta.
 care in its presentation of its En8lishpro                                           pishar
 grams.  For example, this stationI'a English
 pproograms, although scheduled for broadcast at 050C, actually begin any time from 0453 to
 Little care also seems to have been taken to select announcers wh
 without objectionable foreign accents.  A woman announcer who makes most of the Saigon
 radio's broadcasts has a rather Anglo-French accent.  Sometimes she pronounces common
 Chinese place names in such al manner as to make them virtually unidentifiable until the
 monitor has been able to check the item with other broadcasts from India or Singapore.
 One out of every five or six broadcasts is made by a man who is a more competent announcer.
 He, too, has a French accent.
 b.  Bangkok in English:  Bangkok's Engl!eh-language broadcasts are abo
 between domestic and foreign                                              ut eggalon dglid
 news.  The announcers use a slow, painful, sing-song En English
 which is usually almost unintelligible.  One of its programs consists of talks on such
 subjects as Siamese legends or instructions on the care and feeding of tropical fish.
 c.  Singapore in En  iah:  Singapore's news coverage parallels that of the BBC in London,
 except for the fact that most 'Singapore broadcasts begin with the latest fig-;res In the
 bandit extermination campaign in Malaya. Singapore's announcer's follow the BBC's style
 of straight, unemotional news presentation.
 d.  New Delhi in English-  About three-fifths of the Items in the All-India radio's
 English-language newscasts are' devoted to domestic eventa; the remainder are concerned
 with Far Eastern and other international developments   Speeches by such Indian leaders
 as Nehru and Patel are presented in extreme detail--even such addresses as those made in
 connection with the laying of cornerstones.
 Indian announcers appear to have high professional standards and seldom mispronounce
 words in their crisp, British accents.  In general, the All-India Radio adheres to the
 practices characteristic of the BBC and given an ou::ward appearance of complete impartial-
 ity.    Its selection and structuring of the news presented, however, are done in such a
 way as to defend and further India's Interests without appearing to do so.
 e.  Pakistan in ]hgl1ah:  The Pakistan radio's English-language broadcasts devote about
 three-fourths of their nave items to domestic events and the rest to Far Eastland world
 developments.
 A typical program of Pakistan might include: a to
 economic conference;                                ng report on an international Islamic
 reports on the opening of new factories and terminal buildings at
 airports; a few denials of Indian statements (in the event of any India-Pakistan
 altercation), and some short foreign news items.    A typical program contain about 30
 different Items.

 devoediabout ninety percent of its coverage to news of Chinese origin or of direct
 bearing', on. the civil war.  A typical broadcast been with a statement by a government
 military spokesman on developments atjthe various civil war battle Pronto, followed by a
 report about plane made by the executive Yuan, and a few reports from. Macao or Hong Kong.
 Although there was come admission on the part of the Nationalist redio'thet the
 Kuomintinggovernment had its beck to the wall, this was usually a qualified admission.
 War communiques reported that the Nationalists had met and repulsed the,Communiata in e
 certain'sector, or that the battle Inlsome other area had reached a stalemate.  This type
 of reporting has continued from. before the days of announcements that Shanghai would be
 snotherlStalingrad.
 The Chungking radio announcers who broadcast the English-language programs spoke English
 eo poorly that an untrained ear would at first conclude that the news was not being given
 in English.',  The English used by the Chungking radio contained many errors in grammar,
 poor sentence construction, and poor paragraph construction which sometimes required

 The Pakistan radio does not give as much of an appearance of impartiality as does the
 All-India'Radio.  In altercations with India, for example, it quotes statements from the
 Pakistan press that hit hard and directly at Indian policies and statements.
 Foreign!neva that is broadcast by Radio Pakistan usually cameo from REUTERS and is
 presentadin a s;;raignt news style.
 Pakistan 'aiannouncers have a British accent superimposed on what appears to be one of
 the localtonguea.  The result is a shorter, more clipped accent than that characteristic
 of the-All-India radio announcers; the Pakistan announcers are some what more difficult
