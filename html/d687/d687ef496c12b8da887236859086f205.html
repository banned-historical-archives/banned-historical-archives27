 USSR:
 Leadership Defending Security Policies
 r!s the Soviet Party Congress approaches, tfie Politburo is increasingly
 defensive about cArarges jrortt traditionalists that it has bungled policy
 ort arms control and Easrerrt Europe.
 In yesterday's Pravda, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze defended his
 Ministry and its policies and attacked critics in the military and
 defense industries. He said that the General Staff is the center for
 elaborating arms control policy and that the MFA has only one seat
 ~in the group making decisions. Shevardnadze pointedly compared
 discussion of "who lost Eastern Europe" to the McCarthy era and
 Minister of Defense Marshal Yazov agreed in this morning's Pravda
 with Shevardnadze's account of decisionmaking. Moreover,
 Politburo member Zaykov, who is the party secretary responsible for
 oversight of the armed forces, insisted recently in Pravda that Soviet
 arms control policy is not the product of President Gorbachev's
 vanity or established to please foreign audiences but is set through
 broad debate among military and civilian specialists
 In a speech to military cadets yesterday, Gorbachev praised the
 army's selfless defense of the homeland but forcefully defended the
 need for military reforms to reduce budget outlays and to end
 "negative phenomena" in army life. In its report on the meeting,
 TASS for the first time in several months identified Gorbachev as the
 --head of the Defense Council.
 Comment: Gorbachev and other Politburo members are trying to
 defuse criticism of their security policies that is sure to be raised next
 week at the party Congress. Traditionalist criticism of Gorbachev's
 security policies has been growing at party Central Committee
 plenums since December, and senior military officers raised arms
 control, East European, and domestic security issues at the recent
 Russian party congress. Gorbachev's ability to parry their attacks at
 the Congress will determine their impact on poliCY on arms control,
 Germany, and the Baltic republics.
 Status of the Embargo an Lithuania
 Lithuania's economic situation remains largely unchanged since Moscow's announcement
 two weeks ago of several measures to case the embargo, but Vilnius is increasingly co~rcerned
 about the impact on the harvest of a shortage of fuels and lubricants.
 Moscow promised to review the issue of supplying fuel for agriculture but has not announced
 a decision. A dry spring has helped Lithuania by delaying crop growth somewhat, but the
 lack of fuel for farm machinery could drastically reduce the harvest of grain and other food
 crops, which should begin by late next month:
 -Vilnius estimates that it will run out of engine lubricating oil and gasoline for
 agricultural machinery by early next month and that stocks of diesel fuel will last until
 midmonth.
 -Haying, which continues through the summer and produces essential feed for the
 meat and dairy industries, is lagging because of a fuel shortage.
 -Harvest support from unemployed people and students and the use of hand tools and
 horsedrawn machinery will not compensate for the loss of mechanized equipment.
 ~--Shortages of fuel for transportation are slowing distribution of agricultural products
 and other goods to processing centers and markets.
 Industrial output appears to have stabilized; the numbers of unemployed workers and closed
 plants has not changed significantly for several weeks. Moscow has made goad on its promise
 to increase the supply of natural gas; Lithuania is receiving about 10.5 million cubic meters
 of natural gas per day, nearly norntal supplies for this time of the year:
 -The Jonava fertilizer plant, which uses natural gas as feedstock, reportedly is
 operating at current full capacity.
 -Lithuania has received less than half its usual monthly supply of bottled gas, however,
 which is used primarily in rural households.
 -There is also no evidence available that the supply of raw materials to plants
 subordinated to the republic has increased as Moscow promised.
 ~[ilA'SeeFet_
 Premier Prunskiene yesterday told the Lithuanian legislature
 Gorbachev had telephoned her and had said that, to get
 independence talks started, he was willing to accept a moratorium on
 the repubIic's independence declaration as defined recently by the
 Lithuanian Council of Ministers. In urging its legislature to consider
 . the moratorium, the republic government had emphasized that such
 a move would preserve Lithuania's inde endent status durin
 negotiations and,                                   w
 not entail acceptance o  oviet law.

 USSR.             Gorbachev ShoN~s New Flexibility on LethustnIA
 The So-~iet leader appears to be softening his position on Lithuania,
 increasing the possibility that tRr raptrblic's le8islatsr-e wilt takt stews
 Before calling Prunskiene, Gorbachev met with Lithuanian President
 Landsbergis, who laid out several variants of the moratorium
 proposal to be debated by the republic legislature. In a subsequent
 speech to the legislature, Landsbergis described Moscow as newly
 flexible but said he still wants guarantees about the consequences of
 a moratorium. A Lithuanian spokesman said yesterday the legislature
 options.
 Comment: Gorbachev's acceptance of a moratorium that leaves
 Lithuanian legal independence intact would mark a major concession
 __by allowing the Lithuanians to exempt themselves from the law on
 secession. He may have decided to soften his position in part because
 of promises of support for the Baltic causes from Russian Kepublic
 Chairman Yel'tsin and liberal governments in Leningrad and
 Moscow. He and his advisers also seem increasingly convinced they
 severely limited if they stick to a hard line in the Baltic region.
 Gorbachev's new flexibility increases the chances the Lithuanian
 legislature will adopt some kind of moratorium declaration. Most
 Lithuanian legislators, however, are likely to share Landsbergis's
 concern about guarantees. Thus, any declaration probably would link
 Soviet law is not in force in the republic.

 The Democratic Bloc, an electoral slate made up of Rukh, the
 Helsinki Union, the Union of Independent Ukrainian Youth, the
 Green Movement, and other grassroots groups, this spring won 20 to
 25 percent of the seats in the new 450-member republic legislature.
 The Bloc delivered solid proindependence majorities to city soviets
 (councils) in Lvov, Ternopol, and Tvano-Frankovsk in the western
 Ukraine.
 The non-Communist governments there are now moving to strip the
 =local Communist Party--the second-largest organization in the USSR
 'and still the ruling power in the southern, eastern, and rural areas of
 the Ukraine-of its power and property and are pushing for an
 independent Ukrainian state.
 The BIoc also commands a third of the seats in the Kiev city soviet.
 '   As in the republic-level legislature, it is not strong enough to impose
 its own will but is able to block the party-dominated majority. In a
 -victory for the Bloc, the party was forced to compromise on the
 ' candidate for Kiev's mayor last month; it chose a reformer instead
 of the apparatus candidate.
 USSR:             Politics Shifting In the Ukraine
 Tire election ojlrardliner Stanislav Gurenko as first secretary of the
 Ukrainian Communist Party leaves Supreme Soviet Chairman Vladimir
 Ivashko freer to play a centrist role err the republic but may strertFtlrert
 a traditionalist trend in the rratiortal party.
 The Ukrainian Communists showed a deeply conservative mood
 by choosing Gurenko, who had close career ties to former party
 boss Shcherbitskiy and often sided against reform. The size of
 the margin-80 percent voted for Gurenko--and the tenor of the
 speeches at the congress made clear the depth of resentment over the
 party's declining power. Regional party leaders assailed Gorbachev
 and his Politburo allies Yakovlev and Medvedev for leading the party
 and the economy into crisis.
 Ivashko resigned as head of the Ukrainian party after becoming
 chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet. Opposition to his holding
 both top posts had come from the Ukrainian popular movement,
 Rukh, which controls 25 percent of the legislature, and from
 independent deputies in the legislature. (C NF)
 $oth party officials and Rukh leaders see Ivashko as a centrist.
 An editor of a reformist youth paper recently said his position was
 similar to Gorbachev's, only worse. New Deputy Chairman of the
 Supreme Soviet Grinev, who was elected as Ivashko's compromise
 candidate to mollif  the  art 's reform w'   doubts reform of th
 party is possible.
 Comment: Ivashko now has a freer hand to pursue Ukrainian
 autonomy and reforn~ of the republic's government. HP will try to
 create a stable power center in the legislature, which is split along
 factional, regional, and ideological lines. He will find it hard,
 however, to reconcile traditionalists and the reformist opposition.
 Gurenko's election probably will speed the exodus from the party of
 Communist members disheartened at the lack of democratic reform
 and will make the party even more a bastion of traditionalists. Rukh
 leaders and many of their supporters have already quit to form
 independent parties, and members of the Democratic Platform
 and many Donbass miners have threatened to follow.
 The Ukrainian events will have national reverberations. Gurenko's
 election may further embolden traditionalists in other republics, and
 Ivashko's decision to give, un his party Host may increase pressure on
 POLAND:           Energy Price Hilces May Help !!'alesa
 Impending energy price increases may hand Lech Walesa a ready
 weapon in his campaign to claim the political heritage oJSolidarity
 and gain the Polish presidency.
 Solidarity activists favoring Prime Minister Mazowiecki's policies
 split with Walesa after a bitter debate at a meeting of the National
 Citizen's Committee on Sunday. Delegates from the Iargely
 autonomous regional Citizen's Committees will meet this weekend
 with both factions vying for support.
 Walesa met recently with leaders of the Peasant and Democratic
 Parties, Solidarity's coalition partners in the legislature. A regional
 Rural Solidarity offccial said his organization was all  in with
 Polish Primate Cardinal Glemp has issued a vague
 en orsement o the `"Center Accord," a body that aides to Walesa
 created to advance his presidential campaign.
 Meanwhile, Warsaw is moving ahead with plans to raise prices for
 electricity and natural gas by 80 to 100 percent on Sunday.
 owing
 -Tabor restivene~So~rity m~  ling  ei  tent a possibility of
 widespread opposition to the price increases. Such a development
 would help Walesa press his case that faster political change,
 including his own move to the presidency, is essential to maintain
 support for economic reform.
 Mazowiecki is unlikely to withdraw the price reforms, which the
 government believes are necessary to promote conservation and
 industrial restructuring, but he probably will feel compelled to relax
 wage controls further. He may also be close to abandoning efforts
 to delay a Walesa presidency. Walesa's maneuvering with the
 government's coalition partners
 creates uncertainty about the government s a  qty to maintain
 a parliamentary majority and the viability of a Mazowiecki
 government in tandem with a Walesa presidency.

 The Interior Ministry yesterday threatened to break up two-week-old
 student demonstrations against unfairness in the national elections
 earlier this month. The opposition Union of Democratic Forces
 (UDF) has thrown its support behind the demonstrations and has
 drawn crowds of 40,000 on each of the past two days. The strikers
 have called a news conference on Saturday to discuss their key
 demands: an open investigation of alleged electoral fraud, the
 resignation of the head of Bulgarian television, and a determination
 of authenticity of a videotape showing President Mladenov
 recommending the use of tanks against a demonstration last
 when the legislature meets on 10 July.
 Comment: The use of security forces would risk a violent
 confrontation with students; a backlash against the Bulgarian
 Socialist Party (BSP) probably would ensue in highly politicized Sofia
 and would set back efforts to attract Western support. The government
 is aware of the risks and may yet hold back. If it moves, it almost
 certainly will make every effort to avoid the violent tactics used in
 Romania. The UDF's support for the students indicates it is losing
 -              interest in legislative coexistence with the BSP and will press charges of
 West European Reliance on Soviet Natural Gas
 The EC Commission has agreed to evaluate a Dutch proposal for a
 ?'.European Energy Community involving the USSR and the EC. The
 proposal, which calls for using Soviet natural gas in European
 pipelines as collateral for Wcst European loans to the Soviets,
 underscores Western Europe's need for? additional natural gas
 supplies and its capacity to store additional gas. The Soviets can
 ? currently export about 100 bitlion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year
 to Western Europe by pipeline. Last year Austria, Finland, France,
 ?   Ztaly, West Germany, and other countries imported 48 bcm of Soviet
 natural gas, or 18 percent of total regional gas consumption. Many
 . experts expect Soviet gas exports to Western Europe to rise to almost
 ? 65 bcm or 20 percent of total consumption this decade as
 Switzerland, Turkey, and Greece become importers. West European
 countries will need substantially more gas supplies to meet demand
 increases expected by 2010.
 EC Keeps Sanctions Against South Africa
 West European leaders yesterday retained their economic bans
 against South Africa but showed support for President de Klerk's
 government in announcing they would begin lifting sanctions when
 'Pretoria undertakes further major reforms. The UK and Portugal had
 urged that the EC immediately end economic restrictions, but Ireland
 indicated it would veto any attempt to Iift sanctions until Pretoria has
 ? made fundamental changes. A draft statement being coordinated
 yesterday promised to increase assistance to South Africa's black
 community and to some 20,000 opposition exiles returning home.
 EC: Developing Soviet Aid Plan
 Despite the EC's decision at the Dublin summit to hold off on a
 large aid commitment to the USSR, the West Europeans probably
 will argue at the Houston summit for a joint Western plan to help the
 Soviet economy. The EC summit deferred action on a proposed
 immediate $ I S billion assistance package but agreed to have the EC
 Commission  re are a re on b October on Soviet needs and on aid
 options.                      EC members have agreed in
 principle to provide aid but are debating what conditions to attach.
 Comment: Although the EC decision has reduced the chance of
 confrontation at Houston over Soviet aid, Bonn, Paris, and Rome
 are likely to press for transferring sponsorship of the EC study to the
 G-24 countries. Italian Foreign Minister De Michelis believes that
 US and EC participation are necessary to prevent the creation of a
 special German-Soviet relationship built in part on West Germany's
 recent $3 billion export credit guarantee to the USSR. Further sharp
 deterioration in the Soviet economy, which the French and Germans
 believe possible in the next several months, could spur the Europeans
 to press ahead with their own aid
 other G-24 nations to participate.
 As many as 20 people have died and some 150 have been injured in
 rioting that began in Lusaka on Monday after the price of cornmeal,
 the staple of the Zambian diet, was doubled. President Kaunda
 yesterday called an emergency cabinet meeting as violence and
 looting continued. Military and police forces are on alert throughout
 the country, especially in the volatile Copperbelt region, which
 produces 93 percent of 7rambia's foreign exchange earnings through
 Comment: Kaunda almost certainly is reluctant to reduce or rescind
 price increases, a key component of an economic reform program
 he hopes will lead to amuch-needed IMF loan and other outside
 assistance. He broke with the IMF in 1986, after price increases led
 to riots in the Copperbelt. If violence continues, Kaunda may back
 down again to retain public support. In response to sharp popular
 criticism of his single-party rule, he is waging a heavyhanded
 campaign to intimidate proponents of multiparty democracy; he has
 called for a referendum on the issue later this year.

 Special Analysis
 CHINA:         R'aiting for Sanctions To Fall
 The decision to release dissident Fang Lizhi was hard for China's
 leaders, who see him as one of their anost dangerous opponents; the}~
 almost certainly believe the gesture will lead to s s erasion   the
 economic sanctions impostd ox China last lWne.
 China's central authorities last week told senior Communist Party
 members that Fang's release would help repair relations with the
 West, according to a Hong Kong press report. Beijing probably
 believed it was making only marginal headway in ending Western
 sanctions and needed to provide Japan a rationale for pressing at the
 Group of Seven summit in Houston next month for relaxation of
 restrictions on lending to China. Beijing also hopes the release will set
 a positive tone for Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji's tour of the US next
 month; he is the first prominent Chinese official to visit the US since
 the Tiananmen Square crackdown..
 Japan's swift, generally positive reaction to Fang's release no doubt
 will gratify China's leaders; much of their effort to break Western
 sanctions has focused on Japan. Prime Minister Kaifu on Monday
 welcomed the decision, and Foreign Minister Nakayama said it
 established an extremely favorable environment for Japan to
 persuade the G-7, to agree to new lending to China.
 Beijing views resumption of World Bank lending as critical to
 important infrastructure projects it cannot easily finance itself
 because of its budget deficit, a record $7,8 billion ]ast year. In
 particular, China wants to move ahead with large-scale construction
 projects to ease energy and transportation bottlenecks
 China's leaders probably are worried Fang's departure for the West
 might revitalize the overseas dissident comrnunit  which has been
 divided and ineffective.
 A Hong Kong newspaper alleges the decision to
 release Fang was made by Deng Xiaoping with the support of General
 Secretary Jiang Zemin and Politburo member Li Ruihuan. Premier
 Li Peng, Vice President Wang Zhen, and Army political commissar
 Yang Baibing reportedly resisted. The lack of major disturbances in
 China on 4 June, the anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, may
 have convinced the hardliners this risk was acceptable. Beijing
 probably will continue to try to improve foreign relations, but it
 remains concerned about internal security and is unlikely to alter
 its human rights policies fundamentally.

 Views of Soviet Leaders on Speed of Market Reforms
 The delay in moving toward a regulated market economy is likely to highlight splits in the
 leadership over how quickly to proceed. It will create opportunities for President Gorbachev
 to retake the initiative and put pressure on Premier Ryzhkov's government to accept more
 radical concepts.
 Gorbachev endorsed an accelerated transition to a regulated market economy at the Russiar_
 Communist Party conference last Tuesday, but so far he has avoided using his presidential
 powers in favor of trying to build consensus. The presidential decrees he issues will indicate
 his willingness to take political risks in order to speed reform.
 Ryzhkov has said publicly that, while there is no turning back to command-administrative
 methods, the country must not rush headlong into a market economy. Recent calls for his
 removal and the legislature's remand of his program are putting intense pressure on him to
 move faster.
 State Planning Committee Chairman Maslyukov recently predicted his organization's future
 would be as a scaled-back regulatory agency like Japan's Ministry of International Trade
 and Industry. Maslyukov, a cautious reformer in the Ryzhkov mold, apparently is trying to
 portray himself as a progressive reformer. In addition to heading the commission overseeing
 revisions to the Ryzhkov program, he was the key economic ofhcial at the Washington
 summit and is rumored to be a possible successor to Ryzhkov.
 Communist party secretary Ligachev in Monday's Pravda called for the public to choose
 between socialism and capitalism in a national referendum. Ligachev, who favors retaining
 public ownership of the means of production, has seized on the referendum as a tactic to
 undercut Gorbachev's policies and slow reform.
 Special Analysis
 USSR:        Legislative DelAy Lestves Economy Hanging        '
 The Supreme Soviet's recent decision to remand the government's
 package of tconomic reforms and price increases shows a desire to move
 more quickly toward a market system and avoid responsibility jar
 measures requiring consumer saerifsces. The package was seriously
 flawed, and the economy may ultimately benefit If the government heeds
 the Supremt Soviet's cal! jar bolder action. The failure to enact retail
 price increases, however, denies the government a potentially powerful
 tool for stabilizing consumer markers and reducing the budget deficit.
 Until stronger action is taken, public rencertainty and apprehension of
 future hardships will dampen work incentives and contribrrtc to arowinp
 The Supreme Soviet gave the government until September to prepare
 a detailed plan for developing markets and competition and
 postponed a decision on bread prices until then.
 The legislature's resolution may yield a stronger program. It urged
 Gorbachev and the Council of Ministers to issue decrees encouraging
 private economic initiatives, promoting alternatives to state
 ownership, developing the banking system, breaking up monopolies,.
 Lost Opportunities
 By itself, the failure to raise bread prices leaves the economy no worse
 off because the government proposed to fully compensate consumers
 for the increases, offsetting any savings achieved by reducing
 subsidies. Nevertheless, the failure to enact consumer price increases
 represents a lost opportunity with potentially high costs. Rapid
 growth in the public's money incomes is an important cause of
 instability in consumer markets. Price increases not offset by
 compensation would soak up substantial excess purchasing power
 and hetp reduce the budget deficit, a source of inflationary pressure.
 The Supreme Soviet has called on the government to reduce the
 deficit but has called for cuts only in investment, defense spending,
 and other outlays that do not directly affect consumers.
 Next Steps
 The Supreme Soviet's decision presses the government and
 Gorbachev harder to implement an effective reform program soon.

 'the government has set up a commission on a regulated market
 economy to coordinate its response. The commission, headed by
 Deputy Premier Maslyukov, will include economists and enternrisc
 managers and will consult with republic Supreme Soviets.
 Gorbachev's willingness to use his presidential powers could be
 critical to speeding the reform process. Possible decrees raising retail
 prices or encouraging private entrepreneurs would aggravate growing
 social unrest and entail substantial political risks. Other measures,
 such. as breaking up large enterprises or dismantling ministries, could
 controversial with the public.
