			  	[Text]    	Prime  Minister  Ohira's  administration  is  going  all\out  to  prepare			    	;
			  	fox  the  general  election  on  7  October.    	The  general  public  may  not  under-			    	~
			  	stand  the  reason  for  declaring  the  dissolution  and  general  election,  but			     	~
			  	Ohira  and  his  faction  have  a  clear  purpose,  which  is  to  increase  its  strength		    	;
			  	so  as  to  achieve  a  decisive  victory  again  in  the  presidential  election  of		,		    	~
			  	the  Liberal  Democratic  Party   	[LDP]  next  year.    	Understandalily,   	the  other			     	(
		-		 	factions  will  wage  an  all-out  struggle  to  retain  their  strength.    	Indica-	     	~	     	~
			  	tions  point  to  a  low  level  election  with  in-fighting  within  the  conserva-			    	~

			  	"Presidential  election  based  on  factionalism  has  become  a  big  issue.    	The			    	j
			  	number  of  new  candidates  desirous  of  running  under  the  Ohira  faction  banner			 	I
			  	is  so  great  that  all  of  them  cannot  be  accepted.    	A  weeding-out  program					i
			  	has  been  established  and  candidates  are  being  carefully  selected,  but...",
			  	so  said  Yoshitake  Sasaki,  a  leading  member  of  the  Ohira  faction  and  LDP's
			  	first  deputy  secretary  general.    	From  his  breast  pocket,  he  took  out  a
			  	memo  pad  that.contained  the  names  of  the  21  "key  candidates"  being  con-
			  	sidered  as  new  candidates.    	It  included  their  addresses  and  election  cam-
			  	paign  office  telephone  numbers.    	Small  cryptic  notes  which  could  not  be
			  	deciphered  were  scribbled  extensively  throughout  the  pad.
			  	The  weeding-out  program  first  considers,  as  the  general  political  practice,
			  	wh~ether  a  clash  exists  in  an  electoral  district  between  an  incumbent  seeking
		-		  	reelection  and  a  former  Diet  member  who  is  trying  to  make  a  comeback,   	and
			  	secondly,  whether  the  aspirant  will  support  Ohira's  reelection  in  the
			  	party's  presidential  election  next  year.    	A  victim  of  this  careful  screening
			  	who  was  d~nied  endorsement  by  the  Ohira  faction  is  Hakuo  Yanagizawa  from			     	;
		_		  	the  Sh~zuoka  prefectural  third  electoral  district.    	Yanagizawa  was  a
			   	former  official  of  the  Finance  MinisCry  and  later  served  as  the  private
			   	secretary  of  Chief  Cabinet  Secretary  Rokusuke  Tanaka,  who  had  encouraged
			  	his  candidacy,   	thereby  leading  everyone  to  believe  that  Yanagizawa
			  	belonged  to  the  Ohira  faction.    	Yanagizawa  himself  assumed  this.    	However,
			  	hailing  from  tha  same  electoral  district  are  Atsuro  Adachi  of  the  Tanaka

			  	faction  and  Kazuo  Shioya  of  the  Miki  faction.    	Both  men,   	from  different
			  	factions,   	are  pro-Ohira.    	"Yanagizawa  cannot  be  endorsed  by  the  Ohira
			  	faction  because  the  two  incumbents  would  be  in  a  pinch,"  defended  Sasaki.
			  	Former  Prime  Minister  Kakuei  Tanaka,  Prime  Minister  Ohira's  ally,   	once
			  	remarked:    	"In  gaining  one  ally,   	if  two  or  three  enemies  are  created  in
			  	the  sam.e  electoral  district  it  is  a  loss."											   	,
			  	Tanaka  is  very  sensitive  about  protecting  new  candidates  of  his  faction.
	  	_			The  su~~?e  belief  is  held  by  Qhira,  who  is  hoping  for  a  stable  hold  within
			   	the  party.
			   	On  the  other  hand,   	the  case  of  Jiro  Kawasaki  of  the  Mie  Prefecture's						'
			   	first  electoral  district  is  considered  unusual.    	Because  his   	father					 	~
			   	Hideji,  who  died  during  his  incumbency,  was  a  member  of  the  Nakasone						:
			   	faction,  he  too  was  considered  to  be  with  Nakasonc.    	'"his  past  spring,
			   	when  Hideji's  first  memorial  service  was  hpld  at  the  New  Otani  Hotel  in
			   	Tc~kyo,  his  presence  with  the  Nakasone  faction  led  others  to  remarlt  that				  	_
			   	the  occasion  was  a  full-strength  attendance  of  the  Nakasone  faction.						,
			   	tlowever,   	the  Sasaki  memo  notes  he  is  as  an  Ohira  faction  member.    	Sasaki
			   	states:		There  is  a  Dietman  who  serves  as  his  father's  successor,  and				  	;
			   	he  is  slated  to  move  into  our  camp."    	In  his  home  district,  Kenji  Maide,					;
			   	who  for  22  years  served  loyally  as   	the  elder  Kawasaki's  private  secretary,			   	~
			   	managing  the  affairs  of  his  constituency,  remarked:    	"The  move  to  ~oin				  	`
			    	the  Ohira  faction  is  not  final  yet."    	He  described  the  latest  developments			  	~
			    	in  the  following  manner:															     	!
	  	-		 	"Dietman  Hajime  Tamura  of  the  Tanaka  faction  from  the  neighboring  Mie				    	;
			    	Prefecture  second  electoral  district  has  bQen  continuously  giving  b,is  full			  	~
	  	-		 	support.    	At  first,   	the  Nakasone  faction  made  the  overture  by  offering				  	;
			    	to  look  after  our  needs,  but  Tamura  intervened  and  thwarted  the  attempt.			     	~
			    	In  the  final  analysis,  it  was  decided  that  we  remain  factionless  until				  	!
			    	the  election  and  then  to  reconsider  when  elected.    	To  date,  we  have  not
			    	received  any  financial  support  from  Zenko  Suzulti,  one  of  the  top  offi-				  	~
	  	-		  	cials  of  the  Ohira  faction,  and  Tamura  has  not  given  instruction  that  we			     	:
			    	should  join  the  Ohira  faction."															~
			    	The  Ohira  faction  does  not  need  to  deal  directly  with  Kawasaki,   	for  it				  	~
			    	appears  that  through  the  already  firmly  established  relationship  existing
			    	with  Tamura,   	the  promising  young  man  is  already  in  their  clutch.    	In  any				.     	~
			    	election,   	the  faction  of  the  incumbent  president  expands  its  inf luence.				 	,
			    	He  controls  the  party's  executive  section,  which  gives  official  endorse-			     	:
			    	ment  as  LDP  member  and  has  large  political.funds.    	The  Miki  and  Fukuda				  	,
			    	cabin~ts,   	that  followed  Tanaka's  pay-off  scandal,   	could  not  establish				   	'
			     	their  own  party's  executive  group;  but,  upon  gaining  the  presidency,
			    	Prime  Minister  Ohira  forcefully  overcame  the  opposition  of  other  =actions
	 	-		  	to  name  Kuniyoshi  Saito  as  his  secretary-general  and  his  confidant,
			    	Masayoshi  Ito,  as  chairman  of  the  finance  committee  which  controls  the
			     	party's  funds.    	All  this  happened  after  Tanaka's  regime.

	    	-		  	Tanaka  Faction  Is  Capitalizing  on  Ohira  Faction's  Successes
				 	The  following  can  be  interpreted  as  bein~  said  out  of  envy  or  ~ealousy.					~
				 	In  April  of  this  year,   	immediately  after  the  consolidated  prefectural				  	~
				 	elections,  an  LDP  Diet  legislator  is  said  to  have  remarlced:    	"The					  	'
				 	party  headquarters  collected  several  billion  yen  for  use  in  the  p,ref~ctural		     	;
				 	elections,  yet,  half  of   	the  sum  was  stashed  away.    	The  general  election			     	'
					.will  b2  held  soon."																     	~
																									   	i
				 	Although  the  election  date  of  7  October  is  about  to  be  confirmed,   	leaders			  	,
				 	of   	the  Ohira  faction  are  saying,   	jwith  tongue  in  cheekJ,   	"Without  election			 	;
				 	funds,  how  can  we  dissolve  the  Diet?"    	Prime  Minister  Ohira's  predecessor,			 	~
				 	Takeo  Fukuda,   	called  for  dissolution  and  the  election,  but  he  could  not			     	'
				 	accomplish  his  aim  ~of  being  elected  party  president.]    	One  reason  for				 	~
				 	his  failure  is  attributable  to  the  damaging  reference  to  the  depletion  of			  	i
				 	party  funds  made  by  the  then  Secretary-General  Ohira,  who  was  against				  	~
				 	dissolution  at  that  time.    	Ohira,  who  won  the  presidency,   	insisted  on
				 	forming  his  own  executive  group  because  he  was  fully  aware  of  the  inner			     	i
				 	workings  of  the  party.
				 	Political  commentator  Kiyoshi  Ii~ima  has  said:    	"The  Ohira  faction's				    	'
				 	Kochi  Club  is  comparable  to  a  stock  company  while  the  rest  of  the  factions				~
				 	are  single  proprietorship  shops.    	Since  former  Prime  Minister  Hayato				   	I
				  	Ikeda,  personalities  have  been  recruited  from  the  financial  world  and  the			  	~
				 	mainstream  of   	the  Finance  Ministry  and,   	even  if  the  head  of  the  state  is			   	i
				 	not  Ohira,   	the  organization  is  designed  to  draw  personalities  and  money.			    	~
				  	This  arrangement  may  be  weak  in  a  political  turmoil,  but  once  the  gears'			   	II
				  	of  the  organization  start  moving,  power  emanates."										'
				  	Closely  allied  to  the  Ohira  faction,  which  recruited  personalities  from			     	,
				  	the  major  companies  of  the  financial  world  since  the  days  of  ex-Prime				  	~
				  	Minister  Hayato  Ikeda,   	is  the  Suehiro  Club,   	led  by  President  Yoshihiro					,
				  	Inayama  of  the  New  Japan  Steel  Corporation.    	On  18  August  of  this  year
				  	the  club  mcmb~rs  gathered  at  Karuizawa  where  Prime  Minister  Ohira  was
				  	resting.    	Members  golfed  at  the  Dai  Asama  Country  Club,  which  is  owned
				  	by  the  Mitsui  conglomerate.    	At  night,  non-golfers  Mrs  Mitsuie  Ikeda,  widow
				  	of  ex-Frime  Minister  Hayato  Ikeda,   	Shigesaburo  Maeo,  who  is  supposedly  at
				  	odds  with  the  prime  minister  and  who  was  formerly  presiden.t  of  the  Kochi
				  	Club,  and  others  dined  together.    	Naturally,  joining  them  were  such
				  	personalities  from  the  financial  world  as:    	Hideo  Edo,   	chairman  of  the
				  	Board  of  Mitsui  Real  Estate  Co.,  Ltd.;  Rokuro  Ishikawa,  president  of  the
				  	Kajima  Construction  Co.,  Ltd.;   	and  Masaichi  Nishikawa,   	consultant  of
				  	Nissho  Iwai  Co.,  Ltd.,   	and  others.
				  	The  fact  that  new  candidates  are  seeking  membership  in  the  Ohira  faction
				  	is  probably  because  the  Tanaka  faction  has  lost  the  power  it  once  had.
				  	An  increasing  number  of  new  candidates  depend  on  the  Tanaka  clan  for
				  	campaign  activities  but  publicly  identify  themselves  with  the  Ohira
				  	faction.    	Linkage  with  the  LDP  president's  faction  has  its  advantages,

				  	and  the  Ohira  political  regime  might  possibly  be  a  long  Cerm  one.    	In
				  	proclaiming    	a  new  brand  of  politics,"  the  "Tanaka01  faction  is  not
				  	quite  appropos.    	However,   	ths  Tanaka  faction  has   	the  best  know-how  to
	    	'		   	run  election  campaigns  and  therefore  should  not  be  evaded.    	This  is  how			  	_
				  	the  new  candidates  view  the  situation.
				  	According  to  Ohira  and  Tanaka  factions,   	Sadatoshi  Kosato  of  the  Kagoshima
	    	-		    	prefectural  second  electoral  district,  Mc~toji  I~ondo  of  the  Niigata  prefec-
				  	tural  first  electoral  district  and  Kiyoshi  Ozawa  of  the  Tokyo  seventh
				  	electoral  district  fall  into   	this  category.    	The  matter  of  their  affilia-
				  	tion  has  already  been  discussed  by  the  leaders  of  both  factions  and  they
				  	are  counted  on  as  "candidates  from  the  ~oint  Ohira-Tanaka  factions"  or
				  	"waist-up  Ohira  factxon"  and  "waist-down  Tanaka  faction."
				  	A  typical  case  is  Kosuke  Hori,   	son  of  the  late  Shigeru  Hori,  who  was
				  	formerly  the  chairman  of  the  House  of  Representatives.    	Kosuke  Hori  is
				  	being  groomed  to  be  his  father's  successor  from  the  Saga  prefectural  dis-
				  	trict.    	Supporting  Kosuke  in  his  election  campaign  is  his  father's  close
				  	friend,   	Shin  Kanemaru  of   	the  Tanaka  faction,  who  singlehandedly  took
				  	over  Kosuke's  fund-raising  party  and  sold  3,000  tickets.    	On  the  22d,
				  	Kanemaru  went  with  Welfare  Minister  Ryutaro  Hashimoto  of  the  Tanaka
				  	faction  to  Saga  Prefecture  and  at  the  rally  said:    	"If  I  cannot  get
	     	~		    	Kosuke  elected,   	then  I'd  be  ashamed  to  visit  Hori's  grave.    	I  have  my
				   	campaigning  to  do  in  Yamanashi  Prefecture,  but  I'll  be  in  Saga  for  10
				   	days."    	From  the  Saga  prefectural  district,   	incumbent  Kenichiro  Otsubo					~
				   	of   	the  Ol~ira  faction  will  also  be  campaigning  for  reelection;  but,  since
				   	the  constituencies  do  not  conflict,   	an  understanding  was  easily  reached			    	_
				  	between  th~  Ohira  and  Tanaka  factions  that  the  Ohira  faction  will  furnish
				   	young  Hori's  campaign  funds.
				   	A  similar  case  is  that  of  Motoji  Kondo  whose  office  issued  this  statement:
				   	"An  understanding  has  been  reached  between  Kakuei  Tanaka  and  Yrime
				   	Minister  Ohira  that  Kondo  will  be  identified  with  the  Ohira  faction  but
				   	will  be  cared  for  by  the  Tanaka  faction.    	According  to  Kondo's  office,
				  	.leaders  of  the  Tanaka  faction  will  pazticipate  in  the  general  rally  on
				   	the  31st  and  members  of   	the  Kochi  Club  have  expressed  their  availability
				   	to  assist  if  necessary."															  	!
				   	Thus,   	there  is  no  conflict.    	There  is  hardly  any  troub le  between  the
				   	Ohira  and  Tanaka  factions  concerning  new  candidates.    	With  the  Ohira
				   	faction  furnishing  "hardware,"  such  as  funds  and  campaign  preparations,
				   	and  the  Tanaka  faction  providing  "software"  by  way  of  overseeing  the				  	~
				   	campaign  techniques,   	the  e.lection  machinery  gears  are  in  mesh  and  the    	~
				   	strength  of  rhe  main  force  is  progressing  steadily.
				   	Kawamoto  Faction  Accepts  All  Comers  in  Order  to  Expand
				   	By  contrast,   	the  Fukuda  faction  is  trying  to  maintain  the  status  quo  while
				    	the  Nakasone  faction  is  on  the  defensive.

				  	Commentator  Kiyoshi  Iijima  states:    	The  Nakasone  faction  is  especially					;

				   	the  other  hand,   	eight  or  nri;ne  incumbents  appear  vulnerable.    	In  the  past			    	;
				   	tw~  general  ~lections,   	the  Nakasone  faction  increased  their  nuaiber  of				  	t
				  	new  Dietmen  and  gained  momentum,  b ut  in  this  comi~g  election,  a  slump				  	~
				   	is  anticipated.																	     	I

				  	Last  month,   	Nakasone  himself  returned  to  his  constituency,   	the  Gumma				   	~
				  	Prefecture's  third  electoral  di:ctrict,   	for  a  long  stay.    	This  is  con-				  	~
				  	sidered  unusual  �or  a  leader  of  a  faction.    	It  is  said  that  he  even  attended		   	~
				  	small  group  meetings  to  devote  himself  to  election  activities.						 	~
				   	"Although  it  appears  there  is  no  change  in  his  attitude  of  aspiring  to					)
				  	become  the  head  of  the  next  government,   	it  seems  that  he  has  lost  some					~
				   	of  his  .fervor."																	    	i
				   	Among  the  new  candidates,  Kawasaki,  who  belonged  to  the  Nakasone  faction,			  	,
				  	has  joined  the  Ohira  faction,  and  problems  have  been  encountered  in				    	'
				   	selecting  a  successor  to  former  Dietman  Taro  Otake  of   	the  Nakasone  faction
				   	from  the  Niigata  Prefecture's  four�th  electoral  district.    	The  person				   	,
				   	selected  by  the  booster  club  has  refused  to  enter  the  race  and  his  replace-
				   	ment,   	Katsuhiko  Shirakawa,  has  opted  to  join  the  Ohira  faction.    	The
				   	Nakasone  faction  cannot  recover  l~st  ground.
				   	In  the  midst  of  the  established  hig  factions  which  are  strengthening		  	;
				   	their  positions,  Toshio  Kawamoto  (chairman  of  the  party's  Policy  Research
				   	Committee)   	of   	the  Miki  faction  and  Ichiro  Nakagawa  (former  ~cf~inister  of
				   	agriculture  and  forestry),  who  organized  the  Liberal  Reform  Associates
				   	Club  are  conspicuous  in  their  activities  to  establish  new  power  groups.
				   	Kawamoto  holds  one  of  the  three  key  party  posts  and,  as  successor  to  the
				   	Miki  faction,   	shows  definite  intention  to  take  over  after  the  Ohira  regime.	  	'
				   	Said  he  determinedly:    	"As  a  holder  of  one  of  the  party's  key  posts,  I
				   	will  go  whereever  the  party  directs.    	As  for  the  presidential  election
	    	-		    	next  year,   	I  cannot  comment  until  the  election  rules  are  revised.    	We  of
				   	the  M3ki  fact':on  will  go  all  out  in  seeking  the  elec'tion  of  the  incumbents,
				   	the  four  formi,fr  legislators  making  a  comeback  and  the  10  new  candidates.
				   	As  usual,  he  is  full  of  enthusiasm  and  does  not  speculate.    	Friends  around
				   	him  report  that  th~re.:-is~~.~re  than  meets  the  eye.    	Kyoichi  Noro,  who
				   	has  been  flatly  st :':;ing  :*_liat  Kawamoto  will  be  the  next  party  president,
				   	comments:    	"Kawamoto,  himself,  has  clearly  shown  his  interest  in  the
				   	positions  of  party  president  and  prime  minister.    	He  shows   	tremendous

				     	Among  the  new  candidates  claimed  by  Kawamoto  faction  as  belonging  to
				     	his  faction  are  some  being  wooed  by  the  Ohira  and  Fukuda  factions.    	These			   	.
				     	new  candidates  are  noncommittal  about  their  factional  affiliations  and				 	~
				     	place  priority  on  organizing  their  awn  bo~ster  clubs.    	Candidate  Iwao
				     	Kudo,   	former  mayor  of  Morioka  city  from  the  Iwate  prefectural  first
				     	electoral  district,  has  linked  himself  with  several  factions.    	Noro  has

				     	efforts  are  being  exerted  to  elect  those  who  favor  the  Kawamoto  faction.			    	;
				     	In  the  presidential  election  held  last  year,  second  to  Kawamoto's  con-				 	~
				     	stituency  of  Hyogo  Prefecture  was  Nagasaki  Prefecture,   	and  Kawamoto  has
				     	entered  new  ~andidates  in  the  first  and  second  electoral  districts.    	In
						the  second  district,  Kuro  P4atsuda  of  the  Kawamoto  faction  caused  an
				     	uproar  by  almost  defeating  two  incumbent  cabinet  members,  Ji.nkichi
						Shirahama,  minister  of  posts  and  telecommunications,   	and  Iwazo  Kaneko,

				    	In  all  likelihood,   	there  will  be  moves  for  the  formation  of  a  Nakagawa					~

				    	occur.    	Because  of  such  talk,   	there  is  nothing  definite  as  to  when  the					i
				    	Nakagawa  faction  will  be  formed.    	rlakagawa  would  like  to  have  five  or				  	I
				    	six  of  his  new  candidates  elected  and  to  have  a  total  following  of  20

				     	factions,  at  least  the  public  would  make  reference  to  a"big  five  factions				~
				    	plus   	the  Nakagawa  faction."    	In  such  a  manner,  his  ambitions  are  being					~
				    	made  known.    	His  so-called  rivals,  Takeshita  and  Abe,   	are  confined  to

					 	NTT  BECOMES  TARGET  OF  U.S.-JAPAN  ELECTRONIC  TECHNOLOGY  WAR
					 	Tokyo  CHUO  KORON  in  Japanese  Jul  79  pp  251-265..
					  	[Article  by  Critic  Masaomi  Ohmae]
					  	[Excerpt]    	Behind  the  negotiations  on  the  opening  of  NTT,   	there  lurks  a
					  	violent  battle  centering  around  electronics  technology  that  will  decide  the
					  	supreme  ruler  of  the  information  era.		   	,
					  	Senator  Frank  Church  set  out  a  solution  that  strives  for  a"renaissance"  of
					  	technology.    	As  chairman  of  the  prestigious  Senate  Foreign  Relations  Commit-
					  	tee,   	he  was  compelled  to  wrestle  first  with  American's  regeneration  rather
					  	than  with  strategies  toward  the  USSR.    	He  calls   	for  striving  for  a  tech-
					  	nology  revival,   	raising  productivity,   	regaining  international  competitive
					  	power,   	increasing  exports,  and  overcoming  inflation  by  means  of  expansion
					  	of  research  and  development  and  plant  and  equipment  investments.
					  	The  technology  debate  has  suddenly  become  lively.    	"'These  clays,   	35mm
					  	cameras  and  color  televisions  are  :~ot  being  produced  in  the  United  States.
					  	Our  country  is  a  world  leader  only  in  computers,   	aerospace  and  advanced
					  	electronics.    	Japan  is  making  extensive  investments  to  overtake  the  United
					  	States  even'in  computers."    	(Ms  Martha  Frangiadachs  of  the  U.S.  Machin~e
					  	Industry  Association).    	"Japan  is  succeeding  in  computers,   	previously  domi-
					  	nated  by  the  United  States,   	and  presently,   	they  are  going  for  the  same  in
					  	aircraft."    	(Robert  Strauss,   	special  trade  representative).
					  	THE  NEW  YORK  TIMES,   	in  an  editorial,  also  deplored  that  the  United  States
					  	is  falling  behin~i  the  remarkable  technology  developmsnt  of  Japan  and  Western
					  	Europe  and  poirited  out  that,   	although  the  number  of  patents  U.S.   	firms   	re-
					  	ceived  from  the  U.S.   	government  from  1971  to  1976  decreased  20  percent,   	the
					  	number  of  patents  foreign  firms  received  from  the  United  States  increased
						-  25  percent  during  that  time.
					  	There  ~s  an  unbelievable  u~ieasiness  in  the  United  States  which  once  boasted
					  	the  world's  most  advanced  technology  in  all  fields  and  defeated  Japan  and
					  	Germany  in  World  War  II  and  became  the  post-war  world  leader  thanks  to   	it.
					  	Now,  when  one  walks  the  streets  of  the  United  States,   	one  cannot  help  but
					  	notice  that  the  best  cameras  the  people  have  are  almost  all  Japanese  made,

				   	of  electrical  communications  equipment,   	in  which  the  United  States  is  be-			   	_
				   	lieved   	to  be  the  leader.    	The  export  volume  of  telephones,   	radios,   	tele-
				   	visions,   	cameras  and  the  like  to  North  America  will  reach  67.1  billion  yen
				   	ir~  JFY  1979.
				   	In  particular,   	it  was  NEC's   	successful  bid  for  SBS   	(Satellite  Business  Sys-
				    	tem)   	earth  stations  that  opened  the  eyes  of  America's  business  circles.
				   	The  SBS  is  a  communications  network  IBM  and  others  had  planned  and  is  a
				    	system  whereby  the  home  office  of  a  firm  transmits  data  via  satellite  to
				    	its  branch  offices  throughout  the  country.    	The  branch  office  receives  the			 	~
				    	signal  via  a  small  earth  station  set  up  in  a  parking  lot  or  the  like.				  	;
				    	Hughes  Aircraft  is  making  the  satellites;  NEC  fought  six  U.S.  manufacturers		     	~
				    	in  the  bidding  for  the  earth  stations.    	In  the  end,  both  NEC  and  Hughes
				    	caere  successful�in  their  bids.    	Each  unit  costs  more  than  500,000  dollars;			 	.
				    	each  company  received  an  order  for  100  units  for  the  first  phase.					  	!
				    	Americ~'s  electronics  industry  circles  were  surprised  at  NEC's  successful
				    	bid,   	especially  since  SBS  received  attention  as  the  enterprise  in  which			     	;
				    	IB::,   	the  computer  company,  was  taking  a  hand  in  communications.    	A.~d  in			     	~
				    	particular,   	the  low  cost  could  not  be  believed.    	Perhaps  expressing  the
				    	i.ndustry's  ~ind,  AEI   	(American  Electronics  Industry  Association)  Vice-				 	;
				    	chairman  Sodolsky,   	on  a  visit  to  Japan,   	ask  an  NTT  executive,   	"Isn't  this			  	;
				    	dumping?    	Wasn't  NEC  able  to  lower  the  price  for  export  because  it  is  sup-
				    	plying  NTT  with  earth  stations?"													   	~
				    	Unfortunately,   	since  Japan  has  no  communication  satellites,   	there  is  no  de-		     	~
				    	mand  for  earth  stations.    	NTT  management  dismissed  the  suspicion  with  a.
				    	laugh.    	The  United  States  is  a  one-man  show  in  satellites.    	On  its  own,			     	'
				    	NEC  started  early  on  development  of  earth  stations,   	and  has  already  risen
				    	to  being  the  top  manufacturet  in  the  world.    	An  SBS  executive  who  visited			  	~
				    	Japan  said,   	in  connection  with  NEC  orders,   	"the  Japanese  technological				 	!
				    	genius   	is  well  known  world-wide"  and  "I  know  full  well  the  high  level  of			    	~
				    	Japan`s  technology  and  the  strength  of  its  competitive  power  from  the				  	~
				    	aspect  of  cost."    	Given  the  explanation  by  this  concerned  party,  perhaps
				    	Japanese  manufacturers  have  strength  in  these  areas.
				    	But,   	it  must  be  an  uneasy  thing  for  the  United  States  is   	trying  to  solve
				     	its  economic  distress  by  a  technology  revival,   	for  Japan  to  have  started  a
				     	"counter-landing"  in  its  own  bailiwick.    	The  United  States  has  to  make  a
				     	"second  landing"  in  Japan.
				     	If  a"second  landing"  in  Japan  is  difficL_t  or  impossible,   	it  would  not  be
				     	strange  if  a  cry  to  shut  out  Japanese  nroducts  is  raised,   	as  it  was  with
				     	the  northern  Minnesota  steel  workers,  as  another  solution.    	That  cry  has
		 	_		    	become  extraordinartly  loud  because  next  year's  presidential  election  has
				     	drawn  nearer.

		     	How  Did  NTT  Enter  the  Picture
		     	In  Washington,   	SANKEI  correspondent  Abe  warned,   	"Watch  out  for  Connally."			   	;
		     	Afterwards,   	correspondent  Abe  sent  a  spine-chilling  report.    	Connally,  who			 	;
		     	seeks  nomination  as  the  Republican  Party's  presidential  candidate,  was
		     	giving  anti-Japan  speeches  in  various  parts  of  the  country  and  evoking  a
  -		   	popul;ar  response.    	At  a  Washington  gathering,  he  violently  attacked  Japan's
				trade  policies,   	saying  that  Japanese  products  ought  to  be  shut  out  from  the				.
		     	United  States  if  Japan  does  not  open  its  market.    	At  that  time,   	"when  a
		     	Japanese  TV  cameraman  engaged  in  covering  events  in  the  assembly  hall
		     	circled  around  behind  Connally  to  bring  the  audience  into  camera  view,   	the
		     	assembly  hall  was  enveloped  in  loud  laughter.    	It  appeared  to  the  Americans
				that  the  Japanese  cameraman  was  trying  to  attack  Connally  from  the  rear  as
		     	he  was  ma.king  his  anti-Japan  charges."
				"At  that  time,  Mr  Connally,   	turning  to  the  rear,   	said  caustically,   	'You
				appeared  ~ust  at  the  right  time.    	If  you  don't  understand  from  my  saying
  '		    	it  once,   	I'll  say  it  many  times,'   	and  there  was  loud  applause  again  in  the
  '		    	assembly  hall."    	(SANKEI,   	26  April)
				Changes  such  as  the  above  in  America  are  the  background  to  Strauss's  strong
				demands  placed  on  Japan  in  the  U.S.-Japan  negotiations  on  opening  NTT,  ~ust
		   	~   	like  Cordell  Hall's  demands  before  Pearl  Harbor.    	In  addition  to  the  general
				tendency  to  take  only  a  short-sighted  look  at  inflation,   	Strauss  himself
				was  too  eager  for  success.
				Perhaps  the  real  reasons  why  he  high-handedly  placed  such  demands  on  Japan
		     	will  not  be  made  public  except  in  the  life  to  come,  but  there  is  no  doubt			  	-
  ,		    	that  he  was  drug  into  it  by  Connally,  who  is  critical  of  the  Carter  admin-
				istration's   	timidity  toward  Japan.    	Both  are  riatives  of  Te:~as  and  former
				attorneys.    	Texans  are.hard-nosed  people  and  are  famous  for  their  love  of
				a  political  fight.    	And  on  those  points,   	they  are  both  second  to  none.
				Moreover,   	Connally  changed  from  the  Democratic  Party  to  the  Republican
				Party,  held  authority  as  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  in  the  Nixon  admin-
				istration,
				On  the  other  hand,   	after  the  1968  presidential  election,   	Strauss  was  called
				to  Washington  from  Texas  in  order  to  rebuild  tY;,~  Democratic  Party  which  had
				fallen  to  pieces;   	he  did  all  he  could  to  rebuild  tihe  Democratic  Party  under
				a  Republican  administration,   	first  as   	the  person  in  charge  of  finance  of
				the  National  Committee  and  later  as  Chairman  of  the  National  Committee,   	its
				highest  executive  officer.    	He  cannot  forgive  Connally  for  betraying  the
				party,   	and  it  is  even  more  difficult  for  him  because  Connally  is  basking			   	,
				'in  the  limelight  as  a  favorite  candidate  of  the  Republican  Party.
				Perhaps  because  of  a  great  shortage  of  talented  men  in  the  Carter  adminis-
				tration,   	Strauss  has  been  given  one  difficult  ~ob  after  another.    	His
				greatest  duty  will  be  to  get  President  Carter  reelected  next  year.    	In					,
				order  to  do  that,  he  had  to  have  the  Tokyo  Round,   	for  which  he  was  respon-
				sible  at   	that  time,   	ratified;   	and,   	in  order  to  do  that,  he  had  to  obtain

									 	FOh  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY										   	'
			  	There  is  no  doubt  that  Strauss  wa~  backed  by  such  influential  manufacturers
			  	as  IBM  and  ITT.    	Although  the  developing  cou.ntries  want  electrical  communi-
			  	cations  networks,   	they  lack  the  ability  to  pay.    	Because  matters  are  not
			  	going  well  between  the  United  States  and  USSR,   	the  eastern  European  market
			  	has  fallen  flat.    	Looking  at  the  domestic  situation,   	the  Japanese  were
			  	playing  havoc  there  too.    	So  naturally,   	they  turned  to  Japan.
			  	The  annual  market  of  NTT,  which  has  a  monopoly  on  Japan's  communications
			  	network,   	is  3  billion  dollars.    	That  is  almost  entirely  domestic  orders.
			  	Foreigners  have  not  tried  to  sell  to  it  in  20  years,  but  if  this  lucrative			 	_
			  	market  should  open  at  this  point  in  time,   	and  if  foreign  manuFacturers  are				:
			  	allowed  to  come  in,   	this  would  be  a  greater  opportunity  than  could  be  asked
			  	for.    	A  characteristic  of  this  kind  of  equipment  is  that,   	once  deliveries
			  	are  made,   	it  is  difficult  to  end  a  contract.    	So,  U.S.  manufacturers  put			    	,
			  	ideas  into  Strauss  and  others  to  securs  a  much  better  deal.    	Finally,   	there
			  	we~re  manufacturers  wh~  pleaded  that  it  be  ~?pened  to  digital  exchanges,   	the				~
			  	most  crucial  portion.
			  	But  it  cannot  be  thought  that  IBM  and  the  like  plotted  to  make  NTT  the
			   	target  from  the  very  beginning.    	First,   	it  was  decided  in  the  Tokyo  Round
			  	negotiations  that  "no  distinction  will  be  made  between  one's  own  country
			   	and  foreign  countries  in  the  products  each  country's  government  purchases."
			  	The  United  States  said  it  would  open  government  procurements  in  an  amount
			   	of  30  hillion  dollars,   	but,  afterwards,   	that  was  lowered  to  12  billion
			   	dollars  through  excluding  the  military,  NASA  and  such.    	The  United  States
			   	urged  Japan  to  open  up  7-8  billion  dollars.										     	i_
			   	However,   	Japan  has  only  about  3  billiun  dollars  controlled  by  the  central			  	'
																								     	i
			   	government.    	The  United  States  said  that  was  quite  out  of  the  question  and

			     	NT'r  rises  above  the  common  in  its  personnel  and  financial  scale  and  in  its
			     	superior  operations  situation.    	It  is  certainly  Japan's  greatest  corpora-
			     	tion.    	Furthermore,   	NTT  raised  Japan,   	ruined  in  the  war,   	up  to  the  world's
			     	second  pl.ace  "telephone  society."    	The  world's  first  is  the  United  States,
			     	of  course.    	It  has  nearly  half  of  the  world's  15S  million  telephones.    	But
			     	Japan  increased  nearly  100  times  from  540,OA0  at  the  time  of  defeat  to  53
			     	million,   	and  has  completed  a  syst~m  of  direct  dial  throughout  the  country~
			     	Concerning  the  quality  of  service,   	Japan's  trouble  rate  is  the  world's
			     	lowest.    	Although  the  monthly  trouble  rate  per  100  telephones  is  2.6  in  the
			     	United  States  and  4.2  in  England,   	it  is  only  0.6  in  Japan.    	There  is  tele-
			     	phone  trouble  only  once  every  13  years  per  telephone  user.
			     	Until  the  question  of  opening  NTT  became  the  focal  point  of  the  U.S.-Japan
			     	negotiations,   	concerned  parties  in  both  Japan  and  the  United  States  had  not
			     	noticed  how  huge  NTT  was.    	Even  we  hardly  knew  it.    	That  was  to  be  expected.
			     	Tha~  is  because  NTT  has  no  "public  image."    	Even  though  a  similar  public
			     	service,   	newspapers  are  delivered  daily  by  a  person,   	and  someone  comes  for
			     	the  fee  at  the  end  of  the  month.    	Gas  and  electric  meters  may  be  outside,
			     	but,   	even  so,   	a  meterman  comes  to  check  them.
			     	However,   	all  telephone  bills  are  recorded  automatically  at  the  telephone
			     	office.    	Charges  are  drawn  against  a  bank.    	All  we  get  is  a  piece  of  paper
			     	that  records  the  total  amount  of  the  charges.    	We  are  not  i.nformed  of  the
			     	details  of  how  much  the  cost  is  because  of  when  and  where  the  call  was
			     	placed.    	If  we  are  late  on  paying  the  charges,   	a  call  demanding  payment
			     	will  come;   	and,   	if  one  does  not  pay,   	a  public  emplo}~ee  will  not  come  to			     	`
			     	seize  the  telephone;   	it  will  be  disconnected  automatically.
			     	Since  telephone  trouble  sel3om  occurs,   	repai.rmen  also  do  not  come.    	The  only
			     	time  one  has  contact  with  an  employee  is  when  the  operator  gives  a  number,
			     	and  this  is  only  a  voice,  no  face  is  shown.    	No  matter  how  much  we  use  the
			     	telephone,  we  know  only  a  cold  telephone.    	There  is  almost  no  human  contact		    	'
			     	with  NTT.
			     	The  reason  there  is  no  human  contact  is  because  the  telephone  is  not  a  human,
			     	but  rather  an  e"lectric  signal.    	Electricity  moves  at  the  speed  of  seven  and
			     	a  half  revolutions  around  the  earth  per  second,  and  is  unevenly  distribueed
	 	_		    	in  our  environment,  but  it  cannot  be  seen.    	It  cannot  be  seen,  but  when  some-
			     	one  dials  a telephone,  the  desired  number  is  selected  almost  in  a  split
			     	second  from  53  million  numbers,   	the  charge  is  computed,  practically  any-
			     	thing  and~everything  is  done.    	The  320,000  employees  are  just  too  many.
			     	There  are  not  telephone  strikes  since  the  labor  union  cannot  touch  the
			     	mach~nes.    	Because  Japan  National  Railways  does  go  on  strike,  both  those
			     	who  use  Japan  National  Railways  and  those  who  do  not  cannot  help  but  be
			     	aware  of  Japan  National  Railways'   	existence.    	But  since  there  is  no  tele-
			     	phone  strike,   	the~existence  of  NTT  is  more  and  more  forgotten.

			     	On  the  other  hand,   	instead  of  being  opposed,   	telephone  installation  is  wel-
			     	comed  everywhere.    	Cities,   	towns  and  villages  cooperate  in  the  opening  of			   	i

			     	where,   	the  "unsociable"   	telephone  office  building  stands  in  the  best  part			   	~
					of  the  business  section.    	That  is  b~cause  the  telephone  is  a  clean  elec-
					tricity  that  does  not  bring  pollution   	(except  harassment).    	Thus,  before
	   	~		  	one  was  aware  of  it,   	the  entire  country  was  connected  with  direct  dial				 	~
					telephones  which  must  be  called  the  "shinkar.sen"  of  electricity.
					But,   	since  the  existence  of  an  organization  becomes  known  only  through				 	'
					negative  news  in  this  modern  mass  communication  society,   	almost  no  one
					realized  that  NTT  was  so  large  an3  so  prosperous.
					NTT's  Technology  Development
					It  is  all  the  more  strange  that  it  reached  this  technology  level.    	After
					the  defeat,  when  Japan  fell  to  being  the  "fourth  rate  power"  MacArthur
					called  it,  Japan  squandered  its  meager  foreign  reserves,   	on  par  with  an
					underdeveloped  country,   	in  its  telephone  enterprise,   	and,   	along  with  bring-
					ing  in  microwave  equipment  and  exchanges  from  England  and  West  Germany,
					it  continued  to  make  visits  to  its  mentor  Bell  Laboratories  of  America's
					AT&T.
					But  that  was  not  in  order  to  Y,ecome  a"telephone  colony"  of  the  advanced
					nations,  but  rather,   	in  order  to  develop  its  own  technology  by  using  ad-
					vanced  technology  as  the  stimulus  material.    	Making  their  motto,   	"Tech-
					riology  is  power,    	they  put  about  2  percent  of  the  annual  budget  into  re-
				 	search  and  development  expenditures.    	Top  engineers  were  given  special
				 	laboratories  named  after  themselves,   	and  efforts  were  made  to  catch  up
					with  and  surpass  the  United  States  and  Europe.
				 	According  to  what  NTT's  engineers  proudly  state,   	the  result  was  that
				 	Japan's  technology  became  equal  to  that  of  Western  Europe  in  the  first
				 	ha.lf  of  the  1960's,   	and  reached  the  same  level  as  the  United  States  about			 	,
				 	1970.    	It  is  equal  with  the  United  States  in  switching  equipment  and  has
				 	outdistanced  the  United  5tates  in  transmission  equipment.    	As  for  micro-
				 	wave  analog,   	although  1,700  circuits  can  be  handled  per  wave  in  the  United
				 	States,   	3,600  can  now  be  handled  in  Japan.
				 	In  digital  transmission  technology,   	although  it  is  267  megabits  in  the
				 	United  States,   	it  is  400  megabits  in  Japan.    	Microwave  was  10  years  behind

			    	Somehow  it  seems  that  a  distinctive  feature  of  Japan  is  to  make  prompt				 	~
			    	practical  application  of  an  original  idea  from  elsewhere.    	An  example  of			    	.
			    	that  can  be  seen  when  one  visits  NTT's  spectacular  electrical  communica-
			    	tion  laboratory  at  Musashino  inside  Tokyo.    	The  world's  largest  laboratory
			    	is  AT&T's  Bell  Laooratories  with  17,000  employees,  but  Japan  is  second
			    	with  3,300  employees  in  the  three  laboratories  of  Musashino-shi,  Yokosuka-
			    	shi  and  Tokai-mura  in  Ibaraki  Prefecture.
			    	There  is  an  LSI  design  room  in  the  Musashino  Laboratory.    	The  LSI  researched
			    	there  have  been  put  to  practical  use;   	calculators  as  thin  as  a  card  inun-
			    	date  the  streets  and  The  Invaders   	[game]   	is  now  enjoyed.
			    	There  is  a  magnetic  bubble  memory  device.    	This  is  something  the  Bell				    	_
			    	Laboratories  conceived  but  NTT's  laboratories  made  prompt  practical  appli-
			    	cation.  of  it  and  surprised  Bell  Laboratories  personnel  who  came  to  visit.
			    	It  is  the  same  with  optical  fiber  communication.    	This  is  a  method  of  send-
			    	ing  a  signal  by  passing  optical  energy,   	changed  from  electricity,  via  glass
			    	fibers  as  thin  as  150  microns  in  diameter.    	This  was  also  conceived  first
			    	by  the  United  States,  but  now  Japan  has  advanced  fLrther  and  has  already
			    	succeeded  in  a  20  kilometer  field  test.    	A  test  for  practical  use  is  ex-
			    	pected  2  to  3  years  from  now.    	Likewise,   	the  visiting  Bell  Laboratories
			    	staff  looked  on  with  envy.
			    	We.ll  th~n,   	in  which  field  is  Japan  behind  the  United  States?    	NTT's  engi-			   	_
			    	neers  candidly  admit  it  is  in  large-scale  computers,   	software,   	commur_ica-			   	!

				    	fYOm  the  words  of  the  NTT  engineers  with  whom  I  have  spoken.    	Unmistakably,
				    	that  was  one  of  the  motivations  that  thrust  NTT's  technology  to  the  world's
				   	highest  ].evel.
				   	Nex~,,   	there  is  perfectionism  which  aims  at  perfection  at  all  costs.    	There			 	~
				    	is  a  special  room  for  carrying  out  LSI  durability  tests  at  the  Musashino
				   	LaUoratory.    	Here,   	they  put  10,000  LSI  into  a  refrigerator-like  box,   	turn
				    	on  the  electric  current  and  test  for  trouble  for  a  period  of  one  year.    	It
				    	is  said  that  a  durability  test  on  submarine  cabl.es  continues  for  2  years.
				   	NTT's  perfectionism  makes  it  try  to  lower  the  trouble  level  to  the  lowest
				    	degree.
				    	The  previously  mentioned  optical  fiber  is  a  delicate  fiber  extruded  from  a			 	~
				    	mass  of  glass  as  the  basic  material.    	The  laboratory  is  also  making  the			     	'
				    	basic  material.    	In  a  word,   	the  laboratory  has  become  a  glass  manufacturing		     	;
				    	factory  and  will  not  entrust  it  to  subcontracts.    	This  brings  to  mind  that			 	i
				    	the  Japanese  navy  consistently  built  its  ships,   	such  as  the  Musashi  and
				    	Yamoto,   	at  its  own  naval  shipyards.												     	;
				    	Perfectionism  affects  the  subcontract  manufacturers.    	NTT  makes  an  inspec-			 	~
				    	tion  visit  to  its  subcontract  factories  at  the  time  it  places  orders,   	and			  	~
				    	makes  a  close  inspection.    	For  example,  when  it  orders  polyethylene  wrapped		     	;
				    	wires,   	it  specifies  even  the  raw  materials  of  the  polyethylene.    	It  has  a			  	~
				    	reputation  throughout  the  world  for  such  strictness.    	NTT  officials  boast
				    	that  the  quality  of  telephone  service  is  guaranteed  to  be  the  world's				  	;
				    	most  trouble-free  on  account  of  this  kind  of  strictness.
				    	Well,   	thi.s  kind  of  perfectionisni  uses  only  specific  manufact~:rers--a  manu-
				    	facturer  who  meets  NTT's  strict  requirements  has  a  superior  technology,
				    	works  together  actively,   	promotes  mutual  understanding,   	embraces  their					.
				    	mission  and  has  a  sense  of  being  a  community  bound  by  common  fate.    	For
				    	key  products,   	the  manufacturers  who  possess  such  qualifications  are  limited,
			_		   	of  course.    	They  are  Fujitsu,  Ltd.,  NEC,  Hitachi,  Lt3.,   	and  Oki  Electric
				    	Industry  Co.,  Ltd.    	It  is  absurd  to  give  an  order  by  means  of  competitive
				    	bids  to  a  subcontractor  af  dubious  origin.
				    	A  manufacturer  has  to  be  designated.    	So,  NTT  gives  the  know-how  developed
				    	in  the  laboratory  to  favorite  manufacturers,   	and  nurtures  the  manufacturer
				    	along  with  letting  it  make  the  product.    	Also,   	it  lets  special  manufacturers
				    	participate  in  the  development  from  the  beginning  stages.    	On  accaunt  of
				    	that,   	the  manufacturer  acquires  valuable  know-how.    	For  the  manufacturer,
				    	the  value  of  the  know-how  gained  from  joint  development  is  appreciated
				    	more  than  the  money  it  receives.
				    	Naturdily,   	NTT  and  these  special  manufacturers  form  one  family.    	NTT  guaran-
				    	tees  them  work,   	and,   	together  with  rendering  devoted  service  to  NTT  by  sup-
				    	plying  excellent  products,   	they  guarantee  the  livelihood  of  NTT's  employees
				    	by  accepting  NTT's  retirees  as  directors.    	Lt  is  called  the  "Denden  Family,"
				    	and  it  forms  a  huge  mutual  support  structure  seldom  seen  even  in  Japan.

				  	When  the  family  is  included,   	the  number  of  employees  would  probably  reach			  	.
				   	the  magnitudp  of  5  million.
				  	This  mutual  support  structure  has  expanded  to  include  politicians  connected
				  	with  NTT  and  a  large  number  of  the  members  of  the  Liberal  Democratic  Party's
				   	coim~?unication  committee  is  a  part  of  it.    	Even  in  the  Japan  Socialist
				  	Party,   	a  seven  member  counnittee  was  set  up  and,   	as  seen  even  in  the  recent
				  	Japan-U.S.  negotiations,   	they  conducted  lobbying  activities  on  behalf  of
				  	NTT.
				   	The  fact  that  NTT  raised  Japan  to  be.  the  world's  number  two  telephone  soci-
				   	ety  and  to  have  the  world's  highest  technology  in  specific  fields  is  pre-
				   	cisely  nothing  less  than  the  maximum  demonstration  of  the  merits  of  this
				   	cliquish  mutual  support  structure.
				   	Not  only  that,  but  the  manufacturers  belonging  to  the  NTT  family  put  to
				   	practical  use  the  know-how  obtained  from  their  work  for  NTT  in  export  com-
				   	modities,   	and  successively  advanced  into  .foreign  markets.    	The  export  volume
				   	of  Japan's  telecommunications  equipment  has  increased  every  year--in  1975,			 	,
				   	14~.7  billion  yen;   	in  1976,   	163.9  billion  yen;   	in  1977,   	166.7  billion  yen;
				   	and  in  1978,   	202.4  billion  y~n.    	This  was  almost"entirely  from  family  mem-				'
				   	bers,  with  the  majority  being  from  Fujitsu,  Ltd.,  Hitachi,   	Ltd.,   	and  Oki			   	!
				   	Electric  Industry  Company,  Ltd.
				   	That  is   	to  say,  NTT  reared  not  only  a  communications  industry  within  the			   	'
				   	country,  but  also  an  export  industry  by  means  of  its  cliquish  structure.			    	~
				   	It  was  mentioned  before  than  when  NEC  made  its  successful  bid  on  the  earth			 	:
				   	station  in  the  United  States,  U.S.  busir.essmen  argued,   	"Isn't  this  dumping
				   	from  NTT's  supplies?"    	Even  though  it  is  not  dumping,  NEC  was  able  to  de-			  	,
				   	velop  and  original  technology  and  be  victorious  over  companies  in  the
				   	Un:ited  States,   	the  home  of  this  technology,  precisely  because  it   	(NEC)  was
				   	tenderly  nurtured  by  NTT.    	It  follows  from  the  foregoing  that,   	for  the					'
				   	U.S.   	manufacturers,   	the  ringleader  of  the  intrusion  into  the  U.S.  market			   	j
				   	was  not  individual  Japanese  manufacturers,  but  had  to  be  NTT.						  	~

				   	It  is  not  strange  that  in  the  course  of  U.S.-Japan  negotiations,  when  the			  	~
				   	United  States  discovered  the  realities  of  this  "faceless"  giant,  NTT,   	it			   	i
				   	became  convinced  that  this  is  a  market  that  had  to  be  opened.    	First,  NTT,			 	~
				   	which  had  built  a  communications  technology  empire  through  its  excessively			 	;
				   	Japanese  family  system,   	is  a  symbol  of  Japan's  closed  market.						  	~

				    	Secondly,   	even  though  the  United  States  were  to  get  all  of  NTT's  procure-			  	~

				    	deficit  with  Japan.    	But,   	as  Strauss  said,   	"it  is  quality  rather  than  quan-

				    	The  "Jones  Report"  set  forth  very  clearly  the  U.S.  posture  at  this  stage.			   	,
				    	NTT  insists  there  is  nothing  it  should  purchase  from  the  United  States.			     	~
				    	But  that  same  report  counterargued  that,   	in  the  opinion  of  "experts  in
				    	general,"  the  "U.S.  made  equipment  is  superior  from  the  standpoint  of
				    	technology  and  is  competitive  from  the  standpoint  of  price."    	("Jones
				    	Report,"  Highlife  Publishers)														  	;
				    	It  is  reported  that  the  U.S.   	manufacturers  want  to  be  allowed  participation		     	;
				    	in  NTT's  development  in  the  early  stages,   	the  same  as  Fujitsu  and  NEC.    	If
				    	there  is  cooperative  development,   	they  can  gain  a  fair  share  of  NTT's  com-
		 	-		  	munications  network.    	It  will  take  considerable  time  to  participate  in  de-			  	-
				    	velopment,  but  it  will  be  profitable  because,   	in  several  years,   	they  will
				    	be  able  to  have  their  expensive  products  purchased.
				    	In  short,   	the  U.S.  manufacturers  want  to  b e  allowed  entry  into  the  NTT					'
				    	family  circle.    	This  was  a  dilemma  for  NTT.    	Because,   	up  until  now,   	they			   	�
				    	have  been  quite  comfortable  working  just  within  the  family.    	They  do  not
				    	want  to  use  anyone  outside  the  family,   	even  Japanese  manufacturers  such
				    	as  Matsushito  Electrical  Industrial  Co.,  Ltd.    	They  want  to  use  the  Ameri-			 	;
				    	cans  even  less.																	     	l
				    	If  "strangers"  come  in,   	they  cannot  attain  the  perfectionism  that  guaranteed		    	I
				     	the  quality  of  the  product  and  service.    	Moreover,   	the  price  system  wuuld			  	j`
				    	have  to  crumble  due  to  competitive  bids,   	and,  besides  that,  various  estab-				!
				    	lished  systems  would  fall  into  disorder.    	That  would  be  intolerable  for  the
				    	family  that  has  been  allowed  to  "grow  beautiful  large  flowers  inside  its			   	~

				    	But  that  does  not  hold  true  for  the  Americans,with an  "uberzeugungsverbrechen"		 	i
		   	.		  	in  the  philosophy  of  a  free  market,   	comprised  entirely  of  "strangers"  and  in		   	I
				    	which  the  person  who  excels  in  free  competitidn  wins.    	It  is  argued  that  if
		  	�		   	goods  are  supplied  according  to  specification,  NTT's  communication  network
				     	should  function  perfectly.    	If  the  goods  are  cheaper  and  superior  to  Japa-
				    	nese  products,  NTT  should  gain  that  much  more  profit.
				    	Japan  counterargued  that  the  U.S.   	telephone  market  also  is  not  open  to  for.-
				     	eign  countries.    	AT&T,  which  holds  80  percent  of  the  U.S.   	telephone  market,
				    	has  its  100  percent  financed  subsidiary,  Western  Electric,   	and  orders  al-
				    	most  everything  from  it.    	They  open  the  door  to  foreign  countries  in  prin-				~
				     	ciple,  but  actually,   	foreign  countries  cannot  participate.    	Moreover,   	the			  	~
				     	U.S.   	military,  FBI,   	CIA,  Department  of  State  and  other  government  agencies				;
				     	each  has  its  communication  network,  but  these  are  not  open.						     	~
				     	Perhaps  the  United  States  would  answer  thus.    	If  one  talks  about  opening
				     	government  procurement,   	the  United  States  has  offered  more  than  enough.
				     	Also,  AT&T  is  a  private  agency.    	Moreover,   	AT&T  has  recently  decreased  its
				     	orders  to  Western  Electric  from  the  previous  90  percent  level  to  a  70  per-
				     	cent  level.    	And  the  government  is  following  a  policy  of  eliminating  AT&T's

				    	did  not  add  the  key  parts  of  their  telecommunications  to  the  opening  of
		 	-		  	government  procurement."
				    	The  United  States  replied:    	"The  imbalance  between  the  United  States  and
				    	Japan  in  the  balance  of  payments  is  extraordinary.    	Moreover,   	the  United			     	_

				    	entered  Japan's.    	Haven't  Japan's  telecommunications  manufacturers  sold
		 	-		  	several  million  dollars  to  the  United  States?"    	Regardless  of  whether  these
				    	kinds  of  questions  and  answers  were  exchanged  during  diplomatic  negotia-
				    	tions,   	Japan  made  ~oncession  upon  concession  in  the  course  of  the  negotia-
				    	tions,   	and  finally  gave  in  to  the  extent  of  promising  to  open  up  the  key
				    	parts  of  carrler  equipment,  microwave  equipment,   	and  coaxial  cables.    	But,

				    	However,   	the  real  substance  of  the  problem  is  difficult  to  understand  when

				     	shown  the  real  substance  perfectly.												     	!

						Significance  of  Telecommunications
						Here,  we  have  to  make  a  further  inquiry  into  the  significance   	of  telephones
						and  teler.ommunications.    	The  telephone  is  not  only  an  instrument  for  con-
						versation.																				,
						After  the  war,   	Japan  rose  to  be  the  world's  number  two  telephone  society.
						This  was  wholly  the  result  of  high  level  economic  growth.    	However,  at  the
						same  time,   	it  cannot  be  overlooked  that  the  telephone  markedly  accelerated
						economic  growth.    	On  this  point,   	the  Electrical  Communications  Laboratory--
		    	'		  	it  is  the  only  full-scale  laboratory  in  the  world  researching   	telephone
						and  telecommunications  from  the  perspective  of  the  humanities--quantita-			    	'
						tively  grasped  the  economic  usefulness  of  the  telephone.    	Accordingly,   	tele-
						phone  installation  and  direct  dialing  markedly  raised  Japan's  productivity.				~
						Nowadays,   	there  is  but  a  feeling  that  it  used  to  be  other  than  it  now  is,			   	,
						but  there  was  a  time  when  it  took  more  than  half  a  day  to  call  between
						Tokyo  and  Osaka.    	One  could  hardly  leave  his  desk  while  waiting  for  the
						telephone.    	Direct  dialing  between  Tokyo,  Nagoya  and  Osaka  came  in  the				 	~
						fall  of  1953,   	at  the  time  a  cease-fire  agreement  was  reached  in  the  Korean			 	;
						War.    	It  was  gradual  but  Japan  was  heading  toward  an  economic  comeback.			     	j
						Soon  it  entered  a  period  of  tremendous  high  level  economic  growth.    	And			     	~
						during  that  time,  while  mutually  expanding  each  other,  the  economy  and  the			 	'
						telephone  grew  witk?  increasing  speed.												  	'
																										  	~
		   	.		   	Now  the  number  of  telephones  in  Japan  is  approximately  53  million.    	In  num-		     	'

				     	It  is  said  that  there  are  about  50  billion  telephone  calls  annually  in
				     	Japan.    	In  the  United  States,   	ther~  are  200  billion.    	The  Japanese  use					'
				     	the  telephone  1.2  times  daily;   	the  Americans  use  the  telephone  2.5  times.
				     	However,  when  looked  at  as  telephone  calls  per  unit  area,   	there  are  36,900
				     	telephone  calls  per  square  kilometer  annually  in  Japan;  and  2,160  in  the
				     	United  States.
				     	When  one  considers  these  data,   	it  must  be  said  that  Japan  is  an  extremely
				     	unique  telephone  society.    	In  short,  when  one  looks  at  unit  space,   	there
				     	are  10  times  more  telephone  messages  flying  past  each  other  than  in  the
		  	-		  	United  States.    	They  constitute  a  crowded  information  space.    	With  the
				     	United  States  as   	the  standard,  Japan  is  living  in  an  information  space  17
				     	times  its  land  mass.																   	'
				     	More  than  that,   	the  number  of  telegrams  has  decreased  on  account  of  the			     	I
				     	spread  of  telephones,   	and  the  number  of  letters  has  increased,   	though				  	,
				     	slightly.    	As  for  the  so-called  media,   	the  Celephone  may  be  making  the					:
				     	Japanese  communications  activity  more  and  more  lively.
						It  is  said  that  now  the  world's  electrical  equipment  market  is   	expanding			   	,
		   	-		   	at  the  rate  of  7-8  percent  per  year.    	This  is  because  the  developing  na-
						tions  are  introducing  communications  networks  and  broadcasting  networks			     	,
				     	before  anything  else.
						However,   	this  is  not  because  the  authorities  are  doing  it  for  communica-			   	i
						tion  for  the  masses,  but  because  a  national  connnunication  netwark,   	in  which
						the  central  ~overnment  would  draw  information  from  the  rank  and  file  and
				     	would  convey  orders  to  them,   	is  an  indispensable  instrument  for  national			   	,
		   	,		   	un:ity.    	A  new  country,  which  has  an  unstable  political  status  and  has  rebel-		    	;
						li~us  factions  in  the  provinces,   	is  driven  by  the  necessity  of  having  one.			 	~
						Even  in  Japan,   	the  Mei~i  government,   	along  with  opening  the  country,   	imme-				~
						diately  introduced  the  telephone;   	and  after  having  set  about  installing			     	~
						them  between  Tokyo  and  Nagasaki  in  1869,  complete  communication  lines  were			  	,
						completed  from  Hokkaido  in  the  north  to  Kyushu  in  the  south  from  1869  to
						1873.    	That  was  because  national  unity  was  being  aimed  at.    	In  the  Seinan			  	~
						War   	(Satsuma  Rebellion)  in  1875,   	the  reason  government  troops  gained				   	'
						mastery  over  the  rebel  troops  was  nothing  less  than  that  government  troops			 	~
						could  be  quickly  dispatched  by  means  of  urgent  messages  sent  by  telegram
		   	~		   	from  Kumamoto.    	Likewise,  when  3t  was  reported  an  anti-government  charged			  	,
						atmosphere  existed  in  Tosa  on  the  island  of  Shikoku  in  concert  with  the
						Seinan  War,   	the  government  hurriedly  completed  the  communication  lines				 	,

					    	mAnagemenr  was  a  countermeasure  for  public  order.     	(Same  reference)
					    	Presently,   	the  aim  of  the  developing  countries  in  their  eagerness  to  intro-
					    	duce  a  telecommunications  network,   	inappropriate   	to  their  naCional  strength,
					    	from  foreign  countries  is  no  differenC  than  that   	of  Mei3i  Japan.    	A  country
					    	that  has  difficulCy  installing  a  cable  buys  microwave  gear.    	A  country  of
					    	many  islands  tries   	Co  cover  the  archipelago  by  means  of  a  saeellite.    	In
					    	the  heyday  of  his  power,   	Shah  Pahlavi  of  Iran  ordered  not  only  telephone
					    	equipment  but  also  a  special  electronic  monitoring  network  from  the  United
					    	States.    	He  had  many  young  people  trained  in  technology  by  having  them
					    	study  abroad.    	This  was   	in  order  to  get  information  on  rebellion  factions
					    	within  the  c~untry.    	Ironically,   	his  new  and  powerful  electronic  monitoring
					    	r.etwork  was  powerless  against  Khomeyni's  ~assette  Capes.    	The  cassette
					    	tapes  Khomeyni  used  to  record  his  inflammatory  and  agitative  speeches  in
					    	Paris  were  secretly  brought  into  Iran  and  were  listened  to  in  the  mosques.
					    	So  khe  advanced  nations   	fight  furiously  in  a  battle  for  orders  itt  trying  to
					    	sell  communication  equipment  to  devel.oping  nations.    	Since  the  developing
					    	countries  have  almost  no  engineers  nor  basic  equipment,   	the  manufacturers
					    	sell  a  complete  plant,   	including  everything  from  Craining  of  engineers   	to
					    	after-care.    	Due  to  this,   	it  amounts  to  a  huge  s um  of  money.
					    	This  is  a  simple  profit  activity  for  the  manufacturers,  but  the  orders  have
					    	a  diplomatic  meaning  for  the  manufacturer's  country,  because  relations  with
					    	the  partner  country  are  deepened  on  account  of  it  and  influence  can  be
					    	exerted.    	Especially  when  the  partner  country  is   	a  country  having  a  critical
					    	importance  from  the  aspects  of  resource  security  and  strategy,   	like  the
					    	Middle  East  countries,   	each  country~s  government   	gets  caught  in  the  battle
					     	for  orders  of  communication  network  equipment.
					    	Thus,   	whe*her  they  like  it  or  not,   	the  manufacturers  cannot  help  but  have
					    	a  political  connect~on.    	To  cite  a  bad  example,   	ITT,  which  held  the  tele-
					    	phone  company  in  Chi~e,   	cooperated  with  the  CIA  to  topple  the  Allende
					    	government  and  tried  to  contribute  large  sums  of  money  to  the  CIA.
					    	On  that  point,   	the  government  of  a  country  like  Japan,  which  does  not  have
					    	any  sense  for  world  strategy,   	does  not  support  the  overseas  advances  of  its
					     	communication  industry.    	Moreover,   	since  developing  countries  purchase  com-
					    	municd~ion  equipment  in  combination  with  weapons   	imports  and  military  aid,
					    	Japan,  having  decided  not  to  export  weapons,   	is  put  at  a  disadvantage.

			     	is  always   	growing  greater.    	First,   	in  order  to  display  a  maximum  nuclear
			     	deterrent,   	the  central  government  has  to  control  Che  masses  to  move  as  it			    	-
			     	pleases.    	On  account  of  that,   	information  has  to  be  sent  in  real  Cime  and			  	'
			     	rherefore,   	a  precise,   	reliable  communications  neCwork  is  indispensable.
			     	The  climate  of  a  communications  technology  war  in  each  of  the  countries			     	;
			     	surrounding  Japan  has  worsened.    	The  U.S.   	Seventh  Fleet  is  deployed  from
			     	the  North  Pole  to  the  South  P^le.    	Through  the  use  of  satellites,   	the
			     	center  can  get  ahold  of  the  location  of  the  entire  fleet.    	For  example,					~
			     	the  flagship  Oklahoma  City  in  the  Pacific  and  the  aircraft  carrier  Midway
			     	at  anchor  in  Singapore  can  immediately  converse  by  voice.    	The  Soviet				  	'
			     	navy  also  used  satellites  at   	the  time  of  their  special  "okean"  maneuvers
	  	-		  	in  the  Pacific  Ocean.    	Since  the  location  of  a  U.S.   	or  Soviet  nuclear  sub-
			     	marine  can  be  detected  by  the  other  when  it  goes  on  the  air  while  at  sea,
			     	the  submarine  tries  to  send  signals  on  a  mass  scale  in  a  short  instant.
			     	This  also  demands  an  extensive  transmis:ion  technology.
			     	The  P3  is  an  airplane  for  detecting  submarines.    	An  optical  fiber  like
			     	that  developed  by  NTT  is  used  in  them.    	The  P3  is  like  a  computer  itself;			  	;
			     	its  insides  are  full  of  various  kinds  of  sensors.    	When  wired  with.~.metallic		     	~
			     	wiring  in  the  past,   	each  built  a  magnetic  field  and  caused  mutual  inter-			    	;
			     	ference.    	However  when  optical  fibers  are  used,  no  magnetic  field  is  set
			     	up  nor  does  mutual  interference  take  place.										     	~
			     	Now,  when  there  is  an  opening  of  hostilities,  large  and  small  missiles  would		   	,
			     	start   	flying.    	The  weapons  from  now  on  are  almost  all  guided  weapozis.    	In
			     	short,   	weapons  are  guided  not  by  voice  but  by  electronic  signal.    	There-			    	~
			     	fore,   	the  communications  equipment  is  key  to  a  security  system,   	and  each
					country  adopts  stringent  secretive  measures.    	The  United  States3,  which  per-		     	~
			     	mits  Japan  the  licensed  production  of  the  P3  and  F14,   	does  no'_  allow  Japan				~
					the  licensed  production  of  the  communication  equipment  for  these  aircraft.			 	;
					Rather,   	it  has  decided  to  bring  it  in  from  the  United  States.    	It  is  done			  	i
					this  way  even  with  an  ally  like  Japan.    	Accordingly,   	Japan  also  allows  its			 	~
					own  development  to  be  done  by  national  manufacturers.    	It  is  not  strange			   	~
					that  these  are  manufacturers   	fostered  by  NTT.

					Connection  of  Computers  With  Communication  Lines

					Thus,   	it  is  understood  that  the  telephone  and  telecommunications  are  extra-

			     	and  computers   	to  be  uniCed.
			     	SBS,  where  NEC  successfully  bid  for  the  earth  station,   	is  an  example  of  a
			     	computer  manufacturer  launching  into  communications.    	According  to  Che
			     	plan,   	SBS  launches  two  satellites.    	Users  use  them  to  send  voice  data  or
			     	facsimile  signals  to  their  branch  offices  throughout  the  whole  country.
			     	That  is   	cheaper  than  using  AT&T's  long  distance  telephone.	    	'
			     	Even  Xerox,   	the  copy  machine  company,   	is  planning  a  data  communications
			     	network  that  uses  satellites,     	It  will  be  called  XTN   	(Xerox  Telecommunica-
	  	~		    	tions  Network),   	and  is  a  plan  to  transmit  computer  data  and  graphics--their
			     	specialty--to  200  cities  throughout  the  United  States.    	Xerox  has  already
			     	taken  over  Western  Union  International,   	a  tslegraph  company,   	and  a  computer
			     	terminal  company.
			     	RCA  is  already  performing  satellite  communication  and  it  is  said  t'hat  there
			     	is  the  possibility  that  huge  corporations,   	such  as  Exxon,   	the  oil  company,
			     	GE  and  BoPing,   	the  sircraft  company,  will  launch  into  the  computer  communi-
			     	cation  industry.
			     	These  movements  are  all  a  challenge  to  AT&T  which  monopolizes  the  country's
			     	telephones  and  telegraphs.    	By  law,   	AT&T  is  prohibited  from  getting  into
			     	computer  information  processin~;.    	But  recently,  voices  have  been  heard
			     	urging  that  permission  be  given   	both  from  within  the  government  and  AT&T.
			     	If  permitted,   	huge  companies,  which  carry  information  through  communica-
    	~			 	tion  lines  and  computers,  would  begin  jostling  each  other.
			     	Moreover,   	communications  lines  and  computers  would  never  remain  just  inside
			     	the  country,  but  there  would  be  an  eagerness  to  connect  them  w:ith  foreign
			     	countries.    	Just  such  a  case  i.s   	the  information  processing  service  Dentsu,
			     	the  advertising  company,   	is  offering  in  joint  venture  with  the  U.S.  company,
			     	GE.    	The  computer  is  housed  in  Cleti:land.    	Japanese  users  will  call  the
			     	computer  in  Cleveland  by  telephone,   	and  give  data  input  or  receive  data
			     	output,   	or  receive  computations   	from  this  side  of  the  Pacific  Ocean.    	Re-
			     	cently,   	NHK  used  this  and  processed  the  data  from  a  public  opinion  poll.
			     	In  the  same  manner,  Kokusai  Denshin  Denwa  Co.,  Ltd.   	(KDD)   	entered  into  part-
			     	nership  with  RCA,   	ITT  and  Western  Union.    	They  are  also  ~.lanning  a  service
			     	whereby  Japanese  users  can  use  an  overseas  data  bank  while  retnaining  within
			     	Japan.    	The  day  may  come  when  IBM's  SBS,  Xerox'  XT1V  and  other  newly  estab-
			     	lished  computer  communication  companies  will  try  to  link  Japan  by  use  of

			   	source)    	A  telephone  conversa'~ion  between  Peking  and  Shanghai  is  more  dif-
			   	ficult  to  hear  than  one  between  Peking  and  Tokyo.
			   	There  is  an  enormous  role  t~at  a  telecommunications  network  cannot  help
			   	but  accomplish  in  the  unification  of  this  country.    	Although  unification
			   	of  China  geographically  and  in  essence  has  been  impossible  since  ancient
			   	times,  China  was  compelled  to  force  a  unification  politically.    	On  account
			   	of  that,   	the  first  Manchu  emperor  maintained  the  ureat  Wall  in  the  north
			   	in  an  era  before  Christ,   	and,   	in  the  south,   	opened  a  canal  to  connect  the
    	r		     	north  and  the  south.    	However,  with  telecommunications,  a  long  river  is
    	"		     	easily  crossed,   	a  desert  is  crossed,   	a  craggy  mountain  range  is  crossed.
			   	All  kinds  of  geographic  conditions  are  overcome.    	Information  is  gathered
			   	and  orders  are  transmitted.
			   	But,   	anyone  who  visits  China  perhaps  would  get  a  strong  feeling  of  the
			   	difficulty  of  stretching  a  cable  in  this  kind  of  land.    	However,  with  micro-
			   	wave  equipment,   	a  point  alone  is  enough.    	Moreover,   	if  a  satellite  is
			   	launched  the  entire  country  can  be  covered  at  once  from  the  sky.
			   	Recently,   	there  has  been  a  flurry  of  visits  by  U.S.  experts  to  China.    	AT&T
			   	representatives  visited  China  in  May  in  ordez~  to  deal  with  the  "increasing
			   	international  telephone  calls  between  the  United  States  and  China."    	A
			   	little  later,   	a  NASA  delegation,   	led  oy  Dr  Robert  Frosch,  visited  China.
			   	China  is  likewise  trying  to  use  satellites  for  national  communication.
			   	It  goes  without  saying,   	they  can  depend  only  on  the  United  States.    	When
			   	Teng  Hsiao-ping  visited  the  United  States  some  time  ago,  he  reached  a  funda-
    	,		     	meatal  agreement  with  Carter  to  have  NASA  put  private  use  satellites  into
			   	orbit  in  the  skies  over  China.
			   	China  has  already  started  negotiations  with  COMSAT  on  the  purchase  of  one
			   	domestic  satellite  communication  facility  and  earth  station.    	The  COMSAT
			   	engineers  are  going  to  guide  China.    	The  price  has  not  been  announced,  but
			   	this  kind  of  equipment  is  estimated  to  be  24  million  dollars.
			   	Undoubtedly,   	the  problem  is  China's  solvency.    	But,   	as  long  as  China's
			   	leaders  are  earnestly  aiming  at  modernization,   	they  cannot  help  but  start
			   	to  work  on  the  improvement  and  expansion  of  a  national  communications  net-
			   	work,  which  is  the  foundation  of  modernization.    	That  also  has  great  sig-
			   	nificance  for  a  military  strat~gy  toward  the  USSR.    	Thus,   	sooner  or  later,
			   	Japan  and  the  linited  States  will  be  in  fierce  opposition  and  competition				.
			   	over  China's  communicatians  market.    	Sources  at  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Japan
			   	are  aware  of  this.

		-				change  in  its  situation  that  would  try  to  seek  a  regenerati~n  by  means  of
		"				a  growing  co~nunications  technology.    	No  matter  who  the  representative  is
					in  the  negotiations,   	the  real  substance  will  not  change.
					The  veil  was  unexpectedly  stripped  off  of  the  "faceless  giant,"  NTT,  by
					this  new  state  of  affairs  in  the  United  States.    	Now  unveiled,  NTT  cannot
					continue  to  be  closed  as  it  has  been  for  many  years.    	A  storm  is  already
					raging  in  the  United  States  for  the  elimination  of  the  public  communica-
					tion  industry's  monopoly.    	Its  afte-reffect  will  cross  the  Pacific  and  can-
					not  be  kept  from  washing  Japan's  shores.    	Through  free  competition,  perhaps
					there  are  fields  where  improvement  in  service  can  be  expecte~i.
					However,  we  have  known  that  the  telephone  is  not  just  a  simple  tool  for  con-
					versation,  but  has  an  unfathomable  significance  socially,   	economically,
					politically,   	internationally,   	and  also  from  the  perspective  of  security.
					And  it  has  deep  meaning  for  our  lives.    	If  the  telephone  network  is  the
					nerve  center  of  the  country,   	the  computer  that  carries  out  telephone  ex-
					change  and  data  processing  is  the  brain  of  the  country.    	This  brain  has  to
		.				function  more  and  more  actively.    	In  order  to  do  that,   	it  is  necessary  to
					have  an  environment  where  those  in  charge  maintain  enough  morale  and  nur-
					ture  technology  with  affection.
					On  that  point,   	the  merits  of  NTT's  traditional  perfectionism  must  be  greatly
					demonstrated.    	The  minuses  produced  by  allowing  competition  in  a  free  market
					would  exceed  the  pluses.
					If  the  government  authorities  were  thinking  of  the  opening  of  NTT  in  terms
					of  volume,   	as  with  salmon  and  trout,   	they  could  not  have  been  more  mistaken.
					The  telephone  is  a  high  level  technology  that  is  going  to  be  the  new  bearer
     	-				of  the  information  era  by  virtue  of  its  connection  with  the  computer.    	It
					is  also  a  clean,   	freely  growing  field  that  Japan  must  live  by  in  the  future
		,			 	as  well.    	Japan,  which  constitutes  a  crowded  information  space  rarely  seen
					in  the  world,  must  coutribute  to  the  world  in  this  field.

			  	methods  of  such  materials.    	It  is  noteworthy  as  a  comprehensive  research
			  	development  project  in  the  super  low  temperature  sphere  which  is  regarded
			  	as  the  industry  of  tomor.row.
			  	Metal  Materials  Technology  and  Research  Institute  has  been  studying  th~  super

			  	date,   	it  has  developed  vanadium  3-  gallium  which  is  said  to  have  the  highest
			  	critical  magnetic  force  when  made  into  a  magnet  and  niobium  3-  germanium
			  	which  is  said  to  excel  as  a  processable  materials.    	Manufacturing  methods
			  	for  turning  the  latter  into  tapes  and  multi-cor.e  wires  have  also  been  per-			 	~

			  	net  with  niobium  3-  tin  magnet  and  performance  tests  for  various  test  pro-
			  	duction  materials  are  underway  there.
			  	The  project,   	slated  to  start  in  1980,   	is  built  on  these  research  results  and
			  	it  is  an  attempt  to  put  them  into  practical  use  or  to  develop  a  system  which

				 	MICRO-CERAMIC  BA,LL  MANUFACTURING  TECHNOLOGY  DEVELOPED
				 	Tokyo  NIHON  KOGYO  SHIMBUN  in  Japanese  26  May  79  p  9
						   	[Excerpts~    	Assistant  professor  Yoshiji  Ozaki  of  Seikei  Uni-
						  	versity  Engineering  Department,   	Industrial  Chemistry  Section,
						  	and  others  have  developed  a  new  manufacturing  method  for  a						-
						  	"micro-ceramic  ball"  of  milliorder  to  submicron  order  minute-
						  	ness.    	A  wide  range  of  use		heat  resistant  and  chemical					 	-
	    	-				    	resistant  ball  bearing,   	electron  material,   	composite  materi-
						  	al,   	catalytic  agent  and  so  on	 	is  expected  to  arise  from
						  	the  ceramic  ball  invention.    	However,   	there  has  been  diffi-
						  	culty  in  finding  a  way  to  mass  produce  homogeneous  mic?-o-
						  	cermaic  balls  cheapZy.    	The  new  technique  may  provide  the
						  	answer.    	At  present,   	corundtun  (a.   	aluminum)  micro-balls
						  	are  the  only,ones  being  manufactured  but  Ozaki  commented
						  	that  "the  method  can  be  applied  to  any  and  all  ceramic  ma-
						  	terials  -=~~oxide,   	carbide,  nitride,  borid  and.,so  on.
				 	The  new  technique  skillfully  employs  the  phenomenon  of  an  oil  drop  injected
				 	into  water  and  agitated  vigorously.    	This  will  cause  the  oil  drop  to  be  dis-
				 	persed  in  the  water  and  to  form  into  minute  globules.    	With  the  passage  of
				 	time,   	oil  thus  dispersed  in  water  will  gather  together  again  and  revert  back
				 	to  its  original  form.    	The  crux  of  the  operation  is  to  solidify  the  globules
				 	'~efore  they  recongregate.    	In  the  case  of  corundum  balls  water  is  added  to
	    	_		   	dissolve  aluminum  isopropoxide  to  obtain  baimite   	[transliteration].    	By	   	'
				 	adding  hydrochloric  acid  to  this  solution  and  peptizing  it  at  95�C  (to  re-
				 	turn  colloidal  particles  to  sol),   	baimite  sol  is  obtained.    	When  this  sol
				 	is  agitated  in  2  ethyl  hexyl  alcohol,   	globules  are  produced  as  the  two  com-
				 	ponents  are  like  water  and  oil.    	If  interfacial  activatar  is  introduced  at
				 	the  same  time,   	the  uniting  tendency  of  globules  is  repr~ssed,   	and  with  pas-
				 	sage  of  time,   	the  globules  become  solidified  in  the  alcohol  as  a  result  of
				 	sol's  thixotropy  characteristic   	(disposition  of  liquid  sol  to  turn  into  gel
					when  it  is  left  alone).    	Left  on  their  own  the  globules  will  sink  to  the
					bottom  of  the  receptacle  and  will  change  thei.r  shape  as  globular  density  is
				 	greater  than  that  of  alcohol.    	Thus  carbon  tetrachloride  is  added  to  control
				 	the  density  and  the  globules  are  left  suspended  in  liquid	 	"marimo   	[trans-
	   	~		   	literation]"  fashion.    	In  this  s[ate,   	ttie  moisture  in  the  globul es   	is  gra-
				 	dually  released  into  the  alcohol  and  eventually  they  will  acquire  a~hardness
					which  resists  self-transformation.

						When  dry  globules  thus  obtained  are~centered  at  1600�C,   	the  objective  of
						corundum  ball  is  attained.    	Globular  diameter  diminishes  in  size  as  the
						baimite  volume  in  the  gel  is  decreased  and  more  viole~nt  the  agitation,
						smaller  the  diameter  of  globules.    	That  is,   	globular  size  can  freely  be  con-
					 	trolled.    	Also,   	globular  diameter  distribution  can  be  restricted  ta  a  rather
						narrow  range.    	For  example,   	the  experiments  verified  that  in  most  instances
					 	the  globular  si~e  range  was  between  0.1  ~  0.3  millimeters.
						Moreover,   	the  globules  thus  obtained  are  homogeneous  and  not  anisotropic.
					 	It  is  possible  to  make  globules  with  spiracles	 	that  is  their  construc-
					 	tion  can  be  porous.
					 	It  i:;  said  that  research  is  under  way  in  the  electric  and  electronic  m;ceri-

					 	to  be  a  research  under  way  which  uses  globular  ceramics  as  fillers   	(gobs).

					METHACOAL  BY  MITSUI--Tokyo   	(AP)--Japan's  Mitsui  group  of  industries  will
				 	develop  a  new  liquid  energy  source  called~methacoal  made  entirely  from
				 	coal,   	an  official  at  Mitsui  and  Co.   	said  Thursday.    	The  official  said
				 	that  methacoal,   	to  be  composed  of  inethanol--methyl  alcohol--and  coal
				 	powder,  has  potentiaX  as  an  oil-alternative  energy  source  because  its
				 	liquid  form  makes  it  easy  to  transport  and  it  generates  more  heat  than
					methanol.    	The  plan  calls  for  the  construction  of  a  pilot  plant~and
				 	refinement  of  production  techniques  within  five  yeara.    	Mitsui  is  now				  	~
				 	seeking  Government  funds  to  support  the  pro~ect,  which  will  cost  an				     	~
				 	estimated  ~5  billion  ($23  million),   	the  officials  said.    	Methacoal  will					~
				 	have  a  heat  generating  capacity  of  6,000  kilocalories  for  every  kilo-				  	�
				 	gram,   	lower  than  oil  at  10,000  kilocalories  and  coal-oil  mixtures  at				    	~
				 	8,000  kilocalories  but  higher  than  methanols  5,400  kilocaTories.    	How-				 	;
				 	ever,   	it  has  the  big  advantage  of  using  no  oil,  different  from  coal-oil			     	'
				 	liquids  now  under  development  in  several  nations,   	the  official  said.
