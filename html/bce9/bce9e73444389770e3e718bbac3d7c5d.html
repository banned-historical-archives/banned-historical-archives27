 Putting Computers to Work
 in China: Priorities,
 Problems, and Prospects
 Key Judgments  Over the past several years, Beijing has embarked on an ambitious plan to

 the military. It has done so by sharply increasing imports of computers-
 purchases of microcomputers more than doubled last year; encouraging
 domestic assembly and production; developing new administrative controls;
 and allocating funds for improved software development, maintenance,
 repair, and education.
 Efficient, effective, and widespread use of computers will be slow in
 coming. A shortage of qualified service, software, and training personnel;
 inadequate supplies of peripheral equipment; poor data communications
 links; and general infrastructural weaknesses keep as many as 80 percent
 of China's computers from being used effectively-if at all. Continuing
 bureaucratic confusion also slows progress. The organization nominally
 responsible for overseeing China's computer program-the Leading Group
 for the Invigoration of the Electronics Industry-has not yet proved able to
 ensure that imports fill the requirements of a dozen different ministries or
 to coordinate the work of researchers and producers in military and civilian
 entities. Finally, US and multilateral export controls will continue to limit
 the types of computers and software available to China for such applica-
 tions as sophisticated design work, computer networking, seismic data
 processing, and weather forecasting. These problems will keep the Chinese
 from establishing reliable nationwide computer networks until at least the
 mid- 1990s.
 Nonetheless, over the next five years, we expect China to make progress to-
 ward boosting its computer inventory and improving computer use. Com-
 puter imports and domestic production will continue to increase, and we
 expect microcomputers that are assembled in China from imported kits
 gradually to substitute for imports. As China's software and service
 personnel increase both in number and in experience, moreover, computer
 utilization will also improve. This optimistic view is supported by several
 factors: high-level endorsement of and financial backing for computeriza-
 tion, recently liberalized US and multilateral export controls for some
 types of computers, and the establishment of joint Chinese-Western
 production facilities.
 The growth of computer use, in turn, will lead to improvements in product
 quality, productivity, and energy efficiency, and to lowered production

 costs. But here, too, there are limits. Low wage rates, inflexible factory
 management practices, and a lack of labor mobility will, in our judgment,
 limit the financial benefits to Chinese industry from the introduction of
 computers. Moreover, some managers reportedly do not use their comput-
 ers for inventory control because to do so would eliminate "backdoor" sales
 and supply channels.
 Some civilian computer projects have military applications. We believe a
 current project to link Western minicomputers and mainframes at China's
 universities is tied to the Chinese military's plan for a computerized
 command network. A project involving the automation of track scheduling
 and reservations for China's railways-which involves secure fiber-optics
 technology-may also be backed by the military. But military data
 networks necessary for improved command and control will be delayed by
 the need to improve data communications links, and export controls on
 design software will impede Beijing's advances in military research and
 development.
 The United States will remain a critical partner in China's program to
 promote the use of computers. US firms so far have been the most willing
 to transfer computer production technology, and US computer equipment
 enjoys a reputation in China for reliability, systems compatibility, and
 servicing ease. Nonetheless, stringent restrictions still apply to sales of
 networking equipment and intercity data communications lines, and
 Washington will face continued pressure from Beijing to permit sales of
 this equipment. Beijing might even threaten to delay purchases of US
 computer equipment for nationwide networks until it can purchase the
 requisite networking technology as well.

 Putting Computers to Work
 in China: Priorities,
 Problems, and Prospects
 The Goal: Widespread Use of Computers
 During much of the last decade, China used comput-
 ers primarily for projects that required data calcula-
 tions on a massive scale-processing seismic data for
 the energy sector, conducting a national census, and
 forecasting weather, for example. In recent years,
 shifts in China's economic modernization strategy and
 in military requirements have shaped the selection of
 additional priorities for computer use. China's eco-
 nomic reform program heavily emphasizes improved
 productivity, more efficient management, reliable en-
 ergy supplies, and expanded transport capacity-all
 areas in which computers can bring significant re-
 sults. Computerized communications systems for
 command, control, and logistics are also an integral
 part of Beijing's plans for military modernization. The
 advent of sophisticated, versatile, and inexpensive
 microcomputer technology, and US and COCOM
 adoption of more liberal export policies have also
 contributed to China's redirection of computer re-
 sources
 Beijing recognizes the importance of modern data-
 processing and communications systems to both in-
 dustry and defense, and is embarking on an ambitious
 program to broaden the use of computers in these
 sectors. A number of ministries and central agencies
 have undertaken programs to apply computer technol-
 ogy to production and planning. Priorities for use of
 computers include:
 ? Computer-aided design (CAD) of large-scale inte-
 grated circuits and aerospace vehicles.
 In addition, the Chinese have recently begun to
 provide information in the open press about the country's computer
 production capabilities and limitations, and problems with effective
 computer use. Trade data reflect overt acquisitions only, and are
 based on US customs statistics and United Nations' member
 country reporting.
 ? Process control and resource management in the
 metallurgy, manufacturing, and machine-building
 industries.
 ? Inventory control, supply scheduling, and financial
 accounting in factories.
 ? Planning, logistics, and training for units of the
 People's Liberation Army (PLA).
 ? Processing seismic data for China's petroleum
 sector.
 ? Improving research facilities at key universities.
 Other priority projects require computer networks and
 data transmission links between cities:
 ? Scheduling passenger reservations and freight trans-
 port on China's rail and air lines.
 ? Predicting medium- and long-range weather
 conditions.
 ? Processing national census or industrial
 information.
 ? Keeping records of technology purchases made by
 national and local trading corporations.
 ? Automating transaction processing by the banking
 system.
 ? Storing and disseminating technical information
 retrieved from data bases in the United States,
 Canada, and Italy.
 ? Enhancing military communications, command, and
 control.'
 To spread computer use, Beijing initially sought to
 increase the number of computers available by in-
 creasing both imports and domestic production. As

 b The growth in domestic computer production in 1985-86 largely
 reflects equipment assembled in China from imported kits.
 China's inability to absorb the technology became
 increasingly apparent last year, however, Beijing
 strengthened its efforts to boost the ranks of computer
 personnel, and to exert better control over the quality
 of computer imports and domestic goods.
 Increase the Stock of Computers
 Expand Imports. After three of China's powerful
 commissions-Planning, Economics, and Science and
 Technology-announced a September 1983 decision
 to focus on microcomputers instead of larger comput-
 ers, imports soared. Although precise figures are not
 available, drawing on fragmentary information based
 on US trade statistics,
 and Chinese press reports, we judge that
 The announcement also coincided with a decentraliza-
 tion of foreign trade control that resulted in a prolifer-
 ation of small, loosely regulated trading companies
 eager to profit from the growing demand for comput-
 ers. China's imports of microcomputers and larger
 systems reached $330 million in 1984-triple the level
 of 1983-and may have exceeded $400 million in
 1985, according to UN trade data (see figure 1).
 Boost Domestic Production. Nationwide, the surge in
 imports overshadowed production gains recorded by
 the domestic industry. Since 1982, imports have
 exceeded domestically produced goods in China's
 computer inventory; imports now account for an
 estimated two-thirds of China's stock (see figure 2). In
 Chinese purchases of micros increased from 20,000 in
 1983 to 30,000 in 1984, and roughly 65,000 in 1985.

 individual enterprises, users developed a clear prefer-
 ence for imports over domestically produced equip-
 ment                              They con-
 sidered imports to be more reliable, more easily linked

 to other computers and systems, and to have a wider Million US $ by quarter
 range of software and peripheral equipment available.
 The relatively high prices for domestic computers
 provided additional justification for users to seek
 imports. As a result, in the last few years, a number of
 Chinese factories stopped producing indigenous com-
 puter models, finding it more lucrative to assemble
 computer kits or to sell fully assembled imports,
 according to                      consular re-
 ports.
 Apparently concerned that foreign domination of
 China's computer market might stunt development of
 the domestic industry, Beijing in early 1985 imple-
 mented measures to curtail imports and encourage
 production in China. Beijing dropped prices on do-
 mestically produced microcomputers, cut the duty on
 computer components imported for assembly, more
 than doubled tariffs on microcomputer imports, and
 imposed a 40-percent import surtax on micros. China
 further curtailed computer imports by centralizing its
 import-licensing system over 15 key commodities,
 including microcomputers, and by reimposing controls
 on foreign exchange expenditures that limited major

 purchases to those for essential projects already in the                 25X1
 state plan. Finally, in May 1985, the State Council
 adopted regulations on technology imports that for-
 mally tied purchases of advanced equipment-includ-                         and poor data communications links, moreover, have

 (see figure 3).
 Make Better Use of Computers
 The Chinese openly admit that one-half to four-fifths
 of the country's computers are being used ineffective-
 ly-if used at all. Chinese users
 have reported that computers produced
 in China are outdated, unreliable, and incompatible
 with other Chinese or imported models. Moreover,
 imported computers may be obsolete, low-quality, or
 counterfeit goods that are frequently incompatible
 with other equipment or simply unserviceable. Inade-
 quate maintenance, the absence of applications soft-
 ware and peripheral equipment, improper training,
 utilization.
 Setting Standards. Beijing has tried for several years
 to limit computer imports to selected models,
 eaders renewed their efforts
 in the middle of 1985, when-to replace a dormant
 standardization committee formed two years earlier-
 they gave the Bureau of Computer Industry of the
 Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI) expanded
 power over the planning of a coherent computer

 development and purchase policy. Initially, attempts
 to standardize were probably designed to take advan-
 tage of the abundant software available for certain
 computer models: more recently, we believe the Chi-
 nese are prompted by increased interest in computer
 networking.
 Writing Software. Beijing has earmarked at least
 $200 million for software development over the next
 five years, and hopes to increase its corps of software
 programers from 10,000 in 1984 to 100,000 in 1990,
 according to press reports. The massive effort is
 motivated, in part, by the hope that China can
 produce software for export; in part, as an offshoot of
 developing software to make computers more useful.
 In April 1984, the MEI formed the China Software
 Technology Company (CSTC) to draw up a five-year
 plan for the country's software industry and to coordi-
 nate the plan's implementation. CSTC, in turn,
 formed the China Association for Software Industry
 several months later to distribute software. In 1985,

 computer scientists are already beginning to train
 staff for the centers
 Finally, Beijing has solicited foreign firms to cooper-
 ate with Chinese programers in developing software
 and, despite the absence of legal protection against
 pirating, has attracted more than 20 foreign part-
 ners-60 percent of them from Japan.'
 Developing Chinese Character-Processing Methods.
 To make computers accessible to more of its people,
 China must develop methods for coding and manipu-
 lating Chinese character information. Chinese univer-
 sities and institutes are widely reported to be working
 on more than 400 methods. Military research centers
 are actively working on character coding because it
 could speed command and control-which now uses
 cumbersome four-digit telegraphic codes to represent
 individual characters-without forcing field personnel
 to learn English. Western vendors are working to
 develop methods to accommodate the large number of
 potential computer users who do not know English. In
 January 1986, Beijing issued criteria for selecting
 character-processing methods.
 Enhancing Data Communications Links. The leader-
 ship ranks progress in improving China's outmoded
 and overworked telecommunications system among
 the top priorities for the country's economic develop-
 ment program.
 Easing Shortages of Peripheral Equipment. Over the
 last few years, Chinese factories have signed assembly
 agreements with Western firms for printers, termi-
 nals, floppy disks, and disk drives. As a result of some
 of these arrangements, the availability of peripher-
 als-especially for imported computers-is slowly im-
 proving. Beijing has not formed any central authority
 specifically to oversee the purchase and development
 of peripheral equipment, however, and the availability
 of peripherals for indigenous computers remains poor.
 Providing Maintenance. The MEI formed the China
 Computer Technical Service Company (CCTSC) in
 1980 to ensure that adequate training, aftersales
 service, and transfer of production technology accom-
 panied computer imports. CCTSC, with 3,000 em-
 ployees, has set up service centers in nearly all of
 China's provinces, and has signed at least four cooper-
 ative service agreements with foreign computer ven-
 dors. In addition, the China National Instruments
 Import-Export Corporation (INSTRIMPEX) is in-
 creasingly providing maintenance and repair services
 to users for whom it has made purchases. INSTRIM-
 PEX exercises control over as many as 5,000 addition-
 al service personnel, and has signed at least nine
 cooperative service agreements with foreign firms.
 Improving Computer Training. CCTSC also coordi-
 nates an active nationwide program to improve com-
 puter literacy. In 1984, it set up 41 training centers,
 announced plans for at least 10 additional sites, and
 produced a series of educational videotapes for micro-
 computer users. Independently, elementary and mid-
 dle schools have begun to offer computer courses, and
 magazines aimed at beginning computer users have

 Producers include the Ministries of Electronics, As-
 tronautics, and Posts and Telecommunications; uni-
 versities under the State Education Commission; and
 the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Users encompass
 every conceivable sector-military and civilian indus-
 tries alike; institutes as well as factories. Each minis-
 try has at least one import corporation of its own,
 state-sponsored technology import corporations make
 purchases for several ministries at a time, and inde-
 pendent traders operate as free agents during periods
 of decentralized foreign trade control.' Given China's
 difficulty matching needs with supplies even within a
 single ministry, the problem of coordination across so
 many bureaucratic boundaries is immense.
 Beijing has tried for three years to coordinate the
 development of China's computer sector and related
 industries. Its first step, in late 1982, was formation of
 the State Council's Leading Group for Computers
 and Integrated Circuits. It soon became apparent that
 the group's scope was too narrow: it had been unable
 to limit the volume or quality of computer imports, to
 ensure that purchases were appropriate for users'
 needs, or to raise utilization rates. Less than two years
 after it was established, Beijing reorganized the
 group, adding representatives from China's telecom-
 munications sector, a handful of industrial and
 defense-related ministries that are major users of
 computers, and the ministry that oversees a large

 share of China's computer imports. To reflect its
 broader charter, Beijing also renamed it the Leading
 Group for the Invigoration of the Electronics Indus-
 try. Despite Beijing's efforts to include all relevant
 parties, dozens of agencies that are active users of
 computers are not represented on the body and con-
 tinue to operate independently. A sizable portion of
 the trade in computers also remains outside of the
 Leading Group. In fact, in the year and a half since
 the restructuring, the new Leading Group has report-
 edly convened only once. Moreover, it has no funds of
 its own, deriving authority largely from the impor-
 tance of its leader, Vice Premier Li Peng (see inset).
 Outlook: Progress Impeded by
 Bureaucracy and Trade Controls
 Over the next five years, we expect China to make
 progress toward boosting its computer inventory and
 improving computer use. Computer imports and do-
 mestic production will continue to grow, and we
 expect microcomputers that are assembled in China
 from imported kits gradually to substitute for imports.
 As China's software and service personnel increase
 both in number and in experience, computer utiliza-
 tion will also improve, in our judgment. Key factors
 contributing to progress in these areas include:
 ? High-level endorsement of efforts to promote the
 use of computers, and strong financial backing for
 most initiatives.
 ? Liberalized US and multilateral export controls,
 and streamlined COCOM procedures for expediting
 case review.'
 ? Establishment of cooperative production facilities
 and service centers involving Chinese and foreign
 partners.
 ? Emphasis at colleges and universities on turning out
 qualified programers.
 ? Increased attention to training service technicians
 abroad as part of purchase agreements.
 "The changes in COCOM export policy for China announced in
 October 1985 will shorten the waiting period between export license
 application and approval for the majority of Chinese cases. Upon
 implementation, licenses for low- or intermediate-level technology
 will be granted by individual countries, with notification to
 In our judgment, however, bureaucratic rivalries and
 inefficiencies will delay the formulation and imple-
 mentation of a coherent strategy for the development
 of China's information industries, keeping China from
 taking full advantage of its computers. Export con-
 trols and the reluctance of suppliers to transfer pro-
 duction technology will impede advances in China's
 ability to produce minicomputers and mainframes.
 Although the reorganization of the electronics Lead-
 ing Group brought in many of the producers and users
 the original group had excluded, we believe it will
 remain unable to bring order to China's electronics
 and information industries. Rivalries and funding
 problems will impede attempts to improve China's
 data communications capability, probably delaying
 the deployment of nationwide computer networks
 until the mid-1990s.' The absence of strong central
 coordination will also adversely affect the availability
 of peripheral equipment and attempts to adopt nation-
 al standards for computer equipment and Chinese
 character software.
 US and COCOM controls on exports to China will
 continue to curtail the sale of large computers, sophis-
 ticated software, and networking technology for some
 applications, including robotics, microcircuit design,
 seismic data processing, weather forecasting, weapons
 development, and data networks of all types that
 operate over long distances. Export controls will prob-
 ably also continue to impede or even to bar transfers
 of mainframe manufacturing technology, leaving
 Beijing dependent on imports of larger computers.'

 mainframe assembly in mid-1985. The joint venture is with a US
 firm. The export license for this case-the first of its kind-is under

 Secret
 ... For China's Economy
 We believe the introduction of computers to economic
 planning, industrial production, and transport sched-
 uling will-after what may be an extended period of
 adjustment-improve product quality, raise produc-
 tivity, increase energy efficiency, and cut production
 costs. The Chinese press has already noted some
 impressive-and often exaggerated-results from the
 use of computers: steel and cotton mills earning
 hundreds of thousands of dollars extra because of
 increased efficiency, heavy industries reducing energy
 consumption by 25 percent, and transportation costs
 being cut by millions of dollars each year, for exam-
 ple. Low wage rates, inflexible factory management
 practices, and a lack of labor mobility will, in our
 judgment, limit the financial benefits to Chinese
 industry from the introduction of computers, however.
 Some managers reportedly do not use the computers
 they have to control inventory and schedule supplies,
 because to do so would eliminate the "backdoor" sales
 and supply channels they have carefully cultivated
 over the years, closing off routes of opportunity for
 enterprising individuals. Furthermore, because Chi-
 nese labor is cheap and computers are expensive,
 computers do not always reduce unit costs-even if
 they do raise output and improve product quality.
 Finally, to realize the productivity gains expected
 where computers replace human labor, enterprises
 must either fire or retrain workers; but, more often,
 Chinese factories continue to employ displaced work-
 ers by creating unnecessary tasks for them. One
 Beijing factory, for example, reportedly trimmed its
 work force by more than 8,000 laborers when it
 computerized production, then found jobs for the
 workers planting trees and recycling refuse.
 ... For Military Modernization
 Enhancing Command and Control. We believe the
 establishment of either civilian or military data net-
 works-though likely to be delayed for at least a
 decade by the need to improve data communications
 links-will enhance military communications, com-
 mand, and control. Chinese press reports indicate that
 the PLA has already deployed a computerized long-
 distance communications link-with Chinese charac-
 ter capability-to be used for administration and
 management functions in peacetime, and command
 and control operations in time of war. Civilian net-
 works would also contribute to China's communica-
 tions, command, and control capability by providing
 the PLA with systems that could be taken over in time
 of war and by familiarizing military personnel with
 computer networking techniques. From a technical
 standpoint, data networks to be used for planning and
 administration or dissemination of technical literature
 do not differ substantially from those suitable for
 command and control of military forces. Moreover,
 several of the planned networks with an overt civilian
 application may be linked to China's efforts to up-
 grade its military command and control:
 ? We believe a project to link Western minicomputers
 and mainframes at 14 of China's universities could
 be tied to the PLA's plan to link its scattered
 computers into a computerized command network.
 Overlaps in personnel and similarities in the equip-
 ment involved support this judgment. In addition,
 Chinese planners have acknowledged that the com-
 puters selected for the universities were chosen
 because they were used in the US Worldwide
 Military Command and Control Network. More-
 over, one of the universities houses part of China's
 strategic missile force, which is attempting to pro-
 cure up to 200 additional computers for a nation-
 wide network.9
 ? We further judge that a project involving the auto-
 mation of track scheduling and reservations for
 China's rails could be backed by the military. This
 project involves computer models that are prized by
 military users, as well as fiber-optics technology
 that could provide a secure communications capa-
 assert control over the railroads' computer network
 in a time of need.

 Improving Logistics, Training, and Research and
 Development (R&DA Over the next few years, we
 expect greater use of computers to enable the PLA to
 streamline administration and training tasks-allow-
 ing more efficient use of personnel, equipment, and
 supplies-and improving combat readiness. Increased
 use of computers in military R&D and production will
 contribute to China's ability to design and manufac-
 ture aerospace vehicles and electronic components for
 missile guidance. Poor data communications links will
 slow transmittal of logistic information, however, and
 export controls on design software will impede ad-
 vances in military R&D by forcing Beijing to develop
 the more sophisticated programs required for comput-
 er-aided design (CAD) indigenously.
 ... And for the United States
 The United States is a critical partner in China's
 program to promote the use of computers. Outside of
 Hong Kong-whose computer exports are mainly of
 US or Japanese origin-the United States is China's
 largest single supplier of computer equipment, with
 1985 sales estimated at $130 million. US computer
 equipment enjoys a good reputation for reliability,
 systems compatibility, and servicing ease in China.
 The United States plays a key role in China's efforts
 to develop nationwide computer networks. All of
 China's planned data networks are based on US
 mainframes and minicomputers, although some will
 use Japanese or European microcomputers or commu-
 nications links as well. Despite the general liberaliza-
 tion of US and COCOM export controls for China,
 stringent restrictions apply to sales of networking
 equipment and intercity data telecommunications
 lines. The sale of long-distance data transmission lines
 has been a contentious issue among COCOM allies,
 and the United States faces continued pressure from
 COCOM members as well as Beijing to permit sales
 of this equipment. Beijing might also threaten to
 delay purchases of US computer equipment sought for
 nationwide networks until it appears likely to be able
 to purchase the requisite networking technology as
 well.
 As Beijing strengthens the ties between pur-
 chases and technology transfer, the greater
 willingness among US firms to transfer technology
 could further boost their share of China's computer
 market.

 Priority Areas for Computer Use
 Product Development
 To shorten design time, reduce the possibility of error,
 and cut the hefty costs usually associated with new
 product development, Chinese planners have made
 computer-aided design (CAD) a priority for funding
 during the coming Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90).
 Some of China's highest priorities for using CAD are
 development of layouts for very-large-scale integrated
 circuits and printed circuit boards, and aerodynamic
 testing of airplanes and spacecraft before prototype
 production. China has acquired some CAD technol-
 ogy for design of microelectronics devices from US,
 French, and Japanese firms and continues to seek
 embargoed software for more sophisticated design
 work from these suppliers as well as from Hong Kong.
 building sector.
 Manufacturing
 Vice Premier Li Peng, China's leading spokesman for
 the electronics industry, said in 1984 that China's
 traditional industries should be the first to receive
 computer technology. Li's statements, seconded by
 China's senior leadership, underscored the importance
 of transforming China's dated industrial infrastruc-
 ture to reach the targets of Deng Xiaoping's economic
 modernization program. Industrial use of computers
 in China has grown dramatically over the past few
 years. A tremendous range of applications has been
 reported, including process control in the chemical,
 metallurgical, and textile industries; resource man-
 agement in energy-intensive heavy industries; and
 numerical control of tools used in the machine-
 Enterprise Management
 Medium and small-sized factories are especially look-
 ing to microcomputers to manage personnel records,
 keep track of inventory, and schedule production and
 ordering of supplies. Although the number of factories
 using micros for daily management tasks is not
 known, the relatively low price of microcomputers and
 the simplicity of software design for these applications
 have contributed to an upsurge in demand. The
 economywide emphasis on managerial efficiency has
 spread to military as well as civilian units: Chinese
 newspapers report the PLA now uses microcomputers
 for many of its planning and logistic duties. F7

 Transportation
 To handle the exponential growth in freight and
 passenger, traffic on China's rail lines, the Ministry of
 Railways plans to set up a nationwide computer
 network using up to 300 Digital Equipment Corpora-
 tion minicomputers and large amounts of networkin
 equipment and software.
 The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
 also will be upgrading its reservations and scheduling
 systems with new computers. CAAC signed a con-
 tract with a US firm, Sperry, for a computerized
 reservations system worth $9 million in May 1985. Its
 current system-leased from a French firm-can
 handle 1 million passengers a year; CAAC expects to
 be booking 13 million passengers each year by 1990.
 The Sperry computers, which should be in use by
 early 1986, may also store maintenance records, spare
 parts inventories, and payroll information for CAAC
 and for China's regional airlines.

 Petroleum Exploration
 China's burgeoning oil exploration effort has left the
 country able to process only 15 percent of the seismic
 data it collects. Accordingly, the Ministry of Petro-
 leum seeks at least half a dozen new mainframe
 computers for use in petroleum exploration. Many of
 these are for oilfields only now setting up computer
 facilities, but some are to upgrade data-processing
 centers in place for several years. Hong Kong is one of
 the sites slated to receive powerful mainframes on
 behalf of the Ministry." Petroleum industry leaders
 have also expressed interest in acquiring a US super-
 computer to handle some of the industry's data-
 processing tasks.

 Secret
 Trade and Finance
 To minimize the duplication of imports now occurring
 between cities, China set up a computerized informa-
 tion network to keep records on technology purchases
 by the country's 14 open cities-which account for
 one-third of the country's technology and equipment
 imports. The cities will also be linked to data bases in
 the United States and Canada containing information
 on foreign companies, products, and prices. The Chi-
 nese press reported the network in operation as of
 August 1985, although the reports did not disclose the
 data transmission mode. The sketchiness of the infor-
 mation leaves open the possibility that computer
 printouts are sent manually from city to city, rather
 than via telecommunications links.
 The Bank of China is also in the process of computer-
 izing its transaction-processing system, and has
 bought Hitachi and IBM mainframe computers for its
 head office and half a dozen of its branches. For its
 medium and small-sized branches, the bank reported-
 ly may use more than a hundred Burroughs comput-
 ers-probably built in China under a joint-venture
 agreement between Burroughs, China's electronics
 ministry, and a PRC-backed Hong Kong firm.
 Technical Data Libraries
 China has been subscribing to computerized technical
 data bases maintained in the United States, Canada,
 and Italy for several years, but dissemination of the
 documents obtained has been by mail-hence, ex-
 tremely slow. Recognizing that the absence of an
 adequate system for information exchange has been
 an obstacle to China's technological and economic
 development, China's State Council has given high
 priority to the establishment of a computerized infor-
 mation system for retrieval and dissemination of
 scientific and technical information from foreign and
 domestic journals. Construction of the system's head-
 quarters at the State Science and Technology Com-
 mission's Institute for Scientific and Technical Infor-
 mation in Beijing began last year. At least 16 cities
 will be included in the network, for which China has
 purchased Hitachi mainframes. Chinese press reports
 indicate that computers are already in place in eight
 of the cities
 Strategic Command and Control
 The computers to be
 linked include the IBM mainframes acquired for the
 census, the Honeywell computers supplied to 14 uni-
 versities, and VAX-series superminicomputers made
 by the Digital Equipment Corporation-many ac-
 quired through third-country intermediaries without
 US export licenses or COCOM approval. Because of
 participation in this effort by representatives of
 China's ballistic missile arm-the Second Artillery
 Corps-we believe the network is designed to enhance
 strategic command, control, and communications.
 Chinese officials have probed US Government will-
 ingness to assist with the project.
