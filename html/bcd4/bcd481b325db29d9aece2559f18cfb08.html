 DAILY BRIEF
 I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC
 Communist China: Although Peiping is making a big
 show of firm support for the Soviet Union following the
 summit conference, a People's Daily editorial of 20 May
 contains some indications t at-the Chinese may fear that
 Khrushchev will not maintain, in the long run, his present
 uncompromising attitudEe toward the West. In justification
 of Peiping's pre-summit position, the editorial states that
 the outcome of the conference was no surprise to those who
 view the international situation correctly and are not misled
 by "certain superficial phenomena." The editorial suggests
 the Chinese probably hope to use current developments to in-
 crease their influence throughout the Communist world as
 the most accurate interpreters of Marxist-Leninist theory.

 of the press and by leftists for alleged undemocratic and un-
 parliamentary methods in securing lower-house approval of
 the US-.Japan security treaty.  The vote on 20 May, which
 overrode Socialist violence and a boycott, appears to assure
 final ratification by upper-house action prior to President                  011
 Eisenhower's visit on 19 June. More leftist-sponsored dem-
 onstrations can be expected, and the two Socialist parties
 have said they will continue to boycott the Diet. Kishi's con
 trol of his party will depend on the extent and depth of adverse
 public reaction, which his party rivals will be alert to exploit.

 .III. THE WEST
 Cuba: The Castro government on 18 May ordered that each
 refinery in Cuba for the rest of this year must purchase approx-
 imately 300,000 tons of Soviet crude oil, now arriving under the
 Cuban-Soviet trade agreement This affects three large refin-
 eries--Esso, Texaco, and Shell--which produce about 95 per-
 cent of Cuba's refined petroleum products.  Cuban controls on
 US dollar remittances have been tying up the funds of the oil
 companies, and the Castro regime is using this form of pres-
 to make the companies purchase the Soviet crude for re-
 sure
 fining.  Relations between the Castro regime and the government
 of Venezuela-Cuba's chief source of petroleum--are likely to be
 further alienated by Cuban purchase of competitive Soviet oil.

 *USSR: The main purpose of Khrushchev's speech in East
 Berlin on 20 May probably was to provide assurances that
 despite the collapse of the summit conference and his clear
 intention to maintain harsh attacks on the United States, the
 USSR=does not plan.to abandon its peaceful coexistence line or
 revert- to a hard, "Stalinist" posture toward the non-Commu-
 nist world. Khrushchev appears anxious to demonstrate that
 his detente policy continues to be valid and justified. Although
 the Soviet premier claimed that the breakdown of the Paris
 meeting has given the Soviet Union and its allies a "moral right"
 to proceed without further delay with a separate peace treaty
 with East Germany, he stated that the "status quo" with regard
 to a German treaty and l'Vest Berlin will be maintained until
 another heads-of-government. meeting takes place, which he
 "assumes" will be in six to eight months. Khrushchev's rela-
 tively moderate line in this speech will displease any critics in
 the Communist world who had opposed his peaceful coexistence
 diplomacy and had interpreted his performance in Paris as fore-
 shadowing abandonment of this line.

 Peiping Vindicates Its Interpretation of US Motives
 Despite Peiping's major demonstrations of "firm support"
 for the Soviet Union following. the summit conference, the Chi-
 nese are taking advantage of the conference breakdown to vin-
 dicate their views against accommodation with the West. A
 People's Daily  editorial of 20 May states that the outcome of
 the conference was no surprise to those who view the interna-
 tional situation correctly and are not misled by "certain super-
 ficial phenomena:'
 The Chinese had maintained all along that there had been
 no real change in the American attitude toward the Communist
 world and that the principal task of the bloc was therefore to
 expose the false nature of American peace gestures. A few. days
 before the summit meeting was to convene, Mao Tse-tung had
 implicitly criticized Khrushchev for having "illusions" about
 "US imperialism."
 The 20 May editorial contains some indications that the Chi-
 nese may fear that Khr1uLshchev will not maintain, in the long run,
 his present uncompromising attitude toward the West. In this
 connection, the editorial assesses the summit breakdown as
 "helpful" because it "laid bare" the "ferocious" features of "US
 imperialism" and calls, as did the Chinese in the pre-summit
 period, for further exposure of the United States.
 By emphasizing that the Chinese were right and Khrushchev
 wrong, the editorial suggests the Chinese probably hope to use
 present developments to, increase their influence throughout the
 Communist world as the most accurate interpreters of Marxist-
 Leninist theory.
 That Moscow now is on the defensive can be seen in Soviet
 Ambassador Chervonen:k.o's speech at a rally in Peiping on 20 May.
 "Like other people," he said, "the Soviet people have never de-
 ceived themselves with illusions and have always remembered
 the imperialist intrigues,' On the contrary, People's Daily said
 on the same day, events of the past few days prove misguided
 those who had naively thought that imperialism could be dealt with.

 II. ASIA-AFRICA
 Planned. New Indian Refineries May Receive Soviet Assistance
 New Delhi has announced its intention to construct two
 additional oil refineries during the Third Five-Year Plan
 (1961-66).  The location and the financing arrangements for
 these new government-owned projects were not made public.
 They would presumably be in addition to a medium-size re-
 finery in the Cambay: region near Bombay for which plans
 were announced in April.  Promising oil strikes were recent-
 ly made in that area by bloc technicians under contract to the
 Indian. Government.
 Scheduled visits to Moscow in June by three Indian dele-
 gations led by President Prasad, Finance Minister Desai,
 and particularly K. D. Ma.laviya, Indian minister for mines
 and oil, will afford the Soviet Union an opportunity to expand
 its dominant position in India's oil industry by making further
 offers of assistance.  Moscow is likely to offer to aid in the
 construction of the two new refineries and may also propose
 further Indo-Soviet collaboration in the petroleum industry.
 India will receive some Soviet-refined POL products this
 year under terms of the current Indo- Soviet trade agreement.
 Moreover, Moscow has recently offered "unlimited" quanti-
 ties of crude oil, at discount and for rupee payment--a pro-
 posal which the Indians will be able fully to utilize only when
 they possess their own refineries. In addition, the USSR and
 Rumania are assisting the Indians in construction of two other
 refineries in. eastern India for processing Indian crude oil;
 aid thus far committed to these projects amounts to $40,000,-
 000, about 5 percent of total bloc aid to India.

 Japanese Reaction to Security Treaty Vote
 Most major Japanese newspapers are accusing Prime Min-
 ister Kishi of violating democratic and parliamentary principles
 in forcing lower-house approval of the US-Japanese security
 treaty on 20 May. One paper, however, stressed Japan's need
 for such a treaty under.present world conditions, and another
 paper criticized the opposition Socialists for their resort to vio-
 lence prior to the vote.
 The two Socialist parties are claiming that passage of the
 treaty was illegal and invalid and are now boycotting the Diet
 session.  The governing ~ iberal Democrats, although they have
 enough seats to conduct parliamentary business without the So-
 cialists, are almost certain to undertake negotiations with them
 in an effort-to end the boycott and return to normal procedures.
 A: demonstration led by extreme leftist students broke out
 in the vicinity of the Diet soon after the treaty vote, and some
 students forced entry into the grounds of Kishi's official resi-
 dence. More leftist-sponsored demonstrations can be expected,
 although previous extremist efforts have failed to attract popu-
 lar support.
 The lower-house vote appears to assure final ratification of
 the security pact before President Eisenhower's visit on 19 June.
 The treaty has been referred to the upper house and, even if this
 body fails to vote, approval will be automatic after 30 days. A
 50-day extension of the Diet session assures the necessary time
 period.
 Some Japanese political observers believe that Kishi's chances
 for winning a third term as president of the government party in
 January 1961 have been weakened by the steps taken to obtain ap-
 proval of the treaty.  They note that several of his party rivals,
 including Ichiro Kono, absented themselves during the vote. While
 Kishi's rivals will be alert to exploit any adverse public reaction,
 his control of the party will depend on the extent and depth of such
 popular sentiment.

 ][II.  THE WEST
 American Refineries in Cuba Ordered to Process Soviet
 Crude Oil
 On 18 May, the. Castro regime notified officials of the
 Texaco refinery in Cuba. that for the rest of this year each
 refinery in the country must accept approximately 300,000
 tons of Soviet crude oil, which has begun to arrive in Cuba
 under the Cuban-Soviet trade agreement signed in February.
 This will affect the three refineries-- Texaco, Esso, and
 Shell--which together produce over 95 percent of the petro-
 leum products refined, in Cuba.  These companies have some
 $40,000,000 worth of outstanding requests for dollar remit-
 tances which the Cuban National Bank has not yet approved.
 Cuban controls on US dollar remittances have been tying up
 the funds of the refineries, and the Castro regime evidently
 .is using this form of pressure in an effort to make the com-
 panies accept Soviet crude.  Soviet crude is received by
 Cuba under a barter arrangement, and the refineries would
 not be required to pay for it in foreign exchange.
 Official Venezuelan relations with the Castro government,
 which have grown increasingly cool in recent weeks, are like-
 ly to be further alienated by Cuban purchases of competitive
 Soviet oil. In 1958, Venezuela exported about 75,000 barrels
 a day of oil and refined products to Cuba, about 8 percent of
 which presumably will now be supplied by the USSR.  In a
 front-page editorial, one prominent anti-Castro Venezuelan
 newspaper recently condemned the Soviet-Cuban oil arrange-
 ments.  Venezuela is also facing a potential loss to the USSR
 of a portion of its market for petroleum in two other Latin
 American nations- - Uruand Brazil.

 LATE ITEM
 Khrushchev's Speech in East Berlin
 Khrushchev used his speech in East Berlin on 20 May as the
 occasion for his first major foreign policy statement since the
 collapse of the summit meeting. His main purpose probably was
 to provide assurances that he does not intend to abandon his peace-
 ful coexistence line or revert to a hard, "Stalinist" posture toward
 the non-Communist world.
 Despite his clear intention to mount on all-out propaganda
 campaign to discredit and isolate the United States on. the issue
 of "aggressive and provocative actions" toward the USSR, Khru-
 shchev apparently hopes to salvage as much of his detente policy
 as possible. He stated that he assumes that another heads-of-
 government meeting will take place in six to eight months, and
 declared
 that the
 will do nothing in the interim that might "aggravate
 the international situation and take us back to the dark time of the
 cold war!'
 On the key issue of Berlin, Khrushchev said he had reached
 agreement with East German leaders that, since a summit meet-
