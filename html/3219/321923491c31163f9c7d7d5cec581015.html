THE LONG MARCH 
The Long March left an indelible mark on Mao Tse-tung 
and his comrades. Chiang Kai-shek and various warlords 
harried them across 6,000 miles of China, and only one-
fifth of the group lived to make it to Yenan. Mao spent the 
next 12 years in the Yenan badlands fashioning a revolution 
which brought his Communists to power in 1949. Their 
attitudes today remain deeply colored by the experience.

CHINESE DECISION MAKING: 
THE LONG MARCH AND THE LONG WAR 
Summary 
The men who control China's destiny today are 
veterans of the Long March and the revolution. 
These years molded them and still condition. their 
attitudes toward the struggle they are waging ? 
against the "American imperialists," which they 
think of as the Long War. 
These leaders are acutely conscious of their 
Chinese heritage. This means they are quite 
sure of their own superiority and their duty 
to gain redress for the humiliation China 
has suffered at the hands of foreigners. 
The chief enemy to be overcome is the US. 
- They are also Communists. This means that 
they are predisposed.to totalitarian ways 
- of doing business. This also means that 
they see the world divided into two irrec-
oncilable camps; 
- They are dominated by Mao Tse-tung. He is 
A thorough-going militarist with a history 
of violent conspiratorial activity. This 
makes him and the group around him ruthless 
and tough-minded. 
- They are ambitious to make China a great 
world power. They are old and ailing, yet 
still command only a weak base. This has 
led them to try to do too much, too soon, 
sometimes with.painful results. 
- They have slim resources to parcel out. 
This has meant they cannot simultaneously 
satisfy even the minimum demands of agri-
culture, industry, the military, the party 
machine, and the government apparatus. 
- They see? themselves as virtually alone in 
a hostile world. This has created a Siege 
mentality but has not dimmed their convic-
tion of eventual Victory.

CHINESE DECISION MAKING: 
THE LONG MARCH AND THE LONG WAR 
The Leaders have a Chinese heritage. 
In the first place, the men in Peking are 
acutely conscious of their Chinese heritage. Be-
ing Chinese, they carry a strong conviction of 
their superiority, in race and culture, to all 
foreigners. The Chinese call their country the 
"Middle Kingdom" and for 4,000 years have con-
sidered it the civilized center of the universe, 
surrounded by barbarians. To most Chinese, Chi-
nese art is the finest, Chinese poetry the rich-
est, Chinese food the tastiest, Chinese women the 
most desirable, and so on. 
China is also a dirt poor, agricultural 
country. Most Chinese are peasants whose life 
is nasty, brutish, and short. Life has always 
been cheap, 'the individual counting for little. 
Emphasis is on survival of the family or social 
group. The Chinese peasant lives in small vil-
lages, not in individual farm dwellings. Mao Tse-
tung and his closest collaborators, except for 
the mandarin Chou En-lai, come from this land and 
out of this tradition. It helps make them hard-
bitten and indifferent to suffering. 
They are strongly nationalistic. 
The Chinese have regarded the foreigner with 
disdain ot contempt. After more than a century of 
exploitation by one foreign power after another, 
this turned to hatred. Starting early in the 19th 
century, foreigners came with weapons the Chinese 
could not match. The foreigners, although contempt-
ible, repeatedly defeated the weak Chinese armies. 
China was carved up into spheres of influence, and 
enclaves were set up where the foreigner could live 
on Chinese soil free of Chinese authority. Such 
treatment would leave deep scars on any people. 
It left the arrogant Chinese thirsting for revenge.

Under Mao and the Communists this hatred of 
foreigners has been focused on the US. In their 
eyes, the US sought to keep them from power. The 
US opposed them in Korea and interposed its forces 
to prevent them from seizing Taiwan. It continues 
to support the "renegade" Chiang as the legitimate 
ruler of all China. The US stands between them 
and their larger design of extending their sway 
over the former vassal states surrounding China. 
The US does its best to put down the very revolu-
tions the Chinese support. Most of all, they fear 
that the US means to do them in. China has from, 
time to time suggested that it is permissible un-
der some circumstances to work with certain im-
perialists--but never with the US. 
Though expressed in terms of fundamental Com-
munist principle, Mao's fight with the Soviets is 
heavily nationalistic. In the late 1950s the Chi-
nese leaders became aware that the post-Stalin 
group in the Kremlin would not, any more than Sta-
lin himself, place Soviet power at Mao's disposal. 
Peking could see that the Soviets were dragging 
their feet on giving China nuclear weapons. The 
crowning blow fell in 1959 when Khrushchev went 
to the US and began, in Mao's eyes, to consort 
with the main enemy. Khrushchev stopped off in 
Peking on his way back but no bands played, no 
crowds cheered, not a handshake was offered. 
They are Communists "steeled in struggle." 
As Communists the Chinese subscribe to the 
view that the world is divided into two camps en-
gaged in an all-out struggle which the Communists 
are fated to win. China today is an orthodox Com-
munist state in which the party alone makes policy 
and supervises its execution. The government and 
the armed forces are kept under constant party sur-
veillance. The aim is total control, and in China 
it has virtually been achieved. 
Being rigidly orthodox Communists, Mao and , 
his associates must try to force the non-Communist 
world into the preconceived framework of nineteenth

  MAO TSE-TUNG AND HIS COMRADES-IN-ARMS--
MAO TSE-TUNG 
Ago 72. Party Chairman. Top man since 1935. Health declining, 
often out of public view for months No evidence he is losing control , 
Has never visited a non-Communist country. Understanding of the 
West limited and warped. Gasp of internal affairs may be slipping. 
A supreme egotist, considers himself to be the rightful leader of 
world communism. 
LIU SHAO-CHI 
Age 68. Mao's first lieutenant and his designated successor. A 
frail man, a colorless personality, he may be too weak to hold the 
top position long after Mao goes. 
CHOU EN-LAI 
Age 68, Once the most modelate member of the inner circle, 
reasonably well informed about the outside world. His relative 
moderation seems to be waning as he glows older. Runs the govern-
ment. Has little party strength and little chance to win the struggle 
for succession. 
T?ENG HSIAO-PING 
Age 66. Tough, extremely militant, ambitious: Runs the executive 
arm of the party which puts him in a good spot to take over after 
Mao and Liu go. 
? PENG CHEN 
Age 66. Smooth, capable, and tough. The,most recent entry to 
the inner circle.. Has played a key role in Chinese cont.rontations 
With the Russians. 
LIN PIA() 
Age 58. The only military man in the lot. 
as a !evolutionary field commander. 
Seldom appears in public. Recently credited with 
authoring article affirming Chinese intention to foment "anti-
imperialist" revolutions wherever possible in Asia, Africa, and 
Latin America. 
Has a brilliant record

century capitalism as Marx saw it. This require-
ment, coupled with an almost total lack of personal 
exposure to the non-Communist world, makes them 
parochial men. They do not really understand 
just what it is that motivates Westerners. Mao 
and his associates are the hard-bitten survivors 
of a savage struggle against enemies within the 
party, against the Chinese Nationalists, and 
against the Japanese. In their early years to-
gether they were hunted like animals, and Mao's 
wife died at the hands of Chiang Kai-shek's po-
lice. The party was almost wiped out in 1927. 
Later, in 1934, Chiang forced them to pull up 
stakes and move their base of operations to the 
Yenan caves in the northwest. This was the Long 
March, during the bloody course of which Mao 
seized control of the party. This history of 
prolonged armed struggle has left the leaders 
thoroughgoing militarists. Even political and 
social problems are attacked through military 
concepts, military directives, military organiza-
tion, military discipline. 
They are dominated by Mao Tse-tung. 
Since the Long March, Mao has been paramount 
in the Chinese Communist movement. Only Stalin 
exercised a comparable measure of power. Mao's 
prejudices, opinions, and idiosyncrasies are per-
haps the most important single element in framing 
Peking's policy. For all of his being Chinese, 
Mao is like Stalin in some ways. Like Stalin, 
Mao is a true totalitarian, seeking total control, 
including control of thought, and demanding total 
obedience, including professions of adoration. 
Like Stalin, Mao is vain and cruel, encourages a 
"cult," and relies on exhortation. And like Stalin, 
Mao is less an international than a national Commu-
nist. 
The importance of military force is at the 
center of Mao's world view. He has even said 
that Chiang Kai-shek "did a good thing in mas-
sacring Communists" because this taught them how 
to wage war. He,says, over and over again, "All' 
political power cotes out of the barrel of a gun." 
Thils his foreign policy is distinctively based on

international tension and revolutionary war, and  
he incites these small wars wherever he can. 
  Mao prefers, wherever possible, to 
let others do the fighting and is cautious about 
committing his own forces. Chinese troops poured 
into Korea only when the US advance posed, to 
Mao's way of thinking, a direct threat to China 
and its most important industrial region. More-
over, Mao saw it as necessary to prevent the de-
struction of a neighboring Communist State. 
In Mao's view, talks with the enemy are pos-
sible, even advisable, as a device to buy time or 
gain an advantage. This does not mean that he be-
lieves in real give-and-take negotiations--only 
take, since the real solution is the destruction 
of the adversary. 
Furious with the Soviets, the Chinese today 
assert their pre-eminence in doctrinal matters. 
They see themselves as the only true interpreters 
of the old texts, and Mao as the only Communist 
since Stalin to enrich the doctrine with creative 
additions. The Chinese now speak of the three 
great epochs of modern man--the epoch of Marx and 
Engels, the epoch of Lenin and Stalin, and the 
epoch of Mao Tse-tung. Only Mao has the stature 
to stand alone. 
The combination of Chinese chauvinism and 
Mao's egotism is such a strong force that in re-
cent years he has even changed his basic concept 
that the world is divided into Communist .and im-
perialist camps. Since 1960 he has seen the world 
as divided into those countries responsive to his 
concepts and therefore in his camp, and those antag-
onistic to his views and therefore in the enemy 
camp. The Soviet Union is in the "enemy" camp, 
since Mao regards it as working with the US to 
frustrate and to bring down China.

They are old, ailing and isolated. 
The men at the very top have been together 
for a long time. Mao has been a member of the 
party since it was founded in a back street of 
Shanghai in 1921. So has Chou En-lai. Virtually 
every meaningful post is filled by a veteran of .30 
or more years in theupper levels. Rivalries have 
been submerged or suppressed and may remain so 
until the kingpin is removed. Mao believes 
strongly that the only really trustworthy men are 
those case-hardened through the crucible of revolu-
tion. 
The Chinese leaders are old men. The average 
age of the seven top men is nearly 68. Decades of 
wielding virtually absolute power has left them 
fixed in their ways. Certain of their policies, 
some obviously bad, have been set in concrete by 
the very myth of infallibility they nurture so as-
siduously. They are increasingly intolerant of 
independent thinking outside their tight little 
circle, and Mao may not put up with much debate 
inside. It is hard for new ideas or suggestions 
to penetrate such barriers. 
Mao and his favorites have therefore tended 
to become isolated, like the less successful em-
perors of old./ 
They do not get all the facts they need for their 
own decisions, and have little feel forthe.fac 
tots that enter into policy decisions elsewhere. 
Today the aging Chinese tyrants are in ill 
health and are deeply disturbed about what will 
happen to their revolution when they are gone.  
 /The leaders are plainly fear-
ful about the younger generation, even though 
Chinese Youth has been stuffed with Mao's propa-
ganda since weaning. Mao suspects, and perhaps

with some reason, that once the Long Marchers are 
gone, the locomotive will be removed from the Chi-
nese Communist revolution and it will grind to a 
halt. 
They have vaulting ambitions. 
Mao and his friends have set out to restore 
China to what they regard as its proper place as 
a great power in the shortest possible time. ?They 
started fast in the early 1950s. For the first 
time in decades a sense of unity and purpose was 
imparted to the nation. The people backed the 
regime and with Soviet helpgood progress was 
made. 
Then in 1958 Mao's hubris found expression 
in two extreme programs. The first was the "Great 
Leap Forward" and the other was the commune move-
ment. In the Leap, Mao tried by a massive appli-
cation of manpower and exhortation to achieve a 
radical speedup in economic and military develop-
ment. 
These were heady days for the leaders, who 
for a time thought they had achieved a real break-
through. With "politics in command," the party 
machinery reported what they wanted to hear. 
Statistics showing incredible gains showered in 
on them and were, strangely enough, believed. At 
one point Mao was so impressed with grain produc-
tion claims that he announced a plan to let one-
third of the arable land grow all the grain China 
needed. A crash program for steel production led 
to the follies of the backyard furnaces. Primi-
tive equipment .blossomed in every village and 
city and turned out millions of tons of useless 
slag. 
At the same time Mao ordered that the na-
tion's peasants be jammed into communes. These 
monster collectives embraced 20,000-50,000 souls 
who would (Mao thought), work, eat, and live to-
gether--the sexes properly separated except for 
work heroes on "lucky Saturday night." The com-
munes did not work, but Mao went even further.

He 
He decided that every Chinese male should become 
a militiaman. Dutifully, lists were compiled 
and Peking gravely announced that China had 
200 million militiamen, a figure greater than 
the total number of Chinese males of military 
age. 
These harebrained ventures had by 1960 se--, 
riously weakened Chinese industry and agricul-
ture. At this juncture Soviet help was abruptly 
withdrawn. Disrter followed. China's economic 
and military advance came to a screeching halt. 
The Chinese are only now beginning to emerge from 
the ensuing depression and have yet to come to 
grips with China's basic economic shortcomings. 
They need to get the economy going again. 
Foremost among their weaknesses is the pres-
sure of too many Chinese on existing resources. 
Last year grain output was about the same as in 
the year before the Great Leap. Now there are 
100 million more mouths to feed. 
Agriculture is the critical sector of the 
economy. Shortcomings here are the chief impedi-
ment to the development of a modern economy, Chi.-
nese agriculture requires massive investment and 
new technology. But the top command parcels 
these out in small amounts, preferring tb put. its 
resources elsewhere. The farmers need also to be 
freed from the fetters of the collective system. 
As in other Communist states, the tiny private 
plots allowed the peasantsare far more productive 
than the collective land. But a departure from 
collective farming is unthinkable. Retreat here, 
Mao has said, would inevitably lead to a resurrec-
tion of capitalism. Finally, the situation calls 
for ruthless birth control measures, for which 
Mao long saw no need. He has recently permitted 
a limited program to begin in the cities, but 
even there it is too little and far too late.

They need to improve their military machine. 
Chinese industry took a terrible buffeting 
from the follies of the Leap Forward. It still 
shows idle capacity, wasted manpower, and techno-
logical lags. Resources for investment are so 
scarce, however, that industry cannot be moved 
ahead as a whole. There is not even enough for 
heavy industry alone. Accordingly, competition 
for resources is fierce. The military-minded 
Mao always shows a marked preference for the war 
industries. In recent years he has turned to ad-
vanced weapons. 
/the Chinese nuclear force 
will be taken most seriously by other nations of 
the Far East. Since the ultimate objective is to 
reach the US, Mao will Surely press ahead on an in-
tercontinental ballfstic missile or a nuclear-pow-
ered missile submarine as fast as he can. 
Until this hope becomes reality, Mao must rely 
on his large infantry force. Any war Mao fights 
must be a land war in or near China. Moreover, he 
has to cut his military doctrine to fit this cloth.

So Mao's soldiers are taught that man is superior 
to imperialist weapons. A current slogan runs, "the 
best weapon is not the atom bomb but the thought 
Mao Tse-tung." 
Actually the Chinese leaders greatly fear US nu-
clear strike capability. This fear lies behind the 
deep caution they display. It leads them to avoid 
direct engagement with US forces and wherever pos-
sible to fight their Long War with the US through  
proxies like the Vietnamese Communists. 
They need to reinvigorate their people. 
Mao and his circle face a number of serious 
morale problems at home. Once they had the support 
Of virtually all functionaries, the armed forces, 
and the people at large, but since the Leap Forward, 
that support has fallen away. Disappointed hopes 
lie all about. Peasants are sullen and apathetic. 
The intellectual is alienated. The lower ranks of 
the party and the army are beginning to wonder. 
The sense Of purpose has been lost and the Chinese 
have begun to suspect that Mao, after all, may not 
have the mandate of heaven. 
Mao and the party are still exacting compliance, 
but they have to lean much harder on the people to 
get it. Much of the party's energy is burned up in 
the effort. For example, the party has greatly in-
creased the number of watchdogs spotted all through 
the armed forces and government bureaucracy to 04-
sure that Mao's will is carried out. Mao has had 
experience with disgruntled generals. The last big 
challenge to_him cable in 1959 from a group around  
Defense Minister Peng Teh-huai.\ 
Mao still believes that it is possible to moti-
vate and control people by exhortation. He has

recently launched another of the seemingly endless 
indoctrination drives. This one is backed up by a 
campaign to emulate two synthetic heroes; one a 
"rustproof screw" of the revolutionary machine, 
the second an "all-purpose screw." Both are said 
to have been simple soldiers who, so Peking's ver-
sion goes, martyred themselves for the glory of 
Mao. They are presented as diligent readers of 
Mao's works, which made them frugal, diligent, 
selfless servants of the party. Returns on this 
sort of thing have been diminishing, and it is 
doubtful the leaders will get the success they so 
badly need at home through these tired devices and 
methods. 
They feel besieged by foreign enemies. 
If Mao's outlook at home is dim, it is scarcely 
brighter abroad. The Chinese have absorbed a pain-
ful series of setbacks lately in Asia, Africa, and 
Latin America. Through stupidity and bad timing 
they have managed to turn sympathy into hostility. 
The border war with India alienated a sympathetic 
New Delhi. Bungling during last fall's Kashmir 
war soured the Pakistanis. The Chinese position in 
Indonesia has suffered greatly since the 30 Septem-
ber coup attempt. Japan is more wary and neighbors 
to the south more fearful. Peking's stock in the 
Afro-Asian world and in Latin America has fallen as 
a result of a series of arrogant efforts to force 
acceptance of Chinese positions. And even in the 
most radical part of the Communist world, the circle 
of loyal Chinese followers has been shrinking as 
more and more Communist leaders take exception to 
Chinese self-righteousness. 
Just outside China's back door stands a great 
wall of Soviet hostility. The Chinese can no longer 
count on Moscow to honor its treaty commitment to  
China's defense.f 
 I In 
December 1963 Chen Yi declared that Soviet assur-
ances of  defending China were of no value. Chou En-
lai told that the USSR

would not assist China in the event of an.American 
attack, nor would-Moscow attempt to prevent such an 
'attack. The Soviets have done nothing to reassure 
the Chinese. 
Peering anxiously from Peking, the Chinese 
leaders now profess to see themselves surrounded by 
enemies and threatened by attack. As they formulate 
it, a cabal, led by the US and including the treach-
erous Soviets, the militaristic Japanese, the de-
pendent British, and the running dog Indians, is 
tightening a ring around China. Although this view 
has paranoid elements, there is also a measure of 
truth in it. What Mao does not realize is that he 
has brought this state of affairs on himself. 
? 'Nevertheless, Mao has been in many tight cor-
ners before. He spent more than a decade in the 
caves of Yenan and emerged to destroy the Chinese 
Nationalists-. He remains convinced that his policy 
will again triumph, because, as before,his enemies 
(capitalist and Communist) are soft, stupid, and 
lacking in staying power. 
They have hopes in Vietnam. 
In this time of adversity, the men in Peking 
place great importance on Vietnam. Besides a nat-
ural interest in the outcome of a war so close to 
the China mainland, they feel, as Chinese, that 
Vietnam is an area which rightfully should be under 
their influence. Although the war has brought 
added US power too close for real comfort, it is 
still a confrontation to Mao's liking. It is a 
war against the US being fought by proxies. Mao 
needs provide'only military support and loud po-
litical backing. 
Moreover, it offers a test case for Mao's 
theory on "liberation wars," that is, that small 
wars such as this can be fought and won without 
provoking a US nuclear response against either the 
local Communists or their larger sponsors. This 
idea is part of Mao's dispute with the Soviets. 
As Peking sees it, a military victory in Vietnam 
would deal a heavy blow to Mao's principal enemies, 
the hated Americans and the despised Russians.

For all of the war's importance to Mao, he is 
constrained in what he can do about the outcome by 
the weakness of his military machine and by his 
fear, however he may cloak it, of a US nuclear 
punch against China. He must, therefore, do all 
he can to keep the Vietnamese Communists in the 
fight until the moment comes when the 'US wearies 
of the struggle and gets out. His whole experience 
tells him that this will inevitably happen, if only 
the Communists persist long enough.
