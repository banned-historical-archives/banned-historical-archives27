 Chinese Foreign Policy
 1.   For the past two years Chinese foreign
 policy has been outgoing, adroit, realistic in its
 appraisal of the possible, and carefully shaped to
 the demands of normal state-to-state diplomacy.
 That it has not always been thus needs hardly be
 stressed.  At times Peking has sacrificed diplo-
 matic give and take to strident propaganda, has
 emphasized the primacy of revolutionary activity
 around the world, or has all but sealed itself off
 from normal intercourse with much of the globe.
 Yet even when their rhetoric has been harshest,
 the Chinese have been prudent--even cautious--in
 action.   Their most decisive moves, in Korea and
 along the Indian border, have been, in Chinese
 eyes at least, defensive in nature.   Their wild-
 est flights of rhetoric have generally been a means
 of concealing disappointment or even impotence,
 rather than the prelude to new and impulsive action.
 Their celebration of revolutionary activity has
 largely been confined to the propaganda sphere;
 where material aid has been involved the risks
 have been relatively small.   Indeed, a good part
 of this aid can probably be related to the pres-
 sures of Peking's decade-long duel with Moscow,
 rather than to innate Chinese faith in "revolu-
 tionary possibilities" abroad.
 2.   This does not mean that changes in the
 style of Chinese foreign policy have been unimpor-
 tant.   They have been very real and sometimes very

 sudden.  But the perspective of over 22 years sug-
 gests that these changes have in large part re-
 flected the pressures of domestic Chinese condi-
 tions and politics, although it is unquestionably
 true that they have often occurred in periods when
 Chinese foreign policies appeared to have lost mo-
 mentum and effectivenesr,.  Viewed in this perspec-
 tive, the present style in Chinese foreign policy
 may have quite a long run ahead o  it, since it ap-
 pears to have survived intact the domestic shock
 of the purge of Lin Piao and already has a string
 of international successes to its credit, with the
 prospect of more to come.  This would be especially
 true if the Chinese leaders consider the President's
 visit a success.   Such a success would further en?-
 hance the prestige of Chou En-tai, who is proba:aly
 the principal architect and certainly the principal
 executor of Peking's current approach to foreign
 affairs.   Yet even when the style of Chinese for-
 eign policy has changed, the basic aims of that
 policy have remained constant.   Broadly speaking,
 these include a quest to ensure that China is con-
 sidered and treated as a major power and that its
 views on world affairs are taken into account, an
 attempt to carve out for itself a sphere of influ-
 ence in East and Southeast Asia                             (this is in effect
 a corollary of Peking's drive for Great Power sta-
 tus), concern for national security and protection
 of China's borders, recognition of Peking's irre--
 dentist claims to Taiwan, and, when consistent with
 the aims above, patronage of revolutionary move-
 ments elsewhere in the world.
 3.  These aims are in many respects more gen-
 eral than they are specific.  They are aims which
 for the most part are "national" rather than "rev-
 olutionary" in nature and which parallel the aims
 of other states with Great Power pretensions.  And
 (the "recovery" of Taiwan aside)  they aim primarily
 at the extension of Chinese influence rather than
 at the physical expansion of they Chinese state.
 Moreover, there is a strong elenent of the defen-
 sive in several of the aims.  All this of course
 does not mean that the ideological factor in the
 conduct of Chinese foreign policy can be ignored.

 The Chinese leaders see the world through ideological
 glasses, and the tenses color everything they see.
 They are Communists, and they expect the eventual
 triumph of Marxism as the result of an inevitable
 historical process, althorgh they do not appear
 to have any sort of time frame in mind.   Even
 when their revolutionary rhetoric and Posturin
 have been most
 Ithe Chinese leaders have
 taken a relatively balanced and realistic attitude
 toward both opportunities and dangers.   Peking has
 of course on occasion sacrificed relatively minor
 diplomatic advantages on the altar of revolutionary
 rhetoric--as when Choi in 1964 offende-l newly in-
 dependent African states with his demand for further
 revolution--but lapses of this sort can be best ex-
 plained in terms of China's over-riding concern with
 its rivalry with the Soviet Union.  Mo:.-eover, when
 bilateral relations have been sacrificed  in this
 way, the Chinese have made few,  if any, gains on the
 revolutionary side of the ledger.
 The Soviet Quarrel
 4.  Nearly all of China's long-term interests
 and aims are involved in the dispute with the Soviet
 Union (treated more fully in a separate paper).  Mos-
 cow has been engaged in a campaign to isolate Peking
 diplomatically and to denigrate, its Great Power pre-
 tensions.  As part of this campaign Brezhnev in 1969
 proposed an Asian "collective security pact" clearly
 directed against China--a move that if successful
 would create a Soviet sphere of influence in the
 Chinese back yard.   The Russian military buildup in
 Siberia directly threatens Chinese security and Chi-
 na's northern borders, while Moscow has sought to
 undercut Peking's claims and pretensions in the
 ideological sphere.   There is no visible solution
 to this formidable list of problems, nor is there
 much likelihood that Peking will seek solutions in
 a meaningful way while Mao Tse-tung lives.  Mao is
 personally committed to the quarrel, and on this
 point in particular he demands unquestioning loyalty
 of his associates.   But even if Mao were not in the
 picture, it is hard Lo envision a meaningful rap-
 prochement between Moscow and Peking, although a

 lessening of present tensions is possible.  The
 challenge each country presents to the other is
 very real,  yid there is no way to exorcise the
 common border.
 5.  The dispute with Moscow, then, is a "given"
 in Chinese foreign affairs, and much of Peking's
 diplomacy is organized around this fact.  But the
 Chinese, the weaker of the two parties, have been
 careful to keep the quarrel manageable.  Chou En-
 lai's airport meeting with Kosygin in September
 1969 led to virtual elimination of shooting in-
 cidents along the border, and the subsequent talks
 in Peking have kept tension from boiling up again.
 The Chinese behavior in these sessions--eagerness
 to keep talking but disinclination to negotiate
 outstanding issues--suggests that Peking now be-
 lieves that a Soviet strike agrinst China is not
 likely in the near or middle term.   The Chinese
 obviously do not think they are out of the woods,
 but they appear to believe that the worst and most
 immediate danger is past.   Indeed, their own dip-
 lomatic efforts in the past year and a half have
 been so successful that Peking's international
 "offensive" no longer appears to be merely a re-
 action to Soviet policies but in large measure an
 end in itself--an important step on the road to
 achieving Great Power status.
 An Open Door Policy
 6.   In setting out to counter Soviet diplo-
 matic ploys the Chinese found themselves with
 certain advantages.  Peking had been partly iso-
 lated from the international community since the
 founding of the People's Republic.   The Cultural
 Revolution had deepened that isolation markedly.
 This situation had created such an imbalance
 within the international community that the first
 signs of a diplomatic thaw in Peking encouraged
 a wide variety of governments to explore the pos-
 sibility of improved relations with the mainland.
 These overtures have been met, for the most part.,
 at least half way.  The Chinese have adroitly
 played on the special interests of individual

 countries, emphasizing common interests  (and some-
 t.mes discovering them where they had not existed
 before) and minimizing differences, ideological
 and otherwise.   They have espoused policies of
 less interest to them than to other, smaller na-
 tions--the 200-mile territorial sea limit, for
 example; and they have retailed themes certain to
 receive a warm welcome in many quarters--the need
 for "small and middle sized nations" to resist the
 superpowers, for example.  They have stressed tra-
 c'itional diplomacy and bilateral relations, and
 their overtures to others have been discreet and
 selective, rather than blatant and all-inclusive.
 They have not been universally successful with
 this approach, but their successes have been fre-
 quent enough to build real movement in Chinese
 foreign policy.
 Latin America
 7.  Part of the Chinese effort has been fur-
 ther afield than ever before.  The Chinese have
 now for the first time established two embassies
 on the South American mainland;  several other Latin
 American states are also considering establishing
 relations with Peking.  The Chinese are maintaining
 a low posture now that they are ensconced in Latin
 America ,,and seem perfectly content to allow others
 to come c+_ then.  The negotiations with Argentina,
 for example, have now dragged on for some time.
 Earlier, before the UN vote, the Chinese  appeared
 to be more anxious, and their courtship of Peru
 was arduous in the extreme.  Peking s=tems deter-
 mined to live down its image as a Fomenter of trou-
 ble.  The Chinese have been very correct in their
 bilateral dealinga, they have not encouraged ex-
 tremist movements, and they have even offered loans
 to countries with which they have not yet estab-
 lished diplomatic relations--Ecuador, for example.
 Africa
 8.  Peking is also being very correct t.n Af-
 rica, where it suffered serious setbacks in 1965,
 largely as a result of constant harping on revo-
 lutionary propaganda themes.  This rebuff may have

 been particularly galling because the Chinese had
 accompanied their revolutionary talk by very little
 action, much of which was ineffective.   In any
 event, they appear determined not to make the same
 mistake twice.  't'his tactic has restored them to a
 position roughly commensurate with that of the
 early 1,960s:   Peking now has 20 embassies on the
 continei)t . seven of them established in the past
 15 months,  As in Latin America, the Chinese dip-
 lomatic effort has been discreet and low-keyed,
 but particular emphasis has been placed on liberal
 Chinese grants and loans along with other forms of
 economic aid.   The most spectacular aid project is
 unquestionably the Tan Zam railroad, which will
 eventually link the Tanzanian capital of Dar es
 Salaam with the Zambian copper fields.   This is a
 major project by any standards, and it is partic-
 ularly impressive given the limited nature of Chi-
 nese resources.
 9.  Peking s3erls to be somewhat more active
 in East Africa than it is elsewhere on the con-
 tinent.                                  The Chinese have just granted a large
 loan to Sudan.  They are cultivating Ethiopia as-
 siduously.  They have developed what might almost
 be called a special relationship with Tanzania,
 where they are not only engaged in railroad build-
 ing but also have a virtual monopoly on the train-
 ing and supplying of the Tanzanian armed forces.
 Although this obviously gives Peking a position
 of real importance in Dar es Salaam, the Chinese
 have been almost painfully "correct," being care-
 ful not to give offense to the rather suspicious
 and prickly Tanzanian Government by throwing their
 weight about or by attempting to recruit or in-
 doctrinate Tanzanians on a significant scale.
 Middle East
 10.  The Chinese are also active in the Middle
 East, but this area ranks low on Peking's order of
 priorities.  They have been cultivating Southern
 Yemen for several years and moved quickly to ex-
 ploit Sudanese differences with Moscow last year
 (as. noted above, they have recently granted a large

 loan to Khartoum), but they recognize that they
 can be consistently outbid by the Soviet Union.
 For a time in 1969 and 1970, Peking seemed inter-
 ested in attempting to flank Moscow on the left,
 but it has proved difficult to build a relation-
 ship with the more intransigent and radical Arab
 states, and the Chinese had begun to give up on
 the hopelessly fragmented and impractical feda-
 yeen movement well before it was dealt a body blow
 by the Jordanian Army.   Peking has on several oc-
 casions---most recently this past autumn--engaged
 the Egyptian Government in dialogue, but rapproche-
 ment has invariably foundered on the rock of Egyp-
 tian military dependence on Moscow.
 Europe
 11.  Cultivation of the underdeveloped coun-
 tries, is not new for Peking; cultivation of the
 stat.~:s of Europe is.   Indeed, in some respects it
 would, appear that the Chinese have recently been
 more interested in developments in Europe than in
 the "third world."  This interest is catholic; it
 applies to states in Western as well as in Eastern
 Europe.   It is in Europe that Peking's argument
 that "middle-sized" states have a common interest
 in standing up to the superpowers comes into its
 own.   This theme strikes an especially responsive
 chord in Romania and in Yugoslavia, both at odds
 with the Soviet Union.   Other East European states
 have remained fixed in the Soviet orbit::; tentative
 Hungarian gestures toward Peking were viciously
 slapped down by Moscow last spring.
 12.  The Chinese aim with respect to Eastern
 Europe is transparent:   to bedevil the Soviet Union
 and to distract its attention from the Chinese bor-
 der.   Peking's aims in Western Europe are a little
 more diffuse, but it is obviously mainly interested
 in promoting greater European independence of the
 United Stales.   This helps explain recent, and
 fairly intense, Chinese interest in the Common Mar-
 ket.   But in addition to hobbling and distracting
 the American colossus, China may genuinely see a
 certain limited community of interest with these

 states--Britain and France in particular--which,
 like China, are "great powers" without being super-
 powers.
 South Asia
 13.   Great Power relationships and balance of
 power considerations are even more evident in Pe-
 king's diplomacy toward the Indian subcontinent.
 China's special relationship with Pakistan, formed
 in the mid-1960s as a means of countering Indian
 power and Soviet influence in South Asia, had begun
 to weaken well before the recent war.   Peking dis-
 played great reluctance to offer strong propaganda
 support for Pakistani policy in East Bengal, and
 it had hinted to Islamabad more than a year ago
 that it might soon raise its representation in New
 Delhi to ambassadorial level.   Chinese verbal sup-
 port after hostilities began was rather tardy and
 not nearly as wholehearted as in 1965, and Peking
 showed a notable reluctance to make menacing mili-
 tary gestures toward Ind. a.   In the aftermath of
 the fighting the Chinese have beer less than eager
 to receive President Bhutto, and although they have
 withdrawn their diplomatic personnel from Dacca,
 they appear to have positioned themselves to an-
 nounce recognition of Bangladesh after a suitable
 interval.   The Chinese appear also to have concluded
 that India is unquestionably the dominant power on
 the subcontinent,  and they may draw from that con-
 clusion the corollary that Soviet influence on the
 subcontinent can only be countered by directly com-
 peting in New Delhi. Whether this is possible,
 of course, will in part depend on the evolution of
 Indian attitud':s toward China.
 Southeast Asia
 14.   Closer to home, the Chinese "open door"
 is only partly open.  Relations with Burma, badly
 strained during the Cultural Devolution, have im-
 proved fairly steadily over the past two years and
 are now relatively cordial if not intimate.  Bur-
 mese recognition of Bangladesh does not appear to
 have disturbed Peking.  The Chinese have warmly, but
 still fairly cautiously, responded to gestures by
 Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, and have

 offered some c-estures of good will themselves; trade
 with Malaysia in particular seems destined to pick
 up.   Where major political problems intervene, how-
 ever, Peking has simply remained coldly aloof.  The
 Chinese have ignored ambiguous and half-hearted
 Thai exploratory probes, and they have set such a
 high price on rapprochement with Indonesia that the
 issue is hardly a live one at this time.  Peking
 has had little or nothing to say about Malaysian
 ideas about neutralization of Southeast Asia--ex-
 cept to intensify its cultivation of Kuala Lumpur.
 Asian Allies
 15.   In 1969 Peking set about to repair the
 damage the Cultural Revolution had done to rela-
 tions with both its Asian allies, North Vietnam
 and North Korea.  This had. largely been achieved
 by early 1971, but Peking's recent overtures toward
 the United States have to some degree upset the
 balance again.   The two countries have reacted in
 opposite ways.   Where Pyongyang hopes that the
 evolving relationship between Washington and Peking
 might lead to a change in the Korean status quo
 which North Korea has unhappily accepted for nearly
 20 years, Hanoi fears the visit might result in Chi-'
 nese acceptance of a status quo which North Vietnam
 has been actively trying to change for nearly as
 long a time.  Nevertheless, the relationship between
 Peking and Hanoi, while clearly disturbed, does not
 appear as strained as in 1968, when the North Viet-
 namese firot decided to talk in Paris.  The Chinese
 have gone to considerable lengths to assure the
 Vietnamese that they will not deal behind their
 hacks.  Moreover, Peking is fully aware that if it
 upsets Hanoi too much, it is likely to push North
 Vietnam into the arms of Moscow.
 16.  Pyongyang, on the other hand, is now en-
 gaged in a "mini-thaw" of its own paralleling in
 some respects that of China.   Moreover, Kim Il-sung
 has issued a firm endorsement of the Chinese invita-
 tion to the President; he is the only top Communist
 leader to have done so.  The Koreans clearly expect
 Chinese efforts to gain US agreement to withdraw
 its forces from the Korean peninsula, and the Chi-
 nese have publicly made it clear they will do just

 that.   Peking may suspect, however, that a rapid
 phase--out of the American presence in Korea could
 lead to an increase in Japanese influence in the
 southern half of the peninsula--an undesirable de-
 velopment from the Chinese point of view.

 17.  Chinese attitudes toward Japan are partic-
 ularly complex.  Trade continues to increase, but
 recognition still remains some distance in the fu-
 ture.  The Chinese are bending every effort to hurry
 things along.  They have slightly modified their
 demands and packaged them attractively, and above
 all they seem prepared to deal with the "mainstream"
 faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in-
 cluding Premier Sato's heir apparent, Foreign Minis-
 ter Fukuda.  If, in the process of coaxing the Jap-
 anese into recognition, Peking can whipsaw Tokyo
 and Washington on this and the closely related Tai-
 wan issue, so much the better.  But Chinese calcu-
 lations do not seem to rest on an attempt to drive
 a wedge between the United States and Japan, and
 Peking probably believes that the chances of doing
 so are fairly low.   It is pursuing Japanese recogni-
 tion because Japanese acknowledgement of mainland
 sovereignty over Taiwan would reduce the chances of
 a "one China, one Taiwan" solution to the problem
 of the island's future.   In short, Japanese recogni-
 tion is a means to an end, not an end in itself,
 and normalization of relations does not mean rap-
 prochement.
 18.   In fact, the Chinese consider Japan a
 major foreign policy problem--perhaps their great-
 est problem after the USSR, although one that is
 not likely to become acute for some time.  The Chi-
 nese leaders have not forgotten that Japan and
 China have fought two wars in the past 75 years,
 that Japan and China are natural competitors in
 Asia with Japan far ahead on the economic side of
 the competition, and that Japan like the Soviet
 Union is permanently China's neighbor.  Even as Pe-
 king is wooing Japan in the home islands, it is
 warning against revived Japanese "imperialism" and
 playing on latent fears of Tokyo elsewhere in East,
 Southeast, and South Asia.

 The United States
 19.  The fact that the United States is not
 physically an Asian power seems to be clearly in
 Peking's mind as the President's visit approaches.
 The Chinese appear to think that in practice the
 Nixon Doctrine will mean a less "forward" US pos-
 ture in Asia.  They probably also believe that a
 neo-isolationist mood is gaining strength in the
 United States and that this will result in the US
 Government paying less immediate attention to the
 Far East.   In these circumstances  the Chinese al-
 most certainly feel less menaced militarily by the
 United States, and they probably believe that an
 exploration of general Asian problems as well as
 of bilateral issues is now in order.
 20.  Whether or not an understanding is
 achieved, the very fact that discussions are taking
 place tends to upset the Russians.   This, of course,
 is a major object of the exercise for the Chinese,
 and certainly the overriding consideration when the
 idea of a high-level visit was first mooted.   But
 the Chinese have certainly not forgotten that Wash-
 ington can still menace China without assuming a
 "forward" posture in Asia; moreover, an ideological
 gulf separates the two countries.   Nevertheless, Pe-
 king is making unprecedented efforts to prepare it-
 self and the Chinese populace for  tht President's
 visit, and it clearly considers that high stakes
 are riding on the trip.

 Addendum:   "People's Wars"
 21.   In many respects China has for half a dec-
 ade been disengaging from active material support,
 as opposed to propaganda celebration, of foreign
 revolutionary movements. This disengagement has
 been uneven, but the general trend seems clear.   The
 preoccupations of the Cultural Revolution played a
 large part in this general movement, but since that
 upheaval ended a conscious decision seems to have
 been taken to stand further, back from most forms of
 revolutionary activity.   Such a decision is not in-
 consistent with Maoist doctrine, which claims that
 to succeed true revolutionary movements must rely
 on their own resources.
 22.   The most clear-cut Chinese action in this
 area has been a move to disengage from support of
 "Marxist-Leninist"  (i.e., pro-Chinese)  Communist
 splinter groups in Europe, Latin America, and else-
 where.   The Chinese have disowned such groups, cut
 off any subsidies to them, and have insisted that
 they would not mediate disputes among them.  They
 have also steered clear of most heterodox insurrec-
 tionary groups around the world.  They have pri-
 vately denounced the Tupamaros and similar bands
 in Latin America, they kept hands off last year's
 insurrection in Ceylon, and they have not encour-
 aged self-proclaimed "Maoists" in East B
 ows to the fedayeen movement, but this too has
 been drying up (as is the movement itself, of course).
 On the other hand, Peking continues to give a small
 amount of aid to anti-Portuguese guerrillas based
 in Zambia and Tanzania, mostly in the form of small
 arms and a minimum amount of training.  This seems
 designed to keep Peking's anti-colonialist as well
 as its revolutionary credentials valid.

 23.  The exception to this pattern--and it is
 an important one--is in Southeast Asia.   But even
 in this area the returns are mixed.   The Chinese
 do little or nothing for Communist insurgent move-
 ments in the Philippines and Indonesia, and although
 a radio station broadcasting in the name of the
 Malayan Communist Party exists on Chinese soil, Pe-
 :king is not offering material aid to the insurgents
 in that country.   In the case of the two remaining
 insurgencies--those: in Burma and Thailand--not only
 are there supporting radio stations on Chinese soil,
 but Peking is also actively aiding the rebels, offer-
 ing them both training and arms.   Both  the Burmese
 and the Thai Communist parties have long and inti-
 mate ties with Peking, and some of the leaders of
 each party reside in China.
 24.  The Thai Government has long been hostile
 to Peking and is involved in the Indochina war;
 there is therefore every reason for the Chinese to
 continue to support the insurgents.   In the case of
 Burma, however, a different set of circumstances
 prevail.    Material Chinese aid was first supplied
 the rebels only at the height of the Cultural Revo-
 lution, and Peking and Rangoon have since moved a
 great distance toward rapprochement.   There are
 therefore practical reasons for the Chinese to cut
 off supplies to the insurgents, and for some time
 important Burmese officials believed this was hap-
 pening.   Last month, however, a major, long-drawn-
 out battle took place between the insurgents and
 government forces, indicating that the insurrection
 was very much alive.
 25. There have been signs that a number of
 revolutionary movements have been unhappy with re-
 cent developments in Chinese foreign policy--and
 that the Burmese insurgents in particular resented
 Ne Win's recent trip to Peking, at Chinese invita-
 tion.  The Chinese have evidently been prepared to
 brazen out general left-wing unhappiness over the
 President's visit, but at the same time have shown
 extreme sensitivity about their revolutionary cli-
 ents in Southeast Asia.   Late last spring Chou En-
 lai specifically mentioned the Burmese Communist

 Party when giving voice to this concern.  In short,
 Peking probably is not willing to risk the displeas-
 ure of its clients in the delicate period just be-
 fore the President travels to China.  If, however,
 Peking backs away from "people's wars" even in
 their own back yard, the first signals may appear
 along the Burmese border.
