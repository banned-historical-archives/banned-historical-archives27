 Encounter Pamphlet:         "Khrushchev on Culture."
 Encounter, published in London by the Congress for Cultural
 Freedom, `aas issued a special pamphlet (No.9) containing the text
 of Khrushchev's S March 1963 speech on Soviet culture and other
 matters, together with incisive comments and "notes" by Encounter's
 editors.  This pamphlet is aimed at intellectuals in free world
 countries, and is admirably designed to expose the repressive posi-
 tion of the CPSU in the field of art and literature, as well as the
 attempts of Khrushchev to rewrite Soviet history.  We strongly
 recoiuiend that assets with a capability to circulate matter to edu-
 cated audiences obtain copies of this pamphlet from Encounter,
 25 Haymarket, London SW1, and distribute them.   In some areas it
 may be easier to obtain copies from local affiliates of the Con-
 gress for Cultural Freedom.  We are attaching copies to this
 guidance for selected stations, and will furnish individual copies
 to other stations on request, but cannot supply these paaphlets25X1C1Ob
 It is possible that there may be some relaxation in the Soviet
 cultural line; this could, for example, be decreed at the 18 June
 CPSU Central Committee plenary meeting.   If such a development
 occurs, it will probably result, not only from the resistance of
 the intellectuals themselves, but also from the adverse publicity
 the Soviet line has received abroad, such as this pamphlet.  The
 fact that a Khrushchev speech is open to such adverse exploitation!

 CHRONOLOGY -- COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #5                                                       28 May - 10 June 1963
 May 24 - June 5 - A high-level CPSU delegation led by Presidium
 member Podgorny visited Rumania in an effort to persuade the
 Rumanians to accept the Comecon "socialist division of labor"
 plan for economic integration which would limit the scope of her
 industrial development (in order to concentrate on agriculture).
 Pravda on 31 May published the full text of a speech by Rumanian
 Marty Secretary Ceaucescu during the delegation's 29 May visit to
 the Brasov tractor works which made it clear that the Rumanians
 were remaining adamant in their resistance.  He cited Lenin to the
 effect that the development of heavy industry is obligatory for
 every country building socialism, and went on to say that "equali-
 zation of the level of development of socialist countries is an
 indispensable condition for the construction of Communist society"
 (a Chinese view).  The speeches made by P~odgorny and Rumanian
 First Secretary Gheorghiu-Dej on the eve of the Soviet departure
 the following week -- as published by Pravda on 5 June -- indicate
 that the Soviets had failed to move thanians.  Commenting on
 these and other evidences of Rumanian recalcitrance, New York
 Times Moscow correspondent Topping on 5 June noted thong,
 polemical CPSU letter of 30 March to the CCP had not been published
 in full in the Rumanian press.  The New York Times of 8 June
 carried a round-up by its Washington correspondent, M.S. Handler,
 of "information (which) has reached the US Government of a growing
 dispute in the Soviet bloc over economic integration and trade re-
 lations.  The quarrels are said to far surpass the recently reported
 disagreement between Rumania and the Soviet Union."  Handler des-
 cribed primarily Czech and Rumanian problems, but he wrote that
 Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria were also involved.
 May 20 - The extent of the CCP's wooing of foreign support is iradi-
 catec by the following one-day listing of NCNA announcements:
 --         a Peking banquet to welcome "a delegation of young
 Japanese lawyers" which was "marked by the militant
 friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples...."
 --         a Peking banquet for a Bolivian delegation which
 had arrived from Pyongyang.   (NCNA subsequently
 reported that at the farewell reception for the
 Bolivians on 4 June, the leader stated:   "We
 Latin Americans are prepared to carry out a pro-
 tracted and arduous struggle like the Chinese
 people did.")
 -- a Peking interview with "the head of the visiting
 delegation of the National Union of Angolan Work-
 ers," who said that "armed struggle is the only
 way shown us by history to win national liberation
 and freedom."

 is "the secretary for research and information
 of the Uganda People's Congress."
 --  a joint communique signed in Bamako 18 May be-
 tween the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 and the National Union of Mali Workers, and the
 return of the Chinese delegation after their
 Visit to Mali, Guinea and Ghana.
 --  the arrival in Peking of the "first general sec-
 retary of the General Confederation of Labor of
 the Congo."
 --  the departure from ?eking of "the delegation of
 the Union of Working Youth of Albania."
 --  the arrival of the "general secretary of the
 Ceylon TU Federation" in Peking.
 --  the departure of "the delegation of the Arab
 Federation of Labor."
 --  the departure of a "senior research worker" of
 the Nkrunah University of Ghana.
 --  a banquet for the Indonesian secretary of AAPSG.
 --  the travels in southern China of the Indonesian
 CP delegation which had attended the May Day
 celebration in 'eking .
 --  the return from Japan of a Chinese Buddhist
 "good will delegation."
 --  the return of two Chinese TU delegations from
 Albania and Cuba, respectively.
 --  the return of the Chinese Communist Youth dele-
 gation from Cuba.
 June 5 - In contrast to the Soviet difficulties with their European
 n, :=. the Chinese apparently are having it their way with the
 North Koreans.  NK Presidium President Choe Yong-kon (Choi Yong Ki.n)
 and entourage ,,rent by special train to `Peking "for a friendly visit
 at the invitation of Liu Shac-chi,,, as NCNA out it, with "tumultuous
 ovations" at the stations in Antung and Shenyang on the 5th and a
 "tremendous" welcoming ceremony and procession in the capital the
 following day.  Although Liu's welcoming speech at the Peking sta-
 tion (and also the ''people's Daily editorial of that day) strosse:i
 their joint efforts in combatting modern revisionism and safeguard-
 in  unity, Choe made no mention of these subjects in his response.

 At a banquet that evening, however, Liu returned insistently to
 that theme:   "To safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, the
 Korean Workers ?arty has wages  an irreconcilable struggle against
 modern revisionism... an    army upheld    e unity of the soca.a ist
 camp and of   e international Communist movement...."  Choe took
 his cue this time:   "Today the parties and peoples of our two
 countries, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, are closely
 united in waging a resolute struggle against imperialism and
 revisionism...',"  He concluded with what might be taken as a pledge
 and a threat -- to whom it may concern:   "No matter what storms
 may rise, our people will forever fight together with the    inese
 people and forever remain their loyal comrades-in-arms."  And by
 the time Choe addressed the rally of 100,O03 in Peking on 8 June,
 he was hammering away at revisionism in the best Chinese (or even
 Albanian) manner, including passages such as the follV=ping:
 "The revisionists are cunningly attempting to kill the
 revolutionary spirit of the Marxist-Leninist theory,
 paralyze the revolutionary consciousness of the popular
 masses, and undermine the socialist camp from within.
 They are serving the imperialists .... He one has the
 right to violate at will this prescription  ? he $  0
 Moscow  tatemen  which  prescribed it as an essential
 task of all Marxist-Leninist parties to expose the
 Yugoslav revisionists and fight against the infiltra-
 tion of their anti-Leninist ideology").... Only through
 a determined struggle against revisionism came
 genuine unity and solidarity o the soc alist camp and
 the world Communist movement be safeguarded .... Marx-
 ism-Leninisma has been attacked not only once or twice
 by opportunists and revisionists of all hues....Today
 the modern revisionists are again frantically challeng-
 ing Marxism-Leninism .... There is no shadow of doubt that
 the modern revisionists will meet the same fiasco as
 their predecessors."   (All underlining ours)
 June 6-9 - Columns written in Be1?ra:de on 6 June by New York Tines
 correspondent Binder and on 9 June by the London Observei s obert
 Stephens (also published by the Washington Post on June      des-
 cribe Yugoslav wariness and uneasiness over te 5 July CPSU-CC'S
 talks, caused in part by Pravda's omission of certain passages of
 Tito's 13 May speech, especiallythe sentence which said:
 "Any compromise or unprincipled agreements at the
 expense of others, or at the expense of the funda-
 mental principles on which the contemporary struggle
 for Socialism rests, would do great harm to the work-
 ino-class movement.''
 The official Yugoslav line (Stephens wrote) is that Khrushchev will
 survive and will not give way to Chinese pressure on any basic
 point of his coexistence policy.  The Yugoslavs believe that the
 Chinese are not looking for a compromise and intend to use the
 meeting to press their offensive against Khrushchev, while the
 Soviets are trying to find a 'formula for a paper compromise that

 would reduce Chinese pressure and free Khrushchev's hands to resume
 negotiations with the US.  There will be no oven divorce between
 Peking and Moscow but a continued unhappy marriage, in which
 Khrushchev may find it more difficult to push ahead with negotiations
 with the US, but he will not gc backwards.  Nevertheless, as "one
 of the most influential Yugoslav journalists" is quoted as saying,
 "...vie should have learned by experience that you can't trust the
 Russians too far."
 June 10 - NCNA released in English their account of the 27 May North
 Crean Party organ Nodong Sinmun article reacting to the 18 May Tito
 speech to the Yugoslav - enur~i  rientioned in our last Chronology)
 As described by NCNA, the Korean attack on Tito and the modern revi-
 sionists is almost as harsh and vicious as the language used by the
 Albanians.  The Tito report "constitutes one more outstanding 'feat'
 in the service of the imperialists."     It is "marked by its aim to
 scww discord and enmity among Communist parties, split the Socialist
 camp and disorganize the ranks of the international Communist move-
 ment, while cunningly covering up all their crimes co  ittedu in the
 past against the international Communist and working class movement
 and their anti-Marxist, revisionist policy."

 21 mai - 5 juin:  Une delegation de membres importants du Parti communique de 1'U-
 n.ion sovietique s'est rendue en Roumanie sous la conduite de Podgorny, membre du
 Presidium, dans le but de persuader lea Roumains h accepter le plan du Comecon sur
 la "division du travail socialiste" dans une integration economique qui limiterait
 le developpement industriel roumain (afin que ce pays se concentre sur 1'agriculture
 La "Pravda" du 31 mai a fait parattre en entier un discours du Secretaire du Parti
 'oumain Ceaucescu, prononce lors de la visite faite par la delegation le 29 mai h,
 l'usine des tracteurs de Brasov, discours d'ot l'on pouvait tirer la certitude que
 lea Roumains restaient intransigeants dans leur resistance.  Ceaucescu cita la de-
 claration de Lenine selon laquelle le developpement de 1'industrie lourde etait 0-
 blogatoire pour tout pays en train de construire le socialisme, et alla jusqu'h dire
 qu'une egalisation du niveau de developpement de pays socialistes "constituait une
 F,ondition in4ispensable dans la construction de la societe communiste (ce qui re-
 presente une opinion des Chinois).  Les discours que, la semaine suivante, Podgorny
 et le Premier-secretaire roumain Gheorghiu-Dej faisaient h la veille du depart des
 Soviets ont subi un echec dons leur tentative de convaincre lea Roumains.  Dans ces
 commentaires sur ces marques d'opposition roumaine, ajoutees h bien d'autres, le
 correspondant du "New York Times" a Moscou, Topping, soulignait le 5 juin qu'une
 longue lettre de lolemique adrescee le 30 mars par le Parti communiste de 1'Union
 Sovietique au Parti communique ch.inois, n'a pas ete publiee in extenso dans lea
 journaux roumains.  Le "New York Times" du 8 juin donnait un compte-rendu de nouvel
 lea recueillies par M. S. Handler  son correspondant a Washington, nouvelle qui "e-
 tait parvenue au gouvernement des Etats-Unis et qui indiquait qu'une controverse
 s'etendait dans lea pays du bloc sovietique au sujet de l'integration economique et
 des relations commerciales.  D'aprbs ce que l'on dit lea querelles depassent de loin
 le desaccord entre la Roumanie et l'Union sovietique dont ii a ete question recem-
 ment."  Handler a surtout traits des problemes tcheques et roumains mail it precisa
 que la Pologne, la Hongrie et la Bulgarie se trouvaient egalement impliquees.
 28 mai: Pour juger des efforts qu'accomplit le Parti communiste chinois dans le but
 ale s'assurer des soutiens dans lea pays strangers, i1 suffit de consulter la liste
 suivante d'informations que 1'Agence de presse de la Chine nouvelle a fait paraTtre
 en une seule journee:

 vocats.,;aponais," qui se passa "sous le sign de l'amitie militante entre lea

 clara:"Nous. Sud Americains, nous sommes pr6ts a mener une lutte aussi a3~due
 et aussi prolongee que celle qu'a menee le peuple chinois.")

 des travailleurs angolais," qui a declare que "l'bistoire nous montrait que

 5 juin:  Alors que lea Soviets eprouvent des difficultes avec leurs voisins europdens
 lea Chinois de leer c$td semblent obtenir gain de cause avec lea Coreens du nord.
 Choe Yong-kon (Choi Yong Kim), president du Presidium de is Corde du Nord, accom-
 pagnd de tout un entourage, s'est rendu par train special h Pdkin "en visite amicale
 1'invitation de Liu Shao-chi," et ainsi que le declare l'Agence de la Chine nou-
 velle, it fut salue "par des orations brillantes" aux arre^ts de Antung et de Shenyang
 le 5 juin, et par une cdrdmonie "formidable" de bienvenue et une procession dens la
 capitale le jour s .avant.  Bien que dans un discours de bienvenue prononcd h la gare
 de Pekin (et reproduit le jour mae dens un editorial du Quotidien du Peuple), Liu
 ait soulignd leur effort commun tendant h combattre le rdvisionnisme moderne et h
 protdger 1'unitd, Choe de son c t  ne fit aucune allusion   ce sujet  ans sa rdponse.
 Le soir mime an banquet, Liu revenait cependant avec insistence sur le theme:"pour
 sauvegarder la purete du marxisme-leninisme, le Parti des travailleurs coreens a me-
 nd une lutte irreconciliable contre le rdvisionnisme moderne... et a soutenu avec
 fermete l'unitd du camp socialiste et du mouvement communists international..."
 Cette fois-ci Choe comprit l'allusion et declara:"Aujourd'hui, lea partis et lea
 peuples de nos deux pays portent haut la bannidre du marxisme-leninisme, et sont d-
 troitement unis dans une lutte resolue contre 1'impdrialisme et le?rdvisionnisme...!"

 se trouvait ddjh en pleine attaque du rdvisionnisme dens le meilleur style chinois
 (mine albanais) qui contenait des declarations comme celle qui suit par exemple:

 de malaise au sujet des entretiens des partis communistes sovietiques et chinoia

 phrase suivante:
 "Tout compromis ou tout accord sans?$crupules aux depends des autres,
 ou aux depends des principes fondamentaux sur leaquels repose-.,:la lutte
 actuelle pour le eocialiste ferait un tort dnorme au mouvement de la

 Le point de vue yougoslave (dcrit Stephens) eat que Khrouchtchef parviendra . sur-
 vivre et ne cedera aux pressions chinoises sur aucun des points fondamentaux de sa
 politique de coexistence:  lea Yougoslaves estiment que lea Chinois ne cherchent pas
 h parvenir h un compromis, et qu'ils out 1'intention de profiter de la reunion pour
 pousser leur offensive contre Khrouchtchef, alors que lea Soviets sont h la recherche
 dune formule de compromis fictif, qui attenuerait la pression chinoise et redonne-
 rait h Khrouchtchef lea mains libres pour reprendre sea negotiations avec lea Etats-
 Unis.         I1 n'y aura pas de divorce public entre Pekin et Moscou, mais une continuation
 d'un mauvais mariage, au cours duquel Khrouchtehev risque de s'apercevoir qu'il eat
 plus difficile d'aller de l'avant dans lea negotiations avec lea Etats-Unis, sans
 que pour cela it ne se decide de faire marche arrihre.  Cependant, pour citer "un

 24+ Mayo - 5 Junio: Una delegaci6n de alto nivel del PCUS encabezada por Podgorny,
 miembro del Presidium, fue a Rumania en una tentativa de persuadir a los rumanos
 a que aceptaran el plan del Comecon de "divisi6n socialists del trabajo" para
 is integraci6n econ6mica, el cual limitaria la amplitud del desarrollo econ6mico
 de diche, naci6n (haciadolo con".cntrar el la agricultura).  "Pravda" el 31 de
 mayo public6 el texto compieto de un discurso pronunciado por Ceaucescu, secre-
 tario del PC rumano, durante is visits de is delegaci6n a la fdbrica de trac-
 tores de Brasov en el que puntualiz6 que los rumanos permenecian f&rreos en su
 resistancia.  Ceaucescu hizo cita de Lenin en el sentido de que el desarrollo
 de is industria pesada es obligatorio pars todo pals que estd construyendo el
 socialiemo, s aciendo que "la igualizaci6n del nivel de desarroilo de los
 passes socialistas es una condicibn indispensable para la construcci6n de is
 sociedad socialista"' (opini6n china).  Los discursos pronunciados par Podgorny
 y por el primer secretario Gheorgiu-Dej del Partido rumano estando a panto de
 partir la delegac16n la semano siguiente -- segdn los publicara "Pravda" el 5
 de junco -- indican que los sovidticos no consiguieron hacer cambiar a los
 rumanos.  Comentado sobre este y otros comprobantes de la tozudez rumana, el
 "New York Times" public6 el 5 de ,junco un informe de Topping, su corresponssal
 en Mosed, que hacta notar que la prensa rumana no habia publicado integramente
 is larga y pol4mica carts del PCUS del 30 de marzo dirigida por el PCUS al
 Partido chino.  El "New York Times" de 8 de junco public6 un reportaje pox su
 corresponsal en Washington, M. S. Handler, sobre "datos (que) han liegado al
 Gobierno de los EE. UU. sobre una creciente disputa en el Bloque sovi6tico con
 respecto a is integraci6n econ6mica y las relaciones comerciales.  Se dice que
 las rencillas sobrepasan por mucho el desacuerdo entre Rumania y las Uni6n
 Sovi6tica informado recientemente."  Handler se refiri6 mayormente a los pro-
 blemas checo y rumano, pero declar6 que Polonia, Hungria y Bulgaria tambi6n
 estaban inmiscuidas.
 28 Mayo: El punto hasta el eual el PC chino estd tratando de ganarse el apoyo

 5 Junio;  En contraste con las dificultades que tiepen los sovi6ticos con sus
 vet nos europeos, los chinos parece que se est&n saliendo con las suyas con los
 norcoreanos.  El presidente Choe Yong-kon (Choi Yong Kim) del Presidium norco-
 reeno y su sequito viajaron en tren a Pekin "en visita amistosa a invitaci6n
 de Liu Shao-chi," segdn Sinjua, con "ovaciones tumultuosas" en las estaciones
 de Antung y Shenyang el dia 5 y una "tremenda" eeremonia y procesi6n de bien-
 venida en is capital al dia siguiente.  Aunque el discurso de bienvenida de
 Liu en la estacion de Pekin, (asi como el editorial del "Diario del Pueblo"
 el mismo dia) pusieron 6nfasis en sus esfuerzos conjuntos combatiendo el revi-
 sionismo moderno y asegurando is unidad, Choe en su respuesta no hizo mention
 de estas materias.  En un banquete en is noche del mismo dia, Liu volvi6 in-
 sistentemente a is carga:  "Para resguardar la pureza del marxismo-leninismo,
 el Partido Coreano de los Trabajadores ha mantenido una lucha irreconciliable
 contra el revisionismo modern ... y firmemente sosten do  a unidad del cameo
 socialists y del movimiento comunista international ..."  Esta vez Choe oy6 al
 apuntador y manifest6:  "Hoy los Partidos y pueblos de nuestros dos palaes,
 enarbolando la bandera del marxismo-leninismo, est6n estrechamente unidos lu-
 chando resueltamente contra.el imperialismo y el revisionismo ..."
 Concluy6 con to que se podria interpretar como compromiso o amenaza -- a quien
 interese:  "No    orta au 6 tormentas surjan, nuestro pueblo luchard'eternamente
 junto al pueblo chino y por siempre permanecerd como su leal compaflero de armas."

 corresponsal Binder del "Nev York Times" y el 9 de junio por Stephens del
 "Observer" de Londres (reproducido por el "Washington Post" el 10 de Juriio)
 se describe la cautela e inquietud de los yugoslavos con respecto a Ras con-
 versaciones de 5 de Julio entre el PCUS y el Partido chino, debido en parte
 a la omisidn en "Pravda" de ciertos pasajes del discurso de Tito de 18 de mayo,
 especialmente la frase siguiente:
 "Cualesquier componendas o acuerdoa faltos de principio a expensas de
 otros, o a expensas de los principios fundamentales sobre los cuales
 descansa la lucha contempordnea por el socialisto, haria grave daZo al
 movimiento obrero,"
 La linea oficial yugoslava (escribid Stephens) es clue Kruschev se aalvard y
 no cederd ante ninguna presi6n china en ning6n panto bdsico de au polftica
 de coexistencia.  Los yugoslavos creep que los chinos no estdn buscando com-
 ponendas y tienen intenci6n de aprovechar la reuni6n pars proseguir la ofensiva
 contra Krusehev, mientras que los sovi6ticos estdn tratando de encontrar una
 f6rmula pars una componenda "de papel" que disminuya la presi6n china y desate
 las manos de Kruschev pars recomenzar las negociaciones con los Estados Unidos.
 No habrd divorcio abierto entre Pekin y Moscu sino que continuard un matrimonio
 desdichado, en el cual Kruschev puede encontrar mds diflcil seguir adelante con
 las negotiations con los Estados Unidos, pero no retrocederd.  Peso a todo eso,

 368.  Castro's Mission to Moscow
 BACKGROUND:   In the same mysterious manner in which he made
 the trio the Soviet Union 37 clays earlier, Cuba's Fidel Castro
 climbed aboard a Soviet TU-114 in Murmansk on 3 June, waved good-
 bye to Premier Khrushchev and headed for home.  No officials were
 on hand at Havana's airport to greet him.  He phoned the President
 to announce his return and took a taxi (for which he and his com-
 panions had no money to pay the fare) into the city.
 His solitary return was in sharp contrast to the crowds he
 had met at every turn in his tour of the Soviet Union.  For 37 days
 Castro had walked the "red carpet."  He had spent long hours with
 Khrushchev, talked with other top Soviet leaders, visited most of
 Russia's major cities, toured factories, military bases, farms and
 schools and been lionized by large crowds at a series of banquets,
 receptions, rallies and parades.
 In Moscow he received, according to the New York Times (5 May),
 "the biggest welcome the Soviet capital has accorded  a foreign
 visitor."  At the traditional May Day parade in Red Square he stood
 next to Khrushchev and waved as the quarter of a million marchers
 chanted "Fidel-Khrushchev" during their five-hour march.  He was
 given the title "Hero of the Soviet Union" -- the USSR's highest
 award, very seldom given to foreigners -- and the Order of Lenin
 and the Gold Star Modal.
 Moscow had had little to cheer about in recent months:   Castro b
 trip had boosted sagging Soviet morale, added luster to his own tar-
 nished reputation and strengthened Khrushchev's position for the
 5 July Sine-Soviet discussions.  When Havana Radio announced his
 return an hour after his plane landed, ships, trains and factories
 blew their whistles, special editions of newspapers hailed his
 return.  Anticipation mounted for his promised report to the nation
 on the results of his 37-day mission to Moscow.  On 4 June he re-
 ported via radio and television in a three-hour, 3C-minute "inter-
 view" with a panel of three newsmen.
 Castro's Report.  Castro's version of "meet the press" was a
 rambling, u sae n ec  informal talk.  He deferred answering several
 direct questions and displayed irritation with members of the panel
 for their attempts to question him even in general terms.  He was
 irritated by noises, by the mumbles of translators and by reactions
 of the studio audience.
 Castro was effusive in his praise of things Soviet and highly
 critical of his fellow Cubans and their version of a socialist
 state.   The Soviet, he said, had many "green areas" in tlir cities;
 Cuba had "very little ... we do not even have a single tree."  The
 Soviets had many forms of transportation and a subway system; Cuba
 has only one type of transportation.  The Soviets have a one-class

 industrious society; Cuba has too many bureaucrats -- "everybody
 is a volunteer in the front rank in demanding things but everybody
 hangs back when it comes to producing."
 "A visiting Cuban feels  a little ashamed," Castro said, "be-
 cause we have not given the economy all of the importance it merits
 ...*   we agitate a great deal, we mobilize ourselves too much...
 but it seems a little as if we build all of that in the air -- that
 is, without taking into consideration that everything must have a
 basis, an absolute fundamental basis, which is the economy.  We 'feel
 somewhat ashamed because we have many comrades who ... do not even
 know that there is an economy."
 In what could have served as a commentary on his report, Castro
 said:   "Vie tend to eulogize and to become apologetic.  We are
 extremely confused.  We go from one extreme to the other.  We do not
 interpret everything right."
 Castro reserved his most effusive praise for Khrushchev, "a
 great leader and a formidable adversary of imperialism."   His
 "magnificent impression of Comrade Khrushchev" included:   "extra-
 ordinarily human character," "simple man of great simplicity," "a
 hard worker, very well organized," "extraordinarily intelligent man,"
 "extraordinary mental energy," "complete mental lucidity... mental
 agility, quick thinking," "a most honorable man."  "He is," Castro
 declared, "without a doubt one of the most brilliant intellects that
 I have ever known ...  He is a veritable authority on economic
 problems.   He talks with the authority of one who knows the problems
 of agriculture, of industry, of the economy."  And, Castro concluded,
 "he perfectly combined his profound theoretical knowledge with great
 practical experience."
 Castro reported that he did not go to seek economic aid but
 that Khrushchev "took the initiative" in suggesting that the Soviets
 pay more for Cuba's sugar.   (The Soviets pay 4  a pound under an
 earlier agreement; Castro reported that Khrushchev proposed an
 increase of one third, to 60 a pound.  The current free market price
 is about 120 per pound.  Castro did not mention the latter figure
 but called Khrushchev's offer "a very great contribution.")  He also
 said that Khrushchev took a personal interest in Cuba's cane-cutting
 problems, provided "a number of ideas on what the machine should be"
 to solve these problems, mobilized "all Soviet technology and indus-
 try" to develop it and promised that "within two years the matter of
 mechanizing the cane harvest would be completely taken care of."
 With all his praise of things Soviet and criticism of things
 Cuban, Castro did note one specific offer he made to Khrushchov as
 Cuban socialist aid to the land of the Bolshoi Ballet and great
 musical traditions -- to "send some instructors;  ... dancing
 teachers ... or music teachers could help them."

 The major theme of Khrushchev's speech was that the Castro
 regime should concentrate on consolidation and economic development.
 He made bellicose statements about defending Cuba from imperialist
 aggression, but there was no indication of a formal Soviet-Cuban
 defense pact.  He indicated his support of caution and easing of
 tensions to avoid provocations of the US.  Above all, the speech
 reflected the importance attached to Castro's visit as a symbol of
 Cuban support of the USSR in its confrontation with Communist China
 -- a solidarity designed to refute Chinese charges that the Soviets
 abandoned Cuba and backed down before the "paper tiger."
 Castro's response reflected the same sort of praise for the
 USSR and Khrushchev which he included in his report to the Cuban
 people.  He declared Cuba's desire to live in peace and maintain
 friendly relations with all countries including the US.   (In a ges-
 ture to demonstrate his sincerity he offered to renew trade with
 the US maintaining that the American people suffered because they
 could not obtain Cuban tobacco and will find it harder to get sugar
 this year.)  He made an oblique reference to Sino-Soviet differences
 by pleading for unity in the socialist camp -- "Unity of the inter-
 national Communist movement is the slogan of all Marxist-Leninists."
 While the joint communique said Castro and Khrushchev had agreed
 upon "measures for the further development of economic, trade, and
 scientific-cultural relations," it did not describe any such agree-
 mients or reveal any new Soviet commitments.  The communique did state
 that the price the Soviets would pay for Cuba's sugar was being
 adjusted "so as to bring this price in line th the level of world
 prices," leaving the impression the Soviets would meet the l2a;-a-
 pound world price.   (There are indications the Soviets do not even
 intend to honor the cut-rate v~-a-poun;l price Castro revealed they
 would pay.  The Soviets have no need for Cuba's sugar and reportedly
 were re-selling it at higher prices and it is reported that they have
 released their claim to one million tons of sugar to allow Cuba to
 sell it on the world market.  This, in effect, will reduce the
 subsidy that the Soviets have to pay to maintain Cuba.)
 The communique appeared to endorse the Soviet position on the
 adlvantages of "peaceful coexistence" in promoting Communist in-
 fluence and the "struggle for socialism."  But at the same time,
 Khrushchev made militant remarks about the Soviet "international
 duty" to aid other Communist parties and so-called "national lihor-

 "What does it mean to render help to the national liberation
 movement?"  Khrushchev answered his own question in his 23 May
 speech:   "It means, first of all, to struggle against the inter-
 ference of imperialism in the internal affairs of peoples of the
 liberated countries, to lend all-cut support, including supply of
 arms, to the peoples who are waging a just struggle against the
 foreign yoke."

 669.  The Outlook for the Sino-Soviet Meeting of 5 July 1963
 U ACKGROUND :
 A meeting is arranged.  On 21 February 1963, the Kremlin
 proposed in an open letter to Peking an official discussion on the
 unresolved questions between the CPSU and the CCP.  The Chinese
 Communists replied on 9 March, agreeing to the meeting, but sug-
 gesting that it be held in Peking with Khrushchev attending.  The
 Chinese also suggested that the agenda give priority to the strat-
 egy and tactics of revolution and to opposing imperialism and
 defending world peace.  Neither the form of the Chinese agenda nor
 the suggestion that Khrushchev come as a penitent  to Peking can
 have been very attractive to the Soviet leader:   on 30 March
 Moscow sent another message, suggesting that the agenda emphasize
 "the further strengthening of the might of the world socialist
 system and its conversion into the decisive factor of the develop-
 ment of human society," and next to that, questions of struggle
 for peace and peaceful coexistence; the Soviets also proposed
 that Mao come to Moscow for the meeting, to be held on 15 May.
 On 9 May, the Chinese proposed postponing the meeting until the
 middle of June,  and on 11 May the Soviets answered, suggesting a
 further delay until 5 July.  The meeting is now scheduled to be
 held in Moscow, but neither Mao nor Khrushchev will attend.  The
 Soviet delegation is to be headed by Mikhail Suslov, the veteran
 Soviet ideologist, while Teng Hsiao-ping, General Secretary of
 the CCP Central Committee is to lead the Chinese representatives.
 The mere recital of this background shows the difficulty in
 bringing about the Sino-Soviet meeting.
 Attempts to build support.   As the time for the Sine-Soviet
 meeting in Moscow approaches, it is difficult to see any signs
 of a desire to compromise on either side.   Evidently one of the
 main reasons why the Soviets so ardently wooed Castro during his
 prolonged visit to the USSR was that they wished to commit him
 firmly to their camp,  as opposed to the Chinese Communist camp.
 Thus, the Soviets saw to it that the joint Soviet-Cuban communi-
 que of 23 May gave strong support to the Soviet position on
 peaceful coexistence, the dangers of nuclear war, the impossi-
 bility of exporting revolution, and the need to stress economic
 development.                                                  In his fare-  25X1C10b
 well speech to Castro, made also on 23 May, Khrushchev seemed to
 be hitting at the Chinese when he said:
 "It is necessary to fight resolutely against any division
 of the revolutionary forces under any pretext.  Non-class
 division by continent, color of skin, or any other standard,
 means a division of the forces of the working class."

 Meanwhile the Chinese have not been idle.   As if in answer
 to the Soviet-Cuban communique of 23 May, a joint statement of
 the CCP and the New Zealand CP of 25 May emphasized that reliance
 on peaceful coexistence as a means to bring about a peaceful tran-
 sition to socialism was "a modern version of social democracy,"
 and the joint statement also condemned acts of "adventurism and
 capitulationism," as the Chinese describe Soviet policy in Cuba.
 On 15 May, while touring in North Vietnam, Liu Shao-chi, the
 Chinese Chief of State and Mao's heir apparent, made a speech
 stating:
 "The International Communist Movement is now in a crucial
 period of utmost importance.   An acute struggle between
 the Marxist-Leninists and the modern revisionists is
 going on on a worldwide scale over a series of important
 problems of principle.  The polemics are centered on
 whether the peoples of the world should carry out revo-
 lutions or not, and whether proletarian parties should
 lead the world's people in revolution or not."
 That the Chinese are indeed carrying on a worldwide struggle is
 shown by reports of Chinese efforts to circulate leaflets and
 other material in all areas,  including western Europe and even
 the East European satellites.   For example, Lajos Lederer
 reported in the London Observer of 5 May that the Chinese Embassy
 in Budapest was distributing leaflets, and that 40 Chinese study-
 ing in Hungary had broken up an international student seminar
 with their accusations against Khrushchev for splitting the Com-
 munist movement.  The Chinese have also been pushing forward in
 their efforts to win over front organizations:   following their
 success at the Djakarta Afro-Asian Journalists Conference in
 25X1 C10b April                                                  they lavishly a' lcl entert  ne  a number of these journalists in Peking on 18-19 May.
 Apparently as a result of Liu Shao-chi's efforts in Southeast
 Asia, Ho Chi Minh signed with him a joint statement supporting
 Chicom positions, and the Indonesian CP seems to have been won
 over to Peking, with Red Flag endorsing its lines.  New Chicory
 charges of Indian border vio ations (in broadcasts during the
 first week of June), and renewed Pathet Lao attacks on Laotian
 neutralist forces seem to spell new Chicom aggressiveness, and
 new embarrassments for Moscow.
 Soviet problems and position.   Speaking generally, the Soviets
 seem  o be in a difficult situation.   Following the first sputniks,
 Moscow apparently concluded that communism was advancing in the
 underdeveloped areas of the world, that the Bloc could be con-
 trolled without using Stalinist terror, and that rocket and space
 successes could be parlayed into such an impression of Soviet
 military superiority that the West would bow to Soviet demands.
 None of these expectations has worked out.  The greatest Soviet
 success, the communization of Cuba, must now taste bitter-sweet
 in Soviet mouths, since it led to the greatest Soviet setback
 since the failure of the Berlin blockade.   Indeed,  it may be that

 17 June 1963
 The attempt to place medium range missiles in Cuba represented a
 last desperate effort to attain an overawing strategic position
 vis-a-vis the United States.  The attempt to use trade and aid
 programs to win influence and prestige has often worked out poorly,
 as in the cases of Egypt, Syria, Guinea and Iraq; even Indonesia,
 despite vast expenditures, remains dubious, with its CP turning
 to Peking.  Many of the front movements, such as the Afro-Asian
 Peoples' Solidarity Organization, have also proved uncontrollable
 by Moscow.  As a result of such experiences, a recent article by
 V. Kudryavtsev in International Affairs (Moscow, May 1963) sug-
 gested that the CP   mus  wor  w     n the local African govern-
 ments if it is ever to bring them to the stage of "socialism."
 According to the Italian CP paper L'Unita of 8 and 9 May, a Moscow
 meeting sponsored by the Soviet Insti    e for World Economics
 heard papers by Institute collaborators stating that, contrary to
 Chicom beliefs, Asian, African and Latin American revolutions
 cannot defeat imperialism, which can only be conquered by
 "socialist" revolutions in the industrialized countries.   Such
 articles and statements are intended to lead to the conclusion
 that only "peaceful coexistence" can conquer for Communism.  Yet
 the failure of Soviet threats and maneuvers, the decline in the
 usefulness of the fronts (including the World Peace Council, which
 among other things quietly called off a meeting scheduled for
 8 June in Warsaw), and the divisive effects of peaceful co-
 existence (with its non-Leninist implications) on the world Com-
 munist movement, suggested that attempts to deceive both capi-
 talists and orthodox Communists -- such as the "peaceful co-
 existence" campaign represents -- cannot succeed.  Now the Kremlin
 must face the fact that even its leadership in the world movement
 is crumbling: things have reached the point where the leader of
 the Italian CP can freely criticize Soviet doctrines on art and
 literature, and Rumania can conduct flirtations (with trade and
 scientific-technical agreements) with the dissidents in Peking.
 (See Chronology -- Communist Dissensions in this issue.)  The
 extraordinary efforts required to weld Castro to Moscow are a
 revelation of weakness.  The Council for Mutual Economic As-
 sistance is obstructed and evaded by its satellite members.  The
 bloc no longer marches on Moscowts orders.
 Chinese problems and position.  The Chinese seem to be gain-
 ing s rend   , yet they have    eir problems too.   It will be
 extremely difficult -- probably impossible -- for them even to
 acquire the leadership in the world Communist movement once
 exercised by Stalin.   In some ways their position is not
 Stalinist, but Trotskyite, the position of the romantic revo-
 lutionary who calls for revolution when he has not the means to
 bring it about.  Their strongest appeal is in the underdeveloped
 countries, and in those areas they are tempted to expand their
 doctrine of "East Wind versus West Wind" into racialism.  But
 the underdeveloped peoples do not want to be oriental, they want
 to be industrialized.  The Chinese should have even less reason
 than the Soviets to want an open split in the movement -- though
 they like to compare themselves with Lenin's "splendid isolation'"

 in the Second International.  Within the movement they can exert
 considerable influence, but outside it, they will be weak and
 vulnerable.
 Possible developments. Against this background, it seems
 that there are   ree poss  le results for the 5 July conference:
 1.  Theoretically, there might be a grand reconciliation.
 But every present indication makes this extremely unlikely.
 To begin with, such a reconciliation could hardly occur
 without the presence of Khrushchev and Mao, and secondly,
 there is no sign that either side is relenting in its stand.
 2.  There might be an open break.  This is-definitely
 possible, yet Khrushchev can hardly be anxious to preside
 over the dissolution of the Communist Empire, while Mao
 would lose strength from a break.
 3.  There might be superficial agreement, resolving
 none of the basic causes of the conflict.  One question
 on which some statement will be expected is the question
 of a world conference of Communist parties, yet it is
 virtually impossible for the disputants to agree on who
 shall attend,  let alone on what shall be discussed.
 Generally the Soviets do not want such a meeting but the
 Chicoms do.  Perhaps this difficulty can be glossed over
 with a vague statement that a world meeting will occur at
 a date still to be announced.   An agreement to tone down
 open polemics or to resume aid for China and/or Albania is
 also conceivable.
 It is also possible, of course, that at the last moment some
 pretext will be found for postponing the conference once more.

 670 AF.  Danger of Racial-Explosion in South Africa
 BACKGROUND:
 Policy.   In May 1963 the parliament of the Republic of
 South Afr cassed two new apartheid laws, adding to the tighten-
 ing cycle of segregation, protest, and further segregation of the
 Republic's nearly eleven million Africans.  Called "Bantu," the
 South African Negro's forced separation from the whites and coloreds
 (mixed blood) is the core of the country's socio-economic policies,
 the motivating factor for rising extremist opposition and the target
 of bitter attacks from other nations.
 Prime Minister Vervioerd's government, with the support of the
 majority of the Afrikaners (the descendents of Boer settlers), is
 attempting to implement its decision that separation -- not inte-
 gration -- of the races is the only way the European fifth of the
 population can retain control of its own affairs In the country.
 Total separation of the races is considered impraccical even by
 VerEwroerd and company in this the most highly industrialized country
 on the continent because African labor is essential for industrial,
 commercial and domestic service.  The new Bantu laws will help pro-
 vide a readily available, but controlled, labor pool for the white
 communities by stringently restricting the African's right to live
 or work according to his own choice.  This also arbitrarily breaks
 up African families.
 Complementing the Bantu laws is the General Law Amendment of
 May 2nd which, according to the International Commission of Jurists
 embodies "many of the worst features of the Stalinist regime."  Its
 provisions include removal of habeas corpus, requiring the accused
 to prove his own innocence, arrest w   ou  warrant, indefinite im-
 prisonment without trial and denial of other legal safeguards.
 The government is pushing a "Bantustan" program which will
 transfer all Africans not needed in the labor force into eight widely
 scattered areas, comprising approximately thirteen percent of the
 country.   In these areas Africans are presumably to be permitted
 their own autonomous political development under chiefs who are
 salaried government servants.   But economically the African will
 still be dependent on the white South African areas; politically he
 will be subject to ultimate rule from Pretoria.  Most Africans
 strongly object to the Bantustan program but many see it as the best
 way to gain ultimate independence from the whites.  Poverty is the
 usual lot of the Bantustan African despite the fact that the white
 South African has the highest living standard in Africa.

 Political divisions generally follow racial, cultural lines.
 Most of the   r kaners support the ruling; Nationalist Party which
 came to power in 1946 by advocating apartheid as the answer to the
 "them or Vs" racial situation which they believed the white minor-
 ity faced.      4 healthy economy, base. on abundant mineral resources,
 and a large, well-trained army have sustained the government which
 clai-nis to be strongly pro-West and anti-Communist.
 The largest of the white opposition parties, the United Party,
 draws its adherents from English-speaking populations and advocates
 fewer racial restrictions; the small Progressive and Liberal parties
 want none at all.  None has sufficient sur_uport from the conservative
 white electorate to threaten the powerful Nationalist Party govern-
 ment.
 Of the outlawed non-white parties, the largest is the African
 National Congress (ANC), led by Nobel prize-winner Albert Luthuli
 and including among its leaders a number of known Communists.  The
 ANC's multi-racial stance and non-violent opposition have proven in-
 effective in combatting the government's apartheid policies.  The
 militant, sabotage arm of the ANC, called the Spear of the Nation,
 is now receiving the active support of the small South African Com-
 mau.nist Party (SACP), underground since 1953.  A 1963 SACP manifesto
 caller for a united front of national liberation.  However, a London
 Daily Worker article of April 17th called for revolutionary action
 to overthrow white domination through cooperation with the ANC and
 condemned the other nationalist groups.
 The Communist decision to work through the nationalist ANC and
 to advocate a policy of "answering violence with violence" may intrc-
 duco a foreign element into the picture as CPs of other countries
 lend their support through arms, training, or money for the SACP-
 supported fighters.  An ANC-authored article in Pravda of March 3rd
 has already called for "international help" for 3t program.
 The more extreme Pan-African Congress (PAC), advocating a
 strictly "African Africa," inspired the 1:63 demonstrations which led
 to the Sharpeville shootings and ultimately to jailing of their
 leader and banning of the party.  Extremist elements of PAC are be-
 lieved to have formed the core of the violently anti-white Poqo
 organization which called for widespread racial violence as recently
 as early 1963.  The South African police claim to have broken the
 organization by arrests of thousands in the Spring of 1963.
 External Relations.  Attacks on the Afrikaner government's in-
 movau e adherence to  is apartheid policy led to South Africa's
 withdrawal from the British Commonwealth in 1961.  Severing Common-
 wealth ties has had little effect on South Africa's economic situa-
 tion and none on the apartheid program.
 Another source of international friction is the government's
 refusal to concede United Nations' jurisdiction over neighboring
 South West Africa, now administered as an almost integral part of
 South Africa itself.  A German colony until 1918 mandated to South
 Africa by the League of Nations after World War I, South West Africa

 has international status and should be a supervisory responsibility
 of the UN, according to an international Court of Justice ruling of
 1950.  Although conceding some legitimate international concerns
 for South West Africa, Vorwoerd's government refuses UN supervision
 and continues to rule this relatively prosperous area under what it
 claims are the terms of the lapsed mandate.  An early 1964 ruling
 is expected on a suit now in the Court charging that South African
 apartheid policies contravene the terns of the League mandate.
 South Africa may refuse to comply with any unfavorable ruling, thus
 inviting further international friction.
 The growth of Afro-Asian influence in pushing the UN case has
 been paralleled by independent African moves.  The African heads
 of state, meeting in Addis Ababa in May, called on countries having
 "traditional relations" with South Africa to apply UN sanctions
 against her, to support the UN special committee on apartheid, and
 to sever diplomatic relations with both South Africa and Portugal.
 This so-called "decolonialization" resolution also called for a
 boycott of trade and other economic measures and promised to aid
 movements of national liberation.   (See also BPG Item #672 "The
 African Heads of State Meeting" in this issue)
 The imminent dissolution of the Central African Federation
 (Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland) to the northeast has
 led to speculation that Sir Winston Field, Prime Minister of South-
 ern Rhodesia, will seek support for his white-supremacy government
 from Verwoerd.  Such a bloc of racist states in Black Africa could
 25X1C1Obonly draw increasing fire from its neighbors and from the UN.

 671 EE,FE,NE.  Sino-Soviet Border Controversies
 IBACICC?OUND:  On 12 December 1962 Premier Khrushchev referred to
 Communist  hi a's criticism of Soviet handling of the Cuban crisis
 and, in justifying his having reached an accommodation with the
 "imperialists," he chided Communist China for having failed to kick
 the "imperialists" out of Hong Kong and Macao.  The US Communist
 Party repeated and expanded the Soviet charge on 9 January 1963.
 The Peking People's Daily editorial of 8 March took up these charges
 by discussing"a'little of the history of Imperialist aggression
 against China."  The editorial listed 12 countries, including Tsarist
 Russia, who had "carried out unbridled aggression against China."
 The Pacple's Daily referred to a "large number of unequal treaties"
 that China had been compelled to sign and specifically mentioned
 nine of them, four of which were between Russia and China and in-
 volved the cession of extensive territory by China to Russia.  The
 Treaty of Ai Gun (1858) gave some 135,003 square miles of Chinese land
 by moving the border from the Yabloncvy and Stanovoi Mountain Ranges
 in Siberia eastward to the Amur River; the Treaty of Peking (1863)
 gave Russia some 350,000 square miles, including the Chinese terri-
 tory east of the Ussuri River that makes up the USSR's Far Eastern
 provinces including the city of Vladivostok; and the Treaty of Ili
 (1331) gave Russia the lower Ili valley which previously was part of
 Chinese Sinkiang.  The fourth "unequal treaty" between China and
 Russia gave Russia a series of unilateral economic and consular
 privileges in China.
 (For a detailed description of these treaties and maps of the
 territories involved see the article entitled "Borders of China" in
 the 20 April 1963 issue of The New Republic and an article by
 Chalmers Roberts in the 23 Apra     53 issue of The Washington Post.
 For an excellent analysis of the Sino-Soviet border problem, see
 "Will There Be a Reconquest of Siberia" in the 22 March issue of
 Christ and Welt.  The former two articles are reprinted in the
 30 April Issue of Press Comment and the latter is in the 1 May issue
 of Press Comment.)
 The People's Daily editorial explained that when the People's
 Republic o  China was founded "our government declared that it would
 examine the treaties concluded by previous Chinese governments.  .  .
 and would recognize, abrogate, revise, or renegotiate them accor'ing
 to their respective contents."  The People's Daily added that all
 "these legacies from the past" would ue set a  "when the time is
 ripe."  Thus far in this context neither side has made reference to
 the Treaty of 1924 which re-established normal relations between
 China and the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution.  This treaty
 was supposed to implement the Soviet declaration of 1919 which pro-
 ciaiiied that "The (USSR) government of Workers and Peasants has .
 declared null and veil .      the treaties which were to enable     .
 Tsarist Russia to enslave the people of the East and principally the
 occa a of China."  The s a0~8 nJ         f       A60620002 ?i~v'  s

 imperialistic and also as proof of Communist Fraternal relations.
 It is not referred to currently by the Soviets for obvious reasons,
 although Chinese reluctance to cite this treaty is somewhat more
 obscure.  Perhaps they simply prefer to withhold it for later use.
 It could be a potent device to be used in challenging the current
 Soviet leaders to demonstrate their loyalty to the original concepts
 of their own revolution and to the ideas of Lenin.  At any rate, the
 Chinese have served notice that they are at liberty to bring up the
 25X1C10b question of these treaties "when the time is ripe."

 672 AF,g.  The African Heads of State Meeting
 25X1C10b
 BACKGROUND:  The meeting of the African Heads of State in
 Addis      a   2-26 May) culminated in the signing of a charter (see
 attachment) of the new Organization of African Unity (OAU) which was
 signed by all 30 independent African governments present.  Only 3
 governments were absent:  Morocco boycotted the meeting ostensibly
 because of Mauritania's presence, but it is expected that it will
 become a co-signator at a later date.  Togo was not seated, presum-
 ably in deference to Guinean President Toure's continuing opposition
 to the Grunitsky regime, but may be given an opportunity to join the
 OAU.  The white-ruled Union of South Africa, pursuing apartheid
 policies, was not invited.
 The meeting took place in an atmosphere of general rapproche-
 ment and moderation.   Indeed, the conference was a remarkable
 achievement in that agreement was reached in four days on a number
 of basic issues, despite personal rivalries and serious differences
 in approach.   The charter was adopted in the face of a strong but
 unsuccessful plea of President Nkrumah of Ghana for immediate organ-
 ic union and a recommendation by the preceding Foreign Ministers'
 meeting to postpone the adoption of a charter.  The charter was
 developed with the assistance of a representative of the Organiza-
 tion of American states at the invitation of the Ethiopian Govern-
 ment.  The charter is essentially of the OAS type.   It provides for
 a summit-level assembly to meet annually, a ministerial council to
 meet at least twice yearly, and a secretariat currently (and prob-
 attly permanently) to be located at Addis Ababa.   It establishes a
 commission for mediation, conciliation and arbitration as well as
 other functional commissions for defense, economic, social and
 scientific purposes with the details remaining to be worked out.
 The charter does not include provisions for collective security or
 a parliamentary assembly.  These institutions presumably will
 supersede the rivalries between the militant Casablanca powers and
 the moderate Monrovia states.  However, basically regional group-
 ings, such as the African and Malagasy Union (UAM) of 13 French-
 speaking states, can be expected to continue for some time and to
 play important roles.
 The charter represents an important step in.the African states'
 attempts to find cooperative solutions to many of the continent's
 difficult and important problems.   It is fairly realistic in view of
 the present capabilities of the member states and makes very little
 concession to extremists and their opinions.  But it will be some
 time before the charter will be implemented and there undoubtedly
 will be many disputes over details of the new pan-African structure,
 including and particularly over the designation of key personnel.

 It appears that the secretariat will be located in Addis Ababa,
 with assembly and council meetings to be rotated among other
 capitals and the various commissions to be headquartered elsewhere.
 A meeting of OAU foreign ministers is to be held in Dakar in July
 to chart the next steps.
 Ethiopian United Nations representative Tesfaye Febre-Egzy
 was named temporary secretary general of the OAU.  There is specu-
 lation among certain African leaders that Tesfaye may be in
 sympathy with Nkrumah's policies and that he could conceivably use
 the position as secretary to inject a more militant policy into
 the OAU than envisaged by the signatories of the charter.  Further,
 the six-nation committee (Ghana,  UAR,  Uganda, Tanganyika, Niger
 and Nigeria) set up by the conference to appoint deputy secretaries
 will include representatives who may well attempt to regain some
 of the ground in the secretariat's work which Nkrumah lost at the
 meeting.
 The resolutions which were adopted reflect the trends in
 African nationalism and non-alignment.   Several of the key reso?.u-
 tions appeared to have been carefully framed as a direct challenge
 to the West and were supported by the most pro-Western of the
 African states.
 The resolution on decolonization calls on all independent
 African states to support dependent people in Africa in their
 struggle for freedom and independence; calls for the establishment
 of a special fund to be contributed to by the member states by
 15 July to supply practical and financial aid to the various
 African national liberation movements; calls on African states to
 intervene with the great powers to stop supporting colonialist
 governments, particularly Portugal "which is conducting a real war
 of genocide in Africa"; informs the Western nations that they must
 choose between friendship with the African peoples and support of
 powers that oppress them; demands the breaking off of diplomatic
 and consular relations between all African states and the govern-
 ments of Portugal and South Africa so long as they persist in their
 present attitude towards decolonization; asks for boycotting the
 foreign trade of Portugal and South Africa by:   (a) prohibiting
 in-port of goods,  (b) closing African ports and airports to their
 ships and planes, and (c) forbidding the planes of those two
 countries to overfly the territories of all African states.
 The resolution establishes a nine-nation committee to be
 located in Dar-es-Salaam to coordinate assistance to nationalist
 movements, 21 of which had observer-lobbyists in attendance who
 were recognized by the assembly.
 Nkrumah, Toure (Guinea), Ben Bella (Algeria) and Obote (Uganda)
 were leading the way in the formulation of this militant posture
 on the freedom fight of the still-dependent African territories.
 The resolution on apartheid and racism, which condemns racial
 discrimination everywhere,iexpresses deep concern over racial dis-

 the continent, particularly in the United States.  At the same
 time, the resolution expressed appreciation of the US Government's
 efforts to end discrimination.  As part of the resolution against
 apartheid, a special fund was set up for an anti-apartheid movement.
 The reso ution appeals to all governments still having  iplomatic,
 consular and economic relations with the Union of South Africa to
 break these off and cease any other form of encouragement of
 apartheid.
 The resolution on general disarmament says that the conference
 has agreed unanimously on the removal of military bases from Africa
 and the disentanglement of African countries from military pacts
 with foreign powers; declares Africa a denuclearized zone; and
 appeals to the great powers to reduce arms and to sign a disarma-
 ment agreement with effective controls.
 A resolution on Africa, Non-Alignment and the UN reaffirms
 dedication to the purposes and principles of the UN charter;
 accepts all obligations contained in that charter, including finan-
 cial obligations; and requests that steps be taken for better
 African representation in the principal organs of the UN.
 A resolution on economic problems asks that Africa develop
 its own economy which should tend to eliminate the need for exter-
 nal economic aid.   External aid should be unconditional and not
 prejudicial to the independence of African states.  The conference
 resolved to establish a preparatory economic committee to study
 possibilities of establishing a free trade area between various
 African countries, a common external tariff to protect industries,
 a pan-African monetary zone, and means for developing trade between
 African states.

 RACE PROBLEMS IN SOUTH AFRICA
 "Tearing a Country Apart" by Colin Legum (who revisiting South Africa)
 In The Observer, London April 28-May  5,   1963
 "There is no mistaking the change in temper in South Africa in
 the three 'quiet' years since the Sharpeville shootings.  On all sides
 now there is a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability of violence.
 "Government spokesmen lead public opinion in preparing .  .  . for
 what lies ahead.  They no longer say 'If violence comes,' but as
 Dr. Verwoerd recently said:   'When combat is necessary in place of the
 pen, we will not hesitate.'
 "Violence has also become the language of.the Africans -- from
 Congress leaders to women domestic workers....  All talk now is about
 the tactics of violence, no longer about its relevance.       .  There
 is almost a desire for violence, as an outlet for the growing sense
 of helplessness .  .  .  .
 "It is not difficult to find out what is happening in Dr.
 Ven,aoerd's republic as a result of the government's policy of uproot-
 ing and reorganizing the lives and relationships of millions of
 peop le .  .  .  .
 "One out of three of the Republic's eleven million Africans no
 longer has the legal right to live anywhere in the country.  Where
 these people may live is a decision for bureaucrats.  Well ovex
 130,000 people have already been forcibly removed from one area to
 another, or from the towns to the stagnant, workless native reserves.
 Another 500,000 are under notice of removal.  And by the time the
 process of creating Bantustans is completed, well over five million
 people will have been uprooted under the plans already announced.
 Not since Stalin moved the Volga Germans and Hitler moved Europe's
 Jews has there been such a calculated effort to transport populations
 solely for the purpose of serving the interests of a ruling oligarchy.
 "One should begin perhaps by describing what Dr. Verwoerd is
 trying to do, and why he is being allowed to do it.
 "His premise (a correct one) is that nowhere in Africa will
 Africans be willing to share power.  Their demand everywhere is to be
 politically' dominant .   Therefore,  if a European community the size of
 South Africa's wants to maintain control over its own affairs it must
 refuse  to surrender any political power.  He has put two choices to
 the white electorate:     integration of the races or separation -- and
 they have decisively rejected the first.   They are willing, therefore,
 to endorse whatever action maybe necessary to achieve the second.
 They see it as a simple choice between 'them' or 'us.'
 "The Prime Minister, however, recognizes that it is impossible
 to go on forever denying political rights or economic opportunities
 to Africans.  And, since he refuses to allow these in the present
 Republic, his solution to the dilemma is to divide South Africa into
 nine parts -- a white part, occupying 87 per cent of the land, and
 :eight black parts, the Bantustans.  These, in time, will be allowed
 to grow to independence.  But until this happens they are to be con-
 trolled, guided and assisted by the whites.
 "This partitioning of South Africa into nine separate states is
 what is now being attempted.  Dr. Verwoerd, and with him the majority
 of whites, believe this is the only hope for white survival on condi-
 tions acceptable to themselves.
 "Before taking a closer look at the way these plans are working
 out, it.is important to describe briefly what is involved in tearing
 the races apart and in setting up Bantustans.  The Republic's eleven
 million Africans are distributed roughly in three equal parts between
 the reserves. (the future Bantustans), the white areas and the white
 farms.  The.declared official policy is that, in future, the sole
 criterion for any African to be anywhere in the white areas will be
 whether or not his labor is needed there.; this decree will affect two-
 thirds of the total African population.

 "Nobody knows for sure how many Africans will be declared surplus
 to the needs of whites.  The fact that an African has been born and
 has lived all his life in a particular place will no longer be relevant
 to his right to go on living there once the new Bantu Laws Amendment
 Bill is passed.  With half a million Africans at present unemployed,
 one gets some idea of the immediate surplus that will be pushed back
 either into the reserves or into labor depots.  From there they will
 be directed, not only where, but also for whom they may work.   if they
 lose their job they must leave their place of: residence until another
 job is found for them.
 "The Bantustans are to be reorganized to absorb the surplus work-
 ers.                 But the land (13 per cent of the country's total) is insufficieit
 for those already living there.   It has been estimated that 3,600,000
 people will have to leave the land in the reserves to enable farming
 to be made productive.
 "To provide homes and work for these millions, in addition to
 those declared surplus to the needs of white areas, the government
 proposes to build hundreds of new towns inside the borders of the
 Bantustans.  Just across the borderline, white-owned industries are to
 be located, drawing their labor from the Bantustan populations.  Mean-
 while, the removals from the towns are being pushed ahead even though
 the 'border industries' are nowhere near ready to absorb the numbers
 of displaced workers. . . .
 "The government has already set up its first Bantustan in the
 Transkei, an area the size of Denmark, in the eastern Cape Province.
 It is the traditional homeland of the Xhosa-speaking people (1,500,0OQ
 "The constitution for the Transkei makes it the equivalent of a
 British colony.   Instead of a governor it has a commissioner-general
 -- a tough, right-wing former Nationalist M.P.- -- who holds all ulti-
 mate power on behalf of the Republican Government.  The functions of
 the Transkei Territorial Authority are restricted to local affairs.
 Its Parliament consists of 64 chiefs and 45 elected members.  Since
 the chiefs can be disciplined or dismissed at will by the Republican
 Government, it has the power to control the nonelected majority.
 "The Transkei is known as 'Verwoerd's Reich' because its first
 'Prime Minister' is Chief Kaiser Matanzima, a 35-year-old, sophisti-
 cated,, tough university graduate.  He is a perfect partner for Dr.
 Verwoerd.  He, too, believes in apartheid:   it fits in well with his
 own deeply held attachment to black racism.
 "The government has gambled heavily on Matanzima.   If he lets
 them down, or fails, Bantustan would suffer a serious setback, and so
 would Dr. Verwoerd.  Ma.tanzima is no easy tiger to ride.  He has al-
 ready demanded that all the.land between the Fish River and Zululand
 (which includes the whole of Natal) should be-handed over to
 Bantustan.  And he has begun to menace the white traders in the
 Transkei.   On this point.Verwoerd,'s attitude is consistent:   he be-
 lieves that, just as the blacks have no inherent rights in the white
 areas, so the whites have none in the Bantustans.
 "Matanzima's chief opponent is the most powerful chief in the
 Transkei -- Paramount Chief Sabata Dalindyebo of the Tembu.. He has
 resisted all government. pressures to make him cooperate; if the gov-
 ernment hesitates to depose him it is because it fears the trouble
 this would bring from the numerous Tembu people.  Sabata stands
 firmly for an interracial society.  .  .  .
 "Things are not going well in the first.Bantustan.  A state of.
 emergency, proclaimed when Pondo peasants revolted in 1961, is: still
 in force.  The leader of this revolt., Magaduzele Bentzwana, heads a
 violent underground movement in the hills.  He has sworn not to be
 taken alive.
 "A second underground violence movement, Pogo,. has been responsi-
 ble for several killings of whites and blacks in the Transkei.  oogo's
 immediate target is to kill chiefs who support Matanzima; his own life
 is constantly threatened, and he moves everywhere under heavy guard.
 Matanzima's police are notorious for the brutality they show to their
 opponents,. who. are. no less violent in their own methods.

 been one of the most tranquil parts of South Africa -- has been
 turned into an armed camp, divided between the supporters and oppo-
 nents of Chief Matanzima.  Violence has already become an important
 factor in the way things work out in the first of the eight
 Bantustans.  But still the government is not hesitating to push
 ahead its plans to establish another seven."

 "Has South Africa a Future?" by Frank Giles (traveling foreign editors
 In The Sunday Times, London, March 13, 1963
 "The first impression that a visitor to South Africa receives
 today is of a rich and immensely promising country being led with
 slow but apparent certainty towards disaster.
 "On the practical side, admittedly, it is tempting to question
 whether the shortcomings of apartheid ar9 so great.  'From the moral
 and human point of view apartheid is detestable, but for the moment
 it works' was how an experienced foreign diplomatist, stationed in
 Capetown, judged the situation.  .  .  .
 "Criticism from outside is easy.   It riust, in all fairness, be
 considered natural for many white South Africans in fear for their
 way of life (and perhaps their lives themselves) to see things
 differently and find present conditions quite acceptable if not
 actually pleasant.  But inquiries soon reveal the flaws (apart from
 its inhumanity) of apartheid.
 "In its latest form, it seeks to create a series of Bantu
 (African)'homelands' in the traditional tribal areas where the
 African will be able to exercise his political rights and develop
 himself, socially and economically, without the interference or
 harmful impact of white civilization.  This may in theory be a noble
 vision, but it cannot accommodate two simple facts:   first, the
 'homelands,' many of them no better than rural slums, are incapable
 in the foreseeable future of supporting any substantial increase in
 their existing populations of about 4.5 million.   Secondly, the six
 million Africans living outside the homelands, who supply the cheap
 labor force indispensable to the economy, are to continue to be
 denied any sort of status in the white areas where they live and
 work. . . .
 "The lack of any political rights for the Africans living in
 the white areas is justified by a comparison with Italians working
 in France, or Mexicans in the United States -- 'If they wish to
 exercise their rights as, citizens they return to their own coun-
 tr1ae.'  Not only does this argument overlook the fact that vast
 numbers of the Bantu in the industrial areas have become de-
 tribalized, losing all touch with their homelands and transforming
 themselves into a depressed proletariat, but it also passes over all
 the many aspects of racial discrimination which make the African's
 life a permanently underprivileged one.  .  .  .
 "Difficult as it may be to find aught for one's comfort in
 South Africa today, none the less I believe that there are redeeming
 features, even in Nationalist policy, and that the outside world
 must by no means despair of a land whose racial problems are, it
 must be recognized, unique.
 "To begin with, the very application of apartheid policy has
 brought its own incidental benefits.  For the first time, a South
 African Government, however questionable its philosophy, is doing
 something about the native.   'Separate development' means putting
 Africans to live in townships away from the white areas, and a huge
 program of native housing has been undertaken, with results that are
 visibly impressive by African or any other standards.  The people
 who inhabit these townships may not have the vote or access to free-
 hold rights, but they live for the most part in conditions far better
 than those to be found in, for example, the Southern Rhodesian
 townships.  .  .  .
 "The biggest rift in the lute of Nationalist thinking is to be
 seen, I think, in the practical realization of the Bantustan idea.
 So far, only one of the native reserve areas.-- the Transkei, a
 fertile and picturesque but poverty-stricken rigion lying between
 East London and Durban -- is being prepared for so-called self-,
 government and independence by means of a constitution which will
 come into force some time this year.  But the protents of this
 development are such-that it is not impossible that it may lead to
 an upsurge of African nationalism which the white Nationalists will
 be increasingly incapable of controlling.

 "Very few of the Liberals or progressives would agree, it is
 true, with this view that the Bantustans may be transformed into so
 many daggers pointed at the hearts of their creators.  They can
 produce what they think to be cast-iron reasons why Transkei's
 'nationhood:' is only one more example of Nationalist hypocrisy.
 They may be right, and certainly most of the educated Africans I
 talked to in Johannesburg and elsewhere thought like this.
 "But it is significant that some of Verwoerd's own party are
 beginning, despite the massive safeguards and reservations built
 into the Transkei constitution, audibly to protest about what they
 fear will be a Frankenstein monster, to the point that Verwoerd
 has even been accused of being a liberal.  Far-fetched though this
 may sound, it is undeniable that the theory of Bantustan, and still
 more its impending practice as embodied in the new Transkei con-
 stitution, establishes an entirely new factor in South African
 politics:   that the black man has political rights, and that he is
 to exercise them within his own homeland by the one-man-one-vote
 method.   is it really conceivable that once this principle, has been
 ter-
 admitted it will be possible to limit it, in face of all the inter-
 nal and external pressures which will surely be forthcoming,
 nal                                                                            a
 number of prescribed African areas?"

 "The Overthrow of Apartheid" by Patrick Duncan (South African editor
 of Contact who has fled the country)
 In The New Republic March 9, 1953
 "The Communists' best hope in Africa lies in a land which has
 not yet found freedom -- South Africa.
 "Through the unyielding oppressiveness of the apartheid govern-
 ment there is now no chance of a peaceful transition to freedom and
 democracy.  The way to power in South Africa now lies through the
 use of force, and the movement that first successfully uses force
 against apartheid is assured of overwhelming world support.
 "The Communists and their allies have pioneered the use of
 sabotage against Dr. Verwoerd's government and are well in the rung-
 Wing in the race to open the shooting war this year or next.  One of
 the leading anti-apartheid movements, the African National Congress,
 has for years been anti-Western and during the Cuba crisis it sent
 messages of encouragement to Castro.  Also, Dr. Verwoerd's government
 is pathologically afraid of communism and smears as Communist any
 democratic protest against apartheid.  The oppressed, who hate
 apartheid, are therefore tempted to love apartheid's foes, including
 communism.  All these factors make it possible that the South African
 revolution will be begun by the Communists.  What this would mean was
 well nut by a recent American letterwriter to The Observer (Dec.
 16, 1962).  'Should a major uprising against the South   rican Govern
 anent be led by Co=s unists,' he wrote,  'the Western world would be
 confronted with a choice of evils of unprecedented difficulty.'
 "The best, perhaps the only guarantee that a future free South
 Africa will be non-Communist is that the South African revolution be
 begun and led to victory by men who are not Communist.   Such men
 exist within South Africa, but they have insufficient arms and money.
 They must now be given what they need.
 "Although the idea of launching and powering a revolution for
 the attainment of democratic rights will seem fantastic to more cau-
 tious spirits in London and Washington, there are precedents.  To
 quote President Kennedy:   'Most political revolutions -- including
 our own -- have been buoyed by outside aid in men, weapons and ideas'
 (Strategy of Peace).
 "There is another Southern African field in which the West dare
 not allow itself to be outplayed and outbid.   Intertwined with the
 South African revolution is the question of Southwest Africa.  Almosi
 certainly the United Nations will decide in the near future to remove
 the one-time mandate from the control of the South African Government
 Any such move will require teeth if it is to be successful, and
 supporters of a policy of tough action will no doubt have been en-
 couraged by the recent military successes of the United Nations
 troops in Katanga, only 400 miles away from Southwest Africa.
 When this decision to unlock Southwest Africa from the grip of
 Verwoerd's Government is made, the West will be faced with this
 choice:   to cooperate with the United Nations, to finance, arm and
 transport its force (backed by an all but unanimous vote of the
 General Assembly and enjoying the sympathy of virtually the whole
 human race), or to sit by and watch the Soviets do it.
 "In Southwest Africa and South Africa., America's policy of nur-
 turing freedom and blocking.commu.n.ism leads irresistibly to the use
 of force, force to power the South African anti"apartheid revolution
 and force to support the United Nations in Southwest Africa.  A
 foretaste of what lies ahead has been experienced in the fighting to
 free Katanga from Tshombe's concealed colonialism.  Africa south
 of the Congo presents the West now with its next unavoidable choice:
 is it for or against apartheid?  Let the choice be made soon."
