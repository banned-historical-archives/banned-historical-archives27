ANTI-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN THE 
SINO-SOVIET BLOC 
THE PROBLEM 
To appraise the intensity and scope of dissidence and resistance in the Sino-
Soviet Bloc, and to estimate the resistance potential in times of peace and war. 
INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
Like its predecessor,' this estimate is a 
brief appraisal of the causes, nature, and 
extent of anti-regime dissidence and re-
sistance within the Sino-Soviet Bloc. It 
is based upon eleven country studies pre-
pared by the inter-agency Resistance In-
telligence Committee established by the 
IAC. These studies, which analyze dissi-
dence and resistance in each country of 
the Bloc, have been noted but not indi-
vidually approved by the IAC; they are 
appended as annexes to the estimate 
itself. 
In the estimate and the annexes, the 
following terminology is used: 
Dissidence ? a state of mind involving 
discontent or disaffection with the 
regime. 
Resistance ? dissidence translated in-
to action. 
Organized resistance?resistance 
which is carried out by a group of indi-
viduals who have accepted a common 
1 NIE 10-55, "Anti-Communist Resistance Poten-
tial in the Sino-Soviet Bloc," 12 April 1955. 
purpose, agreed upon leadership, and 
worked out a communications system. 
Unorganized resistance ? resistance 
carried out by individuals or loosely asso-
ciated groups which may have been 
formed spontaneously for certain limited 
objectives, without over-all plan or 
strategy. 
Passive resistance ? resistance, organ-
ized or unorganized, which is conducted 
within the framework of the resister's 
normal life and duties, and involves de-
liberate nonperformance or malperform-
ance of acts which would benefit the 
regime, or deliberate nonconformity with 
standards of conduct established by the 
regime. 
Active resistance ? resistance, organ-
ized or unorganized, which expresses 
itself in positive acts against the regime. 
It may or may not involve violence, and 
may be conducted openly or clandestinely. 
It may take such forms as intelligence 
collection, psychological warfare, sabo-
tage, guerrilla warfare, assistance in

escape and evasion, open defiance of 
authority, or preparatory activity for any 
of the above. 
With the progressive consolidation of 
Communist control, however, active re-
sistance has in general tended to take less 
the forms mentioned above, and to be 
expressed more in such forms as strikes, 
demonstrations, and open manifestations 
of intellectual and other dissent. While 
in many cases these activities are not 
wholly motivated by anti-regime atti-
tudes, they nevertheless have anti-regime 
connotations. 
ESTIMATE 
Scope and Intensity of Dissidence and 
Resistance 
1. Dissidence continues to be widespread in 
the Sino-Soviet Bloc. Improvements in living 
standards and such relaxation of regime con-
trols as took place during the last three years 
have been, except perhaps in the USSR, in-
sufficient to reduce substantially general dis-
content. Save in semi-independent Poland, 
nationalist anti-regime feelings in Eastern 
Europe are as strong as ever. In addition to 
common grievances, various population ele-
ments harbor special resentments, such as 
those of peasants towards collectivization, 
workers towards Communist labor discipline, 
intellectuals and students towards enforced 
ideological conformity, believers towards anti-
religious measures. 
2. The scope and intensity of dissidence, how-
ever, varies widely from country to country. 
One of the most important distinctions in 
both peacetime and wartime resistance poten-
tial is whether or not the regime is viewed as 
representing the national rather than an 
alien interest. Except among certain of its 
own national minorities, the Soviet regime 
has succeeded in identifying itself among its 
own population as a legitimate national gov-
ernment. But Communist regimes in the 
Far East have made somewhat less progress 
in this respect, and those in Eastern 
Europe, again excepting Poland, have failed 
almost completely. In the divided countries, 
the existence of a functioning alternative gov-
ernment exercises some attraction which 
operates to increase dissidence, but this ap-
pears to be a major factor only in East 
Germany. Other variations in resistance 
potential arise from differences in national 
character, in historical traditions, in economic 
conditions, and in religious attitudes. 
3. In the last few years most Bloc regimes 
have sought to reduce popular discontent and 
to narrow the rifts between the regimes and 
their peoples. The leashing of the Soviet 
secret police, the decollectivization of Polish 
agriculture, and efforts to improve living 
standards are cases in point. These policies 
have had some success. On the other hand, 
the very trend toward relaxation of controls 
and resulting confusion as to regime policies 
have given greater scope to overt manifesta-
tions of discontent. Sharp criticism arose, 
for example, among Moscow writers and Chi-
nese intellectuals when the regimes experi-
mented with a looser application of controls. 
In Hungary and Poland, inhibitions upon the 
use of police terror and serious splits within 
the Communist parties permitted dissi-
dence to swell into active resistance, in Hun-
gary on a mass scale. In reaction, the Bloc 
regimes have tightened their controls, and in 
Hungary after the bloody suppression of the 
revolt the regime reverted to harsh repression. 
The Bloc leaders have striven to insure party 
unity, to circumscribe the range of permissi-
ble criticism, and to provide various reminders 
of their physical power. As a result, organ-
ized active resistance is negligible in the Bloc 
at the present time. 
Resistance Potential in Peacetime 
4. During the next few years, conditions of 
life probably will not improve sufficiently to

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/11 : CIA-RDP79R01012A010700020001-2 
SECRET 
reduce dissidence significantly in most coun-
tries of the Sino-Soviet Bloc. This dissidence 
will probably continue to be expressed pri-
marily in various forms of passive resist-
ance ? noncompliance with regime orders, 
economic malingering, other low-risk ways of 
expressing individual opposition. So long as 
the regimes do not revert to all-out repression, 
there is also likely to be some continuation of 
those forms of active resistance ? strikes, 
demonstrations, open expressions of intellec-
tual dissent ? which have characterized the 
past few years. In particular, such manifes-
tations are likely in parts of Eastern Europe. 
In Communist China, some disturbances by 
peasants and ethnic minorities are also likely. 
5. Moreover, many Bloc regimes recognize 
that the cultivation of popular support and 
the eliciting of broader initiative would re-
quire not only economic betterment but some 
degree of liberalization of controls. However, 
they also recognize that such steps increase 
the difficulty of maintaining party unity and 
complete control over the populace. Thus 
they will probably accede to popular pressures 
only in those cases in which they regard it 
as relatively safe to do so. But any relaxation 
of controls will tend to give dissident elements 
opportunities to press their grievances in in-
direct ways. 
6. Further, each regime's problems may be 
increased and complicated by developments 
elsewhere in the Bloc and influences from the 
Free World. The repercussions of the USSR's 
de-Stalinization campaign and the events in 
Hungary and Poland have agitated dissidents 
throughout the Bloc, in some cases to the 
point of stimulating various forms of resist-
ance. Intra-Bloc variations in ideology and 
policy have contributed to dissatisfaction and 
ferment among intellectuals and students. 
As contacts with non-Bloc countries increase, 
unfavorable comparisons will arise. In con-
sequence, campaigns against dissidence, while 
primarily concerned with its domestic sources, 
must also contend with unsettling influences 
from abroad. 
7. The difficulties of dealing with dissidence, 
various forms of resistance, and foreign influ-
ences may lead to policy vacillations between 
"hard" and "soft" lines or to intra-party dis-
putes. These developments might evoke 
greater resistance activity. This activity, 
however, would tend to be directed towards 
the elimination of specific grievances rather 
than to the overthrow of the existing regimes, 
since the latter course would seem highly un-
promising unless there were a serious prior 
weakening of party and police. 
8. For these reasons we regard major out-
breaks of active resistance as unlikely, al-
though these cannot be excluded in certain 
volatile situations in Eastern Europe. Spo-
radic local outbreaks will probably recur, but 
they will almost certainly be within the capa-
bilities of security forces to repress. The 
regime's counter-weapons ? primarily the 
monopoly of physical force (coupled with an 
evident willingness to use it) and a near-
monopoly of means of communication ? will 
remain formidable. In Poland the regime has 
shown less reliance on these weapons, but a 
primary safeguard against violent resistance 
is the widespread recognition, to which the 
Catholic Church lends important support, 
that it would provoke Soviet intervention. 
Here, as elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Soviet 
suppression of the Hungarian revolt and the 
absence of Western assistance have under-
lined the futility of violent resistance. 
9. Emigre organizations of former Bloc na-
tionals have, in general, lost effective contact 
with their homelands and are little known to 
Bloc populations. Virtually all of them have 
suffered from internal bickering, and many 
have been penetrated by Communist agents. 
Emigre groups do not significantly contribute 
to resistance potential, and with rare excep-
tions their leaders would not be welcomed to 
positions of power after liberation. 
Resistance Potential in Event of 
General War 
10. At the outset of a general war, patriotism 
would act to diminish sharply the resistance 
potential in most of the USSR and to some 
extent in Communist China, though in the 
latter case this would depend more on the 
nature of the conflict. In the Far Eastern 
satellites, any increase in resistance potential

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/11 : CIA-RDP79R01012A010700020001-2 
SECRET 
probably would be only marginal. But in the 
satellite states of Eastern Europe, as well as in 
certain minority areas of the USSR and Com-
munist China (e.g. the Baltic States, Georgia, 
Western Ukraine, Tibet) , the outbreak of 
war would rekindle hopes of liberation and 
immediately increase the resistance potential. 
This potential probably would be highest in 
Poland, Hungary, and East Germany. We 
believe, however, that unless the tide of war 
ran sharply against the Bloc and its military 
and security forces were significantly weak-
ened, resistance activities of a para-military 
nature could be prevented or at least confined 
to manageable -proportions. 
11. While we conclude that resistance activi-
ties probably would not be a major factor so 
long as the outcome of the main conflict re-
mained dubious, resistance activity probably 
could be expected, especially in Eastern Eu-
rope, in the form of intelligence collection and 
transmission, aid to Western personnel in 
escape and evasion operations, and minor sab-
otage. The level of such activity would vary 
considerably, because of differences in resist-
ance potential, and also as a result of the 
amount of outside assistance available and 
the location of battle lines. 
12. Only conjectures can be made concerning 
the impact on resistance activity of the use of 
nuclear weapons. Much would depend on 
such factors as the extent and locale of the 
attacks, the types of weapons used, the dam-
age caused, the extent to which regime con-
trols were disrupted, etc. Among population 
4 
groups suffering direct losses, survivors prob-
ably would first be stunned, then concentrate 
their energies exclusively on problems of per-
sonal survival. In areas sufficiently distant 
from attack to be largely unaffected, resist-
ance might increase as dissident elements 
found that Communist controls had been 
weakened; on the other hand, they might con-
clude that nuclear weapons were so decisive 
that extensive resistance was irrelevant or un-
necessary. Groups outside the attack area 
but sufficiently close to be caught in the re-
sulting chaos would be subject to all these 
effects. It is possible that, in certain cases, 
attacks against selected targets might weaken 
the regime's anti-resistance capabilities more 
than they impaired resistance potential. 
13. The question of responsibility for the in-
itiation of general war probably would not 
substantially affect the will to resist the 
regimes in the Bloc countries. Nor would the 
nationality of attacking forces be likely, in the 
majority of cases, to have great bearing upon 
the cooperation offered by resistance ele-
ments. Exceptions would be cases in which 
long-standing national antipathies might con-
flict to an important degree with anti-regime 
feelings, e.g. (a) German forces in Czechoslo-
vakia, Poland, and the USSR; (b) Yugoslav, 
Greek, and Turkish forces in Bulgaria; (c) 
Greek, Italian, and Yugoslav forces in Al-
bania; and (d) Japanese forces in North 
Korea and Communist China. On the other 
hand, in the divided countries anti-regime re-
sistance might increase if military forces of 
the non-Communist government were used.

ANNEX A ? ALBANIA 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. The continuing low standard of living in 
Albania since the Communist take-over in 
1944 has been a major factor in the general 
dissidence prevalent among the great ma-
jority of the population. The Communist 
take-over in Albania was greatly facilitated by 
the promises made by the Communist-domi-
nated National Liberation Front during World 
War II of basic economic and political reforms 
which would grant the people "freedom, 
bread, and land." The program for political 
independence from foreign rule and for im-
provement of social and economic conditions 
had a dynamic appeal, particularly among the 
intellectuals, youths, and poor peasants in 
central and southern Albania where living 
conditions were wretchedly poor and syste-
matic exploitation by the local feudal land-
owners was the rule. But after 13 years of 
rule the Communist regime not only has 
failed to fulfill its promises of providing the 
Albanians with a decent standard of living 
but has imposed an economic system of regi-
mentation, oppression, and exploitation that 
was unheard of even in the period of the Otto-
man Empire. The government has repeated-
ly admitted that attempts to improve the 
availability of foodstuffs have met with little, 
if any, success, and that during certain 
periods of the year the food situation becomes 
very critical. 
2. Politically, there are two basic factors 
which account for the widespread hostility 
the great majority of Albanians bear toward 
the present regime. First, the Communist 
ideology has for nearly all Albanians a defi-
nite Slavic connotation and is therefore con-
sidered wholly alien. It is, moreover, regarded 
as merely another instrument through which 
the Slays can dominate the country. Just as 
the Ottoman Empire was resisted for five cen-
turies because of its alien traditions and 
political and social institutions, so today the 
Communist regime is opposed as equally alien 
even though its leaders are native Albanians. 
3. The second factor is the ancient traditions 
of and beliefs in individual freedom and the 
hatred of central authority. No past govern-
ment in Albania, either foreign or native, has 
been so ruthless as the present one in impos-
ing its will on the mountaineers in the north 
and the peasantry in central and southern 
areas. Individual freedom has been com-
pletely suppressed; the closely knit family 
pattern has been virtually destroyed; and vil-
lage life, around which most social and politi-
cal activities have evolved in the past, has now 
been placed under the control of local Com-
munist functionaries whose chief task is not 
to serve the villagers but to carry out the 
unpopular program and policies of the regime. 
The greatest opposition to the regime has 
originated among mountaineers and villagers, 
who resent the inroads into their economic 
and family life by the central authorities. 
4. Religion does not seem to have played a ma-
jor role in the dissidence that has developed 
against the regime. There are two basic rea-
sons for this situation. First, religion in Alba-
nia has found it difficult to offer a united front 
to Communism because the population is di-
vided into three denominations: Moslem, com-
prising about 70 percent of the population; Or-
thodox Christians, about 20 percent; and Ro-
man Catholics, about 10 percent. The regime 
has fostered and exploited this division. Sec-
ond, aside from the Catholic element, the Al-
banians as a whole are not devoutly religious. 
Their religious sentiments are expressed pri-
marily in ancient traditions and tribal cus-
toms representing something essentially Al-
banian, whereas the three existing denomina-
tions have often been associated with spheres 
of foreign influence: the Ottoman Empire, 
the Greek Church (which dominated the

Albanian Orthodox Church until 1922) , and 
the Italian influence through the. Roman 
Catholic Church. The regime had little diffi-
culty to convert the Moslem and Orthodox 
Churches into instruments of Communist 
rule. The Roman Catholics, however, having 
expressed somewhat deeper religious senti-
ments and strong opposition to Communism, 
have been subject to severe persecution. In 
fact, the regime has destroyed the Catholic 
Church as an independent institution. 
5. While the regime was able to eliminate or 
subdue the three principal religious institu-
tions in Albania, it has not been able to eradi-
cate the religious feelings, beliefs, and cus-
toms of the Albanian people. Despite anti-
religious propaganda and repressive measures, 
the Albanians continue to attend church serv-
ices and maintain their customs and beliefs. 
The Albanian peasants in particular, compris-
ing nearly 80 percent of the country's 1,400,-
000 population, not only refuse to work on 
religious holidays or wedding days, but have 
been known to slaughter hundreds of rams to 
be consumed on such holidays in violation of 
government restrictions. In some sections of 
the country where threats and pressure have 
failed, the regime has used force against what 
it considers an ancient practice damaging to 
the present economy. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
6. Dissidence toward the regime apparently 
remains strong among all classes. With the 
possible exception of the higher governmental 
and Party bureaucracy, the ranking army offi-
cers, and a limited number of intellectuals 
there is no group which derives real benefit 
from the regime. The denigration of Stalin 
has had hardly any effect on the Albanian 
Communist leaders who continue their repres-
sive rule without the benefits of "relaxation." 
Large numbers of the population are still in 
jails and labor camps. 
7. The Peasantry. Albania is basically a 
country of peasants and villagers, who as a 
group comprise the largest and most formida-
ble anti-Communist element in the country. 
As stated above, during the war the Commu-
nist movement found considerable support in 
the south among the poor and landless 
peasants. This group profited by the so-called 
agrarian reforms of 1945-46 but shortly there-
after became thoroughly disillusioned and dis-
affected. The principal reasons for its dis-
affection, as well as for that of nearly all the 
country's peasants, were the crushing taxes, 
the heavy obligatory delivery quotas, and the 
low prices paid by the government for agri-
cultural products; the seizure of livestock; the 
imposition of "voluntary" (forced) labor; the 
imposition of the agricultural collective sys-
tem; and the oppression and terror practiced 
by the Communist security police. The Al-
banian peasant is a fierce individualist, proud 
of his past independence; he knows nothing 
of, and cares less for, the subtleties of the 
Communist ideology. However, despite their 
opposition to the regime, the peasants have 
been unable to stem the tide of total collecti-
zation of agriculture that is presently being 
conducted by the regime. This deep peasant 
discontent accounts for much of the resist-
ance potential in the armed forces, among the 
youth in the countryside, among peasants 
who have been drafted for work in industrial 
projects and mining, and among other groups 
of peasant origin still having contact with 
friends and relatives on the land. 
8. Youth. Albanian youth, both rural and 
urban, began resisting the Italian occupiers 
immediately after the latter invaded the coun-
try in 1939. Later the Communists, camou-
flaging themselves in the National Liberation 
Front and using patriotic slogans, deceived 
large sections of the country's youth and drew 
them under its banner. Thus the youth be-
came the backbone of the Communist move-
ment in Albania during the war. However, 
disillusionment began to set in soon after the 
Communists took over the country and re-
vealed their true political, social, and eco-
nomic aims. By 1950 Communist propaganda 
had ceased to be effective among the great 
majority of the youth, especially in the coun-
tryside, because of first-hand experience with 
"voluntary" labor and because of widespread 
economic want and inequality which youth 
saw in the villages.

9. Industrial Workers and Civil Servants. 
Aside from a relatively small number of work-
ers who have risen from the ranks to man-
agerial positions in the nationalized indus-
tries, the laboring class in Albania has gained 
nothing under the Communist regime. Wages 
are low; prices are generally high; and non-
rationed goods are either in short supply or 
prohibitively expensive. There is constant 
pressure to meet the high work norms based 
on achievements of shockworkers and stak-
hanovites; there are stringent restrictions on 
changing jobs and heavy penalties for tardi-
ness or breaking of work discipline; some "vol-
untary" (forced) work must be performed by 
all laborers; frequent political meetings after 
work are compulsory; various deductions for 
Communist publications and contributions 
are made, etc. Like most other Albanians, 
the workers have shown signs of disaffection 
and are looking forward to the day of libera-
tion from the Communist regime. Among 
this class may be included the low-level office 
workers and civil servants, all of whom are 
subject to the same general restrictions and 
heavy obligations as the laboring class. 
10. Intelligentsia and Clergy. The intelli-
gentsia of pre-Communist Albania consisted 
of older elements who since the beginning of 
the century had worked for the creation of an 
independent country, and of younger people 
who were brought up during the period of 
national revival after World War I and were 
imbued with Western culture and ideas. Some 
of the younger intellectuals, mostly school 
teachers, government officials, army officers, 
and journalists, who in the period 1925-39 
were disgusted with the behavior of King Zog 
and his ruling group and with the feudal land-
owners, gradually tended to the left. During 
World War II they became the backbone of 
the national liberation movement through 
which the Communists managed to seize con-
trol of the country. Other intellectuals, how-
ever, opposed the rise of Communism and a 
number of them fought actively against the 
Communist-controlled Partisan formations. 
Balli Kombetar (National Front) , the strong-
est anti-Communist organization during the 
war, was founded by nationalist democratic 
elements among intellectuals, both old and 
young, who had the vision to foresee the catas-
trophe that would befall the country in the 
event of a Communist success. Although a 
large number of anti-Communist intellec-
tuals were either driven out of the country or 
imprisoned or executed when the Communists 
assumed control, there are still strong ele-
ments among those remaining who are thor-
oughly dissatisfied with the regime and who 
look toward liberation. There is only a hand-
ful of intellectuals in Albania today who could 
be relied upon completely by the regime. 
11. As noted above, the Moslem and Orthodox 
clergymen have been cowed into submission 
by the Tirana regime and the Catholic clergy 
almost completely eliminated. However, 
smouldering hatred exists among most of the 
remaining clergymen, particularly the Cath-
olic, and they represent a definite resistance 
potential. 
12. Armed Forces. Morale in the Albanian 
Armed Forces is low and the majority of the 
men probably feel hostile toward the present 
Albanian regime. This hostility arises pri-
marily from basic dislike of the present regime 
and from resistance of individual Albanian 
conscripts to military control. Moreover, the 
ranks in the armed forces derive chiefly from 
peasant families and as such have the same 
antagonism toward the regime as their elders 
in the villages. For this reason the army 
ranks appear to be considered by the regime 
as unreliable. This is indicated by the fact 
that units of the armed forces have never been 
employed to stamp out guerrilla bands. Most 
of the permanent commissioned and noncom-
missioned officers, comprising perhaps one-
third of the total armed forces strength, were 
selected because of their apparent loyalty to 
the regime. Nevertheless, during the past two 
years, there has been evidence of some dissi-
dence among high-ranking officers, some of 
whom were dismissed. The demobilization 
late in 1955 and early in 1956 of a considerable 
number of officers considered unreliable by 
the regime not only embittered those affected 
but also had a demoralizing effect on others 
still in the service. This substantial dissi-
dence potential, however, is not organized and 
has not been focused on a uniform objective.

INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
13. Reliable reports on the people's attitudes 
in Albania indicate that more than 90 percent 
of the country's population is disaffected with 
the Communist regime. The intensity of the 
anti-regime feeling ranges from a rather mild, 
chronic irritation on the part of disillusioned 
Communists and Party sympathizers to a vio-
lent hatred on the part of those persons or 
groups who have been directly harmed by the 
regime. With the exception of the national 
and most local Party leaders, some members 
of the top bureaucracy, and the security 
forces, there is at present no group, including 
the Party rank-and-file, which escapes the 
police terror of the regime or derives material 
or other benefits from it. Nor does the popu-
lation have hopes for a better future under 
Communist rule. There are many hidden 
enemies of the regime, despite the constant 
efforts of the secret police to root them out. 
The suppression of certain groups, which are 
considered by the regime as past redemption, 
and their internment in labor or concentra-
tion camps, only adds to the widespread ill 
feeling. 
14. Although there are signs of hostility 
toward the Soviet military and civilian experts 
in Albania, derived from their preferential 
treatment and higher wages, there is no evi-
dence that the population holds the Soviet 
Union, whose armed forces played no part in 
imposing the Communist regime on them, pri-
marily responsible for their present plight. 
Hostility appears to be directed chiefly against 
the native Communists. Even the more edu-
cated people hold the central authorities re-
sponsible for imposing an alien ideology on 
the country. There appear to be compara-
tively few Albanians who are fully aware of 
controls and pressures exerted on the regime 
by the Kremlin. In the countryside hostility 
is directed almost wholly against local Com-
munist and governmental functionaries who 
implement the regime's policies. It is signifi-
cant that the vast majority of escapees from 
Albania are villagers, not former members of 
the bourgeois class or of the bureaucracy. The 
village escapees know little if anything about 
Communist ideology. 
TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
15. The Soviet-Yugoslav declaration of June 
2, 1955 recognizing the existence of "different 
roads to socialism" and the denigration of 
Stalin in the spring of 1956 gave rise to serious 
frictions within the Albanian Party's top lead-
ership, but there is no evidence that the pop-
ulation at large was affected in any measur-
able way by these events. The Soviet-
Yugoslav declaration encouraged nationalist-
minded members of the Party's Central Com-
mittee to request that the Party follow a more 
independent policy vis-a-vis Moscow and to 
advocate the liberalization and democratiza-
tion of Party life and the establishment of 
friendly relations with the West as well as 
the East. These men were at once deprived 
of their army ranks and dismissed from their 
Party and government posts. 
16. The denigration of Stalin also had serious 
repercussions in the Albanian Party and re-
sulted in further purges in April?May 1956. 
In April a number of Party intellectuals, offi-
cials, and army officers at a meeting of the 
Party Committee of Tirana pressed for the re-
habilitation of all Party groups who had been 
purged prior to Stalin's death, requested that 
relations with Yugoslavia be normalized as 
soon as possible, attacked the top Party lead-
ership for its rigid Stalinist views, belittled 
the economic "successes" of the regime, and 
asked that measures be taken at once to de-
mocratize and liberalize Party and state life. 
Prompt and severe measures were taken 
against all dissenters, but difficulties within 
and outside the Party continued. 
17. The anti-regime sentiments of intellec-
tuals, both Communist and non-Communist, 
appear to have been fanned by the Soviet-
Yugoslav rapprochement, the Polish rebellion 
and the Hungarian revolution. These events 
probably had some positive effects on the Al-
banian resistance potential. But the defeat 
of the insurgents in Hungary resulted in dis-
appointment among the Albanian national-
ists and strengthened Communist morale, as 
the Free World, in the Albanian view, did not 
dare to oppose Soviet power.

RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
18. Although no general unrest and disturb-
ance were reported in Albania immediately 
after the death of Stalin, special security 
measures were taken by the regime. Security 
pursuit battalions continued their punitive 
expeditions against those regions suspected of 
giving aid and comfort to resistance bands. 
The activities of the small, scattered, poorly-
organized-and-equipped bands in the moun-
tainous north began to diminish in 1953 and 
by 1955 had become virtually nonexistent. 
However, there have been reports of small, 
isolated guerrilla bands in areas near Tirana 
which in the past year have attacked head-
quarters of local People's Councils and killed 
Party, government, and police officials. 
19. No organized resistance group is known to 
exist today in Albania. Activities reported 
from time to time, such as assassinating local 
Party leaders and governmental officials, am-
bushing army and state transport trucks and 
security units, setting fire to cooperative 
warehouses and state depots and factories, 
and committing sabotage, are probably ac-
tions of local individuals or of persons tem-
porarily infiltrated from abroad. 
20. There are signs that some unorganized 
resistance, both active and passive, continues 
throughout the country. Open hostility 
toward the regime has been manifested chiefly 
in complaints about the cost of living and 
shortages of food. Riots reportedly occurred 
late in 1956 and early in 1957 in a number of 
cities protesting against economic depriva-
tions, but these were easily suppressed by the 
security forces. In certain areas in the north 
the people are said to have pillaged grain 
depots of the cooperatives; workers at various 
mines and factories staged token demonstra-
tions against shortages of food and low 
wages; students at some high schools distrib-
uted tracts against the top rulers, and anti-
Communist slogans and caricatures of Soviet 
and Albanian leaders were written or drawn 
on school walls. Workers show no interest in 
raising productivity. Peasants' resistance to 
collectivization consists mainly of failure to 
comply with the regime's measures to increase 
agricultural output or to meet quotas. All 
classes fail to pay, or try to avoid paying, 
taxes. Youth has largely resisted Communist 
indoctrination, and the people defiantly con-
tinue to practice religion. The stagnation of 
the Albanian economy probably stems in part 
from this attitude of passive resistance. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
21. Efforts by emigre groups to organize re-
sistance within Albania have failed. No 
known lines of communication exist between 
these groups and the Albanian people. Politi-
cal jealousies and bickering have weakened 
the various emigre parties and organizations. 
The aims of the National Committee for a 
Free Albania had been to guide and encourage 
resistance to Communist tyranny and to or-
ganize Albanians abroad to give effective aid 
to the resistance. The committee, however, 
was dissolved in April 1956 as a result of its 
disunity and ineffectiveness. A new emigre 
organization, the Free Albania Committee, 
formed under the sponsorship of the Free Eu-
rope Committee, shows no promise of greater 
effectiveness. However, there are definite 
signs that Greece and Yugoslavia, especially 
the latter, continue to infiltrate agents into 
Albania for purposes of subversion. There 
may also be some substance to the Albanian 
charges that in the spring and summer of 
1956 the Yugoslays recruited former influen-
tial Communists for the purpose of overthrow-
ing the present Albanian leadership and re-
placing it with pro-Yugoslav Communists. A 
plot of this kind was exposed by the Albanian 
authorities in September 1956. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
22. The Albanian Army has a strength of 
30,000 and in addition, the regime has at its 
disposal 10,000 militarized security troops. 
Frontier Troop elements, distributed fairly 
uniformly along the Greek, Yugoslav, and 
coastal borders, constitute 6,000 of this figure. 
An estimated 4,000 men are organized into 
Interior Troop units which are stationed 
throughout the country, with the largest 
single concentration in the Tirana area. In 
addition to these militarized forces, the Corn-
SECRET

12

SECRET 
munist Government controls an overt and 
covert policing apparatus totaling an addi-
tional 10,000 men. Thus, the Albanian re-
gime has a control ratio of one soldier, police-
man, or agent (in addition to countless in-
formants) for every 29 Albanian citizens. In 
addition, the regime has instituted the stand-
ard police controls used in all Communist 
countries: identity cards for all citizens over 
15 years of age, travel permits along border 
areas, as well as work and residence cards. 
Through these measures the regime has suc-
ceeded in cowing the people and instilling in 
them a sense of insecurity and total fear. The 
effectiveness of these measures is attested by 
the fact that open organized resistance has 
been practically wiped out in the past few 
years and that passive resistance during the 
same period has been reduced. Albania, un-
like most of the other satellites, took no meas-
ures in the post-Stalin era to reduce police 
terror or relax internal tensions. To counter-
act any attempts from outside the country to 
foster dissidence among the people, severe 
penalties are imposed on anyone implicated 
in aiding and abetting diversionists. These 
penalties also apply to anyone found listening 
to anti-regime radio broadcasts or possessing 
propaganda material received from outside 
the country. 
CAPABILITY TO SUPPRESS REVOLT 
23. There is no likelihood, at present, of any 
spontaneous uprising in Albania such as oc-
curred in Poland and Hungary in 1956. The 
Stalinist regime has taken rigid measures to 
nip in the bud any manifestations of faction-
alism within the Party or of deviationism 
among intellectuals, students, or other groups. 
Moreover, Albania, unlike some of the other 
European satellites, has not tinkered with its 
security apparatus, which still follows the 
standard Stalinist methods of complete re-
pression. However, should a revolt break out, 
the regime's security forces could probably 
suppress it, unless the population secured 
arms and the uprising spread generally 
throughout rural areas. The Albanian Army 
would be of doubtful loyalty in such a crisis, 
and a widespread popular revolt actively sup-
ported by the army could not be suppressed 
without active military assistance from the 
Soviet Bloc countries. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
24. Under present conditions, dissidence has 
no capability of developing into successful 
organized resistance. Should an attempt be 
made to establish organized resistance, the 
regime would take the severest countermeas-
ures, and control over the whole country 
would be even more repressive. However, a 
number of external and internal developments 
could increase the level of the current unor-
ganized resistance and dissidence. Economic 
and political successes in Yugoslavia and Po-
land could have a telling effect on certain 
groups in Albania, especially intellectuals, 
professionals, some managerial elements, and 
students. Internally, the continuing eco-
nomic deprivations and the acceleration of 
agricultural collectivization could increase the 
disaffection of the workers and peasants, espe-
cially of the latter who are potentially the 
greatest threat to the Communist regime. 
25. There were signs that resistance and dis-
sidence in Albania decreased after the Geneva 
summit conference of 1955, but an upward 
swing was noted after the Hungarian revolt 
of 1956. Moreover, the denigration of Stalin 
and the Soviet-Polish difficulties encouraged 
certain factions within the Party to attack 
the Albanian Stalinist leadership and to de-
mand liberalization of Party and government 
life. Such deviations were, however, quickly 
liquidated by the Tirana rulers. 
26. A substantial improvement of the people's 
living conditions, which at present is not in 
sight, could lessen the will to resist among 
certain elements, especially the working class 
and the civil servants. Conversely, disaffec-
tion could be expected to increase should the 
present very low living standards deteriorate 
further. 
27. There are at present no signs of any relax-
ation of security controls in Albania; in fact, 
the regime is callihg for increased strength-
ening and perfecting of the security police ap-
paratus in order to stamp out what little

SECRET 13 
resistance is left in the country. In the un-
likely event of a relaxation of security controls 
and police terror, the people could be expected 
to seize the opportunity to give vent to their 
smouldering, pent-up hatred and might even 
attempt to organize open resistance against 
the regime. In the countryside, in particular, 
the peasants would begin at once to defy the 
local officials and refuse to fulfill quota obli-
gations. 
28. Any external assistance to potential re-
sistance groups in Albania could be expected 
to increase their ranks and ability to fight, 
and to widen their popular support. Resist-
ance bands in the country, particularly in the 
north, were strong in the period 1949-53 when 
moral and some material support were given 
them by neighboring Yugoslavia and other 
countries. Once this stopped, the bands' 
activities came to a virtual standstill. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
29. All evidence indicates that the Albanians 
expect liberation only through the outbreak 
of a general war. Therefore, should such a 
war break out and internal controls be weak-
ened, dissidence and unorganized resistance 
could be expected to increase, especially if re-
sistance elements could be organized and re-
ceived material support and tactical assist-
ance from the West. The peasantry in par-
ticular could be expected to become more 
recalcitrant about obeying the government's 
economic orders. 
30. In the event of general war, the possibility 
of sporadic, but ineffectual, military action on 
the part of resistance elements exists. How-
ever, effective military action could be under-
taken only if substantial arms and direction 
were supplied from abroad and if substantial 
elements of the armed forces defected and 
took to the mountains. Without such assist-
ance from abroad, any sustained military 
activities by organized resistance groups could 
not be expected to continue for long. How-
ever, because of the terrain and the tradition 
of Albanians for guerrilla warfare, small bands 
could manage for an indefinite period to con-
duct sabotage and harassing activities. Al-
though poor communications and difficulties 
in coordinating activities of resistance bands 
would seriously impede large-scale escape and 
evasion operations, possibilities do exist for 
assisting individual and small group escapes. 
Also, intelligence collection could be arranged 
through the infiltration of small groups of 
well-trained officers to work closely with the 
guerrilla bands. 
31. The reaction of Albanians to an invasion 
of their country by Western armies would al-
most certainly depend upon the composition 
of these armies. Invasion by Italian, Greek, 
or Yugoslav armies would probably be met 
with general hostility because in the past such 
armies have destroyed Albania's independ-
ence. However, the Albanian people probably 
would offer all possible assistance to invading 
forces under NATO command even if these 
forces included some nationals from tradi-
tional enemy nations. In the event of such 
an invasion, it is likely that there would be 
considerable defection to the invading army 
from the Albanian Army (although probably 
not from the security forces) including offi-
cers. Moreover, assurance from the West of 
the preservation of Albania's independence 
and territorial integrity could, in the event 
of an open East-West conflict, unite the vast 
majority of the people against the present 
Communist regime as they have never been 
united before. Only the hard-core Commu-
nists would be likely to offer stiff resistance, 
especially in guerrilla warfare, in which they 
are pre-eminently qualified by their tempera-
ment and wartime experience in rugged ter-
rain. 
32. The effect on Albanian resistance poten-
tial of the use of nuclear weapons by attack-
ing forces would depend on which side em-
ployed them and the manner in which they 
are used. It is conceivable that a nuclear at-
tack limited to Soviet shore bases, to tactical 
use during actual operations, and to the seats 
of power could be so designed as to eliminate

ANNEX B? BULGARIA 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. Bulgaria has been traditionally more close-
ly linked to Russia than any other Eastern 
European state, and consequently anti-Rus-
sian feeling ? as distinguished from anti-So-
viet?is not as widespread and intense as else-
where. Although much of the legacy of good-
will deriving from the Russian liberation of 
Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1878 and from 
German control in 1944 has been dissipated as 
a result of Soviet domination since World War 
II, traditional ties with Russia have tended 
to check the development of hatred of Russia 
and of its culture as such. This contrasts 
with the situation in nations such as Poland 
and Hungary, where national antagonism to-
ward Russia has been traditional. Moreover, 
there are no Soviet troops in Bulgaria to ir-
ritate national pride. Antagonism created by 
Soviet military and other advisors who are 
present is probably limited to the relatively 
few Bulgarian functionaries with whom they 
come into direct contact. Soviet advisors 
reportedly keep to themselves and do not as-
sociate with Bulgarians. Soviet military per-
sonnel wear civilian clothes. Nevertheless, 
the regime's economic policies and programs 
are regarded by the majority of the population 
as furthering the interests of the USSR rather 
than those of Bulgaria. 
2. Serious economic problems have developed 
since Stalin's death. In September 1957 the 
regime admitted the existence of urban unem-
ployment, estimated at 150-180,000 persons 
or some 15-18 percent of the nonagricultural 
labor force. An urban housing shortage has 
also become acute. Agricultural production, 
which remains the mainstay of the economy, 
is still below prewar levels, as evidenced by the 
fact that temporary bread rationing and a So-
viet wheat loan were necessary to tide the Bul-
garians over a bad harvest in 1956. The re-
gime revealed in December 1956 that national 
income had declined and that planned invest-
ments in 1957 would be considerably less than 
in 1956. 
3. The population as a whole, however, ap-
pears disposed to suffer the currently depressed 
standard of living and tends openly to express 
its dissatisfaction only when economic condi-
tions become acutely unbearable. Realizing 
this, the regime has moved to allay economic 
discontent through a series of limited eco-
nomic relief measures: family wage allow-
ances have been tripled; compulsory deliveries 
of certain agricultural items have been abol-
ished; and wage increases ranging from eight 
to 20 percent have been granted to industrial 
workers. In order to relieve urban unemploy-
ment a series of make-work projects have been 
introduced with Soviet assistance, and about 
15,000 young people have been sent to work 
in the USSR and Czechoslovakia. Recent re-
ports by Western observers in Sofia claim 
that the regime's economic concessions re-
sulted in a slight improvement in living stand-
ards and an alleviation of economic discontent 
in the summer of 1957. Living conditions, 
however, are still below prewar levels and eco-
nomic discontent remains a major source of 
dissidence. 
4. Politically, dissatisfaction with totalitarian 
Communist rule is widespread. The popula-
tion resents Communist control and regula-
tion of all phases of life through the so-called 
"mass" social and cultural organizations. 
Bulgarians have long been accustomed to ty-
rannical rule but never has such rule been so 
oppressive as under the present regime. The 
regime lacks popular support and maintains 
itself in power through police state methods 
and the ever-present threat of Soviet military 
intervention. 
5. Although organized religion is a potential 
instrument for resistance, it is not, at this

16 SECRET 
time, an important source of dissidence in 
Bulgaria. Although regime efforts to convert 
younger people to atheism have embittered 
parents, the regime has refrained from any 
intensive religious persecution. Harassment 
of religious leaders has been limited to non-
Orthodox faiths (Catholic and Protestant) , 
which represent an insignificant proportion 
of the population, and has been directed 
against alleged subversive ties of religious 
leaders with Western countries rather than 
against profession of religious faith. On the 
other hand, the regime has openly endorsed 
Eastern Orthodoxy ? to which some 90 per-
cent of the population belongs ? as the na-
tional faith. The regime was instrumental 
in healing the schism between the Bulgarian 
Exarchate and the Patriarch of Constantino-
ple in 1945 and later raised the status of the 
Bulgarian Orthodox Church to the patriarchal 
level. Moreover, the hierarchy of the Bulgar-
ian Orthodox Church completely cooperates 
with the regime. Members of the lower clergy, 
although believed to be largely anti-Commu-
nist, have resigned themselves to Communist 
rule and refrain from making anti-regime 
statements. Currently Jewish, Moslem, Cath-
olic, and Protestant religious leaders also co-
operate with the regime. 
6. Traditional hostility toward Yugoslavia has 
served to check the spread of Titoism in Bul-
garia. Bulgarians would not welcome Tito 
as a liberator, in view of traditional suspicion 
of Yugoslav motives. Tito's national brand 
of Communism and other ideological innova-
tions have had little influence among Bul-
garian Communists. The regime's policy of 
close ties with Moscow enjoys the support of 
anti-Yugoslav elements in the Party who fear 
that rapprochement with Yugoslavia would 
result in territorial encroachments. Bulgar-
ian Communists have not forgotten Yugoslav 
efforts, prior to the Tito-Cominform break, to 
secure control of Bulgarian Pirin Macedonia 
by incorporating it into the Yugoslav federal 
republic of Macedonia. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
7. Peasants. Bulgarian peasants, steeped in 
a tradition of individual farming, resent the 
regime's collectivization program. Compris-
ing some 75 percent of the total population, 
the peasants are numerically an important 
dissident group and traditionally a source of 
political opposition. In 1951 a collectiviza-
tion drive culminated in local outbreaks of 
armed peasant resistance. The regime's latest 
collectivization drive began in 1955 and aims 
at virtually complete collectivization in a few 
years (87 percent of total arable land is cur-
rently in the socialized sector): Although 
there has been no open peasant resistance as 
in 1951, discontent in the countryside is still 
widespread. 
8. In recent years the regime has gone to 
great lengths to persuade former agrarian op-
position leaders to renounce their ties with the 
late Nikola Petkov, agrarian leader executed 
in 1947 for treason. It has had little success, 
however, and Dimitur Gichev, a former right-
wing agrarian leader, has especially inspired 
the peasantry with his stubborn refusal to 
renounce his past opposition activities. Nev-
ertheless, it remains a fact that the agrarian 
character of Bulgarian society serves to mili-
tate against the organization of dissidence 
into an effective resistance movement. Re-
sistance is difficult to organize among a popu-
lation thinly distributed throughout the coun-
tryside. The absence of large urban centers 
is also an important consideration, inasmuch 
as resistance has been traditionally organized 
by urban intellectuals and workers rather 
than by peasants. 
9. Youth. The disillusionment and antipathy 
of young people probably represent the most 
serious failure of the regime to eliminate po-
tential sources of resistance, since Commu-
nism admittedly relies upon the indoctrination 
of the younger generation to assure the even-
tual stability of its regime. Significantly, 
there is considerable dissatisfaction among 
students with courses on Marxism-Leninism. 
However, the government made it clear that it 
will resolutely oppose student demands for 
the abolition of these courses. Party and 
youth leaders were urged to re-educate young 
people who had come under the influence of 
bourgeois ideology and propaganda. 
10. Intellectuals. Ferment among intellec-
tuals, especially among writers and artists,

SECRET 17 
has been evident since Stalin's death. In 
December 1955, some two months prior to the 
denigration of Stalin, Stalinist leader Vulko 
Chervenkov severely castigated certain writers 
for attempting to undermine Party control 
over literature and urged that deviations from 
the Party literary line be "strangled in the 
embryonic stage." Bulgarian writers who be-
gan openly to advocate removal of Party con-
trols immediately following the 20th CPSU 
Congress were quickly rebuffed. In September 
1956, Bulgarian writers, attracted by an earlier 
version of Mao's "100 flowers" theory, were 
told that Communist Chinese ideologists did 
not mean that "weeds and noxious plants" 
would be allowed to bloom among the "flow-
ers" of socialist realism. However, despite 
repressive measures and warnings by the re-
gime, restiveness among writers has contin-
ued. 
11. Party Members. There is evidence of dis-
sidence among the Party rank and file, who 
apparently have been disillusioned by the re-
gime's failure to democratize Party life. Dis-
content among lower-echelon Party members 
is admitted by the Bulgarian press, which 
complains that disunity has existed in some 
lower Party organizations since the Hun-
garian revolt. In early 1957 the regime 
launched a campaign to cleanse Party ranks 
of "careerist and alien" elements. Dissidence 
in the higher echelons of Party leadership (at 
the Politburo and Central Committee levels) 
takes the form of rivalry for power. The 
purge of a Politburo member and two Central 
Committee members in July 1957, for example, 
was indicative of such rivalry. Thus far, how-
ever, top leaders have subordinated their dif-
ferences for the sake of unity. 
12. Armed Forces. Although in the summer 
of 1956 some 200 officers reportedly were 
purged from the army, apparently for nation-
al-Communist tendencies, dissidence, at this 
time, is believed virtually nonexistent within 
the Bulgarian armed forces. Military per-
sonnel, as a whole, are less prone to dissident 
attitudes than is the general population. The 
permanent cadre, constituting some 25 per-
cent of the total military strength, consists of 
commissioned and noncommissioned officers 
who have demonstrated their reliability; many 
of these are Communist Party members. The 
conscripts, 35,000 of whom are inducted into 
the Army annually, reflect the attitudes of 
Bulgarian youth generally, although persons 
of demonstrated antipathy toward the regime 
are screened out or consigned to the labor 
troops. Once they are inducted, military 
discipline and persistent political indoctrina-
tion militate against the intensification and 
spread of dissidence. The conditions of serv-
ice life in Bulgaria, while extremely poor by 
Western standards, are in general acceptable 
to the typical recruit. 
13. Industrial Workers. Industrial workers, 
officially the favored class of the regime, are 
disillusioned with low wages and poor work-
ing conditions. It is unlikely that recent wage 
increases have significantly offset this atti-
tude. Urban unemployment has further ag-
gravated their discontent. Bulgarian workers 
resent political and economic regimentation 
by Communist-dominated trade unions, whose 
primary function is to enforce labor discipline 
rather than represent the interests of the 
workers. Frequent criticism in the Bulgar-
ian press of the failure of trade unions to 
maintain close ties with the workers is in-
dicative of the hostile attitude of workers to-
ward Communist trade union officials. A 
trade union congress scheduled for the fall 
of 1956 was reportedly postponed because of 
demands by workers that they be allowed to 
elect their own union officials. 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
14. Dissidence in Bulgaria has not significant-
ly increased since Stalin's death. Rank and 
file Party members, writers and students open-
ly expressed their discontent after the 20th 
CPSU Party Congress, but repressive measures 
by the regime effectively curbed such manifes-
tations. During the Hungarian revolt some 
student demonstrations reportedly occurred 
but apparently failed to arouse other elements 
of the population. All available evidence indi-
cates that the majority of the population still 
feels that armed rebellion against an efficient 
police state, backed up by Soviet military 
force, would be futile without effective mili-

SECRET 
tary support from outside. Unquestionably, 
the failure of the Hungarian revolt has served 
to strengthen this attitude. Only a signifi-
cant worsening of economic conditions, ac-
companied by a break-down of the authority 
of the central Party leadership and its secur-
ity apparatus, could precipitate a general up-
rising. If localized disturbances arising out of 
economic conditions assumed larger propor-
tions and resulted in bloodshed, the current 
attitude of popular passivity could change 
to that of active resistance. Much would de-
pend on the ability of the regime to curb ini-
tial disturbances without exacerbating the 
hatred of the population. 
15. The regime's relatively stable leadership 
has been instrumental in checking the spread 
of dissidence. No Bulgarian leader has shown 
any tendency to champion greater autonomy 
from Moscow ? as Gomulka did ? and top 
leaders appear agreed that essential internal 
controls should be maintained. Elements dis-
satisfied with the regime's failure to liberalize 
internal life following the denigration of Sta-
lin were unable to find a spokesman for their 
cause among the leaders. Certain journalists 
and writers who openly called for more drastic 
destalinization were sternly rebuked. 
16. Nevertheless, the ordinary citizen report-
edly began to enjoy relatively greater freedom. 
Arrests for minor political offenses ceased and 
Bulgarians became less afraid of expressing 
anti-regime opinions in public. Minor politi-
cal offenders were released and forced labor 
camps began to close. In September 1956 a 
Central Committee decision promised ex-
panded powers and responsibility for local 
governmental organs, more effective curbs on 
police abuses, and debate in the national 
parliament. The Central Committee de-
cision also rehabilitated individuals previously 
purged from high places for Titoism. 
17. The Polish and Hungarian upheavals, 
however, reversed this trend and the police 
state atmosphere of the Stalin era was rein-
troduced. In early November 1956, shortly 
after the suppression of the Hungarian rebels, 
the regime carried out precautionary arrests 
of unreliable elements and began to reopen 
forced labor camps. The regime urged the 
population to report persons making anti-
regime statements to the authorities, and po-
lice patrols in Sofia and other cities increased. 
By July 1957 some 5,000 persons reportedly 
had been expelled from Sofia. 
18. Popular dissidence in Bulgaria is directed 
toward both the native regime and Soviet 
domination. There is little likelihood that 
Bulgarians distinguish between Soviet dom-
ination and local Communist rule. Bul-
garian Communist leaders, who prior to 
World War II spent many years of their adult 
life in the Soviet Union and even acquired 
Soviet citizenship, are regarded as more Soviet 
than Bulgarian. Bulgarians appear to at-
tribute their depressed standard of living 
both to Soviet domination and to the policies 
of the regime. Dissidence is also equally 
directed at Communism per se, since it is asso-
ciated with the regime and Soviet domination. 
While some Party members and members of 
the intellectual class may feel that Soviet 
practice is a perversion of true Communism, 
the majority of Bulgarians are opposed to 
Communism in general. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
19. Generally, active resistance activities have 
declined since the death of Stalin even though 
there are indications of some increase of dissi-
dence among the Party elite. There is no 
present available evidence of any organized 
resistance against the regime, either on a na-
tional or on a local scale. Reports alleging 
activities of such organizations have remained 
unconfirmed. Whatever resistance there is, 
appears to be entirely limited to the passive 
and unorganized variety. 
20. Passive resistance is found among the 
peasantry, workers, intellectuals, and youth. 
The clergy and members of the former middle 
class do not figure prominently in passive re-
sistance. Peasant resistance is displayed by 
failure to meet agricultural delivery quotas 
set by the regime and neglect of collective 
farm machinery. Malfeasance by collective 
farm officials indicates an attitude of indif-
ference, if not opposition. Occasional active 
resistance in the form of sabotage has been 
reported but such reports are difficult to

SECRET 19 
verify. Whatever sabotage there is appears 
to be spontaneous and not the work of any 
organized group. 
21. In industry, workers resort to slowdowns 
and absenteeism, are careless with mainte-
nance and handling of equipment, and fail to 
meet norms. While it is difficult to determine 
whether such acts are due to inefficiency or are 
manifestations of passive resistance, the fre-
quency with which the Bulgarian press dis-
cusses such matters would indicate the latter. 
22. Passive resistance among youth is mani-
fested by complete lack of interest in the ac-
tivities of the Communist-sponsored Dimitrov 
youth organization, deliberate failure of 
courses in universities in order to avoid work 
assignments to unpleasant areas or jobs, and 
failure to attend Party meetings and other 
youth activities of the Fatherland Front. 
Young people also, on occasion, manifest re-
ligious devoutness. 
23. Bulgarian writers and journalists have 
been accused by the regime of deliberately 
avoiding writing about contemporary life in 
order to eschew political controversy. Writers 
occasionally get articles and short stories criti-
cal of the regime published in the press. 
Judging from discussions of literary activities 
in the press, heated debates and differences of 
views take place at meetings of the Bulgarian 
Writers' Union. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
24. Although Bulgarian emigre organizations 
have numerous contacts with persons in the 
homeland, there is no evidence that they are 
in a position to organize resistance activities. 
The Bulgarian emigre movement is divided by 
jealousies and opportunism, which have served 
to reduce its potential to inspire resistance in 
Bulgaria. There is a general feeling that emi-
gres have been abroad too long to keep in 
touch with conditions and current aspirations 
in Bulgaria and consequently cannot provide 
post-liberation leadership. Recent regime 
propaganda against the emigre movement, 
spread by voluntary returnees, has probably 
served to further lower Bulgarian estimation 
of emigre organizations. 
25. Dr. Georgi M. Dimitrov, representing the 
left wing Agrarians in exile, is the only emigre 
leader known to have seriously attempted to 
maintain contacts inside Bulgaria. His activ-
ity, however, has been confined to keeping 
track of followers through sporadic refugee 
debriefings and personal correspondence. He 
has mounted about five cross-border opera-
tions, with the assistance of Western intelli-
gence services, to contact local Agrarian lead-
ers, asking them to start organizing against 
the day when the Communist regime col-
lapses. The Dimitrov organizational activity 
is oriented toward eventual assumption of 
power by his party rather than toward present 
or eventual resistance to the Communists. 
He has condemned the operations of other 
groups and intelligence agencies aimed at or-
ganizing internal resistance. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
26. Following the 20th CPSU Congress, the 
Bulgarian regime refused to grant any signifi-
cant concessions. Voicing its allegiance to the 
principle of "socialist legality," it resumed pre-
ventive and arbitrary arrest and deportations. 
While calling for a new spirit in art, it in-
sisted on conformance to "socialist realism." 
Requesting constructive criticism by Party 
members, it silenced or expelled all but the 
most platitudinous critics. Stalinist type 
oppression will probably continue to be effec-
tive even though it will exacerbate already 
existing grievances. 
27. The powers of the police have not been 
significantly restricted. During the suppres-
sion of the Hungarian revolt, the regime open-
ly appealed to the population to inform on 
individuals guilty of anti-regime statements 
and activities. Since March 1957, unreliable 
elements from Sofia and other large towns 
were expelled. Sofia citizens, marked for ex-
pulsion to the countryside, were visited by the 
police after midnight and given two to four 
hours to leave the capital. Even Party func-
tionaries and other persons formerly consid-
ered reliable by the regime were among those 
expelled.

SECRET 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
28. The regime could successfully suppress 
any localized revolt. The Bulgarian mili-
tarized security forces consist of 30,000 well-
trained, loyal men, evenly divided between 
Frontier Troops and Interior Troops. The 
overt and covert police organizations bring 
the total strength of the security apparatus, 
exclusive of the armed forces, to 80,000-
100,000 persons. This figure gives a control 
ratio of one trained operative, policeman, or 
militarized security force man to every 77 to 
96 Bulgarian citizens, not taking into account 
the informer network. The efficiency and 
quality of the police system appears good and 
there is no indication of disloyalty in the 
police forces. Although certain elements of 
the ordinary police (such as the traffic police) 
were placed under local control in July 1957, 
there has been no major reform of the Bul-
garian internal security apparatus which 
might lessen its effectiveness in suppressing 
local resistance. Frontier and Interior Troop 
strength is believed to have been cut, but 
these reductions are not believed to have seri-
ously affected the efficiency of the state secu-
rity apparatus. Moreover, the Bulgarian 
police system has not been discredited by ad-
mittance of past "errors" as in the case of 
some other satellites. Following the April 
1956 Plenum's restoration of "socialist legal-
ity," and the quiet repudiation of the 1949-
1952 Party purge, the security apparatus suf-
fered only a minimal loss of efficiency result-
ing from confusion over the new line and the 
eclipse of a number of security officers impli-
cated in the earlier extortion of false confes-
sions and other malpractices. 
29. In the highly unlikely event of a national 
uprising, however, the Bulgarian security ap-
paratus would need the support of the Bul-
garian Army and, if the conflict threatened to 
prolong itself, the support of Soviet forces. 
Top Bulgarian Army officers and commanders 
would remain loyal to the regime, and lower 
ranking officers and enlisted men would gen-
erally maintain discipline and seek to suppress 
the rebels unless they were convinced that the 
1-tter truly represented a nationwide popular 
movement. In the event that rebel efforts 
promised some success and some lower rank-
ing officers and men turned over their arms 
or joined the revolt, Soviet intervention in 
force would be inevitable. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
30. Assuming conditions of peace and barring 
widespread revolts in the Bloc, there is little 
real potential among any elements in Bul-
garia for effective organized resistance to the 
regime. Unorganized and passive resistance 
will probably continue to manifest itself, but 
under present conditions the population will 
increasingly feel that their position is hope-
less and that aid from the United States or 
any other Western power is unlikely. Local 
outbreaks of resistance born, of desperation 
with economic conditions, particularly among 
the peasants, might occur from time to time, 
but a general spontaneous revolt such as 
occurred in Hungary is unlikely, given present 
conditions and the temper of the population. 
31. Whether or not passive and unorganized 
resistance activity will increase depends on 
the ability of the regime to cope with eco-
nomic problems. Thus far it has shown a 
willingness to grant limited economic conces-
sions, and the Soviet Union has shown itself 
ready to render assistance for the solution of 
economic problems, which would make it ap-
pear unlikely that the economic situation will 
deteriorate sufficiently to bring about a 
marked increase in this type of resistance. 
32. There seems to be little possibility of in-
crease or change in resistance activity by the 
general population under foreseeable condi-
tions of peace if no Party upheaval occurs. 
The principal opportunity for maintaining at 
least some resistance potential is through 
Western propaganda, transmitting a feeling 
of hope and a sense of direction among the 
people. This may prevent complete apathy 
and cynicism and encourage the expression of 
grievances and demands by every semi-legal 
method, so that a spirit of resistance can be 
maintained and molded into the strongest 
possible instrument of pressure upon the Com-
munist regime.

SECRET 21 
33. Although any marked increase in East-
West tensions would have the effect of raising 
hopes of eventual liberation from the outside, 
Bulgarians would still not be disposed to un-
dertake liberation by themselves. Ideological 
and factional disputes, whether in the Bul-
garian leadership or in other Communist re-
gimes, have had little impact on resistance in 
Bulgaria. Bulgarians undoubtedly envy the 
greater freedom of Poland from Moscow's 
domination but have shown no disposition to 
emulate that country. Possibly Bulgarians 
are still doubtful of the permanence of Po-
land's status of greater autonomy. 
34. To a certain degree, the easing of security 
measures would act as a safety valve. A sud-
den relaxation of essential internal controls, 
however, might create a precarious situation 
unless it were accompanied by measures to 
remedy the basic causes of dissidence. It 
would be particularly dangerous, if, at the 
same time, an alternative political leader or 
faction emerged as a "liberal" force. Pres-
sures for the abolition of all oppressive con-
trols would mount, and it is doubtful that, 
under such circumstances, a strongly pro-
Soviet regime could maintain itself in power 
without Soviet military support. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
35. Under conditions of general warfare the 
resistance potential of the Bulgarian popula-
tion would increase considerably. The ruling 
Communist minority would be under unceas-
ing pressure from the antagonistic majority 
of Bulgarians, a situation which would prob-
ably result in more forthright action on the 
part of elements now passive and would 
theaten the political stability of the govern-
ment. Such instability would give rise to con-
siderable doubts on the part of many individ-
uals in the Party and state apparatus about 
the future of Communism, especially if Soviet 
defeat became apparent. Political opportu-
nists would emerge, with the result that the 
potential for widespread effective action would 
be sharply enhanced. Nevertheless, anti-re-
gime resistance activities could not be intensi-
fied initially. Only if Western forces appeared 
to be winning, would the Bulgarians engage 
in espionage, sabotage, and other harassing 
activities ? but not to the extent that might 
be expected by the people of other satellites 
under similar circumstances. 
36. During any type of war in the Balkan 
area, there would be almost no possibility of 
independent military action by anti-regime 
elements.' As in World War II, resistance 
groups ? if supplied with arms and explosives 
from the outside ? could tie down some Bloc 
forces through sabotage of rail lines and in-
dustrial plants. Bands of guerrilla fighters 
might be developed, but they would be entire-
ly dependent upon outside support. If ene-
my forces consisted of such traditional ene-
mies as Turks and Greeks, the Bulgarians 
would do very little to assist them. If the war 
were being fought by Western forces on, or 
adjacent to Bulgarian territory, the Bulgari-
ans might aid enemy forces by supplying in-
telligence, by destroying lines of communica-
tion, and by sabotaging Soviet Bloc supplies 
and installations. As indicated above, the 
extent of such activities would depend on the 
nationality of the enemy and upon logistic 
support from outside. However, the populace 
would probably not participate in evasion and 
escape activities until enemy forces were close 
to Bulgaria, and even then would weigh the 
risks involved very carefully. If military ac-
tion were taking place within Bulgaria or an 
area within the Bloc, Bulgarian resistance 
capabilities would be increased, and if the 
West appeared to be winning, there would be 
more anti-regime activities. If the Bloc coun-
tries appeared to be winning, the Bulgarians 
would have less capability and less inclina-
tion to help the West.

probably have little effect on Bulgarian re-

Staff, Intelligence, USAF would add the follow-
ing: It is possible that resistance groups could 
carry out limited independent military opera-
tions if the following three conditions prevailed: 
(a) disruption or diversion of the regime's means 
of internal control; (b) development in resist-
ance groups of effective leadership and coordina-
tion, and receipt of outside material support; 
and (c) assurance of early direct military sup-
port and relief.

ANNEX C?COMMUNIST CHINA 
PREAMBLE 
1. In the years following the Communist 
take-over in mainland China, the regime sup-
pressed organized resistance. During this 
period, the regime failed to gain the positive 
support of large segments of the population 
and created widespread apathy and dissatis-
faction. In the course of the past two years 
this situation has been aggravated. The vol-
ume and intensity of dissidence has increased 
significantly, particularly among the peas-
antry, the intellectuals, and some youth, most 
of whom were formerly inclined to accept the 
regime at least passively. Despite this in-
crease, however, there has been no significant 
organized resistance or active resistance on 
other than a purely local level, with the im-
portant exception of Tibet, where dissidence 
flared into armed rebellion in 1956, forcing 
important shifts in the Communist time-table 
for this area. 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
2. Among the most important causes of dis-
sidence are economic grievances. The re-
gime's policies of rapid industrialization, mili-
tary modernization, and socialization have 
required the diversion of substantial resources, 
which have been secured through demanding 
increased productivity while greatly restrict-
ing the benefits accruing to the people. In 
consequence, workers and peasants have been 
frustrated in failing to achieve promised levels 
of real income and well-being, while land-
owners and businessmen resent the loss of 
their properties to the state and the reduction 
in their income. Politically, the system of 
rigid regimentation and tight control over 
every aspect of life is generally resented, al-
though in varying degrees among different 
groups. Finally, Communist efforts to change 
age-old social concepts, such as that of the 
family hierarchy, have created considerable 
ill will. In contrast to Eastern European 
satellites, however, resentment of close ties 
with the USSR is not a nation-wide factor 
although it does affect the attitude of some 
groups. 
3. The Communist regime is now engaged in 
a gigantic effort to remake China's ancient 
society and create a modern, industrial state. 
This has involved a series of sweeping political, 
social, and economic changes, including at-
tempts to reshape education and to revamp 
organizational media for controlling and in-
doctrinating the populace. The innumerable 
pressures brought to bear by the regime and 
the disruption of traditional social pat-
terns have produced a widespread tension and 
insecurity. Not all these "strains and stresses" 
are the result of, or can be attributed to, the 
Communist system. Large segments of the 
population have remained indifferent, how-
ever; many others have adopted a wait-and-
see attitude; still others are willing to accept 
the regime because they believe its accom-
plishments and policies have improved their 
personal position or prospects. Considerable 
elements of the population feel they have 
gained rather than lost since the defeat of 
the Kuomintang. Thus anti-regime attitudes 
vary with differing conditions and among dif-
fering groups as they are affected by specific 
programs. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
4. Peasantry. The land reform of 1950-1952 
liquidated the landlords and redistributed 
land among the tenant, poor, and some mid-
dle-income peasants. These beneficiaries con-
stitute 75 percent of the total peasant popula-
tion which, in turn, constitutes the bulk of 
Communist China's population. Many of 
these peasants probably believed that they 
benefited from reform, and dissidence did not ? 
appear to be widespread except at times of

SECRET 
agricultural crisis, such as the crop failure 
01 1954. The regime's sudden rush into agri-
cultural socialization, following Mao's speech 
in July 1955, was largely completed in 1956. 
During this process, there were only few re-
ports of rural opposition, but by the end of 
1956, peasant dissatisfaction was again devel-
oping. The peasants resented the bureau-
cratic and inefficient management of the co-
operatives and/or collectives. They disliked 
having to increase their labor for the state, 
since this seriously affected the sideline 
occupations that traditionally contributed to 
their income. They were disillusioned be-
cause the regime did not fulfill its promise 
of an immediate rise in income. 
5. Reports on Chinese peasant dissidence are 
relatively convincing. Peiping has admitted 
widespread peasant withdrawals from collec-
tives in some areas, and has reported minor 
peasant uprisings in several provinces. How-
ever, an increase of peasant discontent will 
depend largely on whether the harvests are 
good or bad and on the willingness of the re-
gime to let the peasants enjoy more of the 
fruits of their labor. There is no uniformity 
in the pattern of discontent, and regional con-
ditions will continue to vary. 
6. Intellectuals. At the time of its establish-
ment, the regime enjoyed passive acceptance 
by, and in some cases the active support of, 
many of the country's intellectuals. However, 
despite continuous efforts to "reform" the in-
tellectuals, their attitude toward the regime 
has steadily deteriorated, except during a brief 
period in 1956-57 when the regime tolerated 
some degree of intellectual diversity. How-
ever, the effect of the "Hundred Flowers" 
policy has recently been negated by the "anti-
rightist struggle," which has been directed 
more at the intellectuals than at any other 
group. Disaffection among intellectuals has 
centered on lack of freedom to undertake orig-
inal research or creative activity not approved 
by the regime, on the Communist Party's 
domination of all significant aspects of public 
activity, and on inadequate material incen-
tives and inappropriate employment. 
7. Dissidence among the intellectuals is par-
ticularly significant because their skills and 
experience are badly needed by the regime. 
Many of those who have been attacked as 
"rightists" have achieved relatively high ? if 
often nominal ? positions in such fields as 
government administration and education. 
The vehemence of the regime's attack against 
intellectuals during the latter half of 1957 
testifies to the Communists' concern over the 
implications of opposition in this group. How 
successful the regime will be in its efforts 
to "reform" and "educate" the intellectuals 
is still uncertain. Recent events have prob-
ably increased the level of dissidence among 
them. Of equal importance is the probability 
that these same events, by bringing about a 
strengthening of controls over the intellectu-
als and curbing their influence, will greatly 
reduce their inclination and opportunities to 
translate dissidence into resistance. 
8. Youth. Initially, youth, and especially 
students, included some of the most ardent 
supporters of the regime and it appeared that 
dissidence among them was minor. However, 
a definite decline in enthusiasm for the re-
gime seems to have occurred. This is the 
result mainly of the regimentation, prosaic 
tasks and living conditions which face most 
youths during the present period of indus-
trialization in contrast to the expectations 
created by the establishment of a "New 
China," the Korean hostilities, the spread of 
Chinese Communist influence in the Asian-
African area, and the socialization period of 
1955-56. Dissatisfaction with their strictly 
controlled curriculum and their prospects for 
further education and for suitable employ-
ment has been evident. Generally being sen-
sitive to ideological matters, youth was also 
influenced to some extent by de-Stalinization 
and the Hungarian uprising. Such disaffec-
tion has in several cases erupted into stu-
dent riots. Although dissidence among youth 
may not be widespread at present, it remains 
a serious problem because it opens to question 
the fundamental Communist emphasis on the 
early molding of opinion. 
9. Former Businessmen. When the bulk of 
remaining private commerce and industry was 
socialized in 1956, there was virtually no 
overtly expressed opposition from the former 
SECRET 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/11 : CIA-RDP79R01012A010700020001-2 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/11 : CIA-RDP79R01012A010700020001-2 
SECRET 25 
proprietors. However, it was clear in the 
"anti-rightist struggle" that the regime did 
not consider the "bourgeoisie" resigned to 
current conditions. Except in certain indus-
trial-commercial centers such as Shanghai, 
and except for connections with other groups 
such as the intellectuals, the "bourgeoisie" 
now has negligible political or economic power. 
Dissidence among former private businessmen, 
while widespread, is thus significant only 
to the extent that it limits the regime's ability 
to utilize their technical and managerial skills. 
Former businessmen possess talents which 
cannot yet be matched by a new Communist 
trained generation, and their dissatisfaction 
with the regime, and the consequent distrust 
of them by the regime will be an adverse fac-
tor of some but not crucial importance in 
the economic development of the country. 
10. Armed Forces. In the active Chinese Com-
munist military service there is virtually no 
dissidence and no likelihood of resistance. 
This is reflected in current low desertion rates 
and is the result of close Party control of all 
levels, careful selection of personnel for mili-
tary service, constant indoctrination and sur-
veillance of all military personnel, highly 
preferential treatment of military personnel, 
constant attention to officer-enlisted civilian 
relationships, and prompt action to ease or 
eradicate tensions and other problems. Ex-
'Nationalist defectors and other disloyal per-
sonnel have been eliminated from the service; 
equipment, food, clothing, and shelter are 
available in generally satisfactory quantities 
by Chinese standards; the pay and leave situ-
ation is improved; and terms of service are set 
by law. There is a close relationship between 
armed forces and the civilian component of 
the Peiping regime. The top military com-
manders are all Party veterans and concur-
rently hold high Party posts. The majority of 
the rank and file of the armed forces belong 
either to the Party or the Young Communist 
League. 
11. Militia. There are several million mem-
bers of the People's Militia ? a heterogeneous 
group whose functions, training, equipment, 
and social standing vary throughout the 
country. It is probable that there are Militia 
members who are dissatisfied with their role 
and resent having to give up their spare time 
to unrewarding work. The great majority of 
the Militia, however, probably are loyal to the 
regime. Dissidence among this group is more 
apt to reflect their status as peasants rather 
than their para-military position. 
12. Veterans. The demobilization of over five 
million men from the armed forces since 1949 
has created a sizable population group who 
face many problems. In at least one province 
demobilized servicemen have been blamed re-
cently for trouble in rural areas. The vet-
erans therefore constitute a group within 
which there are dissident feelings and within 
which there is probably a certain amount of 
potential resistance and possibly some actual 
resistance. Many veterans are disgruntled 
and unhappy because they have been forced 
to leave the comparative security and prestige 
of service life for the much more difficult life 
of a peasant. Additionally, numbers of them 
wanted to work in the cities after discharge 
but were forced to return to the rural areas 
where dissatisfaction has arisen over employ-
ment, housing, and acceptance given them by 
the villagers. At present, dissidence among 
veterans is not intense and is not likely to 
develop into a serious security threat. Never-
theless, the veterans, trained in the use of 
arms, experienced in guerrilla warfare, and 
bound together by a common background, 
constitute a potentially serious security prob-
lem. 
13. Communist Leadership. The Chinese 
Communist Party and regime has demon-
strated unusual cohesiveness and unity at its 
highest levels. With virtually the sole excep-
tion of the Kao-Jao affair in 1954-55, the 
regime has adjusted policy differences and 
other internal disputes without recourse to 
drastic purges and without evidencing dissi-
dence among disgruntled leaders. When Mao 
dies or retires from active leadership, some 
diminution of party unity can be expected, 
with struggles for power among the senior 
party leaders who would probably collectively 
succeed Mao in his various functions. How-
ever, it seems unlikely that even Mao's death 
would cause a serious leadership crisis that 
would critically affect the party's cohesiveness 
and effectiveness.

14. At lower levels of the Communist Party 
there appears to be a certain amount of dis-
content, seldom intense enough to be called 
disidence. Rural cadres are particularly sus-
ceptible to occasional misgivings. They are 
often forced to lead a peasant-level life; they 
miss the companionship and cultural activi-
ties available in urban centers. Blame for a 
failure of the regime's policies is often laid to 
them directly. They find themselves caught 
between the millstones of Peiping's policies 
and the realities of their immediate environ-
ment, and there is evidence that some of them 
occasionally identify themselves more directly 
with the peasants than with Party demands. 
Dissidence in the Party is likely to become 
significant only if the regime has major eco-
nomic reverses or if dissidence within other 
major groups becomes acute. 
15. Government Bureaucracy. While key 
positions in the bureaucracy are held by Party 
members, there are a substantial number of 
nonmembers in it who are rewarded less gen-
erously both in a material and psychological 
sense, and who accordingly are more prone to 
be dissatisfied with the regime. Criticisms of 
the regime by non-Party persons in mid-1957 
revealed a considerable degree of resentment 
in the bureaucracy over the preferential posi-
tion of Party members and the Party's unwill-
ingness to grant authority to nonmembers. 
At the same time, many such persons have a 
vested interest in the regime which may par-
tially negate any dissident tendencies. In the 
future, the level of dissidence in this group 
will be largely determined by the Party's will-
ingness to improve its methods of working 
with the group. 
16. Religious Groups. Organized religious 
groups have been significant sources of dissi-
dence chiefly in minority-inhabited areas of 
Communist China, most notably in Tibet and 
in some Hui (Moslem) areas. In China proper 
organized religion is not of great numerical 
importance because the great majority of Chi-
nese take an informal, eclectic view of religion, 
adopting elements of a number of religions 
without formal adherence to any. Despite 
their relatively small membership some of the 
organized religious groups in China proper 
are nevertheless significant as sources of dissi-
dence and passive resistance. In some cases 
the regime's moves against religious groups or 
adherents has aroused resentment. Members 
of a number of religious groups continue pas-
sive resistance against the regime despite con-
certed drives against some religious groups 
(particularly Catholics) and Communist ef-
forts to organize religious adherents into front 
organizations that are susceptible to Commu-
nist control and that support the regime's pro-
gram (fronts for Buddhists, Moslems, Protes-
tants, Catholics, and Taoists have been or-
ganized). 
17. Superstitious Sects. In addition to the 
above, certain semi-religious sects, including 
such secret societies as the I-kuan-tao, have 
figured in Communist admissions of unrest 
and local rebellion. These sects with an 
ideology based on elements of various religions 
and superstitions have been subjected to con-
tinuous Communist suppression efforts, but 
probably continue to exist on a local level in 
many rural parts of China, where they appar-
ently succeed from time to time in organizing 
minor peasant rebellions through appeals to 
magic and superstition and through exploita-
tion of various peasant grievances. None of 
these sects, however, appears to have retained 
an effective national or even regional organi-
zation or following. 
18. Minorities. The ethnic minorities in 
China traditionally have resisted the expan-
sionist tendencies of the predominant Han 
Chinese. In actual practice the Communist 
regime has continued the engulfment of the 
minorities by the Han Chinese. This pre-
sumably has led to dissatisfaction among the 
minorities which, in turn, has produced cor-
rective efforts to curb "great Han chau-
vinism." Aside from Tibet ? a special case 
where the dissidence has flared into active 
resistance ? the extent of disaffection 
among minorities is not known, but the fre-
quent reference to the regime's corrective for 
"great Han chauvinism" indicates that some 
exists. 
19. Former Overseas Chinese. There are ap-
proximately 12,000,000 persons in mainland 
China, concentrated largely in Kwangtung 
and Fukien provinces, who are considered 
SECRET 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/11 : CIA-RDP79R01012A010700020001-2

SECRET 27 
"Overseas Chinese" by virtue of previous resi-
dence abroad or as "Overseas Chinese de-
pendents" because they have relatives abroad. 
Members of this group have been treated with 
greater leniency than the rest of the popula-
tion; they have received preferential rations, 
and have occasionally been excluded from 
some of the most onerous consequences of the 
1955-56 socialist transformation. Neverthe-
less, some dissidence probably exists in this 
group; accustomed in the past to an above-
average standard of living and more knowl-
edgeable about the outside world, they proba-
bly resent various aspects of Chinese Commu-
nist policies. 
20. Urban Workers. The urban workers are 
cultivated as the mass base of the regime. 
Despite preferential treatment since 1949, dis-
affection has developed among urban workers 
in some areas and, in several cases, has 
resulted in strikes. While many factory 
workers now have more job security and 
material rewards than in pre-Communist 
days, there is resentment of the psy-
chological pressures, such as high work 
norms, and dissatisfaction that living stand-
ards have not improved more rapidly. How-
ever, dissidence among urban workers does 
not appear to be widespread nor intense. As 
in the case of youth, however, dissidence 
among workers is regarded with the utmost 
concern by the regime on ideological grounds. 
21. Former National Government Officials. 
Of the National government officials who did 
not escape to Taiwan, a small number are col-
laborating with the Peiping. regime, more are 
probably still in prison or in labor camps, and 
still more are retired or not fully active. The 
collaborators work for the regime either be-
cause of a timely shift of allegiance to the 
Communists before or when the regime was 
established or because their valuable technical 
skills have earned them a special position. 
Some of this group probably resent the dom-
ination of the Communist Party and may be 
dissatisfied with conditions. But they would 
be cautious about exposing their dissatisfac-
tion because of their own past history. The 
noncollaborators in many cases have been 
branded as enemies of the regime from the 
beginning. They unquestionably are dissatis-
fied with their present condition, but to an 
even greater extent than the collaborating 
group, must suppress their feelings. 
22. Tibetans. The Tibetans for centuries 
have used every means at their disposal to 
resist the imposition of political, military, eco-
nomic, or cultural controls by whatever Chi-
nese government has been in power. Proba-
bly a majority of them has continued to resist 
all efforts of the Chinese Communist regime 
to bring Tibet under the centralized control of 
Peiping. This has been true not only of the 
Tibetans living in what the Chinese Commu-
nists refer to as the "Tibet region," but equal-
ly so of the seminomadic Tibetan tribes who 
live in Tibetan areas now included in the 
provinces of Tsinghai, Kansu, and Szechwan. 
Among the causes of Tibetan resistance have 
been resentment at Chinese interference with 
Tibetan religious activities, Communist indoc-
trination of Tibetan youth, attempts to "re-
form" Tibetan society, food shortages and in-
flation, and Peiping's failure to honor a 
promise to release certain imprisoned Tibetan 
leaders. 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
23. While it may be possible, on the basis of 
the preceding analyses, to make an assess-
ment in general terms of the major sources 
and areas of ill will, the intensity of dissidence 
in Communist China and the degree to which 
it may be transformed into actual resistance 
remain largely matters of conjecture. It is 
logical to conclude that some degree of dissi-
dence exists at almost every level of Commu-
nist Chinese society. However, this does not 
mean that such dissidence can develop into 
resistance unless the control capabilities of 
the regime were greatly weakened. 
24. The regime's policies and practices, de-
spite the "rectification campaign," have ac-
centuated a number of factors causing ill will. 
At the same time, the regime has developed 
and exploited the growing pride of the Chi-
nese people in their country's achievements, 
particularly their military strength and their 
new international prestige. As in the USSR, 
Communism was imposed on the people by 
indigenous elements in the face of seemingly

overwhelming odds rather than by a foreign 
power. These points are recognized, mainly 
by members of the "intelligentsia." The bulk 
of the people are illiterate peasants and know 
little of and care less about ideology and na-
tional policies. They are preoccupied with 
local affairs. They judge a regime by the 
extent to which it exploits them. However, 
in the vast majority of cases, dissidence is not 
translated into organized, active resistance. 
Sometimes it has led, and may lead in the 
future, to unorganized passive resistance 
which is more difficult to detect and to sup-
press but has far less potential than has the 
revolutionary mood in some Eastern Euro-
pean satellites. 
TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
25. Events following Stalin's death and the 
uprisings in Poland and Hungary in 1956 had 
relatively little influence on the level of re-
sistance in Communist China. Peiping's 
unique status in the Communist world, its 
geographic location, its different problems 
and the newness of its revolutionary experi-
ment precluded any necessity to follow the 
Kremlin line. However, events since the So-
viet 20th Party Congress in February 1956 did 
have some impact even though the Chinese 
Communists successfully minimized the shock 
of Stalin's denigration. Whatever confusion 
existed apparently contributed only slightly 
to dissidence or resistance and was to some 
extent alleviated by official explanations and 
by claims that the Chinese Communist lead-
ers had avoided the pitfalls into which the 
USSR had slipped. 
26. Between 1954 and 1957, there were two 
peaks of resistance activity in mainland 
China. The first, in late 1954 and early 1955, 
was occasioned primarily by the poor harvests 
of 1954 and led to the drive against "counter-
revolutionaries" personally ordered by Mao 
Tse-tung in the spring of 1955. The drive did 
not reach the proportions of earlier similar 
drives, even though 360,000 cases of subver-
sion and "economic sabotage" were admitted-
ly dealt with in 1954 and early 1955. It was 
credited by the Communists with creating the 
preconditions necessary for popular accept-
ance of the wholesale collectivization and so-
cialization campaign inaugurated by Mao Tse-
tung in mid-1955. The second peak of resist-
ance in 1956-57, was occasioned by poor crops, 
food shortages, and disappointing economic 
conditions following collectivization and so-
cialization. It has not occasioned a formal 
drive against "counterrevolutionaries," but 
appears to be one of the underlying causes of 
the current "rectification" drive. In addition, 
the period was marked by considerable resist-
ance activity by the Tibetans, culminating in 
serious but somewhat localized rebellion in 
1956. 
27. The upheavals in Poland and Hungary 
also had some effect, as the Peiping regime 
itself admitted. As a result, the Communist 
leaders, in order to forestall possible popular 
unrest, granted that "contradictions" existed 
and accelerated the "rectification" campaign. 
This experiment partially backfired and the 
Party was forced to revert to its long-used 
methods of controlling public opinion, which 
undoubtedly contributed to discontent in the 
minds of some non-Party people. Moreover, 
the shifting of policies may also have gener-
ated considerable disagreement among Party 
leaders. But the main significance of these 
recent developments on the question of dissi-
dence and resistance lies in the probability 
that the Chinese Communist leaders now have 
a better appreciation of the extent of discon-
tent and a strengthened determination to 
crush, by forceful means if necessary, any sig-
nificant overt manifestations of this discon-
tent. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
28. As already intimated, resistance in Com-
munist China was not appreciably affected by 
the death of Stalin and subsequent events. 
Rather, the course of such resistance was de-
termined by local conditions. Except among 
certain tribal minorities it is estimated that 
virtually no organized resistance of a signifi-
cant scale existed in Communist China at the 
time of Stalin's death. In some areas organ-
ized groups may have survived from the time 
of the Communist takeover, but they were 
almost certainly few and small.

SECRET 29 
(a) Organized Resistance 
29. A few incidents of active, organized resist-
ance on a purely local basis have occurred. 
For example, it is probable that uprisings 
against local authorities occurred in South-
west Sinkiang in 1954 and 1956. Seemingly, 
there was considerable popular participation 
in these incidents, and arms were reportedly 
used against government authorities and 
troops. Additionally, during 1956 there were 
reliable reports, some of which were admitted 
by the Peiping regime, of revolts in western 
Szechwan, an area outside of Tibet, but popu-
lated by Tibetans. Persistent reports have 
also been received of the spread of these upris-
ings to Tibet proper, and of the use of military 
aircraft by the Communists to quell the dis-
turbances. At least one revolt was reliably 
reported during 1956 in the Liangshan Yi 
Autonomous Chou, an area populated by the 
Yi minority rather than Tibetans, in what is 
now western Szechwan. 
30. An organized resistance group in Tibet, 
the Mimang, presumably had its origin at the 
time of the Communist occupation in late 
1951, but did not come to the fore until about 
1956. The numerical strength of this group 
is not known. The Mimang probably does not 
engage in specific training, the effectiveness 
of the group depending on the natural in-
clination of these people towards guerrilla-
type warfare. The group's appeal stems from 
the antipathy Tibetans feel toward Han Chi-
nese and their loyalty to Lamaism which binds 
them together in opposition to both the Han 
and fellow Tibetans who have cooperated with 
the Communists. Except for supplies cap-
tured from the Chinese Communist military 
forces, the weapons of the Mimang are prob-
ably limited to ancient rifles and homemade 
weapons. They probably operate in fairly 
small groups largely against targets of con-
venience. 
31. Another organized anti-Communist Chi-
nese resistance group consists mainly of emi-
gres in Indian border towns. It is believed 
that the Dalai Lama's brother, Gyalo Thon-
dup, is connected with the group. This group 
may be supporting some of the resistance 
activities in Tibet. 
(b) Unorganized Resistance 
32. Unorganized resistance on the China 
mainland has appeared sporadically but there 
is no indication of a definite pattern of such 
activities or of a concerted effort on the part 
of the population against the regime. Peri-
odic, spontaneous acts of resistance have 
taken place but remain localized, limited to 
certain social, minority, and religious groups. 
They have never presented a serious threat 
to the regime although it has at times led the 
regime significantly to alter some of its 
policies. 
33. Resentment of the peasants against the 
compulsory cooperative system has expressed 
itself in such forms of passive resistance as 
withholding taxes, refusing to participate in 
government-sponsored programs to increase 
agricultural and livestock production, and to 
withdrawals from cooperatives. In 1956, a 
considerable number of provinces failed to 
meet their tax quotas. During 1957, 307 co-
operatives in Kiangsu Province alone distrib-
uted grain to their members without allotting 
any for the public tax. 
34. General dissatisfaction among urban 
workers over unsatisfactory working condi-
tions (such as the speed-up system and exces-
sive required overtime) and against unsatis-
factory living conditions (such as poor hous-
ing and lack of consumer goods) has taken 
the form of strikes and passive resistance, in-
cluding slowdowns, absenteeism and extensive 
use of "sick-leave." Unorganized active resist-
ance is illustrated in a People's Daily report of 
23 July 1957 of 253 cases of sabotage or sus-
pected sabotage in factories and enterprises 
in Canton. 
35. Unorganized resistance among students 
has taken the form of sporadic strikes and 
riots. In the early autumn of 1956 only 40 
out of 4,000 students at a Peiping University 
attended what was supposed to be a compul-
sory discussion of the "Political Current 
Events Report." 
36. Dissidence among intellectuals was ex-
pressed by intensive criticism of the Commu-
nist regime during the "bloom and contend"

SECRET 
period (not classified as "counterrevolution" 
by the Communists) , and by occasional defec-
tions to Hong Kong. Nevertheless, the intel-
lectuals who make up the "democratic" minor 
parties that collaborate with the Peiping re-
gime have in those parties unique instruments 
for maintaining contact with one another, 
even though they have no mass following and 
are limited to major cities. Some individual 
intellectuals have apparently utilized these 
parties and other contacts to build up small 
personal followings. However, it appears that 
in almost all cases, dissident intellectuals 
hoped to use such contacts not to overthrow 
the regime but to exercise a "moderating" or 
"restraining" influence on it. 
37. One of the most persistent problems for 
the regime is resistance to the Communist 
program by many of the non-Han Chinese 
minorities, particularly in the border areas. 
In addition to resistance by the Tibetans, the 
Communists have admitted uprisings also 
among the Turki peoples of Sinkiang in De-
cember 1954 and in March 1956, and resist-
ance among the Hui (Moslems) of Kansu at 
unspecified periods. Minority areas include 
some of the most remote and inaccessible 
parts of China, areas from which even rumors 
are slow to leak to the outside world. 
Peiping's concern with minority dissidence is 
reflected in the general moderation of Com-
munist policies in minority areas, and in the 
continuing warnings in Chinese Communist 
propaganda against the error of "great Han 
chauvinism." The most significant fact con-
cerning resistance in minority areas is not so 
much the occasional outburst of rebellion, but 
rather the fact that the Communists have 
established effective control in some areas 
which for centuries have been breeding 
grounds for rebellion against Chinese author-
ity. In the past few years the traditionally 
troublesome area of Sinkiang has been ex-
hibited regularly to visiting dignitaries from 
Moslem countries, indicating that whatever 
rebellious activity may persist is at most local 
in extent. 
38. Except for the secret sects, the Hui (Mos-
lems) , and the Tibetan Buddhists, there has 
been no recent significant, active resistance to 
the regime by religious groups. However, the 
basic divergence between Communism and re-
ligious adherence manifests itself in passive 
resistance by many of the religious communi-
cants throughout mainland China, reflected 
in continuing arrests of religious figures and 
in the restrictions imposed on such groups as 
Catholics. The regime has attempted to deal 
with this passive resistance by organizing 
Communist-front organizations of Moslems, 
Buddhists, Protestants, and most recently, 
Catholics and Taoists. While these attempts 
have been partially successful, some passive 
resistance continues among these groups. 
39. The "rectification" campaign which 
spread throughout China as a consequence of 
Mao Tse-tung's speech on contradictions in 
February 1957, indicates that the Communist 
Party has taken serious cognizance of the 
existence of widespread antagonism toward 
the regime although the Communist leaders 
appear to have initially underestimated this 
antagonism. Peiping is fully capable of main-
taining internal security, however, and pros-
pects for an uprising along the Hungarian 
lines are unlikely to develop in the forseeable 
future. The fact that the regime has made 
minor concessions to counteract dissidence, 
such as the recent withdrawals of Chinese 
civilian cadres from Tibet and the relaxation 
of some policies in the face of peasant unrest, 
does not mean the regime is incapable of con-
trolling the masses. In the overall picture, 
resistance in its various overt forms appears 
to be of minor significance ? not accurately 
reflecting the large extent of underlying dis-
sidence. That dissidence expresses itself in 
apathy and lack of positive response to the 
regime's programs however, and constitutes 
one of Peiping's chief problems. The principal 
significance of such dissidence and resistance 
as presently exist or is predictable in Commu-
nist China lies not in any revolutionary threat 
to the regime itself but rather in the evolu-
tionary effect it may have on the regime's 
policies. Lack of popular cooperation may 
delay the achievement of some of the Chinese 
Communists' objectives, particularly in the 
economic field, and may force the leaders to 
modify some policies. In particular, peasant 
dissidence may reduce agricultural production

SECRET 31 
and hamper the regime's efforts to collect 
agricultural surplus. This in turn, by its 
effect on food supplies, would increase dissi-
dence in urban groups. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
40. There is a small group of Tibetans, in 
Kalimpong, India, composed of persons who 
have fled from Tibet since 1951. Some mem-
bers of this emigre group are former high-
ranking officials, and others were members of 
the Dalai Lama's retinue on his trip to India 
in the winter of 1956-1957. This group has 
reportedly tried to obtain aid from the Indian 
government, both in removing the Chinese 
Communists from Tibet and in granting asy-
lum to the Dalai Lama. These attempts have 
been unsuccessful, although there is a possi-
bility that the recent Chinese Communist de-
cision to postpone the socialization of Tibet 
may have been somewhat influenced by rep-
resentations from India and other "neutral" 
countries. 
41. The more than 12 million Overseas Chi-
nese who inhabit the various countries of 
Southeast Asia do not seem to be playing a 
significant part in guiding or aiding resistance 
activities in the homeland. There is a contin-
uing bond between the Overseas Chinese and 
their ancestral land, and undoubtedly they are 
proud of the emergence of China as a world 
power, even though they may be opposed to 
Communism. These Chinese abroad continue 
to send back regular monetary contributions 
to their families on the mainland, and until 
recently there was a substantial flow of young 
Chinese back to the mainland for their educa-
tion. This flow has declined during 1957. 
There is no evidence of Overseas Chinese con-
tact with, or aid to, any resistance group in 
Communist China. 
CHINESE NATIONALIST ACTIVITIES 
42. The Government of the Republic of China 
on Taiwan is the most important group of 
Chinese outside of the China Mainland and 
has a limited potential to guide and assist 
resistance groups on the mainland. They 
have well organized and equipped military 
units numbering over 600,000 including all 
services. Although these forces pose no real 
threat to the existence of the Chinese Com-
munist regime, they are able, with outside 
support, to maintain a certain amount of mili-
tary pressure along the central east China 
coast. Although the Nationalists conduct 
small-scale ground actions, propaganda mis-
sions and other air operations, and harass the 
Communists by artillery and naval patrol 
activity, they are not capable under present 
circumstances of maintaining major military 
operations on the mainland or of providing 
significant military support to other dissident 
or resistance elements on the mainland. 
43. The most persistent category of "counter-
revolutionary" activity to appear in Commu-
nist news and propaganda is that of Nation-
alist subversion, infiltration, espionage, and 
sabotage. Most of this activity is reported to 
be concentrated in the coastal region of Com-
munist China, particularly in the area op-
posite the Nationalist-held offshore islands. 
Communist charges concerning Nationalist 
activities almost invariably deal with single 
agents or small groups of a half dozen or less, 
who are usually said to have surrendered or 
been apprehended almost immediately after 
being landed. The Communists have avoided 
implying that a widespread Nationalist net-
work may exist on the mainland or that the 
Nationalists have organizational or communi-
cations lines to resistance groups that may be 
active, and there is little information avail-
able to determine the extent of popular sym-
pathy toward Nationalist efforts on the main-
land. 
44. In northern Burma, and also in Laos and 
Thailand, former Chinese Nationalist irregu-
lars numbering approximately 4,000-6,000 
continue to exist. Although Taiwan has offi-
cially severed all ties with these elements, it is 
believed that the Chinese Nationalists still 
maintain contact with and provide limited 
support for these units. While these ex-Na-
tionalist troops possess limited capabilities 
and presently confine their activities to main-
taining their existence, they must, neverthe-
less, be considered as a potential resistance 
group.

REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
45. The characteristic response of the Peiping 
regime to dissidence has been to combat it 
with the propaganda and administrative re-
sources of the vast interlocking state-party 
apparatus. It also has been characteristic 
to alternate pressure and relaxation and to 
make concessions when expedient. Resist-
ance, on the other hand, almost invariably 
has been dealt with by uncompromising sup-
pression by the machinery of the police state. 
In addition to an extensive police network 
and the armed forces, the repressive machin-
ery of the regime has been extended into all 
spheres by a system of occupational organiza-
tions, urban residence committees, and rural 
collectives. The existence of this tremendous 
security apparatus, the incessant program of 
indoctrination and propaganda, the strictness 
of travel controls, the rigid control of press, 
publications and radio, and the unceasing 
regimentation of people in every walk of life, 
explain the disappearance of earlier resistance 
groups and the lack of present organized re-
sistance. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
46. Communist China is a police state, and it 
is difficult to draw clear distinctions between 
its military forces and its security forces. The 
powerful People's Liberation Army (PLA) , 
numerically the largest army in the world, 
with an estimated strength of two and one 
half million men, has a strong political back-
ground dating back to the days when the 
army and the Party were one. The People's 
Armed Policy (PAP) numbers more than 
500,000. 
47. A part of the stated mission of the PLA 
is the maintenance of internal security. The 
nature of PLA organization, and the organiza-
tion of the PAP under the Ministry of Public 
Security imply that the detection and sup-
pression of dissidence and minor resistance 
activity is a function primarily of the PAP, 
while only major, well-organized resistance 
requiring relatively extensive military opera-
tions in the field would become a target for 
PLA activity. To accomplish such missions 
the PLA has Public Security regiments and 
divisions as well as its regularly organized 
ground, air, and naval forces. The Public 
Security units are small, lightly armed ver-
sions of their regular counterparts and have 
served in regular military operations. They 
are, however, well suited for operations in the 
field against irregular forces such as might 
be organized by resistance movements. The 
effectiveness of the PLA in maintaining in-
ternal security in China has been outstanding. 
48. In addition to the PLA and the PAP, the 
People's Militia appears to have an internal 
security role in rural areas. Its members are 
subject to part-time duty, and most are poorly 
armed and trained. The effectiveness of the 
militia in suppressing resistance activity is 
probably very low. However, it undoubtedly 
serves as a fairly useful group in maintaining 
surveillance over the peasantry and reporting 
possible dissidence or other suspicious activity 
to local Communist authorities. 
49. Moreover, the security forces have a very 
close relationship with the mass organizations 
which link the formal government and Party 
agencies with the various social groups in the 
population. These organizations, with a 
membership of many millions, extend the gov-
ernment's control down to the lowliest local 
neighborhood organization in the towns and 
to the cooperative level in the rural areas. 
Street and Lane Committees function as ex-
tensions of the police apparatus in urban 
areas. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
50. In peacetime, organized resistance to the 
Peiping regime has virtually no chance of 
developing on a significant scale. With the 
possible exception of the Tibetan revolts, re-
sistance in Communist China in recent years 
arose in reaction to specific local grievances. 
Effective internal security controls will con-
tinue to prevent potential resistance elements 
from organizing. The same strict controls 
will confine unorganized resistance to certain 
limited types of action largely of a passive 
character.

SECRET 
51. Resistance activity is handicapped by a 
number of key factors. The Party, army, and 
police are loyal to the regime. Dissident ele-
ments, although widespread throughout the 
population, with few exceptions, lack organi-
zation or communication with one another 
and generally lack the necessary appreciation 
of each other's problems and grievances to co-
operate in active resistance on a wider scale. 
There is thus no presently identifiable basis 
for an anti-Communist front known to exist 
in Communist China. Dissident students and 
intellectuals who might conceivably provide 
leadership for a resistance movement, as they 
have in past periods in Chinese history, are 
disillusioned and demoralized. The "Hun-
dred Flowers" period probably brought forth 
the maximum effort and even that effort al-
most certainly cannot be repeated in view of 
stringent measures. 
52. The main factor that might affect the re-
sistance potential in China is the state of the 
economy. Improvements in economic condi-
tions sufficient to permit more liberal eco-
nomic incentives would decrease popular ill 
will, while a deterioration of economic condi-
tions would increase resistance activity. A 
general economic crisis could conceivably cre-
ate conditions under which organized resist-
ance on a larger scale could develop and unor-
ganized resistance be considerably intensified. 
Even in such a case, however, it could not be 
assumed that a revolt would be possible on 
more than limited local levels, where the re-
gime could suppress it with dispatch. In the 
special case of Tibetan resistance there ap-
pears to have been at least some degree of 
organization, motivated not solely by local 
grievances but also by a revulsion against 
Communism and a hatred of the Chinese 
invaders. 
53. If there is little potential for active re-
sistance in Communist China at present, there 
is nevertheless a substantial potential for dis-
sidence. The Communist program of maxi-
mum investment in heavy industry will con-
tinue to lead to a great measure of dissatis-
faction and disillusionment throughout the 
population and particularly among the peas-
ants. However, Communist countermeasures 
33 
and devices for persuasion and force are suffi-
ciently well developed to enable Peiping, if it 
continues to demonstrate the flexibility of 
policy it has exhibited to date, to confine dis-
sidence to manageable levels and to prevent 
outbreaks of resistance in other than isolated, 
local instances. Nevertheless, dissidence will 
probably continue to be a limiting faetor for 
the regime's program. The significance of 
dissidence lies not in a revolutionary threat to 
the regime, but rather in the effect it may 
have on the evolution of the regime's policies 
and the country's future development. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
54. The extent of resistance in Communist 
China would depend on the nature and for-
tunes of the war. If the regime's military 
operations were successful, or the Communists 
could make it appear that it was, Peiping 
probably could rally many dissident elements 
to its side by an appeal to Chinese nationalism 
and xenophobia. In this case, dissidence 
would probably remain inactive and covert, as 
it did during the Korean war. If the regime 
suffered military setbacks, it is still doubtful 
whether resistance forces would be capable of 
strong and effective independent guerrilla 
action, even with help from abroad, unless 
Peiping security controls and propaganda 
facilities were seriously weakened. Under cir-
cumstances of fairly impressive non-Commu-
nist military successes, anti-regime operations 
in Communist-controlled territory would 
probably still be difficult, with the population 
generally avoiding the risks involved in 
organizing for or engaging in outright 
rebellion, or in assisting non-Communist 
intelligence or escape and evasion efforts. 
If the tide seemed to be clearly turn-
ing against the Communists, major defections 
from the Communist cause might be expected, 
and isolated and individual resistance activi-
ties would increase. But even under these 
conditions most types of resistance activities 
behind the Communist lines requiring an 
organizational effort would probably be a 
minor factor at least initially because of the 
time required to organize and train the re-
sistance elements. If the war were a pro-

SECRET 
longed one, passive peasant resistance might 
become particularly significant by affecting 
the regime's food supply. 
55. If a situation develops in which resistance 
elements could emerge, they would face a 
number of basic difficulties in developing a 
capability to harass the regime through guer-
rilla and political warfare activities, including 
sabotage. To provide any resistance efforts of 
military significance, groups would require 
effective leadership, coordination and material 
support. Moreover, the effort to develop such 
an organization would take place in a country 
where the bulk of the population is not prone 
to political action but rather tends to adopt a 
"wait and see" policy. Because of this tradi-
tional attitude, it is believed that lodgements 
in such strength as to assure early direct mili-
tary support and relief would be required. 
By the same token, however, the average Chi-
nese does not want to offend those who may 
succeed in taking over control of his country, 
an attitude that may under some circum-
stances assist in escape and evasion opera-
tions and intelligence collection efforts. 
56. The nationality of the attacking forces 
would make some difference; Chinese forces 
from Taiwan would probably meet with a fair 
amount of popular acceptance, while Japanese 
forces would probably arouse the traditional 
antipathy against Japan, particularly in those 
parts of China with a tradition of guerrilla 
resistance against the Japanese. American 
participation would enable the Communist 
regime to appeal for popular support on the 
basis of Chinese nationalism and xenophobia, 
but would not be likely to antagonize potential 
active resistance elements. Furthermore, US 
participation might create the impression 
that the attack is likely to be successful. The 
nationality of other Asian or non-Asian forces 
would not be of major psychological signifi-
cance. The really decisive psychological fac-
tor would not be the nationality of the forces 
engaged, but the prospect of military success 
or failure. 
57. The use of nuclear weapons in an attack 
against the Chinese mainland which severely 
crippled the regime's control mechanisms 
would create an opportunity for some indig-
enous resistance. Initially at least, as indi-
cated earlier, resistance efforts would be 
handicapped by lack of organization, and in 
this case, the disruptive nature of the attack 
would almost ensure that any actions would 
be localized. Moreover, it seems probable that 
the regime's local control agencies will rally 
to maintain their position and will pose a 
threat to the establishment of a strong re-
sistance organization. To the extent that 
nuclear weapons were used for more tactical 
purposes than total destruction of the re-
gime's control mechanisms, the problems in 
organizing effective resistance described above 
would obtain.1 
58. Existence under stringent Communist 
control has created among the masses of Chi-
nese a great tolerance to harsh authority. It 
is probable that a relatively strict occupation 
policy would, by comparison, seem preferable 
to regimentation under Communism so long 
as no heavy demands were placed on the local 
economy for food, clothing, and shelter. How-
ever, a liberal occupation policy, especially 
one which provided for the relief of the needy, 
would undoubtedly tend to foster increased 
resistance activities in unconquered areas. 
59. It is doubtful that the attitudes and ac-
tions of either regimes or resistance groups in 
other Sino-Soviet Bloc countries, with the pos-
sible exception of Soviet actions, would have 
any strong effect on resistance potential. 
Basic contributing factors to this are the lack 
of an efficient resistance organization in 
China, the isolation of resistance groups 
Since this study has repeatedly demonstrated 
the existence of widespread dissident elements 
throughout the population and because a vast 
reservoir of emergent resistance leadership prob-
ably exists among former business leaders, intel-
lectuals, and elements of the 5,000,000 veterans 
discharged from the army since 1949, the repre-
sentative of the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intel-
ligence, USAF, believes the conclusion is justi-
fied that the elimination of selected targets im-
portant to the military and control strengths of 
Communist China and the widespread resultant 
disruption would greatly promote effective action 
on the part of dissident elements rather than 
discourage such action.

with groups in other countries. In the case 
of European bloc nations, the isolation result-
ing from distance and terrain and racial and 
cultural differences add to the unlikelihood 
that cooperation of any sort would eventuate.

tudes and consequently the capabilities of in-
dividuals and groups willing to engage in re-

ANNEX D ? CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. Even though the old Czechoslovak Republic 
had a more vigorous democratic tradition than 
any other Eastern European country and 
was strongly Western-oriented, Communist 
strength was greater in Czechoslovakia than 
in the other present satellites. In the last 
free elections in 1946, Communist candidates 
got 38 percent of the votes. Since the 1948 
coup, however, the Communists' drastic re-
shaping of Czechoslovak political and eco-
nomic life has alienated many one-time sym-
pathizers and even many Party members. 
Today, despite a surface appearance of 
calm and stability, the Czechoslovak pop-
ulation harbors considerable ? though sup-
pressed ? dissatisfaction with the regime and 
with the USSR of which the regime is one of 
the most faithful servants. This dissatisfac-
tion has been accumulating and becoming 
more apparent since the death of Stalin in 
1953. 
2. Among the factors that have tended to 
create ill will are the following: The regime's 
subservience to the USSR and the resulting 
subordination of CSR interests to those of the 
USSR; the efforts of the regime to reshape 
CSR society in the Soviet image with the con-
comitant adulation and copying of everything 
Soviet, falsification of history, repudiation of 
native traditions and severing historic and 
cultural links with the West; the belief that 
the CSR is being economically exploited by 
the USSR even though the living standard is 
somewhat higher than in other satellite states; 
loss of civil liberties and excessive interference 
with the citizens' lives; the persecution of 
church leaders as well as the harassment of 
believers; the detention of large numbers of 
political prisoners in jails and forced labor 
camps; and the all-pervading atmosphere of 
coercion, lawlessness and hypocrisy which 
characterize the regime's activities. 
3. The one significant non-Czech minority, the 
Slovaks, resent what seems to them an undue 
monopoly of power and privileges by the 
Czechs, especially the concentration of au-
thority in Prague and the dispatch of Czech 
officials and technicians to Slovakia. Al-
though this is a grievance of long standing, 
antedating the Communist era, the apparent 
failure of the regime to remedy this situation 
after the liquidation of the "bourgeois" gov-
ernment aggravated the already existing ill 
will on the part of the Slovaks. The Slovaks 
blame the Czechs for having allowed the Com-
munists to seize power, and the Slovak Com-
munists have always been weaker numerically 
and in actual influence in Slovakia than the 
Czech Communists. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
4. Intellectuals and students. Writers, who 
have been restive under rigid Party controls 
on literary expression, are among the most 
dissatisfied of the social groups. They par-
ticularly resent the lack of liberalization after 
Stalin's death. Regime controls were openly 
challenged at the Writers' Congress in April 
1956, and some writers, especially in Slovakia, 
have not capitulated to the Party's demand 
for conformity and obedience. University 
students drew up an extensive list of political 
demands in May 1956 which were ignored by 
the regime. While there has been no student 
trouble since that event, this group almost cer-
tainly harbors anti-regime views. Like many 
young people in Czechoslovakia, they resent 
the excessive regimentation of life under Com-
munism, and may on occasion be disinclined 
to caution and passive acceptance of the Com-
munist regime. 
5. Youth. The average young person in 
Czechoslovakia has assumed a protective col-
oration which enables him to live relatively 
comfortably under the present regime and to

38 SECRET 
escape more than minimum interference in 
his daily life by the Communist authorities. 
There is, however, a sizeable element of young 
people who resist all efforts at regimentation 
and besides adopting exaggerated imitations 
of Western dress and other external signs of 
disaffection will on occasion engage in riots 
and scuffles with the police. The regime has 
recently cracked down on this group in what 
was probably a nervous reaction magnified 
by last year's Hungarian events. This rest-
lessness and lack of discipline of youth result-
ing from the Stalinist system prevailing in 
Czechoslovakia has been a problem for years. 
These elements are made up of less educated 
young people and are essentially negative in 
their motivation. Although they would prob-
ably be quick to join in any disturbances such 
as clashes between student demonstrators and 
police as in Hungary in October 1956 or be-
tween strikers and police as at Poznan, they 
are not a primary danger to the regime. 
6. Professional people, managers. Middle-
ranking civil servants, professional men, eco-
nomic managers and engineers, are dissatis-
fied not only with the working of the regime 
as it affects them in their careers but also 
with the general nature of the regime, par-
ticularly its subordination of national inter-
ests to those of the USSR, its bias in favor of 
political reliability rather than efficiency, its 
general crudity, dishonesty, and lawlessness. 
Though this dislike of the very nature of the 
regime is found in all segments of the popula-
tion, the professional group seems to be most 
sensitive to it. Yet there is perhaps more 
willingness in this group than in most others 
(except industrial workers) to accept a Com-
munist regime provided it were cleaned up at 
various levels, committed to a humane and 
national-minded socialist program, and acted 
more independently of the USSR. Since this 
is not the case, disillusionment increasingly 
engenders dissidence. 
7. Peasantry. The farming population ob-
jects to compulsory delivery quotas. But its 
resistance is characterized by apathy in plant-
ing and a slowdown in the required deliveries. 
The accelerated tempo of collectivization over 
recent years is chiefly the result of increased 
regime pressuie which has overcome peasant 
resistance. This weakening resistance has 
been exacerbated by the rapid aging of the 
rural population. Very few young people are 
staying on the farms, drifting into industrial 
jobs instead. 
8. Industrial workers complain about long 
work hours, low real wages, poor housing 
facilities, and shortage in and high prices of 
consumer goods. They dislike the stringent 
labor discipline. There have been reports of 
scattered strikes in heavy industry and min-
ing but none apparently serious. Despite 
their complaints, industrial workers have not 
been openly rebellious and, under present cir-
cumstances, are not likely to engage in active 
resistance. 
9. Armed Forces. The permanent cadre of 
commissioned and noncommissioned officers 
gives continuing support to the regime, some 
from conviction and others from opportun-
istic motives. The approximately 90,000 con-
scripts inducted annually represent a cross 
section of Czechoslovak youth and probably 
reflect the general popular dissatisfaction with 
Communist rule. However, obviously unreli-
able individuals are not inducted into the 
Armed Forces, and conditions of military life 
and stringent political controls prevent the 
expression and dissemination of dissaffection 
among the troops. Personal dissatisfaction 
with military service may be expressed not 
only in terms of the soldier's usual grievances, 
but also by a dislike of Soviet type of training 
and political indoctrination. However, al-
though this discontent seldom overrides the 
normal military obedience to authority and 
there are no known instances of group defi-
ance of military orders, the reliability of the 
Armed Forces in case of emergency is open 
to question. The militarized security, forces 
(Frontier and Interior Guard), because of 
their very close screening of recruits, prob-
ably constitute the most reliable elements of 
the Armed Forces. On balance, it is highly 
unlikely that military personnel would offer 
active resistance to the regime under present 
conditions. 
10. Religion. Religious believers resent the 
regime's policy of interning church leaders 
and doing everything possible to hamper the

SECRET 
normal functioning of the churches, to impede 
religious education, and to harass the faithful. 
In itself, this resentment does not pose a 
serious threat to the regime, but in combina-
tion with other factors helps to keep dissidence 
at a high level, especially in Slovakia. 
11. Slovaks, being predominantly Catholic, 
historically at odds with the more advanced 
Czechs, individualistic and nationalistic, have 
always represented a special problem to the 
Communist regime. Not only is there in Slo-
vakia a stronger anti-Soviet sentiment but 
also there has remained the traditional anti-
Czech feeling. As a result, Communism has 
had considerably less success establishing firm 
roots in Slovakia than in the Czech lands, and 
it continues to have difficulties in organizing 
loyal Communists on the grass roots level as 
well as in obtaining faithful adherence by 
Party members to central directives. Many 
of the unconfirmed but plausible reports of 
unorganized and modestly organized resist-
ance relate to Slovakia. Thus, a considerable 
potential for resistance exists in Slovakia, but 
its apparent lack of organization and focus 
against the centers of Communist power re-
stricts its actual effectiveness. 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
12. Although dissidence is more pronounced 
in Slovakia than in Bohemia-Moravia, there 
is little evidence of active resistance in either 
area. Communist security controls have not 
changed significantly since the death of 
Stalin; they are still so pervasive that people 
are afraid to voice criticism of regime, let 
alone engage in open resistance. Moreover, 
the events in Hungary have only deepened the 
conviction that Soviet troops, while not at 
present "stationed in Czechoslovakia, would 
come to the assistance of the regime to put 
down any revolt that could not be handled 
locally and that there is no hope of Western 
help. As a result, the population at no time 
was in the reckless revolutionary mood which 
characterized Poland and Hungary in 1956. 
Isolated expressions of dissidence found no 
active popular response. The regime has not 
wavered since in its firm attitude, and the 
population has refrained from overt expres-
39 
sion of hostility other than grumbling about 
restrictive policies, extensive government con-
trol, and living conditions in general. 
13. It is true that dissatisfaction with the 
regime is found in all segments of the Czecho-
slovak population, even among Party mem-
bers. But dissidence is not translated into 
widespread strikes, riots and public disturb-
ances, except for occasional trouble with 
young "hooligan" elements. It is confined 
largely to verbal criticism of the regime and 
fairly mild demand for change on the part of 
certain educated and articulate segments of 
the population, notably writers, university 
students, and some Party groups in govern-
ment ministries. These dissident groups ap-
pear for the moment to be biding their time, 
waiting for more opportune external and in-
ternal conditions. 
14. In general, the Czechoslovak population 
as a whole is not in a mood to defy the regime 
and press for revolutionary changes. There 
is a deep-seated fear of the risks involved in a 
change on the part of those who have lived 
through the upheavals caused by the German 
occupation and the imposition of the Commu-
nist regime in its place, and who have experi-
enced the absence of Western intervention in 
Eastern Europe. These people fear not only 
the painful loss of life and property in a Hun-
garian-style uprising but also the possible loss 
of jobs and various social benefits, and an-
other prolonged period of uncertainty and 
political upheaval. 
TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
15. Despite the surface appearance of calm 
and stability, dissatisfaction of the Czecho-
slovak people has been accumulating and in-
creasing since the death of Stalin, mainly be-
cause the regime did not move toward greater 
liberalization. There were a few concessions, 
such as a slight relaxation of police pressure 
and an improvement of the standard of living. 
But by mid-1956, it had become clear that the 
Communist leaders did not intend to grant 
any basic concessions, either internally by 
permitting greater freedom, or externally by 
moving towards a more independent position 
vis-a-vis the USSR. The population is dissatis-

40 SECRET 
fled with this unyielding attitude on the part 
of the regime, but appears unwilling to do any-
thing about it. Some open expressions of dis-
sidence in May 1956 were quickly countered, 
and, at the Party Conference in June 1956, 
it was firmly stated that no further conces-
sions would be made in response to demands 
for political liberalization. 
16. The regime has been able to cope suc-
cessfully with dissidence largely because un-
rest has been confined to small groups and has 
been kept from spreading to broad segments 
of the population. There has been a closing 
of ranks under pressure of events among the 
leadership and hence no opening which could 
be exploited by dissident elements. Nor is 
there any weakening of the authority and 
effectiveness of Party and police controls of 
the kind which permitted similar beginnings 
of dissidence in Poland and Hungary to grow 
bolder, stronger and more widespread. So 
far as the Communist Party itself is concerned, 
the sustained campaign against "revisionism" 
and the efforts made to deny the applicability 
of Mao's theories on socialism to Czechoslo-
vakia show that the leaders continue to have 
good reason to doubt the loyalty and ortho-
doxy of the mass of Party members. Thus 
the regime strives to maintain strict ideologi-
cal orthodoxy as the official policy. This pol-
icy evidently receives full support from the 
hard core members of the Party apparatus, 
and hence the regime has been able to sup-
press the kind of deviationist thinking which 
cropped up immediately after the Twentieth 
Congress. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
17. There are no known organized resistance 
groups in Czechoslovakia, nor have there been 
any for many years. There is, however, a 
certain amount of passive, unorganized resist-
ance, mostly in the form of attempts to evade 
labor discipline, non-attendance at political 
meetings, failure to pay dues to Communist 
organizations, and similar derelictions. The 
motives are not always political. There are 
occasional cases of active resistance by in-
dividuals, largely in the form of violent assault 
on and even murder of Communist function-
aries by one or more aggrieved individuals, and 
sometimes in the form of support by individ-
uals for Western intelligence. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
18. Since the death of Stalin, material sup-
port by emigres to internal Czechoslovakia 
resistance has been non-existent, as has that 
from any other external source. No regular 
channels exist at present for getting such sup-
port into Czechoslovakia. Emigre guidance 
for internal resistance has been equally lack-
ing, except to the extent that one or another 
political grouping of the Czechoslovak emigra-
tion has succeeded in gaining acceptance for 
its views by some Western propaganda agency, 
which has then incorporated such a "line" 
into its efforts to reach the Czechoslovak pop-
ulation. A considerable body of evidence in-
dicates that Western broadcasts are widely 
heard in Czechoslovakia and that propaganda 
in pamphlet form does receive some attention. 
There are also indications that Western broad-
casts have both adherents and critics among 
the population. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
19. The regime has maintained intact its com-
prehensive security controls. The threat of 
these organs to the people is being kept alive 
by repeated announcements of the arrest of 
"enemy agents," reminding would-be conspir-
ators that their activities are doomed to fail-
ure. Apart from the regular armed forces, 
the regime's security apparatus consists of 
highly centralized units, all under the com-
mand of the Ministry of the Interior. Its total 
strength is estimated at from 110,000 to 140,-
000. This strength figure does not include 
some 160,000 to 200,000 personnel who serve 
part time in various civilian militia groups. 
In addition, many thousands of people assist 
as paid and unpaid agents and informers and 
as such make a considerable contribution to 
the mission of maintaining the security of the 
regime. Under the Ministry of Interior are 
the following major components: (1) The 
Frontier Guard (PS) and Interior Guard 
(VS) , with a total strength of 45,000 men or-
ganized into military units; (2) the secret 
police (StB) , with an estimated strength of 
SECRET

SECRET 41 
only 5,000 but controlling a widespread net 
of agents and informers; and, (3) the Public 
Security Corps (VB), with a strength of 60,-
000 to 90,000 which includes as its largest com-
ponent the regular police. This apparatus is 
supplemented and supported by an elaborate 
system of population registration and docu-
mentary control. 
20. The Czechoslovak regime conducts con-
tinuous propaganda by press, radio and per-
sonal agitation for the purposes of indoctrina-
tion, vilification of Western objectives, label-
ing faith in Western "promises" as futile self-
delusion, etc. The regime eagerly exploits all 
evidence of refugee activity which may be con-
strued as advocating that the only alternative 
to the post-war economic and social system is 
a return to conditions of 1938, conditions that 
may no longer be satisfactory to what is prob-
ably a majority of the population. Moreover, 
the regime plays up the continuing Czech dis-
like and fear of the Germans, claiming that 
the end of Communism in Czechoslovakia will 
mean the return of German domination. 
While exploitation of these themes falls far 
short of the regime's objectives of winning 
over the population to enthusiastic support, 
nevertheless they help to keep alive Czech 
disillusionment with the West and the pain-
ful period of German occupation and to this 
extent may contribute to the many other 
factors inhibiting resistance. Moreover, the 
people in Czechoslovakia are undoubtedly 
aware that their standard of living, while low, 
is higher than that of neighboring satellites. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
21. The Czechoslovak security forces are fully 
capable of preventing an expansion or in-
crease of resistance activity by any local anti-
regime elements, organized or unorganized. 
But even if security controls were relaxed, and 
the people were less cautious in voicing their 
opinions of the regime, they probably would 
not increase their resistance activities, at least 
not in the Czech lands. Traditionally, the 
Czechs are a cautious people, and it is believed 
that they would be more inclined to wait for 
liberation by external powers than to fight 
for it themselves. However, the Slovaks are 
of a different temperament, and it is possible 
that some of them would renew their partisan 
activities against the regime in the event of 
a security relaxation. 
22. However, in the unlikely event of a wide-
spread popular revolt, the regime would al-
most certainly be incapable of successful 
counter-action without Soviet help. In such 
a situation, the regular armed forces probably 
would not be considered reliable, and the re-
gime would ask for help from the Soviet Army, 
substantial units of which are available in 
adjacent areas of the Soviet Union and in 
East Germany, Poland, and Hungary. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
23. So long as Soviet power remains un-
changed, the regime's security controls un-
altered, and the present standard of living 
unimpaired, organized resistance has virtually 
no potential. Unless a significant deteriora-
tion of internal controls occurred and possible 
Soviet intervention were precluded by a major 
internal crisis within the USSR or heavy So-
viet involvement elsewhere, the prospects for 
organized resistance remain poor. The re-
gime's effectiveness in eliminating all signifi-
cant organized underground and partisan re-
sistance groups, the prevailing view that lib-
eration cannot be achieved without direct 
Western assistance, and the regime's pervasive 
controls serve to inhibit the evolution of a 
popular resistance movement. 
24. Passive resistance along lines already in-
dicated could assume greater proportions and 
extend to frequent acts of economic sabotage 
if the regime were forced to revise drastically 
downward its present level of efforts to in-
crease housing, consumer goods, and food 
stocks. Further political or military crises 
in other Bloc countries might then act as a 
catalyst for spontaneous disturbances in 
Czechoslovakia. Unorganized passive resist-
ance will probably continue but within rather 
narrow limits. Isolated instances of unrest, 
such as occurred in June 1953 and in May 1956, 
are possible but of no long-range significance. 
Neither are the limited capabilities of intel-

lectuals and students to pressure the regime 
for liberalization because the Communist 
leadership is quite able to suppress such ac-
tivities or keep them within easily manage-
able proportions. There is a bare possibility 
that the intellectual ferment might affect the 
Communist Party bureaucracy, but the ap-
parent lack of a leader of the Gomulka type 
will almost certainly leave Czechoslovak for-
tunes in the hands of the unrelenting "Stalin-
ists." Thus present evidence does not pro-
vide a basis for expectation that unorganized 
resistance will become anything more than an 
irritant to the regime. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
25. In the event of war between Bloc and non-
Bloc states, the Czechoslovak regime would 
immediately intensify its security measures. 
This would initially restrict the populace from 
participating in resistance activities. It would 
also give them time to observe the progress 
of the struggle so that they could place them-
selves in a more favorable position with the 
prospective victor. It is not likely that resist-
ance would develop if it were apparent that 
Soviet forces were generally gaining and would 
continue to control Czechoslovakia and the 
areas adjacent to it, and that there was no 
immediate prospect of the arrival of Western 
troops. It is likely that in case of war the 
Czechoslovak security police would immediate-
ly take drastic precautionary measures, prob-
ably interning or even deporting to the USSR 
thousands of known or suspected anti-Com-
munists. In these circumstances only a small 
number of courageous people could be found 
who would be willing to risk serious resistance 
activity, such as sheltering Western airmen 
or escaped prisoners, mainly in rural areas 
and Slovakia. 
26. On the other hand, were it apparent that 
Soviet forces were generally losing and that a 
retreat of Soviet power from Czechoslovakia 
and adjacent areas was imminent, there would 
be an increase in resistance activity accom-
panied by a breakdown of Communist police 
controls as Communists fled or simply failed 
to carry out orders. Resistance elements 
would engage in industrial and agricultural 
sabotage activities; with outside help, they 
would undertake intelligence collection, es-
cape and evasion operations and other ac-
tivities that would be detrimental to the Bloc. 
At the same time, skeleton underground clan-
destine organizations and guerrilla bands 
might begin to operate. Good possibilities for 
guerrilla type operations appear to exist in 
the mountainous areas of Slovakia. In ad-
dition, there is a limited basis for cooperation 
between Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian anti-
Communist groups by virtue of their common 
access to the Carpathian mountain ranges, 
past cooperation among them, and bonds of 
ethnic kinship. Since Soviet troops would be 
deployed in Czechoslovakia in the event of 
war, an effective partisan movement probably 
could not develop unless substantial Western 
assistance was made available, and their ac-
tivities coordinated with Western military op-
erations. 
27. In case of a major breakdown of Soviet 
military power in the area, it is possible that 
elements of the Czechoslovak Armed Forces 
might switch sides, even undertaking guer-
rilla action against the retreating Soviet 
forces. More likely, however, would be a gen-
eral breakdown of military organization as 
Communists and non-Communists fought 
each other, deserted or simply stood by idly 
till Western forces arrived. 
28. The nationality of attacking forces would 
probably make little difference, provided it 
was made clear that Czechoslovakia would re-
tain its present frontiers and be restored to 
full independence. The presence of a sub-
stantial number of Germans among the at-
tacking forces is likely to have noticeable neg-
ative psychological effects at least in the Czech 
lands. Most of the people of Czechoslovakia 
probably would not be concerned with the 
responsibility for initiating hostilities because 
they look upon war as the only means of na-
tional liberation. 
29. The extensive use of large nuclear weap-
ons on Czechoslovak territory would greatly 
antagonize the people, and the survivors would 
concentrate their efforts on self-preservation 
rather than assisting either side in the strug-
gle. Such adverse reactions might be reduced

but by no means eliminated if tactical nu-
clear attacks were limited primarily to mili-
tary and government control targets, isolated 
from larger populated areas. In the latter 
case the will to resist might be increased since 
such attacks could diffuse and lessen the con-
trol strengths of the Czechoslovakian regime. 
30. Occupation policies formulated by the ad-
vancing Western powers, designed to guaran-
tee the territorial integrity and national inde-
43 
pendence of Czechoslovakia, would almost 
certainly enlist Czechoslovak cooperation and 
stimulate resistance in areas still under Com-
munist control. 
31. No individual resistance factions for post-
war leadership are known to exist in Czecho-
slovakia. Certain emigre groups may desire 
to establish leadership, but their unpopularity 
among their countrymen would make such a 
goal unattainable.

ANNEX E - EAST GERMANY 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. Popular opposition to the East German 
regime continues to be widespread. It is sus-
tained by resentment of the regime's police 
state methods which, though changed in the 
employment of outright cruelty since the 
death of Stalin, have remained essentially the 
same in repressing political freedom. It is 
further aggravated by economic regimenta-
tion and the failure to raise the standard of 
living to a level comparable to that of West 
Germany. Most of all, dissidence is directed 
against a regime which is regarded as the tool 
of an alien power, representing the interests 
of the USSR and dependent on Soviet support 
for its continued existence. This was clearly 
demonstrated when only the intervention of 
Soviet occupation forces prevented the East 
German regime from disintegrating during 
the June 1953 uprisings. 
2. The character of popular disaffection in 
the "German Democratic Republic" (GDR) is 
shaped, to a considerable extent, by the cir-
cumstance that contacts between the people 
of the GDR and those in the West are much 
more free and frequent than are contacts be-
tween the populations of other satellites and 
the West. Moreover, the East Germans are 
tied to West Germany by common bonds of 
national identity and by the hope that even-
tual unification will mean liberation from 
Soviet-Communist rule. As a result, nearly 
all East Germans do not identify themselves 
with the GDR as a separate country and do 
not look upon the GDR as permanent. 
3. Soviet occupation of East Germany cannot 
be disguised. It underlines the puppet re-
gime's complete dependence on the USSR and 
thus prevents it from permitting any modifi-
cation of the system not approved by the 
Kremlin. Furthermore, traditional disdain of 
the Slays, combined with experience of Soviet 
brutality, tends to equate Communist meth-
ods ? rather than Marxist philosophy ? with 
Soviet overlordship. Meanwhile, the existence 
of a much larger prosperous West German 
state confronts the GDR regime with the obvi-
ous rebuttal to any claim of representing the 
interests of the German people as a whole. 
As a result, the leaders of the Communist SED 
(Socialist Unity Party) and the government 
are generally hated and detested. 
4. Economic privations, even though lessened 
by concessions made after Stalin's death, con-
tinue to affect nearly every East German, with 
the exception of the Party elite, high govern-
ment officials and leading intellectuals. These 
deprivations ? in the face of West German 
abundance ? are made particularly unpalat-
able by the regime's compulsory ideological 
indoctrination and by its attempts to orient 
German culture eastward. The East Ger-
mans consider themselves as belonging to the 
West and in fact believe their culture to be 
superior to that of the East. The regime's 
anti-Church activities have also contributed 
to popular dissatisfaction. 
5. In the wake of Soviet political gyrations, 
East German dissidence has fluctuated be-
tween resignation and the desire for revolu-
tionary action. The events of 1956 1 caused 
considerable unrest, compelling the regime to 
take extensive precautionary measures. 
These measures, coupled with subsequent So-
viet efforts to stabilize the position of the 
USSR and International Communism and the 
successes, real or apparent, of this campaign 
have probably cautioned East German resist-
ance elements. Nevertheless, the potential 
remains very great, not only among the dis-
The 20th CPSU Congress, CPSU statements in 
June and October, the emergence of Gomulka 
in Poland, the Hungarian revolution, and the 
29 December statement of the Chinese Commu-
nist Party.

affected groups listed below but also among 
many rank and file members of the Party and 
its mass organizations, the government bu-
reaucracy, white collar workers and the intel-
ligentsia. It has been estimated that not 
more than 10 percent of the population ac-
tually support the regime, and it is almost cer-
tain that such support is confined to people 
who have a personal stake in its continuation. 
Since late 1949, when the refugee registration 
program was initiated in West Germany and 
West Berlin, at least two million persons have 
fled to the West, about half of them under 25 
years of age. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
6. Industrial Workers. Disaffection and re-
sistance in the GDR are endemic in the indus-
trial centers. More than one-third of the 
wage and salary earners in the GDR are in-
dustrial workers. About 70 percent of them 
are employed in the nationalized industries. 
Soviet hopes that these workers would become 
the ideological and social foundation of Com-
munist authority in the GDR have not mate-
rialized. After 1945, the sharp trend of Ger-
man labor toward Communism during the 
Weimar Republic moved back toward the tra-
ditional social-democratic channels which are 
tied to strong but free trade unions. German 
social-democracy has been evolutionary (re-
visionist) rather than revolutionary and, 
therefore, has been traditionally the target of 
intense Bolshevik hostility. Since the tradi-
tion of free trade unionism is still very strong, 
the fact that under the GDR the unions have 
become 'instruments of government control 
has greatly contributed to the workers' dis-
affection. Furthermore, the workers are dis-
gruntled over low wages, high work norms, 
substandard living conditions, insufficient 
food supplies, lack of consumer goods, ever-
present ideological propaganda, forced at-
tendance at political rallies, and imposition of 
alien Soviet labor methods. 
7. Youth, from which the regime had ex-
pected to obtain strong support, has proved 
to be as disappointing as labor. More than 
one-third of the East German population, 
about seven million persons, are under 25 
years of age, a generation disillusioned by 
Nazism and therefore thought to be ready for 
the acceptance of Communism. But there is 
evidence that the majority of youth is indif-
ferent or hostile to the regime. The influence 
of parents, Church affiliations, older workers 
and non-Communist teachers, and the near-
ness of the West still militate against the 
success of the Communist youth program. 
Nevertheless, although the majority of East 
German youth almost certainly are not loyal 
to the Communist regime, they, like their 
elders, have been unable to organize their 
opposition to the regime. Youth has shown 
opposition primarily in individual actions, 
especially flight and nonconformity. Most 
outspoken in their opposition probably were 
students who demanded ? in vain ? the abo-
lition of compulsory instruction in the Rus-
sian language and in Communist ideology, the 
right to organize freely, and easier access to 
the West. Whether there will eventually 
emerge a small leader group of more mature 
young people constituting a more effective re-
sistance potential, or whether resistance will 
remain limited to passive expressions of dis-
content, will depend on the stability of Com-
munist leadership. 
8. Armed Forces. There is considerably less 
evidence of dissidence in the East German 
Army than in the population as a whose. Dig-
content is strongest among those who "vol-
unteered" for service under any of the various 
forms of duress commonly employed by the 
regime. There is undoubtedly less disaffec-
tion in the permanent cadre of commissioned 
and non-commissioned officers ? constituting 
some 20 percent of the 100,000-man 
force ? than among the two-year "volun-
teers." Most of the latter, however, are 
former members of Communist youth organi-
zations who have been specially selected by 
Party boards throughout the country because 
of their presumed reliability ? or at least the 
absence of any evidence of disloyalty on their 
part. Military organization and discipline 
and constant surveillance make any spread of 
dissidence within the force difficult. More-
over, since the physical conditions of service 
life have improved, they no longer serve as 
primary sources of resentment toward the

SECRET 47 
present Communist government. In general, 
these same considerations apply to the mili-
tarized security forces (Border Police and In-
terior Troops). There is believed to be less 
dissidence in these forces than in the Army, 
however, because of more careful screening 
before induction. 
9. No actual organized resistance has been 
noted within the Army or militarized security 
forces. Morale and discipline within the 
Army are only fair, however, and instances of 
inattention to duty and individual acts of in-
subordination are frequent. Forceful opposi-
tion to military and governmental authority 
probably would not occur on a significant 
scale except in extraordinary circumstances, 
such as widespread domestic revolt or a war 
in which Western forces (particularly if these 
included West German contingents) were 
about to invade East Germany. In less dra-
matic situations, such as local disorders, the 
East German Army probably would give no 
more than nominal support to the present 
regime. 
10. Businessmen. From the outset of the So-
viet occupation of East Germany, it has been 
Communist policy to eliminate the middle 
class as an independent political factor. This 
policy has been applied most ruthlessly to the 
economically stronger elements of the popu-
lation; it has been considerably modified, how-
ever, when applied to those groups which the 
regime needed for political or technological 
reasons. Although there is still some private 
enterprise left,2 businessmen almost certainly 
realize that they have only a temporary re-
prieve and will be eliminated in due time. 
While the outlook of these elements is neces-
sarily anti-regime, they are almost certainly 
bound to remain cautious, inclined to passive 
resistance only if they see no risk. 
11. Professionals and Intellectuals. With the 
exception of some artists and scientists who 
Private industry produced 11.6 percent of the 
East German total by the end of 1956. The 
turnover of private retail trade in the GDR 
amounted to a slightly less than 29 percent of 
total retail trade turnover in 1956. In the whole-
sale business, the share of private enterprise had 
sunk to less than 4 percent by the end of 1956. 
have been offered and have accepted a highly 
favored social and economic position and who 
thus have a stake in the continuance of the 
regime, the vast majority of the intellectuals 
have remained anti-regime. Many of them 
have withdrawn from professional life and 
others have become noticeably less productive. 
Quite a few have escaped to the West, but 
others have remained in East Germany in an 
effort to maintain German cultural traditions 
without surrendering to the ideological de-
mands of Communism. In view of the respect 
and influence which intellectuals and artists 
generally enjoy in Europe and particularly in 
Germany, their resistance potential is consid-
erable though largely intangible. This does 
not mean that all those who oppose the re-
gime are also anti-Communist; the case of 
Wolfgang Harich is representative of persons 
who hate the regime and detest Soviet over-
lordship although they would go along with a 
national Communist type of government. 
Nevertheless, in spite of the advantages 
offered to those intellectuals who are willing 
to collaborate with the regime, most of them 
will remain opposed to Communist methods 
and many will, as the occasion arises, express 
this opposition directly or indirectly through 
their media, or, alternatively, either by with-
drawal ("inner emigration") or by flight. 
12. Churches. Of the 17.6 million inhabitants 
of the Soviet Zone and the Soviet Sector of 
Berlin, about 15 million are Lutheran/Evan-
gelical and two million Catholics. Both 
church groups have resisted Communist athe-
ism and immorality, each according to its own 
institutions and its own traditional attitudes 
to the state and to governments. Generally 
speaking, however, the ideological and insti-
tutional struggle of the SED regime against 
the churches has not been as intense as that 
of the regimes in Czechoslovakia, Hungary 
and Poland. The SED regime has not wished 
to attack excessively the Lutheran/Evangeli-
cal churches in the Soviet Zone because of the 
impact such a policy of total persecution 
would have on their own coreligionists (24.5 
millions) in the Federal Republic. Secondly, 
the Lutheran/Evangelical churches are ad-
ministratively decentralized within the Soviet 
Zone and therefore do not present a cohesive

institutional challenge to the policies of the 
SED regime. This coincidence of SED policy 
goals and traditional Lutheran/Evangelical 
attitudes of cooperation with existing authori-
ty has resulted in a difficult but tolerable truce 
between the two in which each tries to erode 
rather than explode the powers of the other. 
For its part, the Catholic Church is too small 
to have much influence in the Soviet Zone. 
13. Party and Government Functionaries. Al-
though the regime has strenuously attempted 
to maintain ideological conformity among its 
supporters, there is evidence of a cleavage be-
tween the working level in government and 
Party and the central authorities. Particu-
larly those persons who were more recently 
drawn into the Communist apparatus have 
had difficulties in adjusting themselves to the 
conflicting pressures imposed on the one hand 
by the rigorous demands of the central au-
thorities and on the other hand by the pop-
ular rejection of the regime. This conflict has 
affected not only persons sensitive to popular 
feeling but also those influenced by idealistic 
elements in Marxist doctrine, who have be-
come disillusioned or frustrated by the im-
possibility of achieving anything consistent 
with their concepts of the general welfare. 
Some dissatisfaction has appeared among the 
lower ranks of functionaries and others on 
whom the regime relies. This has been re-
flected in numerous defections of party offi-
cials, police, local government officers, and 
active as well as former members of the secu-
rity and military forces who have fled to West 
Germany. However, the treatment accorded 
in Hungary to security officers and other Com-
munist functionaries during the 1956 revolt 
by the populace has tended to make Commu-
nist functionaries in East Germany close 
ranks behind the regime. 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
14. Despite the great extent of disaffection in 
the GDR, dissidence, with the single excep-
tion of the 17 June 1953 uprisings, has ex-
pressed itself only in defection, transmission 
of intelligence, passive resistance (without 
significant risk) , and anti-regime propaganda 
activities. In the second half of 1956, initially 
under the growing impact of "de-Staliniza-
tion" and later as a response to developments 
in Poland and Hungary, considerable discon-
tent manifested itself, especially among intel-
lectuals, students, and workers in the 
larger industrial enterprises. This dis-
content reached its peak during the early suc-
cesses of the Hungarian revolution. With the 
suppression of the Hungarian revolt, however, 
the intensity of discontent and of resistance 
became progressively dissipated until, by mid-
1957, when communal elections were held 
throughout the GDR without major incidents, 
the regime had demonstrated again its hold 
over the population. 
15. However, the ease of access to the GDR 
from West Berlin and West Germany has 
facilitated the organization of some resistance 
groups operating from these areas. These 
groups encourage cautious covert resistance; 
their main objects are anti-regime propa-
ganda, keeping files of persons in Communist 
prisons and assisting families of the prisoners, 
keeping track of crimes committed by the 
Communists, keeping alive the spirit of resist-
ance, and gathering as much information as 
possible. They discourage, however, overt ac-
tive resistance which stands little chance of 
escaping harsh retaliation. 
TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE STALIN'S 
DEATH 
16. The only conspicuous resistance in East 
Germany since the death of Stalin was the 
June 1953 uprising. Although there does not 
appear to have been any central guidance to 
the uprisings, they followed the same pattern 
everywhere, thus showing the uniformity of 
anti-regime feeling and producing a solidarity 
of action among East Germans not observed 
previously or since. Caught unprepared by 
the extent of the disorder, the East German 
government could not contain the uprisings 
and was forced to call on Russian forces to 
quell them. The readiness of the Soviets to 
respond to the regime's call for help provided 
an object lesson which the East Germans took 
to heart. While there is no reason to believe 
that anti-regime feelings in East Germany has 
abated in the slightest since June 1953, the 
prevailing temper since that time has been 
one of restraint. The population is apparent-

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/11 : CIA-RDP79R01012A010700020001-2 
SECRET 49 
ly resigned to the fact that the Communist 
regime is there for some time to come and that 
any active resistance to it is foolhardy as long 
as Russian troops remain in occupation. Con-
sequently, except for individual acts of resist-
ance, occasional small-scale strikes, and a few 
student demonstrations, resistance since 1953 
has been limited to the passive variety, with 
flight to the West ? still regarded by many 
as a measure of last resort ? serving as an 
essential safety valve. 
17. Some dissidence has arisen in university 
and Party intellectual circles since the 20th 
CPSU Congress and the ensuing de-Staliniza-
tion program. The temporary ideological dis-
orientation and the anti-Party trends which 
resulted from the Stalin denigration caused 
confusion in Party thinking, an outbreak 
of "deviationism," and widespread ferment 
among intellectuals. SED spokesmen indi-
cated that they were determined not to per-
mit events in East Germany to proceed as 
they did in Poland or Hungary. Large-scale 
precautionary measures were taken to pre-
vent any outbreaks. These measures were 
almost certainly helped by efforts in West 
Germany to stave off any hopeless revolt. 
18. It is improbable that the intellectual op-
position to Ulbricht and present SED policies 
holds any real danger for the regime as long 
as Ulbricht retains the support of the Soviet 
Union. It is to be noted, however, that de-
spite the regime's measures, the intellectuals, 
though they may have been intimidated and 
silenced, have not been reconciled, as is evi-
denced by the flight to West Germany on 22 
August 1957 of Professor Alfred Kantorowicz, 
a dedicated Communist since 1931 and one of 
the GDR's leading intellectual figures. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
19. NO organized resistance groups of any 
significance are known to exist today in East 
Germany. Anti-Communist groups based in 
West Germany are active in the GDR and 
command the cooperation both of individ-
uals and of small numbers of politically con-
scious East Germans who meet regularly to 
exchange news. But organized resistance 
groups of the type which that term usually 
denotes ? partisan or guerrilla bands ? are 
believed entirely lacking. 
20. There are indications from almost all 
areas of East Germany of unorganized resist-
ance, largely passive in nature. While all 
segments of the population appear to manifest 
passive resistance in one form or another, the 
stimulus to resist appears to come primarily 
from student, intellectual and upper working 
class strata. Dissidence also has been noted 
within the Party and Party-affiliated groups, 
though on a lesser scale. At times of inter-
national unrest (e.g., the Hungarian revolt) 
and major policy changes (e.g., the advent 
of de-Stalinization), there is a definite and 
perceptible increase in widespread passive 
resistance, as well as an appearance of local-
ized, sporadic overt opposition. 
21. The present SED regime is universally 
detested by the East German population, of 
which it is estimated that less than 10 percent 
would vote Communist in a free election. The 
people generally resent the government's 
police state methods and high-pressure in-
doctrination, its economic regimentation and 
failure to sufficiently raise the standard of 
living, its alien character and subservience to 
the Soviet Union, and its position as a major 
obstacle to German reunification. One of the 
most obvious indications of the general dislike 
of the regime which exists among all cate-
gories of East Germans is the persistent flight 
of East Germans to West Germany and West 
Berlin. From 1949 until the end of 1957, it 
is estimated that 2,275,000 persons ? equal 
to almost 13 percent of the present popula-
tion of the GDR ? have expressed their op-
position by flight. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
22. Germany being a divided country, Ger-
man emigre groups do not exist in the sense 
that they do in relation to other orbit coun-
tries. However, passive resistance in East 
Germany is stimulated, and to an extent 
guided, by anti-Communist groups based in 
West Germany or West Berlin, such as the 
Eastern Bureaus (Ostburo) of West German 
political parties, especially the Social Demo-
cratic Party, the Investigating Committee of

SECRET 
Free Jurists (Untersuchungsausschuss Freier 
Juristen), and the Fighting Group Against 
Inhumanity (Kampfgruppe gegen Unmen-
schlichkeit). In West Germany and West 
Berlin, their activities are largely based on 
direct contacts with individuals and involve 
providing information, advice and material 
support. Their activities in East Germany 
consist chiefly of large-scale clandestine dis-
tribution of various kinds of literature, in-
cluding their own publications, and the col-
lection of information on events in the GDR. 
23. These organizations strive more to main-
tain the spirit of resistance than to sponsor 
acts of sabotage or other forms of active resist-
ance. They generally take the line that active 
resistance at this time is futile although pas-
sive resistance is possible. This accords with 
official West German and NATO policy which 
forbids the incitement of the East German 
population to revolt. This policy was fol-
lowed even during the height of earlier Hun-
garian successes in 1956 when these groups, 
the Bonn government and individual West 
Germans with contacts in the GDR warned 
that on no account should active resistance 
against the regime be undertaken since it 
would produce no useful results and could 
only bring renewed disaster to Germany. 
24. There is no evidence of non-German 
groups or individuals offering guidance or ma-
terial aid for resistance activity apart from 
the limited efforts of the ICFTU (working 
through West German trade unions) and 
several Russian emigre groups based in West 
Germany, such as NTS (National Solidarists) 
and TSOPE (Central Association of Political 
Immigrants from the USSR) . 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
25. The East German security apparatus is 
directed by the Ministry for State Security 
(MfS) and the Ministry of Interior. The MfS 
controls the covert organization for combat-
ting and negating resistance and dissidence, 
whether organized or unorganized. It main-
tains an extensive and elaborate system of 
informants and surveillance, and uses pene-
tration and provocation as primary means for 
detecting, combatting, and forestalling anti-
regime activities. The MfS also conducts 
campaigns to discredit the West German anti-
Communist organizations with East Germans 
and to harass them in West Germany. The 
MfS also attempts to penetrate these Western 
organizations and to subvert their members. 
26. The role of the Ministry of Interior has 
varied as a result of the continuous reorgani-
zation of the East German security apparatus. 
Already in control of the civil police, it ac-
quired further security responsibilities in Feb-
ruary 1957, when the militarized security 
forces were subordinated to it. 
27. In addition to standard devices of censor-
ship, travel controls and informer nets, the 
regime uses such measures as the employment 
of a special party militia to help suppress op-
position in factories; discriminatory taxation; 
the transfer of suspect workers and employees; 
and the arbitrary classification of failures to 
meet assigned production quotas, regardless 
of cause, as economic sabotage. The occa-
sional practice of imposing severe penalties for 
the most minor infractions is another effective 
means used by the regime. 
28. The primary deterrents to uprisings in 
East Germany are approximately 400,000 So-
viet armed forces, stationed throughout the 
country. The regime itself controls some 
240,000 trained uniformed men, equally di-
vided between military and police forces, 
whose very existence tends to inhibit resist-
ance activities. In addition, the Kampfgrup-
pen (Auxiliary Shop and Factory Guards) , 
organized following the June 1953 riots to 
prevent such disturbances from recurring, is 
being strengthened and intensively trained. 
It has held ostentatious antiriot exercises in 
various cities, with the obvious intent of in-
timidating the people. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
29. Although capable of suppressing unco-
ordinated local uprisings, the East German re-
gime, without the aid of Soviet forces, would 
be unable to suppress a major revolt. While 
the government probably could depend on a 
dedicated minority in the MfS in case of trou-

SECRET 51 
ble, none of its military and police forces are 
considered completely reliable. Some mem-
bers would probably be reluctant to fight 
against their own countrymen, and in case of 
widespread revolt, might well defect to the 
side of those in opposition to the regime, de-
pending on the exact conditions which pre-
vailed. However, the 22 Soviet line divisions 
stationed in East Germany would be available 
for swift intervention to suppress any large-
scale revolt. But barring an unforeseen 
change in the temper of the East German 
population, which remembers the Soviet ac-
tion in June 1953 and more recently in Hun-
gary, no revolt is likely to occur as long as 
these Soviet forces remain in East Germany. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
30. There are no known organized resistance 
groups in East Germany. However, unor-
ganized resistance is still rampant. It ex-
presses itself primarily through flight to the 
West, the eruptions from time to time of 
minor strikes and slowdowns, student demon-
strations, or other incidents. Dissidence with-
in the Party and intellectual circles may con-
tinue, but the regime's demonstrated inten-
tion of dealing vigorously with such devia-
tions, as well as Ulbricht's firm control of the 
Party apparatus and his explicit Soviet back-
ing, will probably prevent such intellectual 
ferment from becoming any real danger to 
the regime. 
31. Capabilities of anti-Communist groups 
based in West Germany and West Berlin con-
sist mainly of widespread distribution, either 
by balloon or by mail and hand-to-hand 
methods, of anti-Communist, anti-regime lit-
erature. Under given circumstances, appeals 
by these Western-based groups to the East 
German population calling for active resist-
ance might be heeded. This, however, would 
presuppose a major change in Western strat-
egy, for West German and NATO policy now 
forbids incitement of East Germans to vio-
lence, and these groups adhere rigidly to that 
policy. 
32. In the absence of organized resistance 
groups, any increase or change in resistance 
potential must come from the unorganized 
dissident elements in the population. The 
June 1953 uprisings showed what the East 
Germans are capable of when sufficiently 
aroused. But as long as the stability of the 
regime remains unshaken and Soviet troops 
remain in East Germany, any attempted new 
form of, or increase in, the level of resistance 
activity runs the grave risk of counteraction 
and suppression by the regime's security 
apparatus. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
33. In case of warfare between Bloc and non-
Bloc countries on East German territory, 
large numbers of Soviet troops would be re-
quired to retain control of the GDR, thereby 
tying down units which could otherwise be 
used against attacking forces. As a result, 
initially, there would be little change in re-
sistance activities other than a probable in-
crease in acts of sabotage and attacks on local 
Communist functionaries. There would prob-
ably also be attempts at espionage, subversion, 
factory slowdowns, failure to cooperate on 
agricultural projects and, in isolated cases 
where topography permitted, small guerrilla 
warfare against the Soviet Army. Neverthe-
less, it would take time, outside support and 
the emergence of strong leadership capable of 
organizing and directing a centrally co-
ordinated resistance force before opposition 
groups could become effective. The forma-
tion of such groups would be a hazardous task 
while the Soviet Bloc remained in power. If 
and when the Communists appeared to be 
weakening, the East Germans would intensify 
their efforts to sabotage supplies and materiel, 
to disrupt lines of communications, and to 
collect and disseminate intelligence to the 
non-Bloc countries involved in the encounter. 
On the other hand, Western defeats would 
immediately lead to a reduction in East Ger-
man resistance activities. 
34. The nationality of attacking Western 
forces would be immaterial to the East Ger-
mans since these forces would be regarded as 
liberators. For example, the employment of 
French and Italian troops would not adversely 
affect resistance capabilities.

35. If the military action took place in East 
Germany, the attitudes and actions of regimes 
and resistance groups in other Bloc countries 
would be of little significance. If the military 
action took place elsewhere within the Bloc, 
the East Germans could expect little coopera-
tion from resistance groups in other countries, 
chiefly because resistance groups of other 
satellites would probably be preoccupied with 
their own national objectives. Nevertheless, 
in spite of distrust or fear of the Germans, 
the possibility of some resistance cooperation 
between elements in East Germany and other 
Soviet satellite countries cannot be entirely 
discounted if liberation from the Soviet yoke 
is at stake. 
36. East Germans probably would not favor 
nuclear weapon attacks even though their 
hatred for the Soviets and the regime is in-
tense. If use were made of major nuclear 
weapons, the resulting mass destruction and 
dislocation would virtually eliminate any 
effective forms of resistance activity. On the 
other hand, if circumstances permit use of 
tactical nuclear weapons, East Germans prob-
ably would accept their effects on the popula-
tion as an unavoidable cost of liberation. 
Under these conditions resistance capabilities 
outside of areas immediately involved would 
not necessarily be adversely affected, and, in-
The representative of the Assistant Chief of 
Staff, Intelligence, USAF, would add the follow-
ing: "It is conceivable that a nuclear air attack 
could be so designed as to eliminate the major 
resources of the military and control strengths 
supporting the regime without incurring popular 
hatred or destroying resistance potential. Such 
an attack could produce an opportunity for the 
East Germans to take over control of the coun-
try." 
deed, the opportunities for Western-assisted 
resistance groups to seize local control would 
be materially increased.3 4

has prejudiced the people permanently 
against the Soviets. More liberal occupation 
policies by the Soviets during a war would be 
regarded simply as an opportunity for resist-
ance. However, occupation of some parts of 
East Germany by NATO forces would encour-
age anti-Soviet resistance activities in unlib-
erated areas. 
38. There is no information available on indi-
vidual resistance factions in East Germany 
which might aspire to post-liberation leader-
ship. 
4 The representative of the Assistant Chief of 
Staff, Intelligence, US Army, notes the presence 
in East Germany of six Soviet armies, including 
22 line divisions, whose neutralization would re-
quire extensive use of nuclear weapons, and 
therefore thinks this paragraph should read as 
follows: "The East Germans would not favor 
the use of nuclear weapons on targets in East 
Germany. Initially, after a nuclear attack of 
any scale, active and effective assistance to the 
West would not materialize because of the con-
fusion and uncertainty of the populace and the 
absence of pre-organized, strongly disciplined 
local resistance groups. Subsequently, resist-
ance potential would be determined by the in-
tensity of the attack, the emergence of native 
resistance leadership and organizations, the ex-
tent of material support from the West, and 
the unpredictable ultimate reaction of the popu-
lace to the use of nuclear weapons. If demorali-
zation and physical destruction were not wide-
spread, and if resistance organizations could be 
developed and given substantial assistance by 
the West, an opportunity could arise for East 
German groups to engage in anti-Soviet ac-
tivity."

ANNEX F - HUNGARY 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. The Hungarians have always considered 
themselves the last eastern outpost of the 
West and an integral part of Western civiliza-
tion. Culturally, the eastern Hungarian eth-
nic frontier has been the traditional dividing 
line between German and Latin culture on 
the one hand and Slavic culture on the other. 
From the viewpoint of religion, Hungary rep-
resents the farthest outpost of Roman Cathol-
icism in Southeast Europe. Politically, the 
organization of parliamentary assemblies 
under a constitution preceded by several cen-
turies the establishment of similar Western-
type governmental institutions and parties in 
Eastern Europe. Being non-Slavic, non-
Orthodox, and highly individualistic, the 
Hungarians are predisposed to side with any 
adversary of Soviet power. This predisposi-
tion, firm even before World War II, became 
particularly intense in 1945 under the excesses 
of Soviet military occupation, and even more 
so after 1947-48, when a non-representative 
Hungarian Communist minority was imposed 
upon the anti-Communist masses and com-
plete isolation from the West set in. 
2. Among the factors which created, and will 
for an indefinite period of time continue to 
create, popular hostility toward the regime is 
a historically anti-Russian attitude stemming 
from 1848-49. At that time, Hungary's 
greatest self-liberating effort was frustrated 
by invading Russian armies. Significantly, 
many of the slogans of the 1956 revolt alluded 
to that earlier uprising, and many of the 
actions of the rebels were patterned after steps 
taken at that time. Still another element is 
rooted in the fact that for two decades pre-
ceding World War II, the climate of Hun-
garian opinion was dominated by a collective 
sense of frustration created by the huge losses 
which the country had suffered under the 
post-World War I peace treaty. It lost rough-
ly 64 percent of its territory and 58 percent of 
its population to Rumania, Czechoslovakia, 
and Yugoslavia. Hostility against neighbor-
ing beneficiaries of those losses continues 
to exist despite official Communist claims 
of close friendship among the People's De-
mocracies. 
3. Further contributing to the deep-rooted 
difficulties of the Communists are distasteful 
popular recollections of the country's earlier 
(1919) sanguinary Communist dictatorship, a 
fairly strong social democratic tradition 
among the working class, a persistent short-
age of new leadership potential because of 
indifference toward Communist indoctrina-
tion on the part of youth and shaky military 
morale of conscripts of anti-Communist 
peasant parentage. 
4. Of at least equal importance is the inade-
quate standard of living. Work norms are 
high, wages are low, housing is poor, and food 
is scarce. Soviet exploitation of the Hun-
garian economy was bitterly resented. Since 
the revolution shattered many segments of 
the Hungarian economy and since there are 
no real indications of economic liberalization, 
the economic factor of dissidence remains 
strong. 
5. Thus the attitude of the overwhelming ma-
jority of the population ? some 95 percent, if 
the recent general uprising is a guide ? to-
ward the regime ranges from hatred to 
apathy. The characteristics and attitudes 
cited above are buttressed by opposition to 
agricultural collectivization, stress on heavy 
industry to the detriment of consumers' goods 
production, cultural and psychological Soviet-
ization, anti-religious policies, regimentation 
of workers and the use of forced or quasi-
forced labor, and the thwarting of various 
aims of a nationalistic coloration. The Hun-
garian revolution of 1956 furnished a full-
scale demonstration of the degree and kind 
of anti-Communist and anti-Soviet potential 
of the Hungarian people.

MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
6. The majority of industrial workers, some of 
whom were among the few original supporters 
of Communism, constitute a major dissident 
element. They were foremost among the 
forces battling the Communist suppressors in 
the days of the revolution. Along with lack 
of national independence and personal free-
dom, they resent the limited attempts, if not 
the outright refusal on the part of the regime 
to satisfy the desire for more consumer goods 
and a higher living standard, the perversion 
of labor unions, the lack of safeguards against 
"speed-up" work without adequate incentives, 
unsafe and unsanitary working conditions, 
arbitrary penalties, activities of labor inform-
ers, harsh work discipline and exhausting 
work methods. 
7. The intellectuals who have sparked the up-
risings against the regime, continue to con-
stitute a resistance potential out of propor-
tion to their small numbers. They resent the 
suppression of freedom of expression, the iso-
lation from the West to which they feel cul-
turally bound, the intellectual deterioration 
behind a facade of educational and cultural 
pretensions, and the generally low level of 
Hungary's intellectual life within the imposed 
framework of an alien and inferior pattern. 
8. Youth. One of the most conspicuous fail-
ures of the regime has been its inability to 
secure the support of youth. Communist 
youth organizations have been plagued for 
years by a general apathy toward Party work. 
The participation of numerous youths in the 
uprising was impressive; even teen-age chil-
dren battled the Soviet forces with unbeliev-
able heroism. Youth resents the Party-
imposed discipline, the compulsion to absorb 
an alien philosophy (Marxism-Leninism) and 
to learn the Russian language and the im-
possibility of gaining access to the Western 
culture complex. 
9. The peasantry, although probably as anti-
Communist a group as any in Hungary, can 
hardly be counted on to furnish active organ-
ized resistance. The best key to the role they 
are likely to play in the future may be their 
behavior during the recent revolt, when peas-
ants spontaneously supported the insurgents 
by delivering food supplies, but did not enter 
the fighting to any extent. While their senti-
ments are doubtless basically unchanged, and 
while their resentment of government inter-
ference continues, it is possible that some of 
the opposition has been blunted by regime 
concessions, such as the deemphasis of collec-
tivization. 
10. Armed Forces. Before the 1956 revolu-
tion, considerable resistance potential was be-
lieved to exist within the Hungarian armed 
forces. Indeed, the Hungarian armed forces 
all but disintegrated during the uprising. A 
considerable portion of the military, officers 
as well as enlisted personnel, either refused to 
take action against the rebels or sided with 
the anti-regime forces to whom they gave 
weapons and with whom they fought side by 
side. As a result, a careful screening of mili-
tary personnel was initiated by the Kadar 
regime. Only those were to be retained who 
were considered unlikely to foment trouble 
and who were not known to have participated 
in the revolt against the Communists. The 
same criteria were applied to the new con-
scripts inducted in April 1957 (and undoubt-
edly to the additional class scheduled for in-
duction in the fall of 1957) and to the Fron-
tier Guard organization which has been newly 
created. Nevertheless, in spite of all precau-
tions and the strictest surveillance, it would 
be impossible for the regime at this time to 
organize any forces that are free of dissidence 
even though, as a result of careful screening, 
there is probably now somewhat less disaffec-
tion in the military establishment than in 
other elements of the population. 
11. The clergy, while it continues to exert con-
siderable influence among the people, has been 
showing signs of decreasing willingness to 
sharpen, or even discuss, outstanding issues 
in the Church-State relationship. The Cath-
olic Bench of Bishops, particularly adroit in 
pre-revolt times in applying between-the-lines 
techniques in sermons and statements, seems 
to have decided to exercise the utmost caution 
for the time being. The resistance potential 
on the Church leadership level generally, both 
Catholic and Protestant, appears to be at its 
lowest ebb in years.

SECRET 55 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
12. Even before the 1956 revolution, there was 
strong resentment against Soviet control and 
influence, but the effectiveness of the security 
system limited Hungarian resistance to pas-
sive, unorganized manifestations. Other fac-
tors, such as physically and psychologically 
exhausting work norms, material want, com-
pulsory political activities and unfavorable 
topography further discouraged active re-
sistance. On the other hand, passive resist-
ance in Hungary appeared to have been more 
widespread than elsewhere in the satellites. 
The 1956 revolution was almost certainly a 
spontaneous explosion which was as unex-
pected, even by Hungarians, as it was unor-
ganized. It demonstrated the intensity of 
anti-regime and anti-Soviet feeling in the face 
of overwhelming odds. But it cannot be re-
garded as a precedent. Its inevitable outcome 
served as a warning to active resisters every-
where that except under extraordinary condi-
tions, such ventures are bound to end in dis-
aster. It did show, however, the depth of 
hatred of Soviet and native Communist rule. 
13. The regime's awareness of the continuing 
validity of the basic reasons for dissidence is 
indicated by the intensive drives of repression 
which it carries on with the announced intent 
of eliminating "all vestiges" of the revolt. In 
the violent and sanguinary uprising, the peo-
ple showed themselves to be almost entirely 
united in their hatred of the Communist sys-
tem, the Soviet overlordship, and its local rep-
resentation. The Kremlin and the Hungarian 
regime are now, even more than before, facing 
a hostile population in Hungary, and the time 
when this hostility may subside is not in sight. 
TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
14. Profoundly dissatisfied under the Commu-
nist regime during the Stalin era, the Hun-
garian people expected major improvements 
after Stalin's death. However, the liberaliza-
tion program adopted in 1953, ameliorated 
only a few of the conditions at the root of the 
widespread dissidence. Relaxation of police 
terror and mitigation of peasant regimenta-
tion appeared to heighten popular demands 
rather than reconcile the population to the 
regime. 
15. Initially, liberalization seems to have had 
little effect on resistance. Passive resistance 
continued, as did isolated instances of indi-
vidual active resistance. There was no evi-
dence of anti-Communist organization and 
there were no instances of mass anti-regime 
action such as in East Germany and Czecho-
slovakia in 1953, in Poznan in the summer of 
1956, or even the Czech student demonstra-
tions in May 1956. However, there is abun-
dant evidence that after the 20th Congress of 
the CPSU, parts of the population, especially 
workers, perhaps encouraged by the example 
of the "revolting" Party intellectuals, vigor-
ously and uninhibitedly criticized Party lead-
ers and local functionaries in group meetings 
at the local level. But there is no substantial 
evidence that violent resistance was then con-
templated by any significant group. 
16. A very important manifestation of dissi-
dence on a mass scale, though unorganized, 
was the spontaneous turnout of many thou-
sands of Hungarians on the occasion of Rajk's 
reinterment early in October, 1956. As a prel-
ude to the nationwide uprising that took 
place some three weeks later, this demonstra-
tion was significant in that the Hungarian 
people, at least in Budapest, at one stroke be-
came conscious that their sentiments were 
fundamentally the same. Years of suffering 
at the hands of undercover security police, 
agents provocateurs, and informers had frag-
mented the Hungarians so that no one felt he 
could trust any other individual. The demon-
stration made them aware that untold thou-
sands of individuals shared the same senti-
ments upon which they were willing to act, 
even against the wishes of the regime. 
17. Within certain sectors of the Party, the 
comparatively liberal policies of the Nagy re-
gime in 1953 gave rise to a belief (expressed 
by the writers and other intellectuals) that 
modification of Communism toward greater 
freedom and humaneness was not only desir-
able but feasible. The Nagy experiment stim-
ulated the beginning of organized opposition 
by the intellectuals in late 1954. This opposi-
tion became increasingly vocal and far-reach-

56 SECRET 
ing in its demands, especially after the 20th 
Congress. It is unclear to what extent the 
opposition of Communist intellectuals and 
their collaborators to the Rakosi-Gero regime 
can be construed as resistance against the 
Communist system. It is unlikely that any 
substantial group of these avowed Commu-
nists contemplated the overthrow of the re-
gime or plotted violence. In fact, the intellec-
tuals' maximum program had more in com-
mon with political concepts of Western social 
democracy than with Communism. Accept-
ance of their program would have meant the 
end of Hungarian Communism as a one-party 
dictatorship subservient to the Soviet Union. 
The fact that the intellectuals approved the 
prospects of a non-Communist Hungary while 
the revolution was successful, does not neces-
sarily mean that they had consciously striven 
for these objectives in the preceding months. 
The evidence suggests rather that their orig-
inal and more consistent aims were limited to 
freedom of creation, i.e. freedom from Party 
press censorship, and did not extend to the 
destruction of the Communist system. 
18. This intellectual "revolt" established a 
unique link between an important body of the 
Communist Party and the population at large. 
For the first time people began to read the 
Communist press voluntarily and with gen-
uine interest. The grievances and hopes of 
the writers struck a responsive chord within 
the population, and hope arose that changes 
for the better could take place, particularly 
since influential Party members were agitat-
ing for them. 
19. Ferment within the Party, caused by the 
factionalism between Rakosi-Gero tradition-
alists and new liberalizers (adherents of the 
Nagy-type Communist program) can hardly 
be classified as resistance. Neither faction was 
anti-Communist in the sense that it envisaged 
the end of Marxist-Leninist system, though 
nationalistic impulses, explicitly or implicitly 
anti-Soviet, presumably motivated many of 
the liberals. However, as in the case of the 
dissension represented by the opposition of the 
intellectuals to the upper hierarchy, the split 
in the Politburo indirectly stimulated the pop-
ular resistance potential by the confusion it 
created. It must have been evident to the 
population that the Party could no longer 
claim monolithic unity. The confusion which 
the vagueness and zig-zagging of the Party 
line bred throughout the lower levels of the 
Party emboldened ever larger sectors of the 
population to challenge and defy Party direc-
tives and to hope for and demand far-reaching 
changes in the direction of humaneness, in-
ternal freedom, independence, and improved 
living conditions. 
POST-REVOLUTIONARY RESISTANCE 
20. Even though its translatability into action 
is undoubtedly far more limited than before, 
resistance potential may well be considered to 
be nearly as high as it was in the months pre-
ceding the uprising. Popular distaste for the 
regime and the entire Communist system is 
evidenced in various ways. Workers engage 
in slowdowns, absenteeism, and poor quality 
production, despite the regime's application of 
incentives on the one hand and punitive meas-
ures on the other. Party and government 
functions are poorly attended, and the Party, 
now reduced to 400,000 members, has had to 
admit the prevalence of skepticism and indif-
ference among its own members. 
21. Reports of organized resistance have been 
received continually since the Soviet suppres-
sion of the Hungarian revolt in November 
1956. Some of the reports received shortly 
after the revolt, have been verified and can be 
taken as evidence of organized resistance in 
the early months of 1957. Since that time, 
however, reliable information has been re-
placed more and more by reports of dubious 
validity. The evidence suggests a decline in 
the extent of organized resistance. This de-
cline is probably due to the increasing effec-
tiveness of government countermeasures and, 
to some extent, to loss of hope for immediate 
success in these activities. Moreover, in the 
generally flat terrain of Hungary, major armed 
resistance could not long survive. Neverthe-
less, the hiding of arms, one of the major 
reasons given by the Kadar regime in jus-
tifying many arrests, has been reported by 
several sources who claimed that a consid-
erable part of the small arms, given by 
Hungarian Army elements to revolutionary 
groups, were still missing.

SECRET 57 
22. Another form of organized post-revolt re-
sistance was the general strike late in 1956. 
When workers finally returned to the facto-
ries, they continued a virtual sabotage in the 
form of an evidently well-planned display of 
inactivity. As late as February 1957, this 
organized opposition apparently circulated 
such slogans as "Long Live Free Hungary, 
Long Live Imre Nagy!" 
23. During November, December and Janu-
ary, a strong organization of Workers' Coun-
cils was a major source of active opposition 
to the Kadar regime. Although the regime 
dissolved the central and regional councils in 
December 1956 and the local councils in No-
vember 1957, there was firm evidence during 
January 1957 that their spirit of resistance and 
a professional awareness of the importance 
of organization remained high. Members of 
these councils have volunteered the informa-
tion that they were changing tactics from 
overt to covert opposition. Early in January, 
they claimed a hidden radio transmitter for 
use in emergencies, facilities for printing a 
newspaper, a cache of arms, and an under-
ground network embracing the whole coun-
try. Later in the same month, they also 
claimed to be supported by a network of 
political parties and an organization of 
writers. 
24. The majority of the writers, grouped in 
the Hungarian Writers' Federation, showed 
signs of organized opposition up to the spring 
of 1957, drafting resolutions and voicing de-
mands on the Kadar government. This op-
position forced the regime to "suspend" the 
Federation's activities on 18 January and to 
dissolve it on 21 April. Arrests of writers 
have been announced from time to time. 
Many of the leading writers appear to have 
gone on a "silence strike," refusing to write 
for the Communist-approved publications. 
Although in the autumn of 1957, this "strike" 
showed signs of weakening ? such as the 
forced signing of the 13 September manifesto 
protesting the UN debate on Hungary its 
base still warrants consideration as a factor 
of potential resistance. 
25. Under these circumstances, considering 
the general exhaustion and frustration of the 
people, as a result of the unsuccessful revol-
ution and in view of the strong security 
measures of the Soviet-sponsored regime, no 
organized resistance can be expected in the 
near future. For the time being, at least, the 
simplest and safest method by which the 
citizen can resist is by carrying out his work 
in a superficial manner and only externally 
complying with regulations, consistent with 
self-preservation and personal security. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
26. The existence of a sizeable anti-Commu-
nist emigration has been a source of discom-
fort for Communist Hungary in the period 
since World War II. A vigorous repatriation 
campaign is being conducted to alleviate this 
situation. Emigre efforts to broadcast anti-
Communist material from the West have 
found some response in Hungary and have 
assisted in strengthening the morale of the 
numerous dissidents there. In general, how-
ever, Hungarians have tended to ignore emigre 
activities or to be critical of their leaders. 
Although some insurgents in late October 
1956 called for the return of certain emigre 
leaders, especially pre-Communist Premier 
Ferenc Nagy, their absence during long years 
of national plight was generally resented. 
The manifest inability of pre-revolutionary 
emigres to exert any influence on the upris-
ing has dealt a blow to their organizations 
in the Free World and it is not likely to be 
forgotten in their homeland. 
27. The Hungarian Veterans Comradeship 
Society (Magyar Harcosok Baj tarsi Kozos-
sege ? MHBK) an emigre organization of 
Fascist leanings under General Andras Zako, 
was considered for some years as militantly 
favoring Hungarian liberation from Commu-
nist rule. That it gave actual assistance to 
resistance groups inside Hungary, however, 
is doubtful. In 1953, the MHBK was thought 
to be disintegrating. An attempt to activate 
the group by proposing to stage an invasion 
was made, by General Zako, soon after the 
October 1956 revolt, but the proposal was not 
taken seriously by the West. The MHBK is 
not believed to have adherents capable of 
staging a resistance effort inside Hungary to-
day.

28. Pre- and post-revolutionary emigre groups, 
though acting mainly outside Hungary and 
not yet effectively united, have plans which 
may have the effect of strengthening the over-
all resistance potential in Hungary. Also, 
numerous individual members of the pre-rev-
olutionary emigre group in the Hungarian 
National Council, as well as the newer emigres 
in the Hungarian Freedom Federation, claim 
to maintain potentially useful contacts in 
Hungary. However, it remains doubtful that 
the present basic disposition of the Hungarian 
people toward resistance could be substantial-
ly influenced by emigre organizations. 
29. Of the emigres identified with Hungarian 
political parties, the Social Democrats, repre-
sented abroad by Anna Kethly, a member of 
Imre Nagy's coalition cabinet during the rev-
olution, are believed to have the strongest 
political resistance assets in Hungary today. 
She probably has retained most of her large 
personal following as a respected political 
leader. It is also probable that late in 1956 
the Social Democrats and other political 
parties, including the Smallholders, took steps 
to institute dual leadership at home and 
abroad to prepare for underground work. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
30. In order to obliterate the liberal trends 
and nationalist spirit of 1956, the Kadar re-
gime made a determined and apparently suc-
cessful effort to eliminate all discernible focal 
points of resistance. Repression has proven 
effective, insofar as it has reduced or thwarted 
the danger of any renewal of overt resistance, 
but it has failed to eradicate passive resistance 
and recalcitrance. During the immediate 
post-revolt period, and again in July and Au-
gust 1957, the regime resorted to domestic 
deportations. Until recently it has made spe-
cial efforts to publicize the trials and the harsh 
sentences of a large number of "counterrev-
olutionaries" in order to impress the people 
with its strength. The old AVH (Secret 
Police) has been reconstituted; now called 
BACs (State Security Group) , it operates 
ruthlessly and with apparent efficiency under 
the Ministry of Interior. The Central Work-
ers' Council, almost the equivalent of a peo-
ple's government during the early phase of the 
uprising, was outlawed on December 9, 1956; 
the Writers' Union was banned in April 1957. 
By April, the leaders of the Protestant 
churches were forced to reaffirm their support 
of the Kadar regime; on May 24 the Hun-
garian Catholic Church not only announced 
its adherence to the regime by joining the Na-
tional Peace Council but also formed an aux-
iliary peace movement ("Opus Pacis") within 
the Church itself, and on August 30 issued a 
purely political statement, first of its kind, in 
support of the regime (attacking the UN de-
bate on the Hungarian uprising) . 
CAPABILITIES OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
31. The Armed Forces which disintegrated 
during the revolution, have been gradually 
reconstituted. They appear to remain, de-
spite recurrent screenings, technically weak 
and of doubtful reliability. The present 
strength is estimated at 100,000. In addi-
tion, there are 35,000 militarized Security 
Forces, about 20,000 of whom are Frontier 
Guards. Morale of the armed forces is be-
lieved to be low but the Security Forces are 
probably somewhat less disaffected than the 
Army. Furthermore, in February 1957, a 
Party-directed Workers Guard, probably mod-
elled after the East German Kampfgruppen, 
was formed in order to prevent outbreaks 
against the regime in the industrial establish-
ments. It is not known how well organized 
or trained these elements are but it can be as-
sumed that the regime has selected for this 
role only those it considers to be the least 
susceptible to dissidence. 
32. The Hungarian security forces have made 
progress in re-establishing their pre-revolu-
tionary efficiency and organization. However, 
it will undoubtedly take some time before 
these security forces approach the level of or-
ganization and training achieved before the 
revolt. And it will be a long time before the 
organization responsible for functions for-
merly assigned to the State Security Authori-
ty (AVH) achieves the reliability of that ap-
paratus. The security police have had some 
difficulty in restoring its extensive informer 
system, which in fact probably hinders the 
attainment of its pre-revolutionary effective-

ness. They cannot be expected, and never 
were considered able, to suppress a revolt of 
any significant proportions, since this exceeds 
the normal function of the organization. The 
present regime could not suppress an outburst 
of any significant proportions with the indig-
enous machinery now available to it. The re-
gime owes its continued existence to the ma-
jor elements of six Soviet line divisions which 
are stationed in Hungary. 
MODIFICATION IN THE SECURITY 
APPARATUS 
33. As a result of the uprising, many agents 
were killed; many others left the country, and 
still others were unwilling to continue serving. 
At first two former AVH officers reconstituted 
the AVH as the "R Unit," and early in No-
vember 1956, three new officer regiments were 
reported as consisting largely of former AVH 
men in officer uniforms. That local armed 
forces were principally composed of former 
AVH members and Party functionaries was 
also reported in mid-December 1956. The or-
ganizing program seems to have proceeded 
rapidly in the following months with the re-
instatement of policy-level personnel belong-
ing to the Rakosi wing reported again in late 
May 1957. Also by May and probably earlier, 
the informer system, backbone of the AVH 
system, had been reorganized to some extent, 
and attempts were being made to recruit for-
mer rebels as spies and informers. The des-
ignation "R Unit" was not heard again. The 
new secret police, at first referred to as In-
terior Ministry Security Police, or Special 
Police Establishment, soon developed into the 
present BACs (State Security Group). The 
widespread and growing volume of arrests of 
"counter-revolutionaries" up to the summer 
of 1957, may indicate the increasing efficiency 
of the secret police. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
34. Under peacetime conditions, passive re-
sistance would undoubtedly increase if there 
were a substantial relaxation of police meas-
ures. Such circumstances might even render 
an eventual crystallization of some organized 
resistance possible. However, no such relaxa-
tion appears likely in the foreseeable future. 
Even if it did occur, tangible developments 
would materialize only after an initial period 
of undeterminable length, during which the 
population could convince itself that the re-
laxation was not a tactical device camouflag-
ing a trap. Strong police control, Soviet occu-
pation, disillusionment over the lasting effec-
tiveness of open resistance in the light of the 
recent experiences, and the absence of visible 
prospects of outside assistance will limit re-
sistance efforts in Hungary, for the foresee-
able future, to minor and sporadic acts of de-
fiance and sabotage. The regime may be in-
creasingly successful in neutralizing all focal 
points of organized resistance; in the absence 
of war, even without sizeable additions to its 
ranks, a Soviet-supported apparatus seems 
quite adequate to prevent the development 
and spread of any important organized re-
sistance. 
35. Nevertheless, there probably still exist 
some resistance nuclei which have been in-
genious enough to evade detection. They may 
be able for some time to maintain contact 
security, and to cache arms and other equip-
ment. Similarly, they could accomplish a 
small number of acts of sabotage and produce 
propaganda leaflets. Their possibilities for 
spearheading a renewed uprising seem re-
mote, given the general attitude and psy-
chological condition of the majority of the 
population and the systematic efforts on the 
part of the regime to destroy any remnants of 
expectation and hope which prevailed before 
the October uprising. 
36. More difficult for the regime to cope with 
is the resistance potential of the intelligentsia. 
Evidence suggests the possibility of some form 
of organization among anti-regime students 
and intellectuals. The latter have displayed 
a form of passive resistance in that they do 
not produce for the regime's propaganda pub-
lications. Their capabilities probably do not 
extend beyond this form of resistance, since 
the regime-sponsored publications do not per-
mit expression of their real views openly or by 
"Aesopian" devices which they used success-
fully before the revolution. Students will

probably continue to defy the regime by vari-
ous ingenious nuisance devices. Neither 
group seems to have the opportunity, which 
existed before the revolution, to forge a link 
between their own aims and aspirations and 
those of the population at large. 
37. Unorganized active resistanoe, possibly 
making use of arms hidden during and after 
the revolution, may occur from time to time 
but is unlikely to be of more than local sig-
nificance. Unorganized passive resistance, 
however, will continue to be widespread. It 
is capable of sabotaging or slowing down in-
dustrial and agricultural production and, in 
covertly disregarding the regime's orders, it 
may remain a source of embarrassment for 
Hungarian as well as other Eastern European 
Communist leaders. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
38. Under conditions of open warfare, a con-
tinuing lack of massive popular support would 
undoubtedly act as a great hindrance to the 
regime and to its Soviet mentors even in the 
performance of the relatively minor tasks the 
regime could expect to be assigned. In the 
initial stages of a war, the Hungarian regime 
would increase its security measures, and it 
would be difficult for the people to engage in 
effective resistance activities. The populace 
would attempt to slow down both industrial 
and agricultural production. It would try to 
disrupt transportation and communications, 
and would probably manage to publish propa-
ganda against the Soviet war effort. Some 
men anticipating induction into the Armed 
Forces would hide in an attempt to avoid 
service. Most Hungarians would watch for 
opportunities to aid the forces opposing the 
Bloc more actively and many would bide their 
time, awaiting a chance to go over to the 
enemy. However, large-scale desertions and 
organized resistance activities would not take 
place until basic Soviet weaknesses in the field 
became manifest or at least one major mili-
tary defeat was inflicted upon Soviet forces. 
39. The regime has tried to recover all arms 
and other supplies hidden by Hungarians dur-
ing and after the 1956 revolt, but there still 
remain considerable quantities of hidden 
small arms scattered throughout the country. 
They are almost certainly insufficient, how-
ever, to permit large-scale or effective armed 
resistance. Thus, the capability of the 
Hungarians for anti-Bloc military activity 
and ? to a large extent ? for sabotage would 
be largely dependent upon supplies of arms, 
munitions, and explosives from outside. 
40. In the initial stages of war, the major con-
tribution of dissident elements of the Hun-
garian populace to the Bloc's enemies would 
be acts of sabotage and intelligence collection. 
There would probably be little opportunity to 
assist in evasion and escape measures, but if 
channels for transmission could be estab-
lished, non-Bloc forces could expect to be sup-
plied with complete descriptions of Soviet 
activities inside Hungary. 
41. If actual fighting were taking place on or 
near Hungarian territory, Hungarian resist-
ance elements would intensify their efforts. 
It would not matter to them which side ap-
peared to be winning; their efforts would be 
concentrated on assistance to the enemies of 
the Soviets. As the actual conflict drew closer 
to Hungary, opportunities to assist in evasion 
and escape efforts would be multiplied. 
Familiarity with the topographic features of 
their own country and with Soviet search 
techniques would enable the Hungarians to 
facilitate the escape of enemy soldiers. Prox-
imity to the scene of battle would make it 
easier to pass intelligence to the enemy. If 
supplied with radios, the Hungarians would 
probably provide intelligence information 
more rapidly than non-Bloc forces could ex-
ploit it. If supplied with arms and special 
equipment, the Hungarians could be expected 
to organize guerrilla bands which, through 
hit-and-run tactics, would be able to tie down 
significant numbers of Bloc troops and also 
deprive the USSR of some of its forward oper-
ations based in Hungary. In the event of sub-
stantial Soviet reverses in war, all major fac-
tors and forces of the recent revolt could be 
expected to come into play on a scale and with 
an intensity probably even larger than that of 
last fall's explosion. The validity of this 
assumption is made secure by the continuing 
existence of every major factor from which

SECRET 61 
popular opposition to Soviet occupation and 
Soviet-sponsored Communist rule stems in 
Hungary. 
42. The nationality of attacking forces would 
not be a factor adversely influencing the de-
gree and extent of resistance operations and 
capabilities. The attitudes and actions of re-
sistance groups in other Bloc countries would 
probably strongly influence the Hungarians. 
Cooperation with resistance groups in other 
Bloc countries would develop after the initial 
uprising and particularly if other resistance 
groups could help supply the Hungarians with 
arms and equipment. Also, circumstances 
surrounding the initiation of hostilities would 
not affect resistance capabilities. The Hun-
garians probably would approve the initiation 
of hostilities since they regard a war as pro-
viding the best means of liberation. 
43. Hungarian hatred of the Soviets is so in-
tense that the people probably would accept 
the use of any instrument of war, including 
nuclear weapons, against Soviet forces in 
Hungary. However, the physical destruction 
and social dislocation resulting from a large 
scale nuclear attack on Hungary could be ex-
pected to virtually destroy Hungarian capa-
bilities for resistance. If a nuclear air attack 
could be so designed as to eliminate the major 
resources of the governmental and political 
strengths of the regime, Hungarian resistance 
capabilities would not necessarily be adversely 
affected. Thus, an opportunity would emerge 
for Hungarian resistance groups to take over 
control of the country if the following addi-
tional conditions should prevail: (a) develop-
ment of effective leadership and coordination 
in resistance groups; (b) provision of material 
support; and (c) assurance of early direct 
military support. 
44. Occupation policies of Western forces 
would not be a crucial factor affecting resist-
ance potential and capabilities so long as 
these policies were pronounced to respect and 
aid in the accomplishment of Hungarian aspi-
rations for freedom, independence and the 
end to Soviet domination. Thus, enlightened 
occupation by non-Bloc forces would intensify 
the Hungarian desire to be helpful. Hun-
garian capabilities for assisting the occupying 
power in areas of the country which were not 
yet taken would be enhanced by a cooperative 
attitude on the part of the occupier. 
45. Questions of a future regime and of the 
specific character of agencies to be instru-
mental in the liberation are likely to be re-
garded by the people as secondary in relation 
to liberation itself. The question of German 
rearmament, a key item in Communist propa-
ganda, is to be viewed in this light. Although 
many fundamental and even irreconcilable 
differences exist between the German and 
Hungarian mentality and character, the cul-
tural affinities of the two peoples are based 
on a common Western heritage. Also, in con-
tradistinction to the situation vis-a-vis Czech-
oslovakia, Rumania, and Yugoslavia as re-
ferred to in paragraph 2, Hungary has no ter-
ritorial claims against Germany. However, if 
armed units of countries toward which Hun-
garians are now hostile, participated in efforts 
to liberate Hungary, it may be assumed that 
such units would be welcomed.

SECRET 63 
ANNEX G?NORTH KOREA 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. The principal sources of in North 
Korea are the regime's drastic industrial re-
construction and expansion effort and the 
agricultural collectivization program, which, 
following the extreme suffering and demands 
made during the hostilities, have placed an 
extraordinarily heavy burden on the North 
Korean people. Additional factors tending to 
create or stimulate dissidence are: (1) the ex-
istence of a rival Korean government in the 
South offering an alternative focus of loyalty; 
(2) the continued presence of large numbers 
of foreign troops within the country; (3) past 
and potential future factional rivalries in the 
North Korean ruling hierarchy between the 
dominant pro-Soviet elements and the minor-
ity "Yenan" faction, and (4) the latent clash 
of interests and competition between the So-
viet Union and Communist China for control 
of North Korea which these factional rivalries 
reflect. In most other respects the objectives, 
overall approach, and systems of control of 
the North Korean rulers are the same as those 
of Communist regimes elsewhere, and most of 
the specific factors creating are the 
same. However, because of the cultural and 
intellectual backwardness of the predomi-
nantly agricultural North Korean society, the 
North Koreans' extreme isolation from the 
outside world and their complete inexperience 
with free, modern, and independent govern-
ment before 1945, their resistance, present 
and potential, to Communist domination is 
less intense than among the satellites with 
experience and contacts in the modern world. 
2. A further important reason for dissidence 
has been the imposition by the regime of 
oppressive burdens on the populace, such as 
heavy taxes, forced contributions to political 
and social organizations, forced labor, direct 
or indirect pressures to turn farmers into in-
dustrial laborers, farm collectivization, short-
ages of consumer goods, high production 
quotas for industrial and farm workers, and 
military conscription. During the hostilities, 
loss of life and property and other direct and 
indirect suffering brought the populace to a 
state of almost complete exhaustion. Though 
more than four years have passed since the 
hostilities ended and North Korea has received 
aid from the Sino-Soviet Bloc, the war dam-
age, the reconstruction program, and the 
maintenance of a military force exceeding 
that at the beginning of the hostilities exacts 
heavier contributions from the reduced popu-
lation than those required before the hos-
tilities. 
3. Another factor contributing to dissension 
in North Korea is the close supervision and 
control exercised by the regime over all facets 
of personal life. However, Stalinist-type per-
secution is no longer needed except for occa-
sional purges of Party members and govern-
ment functionaries. Agricultural landlords, 
Christians, middle class elements, and other 
anti-Communists who did not flee to South 
Korea in the early years of Communist control 
generally are being controlled through Com-
munist-dominated "social" organizations and 
"punishment" is being meted out by discrim-
inatory treatment and surveillance rather 
than through persecution. Also discrimi-
nated against and under close surveillance is 
the large minority of the population who col-
laborated with the UN forces during their 
occupation of North Korea, or who are closely 
related to members of any of these suspect 
groups. 
4. The existence of a rival Korean govern-
ment asserting jurisdiction and seeking con-
trol of the Korean peninsula also has a bear-
ing on dissidence. The appeal of the ROK to 
North Koreans has been minimized to some 
extent by the antagonisms inevitably engen-
dered by the war, by North Korean propa-
ganda, vilifying the Republic and contrasting 
the situation in the north and south to the

64 SECRET 
disadvantage of the ROK, and by a lack of 
sympathy for the Rhee government. Never-
theless, there exists considerable sentiment 
for the ROK in North Korea even though few 
North Koreans in the present situation would 
be willing to assume the risks involved in 
actively supporting the ROK. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
5. Dissidence, unhappiness and hopelessness 
exist to varying degrees in almost every ele-
ment of North Korean society. However, the 
extent of such feelings in terms of resistance 
potential is difficult to estimate. It can al-
most certainly be presumed that dissidence is 
limited to relatively small numbers in the 
various social groups, a phenomenon which is 
partly attributable to the fact that more than 
two million persons who might have strength-
ened the resistance potential, have fled to 
South Korea since World War II. 
6. Dissidence is intense among the small rem-
nants of the Christian and former middle-
class groups and in the suspect elements of 
the populace that are kept under surveillance 
and are treated in discriminatory fashion be-
cause of their relationship to anti-Commu-
nists. The farmers remain basically out of 
sympathy with the objectives of the regime. 
As recently as September 1957, the regime 
listed as one of its major tasks in the agricul-
tural field the "socialist transformation" of 
the peasants' thinking, which it characterized 
as "lagging far behind their socialist environ-
ment." Two post-armistice policies are par-
ticularly important causes of among 
the farmers: wage increases and other pref-
erential treatment granted to industrial 
laborers and the government's program of 
agricultural "cooperativization," now nearly 
completed. The industrial laborers, too, prob-
ably are generally unhappy and frustrated, 
but on a lesser scale than the farmers. They 
are treated as a privileged group in contrast 
to the farmers, but are subjected to oppressive 
labor requirements. Army morale is proba-
bly only fair despite indoctrination, though 
dissidence is probably mild in the Air Force 
and the Navy which are much smaller and 
more select services. 
7. As industrialization proceeds the regime will 
become increasingly dependent on the middle 
ranks of the government bureaucracy and in-
dustrial technicians. Faced with a shortage 
of such personnel and without adequate facil-
ities for training them at home, the regime 
has sent several thousand students to the So-
viet Union and Eastern Europe for further 
education. The inevitable comparisons made 
by these young people between conditions in 
North Korea and in other parts of the world 
based on personal observation and increased 
access to information have profoundly 
shocked some and have undoubtedly affected 
all. Several North Korean students who de-
fected to the West commented that Eastern 
Europe appeared to be a paradise in compari-
son with their homeland. Korean students in 
Hungary joined the revolutionary forces in 
October and November 1956 and have since 
been returned to North Korea. These young 
technicians might also serve as a channel for 
introducing into North Korea the ideological 
ferment which has swept the Soviet bloc since 
the 20th Congress of the CPSU but which 
apparently has as yet had little effect on 
North Korea. 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
8. Despite widespread dissidence the North 
Koreans are inclined toward hopelessness and 
apathy rather than active resistance. More-
over, as prospects for reestablishment of non-
Communist control over the area have de-
clined, the will to resist appears to have dimin-
ished. Dissidence is seldom voiced and even 
less frequently acted upon since the regime 
provides severe punishment for any infraction 
of its laws and regulations. Although there 
are geographic areas, particularly in the 
rugged, mountainous terrain of North-central 
Korea, in which dissidence could be mani-
fested by guerrilla activity, there are no 
known guerrilla groups in existence. Pres-
ently, dissidence is of such a low intensity as 
to preclude a popular movement. Only if the 
Communist control apparatuses were weak-
ened and the regime seemed on the verge of 
crumbling under outside pressures, would a 
substantial minority probably be willing to 
participate in resistance activities with any

SECRET 
prospect of success. But in the present situ-
ation actual resistance on any significant 
scale is unlikely and in fact virtually im-
possible. 
9. Such resistance as does occur in North 
Korea is primarily directed not at Commu-
nism per se or at Soviet domination but at the 
North Korean regime itself. Ideological con-
siderations are not a major contributing fac-
tor in creating dissension in North Korea, and, 
except for the small remnant of the Christian 
community in North Korea, apparently few 
people strongly oppose Communism as a sys-
tem. Nor is there much opposition to Soviet 
domination which is exercised through an 
ostensibly "native Korean" regime. However, 
there is at least some opposition to those 
North Korean policies which appear to favor 
the USSR over the needs and desires of the 
North Koreans themselves. This opposition is 
almost certainly stimulated by the strong na-
tional consciousness of the Korean people and 
their long history of resistance to external 
domination. Although the presence of nearly 
300,000 Chinese Communist troops in North 
Korea has undoubtedly aroused some resent-
ment and nationalist sentiment, it does not 
appear to have caused widespread discontent 
among the population at large. 
TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
10. North Korea does not appear to have been 
affected directly by the events which followed 
the death of Stalin. Rather, it has been 
struggling with its reconstruction program 
following the cessation of hostilities. Changes 
in the regime's policies were the result of in-
ternal rather than external developments. 
Even in relation to developments elsewhere in 
the Sino-Soviet Bloc, North Korea has re-
mained surprisingly isolated. 
11. The regime has not relaxed its rehabilita-
tion and development programs and has not 
altered the policy of giving priority to the 
development of heavy industry. Neither the 
Soviet criticism of the "cult of personality" 
nor the Chinese Communist "hundred flow-
ers" policy have been echoed in North Korea. 
The Hungarian revolt was not extensively re-
ported in the North Korean press, and the 
65 
scale and character of the outbreak were mini-
mized and distorted. Its effect on the possi-
bility of rebellion in North Korea has probably 
been minimal, although the return of students 
sent to Eastern Europe may inject an intel-
lectual ferment previously lacking. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
12. Guerrilla activity in North Korea, which 
was extensive in 1951 immediately following 
the withdrawal of UN forces from the area, 
steadily declined during the remainder of the 
hostilities as the battle line stabilized. At the 
time of Stalin's death, which preceded the 
signing of the Korean armistice by less than 
five months, virtually all guerrilla bands, 
which had been most numerous in central 
Hwanghae Province just north of the present 
demilitarized zone, had been driven onto the 
off-shore islands, where they presumably have 
since been liquidated. Guerrilla activity in 
the latter stages of the hostilities appears to 
have been sustained only where it was linked 
with the UN command; aside from such 
groups, resistance activities after the Commu-
nists regained control were minor. 
13. Since the conclusion of the armistice, 
guerrilla and other resistance activity appears 
to have declined almost to the vanishing 
point. Some small guerrilla groups were re-
ported to have been holding out in the moun-
tainous areas of Hwanghae and North P'yon-
gan Provinces as recently as early 1956, but 
their continued survival is doubtful. Active 
resistance appears to be limited to the occa-
sional distribution of leaflets and mutilation 
of Communist posters, some intelligence col-
lection, and rare instances of sabotage and 
assassination of members of the North Korean 
armed forces, apparently on an unorganized 
basis. No organized resistance groups are 
known to be in existence at the present time. 
14. Unorganized passive resistance is probably 
fairly widespread in North Korea, particularly 
among the farmers, whose failure to identify 
themselves with the official policies and aims 
has been acknowledged by the regime. Such 
passive resistance, however, is probably char-
acterized more by apathy and unwillingness 
to expend effort in accomplishing the tasks set

by the regime than by a deliberate effort to 
obstruct those tasks through a slowdown. 
Student elements probably retain the best 
resistance potential as do relatives of persons 
adversely affected by regime policies. Never-
theless, so long as the present regime remains 
in power, even unorganized resistance has 
only dim prospects. 
ROLE OF REFUGEES 
15. The presence in South Korea of large 
numbers of North Korean refugees constitutes 
a strong attraction for their compatriots still 
in the North and represents a potential source 
of leadership and guidance in the event that 
effective resistance in the North should be-
come feasible. However, although there is 
some contact between the members of fam-
ilies split between the North and the South, 
this relationship appears to have little politi-
cal significance. The ROK is known to have 
penetrations into North Korea, but there is no 
evidence that there has been contact with 
potential resistance groups in the North, 
much less any support to them. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
16. The North Korean security apparatus, 
under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, com-
prises, in addition to its administrative per-
sonnel, political police, security guards, border 
and railroad constabulary police, and regular 
constabulary police. Through strict controls 
on speech, press and radio listening, and 
through constant local surveillance, the re-
gime keeps alert to any indication of dissen-
sion. Travel controls are very thorough, espe-
cially in Kaesong and the rest of the area 
adjacent to the Demilitarized Zone. Rela-
tives of persons who have gone to South Korea 
are particularly watched and discriminated 
against. There has been considerable reloca-
tion of persons resident in Kaesong and other 
areas of unrest. Families of medical students 
who participated in the Hungarian uprising 
are reported to have been imprisoned. 
CAPABILITY OF THE REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
17. Although the majority of North Koreans 
probably dislike the regime and respond 
apathetically to its demands and appeals, they 
are effectively controlled by the Soviet-trained 
security apparatus and by the omnipresent 
cadres of the Korean Labor Party. There is 
every reason to believe that the regime would 
be capable of suppressing opposition from any 
internal quarter without Soviet or Chinese 
Communist aid. 
18. Security controls which had been intensi-
fied at the time of the Armistice in July 1953 
were made more rigid at the time of the Hun-
garian revolt. The number of security guard 
forces has been sizably increased, particularly 
in the border and port areas, in the interests 
of even stricter travel control. No popular 
reaction has been reported, though there prob-
ably is a greater feeling of intimidation. In 
addition there has been an increase of marine 
patrolling of the coast during the last year. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
19. Assuming continuation of the armistice, 
resistance in North Korea is unlikely to be of 
much significance. At best it may provide a 
limited source of intelligence. Organized re-
sistance groups apparently have been unable 
to sustain operations against the regime and 
have little prospect of greater success in the 
future. Unorganized passive resistance may 
increase in the future if the economic burden 
on individual North Koreans increases or if 
security controls are relaxed. A substantial 
improvement in the standard of living 
throughout North Korea would probably re-
duce dissension significantly. Barring re-
sumption of hostilities in Korea, however, dis-
sension is generally unlikely to be translated 
into active resistance. 
20. Prolonged and open unrest within the 
USSR, presaging a weakening in the Soviet 
system, would undoubtedly have a profound 
effect on North Korea, should such events 
become known by any sizeable number of peo-
ple. Moreover, the existence of anti-Soviet, 
pro-Communist Chinese elements has been 
confirmed, and the historical evidence of 
Korean inclination toward China is strong 
enough to suggest that a switch from policies 
supporting the USSR to those favoring Corn-

munist China might occur. Such an event 
however, would probably not mean a very 
marked departure from the present state of 
affairs and it is highly unlikely that any pro-
ROK or US group would be able to exert any 
significant influence. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
21. Under conditions of open war, North 
Korean resistance potential would probably 
increase somewhat but would still be limited 
to isolated instances of sabotage, some passive 
resistance defections, assistance to anti-Com-
munist personnel in escape and evasion opera-
tions, and some intelligence collection. Mili-
tary action by resistance elements without 
external support would be virtually impossi-
ble. Increased domestic security measures 
and external bloc support for the regime 
would make organized resistance highly un-
likely except immediately in front of advanc-
ing non-Communist forces. Nor could North 
Korean troops be counted on to defect since 
they are considered politically reliable. 
22. The circumstances surrounding the initi-
ation of hostilities would have little effect on 
resistance potential. The same is true of the 
use of tactical nuclear weapons against 
selected targets. However, if large-scale nu-
clear warfare were used, the possibilities of 
effective resistance would be negligible. 
23. The nationality of any Free World forces 
would not matter provided that no Japanese 
forces were employed. If a US-type military 
government were instituted by occupation 
forces, staffed by ROK personnel and receiv-
ing Western support and guidance, most 
North Koreans would probably accept it and 
resistance in areas still under Communist 
control might be stimulated. 
24. The aspirations of individual resistance 
factions for post-war leadership probably 
would not be of great significance.

ANNEX H?NORTH VIETNAM 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. Economic pressures are probably a major 
factor in creating dissidence in the Commu-
nist "Democratic Republic of Vietnam" (DRV, 
North Vietnam). The levies, regulations, and 
controls of the regime impose a heavy burden 
on the population, especially when compared 
with economic measures in South Vietnam. 
Agricultural taxes, principally a levy of about 
40 percent of paddy yields, deprive peasants 
of almost all surplus output, while local mer-
chants face stiff taxes calculated to prevent 
the accumulation of wealth. In addition, the 
dearth of trained technicians of all kinds, 
bureaucratic unwieldiness, and the disruption 
of normal trade channels have tended to 
hamper economic growth. Living standards 
although slightly improved since the signing 
of the Geneva Agreements are still low; rice 
yields are poor; and population pressures are 
great. Other important factors in the crea-
tion of resentment are the regime's rigid 
police-state restrictions; the bloodshed and 
personal hardships in the rural areas, caused 
by the regime's agrarian reform policies dur-
ing the past three years; its continued use of 
terroristic methods; its persecution of cer-
tain socio-economic, minority, and religious 
groups; its disruption of the traditionally 
strong family ties of the Vietnamese; and the 
influence in the DRV of the Chinese, who have 
long been feared and disliked in Vietnam. 
2. Generally, the popular appeal of the re-
gime, following the military victory over the 
French and the 1954 Geneva Agreements, has 
diminished in recent years largely for the rea-
sons mentioned above. The inherently re-
pressive nature of the Communist regime has 
become increasingly clear to the Vietnamese 
public since Geneva, and this revelation prob-
ably has shaken the allegiance of many of its 
supporters. The steady consolidation of Pres-
ident Ngo Dinh Diem's anti-Communist gov-
ernment in South Vietnam, where levies, reg-
ulations, and controls are less stringent than 
in the North, has provided an irritating con-
trast to the North Vietnamese regime for the 
allegiance of its citizens. To combat this com-
petition, the DRV seeks to direct popular re-
sentment against Diem's government, which 
it portrays as an American puppet, and 
against the United States itself, which it 
claims has taken over France's colonialist 
aspirations in the area, is perpetuating the 
division of the country, and is responsible for 
most of the area's economic difficulties. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
3. Catholics. The estimated 700,000 Cath-
olics in the DRV (roughly six percent of the 
population) probably constitute the largest 
single concentration of actual or potential 
dissidents in the country. The general hos-
tility of Vietnamese Catholics to Communist 
rule has been demonstrated on several occa-
sions. Soon after the division of Vietnam in 
mid-1954, for example, about 700,000 Catho-
lics from North Vietnam sought refuge in 
South Vietnam. More recently, the fact that 
the November 1956 uprisings in Nghe An 
Province occurred in primarily Catholic vil-
lages indicates that those who remained be-
hind ar'e far from reconciled to the DRV re-
gime. Catholic dissatisfaction with the DRV's 
treatment of the church has been stimulated 
by the contrast with the favored position the 
church occupies in South Vietnam, where 
Diem and many other leaders are devout 
Catholics. Nevertheless, church leaders in the 
north have not encouraged overt resistance to 
the regime, evidently an effort to ensure the 
church's survival. Although they have re-
sisted DRV encroachments upon the church's 
prerogatives, they apparently have sought to 
avoid openly hostile acts that presumably 
would result in even more stringent DRV con-
trol measures.

70 SECRET 
4. Tribal Minorities. The Vietnamese have 
traditionally disdained the tribal minorities 
who, for their part, fear and dislike the Viet-
namese. Approximately 900,000 tribal minor-
ity peoples in North Vietnam are acknowl-
edged by the regime to be a source of disaffec-
tion. Made up of a variety of groups such as 
the Tho, Nung, White and Black Thai, Muong, 
Meo, and Man, they are located chiefly in up-
land and mountainous regions in the northern 
part of North Vietnam and along the western 
boundary with Laos. DRV authorities have 
placed tight restrictions on entry into and 
egress from many of these areas, while they 
have sought to bring the tribes under control 
by a combination of force and persuasion. 
Communist cadres assigned to these areas 
have often increased tribal hostility, accord-
ing to some reports, by disregarding tribal 
hierarchies and customs. The tribal peoples, 
however, are disunited, and lack modern 
weapons. 
5. The Peasantry. Many of the peasants 
(who make up perhaps 90 percent of the pop-
ulation) feel dissatisfied with the regime, par-
ticularly as a result of the DRV's agrarian re-
form program during the past three years. 
Since mid-1956 there has been extensive criti-
cism in DRV media of the agrarian reform 
cadres for arousing popular resentment, im-
pairing the Lao Dong Communist Party's 
foundations, and causing tension in the coun-
tryside. Regime attempts to correct the mis-
takes have generally not been successful, how-
ever. While present resistance has occasion-
ally taken the form of violence, apparently 
spontaneous and unorganized, in most cases 
rural dissidence seems to have been expressed 
by failure to respond to the regime's agrarian 
program or by general apathy. Fear and 
hopelessness appear to characterize the peas-
ant's outlook, and deliberate efforts to sabo-
tage DRV policies are rarely made. 
6. Intellectuals. There are indications that 
some dissidence exists among intellectuals. in 
North Vietnam, especially those who were 
French-educated and French oriented. Dur-
ing the latter half of 1956, the regime, copying 
the Soviet pattern of admitting errors and 
adopting a "liberalized" policy to correct the 
errors, somewhat relaxed its censorship and 
allowed criticism of DRV policy in various 
newspapers. These papers, non-Party but 
still supporters of the regime, quickly ex-
ceeded the acceptable limits of criticism and 
were suspended in mid-December 1956. None-
theless, the rapidity with which some intellec-
tuals responded to this one opportunity to air 
their grievances is an indication that the re-
gime's efforts to win over this group have not 
been wholly successful. 
7. Landlords and Merchants constitute ele-
ments of dissidence on an individual basis, 
but they have not been nor are they likely to 
become leaders of effective resistance. Mer-
chants, reportedly engaged in extensive 
hoarding, speculation, and tax evasion, are 
contributing to the regime's poor economic 
situation. 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
8. Although there have been widespread indi-
cations of dissidence, the North Vietnamese 
generally do not seem to feel impelled to active 
resistance. Few have ever known anything 
other than marginal living standards, author-
itarian government, and insecurity; they also 
are extremely war-weary following the years 
of fighting in the area. Accordingly they 
seem to possess a large capacity for enduring 
privation and repression, and many have be-
come apathetic. Moreover, the strength of 
the regime's control apparatus and the gen-
eral lack of a means for armed resistance pre-
sumably make potential resistance elements 
even more discreet. Outbreaks of violence 
that have occurred appear to have been local-
ized, unpremeditated and unorganized flare-
ups. 
9. Most dissidence in North Vietnam seems 
directed primarily at the DRV regime itself. 
Catholic dissidence and resistance activity 
probably is directed at Communism per se, 
although the distinction between the regime 
and the ruling ideology probably is not sharp-
ly drawn. There have been no reports of any 
ill will directed specifically against Soviet or 
Chinese Communist influence, even though 
fear and dislike of the Chinese people prob-
ably provides a supplementary motivation for 
resistance.

SECRET 71 
10. There does not seem to have been any ma-
terial change in the basis and intensity of dis-
sidence in North Vietnam as a result of new 
Soviet policies adopted after Stalin's death. 
The 20th Soviet Party congress, the disorders 
in Poland and Hungary, and the appearance 
of ideological differences and factionalism 
within other Communist parties do not seem 
to have had any lasting impact on DRV Party 
and government circles. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
11. From the time of Stalin's death to the 
signing of the Geneva Agreements about 16 
months later, most if not all organized resist-
ance activity in North Vietnam involved 
groups associated with the French and Viet-
namese forces engaged in hostilities with the 
Viet Minh. After the Geneva Agreements, 
however, most of these groups either withdrew 
from DRV territory or were rendered virtually 
impotent by DRV control measures. Fairly 
continuous but minor conflicts seem to have 
occurred between small groups of tribal 
minorities and DRV forces in the areas now 
known as the Thai-Meo Autonomous Zone, 
Viet Bac Autonomous Zone, and the North-
east Zone. Vietnamese Catholics seem to have 
played a prominent role in numerous local 
anti-regime disturbances during the last half 
of 1956 and the first half of 1957. The most 
publicized and probably most severe outbreaks 
of resistance were those tliat occurred in Nghe 
An Province in November 1956. Although 
this uprising was followed later by scattered 
anti-regime disturbances in other localities, 
no general resistance movement evolved. 
12. No reliable information is available con-
cerning any organized resistance groups that 
may now be operating in North Vietnam. 
Presumably some members of Catholic lay 
organizations which existed in North and 
Central Vietnam prior to the Geneva Agree-
ments have remained. These organizations, 
such as the Catholic Socialist Party (Dang 
Xa Hoi Cong Giao), the Youth Movement for 
Devotion to the Country (Thank Nien Phung 
Su Quoc Gia), and the Catholic militia, which 
prior to 1954 included about 11,000 members, 
might constitute a structural basis for organ-
ized resistance activities among the Catholic 
minority. It is possible also that small rem-
nants of several anti-DRV political parties and 
labor groups ? notably the Nationalist Party 
of Greater Vietnam (Dai Viet Quoc Dan 
Dang), the Vietnam Nationalist Party (Viet 
Nam Quoc Dan Dang), and the Vietnamese 
Confederation of Christian Workers ? which 
were active in North and north-central Viet-
nam before 1954 probably are still located in 
those regions, and retain some subversive 
potential. 
13. Potential resistance groups constitute 
less than ten percent of the DRV's total popu-
lation, and clearly lack the capacity to initiate 
successful, organized, active resistance. Most 
unorganized resistance is of a passive char-
acter extending from criticism of the regime 
by intellectuals to apathy and failure to ac-
tively support the regime by peasants. Pas-
sive resistance against the regime's agrarian 
policies will probably continue to impede Com-
munist goals. There have been recent reports 
of expressions of discontent among industrial 
workers over low wages and excessively high 
work norms. Dissatisfaction also exists 
among all classes of the population with con-
sumer goods shortages, the Communist eco-
nomic control system, and the 30 days com-
pulsory labor levy for all able bodied adults. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
14. Despite the border controls of the regime 
and its efforts to patrol a rugged and sparsely 
populated border area, considerable numbers 
of persons cross the borders, including some 
who are allowed to smuggle certain needed 
goods. A steady trickle of refugees continues 
to reach the South from the Catholic areas in 
North and northern Central Vietnam, and it 
may be assumed there is considerable contact 
between the Catholic refugees in South Viet-
nam and their families and compatriots in 
the North. There is no evidence, however, 
that guidance and assistance are at present 
being offered by Catholics in the South to any 
resistance groups in the North. There are 
known to be contacts by South Vietnamese 
government services with individuals in the 
denied areas in the North, but there is no evi-
dence that aid or guidance is being given to 
resistance groups there.

SECRET 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
15. The DRV regime has foreseen most actual 
and potential centers of resistance, and has 
adjusted its counter-subversion tactics in or-
der to meet the individual requirements of 
each resistance center. The "People's Army 
of Vietnam," one of the regime's major instru-
ments for suppressing resistance, now con-
sists of 268,000 well-organized and mobile reg-
ular troops. In addition, forces designed spe-
cifically for internal security, under the con-
trol of the regular army, include 38,000 re-
gional forces responsible for provincial secu-
rity, and a local militia, numbering 75,000 
responsible for local security. Border secu-
rity regiments of the regular army along the 
Laotian border and along the demilitarized 
zone above the 17th parallel are known to 
have security responsibilities. 
16. The DRV maintains strict controls over 
travel, documentation, press, radio and other 
media of expression. Party penetration of all 
mass organizations, social, and religious 
groups enables the regime to keep informed 
of the acts and attitudes of Vietnamese on all 
levels of society. With respect to the ethnic 
minorities, the DRV utilizes the system of 
penetration by Communist cadres of the same 
ethnic stock and background. There is some 
evidence to indicate that the regime has made 
use of Chinese Communist cadre-training cen-
ters in the Kunming area in Communist 
China for its work among minority tribal 
groups. It has also established a large school 
in Hanoi for giving instruction and indoc-
trination to promising members of ethnic 
minorities. An over-all literacy program has 
been started, both in tribal dialects and in 
Vietnamese, which incidentally make propa-
ganda and organization controls more effec-
tive. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
17. As long as the regime's leadership remains 
united and determined to check dissidence, it 
will be extremely difficult for future resistance 
to become organized and to grow in force and 
importance. Insofar as is known, actual or 
potential resistance groups are not united and 
have no background of common action against 
the Communists; their interests (except for 
their anti-regime outlook) do not coincide; 
and they have little power. Moreover, through 
its security and surveillance systems, the DRV 
is capable of effectively controlling whatever 
sporadic resistance activity arises in either 
Vietnamese or ethnic minority areas. Al-
though some sympathy reportedly was shown 
by army troops to the resisting villagers at the 
time of the Nghe An uprising, the military 
forces are believed loyal to the regime. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
18. At this time, it seems unlikely that organ-
ized or unorganized resistance to the regime 
will attain sufficient magnitude or intensity 
to impede seriously the realization of its fore-
most goals. The DRV has firm control of its 
security forces and can throttle any serious 
internal threat to its existence. Although 
some small and independent guerrilla bands 
may exist in the remote areas of North Viet-
nam where control is extremely difficult, there 
is little likelihood that an amalgamation of 
the various dissident groups could result. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
19. If hostilities were taking place outside 
Vietnam, the resistance potential within the 
DRV will probably increase, but only by minor 
proportions. It would probably be limited to 
annoying acts of sabotage, intelligence collec-
tion, and assistance to anti-Communist per-
sonnel in various forms. Independent mili-
tary action without external support would 
probably be suicidal for anti-regime elements 
unless the DRV security apparatus were 
greatly weakened. 
20. In the event of hostilities within North 
Vietnamese territory, resistance activity 
would probably assume more serious propor-
tions, especially if external assistance and 
encouragement were provided. Assistance to 
attacking forces would most likely take the 
form of sporadic uprisings which, however, 
would have little chance of becoming nation-
wide in scope because of the extremely poor 
communications. Aid in escape and evasion

SECRET 73 
operations could be expected throughout most 
of rural Vietnam. Assistance would be great-
est in the southern areas, among indigenous 
Catholic groups, and among other minorities, 
particularly the Meos. Resistance forces, al-
though small and un-coordinated, would still 
be able to disrupt and reduce the over-all 
strength of the regime. The intensity of 
active local resistance generally would depend 
on the success of local military action by 
attacking forces. 
21. The nationality of attacking forces would 
probably influence the willingness of resist-
ance groups to act. Tribal groups which have 
been helped by the French for many years 
would be most receptive to French invaders. 
Vietnamese would prefer to aid other Viet-
namese the most and the French the least. 
Participation of Nationalist Chinese might 
seriously jeopardize resistance and create an-
tagonism toward the occupation. 
22. A military government administered by 
Vietnamese in ethnic Vietnamese areas would 
probably have a salutary effect on resistance 
activities. A French occupation would be dis-
trusted by the majority of the Vietnamese peo-
ple, and would adversely affect anti-Commu-
nist partisan warfare. The occupation poli-
cies of the attacking forces would affect con-
tinued resistance capabilities. However, any 
occupation government of long duration, ad-
ministered and controlled by other than Viet-
namese, would probably be unpopular with 
the people of the occupied area. 
23. The circumstances surrounding the initi-
ation of hostilities would have little effect on 
resistance potential. The same is true of the 
use of tactical nuclear weapons against 
selected targets. However, in case of large-
scale nuclear warfare, the possibilities of effec-
tive resistance would be negligible.

ANNEX I - POLAND 
PREAMBLE 
1. Events of 1956 have made the pattern of 
dissidence and resistance in Poland far more 
complex than that in the other Eastern Euro-
pean satellite nations. There are anti-Com-
munists who do not oppose Gomulka; within 
the Party there are Communists who do. The 
population is basically anti-Communist and 
anti-Russian, yet it tolerates Gomulka be-
cause other possibilities look even less attrac-
tive. The Roman Catholic Church is basically 
anti-Communist, but Cardinal Wyszynski sup-
ports Gomulka's appeals for sobriety, hard 
work, and the nationalist aspects of his poli-
cies. Stalinist elements within the Party are 
die-hard orthodox Communists, yet they use 
every means to tear Party control away from 
Gomulka. "Revisionists" within the Party 
swear fealty to Marxism, but they resist 
Gomulka's narrow definition of the "Polish 
road to Socialism." In short, Poland is a con-
geries of dissident elements held together by 
strong nationalist sentiments, bitter memories 
of Soviet destruction of Hungarian freedom, 
the Roman Catholic religion, and the strong 
personalities of Wladyslaw Gomulka and 
Cardinal Wyszynski. 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
2. Despite Gomulka's successes in eliminat-
ing many sources of dissidence, a number of 
factors still operate to build popular dissatis-
faction. The most important of these is the 
failure of the regime to fulfill the hopes placed 
in it in October 1956. The population as a 
whole has been disappointed that there has 
been no automatic improvement in the stand-
ard of living. Workers especially have been 
shaken by the cold realities of the post-
October economic situation, and the more 
politically minded among them are dissatis-
fied that workers' councils failed to become 
real instruments of worker control of industry. 
Writers, journalists, intellectuals, and stu-
dents have been disillusioned to find the per-
missible bounds of freedom of expression to be 
narrower than they had hoped. 
3. The Gomulka regime's policies themselves 
have created additional sources of dissidence. 
The reduction of the governmental and Party 
bureaucracies has created a new source of dis-
sidence among former bureaucrats who have 
been forced to make radical readjustments in 
their personal lives as a consequence of the 
loss of their economic and social position. 
Encouragement of private handicraft indus-
tries as part of the program designed to ex-
pand consumers' goods production and the 
encouragement of private shops in trade and 
services to supplement the existing socialist 
network have stimulated black marketing, 
profiteering, and speculation and corruption. 
This in turn has led to the growth of a class 
of "new rich," who have aroused the enmity 
of the authorities and of a considerable por-
tion of the population. In the former Ger-
man territories now under Polish control, re-
gime suspicions toward and the previous 
regime's discrimination against the indig-
enous population have created a considerable 
degree of resentment among the people who 
resided in these areas before World War II, 
as well as among the remnants of the former 
German population. 
4. Given the basically anti-Communist and 
anti-Soviet attitude of the population, dissi-
dence is to be found in every element in Polish 
society. Although Gomulka has considerable 
personal popularity, he has been unable to 
transfer this popularity to the Party he heads 
and the system he represents. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
5. Peasants, although appreciative of the 
gains they have made under Gomulka, remain 
hostile to the regime's long-term objective of 
SECRET

76 SECRET 
reconstructing agriculture on socialist lines, 
and also to the continuation of compulsory 
deliveries, no matter how low the delivery 
quotas. The influence of the Church is espe-
cially strong in the countryside and helps to 
deepen the peasants' distrust of Communist 
policies and objectives. The revival of anti-
Communist influences within the ranks of the 
United Peasant Party (ZSL) has become a 
matter of major concern both to the leader-
ship of the ZSL and that of the Polish United 
Workers' (Communist) Party (PZPR). 
6. Industrial workers have expressed dissi-
dence in a series of strikes and threats to 
strike which have been a feature of Polish life 
ever since Gomulka's return to power. Al-
though none of these labor conflicts has had 
the political implications of the pre-Gomulka 
outbreak in Poznan, they do represent an 
open expression of dissatisfaction with the 
regime's wage policy. The outbreaks against 
civil authority which have become character-
istic of Polish life since Gomulka's return, 
seem to draw considerable strength from the 
ranks of young unskilled or semiskilled work-
ers. These people find that a tangle with the 
police affords them an opportunity to express 
their amorphous protests against the regime 
in general as well as a chance to express their 
contempt for the police. Special groups of 
workers who have suffered loss of employment 
or loss of status as the result of Gomulka poli-
cies are particularly agitated. 
7. Among intellectuals, dissidence arises out 
of the regime's efforts to gradually but firmly 
reduce the limited freedom of expression 
which, for a short time, had been permitted 
to contribute materially to the 1956 changes 
in Polish politics. The increasing strictness 
of controls over the press has heightened dis-
satisfaction among the writers and journalists 
who played an important role in the upheaval 
of 1956 and their aftermath and whose strong 
opposition to the USSR and the Soviet system 
of pre-Gomulka days was matched only by the 
Hungarian intellectuals. But while the latter 
have been suppressed, the Polish intellectuals 
continue, within increasingly narrow confines, 
to militate against the imposition of increas-
ing limits on the freedom of expression. 
8. Closely associated with this group are the 
students who broke from the Communist fold 
in October 1956 and are especially resentful of 
any attempt to force them back into it. The 
inability of the Gomulka regime to create a 
viable successor to the Polish Youth Union, 
which folded up under the impact of the 
events of October 1956, is a striking commen-
tary on the regime's failure to command the 
confidence of Polish youth. Likewise, the 
riots in Warsaw at the beginning of October 
1957, which started as a student protest 
against the suppression of the influential stu-
dent paper Po Prostu, indicated how tenuous 
are the ties of loyalty which bind the students 
to the regime. 
9. In addition to the Gomulka faction, there 
are elements in the Party which aspire to an 
even greater degree of independence from the 
Soviet Union than Gomulka has achieved and 
others which desire a return to sterner and 
more far-reaching Party control over all 
phases of Polish life. The first group ? the 
"revisionists" ? for the most part are intel-
lectuals, while the latter group ? the "dog-
matists" ? for the most part are old-line 
Party workers of long experience. The "revi-
sionists" have no real organizational base but 
find their strength in a communion of ideas 
with the larger group of intellectuals, journal-
ists, and students. The "dogmatists," on the 
other hand, have no popular support, but find 
strength in the cohesion which springs from 
long-term service in and familiarity with the 
Party organization. For a time after the re-
turn of Gomulka they had the added material 
advantage (but popular disadvantage) of 
open Soviet support. 
10. The Roman Catholic Church, although 
not a political organization, is entitled to con-
sideration as the only organized anti-Com-
munist resistance group in the country: its 
ideology and basic objectives are opposed to 
those espoused by the Party and it has broadly 
based popular support and a disciplined, 
trained organization. It is true that the 
modus vivendi of December 7, 1956 formally 
ended a long period of outright political war-
fare and intimidation directed by the Party 
against the Church. The Church has in com-
mon with the Party the aim of defending

Poland's national sovereignty and Poland's 
claim to former German territories now under 
its control. Nonetheless, Church-State rela-
tions have continued to be marked by conflicts 
of interest, though for the most part these 
have been kept within negotiable limits and 
have been threshed out by a joint Church-
government commission which meets regu-
larly. 
11. Armed Forces. The army generally re-
flects the discontent pattern of the population, 
although on a lesser scale. The army's mo-
rale and loyalty to the regime considerably ex-
ceed those of the populace at large, and there 
is no evidence of any focus of anti-regime 
attitudes. On the other hand, there is in the 
Polish armed forces, as in any group of Poles, 
a significant potential for resistance. Under 
present conditions, this potential cannot be 
realized. In the first place, the military lead-
ers are loyal to the regime; secondly, the orig-
inal enthusiasm for Gomulka's "independ-
ence" from the Kremlin has not entirely dis-
sipated. Further, the military rank and file 
are better housed, clothed, and fed than their 
civilian counterparts and are kept busy with 
disciplined activity. Polish troops would prob-
ably obey orders and a civil revolt against the 
present regime could not be expected to re-
ceive much support from the army if such a 
revolt remained localized. If Soviet forces 
sided with Gomulka in quelling any type of 
general hostilities, the army would probably 
not fight in an effective unified manner on 
the side of the Gomulka regime. On the other 
hand, were the Gomulka regime to oppose 
Soviet military forces on any issue, the Polish 
military would side with the regime against 
the Soviets as an effective unified army. 
INTENSITY AND TARGETS OF DISSIDENCE 
12. The high level of dissidence in Poland 
which gave rise to the Poznan riots of June 
1956 and led to Gomulka's return to power in 
October has been considerably reduced by the 
regime's efforts to eliminate some of the prin-
cipal sources of dissatisfaction, and by its 
ability to make common cause with dissident 
elements in appeals to Polish national feel-
ings. In contrast to the pre-Gomulka period, 
when the dissidence of the Polish population 
77 
focused on the Communist regime, the ubiq-
uitous symbols of Soviet oppression, and the 
hated secret police, there are no comparable 
focal points today. However, the poor eco-
nomic conditions will probably persist in the 
foreseeable future and remain a source of 
deep-seated dissatisfaction which may give 
rise to acts of resistance. Unless the regime 
uses increasingly forceful measures of repres-
sion, the intensity of dissidence is not now 
sufficiently high to provide a favorable setting 
for resistance activity. 
13. Given the absence of a broad popular set-
ting for resistance activity in Poland, it is not 
strange that the most effective organized re-
sistance operating there today takes a some-
what different form than that found else-
where in Eastern Europe. The Roman Cath-
olic Church expresses its resistance for the 
most part at the conference table of the joint 
Church-government commission. Its princi-
pal target is the regime, from which it seeks 
constantly to obtain more concessions or 
better performance on concessions already 
granted. In these negotiations the Church 
has consistently played an aggressive role 
while the government has been defending its 
positions. Within the Party, the most syste-
matic organized resistance has been offered 
by the Stalinists ("dogmatists") , who have 
consistently opposed the Gomulka program. 
Their target is Gomulka and their objective 
is to obtain control of the Party in order to 
return to Stalinist policies once again. The 
"revisionists" in the Party are opposed to a 
return to repressive measures characteristic of 
the Stalinist era. Consequently, they oppose 
primarily the Stalinists in the Party but they 
also oppose all evidence of Stalinism which 
they see in the Gomulka program. 
TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
14. The death of Stalin in 1953, the fall of 
Beriya and the reorganization of the Polish 
police system in 1954 signaled the beginning 
of the "thaw." From 1954 to October 1956, 
dissidence became most marked among intel-
lectuals in general and Party intellectuals in 
particular. The regime's rigidity in cultural 
matters and the continued suppression of civil 
liberties became the specific targets of open

SECRET 
criticism. Moreover, the Party's "central ac-
tive," consisting of more than 200 of the most 
active political workers in the Party appa-
ratus, showed signs of dissidence. Growing 
relaxation in Polish life served to increase 
rather than diminish dissidence among intel-
lectuals and Party apparatchiks. The rever-
berations of the 20th Party Congress of the 
CPSU further intensified dissidence within the 
Party, while a decrease of police terror per-
mitted the open manifestation of popular 
opposition to regime policies in the Poznan 
uprisings of June 1956. The extent of dissi-
dence by elements upon which the regime was 
supposedly based paralyzed its power of de-
cision and prepared the ground for the funda-
mental changes within the regime which took 
place in October 1956. 
15. During his first year in power, Gomulka 
succeeded in reducing both the basis for and 
the intensity of dissidence in Poland. He did 
this by: (1) eliminating terror as an instru-
ment of public policy and substantially reduc-
ing the size and authority of the security 
police; (2) reducing the size of the govern-
ment and Party bureaucracy; (3) ceasing 
political warfare against the Church and 
reaching a modus vivendi with it; (4) permit-
ting the decollectivization of agriculture; (5) 
eliminating from political life those personali-
ties like Marshal Rokossovsky who were the 
most glaring symbols of Soviet domination 
and reducing the influence of those Polish 
Communist leaders most subservient to the 
Soviet Union; (6) restoring to public life 
many persons who suffered from Soviet-
imposed tyranny; (7) achieving Soviet recog-
nition of Polish sovereignty and a degree of 
amelioration of Polish grievances; (8) recog-
nizing the bankruptcy of the economic policy 
followed since 1950 and starting to rectify 
past errors. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
(a) Organized 
16. Although the existence of small, isolated 
resistance groups is acknowledged by the re-
gime from time to time, there have been no 
known significant anti-Communist organized 
political resistance groups operating in 
Poland since the death of Stalin. In a number 
of cases such groups appear to be organized by 
people associated with World War II non-
Communist and anti-Communist under-
ground organizations. They are small and 
uncoordinated. While they have an anti-
Communist orientation, their objectives can-
not be precisely defined. Their activities ap-
pear to consist largely of the printing and dis-
tribution of anti-regime propaganda or the 
conducting of campaigns of intimidation di-
rected against specific local Party function-
aries. Many of these organizations appear to 
be on the borderline between organized and 
unorganized resistance and many are proba-
bly no more than just criminal gangs. 
17. Within the Party itself the Stalinist fac-
tion has a sufficient degree of cohesiveness 
and community of purpose to be viewed as an 
organized resistance group in the sense that 
it is opposed to the Gomulka program. The 
revisionist "faction" has no organization, nor 
any clearly defined program, but it acts 
within the Party as a pressure group for fur-
ther liberalization, currently opposing curtail-
ment of liberties already conceded or granted. 
The basic conflict within the Party is not be-
tween these two extremes but rather between 
the Stalinists who favor subservience to the 
USSR and the rest of the Party which favors 
Polish sovereignty. Among the elements 
favoring national sovereignty, the revisionists 
are those least concerned with its realistic 
limits, while the elements surrounding Go-
mulka are most anxious not to exceed them. 
Gornulka's efforts to take this conflict out of 
the limelight ? where it has been since the 
Central Committee's Seventh Plenum (July 
1956) ? first by appeals to Party unity and, 
more recently, by threats of expulsion, have 
so far failed. 
18. Within the ranks of the regime-allied 
United Peasant Party (ZSL) there is a similar 
conflict between those who support the PZPR 
and those who wish the ZSL to pursue an in-
dependent course responsive to peasant 
wishes. It is not clear whether the dissidents 
have enough organizational strength to con-
stitute an organized resistance group. The 
scanty evidence available indicates that they

SECRET 
do control the local organization in some 
localities; but their activity appears to be 
along the lines of unorganized resistance 
which operates to lower the efficiency of the 
ZSL in cooperating with the PZPR. 
(b) Unorganized 
19. There have been some manifestations of 
dissidence since Gomulka assumed power. 
Their significance in terms of resistance po-
tential varies considerably. In most cases, it 
would be difficult to ascribe these disorders as 
indicators of political resistance. For exam-
ple, the widespread existence in Poland of 
alcoholism, "hooliganism," bribery, stealing in 
industrial plants, and other forms of corrup-
tion is for the most part not politically moti-
vated, and it is questionable whether they can 
be regarded as indicators of dissidence even 
though they might unintentionally spark new 
disturbances. Even the riots following the 
suspension of the newspaper Po Prostu in 
early October 1957, though politically moti-
vated, were not an impressive showing of stu-
dent dissidence: only 3-4,000 of the 28,000 
Warsaw students participated the first two 
nights, leaving the field to the police and 
rowdies the following nights. 
20. The relaxation of restrictions on travel to 
the West has given Poles some opportunity to 
engage in unorganized resistance by collect-
ing and transmitting intelligence material or 
by defecting to the West. Defection, with 
subsequent cooperation with foreign intelli-
gence organizations, has been the most com-
mon form of unorganized resistance utilized. 
Polish officials have seized the opportunity to 
defect while abroad on official business; Polish 
seamen and fishermen, air force members, and 
members of civilian flying clubs have utilized 
the opportunities open to them to defect; 
other Poles continue to leave Poland illegally 
by crossing into East Germany and thence in-
to West Berlin; and, finally, slightly over one 
percent of Polish tourists who visited Western 
Europe during 1957 failed to return home. 
21. General relaxation after years of police 
repression has served to increase greatly in-
stances of localized, unorganized, and gener-
79 
ally non-political attacks upon civil authori-
ties. At the same time the marked improve-
ment, mainly political in nature, on the Polish 
scene has decreased the intensity of dissidence 
and has deprived it of clear cut focuses with 
nationwide applicability. The surprising de-
gree of realism recently shown by the Poles in 
judging their country's precarious position 
has served to blunt the stimulus for resist-
ance. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
22. Emigre groups have played no significant 
role in guiding or assisting resistance activi-
ties in Poland. Although some emigre groups 
do encourage defection and resistance, there 
is no evidence by which their efficacy can be 
judged. Even prior to the reinstatement of 
Gomulka there was no known contact be-
tween Polish emigre elements in the West and 
Polish resistance groups in Poland. Moreover, 
then as now, Poles in Poland reportedly feel 
that the majority of emigres are out of touch 
with them and neither know nor represent the 
true sentiment of the Polish people. Events 
since the Poznan uprising probably have rein-
forced this conviction. Even anti-Commu-
nists in Poland are believed to give little sup-
port to the idea of a future government com-
posed of present Polish emigre leaders. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
23. In the pre-Gomulka period the Commu-
nist regime in Poland relied mainly upon the 
use of repression and terror to prevent resist-
ance. Since the advent of Gomulka, the re-
gime has sought to inhibit resistance by elim-
inating or reducing some of the more impor-
tant causes of dissidence and by handling 
grievances in such a way as to avoid provoking 
open political resistance. In handling civil 
disturbances, the regime has used whatever 
firmness has been necessary to maintain its 
authority without employing measures which 
would inflame the population. The security 
apparatus, although reduced in size and influ-
ence and deprived of its resort to terror, still 
functions to inhibit the development of re-
sistance activities. It is estimated at 160,000, 
including the ordinary police, the militarized

SECRET 
security forces, and the military security 
police, as well as 65,000 internal security 
agents. These forces are considered to be 
quite efficient. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
24. The regime has shown that it is capable 
of maintaining its authority in the face of civil 
disturbances uncomplicated by political over-
tones, or in the face of disturbances in which 
political considerations are relatively minor. 
It could probably suppress a revolt if it were 
localized and could be dealt with decisively 
within a few days. Moreover, with the two 
Soviet line divisions in Poland and many more 
posed along the frontiers, Soviet intervention 
may be expected if the regime seemed to be 
unable to cope with a large-scale uprising. 
This very fact, of which most Poles are aware, 
would act as a powerful deterrent so that only 
in extraordinary circumstances, such as can-
not now be foreseen, would large-scale upris-
ings (throughout Poland) be expected. 
MODIFICATION OF SECURITY APPARATUS 
25. A general realignment of security func-
tions started shortly after the period marked 
by Stalin's death, Beriya's execution, and the 
disclosures of Jozef Swiatlo, a former Deputy 
Director of Department X of the defunct Min-
istry of Public Security (MBP) . Since Go-
mulka's return to power, the regime has made 
concessions to popular feelings through addi-
tional changes in organization, personnel, and 
nomenclature within the security apparatus. 
The MBP was dissolved in late 1954. In No-
vember of 1956 its successor, the Committee 
for Public Security (KBP) , was also dissolved 
and its duties of protecting the state from 
espionage and terrorist activities were as-
signed to the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
(MSW) . Departments of the former secret 
police (UB) which had been responsible for 
foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, and 
internal activities, were probably transferred 
to the MSW. Other UB departments were dis-
solved and many former UB employees were 
transferred to training programs designed to 
equip them for work in other fields. Local 
units of the People's Militia were given re-
sponsibility for the few remaining functions 
of the secret police. 
26. The overhauling of the security apparatus 
following the events of October 1956 consid-
erably increased the possibility for the expres-
sion of dissidence. Nevertheless, the arrest in 
1957 of Poles serving as agents for British, 
French, and American intelligence indicates 
that the reformed security apparatus is active 
and efficient in its efforts to ferret out and 
apprehend individuals and groups seeking to 
take advantage of the new situation to engage 
in resistance activities. There is no evidence 
of any change in popular attitudes toward the 
police as a result of the reduction in size and 
authority of that arm of the regime. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
27. So long as the regime continues its 
present policies, the power position of the 
USSR remains essentially unchanged, and the 
Polish-German frontier problem unsettled, the 
development of significant active organized 
resistance in Poland is unlikely. In the ab-
sence of a Stalinist-type of repression, dissi-
dence is more likely to express itself in politi-
cal indifference than in organized resistance. 
Moreover, the regime's current unwillingness 
to engage in open warfare with the Catholic 
Church or with its intra-Party opponents 
makes it likely that the resistance of these 
groups will be conducted on a level that would 
exclude massive retaliation by the regime. 
Thus, under existing circumstances, it seems 
unlikely that there will be any expansion of 
the types of organized resistance activity now 
existing. It also seems unlikely that there 
will be any significant increase in the level of 
resistance activity by organized resistance 
groups ? i.e., the Church and Party faction-
alists ? which are all operating within self-
imposed limits. 
28. The potential for unorganized resistance, 
active or passive, is considerably greater than 
it was prior to the substantial reduction in the 
forces of the security police and the curtail-
ment of their authority. On the other hand, 
the incentives to engage in such resistance 
have been greatly reduced as the result of 
SECRET

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/11 : CIA-RDP79R01012A010700020001-2 
SECRET 81 
Gomulka's reforms and by growing apolitism 
among all elements of the population. Unor-
ganized resistance is not likely to take on new 
forms. Thus, if the regime remains unable to 
improve economic conditions, an increase in 
the level of intensity of unorganized resist-
ance, in the form of strikes, poor work disci-
pline, theft and corruption, and political non-
conformism or apathy might be expected. If 
there were a further tightening of control 
measures, resistance activities would probably 
be impeded, but dissidence would rise. It 
should be noted, however, that current dissi-
dence and the unorganized resistance poten-
tial it represents have circumscribed Go-
mulka's freedom of action in organizing 
Poland to serve Communist ends. The danger 
to the regime inherent in popular dissidence 
has prevented Gomulka from effectively stop-
ping certain unorganized or informally organ-
ized resistance activities, such as strikes, 
demonstrations, passing of intelligence infor-
mation to the West, and overt but discreet 
anti-Communist propaganda in the press and 
by the Church. 
29. The effect of an increase in East-West ten-
sions on resistance would depend on the na-
ture of the tensions and the regime's response 
to them. If the tensions led to the regime's 
acceptance, real or apparent, of a diminution 
of Polish independence and a greater degree of 
Soviet domination, it is likely that resistance 
activities would increase, particularly if com-
bined with an increase of repressive measures 
and a return to pre-Gomulka policies. If, how-
ever, the tensions were of such a nature that 
Poland's national existence would appear to 
depend upon loyalty to the regime, resistance 
activities would decline. A general increase in 
tensions would probably lead to increased ac-
tivity on the part of the security forces, and, 
this, even without the imposition of repressive 
measures against the population as a whole, 
would probably result in a decline in active 
unorganized resistance. A marked decrease 
in tensions, on the other hand, achieved by 
mutual East-West accommodation, would 
probably give the regime greater opportunity 
to introduce more flexibility in its policies and 
afford greater opportunities for individual un-
organized active resistance to the regime. At 
the same time, if a substantial decrease in ten-
sions were accompanied by increasing trade 
opportunities and greater ease in obtaining 
foreign credits, it could enable the regime to 
offer the population some material benefits to 
sustain their hopes for a better future. All 
these factors would serve to reduce dissidence 
and resistance. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
30. The anti-regime resistance potential in 
Poland in time of war would depend upon the 
nature of the war. Polish involvement in a 
war on the side of the Soviet Union against 
the West would be unpopular and would raise 
the level of dissidence, especially if the Soviet 
Union commenced hostilities and if Polish in-
terests were not directly involved in the con-
flict. However, if hostilities were not begun 
by the Soviet Union or if the war seemed to 
threaten Poland's independence, sovereignty, 
or territorial integrity, the level of dissidence 
would in all likelihood decrease, if not cease 
altogether. The inclusion of a large number 
of German troops in invading forces would 
help the regime in that it could reduce dissi-
dence and rally support by equating the Ger-
man forces with Hitler's armies. 
31. At the inception of hostilities between 
Bloc and non-Bloc states, the regime would 
intensify its security controls, but anti-Com-
munists would probably still be able to com-
mit acts of sabotage. Later, if the USSR were 
suffering reverses, Polish guerrillas would tie 
down some Bloc troops, destroy supply dumps, 
disrupt lines of communications, and sabo-
tage industrial and agricultural output. Ef-
forts would also be made to assist the enemy 
in evasion and escape activities, and to collect 
intelligence which would be useful to non-
Bloc planners. Without outside encourage-
ment, guidance, and material support, how-
ever, they would constitute only a relatively 
minor nuisance to the regime. 
32. Chances for organized anti-regime resist-
ance would appear to be particularly favorable 
if military developments indicated the immi-
nent collapse of Soviet power and the oppor-
tunity were offered for real Polish independ-
ence. Under those circumstances, organized 
resistance might consist of independent, local-

SECRET 
ized attempts to dislodge local Communist 
authorities. Efforts of this type would most 
likely be made first in villages and country 
towns where the authority of the Party is 
weakest, and in former German territories 
where Western forces might be looked upon as 
liberators by the indigenous population. 
Whether such resistance activities would lead 
to the appearance of a genuine liberation 
movement or whether they would merely re-
sult in the total breakdown of law and order 
would depend upon the circumstances at the 
time. Organized, centrally directed resist-
ance involving military action along the lines 
of World War II's Armia Krajowa (AK) is 
hardly conceivable unless it were preceded by 
a complete breakdown of Polish authority and 
a Soviet occupation. Although the actual for-
mation of a centrally directed resistance ac-
tion would seem to be possible only under 
special circumstances, the tradition of the AK 
would probably continue to be strong in Polish 
minds. However, various forms of unorgan-
ized active or passive resistance would appear 
to be more likely than organized resistance. 
Given factors creating a high level of dissi-
dence, a considerable amount of assistance to 
the West might be expected in the production 
and distribution of anti-regime propaganda, 
the harassment of some especially obnoxious 
local regime officials, help in evasion and 
escape operations and, to a lesser degree, in 
intelligence collection. 
33. The Poles are sufficiently sophisticated 
militarily and politically to accept the use of 
nuclear weapons in future warfare as an in-
evitable reality. If Poland were involved in a 
nuclear attack, the people's first reaction 
would be determined self-preservation. If use 
were made of major nuclear weapons, the re-
sulting mass destruction and dislocation 
would virtually eliminate any effective forms 
of resistance activity. On the other hand, if 
a nuclear attack were so designed as to elim-
inate the major resources of military and 
political control strengths, such an attack 
would probably be accepted as an unavoidable 
cost of liberation, would not necessarily de-
stroy the will to resist, and could present anti-
Communist Poles with an opportunity to take 
over control of the country., 
34. Occupation policies of Western forces 
would not be a crucial factor affecting resist-
ance potential and capabilities so long as 
these policies were pronounced and imple-
mented to respect and aid in the accomplish-
ment of Polish aspirations for freedom, na-
tional independence, and the end of Soviet 
domination. Such enlightened occupation 
would intensify the Polish desire to be helpful 
and stimulate resistance activities in areas of 
the country still under Communist control. 
35. Fear of Germany has traditionally played 
an important role in determining the atti-
tudes of the Polish people. The Poles thus 
would be extremely apprehensive over the use 
of German forces in Polish territory, as well 
as over postwar territorial adjustments vis-a-
vis Germany, and this factor might have a sig-
nificant negative effect on the anti-Soviet re-
sistance effort. However, this effect cannot be 
usefully measured at this time since it would 
depend on such presently unknown factors as 
the nature and degree of the German involve-
ment, the announced war aims of the Western 
powers with respect to territorial settlements, 
and the over-all military situation. Other-
wise, the nationality of attacking Free World 
forces would probably not influence the 
willingness of resistance groups to act, nor 
would the responsibility for initiation of hos-
tilities greatly affect resistance potential. 
The representative of the Assistant Chief of 
Staff, Intelligence, Army, would substitute the 
following: 
"The Poles are sufficiently sophisticated mili-
tarily and politically so that they accept the 
use of nuclear weapons in future warfare as an 
inevitable reality. If Poland were involved in a 
nuclear attack, the people's first reaction would 
be determined self-preservation. As coordinated 
groups were developed, they probably would take 
all possible steps to strengthen their native 
government and to eliminate any Stalinist or 
authoritarian remnants. Conditioned by their 
bitter experience in the 1944 Warsaw uprising 
and the immediate postwar resistance period, 
however, the Poles probably would not attempt 
to initiate independent anti-Soviet military ac-
tion until their forces had received substantial 
commitments (in terms of materiel and person-
nel as well as political support) from the West. 
The extent of their assistance in these circum-
stances probably would be dependent on the 
amount of damage suffered in the nuclear strike."

ANNEX J - RUMANIA 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. A basic cause underlying popular discon-
tent in Rumania is the failure of the regime 
to improve the people's economic well being. 
Soviet economic exploitation in the postwar 
period, nationalization of industries, the de-
struction of private trade, economic regimen-
tation, and inefficiency of the state economic 
enterprises have reduced large sections of Ru-
mania to a low level of subsistence. The peo-
ple, including workmen in supposedly pros-
perous towns, give every appearance of ex-
treme poverty and gloom. A large part of 
the peasantry is dressed in rags. The popula-
tion ascribes the shortages, particularly of 
food and fuel which before and even during 
World War II were in abundance, to exports 
required to meet obligations imposed by the 
Soviet Union and to poor planning by the 
government. Knowledge that food and fuel 
shortages in a country rich in oil, forests, and 
agriculture are due to government policy has 
further increased the people's resentment of 
both the regime and the Soviet Union. 
2. The basic political factors in the anti-
regime feelings of the Rumanians stem from 
their historical enmity toward Russia and 
Communism, their non-Slavic, traditionally 
Western orientation, and their disapproval of 
a governmental policy which seems counter to 
Rumanian aims of national independence, ter-
ritorial integrity, and continuance of Western-
oriented culture. Rumanians have not for-
gotten that the USSR, after World War II, re-
annexed Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia, 
drove out the King, and delegated power to a 
puppet regime under absolute Soviet control. 
Regarding their country as a virtual Soviet 
colony, Rumanians have almost certainly 
identified Communism with their traditional 
fear of Russia. Moreover, individual liberties 
have been completely suppressed; the tradi-
tional family patterns have been destroyed; 
and village life, around which most social and 
political activities evolved in the past, has now 
been placed under the control of local Com-
munist functionaries whose chief task is not 
to serve the villagers but to carry out the un-
popular program and policies of the regime. 
However, despite the strong anti-Communist 
feeling of the vast majority of the Rumanian 
people, they do not possess an active revolu-
tionary tradition and are generally apathetic 
in the face of adversity. 
3. The Rumanians have always been a devout 
people, considering religious institutions as 
playing a major role in their lives. The spir-
itual needs of the people were satisfied by a 
large number of churches and monasteries. 
The various religious organizations functioned 
primarily for the benefit of their followers 
rather than of any special political or racial 
groupings, and their secular activities were 
generally incidental to the fulfillment of their 
spiritual aims. Therefore, the transformation 
in 1947-48 by the Communist regime of reli-
gious organizations into instruments of sup-
port for its program was a great blow to the 
population. Subsequent measures, such as 
the complete destruction of the Uniate 
Church, and the reduction to virtual inactiv-
ity of the Roman Catholic Church by arrest-
ing nearly all its leading clergy, had a de-
pressing effect on the people. 
4. Prior to the advent of the Communist re-
gime in 1945, Rumanian education and cul-
ture were oriented wholly toward the West. 
Speaking a predominantly Romance language 
and considering themselves modern repre-
sentatives of Latin civilization, the Ruma-
nians looked to the Western countries, partic-

with Rumanian, was until the end of World 
War II compulsory in the Rumanian schools.

French Government or by private and reli-
gious institutions from France, were regarded 
as the best in the country. However, by 1948 
the Rumanian Government had closed all 
French and other Western-operated schools 
and had taken stringent measures to elim-
iate Western culture from the country, sub-
stituting Soviet influences in their place. 
Through various measures the regime has 
transformed educational institutions into in-
doctrination centers, designed to eliminate 
Western cultural patterns and to suppress 
freedom of thought and expressions. 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
5. Peasants. Of all the groups in Rumania, 
the peasants, who compose over two-thirds of 
the country's population, constitute the great-
est resistence potential. They have opposed 
the regime's agricultural policies, not only by 
widespread passive resistance, but on many 
occasions by hostile action as well. The bulk 
of the peasantry cannot reconcile its own in-
terests with those of the regime and continues 
stubbornly to oppose the latter's agricultural 
policy. The traditional attachment of the 
peasant to the land, his deep-seated ambition 
to become a landowner and exercise a right 
which he regards as inalienable, his resent-
ment over disruption of his simple way of life, 
and his traditional refusal to become organ-
ized are in opposition to the entire agricul-
tural policy of the Communists. The peasant 
has been difficult to discipline, and he has 
often openly protested against policies de-
signed to regiment him. The various non-
collectivized rural groups, are suffering most 
at the hand of the regime. The collectivized 
peasants, who have been drawn into a tight 
controlled network, would run great risks in 
active resistance; they can, however, resist 
passively with relatively little danger of detec-
tion by the bureaucratic maze of collective 
administration. 
6. Industrial Workers. In spite of the re-
gime's past policy of favoring industry over 
agriculture, the industrial worker has not 
benefited much. In many ways his situation 
is inferior to that of the peasant who can at 
least evade deliveries to some extent and who 
has a local food and fuel supply. The indus-
trial worker suffers from a depressed standard 
of living, poor housing, food shortages, and a 
fear of possible unemployment. He is forced 
to work hard for low wages, often under primi-
tive conditions. Most workers are probably 
aware of the fact that the products of their 
labor are often destined for shipment to the 
Soviet Union. Consequently even those who 
initially supported the Communist regime 
have become disillusioned. Worker dissatis-
faction is manifested in reluctance to join the 
Party. The Communists in theory derive 
their chief support from the working class, 
but the Rumanian Worker's Party has had 
little success in improving its "social composi-
tion" by recruiting factory labor. The great-
est discontent is to be found among the work-
ers of the state railroad system; at one time 
these were the staunchest supporters of the 
Communists, furnishing the Party with such 
top leaders as Gheorghiu-Dej and Gheorghe 
Apostol, who were among the instigators of a 
bloody railroad strike in 1933. 
7. Youth. Rumanian youth, particularly the 
77,000 students of higher schools, are among 
the most outspoken opponents of the regime. 
Family tradition and the individualistic tend-
encies of youth have encouraged opposition 
to the regimentation enforced by Commu-
nist group control. Several important 
events ? the 1953 Bucharest Youth Festival, 
the 1956 Polish uprising and the Hungarian 
revolt ? have stirred young people to express 
open discontent, particularly the ethnic Hun-
garians. Their demonstrations against Com-
munism in general and Marxist-Leninist in-
struction in particular brought comment even 
from Khrushchev. A number have defected 
from groups traveling abroad even though 
their political reliability had been strictly 
checked by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
The Party and its youth organization (Union 
of Working Youth) are seriously concerned 
over the continued interest of students in all 
things Western, and there is much criticism 
of youth in both agriculture and industry for 
absenteeism, thievery, immorality, laziness 
and failure to work toward the aims of the 
regime and the Communist ideology.

SECRET 85 
8. Military. Soviet authorities have become 
increasingly careful, in the past several years, 
to refrain from flaunting their military forces 
and advisors in Rumania. Although some 
Rumanian soldiers may resent their presence 
and authority, it is probable that professional 
military personnel are not averse to accepting 
the modern weapons and equipment being 
supplied by the Soviets, even though they 
hardly believe the Communist-nourished 
legend of the historical bond between Rus-
sians and Rumanians. Although Air Force 
personnel are presumably more carefully 
screened for political reliability than are 
Army personnel, dissident elements apparent-
ly still persist. Most military deserters have 
been Air Force officers, and these have re-
ported general discontent in their service 
branch. There seems to be little dissidence in 
the Army's permanent cadre, which includes 
approximately 25,000 well-indoctrinated offi-
cers. Somewhat more dissatisfaction proba-
bly exists among noncommissioned officers 
and those enlisted men who are held over for 
an extra year of service. The two conscript 
classes of about 80,000 men each, largely de-
riving from the rural areas, are on the whole 
more disaffected than the rest of the Army, 
although the most obviously unreliable indi-
viduals in each age class are not taken into 
the Army. 
9. Among the forces of the Ministry of In-
ternal Affairs, the state security police con-
tain the most fanatical supporters of the re-
gime. Personnel of other branches, such as 
the border guards, are for the most part not 
ardent Communists and are not devoted to 
the regime. Most of the members of these 
formations are conscripts and many of them, 
despite screening, share the anti-Communist 
feelings of the general population. Morale 
among the border guards is low. In the police 
force, attitudes ranging from tolerance of 
known anti-Communists to positive acts of 
disloyalty have been responsible for a series 
of purges. Nevertheless, while on the whole 
the loyalty of Rumanian armed forces is 
questionable, there has been no evidence of 
actual resistance within the Rumanian Army 
or the militarized security forces. Morale and 
discipline are not high. Apart from political 
resentment of Soviet control, Rumanians are 
not militaristically inclined and they gener-
ally dislike the service as such. 
10. Minorities. Ethnically Rumania is the 
most heterogeneous of the countries in the 
Satellite area, with minorities comprising 15 
percent of the population. Groups of Hun-
garians, Germans, Jews, and others, who for 
the most part form sizeable islands within 
Rumania, look to other countries for political 
and cultural inspiration, thus constituting a 
potential fifth column. In its desire to inte-
grate these minorities, the regime has contrib-
uted to their discontent by attempting to wipe 
out their distinctive cultures and by using 
minority institutions and languages as vehi-
cles for the propagation of Communism. 
These minorities have probably become 
stronger in their ethnic group loyalty as a 
result of such inroads and of the anti-Com-
munist attitudes manifested by their parent 
nationalities in West Germany, Hungary, and 
Israel. 
11. Intellectuals. Rumanian intellectuals, 
particularly men of letters, have been restive 
under the Communist ideological yoke, but 
the Party has successfully stifled any open 
expression of opposition. The only major 
demonstration of open resistance to Party 
pressure ? in May 1956 when latent discon-
tent finally erupted at a series of writers' 
and Party meetings ? was immediately sup-
pressed. The intellectuals realize that they 
have little future unless they support the 
Communists or appear to do so. The lack of 
opportunity for advancement and creative 
freedom has motivated a number of engineers, 
professional men, artists, and dancers to de-
fect on their visits to countries outside the 
Soviet Bloc. Other intellectuals, valuing pres-
tige and material benefits, have accommo-
dated themselves to the regime and have 
achieved leading positions, but for the most 
part they secretly harbor intense disaffection. 
12. To a large extent, members of the govern-
ment administration, factory officials, teach-
ers, and engineers, who comprise the upper 
middle class, still retain a Western outlook. 
They are oppose.d to Communism but con-
tinue to work for the government in order to

86 SECRET 
exist. They pay lip service to the Party, even 
though they would prefer a liberal govern-
ment and a renewal of contacts with the 
Western world. As in the past, they have 
been able to adapt themselves to political 
upheavals and internal changes. In view of 
the small size of the Party when it came to 
power in Rumania, the Communists have had 
to employ many non-Communist opportunists 
in positions of importance. Despite their 
high rank, officials holding technical positions 
in the state administration and economic en-
terprises, have little voice in policy and, for 
the present at least, are in no position to 
change the course of events in the country. 
13. Religious Groups. The various religious 
organizations in Rumania do not at present 
engage in resistance but have been forced to 
cooperate with the regime in order to survive. 
Because of Rumania's history of foreign dom-
ination, many of the churches long ago 
adopted an attitude of accommodation to the 
civil authority in order to ensure the con-
tinuation of their activities. Religious faith 
in the country, however, is more vital than 
in the past. Churches of all denominations 
are heavily attended, and religious enthusiasm 
is markedly greater than before World War 
II, constituting a form of protest against the 
regime. People of all ages attend services, 
including even young men in military uni-
form. ? 
14. Rumanian Workers' Party. The Ruma-
nian Workers' (Communist) Party probably 
has a relatively small percentage of convinced 
Communists among its members. Only those 
working as professionals in the Party ap-
paratus and a small number of workers in 
special categories are sincerely attached to 
the Party and to the regime. Despite the 
purge of nearly 200,000 members in 1949-50 
and the expulsion of an equal number in 
1950-55, the Party (total membership today 
is about 600,000, including both regular and 
candidate members) still contains a large 
proportion of opportunists who are interested 
only in personal profit and advancement or 
even mere subsistence. Nevertheless, the large 
percentage of opportunists in its midst in no 
way endangers the Party's stability at the 
present time. The expulsions of the past 
years have even served in some measure to 
increase unity. There are no signs of nation-
al deviationism among the top leaders and 
the extent of factional maneuvering in the 
Politburo is not serious. Party chief Gheor-
ghiu-Dej has maintained his position and 
influence through the period of Communist 
rule, and since the purge of top leaders Ana 
Pauker, Vasile Luca, and Teohari Georgescu 
in 1952 no one of sufficient stature or influence 
remains to endanger his position. A purge 
of the intellectual faction of the Politburo 
in July 1957 in no way affected the status of 
Gheorghiu-Dej. 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
15. Of all the disaffected groups and classes 
in Rumania the peasantry is the most im-
portant. The Hungarian minority is poten-
tially as dangerous to the regime, as are 
the students and intellectuals. Other groups 
with a subversive potential are the industrial 
workers, lower governmental officials and the 
"class enemies," that is, private tradesmen, 
former members of the professions, large land-
owners and industrialists. Together these 
comprise some 90 percent of Rumania's total 
population of 17.6 million. The regime has 
been able to limit their ability to resist, but it 
has failed to win their cooperation, and their 
passive resistance has been effective in re-
tarding achievement of the domestic objec-
tives of the government. The Rumanians 
possess a native facility for passive resistance. 
They have not been misled by the intense 
propaganda of the regime, and have shown 
themselves particularly adept at bribery, 
graft, and black marketing in accommodating 
themselves to conditions created by the Com-
munists. The intensive hatred of the Soviet 
and of the native Communist regime is such 
that under certain circumstances, such as a 
breakdown of internal security, open strife 
within the top leadership, or general revolts 
and disorders in the other satellites, a setting 
for actual resistance activity could be created, 
provided the risk did not appear too great. 
16. The vast majority of the Rumanian peo-
ple tend to hold both the Russians and the 
native regime responsible for their present 
plight. The most intense hatred is directed

SECRET 87 
against the former, since Soviet influence 
and control of every facet of life are more 
complete and immediate than anything expe-
rienced before. The presence of Soviet armed 
forces in the country has served as an addi-
tional irritant. 
TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
17. In the past several years, there has been 
a noticeable decrease in the number of iso-
lated guerrilla actions in Rumania, owing 
chiefly to attrition, to the increased efficiency 
of the security forces, and to the disinclination 
of the country's rulers after Stalin's death to 
relax the stringent Stalinist controls. There 
are no known resistance groups in Rumania 
today, but partisan activity throughout the 
whole chain of the Carpathian Mountains con-
tinues to be reported. Some of the groups re-
ferred to as resistance elements are probably 
nothing more than roving bandit groups, com-
posed of escaped criminals and lawless ele-
ments of the population. There are persistent 
reports, sometimes admitted by the regime, 
that security police and militia have been de-
ployed against "terrorist bands" throughout 
the mountainous regions of Rumania. Other 
reports indicate that in some instances So-
viet units in the area have been called upon 
for assistance. Nevertheless, there is evidence 
that partisan activity has been virtually 
wiped out during the past two years. 
18. There has, however, been no noticeable 
decrease of unorganized and passive resistance 
expressed in the form of economic sabotage, 
occasional strikes, local disturbances, passive 
resistance against grain deliveries and general 
demands that the government provide im-
proved living conditions. To some extent, the 
intellectual unrest of satellite neighbors has 
affected the Rumanian intelligentsia but 
never to the same degree as in Poland or even 
East Germany. 
19. There is evidence that Stalin's denigra-
tion engendered widespread confusion in the 
higher ranks of the Rumanian Party, includ-
ing the Politburo. But First Secretary Ghe-
orghiu-Dej and his close followers have from 
time to time intimidated individual Party 
functionaries, thus checking any effective re-
sistance to the leadership. 
20. The failure of the Hungarian revolt con-
tinues to have a depressing influence on large 
segments of the Rumanian people. The feel-
ing seems to have been created that the Com-
munist regime is there to stay and that a 
fate similar to that of the Hungarians would 
befall Rumanians if they revolted. The peo-
ple's hope for liberation seems to be at the 
lowest ebb. It is not, however, completely 
extinguished, as 'continued passive resistance 
demonstrates. Students continue passive re-
sistance through such means as displaying 
intense interest in things Western and pre-
ferring Western to Eastern or even native 
writers. Students and intellectuals devoted 
considerable attention to the theories of Chi-
nese Communist leader Mao Tse-tung, but 
probably no longer regard him as a mentor 
in the quest for a greater measure of auton-
omy. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
21. Active resistance since Stalin's death has 
been confined to a few isolated cases of work-
ers demonstrations for higher wages and bet-
ter living conditions and to student manifesta-
tions in several universities during the Hun-
garian revolt. The general pattern of these 
manifestations was uniform: inspired by news 
from Hungary, students demanded economic 
improvements and abolition or reduction of 
compulsory courses in Russian and Marxism-
Leninism. When more basic anti-regime feel-
ings were revealed in meetings between stu-
dents and university Party officials, troops and 
police were summoned and some youths were 
arrested and subsequently tried. Isolated ex-
amples of tension among workers at this time 
were also evident. There appears to have been 
unrest among railroad workers in Bucharest, 
who reportedly passed a resolution of sym-
pathy for the Hungarian workers. 
22. In recent years less and less has been 
heard of guerrilla activities even in the most 
inaccessible areas of the country, although 
elements of the former National Peasant 
Party and Iron Guard may still exist. Re-
sistance activities are now largely limited to 
disorganized, small-scale, virtually futile acts 
of sabotage and other minor activities by in-
dividuals driven to desperation. As in the

SECRET 
past, such open resistance activity could only 
take place in the Carpathian and Transylvan-
ian ranges, which furnish the protection of 
rough terrain and which border on the areas 
inhabited by German and Hungarian minor-
ities, largely peasants, who have in the past 
aided guerrilla bands. In the postwar period 
isolated guerrilla bands have been active 
chiefly in the Brasov-Zarnesti section, the 
Fagaras range, the Dorbruja wasteland along 
the Black Sea coast and the nearby Danube 
Delta swamps, the Bristita-Nasaud section, 
and the Bihor Mountains. 
23. In the field of passive resistance, which 
is well suited to the Rumanian character, the 
people continue to take advantage of many 
opportunities. Their lack of discipline has 
been intensified; they have shown their dis-
satisfaction by abenteeism, sloppiness and low 
productivity. Efforts by the regime to rem-
edy these conditions are often counteracted 
through bribery of willing officials (an ancient 
Rumanian pastime) and by padding the re-
ports of hours worked. Thus ingrained Ruma-
nian inefficiency is compounded by deliberate 
carelessness or pretended ignorance. Per-
sistent offenders cannot all be jailed; they are 
usually punished only by loss of salary on the 
basis of nonfulfillment of norms. Further-
more, there are indications that Western in-
formation media such as VOA, BBC and the 
French and West German radio stations con-
tinue to be popular and to exert considerable 
influence in keeping alive the hope for even-
tual liberation. The people are reported to 
have relied on Western information on the 
rebellions in Poland and Hungary and on 
official US statements, sometimes meeting 
clandestinely to discuss the contents of West-
ern broadcasts. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
24. Since the Communist regime came into 
power there have been three principal emigre 
groups which have claimed to represent the 
interests of the Rumanian people and to offer 
guidance and assistance to organized and un-
organized resistance within the country. The 
tangible results of these groups especially dur-
ing the past several years have been negligible 
or non-existent. Factional strife within the 
groups has completely vitiated them as a 
rallying point for any kind of resistance ac-
tivities inside the country. 
25. The Rumanian National Committee, 
which has the official blessing of former King 
Michael, is reduced to the role of maintaining 
liaison with other emigre groups, and of serv-
ing as a waning symbol of royalist Rumania 
and as a potential channel for Western sup-
port. The League of Free Rumanians, a 
splinter group of the Rumanian National 
Committee, maintains offices in many of the 
Western countries and also liaison with other 
emigre groups. The other major political exile 
group interested in promoting internal resist-
ance is the militant Legionnaire, or Iron 
Guard, group. It has a long history of vio-
lence and clandestine activity within Ruma-
nia and stands compromised in the eyes of 
most Rumanians at home for its fascist, anti-
parliamentarian, and anti-Semitic position. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
26. The regime's measures to frustrate any 
attempts by resistance groups to threaten its 
stability have been helped by a number of fac-
tors which are typical of the Rumanian scene: 
lack of traditional revolutionary spirit; lack 
of potential leadership which could organize 
effective opposition; general popular fear of 
police terror; habits and attitudes ingrained 
under foreign domination for centuries; and 
reliance on foreign powers for liberation. 
Moreover, the people realize that the regime 
has at its disposal strong police and security 
forces and the support of Soviet troops and 
that it will not hesitate to take prompt and 
effective measures against Party and non-
Party individuals who show the slightest sign 
of deviation or rebellion. 
27. Following the Hungarian revolution, the 
Rumanian regime adopted a fluctuating pol-
icy of appeasement and enforced controls. 
However, since the shake-up of the govern-
ment hierarchy in July 1957, it has become 
apparent that the regime's agitation and 
propaganda agencies have increased their 
manipulation of group and individual fears 
and aspirations in order to keep the public

SECRET 89 
firmly under control. The objective of the 
regime appears to be to organize workers, 
peasants, intellectuals and students into re-
sponsible, disciplined groups and to encour-
age the public to believe not only that the 
regime will endure but that the Western coun-
tries regard it as established and respectable. 
28. The regime has passed new laws which 
make certain crimes, considered minor in the 
past (such as hooliganism, indecency, ped-
dling without a license, short weight, pilfer-
age in government) , punishable with prison 
terms rather than fines. New labor camps 
have been set up, and it is believed in Ruma-
nia that individuals are being sentenced to 
these camps for one to three years. Uncon-
firmed reports indicate that in the provinces 
violators are sometimes arrested and judged 
by security organs rather than by the regular 
police and courts; many have been tried, sen-
tenced and transported to prison within sev-
eral days. On the other hand, concessions 
have been made to alleviate such basic eco-
nomic grievances as starvation wages, unreal-
istic agricultural quotas and industrial norms. 
These have included raising of minimum 
wages, modifying delivery quotas, increasing 
children's bonuses and old age pensions. The 
morale of the Rumanian people is at a low 
ebb as a result of police arrests, higher food 
costs and persistent alarmist rumors. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
29. The Rumanian security apparatus under 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs has an over-
all strength of 156,000, made up of the follow-
ing components: State Security Police (uni-
formed and plainclothes) , 43,000; Frontier 
Guard, 35,000; and Militia (including Fire-
men) , 78,000. This apparatus is believed ade-
quate to maintain the present regime in power 
and it will almost certainly continue to be 
capable of coping with any small scale anti-
regime activity. However, it probably would 
not be able to deal with an uprising such as 
occurred in Hungary without the assistance 
of Soviet troops. The presence of two Soviet 
line divisions, which could be reinforced on 
short order, and the memory of the Soviet 
repression of the Hungarian revolt will be 
major factors enabling the Communist regime 
to maintain its hold on the country. With 
the exception of those higher officers who are 
good Communists, and have survived the 
purges, the reliability of the Rumanian Army 
(some 215,000 men) in case of uprisings is 
questionable. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
30. Under present circumstances no level of 
resistance potential in Rumania has the capa-
bility of developing into successful organized 
resistance. The regime and the Soviet forces 
in that country are capable of taking the 
severest countermeasures against any attempt 
to establish organized resistance. However, a 
number of internal and external develop-
ments could increase the level of the current 
unorganized resistance and dissidence. In-
ternally, the continuing economic depriva-
tions and the acceleration of agricultural col-
lectivization could increase the discontent of 
the workers and peasants. Also, any signs of 
friction within the top Party and government 
hierarchy or of relaxation of police controls 
would encourage certain segments of the pop-
ulation to become more vocal against the re-
gime. Externally, disturbances in the other 
orthodox satellites or political and economic 
successes in Poland and Yugoslavia could have 
a telling effect on some groups in Rumania, 
especially students and intellectuals. 
31. From the 1955 Summit conference to the 
Hungarian revolt, it was evident in Rumania 
that the lessening of East-West tensions had 
adversely affected anti-regime resistance. 
Conversely, with the increase of these tensions 
after the Hungarian revolt, unrest increased 
considerably, including open demonstrations 
by students and by some workers and wide-
spread confusion within the Party. There is 
also evidence that many Rumanian Party and 
government officials sympathized with the 
Hungarian revolutionaries and that the revolt 
had produced deep confusion in the Party. 
While the purge of Chisinevschi and Constan-
tinescu in July 1957 did not affect the basic 
stability of the regime, it did create some un-
certainty and confusion within the Party 
ranks. Additional ideological disputes in Ru-

SECRET 
mania and elsewhere in the orbit could be 
expected to increase confusion and uncer-
tainty within the Party and to encourage the 
resistance of the more vocal anti-regime ele-
ments, such as students, but in view of the 
general apathy of the Rumanian people in 
general, no build-up of popular demands 
which might result in widespread revolt is to 
be expected. 
32. Only a further deterioration of the al-
ready bad economic conditions, combined 
with a relaxation of security controls, could 
spark spontaneous unrest. Since such a re-
laxation can hardly be expected, Rumanians 
will continue to be prevented from openly dis-
playing their dissidence. Thus their discon-
tent can only take the form of active or pas-
sive clandestine opposition, ranging from acts 
of sabotage to listening to foreign broadcasts, 
from assaults on individual policemen or sol-
diers to the voicing of popular grievances and 
from minor strikes to slow-downs in produc-
tion. At best, such activities will retard the 
implementation of the regime's political and 
economic programs; at the least, they will 
have a nuisance value. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
33. At the inception of war between Bloc and 
non-Bloc countries (local or general) the re-
gime would impose more stringent security 
controls which would preclude anti-regime 
resistance activities. If the struggle became 
so intense that the Bloc nations had to divert 
their security forces to other tasks, or if West-
ern forces were within the country and ap-
peared to be winning, many Rumanians would 
engage in espionage, sabotage, and other 
harassing activities against the Communists. 
However, it would be almost impossible for 
anti-regime elements to undertake military 
action. Rumania's geographical location ad-
joining the USSR, in addition to the national 
character and temperament of the people ? a 
lack of spirit to resist and the fear of reprisals 
and further loss of their limited free-
dom ? would tend to restrict any independent 
action. The topography of the country, how-
ever, would lend itself to guerrilla fighting, 
and small bands of partisans could retard the 
advance of Bloc forces by sabotage of lines of 
communications and industrial plants. How-
ever, widespread, effective military action 
could be undertaken only if substantial ele-
ments of the armed forces defected and took 
to the mountains. In such an event, peasants 
could be expected not only to assist the 
fighting forces but also to augment their num-
bers considerably. Outside support, especially 
in war materiel, would be needed by the fight-
ing groups in order to continue active for any 
length of time. Nevertheless, small guerrilla 
bands could manage to operate over an indefi-
nite period in sabotage and harassment. 
34. Possibilities exist in Rumania for substan-
tial assistance to Western military forces in 
both the military and political fields, were 
they to invade that country. Desertion to the 
West of large segments of the Rumanian 
armed forces would in all probability occur, 
particularly if Western invading forces were 
initially successful; the anti-Communist pop-
ulation could also be expected to engage in 
economic sabotage and other harassing ac-
tions. Resistance elements in Rumania could 
facilitate the infiltration of agents by the 
West for intelligence collection and other 
operational activities. Successful escape and 
evasion of Western personnel in Rumania are 
possible but would depend largely on the for-
tunes and area of the war. The fortunes of 
war could affect the degree of resistance, al-
though most Rumanians could be expected to 
resist Soviet forces. 
35. The Rumanians probably would make 
some distinction in the nationality of the 
Western forces. Their past political and cul-
tural ties with France and Italy might make 
these countries more acceptable as allies, and, 
in turn, increase the Rumanians' will to resist. 
The attitude of Yugoslavia, Turkey, and 
Greece would have a definite effect on Ruma-
nian resistance potential. If these countries 
joined in the conflict at its beginning, the 
Rumanian resistance groups would be encour-
aged to take a more active part. A consider-
able number of military units could be ex-
pected to desert to Yugoslavia. Also, resist-
ance to Soviet forces in neighboring Bloc 
countries would encourage opposition to those 
forces in Rumania.

36. Although the people of Rumania would 
not approve the use of nuclear weapons on 
targets in Rumania, Western employment of 
nuclear weapons in that country could have a 
very significant psychological effect on the 
people and could influence their attitudes to-
ward the attacking forces. Attacks on urban 
areas resulting in heavy civilian casualties 
would prejudice most Rumanians against the 
West. Such adverse reactions might be re-
duced if nuclear attacks were limited to areas 
important to the Soviet war effort and were 
accompanied by a coordinated political war-
91 
fare campaign. If nuclear attacks were made 
primarily on military targets isolated from 
larger populated areas, the will to resist might 
be increased since such attacks could diffuse 
and lessen the control strengths of the regime. 
37. The Rumanians have a long history of 
accepting foreign domination. Therefore, it is 
almost certain that they will continue to en-
dure virtually any type of occupation. Re-
pressive occupation policies would undoubt-
edly decrease their will to resist but would, on 
the whole, have little effect on their low resist-
ance potential.

ANNEX K -USSR 
PREAMBLE 
1. Although dissatisfaction with various as-
pects of the Soviet system is widespread, the 
gulf between such dissidence and resist-
ance, except among certain national minori-
ties, is greater in the USSR than in any other 
Bloc state. Such dissidence as exists in the 
USSR does not necessarily indicate opposition 
to Communist ideology or the Soviet system. 
It is rather a manifestation of discontent over 
the neglect or denial by the regime of popular 
needs or desires. Since the death of Stalin, 
dissidence in the Soviet Union appears to have 
decreased, except in some of the recently an-
nexed areas. There has been grumbling and 
criticism, particularly following the 20th 
CPSU Congress in early 1956. But, on the 
whole, most of this criticism is not "counter-
revolutionary" nor does it seem to envisage 
the overthrow of the Soviet state. On the 
contrary, there has unquestionably developed 
during the past four decades a widespread 
identification with the Soviet national state 
and many of its institutional features and 
the people have come to identify the Soviet 
state with the Marxist-Leninist ideology 
which has shaped its character. Moreover, 
the successes of the USSR during and after 
World War II, and particularly the security 
reforms, economic improvements and tech-
nological achievements since 1953, have en-
gendered a pride in the Soviet state and have 
almost certainly strengthened the loyalty of 
the population toward the regime, again ex-
cepting the recently acquired Western terri-
tories. Generally, Soviet citizens appear to 
feel that their lot has improved and is going 
to improve further. Therefore many of them, 
especially the hard-core followers of the Com-
munist gospel, are probably quite willing to 
accept privations in the name of Soviet patri-
otism. Such are the premises for an examina-
tion of dissidence in the USSR. They do not 
rule out the existence of a resistance potential 
but they obviously put it on a level that dif-
fers considerably from that of the other Sino-
Soviet Bloc countries. 
BASIC FACTORS ,OF DISSIDENCE 
2. The people of the USSR have had to endure 
extraordinary hardships for many years. Im-
provements in their standards of living and 
the relaxation of political terror since 1953 
have served to decrease the intensity of dissi-
dence and considerably whittled down, if not 
eliminated for the time being, actual resist-
ance potential. Thus, while the improvement 
of living standards has lagged far behind the 
over-all rates of economic growth, there is evi-
dence that the Kremlin now favors such im-
provement, mainly in order to increase labor 
productivity, to remove the stigma of poverty 
from Communism, and to generate more ac-
tive support by Soviet citizens. Heavy indus-
try, military requirements, and technological 
developments will continue to have priority 
but, barring unforeseen complications, the 
present regime's economic reforms and in-
creased production will at least give the peo-
ple the reassurance that something is being 
done for them. Many probably feel already 
that they are better off now than they have 
been for years. Discontent arising from eco-
nomic causes is likely to diminish as consumer 
welfare improves over the next several years, 
although this effect will be partially offset if 
expectations which have been aroused by re-
gime promises are disappointed and if famil-
iarity with Western standards grows. How-
ever, the spectacular successes of Soviet sci-
ence have almost certainly strengthened the 
allegiance of the people to the regime and are 
probably attributed by many to the Soviet sys-
tem itself. Therefore it should not necessarily 
be assumed that closer contacts with the West 
would inevitably generate more dissatisfaction

94 SECRET 
among the Soviet rank and file, which may 
have come to believe that the eventual 
supremacy of the USSR is certain and that 
ultimately the Russian people will be better 
off than the peoples in the free world. 
3. There remain, however, some causes of dis-
sidence that may continue to create difficul-
ties for the regime. One is the agricultural 
collectivization policy. Russian peasants re-
main overwhelmingly opposed to it, especially 
so the peasants in the newly acquired Western 
territories who have lived under Soviet rule 
only since 1944. Realizing this, the Kremlin 
has introduced reform measures that may 
pacify many peasants and at the same time 
raise their output. With the older generation 
dying out, the younger agricultural workers 
will probably not have as high a resistance 
potential, at least as long as the USSR re-
mains generally successful in stabilizing and 
furthering its economic and politica position. 
Another problem is thought control. The 
party, more powerful than ever, continues to 
control virtually every facet of human 
thought. Adherence or at least lip service to 
the Party-sanctioned theories, laws, methods, 
and esthetic positions is required eventually 
of all. The loosening of intellectual strin-
gency during the past few years has relieved 
a certain amount of pressure, but the Party 
has made it quite clear, after the "thaw" set 
in, that it will not tolerate deviations. Intel-
lectuals are no longer liquidated, however, 
they are "persuaded" to return to the rightful 
path. While most of them return to con-
formity, their public repentances appear ex-
torted and they probably nourish their griev-
ances in secret perhaps more intensely than 
before. 
4. The most disgruntled elements are almost 
certainly the national minorities. The rein-
troduction of the policy of russification which 
began in the thirties has created ill will to-
ward the Russians, especially since some of 
the minorities were incorporated into or an-
nexed by the USSR against their wishes. Al-
though some of the more blatant forms of 
russification have been abandoned by the 
post-Stalin regime, the basic policy has been 
retained. Russification now involves the 
spread of the Russian language and culture 
throughout the Soviet Union, praise of the 
Russian people as the leading nationality in 
the USSR, and the imposition of Russian 
administrators and officials in key posts 
throughout minority areas. Anti-Semitism, 
though not as rampant as in the years just 
before Stalin's death, is still widespread and 
the regime not only does little to combat it 
but by its attacks on Zionism actually encour-
ages it. (For a more detailed discussion of 
the more important minority areas, see the 
appendixes on the Baltic, Ukraine and Cau-
casus.) 
MAJOR DISSIDENT ELEMENTS 
5. Forced Labor and Exiles. There may still 
be as many as 2,500,000 forced laborers ? in-
cluding both political and criminal ele-
ments ? in prison camps and an indetermi-
nate number of exiles who unquestionably 
constitute a group that harbors the strongest 
resistance potential. Although the number of 
political prisoners has been reduced and 
prison conditions ameliorated since 1953, the 
forced laborers still live under very harsh cir-
cumstances, and the exiles are denied many 
rights and opportunities accorded ordinary 
Soviet citizens. Resistance potential is in-
herent in these elements, as reflected in the 
Vorkuta and other labor camp strikes which, 
incidentally, were organized and led by the 
political prisoners. It is also possible that 
large numbers of the many millions of labor 
camp inmates who have been discharged have 
a strong hatred for a government that mis-
treated them and might swell the ranks of 
potential resisters. 
6. Peasants. Dissidence among peasants has 
traditionally been strong and has focussed 
upon collectivization and the low living stand-
ards identified with it. These living stand-
ards have risen substantially since 1953 be-
cause of successive increases in the prices paid 
for compulsory state deliveries, but they gen-
erally remain below what the peasant thinks 
he could obtain from a free market. In addi-
tion, bureaucratic rigidities and frequent at-
tempts to eliminate their private plots and 
personal livestock offend the peasants' sense 
of individuality and tend to alienate them

SECRET 95 
from the regime. Nevertheless, they have 
been relatively free from police terror in re-
cent years, and while many peasants resent 
the anti-religious policy of the government, 
they probably care little about ideological 
preachings and thought control. 
7. Intellectuals. The intelligentsia, in gen-
eral, stands high in Soviet society in terms of 
income and prestige, and many of them, par-
ticularly among the bureaucrats and engi-
neers, have a vested interest in the regime. 
Most scientists, moreover, seem to enjoy both 
official support and relative freedom of pur-
suit in their fields. The limited relaxation of 
controls following Stalin's denigration em-
boldened intellectuals in many less favored 
fields to protest against party controls, though 
usually by implication only. These protests 
revealed that virtually all prominent writers, 
artists, composers, and scholars would wel-
come more freedom of expression. Although 
the post-Stalin regime has somewhat relaxed 
the extremely stringent Stalinist conformism, 
it has basically maintained its doctrines, and 
merely enforces them with greater flexibility 
and leniency. Strictures on creative expres-
sion remain tight enough to cause widespread 
dissidence among the more sensitive intellec-
tuals. However, the dissidence of Soviet in-
tellectuals is not necessarily one of hostility 
against the Soviet system but is often directed 
against the methods and interpretations of 
the Communist gospel by the Soviet leaders. 
8. Students, Youth. There has been evidence 
of student dissidence, and there were demon-
strations in 1956 and 1957 by young people 
against the discipline and the drabness of So-
viet life. These demonstrations were all the 
more striking as youth has for years been con-
sidered among the firmest supporters of the 
regime. Nevertheless, it appeared that as a 
result of a higher intellectual level achieved 
by improved Soviet education, of the atmos-
phere of relaxation following the death of Sta-
lin, the 20th CPSU Congress, and the Hun-
garian revolution youth has turned a critical 
eye on the disparity between Communist 
theory and practice. But in spite of the fact 
that students at least are now better equipped 
to think for themselves and that the regime 
apparently allows for greater leniency in deal-
ing with young deviationists, it would be in-
correct to consider Soviet youth a generally 
disloyal group. Youths remain Soviet pa-
triots even though their understanding of 
ideology may be superficial and their adher-
ence to it perfunctory. The fact remains that 
they as yet know little outside the USSR and 
that their thinking is done through a filter 
of state-defined ideological premises. It is 
doubtful, therefore, that their dissidence con-
stitutes a serious threat to the regime's fu-
ture; it is much more likely to be directed to-
wards gradual reform of the regime than its 
overthrow. 
9. National minorities, constituting 45 per-
cent of the Soviet population of 206,300,000,1 
have for many years provided centers of re-
sistance to Soviet Communism. Though the 
degree of dissidence has varied sharply among 
minority groups, no other groups inside the 
USSR have fought so grimly against over-
whelming odds. In the first postwar years, 
a reported 200,000 partisans in the Ukraine 
and probably 100,000 in Lithuania battled So-
viet troops. The process of russification and 
sovietization was carried out with determina-
tion by Moscow; entire minorities were trans-
planted from home areas and, in the process, 
more or less destroyed as groups. By 1949, the 
back of the resistance was broken, and follow-
ing the death of Stalin, a policy of appease-
ment was instituted. As will be seen in the 
appendices, the minorities which had been 
part of the Tsarist empire and thus become 
components of the USSR have calmed down 
and are not, at this time, believed to constitute 
a threat to the Moscow regime. However, 
the Western territories which were annexed 
during or after World War II, while forcibly 
pacified, still rank high in potential resistance 
groups. 
10. Industrial workers' grievances stem main-
ly from low pay, strict discipline, and bureau-
cratic arbitrariness. Among the workers, the 
semi-skilled and unskilled ones, receiving 
'Population estimate as of January 1, 1958, from

much lower pay and fewer privileges than the 
highly skilled, are probably the more disaf-
fected element. However, their living stand-
ard has recently improved and there is now 
less emphasis on the harsh labor discipline 
that was once a chief factor of dissidence 
among workers during Stalin's rule. Gen-
erally, the resistance potential of this social 
group cannot be presumed to be high and, 
with further economic improvements as well 
as over-all successes of the regime, may fur-
ther decrease. 
11. Armed Forces. There is no evidence of 
serious dissidence in the Soviet armed forces. 
The permanent cadre of officers and noncom-
missioned officers (constituting about 20 per-
cent of total strength) is composed of ap-
parently reliable men who have been thor-
oughly indoctrinated; most of the officers are 
Communist Party members. There is some 
dissatisfaction among the conscripts, much of 
which stems from the normal soldier's cus-
tomary causes of discontent ? low pay, strict 
discipline, limited opportunities for social ac-
tivities, etc. Further, the attitude of the con-
scripts reflects the various causes of discon-
tent among the populace at large, but no 
anti-regime activities have developed. The in-
crease of party control following the removal 
of Marshal Zhukov has undoubtedly irritated 
some elements of the military but not enough 
to produce serious dissidence. Whether harsh 
military discipline and the wide cleavage be-
tween the status of the officers and enlisted 
men, and again between the junior and senior 
officers, actually contributes to dissidence di-
rected against the regime is doubtful. Al-
though it may be true that soldiers do not like 
compulsory indoctrination, it is also true that 
at least some of it will sink into their con-
sciousness and that they regard such exer-
cises as an inevitable duty to their nation, of 
whose achievements they are proud. On the 
whole, it can be assumed that there is little 
if any resistance potential to be found in the 
Soviet armed forces. 
INTENSITY OF DISSIDENCE 
12. Dissidence exists on nearly every level of 
Soviet society, extending from simple grumbl-
ing to the rejection of the regime and its ideo-
logy. It is believed, however, that the latter 
extreme occurs most often among people who 
have suffered at the hands of the regime by ar-
rest, imprisonment, or persecution, or those 
whose close relatives and friends have suffered. 
The overwhelming majority of the people, par-
ticularly in the Russian component of the 
USSR, are complaining mainly about personal 
discomforts, which some, however, may well 
attribute to the faults of the system. Even 
before the Malenkov-Khrushchev innovations 
and reforms contributed to a general decline 
of dissidence, the regime had already estab-
lished such pervasive authority that the peo-
ple were forced to devote their energies to cop-
ing with existing conditions rather than tak-
ing steps to achieve an alternate solution. 
Although active resistance ceased by 1950, dis-
sidence is still widespread. On the other 
hand, much of what appears to be passive 
resistance may be in large part nothing more 
than a demonstration of time-honored Rus-
sian indifference or apathy. 
13. Dissidence in many areas of the USSR is 
not a factor of real significance, and the gulf 
between dissidence and resistance is far wider 
than elsewhere in the Sino-Soviet Bloc. In 
the first place, the Soviet population has ex-
perienced Communist rule for four decades 
and has, by and large, become accustomed to 
it. In the second place, this rule is exercised 
by compatriots, not by foreigners, and the 
grievances of Soviet peoples, particularly the 
Russians, are not reinforced by the emotional 
power of injured nationalism. Whether a 
crisis would change this attitude and create 
or stimulate a resistance potential, would de-
pend on the type and duration of the crisis. 
In a war, the vast majority of the Soviet peo-
ple could be expected to set aside their com-
plaints and defend their homeland. If, as a 
result of a crisis, improvement of the living 
standard should decline, it is possible that, 
at least among some groups, minor types of 
dissidence could grow into more serious ones. 
In any event, opposition to the present re-
gime or its methods does not imply a desire 
on the part of the people to reject all funda-
mental concepts on which the Soviet state 
is built.

TRENDS OF DISSIDENCE SINCE 1953 
14. Since the death of Stalin and the demise 
of Beria, a more relaxed political climate and 
a number of measures taken to alleviate the 
most serious causes of dissidence have con-
tributed to a decrease in dissidence, particu-
larly in the prewar territories of the USSR 
but perhaps even, to some degree, in the new-
ly annexed territories. Among these meas-
ures were efforts to raise the living standards, 
the easiing of arbitrary police state methods, 
a gradual decrease of the labor camp popula-
tion, somewhat more freedom of expression 
combined with a less fear-laden atmosphere, 
and, though in a very limited way, increased 
contact with countries outside the Bloc. The 
20th CPSU Congress constituted the climax 
of these developments and made all previous 
relaxation moves by the Kremlin leaders offi-
cial. 
15. However, some of the new methods proved 
to be counter-productive inasmuch as they 
stimulated questioning by Soviet citizens, who 
began to express their doubts about the work-
ings of the Soviet system and its tactics. The 
events in Poland and Hungary caused con-
siderable interest and questioning, particu-
larly among the intelligentsia. These events 
among others hastened a certain retrench-
ment by the regime, of which the theoretical 
bases were announced in the middle of 1956. 
Mao's "hundred flowers" doctrine, too, led to 
retrenchment in China, which must have been 
added evidence that, whatever the nature of 
their questioning and doubts, expression of 
dissent and dissidence would meet with re-
gime counteraction. 
16. Whether dissidence in the USSR will in-
crease or decrease in the future is hard to 
predict. Continued improvements in living 
standards and further gains in Soviet prestige 
through technological or diplomatic successes 
will tend to diminish it, particularly among 
the majority which is largely unconcerned 
with ideological issues or abstract considera-
tions of freedom. Students and intellectuals, 
whose ranks are growing, pose a greater prob-
lem, since many of their questionings are more 
fundamental. The regime, while ready to re-
trench from its more liberal policies when dis-
sidence finds mounting expression, apparently 
still desires to refrain from total repression in 
this area lest it stifle the "positive" initiative 
which it is seeking to encourage. Thus an op-
portunity has appeared for dissidence to grow 
so long as it remains quiescent and does not 
seem likely, in the regime's view, to assume ac-
tive forms. If the current stabilization pro-
gram should succeed, dissidence may peter out 
even in the new Western territories. If not, 
the security apparatus of the Soviet regime 
could easily keep such dissidence from grow-
ing into resistance. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
17. Active and organized resistance was a seri-
ous problem during and just after World War 
II. Thereafter, severe Stalinist repression 
prevented any active resistance of significance. 
Stalin's death gave new impetus to resistance 
as demonstrated by large-scale unrest in some 
Siberian prison camps. Again, some active re-
sistance erupted in 1956, such as riots in 
Tbilisi, strike and work stoppages in Moscow's 
Kaganovich Ball-Bearing Plant, and national-
ist demonstrations in Vilnyus and Kaunas in 
Lithuania. These outbreaks were spontane-
ous and not necessarily subversive. Other-
wise, no organized resistance groups are be-
lieved to exist in the USSR, with the possible 
exception of such religious sects as the Jeho-
vah's Witnesses, the Monashi, and others. 
The Witnesses have been most active in the 
western Ukraine and in Moldavia. The sect 
was accused of taking orders from its parent 
organization in Brooklyn, of preaching that 
the United States is a democratic country, of 
encouraging pacifism among draft-age youth, 
and having advised its members during the 
Hungarion revolution to fight against the So-
viet government. The group apparently was 
able to survive as a tight-knit organization 
for several years because of the total dedica-
tion of its members but its continued exist-
ence as an organization is questionable. 
18. Whatever resistance still exists in the 
USSR is almost certainly unorganized and 
passive. Much evidence of unorganized re-
sistance to specific policies or ideological 
tenets has come to light during the past two 
years. It often has taken the form of public

criticism of policies or concepts, mostly as 
criticism of less basic matters; attempts by 
writers, artists, and scholars to break through 
official controls; insubordination toward offi-
cial discipline, from refusal to attend propa-
ganda lectures to hooliganism and crime; and 
nationalistic grumbling by minorities. Un-
organized resistance is most likely to occur 
in intellectual and student circles and has as 
its object the greater liberalization of the So-
viet regime toward individual freedom. 
19. Unorganized resistance is hard to evalu-
ate because it depends on the motivation of 
the person who performs a particular act. 
Much of what might be considered resistance 
probably consists of individual criminal acts, 
such as looting, robbing, and murder. The 
murder or beating up of police informants, 
tax collectors, and administrative officials may 
perhaps be unorganized resistance but it may 
also be an act of vengeance of an individual 
in reponse to a particular situation and not 
really pertinent to the question of unorganized 
resistance. Reports of acts of violence in the 
Soviet Union should be regarded cautiously 
before being considered indicative of unor-
ganized resistance. Since the death of Sta-
lin, the population of the labor camps has 
been tremendously reduced and various am-
nesties, beginning with that of April 1953, 
released a large number of habitual criminals. 
That individuals of this sort turn to violence 
when released can be explained in too many 
other ways for their actions to be considered 
indicative of resistance potential. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
20. Anti-Soviet emigres seem to have played 
a negligible role in directing or even inspir-
ing recent resistance activity within the So-
viet Union. The regime seems to have suc-
ceeded in isolating potential leaders of resist-
ance from foreign contacts. Most Soviet citi-
zens seem to have little knowledge of emigre 
activities. Even if the Soviet public were bet-
ter informed concerning emigres, it is doubt-
ful that the latter could gain substantial sup-
port inside the Soviet Union. The feeling is 
widespread that emigres have lost touch with 
Soviet reality and no longer understand the 
real problems facing the Soviet citizenry. 
Many, in addition, would resent what they 
consider the emigres flight to luxurious living 
while their compatriots at home languished in 
poverty. Some minorities, particularly the 
Baltic peoples, may have more sympathy for 
their emigres than the Russians do. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
21. The regime seeks to inhibit dissidence by 
a vast propaganda campaign designed to pop-
ularize the Communist Party and the Soviet 
system and to discredit all Western countries 
in the eyes of the populace. The regime also 
maintains an ubiquitous secret police organi-
zation under the control of the Committee of 
State Security (KGB) of the Council of Min-
isters of the USSR, for the purpose of main-
taining complete survelliance over the popu-
lation and ferreting out any individuals or 
organizations exhibiting actual or potential 
anti-regime tendencies. An estimated 400,-
000 militarized security forces (most of them 
Border and Interior Troops) are kept in con-
stant readiness to quell summarily any anti-
regime uprisings. Punitive measures, includ-
ing mass deportation and forced labor in re-
mote areas of the USSR, serve both to remove 
active resistance elements and to discourage 
further resistance activity. Such measures 
have been applied with special force in the 
Baltic States, the western Ukraine, and the 
Caucasus. The effectiveness of the govern-
ment's actions is reflected in the apparent 
stability of the regime. While the present 
trend in the Soviet Union appears to be to-
ward a less stringent application of security 
controls than during the Stalin era, there is 
every indication that the security apparatus 
itself has lost none of its effectiveness. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
22. The regime has shown its ability to con-
trol local and sporadic disturbances. In the 
event of a revolt in a national minority area, 
Soviet military units in the area, which usual-
ly consist of cross sections of many Soviet 
nationalities, would hardly be vulnerable, as 
were the Hungarian and Polish forces, to any

nationalist appeal. In case of a simultaneous 
or rapidly spreading revolt in several heavily 
populated areas, the Soviet regime, due to its 
formidable security apparatus, would appear 
to be in a better position to defend itself 
than any other government in the world, un-
less it were dangerously weakened. While 
even then it cannot be predicted that the en-
tire Soviet control system would collapse, it 
is possible that the effectiveness of the securi-
ty apparatus would be greatly weakened. 
MODIFICATION OF SECURITY APPARATUS 
23. The Soviet security apparatus has under-
gone some modification since the death of 
Stalin in 1953. That year the Ministry of 
State Security (MGB) was absorbed by the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and in 
1954 the Committee of State Security (KGB) 
of the Council of Ministers was formed, al-
though without some functions formerly held 
by the MGB. The MVD which inherited some 
of the regulatory apparatus from the MGB, 
including the militia (civil police) and the 
security troops, lost some of its functions, 
and control over local operations of some 
of its remaining functions was decentralized. 
While the ostensible purpose of these modifi-
cations was to restore "socialist legality" to 
the police system and to increase the responsi-
bility of local governments for law and order, 
Moscow is in a position to assert its direct 
control over all security and law enforcement 
agencies. 
24. Modifications in the apparatus have been 
primarily undertaken with two aims in view: 
First, to deny to any given individual in the 
Soviet hierarchy total control over the organs 
of the secret police and to circumscribe to 
some degree their power in society. The sec-
ond concern has been primarily one of allow-
ing Soviet citizens to relax as a whole and to 
eliminate those secret police functions that 
seemed ineffective in their coercive aspects for 
the efficient operation of Soviet society. There 
has been no indication of a greater hesitation 
in undertaking investigation of significant 
causes of subversion and treason. The size 
of the security police apparatus was reduced 
significantly after Stalin's death, but in the 
99 
summer of 1957 these forces were increased. 
Available information does not indicate 
whether the reductions of 1953-1954 period 
exceeded the increase of the summer of 1957. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
25. Present capabilities for organized resist-
ance are virtually nonexistent. Even some-
what liberalized security controls are probably 
more than adequate to stamp out any in-
cipient organized attempt to resist. Unor-
ganized resistance, chiefly passive, is likely to 
diminish as the USSR becomes militarily and 
economically stronger. With the exception of 
some national minorities, the maximum that 
can be expected from the overwhelming ma-
jority of the Soviet people, and particularly 
the Russians, is dissidence of a type that is 
not necessarily directed against the system as 
such. On the other hand, in a monolithic 
state, opposition to a part of the system can 
be regarded as tantamount to opposition to 
the system as a whole; the Soviet leaders 
almost certainly so consider it. A steady 
improvement in the living standard would 
almost certainly reduce an important source 
of dissidence, but not that of intellectuals and 
students, for example. A deterioration in 
living conditions would add to other sources 
of dissidence and raise resistance potential 
in time of crisis. 
26. The relation between the level of dissi-
dence and a change in the degree of East-West 
tensions is difficult to predict. Major devel-
opments in international relations will cer-
tainly affect the level of dissidence, but 
whether it will increase or decrease depends 
on the specifics of any given case. Tensions 
attributable to Soviet foreign policy may well 
raise the level of dissidence while tensions re-
sulting from moves generally considered to be 
Western provocation may lower the level of 
dissidence. A reduction in tension may re-
duce the amount of dissidence or at least 
deepen the apathy of national minority 
groups, but on the other hand it is likely to 
stimulate further dissidence from intellec-
tuals and artists and in other of the elite levels 
of Soviet society by turning their attention 
from external dangers to internal problems.

27. Whatever doubts in the regime and its 
ideology might have been aroused by the de-
Stalinization campaign and the ensuing ide-
ological controversy, the loyalty of the people 
to the Soviet state was not shaken. Further-
more, some of the doubts now existing may be 
assuaged as the regime continues its stabili-
zation drive. In any case, independent think-
ing and a more objective approach to Marx-
ism-Leninism could not be expected to 
strengthen resistance potential to the degree 
that it would endanger the Soviet state. The 
regime, while fostering a "creative," i.e., non-
dogmatic, approach to these problems, will 
attempt to keep the arguments within a re-
gime-approved framework and to restrict the 
scope and nature of the changes sought. The 
regime, however, will not hesitate to revert to 
harsher, oppressive measures to keep the peo-
ple in line if it appears necessary. 
28. Certain kinds of external support, notably 
those stimulating active, violent, and futile 
resistance to the Communist regime, would 
almost certainly be counter-productive in re-
spect to nearly all dissident elements in the 
Soviet Union. However, support designed to 
serve more modest aims, such as continued lib-
eralization, would be welcomed by disaffected 
individuals and groups. The acceptability and 
success of external support depend on many 
factors such as the kind of support, identity 
and source of support, the safety of the re-
cipient, the nature of "resistance" asked for, 
the kind of reward involved, etc. General 
expressions of encouragement designed for 
the peaceful evolution of the system as are 
possible for radio broadcasts, may also be wel-
come to some elements of the population, but 
be taken by other, more militant dissidents as 
abandonment by the West. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
29. Anti-Communist or anti-regime resistance 
in the USSR in wartime would depend largely 
on the length, severity, and location of the war 
and on the course of its military operations. 
The mere initiation of hostilities would not 
ipso facto increase the resistance potential. 
It is almost certain that the regime's appeal 
to Soviet patriotism would not fall on deaf 
ears and that most of the Soviet peoples, with 
the exception of some national minorities, 
would work and fight for the defense of their 
homeland. Moreover, security control would 
undoubtedly be stepped up and dissidents 
would find it more difficult to organize and 
more dangerous to state their views than in 
peacetime. 
30. If the war were prolonged and the USSR 
suffered major reverses, resistance potential 
would probably increase. In view of Soviet be-
havior during World War II and considering 
the fact that since then the USSR has become 
far stronger and has acquired much more 
prestige, it cannot be assumed that popular 
suffering from great hardships, tensions, and 
tighter controls would in itself catalyze dissi-
dence into resistance. Only if war damage 
were sufficient to cause a breakdown of central 
authority would organized resistance develop. 
Short of this contingency, even if the regime 
were weakened, anti-regime resistance would 
still be regarded as treason and enough secu-
rity controls would remain to render organi-
zation or resistance very difficult. 
31. Active resistance would become much 
more likely if the tide of the war turned defi-
nitely against the USSR and foreign troops 
entered the USSR. Until that point, many 
anti-Soviet elements would be afraid to act, 
remembering the severe penalties imposed on 
collaborators with the Germans after World 
War II. Particularly in minority areas along 
the border, extensive anti-Soviet activity could 
be expected as anti-Soviet forces approached. 
Many natives inspired with the vision of liber-
ation would take to the woods and form parti-
san bands, as they did during and after World 
War II, raiding supply lines, performing acts 
of sabotage, providing intelligence and help-
ing in escape and evasion operations. Some 
groups in other parts of the USSR would be 
willing to offer assistance if communication 
could be established with them. For example, 
forced labor camps and colonies, representing 
as they do concentrations of anti-Soviet ele-
ments, might be able to create disturbances in 
the hinterland. Many exiled Germans, North 
Caucasians, Crimean Tatars, and Halts in 
Central Asia, the Altai territory, and Siberia 
probably would be willing intelligence collec-

SECRET 101 
tors. However, it would be difficult to organ-
ize active resistance in areas still under Soviet 
control. Even if hard pressed on military 
fronts, the Soviet leaders would make a deter-
mined, and probably successful, effort to 
maintain control in the hinterland to prevent 
resistance elements from becoming active be-
hind their lines. 
32. In the event of an impending collapse of 
the Soviet government, anti-Soviet elements 
of the population, together with forced labor 
camp inmates and forced exiles, could attain 
significant resistance capabilities, particularly 
with external support. But apart from these 
elements, resistance among the broad masses 
of the Great Russian people would be difficult 
to organize. Patriotism, indoctrinated re-
spect for Soviet authority, and apathy prob-
ably would render them passive and disin-
clined to active opposition. Therefore, even if 
the security apparatus were seriously weak-
ened, little resistance activity could be ex-
pected from the mass of the Great Russian 
population beyond local harassing operations 
and defections. Similarly, the most common 
reaction to a foreign occupation of Soviet ter-
ritory probably would be passivity and suspi-
cion. Memories of the last war are still fresh 
and the people have not forgotten the bru-
tality of the German occupation, as well as 
the subsequent Soviet revenge for collabora-
tion. Since Soviet propaganda would try to 
equate the activities of the invaders with those 
of the Germans in the last war, occupation 
policies would be crucial in determining the 
attitude of the masses. 
33. A limited amount of information on nu-
clear weapons effects has been released to the 
Soviet public since 1954, but the campaign 
appears to have minimized the effects of 
atomic warfare. This effort has been accom-
panied by propaganda, probably to arouse 
patriotism, picturing a nuclear war purely as 
a measure in defense of the homeland and 
reassuring the people of Soviet victory in such 
a conflict. Although popular reaction to 
atomic attack is extremely difficult to esti-
mate, such a familiarization program may 
have the effect of leaving the populace so un-
prepared for the actual destruction and dislo-
cation that survivors would be demoralized 
and that patriotic fervor might be over-
whelmed. 
34. A nuclear attack on any scale is unlikely 
immediately to either increase or decrease re-
sistance activities among the survivors to any 
appreciable extent. However, within a short 
period of time the extreme hardships brought 
about by even a small nuclear attack would 
tend to create actions of desperate elements 
which, whether intended or not, would have 
the effect of resistance. At the same time 
inevitable disruption of the control structure 
resulting from such an attack would reduce 
the regime's capability to deal with such ele-
ments. If a limited nuclear attack were 
planned and executed so as to reduce Soviet 
administrative, political and military control 
but to minimize general population casualties 
in national minority areas, such as the Lat-
vian, Estonian and Lithuanian SSR's, the 
Georgian SSR, and to a lesser extent the 
Ukraine, it is probable that resistance activi-
ties in these areas would become greatly in-
tensified, particularly if they received external 
support. 
35. Such resistance potential as does exist 
would probably not be affected by the question 
of which side started the war. It can be taken 
for granted that the Soviet government would 
do all it could to shift the blame to the free 
world in general and the United States in par-
ticular. It may be assumed that potential 
resisters as well as many dissidents would 
anticipate such propaganda and not pay too 
much attention to it. The population as a 
whole, even if impressed with Soviet argu-
ments at the beginning of the war, would in 
the long run be influenced by the trend of the 
war rather than by the question as to who 
attacked whom first. Also, the nationality of 
the attacking forces would probably have lit-
tle effect on long-range popular attitudes, ex-
cept that popular opposition to the invaders 
would almost certainly be much stronger 
against Germans than other nationalities.

APPENDIX A 
ANTI-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN THE BALTIC REPUBLICS 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. All the factors which engender dissidence 
in the USSR are present in the Baltic repub-
lics ? collectivized agriculture, low standards 
of living, pronounced income inequalities, 
state control of thought and expression, and 
fresh memories and continuing fear of police 
terror. These alienating factors are inten-
sified manyf old, however, by the national con-
sciousness and historic experience of the Bal-
tic peoples.1 Resistance potential is probably 
nowhere higher in the Soviet Union than in 
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. 
2. The most important single factor in Baltic 
opposition to Soviet rule is the experience of 
national independence between the world 
wars. The bitter memory of forced Soviet 
annexation is intensified by the brutality of 
Soviet rule, which brought the exile or liq-
uidation of hundreds of thousands of natives, 
by the radical depression of living standards, 
and by the imposition of the rule and immi-
gration of the traditionally hated and feared 
Russians. Thus, anti-Soviet and anti-Russian 
sentiments pervade all Baltic social strata 
and groups. Outright Communist sympa-
thizers comprise only a minute fraction of the 
native population. Many native Communist 
Party leaders lived in the USSR when the Bal-
tic states were independent and returned only 
upon Soviet annexation of their native coun-
tries; Balts in general look on them as rene-
gades. 
3. The near unanimity of anti-Soviet feelings 
among native Balts is to a certain degree offset 
I Although in a strict ethnic sense the terms 
"Baltic" and "Balt" should be applied only to 
Latvians and Lithuanians, Estonians being of 
Finnish stock, the term is used in this paper 
to apply to all three, for convenience and on 
geographic grounds. 
by the greater political reliability of ethnic 
Russians brought into the area since World 
War II. The estimated proportion of the non-
indigenous population of Russians in the Bal-
tic republics ranges from a high of 40 percent 
in Latvia to a low of 20 percent in Lithuania. 
Since the position of Russians in these coun-
tries is dependent entirely on Soviet rule, 
they have a strong vested interest in main-
taining the present regime. 
4. Despite the intensity of anti-Soviet feeling 
among most Balts, Soviet security measures 
at present prevent any resistance greater than 
individual or small-group passive resistance 
and an occasional mass demonstration. Only 
a radical alteration of the present situation, 
such as war, a sharp relaxation of security 
controls, or a breakdown of the Soviet sys-
tem itself would seem to make possible or-
ganized resistance on a large scale. 
5. The de-Stalinization campaign and the 
partial liberalization of the Soviet system 
since Stalin's death (both of which were more 
limited in the Baltic republics than in most 
other areas of the USSR) brought some hope 
to Balts, expressed mainly in the form of 
rumors during the spring of 1956 that the 
Soviet leadership might restore the Baltic re-
publics to autonomous, although satellite, 
status. The events in Poland and Hungary 
in the autumn of 1956 encouraged a few 
nationalist demonstrations in Lithuania and 
open anti-Soviet talk elsewhere. The regime 
easily curtailed such public manifestations of 
nationalism, however. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
6. Reports in 1952 and 1953 indicated the pos-
sibility of small groups of organized resist-
ance in Lithuania. However, as in northwest-
ern Latvia, the few remaining groups were be-

104 SECRET 
ing successfully penetrated by MVD provoc-
ateurs. It is doubtful if any unpenetrated 
group existed after 1954. As a result, there 
are no known organized resistance groups in 
the Baltic area at this time. While there is 
reason to believe that some former resistance 
group members may still live in the forests of 
southeastern Lithuania, there is no recent 
evidence to indicate that an organization as 
such exists. Acts of sabotage that occasional-
ly occurred up until 1953 appear to have been 
the work of isolated persons. 
7. The immediate objectives of any remain-
ing groups in the Baltic states probably would 
be personal and organizational survival. A 
secondary objective would be harassment of 
Soviet forces and collaborators. Their ulti-
mate objective presumably would be the crea-
tion of a national state in which they could 
resume a normal life. There is no known or-
ganized anti-Communist infiltration of the 
armed forces, bureaucracy, or war industry. 
Nonviolent resistance in the Baltic republics, 
such as occurred during the Hungarian revolt, 
when there was what appeared to be a spon-
taneous expression of nationalism, was prob-
ably not the work of organized resistance 
groups. 
8. The extent and nature of unorganized re-
sistance is unknown but believed to be de-
creasing in over-all signficance. Students ap-
pear to exhibit a potential for unorganized 
resistance. In all three republics student un-
rest in the universities has been expressed 
during 1956 and 1957 in demonstrations and 
in the distribution of leaflets. Party leaders 
have been criticized for neglecting student 
ideological education. 
9. Dissidence and passive resistance also ap-
pear to exist, but there is not sufficient evi-
dence to evaluate their extent and signifi-
cance. Newspapers in the Baltic states crit-
icize nonproduction in factories and kolkh-
ozes and there is the usual amount of self-
criticism in the papers. While these items 
indicate that the Soviet regime is not satisfied 
with conditions in the Baltic republics, only 
a part of the acts can be attributed to purpose-
ful resistance. Passive resistance in the form 
of a slow-down of production cannot be in-
creased perceptibly without incurring danger 
of deportation or other acts of reprisal and 
control. 
10. Dissidence is widespread, but difficult to 
detect and to evaluate except when the stim-
ulus of external events changes dissidence 
into action. During the Hungarian revolt in 
1956 widespread unorganized resistance was 
shown in the overturning of a Stalin statue, 
in demonstrations demanding withdrawal of 
Red Army troops, in staging of parades, and in 
singing the national anthems, most noticeably 
in Lithuania, but reportedly in Estonia and 
Latvia also. From these actions dissidence 
appears to be widespread. The independence 
spirit is still alive in the Baltic states, but 
there is little opportunity to express it effec-
tively. Expression of dissident feelings has 
been more successful in Lithuania than in Es-
tonia and Latvia. Moreover, Soviet popula-
tion transfers have reduced the number of 
ethnic Estonians to about 75 percent of the 
population, and ethnic Latvians to about 60 
percent and Lithuanians to about 80 percent. 
Replacement population transferees cannot be 
expected to participate in resistance activities. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
11. Balts seem to know comparatively little 
about the activities of emigres, and attempts 
to resist Soviet domination do not seem to be 
directly inspired by emigre activity. Many 
Baits, however, derive satisfaction and encour-
agement from the knowledge that emigre 
groups exist abroad, that many nations (in-
cluding the United States) do not recognize 
the Soviet annexation of their countries, and 
that the Baltic states still have formal diplo-
matic representation in exile. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
12. The regime brought the organized resist-
ance of the Baltic states under control 
through the use of militarized security forces 
and Army troops. Suspect elements of the 
population were deported during the 1945-
1950 period and later replaced by other ethnic 
groups, mainly Russian. Subsequent penetra-
tion of resistance groups by security organs 
along with the individual deportations, de-
pleted the Baltic states of resistance leader-

SECRET 105 
ship, organization, and activity. Russifica-
tion of government organizations has proved 
effective in keeping potential resistance in 
check. Unorganized resistance has been con-
trolled in a similar manner. Passive resist-
ance has been inhibited through threatened 
deportations, pardons to some deportees, 
and improvement in the standard of living. 
Feelings of dissidence are widespread but 
cannot be evaluated accurately because the 
populations have little opportunity to trans-
late dissidence into action. Until recent-
ly, even mildly anti-Soviet statements were 
punished by arrest and long imprisonment. 
Even now, persons who show evidence of lead-
ing nationalistic activity are arrested ? as 
were the leaders of the November 1956 demon-
strations in Lithuania. Both because of the 
strategic position of the area and the known 
disaffection of the native population, security 
measures in the Baltic have been even more 
stringent than elsewhere in the USSR. 
13. Milder methods are also employed by the 
regime to reduce dissidence and achieve 
ideological conformity. Party propaganda, 
agitation, and indoctrination are continual 
and virtually omnipresent. The regime offers 
enticing rewards in terms of power and ad-
vancement to Balts who collaborate with it, 
but the threat or exercise of repression re-
mains the most important means of prevent-
ing active resistance in the Baltic republics. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
14. The individual Baltic republic govern-
ments can suppress any localized revolt at 
this time. Soviet troops and militarized 
security forces stationed in the Baltic repub-
lics are of ethnic origins other than the local 
republic in which they are stationed, and can 
be expected to cooperate in the suppression of 
any local revolt. It is therefore unlikely that 
a Hungarian-type uprising could take place in 
any of the Baltic states. The majority of 
Baits live in rural areas while most of the 
Russians and other non-Baits live in cities, 
although in Estonia one can find in nearly 
every kolkhoz some persons who are not 
Baltic. Russians and non-Balts form at least 
half the population of the Baltic capitals. 
15. In both Estonia and Latvia revolts would 
be difficult because there is no contiguous land 
border with a foreign country that might sup-
ply help. Of all the Baltic countries, Lith-
uania has the best conditions for staging a 
spontaneous mass uprising of some duration. 
In addition to bordering on Poland, a foreign 
country with a volatile and Catholic popula-
tion, the Lithuanians have a long history of 
independence and of fighting for their rights 
as they see them. Besides, the geography of 
southeastern Lithuania, particularly the for-
ests and hills, provides a refuge from which 
partisans can operate. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
16. There are no known organized resistance 
groups in the Baltic states. Local capabilities 
for resistance activities do not go beyond un-
organized, mainly passive, resistance or ? un-
der the most favorable conditions ? occa-
sional demonstrations with nationalist over-
tones. More violent types of demonstrations, 
such as holding up Soviet supply vehicles, 
were reported through 1954 but not since. 
Such acts probably were the work of outlaw 
elements, most of whom could not be de-
pended on at the present for specific action 
or for organized action in the future. 
17. A marked increase in East-West tensions 
furnishing hope of liberation would probably 
encourage more determined attempts at ac-
tive resistance. Such a development, however, 
would probably be accompanied by an intensi-
fication of security measures and terror which 
might neutralize most practical effects of the 
increased determination to resist. A decrease 
of East-West tensions would be likely to dis-
courage any sort of active resistance and to in-
crease fatalistic acquiescence to Soviet rule. 
If accompanied by a liberalization of security 
precautions and thought control, it might, 
however, facilitate the spread and develop-
ment of nationalist sentiment. 
18. While it is believed that there is no sub-
stantial organized resistance, either active or 
passive, it is conceivable that some very small 
isolated groups do exist, particularly in south-
eastern Lithuania. But it would be extremely

difficult for them to expand. They have no 
contact with the West and have lost contact 
with friendly local populations through the 
deportation of identifiable sympathizers. 
Their survival efforts constantly require theft 
and other unlawful acts which increase the 
partisans' vulnerability and constantly in-
crease their isolation from any possible 
sources of help, supply, or recruits. At the 
present time, resistance in new forms is virtu-
ally impossible because resistance groups or 
potential members must be supplied with 
funds and equipinent and, most important, 
an effective communications system with each 
other and the West. The lack of communica-
tions prevents the identification and location 
of real or potential resistance members. Un-
til an effective means of communication is 
established, resistance in the Baltic states will 
probably further decrease. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
19. The outbreak of war between the Soviet 
Bloc and the West would undoubtedly increase 
resistance potential in the Baltic states. 
Contrary to the passionate desire for peace in 
almost every other portion of the Soviet 
Union, many Balts hope for an East-West 
war since they see in it their only hope for 
liberation. It cannot be assumed, however, 
that in any future war Baltic resistance could 
be as widespread and effective as it was when 
Germany attacked the USSR in 1941, at which 
time the Baltic states had been under Soviet 
rule less than a year and the Soviet armies 
had to beat a hasty retreat. 
20. The possibilities for active Baltic resist-
ance in any future war would depend largely 
on whether a fighting front were located in 
or near the area. If the front were remote, 
anti-Soviet Balts might be able to form small 
partisan bands in the forests to harass supply 
lines and perform acts of sabotage. Many 
Balts would be willing to assist evasion and 
escape operations, although the presence of 
non-Balts on collectivized farms would com-
pound the difficulties of such assistance. 
Given an opportunity, many Balts would 
probably be willing to perform espionage. So-
viet security measures, however, would proba-
bly be able to prevent large-scale organization 
or military and political warfare of more than 
nuisance value. 
21. If an active front approached the area, on 
the other hand, more widespread resistance 
could be expected, though not approaching 
the Baltic performance in 1941. Under anti-
Soviet occupation, native Balts would be un-
likely to participate in pro-Soviet partisan 
activity and most would lend their hearty sup-
port to the liquidation of Russian partisans or 
pro-Soviet native elements in the area. 
22. Baltic resistance potential in wartime 
would be little affected by such matters as the 
nationality of the attacking forces or which 
side initiated hostilities. Even German rule 
would be considered preferable to Soviet (the 
Nazi occupation of the area having been com-
paratively mild) , although Balts might resist 
Soviet rule with somewhat greater determina-
tion if the attacking forces were non-German.

APPENDIX B 
ANTI-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN THE CAUCASUS 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. Any evaluation of disaffection in the Cau-
casus must take into account the differing 
peoples of this area. While there are elements 
of discontent common to all the indigenous 
peoples of the area which unite them against 
the regime, there are also factors which set 
the Georgians, Armenians, and Azerbaidzhani 
peoples apart from each other. The Georgians 
and Armenians, for reasons of longer inde-
pendent nationhood and a common religion 
(Christianity) , feel superior to the Azerbaid-
zhani, a Moslem people. At the same time, 
the Georgians, because of a longer and more 
unbroken period of independence than the 
Armenians, feel superior to the latter, who 
harbor a latent distrust of their mountain 
neighbors. 
2. The underlying basis for dissatisfaction and 
discontent in Georgia, Armenia, and Azer-
baidzhan is to be found in an anti-Russian 
attitude on the part of the native populations. 
Such factors as non-Slavic lineage, distinct 
languages, acceptance of Christianity in the 
case of Georgia and Armenia antedating Rus-
sian acceptance by several centuries, and dif-
ferent cultural and historical heritages have 
imparted to the Georgians and Armenians, 
particularly the former,- a sense of national 
distinctiveness which makes them look upon 
the Russians as interlopers and late-comers. 
The assistance rendered to the Georgian and 
Armenian nations during critical periods in 
their histories by the Tsarist regime has not 
eliminated this feeling. In the case of the 
Azerbaidzhani people, who prior to the Bol-
shevik Revolution had no real sense of nation-
hood, the anti-Russian bias stems from Rus-
sian colonization. This began in the eight-
eenth century, and reached its peak in the 
late 1800's with Russian exploitation of the oil 
resources around Baku. The ensuing develop-
ment of the area meant a dislocation of native 
groups, a disruption of their traditional way 
of life, and an incipient second-class citizen-
ship. 
3. While difficult to document as to scope and 
intensity, anti-Russianism is demonstrated by 
the limited amount of social contact between 
minorities and Russians. Certain areas of 
large Caucasian cities appear to be separated 
into Slavic and non-Slavic sections. Inter-
marriage does not appear to be too common 
and is frequently frowned on. A more im-
mediate source for disaffection is Soviet Com-
munism in practice ? material hardships, low 
living standards, the collective farm system, 
the antireligious nature of the regime, thought 
control, and the stifling of nationalism ? all 
of which also engender discontent in other 
parts of the Soviet Union. 
4. Apart from the Party and government elite, 
discontent would appear to extend to all strata 
of the population in varying degrees. The 
politically more mature Georgians have been 
most vocal in expressing dissidence in the 
post-Stalin period, followed by the Armenians 
and the Azerbaidzhani in that order. Among 
the Georgians, students and intellectuals are 
the most noteworthy dissident elements. In 
Armenia, the most disaffected group appears 
to be the Armenians who returned to Soviet 
Armenia in the early post-World War II peri-
od. Estimates of the numbers who returned 
range from 25,000 to 100,000. Their disaffec-
tion results mainly from very poor economic 
conditions and the fact that they are not com-
pletely accepted by the local population. 
5. Discontent, though widespread, does not 
appear to be intense enough to translate it-
self into resistance activity, particularly on

SECRET 
an organized basis. Furthermore, the post-
war history of dissidence in the Caucasus sug-
gests that while there has been some resist-
ance, it has been on an unorganized basis and 
without particular goals in mind. A new pat-
tern of dissidence as a result of the post-Sta-
lin policies of the regime is not discernible. 
The relaxation of stringent police controls 
has been welcomed. People express their 
doubts and criticisms of the regime more 
openly now. Such events as the de-Staliniza-
tion campaign, the Polish-Hungarian events, 
and the Soviet leadership ousters of June 
1957 have caused confusion and doubt about 
the present policies of the regime. There are, 
however, no signs of increased dissidence or 
resistance. The population is aware that the 
regime is willing and able to eradicate any 
evidence of resistance. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
6. A few small organized resistance groups 
are believed to exist in Georgia, Armenia, and 
Azerbaidzhan. There is no available informa-
tion on their strength, discipline, training, 
facilities, or equipment. Furthermore, there 
is no means of communication with these 
alleged resistance groups. Such groups would 
almost certainly be nationalistic in motiva-
tion. They would operate within the bound-
aries of their own national republics in most 
cases. 
7. Unorganized active resistance to some de-
gree by the people of the Georgian and Azer-
baidzhan SSR's has been reported. The most 
serious known disturbance occurred in Tbilisi 
in March 1956 when student meetings to 
mark the anniversary of Stalin's death grew 
into nationalistic demonstrations as a result 
of the regime's refusal to permit honors to 
Stalin. The demonstrations were eventually 
put down by force, with casualties estimated 
by various sources at from dozens to 500. 
Apart from this incident, it is often difficult to 
differentiate other reports of unorganized 
active resistance from criminal, speculative 
and blackmarket activities. Available evi-
dence indicates a great deal of dissatisfaction 
with the Moscow regime. Intellectual dissi-
dence also has been shown in many Caucasian 
literary publications which have been severely 
criticized during the last year for nationalistic 
deviations. Certain examples of this litera-
ture reflect a tone of criticism even stronger 
than that which has been directed against the 
regime by Russian writers. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
8. Although emigre groups have claimed con-
tact with resistance organizations inside 
Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaidzhan, such 
claims have not been substantiated in the 
post-Stalin era. There was a contact between 
an internal Georgian opposition element and 
the Georgian government-in-exile, but this 
has not been maintained in recent years. No 
other external sources appear to have influ-
enced any of the internal resistance groups 
since World War II. 
REGIME MEASURES AGAINST RESISTANCE 
9. In the past the Soviet government has dis-
persed from the Caucasus entire ethnic popu-
lations which it believed to be disloyal. Many 
persons have been executed or given sentences 
in labor camps in Siberia or Central Asia. 
Moreover, the Soviet Union has a very effec-
tive internal security organization, with in-
formers in all walks of life and all ethnic 
groups. These measures have been very effec-
tive in controlling active resistance. It is im-
probable that any national minority resist-
ance group of significant size could exist with-
out coming to the attention of the Soviet secu-
rity service. It follows that any major upris-
ing or riot must be essentially spontaneous in 
origin, because any organization large enough, 
with good communications, to foment such an 
event would have been penetrated and neu-
tralized before the event could take place. 
Since the death of Stalin, the technique of 
dispersion of people has not been employed 
and it is possible that the informant system 
has been relaxed somewhat, but either of these 
methods could be revitalized at any moment. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER CONDITIONS 
OF PEACE 
10. Even under present conditions of some-
what relaxed police controls, the Soviet secu-
rity system is more than adequate to prevent

SECRET 109 
or stamp out any organized resistance activity 
in the Caucasus. While individual, unorgan-
ized resistance might be encouraged by the 
regime's relaxation of the rigid police terror 
of the Stalin era, any indication that such acts 
were becoming common or organized would be 
enough to bring about increased security con-
trols to prevent the formation of organized 
resistance. The factor most likely to affect 
resistance potential would appear to be a 
breakdown of the police and security control 
system. Short of this, or of a fundamental 
change in the leadership of the Soviet Union, 
such events as an increase or decrease in East-
West tensions or ideological disputes within 
the "socialist camp" would have little effect 
on resistance activity. Any deterioration in 
the economic condition of the population 
would lead to increased discontent, but the 
regime could easily prevent any organized op-
position to regime policies. Signs of external 
support in any form to resistance groups in 
the Caucasus would bring the sharpest reac-
tion and punitive measures against such 
groups. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
11. The opportunity for anti-regime resist-
ance under conditions of actual warfare would 
depend considerably on the type and location 
of war being fought. The outbreak of hostili-
ties would bring extraordinary security pre-
cautions into play on the part of the state. 
As long as the theater of operations remained 
outside the Caucasus, the likelihood of in-
creased resistance operations would remain 
small because of the increased security meas-
ures. While some resistance groups might 
become active, most likely in Georgia, as soon 
as hostilities broke out, the vast majority of 
the Caucasian population would probably 
adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude. If the tide 
of battle turned conclusively against the So-
viet regime, the potential for organized resist-
ance on an expanded basis would increase 
accordingly. Otherwise, the memory of So-
viet punishment of World War II collaborators 
would militate against large-scale organized 
resistance movements. 
12. The optimum conditions for organized re-
sistance would, of course, occur if the Cau-
casus became a theater of war or if the col-
lapse of central authority were imminent. If 
either should occur, resistance activities would 
probably range from disobedience of Soviet 
laws to assistance to enemy forces in provid-
ing intelligence information, harassment of 
Soviet security and armed forces, and help in 
escape and evasion operations. Independent 
military activity against Soviet forces proba-
bly would be beyond the capacity of resistance 
groups, unless large-scale units defected along 
with equipment and material. Such military 
action would depend on direct outside sup-
port. Moreover, the troops of this area are 
ethnic non-Caucasians. 
13. With the exception of the Germans who 
might encounter hostility because of their 
World War II policies, only the Turks might 
arouse Armenian antagonism; the Armenian 
massacres in the late 1890's and during World 
War I are not yet forgotten. The question of 
the responsibility for the instigation of hos-
tilities would have little effect on resistance 
activities. However, the occupation policies of 
the invading forces would have a strong im-
pact on the local populations as far as their 
willingness to engage in resistance activities 
would be concerned. The Soviet postwar 
propaganda campaign depicting the horrors 
of German occupation in other parts of the 
country was designed in part to overcome any 
latent sympathy in such areas as the Cau-
casus for future "liberating" forces.

APPENDIX C 
ANTI-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN THE UKRAINE 
BASIC FACTORS OF DISSIDENCE 
1. Ukrainian nationalism continues to be an 
important political problem with which the 
Soviet regime must reckon. The Ukrainians 
are the largest minority group in the USSR. 
The political, economic and strategic impor-
tance of the Ukraine is second only to the 
RSFSR. The best evidence of Soviet concern 
over Ukrainian nationalism and its counter-
part, anti-Russian sentiment, is found in re-
curring appeals to root out "bourgeois nation-
alism." 
2. The economic and political grievances com-
mon throughout the Soviet Union are at the 
core of opposition in the Ukraine to Soviet 
rule. Soviet sponsorship of the liquidation of 
the rich peasant and of the collective farm is 
probably resented more there than in some 
other parts of the Soviet Union since the 
Ukraine had a fairly large proportion of pros-
perous peasants. These various grievances, 
shared with other Soviet peoples, count far 
more in explaining existing dissidence in the 
Ukraine than Soviet suppression of Ukrainian 
nationalist aspirations. Opposition to the re-
gime there is first anti-Communist, and only 
second anti-Russian. 
3. Ukrainian reaction to the russification 
efforts of the Soviet regime remains, however, 
considerable. Ukrainians, whether Party 
members or not, remember with bitterness 
Stalin's purge of leading Ukrainian Commu-
nists who stood up for Ukrainian cultural 
autonomy in the 1930's and resent the con-
tinuation of the calculated policy of staffing 
a good portion of leading Party and govern-
ment positions in the Ukraine with Russians. 
Stalin's glorification of Russian heroes and 
the continued identification of Russian his-
tory with the Soviet state hurt Ukrainian 
pride. While religious attitudes may be of 
diminishing importance in the Ukraine as 
elsewhere in the USSR, the liquidation of the 
Ukrainian Autocephalous Church in 1930 and 
of the Uniate Church in the newly acquired 
western Ukraine after the war is a further 
cause for resentment. 
INTENSITY AND CHARACTER OF 
DISSIDENCE 
4. Ukrainian nationalist tensions, although a 
continuing nuisance for the Soviet adminis-
tration, do not now represent any serious 
threat to the regime. The nationalist resist-
ance organizations active in the years imme-
diately following World War II are now large-
ly, if not completely, quiescent. Only in the 
event of a disintegration of Soviet central 
controls might Ukrainian nationalism rise to 
the surface and serve as a focus for an anti-
Soviet resistance movement. 
5. The intensity of Ukrainian nationalist f eel-
ing is difficult to measure. A great many 
Ukrainians, probably the majority, are loyal 
members of Soviet society, particularly now 
that living standards are gradually rising and 
police controls have been slightly relaxed. 
Russification has probably gone further in the 
eastern Ukraine than in any other of the non-
Russian lands and has been much more suc-
cessful in industrial cities, which now contain 
large numbers of Great Russians, than in 
towns and villages. Russians and Ukrainians 
have mingled together there for hundreds of 
years and the educated members of society 
know both languages equally well. Nation-
alistic sentiments increase as one moves west-
ward in the Ukraine away from the Russian 
lands. Opposition to Soviet rule is believed 
to be most intense in the territories absorbed 
during World War II along the Soviet Union's

SECRET 
western borders, where memories of Sovietiza-
tion are freshest. Resentment of the Russians 
is not confined here to Ukrainians alone, but 
is shared by such other minority groups in 
the area as Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, and 
Rumanians. 
RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO DATE 
6. Armed resistance to the Soviet regime after 
World War II was most intense in these west-
ern territories, particularly in the Carpathian 
mountains. Ukrainian nationalist organiza-
tions active in German-occupied Europe dur-
ing the war mounted guerrilla operations 
there against Soviet units, communications 
lines, and collective farms in 1946 and 1947. 
The Soviet authorities had crushed these 
organizations by the late 1940's, but reports 
received from Soviet defectors as late as 1956 
indicating that the Banderovtsy (followers of 
the Ukrainian nationalist Stefan Bandera) , 
are still active, remain unconfirmed. Most 
likely there is no nationalist resistance move-
ment of any significance in the Ukraine at 
this time, but the reports suggest that con-
tinued popular belief in the existence of these 
organizations may be widespread. Although 
there has been no evidence of an upsurge of 
resistance activities since the death of Stalin, 
such activities seem to have been implied in 
radio and press appeals, as late as 1956, that 
partisans in the Volynskaya Oblast surrender 
voluntarily and receive pardons for their past 
actions. 
7. Unorganized resistance in the Ukraine 
exists primarily in the western oblasts and is 
conducted mainly by intellectuals. It is pas-
sive in nature and is manifested in resisting 
russification, e.g., by advocating the use of 
Ukrainian national feeling in literature. Re-
cent attacks on Ukrainian writers as being 
national deviationists tend to confirm these 
trends. 
8. Since the suppression of nationalist aspira-
tions and resistance movements during the 
Stalin regime, there is now no evidence to 
indicate any nationalist movement. Since 
the death of Stalin, the Soviets have treated 
the issue of nationalism cautiously in the 
Ukraine. Some attempts to conciliate nation-
al feeling can be found in their liberation of 
former partisans from labor camps, the re-
habilitation of former Ukrainian Communist 
writers suspected of nationalistic tendencies, 
and the disappearance of some Party and KGB 
officials who had been engaged in the sup-
pression of resistance. The celebration of the 
.300th anniversary of the Union of the Ukraine 
with Russia was officially observed with con-
siderable deference paid to the loyalty and 
heroism of the Ukrainian peoples. 
ROLE OF EMIGRES 
9. Emigre groups have been of no material 
assistance to resistance groups in the Ukraine. 
The little contact that did exist with persons 
in the Ukraine has been broken by capture 
and/or liquidation of the Ukrainian individ-
uals involved. The contact between groups 
in the Ukraine and emigre groups tends to 
become unilateral; escapees augment the emi-
gre colony and intensify anti-Soviet feeling 
in the non-Bloc countries, but there has been 
no significant reverse flow or intensification of 
anti-regime feeling in the Ukraine. However, 
the mere existence of an active emigre group 
may tend to buoy the hopes of those people 
inside the Ukraine who are bitterly opposed 
to the Soviet regime. Concern expressed by 
the Soviets in this matter is reflected in So-
viet intelligence activities against Ukraine 
emigre groups and the propaganda attacks 
in the Soviet press and radio attempting to 
belittle and thereby diminish any potential 
effectiveness of these groups. 
CAPABILITY OF REGIME TO SUPPRESS 
REVOLT 
10. Any revolt in the Ukraine could be easily 
suppressed by the Soviet regime at the present 
time. The existence of satellite regimes on 
the western borders of the Ukraine has in-
creasingly tended to isolate this earlier hot-
bed of resistance, both materially and morally. 
The ruthless suppression of the Hungarian 
revolt has served as an illuminating example 
of what would happen to a revolt that is not 
materially aided by the West. The existence 
of large numbers of border troops along the 
entire western border of the USSR provides

immediate forces to counter any revolt. In 
addition, Soviet army divisions stationed 
throughout the Ukraine can aid in suppres-
sion of revolts. Zakarpatskaya Oblast ap-
pears to offer the best terrain for possible re-
sistance, but its isolation from the remainder 
of the Ukraine would probably localize any 
revolt. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL UNDER 
CONDITIONS OF PEACE 
11. As long as Soviet police and security con-
trols remain relatively intact, there appears 
to be no prospect for a resumption of active 
resistance in the Ukraine. Barring an inter-
nal upheaval, these controls are likely to re-
main in force for the foreseeable future. Since 
the suppression of the Hungarian revolt, there 
is reportedly little sympathy for a violent 
form of resistance. Instead, sophisticated 
Ukrainian nationalists engage in a subtle form 
of resistance by staying within the bounds of 
the law and officially approved behavior. 
This type of resistance is directed against fur-
ther russification and has as its objective the 
maintenance and fostering of a Ukrainian na-
tional feeling. Apparently it is hoped that 
this nationalism can be kept alive and that 
it will serve as an ideological basis for a free 
Ukraine in the future. Meanwhile, through 
concessions gained by legal methods, life with-
in the Ukraine, although under a Communist 
system, is becoming more tolerable, thus fur-
ther decreasing resistance potential. 
RESISTANCE POTENTIAL IN WAR 
12. In the event of war, Ukrainians would 
probably not try to engage in large-scale re-
sistance activities while Soviet military con-
trols remained in force. They remember the 
tragic results of their resistance to the So-
viet regime during World War II. They would 
be unlikely to commit themselves to resistance 
against the Soviet regime unless they were 
convinced the USSR would lose the war. In 
other words, Ukrainian dissidence could not 
be expected to serve a potential enemy of the 
USSR until the outcome of a war were largely 
determined. In fact, most Ukrainian soldiers 
would probably fight fiercely on the Russian 
side. 
13. As long as security controls remained firm, 
an enemy could expect little or no help from 
the inside. If, however, the political structure 
should begin to crumble under the impact of 
a war, resistance could and might very well 
become active again. Pent-up opposition to 
the Soviet regime could quite naturally be 
channeled into demands for the dismember-
ment of the USSR. The Carpathian moun-
tains on the border of Hungary, Czechoslo-
vakia, and Poland, where Soviet controls are 
less firmly established than elsewhere in the 
Ukraine, would provide a convenient base for 
launching resistance activities in the area. 
Such a move would almost certainly require 
foreign assistance. 
14. The question as to who initiated the war 
probably would matter little, nor would the 
nationality of invading forces, with the ex-
ception of Germans, who almost certainly 
would be fiercely resented even as a part of an 
international force. Their presence on Ukrai-
nian soil would seriously impair the develop-
ment of anti-Communist resistance 
15. While certain resistance activities such as 
intelligence collection or escape and evasion 
operations might be possible on a small scale, 
no large-scale underground movement in the 
Ukraine is likely to gain momentum until So-
viet power had been shaken at its foundations.
