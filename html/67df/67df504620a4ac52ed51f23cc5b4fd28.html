an officer came to his home and asked for a meal, he served him a good 
meal as he was always willing to help .the People's Army. But finding some 
strange traits about him, when the officer bade farewell, saying that he 
had business in the next village, HWANG followed him. 
When HWANG'S 
tent became became clear to the officer, the officer pulled out lila pistol. 
After a struggle, }WANG took the weapon and captured him. 
PAEK Pyong-ok, a member of the Pyongnam Provincial government,' 
also captured two secret agents. Sent on official duty to a mountain 
area, he went into a farm village to sleep. At 12 o'clock two NK People's 
Army soldiers came in, and demanded quarters to sleep. Finding them to

COMMUNIST "CONSTRUCTION" IN RED CHINA 
This article cites official Rad Chinese statistics 
on post-"ilberation" progress in industrial, agri-
cultural, and educational "constructions" as published 
in a North, Korean newspaper. 
When the North Korean communist leaders emphasize their so-
called "faith in victory", they always speak about the unselfish aid of 
the Soviet Union and the brotherly aid of the Peoples Republic of China. 
On such occasions it is their habit to make exaggerations about the indus-
trial capacity of the Soviet Union and the gigantic construction works in 
the Soviet Union. At the Game times they make equal exaggerations 
about the capacity of Red China and the progress in rehabilitation and re-
' construction in Red China.,

The Minchu Chosun (Democratic Korea) of 14 February 1953 
published an article entitled, "The Third Anniversary of the Soviet-China 
Mutual Assistance Treaty." This article emphasized Red Chinas economic 
and educational achievements in order to promote the friendly feelings of 
the North Koreans toward the people of the Soviet Union and Red China and 
to strengthen their faith in victory, The Soviet-China Treaty, according 
to the article, was an epoch-making event in the creating of New China, for 
on the basis of this pact, the Soviet Union has been giving unselfish aid 
to the 500 million Chinese people, enabling them to rehabilitate Chinese 
industry and agriculture, which are the economic foundation of Chinavand 
to undertake their First Five Year Plan in 1953. The article goes on to 
say that in all construction work now in progress in China -- such as ir-
rigation and floo&Control? works on big rivers, construction of the "steel 
city" of Anahan, and railroad construction between Chengtu and Chungking, --
Soviet engineers and experts have participated. 
In the three years after the establishment of Communist China9 
national industrial production, except coal, broke all records of pre 
liberation days. UP to the end of 1952, in comparison with the pre-libe-
ration highest levels, groduction increased as follows t electricity 15% 
petroleum 36%; steel 550; cement 46%; cotton cloth 61%; paper 134% and 
matches 11%. In modern ghina, under the guidance of Soviet experts, many 
modern factories of gigantic capacity are being built in various places." 
Then the article discussed the great reconstruction work in the 
steel-city of Anshan, the new big, modern flax factory in Harbin, and the 
ultra-modern heavy machinery plant in Taiyuan now under construction. 
"In the field of traffic and transportation:, repair work is 
progressing rapidly. The badly damaged railways throughout the country

have been completely repaired to normal functions for-a total mileage of 
14,089 kilometres. Along with these repairs 1,267 kilometres of new rail-
ways have been built. Moreover, in 3.952 the volume of railway transpor-
tation grew by 61 per cent. All highways have been completely repaired 
and new roads have oonnected overland traffic between the frontier regions 
and the heartlands of China." 
? Regarding agriculture, the article declared s 
"In agriculture, equally big results have ben obtained. Except 
in some areas inhabited by minority races, the land reform has been enforced 
among Chinags 450 million farmers whereby the productive ambitions of the 
farmers have been highly elevated together with a rapid increase in agri-
cultural production. For instance, in 1953, by comparison with the highest 
pre-liberatioa leiels, rice and other Cereals and raw cotton production in-
creased by 9% and 55 % respectively." 
The article also discussed the gradual change in farming methods 
from the old. fashioned to the advanced form, particularly in the cooperative 
societies. These cooperative societies ape group labor organizations formed . 
on the basis of private land ownership. They play the role of a directing 
force in propelling the backward, individual and scattered farmers toward 
the modernized group-farm,prodaction method. More than 25 percent of the 
farmers in China have Joined these cooperative societies in which more than 
4,000 agricultural cooperative 'corporations have been organized. Some state-
farms are being operated as an initial step toward the collectivization of 
farming. 
The article Continues 8 
"Despite the requirements of the Anti-American, Aid-Korea Move-
menti the peoples material and cultural welfare show remarkable improvement. 
For instance, in 1951 the people's purchasing power increased by 25 percent 
as compared to 1950, and labor wages were raised by 60 to 120 percent in 
comparison with 1949."

The article also-boasts about the educational and cultural 
changes since .the "liberation': 
"In the winter of 1949 there were only 1309000 students in 
191 universities, 1,270,000 pupils in 52,000 middle schools and?24,200,000 
children in 346,007 elementary schools. During the last three. years, the 
peoplOs education has progressed in leaps and bounds.. At present there 
are 49 million children in elementary schools, more than 3 million pupils 
in middle ethools,and last year Chinese universities taught the highest 
arts of learning to.2190700 students. When compared to 1946 Under the 
regime Of the'Kuomintang these figures dhow increases of 10770 it elemen-
tary school children; 64% in middle, school. and 70% in university 
students respectively." 
The Article also mentions adult-education, which "had made 
gigantic progress among laborers and farmers." 
These exaggerations are probaky not totally groundless and 
false, There are very likely based on facts5to a' certain extent. :Some. 
Japanese Who returned home this spring after long stays in Red China made 
public statements about the Red China they had seen. These statements 
created' a sensation among the Japanese. Of coursel the views on Red Chine, 
were divided into,pro-.: and cons, but the majority of the Japanese returnees 
tried to make an .affirmative evaluation of Red ChinOt efforts and results 
in Ito political, economical and cultural fields, Some of them went far 
in praising the good construction works and, fine discipline in Red China, ? 
in contrast to the impotence and Corruption of the Kuomintang.
