Overview 
China: 
Growing Interest and Problems 
in East Asian Waters 
25X1 
25X1 
The growing demand for oil by East Asian states and the advent of new 
technology capable of exploiting ocean resources at greater depths increased 
the pressure on the littoral states to assert and defend their jurisdictional 
claims and to exploit offshore resources. China in particular has greatly 
increased its offshore activities since the early 1970s, and it has broad and 
longstanding claims to the continental shelf, the islands, and the archipela-
gos of East Asia. These areas are disputed variously by Japan, South Korea, 
the Government on Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. 25X1 
China's growing demands for the resources believed present on the shelf and 
its increasing technological capability to exploit them could sharpen 
territorial disputes over the next three to five years. Conflict is unlikely, 
however, so long as good relations with the United States, Japan, and the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)' remain Beijing's major 
diplomatic objectives. A desire to cultivate friendly relations with these 
countries and a need to avoid greater friction with South Korea and the 
Government on Taiwan will cause China to take a nonconfrontational 
approach to its sweeping claims. Furthermore, China's concern over 
increased Soviet naval strength in East Asian waters and the evolving 
Soviet-Vietnamese relationship has reinforced Beijing's desire to develop 
stronger ties with the United States, Japan, and ASEAN. China's 
continuing imbroglio with Vietnam will increase the volatility of the 
disputes over the Gulf of Tonkin sea boundary and the South China Sea 
islands. 
25X1 
China has gradually increased its naval, merchant marine, and offshore oil 
operations, making East Asian waters and waterways more significant in the 
conduct of Chinese foreign trade and in the pursuit of Chinese strategic 
goals. China considers the development of its oil industry a top priority, 
especially the need to develop its potentially rich offshore petroleum 
resources to offset declining rates of production from onshore wells. 
25X1 
China has built up its international merchant fleet in the last several years. 
As this fleet grows, Beijing will become increasingly concerned with 
guaranteeing free access through the principal sea lanes in East Asia. 
Moreover, other Law-of-the-Sea issues, such as freedom of the high seas, 
passage through straits, and secure transit routes will become more 
' ASEAN's members are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.

important to China as its commercial relations with the rest of the world 
expand. As China enhances its capabilities to conduct distant fishing 
operations, it will become a more important voice in regional fishing 
matters. In the past three years, Beijing has begun to modernize its fleet and 
fishing practices in order to exploit fishing grounds farther from shore. 
In keeping with China's growing interest in offshore resources, the Chinese 
Navy is undergoing a transition from a coastal force to a deep water one. 
The Navy at present can conduct coastal defense operations up to 300 
nautical miles from the eastern edge of the East China Sea, which gives it a 
military reach to the Senkaku and Paracel Islands; the Spratly Islands can 
only be reached by large combatants and submarines. 
China has long championed increased coastal state control over the world's 
seas and has instituted a number of measures to maximize its ocean claims. 
Indeed, Beijing has participated actively in the Law-of-the-Sea Confer-
ences, strongly supporting the position of the Third World countries on a 
variety of issues while denouncing exploitation of ocean resources to the 
detriment of the developing countries. As Chinese activities in East Asian 
waters grow, however, Beijing may find it difficult to balance its support for 
the Third World's position with its desire to safeguard Chinese national 
interests.

China: 
Growing Interest and Problems 
in East Asian Waters 
Part I 
Political Context 
China has sweeping territorial and jurisdictional 
claims to the East Asian continental shelf as Well as the 
islands and archipelagos in East Asian waters (see 
foldout map 1, appended). At least five other govern-
ments have claims that overlap China's. Although 
China has shown little interest in negotiating a 
resolution to these claims, political considerations and 
technological constraints have caused Beijing to take a 
cautious and cooperative approach in exploiting poten-
tial resources in disputed areas. China's present 
emphasis on economic modernization and cultivation 
of good relations with countries such as Japan and the 
United States assure that, at least over the short term, 
Beijing will prefer a nonconfrontation approach to-
ward its territorial claims in East Asia. China's desire 
to prevent the Soviet Union from making inroads into 
East Asia, and its corollary desire to isolate Moscow's 
client state Vietnam, also impel it at present to 
cultivate good relations with non-Communist Asian 
nations, particularly Japan and those in Southeast 
Asia. 
At the same time, however, China's growing demands 
for the resources believed present on the continental 
shelf and its increasing technological capability to 
exploit these resources will create the conditions for an 
adversary relationship with these same countries, 
particularly if significant oil reserves are discovered. 
Over the next three to five years, China's naval and 
maritime capability, although much improved, will 
remain modest, and this will tend to reinforce its 
preference for a noncombative approach toward terri-
torial claims. As China's need and capability grow, 
however, the conflict between its economic interests 
and political goals in East Asia will sharpen. Beijing 
will have to decide whether to pursue its national 
territorial claims in East Asian waters more aggres-
sively at the risk of jeopardizing its good relations with 
the non-Communist states. 
1 
25X1 
China-Japan 
China considers the cultivation of cooperative relations 
with Japan one of its highest priorities. For at least the 
immediate future, this will determine Beijing's ap-
proach to territorial claims not only in the East China 
Sea where Japan is a major claimant, but also in the 
Yellow Sea where China's claims conflict with those of 
an important Japanese partner, South Korea (see maps 
2 and 3). 25X1 
Japan is China's most important trading partner. Sino-
Japanese trade totaled more than $5 billion in 1978 
and, according to the provisions of their Long Term 
Agreement, should increase considerably. Japan is the 
largest purchaser of Chinese crude oil-60 percent of 
China's total exports?but, more important, Tokyo is 
the major source for the advanced equipment and 
technology Beijing needs for its ambitious moderniza-
tion program. China considers a close relationship the 
key to obtaining this technology on preferential terms. 
25X1 
Japan's political importance to China will increase as25X1 
China seeks to counter the expanding Soviet presence 
in East Asia. China perceives its developing relation-
ship with Japan as an important counterbalance to 
Soviet and Vietnamese ambitions. Beijing believes an 
identity of interests based on opposition to the USSR is 
proved by Japan's willingness to sign the implicitly 
anti-Soviet Peace and Friendship Treaty with China in 
August 1978. Chinese leaders undoubtedly hope that 
Japan can be further induced to favor Beijing at the 
expense of Moscow's interests in East Asia. 
25X1 
In view of China's substantial equities in maintaining 
good relations with Japan, Beijing will probably 
continue to try to avoid serious confrontation over 
contested claims in the East China Sea, both the area 
near the Senkaku Islands north of Taiwan and the 25X1

Japan - South Korea Joint Development Zone south-
east of the Japanese island of Kyushu. Two different 
events indicate the way Beijing's interest in good 
relations with Japan influence its handling of territo-
rial claims. In 1972, China made it clear that the US-
Japan reversion agreement transferring the Ryukyus 
to Japanese jurisdiction in no way prejudiced China's 
longstanding claim to the Senkakus, which are a part 
of the Ryukyus. Nonetheless, Beijing did not let the 
issue interfere with its diplomatic priority of 
normalizing relations with Japan, which occurred later 
that year. In April 1978, more than 200 armed Chinese 
fishing boats intruded into waters around the 
Senkakus in a brief revival of the territorial dispute, 
but this did not prevent Beijing and Tokyo from 
signing a Peace and Friendship Treaty in August, a 
much more important objective from China's 
viewpoint because of its importance to China's diplo-
matic competition with the USSR. Chinese Vice 
Premier Deng Xiaoping, moreover, assured the Japa-
nese at the time of the signing of the treaty that such an 
"incident" would not occur again. 
China has, in fact, proposed a joint development 
program with Japan for exploiting the presumed oil 
and gas deposits offshore near the Senkakus. China 
offered to set aside territorial differences, but it did not 
offer to negotiate a resolution of them. Tokyo did not 
rule out a joint Sino-Japanese venture but countered 
with a three-way development project proposal that 
would involve Chinese, Japanese, and American oil 
companies and would arrange for Taipei, another 
claimant to the area, to receive some of the proceeds. 
Japan's growing energy needs will probably increase 
the pressure to expand exploratory activities near the 
Senkakus substantially. China would undoubtedly try 
to exert strong diplomatic pressure on Tokyo, but 
although it might hint at economic sanctions, Beijing 
would be unlikely to jeopardize its important trade 
relationship with Tokyo. Military threats would be 
even less likely. Beijing's capability at present to take 
direct action in the disputed area is limited; to send 
Chinese ships to the disputed area would risk creating 
a public political issue in Tokyo that could work 
against broader Chinese interests. 
Secret 
China-Korea 
China's desire to preserve political stability on the 
Korean peninsula as well as its interest in close ties 
with Japan greatly influences Beijing's approach to 
jurisdictional disputes with South Korea. China pub-
licly supports Pyongyang's basic foreign policy objec-
tives, but privately favors a continued US military 
presence in South Korea as a stabilizing force. South 
Korea's close relationships with the United States and 
Japan minimize the potential for conflict between 
China and South Korea. On the other hand, China's 
desire to maintain good relations with North Korea 
will prevent it from negotiating with South Korea for 
demarcation of a sea boundary and/or fishing agree-
ments in the southern Yellow Sea. 
China's strong desire to stay on good terms with Japan 
works to South Korea's benefit, particularly with 
regard to disputes over the area encompassed by the 
Japan-Korea Joint Development Zone. A Chinese 
challenge against South Korean activity in the zone 
would adversely affect Sino-Japanese relations. As 
long as China desires to maintain friendly relations 
with Japan, it will probably not seriously challenge 
Seoul. An oil discovery in the zone would certainly 
trigger a Chinese protest against Japanese and Korean 
activity, but there is little pressure that China could 
bring to bear on either Tokyo or Seoul. Concern about 
China's reaction, however, has contributed to Japanese 
reluctance to move rapidly in exploiting resources in 
the zone. 
Farther north, between the Korean and Shandong 
peninsulas, the situation is more complex. China 
clearly intends to conduct exploratory drilling in the 
Yellow Sea, but for the time being it is confining its 
operations to China's side of a hypothetical equidistant 
line. If this exploration proves fruitful and an oilfield 
appears to extend farther east, the Chinese may push 
gradually across the line. China probably would do this 
cautiously and only after it conducted a number of 
tentative probes designed to test US and South Korean 
sensitivities. The Koreans are not exploring on their 
side of the equidistant line.

omirt 
The discovery of a considerable amount of oil in the 
Joint Development Zone could change the situation in 
the Yellow Sea. A discovery in the zone would increase 
China's interest in granting concessions in contested 
areas of the Yellow Sea, but Seoul probably would be 
in a better position to control those waters. 
Incidents have occurred between China and South 
Korean fishing fleets in the Yellow Sea, although 
Seoul has tried to avoid provoking Beijing. It has not 
sent armed boats to protest its fishing fleet and has 
tried to keep South Korean boats from interfering with 
Chinese fishing operations. China has ignored South 
Korean calls for joint consultations on fishery matters 
and maritime incidents in the southern Yellow Sea will 
probably continue. Neither "side, however, is likely to 
do anything that will cause serious tension in the area. 
China - Government on Taiwan 
Both Beijing and Taipei claim to represent the 
legitimate Government of China, and it is therefore 
virtually impossible to resolve their overlapping territo-
rial and jurisdictional claims. The desire to cultivate 
closer relations with the United States inhibits Beijing 
from acting aggressively vis-a-vis Taipei, and both 
Beijing and Taipei have thus far avoided any develop-
mental operations in areas of particular sensitivity. 
Taipei's failure to locate significant quantities of 
offshore oil improves the prospect for stability. Despite 
many years of exploration by foreign companies and by 
Taiwan's state-controlled Chinese Petroleum Corpora-
tion, no significant finds have been made. Much of the 
test-drilling has been concentrated off Kao-hsiung, but 
during the past year the Chinese Petroleum Company 
has also been active northwest of the Pescadores within 
a few miles of the hypothetical equidistant line of the 
Straits of Taiwan. Extensive seismic studies and some 
exploration in waters north of Taiwan have also been 
disappointing. 
China shows no indication that it intends to prospect 
for oil on its side of the Straits or in Taipei-designated 
concessions areas to the north or west of the island. 
China's general lack of interest has probably been 
reinforced by Taiwan's failure to discover commercial 
amounts of petroleum. Geologically the strata become 
5 
thinner closer to the mainland, thereby reducing the 
chances of a find. 25X1 
Beijing probably will tolerate Taiwanese drilling ac-
tivities as long as they are confined to Taiwan's side of 
the hypothetical equidistant line. If oil is discovered, 25X1 
however, China certainly would protest and probably 
would begin its own exploratory operations in the 
waters off Fujian. Beijing would be unlikely to attempt 
to cross the de facto division line in the Straits unless it 
believed that Taipei would not or could not challenge 
its actions. 25X1 
China-Vietnam 
China sees Vietnam as a rival for influence in 
Southeast Asia, and as an ally of the USSR intent 
upon pursuing anti-Chinese policies. The deep-rooted 
animosity between China and Vietnam led to the 25X1 
Chinese invasion of Vietnam in February-March 1979. 
Their jurisdictional and territorial disputes in the Gulf 
of Tonkin and in the South China Sea thus became 
part of the larger conflict (maps 4 and 5). 
25X1 
Not only are both countries arch enemies, but each has 
ambitious offshore development programs intended to 
enhance its military power as well as obtain much-
needed resources. As matters now stand, no improve-
ment in Sino-Vietnamese relations is foreseeable, and 25X1 
the oil potential and strategic location of the contested 
areas heighten the potential for conflict in the Gulf of 
Tonkin and the South China Sea. 25X1 
The question of who has jurisdiction in the Gulf of 25X1 
Tonkin, an area with great oil potential, constitutes the 
major dispute between China and Vietnam relating to 
offshore activity. China has already conducted seismic 
surveys and drilled several test wells) 
China withdrew its drilling rigs to safer, but presum-
ably less promising, water near Hainan Island at the 
start of the Sino-Vietnamese war in February 1979. 
China clearly intends to proceed with its development 
plans, however, for it signed contracts with US and 
European companies to conduct further seismic studies 
in the Tonkin Gulf west and south of Hainan. Hanoi 
warned Beijing recently to halt exploratory activities in 
the Gulf.

Secret 
China's oil prospecting in the Gulf could lead to a 
military showdown with Vietnam. At present, Beijing 
has two rigs engaged in exploration work positioned 
fairly close to the hypothetical equidistant line.2 If 
China were to make a significant find in the Gulf near 
the line, the potential for conflict would grow. Vietnam 
might seek to defend its claims in the Gulf by 
deploying greater naval forces. China's reaction would 
depend on the general level of tension between the two 
countries at the time and on the particular way in 
which Hanoi tried to assert its claim. Although conflict 
would not be inevitable, both sides undoubtedly would 
be hard-nosed. 
Unlike China's other offshore disputes, those involving 
the Tonkin Gulf bear directly on Chinese security 
concerns and lie within an area where China enjoys 
military superiority. Vietnam's Navy is no match for 
the Chinese forces, and Hanoi would be hard-pressed 
to defend militarily its extensive claims. Vietnam, 
however, probably would rely on the continuing 
presence of Soviet naval ships in the South China Sea 
to restrict China's freedom of action against Vietnam-
ese interests. 
Vietnam and China are also in conflict over the 
Paracel Islands, which China seized from the former 
Saigon government in a naval and air attack in early 
1974, and the Spratly Islands. Vietnam cannot chal-
lenge Chinese control of the Paracels because its naval 
forces are inferior to those of China. Hanoi will not 
abandon its claim to them, however, and may hope

and a keystone in its policy efforts to minimize

China and Vietnam disagree over the use of Dao Bach Long Vi as a

Singapore, and Thailand. 
Secret 
tions China's assertion of its territorial claims in the 
Spratly Islands, which Vietnam, the Philippines, and 
Taiwan also claim. 
Vietnamese troops occupy six of the Spratly Islands, 
and Hanoi may expand this presence gradually to 
other islets in the next few years in anticipation of or in 
response to moves by Beijing and Manila. Beijing 
might decide to try to counter moves by Vietnam by a 
show of force in the area or perhaps by garrisoning 
some unoccupied islets to prevent Vietnamese control 
of them. China probably would not threaten areas 
claimed by Manila 
Despite these apprehensions, Beijing probably would 
not be willing to risk military engagement of the 
Vietnamese in the Spratlys. The Chinese would be 
hard-pressed to provide air support for their naval 
ships at such a distance from the mainland. Although 
Beijing's naval capability far exceeds that of Hanoi's, 
it is doubtful that it could be amassed in sufficient 
strength to compensate for a virtual lack of air cover. 
China's desire to strengthen bilateral relations with 
Manila will decrease the potential for serious Sino-
Philippine conflict over the Spratlys. China has shown 
a keen interest in expanding trade with Manila, 
particularly in crude oil. Since 1974, the Philippines 
has purchased most of China's Shengli crude exports. 
Last year, Manila agreed to import 6 million tons of 
Chinese crude over the next five years. Although in 
absolute terms the total volume is not great, it 
nevertheless places Manila second only to Japan as a 
market for Chinese oil. No doubt the Chinese also find 
the growth potential attractive. 
As Beijing renews its efforts to offset Soviet influence 
in the region, its relations with Manila are taking on 
added importance. A serious confrontation over 
disputed claims would not only jeopardize promising 
bilateral ties but would heighten suspicions of China 
among other ASEAN countries, particularly Singa-
pore and Indonesia, which have yet to respond to 
China's efforts to normalize relations. Over the next 
few years, Manila will certainly increase its explora-
tory drilling near the Reed Bank and may send

Secret 
garrisons to additional islets in the Spratlys.4 These 
developments, or a possible oil discovery by the 
Philippines off Reed Bank, may spur Beijing to 
establish a presence in the area to reinforce its claims. 
If Hanoi granted the Soviets some form of base rights 
in Vietnam or on a Vietnamese-controlled island in the 
Spratlys, China would be doubly concerned. As their 
own maritime and naval capability grows, the Chinese 
have shown greater interest in the security of Asian sea 
lanes. 
Over the next five years, Chinese concern about the 
future of the Spratlys could strain Sino-Philippine 
relations. To what extent this occurs depends largely 
on where and how the two sides press competing claims 
in that area. The Reed Bank is much more sensitive 
from Manila's perspective than the rest of the Spratlys, 
and if China sent military patrols to assert its claims, 
this would be more discomfiting to Manila than would 
be the case if only oceanographic ships visited. Both 
sides, however, have good reason to prevent the 
competition from escalating into a serious confronta-
tion which could jeopardize growing bilateral ties or 
open the door to greater Vietnamese or Soviet influ-
ence. 
Prospects 
China obviously would like to extend as much as 
possible its control over all the areas of the continental 
shelf to which it believes it has historic or legal claims. 
During the next few years, China will attempt to 
enhance its position by sending naval, research, and 
fishing vessels into contested areas. 
China will probably continue to avoid negotiating its 
claims because it believes it does not yet have the 
needed leverage. In seeking to assert its position in the 
contested waters, China probably will be careful not to 
provoke strong reactions from rival claimants, retain-
ing the flexibility to withdraw if necessary. Nonethe-
less, Chinese probes in the offshore areas inevitably 
' Manila recently published a presidential decree annexing some of 
the Spratly Islands. 
will create friction between Beijing and the other 
claimants. China probably hopes the close ties being 
forged with Japan and the Philippines will keep 
irritations from affecting those relationships. Beijing is 
not concerned about the effects of disputed claims on 
its relations with Taiwan or South Korea, but it will 
nonetheless avoid open hostility toward Taipei and 
Seoul because of its interest in maintaining good 
relations with the United States. The disputed claims 
with Vietnam, on the other hand, could lead to military 
conflict, particularly in the Gulf of Tonkin, where the 
claims have a security as well as an economic aspect for 
China. 
China's growing economic and military interests in 
East Asian waters may eventually undermine Beijing's 
present nonconfrontational approach toward most 
territorial disputes. A successful economic moderniza-
tion program will not only make the exploitation of 
offshore resources more necessary but also will provide 
the technological and military capability to exploit and 
protect them. Growing demand for oil and the advent 
of new technology capable of exploiting ocean re-
sources at greater depths will increase the pressure on 
all the littoral states to assert and defend their 
jurisdictional claims. 
Discovery of major oil reserves offshore in the disputed 
areas will add a new dimension to the territorial claims 
issue and make resolution of them more urgent?and 
also more difficult. As a major Asian power, China's 
position as claimant to the shelf inevitably affects the 
development programs of the other littoral states, 
making them reluctant to proceed too far until they are 
certain how China will react. All these states are 
energy short, however, and if oil is discovered on the 
shelf, China would come under increased pressure to 
negotiate demarcation or risk destroying the good 
diplomatic relations it has achieved?relations which 
are critical to its strategic objectives vis-a-vis the 
USSR.

Secret 
China: 
Growing Interest and Problems 
in East Asian Waters 
Part II 
Economic Maritime Factors 
China has greatly increased its offshore activities since 
the early 1970s. It has intensified its oil development 
program near the coast and has conducted surveys and 
exploratory drilling farther from the coast. Growing 
naval, fishing, and merchant marine operations have 
made East Asian waters and waterways more impor-
tant for China in the conduct of its trade and pursuit of 
its strategic goals. 
Offshore Oil Development 
China considers the development of its oil industry a 
top priority, but, in particular, it needs to develop its 
potentially rich offshore petroleum resources to offset 
declining rates of production from onshore wells. Oil 
exports are an important source of foreign exchange to 
finance China's economic development. Domestic oil 
consumption will grow as industry and agriculture 
expand, reducing the amount of exports. China can 
enhance its own capabilities for offshore drilling by 
purchasing foreign equipment and technology, but it 
will also need to cooperate with foreign companies in 
joint projects. 
China began offshore exploration in the late 1960s in 
the shallow waters of the Bo Hai, and by 1978 three 
platforms were producing oil. In the early 1970s, the 
Chinese began exploring areas in the East China and 
South China Seas; they have drilled wells off the 
eastern coast of the Leizhou Peninsula, at the mouth of 
the Pearl River estuary, and in the Gulf of Tonkin. 
China has purchased foreign equipment and technol-
ogy, but technical difficulties, financial constraints, 
and shortages of trained personnel have hampered the 
offshore program. 
Recognizing that it will have to cooperate with foreign 
firms to develop potential offshore oil resources, China 
has contracted with foreign companies for seismic 
studies and will permit open bidding for production 
contracts once the geophysical data have been as-
11 
25X1 
sessed.5 Except for the work in the Bo Hai, the foreign 
companies will have to explore offshore at their own 
expense and will be compensated only if they find oil. 
This approach allows development without expending 
China's scarce capital. China recently signed an 
agreement with the Japan National Oil Corporation to 
develop oil resources in the Bo Hai?where shallow 
depths could be easily drilled by Japanese compan- 25X1 
ies?while assigning to US and European companies 
areas in the Yellow and South China Seas?where the 
technological demands are greater. Even if oil is 
discovered in commercial quantities, it would probably 
take at least 10 years to attain large-scale production 
of offshore crude. 
25X1 
Merchant Fleet 
China has built up its international merchant fleet in 
the last several years, and as this fleet grows, Beijing 
will become increasingly concerned with guaranteeing 
free access through the principal sea lanes in East 
Asia. Moreover, other Law-of-the-Sea issues, such as 
freedom of the high seas, passage through straits, and 25x1 
secure transit routes will become more important to 
China as its commercial relations with the rest of the 
world expand. 25X1 
China's international fleet has grown since the early 
1970s, and its composition has changed dramatically. 
General purpose dry cargo ships accounted for much of 
the fleet in 1973, but subsequently Beijing has shifted 
emphasis to bulk carriers. Such ships constituted about 
80 percent of total acquisitions in 1978, probably 
reflecting China's need to transport large quantities of 
grain imports. In coming years, China is likely to 25X1 
concentrate on expanding its tanker fleet to handle 
growing oil exports. China built two small tankers i25x1 
1978 and plans to build 10 more, totaling 225,000 
deadweight tons, over the next few years. 
China signed agreements with British and French companies to 
conduct a seismic study of the Yellow Sea and with six US 
companies to do so in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Tonkin.

Secret 
Fishing 
China has a large offshore fishing fleet but cannot at 
present conduct extended fishing operations at sea. As 
China acquires this capability, it will become a more 
important voice in regional fishing matters. In the past 
three years, Beijing has begun to modernize its fleet 
and fishing practices to exploit fishing grounds farther 
from shore. Since 1976, China has bought more than 
25 refrigerated transports and factory ships from 
Japan and has begun producing similar ships at home. 
China has also markedly increased the size and 
sophistication of its fishing boats. 
China's distant water fishing fleet not only enables it to 
increase its total catch but also allows China to assert a 
presence in areas over which it claims jurisdiction. For 
example, China has conducted large-scale fishing 
operations in the waters around the Paracel and 
Spratly Islands in recent months. 
Secret 
Naval Expansion 
In keeping with China's growing interest in offshore 
resources, its Navy is changing from a coastal force to 
one capable of deep-water operations. The Navy can 
now conduct coastal defense operations up to 300 
nautical miles 6 from the eastern edge of the continen-
tal shelf, which provides a military reach to the  
Senkaku and Paracel Islands. 
6 Throughout this paper, distances are reported in nautical miles, 
hereafter referred to as miles.

China: 
Growing Interest and Problems 
in East Asian Waters 
Part III 
Staking and Asserting National Claims 
China has long championed increased coastal state 
control over the world's seas and has instituted a 
number of measures to maximize its ocean claims. In 
1958, the Chinese Government established a straight 
baseline system and claimed a 12-mile territorial sea 
(see map 1). The declaration also asserted Chinese 
sovereignty over, and established territorial seas 
around, Taiwan, the Spratly and Paracel Island 
groups, and numerous shoals and underwater reefs 
throughout the South China Sea.' Beijing has pub-
lished a number of maps that place its international 
boundary line as far south as the continental shelf of 
Malaysian Borneo. This line does not delineate a 
territorial sea claim but merely encircles all Chinese-
claimed island groups. 
The need to maintain a consistent legal basis for its 
claims causes the Chinese Government some difficulty 
in maximizing its claims to ocean resources. China's 
claims to the shelf are based on the natural prolonga-
tion principle?that the continental shelf is the sea-
ward extension of the Chinese mainland and, there-
fore, under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Govern-
ment. Using this principle, China claims rights over 
the Yellow and East China Sea shelves up to the 
periphery of the Korean peninsula and the Ryukyu 
islands 
China has never declared a 200-mile exclusive eco-
nomic zone, even though it vigorously supports such 
declarations by Third World countries. Declaring such 
a zone around its southern coastline and South China 
Sea islands would increase potential Chinese control 
over the narrow-shelved South China Sea, but it would 
undercut its claims to the Yellow and East China Sea 
shelves. Fear of prejudicing its shelf claims also 
prevents China from declaring even a 200-mile exclu-
sive fishing zone, although China restricts foreign

Senkaku Islands, called the Diaoyu Tai by China and claimed by 
China, Japan, and the Government on Taiwan. 
13 
25X1 
fishing, particularly by the Japanese, in a large area of 
the Yellow and East China Seas. Increased concern 
about the depletion of its fishery stocks, however, could 
lead Beijing to opt for some form of broad or extended 
fishery zone. 25X1 
China also imposes navigational restrictions on foreign 
ships operating in Chinese waters. Beijing has created 
a military warning zone in the Bo Hai, which cannot be 
entered without prior permission, and a military 
operations zone north of Taiwan where foreign fishing 
vessels venture at their own risk. These restrictions, 
established solely for security reasons, have no 
precedent in international law. 
25X1 
25X1 
Law of the Sea 
China has participated actively in Law-of-the-Sea 
Conferences, strongly supporting the position of the 
Third World countries on a variety of issues while 
denouncing the superpowers, especially the Soviets, for 
exploiting ocean resources to the detriment of the 
developing countries. 25X1 
China supports measures that will ensure strict control 
of all activities, other than navigation and overflight, in 
ocean areas beyond the territorial sea. These include: 
? Complete coastal state sovereignty and the right of 
innocent passage in the territorial sea, including 
international straits that lie within the territorial sea. 
? Coastal state ownership and management of the 
coastal state economic zone, with perhaps some 
sharing of management and benefits with adjacent 
landlocked and shelf-locked states. 
? Maximum international control of the areas beyond 
coastal state jurisdiction through an international 
system in which all nations have an equal voice and 
through which revenues derived from the exploita-
tion of the seabed will be shared equally by all 
nations.

3ecret 
As the range and scope of China's activities in East 
Asian waters grow, however, Beijing may find it 
difficult to balance its support for the Third World's 
position with its desire to safeguard Chinese national 
interests. 
Yellow Sea 
Politically divided Korea creates problems for China in 
delimiting its boundary in the Yellow Sea (see map 2). 
Although China and North Korea have apparently 
agreed on a boundary in the northern Yellow Sea, the 
boundary in the southern part will remain in dispute 
unless a major change occurs in Beijing's policy toward 
South Korea. China claims the continental shelf on the 
basis of the natural prolongation principle, but it has 
not specified its claims in the Yellow Sea, which is a 
semienclosed body of water warranting negotiations 
among the involved states in order to divide it on an 
equitable basis. China, however, has established a 
military warning zone and fishery protection zones in 
the Yellow Sea, conducted seismic surveys, and signed 
contracts with European companies for oil exploration 
predominantly on the Chinese side of a hypothetical 
equidistant line. 
China's military warning zone does not necessarily 
represent the maximum extent of its jurisdictional 
claim to the northern Yellow Sea. Such a zone has no 
basis in international law, but Beijing and Pyongyang 
seemed to have agreed on respective areas of jurisdic-
tion. The western limits of North Korean patrols in the 
Yellow Sea correspond closely with the eastern bound-
ary of China's military warning zone.' 
The southern Yellow Sea, which is disputed between 
China and South Korea, has been the scene of 
numerous incidents involving fishing and petroleum 
exploration. In 1952, South Korea established the 
Rhee Line and claimed sovereignty over all economic 
resources in a large area around the entire Korean 
peninsula. In 1970, Seoul issued the Submarine 
Mineral Resources Development Law and estab-
lished?by presidential decree?a median-line limit 
for seven seabed mining blocks in the Yellow and East 
China Seas, which superseded the claims based on the 
Rhee Line. 
In 1977, Pyongyang announced the establishment of a military 
warning zone and a 200-mile exclusive economic zone off both coasts 
but has not specified the zones' boundaries in the Yellow Sea. 
Secret 
China protested South Korea's actions and sent lightly 
armed Chinese fishing boats into the area to harass 
seismic surveying. A Korean-US consortium sus-
pended operations in 1971, but the Gulf Oil Company, 
ignoring the Chinese warnings, began drilling in 1973 
only 175 miles off the coast of Shanghai. The Chinese 
repeated their protest and dispatched Komar-class 
gunboats to the area. In response, and at the urging of 
Washington, Gulf Oil gradually terminated its oper-
ations. 
Since 1975, China has conducted its own seismic 
survey in the Yellow Sea to the east and northeast of 
Shanghai?areas close to the hypothetical Sino - South 
Korean equidistant line. It has also signed agreements 
with foreign companies for further exploration. Seoul 
has repeatedly offered to negotiate the delimitation of 
the continental shelf in the Yellow and East China 
Seas, but to no avail. For the time being, both Beijing 
and Seoul will probably confine their exploratory 
activities to areas falling on their respective sides of a 
hypothetical equidistant line. 
Numerous incidents have also occurred between China 
and South Korean fishing fleets over the years. 
Chinese vessels, often armed or escorted by patrol 
boats, have seized South Korean boats, detained crews, 
and confiscated their catch and equipment. All the 
incidents have occurred in China's Fishery Protection 
Area 1 between the Korean island of Sohuksan and the 
Chinese mainland. This protection area is partially on 
the Korean side of a hypothetical equidistant line and 
partially within South Korean continental shelf claims 
in the East China Sea. 
East China Sea 
Two divided nations and Japan are competing to 
exploit the resources of the East China Sea (see map 
3). Oil is the primary impetus behind the dispute. The 
extent of the oil reserves beneath the East China Sea 
remains unproved, but no significant test-drilling has 
occurred in the most geologically promising areas. 
China, Japan, North and South Korea, and the 
Government on Taiwan all claim parts of the East 
China Sea, but the disputes focus on the Senkaku 
Islands and the South Korea - Japan Joint Develop-
ment Zone.' 
'North Korea, because of its claim to represent the only legitimate 
government of Korea, has a theoretical claim to the East China Sea, 
although it has not played an important role in the dispute.

The Senkaku Islands have little intrinsic value, but 
their ownership is crucial to determining jurisdiction 
over much of the shelf and, hence, the right to exploit 
petroleum reserves thought to exist there.' Jurisdiction 
over thousands of square kilometers of the shelf may 
depend not only on a determination of the ownership of 
these islands, but also on the effect given them in a 
shelf division. Before the shelf boundary issue can be 
settled, the sovereignty issue must be resolved. 
Japan claims that the Senkakus are part of the Ryukyu 
Island chain. Tokyo points out that the United States 
administered the Ryukyu Islands (including the 
Senkakus) after World War II, but returned them to 
Japanese administration on 15 May 1972. Since 
reversion, Japan has been responsible for defense of the 
Ryukyus?including the Senkakus. The Japanese Self 
Defense Force generally leaves coverage of the 
disputed islands to the Civil Maritime Safety Agency, 
which makes occasional patrols around them. 
Publicly, Tokyo considers the Senkakus issue settled, 
but its operations on the shelf near the Senkakus have 
been cautious. Japan, South Korea, and the Govern-
ment on Taiwan established a committee in 1970 to 
discuss cooperation in developing potential oil and 
natural gas resources in the East China Sea, but Tokyo 
quickly ended the discussions once Beijing publicly 
asserted its claims. Japan has approved no concessions 
south of the 29th parallel and holds in abeyance 
applications for oil exploratory licenses and other 
projects in the immediate vicinity of the islands. Tokyo 
recently conducted scientific surveys of the islands and 
their surrounding waters and has begun sea patrols in 
the area. 
The Government on Taiwan and China cite practically 
identical historical and legal evidence to support their 
contention that the Senkakus never rightfully belonged 
to Japan and that reversion did not prejudice their 
claims. In December 1970, Beijing reasserted China's 
historical claims over the Senkaku Islands. In early 
1972, just four months before the planned reversion of 
the Ryukyus to Japan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry 
said that the US-Japan reversion agreement would not 
alter China's claims of sovereignty. 
I? The Senkaku Islands are a small group of uninhabited, largely 
barren islets on the eastern margin of the East Asian continental 
shelf. Until the publicity about possible petroleum deposits in the 
East China Sea based on a 1968 UN survey, the Senkakus were  
virtually unknown and seldom shown on maps of the area. 
Japan and South Korea have created a Joint Develop-
ment Zone in an area of the East China Sea where they 
and China have overlapping claims. Tokyo and Seoul 
agreed in 1974 to ignore their differences and cooper-
ate in the development of oil and natural gas resources. 
Despite Beijing's protests, they established a boundary 
in the northern part of the continental shelf and 
marked off a joint zone of about 83,000 square 
kilometers west of the Japanese island of Kyushu. 25X1 
Seoul ratified the agreement soon after the signing, but 
Tokyo delayed ratification until June 1977 and did not 
pass the enabling legislation until June 1978. The 
companies to conduct the operations in the various 
subzones were not chosen until March 1979, with 
exploratory drilling planned for spring 1980. 
Japan's reluctance stems largely from concern about 25X1 
the Chinese reaction, even though the zone is on the 
Japanese side of a hypothetical equidistant line with 
China. When the Japanese Diet ratified the treaty, 25X1 
China reiterated its own claims to the area and 
threatened to impose economic sanctions against 
Japan. China further alarmed the Japanese in May 
1978 when it dispatched a marine research ship to the 
southern part of the joint development zone to rein-
force its claims. Chinese Vice Premier Li Xiannian 
warned, moreover, that China would take "concrete" 
action if exploration activities began. 
A dispute between Beijing and Taipei over offshore 
jurisdiction in the East China Sea flared in 1970 
(see map 3). Taipei proclaimed five seabed reserve 
areas extending to the Chinese mainland, granted 
concessions to foreign oil companies, and actively 
promoted drilling activities in sharply contested areas 
near the Senkaku Islands and in the Taiwan Straits. 
With foreign oil companies exploring the East China 
Sea only 40 to 50 miles from China's coast and with 
Taipei, Seoul, and Tokyo discussing cooperative ocean 
development, Beijing issued the first major statement 
of its claims to the East Asian continental shelf since 
1958. China warned that activities by others in these 
areas constituted an infringement of Chinese sover-
eignty that would not be tolerated and sent a Komar25X1 
class missile attack boat to the area to back up the 
statements. Washington said it would not protect US  
oil companies operating in the disputed waters.

Despite Beijing's admonition and Washington's hands-
off policy, serveral US companies as well as Taiwan's 
Chinese Petroleum Corporation have drilled at least 40 
wells off Taiwan's coast since 1973. Although one well 
about 55 miles west of Gaoxiung produced a gas flow, 
subsequent drilling in that immediate area failed to 
provide any evidence of a field. By 1976, increasingly 
hostile statements from Beijing, interest in offshore oil 
deals with China, and discouraging results from 
drilling caused US oil companies to suspend their 
contracts with Taipei indefinitely. Only the Taiwan 
company continues to conduct exploratory operations, 
but it has confined operations to the Taiwan side of a 
hypothetical median line in both the East China Sea 
and in the Taiwan Straits. 
South China Sea 
China's search for offshore oil, its strategic goals, and 
its regional ambitions have involved it in several 
territorial and jurisdictional disputes in the South 
China Sea (see map 4). In addition to its disputed 
boundary with Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin, Chinese 
claims to the Pratas, Paracel, and Spratly Islands are a 
potential source of conflict with the Government on 
Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. 
A longstanding jurisdictional conflict between China 
and Vietnam over their sea boundary in the Gulf of 
Tonkin (map 5) became a public dispute after Sino-
Vietnamese relations sharply deteriorated in 1978-79. 
This dispute is significant because it involves thou-
sands of square kilometers, not only possibly rich in oil, 
but also strategically important. 
Beijing and Hanoi published their respective positions 
on the Gulf of Tonkin sea boundary as well as on the 
Paracel and Spratly Islands in Foreign Ministry 
memorandums in March 1979. Vietnam's memoran-
dum made public for the first time the extent of 
Hanoi's claims in the Gulf. These claims are based on 
the 1887 Sino-French boundary convention, which 
Hanoi maintains established Greenwich Meridian 
108? 03' 18" east as the offshore boundary. The 
Vietnamese argued that the extension of this meridian 
boundary from the southern part of the Gulf into the 
South China Sea is the only segment that needs to be 
delineated. Beijing rejected the Vietnamese contention 
but offered no counterdocumentation or specific claims 
of its own. China called for negotiations to settle the 
issue equitably. 
Secret 
The Vietnamese memorandum tries to put the onus for 
the Tonkin Gulf impasse on China. It maintains that 
the disputes started in 1973, when Hanoi informed 
China that it planned to prospect for oil and proposed 
negotiations to delineate the offshore boundary offi-
cially. China evidently agreed to negotiate, but insisted 
that pending an agreement, third countries should be 
prohibited from exploration activities and neither 
China nor Vietnam should prospect in a large area of 
the central Gulf. This would effectively prevent 
Vietnam from any significant exploitation of its oil 
resources. Vietnam claims that the subsequent negoti-
ations in 1973 and 1977 both failed because China 
refused to discuss the boundary question seriously. 
In fact, Vietnam is more to blame for the Tonkin 
impasse than China. Vietnam's claim that the 1887 
treaty divided the Gulf is an exaggeration." Indeed, 
the concept of extending maritime boundaries great 
distances from the coast did not even exist in the 19th 
century, so Vietnam's contention that a mutually 
acceptable offshore boundary has existed since 1887 is 
obviously fallacious. 
China, the Government on Taiwan, and Vietnam claim 
sovereignty over the Paracel Islands, citing historical 
documents and dynastic practices as evidence of their 
respective rights to jurisdiction. In 1956, the South 
Vietnamese replaced French troops on several of the 
Paracels, prompting Beijing to establish a naval base 
on another one and garrison some 200 soldiers on two 
more. South Vietnam occupied additional islands in 
late 1973, but in early 1974 China launched a naval 
and air attack against the South Vietnamese and 
secured control over the entire archipelago. Since 
taking over the Paracel Islands, China has fortified its 
positions and drilled an exploratory oil well on one of 
the islands. 
" According to the treaty, "the islands which are east of the Paris 
meridian of 105? 43' east (108? 03' 18" east of Greenwich), that is to 
say, the north-south line passing through the eastern point of the 
island of Tra-co which forms the boundary, are also allocated to 
China. The island of Gotho and other islands west of this meridian 
belong to Annam." Although the wording is imprecise, it appears 
that the 108? 03' 18" meridian was not intended to divide the entire 
Tonkin Gulf but only to serve as a cartographic device for awarding 
control over the islands.

Although Hanoi did not publicly object to China's 
takeover of the Paracels at the time, in 1976 it 
published maps that showed the Paracels and some 
other islands as Vietnamese territory. In 1977, Hanoi 
referred to them in its declaration of the limits of 
Vietnam's territorial sea. Public assertion of Vietnam-
ese territorial claims and denunciation of Chinese 
occupation of the Paracels did not occur until late 
1978, when Sino-Vietnamese relations deteriorated. A 
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry memorandum of March 
1979 reiterated these claims while again denouncing 
Beijing's 1974 takeover. 
Beijing argues that Hanoi recognized China's claims 
to the Paracels and other South China Sea islands 
several times in the past. Beijing also has asserted that 
Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong accepted Chi-
nese dominion over the islands in 1958 when he wrote 
Zhou Enlai that "the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of Vietnam recognizes and supports the 
declaration of the People's Republic of China on 
China's territorial sea made on 4 September 1958." 12 
Hanoi charges the alleged acquiescence was obtained 
under the duress of its conflict with South Vietnam and 
the United States. 
China, the Government on Taiwan, Vietnam, and the 
Philippines each claim sovereignty over the Spratly 
Islands?an archipelago of more than a hundred 
islands, reefs, and banks scattered over an area of 
260,000 square kilometers in the South China Sea. 
China has never occupied any of the Spratlys; Vietnam 
occupies and has fortified six of them, the Philippines 
seven, and Taiwan one. The strategic importance of the 
islands?located amid naval and maritime transit 
routes?and the potentially valuable offshore petro-
leum resources in the area have intensified the 
longstanding dispute over them in recent years." 
'2 The declaration said that the territory of China includes the 
Chinese mainland and its coastal islands as well as Taiwan and its 
surrounding islands?the Penghu Islands (Pescadores), Dongsha 
Islands (Pratas Islands), Xisha Islands (Paracel Islands), Zhonghsa 
Islands (Macclesfield Bank), and the Nansha Islands (Spratly 
Islands). 
"The 1968 UN geophysical study of East Asian waters fueled 
speculation about the area's potentially rich petroleum resources 
prompting claimants to reassert their rights and caution their rivals. 
South Vietnam and the Philippines occupied several islands each, 
and Manila granted concessionary rights to foreign oil companies to 
drill in the waters around the islands. Recent oil discoveries off the 
coast of the Philippine island of Palawan, east of the Spratlys, have 
further increased Manila's interest and the potential for conflict. 
China, Taiwan, South Vietnam, and the Philippines 
first made their respective claims to the islands in the 
1950s. The Spratlys were included in China's 1958 
Territorial Sea Declaration." In the early 1970s, when 
speculation about the oil potential of the area was 
running high, China warned that any exploratory or 
developmental activities on or around the islands 
constituted encroachment on its territorial sovereignty. 
Beijing initially contested the ownership of the 
Spratlys primarily with the former Saigon govern-
ment. Hanoi took over the South Vietnamese?held 
islands in 1975 and published maps showing the 
islands in 1976, but China did not comment publicly 
until relations deteriorated in 1978. That December, 
Beijing issued a Foreign Ministry statement denounc-
ing the Vietnamese occupation of some of the Spratlys. 
Hanoi responded that the Spratlys were "sacred 
Vietnamese territory," citing historical records and 
practices as justification of its claim. Beijing and 
Hanoi reiterated their claims in March 1979 memo-
randums. 25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
The Philippines " is the only claimant to attempt to 
exploit the potentially valuable oil deposits in the 
Spratly Islands region. The Philippines' rising oil 
import bill and Manila's desire to reduce its 
dependence on foreign suppliers spur its search for oil 
in the South China Sea. It granted oil-drilling conces-
sions to foreign companies in the early 1970s, but 
exploration in the contested area near Reed Bank did 
not begin until after a March 1976 discovery northwest 
of Palawan. Despite strong protests from Beijing, 
Hanoi, and Taipei, a Swedish-led consortium of oil 
companies that included the American Oil Company 
(Amoco) began drilling operations 50 miles south of 
Reed Bank. In 1977, the consortium halted its 
activities; drilling has resumed but without Amoco's 
participation. In recent months, the US Cities Service 
"China's claims to the Spratly archipelago extend southward to 
25X1 
areas under Malaysia's jurisdiction, but Beijing is unlikely to press  
its claims there because its friendly relations with Kuala Lumpur are 
" 
more important at present. 25X1 
The Philippine claim implicitly includes the entire Spratly 
archipelago, but since 1974, Manila has differentiated between the 
area it calls Kalayaan or Freedomland?an ill-defined group of 
islands and reefs in the northeastern Spratlys?and the rest of the 25X1 
islands. Manila recently published news of a presidential decree 
formally including Kalayaan as part of the Philippines.

Company discovered oil 23 miles off the northwestern 
coast of Palawan. Commercial production has already 
begun from these wells and has reached about 40,000 
barrels per day. 
Manila has strengthened its military capability to 
protect its claims to the Spratly Islands in general and 
the so-called Kalayaan Islands in particular. The 
Philippine Navy has increased patrols around the 
Spratlys, and an airfield has been constructed on one of 
the islands. The armed forces also recently created a 
Western Command responsible for protecting Philip-
pine claims west of Palawan. An airfield on Palawan 
has been renovated and a naval base expanded, and the 
number of troops there will be increased. Recently 
acquired F-8 jet fighters from the United States also 
improve Manila's military capabilities in the South 
China Sea. 
Manila claims that it has tacit assurance from Beijing 
that China will not interfere with Philippine oil 
exploration initiatives, but the Chinese periodically 
restate their own longstanding claims. Manila's an-
nouncement of an oil strike in early December 1978 
prompted China's public reiteration of its claims to the 
Spratly Islands on 22 December of that year, although 
the statement was also clearly directed at Vietnam. 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement not only 
opposed "any foreign country's invasion or occupation 
of any of the Spratly Islands" but also warned that 
"any development activities" in the area would consti-
tute an encroachment on Chinese territorial sover-
eignty. 
The Government on Taiwan also claims the Spratly 
Islands, but has professed no interest in developing 
potential offshore oil and natural gas there. Taiwan's 
distance from the Spratly Islands and its small Navy 
make it difficult for Taipei to defend its claims to the 
islands. 
China claims sovereignty over several islands, shoals, 
and reefs in the South China Sea, as does the 
Government on Taiwan. Although the reefs have no 
intrinsic economic value, the surrounding area may 
have oil resources, and ownership of the reefs would 
affect determination of jurisdiction over the South 
China Sea. 
Secret 
Pratas Reef lies in the South China Sea just off the 
East Asian continental shelf, approximately 230 miles 
southwest of Taiwan and only 135 miles southeast of 
the Chinese mainland:6 Japan recognized Chinese 
sovereignty over the island in 1909. China adminis-
tered it until 1936, when the Japanese Navy occupied 
it. After World War II, the Chinese Nationalist 
Government quickly reclaimed Pratas and established 
a military presence on the island. The mainland 
government officially claimed Pratas in its territorial 
sea declaration of 1958, but Beijing has not made the 
island an important issue in recent years. 
Taiwan also maintains a low-key approach to the 
dispute, compared with its more widely publicized 
disputes over the Paracel and Spratly Islands. It has 
quietly strengthened naval defenses on the island,  
howeveri 
about 400. 
\Current naval manpower is estimated at 
The military buildup is strictly defensive in nature. 
Naval ships or planes cannot be permanently based on 
Pratas, and the only naval operations may have been 
associated with resupply or troop rotations. The 
airfield is seldom used except for sea rescues or 
medical emergencies. 
Despite its obvious firm control of the island, Taipei 
has been circumspect about using Pratas to claim 
greater control of South China Sea waters and 
continental shelf. When Taipei delineated five seabed 
reserve zones in 1970, the southernmost zone extended 
only as far south as the southern tip of Taiwan, some 
80 miles north of Pratas. No offshore drilling has 
occurred south of the southern tip of Taiwan," an 
indication of Taipei's desire to keep the Pratas 
ownership question out of the headlines. 
16 Called Dongsha by the Chinese, Pratas Reef is a circular, coral 
barrier reef about 21 kilometers in diameter with an island on the 
western edge. For centuries, the island was used by fishermen from 
the mainland, Taiwan, and the Ryukus while fishing and gathering 
seaweed, shells, and coral. 
" Conoco and Amoco at one time held offshore oil concessions in the 
southernmost reserve zone, but the concessions were allowed to 
expire and are now held by the government-controlled China 
Petroleum Corporation.

In recent months, China signed agreements with 
foreign oil companies to conduct geophysical surveys in 
the South China Sea. Beijing granted concessionary 
rights for exploration to the US Phillips Petroleum 
Company in zone 6, where Pratas is located. Although 
this suggests a willingness to risk provoking Taiwan, 
Beijing privately told the oil company to avoid 
operations close to Pratas. Taiwan will undoubtedly 
protest but it lacks the naval and air capabilities on 
Pratas to respond militarily. 
China and Taiwan claim the Macclesfield Bank, about 
300 kilometers east of the Paracels, and the 
Scarborough Shoal about 135 miles west of Luzon 
Island in the Philippines. Macclesfield is completely 
submerged, and Scarborough contains only a few rocks 
breaking the surface, preventing either claimant from 
establishing a presence there.
