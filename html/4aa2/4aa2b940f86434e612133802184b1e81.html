				  	prevails  in  border  areas  with  the  opening  of  Che  Sino-Vietnamese  vice
				  	ministerial   	talks  at  hand.
				  	Lnng  Son  City  did  not  suetain  ao  much  deatruction  as  Cao  Bang  did,   	as  the
				  	Chinese  troopa  which  found   	Cheir  way  into  the  city  on  4  March  pulled  out
				  	next  day.    	Nevertheless,  moat  of   	the  buildings  such  as  hospitals,  post
				  	offices  and  hotels  were  destroyed.    	Dong  Dang,   	located  3  kms  from  the					"
				  	border,  wae  a  deaerCed  place  and  not  a  soul  wae  seen  there.
				  	A  large  number  of  Vietnamese  troops  were  entrenched  in  hills  around  Dong  Dang.
				  	Residents  in  nearby  villages  also  had  evacuated  and  the  border  areas  of
				  	Ln~g  Son  Province  were   	in  a  semicombat  state.
				  	Minorities  account  for  70  percent  of  the  province's  total  population  of
		 	.		 	480,000.    	The  Chinese  invasion  caused  200,000  residents  to  evacuate;
				  	only  6Q,000  of  them  including  women  and  militiamen  have  returned  so  far.			  	-
				  	Railway  stations  in  Lnng  Son  Province  were  still  crowded  with  people
				  	evacuating  to  saEer  places   	from  border  areas.    	This  correspondent's  request
				  	for  permi~sion  to  travel  to  Yu~ti  Pass  on  the  border  was  denied  by  the
				 	provincial  milir~?ry  command  for  the  reason  that  it   	is  not  advisable   	to
				  	irritate   	Che  Chinese  side  with  the  opening  of  the  vice  ministerial  talks
				 	at  hand.																			 	_

			  	When  he  came  to  Japan  toward  the  close  of  last  year,   	SRV  Foreign  Minister
			  	Nguyen  Duy  Trinh  sought  Japanese  cooperation--both  governmenC  and  private

			  	and    	(4)  iron  mill.    	But  the  predominant  outlook  in  Che  trade  circle  is

				   	Co  purticipa~e  in  commercial  talks  has  been  used  before  in  dealing  with
				  	the  PRC.    	Stable  exports  was  the  aim  in  adopting  Che  same  format  for  trans-
				  	acr~.one  w~~h  the  SRV.    	It  would  appear  that  the  sudden  Curn  o�  events  dis-
				  	rupCed  their  plans  for  Vtetnam~  but  v~lume-wise,   	comparecl  to  over  5  m~llion
				  	tona  per  year  going  to  China,   	the  amount  involved  is  sma11.    	It   	is  sma11
				  	even  when  compa~ed  to  the  1.6  million  Cons  going  to  Iran.    	Thus,   	the  current
				  	situation  of  no  commercial  talks  with  Che  SRV  ~.s  not  such  a  serious  problem
				  	�or  the  steel  induetry.    	And,   	in  terms  of  relationship  with  China,  Nippon
				  	Steel  Corporation's  participation  in  Che  cooperative  construction  efforC  of
				  	Shanghai  Baoeh~r?  Steel  Mi11  ia  proceeding  without  problems.    	The  general
				  	concen~us  ie  Chat  there  ia  nothing  to  worry  about  with  respect  to  the
				  	futur~,
				  	The  depressed  fertilizer  induatry's  siCuation  is  similar.    	After  unifica-
				  	Cion  of  Vietnam,   	there  was  ecanty  export  of  fertilizer,  uaing  a  friendship
	  	-				company  as  a  transactional  base.    	LasC  Year,   	the  Nippon  Ammonium  Sulfate
				  	Industry  Asaociation  became  the  first  industry  to  starC  formal  negotiations
				  	with  the  SRV.    	But  negotiatione  had  come  to  a  complete  ha1C  due  to  ehe  fi-
				  	nancial  settlement  question.    	The  current  conflict  arose  as  negotiaCions
				  	were  about  to  be  abandoned.    	There  was  an  opinfon  in  the  industry  that  in
				  	view  of  our  relationship  with  China--the  largest  importer  of  fertilizer--
				  	"export  to  the  SRV  ought  to  be  approached  very  cautiously.    	For  these
				  	reasons,   	it  is  understandable  that  the  fertilizer  indusCry  is  undisturbed
	 	~				by  the  newa  of  the  PRC-SRV  conflict  and  claims  to  have  suffered  no  i11  ef-
				  	fects  from  the  conflict.
				  	The  conflict  has  caused  a  sudden  ~ump  in  the  metal  goods  prices  and  the  non-
				  	ferrous  metal  induatry  is  en~oying  an  unexpected  windfall.    	For  example,   	the
				  	copper  ore  price  was  rising  before  the  outbreak  of  the  PRC-SRV  conflict  as
				  	it  was  being  bought  up  as  a  strategic  commodity,  and  this  r,aused  an  impres-
				  	sion  of  international  shortage,  but  the  conflict  spurred  the  price  hike.
				  	However,   	there  is  a  strong  poseibility  that  speculators  are  active  in  the
				  	copper  market.    	Moreover,   	the  strategic  nature  of  nonferrous  metals,   	includ-
				  	in~  tungsten,  will  be  reevaluated  and  this  is  expected  to  have  repercussions.
				  	These,   	then,   	are  unknown  factors  underlying  apprehenaions.
				  	Worrisome  Japan-China  Petroleum  Negotiation
				  	Aside  from  the  above,   	the  Petroleum  Public  Cooperation  is  talking  to  the  SRV
				  	Government  regarding  Che  Mekong  Delta  offshore  oil  field  development.
				  	After  the  Japanese  Government's  criticism  of  Vietnam's  invasion  of  Cambodia,
				  	the  SRV  hardened  its  attitude,  and  concerned  parties  are  worried  that,   	if  the
				  	SRV's  stance  toward  the  Japaneae  Government  becomes  more  rigid  as  a  result  of
				  	the  currenC  PRC-SRV  conflict,   	it  is  going  to  be  much  more  difficult  to  resume
				  	interrupted  negotiations.
