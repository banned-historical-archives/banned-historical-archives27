DCI BRIEFING FOR 
HARDY SUBCOMMITTEE 
INTRODUCTION 
2 October 1967 
I. I would like to begin by noting that the field of 
your inquiry, as defined in the Chairman's mi-
tial announcement, centers ori: commitments 
and capabilities, while the attention of th6"lin-
N 
telligence community is directed primarily at the 
present capabilities and possible future inten-
tions of foreign powers. 
A. My contribution to your 
hearings is therefore 
ense,collateral. It will deal with the 
existing and potential threats which may--or 
already do--levy on the commitments and capa-
bilities of this country. 
B. To give you an idea of where I may be able to 
serve your purposes most directly, let me 
summarize briefly the role of CIA--and the 
intelligence community as a whole--in the U.S. 
Government. 
1. Our primary job is to keep the U.S. Gov-
ernment informed on foreign developments

which have national security significance; 
to estimate the probable course or conse-
quences of these developments; and to give 
timely warning of potential problems affect-
ing our national security. 
2. We supply the operating and policy 
with national intelligence--in other words, 
finished reporting which contains the co-
ordinated and agreed evaluation and analysis 
of all 1ITIJ elements in the intelligence 
community. 
3. The individual intelligence components still 
specialize in their respective departmental 
fields--for instance, DIA is particularly 
interested in tactical military intelligence. 
The final product of agreed national intel-
ligence takes into account all of the in-
formation and all of the expertise available 
in all of the departmental components, to 
give the policy makers the best support pos-
sible. 
C. I propose to give you then, the best judgments 
available to me as Director of-limmi ntelligence

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
HARDY SUBCOMMITTEE 
COMMUNIST CHINA 
I. The logical starting point is Communist China. 
It is the major hostile power facing us in 
the Far East, with a thermonuclear capability, 
large conventional forces based on the mas-
790 
sive manpower of MEW million people, and a 
record of unwavering, aggressive hostility 
toward the United States and the Free World. 
A. This challenge is limited for the time 
being by two factors: the domestic tur-
moil of the Cultural Revolution, and 
certain weaknesses of the conventional  
armed forces. 
B. I will first discuss these limitations, 
and then examine Peking's strengths, the 
foundations and objectives of present 
Chinese Communist policy, and finally the 
Chinese threat as seen from the perspec-
tive of the other countries in the Far 
East and Southeast Asia.

The Cultural Revolution 
I. Communist China has been rocked for the past 
year and a half by the convulsions which Peking 
calls the Cultural Revolution. 
A. In the summer of 1966, Mao Tse-tung launched 
a campaign designed to ensure that China--
during Mao's remaining years and after his 
death--would remain on a radical and revo-
lutionary course. 
1. These terms are relative. You might 
say that--from Mao's viewpoint--the 
Soviets with their matured revolution, 
their advanced economy, and their 
international line of co-existence, 
had turned stodgy and conservative. 
Mao was concerned that the same thing 
might be happening to the Chinese 
leadership around him, after nearly 
two decades in power. 
2. His purge was aimed directly at the 
Communist Party leadership, and the 
party bosses in the provinces. 
3. The Communist Party was hardly an 
effective instrument to purge itself, 
so he created the Red Guards.

Igre 
B. The men Mao was gunning for did not surren-
der tamely. They organized their own mobs, 
which also called themselves Red Guards 
and claimed to be working for the Cultural 
Revolution. They incited workers in some 
cases to attack the Red Guards. They 
sought and sometimes got the support of 
local military commanders. 
C. There is ample evidence that7WW"Red Guards, 
once they had been created, engendered 
their own momentum and picked their own 
targets. They proved difficult if not 
impossible to control. 
D. What might be called a "third force" seems 
to be taking shape, probably centered 
around Premier Chou En-lai and composed 
of government ministers and military com-
manders. 
1. These men are concerned over the grow-
ing chaos and disruption, concerned 
over their own security and status, 
outraged over the excesses and irre-
sponsibility of the Red Guards.

E. Twice this year--in January and again in Au-
gust'--the Y seem to have brought enough pressure 
to bear on Mao and his designated Number Two 
Man, Marshal Lin Piao, to bring about the 
temporary moderation of the Cultural Revolution. 
II. Early this summer, despite the efforts for 
moderation, China was in its most severe crisis 
since the Communists took control of the main-
land in 1949. Violent conflict was reported 
from every province. 
A. Groups of fanatic Red Guard extremists were 
engaged in pitched battles with one another, 
and with organized workers. 
B. The Chinese economy began to feel the pressure.

Nu, 
1. For many weeks, there have been serious 
disruptions of rail and river transport. 
2. Sporadic shutdowns have hit key industrial 
centers--possibly including some plants 
related to important military-related 
production./ 
3. Chinese agriculture may have an adequate 
food crop in the fields this year, but even 
if it is successfully harvested, continuing 
turmoil will interfere with the distribution 
to cities and to food deficit areas. 
C. The disruption of industry and agriculture is 
being reflected by a sharp drop in foreign 
trade in recent months, reducing cash earnings 
and setting back economic growth. 
1. Food shortages will heighten unrest and 
disorder. 
2. Propaganda media, appealing to the public 
to maintain production, have cited a 
September directive that "it is forbidden 
to make revolution during working hours."

The Role of the "People's Liberation Army" 
III. In the course of the Cultural Revolution, the 
army has not come down with cohesive and un-
mistakable force on either side. 
A. Early in the purge, Marshal Lin Piao was 
proclaimed as Mao's closest associate and 
chosen successor. 
1. It has been clear, however, that the 
armed forces--and even the military 
leadership--have been less than mono-
lithic in their loyalty to Mao and Lin 
Piao. 
2. It appears inconceivable that Mao and 
the men around him--if they were sure 
of the army's reliability--would not 
have called on it earlier to crush 
provincial resistance. 
3. The Red Guard denunciations have reached 
high into the military commands.

B. The army, always a political instrument in 
Communist China, has been called on in-
creasingly to restore order, provide 
administration, and keep the economy opera-
ting. In this respect, it is working with 
the forces for moderation. 
C. Since January, the Chinese Communist Party's 
administrative apparatus has been discredited 
and largely dissolved. It can no longer play 
its former central role in the day-to-day 
governing of the country. 
1. In addition, the upper levels of the 
governmental apparatus have in large 
measure been paralyzed by the excesses 
of the Cultural Revolution, producing 
something of an administrative vacuum. 
2. As a result the army has been forced to 
take over the administration of large 
areas of China. In March, Lin Piao said 
that 30 military commands, ranging from 
battalions to entire divisions, had been 
assigned to administrative duties, taking 
^over 7,000 "units." (The "units" could be 
anything from a farm to a province.1

Appiayed FortOpsEsWn212 : CIA-RDP49T00827A001000060009-2 
3. Since March the army's administrative 
tasks have expanded further. Still more 
troops have been diverted to these addi-
tional tasks. 
D. In its expanded administrative role, the 
army has found itself at times in conflict 
with the more militant Red Guard groups. 
1. This was particularly true in February 
and March, when the military clamped down 
on Red Guard activity in the name of 
order and rationality. 
E. 
Many local 
military commanders have been accused by 
the militants of "suppressing revolu-
tionaries." 
The increasing involvement in local political 
struggles has gradually forced army commanders 
to abandon the position they first sought to 
maintain of being "above the battle."

the army has shown con-
siderable distaste for further involvement 
in the local political infighting. 
IV. The dissatisfaction of the men around Mao over army 
opposition to the more extreme "revolutionary" 
policies came to a head in late July, in a serious 
confrontation between the Peking Maoists and the 
powerful commander of the Wuhan Military Region. 
This "incident" was followed by a nationwide propa-
ganda campaign against unnamed dissident military 
leaders.

A. Two important emissaries from Peking were 
detained from July 20th to 22nd by worker 
groups responsive to the Wuhan Military 
Region commander. 
1. Peking reacted with a violent campaign 
against the dissident commander, and the 
Wuhan command was reorganized. 
2. Military leaders who had been running 
Hupeh province in the Wuhan Military 
Region were also replaced, as were the 
military leaders in the adjacent provinces 
of Honan, Hunan and Kiangsi. 
3. On July 22nd, Mao's wife made an in-
flammatory speech denouncing the Wuhan 
commander, and instructing Red Guards 
everywhere to acquire arms in "self 
defense." 
B. Violent conflicts soon broke out in nearly 
every province between Red Guard groups in-
cited by Peking, and workers organized and 
responsive to local military commanders.

C. While the reorganization of the provincial 
military commands was accomplished quickly, it 
was not done easily.\ 
D. In many other provinces, Red Guards launched 
virulent campaigns against the military 
governors--usually commanders of the local 
military district or region.

Now 
1. A few local commanders and military 
figures in Peking were removed, but 
many others apparently survived the 
Red Guard onslaughts. 
V. In September, Maoist leaders abruptly retreated, 
and began conciliatory moves designed to patch 
1.110 their differences with the army. 
B. 
Attacks on the army were forbidden, and the 
importance of the military was emphasized 
in official propaganda. 
C. Even Mao's wife, in a sharp turn-about, was 
required to warn against attacks on army 
leaders, saying that such attacks had caused 
grave dissatisfaction in military circles. 
D. These new moves indicate considerable concern 
in Peking about the morale and reliability of 
the military establishment.

VI. The recent developments suggest, in fact, that 
the current moderation of the Cultural Revolution 
could be something more than a tactical withdrawal. 
A. it is clear that major policy decisions were 
made at the end of August, when the first 
moves toward moderation were noted. 
B. The evidence raises the possibility that there 
has been a shift in the power balance in Peking, 
and that as a result the more extreme objectives 
of the Cultural Revolution have been abandoned. 
C. Meetings of senior political and military 
leaders apparently were held throughout 
September, and military unit commanders from 
various provinces assembled in Peking at the 
end of the month. 
D. Military figures were given unusual prominence 
during the Chinese Communist National Day 
celebrations on October first, including some 
who have been under heavy political attack, 
and many who have not appeared in public all 
year. 
E. In contrast, the organization called the 
"Cultural Revolution Group," which has 
been closely identified with the more 
extreme policies of the past year, was 
not even mentioned in the speeches on

National Day. The Group had featured 
prominently at all major public occasions 
of the past 12 months. Now it seems to 
have been downgraded, and three of its 
members have been strongly criticized 
in recent weeks. 
VII. There was little question this summer that if 
Mao and his associates did not call off or 
moderate the extreme phase of the Cultural 
Revolution--a decision they must have been 
most reluctant to take--the result could only 
be chaos, .and perhaps a state of complete 
anarchy. 
A. The Old China Hands were starting to talk 
in terms of the fragmentation of China 
into a number of virtually independent 
regions--a return to the "warlord days" of 
the 1920's.. 
B. The onset of the crucial fall harvest, 
now in progress, may have been a decisive 
factor in the switch to moderation. 
C. As matters stood in July and August, 
continuation of the violence and disorder 
would have made it very difficult--if not 
impossible--to collect the food from the 
farms and get it into government granaries.

VIII. Even if the forces of moderation, supported by 
the military establishment, should come out 
on top' in the end, there is no sign whatever 
that Peking would waver in its unremitting 
hostility to the United States. 
A. Both the fanatics around Mao, and the 
relatively moderate leaders opposed to him, 
are dedicated hard-line Communists who 
believe that the United States is China's 
Number One Enemy.

CHINESE COMMUNIST ARMED FORCES  
I. Even if there were no Cultural Revolution, Peking's 
ambitions for great power status in the world and the 
dominant position in Asia would be hobbled by limita-
tions of the Chinese Communist armed forces. 
A. Peking has a massive military establishment in 
terms of manpower, but we do not believe it could 
overrun any of its neighbors in the face of 
significant resistance from a major power. 
1. The first priority for the Chinese Communist 
armed forces is defense of the mainland, 
Ana nrotection of the regime.

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
HARDY SUBCOMMITTEE 
CHINESE COMMUNIST FOREIGN POLICY 
I. Communist rule in China is less than 20 years 
old, but the foundations of Chinese Communist 
foreign policy reach back centuries into Chinese 
history. 
A. China has traditionally exerted a strong 
cultural and political ilfluence in other 
parts of Asia, and the present leaders in 
Peking are constantly pointing to their own 
revolutionary experience as a model for 
other Asian nations to copy. 
B. Their objectives, however, go beyond mere 
influence and example. Historically, 
imperial China regarded itself as the 
"Middle Kingdom," to which all surrounding 
nations owed tribute and fealty. 
C. Mao and his associates may not consider 
themselves imperial, but they are still 
Chinese, and they are clearly bent on 
restoring China to the traditional imperial 
position as the center of all Asia.

D. They have a messianic conviction in the 
righteousness and inevitable success of 
their cause, both for China and for Communism. 
 IAs Peking sees the worl 
then, China must not only dominate Asia, 
but must be a major world power and the 
acknowledged leader of the international 
Communist movement. 
II. Peking today looks on the United States as the 
principal threat to its ambitions in Asia, and 
considers the U.S. military presence in the 
Western Pacific a, major threat to Chinese national 
security. 
A. From the ideological point of view, the United 
States is also the leading "capitalist-imperial-
ist" power, and must be totally discredited 
to prove the correctness of Chinese doctrine 
B. The Chinese leaders realize that for the 
present they do not have the strength to drive

the U.S. out of the Far East by direct 
application of force, so they concentrate 
their efforts on changing the balance 
of power in the area, stirring up anti-U.S. 
feeling and, wherever possible, undermining 
U.S. alliances and military base agreements. 
The Sino-Soviet Dispute  
Peking's policy of implacable hostility toward 
the U.S. is matched only by the bitter and 
vituperative state of relations between 
Communist China and the Soviet Union. 
A. During the past year, the most striking 
feature has been the willingness of each 
side to publicize the extent to which re-
lations have deteriorated. 
B. For all intents and purposes, party contacts 
do not exist, State relations are minimal 
and formal. Cultural contacts continue on a 
very small scale, and trade continues to 
decline. 
C. The past year has seen Soviet diplomats in 
Peking suffer abuse and physical violence

at the hands of Red Guards. Soviet ships 
have been detained in Chinese ports, and 
their crews roughed up. Peking has unilateral-
ly terminated a number of bilateral agree-
ments, and has been generally intransigent 
in any bilateral discussions. 
D. We see little likelihood that the situation 
will change as long as the present leaderships 
hold power in Moscow and Peking. 
1. What happens in China after Mao is gone 
will determine whether the dispute is to 
get worse, or ease up. Even then, any 
relaxation of tension would probably 
be short-lived. 
2. Peking is hardly likely to give up its 
ambitions for world Communist leadership 
and Asian political hegemony. Nor is it 
likely to renounce its traditional 
interests in border areas, where it 
considers that Mongolia should be a 
Chinese satellite, and maintains claims 
to extensive areas detached from old 
China by Czarist Russia.

E. Moscow is bound to be concerned over the 
chaos shaking a huge neighbor, particularly 
when it can exert little control over 
events just across the border. 
IV. The area of most direct concern to Peking and 
Moscow, of course, is the 4,000-mile common 
frontier. 
A. The Soviets have been building up their 
forces in the areas bordering on China 
gradually since the early 1960's. This 
build-up has been somewhat accelerated 
during the past year or so, and there is 
now evidence that the Soviets are stationing 
major ground force units in Mongolia around 
Ulan Bator. 
B. The Soviet build-up along the China border 
is likely to continue at something like the 
present deliberate rate. The force goals 
are probably quite limited, however, and 
are not likely to lead to a large-scale 
offensive capability. 
C. Chinese military reactions to the Soviet 
augmentation have been quite restrained, but

Peking, Moscow and the Vietnam Issue 
(MAP, ASIA CENTERED ON PEKING) 
V. Over the past two or three years, the Sino-
Soviet quarrel has increasingly centered on the 
war in Vietnam and its eventual outcome. And 
if you look at the world from China's geographic 
point of view--as in this map centered on 
Peking--you can see why Peking's policies have 
their greatest immediate impact on South and 
Southeast Asia. 
A. Southeast Asia is 
China's 
doorstep to the South Pacific, and to the 
Indian Ocean. 
B. These geopolitical considerations are 
going to keep Chinese Communist policy 
toward Southeast Asia expansive, dynamic, 
and above all aggressive. 
C. To a large degree, this explains why the 
struggle for Vietnam is of paramount concern 
for the Chinese. It is the place where the

short-term aims and long-range ambitions of 
Chinese foreign policy come into sharp 
focus. Developments there will have sweeping 
consequences for China's broader struggles 
with the U.S. and with the Soviet Union. 
VI. The Chinese have every desire to see the Vietnam 
struggle continue. They view it as a primary 
example of a "people's war" being waged against 
the principal enemy--US imperialism. 
A. The Chinese want to prove conclusively that 
"wars of liberation" can triumph over US 
military power without bringing about a 
major international war. 
B. A resolution of the Vietnam conflict along 
these lines would go far in restoring 
Peking's influence among Asian Communists, 
and would bolster the claims that world 
Communists should look to Peking, not 
Moscow, for guidance in launching and 
conducting their own revolutions. 
1. This is not just a question of dialectics 
In many Latin American countries today, 
the local Communists are divided into

Moscow, Peking, and Castro factions 
over the question of the best means 
of seizing power. 
2. A victory for Communism in Vietnam might 
help either the pro-Chinese or pro-
Castro factions, inasmuch as both 
advocate violent revolution. It 
would be bound to weaken the leadership 
of those factions which advocate the 
more gradual path of political subversion. 
VII. Vietnam creates something of a dilemma for the 
Soviet Union. 
A. The fundamental Soviet reaction is to give 
all possible assistance to a Communist 
brother fighting a capitalist-imperialist 
power. 
1. This is not only a gut reaction, but 
a practical one. It has played a 
major part in the ability of Brezhnev 
and Kosygin to isolate Peking and 
rally the rest of the world's 
Communist to Moscow's leadership.

2. The insistence of Khrushchev that the 
Peking leadership must be condemned 
by international Communism had split 
the movement. Few of the parties 
were willing to attend any international 
conference called for this purpose. 
3. The new Kremlin leadership emphasized 
united Communist support for Vietnam. 
Peking's refusal to cooperate with Moscow 
in support of Hanoi, coupled with the 
excesses of the Cultural Revolution, 
succeeded where Khrushchev's frontal 
tactics had failed. 
4. The international Communist movement 
once again looks to Moscow for leader-
ship, at least in support of North 
Vietnam against the United States. 
B. This means, however, that the Soviet 
Union can hardly afford to be less fervent 
in its support of the Vietnam war than 
Peking, and above all it can not afford 
to run the risk of any blame in the event 
that North Vietnam is defeated, or forced 
to compromise for less than victory at 
the negotiating table.

Vietnam and Soviet-U.S. Relations  
VII. At the same time, Vietnam is peripheral to the 
vital interests of the Soviet Union. In Kremlin 
eyes, it is certainly not worth a direct con-
frontation with the United States, with the 
inherent risks of bringing on global war. 
A. The Soviet Union will do everything possible, 
short of direct involvement, to help North 
Vietnam continue the fight. 
B. The Soviets might help to bring about negotia-
tions if they thought talks could be to 
Hanoi's advantage, and if the North Viet-
namese were so inclined. 
1. The Kremlin can not, however, as I just 
noted, expose itself to a charge of having 
forced the North Vietnamese to the con-
ference table. 
C. The Kremlin is probably happy to see major 
U.S. forces deeply committed in a distant 
area without any corresponding Soviet 
commitment. 
1. Soviet propaganda and diplomacy all 
over the world is concentrating on making 
? the United States the villain in the 
Vietnamese war.

Appned For ReP(91/2 EIRREgfA-RDMW100827A001000060009-2 
2. The public Kremlin posture on U.S.-
Soviet relations is that there is little 
prospect for improvement or detente as 
long as the war in Vietnam continues. 
D. But at the same time, the Kremlin leaders 
realize that if there is going to be any 
meaningful progress on matters which are 
truly essential to their national interests--
such as East-West trade, European security, 
and perhaps arms control?sooner or later 
they are going to have to, resume the dialogue 
with the United States. 
1. There has, in fact, been some progress 
on matters not directly related to Vietnam--
for instance the civil air agreement, the 
treaty on peaceful uses of outer space, 
and the draft of the nuclear non-prolifera-
tion treaty. 
2. Soviet leaders have used a number of 
opportunities to emphasize privately 
that they do not want the Vietnamese 
issue to bring about a showdown with 
the United States.

E. It is clear that they want to keep their 
lines of communication with Washington open 
and working, and would be reluctant to see 
their necessary support for Vietnam send 
vital interests in Europe and elsewhere 
down the drain. 
F. Almost certainly, the Moscow leaders hope 
that some day Hanoi, or Washington, or both, 
will make a political solution of the war 
possible. 
1. In the meantime, they will try to persuade 
the United States not to escalate the 
war any further, and to agree to terms 
for a settlement which would be acceptable 
to North Vietnam. 
2. They will probably not try to bring any real 
pressure on Hanoi to modify its terms 
for such a settlement, and they probably 
believe that such pressure would probably 
be ineffective under present circum-
stances anyway. 
Soviet and Chinese Aid to Vietnam  
IX. The Soviet Union provides the great majority 
of the military aid North Vietnam needs to keep 
on fighting.

B. Soviet economic aid to North Vietnam may 
amount to as much as $200 million this year. 
It is designed to maintain and repair North 
Vietnam's essential services and industries, 
and provide a minimal subsistence. 
1. Most of this economic aid, including 
such war-related items as trucks and 
P.O.L., reaches North Vietnam by sea. 
2. A large share of the increased tonnage 
reaching North Vietnam by sea in the 
first half of 1967 consisted of food 
from the Soviet Union and Eastern Eu-
rope. 
3. Soviet economic aid includes machinery, 
vehicles, and road-building equipment. 
X. Chinese economic aid to North Vietnam this year 
may run to about $80 million, in comparison to 
the $200 million from the Soviet Union. The 
Chinese send in--by sea, by rail, and by truck--
food, raw materials, some petroleum, and con-
sumer goods. 
A. The Chinese have furnished some fighter

aircraft and patrol boats to North Vietnam, 
but their military aid consists primarily 
of large quantities of small arms, useful 
in both North and South Vietnam. 
Chinese Relations with North Vietnam 
XI. The relations between Hanoi and Peking have 
changed radically since the Khrushchev era, 
when China was the only effective ally the 
Vietnamese Communists had. 
A. The Chinese are concerned over Moscow's 
steadily increasing support for the Viet-
namese, Hanoi's eager acceptance of Soviet 
aid, and recurrent displays of independence 
on Hanoi's part. 
1. Peking is almost certainly concerned 
over the possibility that Hanoi might 
decide to agree to negotiations with 
the U.S. if the bombing is stopped. 
The Chinese have lectured the Vietnam-
ese incessantly and imperiously on 
the dangers of such a course. 
B. Hanoi in turn has persisted in its policy 
of maintaining close relations with Moscow 
ever since the Soviets began to provide

greater support for Hanoi's war effort. 
C. The Vietnamese are also very concerned over 
the Chinese Cultural Revolution. 
1. They are well aware that the disorders 
in China diminish the credibility of 
the threat of Chinese intervention in 
the war, an ace in the hole which the 
Vietnamese would clearly like to keep. 
2. The mere threat that rail disruptions 
in China might affect aid shipments to 
North Vietnam is enough to sour Hanoi 
on the Cultural Revolution. 
D. Despite these frictions between Peking and 
Hanoi, there is no evidence that they have 
affected the attitude of either party to-
ward the war, or reduced the level of Chi-
nese support.

E. The extent of Chinese influence over Hanoi 
is clearly limited. 
1. China's proximity to North Vietnam and 
the political, economic and military 
support given Hanoi by Peking all en-
sure that any Chinese recommendations 
or advice are at least. considered by 
Hanoi. 
2. Peking and Hanoi take differing public 
stances, however, on the subject of 
Vietnam negotiations, and Hanoi's 
intention to maintain an independent 
position indicates that the Vietnamese 
intend to conduct their affairs in the

light of their own self-interest. 
3. Although Peking could threaten to cut 
off all assistance to Vietnam if the 
latter adopted policies opposed by the 
Chinese, Peking is aware that such 
threats could be counterproductive and 
only push Hanoi into closer relations 
with the Soviet Union. 
F. It is most unlikely that Peking would 
attempt to keep the war going in the face 
of Vietnamese determination to enter into 
negotiations. 
1. Chinese leaders have privately commented 
that in the last analysis this decision 
is up to Hanoi. 
2. A Chinese official indicated that if 
such a development occurred, Peking 
would label it as an abandonment of 
the correct path under Soviet pressure 
and oppose the "deviationist" move 
just as the Chinese criticized North 
Korean leader Kim Il Sung when he be-
gan to respond favorably to Soviet 
overtures in 1966.

Possibility of Chinese Intervention 
XII. The Chinese Communists have always moved very 
carefully on the subject of Vietnam, despite 
occasional statements carrying the threat of 
massive intervention. They have followed a 
cautious policy designed to hold down the risk 
of a military clash with U.S. forces. 
A. This is not to say that Peking has been 
bluffing, or that there has been no chance 
of massive Chinese intervention in the 
fighting. We believe there are presently 
three situations which would probably 
bring the Chinese into the war, reluctantly 
but in large numbers. 
1. One of these would be U.S. air strikes 
against targets in China. In May 1965, 
Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi asked 
25X6 
to pass 
along a warning to this effect. 
2. The second circumstance which would 
probably trigger Chinese intervention 
would be a major U.S. invasion of North 
Vietnam Chinese leaders passed this 
word t

'two 
3. In addition, if the collapse of the 
Hanoi Government should seem imminent, 
China would probably move into North 
Vietnam to restore order and perhaps 
establish a puppet government to con-
trol a buffer zone along the southern 
frontier of China. 
B. These "flashpoints" probably still exist, 
and any U.S. actions which disregarded 
the private Chinese warnings given more 
than two years ago would run a grave risk 
of bringing on the "wider war" threatened 
in Chinese propaganda from time to time. 
C. We think, however, that developments during 
the past year have operated to increase 
Chinese caution, probably raising Peking's 
eshold of sensitivity.

BRIEFING NOTE 
HAIPHONG PROBLEM 
9 October 1967 
I. To put the question of Haiphong in perspective, 
let me start by saying that we would not be 
striking directly at the enemy's military supply 
lines by denying him the use of Haiphong. 
II. I believe that the closure of Haiphong to ocean 
shipping would force the Communists to shift so 
much additional traffic to overland routes that

III. An expanded program not limited to ocean shipping 
could force the Communists to reduce some of their 
import programs, because the remaining transporta-
tion facilities simply could not handle the entire 
load. 
A. The expanded program would have to involve 
closing the approaches to the other ports of 
Hon Gai and Cam Pha, the use of mines against 
shallow draft shipping, and intensive armed 
reconnaissance against transportation targets 
and lines of communication. 
B. Even the expanded program, however, would not 
in our estimation make a meaningful dent in the 
flow of essential military and economic materials, 
or prevent North Vietnam's continued support 
of the war in the South.

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
HARDY SUBCOMMITTEE 
CHINA'S NEIGHBORS 
I. At this point, before we get too deeply into 
the subject of Vietnam itself, I want to swing 
around the periphery of China to touch briefly 
on each of the neighboring countries--what their 
principal problems are, their significance in 
terms of U.S. interests, and in particular their 
relations to Communist China. 
A. After that, we can then come back and finish 
up with North Vietnam and South Vietnam if 
you wish.

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
HARDY SUBCOMMITTEE 
LAOS 
2 October 1967 
I. There is still a war going on in Laos. There 
are about 18.,000North Vietnamese troops in the 
country--plus or minus depending on the season--
and last year there were more than 1,600 en-
gagements. 
A. The long Laotian Panhandle, of course, is 
the site of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, vital to 
the Communists for the infiltration of men 
and supplies into South Vietnam. 
1. The bulk of the North Vietnamese troops 
are in the Panhandle, providing the de-
fense, the administration, and the main-
tenance of the infiltration road net. 
2. They react sharply to any government 
pressure toward the eastern half of the 
Panhandle, bordering on South Vietnam. 
3. In July, they drove government troops 
away 
from positions 
along the eastern rim of the Bolovens 
Plateau.

B. Around the Plain of Jars, where the Laotian 
war used to center, and still farther north, 
the Communist military posture is basically 
defensive. 
1. North Vietnamese troops in this area serve 
mainly as stiffening for the local Pathet 
Lao Communists. 
2. Occasionally complete North Vietnamese 
battalions are sent in to lead an attack 
aimed at rolling back government forces. 
C. By and large, the Communists apparently want 
to keep the war in the North on the back burner 
as long as the fighting in Vietnam continues. 
D. They are increasingly hard pressed by the 
highly successful operations of the Neo tribal 
guerrillas, and the improved operations of 
Laotian government forces, aided by U.S. and 
Laotian tactical air support. 
1. The guerrillas actually hold and defend 
extensive areas astride or threatening Com-
munist supply lines south of Sam Neua. 
2. A year ago government troops took Nam 
Bac, north of the royal capital at Luang 
Prabang, and have made it an important base

for intelligence and harassment opera-
tions as far north as the North Vietnamese 
border. 
3. A government offensive is getting under 
way in the Plain of Jars area. 
E. Now some North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao re-
inforcements have moved into the Plain of Jars 
area, but this appears to be a defensive reaction 
to the anticipated government push. 
F. The Communists will probably also soon launch 
what has become an annual but largely unsuccessful 
campaign to drive the Meo guerrillas away from 
Sam Neua communication lines. 
G. We also expect a considerably more serious of-
fensive by the Communists to try to retake Nam 
Bac. 
II. There have been and may still be a few Chinese Commu-
nist troops in the Phong Saly area--the large thumb 
of Laos extending between North Vietnam and China. 
A. This area has been in Communist hands ever since 
the fighting began in Laos. 
B. The Chinese troops were there to build a road, 
and to protect the construction job. They have 
not engaged in any combat operations.

III. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma is firmly in the 
saddle in Vientiane. Contending military leaders 
have managed to keep their rivalries toned down; 
the Pathet Lao elements never showed up to take 
their places in the proposed coalition government; 
and

B. 
General Phoumi and other rightists have fled 
country after unsuccessful coups. 
Souvanna Phouma still retains the fiction of 
tripartite coalition government, but he is a 
disillusioned neutralist when it comes to his 
former hopes that he could rule a reunified 
country peacefully with the Pathet Lao. 
He has become a firm anti-Communist as far 
as Laotian affairs are concerned, and voices 
strong support for the U.S. effort in both Laos 
and South Vietnam.

D. Souvanna's misgivings are shared by Lao mili-

1. They recently rejected a South Vietnamese 
proposal for mounting joint cross-border 
operations against North Vietnamese troops 
in the corridor. 
2. One reason is a genuine concern over possible 
international repercussions if South Viet-

3. A more compelling reason, however, is the 
Laotian fear that if the allies mount mili-
tary operations from South Vietnam into the

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
HARDY SUBCOMMITTEE 
BURMA 
2 October 1967 
I. As for Burma, Peking since June has been call-
ing on the so-called "revolutionary masses" 
of Burma to overthrow the regime of General 
Ne Win, but has not posed an immediate mili-
tary threat. 
A. At one time, Ne Win made major efforts to 
establish close relations with China. The 
current frictions arise mainly from Chinese 
attempts to promote the Cultural Revolution 
in Burma. 
B. China's intensified propaganda broadcasts 
to Burma have centered on Burma's internal 
problems, particularly the current rice 
shortage and chronic insurgency. 
C. Reports of significant Chinese military 
concentrations in the border area, and of 
the provision of arms to Burmese insurgents, 
appear grossly exaggerated. 
II. The Burmese economy continues to deterioriate, 
mainly because of a lack of farmer incentives 
-74-
Approved ForRelease1.280p0?ftkt-FDP79T00827A001000060009-2 
Approvgil,ForlIQXeY0c/ag: CIA-RDP7K0827A001000060009-2 
and an ineffective government distribution 
system, while only minor reforms are made. 
A. Rice production for 1966-67 was about 65 
million tons, 1.4 million tons less than 
the previous year, resulting in an acute 
rice shortage. 
B. Rice riots have erupted in many parts of 
Burma. The most serious was at Akyab on 
August 13, when security forces killed 
.several rioters and wounded others. 
C. Rice export commitments have been reduced 
by about 25 per cent to meet critical do-
mestic needs. 
III. Burma's chronic insurgency problem persists at 
a high level, but the insurgents' effectiveness 
is limited by a lack of common objectives and 
unified direction. 
A. More than 20,000 insurgents, representing 
various Communist and tribal factions, are 
engaged in anti-government activities. 
B. Most of the ethnic insurgents, such as the 
Karen, Kachin, and Shan tribes, tradition-
ally have been both anti-Chinese and anti-
Communist.

C. Peking's endorsement of the White Flag 
Communists, who number somewhat more than 
4,000, has resulted in an intensified 
intra-party conflict and the loss of some 
leftist Karen support. 
D. The Red Flag Communists, with less than 
1,000 members, reportedly have called for 
a broad-based unity conference in support 
of the Ne Win regime. 
IV. Despite current Sino-Burmese differences, Ne 
Win is expected generally to continue his 
policy of neutrality, non-alignment, and non-
involvement in international affairs.

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
HARDY SUBCOMMITTEE 
INDIA 
2 October 1967 
I. On the Asian subcontinent, the primary short-
term aim of Peking is to keep India 
from becoming a rival to Communist China. 
A. The Chinese apparently hope that the vari-
ety of pressures they are able to apply to 
India will preoccupy New Delhi and limit 
Indian economic development to such an 
extent that India's international influence 
will be negligible. 
The Chinese do not appear interested in 
establishing Communist governments in South 
Asia in the near future, but probably hope 
that eventually economic decline and result-
ant chaos will allow them to do so. 
C. In the short run, the Chinese probably 
hope to increase their influence in Paki-
stan and Nepal, both as part of their 
effort against India, and as an end in 
itself. 
D. More pressing domestic and foreign problems

have diverted Peking's efforts, especially 
in the last year, and Chinese policies have 
had only partial success. 
II. At present, China appears reluctant to initiate 
any significant provocations. 
A. Minor border incidents occur frequently 
all along the disputed Sino-Indian border, 
and any of them could lead to something on 
the order of the Sikkim fighting at any 
time. 
B. The Indians have about three times as many 
troops on the border as the Chinese, and 
most of the scenes of border clashes are 
a thousand miles or more from Chinese rail-
heads. 
III. Pro-Peking Communists pose little internal 
threat to India. 
A. Indian Communists have split into two 
parties, the smaller of which generally 
favors the U.S.S.R.

C. The Communists failed to make significant 
gains in the last election, although 
greater cooperation among the opposition 
has allowed them to head one state govern-
ment (Kerala) and play a major part in 
another (West Bengal). 
D. Dissatisfaction in India tends to be ex-
pressed through religious, ethnic and 
regionalist radicalism, rather than eco-
nomic radicalism.

its own bomb.

significant, and could slow economic prog-
ress to a dangerous extent. 
B. The government is still against starting a nu-
clear weapons program, but domestic pres-
sure for such a program continues to mount.

2 October 1967 
I. Peking looks on Pakistan as a counterbalance 
to India on the subcontinent. 
A. Relations between India and Pakistan are 
inherently bad without any need for incite-
ment by Peking but the bitterness creates 
an opening for increased Chinese influence 
in Pakistan, and for Chinese encouragement 
of an arms race which neither Pakistan nor 
India can afford. 
II. The Pakistani government for its part, looks on 
relations with China as part of a three-cornered 
balancing act in which the United States and 
U.S.S.R. are also factors. 
A. President Ayub wants all the help he can get 
against India, and sees China as the only 
country likely to help him if war should 
break out again.

is its primary source.

C. Ayub is trying to weaken Moscow's support 
for New Delhi, and has had some success since 
1965. 
D. The Pakistanis are willing to go along with 
any of the three countries as long as the 
action doesn't hurt relations with the other 
two. This means avoiding any involvement in 
disagreements among the three over such issues 
as Vietnam. 
III. Pakistan's relations with Peking remain good, al-
though the Chinese have done little for the Paks 
lately. 
A. The Chinese in 1966 provided ftghter 
aircraft,

ments have now stopped, and there is no indi-
cation that any major renewal is in the works. 
B. Chinese economic aid projected for the period 
1965 through 1970 amounts to about $67 million, 
or only about tWO percent of the total for-
eign aid Pakistan expects to receive. 
C. Ayub views his relationship with Peking cynically, 
and probably doesn't trust the Chinese. 
D. Islamabad is worried about what the Cultural 
Revolution will do to Chinese support for Pakistan.

I. Cambodia is shielded from direct contact with 
China by intervening countries, but is never-

A. The volatile ruler, Prince Sihanouk, feels

Vietnamese Communists are using Cambodian ter-
ritory for logistics, asylum, and staging. He 
sees in these charges the grave danger that the 
war will spill over the border from Vietnam into 
Cambodia on a major scale. 
A. Sihanouk has tried to meet this threat by 
denying that the Vietnamese Communists use 
Cambodian territory. He has asked for an ex-
pansion of the International Control Commission 
(ICC) to inspect border areas. 
B. Last month, at Sihanouk's behest, the ICC 
made its first inspection of suspected North 
Vietnamese activity in northeast Cambodia.

command and support elements of as many 
as five North Vietnamese regiments are 
more or less permanently located in this 
area. 
C. The Cambodians are now showing some greater 
willingness to meet the Viet-Cong problem more 
directly. 
1. Sihanouk is trying to curtail the heavy 
smuggling traffic across the border. Border 
posts have been instructed to ensure that 
there is no illegal traffic in rice. 
2. Although some of his motivation is clearly 
economic, Sihanouk also realizes that much 
of the smuggling is going to the Viet Cong 
and, as a consequence, is increasing the 
threat of allied retaliation. 
3. We have captured enemy documents in which 
the Communists estimate that Cambodian

sanctuary will become more and more im-
portant to them as the war progresses. 
They also expect however, that it will 
become increasingly difficult for them 
to maintain this sanctuary as both Siha-
nouk's fears and allied pressures in-
crease. 
D. Sihanouk would obviously prefer that the 
Communists and allies alike stay on the Viet-
namese side of the border, but it is clear 
that he is both unable and unwilling to keep 
the Communist forces out of Cambodia. 
1. For one thing, much of the activity takes 
place in extremely rough and isolated 
areas along the 600-mile border, in the 
northeast provinces of Ratanakiri and 
Mondolkiri. It is in this area, border-
ing Vietnam's central highlands, that the 
Communists have established their infil-
tration routes and many of their base 
camps. It is an area over which Phnom 
Penh has never exercised much more than 
nominal control. 
2. In addition, Sihanouk apparently still be-
lieves that the Communists are ultimately

long as he does, it is unlikely that he 
will move in a meaningful way against 
them. 
3. Hanoi also gained major diplomatic ad-
vantage in June by recognizing and agree-
ing to respect Cambodia's present borders, 
thereby getting full diplomatic recogni-
tion from Sihanouk. On this matter, Saigon 
has been consistently unresponsive. 
III. Communist China has fared less well with Sihanouk 
in recent weeks. 
A. Cambodia's relations with Communist China 
deteriorated sharply when Sihanouk made his 
first explicit attack on Peking in a September 
speech. 
1. His anti-Chinese tirade was precipitated 
by a message sent by Peking to the Cambo-
dian-Chinese Friendship Association after 
Sihanouk had dissolved it for its "sub-
versive activities." 
2. Sihanouk's blow-up has been brewing for 
some time. He has bitterly resented Chi-

Cambodia, and the bizarre and insulting 
behavior of Chinese technicians there. 
The course of the war in Vietnam over 
the past two years, Peking's negative 
stand on negotiations, and the upheavals 
within China have caused Sihanouk to ques-
tion both the value and viability of close 
relations with China. 
B. At the urging of Chinese Premier Chou En-lai, 
Sihanouk decided to maintain at least the facade 
of normal relations with Peking. 
1. He fired the two remaining leftist cabinet 
members, however, and banned all nongovern-
ment newspapers in the country, indicating 
that he is determined to curtail leftist 
influence in Cambodia despite the possible 
consequences for his relations with China. 
IV. At the same time, Sihanouk has made it clear that 
a reconciliation with the west is not in the offing. 
A. He remains extremely critical of the U.S. 
presence in South Vietnam, supporting Hanoi's 
stand on negotiations.

A. Indonesia is convinced of Chinese involvement 
in the abortive Communist coup in 1965 
B. Violent demonstrations against the Chinese 
Embassy in Djakarta and against the Indonesian 
Embassy in Peking occur intermittently. 
C. Indonesia would like to withdraw its remaining

II. Domestically, the Indonesian Government, led by 
General Suharto as acting president, continues 
to give priority attention to its economic program. 
A. Indonesia has made progress, under the gen-
eral guidance of the International Monetary 
Fund, toward reviving its disastrously de-
teriorated economy, but much remains to be 
done. 
1. During the coming year, chief emphasis 
will still be on the anti-inflationary 
program, but modest development programs 
will begin. 
2. Development efforts will concentrate on 
Indonesia's long-neglected transportation 
and communication systems, the small tex-
tile industry, and programs to increase 
agricultural production.

B. Indonesia continues to require foreign eco-
nomic assistance, and plans to request ap-
proximately $325 million from Western donors 
for calendar year 1968. 
1. At least nine Western nations will meet 
in Amsterdam in November to consider 
Indonesia's request. 
2. Last year Western donors lent Indonesia 
$200 million; of this amount, the United 
States contributed $65 million and Japan 
$60 million. 
C. Another means of assistance adopted by both 
Western and Communist countries has been to 
reschedule payments on Indonesia's large for-
eign debt. 
1. Later this month Western creditors will 
discuss rescheduling of debt payments 
falling due in 1968 through 1970; pay-
ments due in 1967 have already been post-
poned. 
2. Rescheduling agreements with the Soviet 
Union, Indonesia's largest creditor, and 
with other Communist countries have either 
not been completed or have not been rati-
fied.

a. Indonesia has promised equal treatment 
to all creditors, and tentative bloc 
agreements appear no more favorable 
to Communist creditors than those ac-
corded to the West. 
III. Politically, the government is guided by its basic 
aims of continued suppression of Communism and 
the development of stable representative govern-
ment. 
A. The Suharto regime regards Communism as a con-
tinuing threat in view of the party's large 
following before the 1965 coup and the tradi-
tion of leftist nationalism and Communism in 
East and Central Java. These are the two

continued political role is essential to en-
sure national stability. 
B. Of the nation's two large parties, one--the 
National Party--has been reluctant to purge 
its large leftist membership or to abandon 
its adulation of Sukarno, the former presi-
dent. 
C. The other major party--the orthodox Muslim 
Nahdatul Ulama--shows no signs of abandoning 
its opportunittic policies, and is only a 
sometime supporter of the regime. 
D. A new Muslim party, approved by Suharto over 
two months ago, has yet to take shape. Its 
organizers are embroiled in internal dissen-
sion. 
E. Elections are still slated to be held by 
mid-1968, but parliament has been unable to 
agree on an election law, and a delay of a year 
or more is now assured.

TAIWAN 
2 October 1967 
I. The proclaimed policy of Communist China is to 
take Taiwan, and the proclaimed policy of 
Nationalist China is to recapture the mainland, 
but neither side has shown any great eagerness 
to launch major hostilities since 1958. 
A. The close proximity to the mainland of 
Nationalist troops on Quemoy and Matsu 
islands affords a continuing opportunity 
for hostilities. 
1. The United States is committed by treaty 
to defend Taiwan itself and the Pesca-
dores, but there is no formal obligation 
to defend the closer offshore islands. 
2. Peking is probably uncertain as to what 
the US would do in the event of an 
r and Matsu.

B. There is some concern, from Chiang on down, 
that the US might eventually compromise if 
it becomes bogged down in Vietnam. Generally, 
Nationalist leaders are reassured by the 
present firm stand. Some of them would like 
to see the war expand to Communist China, 
in the hope that this would create an open-
ing for the dwindling hope of a Nationalist 
return to the mainland. 
IV. The internal political situation on Taiwan re-
mains relatively stable. 
A. President Chiang and the two million main-
landers who escaped to Taiwan when the Com-
munists seized the mainland in 1949 hold 
political power. They virtually exclude 
the ten million native Taiwanese from posi-
tions of importance. The Taiwanese are 
resentful, but fragmented and unresisting.

C. The government is not likely to grant the 
Taiwanese any real political freedom in the 
foreseeable future, and the Taiwanese are 
unlikely to force the issue as long as they 
find room for their aspirations in a grow-
ing economy. 
D. The Communist party is outlawed, and the 
tight security system on the island would 
reveal any major Communist attempt at sub-
version. 
VIII. President Chiang is alert and in good health, 
but he will be 80 years old this month, and 
appears to be slowing down. 
A. During the past few years, Chiang has been 
grooming his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, to 
succeed him. 
B. The succession, however, is almost certain 
to be stormy. The younger Chiang will un-
doubtedly be the most powerful individual 
on Taiwan, but he is not well liked because 
of his long years as chief of the security 
services. He lacks his father's support in 
the party and military.

I. The Chinese Communists have embarked on a long-
range campaign to erode the position of the Brit-
ish authorities in Hong Kong, and prepare the 
ground for an eventual attempt by the local Com-
munists to seize control. 
A. There is a relative lull at present in the 
disorders which have shaken the British Crown 
Colony over the past five months. 
B. Although the Chinese Communists will refrain 
from actions against the colony involving 
the risk of war, they are likely to keep the 
issue hot, and to continue their support for 
dissident elements in the colony. 
C. The British are convinced that the best way 
to retain their existing rights is to take a 
strong stand against the disorders and against 
any humiliating Chinese demands. 
II. The confrontation grew out of local labor prob-
lems, indicating that the timing was not chosen

pace most of the time. 
A. Firm police action is keeping violence to a

bombings and occasional mob outbreaks, but 
incipient mass demonstrations have been 
broken up quickly. 
B. Public services are functioning, and shipping 
in Hong Kong harbor has not been seriously 
delayed. 
C. Food supplies from neighboring Kwantung Prov-
ince have been disrupted by the Cultural Rev-
olution turmoil, but there are no serious 
shortages so far.

Kong issue has dropped off, and Chinese Army

JAPAN 
2 October 1967 
I. Japan, protected by a defense treaty with the 
United States, does not consider Communist China 
an immediate threat, but the Japanese are becom-
ing increasingly concerned over the militancy, 
the apparent irrationality, and the rapid nuclear 
development of the Chinese. 
A. Japanese military authorities note that Japan 
will soon have to come to grips with the 
questions raised by China's new advanced wea-
pons capabilities. Japan lies within range 
of a Chinese MRBM. 
B. There is considerable public concern in Japan 
that the security relationship with the United 
States might involve Japan in Vietnam or 
other limited wars in Asia. 
C. Also, as Japan's ambitions for a broader Asian 
role grow, the Japanese are increasingly aware 
that their main competitor is going to be 
Communist China.

II. Over the past year, Japanese disenchantment with 
China has grown as the excesses of the Cultural 
Revolution have become more pronounced. 
A. Even the continuing high Japanese interest in 
trade with China is not enough to offset the 
damage to China's image in Japan. 
1. China is much more dependent on Japan's 
commerce than Japan is on China trade. 
2. Nevertheless, the economic disruption of 
the Cultural Revolution contributed to a 
substantial decrease in Japan-China trade 
'during the first six months of this year. 
B. The Japanese Government now views Communist 
China as the greatest threat to stability in 
the Far East. 
1. The Japanese fear that Peking might take 
some bold external action to bolster dis-
integrating internal authority. 
2. Chinese provocation of Asian nations--not-
ably Burma--has had adverse repercussions 
in Japan.

Asian nations are motivated, in part, 
by a desire to counter Peking's in-

III. We see only minimal chances that Japan will face 
any severe internal security threat over the 
next several years. 
A. The Japanese police and Self-Defense Forces 
appear capable of handling any mass disorders, 
and a leftist takeover by electoral victories 
is unlikely in the near future. 
1. The Japanese Communists are presently 
at odds with Peking, and their current 
party doctrine does not advocate violent 
overthrow of the government. 
2. As for elections, popular support for the 
left-wing parties declined in the last 
go-round. 
IV. Militarily, Japan is the host for the second 
largest U.S. foreign base establishment, a key 
element in the U.S. position of strength in the 
Far East. 
A. Japan's basic defense policy combines reliance 
on U.S. protection with a gradual build-up of 
indigenous security forces.

I. North Korea has considered Vietnam "the focal 
point" in the world struggle ever since the sum-
mer of 1965, when U.S. ground combat troops be-
gan to arrive in South Vietnam, and South Korea 
announced plans to dispatch a combat division.

U.S. and to help destroy--in Vietnam--"illu-

II. North Korea has tried to maintain an independent 
stand in the Sino-Soviet dispute since the summer 
of 1966, when it veered sharply away from the 
staunchly pro-Peking position it had held since 
1962. 
A. Pyongyang's security pacts with both the USSR 
and Communist China were reaffirmed this year, 
and North Korea could count on their help if 
it were invaded. 
B. Pyongyang, however, appears to have some 
doubts over the reliability of these allies 
C. 
in view of the USSR's dealings with the 
and China's Cultural Revolution. 
These considerations prompted North 
West 
Korea 
to eMphasize self-reliance and to build up 
its local, defensive militia forces. 
In October, 1966, North Korea embarked on a pro-
gram of violent action against South Korea which 
has included armed harassment, agent infiltra-
tion, and sabotage. 
A. Armed incidents at the Korean DMZ this year 
reached more than 340 by mid-September, com-
pared with 42 in 1966, 55 in 1965, and 32 in 
1964.

in or out of South Korea.

IV. North Korean concern over Vietnam appears to be 
the primary reason for the shift to more militant 
tactics. 
A. Pyongyang probably is trying to discourage 
South Korea from sending more troops to South 
Vietnam, keep South Korean and U.S. forces 
off balance, and test military capabilities 
and reactions. The North Koreans probably 
mean to stay below the level which could pro-
voke major retaliation. 
B. They also may hope their actions will place 
a strain on U.S.-South Korea relations, since 
the South Koreans are known to be chafing 
under U.S. restraints against retaliation. 
C. There is no evidence of a North Korean mili-
tary build up or of impending North Korean 
plans for a major military action. 
V. The South Koreans, with U.S. help, have reacted 
vigorously to the North Korean harassment.

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
HARDY SUBCOMMITTEE 
VIETNAM 
2 October 1967 
I. North Vietnam's position on negotiations remains 
as stated by its Foreign Minister in January 1967: 
there can be no talks unless the U.S. uncondi-
tionally ends its bombing and all other acts of 
war against North Vietnam. 
A. Hanoi is particularly insistent that there-
will be no reciprocity on its part for a 
cessation of the bombings. 
B. North Vietnamese spokesmen have been less 
than forthcoming on exactly what Hanoi would 
be willing to talk about? should the U.S. 
agree to end the bombing. 
C. Some North Vietnamese officials have in-
timated that Hanoi would be willing to talk 
only about matters affecting North Vietnam, 
and would insist that the U.S. deal directly 
with the Liberation Front on matters concern-
ing South Vietnam.

D. As for eventual settlement of the war, the 
North Vietnamese are still sticking to their 
Four Points. 
II. Hanoi's determination to stick to its hard line 
is apparently based on the belief that Communist 
forces in South Vietnam can not be decisively 
beaten by the number of troops they estimate the 
United States will put into South Vietnam. Par-
allel with this is the belief that North Vietnam 
can continue to withstand any level of conven-
tional bombing without losing its ability to carry 
on the war effort. 
Strategy  
A. North Vietnamese Defense Minister Vo Nguyen 
Giap has just published a lengthy analysis 
of the war in which he states that even if 
the U.S. puts another 200,000 men into South 
Vietnam,the,Communi'st$ can maintain a mili-
tary "stalemate," a situation he believes will 
ultimately produce war weariness in the U.S. 
and a willingness to give Hanoi what it wants. 
1. Giap's intention, judging both from what 
he says and what the Communists are do-
ing, is to concentrate the bulk of his 
-115-

w' 
Aphipaved For ReleMOVOCMGARKFA-R61079T00827A001000060009-2 
regular forces in a few strategic areas, 
rather than disperse them less effectively 
throughout the country. 
2. Such an area is carefully chosen olose 
to a safehaven, so that troops can be 
quickly withdrawn or reinforced. 
3. Giap claims the area just south of the 
Demilitarized Zone is ideal as a stra-
tegic zone, and he implies that the 
highlands area close to Laos and Cam-
bodia is another. 
B. Giap's strategy is to force the U.S. to draw 
off troop strength from other areas of Swath 
Vietnam to meet the challenge in the DMZ and 
the Western Highlands. 
1. This relieves U.S. pressure on coastal 
and southern areas and enables Communist 
guerrillas and local forces, in conjunc-
tion with limited numbers of main force 
units, to operate more effectively. 
-116-

Apizpved For Re14(0P003$1kVolitF,EFA-RWF79T00827A001000060009-2 
2. It is interesting to note that the bulk 
of infiltrating North Vietnamese units 
during 1967 have been committed to the 
northern portion of South Vietnam. 
C. General Giap undoubtedly intends the build-
up of Communist forces in and south of the 
DMZ to accomplish more than just the relief of 
U.S. pressure on local Communists further 
south. 
1. He would like very much to inflict at 
least one fairly sizeable defeat on U.S. 
forces, and would be willing to take 
heavy casualties himself to gain such a 
victory. 
2. He will follow the course he laid out 
more than ten years ago against the 
French, gradually building up his forces 
in the DMZ area, increasing the level 
of artillery and heavy weapons fire on 
U.S. outposts, stepping up guerrilla 
actions behind the line, and interference 
with U.S. lines of communication.

pmgoved For Relas?005/FORIVA-Ria,79T00827A001000060009-2 
3. He is unlikely to throw his troops 
rashly against a heavily fortified U.S. 
position unless and until he believes 
he has enough troops to neutralize the 
U.S. force and to offset the ability of 
the U.S. to support its troops with 
artillery, air support and reinforce-
ments. 
III. In certain measure, General Giap's strategic 
plan has been forced on him by the success of 
U.S. military operations in South Vietnam. 
A. In some areas of South Vietnam, Communist 
main force units have been dealt heavy 
blows; many Communist base areas have been 
destroyed; planned Communist military 
operations have been disrupted; and the 
Communist political apparatus has been 
pressed hard. 
1. As a result, some Communist main force 
units have been avoiding large scale 
combat for the past six months. 
2. They have been concentrating instead on 
small-unit operations, sporadic mortar

Apivved For Rele're@20 REM-RD4879T00827A001000060009-2 
and rocket attacks, mining of roads, and 
other unconventional actions. 
3. By these tactics, the Communists have 
managed to stay in the field, cut losses 
and still tie down large numbers of U.S. 
and Allied troops. 
Enemy Manpower  
IV. At present, Communist main force strength in 
South Vietnam is an estimated 118,000. Of these, 
about 54,000 are North Vietnamese. 
A. In addition, there are an estimated 70,000 
to 90,000 full-time, armed Communist guer-
rillas in South Vietnam. 
B. The Communists also have a poorly armed, 
largely untrained irregular force called 
the militia or self-defense force, which 
may have numbered about 150,000 in 1966. 
It has probably declined in strength since 
that time, however. 
C. Other organized Communist elements include 
a military logistic and administrative support 
at least 
service of/35,000 to 40,000 men, and about 
80,000 political functionaries.

Appiwied For Relei0/10(SHORMIA-RDIRalliT00827A001000060009-2 
D. All of these people contribute in one way 
or another to the Communist war effort, and 
take a share of the casualties. 
V. Thus far during 1967, about 60,000 Communist 
personnel have been }called in action, according 
to the Allied body count. This is more than the 
total for all of 1966. 
A. To offset these losses, the Communists rely 
on two sources: infiltration from North Viet-
nam, and recruitment in South Vietnam. 
Infiltration  
1. In 1966, at least 55,000 and possibly 
as many as 85,000 North Vietnamese troops 
were infiltrated into South Vietnam. 
2. Thus far in 1967, we have information on 
the movement of at least 23,000 and pos-
sibly as many as 35,000. 
3. There may have been many more, but 
because of the considerable time lag--as 
much as six months--in detecting many of 
the infiltrating groups, it may be some 
time before the true total can be 
ascertained.

ARvved For Relefir2MgR2WICIA-R1079T00827A001000060009-2 
B. There appears, however, to have been a major 
change both in the character and in the purpose 
of infiltration since mid-1966. 
1. In the first part of 1966, it appeared 
that the North Vietnamese were attempting 
to match the build-up of Allied forces in 
South Vietnam and were pumping regular 
infantry units as well as fillers and re-
placements south at a heavy rate. Almost 
all of these men and units came through 
Laos and were sent to areas considerably 
south of the Demilitarized Zone. 
2. In addition, there was considerable evi-
dence that the Viet Cong were beefing up 
their main force units and were even de-
pleting their guerrilla and militia forces 
to do so. 
3. All this was in keeping with the plan 
advocated by General Nguyen Chi Thanh, then 
commander of the Communist forces in South 
Vietnam. - 
4. General Thanh believed that Communist forces, 
supplemented both from North Vietnam and

from assets in South Vietnam, could 
maintain the military moment= gained in 
1965 against the South Vietnamese Army. 
5. His view was opposed rather vigorously 
by a group of generals led by Defense 
Minitter Giap, who apparently argued that 
the Communists could not match the U.S. 
either in numbers of troops Or in fire-
power, but instead would have to rely on 
superior tactics. 
C. It appears that a decision was reached in 
Hanoi in mid'-1966 to slow down on the infiltra-
tion of regular North Vietnamese infantry units 
and to switch the major military effort to the 
DMZ area. 
1. In part this decision was the result of 
experience on the battlefield which proved 
Giap correct. 
2. In part also, the decision may have been 
reached because the Communists had reached 
a basic force structure they believed suf-
ficient for the kind of war Giap intended 
to wage.

Recruitment Potentials  
VI. An examination of North Vietnam's manpower and 
mobilization potential reveals that Hanoi can con-
tinue to send men to South Vietnam at a rate of 
about 75,000 to 100,000 per year without strain. 
A. North Vietnam cOuld double this number, but 
it would require a maximum effort which would 
be difficult to sustain. 
1. These figures are based upon an estimated 
two million physically fit males between 
the ages of 15 and 49 available for mili-
tary service. 
2. So far, only those between 17 and 35 
have actually been drafted. 
3. Some North Vietnamese boys under 17 years 
of age have been picked up in South Vietnam, 
but these appear to be isolated instances 
in which a local North Vietnamese official 
may have dipped into the younger age group 
to meet his draft quota. 
B. Some 110,000 physically fit youths reach draft 
age each year, the majority of whom are drafted. 
1. North Vietnam does not appear to have 
reached the bottom of its manpower barrel.

We have seen no indication that it has 
diverted a significant portion of man-
power from such areas as consumer ser-
vices, education, or the private business 
sector of the economy. 
2. There are an estimated 350,000 males in 
these sectors, at least some of whom could, 
if necessary, be put into the army. 
VII. North Vietnam has managed to expand its own armed 
forces at home at the same time that it has sent 
large numbers of men to South Vietnam. 
A. At present, we estimate that North Vietnam's 
in-country armed force is about 384,000, includ-
ing infantry, air defense and all other com-
ponents. 
1. In 1965, before the U.S. combat involve-
ment in the war, the strength of the North 
Vietnamese armed forces was estimated to 
be about 225,000; 
2. According to a recent statement by the 
Chief of Staff of the North Vietnamese 
Army, the present force level in North 
Vietnam is sufficient for the present level

of fighting, suggesting that the military 
drain on North Vietnamese manpower resources 
this year will be relatively small compared 
to that of the last two years. 
3. This, in turn, will free more men to be 
sent to South Vietnam. 
VIII. We cannot be precise about the manpower resources 
available to the Communists within South Vietnam, 
but we estimate that the Viet Cong have access to 
approximately 1.5 million males between the ages 
of 15 and 45. 
A, Allowing for those already in the various Com-
munist organizations and those :unfit for useful 
service, there remains a pool of some 700,000 
to 800,000 men of military age. 
B. The Viet Cong are having trouble recruiting 
from this pool, however, because of other re-
quirements such as farming, and because mounting 
U.S. pressure on Viet Cong controlled areas is 
causing people to flee from the Communists. 
1. It is estimated that Communist ability to 
recruit men in South Vietnam has dropped 
from a high of about 7,000 per month in 1966 
to about 3,000 to 5,000 per month in 1967.

2. As result, the Viet Cong have become 
increasingly dependent upon North Vietnam 
to provide replacements and new units for 
the main forces. 
sup211,22. 
IX. Communist forces in South Vietnam also need a 
regular flow of supplies from outtide the country 
to keep the war going at the present level. 
A. Present requirements from outside sources run 
about 55 to 60 tons per day. That includes 40 to 45 
tons a day of food, almost all of which comes from 
Cambodia directly or through Laos. 
1. Weapons and other quartermaster-type goods 
represent about 5 tons per day of the total 
requirement, and ammunition accounts for 
about 9 tons per day. 
B. Communist dependence on outside sources of 
supply is growing. 
1. In part this is due to the growing pro-
portion of North Vietnamese troops in South 
Vietnam who are increasingly armed with 
heavier weapons and who are positioned in 
many instances in food deficit areas.

North Vietnamese Economy  
X. As for the economy of North Vietnam, the war has 
stripped away the few modern industrial trappings 
that North Vietnam had managed to accumulate before 
the war. 
A. A handful of industrial plants given by 
China and the USSR had begun to supplement 
the cottage industry accounting for most 
North Vietnamese production. These plants 
have stopped or severely curtailed production. 
B. Construction of new industries with Communist 
assistance has virtually stopped. 
C. Agricultural production has been so disrupted 
i.rtcreAstot 
by the war that4food imports are now necessary 
to maintain ration levels. 
1. This one vital economic activity of North 
Vietnam has suffered from the loss of 
managerial cadres, manpower, and investment 
resources to the war effort. 
2. The disruptions of war, combined with the 
usual weather and insect problems, have 
brought three poor rice harvests in succes-
sion since the spring of 1966.

3. Food imports, largely from the Soviet 
Union and China, have sustained ration 
levels, but the population grumbles at 
the unfamiliar wheat flour and other 
rice substitutes issued as part of their 
rations. 
D. Economic plans drafted during the war allot 
the bulk of investment to the transportation 
system and the development of local industries. 
1. The money for maintaining and expanding 
transport routes is coming mostly from 
increased foreign aid. 
2. Hanoi hopes that more local industries 
would provide the simple tools for farm 
production and consumer goods for daily 
life, but the program to increase these 
industries has lagged badly, 
E. With continued Communist assistance, there is 
no reason the economy cannot go on supporting 
the current level of war activities. 
1. However, the government is falling farther 
and farther behind in acquiring the indus-
tries it feels are a necessary part of 
economic development.

F. The destruction of transport and electric 
power facilities has affected ecollcmic as 
well as war activities. 
1. The transport of war goods is being 
carried out successfully, if at great 
cost in manpower and materials, but civil-
ian passenger transport and postal deliv-
eries have been curtailed. 
South Vietnam 
XI, The reorientation of the South Vietnamese Army 
(ARVN) toward a pacification mission has given in-
creased responsibility for combat operations against 
the Communist main forces to the U.S. and other 
allied forces. 
A. The current strength of the South Vietnamese 
armed forces totals about 735,800. This figure 
includes 327,700 regulars, 343,700 paramilitary 
Regional and Popular Forces, and 64,500 police 
forces.

B. Some 54 of ARVN's total 154 maneuver battalions 
are currently assigned to a pacification or Rev-
olutionary Development support mission. At least 
61 battalions remain on combat assignment. 
C. A reorganization of the Regional and Popular 
Forces is now in the mill to include retraining 
for a pacification defense mission, a stepped up 
U.S. advisory effort, and improved logistic 
support. 
ARVN Performance 
XII. The over-all performance of South Vietnam's armed 
forces remains spotty. Some improvements' in combat 
and morale are evident, but serious weaknesses 
remain. 
Statistics 
A. The desertion rate for regular forces, 14.4 per 
month per thousand in 1966, is down to about 10.7 
so far this year. A similar trend is apparent 
in the paramilitary forces. 
B. The number of ARVN operations achieving contact 
With the enemy remains significantly below that 
achieved by other allied forces, but is improving. 
The small-unit contact rate, down about 50 percent 
last year from 1965 figures, is again rising.

ApproNitliFor Releasalig14/08inegi&IIDP79.1450827A001000060009-2 
ARVN operations in battalion strength or greater, 
making contact about 40 percent of the time in 
early 1966 and early 1967, now have risen to 45 
percent. 
C. Weekly South Vietnamese combat fatalities, 
averaging 216 in 1965, dropped to about 183 in 
1966, are back up to about 210 a week at present. 
(The U.S. weekly average, which is now about 
double the rate for 1966 but also reflects a much 
larger combat commitment, was about 215 for the 
second quarter of 1967, slightly above the Viet-
namese rate.) 
D. The ratio of weapons lost by the government and 
by the enemy, running against the South Vietna-
mese as late as the latter half of 1965, has 
been reversed and now favors the government by 
about three and a half to one. 
XIII. Leadership remains a major factor in the ARVN 
shortcomings. 
A. This problem results from a traditional practice 
of selecting and assigning officers on a basis 
of political consideration rather than merit, 
and from continued tolerance of corruptionand 
inefficiency at all levels.

B. Although Vietnam's military leadership plans 
to purge some 50 or more officers, including 
some of general's and field grade rank, it 
appears unrealistic to expect the early elimina-
tion of favoritism, corruption and incompetence 
from the armed forces. 
C. ARVN recruiting continues to suffer from the 
severe competition--both military and civilian--
for manpower. 
D. Troop discipline has improved, but some abuses 
of the local population and of prisoners and 
detainees persist. 
Revolutionary Development  
XIV. The ARVN battalions now assigned to Revolutionary 
Development support have been specially trained for 
their mission, which brings them into closer contact 
with the local populace. 
A. Although some battalions are proving effective 
in providing increased security for development 
activities and in conducting their own civic 
action projects, ARVN's over-all performance 
in its pacification mission continues to reveal 
weaknesses.

B. A few battalions, for example, have apparently 
actually committed only some subordinate com-
panies to RD support; others are apparently 
rotating between pacification support and 
regular combat duty. 
C. In some cases, battalions do not appear to be 
deployed so as to provide an effective security 
shield for Revolutionary Development workers. 
XV. Although progress in the Revolutionary Development 
program has been uneven and setbacks have occurred, 
nearly all aspects of pacification have registered 
some gains over the past year. 
A. According to South Vietnamese Government figures, 
slightly over one-third of South Vietnam's 
12,500 hamlets (or about 4,700) were rated secure 
,a14. 
as of 31 July this year. 
6**,..Arroftwozgei.?...' 
1. These figures are a rough measure of rural 
security, but cannot be considered absolute; 
they cannot be firmly equated with the find-
ings of a new U.S. system introduced this 
year for measuring pacification progress in 
terms of both security and effective govern-
ment presence.

2. Under the new U.S. criteria, more than 
-A1.4 
5,000 hamlets have been found to have some 
more or less effective degree of security 
and government authority, but their individual 
ratings vary widely; the total U.S. figure 
is roughly similar, however, to the total 
hamlets which the Saigon government regards 
as secure day and night or in daytime only. 
B. There are at present some 570 Revolutionary 
Development teams in the field, compared to 533 
9.* 
at the end of July; current training schedules 
call for about 615 by the end of 1967. 
1. The performance and strength of these teams 
varies, but with each team expected to work 
in about two hamlets this year, the first 
semester's goals had been generally accom-
plished by September. 
2. The main problems are with team leadership 
and the technical training of team members. 
The first is being corrected with inten-
sified leadership training. It will not be 
easy to overcome the team member shortcomings.

the most effective concerted effort to date to 
counter Viet Cong influence at the local level. 
the enemy regards the program as a tnreat. 
1. Through August this year, there were 797 Com-
munist incidents directed against RD teams, 
resulting in almost 360 RD personnel 
killed. 
2. The incident rate has more than doubled 
since the beginning of this year, and was 
at an all time high in August.

Chieu Hoi 
F. Another aspect of the pacification effort, the 
Chieu Hoi or defector program, has been bringing 
in almost twice as many Communists each year 
since 1964. 
1. In 1967, throu h mid-
r, 22,852
persons have rallied, compared to 12,666 
for the sara_kHiod last year, and about 
22,000 persons in all of 1966. 
Population Control  
XVI. The government's control over the population has 
been steadily expanding. 
A. In contrast to three years ago, when slightly 
less than half Of the total South Vietnamese 
population was under government control, as of 
Amm....mmaavamr.4 
July this:year some two-thirds of the country's 
estimated 17,100,000 persons were living in 
government-controlled or influenced areas. 
B. Some of this increase reflects an expansion 
of secure areas, but much of it represents rural 
migration to towns and cities, and a flow of 
refugees--about a million and a half refugees 
in a year
...a7?d a half--from contested or Com-
munist-controlled territory to government areas.

C. So far, only one complete province--An Giang 
in the delta--is considered essentially pacified, 
Considerable progress has been made in areas 
along the coast in South Vietnam's II Corps, 
as well as in scattered districts throughout 
the country. 
Political Situation  
XVII. Despite relatively favorable prospects for politi-
cal stability under South Vietnam's newly elected 
government, there are several storm clouds on the 
horizon which could change the atmosphere. 
A. The charges raised by many disappointed presi-
dential and senatorial candidates against the 
conduct of the September elections have served 
to detract from the victory of the military 
ticket and to accentuate its minority mandate--
34.8 percent of the total .vote--in relation to 
the combined vote for civilian candidates. 
1. This problem could be eased by the appoint-
ment of a largely civilian cabinet. The 
military leaders reportedly intend to occupy 
only a few cabinet positions vital to the 
war effort, and to rely on technicians 
rather than politicians for their civilian 
complement.

B. The militant Buddhists under Tri Quang are 
already beginning to test their 
the new government, partly over 
question, and partly because of 
influence against 
a religious 
resentment over 
the heavy Catholic representation in the new 
senate. 
1. The militants have been seriously weakened 
since their 1966 struggle, but they retain 
some ability to generate emotional issues 
which could seriously strain the new regime. 
2. Their potential has been enhanced somewhat 
by their recent alliance with several 
defeated presidential candidates for the 
purpose of trying 
the elections. 
3. This alliance may 
position channels 
to invalidate or discredit 
be directed into legal op-
if the Buddhists and their 
current disgruntled political allies gain 
some representation in the lower house, to 
be elected on October 22nd. 
4. On the other hand, these groups may decide 
to boycott the election and to try to work 
for overthrow of the government through street 
action.

C. Student groups have also become restive, partly 
under apparent prodding by the defeated candidates 
and possibly with some Buddhist or Communist 
encouragement. 
1. An ominous note in recent demonstrations 
has been increasing criticism of the war 
effort, and of alleged. U.S. interference in 
internal South Vietnamese affairs. 
2. There are some indications that the present 
government is prepared to crack down on dis-
ruptive elements before they can get out of 
hand; it has already suspended or closed 
several irresponsible newspapers, and has 
revived long-standing legal charges against 
Truong Dinh Dzu, the runner-up in the presi-
dential elections. 
XVIII. At present, SOUth Vietnam's military leadership 
appears to have closed ranks in an effort to ensure 
that the new Thieu government will be stable and 
generally responsive to military interests within its 
constitutional framework. 
A. There continue, however, to be underlying strains 
which could undermine military unity and the 
degree of stability it has brought the country.

B. The most serious problem remains the rivalry 
between Thieu and Ky, which appears to have 
sharpened as a result of the military agreement 
that Ky take second place on their presidential 
ticket. 
1. The contest between Thieu and Ky for power 
in the new government has not been fully 
resolved but their initial clash over the 
selection of a new prime minister may have 
been papered over when the senior generals 
endorsed Ky's preference. 
2. Ky, abetted by followers who hope to retain 
influence by riding on his coattails, is 
likely to continue probing for areas in which 
he can pressure Thieu into sharing presiden-
tial power. 
3. Thieu, in turn, appears acutely sensitive 
to the danger of becoming Ky's front man, 
and is likely to continue maneuvering to 
reduce Ky's influence. 
C. Although this rivalry could at any time result 
in an open breach with potentially serious 
repercussions, the senior generals presently 
appear able to restrain both men in the interest 
of military unity.

1. This situation may eventually evolve into 
a perpetuation of collective military rule 
behind a constitutional facade. 
2. A civilian-dominated legislature should 
offer some check on the military, but could 
prove troublesome unless it can also cooperate 
with the executive. 
D. Another potential threat to future political 
stability lies in the attitude of a number of 
field grade officers generally identified as 
the "Baby Turks." 
1. This element has for some time clamored 
for reforms to stamp out military corrup-
tion and inefficiency, and tends to be some-
what critical of the political role of the 
generals. 
2. The anticipated purge of corrupt officers 
from the military service may tend to mollify 
the complaints of the "Baby Turks." 
3. The new government's problems should be 
further eased if it can move rapidly to 
articulate and implement other programs 
offering some early promise of tangible 
political, social and economic reforms.
