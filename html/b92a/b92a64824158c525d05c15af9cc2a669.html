 Angola:   Renewing Old Acquaintances
 A delegation from the Soviet-backed Popular
 Movement for the Liberation of Angola, one of the
 three liberation groups that share power in Angola's
 transitional government, is visiting Peking.   The
 delegation is led by Lucie Lara, deputy to Agostinho
 Neto, the Movement's president, who visited Peking
 himself in 1971.  Lara probably will attempt to
 convince the Chinese to reduce or cease their sup-
 port to the National Front for the Liberation of
 Angola, the Movement's major rival.   He perhaps
 will even seek to obtain some support for the
 Popular Movement.
 The Popular Movement and the National Front
 are about evenly matched in Angola.   Peking has
 provided the Front with modest amounts of arms
 and ammunition and has assigned about 1.00 military
 advisers to the Front's training camps in Zaire.
 The two liberation groups have been arch-rivals
 since the early 1960s.  During the insurgency they
 clashed with each other almost as often as they
 did with Portuguese troops.  All-out war between
 them remains a strong possibility, and the Popular
 Movement could emerge the winner.  Peking's decision
 to host representatives of the Popular Movement,
 ending a hiatus of a year and a half, may be in part
 a recognition of the organization's growing political
 strength in recent months.
 The invitation to the Popular Movement also ap-
 pears part of a larger effort by the Chinese to spread
 their influence to all three Angolan groups.  About
 a month ago a group representing the National Union
 for the Total Independence of Angola, the smallest

 of the three organizations, visited China and was
 promised a small amount of military aid..   Peking
 has been channeling funds to this organization
 for at least the past year.  The Chinese probably
 will continue to channel the bulk of the military
 assistance to the National Front.
 China's move to broaden its influence among
 Angolan groups may stem from its concern about the
 growing rift between Zairian President Mobutu and
 the National Front over the future of oil-rich
 Cabinda.  The Angolans assert that the exclave is
 part of their country, but Mobutu has yet to recog-
 nize this claim.   Peking may fear that should
 Mobutu withdraw his support from the National Front,
 this could only strengthen the Popular Movement and
 the National Union.   Even before the Cabinda dispute
 began to gain momentum, Zaire's severe economic prob-
 lems placed restraints on its aid flow to the National
 Front.
 Contact with the Popular Movement and National
 Union at this point can only help ensure that Peking
 will be well positioned when Angola gains its
 independence in November--even if this means irritat-
 ing Mobutu by dealing with the Popular Movement.
 Mobutu has long been at odds with the Popular Move-
 ment.

 Progress in the Provinces
 The appointment of a first secretary in Hupeh
 and the initial results of "get tough" measures
 aimed at dissident workers indicate that Peking is
 making progress on two of its bigger headaches:
 demilitarization of provincial party committees and
 restoration of labor discipline in Chinese factories.
 The new first secretary is Chao Hsin-chu, a
 cultural revolution purge victim who was rehabil-
 itated two years ago. Like other recent appointees,
 Chao is a veteran civilian administrator who seems
 to have close ties to the moderate group now in com-
 mand in Peking.
 The appointment of Chao points up Peking's
 continuing drive to remove military men from major
 provincial posts. In Hupeh, the center passed over
 the ranking party secretary (a military man) to
 name Chao, the most senior of the civilian secre-
 taries, to the top post, which was last filled by
 one of the senior military commanders rotated 18
 months ago. Moreover, Chao is the fourth first sec-
 retary named in the past five months; all have been
 civilians, and all have replaced military men. Only
 eight provinces still have an active duty army of-
 ficer as first secretary, down from 17 just two years
 ago.
 Although determined to ease military men out
 of traditionally civilian political posts, Peking's
 attitude toward disfavored officers seems to have
 changed in the past year. During the height of the
 anti-Confucius campaign, Peking seemed intent on
 purging a number of them outright. Now, the center
 has apparently decided instead to reassign some of
 them to purely military duties. The former first
 secretary of Shansi has been appearing in Peking,

 where he may be performing military duties, and the
 former boss of Tsinghai has apparently been trans-
 ferred to Shantung after a stint at the center.  Also,
 career officers who have managed to stay on the right
 side of central authorities are being rewarded. Foochow
 Military Region Commander Pi Ting-chun is the latest
 provincial army officer to lead a military friendship
 delegation abroad.                                                          25X1
 Peking's efforts to increase worker discipline
 and boost lagging production also seem to be bearing
 fruit-IF                                    I                               25X1
 The improvement is at least partially attribut-
 able to new "get tough" measures authorized by Peking
 in March. Wages are being withheld from workers who
 claim to be "ill" or whose productivity has dropped
 significantly. Rail disruptions of all sorts are the
 target of another strict directive. Threats have been
 coupled with incentives, too. Some bonuses are being
 paid to workers, evidently based as much on their
 attitude as on their performance. Similar measures
 have been used before with limited success, but the
 proletarian dictatorship campaign with its strong
 law-and-order undertones and its stress on punishing
 economic misdeeds seems to have provided new force.
 Formidable problems remain in both the provinces
 and the economy,-despite Peking's latest efforts.  Ap-
 pointing a new first secretary is only part of the
 story; each new leader--like Chao Hsin-chu--must
 establish his authority before he can effectively
 deal with the problems of a particular province.
 Some have had difficulty doing so, like Tan Chi-lung
 in Chekiang, and others who seem to be relatively
 successful--like Chao Tzu-yang of Kwangt.ung--face

 not yet really come to grips with its causes.

 Concern About Textile Expar  Restrictions
 F_              I
 The Chinese are showing increasing concern over
 a depressed world market for their textiles, tradi-
 tionally a major earner of hard currency.   Countries
 running a large trade surplus with China are re-
 ceiving particular attention, and Chinese trade of-
 ficials are threatening some with retaliatory action
 for alleged discrimination.  With other countries,
 notably the US,  they are taking a conciliatory at-
 titude in an effort to increase textile exports to
 the American market.
 Australia, which is seeking to restrain imports
 of Chinese textiles, has received the bluntest warn-
 ing.   The PRC has threatened to reduce wool purchases
 if textile exports are disrupted.   This type of threat
 is not unique in Sino-Australian trade relations.
 Twice in the 1960s, China responded to curbs in Aus-
 tralian footwear imports by cutting purchases of Aus-
 tralian hides.
 With regard to Japan, China's textile trade last
 year was aimed at importing cloth and yarn and export-
 ing finished garments.  Although there is no contractual
 link between sales and purchases, the Chinese feel a
 strong moral commitment exists to balance roughly this
 trade agreement.   They were extremely annoyed that they
 imported large amounts of cloth and yarn without
 reciprocity by the Japanese.   Exports of Japanese
 textile products to China rose from $63 million in 1973
 to more than $200 million last year, but Chinese ex-
 ports of clothing to Japan only doubled,  from $47 mil-
 lion in 1973 to $100 million in 1974.   If this trend
 continues, China may resort to the same type of threat
 against Japan that it has used with Australia.

 There has been some concern by US textile
 producers over the rising amount of imported Chinese
 textiles.   Textile imports to the US of $38 million
 in 1974, up from $12 million in 1973, however, rep-
 resent less than 1 percent of total US textile im-
 ports.   In the event of US import restrictions on
 PRC textiles, retaliatory action is unlikely.   Any
 reduction in imports of Chinese cotton, a ,textile
 related product, is more likely to be tied to a
 rise in cotton output in China.  Moreover, cotton
 imports from the US are contracted for through
 private firms instead of a national organization,
 making it difficult to exert political leverage.

 An Unhappy Anniversary for Chiang Ching
 The anniversary on May 23 of Mao's talks on
 literature and art was greeted with the customary
 outpouring of propaganda and a month-long festival
 sponsored by the Ministry of Culture. Missing from
 this year's festivities, however, is any, direct
 mention of China's cultural czar, Chiang Ching.
 Neither Radio Peking nor the provinces referred
 to Chiang Ching in their broadcasts commemorating
 the anniversary. Last year, by contrast, four
 provinces mentioned her--Heilungkiang on three
 separate occasions. It may be significant that the
 then party boss of Heilungkiang, military man Wang
 Chia-tao, seems now to be in political trouble.
 Madame Mao did manage to elbow her way into
 the anniversary celebration, but not without
 difficulty. The only mention of her name occurred
 not in China but in Hong Kong, in the PRC-controlled
 newspaper Wen Hui Pao, which has appeared to act
 as a mouthpiece for Chiang Ching. In an interview
 with a Peking musician, the paper carried his
 reference to a 1965 instruction from Chiang Ching
 on composing a "revolutionary" symphony.
 In Peking, People's Daily ran an unexceptional
 article on May 23 under the pseudonym Chu Lan,
 who seems to be Chiang Ching or someone who writes
 on her behalf. The article lacked the usual
 stridency of earlier Chu Lan pieces, however, and
 seemed to follow the propaganda line established
 the previous day by Liang Hsiao, another pseudonym
 for an obviously authoritative person whose identity
 is not clear but who generally adopts a moderate
 position. The only distinguishing feature of Chu
 Lan's article was its bold praise of Chiang Ching's

 "model" cultural works, which were said to have
 borne "rich fruit." Liang Hsiao merely wrote that
 the model works "exemplified" the current revolu-
 tion in culture.
 Chiang Ching's minuscule role in this year's
 anniversary is another sign of her diminishing
 political status. She has made only six public
 appearances this year. The Chinese media have
 praised her by name only three times since the
 beginning of the year, and only once from Peking.
 Interestingly, Madame Mao's political woes do
 not seem to have affected Yao Wen-yuan,- generally
 regarded as her closest associate. Yao has logged
 some 26 public appearances this year, most of them
 since April. In the past, Yao's public appearances
 roughly paralleled those of Chiang Ching. He has
 maintained a fairly high public profile, however,
 since he took part in substantive talks with visit-
 ing North Korean President Kim Il-song in April.
 For the moment at least, it appears that Yao's
 political fortunes are not so closely linked to
 Madame Mao's as they once were. Should this state
 of affairs continue, it would seem likely that Yao,
 sensing that his future would be limited if he con-
 tinued to throw in his lot with Chiang Ching, had
 tried to seek a modus vivendi with those in the
 leadership whose future appears reasonably secure
 in the post-Mao/Chou era.

 Pressuring Taipei
 Peking's efforts to pressure the Chinese Na-
 tionalists into some form of communication with
 the mainland continue to be rebuffed by Taipei.
 Ten former Nationalist officers, released by
 Peking earlier this year as part of an amnesty of
 "Kuomintang war criminals," have been in Hong Kong
 for nearly two months awaiting Taipei's decision on
 their applications to visit Taiwan. On June 2, the
 Hong Kong government granted the releasees a one-
 month extension of their stay in the colony; it was
 the fourth such extension since they arrived on April
 14. Taipei has made it clear that the releasees will
 not be granted permission to enter Taiwan unless
 they are willing to publicly declare their opposition
 to Peking.
 Since Taipei certainly recognizes that it would
 be extremely awkward for the "war criminals" to re-
 verse their well-publicized pro-Peking positions,
 it is clear that Taipei is in no mood to do any
 kind of business now with Peking.
 Taipei is also very much aware of the ramifica-
 tions of admitting the "war criminals." In April,
 Premier Chiang Ching-kuo told the US ambassador
 that he had issued instructions to reject any
 attempts the releasees make to visit Taiwan. Last
 month, Nationalist Foreign Minister Shen Chang-huan
 said that if any of the amnestied group were allowed
 to enter Taiwan, Peking would claim that it signaled
 the beginning of "contact" between the two parties.
 Shen added that this might lead to rumor and
 speculation that would put Taipei on the defensive--
 which is what Peking obviously has in mind.

 For its part, Peking has continued through its
 media outlets in Hong Kong to decry Taipei's "in-
 sensitivities" to the plight of the "war criminals."
 The pro-Peking press in Hong Kong has also argued
 that Taipei's fear of accepting the releasees re-
 flects the weakness of the Taipei government. For-
 tunately for Taipei, however, the international press
 has not given heavy play to the issue because of its
 preoccupation with recent events in Indochina.
 The June 4 suicide of one of the releasees,
 however, could refocus foreign press attention on
 the situation. News of the suicide received banner
 headlines in many of Hong Kong's major newspapers,
 which attributed the act to despair over the failure
 of the Nationalist government to act on requests to
 visit Taiwan.
 Peking's current campaign for communication with
 Taipei began last February when Liao Cheng-chih sug-
 gested increased "compatriot-to-compatriot" contact
 in a speech commemorating the 1947 Taiwan "uprising."
 Recent Chinese propaganda has also encouraged Taiwan
 residents to visit relatives on the mainland and has
 included rather heavy coverage of Peking's invitation
 to Taiwan residents to participate in China's national
 games this fall in Peking.
 Peking appeared to be following up on this theme
 last month in a broadcast beamed to Taiwan. Although
 the broadcast did not refer directly to the desir-
 ability of communications with the mainland, it
 explicitly linked the collapse of pro-US regimes
 in Indochina with the situation faced by the Taipei
 government, and equated former South Vietnam president
 Nguyen Van Thieu's regime with the Nationalist leader-
 ship. The broadcast called upon officials in Taipei
 to draw the appropriate "lessons" from the South
 Vietnamese example, especially regarding the futility
 of reliance on the US, and to work for the "liberation"
 of Taiwan.

 Peking seems to be telling the Nationalists
 that, despite current US support, their long-term
 prospects are doomed--unless Taipei recognizes the
 inevitability of reunification. Peking is also
 implying that Nationalist leaders can avoid a fate
 similar to that of former president Thieu only by
 agreeing to some sort of accommodation with the
 mainland.

 Final preparations appear to have started for
 the Tenth National Congress of the Communist Youth
 League,   the final step in rebuilding the mass youth
 organization.   The Inner Mongolian League Committee
 recently held an enlarged plenum to greet the con-
 vocation of the National Congress and elect their
 delegates.
 Despite the imminence of the National Congress,
 which would indicate that conditions have stabilized
 and questions regarding the approach to youth work
 have been resolved, recent events indicate that
 the league's role vis-a-vis that of the Red Guards
 still has not been resolved.
 At a recent experience exchange rally in Shang-
 hai,                          the Red Guards were given an equal role with
 the league in the effort to "grasp education of
 young people" under the current dictatorship of the
 proletariat campaign.   Although both the league and
 Red Guards were well represented at the rally,
 greater emphasis was placed on the need to strengthen
 the building and organizational role of the Red Guards.
 Red Guards also re-emerged in a Shanghai middle
 school establishing and leading theoretical study
 groups under the current dictatorship of the prole-
 tariat campaign, a role previously reserved for party
 cadres.   Moreover, an article by the Party Committee
 of the No.  17 Shanghai Cotton Mill, which is asso-
 ciated with Wang Hung-wen, stresses the leading role
 of party and league cadres in leading theoretical
 study groups with no mention of a Red Guard role.
 The Red Guards as an institution have had no
 political power since late 1968.   Those who now be-
 long to the rather shadowy remnant organizations which

 had flourished in 1966-68 are at best the younger
 brothers and sisters of those students who engaged
 in "struggle" at the height of the cultural revolu-
 tion.   Unlike the cadres and workers whose cultural
 revolution associations re-emerged during last year's
 anti-Confucius campaign, these young students have
 little or no partisan memory of the heady days of
 the "revolution."  They are therefore not a politi-
 cal pressure group in the sense that the workers'
 and cadre groups were last year and probably still
 are.
 The Red Guards are, however,  a symbol precisely
 of the cultural revolution itself.   And as a symbol,
 their role--like the historical significance of the
 "revolution"--remains unresolved.   For this reason
 the question of whether or not the Red Guard organ-
 izations are to play a role in youth work is a po-
 litical issue--one of considerable sensitivity.   Al-
 though several other provinces have mentioned the
 Red Guards in connection with preparations for the
 Youth League congress, none has spoken of a specific
 role for the Red Guards.  most provinces have made
 no mention of the Red Guards at all.  This diverse
 treatment suggests that the issue is alive as well
 as sensitive.
 The treatment of the issue in Shanghai may be
 merely an isolated incident, but it highlights the
 problem that even a token role for this symbol of
 the cultural revolution is a question that will
 have to be t      d by the Youth League congress when
 it convenes.

 The current issue of Red Flag carries a strong
 call for the now standard theme of unity and sta-
 bility and links this theme to the proletarian
 dictatorship campaign.   Dubbing the campaign a
 "study movement," the article makes it clear that
 the campaign is not to interfere with the promotion
 of stability or to be used as an excuse for fac-
 tionalism and divisiveness.  Repeating the goal of
 achieving modernization by the end of the century,
 as stated by Chou En-lai at the National People's
 Congress, the article argues that unity and sta-
 bility are needed in order to "gain time" to pursue
 modernization in a variety of fields.  The article's
 repeated use of the phrase "unity and stability"--
 it is mentioned some 26 times--and its call to
 "defend" this notion suggest that Peking remains
 worried about potentially disruptive elements in
 society and that unity and stability have not yet
 become a universally accepted practice.
 A month after raising the controversial issue
 of how to treat college graduates and what kinds
 of jobs to assign them, Liaoning Province announced
 on May 27 that college graduates are expected to
 regard themselves not as an elite group but as
 ordinary workers.  In late April, the provincial
 radio broadcast the texts of two wall posters, one
 of which contended that highly trained college
 graduates would be wasting their education if they
 were assigned to positions as "ordinary" workers,

 an
 the, other insisting that college graduates

 The announcement was conciliatory in its attitude
 toward the writer of the now-discredited poster
 and toward others who supported this view.  Local
 officials were said to have used "patience" and
 "reason" to persuade them to change their minds.
 The writer of the "losing" poster made some valid
 arguments that are generally in line with China's
 current preoccupation with economic progress and
 modernization.   Liaoning's decision to endorse the
 opposing argument, however, suggests that the edu-
 cation issue remains highly contentious.
 The Chinese press has reported in a favorable
 light the results of President Ford's meeting with
 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in Salzburg.   In a
 news release on June 3, NCNA sought to convey the
 impression that the talks were held in a cooperative
 spirit and were productive.  More specifically, it
 gave positive treatment to the announcement that the
 US is prepared to provide Cairo with long-term
 economic aid and to the news that arrangements are
 being made for an exchange of US-Egyptian presiden-
 tial visits.   It also raised the possibility that
 Secretary Kissinger might undertake another round
 of shuttle diplomacy.
 The article mentioned that the US will pro-
 pose its own plan for the settlement of the Middle
 East problem and linked this to President Ford's
 talks with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin in Washington
 this week.  Peking obviously hopes that the US will
 direct most of the pressure for concessions at Tel
 Aviv, a position which Chinese diplomats abroad have
 been voicing since the breakdown of Secretary
 Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy in March.   The Chinese
 believe that unless such pressure is brought to bear,
 the US risks losing the initiative in Middle East
 diplomacy to the Soviet Union.  China has been de-
 cidedly unenthusiastic about a reconvened Geneva
 conference,  fearing that this will give Moscow a
 larger voice in any settlement.                                     25X1
