 Chicago, Illinois
 Convenient Date, September - November 1987
 President of the Mid-America Committee Thomas Miner has invited you to
 address the Mid-America Committee at a breakfast, luncheon or dinner meeting
 on a mutually convenient date in Chicago sometime this fall.  The audience of
 a breakfast or luncheon meeting would include approximately 100 chief executive
 officers representing multinational corporations based in Chicago.  A dinner
 meeting would reach a larger audience of 150 - 200.                    are
 National Securit , Economic and Political Issues AffecSug tingSAmerica'ssCorporate
 Community Abroad, and The Current Role of the CIA.  The suggested format is 20
 minutes o  remarks fol owe   y 10 m nu es o  questions and answers. The
 meetings are usually private and off-the-record, which the Committee prefers;
 however, the speaker has the option to request media coverage and press
 interviews.  Foreign nationals could be present.    11
 The Mid-America Committee for International Business and Government
 Cooperation was formed in 1966 by Thomas Miner to provide a platform for the
 exchange of views on international economic policy.  According to the
 Committee, members have met with over 400 US and foreign government officials
 in the past 20 years.  Previous speakers have included President Reagan,
 Secretary of State George Shultz, President of The People's Republic of China
 Li Xiannian, Italian Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, and former President
 Richard M. Nixon.  Bill Casey spoke to this group at a dinner meetin  in
 1984.  (See opposite for list of corporations and previous speakers.}?
 The Committee's activities include sponsoring high-level trade and
 investment missions to various parts of the world.  In addition, the Committee
 arranges Washington meetings for its members with senior US government
 officials and also organizes seminars on topics of current economic interest.

 I recommend that you accept this invitation and, if your schedule permits,
 we arrange for the dinner meeting.  In your role as Director of Central
 Intelligence, meeting with these industrial and financial leaders with
 contacts overseas could be beneficial to you.  I believe that these are the
 types of individuals that we wish to develop a rapport with for their
 firsthand information of economic situations in areas that are not readily
 accessible to our people.  If you agree, I have attached a letter of
 acceptance to Mr. Miner for your signature.

 The Honorable
 William H. Webster
 Director
 Central Intelligence Agency
 Washington, D.C.  20505
 On behalf of the Mid-America Committee, I would like to
 congratulate you on your appointment as Director of the
 Central Intelligence Agency, and take this opportunity to
 extend a cordial invitation to address our chief executive
 officers at a luncheon or breakfast briefing in Chicago.
 For the past 21 years, the Mid-America Committee has served
 as a major platform in the Chicago area for the exchange of
 views on economic and political issues affecting America's
 corporate community.  Our membership is comprised of the top
 three executives of over 125 multinational corporations and
 financial institutions based in the Midwest.  They are
 extremely interested in hearing your views on the current
 role of the CIA, and its effect on international business
 and trade relations.
 I assure you the Mid-America Committee offers one of the
 most powerful and prestigious platforms of business leaders
 in the Midwest.  Our guests have included President & Mrs.
 Gerald Ford, vice President George Bush, Secretary of State
 George Shultz, Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and The
 Honorable Henry Kissinger.  Other U.S. cabinet officials
 have included Beryl Sprinkel, Caspar Weinberger, John
 Herrington, Clayton Yeutter, Richard Lyng, Malcolm Baldrige,
 William Brock, as well as your predecessor, William Casey.
 For your information, enclosed is background material on the
 Mid-America Committee, which includes a list of the
 dignitaries we have had the privilege of recently hosting,
 as well as our member corporations.

 September, October and November, and would be delighted and most honored to
 include you in our schedule during that time period.
 Once again, please accept our best wishes for every success in your new and
 most challenging position.  We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming
 you to Chicago later this year.

 The Mid-America Committee for International Business and Gov-
 ernment Cooperation, Inc. was formed in 1966 to provide a
 platform for the exchange of views on international economic
 policy, trade and investment between senior U.S. and foreign
 government officials and senior executives of. the largest
 multinational corporations based in the Midwest.
 The Committee was founded by Thomas H. Miner, president of an
 international consulting firm, together with the chief
 executive officers of the major multinational corporations in
 the Midwest (sponsors include the chief executive officers of
 more than one hundred top firms in the region).  Sponsors have
 met with over four hundred U.S. and foreign government
 officials in the past twenty years.  The Committee's guests
 have included President and Mrs. Gerald Ford, H.E. Li Xiannian,
 President of The People's Republic of China, Their Majesties
 The King and Queen of Sweden, Secretary of State George P.
 Shultz, Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani of the Italian
 Republic, and President Richard M. Nixon.
 The Committee's activities include sponsoring high-level
 Trade and Investment Missions to various parts of the world
 (e.g. Middle East, 1974; Cuba, 1977; China, 1976, 1977, 1979,
 1984).  In addition, the Committee arranges Washington meetings
 for its sponsors with senior U.S. government officials and also
 organizes seminars on topics of current economic interest such
 as Trade and Investment in Latin America, Asia, Africa and
 China.
 The Committee has hosted visiting delegations from Africa, the
 Middle East, Latin America, and Japan.  These include foreign
 trade and investment missions and international visitor groups
 under U.S. State Department programs.

 KEYWORD: Nixon
 BODY:
 ... former President Richard Nixon said Tuesday.
 The Nov. 19-20 meeting between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader
 Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva will be a success because of "the very fact they
 got to know each other," Nixon told 530 people attending a $150-a-plate
 fund-raiser for the  Mid-America   Committee,  an international trade
 association.
 Nixon said the summit will produce the possibility of continuing contact,
 reducing the danger of war and paving the way for an arms agreement in the
 future, possibly before Reagan leaves office.
 A nuclear arms agreement will not bring about peace, Nixon warned.
 "What we have to recognize is that if we are to have peace, we have to
 reduce the danger of war itself,'' he said.
 He cited the remarks of Deng Xiaoping, China's Communist Party Central
 Committee  vice chairman, in a recent magazine, ' 'The United States and Soviet
 Union each have enough nuclear capacity to destroy the world 10 times over.
 Suppose we cut the number of weapons by 50 percent. Then, each can destroy the
 world five times over. If

 DATELINE: TOKYO, JULY 29
 BODY:
 JAPANESE BUSINESSES SHOULD TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO "PROMOTE A POSITIVE IMAGE
 OF JAPAN AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES? TO HELP EASE THE CURRENT
 TRADE FRICTION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, A LEADING AMERICAN BUIINESSMEN SAID
 FRIDAY.
 MEETING JAPANESE JOURNALISTS, SCHOLARS AND BUSINESSMEN AT THE JAPAN INSTITUTE
 OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS HERE,  THOMAS  H.  MINER,  CHAIRMAN OF THE
 MID-AMERICA  COMMITTEE, SAID JAPANESE COMPANIES SHOULD ADOPT A STANDARD OF
 ADVERTISEMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN IMPROVE THE IMAGE OF JAPAN IN THE UNITED STATES.
 ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL AREAS BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES IS
 COMMUNICATIONS, HE SAID.
 MINER SAID: "JAPANESE BUSINESS HAS THE RIGHT AND OBLIGATION TO DEFEND ITSELF
 IN THE POLITICAL ARENA IN THE UNITED STATES.  IT MUST CONCENTRATE ON PRESENTING
 ITS SIDE OF THE STORY TO CONGRESS AND THE AMINISTRATION IN THE SAME MANNER AS
 AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN DO."
 "ONE REASON THE DOMESTIC CONTENT BILL (REQUIRING FOREIGN AUTOMAKERS TO USE A
 HIGH PERCENTAGE OF AMERICAN-MADE PARTS FOR THEIR CARS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES)
 SLOWED DOWN IN THE (U.S.) HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND CAME TO A HALT IN THE
 SENATE IN 1982 WAS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE MAJOR JAPANESE AUTO COMPANY
 MOBILIZED ITS AMERICAN DEALERS AND EMPLOYEES AND ASKED THEM TO WRITE TO THEIR
 CONGRESSMEN," MINER SAID.
 "THAT IS A LEGITIMATE EXERCISE OF A DEMOCRATIC RIGHT WHICH JAPANESE COMPANIES
 SHOULD AVAIL THEMSELVES MORE AGRESSIVELY."
 HE ALSO CALLED ON JAPANESE COMPANIES TO MAKE AMERICAN WORKERS AWARE THAT
 THEIR JOB SECURITY OFTEN DEPENDS ON U.S. EXPORTS TO JAPAN. "JAPANESE BUSINESS
 SHOULD HELP FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE AMERICAN EXPORT STAKE IN U.S. TRADE WITH
 JAPAN," HE SAID.
 THE  MID-AMERICA  COMMITTEE, FOUNDED IN 1966, IS A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION
 GROUPING 57 MAJOR AMERICAN CORPORATIONS BASED IN THE MIDWEST OF THE UNITED
 STATES.
 MINER IS CURRENTLY VISITING JAPAN AT THE INVITATION OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.

 HEADLINE: Trade Shows Leaves Unpaid Bills
 DATELINE:  CHICAGO
 KEYWORD: China Exhibit
 BODY:
 Unpaid bills totaling $2.3 million have been left behind by the trade exhibit
 of the People's Republic of China which toured the United States last year,
 banking and convention industry sources say.
 The money is owed to suppliers of goods and services for the show and to five
 banks that lent money for the exhibition. One of the banks, Manufacturers
 Hanovers Trust Co. of New York, is awaiting payment of "well over $1 million," a
 source who asked not to be identified told The Associated Press this week.
 Bank officials could not be reached for comment on the Chinese debt.
 Promoters said the $5.5 million exhibit, which opened in San Francisco in
 September, traveled to  Chicago  in October and closed in New York in December,
 drew more than 8,400 buyers representing American companies. A total of 600,000
 persons visited the show.
 Foreign trade shows in the United States usually lose money, the source said,
 but the exhibits generally are underwritten by the country presenting them.
 But the Chinese did not provide any financial backing for the exhibition.
 "It's very unusual that their government didn't put anything down," the source
 said.
 "Since their government didn't pay anything, and ours didn't pay anything,
 the venture was destined for financial problems," the source added. Essentially,
 he said, the creditors have financed the operation unwillingly.
 International business consultant  Thomas  H.  Miner  acknowledged that loans
 from some banks and debts owed to a number of suppliers have yet to be paid. But
 all suppliers hope they eventually will be paid, said Miner, president of the
 Mid-America  Committee, a consortium of 90 Midwestern companies that helped
 promote and advise the exhibit.
 Gilbert Robinson, head of the China Exhibition Corp., which organized the
 show, confirmed that some debts had not been paid. He told the  Chicago
 Tribune, however, that his accountants still were "closing the books" on the

 exhibit and called talk of a deficit "premature."
 "I am confident that everyone owed money is going to be paid," he said. "The
 show was enormously successful all over the country. The Chinese signed totals
 (orders) in the millions (of dollars) with more than 8,400 buyers."
 He said that if there were a deficit, the Chinese government has told him it
 wants to compensate persons who were not paid.
 In addition to Manufacturers Hanover, banks that advanced money to the China
 Exibition Corp. were the First National Bank of  Chicago,  Crocker National Rank
 and Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco and Midlantic Banks Inc. of New Jersey.
 One San Francisco merchant who asked not to be identified said he has
 contacted about a dozen other suppliers who still are waiting for their money.
 The merchant is owed $70,000 by the China Exhibit Corp. and faces bankruptcy if
 payment is not forthcoming, the Tribune said.
