 The Chinese Economy
 at Mid-1974
 A.  At mid-1974, the Chinese economy is marked by below-average prospects
 in agriculture, moderate expansion in industrial capacity and output, booming
 foreign trade, and palpable improvements in the austere standard of' living.
 B.  The anti-Confucius campaign and the retrenchment in the workpace of
 Premier Chou En-lai thus far have caused no appreciable slowdown in the pace
 of economic activity.
 C.  In agriculture, the erratic spring monsoon and unusually low temperatures
 have hurt early crops and disturbed acreage patterns for the imp'rtant fall-harvested
 crops. Grain production for 1974 seemingly will fall short of the 2% growth trend,
 although future developments in the weather will determine final results for the
 year.
 D.  Purchases of grain will reach a new peak in 1974. Contracts for delivery
 this year now total 9.4 million metric tons - nearly half from the United States --
 compared with 7.5 million tons in 1973.
 E.  Growth in industrial production continues at a respectable 8% to 9%
 rate, with oil and chemical fertilizer among the front runners.
 F.  Production of military hardware in the past 18 months has been 25%
 below the peak levels of 1970-71, possibly the combined result of the priority
 of the agriculture-support program, the changeover to later model weapons, and
 the reassertion of Party control over the military.
 G.  As for foreign trade, soaring world prices and major currency revaluations,
 as well as substantial increases in physical volume, are accounting for sizable gains
 in both exports and imports. Exports probably will rise by 30% in 1974 to more
 than $6 billion, and imports by about 35% to more than $6.5 billion.
 H. From the vantage point of mid-1974, the Chinese have good prospects
 for feeding the growing population at reasonable minimum levels, adding to capacity
 and output in industry, and strengthening military capabilities. These general
 indicators of short-term economic momentum must be weighed against deep-seated
 problems stemming from the low level of per capita output, the massive annual
 increments to population, the struggle to catch up technologically, and recurrent
 ideological flareups.

 Background: Long-Term Forces
 1.   In 1974, the fourth year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese
 economy reflects the experience of a quarter of a century of development under
 Communist rule. Approximate long-term economic growth rates have been as
 follows, calculated on the years 1952 and 1957:
 Average Annual Rates
 of Growth (Percent)
 GNP
 4.8
 4.3
 Population
 2.2
 2.1
 GNP per capita
 2.6
 2.1
 Grain production
 2.3
 1.9
 Industrial output
 9.1
 7.5
 2.         Whereas the long-term rate of growth of GNP has been 4% to 5%, the
 short-term course of GNP has been highly erratic because of two great economic
 and political upheavals - the Great Leap Forward (1958-60) and the Cultural
 Revolution (1966-69). As shown in the first section of the chart, GNP plunged
 in the aftermath of the Leap Forward and dipped, less severely, when the Cultural
 Revolution interrupted industrial production.
 3.  The composition of GNP growth mirrors the fundamental economic
 priorities of the Communist leadership. Once a reasonable minimum amount of
 food has been provided for the growing population, the energies of the economy
 are to go to the expansion of industrial output and capacity. Thus agricultural
 production and population have been advancing over the long run at 2%, while
 industrial production has been growing at 8% to 9%. As shown in the second section
 of the chart, population has moved steadily upward whereas agricultural production
 has fluctuated widely. In particular, in the three disaster years of 1959-61,
 agricultural output dropped by one-fifth through a combination of man-made and
 natural disasters. Beginning in 1961, the PRC has imported several million tons
 of grain annually to supplement domestic production.
 4.   In absolute amount, China's foreign trade is small compared with
 domestic production. China is a huge continental nation with the domestic potential
 for practically all kinds of agricultural and industrial output and with an oft-stated
 aspiration for economic self-sufficiency. Trade is viewed as a temporary vehicle
 for obtaining foreign machinery, technology, and grain. As shown in the third
 section of the chart, China has made a critically important switch in trading partners

 after the Leap Forward. Whereas the PRC conducted two-thirds of its trade with
 other Communist countries in the late 1950s, it now conducts four-fifths of its
 trade with non-Communist countries.
 5.    To summarize, in mid-1974 the status of the Chinese economy has been
 determined largely by the working out of four long-term factors:
 o    GNP growth that provides a substantial margin for building up the
 capacity of the economy;
 o    agricultural growth that, supplemented by imports, has sufficed to
 feed the growing population;
 o    industrial growth that, starting from a small base, has provided rapid
 increases in capacity and output of basic industrial materials,
 machinery, and military equipment; and
 o    expanded foreign trade that now is geared to acquiring advanced
 industrial  equipment  and  grain  from  non-Communist trading
 partners.
 Planning: Uncertainty at the Helm
 6.    The economic planning system, which was partly paralyzed during the
 Cultural Revolution, recovered much of its forcefulness in 1970-72, only to be
 subject to new political buffeting in the past 12 months. During the Cultural
 Revoiution, a large slice of the ranking Party and government leaders lost their
 jobs. Heads of economic ministries and planning agencies dropped from sight, and
 in many cases their posts remained vacant for years. (Indeed, several top economic
 positions apparently still remain without a permanent occupant.) Farther down
 the hierarchy the disruptions of the Cultural Revolution were comparatively mild.
 The day-to-day activities of the economy - the collection and distribution of grain,
 the operation of factories and communes, and the carrying out of financial
 transactions - continued on the basis of institutional roots established over the
 first 17 years of Communist rule.
 7.   After the Cultural Revolution subsided, a certain amount of economic
 policy initiatives became possible at the top.
 e        In the fall of 1970, Premier Chou En-lai announced the Fourth
 Five-Year Plan for 1971-75;
 o        A number of formerly discredited bureaucrats began to reappear;
 and
 o        In 1972-73, agreement was reached within the top leadership on
 important changes in long-term economic strategy, as discussed later.

 8.   In mid-1973, new political ferment began to raise questions regarding
 the balance in the continuing radical-versus-moderate confrontation. Attacks have
 been launched against undue reliance on material incentives, foreign technology,
 and the leadership of rehabilitated bureaucrats. Additional questions about the
 political future came to the fore in early May 1974 when Premier Chou En-lai
 reduced his grueling workpace, ostensibly because of advancing years and growing
 physical ailments. Despite the heightened political rhetoric, the PRC continues to
 push forward the economic policies adopted in 1972-73 and is currently preparing
 for a Fifth Five-Year Plan (1976-80).
 Agriculture: Groundwork for Breakthrough
 9.   The agricultural sector is entering the third great stage of its development
 since the Communists came to power:
 e        In the 1950s, when the Soviets were the economic mentors of the
 PRC, the agricultural sector was left largely dependent on its own
 material resources. Tight control over production and distribution
 of agricultural output, collectivization, and use of rural labor to
 improve the soil and water control facilities were counted upon to
 provide  needed food, raw materials for industry, and export
 products. The strategy became bankrupt in the Leap Forward when
 the leadership established the unwieldly communes, abolished the
 private plots, and wasted vast resources on ill-conceived programs.
 o After having taken emergency measures to bring China back from
 the verge of mass starvation and  political disintegration, the
 leadership in 1962 adopted a new agricultural policy, which provided
 substantial and growing support from the modern industrial sector.
 For more than a decade now, chemical fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation
 equipment, tractors, and improved seeds have been flowing to the
 agricultural sector in growing volume. This support has been
 supplemented by the output of a host of small plants established
 in outlying areas.
 o Then in late 1972, in a third great policy decision, the leadership
 embarked on a long-term agricultural improvement program to free
 China of the necessity of importing grain and chemical fertilizers.
 In the past 18 months, Peking has contracted for 13 large urea plants
 from Japanese, West European,' and US sources at a total cost of
 $500  million.  Output  from  these  plants,  if  expeditiously
 supplemented by improved water control facilities and increased
 supplies of other types of fertilizer, gives the potential for
 substantially higher agricultural production by 1980. Production of
 grain in 1980 could be 30% above the 1973 level and could eliminate
 the need for imports of grain and nitrogen fertilizers.

 10.   In the meantime, Peking must continue to import sizable quantities of
 grain. In 1972, grain imports were prematurely reduced -- to 3.5 million tons from
 the previous 5 million to 6 million tons - in a year when grain output fell 4%
 to a disappointing level of 236 millions tons.1 Thus, in 1973, imports were a record
 7.5 million tons while production recovered to the long-term trend line, at 250
 million tons. Purchases of grain in 1974 will reach a new peak. Contracts for delivery
 this year now total 9.4 million tons, as follows:

 11.   As of mid-1974, the domestic crop seems to be falling in the "below
 average" range, although essentially unpredictable developments in the weather will
 ultimately determine the final results for the year. The 2% trend-line growth --
 a 5 million ton increase over last year's 250 million tons - probably will not be
 realized. Early-harvested grain crops - which normally account for two-fifths of
 China's grain output - have been set back by drought and unseasonable frost in
 the south. One high-level Chinese government official is reported to have said that
 the winter wheat crop this year will turn out to be less than the 1973 crop. The
 late and erratic behavior of the monsoons this spring, together with unusually low
 temperatures, has disturbed acreage patterns for the important fall-harvested crops.
 For example, in double-cropped rice areas where seed for the early rice crop did
 not germinate and had to be replanted, the planned sLcond rice crop might have
 been replaced with a lower yielding dry crop in many instances.
 12.   Other fa,c-tors in agriculture are favorable or at least neutral. Once again,
 the volume of chemical fertilizer and machinery going into the agricultural sector
 will establish a new record. Improvements in flood control and irrigation facilities
 continue at a vigorous pace. These improvements still yield considerable returns
 in output in some areas because most water control projects are only partly finished,
 and major rivers and large tributaries remain to be harnessed. At the same time
 that new acreage is being reclaimed from the hillsides, the desert, and even the
 sea, farmland is being taken for factories, urban housing, and military installations.
 We have no data to determine the extent to which these forces are offsetting.

 In any case, the net change in total acreage is small. As for seeds, China is gradually
 taking advantage of the opportunities for combining improved seed,; with advances
 in fertilization and water control.
 13.  The availability of manpower is another plus factor. Numbers are no
 problem, of course; indeed, average output would markedly rise if China had a
 more favorable labor/land ratio. The issues have been the level of skill, the
 disruption among various rural tasks, and motivation:
 o Agriculture in mid-1974 is benefiting from the broadening of
 education and training in r.+ral areas, the increased experience of
 the work force with fertilizers and mac; finery, the assignment to
 the countryside of thousands of educated people from urban areas,
 and programs for the systematic introduction of new seed varieties
 and production techniques.
 o   The leadership in mid-1974 is taking a moderate and reasonable
 approach toward the distribution of rural labor. The small plants
 program can absorb no more than 5% of the labor force of any
 county. The smaller rural units -- the production brigade and the
 production team -- apparently have leeway within this guideline to
 allocate man-power on the basis of local conditions.
 o Significant changes in motivatiun in rural areas in mid-1974 are hard
 to identify. Motivation probably should be set down as a neutral
 factor. Rural living standards continue to edge up. Health care and
 educational standards are rising markedly if unevenly. The political
 rumblings of the past 12 months have not taken a great dial of
 extra time from work or leisure in the countryside. Of paramount
 importance, the political wrangling has not, so far as we can tell,
 had any effect on the pragmatic attitude toward the private plots
 and petty private trade. The most serious cases of disaffection
 continue to be among youth, notably the city youth transferred
 to the countryside for rural labor.
 Industry: Swing Toward Support of Agriculture
 14.   Growth of industrial output in China continues at approximately the
 long-term rate of 8%-9%, with oil and chemical fertilizer among the front runners.
 This rate, although not so high as in the catch-up years following the Cultural
 Revolution, is entirely respectable and represents a doubling of output every decade.
 The shift in economic strategy of the past two years - in which the grou',tdwork
 for a long-term breakthrough in agriculture is being laid - has i;nportant
 implications for the course of industrial development.
 o   Much of the tremendous increase in the contracts for Western
 industrial plants - $1.2 billion in contracts in 1973, compared with

 only $60 million in 1972, with another billion plus year anticipated
 in 1974 - is not designed to increase the machine building capacity
 of the PRC but rather to expand severalfold the capacity to produce
 chemical fertilizer and artificial fibers.
 e         Tae pressures in mid-1974 on supplies of coal and electric power
 are the result of the failure to open large new coal mines in recent
 years. The attempt to raise production from existing mines by more
 intensive application of labor has increasingly run into diminishing
 returns. The skimping on investment in new capacity implicitly is
 tied to the priority of investment in industrial branches that directly
 support agriculture.
 o Military production in the first half of 1974 has continued at about
 the same level as 1972-73 - about 25% below the peak of 1970-71.
 Although the explanation for curtailed military production is not
 clear, it probably stems from a combination of: the priority accorded
 the "agriculture first" policy, the cutting back of production of
 obsolescent aircraft models while new models are being readied, and
 the relative eclipse since 1971 of the political strength of the
 military.
 15.   A striking feature of the industrial scene in mid-1974 is the small plants
 program. As used in this memorandum, the term small plants refers to Chinese
 enterprises distinguished by (a) simple technology, (b) location in rural areas, (c)
 production in d?rect or indirect support of agriculture, (d) dependence on local
 resources, and (e) local (usually sub-provincial) administration. The program - as
 the following table indicates - is broadening the base of important industrial
 branches. The cost in resources is small compared with the benefits. The program
 makes maximum use of local labor, materials, and transport, whose contribution
 in other uses generally would be much less valuable. Difficulties with the program
 in the past have come mainly from overzealous implementation during periods of
 political upheaval - e.g., the Leap Forward. The current anti-Confucius campaign
 so far has not resulted in any hurried expansion of the program.
 16.   Another striking feature of the industrial scene is the great percentage
 increase in oil output from its small beginnings ir, the 1950s and early 1960s.
 Production of crude oil has advanced as follows:

 China: Contribution of Small Pants
 to Industrial Output, Mid- 1974
 Agricultural machinery          Almost all the simple farm tools and a substantial portion
 of basic farm machinery.
 Chemical fertilizers            Mori' than S0% of nitrogen fertilizer output (by weight) and
 75% of phosphate fertilizer output (by weight); vital to the
 agricultural sector, even if not top quality.
 Cement                          50% of national output; sufficient in quantity and quality for
 practically all local needs!
 Hydroelectric power             About 5% of national elects c power capacity and a large part
 of rural needs, especially fo irrigation.
 CeJal                           30% of national output; use(l' 10stly for local industry,
 cooking, and heating.
 Iron and steel                  20%.3nd 15%, respectively, of national output; used in rural
 industry and construction.
 17.   Beginning in 1973, when I million tons (20,000 b/d) were exported to
 Japan, oil has become a major earner of hard currency. Shipments to Japan --
 a nearby and insatiable market - will reach 4 million tons (80,000 b/d) in 1974.
 Earnings from oil, only $35 million in 1973, probably will exceed $30G million
 in 1974 and will cont,:-ue to mount through the remainder of the decade - to
 as much as $3 billion by 1980. The boom in oil production and exports can be
 viewed as suppc? '.ve of the "agriculture first" strategy because oil earnings will
 help to pay for the new chemical fertilizer and artificial fiber plants.
 18.   In the steel industry, recent increases in output have not been sufficient
 to satisfy growing domestic requirements. Imports of finished steel may rise to
 4 million tons in 1974, and s`zable increases in imports of iron ore, pig iron, and
 steel scrap continue. After several years of tough negotiations, China recently signed
 contracts with Ja-nnese and West German consortiums for a $430 million sheet
 steel rolling and finishing mill to be built at Wu-han. The new facility, when
 commissioned in 1977, will boost annual production of finished steel by more
 than 3 million tons, still short of China's needs.
 Foreign Trade: Off the Chart
 19.   Foreign trade in 1973 soar, ,J to more than $9 billion, an increase in
 dollar vale of some 60% over 1972. Revaluations of world currencies and
 worldwide inflation contributed heavily to the jump in the dollar figure; the gain
 in real terms was 20% to 25%. Scattered returns for the first quarter of '1974

 show that another jump, of 30% to 40%, is likely again this year, and again more

 20.  Other trends in China's foreign trade as seen at mid-1974 are2:
 ?    Imports o~ grain, sugar, cotton, vegetable oils, and other agricultural
 products `iould increase from a record $1.3 billion in 1973 to $2
 billion in 1974, roughly half coming from the United States.
 o    Orders for industrial plants and other machinery and equipment
 from non-Communist suppliers - which totaled almost $2.5 billion
 in 1973 - continue strong in 1974 despite the growing internal
 debate over the reliance on foreign sources.
 ?    The relaxation of Peking's conservative attitude toward debt carries
 over in 1974, with the trade deficit with non-Communist nations
 expected to reach $1 billion (compared with $425 million in 1973).
 ?    Japan will remain the leading trading partner, with two-way trade
 approaching $3 billion ($2 billion in 1973). Exports to Japan will
 cover all but a small proportion of imports.
 ?    Trade with the United States will likely total $1.2 billion ($870
 million in  1973); China's trade deficit p,obably will exceed
 $1 billion.
 Net hard curiency earnings from Hong Kong of $1.5 billion will
 provide the major offset to China's deficit with the developed West.
 ?    Trade with the other Communist countries will consist largely of
 (a) the exchange of Chinese foodstuffs, textiles, and other consumer
 goods for Soviet and East European industrial equipment and (b)
 Chinese aid deliveries to North Vietnam, Albania, and North Korea.

 Transportation: Squeezing in More Traffic
 21.   At ntid-1974, the key transportation system for the modern portion of
 the economy remains the rail network, supplemented by waterways for the
 movement of bulk commodities. The rise in oil production is bringing the
 construction of pipelines and port facilities to center stage. Rural areas continue
 to make do with age-old water and road transport; some rural areas, however,
 are being suddenly transformed by the extension of rail routes into hither'o isolated
 regions.
 22.   In the past three years, the Chinese rail network has grown by 10%,
 to approximately twice the size of the pre-Communist network. Progress has
 included (a) the double-tacking of important segments of line in the populous
 East; (b) the completion of several trunklines; (c) fast-paced work on new segments
 now being pushed into the hinterland; (d) additional electrification of trackage,
 mainly in the mountainous areas of Szechwan and Shensi; and (e) construction
 of industrial spurs, new expanded rail yards and transfer facilities, and additional
 repair facilities.
 23.   For the past 18 months, growth in freight traffic has exceeded the growth
 in rail  transport capacity.  railroad  authorities  are  now contending with
 widespread - but not crippling - shortages of freight cars, especially tank cars.
 24.   So far in 1974, Chinese ports have been able to handle increasing
 shipments from Free World countries with only a relatively small amount of
 congestion. Some sources have reported numerous ships waiting for berths at
 Chinese harbors, but few ships have been reported waiting for long periods of
 time. Meanwhile, the Chinese have continued to improve their ports and harbors
 by dredging, construction of new facilities, purchases of additional materials
 handling equipment, and improved cargo loading and unloading procedures.
 Consumer: Making It Gradually
 25.   The rank-and-file consumer so far in the Fourth Five-Year Plan has been
 benefitting from a series of small improvements in his austere living standards. The
 quality, variety, and availability of foods continue the slow but perceptible long-run
 rise. Although rationing of cotton cloth persists, clothing standards are generally
 perking up. Synthetic fabrics are becoming more widely available, for example,
 and adult garb is gradually departing from monotonic blue or gray. Housing also
 shows improvement, especially in rural areas; members of successful communes
 are moving up in large numbers to brick and stone houses through the use of
 local materials and their own labor. The pace of improvement is probably most
 noticeable in the ownership of consumer durables - bicycles especially, and
 watches, transistor radios, cameras, and sewing machines. Rudimentary health
 services are being extended to back areas through "barefoot doctors" (young
 medical corpsmen). The number of small freedoms of choice  is  gradually

 expanding, although the basic pattern of consumption continues to be closely
 regulated by a host of government and quasi-government bodies.
 Population: No Surcease
 26.   Data oil China's population and on the current population control
 program remain so fragmentary that precise numerical estimates are impossible.
 The figure of 920 million people, used in this memorandum for mid-I974, implies
 ,in annual average growth of 2.2"x, since 1952. To illustrate the wide range of
 uncertainty in population figures, Vice-Premier Li 1-Isien-nicn's oft-quoted statement
 made in 1971 to a Cairo journalist is worth repeating:
 ... We have been racing against time to cope with the enonuous increase
 in population. Some people estimate the population at 800 million and
 some at 750 million. Unfortunately, there are no accurate statistics in
 this connection. Nevertheless, the officials at the supply and grain
 department are saying confidently, "The number is 800 million people."
 Officials outside the grain department say the population is "750 million
 only" while the Ministry of Commerce affirms that the "number is 830
 million." However, the planning department insists that the number is
 "less than 750 million." The Ministry of Commerce insists on the bigger
 number in order to be able' to provide goods in large quantities. The
 planning men reduce the figure in order to strike a balance in the plans
 of the various state departments.
 27.   Strong factors favoring high fertility are at work in present-day China:
 improved nutrition; continued gains in public health, now aided and abetted by
 the legions of barefoot doctors; the large number of ivu:Yrca already in or entering
 the younger child-bearing ages, a result of the baby boom, of the 1950s and 1960s;
 the settled societal conditions of the Fourth Five-Year Plan period in comparison
 with, say, the Cultural Revolution and 'traditional attitudes favoring large families,
 which the immensely improved Ion: of children in contemporary China presumably
 has strengthened. The present population control program, the most determined
 effort to date to cut back the rate of growth, has been in effect only since the
 Cultural Revolution and has only begun to penetrate rural areas. We doubt that
 it has had appreciable effects on demographic rates. At the same time, we feel
 that the combination of a strong government program and a changed popular
 attitude toward large families could lead to marked demographic changes by the
 end of a decade. The account by Djerassi3 of the amazing progress made by the
 PRC in developing and distributing oral contraceptives suggests a considerable
 potential for central planning of population within the not-too-distant future. In
 similar vein, the accounts by author Han Suyin of the impact of "baby quotas"
 for low-level social units, while exaggerated, illuminate the possible future course
 of China's population contrcl program.

 28. 13ecause of the short lifespan of past population control efforts in the
 PRC, the chances for survival of the current program should be viewed cautiously.
 The anti?Conlucius spearhead could still be directed against the program or a radical
 post-Mao administration could find the program a ready target.
 Prospects: Odds on the Technocrats
 29. The immediate future for the economy will be largely determined by
 the conditions under which Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier Chou En-Iai
 disappear from the scene.4 Various issues are involved:
 o   radical versus moderate economic policy;
 ?   civilian versus military use of resources;
 o   industry-first versus agriculture-first economic strategy;
 o   autarkic versus interdependent foreign economic policy; and
 ?   centralized versus local control of production.
 30. Some of the revolutionary impetus that presently shapes Chinese policies
 will inevitably be lost when the initial generation of Communist leaders is replaced.
 Most of the people in China today have a vested interest in working to improve
 their lot within existing institutions under existing rules of the, game. Thus, while
 radical departures in policy or militar; juntas are possible, on balance the future
 probably belongs to the government bureaucrats, the technicians, the Party
 bureaucrats, and the professional military men -- i.e., the technocrats. This kind
 of succession fits in with China's economic problems of achieving the breakthrough
 in agriculture, moving ahead to petrochemicals and offshore oil, manufacturing and
 deploying sizable numbers of nuclear-armed missiles, and curbing the growth of
 population. Nonetheless, the past history of unexpected political upheavals in the
 People's Republic of China serves as a warning against basing predictions on
 straight-line assessments of economic rationality. Perhaps, a reasonably solid
 minimum argument may be made - i.e., that economic institutions and vested
 interests are now so deeply rooted as to serve as a great counterweight to radical
 forces in the post-Mao era.
 31.   For the more distant future, the underlying problems of low per capita
 output, population pressure, and technological lag will keep China from greatly
 accelerating the present moderate pace of growth. Over the next decade, China
 will further outdistance the other large LDCs such as India, Pakistan, and Indonesia,
 yet wit.: be hard put to gain ground on Japan and Western Europe. China will
 still be a big poor nation with the potential and ambition for - but not the
 realization of - economic superpower status.
