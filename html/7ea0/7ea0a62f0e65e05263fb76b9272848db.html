 KISSINGER  IN  PRC
 "FRIENDLY" MEETING WITH MAO HIGHLIGHTS PEKING VISIT
 Peking treatment of Secretary Kissinger during his visit to the PRC,
 begun on 19 October, has been highlighted by a "friendly" meeting
 with Mao Tse-tung on the 21st.  Prior to the meeting with Mao, the
 Kissinger party's visit had ocr.asioned correct Chinese protocol
 treatment, though Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua's remarks at the
 usual welcoming banquet contained some less than cordial overtones.
 The secretary, as in the past, was welcomed at the airport by a
 Chinese delegation led by Chiao Kuan-hua, and Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping attended the welcoming banquet on 19 October.   NCNA
 reported that Teng and Chiao held talks with Kissinger on the 20th
 rind 21st.  The NCNA report of the meeting with Mao duplicated the
 agency's report of Kissinger's last session with Mao on 12 November
 1973 in noting the "friendly" atmosphere and pointing out that the
 chairman asked Kissinger "to convey his regards" to the U.S.
 President.  Kissinger had not been received by Mao during his most
 recent China visit in November 1974.  Kissinger thus far has not
 met with the ailing Premier Chou En-lai, who has made no public
 appearances in recent weeks.
 Chiao Kuan-hua's toast at the welcoming banquet, as transmitted by
 NCNA, departed from past practice in omitting introductory words of
 welcome for the secretary.  Chiao instead launched into a standard
 Chinese warning--not seen before during a Kissinger visit--that
 detente was an "illusion" that should not blind the world to hegemonism-?-
 a code word for Soviet expansionism.
 Chiao's toast was similar to Chinese welcoming remarks in the past
 when it observed that "on the whole, Sino-U.S. relations have moved
 forward in the last few years," and that. while there are bilateral
 differences, the two sides "have common points as well."  Chiao
 recalled that "a new page" was turned in relations between the two
 countries with President Nixon's 1972 visit to China and the issuance
 of the Shanghai communique.  But Chiao made no mention at all of
 President Ford, although in a similar toast during Kissinger's visit
 last November, the Chinese foreign minister had noted "with
 appreciation" President Ford's commitment to the principles outlined
 in the Shanghai communique.*
 *  Kissinger and other U.S. officials have said that preparations for
 President Ford's visit to China next month were the prime reason for the
 secretary's current visit.  However, Chinese media have not in recent
 months independently mentioned a visit by the President, a visit which
 had been agreed on for 1975, according to the communique on Kissinger's
 Peking trip last November.

 Chiao also showed a degree of concern regarding U.S. adherence to
 the principles of the Shanghai communique.   Last November he had
 expressed confidence that Kissinger's visit would "contribute to
 the further Implementation" of the principles, But now stressing
 China's sincerity, he said that relations would improve if "our
 two sides" observed the principles in practice.  Chiao's remarks
 came a week after Peking had accused the United States--in a
 1  October statement by a spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry's
 information department---of violating the Shanghai communique
 "principles" by refusing to stop activities by nationalist
 Tibetan groups in the United States.
 NCNA as usual reported Secretary Kissinger's reply toast, though it
 did not refer to his speaking a Chinese sentence in the toast, as
 reported by the Western press.
 MOSCOW NOTES SECRETARY'S VISIT, PRC ATTACKS ON DETENTE
 As with Kissinger's past Peking visits, Soviet media have covered
 the current trip discreetly, primarily through brief pickups of
 Western reports.  Moscow's Mandarin broadcasts to China on the 18th
 and the 20th noted that the main topics of the talks would be
 President Ford's planned November visit to Peking and the alleged
 Chinese concern that the United States maintain its military
 presence in Asia. A TASS account of Kissinger's meeting with Mao
 on 21. October, based on Western sources, noted Mao's reported
 criticism of the Soviet Union as an "aggressive power" and Peking's
 use of the visit for "public attacks on detente."
 During the secretary's past visits to Peking, Moscow has often
 highlighted evidence of a cozy Sino-U.S. relationship.  Thus,
 during his November 1973 visit, the Moscow domestic radio noted a
 REUTER report that Chairman Mao had received no other foreign
 statesman as often as he had Kissinger.  In contrast, some strains
 were indicated currently when the 22 October TASS report on
 meetings with Mao and Teng Hsiao-ping cited "officials in Henry
 Kissinger's party" as saying that "the Chinese side shows no
 understanding of the significance of the final act which was signed
 in Helsinki."  At the same time, a 21 October PRAVDA article,
 available only in a TASS summary, asserted that China was using
 Secretary Kissinger's visit for "a new wave of anti-Sovietism and
 attacks on the policy of detente."
 Recent Soviet comment has described a certain stagnation in the process
 of. normalizing Sino-U.S. relations and has seemed to reflect a
 greater confidence in Moscow that there are inherent limits upon
 Sino-U.S. cooperation that would minimize its potential harm to

 Sc''iet interests.  The 17 September LITERARY GAZETTE observed that
 "the voices of realistic observers" were being heard increasingly
 often in Western discussions of China, after an initial period of
 discovery when life there was portrayed in "idyllic tones."
 IZVESTIYA observer Aleksandr Bovin had assured Moscow TV viewers
 last July that "realistic" politicians in the West understood that
 China's ability to upset Soviet detente policy was "fairly limited."
 DRV REPORTS ARRIVAL IN PRC, CRITICIZES U.S. POLICY IN ASIA
 Following the pattern established during Secretary Kissinger's last
 two trips to the PRC, North Vietnamese media acknowledged his
 arrival in Peking in a brief Vietnamese-language radio report on
 20 October which noted that he would be in China for four days.
 An earlier Hanoi radio broadcast in English on the 18th had taken
 note of the secretary's "Asian tour" without mentioning his
 scheduled China visit.   Explaining that Kissinger was reviewing U.S.
 policies in the area, the broadcast had warned that despite the
 phasing out of SEATO, U.S. "scheming" was continuing and Washington
 still hoped to maintain military bases in Thailand and was sending
 weapons to South Korea and tightening its alliance with Japan.
 DRV media were first noted to have acknowledged a Kissinger visit to
 China in November 1973, when Hanoi radio similarly reported his
 Peking arrival and, after he left, cited his talks with Chinese
 officials and reception by Chairman Mao.*  The secretary's subsequent
 trip to China in November 1974 prompted less-detailed acknowledgment
 in Hanoi media.  Prior to November 1973 the Hanoi media had maintained
 a disapproving silence on Kissinger's Peking contacts as well as
 President Nixon's 1972 trip to China, and had indirectly criticized
 the Sino-U.S. rapprochement in polemical comment warning against
 U.S. duplicity.
 *  Kissinger's November 1973 trip to Peking is discussed in the TRENDS
 of 21 November 1973, page 23.

 INTERNATIONAL  COMMUNISM
 PRAVDA RECALLS 1905 GENERAL STRIKE, SAYS TACTIC VALID TODAY
 An endorsement of mass political strikes as an appropriate form
 of class struggle for communist parties in the West is the
 apparent message of an article b?T N. Cherepenin in the 19 October
 issue of PRAVDA.* Keyed to the observance of the 70th anniversary
 of the general strike in Russia in 1905, the article averred in
 its concluding paragraphs that the use of strikes for political
 purposes has become "one of the proven means of working class
 struggle."  This implied recommendation of militant tactics to
 Western communist parties recalls the 6 August Zarodov article in
 PRAVDA which also challenged the validity of moderate tactics,
 presumably with reference to varied reactions among West European
 communist parties to the Portuguese situation.  Although the present
 article contains no clear references to such current situations,
 it seems intended to lend support to a generally aggressive
 approach to the selection of tactics for communist party activities
 in the West.
 The clearest indication of this militant tendency came in the
 concluding passages of the article, where the author offered some
 general observations on the relevance of the 1905 experience to
 the present day.  After asserting that "Marxist-Leninist parties"
 are now supporting mass strike movements in various capitalist
 countries, the author quoted Brezhnev as having urged communist
 p;1rties to "be prepared for any changes in the situation and to
 use any forms of struggle."  The quote is taken from Brezhnev's
 address on L:~nin's centennial which was celebrated on 21 April
 1970,  It is particularly  appropriate as supporting documentation
 for the current article, since Brezhnev's argument in the relevant
 passage of his centennial address was that communists should not
 be satisfied with limited "democratic" goals but should push for
 full-scale "socialist" revolutions.  An argument that the "democratic"
 and "socialist" stages of the "anti-monopolist struggle" could be
 merged was one of the key theses advanced by Zarodov.
 Another indication that the article represents the more militant
 approach to communist tactics is the fact that it contains several
 critical references to moderate political forces which were also
 targets of Zarodov's denigrations.  The author remarked, for example,
 *  No biographic information is available on Cherepenin and he is
 not known to have written for publication previously.

 after noting the success of the strike movement in Russia,  that
 it was rejected by the "opportunist leaders of Western Social
 Democracy."  M.Pewhere, he pointed out that Lenin's development of
 the strike tactic had been carried out against the opposition
 of the "opportunists, who strove at all times to confine the
 struggle to economic tasks."
 These apparently polemical aspects of the article are thrown into
 sharper relief by the blandness of the complementary article on
 the 1905 general strike carried in IZVESTIYA on 18 October.  Written
 by candidate of historical sciences V. Kirillov, the article was
 entirely devoted to an inspirational account of the 1905 events
 with no didactic conclusions drawn regarding current communist
 tactics.
 A review of past issues of PRAVDA covering, the period around the
 60th anniversary of the general strike it, 1965--the current
 calendar lists 20 October as the anniversary of the event--turned
 up no commemorative articles.

 WORLD  ECONOMY
 MOSCOW WARY OF WEST ?S APPROACH TO PARIS ECONOMIC TALKS
 Moscow has treated circumspectly the agreement between Western
 industrial and developing countries, reached at a 13-15 October
 meeting in Paris, to hold a 27-nation ministerial-level Confer-
 ence on International Economic Cooperation.   Consistent with
 previous comment, Soviet media noted approvingly that the
 conference, scheduled to begin in Paris on 1.6 December, will deal.
 not only with the question of oil supplies and prices, as
 originally proposed by the West, but also with other raw materials
 and problems of development, as demanded by the Third World
 countries.  At the same time, comment has voiced skepticism that
 the West will be forthcoming in responding to the developing
 countries' needs.
 WESTERN CONCESSION     Typifying Moscow's traditional support
 for the oil-producing and other developing
 countries vis-a-vis the West, an. Arabic-language commentary on
 the 18th asserted that the agreement to hold the conference along
 the lines proposed by the developing countries proved the "fair-
 ness" of their demand that a dialog with the West must include
 a comprehensive disussion of trade and economic relations.
 Similarly, TASS economics commentator Boris Rachkov on the 14th
 stressed that the previous preparatory meeting in Paris last April
 had failed because the West "egotistically" sought to limit the
 conference to solving its own energy problems while ignoring the
 needs of most of the Third World countries.*  Both commentaries
 portrayed the West's willingness to accept an expanded conference
 agenda as a reluctant concession in the face of firm Third World
 resoluteness, as characterized by the oil producers' latest
 decision to hike prices by 10 percent.   The Arabic-language radio
 commentary, for example, asserted that it took the West six months
 to yield to the developing countries'iust demand after all
 Western attempts at "pressure, intimidation and coercion" had
 failed.
 Moscow comment, however, has voiced doubt that the West's will-
 ingness to accept an expanded conference agenda means tha': it has

 abandoned its uncooperative stance relating to the developing
 countries.  Yuriy Kharlanov's "International Review" in the
 19 October PRAVDA, for example, acknowledged that U.S. repre-
 sentatives at the preparatory meeting had "softened their tone
 somewhat and adopted, at least verbally, more conciliatory positions"
 but added:  "Nonetheless, American circles linked with the Xnter-
 national monopolies are continuing their demands for table-thumping."
 Similarly, Rachkov, after referring to the recent OPEC oil price
 increase, asserted that a "certain 'softening"' of the West's
 position "does not mean that imperialism is not seeking revenge."
 COMMISSION FORMAT     Underscoring the contention that the West will
 attempt to avoid responding to Third World
 needs, Kharlanov pointed to Western unwillingness to accept a
 proposal of the developing countries that the December conference
 be held in several stages to deal consecutively with the problems
 of energy, raw materials, industrial development and financial
 problems.  According to current guidelines, each of these subjects
 is to be discussed by an individual commission--a format originally
 suggested by Secretary Kissinger last May.   Several commentaries
 have suggested that the commission format is designed to enable
 the West to sidestep those issues of greatest concern to the Third
 World.  TASS correspondent Yevgeniy Korzhev on the 13th, for example,
 asserted that Western "maneuvering" would become evident when the
 two sides attempt to define the specific tasks of the commissions.
 More specifically, IZVESTIYA's V. Borisov on th  15th contended
 that the West hoped to avoid discussing the subject of raw materials
 by relegating it to one of the commissions.
 SOVIET ROLE      Although Moscow comment has uniformly refrained
 from discussing direct Soviet interest in the
 continuing dialog between the West and the developing countries,
 a D. Volskiy article in the 3 October Russian-language edition of
 NEW TIMES acknowledged Western comment ca the issue.   It dismissed
 as "feebleminded anti-Sovietism" the assertion of an article in
 the British daily GUARDIAN that a successful conference would put
 Moscow in an "awkward position."  Volskiy countered that "progressive
 people could only welcome it, if the capitalist West were actually
 to elaborate a constructive approach"--a contingency which he described
 as a "long way off."  As a possible counter to Western initiatives,
 however, the Soviet front organization World Peace Council, according
 to a brief 10 September TASS report released at the conclusion of
 the UNGA special session on economic cooperation, announced plans
 for a "world conference on the problems-of developing countries"
 in October 1976.

 USSR-EGYPT
 MOSCOW CITES SADAT ON U.S. TIES, ARMS "ESCALATION" TO ISRAEL
 Soviet media thus far have avoided direct comment on President
 as-Sadat's forthcoming official visit to the United States but
 have conveyed Moscow's displeasure with as-Sadat's foreign and
 domestic policies.   Implying Egyptian gullibility, Moscow has
 stressed the incongruity of Egypt's efforts to seek closer ties
 with the United States at a time when the traditional U.S. protective
 commitment to Israel has been strengthened.
 This message has been implicit for weeks in Moscow's continued
 attention to the "secret" U.S. assurances to Israel on defense,
 energy and economic requirements, including Israel's request
 for advanced weapons, set forth in conjunction with the Sinai II
 accord.   To underline the point, TASS and Moscow's "unofficial"
 Radio Peace and Progress highlighted passages from as-Sadat's
 18 October speech in which he referred to the issue of further
 U.S. military aid for Israel.   TASS' account marked the first
 time in months that Moscow had accorded remarks by as-Sadat any
 more than brief, passing attention.*  The TASS dispatch on the
 19th quoted as-Sadat as expressing "concern and protest against
 any escalation of American military deliveries to Israel and,
 particularly, the delivery of new types of weapons" and cited his
 warning that Egypt would meet "escalation on one side by an
 escalation on our side."
 The TASS account also associated as*-Sadat directly with policies
 that have caused persistent discord in Soviet-Egyptian relations.
 TASS cited as-Sadat's reference to Egypt's pursuit of "balanced
 relations of friendship" with both the United States and the USSR,
 "without distinguishing between them because of the fact that one
 of them has a socialist regime and the other a capitalist one."
 Similarly, TASS reported as-Sadat's reaffirmation of Egypt's
 economic "open?-door policy" for all countries, with its consequent
 rejection of "imported socialism" and development of "Egyptian Arab
 socialism."
 Since the beginning of this year Moscow has taken note of perhaps
 no more than half a dozen of as-Sadat's many speeches and interviews.
 Most recently, two-paragraph TASS reports disposed of a Lebanese press
 interview in June and his 23 July anniversary speech, and PRAVDA late
 in July made a passing reference to his Khartoum press conference.

 TASS 'gnored as-Sadat's remarks on the Sinai II accord, in which he
 reaffirmed that Egypt remained committed to the retrieval of all
 Arab lands occupied by Israel and to the restoration of Palestinian
 rights, adding that Egypt also believed in recovering whatever land
 was possible at a given historical moment:   "Every reasonable person
 knows that complete liberation will not be achieved all at once.
 Nor did TASS mention his reference to U.S,, assurances to him that
 it would work for a further disengagement accord between Syria and
 Israel and for recognition of Palestinian rights.
 Moscow has been negative in its. limited references to prospects for
 Syrian-Israeli disengagement talks.  Reporting a 21 October shooting
 episode between Israeli and Syrian patrols on the Golan Heights,
 for example, TASS cited Syrian newspapers on Israel's alleged buildup
 of tension in the area "as an attempt by Israel and the United States
 to pressure Syria to make concessions within the framework of a
 partial settlement."  On a more general level, Moscow has clearly
 expressed its disapproval of Syrian-Israeli talks through its
 continued criticism of "partial accords" and advocacy of an overall
 political settlement at a reconvened Geneva conference.
 VISIT TO U.S.         Moscow presumably seeks to minimize the potential
 importance of as-Sadat's upcoming visit to the
 United States.  TASS first took notice of the visit in a one-sentence
 dispatch from Washington on 10 October citing a White House announcement
 that the visit would begin on 26 October.  The only other available
 mention of the visit came in a 14 October PRAVDA report on Secretary
 Kissinger's remarks on U.S. military aid for Egypt, made- two days
 earlier on U.S. television.  PRAVDA cited the Secretary as saying
 that the subject of U.S. military aid to Egypt would be dis.ussed
 during as-Sadat's visit, but only on a general level, and that the
 United States would not give "specific pledges" or discuss a
 "specific list of purchases."  Moscow has otherwise ignored U.S.
 and Arab media speculation on what as-Sadat seeks to accomplish
 during the visit.
 As-Sadat himself--according to the Kuwaiti foreign minister, a;;
 reported in the 19 October issue of Kuwait's  AL-WATAN--said that
 he wculd press the United States for another disengagement on the
 Syrian front and for acceptance of the Palestine Liberation
 Organization (PLO) at any conference on a Mideast settlement.
 As-Sadat also indicated he would discuss the matter of U.S. arms
 for Israel with President Ford and the Palestinian issue with
 the U.S. Congress and public.  Cairo's MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY
 (MENA) on the 17th had earli.:r cited as-Sadat as having told a
 visiting U.S. Congressman that he would request the sale to Egypt
 of U.S. defensive weapons, "including planes, electronic equipment,
 and anti-aircraft missiles."

 U.S. ARMS     Soviet media over the past weeks have continued to
 TO ISRAEL     report and comment on the issue of further U.S. armv
 for Israel.  Much of the Soviet attention has been
 reactive to U.S. media publicity and to U.S. Congressional hearings
 on the accord's provision that U.S. technicians be sent to the
 Sinai.  Moscow had, as in the past, replayed remarks by U.S.
 politicians and media sources critical of a projected deeper U.S.
 involvement in the Middle East and of Israel's requests for
 highly advanced U.S. weapons, such as the F-16 aircraft and the
 Pershing and Lance missiles.  Remarks on Moscow radio's 19 October
 roundtable were typical, recalling the "secret" U.S.-Israeli under-
 standings--first published in U.S. newspapers on 16-17 September--on
 U.S. responsiveness  to Israel's defense needs and stressing that
 these iacreased U.S.  commitments to Israel, added to the issue of
 sending U.S. technicians to the Sinai, were of increasing concern to
 Americans as well as Arabs and could exert potentially harmful
 effects on efforts to achieve a comprehensive Mideast settlement.
 One commentator on the program, reviving a point made on 2 September
 by TASS Deputy General Director S. Losev, suggested that the issue
 of U.S. arms to Israel could be viewed in the context of the
 incompatibility of a country's simultaneously pursuing detente a,.,'
 "fanning the arms race."
 A major point Moscow has been trying to convey in its continued
 comment on U.S. military aid to Israel is that Egypt's agreement
 to the Sinai II accor-i has helped Israel militarily.  A Radio Peace
 and Progress commentary in Arabic on the 20th, for example, noting
 as-Sadat's 18 October remarks on "escalation" of U.S. military aid
 to Israel, used his warning L,s a peg for criticism of the Sinai II
 accord.  The commentary also suggested that "Israel and its protectors"
 had u.:ed the "imzginary concessions" under the Sinai II accord to
 justify an increased military buildup of Israeli forces.  Similarly,
 a Moscow radio Arabic-language commentary on the 16th, alleging a
 concentration of Israeli armed forces on the Golan front and Israeli
 overflights of Syrian territory, linked the activity to Israel's
 encouragement from the Sinai II accord and from "talks being held in
 Washington on Israel's demands for huge deliveries of U.S. offensive
 we;ipons and military equipment this year and in years to come."

 MOSCOW REPLAYS PCP COMPL'A NTS ABOUT MOVES AGAINST LEFT
 Moscow has Indicated displeasure with  Portuguese  frame Minister
 Azevedo's att''mpt to decrease preponderant lef.ti.st Influence in
 public affairs by highlighting the Portuguese Communist Party's
 warning that what Is needed is "an immediate struggle against
 counterrevolutionary forces--not against. progressive forces."
 although not directly critical. of Azevedo, Moscow has reported
 the i'CP'r_ insistence that the centrist Popular Democrats be
 "expelled from the goverumz_nt" and has noted the Communist Party's
 more tempered criticism of the Portuguese socialists.   At the
 same time, Soviet media conti.nue to emphasize the now standard
 theme of the importance of "unity of progressive forces" and
 has repeated the PCP's call for a meeting wf.th "other .icftwLng
 revolutionary part:Les, as well as the Portuguese Socialist Party"
 in an attempt to resolve the country's chronic political problems.
 While Soviet media wcre still replaying favorable reports of
 Portuguese President Costa Gomes' visit to the Soviet Union,
 TZVESTiYA correspondent L. Agapov on 8 October praiscJ Lisbon's
 dissident "Ralis" regiment, dismissing as "fantastic" the rumors
 of Rc.lis involvement in coup plotting.   IZVESTIYA said that the
 regiment's supporters had "demanded" that the ruling Revolutionary
 Council restore ousted leftists to their former positions on the
 Council and in the Armed Forces Movement.  And--in a possible
 effort to dissociate President Costa Domes from the present admin-
 istration's policies--IZVESTIYA noted that the president earlier
 had said that "reactionary forces are trying to destroy the Armed
 Forces Movement."
 Another Agapov IZVESTIYA article on 11 October continued this line
 by placing blame for the recent violence in Oporto on the region's
 military commander, who "not only did not stop ultrarightists'
 provocations but even tried to disband military units lc;yal to the
 revolution." Also indicating dissatisfaction with the crackdown
 on leftists, PRAVDA on 9 October discussed a PCP statement to the
 effect that Portugal's problems could not be solved "by a swing to
 the right in government policy."  And on the 34th both PW.'.'DA--in
 a dispatch by correspondent Kotov--and IZVESTIYA reported a PCP-led
 mass meeting to protest efforts by "reactionary circles" to "move
 the policy of Portugal'?; present government to the right."
 While emphasizing the PCP's opposition to the government's move
 against leftists, the Soviet media seem anxious to portray the
 party as a reasonable political force. not involved in violent activity.

 Thus, PRAVDA on'.the 9th noted that the PCP "resolutely opposes
 chaos and anarchy," "advocates a political solution" and also
 "supports military and public discipline."  PRAVDA also noted
 the party's renewed call for a meeting of the socialists, the
 PCP and other leftist parties, together with "representatives of
 all trends in the MFA" for a discussion on ',lays to solve the
 country's "acute problems."
 The "unity" 1n.ibrel],a does not extend to cover the despised
 People's Democratic Party (PPD), however, which is now openly
 attacked both by the PCP and the Soviet media.  For example,
 PRAVDA correspondent Kotov on the 10th blamed PPD "raiders" for
 setting off violence in Oporto, and IZVESTIYA's Agapov on the
 llth attributed the Oporto clash to "gangs of fascist cutthroats
 supported by irresponsible elements in the People's Democratic
 Party."

 SLnce the Apt-La. takeover of  South Vietnam,  moni.tored PRG and URV

 remained in the country.  The issue was addressed, however, In a
 13 September PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement which
 denied charges that Americans were being held hostage and declared
 that the I'RG was protecting all foreigners residing in  outh Vietnam.
 Prior to the communist takeover, Liberation Radio reported in mid-Mar-11
 that a spokesman of the PRG delegaticn to i.he Joint Military
 Commission in Saigon had noted at a press conference there that
 "foreigners, including honest Americans, will be well treated and
 released if they are captured."  The spokesman went on to warn,
 however, that this treatment would not be accorded "U.S. military
 advisers," since they were "special cases because they had violated
 the Paris agreement."*
 On the related issue of U.S. military personnel still missing in
 action in Vietnam, Vietnamese communist comment has repeatedly linked
 Vietnamese cooperation in providing information on the missing with
 the demand that the United States fulfill its obligation under the
 Paris agreement to assist in postwar reconstruction "in both zones of
 Vietnam," which in turn would facilitate normalization of relations
 between the United States and the DRV.  Neither U.S. reconstruction
 aid nor the possibility of improved relations was cited in the latest
 announcement on repatriation of Americans still in Vietnam.

 PRG MEDIA CHARGE U.S. "HENCHMEN" AMONG RETURNING REFUGEES
 There has been no new official Vietnamese communist: public statement
 on the 1,600 refugees returning to South Vietnam by ship from Guam
 since a 15 October DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement
 endorsed an earlier PRG protest of the repatriation effort.*
 Vietnamese media comment has continued to echo the earlier official
 statements, criticizing the unauthorized return of the refugees
 but still not stating directly that they would be forbidden entry
 once they arrive.  Propaganda in the past week has injected the
 additional communist concern that undesirable elements might be
 included among the returnees, as well as the inference that
 refugees remaining in the United States may soon follow the current
 group of repatriates.
 An LPA commentary broadcast 17 October by Saigon radio, after leveling
 the now standard charge that unilateral repatriation of the refugees
 constitutes a "violat:Lon" of the sovereignty of Vietnam, accused the
 United States of attempting "to wend back a number of its henchmen
 with a view zo .  . . creating disturbances."  It is clear from the
 context of the accusation, however, that the commentary did not
 include the majority of the refugees making the return voyage in this
 category.  Instead, most are depicted as dupes of the United States
 "who were deceived and forced into emigrating."
 A 21 October commentary in the Saigon newspaper GIAI PRONG, broadcast
 by Saigon radio, portrayed the Vietnamese refugees as now living
 "parasitic, wretched lives" and claimed the United States was
 "cynically taking advantage" of their requests to be sent home.
 Charging that the United States was "evading its responsibility" to
 tt'e refugees by "recklessly" letting them sail for Vietnam, the
 commentary implied that this might be a precursor to subsequent U.S.
 attempts to deal with refugee problems.  Thus, the commentary asserted,
 "in the future,  tens of thousands of other Vietnamese will be left to
 their fate In the same manner."

 DPRK MAINTAINS NEGATIVE STANCE ON NORTH-SOUTH RELATIONS
 Recent authoritative Pyongyang comment, including Kim I1-song
 speeches on 9 and 10 October marking the 30th anniversary of
 the Korean Workers Party,* have maintained the North's intransigence
 on improving relations with the South.  Pyongyang underscored its
 negative stance with a 17 October telephone message from the DPRK
 cochairman of the North-So""th Coordination Committee (NSCC)
 rejecting an ROK offer to resume North-South contacts.   Contacts
 between the NSCC vice chairman have been suspended since the North
 postponed the 11th meeting, originally scheduled for. 30 May.  The
 current message gave the South "another month" to respond to
 DPRK conditions for resuming the dialog set forth last July.
 While Pyongyang has made no specific threats, its conditions
 are such that the current ultimatum may be laying the groundwork
 for formally breaking off the NSCC talks.   The conditions include
 demands that the South cease "war provocation maneuvers," renounce
 the "two Koreas plot" and stop "fascist repression" in the South.
 The telephone message and a NODONG SINMUN commentary on the 19th
 complained that the South had not yet responded to these conditions,
 though it had previously suggested in August that Seoul's bid to
 Join the United Nations represented a negative reply.
 Kim II-song, speaking at the 9 October anniversary rally, made no
 mention of the moribund North-South dialog.  However, he harked
 back to the formulation he had first used in August 1971--that the
 North was "ready to hold negotiations at any time with all political
 parties, including the Democratic Republican Party," the ruling party
 in the South--and which was a prelude to the Red Cross talks and
 the formation of the NSCC.  He not only ignored the past official
 dialog, but stressed that the "people" of the North and South
 should form a "national united front."
 At the rally, Kim declared that "some progress" toward reunification
 had been made in recent years.  And later in the speech he observed
 that the South Korean people were fighting for "resignatioLt of the
 traiL,:rous, reactionary government."  The North-South stalemate was
 further reflected in Kim's remarks at the anniversary banquet on the

 anniversary are discussed in the TRENDS of 16 October 1975,

 the U.S. imperialists," and that "we will have to go through
 hardships and must be ready to sacrifice ourselves,"  Ile also
 suggested that the South Korean people were "waiting for our
 helping hand," but did not go beyond the standard call for the
 North to "actively support and encourage" the struggle in the South.
 MOSCOW COOL ON KVJP ANNIVERSARY. PEKING TREATMENT STANDARD
 Moscow's low-key treatment of the KW;.' anniversary was obviously
 not calculated to reverse the ever chillier atmosphere characterizing
 Soviet-DPRK relations.  No CPSU politburo member attended the DPRK
 ambassador's anniversary reception in Moscow; the Soviet leadership
 turnout was led by Central Committee Secretary Katushev.   Both
 Moscow and Pyongyang media merely noted the reception.  Teng
 lisiao-ping led a Peking leadership turnout on tl7c anniversary, and
 Peking commec.t ,ffered standard support.
 The CPSU's anniversary greetings to the KWP credited the DPRK's
 success to its use of the experiences of other socialist countries--
 a claim Moscow has not included in past anniversary messages and,
 something Pyongyang is sure to resent since it contradicts Kim
 Il-song's claim that the DPRK has been successful precisely because
 it has not relied on the experience of others.  A 10 October dispatch
 from PRAVDA's Pyongyang correspondent, the only comment on the
 anniversary monitored in authoritative Moscow media, was mostly
 devoted to reviewing the North's economic successes.   It, too,
 attributed that success to Pyongyang's "utilizing the socialist
 countries' experience and expanding cooperation with them."  Moscow
 radio briefly reported Kim I1-song's 9 October rally speech,
 highlighting his remarks on the DPRK's efforts to develop the
 international communist movement and strengthen friendship with
 socialist countries.
 Perhaps further reflecting a chill in DPRK relations with the
 USSR and its allies, Kim I1-song did not meet with a delegation
 from Hungary, although he did meet with delegations from the other
 two communist countries which sent delegations to the Korean
 anniversary--Romanian and Cuba.
 Peking honored the KWP's anniversary with a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 editorial, and a CCP leadership turnout at the DPRK charge's
 10 October anniversary reception was led by five politburo
 members, including Teng Hsiao-ping, Chang Chun-chiao, who spoke
 at the reception, and Yao Wen-yuan.

 Peking's comment on the anniversary offered standard support for
 the DPRK.  The 10 Oct.?,ber editorial demanded dissolution of
 the UN Command and withdrawal of U.S. troops, and pledged support
 for the "just struggle of the South Korean people."  It also
 noted KWP opposition to "imperialism and modern revisionism"
 as well as the party's support for "anti-hegemonistic struggles."
 The CCP's anniversary greetings to the KWP offered support for
 the Korean people's struggle against the '!U.S. imperialists'
 occupation" of South Korea, and noted KWP opposition to
 "imperialism, colonialism, and hegemonism."

 LEADERS' SPEECHES IN GDANSI< REFLECT CONCERN OVER PUBLIC UNREST
 The Polish regime's concern about popular. 1It.0nte.nt over inflation,
 the meat shortage, and party pressure for stepped-up worker
 productivity was reflected in the attendance by Gieresk and
 Jaroszewicz at a Gdansk meet.irtg on 1.3 rlctuhur, where workers'
 grievances were aired and the two leacer.s gave frank, defensive
 speeches.*  Apparently prepared to take the risk of negative
 worker reaction,  the present regime has wide improved worker
 performance--combating absenteeism and poor productivity--the
 central theme of the seventh PZPR congress in December.  There was
 some hesitancy in publicizing tltc: detui.ls of the two leaders'
 speeches:  Only brief, bland summaries were curried in the
 14 October TRYBUNA LLIDU, with details sucb as Gierek's strong plea
 for trust and Jaroszewicz's attack on rumors appearing subsequently
 in a Warsaw radio "recording" on the 17th and in "abridged"
 versions of the two speeches in the 18-19 October weekend issue of
 TRYBUNA LLIDU.
 GIEREK      Party leader Edward  Gierek's speech betrayed his awareness
 of diminished rapport between the regime and the people.
 The PZPR First Secretary frankly appealed to his audience to "learn
 to trust the leadership, to trust the Politburo, to trust the
 government."  He went on to insist that during the past five years of
 his stewardship "we gave many proofs of our honesty" and "adequate
 proof that we can be trusted," claiming that his regime "tried to
 consult" with the rank-and-file even in making unpopular decisions.
 Implicitly appealing for the same degree of trust that was accorded
 him after he took office five years ago, Gierek recalled that while
 his initial visit to Gdansk as party leader in January 1971 had
 taken place in an atmosphere of "disbelief and reservations." he had
 won the confidence of the coastal wor.cers and his subsequent
 leadership showed that he had not failed them.
 On the issue of work discipline, Gierek reminded his audience in
 characteristically restrained term's of the inseparability of living
 standards and work performance and, without mentioning ab'sgnteeism
 directly, denounced a prevalent "flippant" attitude toward Poland's
 economic development.  Appealing to patriotism, he prr.dicted that if
 Poland stood still in economic deb-elopment 4t would be overtaken by
 other countries, lose foreign markets, and "remain somewhere on the
 fringe of the world."

 JAROSZEWICZ     The speech by Premier Jaroszewicz at tl,e sjme
 Gdansk meeting spelled out in detail the regime's
 concern over popular discontent.  Thus Jaroszewicz ridiculed alleged
 rumors to the effect that there was a wave of savings withdrawals,
 that there would be a currency exchange, and that "all" prices
 and wages would be increased.  The most important thing, lie added,
 was to ask, "How do you know?"  and to track down the source of
 "slogans which demobilize society and obstruct progress."
 The Polish premier claimed that there had been a 40-percent increase
 in real wages during the past five-year period, despite the fact
 that the sizeable proportion of raw materials which Poland imports
 from capitalist countries had risen "several hundred percent" in
 price.  While insisting that these import price increases had only
 an insignificant impact on the domestic market, he pointed out
 in effect that there was no such thing as an economy without price
 changes.   In this connection, he underscored the regime's concern
 to "safeguard" the 40-percent increase in real incomes, urged
 the party aktiv to publicize this concern, and added defensively
 that "we have no reason to damp down or correct anything" in this
 respect.
 Regarding work discipline, Jaroszewicz was more explicit than
 Gierek in demanding "improved labor productivity by,the maritime
 economy and the shipyard industry" in the Gdansk region.
 BELGRADE LEADERSHIP RENEWS CAMPAIGN AGAINST "COMINFORMISTS"
 In a series of recent high-level pronouncements, Belgrade has
 indicated'plans to take harsh measures against unidentified
 dissidents, whom it labels as "Cominformists" and "Stalinists."
 An editorial in the 13 October party weekly KOMUNIST and speeches
 by senior party officials Stane Dolanc and Vladimir Bakaric on
 17 and 21 October, respectively, have lashed out at alleged
 domestic opponents of Yugoslavia's self-management system and
 nonalined foreign policy.  Underscoring the party's concern, an
 LCY Central Committee Presidium session chaired by Tito on the
 15th discussed the political situation in the country and "certain
 aspects of hostile activities" against the party and state,
 according to TANJUG.  Similarly, a Serbian party Central Committee
 Presidium session two days later dealt with "suppression of hostile,
 illegal and other harmful activities."
 Although the significance of the current campaign is unclear, it
 comes in the wake of rumors in the Western press that Belgrade
 has arrested a group of pro-Soviet conspirators.  The campaign
 thus suggests last year's Cominformist affair, in which 32 persons

 were arrested and sentenced for "hostile activity" against the
 state, including plans to form their own political party.*  Since
 that time Belgrade has reported the prosecution of other "Comin-
 formists," and Dolanc revealed Belgrade's growing concern in
 a speech last June in which he asserted that those who favor
 "dogmatism" are "more dangerous" than those favoring a return
 to capitalist relations.
 Some features of the current campaign suggest that the party
 leadership wants to carefully spell out to the rank and file a
 stiffening policy aginst disloyal elements.   Accordingly, the
 Central Committee Presidium session, reported by TANJUG, concluded
 that it would "inform" party members about its "assessments."
 In addition, the KOr1JNIST editorial carefully distinguished the
 party's positions on different kinds of "dogmatism."  Thus the
 editorial stressed the need to educate those who are dogmatists
 out of ignorance, but it called for severe punishment of those
 who preach "dogmatic, Stalinist understanding of socialism" in
 order to promote their own "private interests."  Equating the
 latter with the Cominformists of 1948, KOMUNIST called for their
 strict and swift punishment as "deserved by those who follow the
 road of national betrayal and counterrevolution."
 An equally hard line was taken by Dolanc at the conclusion of a
 long speech in Novi Sad on Yugoslavia's efforts to overcome its
 current economic difficulties.  Defending the regime's policies
 of &alf-management, decentralization and nonalinement against
 persons who offer "pseudo-Marxist demagogy" or "Stalinist slogans
 about the omnipotence of the centralist bureaucratic system," he
 labeled them "traitors" who will be punished accordingly.
 Neither the KOMUNIST editorial nor Dolanc referred specifically
 to foreign elements.   Bakaric, however, was somewhat less restrained.
 According to a TANJUG report of his speech in Zagreb, he warned
 against "foreign influences" on the Yugoslav party, asserting that
 the Cominformists wanted to "create socialism on the basis of state
 ownership and join in all organizations ranging from the Warsaw
 Pact to CEMA."  In addition, a 16 October speech by Branko Mikulic,
 party leader'of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and a 20 October commentary by
 Zagreb radio's outspoken Milika Sundic both attacked unidentified
 "foreign masters" of the Cominformists.

 SOVIET MEDIA CRITICIZE SAKHAROV. NOBEL AWARD
 Soviet media have responded to Andrey Sakharov's reception of the
 1975 Nobel Peace Prize with personal attacks on him and charges
 that the Nobel committee's choice was a "political gesture"
 designed to impede detente.
 Moscow responded initially through a TASS commentary and several
 radio reports on 10 October which criticized the award, accused
 Sakharov of opposing the easing of international tension, and
 attempted to link him with such Soviet nemeses as Chile's Pinochet
 and U.S. Senator Jackson.
 The harshest attack on Sakharov so far came in a 15 October
 LITERARY GAZETTE article by A. Viktorov.  Viktorov accused
 Sakharov of "hating" Soviet society, "which so indulgently
 ignores his anti-social position."
 The main central newspapers have picked up TASS reports of criti-
 cism of the award from such Western sources as the French
 communist paper L'HUMANITE but have not yet weighed in with their
 own commentary.
 To date the attacks cn Sakharov fall well short in scope and
 intensity of the 1973 press campaign launched against both
 Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.  The 1973 campaign had
 featured the publication of letters from irate Soviet citizens,
 presumably to encourage the appearance of wide public support
 for the regime's position.  Soviet media have not yet carried
 the broad hints dropped at that time--just before Solzhenitsyn's
 expulsion--that the author of Gulag Archipelago was free to leave
 the country.  The attacks on Sakharov could still intensify
 further, however.  The 1973 campaign was months in the making.

 FEUD BETWEEN MATHEMATICAL ECONOMISTS, GOSPLAN REVIVED
 The mid-October award of the Nobel Prize to Soviet mathematician
 L.V. Iantorovich for his contributions to planning theory seems
 likely to aggravate the chronic debate between Soviet mathematical
 economists and the more traditional economists grouped around
 Gosplan.  Kantorovich, one of the founders of Soviet mathematical
 economics, has strongly endorbed optimal planning methods
 denounced by Gosplan and has been involved in name-calling with
 traditional economists.  Even before the announcement of the award,
 the dispute had flared up again as the September issue of Gosplan's
 journal PLANNED ECONOMY assailed the mathematical economists in
 three separate articles, while Gosplan rejected a new program
 presented by this group.
 Although the dispute in recent years has centered mainly around the
 optimal planning methods of the Central Economic MatLamatics Institute
 (TsEMI) and its innovative director N.P. Fedorenko, Kantorovich has
 been attacked in PLANNED ECONOMY for promoting these methods also.*
 He participates in the work of the Academy of Sciences' economics
 division, even though he is a member of the mathematics division.  His
 support has given liberal economists Fedorenko, A.M. Rumyantsev and
 N.N. Inozemtsev the decisive margin among the six full members of the
 division.   Like Fedorenko, Kantorovich is anathema to conservatives, but
 appears to have considerable high-level party support.
 RENEWED DISPUTE     The new flare-up of name-calling appears to have
 been occasioned by Fedorenko's proposal of a new
 "System of Complex Planning" (SKP), presented as a preliminary stage
 in his controversial "System of Optimal Functioning of the Economy"
 (SOFE).  Fedorenko had described SKP at length in a 1974 book
 entitled "Complex National Economic Planning," and in a November 1974
 KOMMUNIST article.  Like SOFE, it aims at providing a methodology
 for matching planning goals with available resources (the "program-goal
 principle").  It deemphasizes the branch and territorial principles of
 planning and the directive nature of the plan--although Fedorenko denies
 that his proposals would undermine these long-established principles.
 The conilict appears to focus on the longterm 1976-90 plan, on which
 TsEMI and Gosplan's computer center are working jointly.  Fedorenko
 in his KOMMUNIST article contended that scientific forecasting,
 goal-setting and the complex approach play an even greater role in
 longterm plans than in five year plans.
 *  For background on. earlier controversies between the Fedorenko
 and Gosplan during 1972-73, see the TRENDS of 31 October 1973,   group

 22 OCTOBER 1975
 Gosplan officials (notably chairman N.K. Baybako\                 deputy chairman
 and computer center head N.P, Lebedinskiy, and PLANNED ECONOMY
 chief editor V.S. Glagolev) bitterly resent Fedorenko's criticisms
 of their present methods and attack Fedorenko's proposed new
 methods.  They stand by Gosplan's "Automated System of Planning
 Calculations" (ASPR), which seeks to link all computer systems into
 a national information-gathering system to cope with the increasingly
 complicated tasks of planning.  Glagolev reviewed the 1974 Fedorenko
 book in the September 1974 PLANNED ECONOMY and complained that the
 book wrongly claimed that the SKP methodology was compatible with
 the ASPR system.   He cited a September 1973 PLANNED ECONOMY article
 by Lebedinskiy which flatly declared SOFE and ASPR "incompatible"
 and "mutually exclusive."
 Although relatively restrained since 1973, PLANNED ECONOMY carried
 three items attacking Fedorenko's ideas in its September 1975
 issue.  One was a second review of Fedorenko's 1974 book, another
 was a report of a Gosplan meeting which rejected SKP, and the third
 article was chief editor Glagolev's attack on an English economist's
 book which praised SOFE.  The review of Fedorenko's book, by
 Academy of Social Sciences Professor M.Z. Bor, a longtime critic,
 and S. Logvinov, attacked SKP and described SOFE as based on
 "concepts of bourgeois theories" and "market socialism."  The report
 on the Gosplan conference indicated that Fedorenko defended his
 program, but that foes assailed its concepts of adjustable five year
 plans and goal-setting and defended the "directive character of plans."
 Computer center chief Lebedinskiy summed up by declaring that SKP
 in its present form "cannot be used" in ASPR and that development of
 ASPR had already proceeded too far to include any such new vague
 theories as SKP.  Gosplan's sensitivity was also evident in Glagolev's
 review of Michael Ellman's 1973 book "Planning Problems in the USSR,"
 which allegedly lauded SOFE and TsEMI and "belittled" the work of
 Gosplan.   Glagolev praised ASPR and cited (osplan Chairman Baybakov's
 statement (published in the March 1974 PLANNED ECONOMY) that mathematical
 economic methods, "no matter how important," are only one of many means
 of planning.
 KANTOROVICH AWARD     Kantorovich's Nobel Prize for contributions to the
 "theory of optimal use of resources" was belatedly
 reported in PRAVDA on 18 October, and on 21 October TASS broadcast a
 statement by Kantorovich denying "West-ern" allegations that optimal
 planning is connected with "market socialism."  The statement was part
 of an interview to appear in the next day's LITERARY GAZETTE.  Answering
 the interviewer's leading question as to why a capitalist scholarly
 organization would present such an award to a Soviet economist,
 Kantorovich defensively argued that his work "is to a considerable degree"
 applicable to any economically developed country, although "most valuable
 and most appropriate for the socialist economic system where scientific
 planning plays an immeasurably greater role."

 CHINA
 AGRICULTURAL. CONFERENCE ENDS, SETS FARM MECHANIZATION GOALS
 Peking marked the end of the national conference on learning from
 Tachai in agriculture---which had opened in Tachai on 15 September
 and closed in Peking on 19 October--by publicizing selected major
 speeches and a 21 October PEOPLE'S DAILY edi.torial.*  The editorial
 stated that the conference "set the seal. on btsically achieving farm
 mechanization by 1980" and that it was expected to have a "far-
 reaching" influence in "accelerating the pace of our country's
 agricultural development, effecting a still bigger rise in the
 national economy."  The editorial instructed county party committees
 throughout the country to lead communes and production brigades in
 learning from Tachai, in strengthening "stability and unity," and in
 "boosting the national economy."
 Throughout the conference Peking has stressed the need to build
 Tachai-type count:-es, which are advanced both in ideology and production,
 and to basicall  mecnanize agriculture by 1980.  Speaking at the closing
 session of the conference, long-time Tachai leader Chen Yung-kuei, as
 reported by NCNA on 20 October, stated that a "new upsurge" in
 building Tachai-type  counties is expected.     The precise quota for
 forming Tachai-type counties was set forth in a 20 October NCNA
 account of a speech given by V.'_-e Premier Hua Kuo-feng on the 15th.
 Hua stated that at leant "100 new T-,chai-type counties" should be
 established in the country each year for the next five years.  This
 rate would bring the total number of Tachai counties to 800,
 approximately 40 percent of all counties in China.  Peking apparently
 will keep close watch on local efforts to establish Tachai-type
 counties.  Hua declared that "every t'.;ae a Tachai-type county is
 built, it must be seriously checked by the province and reported to
 the central authorities."  Hua characterized the setting up of
 Ta.:aai-type counties as an "urgent task in pushing the national
 economy forward" so that China will be abie to advance to the "front
 ranks of the world before the end of this century"--an objective
 announced by Chou En-lai at the Fourth National People's Congress
 last January.  Hua specifically called for speeding the rate of farm
 mechanization in order to increase agricultural yields, thus paving
 the way for the "modernization of industry, national defense and
 science and technolcgy."

 17 September 1975, pages 23-24, of 1 October 1975, pages 30-32, and

 TECHNICIAN SHORTAGE    The pressing need for larger numbers of skilled
 workers required to mechanize agriculture in
 the next five years appears to have prompted a decision to allow
 limited incentives to technical workers and to insure that their
 technical knowledge is utilized.  For example, an article by Shanghai
 shipyard workers entitled "Bring the Positive Role of Technical
 Personnel into Play," published in RED FLAG (No. 10) and broadcast by
 Peking radio on 15 October, revealed that "most of the technical
 personnel" who were sent down to the shipyard "to do manual work
 have been given technical jobs."  The shipyard's party committee
 was lauded for i2eing to it that technical personnel "are not used
 only is a labor force" and for paying attention "to bringing their
 specialities into full play."  A genera]. upgrading of worker skills
 also appears underway at the shipyard, as the article noted that
 workers "short in theoretical knowledge and in technical work" are
 "being trained to enhance their skills while practicing production."
 The article was careful to warn that it would be ideologically wrong
 to go too far and "study technology while ignoring the study of
 politics," but it made clear that "efforts must be made to encourage
 the technicians to study technology" and to fellow the path of "red
 and expert."  Sir,Llarly, a new effort to increase the supply of
 skilled workers was also indicated in a 17 October NCNA report which
 argued that "it is necessary to build" an "agriculture technical
 force with high awareness for socialism and technical skills" in
 order to achieve the farm mechanization goals set at the conference
 on learning from Tachai in agriculture.
 A second RED FLAG article, broadcast on 17 October by Nanking radio,
 t'iscussed industrialization in a Kiangsu county and indicated that
 technical personnel could receive incentives.  The article stressed
 that income of workers in commune industries should be decided by the
 masses, belt it noted that "it is necessary to provide a necessary
 subsidy to those with fairly good skills," though "the amount of the
 subsidy should not be too h?.gh."
 PEKING COMMEMORATES 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE "LONG MARCH"
 Peking marked the 40th anniversary of the end of the Long March on
 19 October with a joint PEOPLE'S DAILY-LIBERATION ARMY DAILY editorial.
 Both papers also reprinted a full-page article written by Mar.,hal Liu
 Po-cheng in 1959 reviewing the significance of the Long March in the
 history of the Chinese revolution.  Peking is not known to have marked
 the anniversary previously, though a number of military reminiscences
 of the Long March were published in the late 1950's and early 1960's.

 The 19 October joint edt:.oria.l linked the principal Lessons of the
 Long March experience directly to the current campaign-: to consolidate
 unity and stability under the dictatorship u:' the proletariat and to
 criticize capitulationitim in the novel "Writer Margin."  Branding
 both the "left opportunist line" of Wang; Ming, a "running dog of.
 Soviet revisionist social-Imperialism," and the "right opportunist
 line" of the "ignominious renegade" Chang Kuo-tao uH  "revisionism,"
 the editorial noted that. Liu Shuo-chi and Lin 1'iao had "follo,acd the
 same path" as Wang and Chiang.   it urged persistence in the struggle
 against "revisionism and capitulatiunistn" and warned that the struggle
 between Marxism and revisionism in China will. continue "in the next
 50 or 100 years and even 10,000 years from now."  The editorial
 counseled that only strict adherence to Chairman Mao's revolutionary
 line as exemplified by the "very vivid and rich teaching material"
 of the Long March experience would ensure victory in the future.
 The joint editorial also noted that "whether to practice unity or
 splLttism" was an important question during the Long March.  Hailing
 Chairman Mao's advocacy of "unity for a common revolutionary
 objective," the editorial stressed the current necessity of applying
 the "Red Army's glorious tradition of uniting; for struggle" to the
 present work of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to study
 theory to combat revisionism, to promote stability and unity, and to
 push socialist construction forward.
 PROVINCIAL CELEBRATIONS    All PRC province's marked the Long March
 anniversary, and most held "grand meetings"
 on the 18th, usually presided over by a military district deputy
 commander or political commissar.   Canton Military Region Commander

 several days before the anniversary, including discussion Meetings
 and the dispatch of teams of Long March veterans to inspire PLA

 NOTE
 SOVIET 'MEDIA ON U'.S.GRA?IN DEAL: Consistent with their general
 silence on the issue,,Soviet media have not reported the long-
 term -U.S.-Soviet accord on grain saled reached by negotiators
 in Moscow.  The media had also maintained silence on the nego-
 tiations leading up to the agr,ee.,;cnt.  A single broadcast 'to
 North America in August, however,, did rebut assertions in the
 United States that last summer's grain sales to'the Soviet Union
 'had fueled inflation.  Moscow continues to underscore the impor-
 tance it places on the whole spectrum of bilateral trade..
 Brezhnev's message to a recent session of the joint U.S.-Soviet
 Trade and Economic Council, as reported by TABS on 8 October.,

 These statistics are based on the volcecast commentary output of the Moscow and
 Peking domestic and f.raernational radio services. The term "commentary" is used
 to denote the lengthy iteia-radio talk, speech, press article or editorial, govern-
 ment or party statement, or diplomatic note. Items of extensive reportage are
 counted as commentaries.

 discussed in the body of the Trends. Some may have been covered in prior issues:
 in other cases the propaganda content may be routine or of minor significance.
