 Chinese Domestic Politics:   Recent Developments
 Since the beginning of the'year the Chinese leadership
 has made significant progress in preparing for a smooth suc-
 cession to a younger leadership.                               The pivotal event was the
 Chinese Communist Party's Fifth Plenum, at which Deng Xiaoping
 successfully elevated to the topmost level of the leadership
 those who share his reform-minded approach to China's prob-
 lems and removed from the Politburo the remaining symbols of
 leftist opposition.  Despite the Fifth Plenum's achievements
 in preparing the succession, there are still underlying eco-
 nomic and social issues that will bear directly on the pros-
 pects for stability.
 The Fifth Plenum did not deal in a major way with mili-
 tary affairs, but before its convocation the high command of
 the People's Liberation Army underwent the most extensive re-
 shuffle since the early 1970s.   While some of these shifts
 were designed to pave the way for the plenum by displacing
 those generals suspected of having leftist ties, most were
 aimed at elevating younger, capable officers to important com-
 mand positions.   The most significant change was the promotion
 of Yang Dezhi to PLA Chief of Staff and to the party Secre-
 tariat.  Yang's elevation to the latter post came at the ex-
 pense of Geng Biao, who was initially proposed for the job.
 Despite this setback there is no evidence that Geng is in
 serious political trouble.   In the aftermath of the Soviet
 invasion of Afghanistan, the Chinese have given no sign that
 they intend to invest a larger proportion of funds in mili-
 tary modernization.
 This memorandum was prepared under the auspices of the National

 Since the beginning of the year the Chinese leadership
 has made major progress toward preparing for a smooth suc-
 cession to a younger leadership.   The pivotal event in this
 regard was the Chinese Communist Party's Fifth Plenum, held
 in late February, which represented a personal triumph for
 Deng Xiaoping.   The personnel and organizational changes
 approved by the plenum were designed to ensure long-term
 political continuity and stability while China pursues its
 modernization program.
 The dismissal of four Politburo members considered to
 be leftist holdovers strengthens Deng's hand and removes a
 symbol of resistance to his policies.   Their fall also helps
 clear the way for the thoroughgoing reform and revitaliza-
 tion of the party bureaucracy that Deng and his colleagues
 consider essential for successful implementation of modern-
 ization policies.   In the aftermath of the plenum almost all
 of China's provinces have held high-level meetings to lay the
 groundwork for dealing with the factionalism, corruption, and
 ideological confusion that has beset the party since the Cul-
 Two Rising Stars
 The elevation of two Deng proteges, Hu Yaobang and Zhao
 Ziyang, to key positions in the hierarchy should prepare them
 to take over the reins of power during the next few years.
 Last month Zhao was appointed "presiding vice premier," a
 designation that suggests he oversees the day-to-day work of
 the government.  Hu Yaobang is General Secretary of the Cen-
 tral Committee, presiding over a reconstituted party secre-
 tariat.   Hu and Zhao bear a distinctly Dengist stamp, but
 neither man is yet in an unchallengeable position of power,
 and both will be reliant on Deng for political support and
 policy guidance for some time.   Zhao, moving from a provin-
 cial base to the center, will need time to get a grasp on
 the government bureaucracy he is now charged with supervising.
 There are reportedly some in the leadership who are not
 happy with the kind of succession arrangements that appear to
 push aside older leaders still in good health.   These senior
 leaders will probably continue to act at times as a brake on
 Deng and his reformist team.   Unlike the four leftists, they
 do not represent a consistent, programmatic opposition to

 Deng, but rather they raise occasional objections to the
 pace and extent of political change fostered by Deng.   Given
 their seniority and prestige, Deng cannot ignore their con-
 cerns, and, as in the past, it can be expected that when
 certain of his policies meet with strong challenge, he will
 feel constrained to retreat.
 Hua's Future
 While Deng's relations with the other seniors could
 prove prickly at times, the most problematic set of rela-
 tionships in the next few years involves the three key
 figures in the "successor" generation--Hua Guofeng, Hu
 Yaobang, and Zhao Ziyang.   Their overlapping responsibil-
 ities almost ensure a sense of competitiveness.   In the
 transition period, while Deng's influence is at its height,
 Hua is at a decided disadvantage.  His power base has been
 progressively eroded since Deng's return to power, and there
 are rumors now about his impending loss of the premiership
 or even the party chairmanship.   Indeed, it is possible that
 he will relinquish the premiership to Zhao, perhaps this
 year.
 While Hua has proven adept at adjusting to the prevail-
 ing trend and has clearly identified himself with the modern-
 ization program, his position has become still more anomalous
 after the Fifth Plenum.  Hu and Zhao have assumed primary
 responsibilities in the party and government bureaucracies,
 respectively, leaving Hua as a largely titular party chairman.
 There may be some followers of Deng Xiaoping who believe that
 Hua does not merit even that title, bestowed on him by Mao in
 a manner that is now officially deprecated.   There is thus an
 air of uncertainty at the top level of the hierarchy, and the
 outcome will depend on how Hua manages to define his relation-
 ships within the collective leadership emerging from the
 plenum.
 In any event, Deng himself has made it clear that he will
 play a progressively less active role in the day-to-day admin-
 istration of state affairs.   At the session of the National
 People's Congress scheduled for August he may well step down
 as vice premier much as he relinquished the PLA chief of staff
 post earlier this year.   His concern is to set the stage for
 a smooth passage of power to the younger generation, avoiding
 the turmoil of the succession struggle that characterized
 Mao's last years.   Deng will nonetheless continue to play a
 major role in policy formulation by virtue of his position

 as party vice chairman.   Other senior leaders, such as Li
 Xiannian and Ye Jianying, will almost certainly follow Deng's
 lead in surrendering some of their responsibilities.
 Military Reshuffle
 There is no indication that the Fifth Plenum dealt in
 a major way with military affairs;, but before its convocation
 the PLA high command underwent the most extensive reshuffle
 since the rotation of military region commanders in 1973 (see
 accompanying table).  While some of these shifts were designed
 to pave the way for the plenum by displacing those generals
 suspected of having leftist ties, most were aimed at elevating
 younger officers to important command positions and stressing
 military over political qualifications.   In terms of party-
 army relations the reshuffle will enable civilian officials
 to conduct their affairs with less concern about interference
 from military leaders.
 Of these appointments, clearly the most important is
 that of General Yang Dezhi to replace Deng as Chief of
 Staff.  Yang's concurrent positions on the Military Com-
 mission Standing Committee and the party Secretariat indi-
 cate that he will play a major role in defense policy
 formulation as well as implementation.
 Setback for Geng Biao
 Yang's elevation to the Secretariat at the Fifth Plenum
 apparently came at the expense of Vice Premier Geng Biao.
 Geng was one of a number of
 senior o  icia s proposed  or membership in the new party
 Secretariat.  At the session devoted to discussion of can-
 didates, however, there was an outpouring of criticism
 directed at Geng's abuse of his leadership privileges.   Many
 of the accusations revolved around his repeated use o.f his
 influence with the Foreign Ministry and the Xinaghua news
 agency to arrange choice overseas assignments for members
 of his family.  He is also said to have a lavish lifestyle.
 Although this incident suggests Geng has some high-level
 detractors in the party,  his continued prominence as Mili-
 tary Commission Secretary General strongly suggests that he
 is not in serious political trouble.

 Problems Remain
 Despite the Fifth Plenum's achievements in preparing
 the succession from Deng's generation, there are still a
 number of pressing issues that will bear directly on the
 prospects for stability:
 -- The posthumous rehabilitation of former Chief of
 State Liu Shaoqi raises sensitive questions about
 the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zelong's responsi-
 bility, and the fate of current leaders who bene-
 fited from that movement.
 -- Party reform down through the swollen ranks will
 exacerbate tensions as party functionaries who
 are incompetent or resist modernization policies
 maneuver to protect their interests.
 -- The permanence of the succession arrangements
 will increasingly depend on whether the leader-
 ship can point to positive results from its
 economic modernization policies.
 Modernization and the Military
 Perhaps more than any other factor, this need to show
 substantial economic progress has militated against an in-
 crease in defense spending.   The Soviet invasion of Afghan-
 istan notwithstanding, the Chinese have given no sign that
 they intend to invest a larger proportion of funds in mili-
 tary modernization.   Indeed, in a major speech in January,
 setting forth priorities for the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping re-
 affirmed that the civilian sector will take precedence over
 military needs unless a major war breaks out.  Moreover,
 military modernization continues to be listed third behind
 agriculture and industry in the official ranking of prior-
 ities, a spot that may overstate its actual importance.   A
 number of senior PLA leaders, including Geng Biao, have told
 visitors that upgrading of the armed forces is last among
 the Four Modernizations,  after science and technology.
 Beijing may nevertheless decide to reallocate resources
 among the service arms, stepping up the pace of modernization
 in such key areas as antitank weapons and air defense.   Such
 a decision would probably increase the prospects for foreign
 licensing arrangements.   The Chinese continue to show interest
 in the acquisition of military technology abroad, but at this
 juncture have apparently ruled out buying costly weapon systems
 in quantity.

 SECRET
 Despite indications that the Chinese intend to hold
 the line on defense spending, the"issue may not be entirely
 settled.   Beijing is currently in the process of working out
 its new 10-year economic plan (1981-90) and this provides an
 opportunity for those who favor an acceleration of military
 modernization to air their case.
 la debate is
 currently under way in Beijing between those military men who
 want to arm quickly and civilian leaders who believe a war
 involving China is far in the future.
 those favoring rapid rearmament want to finance
 foreign military purchases with borrowed funds.   This has
 been resisted by civilian planners who fear that China will
 be unable to repay the loans and object to investing funds
 in areas that will not produce export earnings.   Those
 planners are allegedly somewhat more sympathetic to purchasing
 military-related technology on credit because, unlike the hard-
 ware itself, dual-use technology could be used to earn foreign
 exchange.
 Despite this questioning of prevailing policy, it seems
 unlikely that there will be a proportional increase in China's
 defense outlays at least during the next couple of years.
 This is primarily because Deng himself seems to be behind the
 policy of holding steady the military's portion of the budget
 while looking for less expensive ways to modernize the PLA.
 At present, such efforts are aimed at bringing new blood into
 the command structure at all levels, training and rooting out
 political factionalism.   These are all policies that have
 been pursued with greater vigor during the past year and
 particularly since the Fifth Plenum.
 Long-term economic plans notwithstanding, China's mili-
 tary budget in the coming years will be influenced strongly
 by developments abroad.   China is acutely aware of its mili-
 tary vulnerability, perhaps more than at any time in the past
 few years,   and the Soviet move into Afghanistan confirmed
 Beijing's worst fears.   Although Beijing has not gone so far
 as to alter its assessment of the probability of war, it has
 become more vocal about the need to take concrete actions to
 oppose the Soviets.   During Secretary Brown's visit in January,
 Deng first struck this new tone, calling on China and the
 United States to do something "in a down-to-earth way" to

 the People's Daily indicated that China intends to do more
 to meet its "increasing international responsibilities."
 The evidence to date suggests that China has diplomatic moves
 in mind rather than an increase in its own defense effort.
 This could change, however.    The general level of interna-
 tional tension, and Soviet and Vietnamese actions and the
