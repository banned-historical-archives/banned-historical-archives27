 Afghanistan: The Cease-Fire and
 the Future of the Insur enc
 in the Panjsher Valley
 Key Judgments   The insurgent stronghold in the Panjsher Valley-strategically located
 Information available near Kabul and major Soviet supply lines-continues to be a significant
 as of 15 August 1983 military threat and potential political embarrassment to Soviet forces and
 was used in this report.
 the Communist regime in Afghanistan. The leadership-under Ahmad
 Shah Masood-and organization of the resistance in the Panjsher have
 become the model of a militarily effective insurgency. Despite the de facto
 cease-fire in the Panjsher Valley between the insurgents and the Soviets,
 the valley remains an important symbol of the viability of the Afghan
 resistance movement.
 The Soviets have launched six major operations against the insurgents in
 the Panjsher since the invasion. We believe the cumulative effect of Soviet
 and Afghan Government military pressure led local insurgent leaders to
 accept the Soviet offer of a cease-fire in January 1983. The insurgents'
 inability to protect civilians had contributed to a 60-percent decline in the
 valley's population and a weakening in support for the insurgents.
 The military and political position of the Panjsheri insurgents and the
 resistance movement overall have not, in our view, been undermined so far
 by the cease-fire in the valley. The Panjsheris have benefited from the
 agreement, and they probably will attempt to maintain the cease-fire in the
 valley into the fall of 1983 and agree to similar truces in the future:
 ? The insurgents have infiltrated equipment and weapons into the valley,
 stockpiled food, and tried to protect civilians and raise their morale.
 Masood's forces also attacked a rival insurgent band that threatened the
 Panjsheris' supply lines.
 ? We judge that the Panjsher Valley insurgents could establish new
 strongholds throughout northern Afghanistan in one to two years,
 especially if they secured additional foreign material support.
 Our analysis suggests that the Soviets hoped the cease-fire would encour-
 age other insurgent groups to reach similar agreements. They also believed
 that over the short term the truce would reduce insurgent attacks near
 Kabul, allow the Soviets to redeploy troops from the valley for operations
 in other areas, and encourage Masood to attack rival bands, weakening all
 local insurgent groups:
 ? So far no other major insurgent groups have agreed to truces with the So-
 viets. The Panjsher cease-fire has not divided the resistance movement
 further nor been condemned by most insurgent groups inside or outside
 Afghanistan.

 ? We believe Soviet and Afghan Government forces have not gained any
 significant military advantages from the truce; insurgents in other areas
 have defeated government forces withdrawn from the valley.
 We judge that Moscow will tolerate limited attacks by Panjsher insurgents
 outside the valley in hopes of preserving and extending the cease-fire. In
 our view, however, the Soviets will be impelled eventually to resume major
 operations against Masood's forces in response to the continuing buildup of
 his military capability and the likelihood that his troops will launch
 extensive attacks outside the Panjsher:
 ? The insurgents probably would survive new Soviet and Afghan attacks on
 the Panjsher even though Soviet and government forces, by undertaking
 a major offensive, could reoccupy the main valley.
 ? In the less likely event that the Panjsher organization was destroyed
 militarily, effective guerrilla resistance would continue in Afghanistan,
 although the insurgent movement's morale would decline temporarily.

 Afghanistan: The Cease-Fire and
 the Future of the Insurgency
 in the Panjsher Valley F
 The strategic location of the Panjsher Valley near
 Kabul and the growing effectiveness of the insurgents
 there have made the valley increasingly important for
 the Soviets, the Afghan Government, and the insur-
 gents.
 between early 1980 and late 1982 Panjsher-based
 guerrillas repeatedly attacked the Soviet fuel pipeline
 and convoys on the Termez to Kabul road, reducing
 vital supplies to major Afghan and Soviet garrisons
 and airfields near the capital.
 he Panjsher is a major m i ration route for
 supplies from Pakistan to northern Afghanistan. By
 mid-1982 the survival and growth of the Panjsher
 insurgent organization had become a major political
 and military embarrassment for the Babrak regime
 and a symbol of resistance that raised the morale of
 Afghans opposed to the Communist government.F_
 International press coverage has given the Panjsher
 and the leader of the resistance in the valley, Ahmad
 Shah Masood, an inordinate amount of attention
 compared to other insurgent bases and leaders in the
 country that have been equally effective but less well
 publicized.
 one guerrilla leader has established an insurgent
 organization with hundreds of men in Balkh Province.
 Reports from the US Embassy in Kabul indicate that
 guerrillas operating from strongholds have periodical-
 ly isolated the cities of Herat and Qandahar, causing
 Soviet and Afghan forces to launch major counter-
 attacks. Repeated insurgent attacks from the Pagh-
 man area, 15 kilometers west of Kabul, have de-
 stroyed convoys and damaged facilities near the
 capital. The press attention given to the Panjsher,
 however, combined with its strategic location and the
 effectiveness of the insurgency there, have given
 impetus to Soviet efforts to destroy or co-opt the
 resistance in the valley.
 cumulative effect contributed to Masood's willingness
 to accept a cease-fire in January 1983.
 Soviet and Afghan offensives .     25X1
 could not eliminate Masood's guerrilla bands, primar-
 ily because the large-scale sweep operations were
 insufficiently aggressive and lacked the speed, mobil-
 ity, and surprise necessary for successful counterin-
 surgency operations.                                                                                                      25X1
 eve estimate that between
 early 1980 and December 1982 Soviet and Afghan
 forces suffered between 1,000 and 2,500 killed and
 wounded-mostly Afghan-and the insurgents suf-
 fered somewhat lower losses in combat in the valley
 (see table).
 In addition to their military efforts against the insur-
 gents, Soviet and Afghan forces have attempted to
 bribe or coerce civilians in the Panjsher to reduce
 their support to the insurgents.
 Soviet and Afghan troops deliberately destroyed some
 crops and farms during past attacks.
 after the offensive in May 1982,
 Afghan officials tried unsuccessfully to pacify areas of
 the valley by distributing food and goods to civilians.

 Insurgent Strengths and Weaknesses
 Strengths. The success of the resistance in the
 Panjsher Valley has resulted from organizing all
 insurgents in the area into military units under a
 single command and using them in coordinated offen-
 sive and defensive operations                       25X1
 Masood was able to weld together 25X1
 many formerly disorganized insurgent bands largely
 because of his willingness-unusual for an Afghan
 leader-to set aside ethnic, religious, political, and
 tribal differences to fight Soviet and Afghan regime
 forces. 25X1
 Since early 1980 Soviet and Afghan forces have
 launched six major ground offensives and many air
 attacks into the Panjsher Valley. These attacks failed
 to destroy the resistance, although we believe their

 Ahmad Shah Masood
 Insurgent Commander in the Panjsher
 Ahmad Shah Masood has become the best known
 field commander in the Afghan resistance and has
 built what many believe to be the most successful
 insurgent band in Afghanistan. Masood's successes
 have boosted insurgent morale throughout the coun-
 try and have gained him considerable international
 press coverage, with one article stating that he was
 emerging as a national folk hero.
 Masood has studied the works of Mao Zedong and
 Che Guevara and has a good understanding of guer-
 rilla tactics.                          Masood
 understands the need for training, including physical
 conditioning, development of tactical skills, and
 'political indoctrination" in current affairs and the
 nature of Communism. Although he professes alle-
 giance to the Jamiat-i-Islami organization, one of the
 six major insurgent groups, he apparently uses this
 tie primarily to procure weapons.
 An ethnic Tajik born in the Panjsher Valley in 1953,
 Masood was an engineering student at Kabul Univer-
 sity in 1973 when the King was overthrown. Masood
 later fled to Pakistan, where he joined other Afghan
 dissidents in opposing the Daoud regime and its
 Communist successors. Along with other Panjsheri
 students, he returned to the valley after the Soviet
 intervention in 1979 and won the support of the local
 population and insurgents from the fundamentalist
 Hizbi Islami organization.
 We believe the effective use of guerrilla warfare      for defending the Panjsher
 tactics-avoiding direct combat with superior enemy
 firepower and manpower-has helped the insurgents
 survive massive attacks in the valley and raid targets
 outside the Panjsher.

 Acquiring more light infantry weapons has helped the
 Panjsher resistance to increase significantly the num-
 ber of aimed insurgents and to expand operations,
 The guerrillas are
 armed with a variety of rifles, automatic weapons,
 antitank rockets, mines, and a growing number of
 heavy machineguns, mortars, and recoilless rifles.
 growing numbers of
 12.7- and 14.5-mm heavy machineguns helped the
 insurgents improve their air defenses in 1982. We
 believe the Panjsheri insurgents destroyed or damaged
 between 20 and 30 helicopters in attacks inside and
 outside the Panjsher between early 1980 and early
 1983.
 Training in weapons and tactics has helped increase
 the effectiveness and number of insurgent attacks.
 result of the war since late 1979 and that between
 30,000 and 40,000 civilians and insurgents of the
 90,000 prewar population remain in the main valley.
 Negotiations and the Cease-Fire
 The military situation that developed in the Panjsher
 following the Soviet and Afghan occupation of the
 main valley in 1982 and the insurgents' ability to
 avoid destruction in the mountains and side valleys
 led to talks and a cease-fire with the insurgents in
 January 1983.                             the
 Soviets initiated negotiations in December 1982, seek-
 ing an agreement that would halt insurgent attacks in
 the Panjsher and apparently also in the northern
 provinces and along the main road from Termez to
 Kabul. Although Masood said he rejected this plan
 and the insurgents claim no agreement was signed, a
 cease-fire subsequently has been observed by both
 sides in the Panjsher. As a result of the cease-fire,
 Soviet and Afghan forces withdrew from most of the
 valley in late April 1983
 Weaknesses. The Panjsheri insurgents appear to have
 realized only recently the need to plan for a long-term
 struggle and to protect and win the loyalty of their
 the insurgents' greatest error
 was their failure to stockpile adequate food for the
 winter, especially after several enemy attacks on the
 Panjsher in 1982.
 insurgents did little to protect civilians from
 air attacks or prepare them psychologically for a long
 war.
 Failure to protect civilians has contributed to a signif-
 icant decline in the valley's population and, with high
 noncombatant casualties, has lowered civilian support
 civilians were becom-
 ing depressed, were not as friendly toward the insur-
 gents, and were increasingly reluctant to give them
 material support.
 60 percent of the population has fled the main v
 as a result of enemy attacks.
 between 1980 and early 1983, air attacks killed 3,000
 civilians and destroyed 6,800 homes. We estimate
 that 5,000 to 10,000 civilians have died as a direct
 Masood's Motives. We believe the Panjsheris accept-
 ed a cease-fire because of continuing Soviet and
 Afghan military pressure, supply problems, and hard-
 ships suffered by unprepared civilians. By late 1982.
 guerrilla leaders may have recognized that their
 forces could not militarily dislodge the strong Afghan
 and Soviet garrisons in the valley. Moreover, continu-
 ing Soviet and Afghan air and ground attacks made it
 difficult to rebuild and resupply guerrilla units that
 had suffered losses in 1982. We believe the insurgents
 recognized that without efforts to improve conditions
 among the valley population, civilians might begin to
 withhold support for the resistance. The leadership
 probably judged that improvements could best be
 achieved during a cease-fire

 Since January 1983, the insurgents have used the
 truce to improve their military position in and outside
 the Panjsher. Masood has increased his influence in
 the northeast, which was already growing before the
 Crops have been replanted, and efforts are
 being made to stockpile food. More effective propa-
 ganda efforts have been organized, and Masood, using
 the concept of a "holy war" to maintain popular
 support, has warned civilians the war will be a long
 one with many hardships and sacrifices

 trol of the strategic Andarab Valley from Hizbi
 Islami forces who had used the area to block caravans
 from reaching the Panjsher.
 Soviet Motives. We believe that the Soviets entered
 into the cease-fire with the guerrillas to reduce insur-
 gent activity around the Panjsher, particularly near
 Kabul, and over the long    . to weaken and divide

 Soviets believed that a cease-fire with the famous and
 respected Panjsher insurgents would encourage other
 guerrilla groups in the country to reach similar agree-
 ments. They probably hoped that they could use such
 cease-fires to stimulate fighting among guerrilla
 bands throughout Afghanistan, reversing the trend of
 cooperation between bands that has led to increased
 insurgent military effectiveness
 the Soviets may even have hoped
 that they could eventually entice Masood into collabo-
 ratin with them and perhaps join a coalition govern-
 ment
 Our analysis indicates, however, that Soviet attempts
 to use the Panjsher cease-fire to weaken and divide
 the resistance movement have not been effective so
 far. We know of no cease-fires between the Soviets
 and other major insurgent groups.
 overall level of insurgent infighting had declined
 significantly in 1983 compared to a similar period in
 1982. Although some fundamentalist groups have
 been critical of the Panjsher cease-fire,
 most insurgent groups and lead-
 ers have not criticized Masood's agreement with the
 Soviets.

 We judge that the cease-fire has not yet resulted in a
 significant strengthening of the Soviet military posi-

 an elite, Soviet-
 trained Afghan brigade withdrawn from the Panjsher
 suffered what the Afghan Ministry of Defense called
 the worst defeat of the war during fighting in May
 1983 in Paktia Province. Another Afghan unit that
 was redeployed from the Panjsher apparently failed to

 Prospects and Implications
 We believe that Masood will seek to extend the cease-

 the cease-fire will
 allow the Panjsheris to continue to build up their
 forces, infiltrate more weapons and supplies, and take
 measures to protect civilians. Using the valley as a
 sanctuary allows Masood to continue attacks else-
 where and maintain efforts to expand his influence
 among other insurgents.
 We believe Masood currently lacks the ability as well
 as the desire to enforce a cease-fire in areas outside
 the Panjsher.
 he has not tried to extend the cease-fire outside the
 valley. Even if he attempted such an effort, other
 groups not party to the agreement would continue
 attacks, although the overall level of combat in the
 northeast probably would decline. In our view, even
 groups allied with Masood outside the Panjsher prob-
 ably would eventually renew attacks on Soviet and
 Afghan targets.
 International press coverage has drawn world atten-
 tion to the war in the Panjsher Valley, and a lengthy
 truce in the area could eventually reduce foreign
 support for the resistance movement. We believe the
 Soviets would cite the truce to foreign critics as
 evidence that the insurgents had accepted a Commu-
 nist government.
 Defections and Bribes
 In addition to their military efforts to destroy the
 resistance, the Soviets and the Afghan Government
 have made extensive efforts to buy the loyalty of
 tribes and encourage insurgent groups to defect to the
 government.
 Afghan officials report-
 edly have offered money and weapons in return for
 the insurgents' promise to stop attacks.
 Kabul has also sought to buy the
 loyalty of tribes and then use them to block insurgen
 supply routes or guard government facilities in re-
 mote areas.
 Efforts to bribe or induce insurgent defections, how-
 ever, apparently have had only limited success so far.
 many guerrilla bands have followed the tra i-
 tional Afghan response to such efforts-accepting
 government positions, money, and arms only to rejoin
 the resistance later on. Government efforts to gain the
 loyalty of tribes have been undermined by the tradi-
 tional rural Afghan distrust of any central authority
 and, since the revolution and invasion', hostility to-
 ward the anti-Islamic Communist regime kept in
 power by a foreign army.

 Given these possible gains, we believe Moscow in the
 short term will tolerate limited attacks by Panjsher
 insurgents outside the valley. In our view, however,
 the Soviets will be impelled eventually to resume
 major operations against Masood's forces in response
 to the continuing buildup of his military capability
 and the likelihood that his forces will launch extensive
 attacks beyond the Panjsher. A massive Soviet and
 Afghan attack similar to the one in May 1982 would
 result in occupation of the main valley floor and
 blocking some supply routes, according to our analy-
 sis, but the insurgent organization in the Panjsher
 The guerrillas will be able to continue effective
 military operations, in our view, because of resupply
 efforts during the cease-fire. The Soviets are aware of
 the resupply but have been unable to significantly
 reduce infiltration into the valley)
 Because of these preparations, we believe the insur-
 gents are not only likely to survive, but that there is a
 good possibility that Masood's organization will con-
 tinue to expand and eventually become the predomi-
 nant insurgent group in northeastern Afghanistan.
 We judge that the development of additional insur-
 gent strongholds under Masood's command in the
 northeast would pose a significantly increased danger
 to Soviet and Afghan forces by threatening to cut
 supply lines and temporarily isolate Soviet and
 Afghan Government units.
 continuing
 ethnic, religious, and political differences among the
 hundreds of insurgent bands make it unlikely that any
 insurgent commander will emerge as a national leader
 in the foreseeable future.
 Building and operating a large number of effective
 strongholds would depend greatly on increasing out-
 side material support to the Panjsher insurgent orga-
 nization. Increased supplies of ammunition, heavy
 machineguns, mortars, and mines would help the
 insurgents train and arm the men in the bases that
 would be used to cut key Soviet supply lines-
 especially the Termez to Kabul road and the Soviet
 fuel pipeline-for long periods
 The Panjsher insurgents will face some dangers and
 problems in attempting to consolidate control even in
 northeastern Afghanistan, in our judgment. Some
 major insurgent bands would become hostile toward
 the Panjsher group's expanding hegemony, resulting
 large-scale battles, resulting in heavy insurgent losses.

 in more clashes between insurgent bands. The Soviets
 and Afghans could exploit any animosity by providing
 some groups with military aid to attack the Panjsher
 insurgents. With the increase in manpower and con-
 trol over a wider area, Masood and his subordinates                                          25X1
 Consolidation of military control under a single group
 in the northeast would also raise the risk that a future
 cease-fire agreement between one insurgent group
 and the Soviets could seriously weaken the resistance
 movement. With command over most insurgent
 forces, Masood would be in a strong position to
 enforce a truce that could halt almost all resistance
 military pressure against Soviet and Afghan Govern-
 ment forces in the most important area of the country.
 Such a truce could convince insurgent supporters
 inside ands outside Afghanistan that all resistance was
 likely to end in a short time.
