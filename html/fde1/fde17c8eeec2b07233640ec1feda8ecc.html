THE WEEK IN BRIEF 
PART I 
OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST 
TAIWAN STRAIT SITUATION   Page 1 
The Chinese Communists have deployed sufficient 
ground and air strength into the area opposite Taiwan 
to carry out an invasion of any of the offshore is-
lands. There also continue to be indications of the 
gradual assembling of a naval force immediately north 
of the Matsus, but there is little evidence of any 
naval concentration near the Kinmens. Moscow, through 
its propaganda media, is apparently attempting to 
arouse world-wide apprehension over the possibility 
of large-scale hostilities. Peiping appears to be 
further committing itself to action against the off-
shore islands in its home press coverage. Peiping 
has issued a declaration defining its territorial 
waters as extending 12 miles from a base line drawn 
to include all its coastal islands. There has been 
little free-world press support for Taiwan's claim 
to the islands or for the concept of an American de-
fense of them. 
MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS .

? ......... Page 4 
In Jordan, the sensitive west bank zone has re-
turned to nearly normal activity, although security 
precautions remain in force throughout the country. 
Cairo radio Alas predicted General Shihab will name 
rebel leader Karame as prime minister. Libya is re-
ported to have been offered Soviet aid. The Sudan 
is engaged in trade talks with Communist China, and 
Cairo has resumed press attacks on the Khalil gov-
e ? re ardin  the Nile waters dispute.'

NOTES AND COMMENTS  
USSR 'S SEVEN-YEAR PLAN   Page 1 
The USSR's Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) will appar-
ently be released soon. Public handling of the announce-
ment of the plan details will be intended to :Impress the 
world byaontrasting the high rate of Soviet growth with 
that of the United States. The plan will probably re-
flect an increasingly optimistic view of the rapidity 
with which the Soviet economy can overtake the United 
States in industrial production. Preliminary informa-
tion indicates that growth rates will be higher than 
necessary to conform to Khrushchev's 15-vTar forecasts 
of last November. 
USSR AGREES TO NUCLEAR TEST SUSPENSION TALKS ..... . . 
Premier Khrushchev, in accepting the 31 October 
date set by the West for talks on nuclear test suspen-
sion, warned that the USSR might be forced to resume 
testing if the United States and Great Britain continue 
their testing. This action was designed to reap further 
propaganda gains from the issue and to strengthen the So-
viet bargaining position at the forthcoming talks I 
25X1

25X1 
YUGOSLAV - SOVIET BLOC TRADE RELATIONS   Page 3 
Moscow is continuing its economic harassment of 
Belgrade by refusing to send wheat under their exist-
ing trade agreement. A complete Soviet bloc economic 
boycott of Yugoslavia is unlikely, however, since such 
a course failed in 1948. For the present at least, Mos-
cow apparently prefers to exert pressure on Belgrade in 
other ways, such as sending goods of inferior ?uality 
and delaying deliveries. 
CHINESE COMMUNIST PRESSURE ON HONG KONG   Page 4 
Recent Chinese Communist economic and political 
pressures against Hong Kong have increased doubts 
among colonial officials and informed private circles 
regarding the colony's long-range prospects. By threaten-
ing Hong Kong, Peiping may hope to discourage London from 
supporting American policy in regard to Taiwan, and even-
tually to reduce Hong Kong to a political and economic 
,satellite of the mainland.

CYPRUS   .Page 5 
The tempo of violence has again quickened on Cyprus 
and EOKA's one-month-old "truce" may be over. All Greek 
Cypriots continue to support Makarios in his denunciation 
of the British plan for Cyprus. Turkey has agreed to co-
operate in attempting implementation of the new plan; but 
without Greek-Cypriot cooperation, the attempt will proba-
bly fail. 
25X1 
BRITISH-ICELANDIC FISHERIES DISPUTE   Page 5 
The British-Icelandic fisheries dispute entered a 
new phase on 1 September when Icelanders boarded--and 
then were driven from--a British trawler in an effort 
to enforce a 12-mile territorial limit. The danger of 
serious incidents is increasing. With new compromise 
efforts being made in NATO, there is a possibility that 
Icelandic hostility toward Britain might shift to NATO 
itself.

OUTLOOK FOR FINLAND'S NEW GOVERNMENT   Page 6 
The Finnish Government formed on 29 August by moder-
ate Social Democrat K. A. Fagerholm represents all parties 
except the opposition Social Democrats and the Communist-
front Finnish People's Democratic League (SKDL), which 
emerged from the 6-7 July elections as the country's largest 
single party. Some of the new cabinet's parliamentary sup-
port is Aialfhearted, however, and the government faces dif-
ficult economic problems which may result in its overthrow 25X1 
this winter. 25X1

(PRI). The power already acquired in important unions 
by these leaders may force President-elect Lopez Mateos 
to give some weight to their views in his program when 
he takes office on 1 December. 
PARAGUAYAN UNREST   Page 9 
President Stroessner's dictatorship is faced with a 
new threat to stability, having overcome plotting just 
prior to its second inauguration on 15 August. The re-
gime fears that political repercussions from a general 
strike suppressed on 27 August may be exploited by sub-
versive elements and hamper its recent steps to liberalize 
political conditions. Stroessner has strong military sup-
port, but each crisis offers an opportunity to disgruntled 
key commanders to make a bid for power. 
PRE-ELECTION ASSEMBLY SESSIONS IN PAKISTAN   Page 10 
The tenor of the recently concluded West Pakistan 
provincial assembly session and the present National 
Assembly session, together with the nature of the ef-
forts being made to strengthen the Awami League govern-
ment of East Pakistan, suggests that all three govern-
ments will be able to remain in power until national 
elections are held in February. Stability depends, how-
ever, on the Awami League's ability to prevent the aliena-
tion of support of important individuals in the national 
government.

INDIAN FINANCE MINISTER'S VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES . . . Page 10 
Indian Finance Minister Desai is expected to empha-
size India's need for long-term financial assistance 
during his Washington visit beginning 6 September. India 
recently secured $350,000,000 for its short-term-needs 
from Britain, the United States, West Germany, Japan, Cana-
da, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and De-
velopment. Desai is one of the leading candidates to suc-
ceed Nehru as prime minister, and this is his first trip 
outside India. 
HANOI ATTEMPTS TO REFORM EDUCATION   
North Vietnam has announced a three-year plan for 
education to be inaugurated at the beginning of the 
coming academic year, and propaganda media are discuss-
ing ways to reorganize the private schools and re-educate 
secondary-school teachers. Newspaper articles have criti-
cized teachers' attitudes and political concepts, equating 
them with those expressed by dissident writers and profes-
sors earlier this year. Hanoi probably intends eventually

COMMUNIST SUBVERSIVE GAINS IN LAOS   Page 12 
The Communist-dominated Neo Lao Hak Zat (NLHZ) 
is extending its influence throughout Laos. NLHZ cam-
paigns to penetrate the army and control local adminisi-
trations in the provinces are meeting considerable sue-
cess. Pro-NLHZ sentiment is spreading among the minority 
tribes, which constitute about half the population, and 
among the influential Buddhist clergy. 
KENYA SECRET SOCIETY CAUSING POLICE GROWING CONCERN . . . Page 13 
The Kiama Kia Muingi (KKM)--an African secret society 
in Kenya which is a direct outgrowth of the Mau Mau--
has mushroomed into an organization of perhaps 200,000 
members. The society aims at independence for this Brit-
ish crown colony and plans eventually to uSe violence to 
25X1 oust the 60,000 Europeans. 
PART III 
PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES  
COMMUNIST CHINA'S "GIANT LEAP FORWARD"   Page 1 
The Chinese Communist leaders are firmly committed 
to, their campaign for maximum speed in economic develop-
ment--which Peiping describes as its "giant leap forward." 
They express elation with the results of the campaign in 
the first half of the year. More attention is being paid 
to agriculture, large numbers of small industrial plants 
are being built, and some responsibility for financial, 
industrial, and commercial management has been passed 
from Peiping to lower administrative levels in expecta-
tion that this would increase efficiency. These important 
modifications have been made in China's economic pro-
grams to avoid repetition of the raw material short-
ages, transportation tie-ups, and financial difficul-
ties which followed the relatively modest economic 
speed-up in 1956 and which hampered the economy 
through much of 1957. However, there are signs that 
some of the troubles of 1956 have begun to reappear.

JAPANESE-AMERICAN RELATIONS   Page 6 
During his visit to Washington on 11 and 12 Septem-
ber, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama intends 
to discuss problems connected with revision of the US-
Japanese security treaty, ways to increase Japanese ex-
ports to the United States, economic assistance for South-
east Asia, and relations with Communist China. Prime Min-
ister Kishi believes the visit will be the key to long-
term cooperation and that it will counter charges that 
Tokyo is subservient to the United States on issues  af-
fecting Japanese interests. 
THE COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCE   Page 9 
The Commonwealth Economic Conference opening at 
Montreal on 15 September--the first such full-scale 
meeting since 1952--is likely to show a somewhat dimin-
ished role for Britain and a growing divergence between 
the older and newer Commonwealth countries as to the 
means of overcoming their economic problems. Older mem-
bers such as Canada and Australia are concerned primarily 
about the inadequacy of monetary reserves, while the new-
er, less developed members like India and Ghana insist 
that the immediate problem is the need for stabilizing 
prices of raw materials. Britain is interested in fur-
ther exploring Commonwealth attitudes toward the United 
Kingdom's membership in the proiected ruropean free 
trade area. 
LATIN AMERICAN INTEREST IN A COMMON MARKET   
Latin American exploratory discussions of a "com-
mon market" stem primarily from a desire for accelerated 
industrialization. Political conditions and trade pat-
terns in Latin America are less favorable than in Western 
Europe to integration of the economy. Growing inter-
est in a commonrmarket may, however, foster economic co-
operation among Latin American  countries and some liberar-
zation of trade and payments.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
PART I 
OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST 
TAIWAN STRAIT 
Periodic bombardment of the 
Kinmens by the Chinese Commu-
nists continued during the past 
week but declined in intensity 
during the first days of Septem-
ber. Temporarily, at least, 
Communist shore artillery has 
combined with motor torpedo 
boats in attempts to interdict 
the supply lines to the Kinmens. 
Supplies still are reaching the 
Kinmens, but in Sharply reduced 
volume. 
Chinese,Nationalist mili-
tary officials admit that these 
interdiction efforts have been 
partly successful. Aircraft 
are encountering artillery fire 
immediately on nearing the Kin-
men airstrip, and apparently only 
one per day landed from 29 
August to 4 September. Only two 
of ten LCM's based at Kinmen 
remain in operation, reducing 
Nationalist ability to off-load 
shipping in Liaolo Bay. 
The supply situation of 
Big and Little Kinmen is not 
yet critical. The islands have 
at least a 30-day supply of 
food and possibly considerably 
more. Thus far, supply dumps 
have not been seriously damaged 
by artillery fire, and roads 
throughout the island complex 
are passableo Few, if any, 
supplies have reached the less-
er islands--Tatan, Erhtan, and 
Hutzu--and heavy artillery fire 
has severely damaged many of 
their shelters and installations. 
The Nationalists have not 
yet made an all-out effort to 
resupply the Kinmens. Destroy-
ers have not been used against 
Communist torpedo boats, and 
counterbattery fire has ,not 
SITUATION 
been fully employed against the 
Communist guns on the Weitou 
Peninsula from which fire is 
directed against the Kinmen air-
field and nearby landing beach. 
Air activity in the Taiwan 
Strait area declined during the 
period; no air clashes were re-
ported by,the Nationalists, who 
said, however, that- Communist 
aireraft wore active north of 
,25X1 
25X1 
the Matsus on 2 September .1 
the Communists may have with-
drawn or grounded some of their 
planes for retraining, for de-
fensive reasons, or because of 
the adverse weather. 
There continue to be indi-
cations that a Communist naval 
force gradually has been assem-
bling in the Santu Bay area for 
the past month. 
25X1 
The Nationalists have re-
ported successes in engagements 
with the Communist Navy. During 
the early morning hours on 1 
September, batteries on Kinmen 
fired on a Communist flotilla 
and claimed titres gunboats

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
commentaries appear further to 
commit the regime publicly to 
action against the islands. 
The Chinese Communists are 
using the 31 August Pravda state-
ment to imply a Soviet commit-
ment to become militarily in-
volved in the event of TIS in-
volvement, 
Pravda's warning on 31 Au-
gust that the USSR will give the 
Chinese People's Republic the 
"necessary moral and material 
help in its just struggle" goes 
well beyond Soviet statements 
during the 1954 Taiwan Strait 
crisis, but the article stopped 
short of committing the USSR to 
military action in the event of 
an outbreak involving American 
forces. 
Moscow's immediate aims 
probably ,:are. tcidiscourage 
American military counteraction 
in the event of a Chinese Com-
munist attack on Nationalist-
held territory and to arouse 
world-wide apprehension over the 
possibility of large-scale hos-
tilities. 
An Izvestia article, dis-
tributed By Moscow TASS to Eu-
rope on 3 September, contained 
Moscow's first reference to the 
Sino-Soviet alliance, but with-
out citing any details of Soviet 
obligations under the treaty. 
It said: "The Soviet Union, 
tied to the Chinese People''S 
Republic by bonds of their in-
violable fraternal alliances, 
fully supports this just strug-
gle. This should never be for-
gotten by the US imperialists, 
whose brink-of-war policy has 
led to a series of complete 
failUres." 
World Reactions  
Official and press opinion 
in a number of European and 
Asian countries is that Commu-
nist China is engaged in a po-
litical maneuver to demonstrate 
its strength and importance And 
that it is not prepared to risk 
World War III. There is no 
significant body of comment, 
except from countries closely 
associated with the Sino-Soviet 
bloc, that assumes the United 
States would risk World War III 
to ensure Taiwan's continued 
control of the offshore islands. 
Very little sympathy is expressed 
for Taiwan's claim to the is- ' 
lands, and, except in South 
Korea and South Vietnam, free-
world opinion does not support 
the concept of an American de-
fense of the islands. 
Heavy British press com-
ment points to serious diffi-
culties for the Macmillan gov-
ernment should the United States 
beacons' involved in the hostili-
ties. Many papers have editori-
ally attacked America's China 
policy, and the government pub-
licly continues to regard the 
offshore islands as Chinese Com-
Munitt? vbelrritory. 
The , Japanese Government 
likewise feels that it will be 
Ina,.diffIcUlt position if 
the United States intervenes 
militarily, and in this event 
would probably not take a posi-
tion helpfuli to ,the United  
States.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY, SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
MIDDLE EAST 
Jordan 
The air of expectancy 
which has pervaded Jordan for 
the past six weeks has dissi-
pated somewhat as a result of 
the continued presence of Brit-
ish troops and the absence of 
serious rioting or coup at-
tempts. While stringent se-
curity measures remain in force 
throughout the country, the 
population of West Jordan is 
reported to have returned to 
normal activity, and the refu-
gee? camps, always a potential 
source of disorder, appear to 
have relapsed into their usual 
apathy. The economic situation, 
which two weeks ago seemed ex-
tremely dangerous, has improved 
with the partial opening of 
traffic routes to Syria and 
Lebanon and with increased sup-
plies of petroleum products. 
Lebanon  
Divisions within the Leb-
anese rebel leadership have come 
increasingly into the open as 
the rebels remain uncert in of 
their future strategy and tac-
tics. A number of rebel leaders 
want a return to normal condi-
tions and a gradual end of the 
rebel-maintained strike so that 
the transition from Chamoun to 
Shihab can be eased. Others, 
however, feel that the fruits 
of the "revolution" are within 
easy reach if some slight addi-
tional effort is made and that 
compromise in the traditional 
Lebanese manner is unnecessary. 
The most serious incident of 
bickering among the factions 
this week was the seizure of 
one faction's radio transmitter, 
located in the Basta quarter of 
Beirut, by a band of adherents 
of another rebel group, The 
less extreme group of rebel 
leaders appears at the moment 
to have the upper hand. 
DEVELOPMENTS 
Cairo radio has predicted 
that General Shihab will ask 
Tripoli rebel leader Rashid' 
Karame to be prime minister. 
Shihab himself has said he con-
templates attempting to rule 
for at least six Months with 
? "emergency powers." During this 
period Parliament would be in 
abeyance, and the cabinet would 
be composed of relatively little-
known moderates. Rebel pressure 
makes it doubtful that Shihab 
will feel strong enough.tO carry 
out such a program. Parliament 
is scheduled to reconvene on 21 
October, and the rebels almost 
certainly will press for new 
elections. 
Iraq 
The specifically anti-Amer-
ican tone of the press and radio, 
as well as a hostile public at-
titude toward Westerners, con-
tinues in Baghdad. This is com-
plemented by vigorous activity 25X1 
by the newly re-established So-
viet Embassy. 
the Iraqis are negotiat-
ng for "financial assistance" 25X1 
--probably financial advice rath-
er than money--with the USSR as 
well as with the UAR. 
A disruptive element ap-
parently will return to Iraq, 
since the government has given 
permission for Mustafa Barzani, 
dissident Kurdish nationalist 
leader, to come back from his 
long refuge in the Soviet Union. 
Baghdad radio broadcast an al-
leged letter from Barzani to the 
government asking it to inter-
cede with Soviet bloc authori-
ties to permit him to tome home. 
His presence in Iraq is likely 
to create concern in Turkey and 
Iran, which have significant 
Kurdish minorities in areas near 
the Soviet border.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
Libya 
Libya has received a broad 
offer of ecOnokid aid from the 
USSR. While Libyan Prime Min-
ister Kubadt, already nervous 
about Egyptian influence, fears 
that acceptance of i Soviet of-
fer would lead to an influx of 
Soviet technicians, he seems 
equally, if not more, fearful 
that rejection of the offer 
Would be used to strengthen 
pro-Egyptian elementg who claim 
the government is dominated by 
the West. The offer includes 
financing and equipment and as-
sistance for petroleum explora-
tion; finding oil in commercial 
quantities is Libya's one hope 
of developing a viable economy 
to support even the present 
modest bureaucracy and royal 
household, 
Although never officially 
acknowledged by Libya, a Soviet 
offer of two hospitals submitted 
in 1957 is apparently to be im-
plemented, the facilities to be 
built and probably staffed by 
the USSR, possibly on the pat-
tern of the long-established 
Soviet hoSpital in Ethiopia. 
Sudan-UAR  
Khartoum and Cairo have 
resumed their long exchange of 
verbal blowt over the future 
distribution of the Nile waters. 
The Cairo press last week vigor-
outily attacked Prime Minister 
Khglil'S gOirernment for its re-
fusiti to abide by the 1929 Nile 
*aterb Agreekent and for its 
unilateral decision to begin 
withholding *Ater in connection 
with its Sennar Dam project. 
The Nile waters question 
was not a good one from the 
point of view of UAR propaganda, 
since Ithall enjoys popular Su-
Onese sUpport on this question. 
The Sudanese prime minister is 
More vulnerable on such issues 
as his approval of the landing 
of American troops in Lebanon, 
and if Cairo makes an all-out 
attatk on him, it would prob-
ably use this kind of material. 
Meanwhile the Sudan's cot-
ton disposal problems are again 
presaing the government. Trade 
talks with the Chinese Commu-
nists are underway; although 
Khalil has resisted an arrange-
ment with Peiping, the pressure 
of the surplus may lead him to 
weaken, especially if his domes-
tic political position should 
deteriorate further. 
Israel 
The Israeli ArMy apparently 
remains oh a "second-phase" 
alert which has been in force 
titide the Iraqi coup. The pres-
ent series of military maneuvers 
in Israel is scheduled to end 
on 6 Septetber.

NOTES AND COMMENTS  
USSR'S SEVEN-YEAR PLAN 
The USSR's Seven-Year Plan 
(1959-1365) will apparently be 
released soon. Public handling 
of the announcement of the plan 
details will be intended to im-
press the world by contrasting 
the high rate of Soviet growth 
with that of the United States. 
The plan will also apparently 
reflect an increasingly opti-
mistic view of the rapidity 
with which the Soviet economy 
can overtake the United States 
in industrial production. 
The draft of the plan was 
completed on 22 August, accord-
ing to an official announcement, 
seven weeks behind schedule. 
Khrushchev had turned the plan 
back to the State Planning Com-
mission three times for correc-
tion. He reportedly was dis-
satisfied particularly with the 
plans for the chemical and ce-
ment industries. Pravda .re-
ported on 27 August that the 
draft has been discussed at a 
meeting of the Economic Commit-
tee of the Supreme Soviet's 
Council of Nationalities, and 
it presumably will be taken up 
within the next few weeks at a 
Supreme Soviet meeting. Vari-
ous reports have indicated that 
such a meeting will take place 
during September. 
It appears that a brief 
conservative period in Soviet 
economic planning, seen in 
Khrushchev's 15-year forecasts 
and in the annual plans for 
1957 and 1958 which scheduled 
annual industrial growth rates 
of-only 7 percent, has termi-
nated. The Soviet press re-
lease which stated that the plan 
had been completed implied that 
it was designed to advance all 
branches of the economy "so as 
to solve the main economic task 
of catching up with and surpass-
ing the most developed capital-
ist countries in per capita 
production of industrial goods." 
In another statement, a member 
of the USSR Academy of Sciences 
wrote in Pravda on 9 July that 
Soviet industrial output will 
grow at a rate of not less than 
10 percent annually, and that 
the USSR will catch up with 
present US industrial output 
in another seven or eight years. 
The 10-percent growth figure 
was also given by Gosplan of-
ficials to a group of French 
economists visiting Moscow. 
These statements, taken to-
gether with plan targets already 
disclosed, indicate that pro-
duction goals will be higher 
than would have been necessary 
to conform with Khrushchev's 
15-year forecasts given last 
November. In the case of steel, 
for example, targets for 1965 
appear to be 80-90,000,000 metric 
tons as compared with 100-120,-
000,000 tons set by Khrushchev 
to be accomplished in 15 years, 
i.e., by 1972. At the tithe he 
announced the 15-year goals, 
Khrushchev said his targets 
would be subject to change by 
experience, probably in the 
direction of shortening the 
time periods required, and he 
recently stated in a speech at 
Kuybyshev that the USSR must 
gain 10 to 15 years in its eco-
25X1 
nomic race with the West.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
USSR AGREES TO NUCLEAR TEST SUSPENSION TALKS 
Soviet Premier Khrushchev, 
in agreeing to talks on 31 
October on suspension of nu-
clear weapons tests, warned that 
continued American and Brit-
ish testing may force the 
USSR to resume tests. This 
threat may have been designed 
to strengthen the Soviet bar-
gaining position at the talks. 
His statement, contained in the 
29 August Pravda interview, was 
timed to coincide with publica-
tion of the Geneva technical 
talks report. 
The Soviet premier re-
jected the Anglo-American "con-
ditions" for renewing the sus-
pension on a yearly basis. 
He called instead for a ban 
"for all time," with negotia-
tions to be completed "with-
in two or three weeks." 
Khrushchev recalled the 
Supreme Soviet decision of 
31 March 1958 which stated 
that the USSR would be free 
to resume tests if the Western 
nuclear powers failed to fol-
low the Soviet lead in sus-
pending them. Although Khru-
shchev declared that the con-
tinuation of American and 
British tests "relieves the So-
viet Union of the obligation 
it had assumed unilaterally," 
a resumption of tests at this 
time would seriously weaken 
Moscow's propaganda position 
In view of the repeated charges 
of American and British in-
sincerity regarding a test 
suspension. In the Soviet ap-
praisal, however, the secu-
rity implications of con-
tinued US-UK nuclear progress 
could outweigh the negative 
aspects of test resumption 
prior to the 31 October 
meeting. 
The 29 August Pravda state-
ment regarding possible resump-
tion of Soviet testing was ap-
pended to notes sent by Moscow 
to the United States and Brit-
ain the next day. This unusual 
procedure and the pessimistic 
tone of Khrushchev's remarks 
are calculated to demonstrate 
growing Soviet impatience and 
indignation over the West's 
"delaying tactics." 
At the same time, Moscow 
has been promoting its "peace-
ful approach" to nuclear energy 
problems at the second Inter-
national Conference on the 
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy 
at Geneva. Khrushchev's message 
to the conference claimed that, 
had agreement to prohibit nu-
clear weapons been achieved, co-
operation on the utilization of 
nuclear materials for peaceful 
purposes would have been much 
further advanced. 
On 30 August the Soviet 
Union also followed the American 
and British action of declassi-
fying details of research on the 
controlled release of nuclear 
energy from the fusion process. 
According to press statements, 
Western scientists attending the 
meeting are considerably impressed 
with the Soviet research made 
public thus far. An attempt to 
take advantage of the discussions 
on peaceful uses to further the 
Soviet campaign for a permanent 
ban on nuclear tests came during 
the 3 September conference ses-
sion when the head of the Soviet 
delegation attacked, as a polit-
ical device designed to conceal 
American desire to continue nu-
clear weapons tests, the Amer-
ican suggestion that nuclear ex-
plosives could be used for peace-
ful purposes.I

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
YUGOSLAV - SOVIET ,BLOC TRADE RELATIONS 
Recent Soviet stalling on 
the agreement to sell 200,000 
tons of wheat to Belgrade in 
1958--the first confirmed at-
tempt at harassment through 
normal trade channels--follows 
economic pressures initiated 
by the USSR last May with its 
five-year "postponement" of 
$285,000,000 in credits to 
Yugoslavia. Belgrade, although 
now less vulnerable to bloc 
economic sanctions than in 1948, 
when 50 percent of its trade 
was with the bloc, has become 
increasingly involved in re-
cent years, and in 1958 sched-
uled bloc trade is roughly 35 
percent of total Yugoslav 
foreign trade. 
It is unlikely 
that a complete break 
in economic relations 
will occur. Trade 
with the bloc, es-
pecially with the 
more industrialized 
European satellites, 
is mutually advanta-
geous, and both Po-
land and East Germany 
recently increased 
their trade goals 
with Yugoslavia. 
Since the USSR 
is no longer willing 
to trade "machinery 
for prunes," however, 
bloc trade arrange-
ments less advanta-
geous to Yugoslavia are expected. 
Moscow's intentions will be 
clarified this fall and winter 
when present trade agreements 
would normally be renegotiated. 
Moscow probably hesitates to 
impose a total economic block-
ade on Yugoslavia, both because 
of the failure of such a cam-
paign after the 1948 break and 
because of adverse repercussions 
such a move might have on re-
lations with the uncommitted 
countries of Asia and Africa. 
satisfactotily dung the first 
half of 1958. .The first public 
indication of a deliberate 
slowdown appeared in Belgrade's 
Borba on 24 August, which stated 
that the USSR has refused to 
deliver the 200,000 tons of wheat 
provided for in the Yugoslav-
Soviet trade accord. Borba 
ebarged that in addition to 
wheat, Moscow has been remiss 
regarding other goods deliveries. 
The Soviet refusal is ap-
parently intended primarily as 
a political move and does not 
stem from any inability to fur-
nish the grain. Last month,

Loss of Soviet wheat at

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1058 
Withholding shipments of 
coking coal, anthracite or 
petroleum, which account for 
50 percent of total Yugoslav 
imports from the USSR, would 
deal a far more seriOus blow 
to the Yugoslav economy than 
withholding wheat. So far, 
however, no specific complaints 
have been made public regarding 
these commodities. Yugoslav 
wheat imports from the USSR 
represent only about 15 percent 
of total wheat imports. 
Yugoslavia may try to 
orient its trade more to the 
West and increase its efforts 
to find markets in the Middle 
East, Asia, and Africa. The: 
Yugoslav Government has al-
ready announced that an eco-
nomic delegation will go to 
Iraq this month, at which time 
it -will probably sign its first 
trade agreement with that 
Country.

CHINESE COMMUNIST PRESSURE ON HONG KONG 
Recent Chinese Communist 
economic and political pres-
sures against Hong Kong have 
increased doubts among officials 
and informed private circles 
there regarding the colony's 
long-range prospects. This 
attitude contrasts sharply 
with the previous confidence 
that the colony's future was 
secure because of its value to 
Peiping as a major source of 
free-world hard currency. 
Chinese Communist light 
manufactures and textiles, al-
legedly "dumped" on the South-
east Asian and Hong Kong mar-
kets, reportedly are beginning 
to undersell Hong Kong products. 
In the opinion of the Hong 
Kong authorities, local indus-
try has not yet been hard hit, 
but the competition is assum-
ing serious proportions and 
is likely to grow. While they 
believe the greatest danger 
is to the colony's overseas 
markets, they also are con-
cerned over Chinese Communist 
efforts to monopolize control 
of the colony's food supply. 
Hong Kong's fishing opera-
tions have recently been brought 
to a near standstill as there-
suit of Communist seizures of 
fishing boats and the imposi-
tion of heavy fines and con-
fiscation of catches for failure 
of the fishermen to join main-
land cooperatives. The Hong 
Kong government is considering 
naval protection for local 
fishermen operating in inter-
national waters, and the Royal 
Navy is providing daily escort 
for fishing boats to the "outer 
reaches" of the colony's waters. 
Local officials, however, have 
expressed the view that most of 
the Hong Kong fishermen will 
eventually be forced to join 
the Communist cooperatives. 
An increasing Volume of 
propaganda and official protests 
have emphasized Peiping's ada-
mant opposition to the "shel-
tering" of Chinese Nationalist 
"agents" and its claim to be 
the champion of the "rights" 
of the Hong Kong Chinese. The 
Communists have strongly at=. 
tacked efforts by the colonial 
authorities to curb Communist 
subversiold in the local schools. 
25X1 
While Peiping probably 
wants to increase foreign ex. 
change earnings through its . 
trade, its tactics also appear 
to be in line with Peiping's 
long-standing policy of gradual-
ly eroding the Hong Kong govern-
ment's authority and prestige 
through threats, political pres-
sure, and constant agitation. 
By threatening Hong Kong, Pei-
ping also may hope to discourage 
the British from supporting 
American  policy in regard  to 
Taiwan. I (Con- 25X1

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
CYPRUS 
The tempo of violence has 
again quickened on Cyprus with 
four Greek Cypriots and two 
British servicemen being killed 
on 2 September--the largest num-
ber of deaths during a single 
day in Cypriot-British fighting 
since the end of large-scale 
EOKA attacks in March 1957. In 
June, EOKA leader Grivas warned 
that a Briton would die for 
every Cypriot killed by the se-
curity forces. 
In announcing a truce on 
4 August, Grivas reserved the 
right to renew operations if 
"provocations" continued, and 
the recent security operations 
may be considered sufficient 
provocation. EOKA will be re-
luctant, however, to launch 
simultaneous attacks on the 
Turkish community and thus face 
a "war" on two fronts. 
Despite continued violence 
between right- and left-wing 
Greek Cypriots, all members of 
the community continue, in the 
fight for self-determination, 
to manifest loyalty to Arch-
bishop Makarios who, on 28 Au-
gust, caustically denounced the 
British and their new plan for 
Cyprus. Makarios has again 
called for UN intervention to 
"restore peace" on the island. 
Evidence is accumulating that 
both Makarios and the Greek 
Government are about to mount 
a new campaign for A UN trustee-
ship for Cyprus. Meanwhile 
there are indications that EOKA 
leader Grivas is increasingly 
dissatisfied with the "indeci-
sive" leadership of Makarios 
and the government of Greece, 
thus lessening their potential 
capability for restraining EOKA 
violence. 
Turkey's willingness to 
cooperate with Britain in im-
plementing the new plan for 
Cyprus limits London's ability 
to make further concessions to 
secure Greek acceptance. While 
Britain, with Turkish coopera-
tion, may attempt to impose its 
plan, it is unlikely to be suc-
cessful in the face of massive 
Greek-Cypriot opposition. 
Until the exiled Makarios 
is permitted to return to Cyprus, 
the British apparently will have 
to continue to rule the island 
by force. While his return 
would not guarantee peace, it 
probably would restrain the ex-
tremists, whose acts could other-
wise lead to his deportation 
again. 
BRITISH-ICELANDIC FISHERIES DISPUTE 
The British-Icelandic fish-
eries dispute entered a new 
phase on 1 Septembet when Ice-
landic coastguardsmen boarded 
a British trawler within the 
new 12-mile territorial limit. 
They were forcibly removed by 
a British frigate, and the Ice-
landic patrol boat has refused 
to take them back. The danger 
of serious incidents is increas-
ing. 
Neither the British nor the 
Icelanders appear willing to 
compromise their respective posi-
tions in principle. British 
willingness to refrain from pro-
tecting British trawlers in the 
inner six miles foundered on 
Iceland's unwillingness to re-
frain from arresting British 
fishermen outside the original 
four-mile limit. The Icelandic

The Finnish Government 
formed on 29 August by moder-
ate Social Democrat K. A. 
Fagerholm represents all par-
ties except the opposition 
Social Democrats and the Com-
munist-front Finnish People's 
Democratic League (SKDL), which 
emerged from the 6-7 July elec-
tions as the country's largest 
single party. Some of the new 
cabinet's parliamentary support 
is halfhearted, however, and 
the government faces difficult 
economic problems which may 
result in its over-
throw this winter. 
The government 
in particular will 
have to cope with 
the problem of un-
employment; a post-
war high is expect-
ed to be reached 
this winter. About 
16,000 were unem-
ployed on 15 August, 
compared with 3,000 
the previous year. 
The need to curtail 
200 SEATS 
any meeting which would not 
recognize Iceland's unilateral 
extension of territorial waters 
to the 12-mile limit. It seems 
more likely that Iceland may 
demand that the NAC consider 
British "aggression" against 
Iceland, and also raise the 
subject at the meeting of the 
UN General Assembly later this 
month. 
There is a possibility that 
the hostility felt toward the 
British could easily be shifted 
against NATO itself and against 
its US-manned bases in Iceland, 
if the inflammable and chauvin-
ist public feels NATO is on 
the side of the British.

MEXICAN LABOR 
Last week's labor and stu-
dent riots in Mexico City were 
probably brought about by dis-
sident, leftist labor leaders 
who are determined to gain 
stronger influence in the gov-
erning Party of Revolutionary 
Institutions (PRI). The power 
already acquired in important 
unions by these leaders may 
force President-elect Lopez 
Mateos to give some weight to 
their views in his program when 
he takes office on 1 December. 
President Ruiz Cortines did 
not act decisively against the 
rioters, and his reluctance ear-
lier this year to deal firmly 
with serious wildcat strikes 
has given the initiative to the 
men challenging the established 
PRI union leaders. I

Control of the labor move-

politically motivated union

them a fair share in Mexico's

dissatisfaction, staging strikes 
which paralyzed schools, rail-

acceded to the student demands. 
Many of the newly powerful 
leaders are Marxists, although 
they do not belong openly to 
PARAGUAYAN 
President Stroessner's 
dictatorship is faced with a 
new threat to stability, having 
overcome plotting just prior to 
its second inauguration on 15 
August. It fears that politi-
cal repercussions from a general 
strike suppressed on 27 August 
may be exploited by subversive 
elements and hamper its recent 
steps to liberalize political 
conditions. Public sentiment 
stongly favors labor's efforts 
to improve its substandard liv-
ing conditions. 
The government refused to 
concede to labor's demand for 
a 29-percent increase in mini-
mum wages, citing its fear of 
inflation and damage to the 
year-old stabilization program 
drafted by the International 
Monetary Fund. Under this, liv-
ing costs and the exchange rate 
have remained steady, and Para-
guay agreed not to raise wages 
by more than 5 percent over the 
rise in living costs. Labor, 
however, appears unusually de-
termined to attain its objec-
tive, and the General Confed-
eration of Workers (CPT) re-
jected a pre-strike offer of 5 
percent. 
About half the workers 
returned to work immediately 
after the government's prompt 
repressive measures, including 
the arrest of labor leaders and 
seizure of the CPT. Some 700 
workers took refuge in a Cath-
olic school compound, where 
they were joined by Father 
Talavera, whose public attack 
Mexico's legal Communist party. 
Lopez Mateos, who was a strong 
minister of labor in the outgoing 
administration, *ill, probably try 
to channel their demands into a 
program patterned on Mexico's 
own socio-economic revolution 
of 1910. 
UNREST 
on the regime for failing to im-
prove the welfare of the people 
attracted widespread approval 
last February. The workers, 
however, were persuaded to leave 
the school compound by the clergy 
after the government obtained a 
court order for their eviction. 
The Chamber of Deputies has taken 
the unprecedented action of pro-
testing the temporary arrest of 
the CPT president. 
The foreign minister has 
stated privately that the strike 
is political rather than eco.4 
nomic,and is basically Communist-
inspired, although Other oppo-
sition parties have since taken 
advantage of the situation.

The major opposition Lib-
eral party faces a dilemma re-
garding the strike, wanting to 
take advantage of it but not 
wanting to jeopardize its newly 
granted freedom for increased 
political actiVity. Exiled ele-
ments of both the Liberal and 
Febrerista parties, however, 
have consistently advocated re-
sistance and revolution. The 
armed forces, backbone of the 
regime, strongly support President 
Stroessner and endorse his lib-
eralization moves. Each crisis, 
however, offers an opportunity 
to any disgruntled key military 
commander to make a bid for power.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
PRE-ELECTION ASSEMBLY SESSIONS IN PAKISTAN 
The tenor of the recently 
concluded West Pakistan proviD6-
cial assembly seseion and: the 
present National Assembly ses-
sion, together with the nature 
of the efforts being made to 
strengthen the Awami League gov-
ernment of East Pakistan, sug-
gests that all three governments 
will be able to remain in power 
until national elections are 
held in February. Stability 
depends, however, on the Awami 
League's ability to prevent the 
alienation of support of impor-
tant individuals in the national 
government. 
In the current National As-
sembly session, which began on 
1 September, and in the West 
Pakistan provincial assembly 
session which concluded on 28 
August, the opposition has con-
centrated on establishing cam-
paign issues for the national 
elections rather than on efforts 
to overthrow the government. 
The opposition Moslem League and 
the National Awami party will 
probably continue to attack the 
government's policies, including 
its pro-Western foreign policy 
and its politically unpopular 
repression recently of would-be 
marchers on Indian-held Kashmir. 
Investigation of political cor-
ruption will probably also be 
demanded. 
During the West Pakistan 
assembly session from 25 to 28 
August, the Moslem League and 
other opposition parties were 
unable to offer any serious 
threat to the Republican party 
government in that province. 
However, the situation in East 
Pakistan, where the Awami League 
government was restored on 26 
August following a period of 
President's Rule, appears less 
stable. The outcome of the pro-
vincial assembly session ex-
pected to begin there about the 
third week in September is un-
certain. The Amami League gov-
ernment apparently does not yet 
have a firm commitment of sup-
port from the National Awami 
party and is bargaining for sup-
port from its own principal 
rival, the Krishak Sramik party 
(KSP). At the same time, it 
has not filled about eight pro-
vincial cabinet posts, apparent-
ly using this to attract support 
away from the KSP, which has 
almost equal strength at present 
in the provincial assembly. 
The Awami League, which 
previously has supported the 
national government from outside 
the national cabinet, is now 
also attempting to get a number 
of seats in the cabinet in order 
to increase its prestige and 
attract needed support in East 
Pakistan. If key leaders in 
the national cabinet are ousted 
and thereby alienated by this 
maneuver, however, serious in-
stability in the national gov-
ernment could result. 1

in Communist states. The Com-
munist regime has approximately 
doubled the number of students 
enrolled in academic high 
schools,: now given at 13,000, 
but has not been able to main-
tain the, quality of the French 
schools. 
The private schools are 
permitted a certain degree of 
freedom, particularly in de-
ciding whom they admit; and al-
though they must teach the 
standard state curricula, few 
of the teachers are party mem-
bers. Some of the schools are 
operated by the Catholic Church 
and still give religious in-
struction after school. 
It is not clear why the 
Hanoi government has not na-
tionalized at least the private 
high schools unless it has wished 
to avoid the,expense of their 
operation. In the present dis-
cussions, these institutions 
are called on to improve their 
organization, increase their 
teachers'salaries, and raise 
the level of their political 
indoctrination work. 
The state-operated schools 
in the provinces do not escape 
attack, which has been partic,-, 
ularly sharp in recent weeks. 
The large Hung Vuong school in 
Phu Tho Province, with a stu-
dent,,body comprising 10 percent 
of all academic secondary stu-
dents, has been accused of ne-
glecting the political indoctri-
nation of its pupils. Even 
Hteachers who are party members 
at Hung VuOng are quoted as say-
ing they have no time to teach 
politics, and some are described 
as listening to nonbloc radio-
broadcasts because they believed 
"intellectuals should hear both 
sides of a question." 
The situation is decribed 
as being even worse in other pub-
lic sbhools. The Lam Son school 
In Thanh Hoa Province reputedly 
harbors a group of teachers loy-
al to university professors fired 
last spring for demanding greater 
intellectual freedom. Students 
there 'hat'e . ,been told that 
"outmoded Communism will be re-
placed by a better doctrine";? 
and party cadres are compared to 
,the boor in MoliSre's Le Bour-
geoit Gentilhomme who wantedto 
be a gentleman wlaile remaining 
illiterate. One teacher, when 
reprimanded, is said to have 
warned his director to "rook out 
for another. Hungarian uprising." 
The regime opened a six-
week political indoctrination 
course for all secondary-school 
teachers which was to end on 2 
September. Until Hanoi has 
trained loy 1 new cadres, how-
ever, or unless it takes drastic 
steps against present instruc-
tors, the schools will continue 
to employ some teachers who 
oppose the system. To date the 
North Vietnamese intelligentsia 
has proved its ability to with-
stand regime efforts to erad-
icate dissent.

society aims at independence 
for this British crown colony 
and plans to use violence to 
oust the 60,000 Europeans. 
the society was officially 
outlawed in January 1958. 
Communist elements in Laos 
have for years proselytized 
among the tribal minorities, 
which together comprise about  
half the total population.

chief Souphannouvong has 
achieved considerable success 
in his pose as patron of the

ning to establish consumer co-
operatives and river and land 
transport associations. 
The over-all trend of 
growing Communist influence in 
almost every sector of Lao-
tian society has been fa-
cilitated by the lack of 
effective government leader-
ship. The NLHZ's energetic 
and well-planned efforts to 
marshal support in the prov-
inces, looking toward the 
national elections next year, 
have been in marked con-
trast to the indifference

PART III 
PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES 
COMMUNIST CHINA'S "GIANT LEAP FORWARD" 
The Chinese Communist lead-
ers are firmly committed to the 
current mass campaign for max-
imum speed in economic develop-
ment--which Peiping describes 
as its "giant leap forward." 
They express elation with the 
results of the campaign in the 
first half of the year and say 
it will be continued. More at-
tention is being paid to agri-
culture, large numbers of small 
industrial plants are being 
built, and some responsibility 
for financial, industrial, and 
commercial management has been 
passed from Peiping to lower 
administrative levels in expec-
tation that this would increase 
efficiency. 
These important modifica-
tions have been made in China's 
economic programs to avoid rep-
etition of the troubles which 
followed the relatively modest 
economic speed-up in 1956 and 
which hampered the economy 
throughout much of 1957. How-
ever, there are signs that some 
of the troubles which beset 
Peiping in 1956 have begun to 
reappear. 
Development of the Campaign  
Liu Shao-chi, Mao's chief 
lieutenant and a leading expo-
nent of the "leap forward" cam-
paign,traces it to the launch-
ing of the "rectification" 
drive in the spring of 1957. 
Beginning in September 1957, 
various of Mao's lieutenants 
spoke publicly in favor of a 
more rapidly paced economic de-
velopment, and the "leap" ap-
pears to have crystallized dur-
ing December. In its early 
stages, it was marked by exhor-
tations to overtake Great Brit-
ain in certain industrial fields 
in 15 years or so. Recent ref-
erences claim the job can be 
done much sooner. 
By the spring of 1958 the 
campaign had spread to all eco-
nomic fronts. Little was said 
about its life expectancy, but 
by the time the party congress 
met in May, the leadership had 
apparently decided it would be 
a continuing feature of China's 
economy. Liu Shao-chi told 
the )congress there would 
be "one forward leap after 
another." Tan Chen-lin, the 
party's leading spokesman on 
agriculture, said a "still 
greater forward leap can be ex-
pected in China's agricultural 
output next year and the year 
after." 
Even as the "leap" was 
getting under way late last 
year, Liu Shao-chi noted that 
"some people" doubted the wisdom 
of such a course, and the offi-
cial People's Daily perceived 
an "undercurrerarl-Wf "anxiety 
and worry." The opposition to 
the plan persists, and is pic-
tured as hoping that the re-
sults at year's end will prove 
it right. Convinced that the 
program is "too impetuous," 
these elements cite the troubles 
brought on by the relatively 
modest acceleration of 1956. 
In that year, raw material short-
ages, transportation tie-ups, 
and financial difficulties ham-
pered the economy through much 
of the following year. 
Policy Reforms  
The leadership argues that 
the 1956 setbacks were offset 
by the year's achievements and 
that policy changes made since 
that time will ensure against 
a recurrence. Peiping has ac-
knowledged the pressing need 
above all to speed up agri-
cultural development and, to 
this end, has sharply increased 
investments in money and man-
power. Secondly, it has taken

is a program to build large 
numbers of small-and medium-
size plants "like stars in the 
sky" throughout the countryside. 
As Liu Shao-chi observed, "It 
is only when all central and 
local authorities get going at 
it, only when there is a divi-
sion of labor and cooperation 
among big, small, and medium-
size enterprises, that we can 
achieve greater, faster, better, 
and more economical results." 
The decision to make such 
reforms appears to have been 
made last fall, along with the 
decision to press ahead more 
rapidly. The decentralization 
of financial, industrial, and 
commercial activity can be 
traced to the third plenary 
session of the party's central 
committee last October. Chen 
Yun, believed to be a principal 
architect of the program, gave 
a report on this topic, the de-
tails of which have not been 
released. As a result of this 
meeting, Peiping made public in 
November a series of regulations 
which defined the decentrali-
zation process.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
The decentralization and 
attendant programs featuring 
agriculture and small rural 
plants necessitated modifica-
tions in the planning mechanism. 
First of all, the process was 
simplified and the range of tar-
gets sent out from the center 
was narrowed. But of more im-
portance was the launching of 
a new planning system, called 
by Peiping "a Chinese creation." 
Under it, the planning author-
ities in Peiping draft relative-
ly reasonable goals which must 
be achieved. These become the 
central government's "first ac-
count" goals. They are then 
sent down to the provincial 
planning authorities, who, 
drawing on a more detailed and 
comprehensive knowledge of lo-
cal resources, draft an "ex-
panded" version of these goals. 
The sum of all these ex-
panded provincial plans becomes 
the central government's "sec-
ond account" goals. It is to 
this account that targets pub-
licized in connection with the 
"leap" refer. The same process 
occurs once again when the pro-
vincial authorities transmit 
their goals to the next lower 
level. 
Small Plants 
As a result of the programto 
build many small- and medium-size 
plants, China in effect has two 
industrialization programs pro-
ceeding side by side. The first 
and more important one involves 
the central government's key 
projects and continues at least 
at the pace achieved in the past. 
The second concerns the construc-
tion of small locally built and 
operated plants, lately grafted 
on to the first program. 
These plants will serve to 
support agriculture by providing 
simple machinery, fuels and 
electric power to run the ma-
chines, and chemical fertilizer. 
The plants' contribution 
to national output will be 
considerable; while the qual-
ity of their output will be 
uneven and not impressive in 
terms of a modern industrial 
economy, it will be good enough 
for the backward Chinese coun-
tryside. 
The central government in 
Peiping has established the 
guide lines for the program 
and has drawn up blueprints 
for the plants. Pilot plants 
have been set up near Peiping 
tO which technicians from the 
interested localities can come 
for training and experience. 
Peiping also has urged the big 
established enterprises to pro-
vide the smaller new ones with 
technical and other help. This 
assistance has come sometimes 
from individual plants and 
sometimes from an existing in-
dustrial center. 
Shanghai, for example, has 
not only launched a program of 
investing in small plants in 
neighboring provinces but has 
agreed to supply the necessary 
blueprints, to send technicians, 
and to train students from near-
by areas. In a number of in-
stances these small plants will 
probably serve as satellite sub-
contractors of the larger ones, 
in line with a pattern which 
persists in Japan. 
Economic Decentralization 
Along with the creation of 
a myriad of small producers, 
Peiping has provided for the 
transfer of managerial respon-
sibility in industrial and com-
mercial enterprises from the 
central to the local govern-
ments. When the November 1957 
regulations were issued, Pei-
ping pointed out that the devo-
lution of authority would apply 
to only a limited range of enter-
prises, chiefly in light indus-
try. Most of the major heavy 
Industries, including all de-
fense industries, were to re-
main firmly under central 
control.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
In April of this 
year, however, it was 
apparently decided 
that all enterprises 
would be involved 
"except some special, 
key enterprises, or 
enterprises of an ex-
perimental nature." 
Peiping reported in 
June that responsi-
bility for some 80 
percent of the total 
number of enterprises 
under the central in-
dustrial ministries 
had been shifted to 
the provincial gov-
ernments. The chances 
are, however, that 
the large industrial 
combines, like the 
Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, 
and most defense industry and 
other "special" enterprises 
will not be transferred. 
4 September 1958 
SMALL POWER STATION IN SHANTUNG PROVIENCE 
Even in the case of the 
plants transferred, the central 
government retains a strong 
voice in the operation of the 
more important plants through 
its functions in planning and 
inspection. Only the day-to-
day management has been handed 
over. 
Much of the small local 
industry will probably come un-
der the control of the new "peo-
ple's communes" which the re-
gime has recently begun to pop-
ularize as the coming "basic 
social unit" in China. These 
communes in some cases will be 
quite large. Peiping has indi-
cated that membership will 
range from 5,000 to 10,000 
households. They will have 
departments in charge of indus-
try, agriculture, commerce, 
transport, culture, and militia 
and will thus virtually displace 
the present echelons of govern-
ment below the county level. 
Cautious as the regime has 
been in loosening the strings 
of management of the nation's 
industry and commerce, it has 
been even more careful in regard 
to the nation's purse strings. 
The first moves toward assign-
ing more local responsibility 
in financial matters were taken 
last November. Regulations pub-
lished in June serve to increase 
the local governments' share in 
some taxes and open up addi-
tional sources of income. They 
now have the authority to issue 
local construction bonds, ex-
clusive claim on seven types of 
taxes and a partial claim on 
four more, the right to levy 
local surtaxes, and a 20-percent 
share in the earnings of enter-
prises located in their area. 
However, the regulations 
also provide that all local 
budgets must be forwarded to 
the Ministry of Finance for 
"inspection, review, and neces-
sary changes." Moreover, local 
extrabudgetary income, which 
previously had sometimes es-
caped the central authorities, 
will be brought into the local 
budgets and thus will come un-
der Peiping's purview. 
More recently, the central 
government has issued regula-
tions designed to improve the 
"management of investment funds 
"Full powers" in this field 
are delegated to the organs 
directly in charge of the con-
struction projects. These are

allocate funds, and readjust 
their work so long as there is 
no reduction in planned capacity 
of the project involved, no de-
lay in delivery, no excess costs, 
and no increase in nonproductive 
spending. 
Political Implications 
The achievements of the 
first half of the year--record 
levels of industrial growth 
and unprecedented early har-
vests--are clearly viewed by 
the leadership as vindicating 
its "giant leap forward" policy. 
The People's Daily took the 
view that the achievementswere 
so great that it was not neces-
sary to wait for the returns 
of the second half of the year, 
especially since the gains thus 
far are but a "prelude" to even 
greater gains in the future. 
The paper gloated over the rout 
of the "gloomy clique" which 
had hoped to "settle accounts" 
after the fall harvest. 
Recent references to op-
posing elements have, in fact, 
shown an increasing harshness. 
So far no individual has been 
identified as being a member 
of the "gloomy clique," and it 
is doubtful that any of the 
top leaders are members. Mao 
has been frequently and strongly 
linked to the "leap." Liu Shao-
chi and his chief lieutenants, 
especially Teng Hsiao-ping and 
Tan Chen-lin, were early and 
dedicated advocates. 
Chou En-lai has been asso-
ciated with it since early 1958, 
and is being given credit for 
an earlier advocacy. Chen Yun, 
the regime's ranking 
economist, has not 
publicly associated 
himself with the 
"leap" as such but 
has been connected 
with the policy re-
forms which are an 
integral part of the 
program. A few other 
politburo members have 
either failed to get 
on the bandwagon or 
have climbed aboard 
late in the day, but 
all of them seem to 
be in good standing. 
BLACKSMITHS' COOPERATIVE IN SHANSI PROVINCE 
Although there 
is an outside chance 
that one or another 
politburo member will 
be brought down, the 
better candidates for 
the "gloomy clique', 
are at lower levels 
of power. For ex-
ample, Teng Tzu-hui, 
director of the par-
ty's rural work de-
partment, opposed Mao 
Tse-tung's speed-up of 
agricultural sociali-
zation in 1955-56 and 
has since been dis-
placed as the party's

leading spokesman on agriculture. 
Moreover, Teng's 1957 position 
on limiting the size of coopera-
tives has been overturned by 
the Mao-inspired program of merg-
ing cooperatives into "people's 
communes." There are a few oth-
er possibilities among the di-
rectors of the party's central 
departments, and the first 
secretaries of provincial and 
municipal party committees. 
There are also several candi-
dates among the heads of gov-
ernment staff offices and min-
istries. 
Prospects  
The regime may be pushing 
the "leap forward" campaign too 
hard. Despite the policy 
changes, there are indications 
that some of the economic trou-
bles which cropped up in 1956 
are reappearing. The People's  
Daily has complained that the 
"gloomy clique" is now trying 
to make an issue out of the raw 
materials shortage. Actually, 
shortages of raw materials 
began to be felt as early 
as March. The regime at that 
time insisted it would be able 
to deal with the "tense" sit-
uation, but its remedies were 
limited to promoting the use 
of substitutes and urging re-
duced consumption and the sal-
vaging of used materials. The 
problem was still "paramount" 
in July. 
Transport congestion has 
been felt this year earlier 
that it was in 1956. The party's 
main spokesman in the field re-
cently warned that the "tre-
mendouspressuresil already ap-
parent would continue to in-
crease. "Bottlenecks," he said, 
were already hampering rail 
movements. He urged a speeding 
up of construction on new facil-
ities. Neither of these prob-
lems is yet as widespread or as 
serious as they became in 1956, 
however, and there has been no 
sign yet of similar financial 
strains. 
The leadership, heavily 
committed to the "leap" and 
aware that opposition elements 
have been waiting for statisti-
cal support for their charges 
of recklessness, may have 
rushed the publication of the 
statistical report for the first 
half of the year before the sup-
porting figures could be ade-
quately checked. This would 
appear to be most likely in the 
case of agriculture. 
Great gains have almost 
certainly been made in the 
course of the "leap." Rates of 
growth in both industry and ag-
riculture have been stepped up 
and economic reforms which 
should be of continuing value 
have been effected. While a 
slowdown seems inevitable, the 
chief exponents of the "leap" 
have isolated an opposing group 
which can be blamed for the 
slowdewn if necessary

with Communist China. Prime 
Minister Kishi believes the 
visit will be a key to long-
term cooperation and that 
it will counter widespread 
charges that Tokyo is subser-
vient to the United States on 
issues affecting Japanese in-
terests. 
Kishi believes his own 
visit to Washington in June 
1957 achieved limited success, 
particularly the abolition 
of the China differential 
trade embargo and agreement 
on disposition of Japanese 
war criminals. However, he 
feels the adjustments made in 
security arrangements lacked 
substance. Remaining issues 
were left unsettled and several 
now have assumed crucial im-
portance for Kishi's govern-
ment. 
Priority attention is be-
ing , given' to the need for 
sweeping changes in security 
relations. Many Japanese feel 
that the present "one-sided" 
security treaty was imposed as 
a price of a peace treaty in 
1952. The Socialists and oth-
er leftists have been able to 
foment public antagonism to 
ward the treaty by charging 
that it infringes on Japanese 
sovereignty. 
Fujiyama v*ill seek a 
revision which would specif-
ically require Japanese Gov-
ernment approval before nuclear 
weapons are brought to Japan 
and before American forces and 
equipment in Japan are dis-
patched for use in hostilities 
outside the country. Concern 
among Japanese that action by 
Japan-based forces might in-
volve their country involun-
zarixv in nostifirlAs in ntheir 
areas 
Fujiyama will also seek 
some Japanese control over the 
use and disposition of Ameri-
can forces in Japan. 
Occupying almost equal im-
portance on Fujiyama's agenda 
is the problem of cooperation 
in the economic development of 
Southeast Asia. Unlike a year 
ago, when Kishi proposed a de-
tailed plan for an Asian devel-
opment fund, the Japanese are 
prepared to listen to American 
proposals. They have taken 
special note of US interest in 
regional development programs 
for Latin America and the Mid-
dle East and have been encour-
aged by President Eisenhower's 
recently announced intention 
to strengthen the World Bank 
and establish, an international 
development association, which

4 September 1958 
they hope will coincide with 
their own plans for Asian devel-
opment. 
Fujiyama probably will call 
for a plan to stabilize raw ma-
terial prices in Southeast Asia 
and emphasize the need for ur-
gent action to counter develop-
ing Communist economic penetra-
tion of that area. Communist 
China's call for a boycott of 
Japanese goods by Overseas Chi-
nese in Southeast Asia and its 
campaign to undersell Japanese 
products there have aroused 
serious concern in Japan. 
Tokyo is looking to the 
United States as the major 
financier of a program for de-
veloping Southeast Asia. Japan's 
ability to contribute to such a 
program is limited. It has ap-
propriated approximately $14,-
000,000 in its current budget 
as a contribution in the event 
a program is established, but 
its limited fiscal resources 
are already heavily committed. 
Japanese reparations to coun-
tries in the area total about 
$70,000,000 annually, a credit 
of $50,000,000 has been ex-
tended to India, another of 
$20,000,000 has been approved 
for Burma, and similar action 
may be taken on requests from 
Pakistan and Ceylon. Fuji-
yama may propose, however, that 
some $600,000,000 which Japan 
owes the United States for re-
lief expenditures in Japan fol-
lowing World War II be utilized 
in an Asian development pro-
gram. 
An accommodation with 
Communist China probably is the 
Kishi government's most contro-
versial and complex problem. 
The prime minister's dilatory 
policy on the impasse with 
Peiping is receiving ever-
increasing criticism from 
business and labor interests, 
the press, Socialists, many 
conservative leaders, and at 
least two of his own cabinet 
members. Communist China's 
economic campaign in Southeast 
Asia and the recent relaxation 
of the COCOM embargo, which 
many Japanese fear will give 
European commercial interests 
a foothold on the mainland while 
trade with Japan is suspended, 
have spurred demands for gov-
ernment action to break the 
stalemate. 
Kishi continues to assert 
that he will "wait and see" but 
recently told Ambassador 
MacArthur he is becoming iso-
lated in this view and requires 
definite support, such as Amer-
ican assistance in the Asian 
development program, which 
would allow Japan to expand mar-
kets in Southeast Asia to re-
place those "lost" on the China 
mainland. Fujiyama, who has in-
dicated that Japan is planning 
ambassadorial talks with Commu-
nist China if the government 
cannot find another way of re-
ducing Japanese pressures for 
China trade, probably will at-
tempt to .discern how fat 
Tokyo can go _toward closer, 
relations with Peiping without 
alienating the United States. 
Tokyo insists that any efforts 
toward a rapprochement with 
Communist China will not in-
clude diplomatic recognition. 
Finally, Fujiyama will dis-
cuss in a general way methods 
for expanding Japanese markets 
in the United States. The Jap-
anese experienced a deficit of 
more than one billion dollars 
in trade with the United States 
in 1957, about half of which was 
offset by special US dollar ex-
penditures in Japan. In an at-
tempt to close the dollar gap, 
the Japanese had begun to switch 
some purchases of soybeans from 
the United States to Communist 
China prior to Peiping's suspen-
sion of Sino-Japanese trade, and 
have been considering switching 
purchases of various commodities 
elsewhere. 
The trade deficit with the 
United States during the first 
half of 1958 was approximately 
$275,000,000--about half that

percent,and the trade improve-

from a drop in Japanese imports 
under the present "tight money" 
policy rather than from an 
expansion of exports. Fujiyama, 
therefore, probably will seek an

ples which the United States will

trade gap when Japan's econ-

THE COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCE 
The Commonwealth Economic 
Conference opening at Montreal 
on 15 September--the first such 
full-scale meeting since 1952--
is likely to show a somewhat 
diminished role for Britain 
and a growing divergence be-
tween the older and newer Com-
monwealth countries as to the 
means of overcoming their eco-
nomic problems. Older members 
such as Canada and Australia are 
concerned primarily about the 
inadequacy of monetary reserves, 
while the newer, less developed 
members like India and Ghana 
insist that the immediate prob-
lem is the need for stabilizing 
prices of raw materials. 
Earlier Conferences 
Despite the continuing im-
portance of the sterling area 
in world trade, the years since 
the 1952 economic conference 
have seen a general loosening 
of Commonwealth ties and an in-
tensification of the tendency 
to seek economic arrangements 
outside the Commonwealth frame-
work. Discussions at the cur-
rent meeting will in part look 
forward to the October confer-
ence of the International Mon-
etary Fund and World Bank and 
be directed toward achieving a 
more comprehensive free-world 
attack on such problems as in-
creasing monetary reserves, 
stabilizing trade, and accel-
erating economic development. 
The increased importance 
of underdeveloped countries 
25X1 
in Commonwealth councils is 
seen in the broader composition 
of the September conference, 
which will include the newest 
Commonwealth members, Ghana 
and Malaya, as well as colonial 
representatives from the West 
Indies Federation inaugurated 
early this year. 
Britain's gradually declin-
ing ability to provide invest-
ment capital and other tangible 
economic benefits to the other 
Commonwealth members was re-
flected in the conference prep-
arations. Contrary to the 
usual procedure whereby Britain 
initiated all such conferences, 
this one was proposed by Cana-
dian Prime Minister Diefenbaker 
at the annual meeting of Common-
wealth finance ministers last 
September. It is also the first 
one to be held outside London 
and the first in which papers 
will have been prepared by 
Commonwealth members other than 
Britain.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
The conference proposal re-
ceived a lukewarm reception at 
first by most of the Common-
wealth members. The Diefenbaker 
initiative was generally con-
sidered a political gesture by 
the new Canadian Conservative 
government which had pledged 
during the previous spring's 
election campaign to lessen 
Canada's economic dependence on 
the United States and to strength-
en its Commonwealth ties. 
Britain, however, took up 
the proposal enthusiastically, 
apparently in the hope that such 
a meeting might be used to re-
vive confidence among sterling 
area members who were becoming 
increasingly alarmed by recur-
ring stresses on sterling. Aus-
tralia, for instance, in ex-
pressing its doubts about the 
long-term prospects for the 
sterling area's survival to 
American Embassy officials in 
Canberra early this year, 
wondered whether the United 
States was thinking of possible 
alternatives or remedial meas-
ures that might be adopted. How-
ever, Britain's current rela-
tively strong financial position, 
compared with its financial 
crisis last fall, has removed 
the sense of urgency for con-
crete results. 
Conflict of 'Interests. 
The preparatory discussions 
held in London in February and 
again in June illustrated the 
disparity of views among Common-
wealth members on the relative 
priority of the agenda items. 
Of greater importance, however, 
is the contrast the talks fur-
nished of the opposing economic 
Interests of the older and newer 
members. Australia's concern 
with the inadequacy of monetary 
reserves is shared by Canada, 
New Zealand, and South Africa, 
which are among the world's most

liament last June was a call 
for much larger "liquid re-
serves"--i.e., gold and dol-
lars--to support free-world 
trade. 
The conferees are expected 
to coordinate their views on 
the scale of enlarging IMF 
quotas and amounts pledged to 
the World Bank, in anticipation 
of the annual meetings of these 
institutions in New Delhi on 
6 October. 
To the newer Commonwealth 
members, the dominant problem 
to be faced at the conference 
is the instability of prices 
for raw materials and agricul-
tural commodities. Primary-
producing Commonwealth countries 
like Malaya, Ghana, and India 
charge that the sharp drop in 
these prices during the past 
year contributed in large part 
to Britain's improved economic 
position but endangered their 
own foreign-exchange holdings. 
In the preliminary London talks 
they insisted that some long-
term remedial action must be 
taken to avoid the sharp and 
sudden price changes which 
since 1938 have seen prices for 
wheat fluctuating by as much 
as 273 percent, for wool by 
415 percent, for sugar by 435 
percent, and for copper by 612 
percent. 
In defense of their posi-
tion, these Commonwealth members 
point out that in many cases 
their countries account for the 
greater part of the world's out-
put of primary commodities: for 
example, half or more of the 
total output of wool, jute, 
cocoa, tea, sisal, gold, nickel, 
manganese, and asbestos; and 
between one third and one half 
of the world output of natural 
rubber, rice, oilseed, tin, and 
chrome. 
British Board of Trade of-
ficials have informed the Amer-
ican Embassy that the preliminary 
discussions on the conference 
showed a more acute concern 
about the prospect of Britain's 
participation in the projected 
European free trade area than 
London had anticipated. In a 
roundabout way this was linked 
with proposals advanced for the 
consolidation and expansion of 
development funds. 
Malaya's introduction of 
the concept of Britain's extend-
ing development funds as a quid 
pro quo for retaining Common-
wealth preferences, for instance, 
found considerable favor at the 
February meeting. It was argued 
that these tariff preferences 
gave Britain greater advantages 
than Malaya, with the implication 
that British participation in a 
free trade area would sharpen 
the unfairness of this situa-
tion. On this basis, therefore, 
Malaya suggested that a supply 
of development capital instead 
of British trade concessions 
might be a more appropriate 
counterbalance. According to 
the embassy, London is convinced 
that it faces difficult maneuver-
ing to avoid a critical attack 
on these issues at the confer-
ence. 
Britain's Approach  
It appears that Britain 
will play a defensive role at

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
the conference. For a variety 
of reasons, the Macmillan gov-
ernment has decided not to pre-
sentthe only two positive pro-
posals it was prepared to offer 
at the meeting: a Commonwealth 
bank along the lines of the 
World Bank and a Commonwealth 
free trade area, both of which 
are believed to have been pet 
projects of the prime minister 
himself. 
London is expected to re-
sist pressure for a Commonwealth 
initiative in seeking interna-
tional commodity agreements and 
the establishment of a Common-
wealth development agency simi-
lar to that of the US Develop-
ment Loan Fund established in 
1957. While acknowledging the 
need for a new approach to com-
modity problems, Britain ap-
pears determined to retain its 
traditional flexibility and to 
avoid any pat formula on issues 
of Commonwealth trade and aid. 
In view of its limited maneuver-
ability and capacity to supply 
funds, London apparently pre-
fers to deal with each situa-
tion as it arises on an ad hoc 
basis, as, for example, in the 
plan to relieve India's critical 
foreign exchange shortage in 
cooperation with the United 
States, Japan, West Germany, 
Canada, and the World Bank. 
LATIN AMERICAN INTEREST 
The early August declara-
tion by the foreign ministers 
of Venezuela, Colombia, and 
Ecuador, which called among 
other things for a "common mar-
ket" among their three countries 
illustrates the increased in-
terest in regional marketing 
arrangements that has prevailed 
The inclusion in the dele-
gation of Paymaster General 
Maudling, Britain's negotiator 
on European free trade area ques-
tions, indicates the importance 
London continues to attach to 
achieving Commonwealth agree-
ment on this major objective of 
the Macmillan government. While 
Maudling will be pressed to re-
new assurances that the prefer-
ences given Commonwealth agri-
cultural exports to Britain will 
be protected, he presumably will 
explore the extent to which 
these preferences might be modi-
fied if necessary to secure 
Continental agreement on the 
free trade Area. Maudling is 
not known to be entertaining 
any specific compromise plan. 
Fortunately from the Brit-
ish view, however, the sense 
of urgency in which the confer-
ence was conceived no longer 
exists. London can exploit the 
very substantial improvement 
in its financial position in 
recent months as evidence of the 
recuperative powers and basic 
strength of the pound sterling. 
The anticipated pickup in Amer-
ican production this autumn--
which would probably raise 
prices for raw materials--may 
also lessen the pressure for 
Commonwealth action on commodity 
problems.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
primarily concerned with using 
joint action to accelerate in-
dustrialization. Such moves, 
however, may be symptomatic of 
a growing interest in economic 
self-help, and experience in 
regional marketing problems may 
lead to some reduction of trade 
barriers. 
Apart from an agreement 
among? the governments of five 
Central American republics on 
a very limited treaty "for 
multilateral free trade and in-
tegration," which now is subject 
to ratification, Latin American 
action toward a regional market 
has been restricted to pro-
nouncements, discussion, and 
study. All of these reveal that 
the Latin American approach is 
markedly different from that 
of the EEC and in many respects 
contrary to the in-
tent of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) to 
increase competition 
and promote efficient 
use of resources. 
Common Market Concept  
There is astrik-
ing contrast between 
Latin American and 
Western European po-
litico-economic conditions as 
they relate to possibilities 
for economic integration. 
they are members of the oldest 
existing regional political 
grouping, they have had no ex-
perience in economic cooperation 
comparable to that of Western 
Europe in the Organization for 
European Economic Cooperation 
(OEEC) under the aegis of the 
Marshall Plan. 
Several of the Latin Amer-
ican countries also lack the 
technical skills in internation-
al trade and finance necessary 
to coordinate national economic 
policies. The problem of co-
ordinating a common market for 
20 countries, as contrasted with 
six in the EEC, would be addi-
tionally complicated by the 
vastly greater distances in-
volved. This may tend to en-
courage smaller regional group-
ings.

In the EEC there are six 
mature economies which conduct 
about one third of their total 
trade with each other. They 
are strongly motivated politi-
cally toward union to avert 
repetition of costly wars and 
to tie West Germany to the West. 
An integrated economy and com-
munity is seen as the only means 
of re-establishing Europe's 
traditional world influence. 
In Latin America, on the 
other hand, there are 20 na-
tionalistic, underdeveloped 
republics which conduct less 
than 10 percent of their total 
trade with each other. Although 
Latin American Approach  
There appears to be no 
practical Latin American intent 
to merge economies and societies 
as in the EEC. It was, in fact, 
the prospective advent of the 
EEC which in 1956 initiated the 
current wave of interest among 
the Latin Americans in a local 
"common market" as a means of 
protecting themselves from an-
ticipated discrimination against 
their trade in favor of the 
EEC's tropical dependent ter-
ritories--particularly in such 
commodities as coffee and cocoa. 
Their interest in a "common mar-
ket" appears to be motivated 
largely by a desire to offset 
jointly national economic vul-
nerabilities in order to foster 
diversification and industrial 
development.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
4 September 1958 
The decline in world prices 
of their primary commodities 
such as coffee and nonferrous 
metals since 1956 led to acute 
balance-of-payments problems 
for most Latin American coun-
tries and gave much impetus to 
the search for a common market 
solution. It also intensified 
resentment against the United 
States for the "inadequacy" of 
its financial aid to Latin Amer-
ica and for its resistance to 
commodity price stabilization 
arrangements. 
Specialists on the staff 
of the Economic Commission for 
Latin America (ECLA) see the 
common-market approach as a 
means of ameliorating payments 
difficulties while maintaining 
desired levels of industrial 
development. The contend that 
creation of export industries 
within such a protective ar-
rangement would enable member 
countries to ease foreign-ex-
change shortages by promoting 
regional self-sufficiency. 
These experts also think in 
terms of applying the common-
market principle only to spe-
cific industries and commodities. 
Furthermore, the Brazilian 
director of currency and credit 
has recently cited redress Of 
bargaining power against the 
United States and the EEC as a 
major aim of a regional Latin 
American market. These views 
are clearly contrary to the 
spirit, if not the letter, of 
Article XXIV of the GATT which 
authorizes establishment of a 
common market and stipulates 
that it shall not raise barriers 
to trade with other GATT mem-
bers and shall embrace sub-
stantially all trade originating 
in such an area. 
Prospects in Latin America 
Establishment of a common 
market can be achieved only 
over a period of many years; 
12-15 is anticipated even in 
the case of the EEC. Few, if 
any, Latin American governments 
have demonstrated sufficient 
stability and continuity of 
policy to justify any expecta-
tion that they could maintain 
the orderly direction required. 
On the other hand, there 
is considerable scope for in-
creased trade between Latin 
American countries, particularly 
in agricultural products and 
light manufactures, that could 
be stimulated through limited 
joint marketing arrangements. 
In their recent consideration 
of such possibilities, Latin 
Americans have shown increasing 
appreciation of the need to 
eliminate import quotas and 
payments restrictions as a first 
step toward promoting such trade. 
As the infeasibility of an 
all-embracing "common market" 
and the need for eliminating 
trade restrictions come to 
be more widely appreciated 
in Latin America, the current 
interest in a "common market" 
will serve US interests in  
maximizing world trade. /
