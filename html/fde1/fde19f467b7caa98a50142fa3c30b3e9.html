 SING - SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 MOSCOW HITS CHINESE CONGRESS'S FOREIGN POLICY PFi;)NOUNCEP1ENTS
 An authoritative Soviet response to PRC foreign policy pronouncements
 at the Fourte National People's Congress (NPC)             in January has come
 in a 22 February PRAVDA editorial article whicl            rejected Chou En-tai's
 proposal in his NPC report that the USSR "do something" to solve
 'h bit" of the border problem and accused Pekin,; of fomenting global
 unrest.  Earlier, on 5 February a PRAVDA artl.4:?1R carrying similar
 authority under the byline "I. Aleksandrov" hnd focused on Chinese
 internal developments in discussing the new F'Z.C constitution.*
 Linking the "Maoist leadership" with the mos: "aggressive" imperialist
 forces who oppose the "dominant" trend toward relaxation of inter-
 national tension, PRAVDA criticized virtually all PRC foreign
 policies.   It denounced the PRC concept of "Three Worlds," attacked
 the Chinese position on the inevitability of war, and condemned alleged
 PRC border provocations against neighboring states.  The article
 also pointed up China's different approach to relations with the
 United States and with the JSSR, especially as shot-m in China's
 support for a U.S. presence in Asia, and in Chou En-lai's relatively
 positive assessment of Sino-U.S. relations in contrast to his bleak
 outlook for Sino-Soviet ties.
 SINO-SOVIET BORDER      In Moscow's first authoritative response to
 Chou's NPC challenge to the Soviets to meet
 Chinese demands on the frontier, PRAVDA bluntly held Peking
 responsible for blocking normalization of relations through "the
 repetition of deliberately unacceptable preliminary conditions."
 Showing no sign of willingness to "do something," PRAVDA countered
 by tellipb the PRC leaders that if "they had serious intentions" in
 proclaiming at the 14PC a desire for normal state relations, they
 "should finally take really constructive steps in this direction."
 The article quoted Brezhnev's November speech in Mongolia as an
 expression of the Soviet position--that the USSR claims no Chinese
 territory, has no preliminary conditions for normalization of

 relations, and is willing to .ign a treaty of nonaggression and
 nonuse of .force.*  While accusing China of "border provocations"
 against neighborin; socialist states, the article did not
 specifically recall Sino-Soviet border clashes.
 WAR AND PEACE      According to PRAVDA, Peking's current line is
 designed to "undermine the cause of peace and to
 kindle enmity and hatred among the peoples," and it accused
 China's leaders of trying to foment international tension in order
 to make China a leading power.  Recalling that at the WPC Chou
 had stated the goal of bringing China "into the first rank of
 the countries of the world" by the end of the century,  the
 article accused China of basing its planned rise to power  on
 the misfortune of other peoples."  PRAVIA quoted alleged ;1ao
 remarks in the late 1950's that: a nuclear war "will not be so bad,"
 and noted that "Peking is once again buzzing with speeches about
 the fatal inevitability of a new world war" and suggesting that
 such a development would be favorable.   The article said Chou's
 NPC statement that "there is no relaxation in the world" was
 contrary to fact, and it noted that neither Chou nor the PRC
 constitution "mention the need to uphold the cause of peace"
 included it the previous constitution.
 WORLD ALINEMENT     PRAVDA linked China's war orientation with its
 current theoretical. divisinn of nations into
 "Three Worlds," with the two superpowers compcslng the First World,
 other developed countries the Second World, and the developing
 countries the Third World.   The article portrayed the superpower
 thesis as being aimed primarily against the Soviet Union in an
 effort to break up the socialist community and incite other peoples
 against the USSR.  While accusing the Chinese of seeking to push
 the United States and the Soviet Union into a tli~rmonucl.ear war,
 the article noted that Chou's report presented "completely differently"
 the prospects of developing PRC-USSR and PRC-U.S. relations.   It
 noted Chou's statement that relations with the .United States have
 "improved to some extent," and contrasted that with his statement
 about "controversies 'on fundamental questions' with the USSR."
 "   Brezhnev's speech had rejected China's 1974 October Revolution
 Faniversary message, in which China first publicly raised the claim
 that a "mutual understanding" at the September 1969 border talks
 had provided for mutual nonaggression and nonuse of force as part
 of a preliminary package accord to be reached before starting overall
 border negotiations.  Brezhnev's speech is discussed in FBIS TRENDS,
 27 November 1974, page 5.

 The article ignored Chou's standard statement that "fundamental
 differences" exist between China and the United States, but
 made a token effort to dispel the implication of Sino--U.S.
 collaboration against the Soviet Union by remarking that the
 "constructive shift" in Soviet-U.S. relations has caused "bit-
 terness" in Peking.
 PRAVDA seemed to show some concern over Peking's success in
 attracting elements of the Second and Third Worlds.  It noted
 that China was "flattering the young developing states" L,y
 calling itself a member of the Third World and warned that such
 tactics see:: only to "use the developing states as a tool" in
 implementing China's great-power designs.  It saw in the Chinese
 maneuverings a desire to weaken these countries and divert them
 from the path of strengthening their political and economic
 independence.   The article linked alleged internal disruption
 of developing countries by China with its alleged appeals for
 "preservation of the U.S. military presence" in Asia, seeing
 the Chinese as "nurturing hopes of winning control of raw materials
 and sales markets in Asia and Africa from the imperialist monopolies
 in the future, but not feeling strong enough to achieve th:Ls yet."
 According to PRAVI)A, the Chinese are now seeking to preserve the status
 quo in developing countries until their strength increases.  The
 article saw Chinese opposition to an Asian collective security pact
 as proof of their dreams of hegemony and territorial acquisitions.
 PRAVDA presented Peking's relations with the Second World as an
 attimpt to ally with "reactionary militarist-revanchist Eorces"
 in opposition to world socialism.   In standard terms, the article
 accused the Chinese of trying to sabotage peace efforts in FA:ope
 by asserting that the Soviet Union is "making a feint to the East
 and will strike its blo'-r in the West."It recalled recent visits
 to the PRC by conservative European leaders, and admonished
 Chinese leaders that the "aggressive imperialist circles" have
 their own goal of fom.nting military confrontation between China
 and the socialist community.   The article noted "Peking's desire
 to complicate Soviet-Japanese  relations," but it did not
 specifically refer to current Sino-Japanes-_- and Soviet-Japanese
 treaty negotiations.

 EAST EUROPEANS REPORT PRICE INCREASES FOR IMPORTED SOVIET OIL
 Moscow's CEMA partners waited a month before acknowledging in scattered
 public comment that a late January CEPIA agreement means East
 European countries will pF.y higher prices for petroleum imported from
 the USSR for 1975 and the 1976-1980 period.  Thus far, of Moscow's
 allies, only Hungarian, East German, and Polish commentators are
 known to have discussed the impact of the oil price increase, in
 articles and talks publicized on 22 and 23 February.  The only Soviet
 comment on the new CEMA oil prices available thus far came in a
 23 February Rodionov talk on Moscow radio that denounced alleged
 efforts in a New York TIMES article to set oil-producing and oll-
 importing socialist countries against one another.  Rodionov
 pointed out that the TRIES article had admitted that the 1975
 prices for Soviet oil sold to East European countries were below
 worldmarket prices.  The initial East European comments do not
 deal with Western allegations of friction and differences within
 CEMA on the oil price issue, but emphasize that CE?iA members still
 will obtain oil at prices far below those paid by Western importing
 countries.
 The Soviet oil price increases now beginning to be discussed were
 foreshadowed in the communique on the 21-23 January CE^!A Executive
 Committee meeting in Moscow.  The communique had not, however,
 specifically acknowledged that Soviet oil prices would go up, but
 noted vaguely that to insure "favorable conditions" for future goods
 exchanges within CET1A, the committee had "approved recommendations
 concerning contractual prices to be applied in trade" among the
 CE:IA member states during the next 5-year period.  The new pricing
 mechanism also provides for annual price revisions, allowing Moscow
 to avoid getting locked in again to a long-term oil price unfavorable
 to the USSR.
 East European commentators, like Moscow, stressed that the planned
 CEMA price increases for oil and other raw materials would still
 result in a price level "considerably" below current world market
 prices.  Thus, Budapest's NEPSZABADSAG on the 23d pointed out that
 under the new price schedule for 1975, a ton of crude oil imported
 by Hungary from the USSR would cost 37 rubles (about $50) compared
 with a price of $110 per ton on "the capitalist world market."  The
 current exchange rate is $1.34 per ruble,  NEPSZABA')SAG added that
 tiie world market price for pig iron was much higher than the price

 26 FEBRUARY 1975
 for Soviet pig iron, in a ratio of two and one-half to one.  The
 1975 price increases for Hungarian imports from the USSR, it noted
 is this connection, would increase 52 percent for "energy" and
 other raw materials, compared to only 3.3 percent for machines and
 equipment.  On the subject of the CEi1A pricing mechanism for the
 next 5-year pF.riod, 1976-80, the article reported that the previous
 system of fixed prices for an entire 5-year period would be
 replaced by one whereby prices would be established each year on
 the basis of "the main market prices" in trade between the CEFIA
 countries (luring the preceding five years.   The system as described
 thus permits annual increases for Soviet oil, but with accompanying
 safeguards to keep these prices well below the world market level.
 An East Berlin radio talk by Gerstner on the 23d pointed out that
 CEMA countries had "always" taken into account the world market
 prices of principal products, but that the prime reason for the
 CEi1A price increases lay within the socialist countries themselves.
 Thus the Gerstner commentary attributed higher Soviet oil prices
 to the cost of developing new petroleum sources in Siberia.  The
 Rodionov talk the same day had mentioned only in general terms
 that the East European people were "well aware" of the USSR's efforts
 to exploit "Siberian natural resources."  Gerstner envisaged prices
 for Soviet oil during the next few years reaching a level half as
 high as those on the capitalist market.  Anticipating a negative
 reaction, the commentator added that "this is the situation, dear
 listeners, which has objectively emerged for us and to which we
 must adapt."
 In more generalized but candid comment, the Warsaw weekly POLITYKA
 of 22 February observed that CEHA's previous system of setting
 prices, a "stop price"  system, had ceased working at the end of
 1973, when steep rises in world market prices for oil "began to
 hamper the growth of cooperation and integration."  This, it said
 was the reason for the present conversion to a "progressive price"
 system for the coming 5-year period.   In 1975, POLITYKA said, CEHA
 prices would still be well below world prices, "but the difference
 will no longer be so glaring."
 ROMANIA, AL3ANIA      A Ceausescu speech on foreign trade on 14
 February in Bucharest was used by the Romanian
 leader for what appeared to be a new expression of independence from
 11oscow.  Ceausescu noted that while "some" raw materials were imported
 from the USSR and other socialist countries, Romania imported oil
 "exclusively" from nonsocialist countries at world market prices.   This,
 he added, resulted in a negative trade balance with nonsocialist

 countries and a trade surplus with socialist states, each
 amounting to about $200 million.  He called for measures to
 correct both imbalances.
 Tirana's ATA on the 25th viewed the CEI'IA price increases as
 a new example of Moscow's plundering and exploitation of its
 East European trading partners.   The principal vehicle for such
 exploitation, it stressed, was the "Friendship" oil pipeline,
 which it said was constructed with the money and labor of the
 East European countries for Moscow's benefit.

 MOSCOW, ALLIES PUBLICIZE WARSAW PACT TROOP FREEZE PROPOSAL
 Moscow and its Warsaw Pact allies have again broken the confiden-
 tiality of the Vienna force reductions negotiations (MBFR) by
 publicizing the Pact's formal proposal that the 11 direct partici-
 pants in the talks issue a joint statement declaring a freeze on
 the numerical strength of their armed forces in the region under
 negotiation while the talks are in progress.  The idea of a Pact
 freeze proposal had been broached once before, in a low-level
 Moscow Radio Peace and Progress commentary on 17 December.  Media
 silence on the issue was ended on 13 February, following the third
 plenary session of the talks since their resumption on 30 January,
 suggesting that the Pact had decided on a concerted publicity effort
 to press the West for a satisfactory response.  The proposal was
 revealed by a Czechoslovak spokesman in a press conference reported
 by Czechoslovak media and by 'PASS, and was promptly played up by
 Soviet and other East European media.
 The TASS dispatch on the 13th reporting the spokesman's press
 conference remarks pointed out that the freeze proposal would not
 be to the disadvantage of either side.   Brezhnev the following day,
 in his speech at the luncheon for visiting British Prime Minister
 Wilson, made no reference to the proposal in repeating the standard
 charge that the "persistent attempts of some countries to obtain
 unilateral advantages" and "to outplay the other side are
 unfortunately still seriously impeding the progress" of the talks.
 Predictably, hoscow has not discussed the data on which any freeze
 would be based, and has ignored criticism by Western spokesmen of
 this aspect of the proposal.  The thrust of the comment by Moscow
 and its Pact allies has again been that the Pact states are
 demonstrating their flexibility and sincerity through a readiness
 for compromise in an effort to get the talks out of their current
 impasse.  Calling for NATO good will, the comment as before has
 taken the Western states to task for their negative response to
 this new Pact_ initiative.  Three advantages of the freeze have been
 pointed out in a series of Czechoslovak media interviews by Prague
 chief delegate Klein, as well as by PRAVDA's I. Melnikov on the 17th
 and by other commentators.  The proposal, its proponents have claimed,
 would be an obs:acle to the arms race in central Europe, would improve
 the atmosphere surrounding the talks, and would move the negotiations
 forward by taking the first step toward reductions.  With regard to
 the last point, comment has recalled the various successful first
 steps taken in reaching other arms control agreements, such as the
 nuclear nonproliferation agreement and the convention on
 bacteriological weapons.

 PORTUGAL
 PRAVDA EDITORIAL ARTICLE ADVISES LEFTISTS TO MAINTAIN UNITY
 Soviet media's first authoritative discussion of developments
 in Portugal since the coup of last April ^ame in a 22 February
 PRAVDA editorial article--carried textually by TASS and
 Moscow radio in Portuguese and Spanish.   The article, entitled
 "The Portuguese People--Master of Its Destiny," purportedly
 was pegged to the upcoming first anniversary of the coup, a
 remarkably early anniversary observance.  The timing of the
 article would seem to reflect Soviet r.;acern over developments
 as Portugal moves toward the projected 12 April constituent
 assembly elections.   It comes against the background of
 considerable Western press speculation about the Portuguese
 Communist Party (PCP) role and the party's reported influence
 on leaders of the Armed Forces Movement, the uncertain outcome
 of the April elections, and the reported decision of the Armed
 Forces Movement to continue indefinitely to play an active role
 in the government after the April and subsequent legislative
 elections.
 The editorial article might also be setting the stage for
 justification of a poor PCP showing at the polls, by professing
 to see threats tc the PCP from reactionary forces as well as
 from the Portuguese Socialists.   PCP leader Cunhal himself has
 already publicly laid the groundwork for questioning the
 results of the April elections if the communists do poorly.
 Since the April coup, Soviet media have reported cautiously on
 developments, frequently by replaying PCP comment and statements.
 In general, the steady flow of Moscow press and radio comment
 has been of routine nature and unexceptional content.  Soviet
 leaders in their speeches have repeatedly, but briefly, praised
 the coup, remarking favorably on the successful overthrow of
 "fascism," democratization of the in,:ernal political situation,
 and the rapid decolonization process, and cited the coup as an
 example of the benefits of Moscow's policy of detente.

 ADVICE TO LEFTISTS     The PRAVDA editorial article was notable
 for its warning that "if all. the
 progressive forces" in Portug-.1 did not remain united, favorable
 opportunities would be creed for "revenge on the part of
 reaction and fascism."  The warning was primarily directed at
 the Portuguese Socialists and other left-of-center parties.
 But PRAVDA also seemed to be cautioning the PCP that if leftist
 unity was not maintained, and if the party moved too far and
 too rapidly in the present circumstances, the "democratization"
 process would be endangered.   Perhaps also implicitly chiding
 the PCP, which reportedly has demonstrated some opposition to
 the recently announced Portuguese economic development program,
 PRAVDA stated firmly that the program's implementation "requires
 the ccnsolidation and activization of all demc,,~ratic forces."
 While not mentioning the example of the downfall of the Allende
 regime in Chile, PRAVDA intimated that a similar, if unidentified,
 "insructive historical experience" could be repeated in Portugal
 if unity of the left was not safeguarded--a point made repeatedly
 in the past year in Soviet theoretical discussions of strategy
 and tactics for Western communist parties.
 PRAVDA offered its advice to the leftists in observing that
 it seems that many leading figures are forgetting
 the instructive historical experience which
 convincingly shows that the strength of democracy
 is in the unity of all progressive forces, and,
 conversely, wherever this unity is ruptured,
 wherever action is dictated by the wish to gain
 positions at the expense of communists and the
 striving to remove them from active work in the
 national interest, a split is made in the left
 forces' ranks and favorable opportunities are
 created for revenge on the part of reaction and
 fascism.
 PRAVDA immediately addea a disclaimer, asserting that it was "far
 from making any advice and recommendations" because "each people
 is the master of its destiny and each political party bears
 responsibility for its own action."  The article concluded by
 stating that the "close alliance" between "the working masses" and
 the Armed Forces Movement was the guarantee for the Portuguese
 people's "democratic gains" and that the Portuguese only wanted to
 be left alone, without any interference, while they decided their
 affairs.

 NATO, WEST EUROPEAN       The editorial article had earlier spelled
 "INTERFERENCE"            out this interference in cataloging recent
 "alarming" attempts by "external forces"
 to influence Portugal's political life.  PRAVDA identified these
 external forces as a motley and "strange coalition" ranging from
 "belligerent NATO circles" to "quite a number" of West European
 Social Democrats.   PRAVDA professed to see recent NATO naval
 maneuvers off the Portuguese coast, along with statements by Dutch,
 West German, and British Social Democrats, as examples of direct
 interference in Portugal's internal affairs.  Summing up, PRAVDA
 "regrettably" concluded that enormous pressure from "outside" had
 been brought to bear on the Portuguese Socialist Party "to make
 it unfold an anticommunist campaign."
 The article also routinely decried the efforts of "reaction" to
 retrieve its lost positions and thwart the process of democratiza-
 tion.   It cited three such attempts:   "last summer," when former
 prime minister Palma Carlos attempted to "retard the nr',cess of
 democratic development"; on 28 September, when "reactionary forces"
 relying on former president Spinola attempted to "reverse the
 country's development 'legally"'; and in late January-early
 February, when "certain quarters" attempted to cause a government
 crisis.

 DRV, PRG FOREIGN MINISTRIES PROTEST U,S, AIRLIFTS TO CAMBODIA
 The U.S. decision, announced on 24 February, to begin an emergency
 airlift of food from Saigon to encircled Phnom Penh prompted
 protests on the 26th from both the PRG and the DRV in the authori-
 tative form of foreign ministry statements.   Presumably the
 protests were issued at this high level because these new U.S.
 flights are from Vietnam.   Earlier, on 19 February, the DRV and
 PRG had issued less authoritative foreign ministry spokesman's
 statements assailing the U.S  airlift of supplies from Thailand.
 The DRV Forc.'.gn Ministry statement claimed that the Saigon-Phnom
 Penh airlift is transporting weapons, munitions and fuel as well
 as food, and it charged that the Ford administration's a'..m is
 "to help the puppet Lon Nol clique intensify the war and massacre
 the Cambodian people."  The PRG statement was less specific in
 describing the airlift, but both it and the DRV statement e l1Ed
 the U.S. action a new violation of the Paris agreement.  Both
 statements also sharply castigated President Thieu as well as t),.e
 United States.  The PRG "sternly warned" that Americans and "the
 bellicose Nguyen Van Thieu clique" that the airlift was "an act
 of war" against the Cambodian people and a "brazcu violation of
 'Vietnam's sovereignty."  The DRV statement for -.ts part charged
 that the "Nguyen Van Thieu clique's" agreement to the airlift
 constituted "an extremely grave. act of aggression against Cambodia."
 The foreign ministry spokesmen's statements on th19th had voiced
 no similar criticism of the Thai Government.   Thus, the DRV spokes-
 man merely called on Bangkok to "stop lending a hand to the United
 States in its aggression" in Indochina.
 DRV PARTY HISTORY CONTAINS ATYPICAL HARVEST STATISTICS
 In a departure from years-long practice of avoiding precise figures
 for its annual harvests, Hanoi has boasted of an astonishing
 5.6 million metric tons in food production for 1971--the year of
 floods which had been described as the worst in nearly 100 years.
 The claim appears in the new lengthy history of the Vietnam
 Workers Party, issued to mark the party's 45th anniversary on
 3 February and broadcast by Hanoi radio in 19 installments.   The
 history indicated that the figure of 5.6 million tons actually

 represented an equivalent tonnage of paddy--unhush:ed, unmilled
 rice--and that, of this total amount, "nearly 5 million tons" was
 paddy itself,  with other grains and vegetables accounting for
 the remaining portion.
 Earlier DRV media discussion of the 1971 crop had typically failed
 to provide annual figures and had given the impression that the
 crop fell considerably short because of the extremely serious
 floods during the growing season for tenth-month rice.  As
 recently as last August First Secretary Le Duan, in his report
 delivered to an agricultural conference, recalled that  "in 1971
 and 1973 alone, natural calamities caused the loss of more than
 1.5 million tons of paddy .  . . ."
 In the early 1960's Hanoi media regularly publicized figures for
 annual agricultural production; however, the new figure for 1971
 is the first annual total known to have been released since
 escalatioi  of the war in 1965.  During the past 10 years the media
 have customarily used such generalizations as "higher than normal"
 to characterize agricultural progress, and have sometimes cited
 percentage increases over other, unspecified production totals for
 previous years.

 IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN STRESSES DISCIPLINE AND PRODUCTION
 China's central and provincial press continue to give dominant
 attention to the study campaign on proletarian dictatorship, a
 drive reflecting Peking's need for controlled, orderly economic
 development to meet the ambitious goals set by Chou En-lai in
 his report to the Fourth National People's Congress in January.
 The campaign was launched early in February by a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 editorial citing a new Mao Tse-tung instruction.*   .n example
 of the concentration on this campaign was the 22 February
 PEOPLE'S DAILY, which devoted three and a half pages--nearly
 the entire issue--to a list of quotations from Marx, Engels,
 and Lenin on the dictatorship of the proletariat.   The quotations
 evidently were carefully selected and compiled to stress party
 discipline and the need for strong central control to insure the
 transition to communist economic forms during the interim period
 following the fall of capitalism.  A PEOPLE'S DAILY-RED FLAG
 editor's note accompanying the quotations stated that studying
 the theory of proletarian dictatorship should now "draw top
 attention" from everyone.
 As part of the study campaign, Peking radio and NCNA Nave
 carried four articles from a "special column" on the dictatorship
 of the proletariat published in the February RED FLAG.  On
 21 February Peking broadcast excerpts of the last of these RED
 FLAG articles, which confirmed authoritatively that the campaign
 will be run according to central directive, not mass initiative.
 The article noted that Lin Piao had used the slogan "the mass
 movement is naturally justified" to negate centralism and split
 the party.   It called for balancing centralism and democracy,
 stating that freedom must be "freedom under guidance."  Urging
 that a balance be found between democracy and centralism, the
 article warned that "without unified revolutionary discipline
 and forceful but proper executiv.. orders, revolutionary order
 cannot be maintained" and "the masses cannot engage in effective
 production and in orderly study and living."

 Supplement "China on Need for Proletarian Dictatorship in Socialist
 Stage," 14 February 1975.

 PROVINCIAL RESPONSE      Provincial radios have responded to the
 centrally :initiated campaign with it  flurry
 of reports on local meetings to discuss the need for strengthening
 "dictatorship" and ending various remnant capitalist practices.
 Nanchang radio on 24 February broadcast an unusually comprehensive
 report on a local rally of 13,000 people whic!t concluded that "it
 is necessary to strike hard at the corrupt officials, embezzlers,
 speculators, and leaders of criminal gangs."  Kiangsi.'s first
 secretary, Chiang Wei-ching, spoke at the rally, noting that
 Mao's recent instruction on proletarian dictatorship "should draw
 the top attention" of all party -.embers within the province.
 Chiang cL?Tunissioned local party leaders to organize "small but
 competent teams" to go to factories, rural villages, stores and
 schools and "see to it that the party's principles and policies are
 adhered to and that the task of consolidating the dictatorship
 of the prolet?riat is fulfilled."  Endorsing moderate methods to
 overcome remaining problems, Chiang tasked  the tearis with "putting
 facts on the table and reasoning things out."  Chiang instructed
 the teams to deal "steady, accurate, and hard blows at the handful
 of class enemies, with the emphasis on accuracy," to suppress
 "class enemies who resist the socialist system and sabotage  the
 socialist economy."  Spelling out the need for strengthening
 party authority, Chiang called upon officials to "strengthen
 security work" and "guard against trends to undermine the unity
 of the party."
 The relationship between the new study campaign and meeting
 production goals was highlighted by several provincial reports cn
 spring farming tasks.  A 24 February Wuhan report on a recent
 provincial conference on spring farming suggested that mass
 energies generated by the campaign will eventually be turned
 toward production objectives.  The broadcast stressed the need
 to study I'_ao's instruction on dictatorship of the proletariat
 and "deal accurate blows at the sabotage activities of a small
 handful of the class enemy.  .  . and make a success of spring
 farming."  The report urged local party leaders to "protect  the
 masses' activism" and to "seriously arrange the masses' daily life,
 since spring farming is a very busy time :nd production is tense."
 A 21 February Foochow report on provinica! efforts to study Mao's
 recent instruction lauded a local county party committee for
 resolving to carry out study plans "before spring farming begins
 in the county," indicating that study meetings may be curtailed
 during the busy planting period.

 NOTES
 CHOU RECEIVES SIHANOUK:        On 24 February NCNA reported that PRC
 Premier: Chou En-last had received Prince Norodom Sihanouk in the
 hospital that evening.   Sihanouk had returned on 15 February
 from his annual visit to Hanoi for the 'let holiday.  On Sihanouk's
 Tet visits in 1971, 1.972, and 1973, Chou saw Sihanouk off at the
 Peking airport and greeted him on those occasions when he
 returned directly to Peking; last year Sihanouk departed from
 and returned to Canton.   Since Chou became ill in the late spring
 of 1974 there had been no reports of meetings between the two
 leaders, other than Sihanouk'-- appearance at the PRC National Day
 banquet reception on 30 September 1974 hosted by Chou.  The reedit
 Chou-Sihanouk meeting is the first publicized private meeting
 between the two since August 1971.
 EUROPEAN CP CONFERENCE PREPARATIONS:  A Zholkver commentary broad-
 cast by Moscow on 21 February indicated that the previously
 announced timetable for the planned European communist party
 conference was still in effect.   The commentary, which said that
 the all-European CP gathering "is to take place in the first half
 of this year," was pegged to a 17-19 February East; Berlin
 preparatory session of a "working group" of the editorial commission.
 Moscow's concern to preserve an aura of democratic procedure and open
 debate w.1s reflected in the fact that the 16 parties reported by TA SS
 as participating in the working group session included seven independ-
 ently oriented CP's--those of Romania, Yugoslavia, Britain, France,
 Italy, Spain, and Sweden.  TASS added that the working group meeting
 was marked by "a detailed and constructive exchange of views" on the
 conference documents and on the next stage of preparations.
 YUGOSLAV DISSIDENT ORGAN:  PRAXIS, the anti-regime journal  for
 Yugoslavia's disaffected Marxist intellectuals, has ceased
 publication.   The closing, according to TANJUG on the 20th, was
 announced by a Croatian party official who stressed that the
 editorial board--rather than the state--had made the decision to
 shut down the 11-year-old bimonthly journal of the Croatian
 Philosophy Society.  He did, however, acknowledge that the editors
 had been under increasing pressure to reorient their. "anarcho-
 ultraleftist" perspective.  PRAXIS, which had appeared only twice
 during the past year, reported in its latest issue that the state
 had cut off its subsidy.   Western media have also reported that
 pressure was applied on publishing houses not to handle the

 journal; in a speech against PRAXIS last December, Croatian party
 leader Dragosavac had warned of such pressure.        The announcement
 on the closing reiterated longstanding regime charges that the
 journal had attacked Yugoslavia's "self-managing socialism" and
 had denied the basic role of the working class and the vanguard
 role of the party.  Tito himself revived earlier party complaints
 against the journal's links with circles in the West.  Speaking
 at a party meeting on ideology on the 25th, he criticized foreign
 ties "with some people abroad" and the "growing hue and cry" by
 foreign media regarding PRAXIS, the 28 January ouster of eight
 Marxist professors at Belgrade University, and the regime's
 prosecution of writer Mihajlo Mihajlov, who went on trial on the
 25th on charges of publishing several anti-Yugosla-, ,- articles.
 Tito brushed aside such criticism as failing to recognize the
 "right" of the party "to put out of action" those who stand in the
 way of party policy.
 SOVIET ANTI-CHILEAN COMMENT:  Moscow media have publicized two
 recent anti-Chilean events in continuing the steady stream of
 Soviet denunciations of Chile's military government.   Expressing
 support for imprisoned Chilean "communists and patriots," Moscow
 again assailed the Chilean Government in the course of comment and
 reportage  on a 12 February WFTU-sponsored "international day of
 solidarity with workers and people of Chile" and an 18-21 February
 meeting in Mexico City of an "international commission to investigate
 the crimes of the military junta."  IZVESTIYA noted on the 13th that
 the 12 February demonstrations proved the "growth of solidarity
 throughout the world" in support of the Chilean people who were
 suffering "under the heel of the fascist junta," and added that the
 "voice of the Soviet pe.iple" would continue to be heard on behalf of
 "Chilean patriots."  Reporting the meeting in Mexico, TASS on
 22 February said that the commission had condemned the "mass murder
 of helpless people" which had been "unleashed" in Chile and had
 urged all governments to break diplomatic ties with the military
 regime.  TASS also noted that the commission had "stigmatized" the
 United States for involvement in Chilean matters and had written
 President Ford expressing concern about the attempts of "certain
 American circles" to justify "the interference of the CIA in the
 internal affairs of Chile."
