 This  is  not a product of original  research.   It
 was   not meant  to be.   It  is a modest compilation of
 some  important points    from other more detailed works
 concerning the nature of the war the Soviet Union is
 waging against the West (principally the United States),
 its objectives  in that war,  and some of the means    it
 is using to achieve its objectives.   Among those means
 is  the uniquely Soviet phenomenon,   active measures,
 a kind of quiet war, if you will.   The subject of active
 measures has only fairly recently begun to be examined
 in detail in unclassified sources.   This study contains
 a brief summary of active measures contained in certain
 recent open sources;  unfortunately,  however,  for lack
 of  time  and space,  much good material  could not be
 dealt with.   No offense is intended toward those whose
 work has not been mentioned.
 Soviet  objectives  in  its self-appointed struggle
 with the West  are  not new.   Like Hitler  in Mein Kampf,
 Lenin  carefully   spelled  out  his  plans for  everyone
 to read well over half a century ago.       Non-communists,
 however,  are often amazed when exposed to Lenin's ideas
 for  the  first  time and even anti-communists are often
 surprised at Lenin's brazen candor.   This candor inci-
 dentally,  is periodically candidly reaffirmed by ruling
 Soviet leaders.
 It  is worthwhile for those opposed to,  or merely
 interested  in,  totalitarianism  to  be    reminded  from
 time to time of just what it is the West is up against
 in dealing with the Soviet variety.   If now and then
 someone unfamiliar with the nature of Soviet thought
 and action acquires an awareness of them by means such
 as this publication, then so much the better.
 I  have not dealt here with the serious problem
 for   the West,  especially the United States,  presented
 by Soviet  espionage.   Soviet  intelligence collection
 per    is not within the scope of this study.  Nonetheless,
 like most other things the Soviets undertake, intelligence
 is not an end in itself but contributes to the realization
 of important Soviet foreign policy goals.      For example,
 the theft of technology by the Soviet Union is a particu-
 larly serious problem for the West.  Science and technology
 in the Soviet Union and  their maintenance by imports
 from abroad  (legally or illegally)  are integral aspects
 of  economic warfare which, in turn,  promotes  Soviet
 economic, military and political objectives.

 World War Three is Now
 James Burnham,  in The Struggle for the World  in
 1947,   fixed April 1944  as the beginning of the Third
 World War.   The Communist-led mutiny of the Greek Navy
 in the harbor of Alexandria,  Egypt,  a year before the
 Second World War          had even ended,  was cite by Burnham
 as  the beginning of  the Third World War.    World War
 III was not,  and is not,  the nuclear war between East
 and West,  so much  feared  by all.   As Brian Crozier
 explains,  in The Strategy for Survival,  that war has
 not,  and may never come.   The real World War III was
 to be,  and La,  "a different kind of war."   According
 to Crozier,  that war is being "'fought'  for the greater
 part with non-military techniques,  such as subversion,
 disinformation, terrorism, psychologic1l war and diplomatic
 negotiations, including conferences."
 According to Vladimir Solovyov and Elena Rlepikova,
 Russian born husband and wife and authors of Yuri Androppov:
 A Secret Passage Into the Kremlin, the point is whether
 the   leaders  and  people  of  the  U.S.  "are  capable off
 realizing that the war with Russia is already underway."
 Soviet Objectives in World War III
 The Soviet world view is grounded in the principles
 of Marxism-Leninism,  consistent to this day from the
 advent  in Russia of the Bolshevik Revolution and the
 formation of the Soviet state.
 Class differences, according to Communist doctrine,
 create tensions and contradictions  from which class
 struggle emerges.   The laws of class struggle affect
 not   only  a  given  society,  the Communists  hold,  but
 differing social systems as well.   Inevitably,  in this
 conflict,  international  competition develops  along
 with the struggle of    ideas.  The manifestation of this
 struggle,  political  warfare, happens  spontaneously
 or else    it develops as an instrument of policy. No
 matter what, it happens.

 Founded on  the  theories of Marx and Lenin,  the
 Soviet world view holds    that struggle is the natural
 order of  things--political  activity  is conflict and
 war   is normal.  Whereas Clausewitz, the 19th century
 German military theorist, wrote that war was the continua-
 tion of politics by other means and Lenin himself publicly
 agreed,  modern Soviet leaders conduct themselves as
 if they  really believe the  reverse   to be nearer the
 truth,   that politics  is actually war on a different
 scale.   It might be more accurate, as a matter of fact,
 to  say  that  both politics  and    war,  as  viewed by
 Marxist-Leninists, are part of a continuum, that politics
 is war and war, politics.
 The  ultimate  aim of  the  Soviet  Union today  is
 what it was six decades ago when the Communist International
 issued its "Program" in 1924.
 The ultimate aim of the Communist leaders in Moscow,
 as  set forth by the Communist    International  in 1924,
 is  to  replace the world capitalist economy by a world
 system of Communism.   Every sacrifice must be made,
 in the Soviet view, and the greatest obstacles overcome,
 in order to carry on agitation and propaganda "persever-
 ingly,  persistently and patiently--even the most reac-
 tionary--in those institutions, societies and associations
 which proletarian or  semi-proletarian masses  are to
 be  found."     "...revolutionaries who  are  incapable
 of combining illegal forms of struggle with every form
 of legal struggle are poor  revolutionaries indeed...",
 Lenin said.
 At the very end of its 1924 "Program," the Communist
 International   reaffirms  this  statement of Karl Marx:
 "The Communists  disdain   to  conceal  their  views  and
 aims.  They openly declare that their aims can be attained
 only by  the  forci,ple overthrow of   all  the  existing
 social conditions. "

 1920 or 1921, Lenin wrote a memorandum to Georgy Chicherin,
 Soviet  foreign commissar    from 1918  to  1930.   In  it
 the author was most succinct:
 As the result of my own direct observation
 during  the  years  I  spent  in  emigration I
 must  confess  that  the   so-called cultured
 strata of   Western  Europe and America are
 incapable of understanding either the present
 position of things or the real state of relative
 power. These strata should be  regarded as
 deaf mutes,  and  our  behaviour  towards them
 should be based on this assumption. Revolution
 never develops along a straight line or by
 uninterrupted  growth,  but  forms  a  series
 of  spurts and  retreats,  attacks  and lulls,
 during which the power of  revolution grows
 stronger  and  prepares    for      the final
 victory... taking into account the long process
 which the growth of the world socialist revolution
 involves, it is necessary to resort to special
 manoeuvres which  can  speed  up our  victory
 over the capitalist countries: [a] to announce,
 in order to pacify the deaf mutes the separation
 (fictitious!) of our government and government
 organs  (the  council  of people's  comissars
 etc.)  from the party and the Politburo,  and
 especially the Comintern.      The latter must
 be declared to be independent political groupings
 tolerated  on  the  territory of  the  Soviet
 Socialist  Republics. The deaf mutes     will
 believe  this.    [b]  to  express  our wish to
 establish  immediately diplomatic   relations
 with the capitalist countries,      on the basis
 of complete non-interference in their internal
 affairs.   The    deaf mutes  will believe us
 again.   They will even be delighted and will
 open  their  doors  wide to    us,  and through
 these doors will speedily enter the emissaries
 of the Comintern and of our Party investigations
 organs in the guise of diplomatic,   cultural
 and   trade  representatives.   Speaking  the
 truth  is   a petty, bourgeois  prejudice.  A
 lie,  on  the  other  hand,  is  often justified
 by the ends.   The    capitalists   of    the whole
 world and  their  governments will shut their
 eyes  to  the kind of activities on our side
 that  I  have  referred  to,  and will  in this
 manner become not only deaf mutes but blind
 as well.   They will open up credits for us,
 which will serve us for the purpose of supporting
 Communist parties  in their countries.   They

 will supply us with the materials and technology
 which we  lack  and will  restore our military
 industry, which we need for our future victorious
 attacks upon our suppliers.    In other words,
 they will work hard in order to prepare their
 own suicide.
 Caveat Emptor
 It    has been thirty-seven years  since a certain
 "X"   authored an absorbing article on "The Sources  of
 Soviet Conduct," in the prestigious quarterly magazine,
 Foreign Affairs.   Later identified as Ambassador George
 Kennan,  expert on Soviet  relations, the author,  "X,"
 had   some things to say about dealing with the Soviets
 that  have been  repeated often by others    in the years
 since the article first appeared.          They are worth repeating
 here:
 It must  invariably be assumed in Moscow
 that  the  aims  of  the  capitalist world are
 antagonistic to the Soviet regime, and therefore
 to    the  interests of the peoples  it controls.
 If the Soviet Government           occasionally sets
 its signature to documents which would indicate
 the  contrary,         this is  to be  regarded as a
 tactical   manoeuvre permissible  in dealing
 with  the  enemy (who is without   honor)  and
 should be taken in the spirit of caveat emptor.
 Basically, the  antagonism remains.    It   is
 postulated.   And   from  it flow many of  the
 phenomena which we   find  disturbing  in the
 Kremlin's  conduct    of  foreign policy:  the
 secretiveness,  the  lack  of  frankness,  the
 duplicity, the wary  suspiciousness,  and the
 basic unfriendliness of purpose.  These phenomena
 are there to stay, for the foreseeable future.
 There  can be  variations  of     degree  and of
 emphasis.  When there is something the Russians
 want from us, one or the other of these features
 of  their  policy may  be  thrust  temporarily
 8Special Report,  (London:       Institute for the Study of
 Conflict,  Feb.-Mar.  1973), p. 73.   The Institute says
 that, "(T)here is no shadow of suspicion that he [Lenin's
 confidant] might have forged the document, the authenticity
 of which, in style and content,  is regarded as beyond
 doubt by leading scholars."   It is from this document
 that the famous  remark  comes,    attributed  to  Lenin,
 that the Capitalists will sell the Communists the rope
 which the latter will use to hang them.

 into the background;  and when that  happens
 there will always be Americans who will leap
 forward with gleeful announcements that "the
 Russians  have  changed,"  and  some who will
 even   try to  take credit for having brought
 about such  "changes."  But we  should not be
 misled by tactical manoeuvres. These character-
 istics                           of Soviet policy,  like the postulate
 from which they flow, are basic to the internal
 nature  of  Soviet  power, and will  be with
 us, whether in the foreground or the background,
 until  the  internal nature  of  Soviet  power
 is changed.9
 World Domination and Mendacity
 Caspar Weinberger,  Secretary of Defense, put  it
 very simply when he said,  "I think you have to go back
 to the original  teachings  that were published at the
 time  the   Soviet Union was founded and have never been
 disputed and have never been apVnded and that is world
 domination.   It's that simple.".LV
 "Mendacity is  the  immortal  soul  of communism,"
 according to Leszek Kolakowski.   "They cannot get rid
 of  it.   The  gap between  the  reality and the facade
 is so enormous  that  the lie  has become a normal and
 natural way of life."11
 In his book, "New Lies for Old," Anatoliy Golitsyn,
 a  former KGB officer now in the West,  described the
 efforts   to update Communist doctrine and,  at the same
 time, "de-Stalinize"  the movement.   Nikita Khrushchev,
 principal  Soviet  leader at the time,   and other older
 Communist officials  "wanted  to purge themselves," he
 says, "of the taint of Stalinism and rehabilitate themselves
 in the eyes of history.  The Communist update, according
 to Golitsyn, was a reaffirmation of Lenin's dogma:
 The Manifesto produced by the Eighty-one-party
 Congress  (November  1960)  clearly  betrays
 the  influence of Lenin's  ideas and practice,

 January 6,  1961.   These two basic documents
 have  continued  to determine the  course  of
 communist policy  to the present day.    They
 explain in detail how the triumph of communism
 throughout the world is to be achieved through
 the consolidation of the economic, political,
 and military might  of  the  communist  world
 and the undermining of the unity and strength
 of the noncommunist world.  The use by communist
 parties of a variety of violent and nonviolent
 tactics is specifically authorized.  Peaceful
 coexistence  is  explicitly defined  as  "an
 intense form of class struggle between socialism
 and capitalism."   The exploitation by world
 communism of  economic,  political,   racial,
 and historical antagonisms between noncommunist
 countries is recommended. Support for "national
 liberation" movementj3throughout the Third
 World is reemphasized.
 Protracted Conflict and Warfare on the Cheap
 The  Soviet Union constantly expands  its influence
 and power throughout the world, engaging only reluctantly
 in open conventional warfare.   As a consequence,  the
 world  in this period of  "protralced conflict," to use
 the term used by Mao Tze-tung,    has entered a phase
 of unconventional,  low intensity warfare or,  as Ray
 Cline of Georgetown University calls it, "warfare on
 the cheap."
 According to R. Judson Mitchell,  the Soviets have
 maintained a "traditional preference for avoiding frontal
 conflict with the principal enemy and for the achievement
 of  ends by  flanking maneuvers  and concentration  on
 the   frings rather  than  the  center  of  the opposing
 system."`    As pointed out by Richard H.  Shultz and
 Roy Godson,  however,   "While Mitchell  is  correct, it
 is also the case...that    the Soviets employ political

 "To the danger of espionage is added active measures,"
 as President Ronald Reagan has said, "designed to subvert
 and deceive,  to  'disinform'  thg public opinion upon
 which our democracies are built."
 A number of books and articles Y~ave been published
 recently on Soviet active measures.    Active measures
 are an        integral part of Soviet diplomatic, political,
 economic and military programs  in every stage.   They

 occasion the President said the following to the assembled
 employees of the CIA:
 "...Without you,  our  Nation's      safety would be
 more vulnerable and our security fragile and endangered.
 The work you do each day is essential to the survival
 and  to the spread  of human freedom.   You  remain the
 eyes and ears of the Free World, you  are the tripwire
 over which the forces of totalitarian rule must stumble
 in their quest for global domination.
 "Though  it  sometimes  has been forgotten here in
 Washington,  the American    people  know full well  the
 importance of vital and energetic intelligence operations.
 From Nathan Hale's covert operation in the Revolutionary
 War  to  the breaking  of  the Japanese code  at Midway
 in World War  II,  America's  security and   safety have
 relied directly on the courage and collective intellect
 of her intelligence personnel.   Today, I want to stress
 to you   again that  the American people  are  thankful
 for  your  professionalism,   for  your  dedication--and
 for the personal sacrifice each of you makes in carrying
 on your work.

 2The Soviets use the term "active measures" to describe
 overt  and  covert  techniques  for  influencing  events
 and behavior in, and the actions of, foreign societies.
 Richard A.  Shultz  and Roy Godson, Dezinformatsia,  op.
 cit.,  p.  15.   This  book  is an excellent study of the
 phenomenon.    The  authors'  analysis  of  Soviet overt
 propaganda over a period of 20 years,       against which
 Soviet covert    activities  and other overt activities
 can be compared, is especially useful.

 are a part of Soviet doctrine,  strategy and day-to-day
 operations as  they are a fundamental part  of Soviet
 foreign policy.3
 An interagency group of the Executive Branch defined
 active measures as follows:
 1.  The Soviets use the term active measures
 (aktivnvve meropriyatiya)  primarily  in  an
 intelligence context.   Within that context,
 the term is used to refer to active operations
 intended to provide a policy effect, as distinct
 from  espionage  and  counterintelligence.
 But  the  Soviets do  not  limit  the  concept
 of  active measures  to intelligence    alone.
 Active measures are an unconventional adjunct
 to traditional diplomacy. They are quintessential-
 ly an offensive instrument of Soviet policy.
 Specifically,  they are intended to influence
 the policies of foreign governments,   disrupt
 relations between other nations,     undermine
 confidence in foreign leaders and institutions,
 and discredit opponents.   Active measures,
 thus,  consist of a wide range of activities,
 both overt and covert, including:
 Manipulation or control of the media.
 Written or oral disinformation.
 Use of foreign Communist parties and
 front organizations.
 Manipulation of mass organizations.
 Clandestine radiobroadcasting.
 Economic activities.
 Military operations.
 Other political influence operations.
 2.  The  range  of  activities  included  under
 active measures is broader than that covered
 by  the U.S.  term covert  action.   In American
 parlance, overt activities, such as officially
 sponsored propaganda,  actions by accredited
 diplomatic and      official  representatives,
 3As an  illustration of the scope and variety of
 this  incessant  Soviet    active measures    program even
 in  neutral,  not  totally  unfriendly countries,  such
 as Switzerland,  is the fact that the Swiss Government
 felt constrained to use these terms, to describe Soviet
 activity when  in 1983  it  closed  the Bern bureau of
 Novosti,  the  Soviet news  agency:    "disinformation,
 subversion and agitation."

 and  activities  of  friendship  and  cultural
 societies,  are automatically excluded    from
 the range of covert action.
 The  purpose  of secret  political  action,  as  in
 the case with overt propaganda, is to persuade, manipulate,
 mislead,   and deceive.    The two activities are closely
 related and overt propaganda themes are often promoted
 by covert means.    Both overt and covert active measures
 are directly related to Soviet foreign policy objectives.
 While the Soviets engage in a variety of secret operations,
 to promote their    foreign policy objectives,  special
 emphasis is placed on international front organizations,
 agent-of-influence operations and forgeries.  To understand
 what the United States is dealing with,  it is essential
 to understand  how Soviet  foreign policy is made,  how
 active measures fit in, and that the same people devise
 both.   It  is necessary,  also,  to understand the Inter-
 national Department.
 The International Department
 In  "A Study of the  International Department of
 the CPSU:        Key  to  Soviet  Policy,"  Leonard  Shapiro,
 professor of political science, London School of Economics
 and Political Science, said:
 One is, of course, used to these theories
 of conflicting groups inside the Soviet hierarchy,
 pulling in different directions.   Journalists
 love them and academics are not always immune
 from  their  fatal  charm.   It  is,  however,
 alarming to   find  so       erroneous  a  notion of
 how the  Soviet  Union conducts  its   foreign
 policy prevailing at what appears to be the
 highest government  level.   At  the basis of
 this misconception, which could have serious
 consequences    if  it       should become current
 among those who are responsible for the conduct
 of  United  States  foreign policy   vis-a-vis
 the Soviet Union, lies the failure to understand

 the role played by the International Department
 of  the Central  Committee  of  t 9e Communist
 Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).       6
 In  his  study,  Shapiro  traces  the  evolution of
 the International Department from the Foreign Affairs
 Department  formed  in the Central Committee after the
 demise in 1943 of the Comintern.    In 1957, the Foreign
 Department was  divided  into    three  departments,  one
 for Relations with Communist and Workers       Parties of
 Socialist Countries,  controlling  the bloc;  a second
 for Cadres Abroad,  linked to the KGB,   and  responsible
 for instructing overseas cells of the CPSU (cells within
 missions abroad)  and maintaining a register of members
 of the CPSU overseas,  the latter  being virtually an
 intelligence  function;  and,  finally,  the core of the
 Foreign Affairs Department,    the present International
 Department.      From the beginning to this day, this department
 has been headed by   Bori% N.  Ponomarev,  a former high
 official of the Comintern.

 the  "Russian  temperament"   and Czarist   antecedents.
 "One suspects,"    he said, "that   if Cuba had been the

 absorbed,  as explained elsewhere herein,   by the Inter-

 have likewise been largely incorporated into what the
 oviets call "active measures."

 departments of the Central Committee.  It has considerable
 resources  of  its  own and can and does  draw on those
 of other departments as well and the research institutes
 attached  to   the  Soviet Academy.    It  is  responsible
 for,  among other   things,  publishing Problems of Peace
 and Socialism,  the English language edition of which
 is called World Marxist Review, official Soviet ideological
 publication for foreign instruction.   It also controls
 the international Soviet front organizations.
 The International Department surpasses in importance
 and authority the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which,
 according to Shapiro, "has no muscle whatever."  Shapiro
 goes on to say:
 It may be added that it is normal Soviet
 practice to maintain in every branch or sphere
 of central government a system of dual control:
 an  appropriate  department  of  the  Central
 Committee to  co-ordinate  intelligence   and
 to  brief the Politburo,  and  in  general to
 exercise  tutelage,  if  not authority,  over
 the  relevant ministry or government agency.
 The  emergence in 1943 of the Foreign Affairs
 Department of the Central Committee was thus
 fully in accord with the established pattern
 of Soviet political practice.
 It seems  therefore beyond dispute that
 the  International Department is the element
 in the Soviet decision-making process which
 gathers  information on foreign policy, briefs
 the Politburo,   and thereby exercises,  subject
 to the Politburo, decisive influence on Soviet
 foreign policy.   In fact,  Ponomarev stated
 the position quite accurately when he said:
 "All  the  fundamental  problems  of     foreign
 policy come under the scrutiny of the Central
 Committee  of  the  CPSU and its  leadership
 where  they  are  examined  and comprehensive
 decisions  are taken--in    the mainstream of
 the  Ie~ninist  international  strategy of the
 CPSU.

 A Unified Foreign Policy
 Shapiro  sums  up by saying,  "that Soviet foreign
 policy,  so far from being torn by party-state rivalry,
 is a unified, co-ordinated whole in which, after Brezhnev,
 the leading role belongs to the International Department
 of the Central Committee of  the CPSU,  which attempts
 to bring  into  line both state foreign policy and the
 part which foreign communist parties are expected to
 play in the policy as a whole."
 It  was  Sun  T'zu,  the  ancient  Chinese strategist
 (and  tactician) who  said, "To  fight  and  conquer in
 all your battles  is not supreme excellence;  supreme
 excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance
 without fighting."    "Be subtle!", Sun T'zu said, "Be
 subtle! and use your spies in every kind of business."
 The Soviets are known to be students of Sun T'zu;  it
 is  almost as if the Chinese genius,  for his part, was
 talking about Soviet active measures twenty-five hundred
 years before their time.
 James Clavell describes the views of his subject,
 Sun T'zu, as follows:
 Sun T'zu believed that the moral strength
 and intellectual faculty of man were decisive
 in war, and that if these were properly applied
 war  could  be  waged  with certain  success.
 Never to be undertaken thoughtlessly or reck-
 lessly,  war was  to be preceded by measures
 designed to make it easy to win.   The master
 conqueror  frustrated his  enemy's plans and
 broke up his alliances. He created cleavages
 between sovereign and minister,    superiors
 and inferiors, commanders and subordinates.
 His  spies and agents were active everywhere,
 gathering  information,  sowing dissension,
 and  nurturing  subversion.   The  enemy was
 isolated and demoralized;  his will to resist
 broken.   Thus  without  battle  his  army was
 conquered, his  cities   taken and his  state
 overthrown.   Only when the enemy could not
 be overcome by they e means was there recourse
 to armed force....

 According  to Clavell,  Sun  T'zu  himself put  it
 this way:
 The  skillful leader subdues the enemy's
 troops  without  any  fighting;    he  captures
 their cities without laying siege      to them;
 he overthrows        their  kingdom without lengthy
 operations in    the  field.   With his forces
 intact he disputes the mastery of the empire,
 and   thus,  w thout losing a man,       his triumph
 is complete.'3
 Parties, Insurgents and Fronts
 In    their  study      of  that     distinctly  Soviet
 phenomenon--the  International Department--Shultz and
 Godson say that,  in addition to its other functions,
 the  ID  is        responsible  for  "planning, coordinating,
 and conducting active measures."   "The latter function,"
 they point out,  "includes administering,  funding,  and
 coordinating the activities of well over a dozen inter-
 national  front organizations."                                   The  ID also carries
 out active measures through its liaison with non-ruling
 Communist parties and     revolutionary movements14  and
 the non-governmental organizations they, in turn, control.
 Through international meetings, representatives stationed
 abroad,  and  the monthly   journal,  Problems  of  Peace
 and  Socialism,  according  to  Shultz  and  Godson, the
 ID   communicates official  instructions and guidelines
 to   foreign Communist parties,  insurgent    movements,
 and front organizations.
 Soviet Front Groups Abroad
 The  Soviet      Union  in conducting active measures
 abroad employs numerous mechanisms, one of the principal
 mechanisms being  the  international front group.    The
 largest of  these, as well as the most active,  is the
 World Peace Council (WPC).   Foreign communist parties,
 which are of course also directed by the ID,     usually
 provide the cadres  for  the national  sections of the

 international  fronts.   For example,  the United States
 Peace Council  (USPC),  the American section of the WPC,
 is largely managed by the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA).
 The  ID thus  runs multiple lines  of control to carry
 out  its policies,  in this particular  instance,  that
 is  to say,  with the USPC,  it does so (a)  by means of
 its direction of   the WPC,  of which the USPC,  is the
 U.S. section; (b)  through its supervision of the CPUSA
 whose officials form the cadre of the USPC; and, finally,
 (c) via KGB clandestine contacts where secrecy is indicated
 or quite openly,   for that matter,    w~cre the Soviets
 believe they can dispense with secrecy.
 "Soviet control  of  the World Peace Council  and
 the other international Communist fronts  is maintained
 both through the   financing and  the personnel of the
 organizations,"    according  to  Herbyrt  Romerstein, a
 student of Soviet activities abroad.l  The KGB's support
 of active measures campaigns is part of the traditional
 Communist concept "to combine legal and   illegal work"
 and at times KGB officers take active part, under cover,
 at  open meetings of  the fronts,  as has been the case
 in  recent  "peac "  cpn ,rences  abroad manipulated by
 the Soviet Union.
 16Theoretically the KGB is a governmental organization
 but is  in effect a department of the CC, CPSU, working
 f9 close coordination with the ID and IID.

 When American groups work with and jointly sponsor
 conferences  with  Soviet  organizations,   such as the
 Institute of  the  U.S.A. and Canada  (IUSAC),  they are
 dealing with   an  entity charged  by the CPSU with an
 active measures  (as well as an intelligence)  mission.
 The entity is closely associated with the KGB and directed
 by the  ID.   Two of the  three directors of the IUSAC
 have  intelligence backgrounds,  one being a covert KGB
 officer  and  the other a military  intelligence  (GRU)
 officer.   KGB and GRU officers  attended the   "peace"

 Transmission Belts
 Lenin was given to calling front groups "transmission
 belts"   to the masses.   Something other  than what  it
 appears  to be,  a front group,  or  "transmission belt,"
 to use Lenin's   jargon,      joins together Communists and
 non-Communists,  the former manipulating the     latter,
 in an ostensibly non-Communist activity.       Moreover,
 although millions of people are aware of Soviet control
 of certain front groups, many otherwise informed people
 apparently are not.   Many apparently informed people
 on the other hand,  aware of Soviet control of a given
 front,  seem not to understand what that fact actually
 means or, if they do understand, seem not to be concerned.
 A case  in point  is  the American "peace" movement,  in
 which the USPC and CPUSA itself are deeply involved.
 On January 4, 1983, Bruce Kimmel, a member of the Communist
 Party,  USA,  wrote the  following      in the Daily World,
 the Party's newspaper:
 The Communist Party has played and continues
 to      play      an  active  role  in  the  U.S. peace
 movement.   Right now Party members are active
 in literally hundreds of local peace organiza-
 tions.  The Communist Party USA--like Communist
 parties  around     the  world--has  always  been
 and will    continue  to      be    an  active fighter
 in the struggle for peace.   My Party's peace
 activities    have  indeed served the       interest
 of the Soviet people--because their             desire
 for FT ace is identical to that of the U.S. peo-
 ple.
 The Desire for Peace
 Much is said about the desire of the Soviet Union
 and its front groups for peace.
 Lenin was quite candid when he wrote:
 "Socialists  cannot,  without  ceasing
 to be socialists, be opposed to all war. ..social-
 ists                                  have never been, nor can they ever be,
 opposed  to  revolutionary wars."22    "(T)he

 Softening Up the Bourgeoisie
 In         1922  Lenin was  crystal  clear  when  he    wrote
 to Yuri Chicherin,  his     foreign commissar:    "You and
 I  have both     fought  against pacifism as   a programme
 for  the     revolutionary proletarian party.   That much
 is clear.   But who has ever denied the use of pacifists
 by that party to soften up the enemy, the bourgeoisie?"   ...
 "we  consider    it  our  duty  as   businessmen  to  support
 (even       if  the odds are 10,000  to2 )  the pacifists in
 the other, i.e., bourgeois camp..."
 According  to       Stanislav  Levchenko, a  former KGB
 active measures case officer now working against Communism
 in the West, "Soviet overt and covert propaganda organiza-
 tions                          employ t  least  15,000  people  (in  the Soviet
 Union alone). "2g     The funds available for active measures
 are enormous-and not subjected to scrutiny by the Soviet
 parliament.     To implement Communist Party directives,
 according  to Levchenko,  the KGB    recruits     "agents of
 influence"  in foreign countries,  penetrating by this
 means       foreign poltical parties, public organizations
 and the mass-media.'
 Agents of Influence

 his "moral obligation to the free world."
 The not entirely unpopular  "mirror  image" concept,
 discussed elsewhere, would logically envisage parliamentary
 oversight of the KGB and GRU by the appropriate committees
 of the Supreme Soviet.   Supreme Soviet control of these
 intelligence services would,  of course,  be exercised

 linked in planning and execution.   They encompass both
 overt  and clandestine means.   Agents of influence are
 one  of  these  elements--a most  important  one  in  the
 active measures panoply.   An agent of  influence may
 or may not be a major source of intelligence--his main
 purpose is the manipulation of persons and events toward
 Soviet goals.   Such "a person uses his or her position,
 influence, power, and credibility to promote the objectives

 of"  his  sponsor.      He may be a controlled agent,  a
 "trusted  contact"  or  one  of  a  number  of "unwitting
 but manipulated individuals."-I0
 "Moscow utilizes   agents   of influence," according
 to Godson and     Shult;7j "as one element of a carefully
 orchestrated effort"    known as kombinatsia,  combining
 various   elements    from  its  active  measures arsenal.
 Kombinatsia combines  "various agents of  influence  (at

 Terrorism as an Active Measure
 The scope of the responsibilities of the International
 Department,  as pointed out above,   reaches across the
 spectrum from the 3d3evelopment  of  international  overt
 propaganda themes,     in close coordination with the
 International          Information Department (IID),  to building
 and guiding the operational network of what Cline and
 Alexander  term the  "international  infrastructure of
 terrorism."            "It  has consistently promoted widespread
 revolutionary violence,"  they say,  "even while taking
 care  to project  the  illusory  image  that          the  Sovi
 was abiding by the spirit of peaceful coexistence.
 In  its efforts to expand its  influence throughout
 the world,  the  Soviet Union undertakes still another
 active measure,   its  exploitation of terrorism,          either
 by  supporting  independent movements or by initiating
 its   own terrorist operations.   Terrorism has            "become

 an  indispensable tactical  and  strategic Mol  in the
 Soviet struggles for power and influence.      Its aim
 seems  to be  to achieve  strategic  ends  where the use
 of conventional armed forces is considered "'nappropriate,
 ineffective, too risky or too difficult."3?
 Cline and Alexander have this warning:
 Unless Americans become more conscious
 of  the broad  strategic  dangers implicit in
 the patterns of contemporary terrorism and
 become more skillful in deterring or countering
 terrorist operations,  the next two decades
 in  this  century   will be  catastrophic  for
 worldwide security interests  of  the United
 States  and  its friends  and  allies  abroad.
 This subtle assault on the values and defensive
 strengths of our society is not well understood,
 and  its  strategic  implications for  liberal
 democracies are only beginning to be explored.37
 "Indeed,"  according  to Darrell M.  Trent,  former
 Deputy Secretary of Transportation,  "if we do not allow
 ourselves   to  think  of our  struggle against terrorism
 as warfare,     we shall surely fail to -meet one of the
 gravest challenges of this generation."     In the words
 of Susan Weaver,     moreover,  "the first political task
 at  hand  on the       issue of terrorism is to cut the idea
 of  terrorism loose  from the connection it now has  in
 many Western liberal minds with notions     of national
 liberation and         social  justice;  only then can terror
 be viewed plainly as a crime and a threat.   But their
 second task  is to establish another kind of connection
 and  make  people  see        terrorism not as just a random
 occurrence 9but        as a tactic in the Soviet war against
 "
 the West.
 Yet, as Paul Henze, former National Security official,
 says, "It is in the nature of the operations that support
 terrorism that very little proof of  their origin is
 going to be produced--all the more so when Soviet secret
 operatives are doing it.   They are not only the world's
 most experienced  in clandestine techniques;  they work

 invent terrorism any more than the Mafia invented crime.
 Both simply capitalize on their relationship in remarkably
 parallel ways."40
 Marx  himself  observed  thifii "violence  itself is
 an economic   (form of)  power.       Active measures are
 thus usually but not always the "quiet war."
 Terrorism was  employed by the Russian Communists
 very early.   During the Russian  insurrection of 1905,
 Lenin instructed the Combat Committee of St. Petersburg
 Bolsheviks to provide    "recipes for making bombs" and
 "begin military  training"..."to  kill  a  spy  or blow
 up a police    station...raid a bank"  so that hundreds
 could be trained who tomorrow will "be leading hundreds
 of thousands."42 According to Romerstein, such "tactics
 were developed by both the Communists  and     tae Nazis
 in Germany during the 1920s and early 1930s."      Each
 learned from and emulated the other. Both used terrorism
 as  a means of seizing power and both "employed state
 terror  as4en  instrument  of  their rule after  coming
 to power.
 Romerstein sums up as follows: "Thus for Communism
 no less than for Nazism, terrorism has long been accepted
 in  ideology and practice as a central tactic of the
 struggle for power and an essential method of rule.""
 Assassination too is encompassed in the term active
 measures.   Part of the broader concept of "wet affairs,"

 (mokevve dela)  to use the KGB term,  whereby blood is
 shed as  in sabotage,  assassination often appears to
 fall  into  the province  of Communist  surrogates  for
 carrying out the actual murders.      There  is  strong
 evidence,   examined especially by Clair  Sterling and
 Paul Henze,  mentioned above,  that the Bulgarian secret
 service plotted  the attempt on the life of Pope John
 Paul  II.   It  is inconceivable,  Western experts say,
 that the Bulgarian service could have entertained such
 a plan without at least the early knowledge and approval
 of its Soviet control mechanism.
 Deception
 The overall philosophy of deception is an important
 part of Soviet global strategy and it too is incorporated
 into  the  active measures program.47   "The number one
 theme of Soviet deception," according to John Lenczowski
 of the National  Security Council staff,  is that  "the
 Soviets  are  not Communists anymore"  that they do not,
 in  fact,    have unlimited      objectives and  that a
 "spheres-of-influence" arrangement  is possible between
 the U. S. and the USSR.   Soviet disinformation, he says,
 attempts  to promote  the  impression that "hawks" and
 "doves" fgist in the Kremlin--both ideologues and prag-
 matists.
 46An earlier "active measures" operation, although not
 known at that time by the name, was the Soviet assassination
 of Leon Trotsky in Mexico City.   Soviet "wet affairs"
 are carried out by the 13th Department of the KGB First
 Chief Directorate,  the  "executive action" component.
 It carries out joint operations with the 9th (or Soviet
 emigres)  Department of  the  same  directorate.   "Wet
 Affairs," Survey,  (London:   London Institute for Defense
 j9d Strategic Studies, Winter, 1983), p. 71.
 "Deception is a singularly important aspect of Soviet
 strategy.   It  is also a national talent  in the Soviet
 Union.   It is an integral part of this planning process."-

 Forgery
 The  story of active measures would be woefully
 incomplete without mention of Soviet forgery operations.
 They too are an aspect of disinformation and deception.
 Forgeries, of course,         are documents which,  although
 false,  are crafted by the KGB to appear genuine.   They
 are often falsified or altered versions of U.S. official
 publications  or  communications;  on occasion,     they are
 totally fabricated.
 Forgeries are usually intended for specific targets,
 such as a particular foreign government but often are
 directed at the people of an entire country or region.
 Forgeries, as with other classes of clandestine political
 warfare operations,   are conducted by Service A,  the
 First Chief Directorate of the KGB.
 Fortunately,  much of  the effect of many Soviet
 forgeries  has  been neutralized by quick and efficient
 response by the CIA and FBI in informing the audience
 of  the  results  of  their  analysis  of  the motivation
 for the operation and the errors of the forgery itself.
 Unfortunately,    as  with many    Soviet  operations,  the
 truth has difficulty  reaching all the recesses where
 the original Communist  untruth has penetrated.         The
 lie often outruns the truth.
 Primary targets of Soviet forgeries are the North
 Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO)  and the U.S.  itself.
 Third World countries are also targetted by the Soviets.
 The usual propaganda themes are the basis of the forgery
 motive:   the  United States  is  racist,  a war monger,
 imperialist,   and manipulative of Third World and NATO
 governments.   The  forgery is often accepted--although
 often,  to  their  credit,  not--by the target audiences,
 publicized locally and picked up and replayed by the
 Soviet media.
 Although many Soviet forgeries show an increasing
 level  of  sophistication some  forgery operations are
 poorly--or hastily--assembled and  show carelessness.
 Nonetheless,  forgeries  are  an especially   ernicious
 and virulent form of Soviet active measures.
 4$
 The Two Superpowers Theory
 Soviet  active measures,  according  to Lenczowski,
 follow the open propaganda theme of "the two superpowers."
 49Details of Soviet forgeries are contained in Congressional
 reports,  including,  House Permanent Select Committee
 on  Intelligence  (HPSCI),  "Soviet  Covert  Action  (The
 Forgery Offensive)," and HPSCI, "Soviet Active Measures."

 Lenczowski  is  one of a number of observers of Soviet
 behavior to see a hidden meaning behind "the two super-
 powers"  concept.                        This  theme,  in the terms of Soviet
 strategic deception, promotes the idea that the U.S. and
 the USSR are both "superpowers," the Soviet Union being
 placed  at  once on the  same level  of development as
 the United States,    a primary goal of Soviet propaganda.
 This  idea at the same time promotes the "mirror image"
 view of East-West relations (sometimes called the "Samantha.
 concept)  that we,  the people  and  leaders of the two
 countries, are really just the same after all.  Logically
 if we find nuclear war "unthinkable," this theory holds,
 the Soviets  also  find  it so when in fact the Soviets
 have developed over  the years a complex doctrine on
 nuclear warfare including extensive and expensive civil
 defense  planning.   Plainly,  rather  than  finding   it
 unthinkable,  they have given nuclear war a great deal
 of thought.  Finally, the "two superpowers" idea morally
 equates the two countries and their systems, a perception
 which Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S.  Ambassador to the United
 Nations, finds  so pernicious and the errors of which
 she has struggled against so tirelessly at the U.N. and
 elsewhere.
 Gaining Credibility
 Other  observers     see  similar  Soviet basic themes
 gaining credibility among analysts in the West.  Although
 there  may be  some  substance  in  these  themes,  these
 observers suspect they are the "product of a deliberate
 and persistent Soviet disinformation campaign," according
 to Joseph D. Douglass, 5dlr., a specialist on the subject
 of  Soviet deception.      Prominent among these themes
 are:
 * The Soviet Union will change.
 * There are "differences" among Soviet leaders.
 * U.S.-Soviet "convergence" is possible.
 * No attention should be paid to official Communist
 ideology in the Soviet Union.--it is not relevant.
 * The Soviet Union is defense oriented and threatens
 no one;  it does  not seek strategic sup9fiority
 nor does it want first strike capability.

 Dangerous Reefs
 No  stranger       to  deception  operations, himself,
 on April 5, 1940, Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda
 of Nazi Germany,         gave a secret briefing to selected
 German journalists during which he is quoted as saying:
 Up to now we have succeeded in leaving
 the   enemy  in    the dark  concerning Germany's
 real  goal,  just  as before 1932 our domestic
 foes never   saw where we were going or that
 our oath of  legality was  just a trick.   We
 wanted to come to power legally,  but we did
 not want to use power legally.... They could
 have suppressed us.   They could have arrested
 a couple of us  in 1925      and  that would have
 been that,  the end.   No,  they let us through
 the danger  zone.   That's exactly how it was
 in  foreign policy too....    In 1933 a French
 premier     ought to  have  said  (and  if  I  had
 been  the   French premier  I  would    have said
 it) :  "The new Reich Chancellor        is the man
 who wrote Mein  Kampf,     which  says  this   and
 that.   This man cannot be     tolerated in our
 vicinity.  Either he disappears or we march!"
 But they didn't do  it.     They left us alone
 and  let us  slip through the risky zone,      and
 we were  able  to  sail   around  all   dangerous
 reefs.  And when we were done, and well arme91
 better than they, then they started the war.

 The  valuable lesson,  learned  from World War  II
 about  the Nazis,  unfortunately was lost with resp Ht
 to the Soviets.   The "risky zone" is long since past.
 Very little has been written about deception operations
 because they are among the most closely guarded secrets
 of  intelligence  services and general  staffs. Since
 World War  II  the Soviets have,  unheralded, developed
 a sophisticated and well coordinated system of military
 and political   deception. The Russian word maskirovka
 includes not only military "camouflage and covert maneuvers,
 but also political  deception desigpggd to protect the
 secrecy of military operations..."       Jiri Valenta,
 a student of Soviet affairs, makes an interesting point
 with a certain irony when he writes that, "In the case
 of  [the  Soviet  invasion  of]  Czechoslovakia,  [Prime
 Minister Alexander] Dubcek admitted to being surprised
 and deceived.   But  this may have been due more to his,
 and   some of  his  colleagues', political  naivete  a99
 self-deception than to skillful        Soviet strategem."
 This  observation   could  well  apply  to  many  cases of
 "successful"   Soviet deception operations; naivete and
 self-deception play a very large role in Soviet schemes.
 As Lenin told Felix Dzerzhinsky, head of the Chek~
 the               then KGB,  "Tell  them what they want      to hear."
 Within the  scope of strategic deception and important
 aspects  of active measures  are Soviet disinformation
 (dezinformatsia)  operations.   One of the many purposes
 of disinfortion, of course, is to hide Soviet strategic
 intentions.
 54As has been pointed out elsewhere, the Communists and
 Rzis learned from and emulated each other.

 Paul B.  Henze,  a former high government official
 and    a  longtime  student  of  Soviet  behavior  has  this
 to say about disinformation:
 It  is  impossible  to  draw a clear boundary
 between misinformation and jinformation.
 The  two categories are part of a continuum
 which in Soviet practice extends from distortion
 to  total  falsification,  misrepresentation
 and  forgery.   All     parts of  this  spectrum
 are interconnected and consciously manipulated
 to achieve desired results.  Thus false informa-
 tion planted abroad and seemingly originating
 from  sources that  have  no  connection   with
 the USSR or Eastern Europe is fed back into
 the Soviet propaganda system,  cited in the
 Soviet press  as    authoritative confirmation
 of views which the CPSU propagandists want
 to  spread,  and  then it  is disgorged by TASS
 and Novosti    in their international services.
 Thus  spewed  out  again  into  international
 information channels, it becomes self-confirming.
 Sometimes  the process  goes  through several
 cycles.    Not only  current  news,  but  even
 scholarly research and intelligence are influ-
 enced.
 To those familiar with Soviet techniques
 and objectives, such operations are relatively
 easy  to  identify,  but  often  difficult  to
 prove.    To accomplish their purposes,  Soviet
 propagandists and KGB operatives do not rely
 only  on  the  credulity  and    predisposition
 to believe of Western and Third World journalists,
 writers   and  intellectuals.    They  exploit
 the  readiness  of  reporters                to  accept cash
 or other  favours   in  return for doing their
 bidding.   In Soviet usage,     dezinformatsiva
 means deliberately concocted, falsely attributed
 or distorted information brought to the surface
 through   ostensibly    non-Soviet               channels or
 outlets.   Of  course,  the more      legtimate
 (and unwitting) these are, the better.

 Soviet  propaganda  themes  appear  at  increasing

 U.S.,  in print and on the screens of motion picture

 disinformation   issue, encompasses      the problem of the
 misuse of words and terms by the Western media,      often
 spontaneously,  often  in  response  to Soviet guidance.
 "Peace"  and  "democracy"  are words misappropriated by
 the Communists long ago.   More recently, Afghan freedom
 fighters are termed "rebels," and terrorists are called
 members of "liberation movements." Murders are perpetrated
 by  "right wing death squads" never by left-wino death
 squads,  although    sometimes  by  "guerrillas,"  and  so
 forth.  Some of these semantic twists are Soviet inspired,
 some possibly not but serve Soviet objectives nonetheless.
 It      is known that the Soviet intelligence services
 and  their  surrogate  services  in Communist countries
 devote considerable    resources  to  the penetration of
 foreign media.   Foreign  nationals  are  recruited  as
 "agents  of  influence,"    working  clandestinely under
 Bloc direction or to serve as collaborators with Bloc
 guidance,   to make things   happen as the Soviets want
 them to happen.
 In      the  last  few years,  such  Soviet  operations
 have  surfaced  in the press  in a number of countries
 from Scandinavia, France and the Netherlands to Southeast
 Asia.  It is presumed that others have not been publicized.
 The practice  is widespread even   if publicity of the
 practice is not.   Nevertheless, numerous representatives
 of the American media have said publicly that for various
 reasons  their  own profession in the United States is
 free  from such penetration.   It  is  truly  remarkable
 that  the U.S.  armed  forces  and  intelligence services
 (again,  based on public records)  have been penetrated
 as have American high technology firms and other KGB/GRU
 targets,  yet,  although a target almost everywhere in
 the world and   of unquestioned  importance   especially

 on  the American scene,  the media in this country have
 not been  targetted by   the  Soviets.   One can only ask
 why?
 Foreign Broadcasting
 While  the     IID directs Soviet overt  propaganda
 abroad, including overt radio as well as press activitfts,
 the ID manages Soviet clandestine radio programming.
 To complement their overt foreign language inter-
 national  radio broadcasts,  the Soviets maintain a sig-
 nificant clandestine broadcasting capability as well,
 still another aspect of active measures.   For example,
 the National Voice of  Iran,  ostensibly broadcasting
 from within  that  country, is  the  official  voice of
 the Tudeh, or Communist,  Party of  Iran and actually
 transmits from  Radio Baku   in  the  Soviet  Caucasus.
 The  same transmitters also broadcast official Soviet
 programs  in Iranian languages.   During  the   1979-81
 hostage   crisis in  Teheran,  this  clandestine Soviet
 radio station transmitted false information and inflammatory
 rhetoric  in contrast  to  official Radio Moscow which
 was on occasion cautious in its coverage. The National
 Voice of Iran even replayed S6p2vipt KGB-inspired disinfor-
 mation from other countries.
 Even Sports
 The combined Olympic  team fielded by the Soviet
 Union,  when  it  attends  the Olympics,  is largely made
 up of professional  sports   organizations,  the Dinamo
 Sporting Club and the Central Army Sports Club  (ZSKA).

 Radio Baku and other Soviet radio broadcasting efforts

 He also wrote of the electronic jamming of U. S. broadcasting
 to  the East  at a cost  to  the Soviets of  twice what
 the U.S.  spends on the programming.   Amidst all the
 East-West "wars," there is this "radio war"--the struggle
 of the West to pierce the iron curtain electronically,
 to get the truth into the Soviet Bloc and the herculean
 efforts  of the  latter  to obliterate the truth,  quite
 literally.

 The  former belongs to the KGB.   The latter,  the ZSKA,
 is  part of  Soviet  military  intelligence    (GRU), the
 military   counterpart  of  the  KGB.   These  two sports
 organizations   are  in strong   competition,  as  indeed
 are their parent organizations, the KGB and GRU, themselves.
 In the Soviet Union, sports and athletes are dedicated
 to the enhancement of the party and the state.  Moreover,
 the  special  services  of  athletes  and  sportsmen  are
 put to use extensively by the intelligence organizations,
 the KGB and GRU.   The Spetsnaz, Soviet military special
 forces--the Soviet "Green Berets," if you will--provide
 the athletes for the ZSKA.   The KGB has its own special
 forces,  a counterpart to the Spetsnaz,    which supplies
 athletes for the Dinamo Sporting Club.
 These troops, the Spetsnaz and the KGB's own version,
 are an elite fighting force devoted in wartime to operations
 behind enemy lines, diversionary tactics and the assassina-
 tion of  foreign  leaders.   Their mission also embraces
 intelligence  collection  (including  reconnaissance),
 deception,   sabotage,  terrorism and guerrilla warfare.
 The mission of  the GRU is essentially military, while
 that of the KGB is political and economic. It is from
 these  special  forces       that the Dinamo and ZSKA sports
 competitors come.
 Personnel  of these Soviet unconventional  forces
 receive  familiarization    tours  abroad  as  members  of
 Soviet  sports  teams.   Soviet athletes are not merely
 winning medals when competing abroad; they are preparing
 for clandestine activities     or  unconventional warfare
 roles;  in effect,  "casing"  their target.    It might be
 added that Soviet strategic plans include the employment
 of  elements  of  "underground" Communist parties in the
 West in support of Soviet unconventional units in time
 of conflict.64
 Regarding athletes in the Spetsnaz, a former profes-
 sional Soviet army officer had this to say:
 The  Soviet      Union  needs  prestige,  and
 one way of providing this is by winning Olympic
 medals. The country needs an organization
 with  draconian  discipline  to  squeeze  the
 maximum effort out of the athletes.   At the
 same  time, the  Spetsnaz needs athletes   of
 the highest caliber who have the opportunity
 to  visit  areas       in which  they may have   to
 operate in time of war.

 The athletes,  for  their part,  need op-
 portunities  for  training and need to belong
 to an organization that can reward them lavishly
 for athletic achievement, give them apartments
 and   cars, award commissioned  ranks    in  the
 forces  and arrange trips outside the Soviet
 Union.
 The Spetsnaz thus provides a focal point
 for the interests of state prestige, military
 intelligence and individuals who have dedicated
 themselves to sports.
 The  ZSKA  sends its  athletes  all  over
 the world,  and  the  fact that these athletes
 have military ranks is not hidden.    The KGB,
 which  also has  the  role  of   assassinating
 enemy VIPs, has  its   own  similar  organiza-
 tion....                                       They are ordinary but    carefully
 selected  and    trained  soldiers,  top-grade
 athletes,   foreigners    and,  at  the head  of
 all gf these,          the professional intelligence
 men.
 Soviet athletes are   thus carefully  selected and
 very well  cared  for.   In a word,  they are  "special;"
 members of an elite service.    Athletes too are elements
 in the overall scheme of Soviet active measures.

 THE WESTERN RESPONSE
 The Ultimate Weapon
 According to Sidney Hook, the philosopher:
 (T)he              ultimate  weapon  of  the West  is
 not   the  hydrogen  bomb  or              any other  super
 weapon but         the passion for   freedom and the
 willingness  to  die for it  if          necessary.
 Once  the Kremlin is               convinced   that we will
 use this weapon to prevent it from subjugating
 the world to       its will, we will have the best
 assurance of peace.   Once the Kremlin believes
 that  this  willingness  to  fight             for  freedom
 at  all  costs  is  absent,  that              it  has been
 eroded by neutralist fears and pacifist wishful
 thinking, it will blackmail the free countries
 of  the world  into capitulation and                succeed
 where Hitler failed.
 Our      inability to comprehend  Soviet           strategy  is
 connected to our misunderstanding of Soviet objectives.
 Sir   James  Goldsmith cites  the Carthaginians          of old
 who,  although good warriors, were essentially a trading
 people.  "They never understood the Romans," he says,
 "who were military and imperial." We too are a mercantile
 people, like the ancient Carthaginians,  Sir James says,
 and we  seem incapable of understanding the            Soviets.
 To combat Soviet  strategy,   the disinformation content
 of  Soviet  active measures,  according  to  Sir         James,
 rather  than  restrictions  and controls,  "we need more
 information, more   facts.  We need better journalism,"
 he says.2   The light of truth, once again,  is the best
 defense.
 To quote Brian Crozier        again,  "The security of
 a  nation-State or  of  an  alliance  is  concerned with
 territorial  integrity,  ntional    sovereignty and the
 defense of a way of life."'  He goes on to say:
 It is not enough to know and understand:
 it  is      also  necessary  to  act.   In  a  world
 war fought largely by means other than military,

 the  search for  security cannot be confined
 to an analysis of military and weapons capabili-
 ties, useful though these may be in themselves.
 Nor  is  a purely defensive  posture  enough.
 Containment  has brought us  to the brink of
 defeat   in World War  Three.   A more active
 policy is required if we are to survive.
 How can  the West,  especially  the United States,
 deal with the Soviet active measures offensive?   Our
 system is such that we cannot respond in like terms.
 According to Rett Ludwikowski:
 Moscow  has  not  attempted  to  abolish
 the Catholic Church or  the relics of private
 ownership  in  Poland,  aware  of  the  Poles'
 strong attachment   to  these  institutions.
 It  is  characteristic  of Soviet Policy that
 (in both foreign and internal affairs) Russians
 try to  insinuate themselves into places they
 find weak.    But when  they encounter  strong
 opponents  and     the prospect of swift victory
 seems uncertain, they will withdraw.
 Accordingly, the  Russians  will   never
 attempt to attack the United States directly
 except  in some  tremendous  crisis.   Rather,
 they will endeavor to weaken America's inter-
 national position, to assist America's opponents,
 to        incite unrest among America's neighbors,
 and  to  spread  communist  ideas  among Third
 World countries.
 The Best Hope
 "The best hope that the free world remains free,"
 according to M.R.D. Foot of the University of Manchester,
 "lies in an efficient, constitutional  freedom-loving--but
 adequately secret--CIA and FBI."?   Our       intelligence
 and counterintelligence capabilities must be strengthened.
 Another  important part  of  the answer  is  to continue
 to  illuminate  Soviet and  Bloc activities  in  the West,
 to  subject  to the  light of day the     realm of Soviet
 active measures.     In the East,  again the prescription

 late in preparedness;  too late in uniting all possible
 forces  for resistance;  too late in standing with one's

 This small book  is  really two small books.   In
 addition to an overview of Soviet active measures employed
 by the Soviets in the "quiet war" they are waging against
 the West--the  first part  of  the book--a description
 is presented  in  this,  the   second part,  of a Soviet
 propaganda theme that has      found its way into Western
 thought.   It is persistent and pernicious and has taken
 root deeply.
 A number of prominent authors have explained the
 truth of the matter and some inklings have even emerged
 in the popular press.   By and large,  nonetheless,  the
 myth--the  lie--remains fixed  in the minds of scholars
 and the general public alike.

 Of Lies and Myths
 President John Kennedy once said,
 "The great enemy of  truth is very
 often                 not  the  lie--deliberate,
 contrived  and dishonest,  but  the
 myth--persistent,   persuasive  and
 unrealistic."
 To promote  a myth--"persistent,  persuasive  and
 unrealistic"--in a "deliberate, contrived and dishonest"
 fashion, is of course a lie, as well, and a more dangerous
 lie at that.   This is the way of the Soviet system.
 The Left and The Right
 For  many decades,  it  has  been  an objective of
 communist propaganda  to     characterize  communism and
 fascism,   especially Nazism,  the  German variant,  as
 at opposite ends of the political spectrum.   The horrors
 of Nazism--totalitarianism,  racism,     armed aggression
 and the countless other evils associated with Hitler
 and an armed and rampaging Germany--are placed on the
 right.   Socialism,  peace,  progress and social justice,
 embodied in the Soviet Union which fought and destroyed
 fascism, are on the left.   "The myth of the left-right
 syndrome",  according    to Richard Vetterli and William
 E.  Fort,  "has helped   to  perpetuate  the  belief  that
 communism and fascism are dissimilar."1
 This communist theme has been uncritically accepted
 by millions  and given currency by huge quantities of
 unwitting assistance, especially by Western intellectuals.
 Its promoters, in communist circles, now in the second
 generation,  can claim,  fairly or not, fabulous success.
 They have created or helped to create this great myth,
 helpful to communism.
 Although  not  a major  Soviet  propaganda  theme,
 according to Stanislav Levchenko, a former Soviet intel-
 ligence officer who specialized in KGB "active measures"
 operations, the concept of a dichotomy along communist/Nazi,
 left/right  lines  has  long been promoted by the CPSU.
 As  such,  Levchenko points   out,  the  active measures
 apparat of the Soviet party and government structure
 is  tasked continuously to    further propaganda themes.

 machinations, speaks frequently on the subject of Soviet
 propaganda and corresponding active measures operations.
 There are,  of course,  advantages to the Soviets
 to this right/left placement. The horrors of the totali-
 tarian  right,  according to                              this Communist theme,   are
 thus distanced    from the Socialist world on the left.
 The murder of much of Europe's Jewish community,      for
 example,  according to this Communist idea, was a unique
 phenomenon of   the  right.   Jews,  and others  revolted
 by the Nazi persecution and death camps, are thus drawn--or
 driven--to the left, away from the right.   Conservatives
 and  many other  anti-communists,    being  on  the right
 of the political    spectrum, find themselves perilously
 close  to  the  fascists in   the  communist    world view.
 Heed the conservatives,  move to the right,     the message
 reads,  and at  once you  are  associated with the worst
 aspects of Nazi totalitarianism;   to the left,  however,
 there resides peace and justice.
 The tyrannies of communism and fascism are clones.
 The   assignment  of  one to  the  left and  the  other to
 the   right  is  immensely deceptive.   Both are forms of
 revolutionary socialism.  "(T)he collectionist systems
 of Communism and Fascism," as Vetterli and Fort point
 out, "belong not on the opposite extremes of the political
 spectrum, but,    on the  contrary,  their characteristics
 demand  th~t they share a position side by side on the
 far left."
 The Communists  and  the National  Socialists were
 allies for a period from 1939 to 1941.   In 1939 Poland
 was divided between them and Hitler was freed to attack
 in the West. By this pact World War II was thus allowed
 to  begin. The  short but  decisive  alliance  between
 the two revolutionary socialist powers permitted Germany
 to concentrate  its forces against the Western Allies.
 Large shipments of Soviet iron ore provided steel for,
 and Caucasian petroleum fueled, the Nazi panzer divi-
 sions.  For its part, the Soviets absorbed the independent
 Baltic states  (illegally  occupied  to  this      day)  and
 struck at Finland.

 about  the war,  the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact which had
 recently  been  signed,  and  about  the  Soviet  Union's
 new ally,   Germany, its enemy,  Poland,  and peace:  "We
 have always held that a strong Germany is an indispensible
 condition for a durable peace in Europe," Molotov claimed
 magnanimously.   "Today our   relations with the German
 state",  he said,  "are based on our  friendly relations,
 on our readiness to support Germany's efforts for peace
 and at the same time on a desire to contribute in every
 way to the development of Soviet-German economic relations
 to the mutual benefit of both states.
 "One may accept or reject the ideology of Hitlerism
 as well  as any other ideological system",  the foreign
 commissar pointed out,  in an expansive mood,  nowhere
 demanding the usual  ideological monopoly for Communist
 doctrine.
 "Germany  is  in the position of a state which is
 striving  for   the earliest  termination of the war and
 for peace," Molotov explained, "while Britain and France,
 which only yesterday were declaiming against aggression,
 are   in favor  of  continuing  the war  and  are opposed
 to the conclusion of peace."    And with regard to Poland,
 Molotov said,   "... one swift blow... first by the German
 army and  then by  the Red Army,  and    nothing was4left
 of this ugly offspring of the Versailles Treaty..."
 The Soviet Union got  its  strong Germany,  so in-
 dispensible, in Molotov's thinking, for a durable peace.
 Indeed,  the Soviet Union helped to make Germany strong
 and gave Hitler   the  free hand he needed to strike in
 the West--against  neutral  countries  as  well   as  the
 British  and  French.    It  got  its  friendly  relations
 with Germany too,  for a time. In fact,    Stalin refused
 to believe  it at first when Hitler broke their treaty
 in June 1941 and thrust into the Soviet Union itself.
 The Berlin-Moscow Axis and Its Socialist Revolutions
 In the eyes  of  "sincere Stalinist and Trotskyist
 partisans   of  the Berlin-Moscow  axis,"  according  to
 Sidney Hook,    the American philosopher,  Bolshevism had
 accomplished a  'social  revolution'... the transfer of

 Totalitarian Socialism -- Emulation and Cooperation
 Following the Bolshevik coup d'etat of 1917,  the
 Communist party under Lenin and,  subsequently under
 Stalin,  himself,  elaborated throughout the Soviet Union
 an  immensely effective  state control mechanism.   The
 pervasive and  efficient secret police and vast labor
 camp  network  of  this  control  system  had functioned
 in the USSR for    15  years before Hitler assumed power
 in Germany.  The components of Soviet Communist totalitarian-
 ism--the party, the secret police, the prison camps--stood
 as remarkably effective models for the leaders of National
 Socialism in Germany. The identity of party and government,
 the interlocking mechanisms for restraint and manipula-
 tion--indeed, the use of terror for political control--were
 all    functioning aspects  for  a  decade  and a  half  in
 the Soviet Union by the time the Nazi       regime was put
 into place.
 According to Adam Ulam, in writing about the Communist
 collectivization in the 1930s of Soviet agriculture,
 The  dimension of  the  holocaust which
 accompanied  the  forcible    collectivization
 awed even its maker.        In a conversation during
 World War II with Churchill, Stalin acknowledged
 that         the  ordeal surpassed   in  its  severity
 even   those  disaster-filled          first  years of
 the Nazi invasion.
 It was a demonstration, unique in recent
 history,   of  how much  can  be       accomplished
 by  force  and violence.   And   this  violence

 This point is the key one to many economists and social
 scientists, not  who      owns the factors  of   production
 but who controls and benefits from them.         Both under
 Nazism and under Communism the party elites controlled
 and benefited from the creation of wealth.  Party membership
 rather  than membership in the capitalist class is the
 key  issue  for party membership confers the requisite
 status and the resulting power.  These conditions prevail
 in Communist countries today.

 was directed against one's own people,  with
 victims'  sons  and  brothers  serv~ng  as the
 instrument of their own oppression.
 Foreign Communists were not spared.     Roy Medvedev,
 Soviet Marxist historian,  is quoted by       Paul Johnson,
 the British historian, as noting that,
 "It is a terrible paradox that most European Communist
 leaders and activists who lived  in the USSR perished,
 while most of those who were in prison in their native
 lands in 1937-8 survived." Stalin and the Nazis exchanged
 lists  of  "wanted"  persons,  as well,  Johnson  points
 out.  In Soviet prisons, through which about ten percent
 of the Russian people passed, "torture was used," Johnson
 says,  "on a scale which even the Nazis were later to
 find it difficult to match."
 The  Nazis  imported the Russian camp system,   as
 well,  Johnson    explains,  but  there were  always more
 Soviet camps, most of them larger than their Nazi counter-
 parts                     and holding more prisoners.   The      total deaths
 caused by Stalin's policy during this period was about
 ten million, Medvedev claps, 4.5 million of them victims
 during the period 1936-9.
 Johnson also tells of Stalin's secret negotiations
 with Hitler   to  facilitate  the former's purge of his
 army.   In 1936,  Stalin persuaded the Nazi government
 to   provide  forged evidence  of  secret  Soviet-German
 military contacts.  The Gestapo provided the information.
 Marshal   Tukhachevsky,  commander of the Red Army,  and
 other senior officers were arrested and killed. Eventually
 30,000  men,  about half  of  the  total  Soviet officer
 corps,  were executed.   The purge then spread to the
 party and  *;I, the end about one million members  in all
 were killed.l
 Hitler  like Lenin began his political career as
 a socialist.    He  joined the German Workers Party in

 German Workers  Party,  the  "Nazis" were joined by the
 German Socialist Party in 1922.
 Hitler  made  it  abundantly clear  from the  start
 that   his was  a socialist revolution.    "I have learned
 a great deal from Marxism," Hitler told Hermann Rauschning.
 "The whole of National Socialism is based on it ... all
 these new methods of political struggle are essentially
 Marxist in origin. All I had to do wa~2take over these
 methods and adapt them to our purpose.
 The German dictator also told Rauschning, according
 to the latter,  that German socialism "does not change
 the  external  order of  things,  Ii3  orders  solely the
 relationship of man to the st~te."     "We are socializing
 the people.",  Hitler  said.        An even more  telling
 statement by Hitler was his comparison of Soviet socialism
 and  German  National  Socialism.      "It  is  not Germany
 that will  turn Bolshevist, but Bolshevism that will
 become  a  sort  of  National  Socialism,"      Hitler told
 Rauschning.    "Besides,  there  is    more  that  binds  us
 to Bolshevism than separates us from it," Hitler explained.
 "There  is,  above all,  genuine revolutionary feeling,
 which is alive everywhere in Russia except where there
 are  Jewish Marxists.    I have  always made    allowance
 for  this circumstance," Hitler said, "and given orders
 that forme; Communists are to be admitted to the party
 at once."'-' Josef Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propa-
 ganda,  made                            the  point  in mystical  terms.   "To be a
 socialist,"  declared Goebbels,  "is  to  submit  the  I
 to  the thou; socialism is  sacrificing the  individual
 to the whole ."l6
 According to Hanns Johst, Hitler once told   him
 that   "National Socialism derives... national resolution
 from the bourgeoise tradition, v ptla} creative socialism
 from the teachings   of Marxism.       Beyond "national
 resolution" what did National  Socialism derive    from

 the    bourgeoise?    Numerous  observers  have  spoken  of
 the cooperation of German capitalists with the Nazis.
 Hook cautioned as follows, however:
 Nothing  indicates  so  eloquently    the
 sterility  of  Leninist   theory  as  the  view
 that  fascism  is  the last  phase  of  finance
 capitalism....   It assumes that the individual
 capitalist, who as a capitalist is interested
 only in profit, is willing to sacrifice himself
 for  the  interests  of  the  capitalist
 class--in actuality,  the interests of a few
 finance capitalists.     Not only  is this the
 sheerest mysticism,  it is demonstrably false.
 Finance   capitalists--insofar     as  any were
 left  in Hitler's Germany--took their orders
 from  the  Nazi   party  and  not  vice  versa.
 Nor  is there any evidence that their counsel
 had  greater  weight  in  Nazi  pjgty circles
 than that of other social groups.
 Far  from big business   corrupting his socialism,
 it was     the other ay around," adds Paul Johnson,    the
 British historian. "  "He had no intention, like Russia,
 of  'liquidating'    the  possessing   class,"  Rauschning
 said   of   Hitler.  "On  the  contrary,  he  would compel
 it  to contribute by its abilities toward the building
 up of a new order."0      According to Rauschning,  Hitler
 explained to him thus:    "Why need we trouble to socialize
 banks and factories?  We socialize human beings.
 Carl  Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski concluded
 "from all the facts available... that fascist and communist
 totalitarian dictatorship are basically alike,  or at
 any    rate more  nearly like each other  than any other
 system 25 government,  including earlier  forms of auto-
 cracy."      "It  is only natural," they went on,                   "that
 the regimes, conceiving of themselves as bitter enemies,
 dedicated to the task of liquidating each other, should
 take   the view that  they have nothing in common.   This
 has  happened before in history.   When the Protestants
 and Catholics were fighting each other in the sixteenth
 and  seventeenth centuries,  they very commonly denied

 While acknowledging important differences between
 the   two  forms  of totalitarianism,  Arthur Schlesinger,
 the American historian,  for his part points out that,
 "the  similarities  are  vastly mere  overpowering and
 significant than the differences."
 Other Socialists, Other Fascists
 Fascism    in  Italy, like  Nazism  in Germany, had
 its origins in socialism as well.  Mussolini was probably
 Italy's  foremost   Socialist  before he  organized  the
 Fascist Movement.   Although not a "complete" Marxist,
 according to Torquato Nanni,  his biogragyer and close
 friend,  he was a Marxist none-the-less.      Mussolini,
 an "admirer of Lenin's brutal energy," left the Socialist
 Party,  because  of its lethargy.   It was  his   intent
 to  "modernize and  revise"  the  socialist movement in
 Italy, 2~rnst Nolte, the German chronicler of fascism,
 notes.      Revolutionary socialists were then,  as they
 are today, interested in power even more than ideology.
 In Britain,  for its part,    Sir Oswald Mosley, who
 founded  the British Union of Fascists  in 1933,    also
 came    from the Socialist Party.   The youngest member
 of  the Labor Party cabinet,  Mosley was considered by
 many to be a future prime minister.   The British left,
 like the left in other countries, could produce fascists
 as  well  as Marxists.,   Laval in France and Quisling
 in Norway,  Friedrich Hayek note4   "began as socialists
 and ended as Fascists or Nazis."
 Always competitive, eventually Nazism and Communism
 broke,   but the  lessons  of  the  Soviet  secret police
 and labor camps,  mass coercion and brutality,  had been
 quickly--and thoroughly--learned by the National Social-

 ists.    It  would  be   difficult  to  demonstrate  that  the
 latter   were  any  worse  than  their mentors in  the  Soviet
 union.   "Even  Hitler's  Gestapo  lacked       the   sweeping
 powers   of  the  KGB,"  according  to Brian     Crozier,  the
 British student of totalitarianism.28
 Both  ideologies, Communism and  National   Socialism,
 incorporated   terrorism  into   their  systems    very early.
 Lenin's  instructions  on    terrorism to the      Bolsheviks
 of  St.  Petersburg were     dated 1905.29    Such    "tactics
 were   developed  by  both the Communists     and  the   Nazis
 in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s," Herbert Romerstein
 points   out.       Each learned and emulated  the       other  in
 terrorism,  not to mention street fighting.    The uniforms
 of the Nazi storm troopers (Sturmabteilung), the infamous
 "brown   shirts,"  Romerstein  observes in    an  aside,  were
 even   copied  from those  of  the Communist  League  of       Red
 Fighters (Rote Frontkampferbund).30  Both Soviet Communism
 and German National Socialism,      those two forms of totali-
 tarian                        socialism,  used  terrorism  as  a  means  of seizing
 power  and  both employed state  terror to remain in power
 once there.
 What distinguished  the        two  totalitarian systems
 most was the  foundation    of  Communism  on  class  and of
 National    Socialism on  race.    Even    this  distinction
 becomes  blurred,  however.    Anti-Semitism,  the  hallmark
 of Nazism,  has been an important part of Soviet ideology
 and  practice  for fifty years although in recent decades
 it   has become  more  institutionalized.    In  1971  the
 KGB  formed a  Jewish  Department,  John       Barron reports,
 under    its Fifth Chief  Directorate,   itself  created in
 1970,    "to annihilate  intellectual  dissent,  stop  the
 upsurge  of religious  dissent,   suppress     nationalism."31
 One  need not  be  a  Zionist to  know what that means for
 Jews in the Soviet Union today.   According to Ken Jacobson,

 director of Middle East Affairs of the Anti-Defamation
 League of B'nai B'rith,  "the Soviet Union is the center
 of anti-Semitism in the world today."
 It  is       interesting--but  not  surprising--that the
 contemporary neo-Nazi movement in the U. S. and Europe
 shares with  the  Soviet  Union  its   anti-Semitism and
 its  admiration  for the Palestine Liberation Organi-
 zation.                          The September 1980 bombing at the Munich beer
 festival which killed 13    people and  injured 212  has
 been  linked by  the  German police to members    of the
 neo-Nazi group called the "Military Sports Group Hoffman."
 According  to  the West  German  press, members  of the
 Hoffman group trained with the PLO in Lebanon and had
 taken part in public  meetings  with    the  PLO.  Early
 the   following month, a bomb exploded outside a Paris
 synagogue  killing  three  people and   injuring 33.   A
 neo-Nazi group claimed responsibility for that bombing,
 and the French press reported that French police linked
 the bombing to the Government of Libya.
 There is  evidence that the  Soviets  support,  or
 even  establish,  "fascist"  groups  outside  the  bloc,
 to  bring  discredit  on  "the  right." In early 1982,
 Gerhard Boeden,   director of   the West German Federal
 Criminal Police   (BKA),  reported  "indications that bloc
 intelligence    services  and their German  stooges  are
 stooping," as he put it, "to founding 'national socialist
 groups' so as to be able to claim the danger of neo-Nazi
 activities  in       the FRG" (Federal Republic of Germany).
 Earlier,  Radio  Moscow,  on January  15,  1982,  Boeden
 went on, reported the founding of a "nationalist socialist"
 organization which   "in fact did not take place until
 the following day and whose founder and secretary general
 is the known Communist Herbert Bormann."
 Boeden charged the Soviet Union with aiding terrorism.
 The PLO,  he claimed,  supported by the Soviets,  trained
 German terrorists--both leftists  and  rightists.      As
 for the "peace" movement in West Germany, Boeden explained,
 "these peace demonstrations constitute a great success
 for  the  Soviet  disinformation  campaign and  just   as
 great  a  success  for  Communist  alliance    politics."
 Although the German Communist Party never wins as much
 as one percent of the vote in elections, Boeden pointed
 out, "it has  in this manner,  with  its        auxiliary and

 front organizations and with its mostly innocent 'allies cI
 managed to win great influence upon popular movements.
 "What is not generally known," according to Vetterli
 and Fort, "is the fact that not only did much of practical
 and    theoretical  Nazism spring  from socialist roots,
 but so too did much of German anti-Semitism.   The Jews,
 having been denied membership in the early guilds and
 not having been allowed to own property," they explain,
 "quite  naturally  helped  in  the  development of  free
 enterprise. As      a  matter  of fact,  the  Jews exerted
 a  more or  less    consistent pressure directed  toward
 the breakdown of feudalism and the emergence of free
 enterprise and the industrial system.  Thus, they quite
 naturally incurred the enmity and wrath of early social-
 ists.                     Too,  socialist  revolutionaries,"     the authors
 explain,  "all  over Europe contemptuously placed the
 Jew as  an  idej5tifiable category  of the upper-class
 establishment."
 Liberalism in Germany,  a potential  obstacle to
 fascism and communism,  was    of  little consequence  in
 the developments of the 1920s and 1930s,          as explained
 by Hayak:
 In  Germany before 1933,  and  in Italy
 before 1922, Communists and Nazis or Fascists
 clashed more frequently with each other than
 with other parties.   They competed for support
 of          the  same  type of mind and reserved for
 each other  the hatred of the heretic.     But
 their practice showed how closely they are
 related.    To both...the man with whom they
 had    nothing  in   common  and  with whom they
 could not hope  to convince was  the liberal
 of the old type. While to the Nazi the Communist,
 and to  the Communist the Nazi,  and to both
 the Socialist,  are potential  recruits   who
 are made of     the  right timber.... They know
 that there can be no compromise between them
 and those who believe in individual  freedom.
 [Hitler hated Liberalism of the old type] .. this
 hatred  had  little  occasion  to  show itself
 in practice merely because, by the time Hitler

 It  is  put                                   another way,  by Fritz Stern,  also  a
 student of totalitarianism.         Although he deplores the
 numerous    reasons  causing us,    Stern says, "to distance
 ourselves from the once comforting view that only Germans
 or National Socialists could have committed so horrible
 a  crime"   [as  the  Nazi  holocaust],  he realizes    that
 "Soviet, terror       has  claimed even more  lives  than the
 Nazis.       There is a Russian proverb that says,     "When
 the forest is being cut down,  chips fly."      The millions
 of people who died in the Soviet Union are still called

 trenchant assessment  that  "communism is          in  itself 4$
 variant,  the most successful  variant  of         fascism.
 To repeat the words of Sidney Hook, cited earlier,
 "the German Fascists recapiti}ated the essential history
 of  the Russian Revolution." "Culturally," he added,
 "Leninism must be regarded in the light of its developments
 as the first Fascist movement of the twentieth century."
 There it  is then--"Communism... the most successful
 variant  of  fascism."  Q  course,  the  Soviets would
 want  to hide   the  fact--they have worked  so hard to
 give fascism a bad name,   and  rightly so.   They have
 worked even harder  to plant the banner of  fascism on
 the   far right,   but wrongly  so.  It doesn't belong

 there;       it belongs on  the  far  left of the political
 spectrum, next to Communism itself.   Allowing for their
 differences, they were variants of the same awful thing:
 totalitarian revolutionary socialism.
 Not  only  is  Communism    in   the Soviet  Union  the
 most  successful  form of fascism,      as Sontag says,  but,
 according    to  Borkenan  and  Hook,  it  was  the    first.
 It  is painfully     obvious,  of course,  that Communism
 still exists while the other forms have vanished.
 How could the notion,    that communism is something
 apart      from fascism and that  fascism did   not    emerge
 from  the  left but from   the  right,   become so     firmly
 implanted?         Why so persistent? Moscow doubtless has
 a way with words.
 The massacre by the Communist Party of millions
 in Ukraine in the 1930s is largely unknown in the West.
 Stalin simply said it never happened.   He merely denied
 it  repeatedly.   This  newer myth,  this,      however,
 required  some  positive  effort  to  give  it  momentum.
 Eventually   acquiring critical  mass,  as  it  were,  it
 became self-sustaining.
 Another question emerges:  How has this
 myth--persistent,   pervasive and unrealistic--this lie
 --deliberate, pervasive and unrealistic--affected history?
 How has  this deflection of  the  thoughts of millions
 over scores of years skewed the perceptions and judgments
 of history?  What will it take to put it all right?
