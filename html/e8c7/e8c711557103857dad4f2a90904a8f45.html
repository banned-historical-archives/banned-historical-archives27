 Directorate of intelligence
 20 June 1972
 Mao Tse-tung has long held the belief that China's educational system
 fostered a politically unreliable elite not responsive to the needs of the
 working masses. In 1966 he moved decisively to change the system, in effect
 closing all institutions of higher learning for a period of four years. The
 closings, coming as they did at the start of the Cultural Revolution, occurred
 in response to immediate political needs. l;;it they were justified in terms of
 the need to overhaul completely China's educational establishment. The
 system has been in a state of flux ever since.
 There are many elements in the Maoist prescription for education, but
 essentially the aim is to develop a system that produces graduates with a
 correct blend of political orientation and competence in a production-related
 field. To this end, the regime enunciated a plan to lower admission require-
 ments drastically, to reduce the time spent in college, and to devise a
 curriculum emphasizing practical subjects closely attuned to China's im-
 mediate production needs. Many of these goals had been established earlier,
 but official and Red Guard propaganda during the Cultural Revolution
 claimed that they had been thwarted by a rigid and unresponsive educational
 bureaucracy generally out of sympathy with Mao's ainms.
 The reopening of Tsinghua University in 1970-after four years of
 debate-began the implementation of the Maoist reforms. Before even a year
 had elapsed, however, signs began to emerge in the official media that the
 reform system was experiencing serious difficulties. The press hinted that
 Peking was having second thoughts about the viability of the new syrtem.
 Following a lengthy but unheralded conference on national education
 last summer, the regime began gradually but unmistakably to retreat from
 the more extreme proposals. These modifications and the heavy enrollment
 of seemingly better qualified students this spring suggest that the quality of
 education in China is on its way toward being upgraded. Such a partial
 return to past practices carries with it the prospect of eventually reviving the
 tensions that helped to stimulate the Cultural Revolution.

 ordhia,'ed with the Office of Scientific Intelligence.

 The Revolution 1966-68
 1. In June 1966, Peking announced an unusual decision to revise the
 examination system for universities and senior middle schools and to post-
 pone 1966 school enrollment for six months in order to work out a plan that
 would "transform the education system completely." Officially, the decision
 concerned only universities and senior middle schools (roughly equivalent to
 senior high school), but it was applied to primary and junior middle schools
 as well. This move was clearly related to the broader political struggles then
 convulsing the country-indeed, questions of educational reform played only
 a minor role. But the linking of the educational question to the wider
 political upheaval in effect brought higher education to a complete halt, not
 for six months but for four years.
 2. Within a month all schools throughout China had closed, freeing
 some 800,000 university students and about 14 million middle-school stu-
 dents to take part in the mass political campaigns of the Cultural Revolution.
 During the hectic summer of 1966, the students-relieved of classroom

 responsibilities and encouraged by the regime to rebel against established
 authority-launched an all-out attack on what they knew best, the educa-
 tional system. Schools in the university district northwest of Peking, notably
 Tsinghua and Peking universities, set the example for the rest of the country.
 Mass student organizations, known as "Red Guards," were formed and began
 publishing their own wall posters and newspapers. Many students indulged in
 personal vendettas, subjecting individual professors to intense criticism and
 humirtating struggle sessions for having given poor grader;. Such personal
 grievances quickly escalated into calls to reorient higher education away
 from strictly academic pursuits toward the mastering of practical skills
 related to production needs. Medical students complained, for example, that
 they were over-trained in medical school because in practice they would
 never encounter the exotic diseases they had stuJied or have access to the
 relatively sophisticated equipment available in some medical schools.
 3. In a wall poster debate ever educational reform, students criticized
 aspects of the educational system that were holdovers from traditional
 Chinese education. They objected to studying history, which they saw as the
 record of a feudal past having no relevance to a revolutionary society. They
 attacked the method of learning lessons by rote, saying it left them no
 opportunity for questions, or even discussion. They seve-.ly criticized the
 authoritarian rule of the teacher, who allowed students to speak only when
 spoken to, invited no discussion, and tolerated no disagreement. In addition
 to freedom in the classroom, they demanded the freedom to choose their
 own course of study in lieu of assignments by #hc state to particular
 disciplines. These demands no doubt expressed genuine student discontent,
 particularly on the part of elements who were brought into the educational
 machinery in the previous few years in response to Maoist prescriptions and
 found it hard going. There is little doubt, however, that student grievances
 were manipulated for political advantage by radical elements in China's
 leadership.
 4. Summing up the students' proposals, the regime issued a "discussion
 draft" on a revised education system. The draft, as revealed in the Red
 Guard press, called for abolishing the stiff entrance examination and enroll-
 ing students on the basis of recommendation by their school. The draft
 suggested that academic performance be determined by group discussion
 rather than by grades and examination; that all schools adopt the half-work
 half-study system, in which students spend half their time in manual labor;
 that urban universities move to the villages and military farms, particularly in
 the frontier provinces, with arts faculties being the first to go; and that
 academic titles, distinctions between major and minor universities-including
 the appellation "first" and "second" class university-and special privileges

 granted to more important universities be abolished. The draft recommended
 that middle-school students, wh'le they were in school, spend one year
 working on farms, in factories, or in the armed forces.
 5. These recommendations reflected Mao's own dissatisfaction with the
 educational system. He saw distinctions based on academic performance as
 artificial and irrelevant. In his view, China needed technicians who could
 relate to the needs of the working masses, contribute to production, and
 improve on existing techniques; China did not need scholars who sought
 knowledge for its own sake and could not transform their knowledge into
 resources for production. Mao maintained that such scholars not only were a
 luxury China could 1)1 afford, but also were politically unreliable. Scholars,
 he said, regarded themselves as an elite, removed from the everyday prob-
 lems of the vast majority of Chinese people and contemptuous of the
 uneducated working masses. By extension, this meant the scholars were
 contemptuous of the one-time peasant who was the leader of China.
 6. Mao's goal was an educational system that would ingrain in its
 graduates a high deg; :~e of political consciousness, concern for the well-being
 of the masses and a genuine desire to serve them as well as competence in a
 production-related field. He felt that students, after 16 years of schcoiing,
 were overeducated for the tasks they would be called on to perform in
 China's still-developing economy. The reforms proposed during the Cvltural
 Revolution grew out of Mao's attempt to find a short-cut to the creation of
 large numbers of intellectuals who were both red and expert and could
 answer China's immediate production needs.
 7. Many of these concepts had becn put forward before, only to be
 scuttled by those within the party and the bureaucracy who favored a more
 rational approach to curing China's educational ills. Frustrated with the
 delays and setbacks at the top, Mao sought to overturn the educational
 structure from below. The scope of the reform measures and, more impor-
 tantly, the manner in which they were imposed attest to Mao's deep
 suspicions about intellectuals and to his willingness to initiate large-scale
 social projects to achieve his goals. The ability of Mao and his supporters to
 move decisively in the educational realm was, of course, greatly expedited by
 the simultaneous smashing of the Communist party apparatus that had
 steadfastly resisted the earlier attempts at reform.
 8. This opposition had been rooted in a genuine distrust of the efficacy
 of the measures prescribed by Mao and the radical ideologues who echoed
 him and elaborated his ideas. The party bureaucrats in charge of China's

 er:jcational system were convinced that short-cuts were not really feasible
 for China; if the country was to pull itself up by its bootstraps, the only
 method open was to emulate more advanced societies in training the most
 promising of China's youth in the skills and techniques necessary to such
 achievement. This, in turn, implied an emphasis on specialization, on lan-
 guage, and on technical skills. In short, education had to be elitist, and
 rewards should go to t! ,ose most capable of learning; in practice, this meant
 students with privileged and cultured backgrounds. The great mass of stu-
 dents from peasant and worker backgrounds fell by the wayside. This
 created resentment, in part because precisely those peasant virtues that
 official propaganda extolled proved to be of no value in the educational
 environment.
 9. In fact, the Cultural Revolution in its early stages divided the student
 body along the faultline of privilege; the peasant students, brought into the
 university system in the mid-1960s, partly as window dressing to reduce
 Maoist pressures on the educational bureaucracy, were pitted against the
 more gifted students from more privileged background, who, naturally, were
 the favorites of their teachers. As the Cultural Revolution progressed, this
 dividing line tended to break down. By late 1967 and 1968 factionalization
 on China's campuses (where some sbndents continued to live) had reached
 epic proportions, and "principled" clashes had degenerated into mindless
 fighting among largely inchoate groups of students.
 The Damper Applied, 1968-69
 10. In mid-1968, in the midst of nationwide chaos and confusion, the
 regime decided to dampen the fires. The impact was felt immediately on the
 nation's campuses. Worker propaganda teams entered universities throughout
 the country. Their first order of business was to restore order. Backed up by
 contingents from the
 armed forces, the worker
 teams carried out their
 task with thoroughness.
 The Red Guard groups
 were disbanded, and the
 more fractious students
 were sent packing to the
 hinterlands for "labor re-
 form."

 term mission as well. Their tasks were described in general terms in the flood
 of propaganda that accompanied the issuance of Mao's July 1968 directive
 on university education, which signaled the regime's intent to begin the long,
 arduous process of renewing higher education in China. The teams, in
 conjunction with the armed forces, were to assume the administration of the
 universities, revise the curriculum, direct the compilation of new teaching
 materials, and assemble a faculty and a student body. These, obviously, were
 tasks the teams were not equipped to handle. In fact, little headway was
 made, and the teams confined themselves to conducting political thought
 sessions for the few teachers and students who remained in the universities.
 In the meantime, much discussion and considerable disagreement took place
 over how to implement the injunctions vaguely outlined in Mao's latest
 directive.
 12. Full-scale resumption of classes was delayed further by yet another
 Mao directive, issued in December 1968, ordering all students and virtually
 all other unemployed urban dwellers to proceed to the countryside where
 they were to undergo re-education indefinitely. This directive, in effect,

 removed from the cities the very same school-age youth who would make
 the most likely candidates for a reassembled student body. They were soon
 joined by teachers and other professional personnel who were thought to
 need more manual labor to divest them of their elitist pretensions. With most
 teachers and students in the countryside, the work of reforming the uni-
 versities prior to the resumption of classes obviously was set back.
 The Universities Reopen, 1970-71
 13. In July 1970, two years after the first worker propaganda team had
 entered Tsinghua, the party theoretical journal Red Flag devoted an entire
 issue to the problem of how to run universities of science and engineering.
 The propaganda team at Tsinghua contributed the major article, which
 contained the news that the university had reopened and was prepared to
 enroll a limited number of students. Since then Tsinghua has served as a
 pace-setter for universities throughout China.
 14. The Red Flag article revealed that Tsinghua had been engaged in
 "experimental' class work for about a year. The faculty, greatly reduced
 from the days before the Cultural Revolution, consisted of some members of
 the original teaching staff plus a number of workers, peasants, and soldiers
 hired as both full- and part-time teachers. The teacher shortage, which would
 plague reopened universities over the next two years, was not yet a problem
 at Tsinghua, where the student body was down from 12,000 to ap-
 proximately 2,800.

 15, The admissions requirements established at Tsinghua attempted to
 strike a balance between Mao's desire for more children from worker and
 peasant families and the university's efforts to maintain at least some of the
 high standards that had made it China's foremost engineering school.
 Emphasis was placed on enrolling politically correct workers, peasants and
 soldiers, with three or more years of practical work experience, who were
 about 20 years of age and had at least a junior middle-school education. Age
 and educational requirements were waived for workers and peasants with
 abundant practical experience. Tsinghua said it would enroll some young
 intellectuals who had been sent to the countryside two years earlier. At this
 point, the Tsinghua curriculum was a hodge-podge of politics, standard
 course work, vocational training, and manual labor. To enable students to
 put into practice what they had learned in the classroom-a basic tenet of
 Mao's thoughts on education-Tsinghua set up its own factories and estab-
 lished working relationships with other factories. There is some evidence to
 suggest that the less qualified students-primarily over-age workers and
 peasants admitted without regard to prior academic training-were confined
 to vocational training courses where they concentrated on improving tech-
 nical skills. Nevertheless,

 16. The question of reopening liberal arts universities was postponed.
 One reason was that the regime, trying to boost the economy, gave the
 training of technicians a clear priorty over people trained in literature and
 arts. Moreover, the question of liberal arts students raised sensitive political
 issues because it was among them that political heresy first surfaced. An-
 other factor contributing to the delay was probably the question of how to
 link liberal arts education with prr,ductive work. In theory, at least, school-
 run factories provide an opportunity for practical application of scientific
 knowledge, keep students in close tcuch with workers and peasants, and
 permit some contribution to production. But there are no factories for the
 humanities. The regime grasped this nettle in June 1971 by announcing that
 liberal arts students were to take the whole country as their classroom. In
 order to compare past misery under the Kuomintang regime with present
 happiness under the socialist system, history students were organized into
 "field units" to interview village elders. Literature and arts students were
 urged to create works portraying the revolutionary enthusiasm of the work-
 ers, peasants and soldiers by drawing from everyday experiences, while being
 careful to cast these deeds in the appropriate heroic images.

 Young intellectuals working in the countryside.
 17. As more universities of science and technology began to reopen on
 an experimental basis, it became clear that the Tsingl eta iiiodeI was not being
 implemented uniformly in each locality. Significantly, some universities
 lowered the practical work requirement from three to two years. This put
 young people, who had been rusticated for two years following Mao's
 directive, among the main candidates for the crucial first enrollment. More-
 over, as a reflection of the political situation oI' the time when "support-the-
 left? personnel from the armed services exercised virtually unquestioned
 control over a variety of' civilian enterprises, a disproportionate number of
 soldiers were enrolled in the universities. They were selected by the military
 control committees which held the real power in the universities. In this
 revised system the main features of Mao's reform program nevertheless were
 retained. Many schools established branches in the countryside where teach-
 ers and students--despite their seemingly strong working-class credentials-
 were obliged to immerse themselves in manual labor. Courses contained a
 heavy (lose of politics, drawn chiefly from the thoughts of Mao. Worker-
 peasant-soldier teachers gave lectures along with university professors.
 Woricer-peasant-soldier students, convinced that their proletarian back-
 grounds made them ideologically pure and tieterminetl to shatter the old
 myth that the teacher was the absolute authority, freely interrupted the

 professors to lecture them about their political shortcomings. Classroom
 time was divided among academic training, political study, manual labor, .nd
 military training. Although some genuine academic training was conducted
 for the first time in four years, its ef'f'ectiveness was undermined by if host of
 difficulties.
 Problems Under tie Revised System 1970-71
 18. Mao's political philosophy stresses the innate superiority of the
 working class and the belief that sufficient political indoctrination will
 convince people to subordinate their own interests to the needs of the state.
 This formula, however, did not deal directly with the practical problems
 inherent in putting it into practice. In fact, the propaganda teams, inexperi-
 enced in college administration and uncomfortable in their new posts,
 performed poorly. Mainland media, taking the teams to task, revealed that
 many of them freely admitted their own ignorance and shied away from
 reorganizing the universities. Others, ignoring instructions that they solicit
 the views of experienced educators, promoted educational reform as they
 saw fit. The result was chaos in the universities and little progress toward the
 full-scale resumption of higher education.
 19. The students posed a different problem. Those with limited school-
 ing were disheartened when they found themselves unable to cope with
 college-level material. In fact, Red Flag tried to boost the morale of worker-
 peasant-soldier students who were "unable to understand the teachers'
 lectures" by laying the blame on unsympathetic professors. Academically
 qualified students, on the other hand, saw little point in studying since they
 were destined to spend their lives doing manual labor regardless of their
 university education. Mao had s tid they were to resume working after a few
 years of study, and in most cases this meant a return to their original work
 units-somewhat better trained perhaps, but with small hope of progressing
 much beyond their present stations. The more radical among the students
 regarded a resumption of educational activity as a sellout to the very
 academic authorities they had attacked in the past and a compromise of
 Maoist ideals. Serious-minded students were frustrated by the heavily
 politicized course content, the reduction of classroom time in favor of
 military training and manual labor, and the poor quality of many of their
 classmates and teachers. The revised system offered students of every stripe
 scant reason to study, and in fact they studied very little.
 20. There can be little doubt that the reform program as carried out in
 the school year of 1970-71 seriously undermined the morale of the teachers.

 qualified students, and resented the presence of worker-peasant-soldier
 teachers who wasted valuable classroom time with their political lectures.
 Realizing that they were evaluated on the basis of political reliability rather
 than the quality of their instruction, teachers were afraid to concentrate on
 academic course content lest they come under renewed attacks for pro-
 moting a "bourgeois" educational system. But they were equally afraid to
 give political lectures that might contain "mistakes."
 21. As more students enrolled in universities, the regime confronted a
 critical shortage of qualified professors. Some had died; a few had even
 committed suicide during the stress and turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.
 Some, after four years of inactivity, were in poor health or simply too old to
 resume teaching. There were no new teachers to replace them because
 normal schools had been closed for four years alor.g with the others. Given
 the unsettled classroom conditions, many teachers who had been assigned to
