 Nation of Work and Hate-i 
Anger Whips Red China to 
Fever Pitch 
Globe-trotting author-editor John Strohm, first U.S. 
newspaperman permitted to travel freely within the borders 1` 
of Red China, is back home after crisscrossing? 7500 miles 
of country behind the Bamboo Curtain, witnessing firsthand 
a bitter anti-America propaganda machine in action. Here's 
the first of a series describing the startling things he saw. 
in his three-week sojourn with typewriter and camera. 
By JOHN STROHM.

Communist China is a nation organized to work 
and to hate. No human beings have ever taken on a ' 
more complete mental and physical bondage in order 
to leap forward into the, 20th century than the subjects 
of Mao Tse-tung. Nor has human intelligence ever 
been brainwashed into a more violent hatred of United 
States leaders. 
I have just traveled 7500 miles behind the Bamboo Cur-
tain which for 10 years has shielded from American view 
the massive state that calls itself the People's Republic of 
China. 
At the height of the Quemoy crisis, I 
have witnessed a hate-America campaign 
that extends to the most remote peasant 
village. Was this what the Red masters of 
Peiping wanted me to see when they 
granted me a visa? Or did they accept my 
statement that I wanted to visit the farms 
and factories of the New China?the- China 
I had first seen 21 years ago?so I could 
report to the people of America? 
Back home now, I ask myself these 
questions while sorting out impressions. 
But The answer is not clear and it may never be. 
It's enough that I walked with only minor incidents in 
the streets, fields and buildings of Red china, snapping 
pictures with four cameras, talking with whom I chose and 
visiting schools, farms, hospitals and landmarks without. 
prior appointment. 
For three weeks I traveled, by automobile, boat, tratO 
and airplane. My days began, 
at dawn, ended at midnight.t 
Expected U. S. Invasion. 
Although I saw militiamen 
training everywhere to repel 
the U.S. Marines who were 
expected to storm ashore any 
day, I do not believe there is , 
danger of full-scale war in thef. 
korthosa strait. 
This backward people has 
too much to do to hoist its 
Vast expanding bulk upwards 
toward seemingly impossible. 
soeial and industrial goals. 
It cannot afford war, but in 
eoCky self-confidence it is 
willing to risk war to infuse 
an apathetic peasantry with 
nationalistic pride to drive I 
weary bone and muscle to 
accomplish prodigious works. 
The Communists say over 
and over that they licked' 
Uncle Sam in Korea. People 
who knew nothing of the 
power of a modern sea and 
air fleet chatter loudly and 
arrogantly that America is a 
"paper tiger." 
As-one who traveled among 
the Chinese people 21 years 
'ago; I must report sadly that ? 
our once vast reservoir of 
goodwill built up in China by 
generations of good deeds by 
U: S. citizens and organiza-
tions is now being poisoned 
by a campaign unequaled in 
the history of the world. 
Hate Demonstrations. 
I arrived at the tail-end of 
the hate-America demonstra-
tions in Peiping which sent 
three million people coursing 
through the streets shouting 
"Down with American impe-
rialism. Americans get out of 
Asia or be smashed." 
But this was no window 
dressing in the capital. Every-
where in north, central and 
south China I saw my coun-
try portrayed as a bloody-
fanged wolf, a ruthless and 
ravaging soldier or a dollar-
bloated Uncle Sam. 
Everyone I talked with?
farmer, housewife, factory 
manager or official?lectured 
me on the evils of American 
imperialism. 
A militiaman in a Nanking i 
factory shouted he was ready 
to work or go to the front?
and he shoved his rifle 1nto.1 
my stmach to dramatize his 
feelings to the first Amer-
ican he'd ever met. 
A collective farm chairman 
in North China said: "We 
whipped the American ag-
gressors in Korea, and we will 
fight them if they invade 
Chii?a," 
He added that his farmers 
werepo indignant they worked 
15 days and nights to over-
fulfill the farm plan?clear-
cut example of the transmu-
tation of hatred into labor 
force. 
Women Learn to Shoot. 
A woman chairman of a 
neighborhood cooperative in 
Tientsin -said her neighbors 
were so incensed that 130 of 
the women are learning to 
shoot rifles to defend their 
homes against America. 
As I stepped out of the 
Church of Christ in Nanking 
on a Sunday morning a 
young man greeted me cor-
dially in English, but when 
he found out I was an Amer-
ican le demanded: "Why do 
you want to invade China?" 
I could not persuade him to 
talk about religion, or any; 
thing else. :He would only 
rant against, 'aggressors." 
A worker in Ilankow came 
over and gave me a written 
.protest aioinst 'American 
butchery" when I walked 
through a hog-killing plant. 
Chinese officials assert that 
800 millien Chinese have dem-
onstrated against American 
imperialism. From all I saw, 
I believe that figure. 
The official line is persua-
sively logical to these cocky 
Chinese, feeling their oats 
after centuries of slavery to 
their warlords and foreign 
domination. 
The line they believe is 
"America admitted at the 
Cairo conference that Taiwan 
belongs to China ..., Quemoy 
and Matsu are to China as 
Long Island is to the U.S.A. 
... Chiang Kai?shek'S "govern-
ment was so corrupt the U.S. 
couldn't save it from being 
overthrown in a fair fight by 
the Chinese people ... Chiang 
?exists only by protection of 
American guns and therefore 
the U.S. is interfering in .the 
Internal affairs of China . . . 
in . other words, aggression." 
Bitter Propaganda. 
These . themes are developed 
by all means of communica-
tion, from hand.draWn cats 
toons on walls to elaborately- 
acted opera skits. Day after 
day, newspapers devoted 60 
- percent of ' their . space to' 
stories bannered under head-
ings like these: "Cairo News-
paper Refutes Dulles Policy," 
"New American Atrocities 
Uncovered in Korea," and 
"Demobilized Veterans Offer 
Services to Resist U.S. Ag-
gression." 
In factories, on train's, on 
farms and in the streets, loud-
--i--iA" I 
that the U.S. was talking 
peace at Warsaw while plot-
ting war.. And then the "com-
mercial": "Therefore we must 
work harder to produce more 
food, more goods, to stop the 
American attack." 
At movie houses, sold out 
days in advance, I saw news-
reels purporting to show 
Chiang's "wanton attack" on 
the University of Amoy?
without a mention of the Red 
shelling of Quemoy. 
One huge wall painting 
showed the U.S. as a big crab 
which waddled from side to 
side in policy, another as a 
giant that crushes the inno-
cent with atomic bombs, and 
as an' insignificant insect 
about to be squashed by the 
weight of 600 million angry 
Chinese. 
Children in Rallies. 
But they get the people into 
the aet, too, from the cradle 
to the grave. I witnessed doz-
ens of parades of seven and 
eight-year-olds carrying red 
flags and banners supporting: 
"Premier Chou En-la_i's state. 
ment." 
An inmate of an old folk's 
home I visited carried oh 
quite earnestly that he didn't 
want his old age security in.. 
vaded by war mongering 
Americans. 
Hundreds of thousands of 
letters carrying hate-U.S. mes-
sages have been beautifully 
brushed by hand and pasted 
to walls of homes, plants, hos-
pitals and even seats of 
learning. 
On my first day in China I 
was treated to a street show 
by a truckload. of opera stu-
dents. They first drummed 
up a crowd by beating on 
drums and cymbals, then put 
on- a skit with this cast of 
characters: a corpse, repre-
sented by an actor dressed 
like Chiang Kai-shek; a pomp-
ous, silk-hatted John Foster 
Dulles and an Eisensower, 
with painted gr,jn, army uni-
form and a g6lf stick as a 
cane. 
Poke Fun at Dulles. 
Ike says: "Dulles, I auth-
orize you to do the talking." 
Dulles tries to pump up 
Chang with a the pump filled 
with,dollars. But the impe-
rialiSta, are swept akvay by 
victorious Chiriese workers 
"producing 10 million tons of 
steel this year," by farmers 
"doubling their crops this 
year" and by soldiers who 
"won the war in Korea.v 
Everybody howls at the 
good clean Communist fun 
aid the show moves on to 
another stanoing - morn -only 
performance on another 
street. 
Later I read a Chinese 
News Agency diSpatch which 
reported. with straight face 
that workers in a tobacco fac-
tory in Canton completed 600 
such opera skits and folk 
songs on American aggres-
sion in just half a day?as 
_king:sized .a blending of art, 
nicotine and official poison 
as any dictatorship could ever 
boast!

Nation of Hate 
IChina Reds Rant 
At U.S. Reporter 
Rural .editor John Strohm, found contempt for the U.S. 
1.at every .turn of his highly privileged? tour of Red China. In 
the first part of his exclusive report yesterday, he told how 
a bitter -propaganda drive is fanning the flame of hatred 
? for America. Today he reveals how the people reacted when 
they learned his true identity.

What of the Red Chinese attitude toward John 
Strohm, the only American correspondent with both 
United States and Chinese permission to travel in 
China? 
Amazement, first. For here was the mortal enemy 
they were ranting about, calmly taking pictures of 
their steel plants, their farms and their militia, 
Curiosity, too. I was a crowd-stopper wherever 
I vent. I must say that my ego dropped when I found 
out that one group of school children who stood up 
and clapped their hands when I 
entered the classroom thought I 
was a Russian! 
In a few spots, the searing 
blast of hatred continually di-
rected toward our country licked 
at me personally. A cartoon of 
protest was drawn of me and 
placed in my hired automobile. 
Once while I was being 
shown through a farm imple-
ment repair shop by the vice-
director of one of the new com-
munes, a belligerent worker 
pushed toward me and shouted, "Get out! Get out!" 
On another occasion, I was surrounded and jostled 
by students who were serving the state by running a 
small blast furnace. 
Scarcely anyone, oire my identity as an Ameri-
can was established, missed an opportunity to lecture 
me severely about American imperialism and the 
validity of Red China's aims. An engineer ?claimed he 
once had seen U.S. soldiers rape girls in Peiping. In 
Shanghai, I was conducted 
through a street memorable as 
the scene where a drunken 
GI allegedly killed a pedicab 
driver. 
"This is not a happy time 
for you to be here," was the 
understatement of a factory 
manager in Nanking. 
My interpreter, who had 
translated a hundred lectures 
to me and must have been as 
tired as I of the propaganda 
monotone, consoled me in 
these 'Words: 
"You're the only American 
most of them have ever met. 
It's their chance to tell you 
what they think." 
What is it like to be an 
American in a hostile land at 
a time like the Quemoy crisis? 
One moves in a constant bath 
of virulent propaganda, from 
the official radio to the irate, 
ladies in the old folks' home. k 
Hopeless One Man Battle. 
To those who seem to 
possess some power to reason, 
you keep up a stiff counter-1 
battery of patient argument. 
But when day is over the 
mind is exhausted and the 
spirit flags even though you 
know one man cannot expect 
to offset massive Communist 
"re-education" and thought 
control. 
The healing balm of honest 
resentment is a luxury one 
can enjoy only to a limited 
row for the poor Chinese. 
whose streets, homes, shops 
and bodies have been cleaned 
up miraculously while, at the 
same time, their minds have 
been blackened by hatred and 
distortion. 
Is there anywhere a few 
drbps of good will for Amer-
ica? Many Chinese assured 
me that they were quite fond 
of the American people and 
wanted to be friends but that 
John Foster Dulles was pre-
venting Americans from get-
ting the truth about China. 
I would be less than truth-
ful if I failed to say that the 
vast majority of the Chinese I 
met?even against ithe hateful 
obbligato of the propaganda?
were most helpful tb me per-
sonally. They were courteous 
and far less evasive than the 
Russians on my visits to the 
U.S.S.R. 
Agency Cooperative. 
The International Tourist 
Bureau, a government agency 
that handles all foreign visi-
tors, made every arrangement 
I requested, took me every-
where I asked to go. While 
traveling in the rural areas, I 
would spot farmers working 
In the fields and tell the 
driver, "Stop!" The interpreter 
and I would have a visit with 
the farmers then move on, 
often stepping unannounced at 
an agricultural college or hos-
,. 
Many of the Impromptu 
conversations which resulted 
became spirited give and take. 
I pulled no punches in refut-
ing charges against the U.S. 
but the debates produced no 
winners. 
As in my visit to the Soviet 
Union this summer I raised 
the point: "But war is so ter-
?rible today that there can be 
no victors and so there will 
be no war." 
I found that this did not go 
over as well in Red China as 
it did in Russia because 'the 
Chinese seem to have a fatal-
istic acceptance that if war 
results from their effort to 
take what they believe right-
fully belongs to China then 
war it must be and the U.S. 
will be at fault. 
Party chairman Mao Tse- , 
tung has said that China is I 
the only nation that can af-
ford a war: "We can lose 300 
million Chinese and still have 
300 million left." 
A diplomat has reported a 
grim conversation with Mao 
in which the party leader said: 
"World War I set up socialism 
In Russia. World War II set 
up socialism in the peoples' 
democracies of Europe and 
China. World War III might 
see the death of capitalism 
and the triumph of socialism 
around the world." 
How does one evaluate such 
statements as these? I only 
know this for sure: all this 
war spirit is getting a fan-
tastic surge of production out 
of the Chinese workers, known 
officially as "the' great leap 
-----
forward in agriculture and in-
dustry." 
Pledge to Crush U.S. 
In one rural commune they 
had set up 5000 tiny blast 
furnaces to make pig iron, 
promised another 5000 by the 
end of October as their an-
swer to American "aggres-
sion." 
A letter by a worker in a 
truck factory said: "We'll 
crush American aggressors be-
neath the wheels of our 
trucks." 
Fukien province farmers, 
close to the guns twined at 
Quemoy, adopted the slogan, 
"More grain to support the 
front: heavy blows to beat 
the U.S. wolves." 
When I visited the big open: 
cut coal mine in Fushun the 
secretary told me the workers 
were so upset they had voted' 
to create "20 sputniks"-20 
new types of machinery to 
make for more efficient pro-
duction. 
During the past month most 
factories and communes have 
organized militia units. I saw 
them drilling with rifles or 
wooden sticks. They. were, 
these amateurs asserted, ready 
to march out and repel the 
U.S. Marines who were going 
to land any day now on the 
Chinese mainland "just as 
they did in Lebanon." 
Recall Chiang's Vow. 
"But what makes you think 
America has any idea of at-
tacking China?" I would ask. 
And they would come back 
with Chiang's statements that 
he would lead his army back 
to the mainland and quote 
American admirals as boast-
ing that the U.S. was backing 
up the Formosa government 
with "the greatest striking 
Ipower in history." 
But sometimes they are dis-
dainful of American strength. 
"When America talks so much 
,of its power," a Hankow steel 
official told me gravely, "it is 
really a sign of American 
weakness." 
When I tried to talk back 
to this sort of thing by say-
ing "America never started a 
war, why should it now?" 
they would come back with a 
knowing smile: "And what 
about Korea?" 
For many Chinese are per-
suaded that the US. started 
the war in Korea, just as they 
are sure that the Chinese 
volunteers won It. 
Chinese Humor Wanes. 
"The American people are 
afraid that the Communists, 
want to force -thein form of 
government on the rest of the 
world," I argued. 
Again the smile. "Ridiculous, 
Lenin himself said commu-
nism cannot be -exported." 
Only rarely aid I. encounter 
.. 
',---
flashes of Chinese humor 
which once was so endearing. 
Once .in protesting that I did 
not believe there would be a 
war or I would not be travel-
ing in China, I pulled out a

Ideas Are Target of Peiping Purge 
Third of a Series.

I had been chatting informal 
Iy with a Red Chinese govern. 
ment official for some time 
when he 
leaned forward 
and asked: 
"What did you 
hear about 
China before 
you came 
here ?"-
I decided 
frankness was 
the best policy. 
So I replied: 
"SAine good?but mostly bad." 
"I realize your monopoly 
press slanders our country," 
he said quickly. 
"Well," I countered, "what 
about all of those people you 
shot? Isn't that true?" 
"They deserved to be pun-
ished," he retorted. "They 
would not cooperate with the 
land reform and it was im-
possible to -liberate our potepr 
tial productive capacity with-
out land reform." 
So there it was, a flat? con-
firmation of one of the big 
questions about the Red Re-
public, and uttered with. calm 
assurance that no reasonable 
person could be shocked. 
The British, who recognize 
Peiping and achnittedly have 
more precise sources than 
most Western nations, esti-
mate that Mao Tse-tung's re-
gime actually shot 800,000 to 
1%. million Chinese during thel 
"land reform." 
The American figure is five 
to 10 million, but it may in-
clude some sentenced to prison 
or "rehabilitation." 
A 'Purifying' Process. 
All of these souls are gone 
without a trace, but a new 
kind of purge is evident every. 
where. It is the purge of 
Ideas. 
"What we aim at is to wipe 
out all harmful ideas opposed 
to socialist construction?but 
not the people who harbor 
those ideas," a party official 
told me. 
"And what happens to 
them." 
"They're remolded," he said. 
This "remolding" is perhaps 
the most dramatic single enter-
priSe in Red China. Hundreds 
of thousands?some say even 
millions ? of government offi-
cials, writers, artists and busi-
nessmen have been sent out to 
farms or construction projects 
.,tc; work the "conservative" 
;ideas but of their system's. Or, 
'as the party puts it, "to purify 
themselves rfor communism." 
Three cabinet ministers, top 
authors and movie stars .are 
among intellectual elite put out 
'ft' redeem themselves. 
These are the ones who 
spoke up when Mao published 
a report in 1956 entitled: "Let 
flowers of all kinds blossom. 
diverse schools of thought con-
tend." 
Their sin was in criticizing 
the party. The current doc-
trine puts it this way: the de-
cision has been made that the 
Communist party knows what's 
best ,for the people of China. 
So anything in China is sub-
ject for criticism except the 
Communist party. 
One who, as I, has just come 
from an extensive tour of 
Russia is at once impressed by 
the speed of Mao's campaign 
to communalize life. T h e 
Chinese are hurtling toward 
pure communism at a pace 
that makes Russia look like 
it's standing still. They are 
intoxicated with the? thrill of 
running their own show?
they're no Russian stooges. 
The Russians, with their in-
terpreters tagging along, are 
as "foreign" here as the 
British or this correspondent. 
In Peiping. 30,000 Russian 
technicians live in their own 
compound ? outside the old 
Walled City. They even have 
their own bus system. 
Tito Denounced. 
I heard more Marx quoted 
In Red China than on any 
trip to Russia, heard more de-
nunciation of Yugoslavia's Tito. 
"You're heading for com-
munism faster than Russia," I 
observed to a government 
official. 
"Don't forget we've had the 
benefit of Soviet leadership"?
and then with a smile?"and 
of Soviet :..istakes." 
In most factories I saw 
Russian machinery. In every 
Wel I ate in the same dining 
.00rn with Soviet technicians: 
lowever, I saw no more evi-
dence that Russia is running 
China than that American 
technical assistance people are 
running Nehru's India. 
spent a month traveling 
in Russia before touring Red 
China. There is a significant 
contrast. Russia seems to. be 
backing off from pure com-
munism, using profit and in-
centive of private ownership 
to . get more production, espe-
cially in argiculture. 
This? is "capitalistic devia-
tion" in China, where there 
is a whirlwind campaign to 
organize communal groups of 
about 2000 families each 
where all farming, trading, in-
dustry, schooling and militia 
are consolidated. 
Wives 'Emancipated.' 
I was told that the com-
munes are run by committees 
elected by "representatives of 
the people." These "representa-
tives" themselves are elected 
by the residents of the com-1 
mune who have "proved them-
selves worthy" to vote. 
Farmers are paid like fac-
tory workers. Canteens feed 
them three times a day so 
housewives can be "emanci-
pated" from their grinding 
stones and rice pots to work 
with rake or lathe. 
If a farmer rips his pants, 
he gets them mended in a 
communal tailor shop. Laun-
dry is done the same way. 
The kids, are parked in state 
kindergartens sometimes for 
the day, sometimes all week. 
Some of the communes are 
experimenting with a system 
whereby the farmer and his 
wife work apart all week and 
only live together weekends. 
Russia tried some of these 
stunts early in the- revolution 
but the Chinese seem bent on 
starting communism at "A" 
despite anything that may be 
said about learning f rom 
Russian errors. 
Impressive Progress. 
The real test may come 
when the Chinese peasant, who 
was first given the land after 
his landlord was shot, then 
asked to give it up, next is 
asked to part with the family 
pig which usually is tied out-
side his front door. The Chi-
nese farmer and his pork are 
not lightly parted. 
To the traveler returned to 
China after two decades, the 
changes one sees cannot help 
but impress. The old China 
was a dirty place, with open 
sewers, flies on the meat and 
the same village pond water 
used for washing and cooking. 
In the new China they are 
putting the sewers under-
ground and city streets are 
constantly being washed and 
swept. Policemen and school-
girls carry fly swatters and 
the common fly is practically 
public enemy No. 1. 
Tips Are an Insult. 
In the old China, petty 
thievery was cOmmon. In 1958, 
I did not bother to lock my 
hotel room door. A hotel em-
ployee made a dash to the 
railroad station to return a 
dime notebook I had left. The 
honor system is being intro-
duced for distributing stamps, 
candy, cigarets and other 
goods. 
"Cunishaw" was a way of 
Chinese life; today tips are 
an insult. 
Alcoholism is unknown. Gone, 
too, are forced marriage of 
the young, selling of children 
by poor peasants and prosti-
tution. Homes have been set 
up in Shanghai to re-educate 
"the girls" to what is gravely 
described as "a more useful 
profession." 
T w o Swiss businessmen 
made passes at girls in Shang-
hai a few months ago and 
they are still in jail!

 Nation of Hate?
Red China Leaping Forward, 
Fourth of a Series.

"M altliu s," said the pro-
fessor, arid my startled' look 
must have amused him. 
"We're not 
worried about 
Malthus." 
The speak-
er was an eco-
nomist from 
the .Economic 
Research In-
stitute of Pei-
ping and he 
spoke scorn-
fully. His ref-
erence, of course was to 
Thomas Albert Malthus, a 
British curate who died 124 
years ago but whose theory 
that an unchecked population 
far outruns the growth of 
food supply is still the stuff 
that population arguments 
are based upon. 
Red China's future hopes 
?to feed its expanding 
masses and to become a mod-
ern industrial powe r?rest 
squarely on the ability of 500 
million hoe-swinging peasants 
to prove the thoughful curate 
wrong. 
Theirs is an awesome task: 
to feed 640 million persons. 
And every day another 40,000 
mouths demanding rice! 
Problem for Future. 
Population experts project 
a population for mainland 
China in 25 years of one bil-
lion. By then the proble in 
will be to feed this horde with 
only three-tenths of an acre 
per person. (The U.S. today 
has. two acres of cultivated 
land per person.) 
Over and over I asked the 
question during my 7500-mile 
trip across lted China, visit-
ing farms in the major food-
producing areas. Invariably 
the answers exuded the brash 
confidence of one fertilizer 
factory engineer who boasted: 
"We can feed 15 billion peo-
ple if we have to." 
China has two secret weap-
ons for dealing with what 
must surely be the biggest 
food problem any nation ever 
faced: (1) the "great leap 
forward in agriculture," and 
(2) birth control, the "guat 
leap" backward in babies. 
Grain Output Tripled. 
The "great leap" is Corn-
munist jargon for the most 
gigantic mobilization of man-
power in history. By compari-
.sion the building of the Pyra-
mids of Cheops and the Great 
Wall of China were ambitious 
doodles. 
Backward at Same Time 
China claims her food grain 
production was tripled in the 
past tWo years. Few Western-
ers believe this. 
"The more people we have, 
the more workers we have to 
produce food and industrial 
products," the Peiping eco-
nomist went on. 
Lack of Machinery. 
Every doctor I met in farm 
and factory told me frankly 
that he gave birth control ad-
vice to the women. 
What is the picture on these 
farms which must do the im-
possible in order. that Red 
China may "leap forward"? 
It's sweating, bare-backed men 
swinging heavy hoes . . . 
- barefoot women cutting heads 
of rice by hand . . . wispy 
beared oldsters using wooden 
rakes and pitchforks ... chil-
dren winnowing grain with 
the help of the wind ... wiry 
men straining to pull a wood-
en plow because they had no 
donkey or cow ...patient 
peasants pumping irrigation 
water by treadmill. 
The lack of machinery is 
appalling; not once did I get 
close enough to a working 
tractor ot take a picture. 
How much food do the 
farms turn out? On a farm 
cooperative near Peiping, 
where 1602 workers farm 1661 
acres, they say they produced 
250 bushels of wheat per acre 
and then grew a crop of sweet 
potatoes. 
A co-op near Shenyang said 
they got 200 percent more 
food production this year 
than last by jumping irrigat-
ed acres from 600 to 1600 
acres. 
Fantastic Yields. 
? A vegetable cooperative 
near Shanghai says they har-
vest from 12 to 21 crops of 
vegetables a year. A com-
mune near Hankow told me 
their two crops of rice made 
2Z5 bushels per acre. Their 
cotton was 360 pounds per 
acre but next year's goal is 
1800 pounds per acre. 
China claims its fantastic 
yields this year are built on 
three things: More irrigation, 
more double cropping, more 
fertilizer, and deep plowing. 
A Red farm planner told 
me: "In the Old China we ir-
rigated 39.4 million acres. 
Last year,. 85.8 million acres. 
And this year 160.2 million 
acres, or 55 percent of our 
total acreage." 
Weary peasants ordinarily 
take a month off at Chinese 
New Year's in February. This 
year more than 200 million 
people, swarming like ants, 
dug canals, built dams and 
reservoirs, made terraces on 
mountainsides. The farm 
force was augmented by mil-
lions of office and fact or y 
workers, artists and writers, 
movie actors and bureaucrats 
because the new Chinese Com-
munist line is that everyone 
must do some hard physical 
labor. 
Big Irrigation Jump. 
Their implements? Big hoes 
to dig; baskets slung on a 
springy carrying pole to car-
ry the dirt. Their results? 
They claim their irrigated 
acreage jumped by a whop-
ping 74 million acres. 
Of chemical fertilizer, I saw 
little. And the only fertilizer 
I a ct or y I visited wouldn't 
give production figures. Ev-
ery other factory seemed 
happy to boast of its progress. 
China is importing all the 
fertilizer she can afford to 
buy and is trying to buy 
fertilizer plants and equip-
ment abroad. 
Experimental plots have 
given the Chinese a great 
psychological -b o o s t. Each 
farm was encouraged to see 
how much it could raise on 
a test plot of rice, sorghum, 
cotton and tobacco. 
I was quoted yield figures 
on some plots I saw which 
my farm brothers are going 
to read and say: "Somebody's 
lying?that impossible!" For 
example: Corn, 3850 bushels 
per acre, when the top re-
corded U.S. yield is 300 bush-
els per acre. Wheat, 1100 
bushels per acre, when the 
world record is 230 bushels. 
Most fantastic claim of all: 
On a commune near Tientsin, 
I saw a rice plot estimated 
to yield 11,000 bushels per 
acre. They had jammed rice 
sprouts at the rate of 360,-
000 to the acre, root to root. 
Could Spell Trouble. 
Few Westerners will be-
lieve the Chinese yield fig-
ures. If they are anywhere 
near right, China's hopes and 
plans may go forward. If the 
real crop is much less?and 
I'm afraid it is?I'm sure Dr. 
Malthus would agree it could 
spell real trouble for Mao 
Tse-tung's optimistic econo-
mists. 
For not only the needs of 
today but the dreams of to-
morrow depend upon a pro-
digious increase in food.

Red China Air Scented by Steel 
Fifth of a Series. 
By JOHN STROHM.

Almost everywhere you go 
In Red China your nostrils 
are assailed by a sulphurous 
smoke that re-
minds you of 
Gary or East 
Chicago. 
Red China is 
out to make 
the "great 
leap forward" 
in steel pro-
duction by 
twin pro-
gram s, one 
old, one new. 
In farmyards, on school 
playgrounds, college cam-
puses and vacant lots, the 
belching vest pocket blast 
furnaces of the old way polka-
dot the landscape with smears 
of smoke. And those who 
stoke them with hand-crushed 
ore, coal and limestone are 
the farmer and his wife, the 
school children a n d college 
kids. 
Thus did America produce 
pig iron in the mid-1800's on 
myriad "plantations" close to 
the land (for ore) and the for-
est (for charcoal). They are 
not new to China, but the pro-
gram has exploded in size. 
I must have keen more 
than 1000 of these furnaces 
during my tour of Mao's do-
main. They range from three 
to 30 feet high, their output 
from 100 pounds to 100 tons 
daily. 
How They Reason. 
Red China's economists rea-
soned thusly: To save trans-
port, take the furnace to the 
raw materials and only move 
the pig iron to the factory. 
The iron pigs are fed to the 
great new rolling mills like 
those I saw at Hankow and 
Anchan. 
But Red China is by no 
means betting on its back-
yard iron-mongers. At An-
chan I visited a sprawling 
mill where 100,000 workers 
making an average of $32 a 
month turn out one-third of 
China's iron and steel. 
Indeed, the Chinese are 
demonstrating an aptitude 
for manufacture that few 
Westerners once would have 
believed. I talked with busi-
nessmen I rom Denmark, 
Britain and Germany and the 
consensys of their comment 
was: "Chinese learn fast, can 
operate machinery well." 
Several Red engineers and 
plant managers told me they 
keenly desired to see U.S. 
plant inr1 hut ronl. 
? Declassified and Approved 
Ized that was impossible, be-
cause, as one put it, "Your 
Mr. Dulles has erected a Bam-
boo Curtain that would pre-
vent it." (This assertion that 
the Bamboo Curtain was 
erected by the U.S. and not 
Red China is a recurrent Red 
refrain.) 
Higher Goals Set. 
"Before the liberation," a 
Chinese plant official told 
me, "we produced only 923,-
000 tons of steel and 1.8 mil-
lion ton of pig iron. Last 
year we produced 5.3 million 
tons of steel. This year's 
goal is 10 million tons and 
next year's is 20 million? al-
most as much as Britain." 
Britain's net tonnage of 
Ingots and steel for castings 
In 1957 was 24,300,000. Arneri-
ca'ss was 112,700,000. Thus 
Britain's production is the 
first plateau the struggling 
Chinese hope to. reach. They 
talk about achieving eco-
nomic parity with Britain in 
10 to 15 yeam A few opti-
mistic Communists even talk 
of five. 
Who knows whether these 
goals are solid prospects or 
wishful planning? One only 
sees today that there is a vast 
flexing of musc/o, a tremend-
ous state-directed upsurge- of 
effort n cl that the first signs 
on an industrial civilization 
are beginning to stamp.them-
selves upon mainland China. 
China's industry may not 
look impressive to an Amer-
ican but there are indications 
the Russians have._ begun to 
sit up and regard it with 
some seriousness. 
And the visitors from the 
rice paddy and ox cart coun-
tries of Asia who come here 
to visit stand around in gog-
gle-eyed amazement at Red 
China's trickle of industrial 
wonders. 
An Atomic Reactor. 
Theret an atomic reactor 
(which I did not see) and 
they're turning out television 
sets, jet planes, automobiles, 
tractors and machine tools. 
At an export exhibit in 
Shanghai I picked up sales 
literature in English for 6500 
products which were said to 
be exported to 82 countries. 
Copies of American tooth-
paste, sewing machines and 
fountain pens were easily 
recognized. 
China makes The "East 
Wind" automobile but you 
can't own a car in China so 
everyone except high govern-
ment officials walks, bicycles 
or goes by pedicab. 
An industrial exhibition 
showed a giant crane with a 
five-square-yard bite. But out 
on the dams and irrigation 
ditches construction was by 
tens of thousands of men and 
women, digging, carrying and 
tamping in ways no different 
than when the Great Wall 
was built in 300 A.D. 
Private Business Is Out. 
In Shenyang 1. saw a mod-
ern lathe factory where 5000 
workers were said to be turn-
ing out 4000 precision lathe's 
a year. 
There is no private business 
left in Red China. Everything 
Is government or joint owned. 
This last is a device whereby 
the conscientious capitalist 
'may petition the government 
to make him a joint owner. 
"How did you become a 
joint owner?" I asked a 
woman of 45. 
"I realized that as a capital-
ist I was exPloiting my em-
ployes. I. had to worry about 
getting materials, about com-
petition. So I petitioned the 
government." 
"And how has it worked 
out?" 
"Oh much better. Our pro-
duction has gone up. I get 
the same salary as my in-
come when I owned the shop. 
(This is $92 a month, almost 
twice what the factory mana-
ger is paid.) And I'm paid 
5 percent interest on the 
value of the property for five 
years." 
Money a Big Problem. 
The biggest problem seems 
to be capital. What help the 
Chinese get from the Rtis-
sians and other "people's 
democracies" costs dearly. So 
therefore, her industrial ex-
pansion must be based large-
ly on *hat can be wrung 
from the hides of peasants 
who have struggled for cen-
turies just to keep alive.

Red Chinese Find Food Adequate, Housing Better; 
Schools and Churches Are Under State Thumb 
This is the last article of an exclusive six-part 
report on Red China by John Strohm, the first author 
ized U.S. newsman to penetrate Mao's border. 
By JOHN STROHM.

UESTIONS often asked me since my 50-hour 
flight home after a tour of Red China are: 
"How do the Chinese people live, eat and work 
under communism? What's happened to religion, the 
schools? Are they docile or will they ever revolt?" 
A consolidated reply would be something like 
this: The food is adequate, the housing vastly im-
proved. Schools, churches and all means of public ex-
pression. are in the complete service of the state. 
There was no visible evidence of any disposition to 
resist complete regimentation. 
Light, office work earns a rice or flour ration of a 
pound a day. Workers in steel plants and coal mines get up 
to two pounds a day. Every individual can buy 40 cents 
worth of meat (half a pound) every 
week, with sometimes an extra ra-
tion for Sundays. Each family gets 
a pound of beef monthly per person. 
The cotton cloth ration is up to 
six yards a year per person. 
Chinese wages are edging up. In 
the two dozen plants I visited wages 
average,about $25 a month: The low-
est paid workers get about $12; the 
highest paid, $40. Factory managers 
and top officials get $60 to $75 a 
month. The idea of high wages for 
managers, artists and intellectuals 
such as are paid in the Soviet Union 
would be sinful in China. 
The new regime is putting a sur-
prisingly high priority on apartment 
buildings for industrial workers. 
Near Hankow a hundred apartment buildings ,were put up 
before they started building the new steel mills. 
"Go ahead, knock on any door you like," the secretary 
told me when I asked to visit homes of workers. The door 
I knocked on opened into a large, clean one-room apartment 
for a family of seven. A bed?big but a bit crowded for 
seven?stood in one corner. Their clothes hung in wardrobes. 
They had an alarm clock and a thermo's bottle for hot water, 
two important symbols of an approved standard of living. 
Three families shared a hole-in-the-floor toilet and a 
stone tub laundry. They share t1.4 same kitchen and cook 
over a mud mortar stove, or over a small jar filled with 
charcoal. Their rent bill is $1.25 a month. 
In another worker's apartment in Shenyang, the family 
of eight has a big room with two beds and a tiny separate 
kitchen equipped with gas and a stone sink and running 
water. For monthly rent of $4 they also get a private latrine. 
No Inside Plumbing. 
A diploma on the wall testified that mother has learned 
to read, and is now teaching others. Her husband operates 
a lathe, gets, a very high salary of $48 a month. Beside the 
diploma was a red paper entitled Faintly Program and 
Budget, listing outgo as $14 a month for grain; $10 for 
vegetables; $4 for Water, gas, electricity and rent; $2.80 for 
transportation. 
There were some miscellaneous expenses and a little 
left over for savings. Also, the housewife' agrees to keep 
rooms clean, observe sanitation rules and teach them to the 
family, educate her childien and be a good mother. 
The old homes in the cities and in the country are not 
nearly so nice, have no runnig water, or inside plumbing. 
Theiresidents carry water from open wells or from ponds 
where they do the family washing. The New China does in-
sist that all water be boiled before drinking and the typhoid 
rate Is sharply down. 
Textile workers in Peiping invited me to visit their 
bachelor girls' apartment. Six giggling girls in pigtail's( trou-
sers, and wearing no makeup, shared the room with double-
decked,beds. Rent, 15 cents a month each. The girls had 
joined the militia and were learning to fire rifles. One of 
them showed me a poem she'd written about Chinese in-
dignation over American "imperialism" palle,l "Angry 
The Chinese food wag wonderful. And I became quite 
adept at reaching out with my chopsticks to snare a bit of 
bamboo shoot, goose gizzar4 -or sweet-sour pork .as we all 
ate out of the same dishes. Such delicacies as bird's nest 
soup and sharks' fins are available for a doilar a plate, but 
must be ordered in advance. And they apologized that 
snakes, a Cantonese delicacy, are not:available until winter 
"when their fat helps keep you warm." 
Cultured Laborers. 
I shopped the stores in every town and was amazed at 
the quantity and variety Of goods available and the fact 
people were buying them. Here are some price tags?judge 
thee-Against the wage earner's average monthly salary of 
$25 a month:

- The Chinese assert they are stamping out illiteracy, and 
many counties claim they already have. Most communes 
and factories hold adult .classes in reading and writing. 
Education is compulsory for seven years; middle school is 
optional; college entrance is by examination only. 
The schools of China today from kindergarten to college 
are glorified workshops. This follows the general Commu-
nist line, greatly intensified in recent months, that "educa-
tion must be combined with productive labor." 
So schools adopt mountains and 10 to 12-year-olds take 
a month's trip to plant trees. 
The College of Engineering near Hanko'w in five years 
of existence has an enrollment of 7500. -"We don't give de-
grees," the secretary told me, indicating degrees :vere out 
of step with socialism. In classroom factories the students 
manufactured electric motors and punch presses. 
"In this way students develop into cultured laborers 
with socialist consciousness," I was told by a professor of 
the new line. "Besides," he added, "the work-while-you-study 
program creates wealth for socialism." 
Every Chinese going to school today must study agri-
culture on the theory that "all must work on the farm, some 
time." 
Opera Is a Sellout. 
-Educators have tackled the monumental task of putting 
Chinese picture writing into the Roman alphabet. It takes a 
gigantic typewriter to type Chinese, and then only a limited. 
3000-word vocabulary. So all papers and reconcls are hand 
written. 
Another problem is the score of spoken dialects. My 
interpreter had to have an interpreter in Canton! 
Every factory has a "Worker's Palace of Culture" where 
they Show movies, have rooms for discinsion groups on new 
factory methods or Marxism, for playing.ping pong or cheSs. 
The Chinese Opera is still drawing sellout crowds in 
Peiping where I saw the most famous Chinese actor of the 
past 40 years: Mei Lan Fang. He's in his 60s, always takes 
a woman's part, sings and talks in -high falsetto to accom-
paniment of the discordant two-stringed violin and ear-split-
ting cymbals. 
One Sunday morning in Nanking I attended the Church 
of Christ, a Buddhist temple and a Catholic church with a 
"Friends of World Peace" sign over the door. So those who 
are religiously inclined have churches to go to. ("Most of us 
. have discarded the old superstitions," a Communist official 
told me.) 
There are about five million Catholics in China, but 
foreign priests have been deported and many Chinese priests 
have joined the "Patriotic Priests" movement, which seems 
headed toward a state church. 
Protestant faiths have been consolidated, with the logic 
"If you have the same God, why not the same church?" 
A member of the Nanking Union Theological Seminary 
told me: "Compared with the spirit of competition and even 
befitility that existed between some of the church .bodies in 
the past, we s.ee this consolidation as nothing short of an 
act of God Himself."
