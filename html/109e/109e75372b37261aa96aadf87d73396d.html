 The Izvestia editorial of 3 December on the President's
 interview shows some dissatisfaction among Soviet leaders
 with the outcome of this venture and underlines their sen-
 sitivity to some of the issues the President raised, such
 as the Soviet effort to communize the world and the status
 of the countries of Eastern Europe.   Izvestia rejected the
 President's concept of an international adm nistration of
 the autobahn to West Berlin, and,  in his talks on 1 Decem-
 ber with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, Khrushchev warned
 that if no agreement were reached, the bloc would sign a
 treaty and cut off all military access to Berlin.  The East
 Germans have continued construction of barriers in Berlin
 and on the autobahn and have issued further warnings that
 controls could be tightened if the political situation
 warrants.  At the nuclear test ban talks, the chief Soviet
 delegate privately asserted that no control or inspection
 would be possible until complete and general disarmament
 was fully carried out.

 Fighting between UN and Katangan forces entered its
 third day on 7 December, and statements by the opposing
 sides indicated little disposition for negotiations.  The
 Indian commander of UN forces in Elisabethville has char-
 acterized the former cease-fire as "finished," while Ka-
 tangan authorities exhort the populace to fight.  The UN
 continues to control the Elisabethville airport, and UN
 forces were increased from around 2,900 to 3,650 on 5 and
 6 December.   Tshombb arrived in Brazzaville from Paris on
 7 December, en route to Elisabethville.   New clashes may
 be imminent in northern Katanga, where Stanleyville-based
 Congolese Army forces have continued their advance toward
 the Katangan-reinforced towns of Kongolo and Baudouinville.,
 Gizenga, after attacking the Adoula government in a speech
 delivered at Stanleyville, has announced that he is return-
 ing "to the front" in northern Katanga.

 t solution of the political impasse and an end to the
 general strike appeared close on 7 December, although nu-
 merous problems remained to be worked out.   The antagonism
 between the opposition and the military has been aggravated
 by the strike.  All the principals in the negotiations of
 the past week, however, are eager to prevent Communist in-
 roads, and any interim government resulting from current ne-
 gotiations will probably be controlled by political moder-
 ates, with the military playing an important role.

 A meeting of the three princes continues to be delayed
 by the inability of the Vientiane and Souvanna factions to
 agree on a site and on security arrangements.   Phoumi's
 continuing redeployment of major units may be in prepara-
 tion for a renewal of fighting or a de facto partition,in
 the event of a breakdown of negotiations.  At Geneva,
 agreement was reached on 4 December on draft articles af-
 fecting the roles of the conference co-chairmen and the
 International Control Commission.  The remaining issues
 depend on the presence of a united Laotian delegation.

 Anti-American editorials in the Saigon press have
 tapered off.   South Vietnamese officials feared that the
 press campaign would benefit only the Communists and might
 encourage plotting against Diem.  The campaign has given
 rise to further rumblings of discontent over the govern-
 ment's failure to curb Viet Cong expansion.  Diem has taken
 steps to implement previously announced organizational
 changes, but the effectiveness of these measures is ques-
 tionable.   Communist China has issued a warning a ainst US
 activity in South Vietnam.                                                        25X1

 Bulgarian party First Secretary Zhivkov, in a move
 to strengthen his position, last week removed Stalinist
 former party boss Vulko Chervenkov from the politburo and
 may have demoted other hard-liners in the party apparatus.
 Zhivkov used the renewed criticisms of Stalinism at the
 recent Soviet party congress to justify his action.  He
 has set limits on any purge for the time being, however,
 by stating that Chervenkov will be allowed to retain
 party membership.  The present measures may not be enough
 to prevent a resurgence of the party's Stalinist ma orit
 before the party congress slated for next August.                      25X1

 The bloc's moves to provide Cuba with economic sup-

 a year and have been more extensive than those taken on
 behalf of any other country.  Although Cuba's economic
 difficulties continue,  it is obtaining minimum import
 needs from bloc countries and has found there a market
 for about four fifths of its sugar crop.   Bloc arms have
 greatly strengthened the Castro regime's military capabil-
 ity, and the bloc's attention now is shifting to imple-
 menting aid agreements in an effort to make Cuban economic
 development an example for the rest of Latin America.

 India's show of force in the vicinity of the Portu-
 guese exclave of Goa is part of the recent step=up in India's
 continuing campaign to press Portugal to give up its ex-
 claves in western India.  The military buildup will give
 New Delhi enough power on the scene to force the Portuguese
 out if it chooses.   Despite rising election year pressures,
 however, Nehru is unlikely to order a military thrust in
 the absence of a clear case of Portuguese Provocation or
 large-scale civil disorders.                                                     25X1

 President Sukarno's belligerent speech on 30 November
 indicates a lessening of confidence that Indonesia can
 realize its claim to West New Guinea through a peaceful
 settlement.  Although Indonesia is likely to continue its
 policy of diplomatic pressures combined with a military
 buildup for the next few months,.an eventual resort to
 force appears increasingly likely.

 The next few weeks are expected to be critical for
 both the political and the economic evolution of the Common
 Market (EEC),  The French continue to press the other EEC
 members to agree to a loose confederation, and the question
 of European political unity is likely to come to a head
 before the end of the year.   By that time the EEC countries
 must also decide whether to proceed to the tariff cuts and
 other measures in the second of the EEC's three four-year
 transitional stages.  The continuing deadlock on agricul-
 tural policy is a major obstacle.  All these issues have,
 important implications for Britain's bid for membership.

 ELECTIONS IN EL SALVADOR .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 23
 El Salvador's constituent assembly elections on 17
 December will conclude a bitterly fought campaign in which
 the Alliance for Progress has become a basic domestic
 issue.  The provisional military government has found en-
 couragement in the Alliance for Progress for its program
 of long overdue socio-economic reforms, which it hopes to
 perpetuate with the return to constitutional government.
 The entrenched oligarchy and local Communists are strongly
 resisting the reform program and may try to oust the govern-
 ment by force.
 SPECIAL ARTICLES
 .   Page l
 Nearly all of Communist China's foreign policy posi-
 tions--whether in respect to Berlin or Japan, Laos or Cuba,
 South Vietnam or the Congo--are marked by hostility toward
 the US, which Peiping regards as the chief obstacle to the
 achievement of its policy goals.   Even Peiping's quarrel
 with the USSR grew in considerable measure out of differ-
 ences as to how the bloc and the world Communist movement
 should best deal with the US.   Peiping's tactics toward the
 US include affable overtures and expressions of willingness
 to negotiate, either bilaterally or in international coun-
 cils, but always on a basis of equality.  The Chinese Com-
 munist leaders, optimistic as to the eventual settlement in
 their favor of certain Sino-American problems, maintain that
 some American concession is prerequisite to an easing of
 tensions between the two countries.
 THE SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION AND ALGERIA . .  .  .  .  .
 The Secret Army organization (OAS), led by French mil-
 itary officers outlawed for their role in last April's un-
 successful coup and supported by almost all the European
 population of Algeria, now constitutes a serious threat to
 any settlement negotiated between De Gaulle and the pro-
 visional Algerian government  (PAG).  The OAS is in virtual
 control of several areas in Algeria, and engages in exten-
 sive propaganda and terrorist operations in both France
 and Algeria.  The organization could foster continued vio-
 lence aimed at upsetting any French-PAG agreement, or could
 bring about a de facto partition or perhaps even its own
 participation in a negotiated  settlement as the represent-
 ative  of the European population.   Essentially, however,
 the aim of the OAS is probably to force France to retain
 responsibility for Algeria.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE MEEKLY SUMMARY
 WEEKLY REVIEW
 Moscow used an Izvestia
 editorial on 3 December  o re-
 spond to President Kennedy's
 interview with Aleksey Adzhubey.
 Although Izvestia conceded that
 the President had put forward
 "quite a few reasonable ideas,"
 the generally querulous tone of
 the editorial shows some dis-
 satisfaction among the Soviet
 leaders with the outcome of
 this venture and underlines
 their sensitivity to some of the
 issues the President raised,
 such as the USSR's efforts to
 "communize the entire world"'
 and the status of the countries
 of Eastern Europe.
 The strong language reject-
 ing the concept of an inter-
 national administration of the
 autobahn linking West Berlin
 with West Germany probably was
 intended to discourage the West-
 ern powers from introducing any
 formal proposals along these
 lines.   Izvestia termed this
 concept a "worsened version of
 the occupation rights" in West
 Berlin--rights which it said
 the US intends to "expand by
 infringing on the rights" of
 the East German regime. "Such
 plans," said Izvestia, "are
 doomed to failure."
 The editorial portrayed
 the President's remarks re-
 garding an arrangement between
 NATO and the Warsaw Pact as an
 "intention" to "reach agreement
 on a NATO commitment to live in
 peace with the Warsaw Pact
 nations."  Izvestia also stated
 that "we can acc a m the Pres-
 ident's commitment" not to trans-
 fer nuclear weapons to any
 country, and it included his re-
 mark that he would be reluctant
 to see West Germany "acquire a
 nuclear capacity of its own."
 This effort to establish US
 "commitments" on these issues
 suggests that the USSR will
 ;seek to develop this line in
 any negotiations on Berlin and
 Germany.
 In a private conversation
 with Norwegian Foreign Minister
 Lange on 1 December, Khrushchev
 took a strong stand on Berlin
 and Germany, reiterating the
 Soviet position at some length
 His main point was that if no
 agreement could be reached,
 then, "we are in for hard trials"
 because if the bloc signed a
 German  treaty, Western military
 access to West Berlin would be
 cut off if the West did not
 leave the city.
 In explaining the free city
 proposals and plans for UN
 or four-power guarantees, Khru-
 shchev repeatedly referred to
 the need to take Soviet prestige
 into account.  He said that the
 USSR should have the right to
 station a troop contingent to-
 gether with the Western garrisons
 in West Berlin but  would not
 necessarily  exercise  this
 right.
 Khrushchev was somewhat
 equivocal on the links between a
 four-power agreement on Berlin
 and a subsequent peace treaty.
 He appeared to indicate that
 there must be an agreement re-
 garding the signing of a treaty or

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 treaties and that some states
 would sign with both Germanys
 and some with only one Germany,
 and the agreement on Berlin
 would beappehdedas a protocol
 to "the" treaty.
 Walter Ulbricht,  in an
 address to East German party
 leaders on 1 December, also
 sharply rejected international
 control over the autobahn.  He
 alleged that the President ad-
 mitted in the Adzhubey inter-
 view that two German states
 exist and realized that unifi-
 cation of Germany within NATO
 was impossible.  He added that
 in light of such views,  "it can
 only be welcomed if President
 Kennedy is in favor of negotia-
 tions for the time being on
 Berlin" and afterward on re-
 lations between the Warsaw Pact
 and NATO.
 Polish party leader Gomulka,
 in a speech on 2 December, also
 dealt with Berlin.   His most
 significant statement was that
 an agreement between the USSR
 and the Western powers on the
 problem of West Berlin would
 be included in the peace treaty
 signed by the bloc with East
 Germany, but that this approach
 would be reversed if the West
 delayed negotiations on Berlin
 indefinitely.   In that event,
 he said, the bloc would return
 to its previous stand that the
 problem of Western access to
 Berlin would have to be dis-
 cussed directly with the U1-
 bricht regime.   The Soviet
 version of Gomulka's remarks
 described them as an "exhaus-
 tive answer" as to why the bloc
 no longer regarded 31 December
 as the deadline for the con-
 clusion of a peace treaty.
 Berlin
 Despite the apparent will-
 ingness of Moscow to await the
 outcome of Western talks in
 Paris, the bloc has carried out
 a number of demonstrative moves
 in Berlin and on the autobahn
 and has supported these actions
 with new warnings.  On 30 Novem-
 ber TASS warned that systematic
 movements of US troops along
 the autobahn for exercises in
 West Germany were intended to
 include Berlin within the sphere
 of NATO and were fraught with
 "dangerous consequences."  In
 his address on 1 December, U1-
 bricht took up these charges

 way and a metal drop-gate which
 can be lowered to close the
 inside lanes.      By channeling
 all traffic into a single lane
 the new barriers could force
 delays and cause inconvenience
 and will have the effect of
 eliminating any distinction
 between Allied and non-Allied
 vehicles.   Construction is also
 in progress at the other end
 of the autobahn near Marien-
 born,  but its nature is not
 yet clear.
 On the eve of the movement
 of a US battle group to Berlin,
 the East German deputy foreign
 minister warned that US troops
 were not guaranteed passage
 because the recent designation
 of the Berlin command as the
 Berlin Brigade changed its
 character to NATO troops.   On
 7 December, the first elements
 of the battle group passed the
 Soviet checkpoint without dif-
 ficulty.
 The USSR has made no new
 moves regarding Finland since
 the Khrushchev-Kekkonen talks
 on 25 November.  The Finnish
 situation was not raised in the
 talks between Lange and Khru-
 shchev,  and the Soviet leader
 apparently took a conciliatory
 line and agreed that Soviet-
 Norwegian relations were good.
 However, Foreign Minister Gromyko,
 in prior conversation with Lange,
 argued that, while opportunities
 for improving bilateral relations
 existed,  "full confidence" could
 be developed only if Norway left
 NATO.
 Lange made a detailed
 defense of Norwegian policy
 and took up accusations against
 Norway point by point.   He said
 that Norway did not want changes
 in the Nordic area but that
 events elsewhere--i.e., Finland--
 would make it necessary to con-
 sider modifications in Nor-
 wegian policy--apparently a
 warning that Norway would
 strengthen its NATO ties if
 new pressure were exerted on
 Finland.
 The relaxation of Soviet
 pressure on Finland has been
 accompanied by an intensi-
 fication of propaganda on
 the proposed NATO Baltic Com-
 mand.  Timed to coincide with
 the expected consideration
 of the proposal by the Danish
 parliament, an Izvestia ar-
 ticle strongly criticized the
 Baltic Command and warned that
 military cooperation between
 Bonn and Copenhagen was "seriously
 aggravating the situation in
 the Baltic and complicating
 the situation of the neutral
 neighbors of Denmark."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Nuclear Test Ban Talks
 The first private con-
 versation between the Western
 and Soviet chief delegates
 since the nuclear test ban
 talks resumed at Geneva pro-
 vided further strong evidence
 that the USSR's primary purpose
 is to build a strong record
 contrasting Western refusal
 to end all tests with Soviet
 willingness to accept an imme-
 diate moratorium.
 Soviet delegate Tsarapkin
 on 30 November made the sweeping
 claim that "there could be no
 control or inspection of any
 kind until general and complete
 disarmament was completely
 carried out."  He admitted that
 the Soviet proposals would be
 "in effect a moratorium for-
 ever on all nuclear tests,"
 and claimed that it would be
 well received in the UN, where
 the Soviet Union could get
 as many votes for it as other
 "ban the bomb" resolutions.
 Tsarapkin also asserted that
 no matter what the USSR had
 done in the interim or what
 the West might say about
 inadequate controls, world
 opinion would not accept the
 West's refusal to go forward
 with its own proposal of 3
 September to ban atmospheric
 tests.
 Tsarapkin's line suggests
 that the next Soviet move will
 probably be an effort at the UN
 to gain an endorsement for a
 temporary moratorium on all
 testing and approval of the
 Soviet draft treaty's simplified
 approach.  The heavy Soviet
 reliance on the US-UK proposal
 of 3 September to justify
 Moscow's draft treaty suggests
 that Soviet leaders may modify
 their treaty proposal and call
 for an immediate ban on atmos-
 pheric tests if a moratorium
 is agreed to on all other test-
 ing.  They probably believe
 that the West would have to
 reject this also.
 To support its charges
 against the West, Moscow has
 reiterated its earlier warning
 that if the "Western powers"
 continued testing--"underground
 included"--the Soviet Union
 would be compelled "to hold
 nuclear weapons tests, as it
 will be necessary for the con-
 solidation of its defense
 capacity."  Moscow promptly
 charged that the 3 December US
 underground test demonstrated
 Western "hypocrisy" at Geneva.
 These repeated warnings and
 denunciations suggest that
 Moscow believes that the threat
 of a continuation of tests
 by the USSR will reinforce the
 Soviet position at the UN and
 increase neutralist support for
 a moratorium on testing while
 negotiations continue.  Moscow is
 also probably confident that the
 US would reject such an uncontrolled
 moratorium and that the Soviets
 could exploit a clash between neu-
 trals and the West in New York,

 Fighting between UN and Ka-
 tangan forces entered its third
 day on 7 December, and statements
 by the opposing sides indicated
 little disposition to negotiate.
 The UN Command, while build-
 ing up its troop strength pre-
 paratory to ground action, has
 moved first to destroy Katangans
 air capabilities.   On 6 December,
 UN aircraft--Swedish and Indian
 jet fighters and bombers--at-
 tacked Katangan airfields, de-
 stroying runways, fuel supplies,
 and aircraft on the ground.  The
 single Fouga jet trainer which
 gave air superiority to Katanga
 in September has reportedly
 been immobilized.   The UN Com-
 mand now claims control of Ka-
 tangan air space.
 It is not yet clear whether
 the command intends to use air-
 craft against Katangan troops,
 but such a move might prove de-
 cisive.   On 7 December, UN air-
 craft reportedly carried out a
 successful air attack on a Ka-
 tangan ammunition dump near
 Elisabethville.
 The main UN force is at
 the Elisabethville airport,
 which the UN controls.   UN forces
 are also in control of the UN
 headquarters buildings on the
 edge of the city.   Fighting con-
 tinues at the headquarters,
 along the road to the new air-
 port, and at the old, unused
 airport, where Katangan forces
 are dug in.   With the addition
 on 6 December of 650 Swedish
 and Irish troops, UN strength
 now stands at 3,650, with an
 additional Nigerian battalion
 slated to be added.
 UN civilian chief Linner
 has issued instructions to UN
 officials in Elisabethville "to
 end the situation there as quick-
 ly and effectively as possible."
 Linner is also reported to have
 said that now was the time to
 crush Katanga and that he in-
 tended to "denude" the Congo of
 UN forces elsewhere to build up
 his strength in Katanga.   The
 UN military commander in Elisa-
 bethville,  Indian Brigadier Raja,
 stated publicly that there could
 be no negotiations.   Katangan
 leaders have made equally belli-
 cose and "fight to the finish"
 statements, and have exhorted
 the populace to fight to the end.
 The outbreak of hostilities
 on 4 December followed a series
 of incidents beginning on 28 No-
 vember involving beatings and
 murders of UN soldiers and offi-
 cials by poorly disciplined Ka-
 tangan gendarmes.   Counteractions
 and demands of the UN military,
 and particularly bellicose reac-
 tions from UN Indian troops,
 created an atmosphere of dis-
 trust, and led Katangans to be-
 lieve rumors that the UN forces
 were about to move against
 TshombG's mercenaries and dis-
 arm the Katangan gendarmerie.
 Before the outbreak, UN
 officials in the Congo and in
 New York had stressed that the
 rotation of UN troops would de-
 lay for as long as three to four
 months any UN attempt to imple-
 ment the recent Security Council
 resolution which again authorized
 the use of force to rid Katanga
 of its white mercenaries.   Up
 to 3 December, senior UN repre-
 sentative Urquhart in Katanga
 had stressed the need to rely

 Mutual distrust has been
 high since the UN-Katanga clash
 in September, each side frustrat-

 job.  UN officials insisted prior
 to the renewed outbreak that
 French mercenaries were master-

 sonnel and were determined to
 provoke a UN military attack
 in order to justify a Katangan
 counterthrust.  Tshomb6, before
 he left for Europe, made strong
 anti-UN statements in reaction
 to the Security Council resolu-

 for all-out guerrilla warfare
 against the UN forces.   Rumors
 were also widespread in Elisa-
 betbville that Brigadier Raja
 was eager to "clean-up" the city.
 Katangan leaders, prodded
 by pro-secessionist Europeans,
 may believe that another UN de-
 feat would end attempts to end
 Katangan autonomy by force.
 The UN airlift of UN rein-
 forcements to Elisabethville has
 provoked a strong anti-American
 reaction among Katangan leaders.
 No Americans in Katanga  (65-70
 in Elisabethville and 135 else-
 where) have yet been molested,
 .but Katangan Foreign Minister
 Kimba was so. angry after the UN
 air strikes that he put US Consul
 Hoffacker under house arrest.
 Tshomb6 also has voiced anti-
 American sentiments.  More wide-
 spread fighting between the Con-
 golese Army and Katangan forces
 is apparently imminent in north-
 .ern Katanga.   Fighting was re-
 ported-in late November north
 of Kongolo, Tshombd's main  ;
 stronghold in the area.   Aided
 by the UN, Stanleyville-based
 forces under General Lundula
 have taken Albertvi.lle,.Nyunzu,
 .and Kabalo without resistance.
 Elements of the forces are
 reported moving south toward
 Baudouinville, which was recent-
 ly reinforced by Tshomb6.  The ad-
 vance may be hastened by the im-
 mobilization of Katangan aircraft.
 GenlDral Mobutu's troops, who
 retreated in disorder in October
 after their foray-Into Katanga,
 are still, in Kasai.  Adoula now
 may order these troops back into
 Katanga.
 Tshombd, who had gone to Paris
 reportedly on his way to a Moral
 Rearmament conference in Brazil,
 now is en route back to Elisabeth-
 ville via Brazzaville.   His planned
 South American trip was probably
 in fact connected with his efforts
 to obtain diplomatic recognition
 of Katanga.
 25X1
 Tshomb6, while in Brazzaville en
 route to Europe,  requested a
 meeting with Adoula, apparently
 on a raft in the Congo River.
 Adoula reportedly rejected
 Tshombe's gesture, insisting that
 Tshomb6 come to Leopoldville.  The
 improbability of a negotiated
 settlement between the two is in-
 dicated also by Adoula's rejection
 of suggestions pushed by Belgium,
 Britain, and France that a high-
 level mediator be appointed to
 bring about a settlement.
 Gizenga returned briefly
 to Stanleyville from northern
 Katanga to deliver a radio blast

 to push the invasion of Katanga.
 He apparently is trying to com-

 all-party conference he called

 His announcement that he was
 "returning to the front" and
 his call for all Congolese Army
 forces to follow his lead sug-
 gest he still hopes to achieve
 ascendancy over Adoula by pos-
 ing as the victor against Tshomb6.
 Most of Gizenga?s former nation-
 alist supporters contest his
 claims to leadership as Lumumba's
 heir and for the moment give
 their support to Adoula.
 Adoula on 2 December ac-
 credited the diplomatic repre-
 sentatives of the Soviet Union,
 Czechoslovakia, and Poland.
 This move is almost certainly
 the result of pressures on him
 by the "nationalist" members
 of his government.   Adoula,
 himself, however, probably sees
 advantages in the move.   The
 Soviet Union has offered mili-
 tary and economic aid.   He may
 believe that this offer and
 Soviet recognition of Leopold-
 ville as the legal Congolese
 government give him not only
 assurance against renewed So-
 viet support of Gizenga, but
 also an opportunity to press

 Balaguer would resign the pres-
 idency within a few weeks after
 the council's formation, possi-
 bly before the end of December;
 he presumably would be succeeded
 by a member of the newly-named
 council.   The cabinet would be
 divided between the opposition
 and the present government, with
 the majority of the ministries
 going to the opposition.   Con-
 gress would be recessed after
 passing the necessary implement-
 ing legislation,  and would re-
 main so until replaced by next
 year's election.
 This plan, which embodies
 extensive concessions by Bal-
 aguer, also meets the Pres-
 ident's insistence that he not
 be forced to resign and that the
 solution not break constitu-
 tional order.   A constitutional
 amendment, however, will be
 necessary to establish the
 Council of State.   UCN intransi-
 gents, who blocked an earlier
 agreement that had been accept-
 ed both by Balaguer and by UCN
 President Viriato A. Fiallo,
 will probably find this plan
 acceptable, although wrangling
 over such points as the date
 of Balaguer's resignation, his
 successor, the division of cab-
 inet posts, and--most important--
 the position which the armed
 forces are to have in the in-
 terim regime, may cause fur-
 ther difficulties.
 Unlike the "solution" ear-
 lier proposed by armed forces
 chief Rodriguez Echevarria,
 this plan could result in a
 government free of military
 domination.   It is probable,
 however, that General Rodri-
 guez will insist on retaining
 an important role in the in-
 terim government.  Opposition
 leaders seem confident that
 Rodriguez will accept the plan.
 The 66-year-old Fiallo is   25X6

 basically anti-US, although he
 and a number of other UCN lead-

 All principals in the ne-
 gotiations of the past week are
 eager to prevent Communist in-
 roads, and an interim govern-

 will probably be controlled by
 political moderates.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The anti-American campaign
 in the government-controlled
 Saigon press has subsided; re-
 cent editorials claim that
 "public misunderstanding" has
 been dispelled by assurances
 that US aid has no conditions
 attached.  The attacks on US
 policies tapered off after top
 South Vietnamese officials be-
 came concerned that the cam-
 paign could benefit only the
 Communists and might encourage
 opposition plotting against the
 government.
 The press campaign has
 given rise to new coup rumors
 and to further rumblings of
 discontent over the government's
 failure to curb Viet Cong expan-
 sion.  Although there is no
 firm indication that any group
 with significant following is
 actively'plotting to overthrow
 Diem, reports indicate that
 civilian oppositionists who
 lack the capability to mount
 action on their own--such as
 members of the once influential
 Dai Viet party and the Cao Dai
 political-religious sect--are
 maneuvering for positions in
 any new government.
 American officials in Sai-
 gon report that reform-minded
 officials in top echelons of
 the government still appear to
 be looking for changes within
 the present framework of Diem's
 rule.   Ranking military offi-
 cers have become increasingly
 vocal in criticizing the polit-
 ical interference of Diem and
 his brother Nhu in military
 operations.
 intensify in all of these cir-
 cles and that a coup cannot be
 ruled out.
 Diem, meanwhile, has an-
 nounced the composition of the
 long-pending National Economic
 Council,   an advisory body pro-
 vided for in the constitution
 and created last March.  The
 council will contain wide rep-
 resentation from business, agri-
 culture, commerce, and trade
 unions as well as economists.
 Diem, on 28 November, also
 signed a decree establishing
 the working structure of the
 new Department of Rural Affairs,
 created in May to coordinate
 government activities in such
 fields as agricultural credit
 and cooperatives and land devel-
 opment and resettlement.   Diem
 has indicated that further broad-
 ening of the government appara-
 tus will be forthcoming. It is
 questionable, however, whether
 these organizations will be al-
 lowed to exert any influence on
 government policies or lead to
 any improvement in government
 efficiency.
 Viet Cong activity con-
 tinues at a high level through-
 out the country,  although no
 major incidents have been re-
 ported recently.   Total govern-
 ment casualties last week ex-
 ceeded estimated Viet Cong
 casualties, with South Vietnam's
 Civil Guard and Self-Defense
 Corps continuing to bear the
 brunt  of government losses.
 Communist China last week
 warned that it "cannot remain
 indifferent" to US activity in
 South Vietnam; the British
 charge in Peiping was handed
 a copy of this government state-
 ment.  The Chinese are reported
 to have stepped up purchases of
 South Vietnamese currency in
 Hong Kong.  These funds prob-
 ably are to be transferred to
 North Vietnam for Communist sub-
 versive operations in the South.
 Emissaries from Hanoi have re-
 cently visited Indonesia, Burma,
 and Cambodia seeking support for
 North Vietnam's public cam-
 paign for "peaceful reunifica-
 tion" of Vietnam.

 Activities of the Secret
 Army Organization  (OAS) have
 been stepped up in Algeria as
 announcement of new French-
 Algerian talks seems imminent.
 Some of the bloodiest Moslem-
 European clashes of the year

 Oran, Algiers, and other cities.
 French security officials, de-

 seem unable to apprehend OAS

 on 1 December denouncing the
 European attacks on Moslems,
 rebel information minister

 reaffirmed the desire of the
 provisional Algerian govern-
 ment             (PAG) to reach a negoti-
 ated settlement.
 The PAG reportedly intends
 to press for Ben Bella's partic-
 ipation at some stage in the for-
 mal negotiations in order to
 broaden the political base of the
 Algerian delegation and to make
 a settlement more binding and
 authoritative. The PAG will prob-
 ably continue to receive support
 in this effort from Morocco, as
 King Hassan II is reported to feel
 that Ben Bella is the "indispen-
 sable man of Algeria" who will be-
 come the chief of state when Al-

 mier Ben Khedda will willingly
 stand  aside   in   favor  of Ben

 BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY DEVELOPMENTS
 Bulgarian party boss Todor
 Zhikov moved at the party's
 central committee meeting on 28
 November to put an end to the
 five-year-long struggle for pow-
 er between his Soviet-supported
 "moderate" group and the majority
 hard-liners.   Using the renewed
 attacks on Stalinism at the re-
 cent Soviet party congress as
 justification, Zhivkov succeeded
 in ousting from the politburo
 ex-party boss Vulko Chervenkov,
 Bulgaria's ruler in the Stalin
 era and the rallying point for
 today's hard-liners.  At the
 same time, Zhivkov obtained the
 appointment to the politburo of
 two new members sympathetic to
 his views--Stanko Todorov, chief
 of the Planning Commission, and
 Mitko Grigorov,  party secretary
 and expert in ideology and dis-
 cipline.
 These moves will probably
 be reflected throughout the
 party apparatus.   Earlier in
 November the party leadership
 in the important Plovdiv Dis-
 trict was shaken up; new dis-
 trict first secretary Stoyan
 Stoyanov--presumably a moderate
 --was one of five candidate mem-
 bers of the central committee
 elevated to full membership at
 the November meeting.
 The possibility of further
 changes in the party apparatus
 was clearly indicated in two
 passages in Zhivkov's speech.
 One, referring to "certain cir-
 cles of the party" and workers
 still "strongly contaminated by
 the germs of the personality
 cult," noted that "work in this
 respect has hot-.been completed."
 Later in his speech, admitting
 that several party members had
 questioned why Khrushchev had
 agreed to postpone signing a
 German peace treaty if the West
 would enter into serious negotia-
 tiob ,:Zhivkov said: "A.t'this :point
 there were other comrades who
 declared that this was a re-
 treat from our line, that we
 are thus exposing ourselves....
 The least that could be said
 about the approach of such peo-
 ple...is that their approach
 is sectarian and doctrinaire."
 Zhikov nevertheless indi-
 cated that punitive action will
 not entail massive purgings but
 will probably consist of re-
 moving certain hard-liners from
 positions of responsibility.
 He told the central committee
 that he intends to retain Cher-
 venkov as a party member, "such
 as he is."  Zhivkov also in-
 dicated that Georgi Dimi.trov,
 the Lenin of the Bulgarian
 party, was to continue to be
 beyond criticism despite the
 fact that Dimitrov, too, was
 a contemporary of Stalin.   By
 these steps Zhivkov apparently
 was seeking to stemapprehen-
 sion among party members and
 to avoid the mistakes follow-
 ing the Soviet 20th party con-
 gress in 1956 when criticisms
 of Chervenkov got out of hand
 and party stability was seri-
 ously threatened.
 Zhikov will have to use
 the period before 20 August
 1962--the date set for the
 eighth party congress--to fur-
 ther reduce the power of the
 hard-liners so as to prevent
 a challenge at the congress.
 They are a majority in the
 party, hold many positions of
 influence, and have a broad
 backing among the membership.
 Continuing economic difficul-
 ties will leave Zhivkov vulner-
 able from both the hard-liners
 and the right-wingers--the re-
 visionists--who as recently as
 last spring were attacked in
 party circles for anti-party
 views.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY St$MARY
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA INTE:WP1tETS THE SoVIET,CONGRESS
 I
 Events at the 22nd Soviet
 party congress caught Czecho-
 slovak Communist party leaders
 off guard and caused consider-
 able disorientation among the
 rank and file.   There was some
 speculation as to whether hard-
 line party boss Novotny should
 be removed.
 Party leaders immediately
 set out to stifle demands within
 the party to liberalize internal
 security policies.   At a central
 committee plenum held two weeks
 after the Soviet congress ad-
 journed,  Novotny attempted to
 justify on ideological  grounds
 his record as party leader and
 to secure central committee ap-
 proval of his recommendations
 for holding a steady internal
 course while carrying out the
 Soviet party line.
 Novotny told the central
 committee that some officials
 had seized on developments at
 Moscow to call for rehabilita-
 tion of those implicated with
 former party secretary Slansky,
 who was executed for Titoism
 and nationalism in 1953.   Such
 demands arise from the belief
 throughout the country that the
 trial and execution were ordered
 by Stalin.   Novotny reasserted
 Slansky's guilt,  since rehabil-
 itation of his collaborators
 would incriminate the present
 leaders who led the purge
 against Slansky.   Novotny ex-
 coriated him for a personality
 cult and for placing the secu-
 rity forces above the party.
 He drew a parallel with Beria,
 and charged that Slansky had a
 similar internal spy network
 aimed against loyal party lead-
 ers.
 In order to explain how
 Slansky could have gotten away
 with his anti-party behavior,
 Novotny was compelled to con-
 demn the late Stalinist party
 chairman,  Klement Gottwald.
 His attack against Gottwald was
 restrained,  however, and was
 supported by a subsequent Pravda
 editorial on 23 November.   In
 effect,  Gottwald remains an
 honored leader of the party,
 the man whose crowning achieve-
 ment was the February 1948 coup
 which placed the Communists in
 power.
 The Czechoslovak party has
 admitted its guilt in having ac-
 corded more reverence to Gott-
 wald's body than to those of
 other party leaders; this error
 is to be corrected immediately.
 Monuments to Stalin are to be
 removed, and henceforth no living
 person will be honored by having
 anything named for him.   More
 suitable means of expressing
 "love of the USSR" are to be
 found.
 The degrading of Gottwald
 may raise new opposition within
 the Czechoslovak party to Novot-
 ny's leadership,  although the
 specific
 Soviet
 endorsement of
 this move
 will
 probably counter
 any such
 trend
 at least tempo-
 rarily.
 Novotny has done noth-
 ing thus
 far
 to meet demands of
 dissatisfied
 party elements who
 want the Slansky trial reviewed
 and want a more liberal inter-
 nal security policy.   These
 elements may still press to
 secure the latter goal in the
 process--now underway--of 'draft-
 ing new criminal,  civil, and

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  STWI(ARY
 BLOC ECONOMIC AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR CUBA
 The bloc's moves to pro-
 vide Cuba with economic support
 and military aid have been in
 full swing for nearly a year
 and have been more extensive
 than those taken on behalf of
 any other country.   Although
 Cuba's economic difficulties
 continue, it is obtaining mini-
 mum import needs from bloc
 countries and has found there
 a market for about four-fifths
 of its sugar crop.   Bloc arms
 have greatly strengthened the
 Castro regime's military capa-
 bility, and the bloc's atten-
 tion now is shifting to imple-
 menting aid agreements in an
 effort to make Cuban economic
 development an example for the
 rest of Latin America.
 A four-year Cuban economic
 plan (1962-65) has been drawn
 up with the help of Soviet and
 satellite advisers, and its suc-
 cess will depend heavily on bloc
 aid.  The plan's four-year dura-
 tion undoubtedly was designed
 to coincide with bloc planning
 periods, most of which end in
 1965.
 Some $357,000,000 in long-
 term economic credits have been
 extended to Cuba so far, and
 more aid is expected.  Aid so
 far has consisted chiefly of
 technical assistance and deliv-
 eries of equipment for a few
 small factories to produce tools
 and consumer items.- Although
 on a modest scale, aid deliv-
 eries are probably on schedule
 and are consistent with Cuban
 economic planning, which empha-
 sizes agricultural development,
 utilization of. existing indus-
 trial capacity, reducing unem-
 ployment, and promoting the pro-
 duction of daily necessities
 before launching the more ambi-
 tious development schemes.
 Future projects call for
 Polish technicians to build two
 shipyards for the construction
 and repair of ocean-going,ves-
 sels of up to 10,000 tons; work
 on the first of these to start
 next year and is to be completed
 by 1965.   An automotive plant'
 built under Czech auspices is
 to begin limited assembly opera-
 tions in February and eventually
 is to produce a wide variety of
 vehicles.   All major Soviet aid
 projects--including an oil re-
 finery, a steel mill, and a new
 nickel plant--are in the prelimi-
 nary stages of designing.   The
 most important work done by the
 USSR in Cuba so far has been an
 extensive geological survey in-
 tended to assess Cuban resources
 and prospects for industrial de-
 velopment.   Communist China re-
 cently dispatched a 50-man team
 of experts to Havana to discuss
 the building of some 24 factories
 provided for under a $60,000,000
 aid agreement.
 Scores of bloc technicians,
 advisers, and trade representa-
 tives travel to and from Cuba
 each month.   Much of their work
 so far has been confined to proj-
 ect surveys, but some are helping
 install equipment, drawing up
 economic plans, and supervising
 or assisting in the operations
 of industries hard pressed by
 the flight of skilled Cuban
 personnel.   Chinese Communist:
 personnel are providing some
 assistance in rice growing and
 livestock breeding.   Hundreds
 of Cuban students, technicians,
 and managerial personnel are
 being sent to the bloc for
 training. .
 Bloc trade with Cuba is
 moving in well.-established chan-
 nels worked out to overcome the
 difficulties imposed by long
 transportation lines and Cuba's
 lopsided dependence on sugar
 exports.   Total trade is ex-
 pected to amount to over $750,-

 result of new agreements for
 the bloc to take nearly 5,000,-
 000 tons of sugar in 1962, should
 climb to some $850,000,000 next
 year.   At least 75 percent of
 total Cuban trade this year will
 be with the bloc.
 Major bloc exports to Cuba
 include petroleum, grain, ferti-
 lizers, chemicals, and metals.
 In order to cope with the most
 serious shortages--resulting from
 the curtailment of Cuban trade
 with the United States--bloc ex-
 ports to Cuba include a wide va-
 riety of foodstuffs and consumer
 goods which often are in short
 supply within the bloc.   Very
 large numbers of bloc motor ve-
 hicles have been supplied to
 Cuba--one order alone for 7,000
 Soviet trucks amounted to nearly
 2 percent of the USSR's total
 annual truck production.   The
 USSR recently completed deliver-
 ies of 12 IL-14 transport air-
 craft to Cuba.  Bloc imports
 from Cuba consist overwhelmingly
 of sugar but also include increas-
 ing amounts of minerals, tobacco,
 metals, and fruits.
 Meanwhile, bloc military
 assistance to Cuba is continuing,
 primarily in the form of train-
 ing and helping Cubans assimilate
 equipment provided during the past
 year.   No major arms shipments
 are believed to have taken place
 since last summer, suggesting
 that Moscow and Havana consider
 the level of military aid is all
 that Cuba can absorb at present.
 India's show of force in
 the vicinity of the Portuguese
 exclave of Goa, including a
 buildup in adjacent Indian ter-
 ritory of more than division
 strength, is part of the recent
 step-up in India's long campaign
 to press Portugal to give up its
 exclaves in western India.   The
 immediate spark has been a num-
 ber of minor shooting incidents,
 which have been exaggerated in
 Indian press and political cir-
 cles in the context of the cam-
 paign for the Indian national
 election to be held in February.
 In part a reaction to op-
 position pressure to "do some-
 thing" about Goa,  India's recent
 actions also represent a delib-
 erate attempt by the ruling
 Congress party to refurbish its
 anti-colonialist image and at
 the same time deflect attention
 from the government's "failure"
 to deal effectively with Paki-
 stani and Chinese "aggressions"
 elsewhere.
 Anti-Portuguese feeling in
 India runs deep, and the Goa issue
 will require deft handling by
 the Indians if it is to be kept
 within manageable bounds.  The
 military buildup will give New
 Delhi more than enough power on
 the scene to deal with the rela-
 tively small Portuguese garrison.
 New Delhi will also be in a posi-
 tion to seal off Goa from the
 activities of extremist Goan
 nationalists within India.
 Continuing small-scale in-
 cidents are likely as tension
 mounts.   However, New Delhi has
 publicly disclaimed any inten-
 tion to invade Goa.   In the ab-
 sence of a clear case of gross
 provocation or large-scale dis-
 orders within Goa, Nehru is un-
 likely to reverse this policy
 by ordering a military thrust.
 The Indian leader probably cal-
 culates that continuing psycho-
 logical warfare against the en-
 claves,  facilitated by a steady
 erosion of Lisbon's colonial

 Lisbon apparently believes
 that New Delhi is seeking a pre-

 against Goa at a time when the
 bulk of Portugal's military
 force is committed to Angola.
 Foreign Minister Nogueira,  at
 a press conference on 6 December,
 stated that Indian accusations
 of torture and oppression in
 the enclaves were "deliberate,
 baseless, and irresponsible
 lies" aimed at establishing such
 a pretext.  He added that Portu-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 EUROPEAN INTEGRATION DEVELOPMENTS
 The future political and
 economic course of the European
 Common Market (EEC) hangs on de-
 cisions to be taken in the next
 few weeks.  The French continue
 to urge that the EEC be supple-
 mented with a loose confederation
 of its member states, and the
 entire question of European po-
 litical unity is likely to come
 to a head before the end of the
 year.  On the economic side, the
 EEC countries must decide before
 1 January whether to proceed to
 the tariff cuts and other meas-
 ures provided for in the second
 of the EEC's three four-year tran
 sitional stages.  An affirmative
 decision is needed to maintain
 the present momentum, but there
 are major obstacles, particularly
 in the continuing deadlock over
 agricultural policy.
 In the past week, a vigorous
 effort has been made to resolve
 the dispute over the draft treaty
 for an "indissoluble union of
 states" proposed by the French on
 19 October.  Paris itself has re-
 vised its draft in several sig-
 nificant respects, and Bonn has
 offered amendments designed to
 strengthen the union and encour-
 age its evolution along more
 supranational lines.  Both Paris
 and Bonn consider it imperative
 that steps be taken to link West
 Germany more closely to the West
 --a feeling which is shared in
 Rome and Luxembourg.  The Hague,
 however,  is loath to extend its
 ties with France until it is sure
 of Britain's participation, and
 Brussels is concerned lest a step
 toward confederation prove to be
 a step away from real integration.
 Whether these basic Dutch
 and Belgian objections can be
 met at the foreign ministers'
 meeting,  now under consideration
 for mid-December,  is uncertain.
 Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak
 told Ambassador MacArthur on 28
 November that he considered the
 initial French draft "actually
 retrogressive."  Coupled with
 the admission of new members or
 associates which did not share
 the EEC's political goals,  he
 said, adoption of the French pro-
 posal could be the "death knell
 of political unification."   Spaak
 has previously expressed skepti-
 cism that London is fully con-
 verted to the European concept,
 but he referred especially to
 the European neutrals--Austria,
 Switzerland, and Sweden--which
 are expected to apply for con-
 ditional EEC association by mid-
 December.
 Complex and conflicting
 national interests are also in-
 volved in the problem of moving
 to the second stage of the EEC
 --a move which requires unanimous
 agreement that the major tasks.of
 the first stage have been accom-
 plished.   In most respects the
 EEC's implementation is ahead of
 schedule, but decisions are still
 awaited regarding social, anti-
 cartel, and farm policy.  The
 farm policy issue is particularly
 critical.   France, with its inter-
 est in finding markets for its
 agricultural surpluses, has made
 its consent to the opening of the
 second stage conditional on prog-
 ress toward an over-all agricul-
 tural policy, and in particular
 on the opening of the West German
 market for foodstuffs.  Although
 generally supported by the other
 member countries and by the EEC's
 commission, the French demands
 are opposed in Bonn, where the
 farm bloc is a potent force, and
 only little progress toward a com-
 promise was apparent at last week's
 meeting of agricultural ministers.
 All these issues have impor-
 tant implications for Britain's
 bid for membership.   Should tran-
 sition to the second stage be
 stalled,  London might feel that
 accession had become a matter of
 less urgency,  or it might be en-
 couraged to hope that it still
 has a chance of reversing the
 EEC's commitment to complete eco-
 nomic union once Britain becomes
 a member.   Farm policy, moreover,
 is itself a major issue in the
 accession talks, and the EEC coun-
 tries will be unable to present
 a common front toward London until
 they can agree among themselves on
 this problem.   Finally,  it has
 long been evident that a good deal
 of the opposition to De Gaulle's
 "union of states" stems from con-
 tinued uncertainty as to the
 role Britain would play in such 25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ELECTIONS IN EL SALVADOR
 El Salvador's constituent
 assembly elections on 17 Decem-
 ber will conclude a bitterly
 fought campaign in which the
 Alliance for Progress has be-
 come a basic domestic issue.
 The provisional government,
 which replaced a Communist-in-
 fluenced regime last January,
 has found encouragement in the
 Alliance for Progress for its
 program of socio-economic re-
 forms.   These long-overdue re-
 forms, however, have encountered
 strong resistance from the en-
 trenched oligarchy of wealthy
 families as well as from Commu-
 nists and pro-Communists, who
 claim that the Alliance for
 Progress is a "new mask for im-
 perialism."
 The elections are the first
 step in the scheduled restora-
 tion of constitutional govern-
 ment, which ended with the ouster
 of an elected government in
 October 1960.   The constituent
 assembly is to name an interim
 president of the republic and
 then become a regular legisla-
 ture.   This legislature and the
 interim president are to serve
 until next September.   Regular
 legislative and presidential
 elections are scheduled for
 next spring.
 The National Conciliation
 party (PCN), formed last Septem-
 ber by government leaders, is
 being opposed in the elections
 by the Union of Democratic
 parties (UPD), a loose coalition
 backed by members of the oli-
 garchy and including in one of
 its constituent parties a num-
 ber of Communists or pro-Com-
 munists.   Both are well financed
 and both have been campaigning
 actively. The PCN has the full
 backing of the government,
 traditionally a decisive factor
 in Salvadoran elections, but
 the government does not control
 the electoral machinery, set
 up earlier this year by a non-
 partisan group anxious to assure
 free elections.  The PCN is de-
 pending for support on the
 beneficiaries of its reform
 program, but the bulk of these,
 the largely illiterate rural
 laborers, are unorganized and
 have in the past been dominated
 by their employers.
 The opposition is charging
 that the active political role
 of army officers and the official
 backing enjoyed by the PCN are
 antidemocratic.   There are some
 indications that the UPD may
 withdraw its candidates shortly
 before election day on the ground
 that the elections will not be
 free, thus preparing for a
 claim that the resulting regime
 is illegitimate and should be
 ousted by force.   In its efforts
 to subvert the government the
 opposition has had some success
 in exploiting the divisions
 and personality conflicts within
 the armed forces and possibly
 even between the two military
 members of the provisional
 government.
 The ouster of the pro-
 gressive,   strongly anti-Com-
 munist leaders of the present
 regime would be a setback for
 the concepts of the Alliance
 for Progress in all Central
 America. In El Salvador, where
 the gulf between the wealthy
 few and the impoverished ma-
 jority is as wide as anywhere
 in Latin America and where the
 Communists have already demon-
 strated their ability strongly
 to influence a weak regime,
 events have often had important
 repercussions in neighboring
 countries.

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S POLICY ON THE USA
 There are manifestations
 of antagonism toward the US in
 nearly all of Communist China's
 foreign policy positions--whether
 in respect to Berlin or Japan,
 Laos or Cuba, South Vietnam or
 the Congo.   Even Peiping's quar-
 rel with the USSR grew in con-
 siderable measure out of differ-
 ences as to how the bloc and
 the world Communist movement
 should best deal with the United
 States.
 Soft Approach
 A directive from the Foreign
 Ministry in Peiping to Chinese
 Communist diplomats early in 1961
 stated that the regime's control-
 ling strategy in international
 affairs was "to unite all forces
 that can be united and to point
 the tip of our sword at American
 imperialism."  While the belli-
 cose emphasis is unmistakable,
 the policy permits a range of
 tactics that at times even in-
 cludes gestures of affability.
 Such gestures were occasioned
 by the advent of the new admin-
 istration in Washington last
 January.  To get a reading on
 the new President's outlook, the
 Chinese made several direct and
 indirect approaches to US offi-
 cials.
 In one such approach,
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi last
 March engaged the Swedish am-
 bassador in a conversation on
 Sino-American relations.   Chen's
 remarks--which he almost cer-
 tainly intended to be passed to
 Washington--were conciliatory.
 He stressed that some American
 concession was the prerequisite
 for any easing of tensions be-
 tween the two countries,  and
 asserted that the US had not yet
 reciprocated concessions already
 made by Peiping.  A few weeks
 later, when he was in Djakarta
 just prior to Sukarno's American
 trip, Chen expressed much the
 same sentiments to Indonesian
 25X1
 25X1
 Somewhat the same accommo-
 dative tone was sounded by cer-
 tain of Peiping's representa-
 tives in Europe last summer when
 they sought out their American
 counterparts for informal chats.
 In these conversations the Chi-
 nese went no further than to
 offer assurances that Peiping
 desired improved relations.   Like
 Chen, they implied that it was
 up to the US to take the initia-
 tive by some concession to the
 Chinese.
 No further such approaches
 have been made recently, sug-
 gesting that Peiping has shelved
 the tactic for the time being.
 Propaganda and Negotiations
 Peiping's conciliatory ap-
 proaches having elicited no
 encouragement that US conces-
 sions would be forthcoming, the
 central theme of Chinese foreign
 policy statements has continued
 to be a characterization of the
 US as the "main enemy" that must
 be met on all fronts and at all
 times in an unremitting "head-
 on struggle."  The change of
 administration is portrayed not
 as an opportunity for improved
 East-West relations but rather
 as an increased danger to world
 peace.   President Kennedy, ac-
 cording to Peiping broadcasts,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 hides behind a mask of peace
 while in practice going beyond
 the "brinksmanship" of the pre-
 vious administration to adopt
 a deliberate strategy of insti-
 gating limited wars.   Cuba and
 "frenzied war preparations" in
 Berlin are cited as cases in
 point.
 In Peiping's dialectic, the
 propaganda invective is entirely
 consistent with conciliatory
 overtures to negotiate.   Nego-
 tiations, which serve to enhance
 Communist China's international
 prestige in any case,  are
 viewed as a  "form of struggle"
 particularly productive for the
 Communists if the US is first
 "driven into a corner."  Lack-
 ing the strong bargaining po-
 sition that accrues from victo-
 ries outside the conference room,
 Peiping believes that negotia-
 tions are useful primarily to
 "expose American duplicity" or
 build up a case for Communist
 devotion to peace.
 The Chinese thus profess
 pride in "taking the initiative"
 to organize the Sino-American
 ambassadorial talks begun in
 1955.  On various occasions since
 then, they have made efforts to
 get the talks raised to the
 foreign ministers' level.   While
 Peiping publicly deplores the
 lack of progress at the meetings,
 it has no intention of breaking
 them off.  One Chinese leader
 was quoted as saying that Pei-
 ping does not mind if the talks
 go on for "five or even ten
 years."
 East-West Talks
 Peiping's policy toward
 the US is closely related to
 the problem of Chinese ex-
 clusion from certain East-West
 negotiations.   The Foreign Minis-
 try directive to diplomats early
 this year warned of the need to
 be "particularly on guard when
 the Soviet Union has a detente"
 with the US.  Peiping's attitude
 is based in part on the suspicion
 that Soviet negotiators may be
 unattentive to Chinese interests
 if Chinese negotiators are not
 at the conference table.   This
 suspicion was reflected in
 Chinese Communist coolness to
 Khrushchev's summitry:   Peiping
 failed to send newsmen to cover
 the Kennddy-Khrushchev meeting
 in Vienna last spring and did
 not echo Moscow's characteriza-
 tion of the meeting as "useful."
 Chinese spokesmen are on record
 with statements that China must
 have the right to participate
 in any negotiations which affect
 its interests.
 On the subject of disarma-
 ment specifically, Peiping has
 publicly declared that it will
 not consider itself bound by
 any agreement reached without
 its participation.  Apart from
 the stress on the need for Chinese
 participation, the declaration
 probably also refldcted a desire
 to delay progress toward a dis-
 armament agreement.   Disarmament
 proposals, observed the Chinese
 during the Sino-Soviet polemic
 in 1960, could be advanced to
 "mobilize" world opinion and
 to "isolate in a most effective
 manner the imperialist bloc,
 headed by the US,"  It was, how-
 ever, an "illusion" to suppose
 that such proposals could be
 realized.
 Much of the same attitude--
 desire for participation in ne-
 gotiations and reluctance to
 work for any real agreement--
 seems to be indicated in Chinese
 statements on a nuclear test ban_
 The Chinese, who do not
 now.?have such weapons, may well
 be hopeful that their own eventual
 acquisition of a nuclear capa-
 bility will ensure their partici-
 pation in future test ban talks.

 national controls--which couples

 an unsupervised test ban with
 the destruction of all ex-
 isting stockpiles of nuclear
 weapons--seems designed to
 frustrate a workable inter-
 national agreement.
 The Issue of Taiwan
 In any bilateral or multi-
 lateral confrontation' between
 Peiping and the US, Taiwan is
 a major issue.   When Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi catalogued
 for a recent interviewer
 those American actions which
 especially irritate Peiping,
 he placed US support for Chiang
 Kai-shek at the head of the
 list.  The foreign policy
 directive for 1961 stated that
 the Taiwan issue had to be
 settled before discussions
 in the Sino-American ambassado--
 irial talks could begin on .other
 matters.   According to the
 directive, this reversed an
 earlier stand of "tackling the
 details before'touching the
 principle."
 Premier Chou En-lai,
 talking with American writer
 Edgar Snow, made clear the
 'Principle   involved.   "The
 US must agree to withdraw its
 armed forces from Taiwan and
 the Taiwan Strait."  Chou,indi-
 cated that once the "principle"
 of withdrawal had been agreed
 upon, the specific steps as to
 "when and how" could be settled
 later.  A US withdrawal, the
 Chinese foreign minister has
 since argued,  "ought not td be
 a difficult thing."  The US
 forces, he suggested, could be
 withdrawn to Okinawa and the
 Philippines without impairing
 US security in the Far East.
 Statements such as this,
 which strike a note consider-
 ably less militant than "libera-
 tion" propaganda, reflect Peir
 ping's realization of its in-
 ability to force a military
 showdown.  The Chinese Com-
 munists still talk about "libera-
 tion" occasionally, but there
 has been little sense of ur-
 gency recently and no threat
 of an early recourse to armed
 force.   Mao Tse-tung is the
 reported authority for the state-
 ment that Peiping does not intend
 "to shoot its way into a strong
 point like Taiwan"--a view entirely
 in keeping with his precept that
 the enemy should be engaged  only
 when one has a marked preponder-
 ance of force.
 Lacking this, the Chinese
 leaders evidently recognize that
 the Taiwan problem will be an
 irritant for some time; Chen Yi
 has suggested that a solution
 satisfactory to Peiping might
 take two or three decades.
 Other Issues
 Communist China has hopes
 of inflicting an early defeat
 on the US over the issue of
 China's UN representation.. This
 is a major reason why the Peiping
 regime, despite occasional in-
 timations of disinterest, wants
 a seat.   No "two Chinas" solu-
 tion--i.e., a formula by which
 both Taipei and Peiping are rep-
 resented--is acceptable to the
 Chinese Communist leaders, who
 emphasize that they will not
 participate "in any meeting or
 organization in which the Chiang
 Kai-shek clique is included."
 This intransigence is prob-
 ably encouraged by the way they
 assess their UN.prospects.  The
 situation, they feel,  is growing
 "more and more unfavorable" to
 US efforts to exclude Communist
 China,   Reflecting this generally
 optimistic view, Peiping, before
 the compromise vote on Outer
 Mopgolia dimmed its prospects
 for this year, devoted an un-
 precedentedly high volume of com-
 ment to the matter.   In this
 comment, the US, with support
 for its moratorium formula fading,
 was portrayed as resorting to
 new "tricks" to keep Peiping out.
 "True friends" of Communist China,
 it was intimated, would see through
 these "tricks" and support Peiping.
 Chou En-lai and other leaders
 even suggested that the vote on
 this issue would provide a "test"
 of a nation's friendship for Com-
 munist China.
 To offset charges that its
 aggressive nature was foreclosing

 it from UN membership, Peiping
 has not shelled the offshore
 islands since 12 September--
 the longest lull in shelling
 since the Taiwan Strait crisis
 of 1958.
 The leaders in Peiping have
 also professed concern over
 their "encirclement" by US
 bases and US-dominated blocs.
 Chen Yi complained
 that US bases in Japan, South
 Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, the
 Philippines, and South Vietnam
 are in fact directed against
 Communist China.   "As a result,"
 he said, "we cannot sleep easily
 at night."  Regional groupings
 such as SEATO are a prime target
 of Peiping's invective.
 Also in the compound of
 China's displeasure is the US
 support for governments in the
 Far East which are hostile or
 unresponsive to Peiping.  Among
 these, Japan is regarded as a
 potential rival for influence .
 and power.   This apprehension
 of a resurgent Japan is  compara-
 ble to Soviet anxiety about
 a remilitarized Germany.  A
 good deal of concern is also
 shown over the possibility
 that Japan will cooperate with
 the US in setting up a new
 treaty organization embracing
 northeast Asia.
 Peiping also sees India
 as a serious rival.  Originally
 hopeful that Indian neutrality
 could be manipulated to Pei-
 ping's advantage, the Chinese
 Communists now charge that
 India is slipping into the US
 orbit.  They are trying to dis-
 credit Nehru, and said his per-
 formance at the Belgrade Con-
 ference in September demon-
 strated that he had become a
 "tool of US imperialism."
 Peiping's Expectations
 Traditional Chinese sensi-
 tivity about "face" is as im-
 portant a factor as ever in
 Peiping's foreign relations.
 Premier Chou has said that in
 dealing with the great powers Pei-
 ping will insist on "equality in
 every sense of the word."  The US,
 Peiping charges, steadfastly re-
 fuses to take this Chinese feeling
 into full account, although the
 days are "gone foreverb..when US
 imperialism can ride roughshod
 over China."
 Recently Chen Yi, asked about
 possible Sino-American foreign min-
 isters' talks, replied that the in-
 itiative would have to come from
 the US, since otherwise it would
 look as though Peiping were a sup-
 plicant.  Asserting that "for the
 past hundred years we have been
 submitting too often," Chen prom-
 ised that China will no longer
 "submit to anyone."  Nor, accord-
 ing to Chou,,; will Peiping make
 any concessions over Taiwan, since
 the Chinese people would look
 upon any agreement short of the
 withdrawal of US forces as a "de-
 feat."  The Chinese leaders do not
 intend to suffer any such defeat,
 he implied.
 The Chinese Communists seem
 fairly optimistic about their
 chances of settling certain Sino-
 American problems in their favor
 over the long run.  This outlook
 is grounded in a doctrinaire con-
 viction that the US is confronted
 by a grave and growing crisis at
 home as well as severe economic
 "contradictions" with its capital-
 ist allies.  They also believe
 the world situation requires the
 US to spread its effort too thinly
 in opposing "national liberation
 movements" whenever and wherever
 they arise. They doubt that the
 US will seek a way out by a major
 war with the bloc.  Under these
 circumstances of steadily eroding
 US strength, they foresee an in-
 evitable closing of the gap in
 power between Peiping and Washing-
 ton.
 As a result of this calculus,
 Peiping is unlikely to grant sub-
 stantial concessions to the US,
 but will rather persist in Mao's
 strategy, which aims at uniting
 "90 percent of the world's popu-
 lation against American imperial-
 ism and its running dogs."

 The Secret Army Organiza-
 tion (OAS), led by French mili-
 tary officers outlawed for
 their role in last April's un-
 successful coup and supported
 by almost all:;the European
 population of Algeria, consti-
 tutes a serious threat to any
 settlement negotiated between
 De Gaulle and the provisional
 Algerian government (FAG). The
 OAS is in virtual control of
 several areas in Algeria, and
 extensive propaganda and ter-
 rorist operations are conducted
 in its name in both France and
 Algeria.   Its professed goal is
 to establish a separate settler-
 dominated state, comprising all
 or part of Algeria, which would
 repress the Moslem nationalist
 rebellion and restore close
 ties with France once De Gaulle
 was gone.  Essehtially, however,
 the aim of the OAS is probably
 to force France to  retain re-
 sponsibility for Algeria.
 Origix'and Objectives
 The OAS seems tohave
 developed out of the despair
 which spread among the Euro-
 peans in Algeria following the
 Moslem riots of December 1960.
 After the abortive April 1961
 putsch, it soon overshadowed
 and absorbed previous "French
 Algeria"" groups when the out-
 lawed generals and colonels
 took over its leadership, tight-
 ened up its organization, and
 openly disputed De Gaulle's
 authority to reach an Algerian
 settlement.   It is headed by
 ex-General"Raoul Salan, former
 French commander in chief in
 Algeria.
 Fear of Moslem rule has
 united within the OAS a great
 diversity of individuals with
 differing views on. how to cope
 with the prospect of PAG dom-
 ination.  The settlers who
 form the bulk of the membership
 would like to bring about a
 reversal of De Gaulle's policies,
 return to the status quo ante,
 and perpetuate a French Algeria
 in which "good Moslems" who kept
 in their place might share.
 The military officers who
 are leaders of the OAS originally
 were probably not basically
 sympathetic to these views and
 had hoped to improve social
 conditions sufficiently to win
 over most of the Moslem popu-
 lation to loyalty to France.
 As their ideas of what might
 be politically and militarily
 possible became more clearly
 defined, however, the OAS lead-
 ers seem to have narrowed their
 objectives to a strict defense
 of the right of the Europeans
 to retain their identity in
 Algeria, and perhaps to bring
 about De Gaulle's overthrow.
 A "go it alone" attitude has
 evolved,., with talk either of
 mobilizing a local army to
 suppress the Moslem rebels or
 of partitioning Algeria and
 setting up European enclaves.
 There are some indications
 that OAS leaders now are intent
 on establishing a right to rec-
 ognition as a participput in
 any negotiations on Algeria's
 future, on the grounds that
 the OAS is as representative
 of the Europeans as the PAG
 is of the Moslems.   In October,
 when Paris was reportedly plan-
 ning to set up a provisional
 Algerian executive, a parallel
 plan was envisaged by the OAS,
 possibly limited to the Algiers
 and Oran regions.   Immediately
 after its proclamation, to be
 backed by force, the OAS Execu-
 tive would appeal to various

 Western countries for recog-
 nition and finaz +pia  axed.m_ il.i-
 tary support.
 More recently Salan is
 reported to have said he in-
 tends to declare an independent
 Algerian republic which would
 negotiate with the PAG; he
 said PAG-OAS contacts had
 already been established.
 Until recently it has
 been the generally accepted
 view that the OAS bases its
 plans for action on removal of
 De Gaulle and does not con-
 sider that it would be able to
 seize.power unless De Gaulle
 were removed.   The assassina-
 tion attempt against De Gaulle
 last September was probably
 inspired by the OAS, although
 Satan himself has denied any
 connection with it.  The possi-
 bility of influencing Paris by
 demonstrating OAS strength in
 Algeria now seems to be gaining
 ground.
 Organization and Strength
 A leading French journal-
 ist has ascribed the OAS' ef-
 fectiveness to the fact that
 for the first timethe. European
 extremists in Algeria have
 placed themselves under mili-
 tary leaders from outside their
 own circles. The new chiefs
 have enforced discipline and,
 instead of absorbing the old
 settler organizations in toto,
 have recruited individuals on
 their merits as leaders and
 organizers and not just for
 their known advocacy of a
 French Algeria.
 The OAS is organized on
 military lines, with a terri-
 torial breakdown into zones
 and sectors and a hierarchical
 command structure.   Its organi-
 zation closely parallels that
 of the rebel FLN and is in
 many ways a settler counterpart
 of the Moslem rebellion. In the
 classic manner of subversive
 warfare, the OAS operates
 specialized bureaus for intel-
 ligence and operations, psycho-
 logical action, political ac-
 tivity, and organization of
 the masses.  Outside the main
 cities, the organizational
 picture depends on the strength
 of local support and is not
 always so neat.
 The most aggressive ele-
 ment of the OAS is its urban
 shock groups or commandos; their
 audacity gives the organization
 much of its reputation for ef-
 fectiveness.  Before Paris
 stepped up its operations
 against the OAS in September,
 there were in Algiers alone
 about 30 such groups, compris-
 ing roughly half a dozen men
 apiece.   The "maquis"   proper--
 consisting of some of the prin-
 cipal leaders and guerrillas
 hiding out in the countryside
 probably numbers less than
 1,500.  The OAS also could
 probably mobilize on short
 notice l;q;:`400-1p 000?.activiet$,
 who are well supplied with
 arms.
 While there is frequent
 talk of mobilizing the Terri-
 torials, the settler home-
 guard units dissolved by Paris
 after the January 1960 up-
 rising, this step apparently
 has not yet been undertaken.
 Total mobilization of military-
 age European settlers could
 produce an army of 100,000,
 according to some OAS estimates.
 :Funds--apparently adequate
 to meet present needs--are

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY S:
 raised by voluntary or involun-
 tary                     contributions, and
 supplies have come in large
 measure from French Army stocks
 in Algeria.
 At the moment, the OAS
 leaders are relying for their
 active manpower primarily on
 members of the Urban Protection
 Units organized in 1956 by
 Colonel Godard and on the young
 toughs of Lagaillarde's 1960
 Alcazar Commando.  These groups
 have blanketed Algiers and
 other areas with a secret net-
 work which picks out victims
 for reprisal, assesses contri-
 butions, distributes propaganda,
 and circulates orders.  The
 freedom with which the OAS
 operates is in some measure due
 to widespread complicity among
 local officials in the French
 administration, a high percen-
 tage of whom are native-born
 Algerians.
 Although all of these
 elements do not add up to a
 real army, the OAS does have
 at its command a significant
 body of men capable of respond-
 ing to an alert within a few
 hours.
 In Algiers and Oran, the
 OAS has become an element of
 everyday life, with plastic
 bombings,  "pirate" broadcasts,
 and threats against individuals,
 and it makes its presence felt
 in other parts of Algeria and
 metropolitan France as well.
 It has been particularly suc-
 cessful in demoralizing security
 forces by murdering top police
 officials.   When the OAS has
 called for mass public-demon-
 strations, however, response has
 been far short of anticipation.
 Outside Support
 OAS leaders appear to
 have somewhat inflated views
 of outside support for their
 movement.  Their claims of
 massive Moslem sympathy appear
 to be the most questionable.
 Salan's reported belief that
 he can mobilize 150,000 "harkis"
 --Moslem auxiliaries attached
 to the French Army--would appear
 unrealistic, in view of the
 general deterioration of race
 relations in Algeria. Further-
 more, recurring "Arab hunts"
 in Oran and other indiscriminate
 European attacks on Moslem
 civilians are progressively
 alienating army sympathy.  PAG
 minister of information Yazid
 threatened Moslem reprisals if
 the attacks continue and has
 charged that the Europeans'
 activities threaten negotiation
 prospects.
 Any consideration of Algeria's
 future will be influenced by the
 attitude of the army.  Many of-
 ficbrs remain hostile to De
 Gaulle's policies and are
 emotionally committed tee the
 army's remaining in Algeria.
 Since the shake-up carried out
 after the April revolt, however,
 "loyal" officers no longer have
 the feeling of being outnumbered
 by plotters.   At present,  the
 amount of army support on which
 the OAS can count appears re-
 stricted both by the army's pre-
 occupation with its own concerns
 and by lingering reluctance to
 become involved with civilians.
 The army's willingness to take
 active measures to repress the
 OAS also remains in question.
 The Foreign Legion is a
 special case;  it has always
 been based in Algeria, and its
 men see little future for

 themselves elsewhere.   Legion
 deserters have carried out the
 bulk of the OAS"political as-
 sassinations.
 OAS relations with political
 groups in France are obscure.
 Rightists of all stripes claim
 association in order to bolster
 their own fortunes, and their
 self-confidence is mounting as
 OAS effectiveness grows. French
 extremists have launched a
 political offensive both in-
 side and outside parliament in
 the apparent belief that the
 OAS has a chance of defeating
 De Gaulle on the Algerian issue.
 Spokesmen for the Salan
 group deny that the OAS has any
 specific ambitions for metro-
 politan France but they assert
 that  to create and maintain an
 Algerian state, close associa-
 tion with France is necessary,
 and this would not be possible
 under De Gaulle."   They appear
 hopeful that setting up a
 separate European-dominated
 Algeria would be sufficient to
 effect the ouster of the pres-
 ent French Government in favor
 of a moderate "national unity"
 coalition ranging from Mollet
 and the Socialists to Pinay
 and the Independents.
 The OAS maintains that it
 has contacts and promises of
 support in a number of Western
 European countries, such as
 Spain, Belgium, and West
 Germany.   It is making a strong
 bid for foreign support by
 charging that "international
 Communism" is about to take
 over Algeria in the guise of
 the FAG.
 Outlook
 While there is a large dose
 of psychological warfare in the
 claims of the OAS, it has created
 in less than a year an organiza-
 tion which has definitely gone
 beyond the nuisance-value stage
 and appears to be gaining momen*
 tum.  Paris now is operating al-
 most as intensively against the
 OAS as against the Moslem rebels.
 Salan's effectiveness has
 been enhanced by recent events
 which reduced the role of rival
 factions.   One important fascist-
 leaning group--now repudiated
 by the OAS leadership--had
 reached the conclusion that any
 successful action must start
 with a coup in metropolitan
 France.   The Spanish Govern-
 ment has virtually neutralized
 this group by interning its
 exiled leaders--Lagaillardo,;
 Ortiz, and Colonels Argoud and
 Lacheroy--and the French
 police broke up its network in
 southwestern France.   Moreover,
 the Godard group in Algeria,
 which favored an immediate r
 putsch, has given way to Salan,
 who wants to wait for a polit-
 ically propitdous moment to
 strike.   While Jean-Jacques
 Susini, the former head of the
 Algerian student organization,
 is working with Salan, he still
 appears to be running a semi-
 independent terrorist action
 and seems to have greater over-
 all ambitions than Salan.
 Although the OAS has not
 been willing to risk an all-out
 attempt to seize power, it is
 probably already capable of forc-
 ing France and the PAG to reckon
 with it in deciding the future
 status of Algeria. The'-OAS could
 foster continued violence aimed
 at upsetting any French-PAG agree-
 ment.,. or could bring about a de
 facto partition'or perhaps even
 its own participation in a nego-
 tiated settlement as the repre-
 sentative of the European pobu-
