 SOVIET - IS^AELI  R ELATIONS
 MOSCOW MEDIA SILENT ON USSR-1SRAELI FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING
 Moscow's silence on the 24 September private meeting in New York
 between Soviet Foreign Minister Cromyko and Israeli Foreign
 Minister Allon is consistent with Soviet media treatment of other
 reported high-level Soviet-Israeli contacts since 10 June 1967,
 when the USSR broke diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv.*
 Presumably Moscow chooses not to acknowledge such contacts to
 avoid conveying the impression, particularly to Arab observers,
 that it might be considering improving or even restoring Soviet-
 Israeli relations.  Moscow has on occasion, however, acknowledged
 low-level, unofficial Soviet contacts, most recently in a brief
 1 October TASS report on the conclusion of an Israeli delegation's
 visit to the USSR. Gromyko, in his UN Ceneral Assembly address
 this year, did not ment?on the issue of Soviet-Israeli relations,
 although in his UNGA speech last year he had reiterated Brezhnev's
 J,ine 1974 formulation to the effect that real progress in a
 Mideast settlement would create conditions for the development
 of relations with all Middle East states.
 UNOFFICIAL     In contrast to its reticence on high-level contacts,
 CONTACTS       Moscow has sometimes publicized various unofficial
 contacts and exchanges of visits by low-level
 delegations.  However, there has been only one monitored reference
 in Soviet media to the most recent visit of an Israeli delegation
 to the USSR, when TASS on 1 October reported the 22 September-
 1 October visit of a five-member Israeli delegation composed of
 politicians and journalists.  Since the period of this visit
 encompassed the Gromyko-Allon meeting, Moscow may have sought to
 avoid speculation that the meetings were related; a Moscow-datelined
 dispatch in the British Communist Party organ, MORNING STAR, on
 27 September cited an Israeli source as cautioning that the two
 events should not be linked.    In contrast, Israeli media--as with
 pap'. Soviet-Israeli contacts--have speculated at length on possible
 connections and implications of the recent meetings, generally
 along lines favoring improved relations with the USSR.
 *  Past contacts ignored by Moscow-but reported by U.S., Israeli,
 West European, Chinese, and some Arab media--include several meetings
 since summer 1970 between Soviet and Israeli ambassadors in Washington
 and a meeting between Gromyko and Foreign Minister Eban at the
 time of the Geneva Mideast-,;eace conference in December 1973.

 In acknowledging previous low-level. meetings and delegations, Moscow
 has attempted to justify them by suggesting that they illustrate
 the popular appeal. of the Soviet "peace policy" and way of life;
 occasionally the contacts have been placed in the context of a
 Soviet-Israeli "friendship movement."  Such contacts have included--in
 addition to mutual visits by delegations concerned with sports,
 medicine, religion, and journalism--visits to the USSR by groups of
 Israeli "progressive public figures" invited btu an organization
 such as the Soviet Peace Committee to "study Soviet life" and meet
 with their parliamentary, journalistic, and/or academic Soviet
 counterparts.
 CRITICISM OF     As wit-i past Soviet-Israeli contacts, Moscow's
 CONTACTS         recent meetings have subjected it to criticism
 from Arab and Chinese sources.  A Cairo radio
 commentary on the 26th, for example, denounced the "duplicity" of
 "rejectionist elements within the Arab homeland and outside it"
 who declare one policy and pursue another, citing the secret
 development of Soviet-Israeli relations as an example and referring
 to the Gromyko-Allon meeting and the recent Israeli delegation
 visit.  Peking, too, wasted little time in charging, in a
 26 September NCNA dispatch, that the Gromyko-Allon meeting was
 "glaring proof" of Soviet-Israeli "collusion" against the Arabs,
 pointing out the simultaneous Israeli delegation's USSR visit
 and recoiling that the USSR had sent two envoys to Israel lase April.*
 Although presently ignoring such criticism, Moscow has occasionally
 responded defensively to past speculation in world media that
 Soviet-Israeli contacts could be a harbinger of improved--or
 even restored--relations and would, in any case, imply weakened
 Soviet support for the Arabs.  Referring to attendance by a Soviet
 delegation at a 20-22 January 1972 conference of the "Israeli-Soviet
 Friendship Association" in 1s1:ae1, for example, a 17 March 1.972
 NEW TIMES article defended r::e        against charges that it was
 part of a "mythical 'Soviet Flan for rapp.ochement with Israel."'
 Earlier, criticism of a 1971 irr:.eli delegation's visit to Moscow
 was handled through TASS publicity for a Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF
 article stressing that, contrary to "hostile propaganda" by some
 concerning the visit, the USSR had "not taken a single step backward"
 in support of the Arab cause.
 *  Moscow and Peking have previously exchanged accusations about each
 other's reported contacts with Israel.  PEOPLE'S DAILY lambasted Moscow
 in a January 1972 article for having sent a "good-will" delegation to
 Israel; Moscow in turn accused Peking of "backstage intrigues" with
 Tel Aviv.  For details, see the TRENDS of 2 February 1972, pages 35-36,
 and 11 August 1971, pages 24-25.

 USSR-ISRAEL     The most recent authoritative statement of Moscow's
 RELATIONS       position or restoration of diplomatic relations with
 Israel was made by Brezhnev in a 14 June .1974 speech
 in which he said that the Soviet position on n final Midca:;t settlement
 was well. known and that "progress in the field of settlement will
 create the conditions for the development of our relationships with
 all countries of the Near East."  Subsequent Soviet comment on the
 issue generally fol.lowe. Brezhncv'a formulation, as In Cromyl.o's
 24 September 1974 UNGA address when he protested accusations that
 Moscow's Midei&t position was "one-sided" in favor of the Acal's and
 added:  "Progress which is not ill.ustory but real In the matter of
 a Near East settlement will create the preconditions for the Soviet
 Union to develop relations with all Near East states, including
 Israel."
 Prior to Brezhnev's Jun'` 1974 speech, the Soviet position since
 Jure 1.967 had been exemplified in such remarks as those by Kosygin
 at a 5 April 1973 press conference in Stockholm, reported in the
 13 April Soviet NEW TIMES.  Asked whether the USSR should not have
 diplomatic relations with Israel, as well as with the Arab states,
 if Moscow wished to contribute to a Mideast settlement, Kosygin
 replied that It would be possible "if Israel and the Arab countries
 were in the same position."  But he emphasized that, on the contrary,
 Israel was "the aggressor in the Near East" and that the Arab states
 were "struggling for the return of their native land."  Under such
 conditions, he said, the USSR could only condemn Israel and help
 the Arabs.
 Recent Soviet statements have blurred the issue of what the exact
 preconditions for improved relations with Israel would be--whether
 "progress" toward a settlement or the actual conclusion of a
 "settlement on a just basis."  A report on an Israeli Communist
 Party visit to the USSR in June 1975, for example, carried
 by TASS  on 13 June and published in PRAVDA on the 15th, stated
 that "settlement of the Near East question on a just basis will
 create favorable preconditions for the development of the Soviet
 Union's relations with all, without exception, states of the
 Near East, including Israel."*
 *  Delegations of the pro-Moscow Israeli CP, led by party secretary
 general Meir Vilner, have visited Moscow at least every other year--in
 June 1973, December 1971 (when Vilner met with Demichev) and June 1969
 (when Vilner was received by Brezhnev, after attending the international.
 communist conference in Moscow that month).

 WARSAW PACT LINKS PROGRESS TO NEW WESTERN INITIATIVE
 The seventh round of Lite VI(Jnna forco redur.tinn ttilkii ISot under way
 on 26 September w.i th Moscow and Lite Eat;t E.uropennr; expressing guarded
 optI.minm that  Lite talks could lead to concrete: rotiu.i.ts if the Wentcrn
 countricn adopted a "renlistlc" approach.  While acknowledging that
 Lite negotlatorn hack n difficult tank, Wnrnnw Pact c:ommentntort; have
 emphasized Lite need to move ahead quickly now, suggesting that Lite
 successful  c.onc.luni.on of the European t5ecurlty conference in ilelulnki
 has net Lite stage for progress in the achievement of military
 detente.   fly contrasting the ['act's "Colic 11.Latory" attitude to the
 Wcnt's "Intransigence" and recalling previous Pact "concessions" to
 Western proposals, comment hat; made It quite clear that the communist
 countries believe Lite ball is now in the West's court, and several
 commentators have openly hinted that it new Western initiative is
 expected In the seventh round.
 As for previous M13FR sessions, comment by Moscow and the East
 European participants has been limited and on an unauthoritative
 level, with Soviet  leaders making only perfunctory mention of the
 current round.   Foreign Minister Gromyko, in a brief reference to
 the talks in his UN Ceneral Assembly address on 23 September, said
 there must 5e an agreement that  will not harm "anyone's security,"
 a theme continuously expressed in communist media.  Gromyko added
 only that the Soviet Union would contribute "in every possible way"
 to the success of the talks.  Oleg Khlestov, the Soviet Union's
 chief delegate to the talks, did little more than echo Gromyko
 when he spoke to correspondents upon arriving in Vienna, but he did
 note that there were now "new, more favorable  possibilities" for
 advancing the work.
 The West's proposals at the Vienna talks, based on an assessment that
 the Warsaw Pact has a numerical superiority in ground forces and
 tanks, have evoked a Moscow counter-argument that there is an
 "approxin.ate equilibrium," a historic "balance of forces" that has
 prevented the outbreak of conflict for more than 25 years.  Thus
 Moscow has argued that NATO's proposals--calling for any asymmetrical
 reduction of ground forces without taking into consideration air
 forces and tactical nuclear weapons--would upset the existing balance
 and give NATO a unilateral advantage.  Defending the Soviet position,
 Moscow's Radio Peace and Progress, in a broadcast in German on 23
 September, recalled that "numerous" statel.;ents at various times by
 "Western officials" have implied that the--e are "no disproportions"
 in the balance of forces in central Europe.  The radio reported
 Defense Secretary Schlesinger as saying in July 1973 that the

 POLI SII COMMr:NT      The most det:a 1.1 ed d tncuss ion of the t;evt'nth
 round and of the issues dividing the sides carp
 in an arItelo by Andrze) Rayzacher, Poland's leading MIIFR commentator,
 in , he 10 September issue of ZYG I E, WARSZAWY.   Rayzacher described
 "defint.t.ion of forces" at?; "one of the chief controver.smai. problems"--
 an Issue that Is "substantive" rather than "technical.."  Rayzacher
 criticized NATO for It,-; "stubborn .Insistence" on the "so-called
 common ccl.ling" on manpower and the two-phase asymmetrical reduction
 proposal which, he alleged, would allow 11e West European NATO
 countries to "increase their troops."  Here, and two other times;
 In ltis article, Rayzacher hinted at the Warsaw Pact's concern over
 the West German military force.   Ile argued that tinder the Western
 plan only U.S. and Soviet forces would be reduced in an Initial
 phase, with reduction of the other. NATO armed forces "to be
 worked out" In some future phase.  This vague scheme, Rayzacher
 stressed, would leave 75 percent of NATO's forces, most significantly
 the West German liundeswehr, beyond the range of any reduction obligations.
 Recalling that NATO had refused to go along with any "acceptable freeze"
 on manpowere while the talks were under way, the Polish commentator
 pointed out that the numerical strength of the FRG armed forces
 was increased :just this year to the highest level ever.   However,
 Rayzacher did not mention increases in the number of U.S. forces
 in Europe, as did Moscow in its Radio Peace and Progress commentary
 on the 23d.
 SOVIET COMMENT      Sparse Moscow comment has tended to be somewhat
 more polemical and less substantive than Rayzacher's
 article.  The only Soviet press comment pegged to the new round, a
 25 September IZVESTIYA article co-authored by K. Pereveshchikov
 and N. Polyanov, said that "never before has such great responsibility
 rested on the negotiators as it does  now."  Recalling the "spirit of
 Helsinki" and the "good intentions" and "firm pledges" at the CSCE,
 the IZVESTIYA article asserted that it was now "necessary and
 possible" to continue moving forward "energetically" at Vienna.
 Indicating that the West European NATO countries were the main
 obstacles to a new 3reakthrough in the talks, IZVESTIYA said:   "Only
 the United States has declared its readiness to make specific
 commitments regarding the reduction of its own troops."  "Those
 Western states" whose armed forces in central Europe constitute
 the main part of the NATO force "stubbornly" refuse to make such
 commitments, the paper continued.

 CASTRO DISCUSSES DOMESTIC ISSUES. U.S. RELATIONS IN CDR SPEECH
 Prime Minister Fidel Castro's 29 September address on the 15th
 anniversary of Cuba's chief mass organization, the committees for
 Defense of the Revolution, was moderate in tone and devoted largely
 to domestic issues, including the forthcoming first congress of
 the Cuban Communist Party.  In contrast to last year's speech, which
 focused on Chilean affairs and harshly indicted U.S. "illegal, dirty
 and criminal" activities in that country and elsewhere, this year's
 speech did not mention Chile and dealt rather lightly with the United
 States.*  Castro all but ignored his old enemy, the Organization of
 American States, which last year was berated for its "shameless and
 prostituted" role in failing to condemn U.S. actions in Latin America.
 Castro this year briefly dismissed the United States' partial lifting
 of the ban on trade with Cuba as "measures that do not carry much
 weight."  In his only significant remarks on U.S.-Cuban relations,
 he called U.S. criticism of Cuba's support for Puerto Rican independence
 out of order and said "there can never be improved relations if this
 is to be based on renunciation of a single one of our fundamental
 principles."
 RELATIONS     Castro has shown sensitivity to Latin leftists' charges
 WITH U.S.     of accommodation since the thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations
 began, and he has been at pains to reaffirm his
 independence and revolutionary outlook.  The strident tone of his
 1974 CDR anniversary speech could be partially explained by his need
 to comment on the then recent revelations of U.S. Government
 involvement in Chile and by President Ford's defense of such actions.
 This year Castro apparently felt less press:ure to defend his revo-
 lutionary credentials, but he did respond to Secretary Kissinger's
 9 September criticism of Cuban support for the Puerto Rican "inde-
 pendence movement."  Castro rejected as unjustified "strong statements"
 from the United States on this subject, noting that Cuba and Puerto
 Rico had been "the last two colonies on this continent" and that "Cuban
 solidarity with Puerto Rico dates back to the last century."  Castro
 made no specific promise of continued support for Puerto Rico, but
 made it clear that he would not be pressured.  He insisted that
 Cubans were "more interested in the purity of their principles" than
 in any economic advantages to be gained from the complete lifting of
 the U.S. trade ban.  He added that "we :.ill withstand a blockade with
 dignity for all the time that is necessary."

 Castro thus gave support to Cuban President Dorticos' earlier indirect
 response to Kissinger's criticise, and, in a more muted fashion, to
 Dorticos' reaffirmation of Cuban solidarity with Puerto Rican
 independence,,*  Castro's remarks on Puerto Rico were singled out
 by prestigious commentrtor Guido Garcia Inclan, over Havana's
 domestic service on the 29th, as the most significant part of the
 prime minister's speech.  Garcia Inclan reported Castro's rejection
 of "recent attacks by some Yankee authorities" and pra;',sed "our
 Fidel., whose honor and dignity not even the Yankees have destroyed
 with their dirty tricks."
 PCC PARTY     Castro gave considerAble attention to the first congress
 CONGRESS      of the Cuban Conn unist Party, scheduled for mid-December,
 noting that "beginning with the first congress, we will
 be living in a new phase of the revolution."  Although Cuban media
 have been publicizing the forthcoming congress, Castro had not devoted
 much attention to it in his 26 July Moncada barracks speech, and his
 remarks in this CDR anniversary speech were among his most extensive
 to date.  Castro explained that the congress would "establish the
 guidelines that the people, the state, the mass organizations and
 the country" will follow for the next five years, and hr. promised
 that "our party will be extraordinarily strengthened by the congress."
 The Cuban prime minister said that as a result of the congress, "our
 revolution will follow superior structures of organization"--a reference
 to the institutionalization process and administrative reorganization
 going on in the country, much of which is to be ratified at the party
 meeting.  Castro also indicated that policies to be adopted at the
 congress would enhance Cuba's international prestige, telling Cubans
 that "we will be having more influence in the international revo'.u-
 tionpry movement and we will be helping in the path toward the
 liberation of other peoples."

 ROMANIA - CEMA
 ROMANIA ADVOCATES SOCIALIST ROLE IN WORLD ECONOMIC FORUMS
 Implicitly rejecting Moscow's standard contention that CEMA insulates
 its member-countries against the Jolts of world economic instability,
 an article in Romania's party daily SCINTEIA on 21 September asserted
 that CEMA member-countries must protect their own economics by parti-
 cipating in broader international forum3 concerned with solving the
 world's economic problems.  Apparently aimed at justifying Romania's
 own participation in economic talks outside the CEMA framework, the
 article, written by Romania's international economics institute
 director Costin Murgescu, is consistent with Bucharest's efforts
 to identify more closely with the Third World.
 Murgea"u's remarks on this subject were contained in an article
 advocating that CEMA members diversify their economic relations.  In
 addition to favoring expansion c' bil.aterial cooperation with non-
 {,EMA countries, he. disputed "certt.in theoreticians" who he said
 contended that the world's economic problems should be dealt with on
 a "bloc-to-bloc" basis.  Murgescu declared that current international
 economic problems could be solved only by "concerted actions at the
 world level" and with the consensus of all states.  Although he did
 not identify which world organizations he had in mind, he cited the
 current discussions now underway within "various international bodies"
 on such issues as raw material supplie>a, food shortages, price
 indexing, multilateral commercial negotiations, and the reorganization
 of the international monetary system.
 Murgescu stressed that the socialist countries must take part in
 these talks not only to aid the world's developing countries but
 also to protect their own self-interest since, in the final analysis,
 world economic instability has "direct and secondary effects" on the
 socialist economies.  A continued absence of the socialist countries
 from these talks, he asserted, could have a "negative impact on
 their own development" and could "create the danger of isolating
 them from the world economy."  In an apparent reference to the current
 participation of Western developed countries in these talks, Murgescu
 also claimed that the socialis. countries' participation was imperative
 to "orient" the activities of these organizations "in the ri?ht
 direction," that is, toward democratization of international   lations.
 Murgescu drew particular attention to Romania's "untiring activity"
 to enhance the "pre:7ence" of the socialist countries in the world
 economy and its "nur  ?ous initiatives and pronouncements."  He cited
 a Romanian declaration circulated at the September UN General Assembly

 culled on "rill cuuntrien" to participate in cntnblinhing a "new

 POLAND
 GIEREK REGIME SCORES POOR WORK DISCIPLINE PRIOR TO CONGRESS
 Followitd tltf publication on 5 September of the guidelines for the 7th
 PZPR congress in December, guidelines wl;ich stressed the primacy of
 "work quality," speeches by P7.1'it First Secretary Edward Glerek and
 articles In TRYBUNA LUDU have frequently complained about poor work
 discipline, apparently forecasting the theme of the upcoming Polish
 party congress.  This emphasis on "work" contrasts sharply with the
 welfare orientation of the last party congress in 1971 and, coupled
 with recent price increases fur meat and milk, may reflect a break-
 down in the rapport between the workers and Gierek'a regime that
 could lead to a renewal of the tensions which toppled the Gomulka
 regime in December 1970.  The new party congress guidelines stressed
 orthodoxy in other aspects of policy as well, underscoring the
 "key importance" of Poland's ties with the USSR, denouncing Maoism,
 and calling for a new world conference of co,nmuniet parties.
 The main thrust of the Gierck regime's intensified pressure on the
 workers was set forth in a 23 September TRYBUNA LUDU editorial
 article entitled "Quantity, Quality and Productivity."  The article
 was notably blunt in calling attention to problems stemming from
 poor productivity, in a manner likely to further stir up worker
 resentment, noting among other things that the rate of average
 wage increases had exceeded the growth in productivity.  It called
 for intensification of "the discipline of employment and wages,"
 which must be adhered to with "iron-clad strictness."
 The article in effect took the line that everything conducive to
 better performance, e.uch as more modern machinery and favorable
 working conditions, had been provided, but chat the workers had
 not lived up to their part of the bargain.  Thus the article pointed
 out that losses due to defective production were growing at a
 rate that could not be offset by production of acceptable quality.
 The article appeared to convey the threat of dace work pay as a
 remedy, registering approval of the principle of monetary incentives--
 a system resented during the Gomulka regime an a device for squeezing
 more production out of the workers with little real monetary gain.
 The article stressed that "better remuneration: better pay for a
 better effort," was a principle beneficial to both the worker and
 the state and was socially justified.
 Poor work performance and absenteeism were attacked in a Sapocinski
 article in the 17 September TRYBUNA LUDU, reprinted also in the
 same day's ZYCIE WARSZAWY, ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI, GLOS PRACY and SZTANDAR
 MLODYCH.  The article deplored "incomplete use of the working day"

 GIEREK SPI'ECFIES     Manifesting nwarcnesa of the dangers of worker
 discontent, Gierek has couched  his demands for
 better work discipline and productivity in somewhat softer terms
 than the party prens.  Thus, in dine-jading the new congress guideline;
 at the PZPR Central. Committee plenum on the 4th, the Polish leader
 nebulously blamed "poor labor organization" for the fact that, deupite
 the benefit of shorter working hours, absenteeism was or the rise
 and machines were standing idle.  Attributing continued shortages of
 consumer goods in part to recession in the capitalist world ard to
 the failure of agricultural production to meet increased consumer
 demands, he conceded that "we recently again Increased the purchase
 prices of meat, milk, and other farm produce," for the purpose of
 stimulating output of these productr.. Gierek offered little comfort
 to the consumer in noting that the only remedies for this situation
 were improvements in production, in food processing, and "in the
 shaping of consumption."
 Gierek issued a direct appeal for improved work discipline, at a
 youth meeting in Koszalin on the 6th.   Following general criticism
 of too much waste in production due to neglect or incompetence, he
 called on the young workers to help boost labor productivity through
 i-apiu' d punctuailty, exactitude, and a sense of duty.
 Addressing party activists at Sosnowiec mine on the 19th, Gierek
 reiterated his complaint at the 4 September plenum that shorter working
 hours had been accompanied by increased absenteeism and idle machines.
 On the potentially expl sive meat shortage, he told his audience
 that his regime thad tried to improve the situation by diverting meat
 earmarked for export to the home market and by importing more meat,
 but Gierek was strikingly candid regarding the lack of prospects for
 improvement.  He predicted that meat production would not be able
 to keep pace with demand and that lower-buicket workers who get wage
 increases might have co spend their entire increments for the purchase
 of higher-priced meat, adding that "I am afraid there might be some
 more troubles here."

 NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS LOW-KEYED) NC EDITORIAL ISSUED
 The celebration of the 26th anniversary of the PRC's founding
 on 1 October was a lackluster affair, highlighted by an
 anniversary eve reception given by Vice Premier Teng IIuiao-ping
 "in the name of" the ailing Chou En-lni, who did not attend,
 the first time he has failed to appear for the occasion.  All
 currently active Peking-based Politburo leaders have publicly
 welcomed National Day except for trade union leader Ni Chih-fu,
 who inexplicably dropped from public view several months ago.
 Of those Politburo members not currently in Peking, party Vice
 Chairman Wang Hung-wen appeared in Shanghai and Chen Hsi-lien and
 Saifudin were in Sinkiang.  Reports on other provincially based
 Politburo members are not yet available.
 In his toast at the reception, Teng noted the need to "promote
 stability and unity" in order to attain the goal, announced by
 Chou at the National People's Congress last January, of building
 "CW.na into a powerful socialist country before thu end of the
 century."  Teng gave a special welcome to Cambodian Prince
 Sihanouk among the many foreign guests and reaffirmed Chinese
 determination to liberate Taiwan.  Notably absent at the
 reception were representatives of the Burmese and Indonesian
 Communist parties resident in Peking, who have been routinely
 noted at such receptions by NCNA in past years.
 The anniversary was also marked by the usual round of parties and
 cultural events in Peking's parks, but it iailed to trigger the
 customary RED FLAG-PEOPLE'S DAILY-LIBERATION ARMY DAILY
 joint editorial which has marked all National Day anniversaries
 since 1967, except for 1971 when the Lin Piao affair caused
 cancellation of most National Day events.  Prior to 1967 National
 Day had been greeted by separate editorials in the major Peking
 newspapers.  This year Peking newspapers carried only the usual
 frontpage photograph of Mao, along with several quotat'.ons from
 Mao's works calling for greater unity and increased production.
 NCNA's 1 October review of central newspaper coverage of National
 Day celebrations did, however, call public attention to a
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial issued the same day to mark the 20th
 anniversary of the founding of the Sinkiang  Autonomous Region.
 The editorial focused on the celebrations in Sinkiang to jointly
 welcome the anniversary of the founding of the PRC and the
 anniversary of establishment of the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region.

 NCNA's 30 September nnmel.ist of offl.cinl.n attending the National.

 PRC STRESSES NEED FOR MATERIAL INPUTS TO AGRICULTURE
 in the wake of China's national agricultural conference at Tachai,
 which began on 15 September with Teng Hvino-ping and other top
 leaders in attendance, PRC media have sttvssed agricultural capital
 construction and mechanization as the basic means for achieving
 significant production increases in the coming five-year plan.
 period.*  The slogan guiding the campaign calls for development
 of TachaL-type counties, continuing a stress on the county as an
 economic unit which has been evident during the current five-year
 plan ending this year.  Unit self-reliance is still the watchward
 in agricultural development, although Hsiyang County deputy
 secretary Wang Chin-tzu noted in a conference speech reported by
 NCNA on 29 September that 17 percent of the county's mechanization
 funds were gained through "state investment," indicating there is
 at least some flexibility on the issue.
 Discussions L,i the conference seem to indicate no major moves
 toward communization will be made during the five-year plan period.
 Wang noted, for instance, that ideological education on the
 "communist goal" must be carried out, but stated the need to
 "correctly adhere to the socialist principle of to each according
 to his work."  t. 26 September commentary by a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 correspondent noted explicitly that all "important policies which
 deal with the system of ownership and distribution must be
 handled with caution.  They must not be casually changed, or still
 less replaced by self-designed policies."
 A Kwangsi provincial broadcast on 20 September discussed in some
 detail the problem of propagating communism while practicing
 socialism.  It noted that "some comrades" worried that propagating
 communism might "violate and undermine" present economic policies.

 Tlw broadcast stated that "we must think of communism while working
 an socialism" and must encourage voluntary moves toward communist
 norms.  However, it warned against regarding "the fostering and
 propagating of buds of communism as a license for immediately
 changing the nocialist policies," and that premature implementation
 of comn,uniam would "obstruct and sabotage the growth of communist
 factors."
 The Tachni conference has placed special emphasis on the role of
 local party committee leadership, calling it the "key issue" in
 developing Tachai-type counties.  In addition to the usual
 injunctions that party counittec members retain close relations
 with the masses and that ideological reforms continue, the
 26 September PEJPLE'S DAILY commentary directly addressed the
 issue of le:_.dership instability because of ideological campaigns.
 It stated that adjustments and consolidations of "a few" leading
 groups were necessary in building leading groups ideologically,
 but that efforts must be made to "maintain the relative stability
 of cadres to a certain degree."
 One area in which there seems to be some uncertainty as to
 priorities is agricultural capital construction.  For example,
 Kirin Province on 11 September noted the need to carry out both
 short and long-term capital construction projects, with "stress
 laid on efforts for this autumn and winter."   Kiangsi radio on
 21 September also stated that water conservation priority must be
 given to small projects, not "big and modern" ones.  On the other
 hand, by 21 September Kirin radio was stating that "priority
 should be given to major projects," though it still noted the
 need for speed.  The later Kirin broadcast, summarizing findings
 of a provincial conference, stressed making concerted efforts on
 large projects one by one and espoused strong leadership, high
 quality, and the need to budget "sufficient. funds and materials."
 There also seems to be some confusion over whether any personnel
 may be diverted to capital construction before the end of the
 harvest season.  The Hupeh provincial radio on 26 September stated
 categorically that before completion of autumn farm work "we must
 not divert the labor force to capital construction on a big scale."
 A KIANGSI DAILY editorial on 21 September had seemed somewhat less
 adamant in stating that, even before the harvest, areas "should
 arrange some labor power to carry out farmland capital
 construction," and in demanding that year-round teams be set up
 for capital construction.
 While leaving no doubt that agriculture was the most important
 factor in China's economic development, recent reports have
 continued to pay attention to the concept of a balanced economy,

 with industrial growth spurred by agricultural output.  The
 26 September PEOPLE'S DAILY commentary stated that agricultural
 development determines the speed of national economic development
 an a whole, and it noted the goal of Tachni conference participants
 to "achieve an overall modernization in agriculture, industry,
 national defense and science and technology."  The commentary
 quoted a delegate from Liaoning as saying that to achieve
 modernization in agriculture, industry, national defense and
 science and technology, agriculture was most important.  The
 delegate allegedly criticized Liaoning's past tendency to stress
 industry rather than agriculture.  Similarly, a Fukien broadcast
 on 24 September declared that "only when agriculture has been
 developed" can "we accelerate the pace of the modernization of
 our industry, national defense, and science and technology."
 The reassurances that agricultural development will aid develop-
 ment in other sectors may be necessitated by misgivings felt by
 those in other sectors that they are being neglected.  Extensive
 capital construction and diversion of even more industrial
 resources to agricultural mechanization implies that, until the
 completion of "basic" mechanization scheduled for 1980, resources
 will be scarce for full modernization in other areas.  The
 inclusion of national defense among those sectors dependent on
 agriculture is an indication that recent efforts to better prepare
 the PLA for battle must still take a back seat to agriculture,
 perhaps to the discomfiture of some army leaders.

 NOTES
 MOSCOW ON OPEC PRICE HIKE:     Consistent with Moscow's traditional
 support for higher oil prices, an unattributed Arabic-language
 commentary broadcast on the 28th voiced approval of the decision
 by the OPEC ministers at the 24-27 September Vienna meeting to
 increase crude oil prices by 10 per cent.  The commentary--the
 only monitored Moscow comment thus far on the price hike--
 portrayed the ininistn_rs' agreement as "defending the sovereignty
 and independence" of the oil-producing countries.  The commentary
 made no direct reference to the heated dispute among the OPEC
 ministers over the size of the price increase, but  it did label
 the agreed-upon increase as "extremely modest" and "motivated by
 the hope" that the West would adopt a more flexible stance at
 the Paris energy talks to be resumed 13 October.  The commentary
 portrayed the West as continuing to ignore the interests of the
 oil-producing countries and "again attempting to blackmail and
 intimidate" them.  Thus, the commentary asserted that "Washington"
 had warned OPEC that a price hike would "harm relations between
 the United States and the black gold exporters"--an implicit
 reference to Secretary Kissinger's 16 September remark that
 another price increase would severely damage U.S. efforts to
 establish new relations with the oil producers.
 MOSCOW ON SPANISH EXECUTIONS:  Soviet media promptly reported the
 27 September execution of five Spaniards convicted of killing
 policemen or civil guards, rounding up the wave of West European
 and other protests and adding condemnation of their own in routine-
 level comment and denunciations by Soviet public organizations.
 The "Francoist murderers" and "butchers of the Spanish people"
 were denounced in statements by Soviet youth and women's organi-
 zations, according to TASS on the 29th, and a dispatch the next
 day added protests against the "monstrous crime of the Franco
 regime" by a Soviet peace committee and the Soviet jurists
 association.  A similar flurry of media comment and public
 organizations' statements had assailed the December 1970 trial
 of Basque "patriotic democrats."  Commenting cn the present
 executions, PRAVDA on the 30th predicted that the day was not
 far off when the "sinister dictatorship" would be swept away.
 As for Western reaction, IZVESTIYA political commentator
 Vladimir Lapskiy, in an article reported by TASS on the 29th,
 observed that "even those Western circles" which had shown
 indulgence toward Madrid in the past few years had displayed
 indignation, and it was hard to find a "bo,.rgeois paper" which
 did not condemn the Spanish regime for the "reprisals."  Moscow
 has only indirectly noted Washington's cautious reaction,
 expressed in the White House spokesman's remark on the 29th

 that this was a Spanish internal matter, unconnected to the current
 U.S.-Spanish base negotiations, and that President Ford had
 "expressed regret at the cycle of violence."  TASS political
 commentator Vladimir Goncharov remarked on the 30th that "those
 circles" which had been trying to bring Spain into NATO were now
 keeping silent, aware that "such attempts at the moment could
 completely compromise the bloc which is advertised as the
 "stronghold of Western democracy."
 MOSCOW ON NATO MANEUVERS:  A Moscow television feature in early
 September carried an unusually positive reference to NATO advance
 notification of this autumn's maneuvers in West Europe, but its
 impact was later blurred by Soviet press criticism of the NATO
 maneuvers.  The remark was made by Soviet radio and television
 commentator Aleksandr Druzhinin, participating in a 9 September
 panel discussion of the European security conference with TASS
 Director General Zamyatin and IZVESTIY A Chief Editor Tolkunov.
 In the television discussion--just now available--Druzhinin,
 responding to remarks by Tolkunov on the Helsinki CSCE document,
 said:  "The measures on mutual trust that you dealt with and
 which are a part of one of the document's chapters have already
 produced concrete results.  A few days ago the United States,
 the FRG and Canada informed the Soviet Union three weeks in
 advance that military exercises by NATO forces would be held in
 the FRG next month.  They did so of their own free will,
 voluntarily.  Could one imagine under the conditions of the cold
 war that lasted so many years the powers resorting to such an
 act of good will?  Would they have been able to compose a clause
 on trust that is now part of the Helsinki document?  Of course
 not."  The remark preceded negative assessments in the .?-)viet
 press--PRAVDA on the 15th and IZVESTIYA on the 23d of September--
 which acknowledged that NATO's advance notification was
 theoretically in keeping with "confidence-building" provisions of
 the Helsinki accord but nevertheless charged that the maneuvers,
 coming so soon after the July CSCE summit, were not in keeping
 wiht the "spirit" of Helsinki.  (Negative Soviet press reaction
 to the maneuvers was discussed in the 24 September 1975  TRENDS.)

 DIRK I CONOMY:   i'yon};yan}; ;usnau iced on 22 Sc ptember that the I)1'RK
 had 1prefiilfillecl the six-year economic plan (begun In .1971) more
 than a year ahead of ;sc hrdu.le rutd, more importantly, he:I'or(? the
 JOt:h nunivernary of the Korean Work er';s Party on 10 October.   A
 report: by the I)I'IZK's cent:ral stn t.1SLical board carried by K(;NA
 on the 22d claimed the plan had been fulfilled in "grow output
 value" one year and four months early In industry.   Figures in
 the report show that goals in tsteeL, iron and cement have not
 yet been mot, but the report said large Ls for steel and cement
 would be fulfilled in terms of "production capacity" by 10 October.
 A 23 September congratulatory message from the party central
 committee, central people's committee, and administr.ition council
 and other IPRK comment portrayed the achievement as having laid
 a foundation for attaining the "ten perspective goals of economic
 construction," goals the party's 8th plenum in February 1.974 had
 said were to he attained "in the years of thy, next perspective
 plan."  Current comment did not allude to a new economic plan,
 and a 24 September KCNA report noted only that the "ten
 perspective goals" were to be met "in the coming few years."
 SOUTH VIETNAM PRICE CONTROLS:   Citing the need to "struggle
 against speculation and manipulation of prices" in South Vietnam,
 the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) on 22 September
 issued two new regulations   requiring the posting of prices for
 "all" types of goods and services and establishing a PRG
 commodity and service price list.  The 22 September pr.icelist
 regulations--broadcast by Saigon radio on the 24th--follow in the
 wake of a high-level PRG statement of the 10th launching a mass
 campaign directed against the influence of South Vietnam's
 entrepreneurs who remained behind after the communist takeover,
 and the PRC announcement on the 22d requiring conversion of
 former GVN currency to new banknotes issued by the National Bank
 of Vietnam.  The latest regulations called for prices to be
 posted by "all state-run and joint state-private business
 organizations, trading cooperatives, and private individuals" and
 included such diverse items as rice, gasoline, fertilizers,
 cigarettes, newspapers, and steel rods used in construction.  As
 a possible adjunct to the economic crackdown, South Vietnam
 authorities have accelerated the drive to return city dwellers to
 their "native places" in the countryside.  Hanoi radio cn the 29th
 reported that as of mid-September, 191,623 compatriots had been
 returned from the Saigon-Gia Dinh area.
