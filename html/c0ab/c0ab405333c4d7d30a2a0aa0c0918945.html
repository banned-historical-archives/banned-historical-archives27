 USSR APPLIES NEW PRESSURE
 TO NORTHERN, TIER STATES       .  .  .  . .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .    .  6 , r Page  1.
 The USSR is bringing new diplomatic pressure to
 bear on Turkey and Iran, key states in the northern tier
 Baghdad pact grouping.  These moves follow Soviet offers
 of arms and economic assistance to the Arab states,
 which apparently were a decisive factor in halting, at
 least temporarily, further extension of the Baghdad pact.
 The USSR is now trying to deal a frontal blow, crippling
 the pact in spirit if not, in body.
 ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .      Page  3
 Border incidents continue on the Israeli-Egyptian
 frontier.   Israel reports it used "heavy artillery"
 in countering alleged Egyptian attacks on border patrols
 in the El Auja area.  New truce arrangements for the El
 Auja zone, the possibility that Syria will. release Israel
 military prisoners, and Israel's apparently continuing
 reassessment of its internal and external position
 account for the relatively static conditions prevailing
 MOLLET WILL ATTEMPT
 TO  FORM FRENCH GOVERNMENT .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .      Page  4
 If French Socialist leader Guy Mollet succeeds in
 forming a Republican Front government, it will probably
 be with Communist backing.  The Communists will then
 be able to claim that a popular front has actually been
 achieved.  Right-center leaders (Faure-Pinay) have indi-
 cated a willingness to tolerate a Republican Front
 government, but they still demand that the Republican
 Front disclaim acceptance of Communist support as a
 prerequisite to their support.

 NOTES AND. COMMENTS
 Soviet Bloc Activity in Africa: The.Soviet bloc's effort
 to expand  is economic and diplomatic influence in
 Africa is continuing.   There are reports of new
 Soviet moves in Libya, Liberia, the Belgian Congo,
 the Sudan and possibly Morocco.                       .  .  Page  1  25X1
 Warsaw Pact Nations Meet:   What is believed to be the
 first session of the political committee of the
 Warsaw pact since its creation last May is
 scheduled to convene in Prague on 27 January. It
 will probably enroll East Germany as a full mili-
 tary partner and discuss long-range planning for
 Soviet bloc defense production.  F_           I  .    .   Page  2   25X1
 High-Level Chinese Delegation Tours Soviet Bloc:   The
 high-level Chinese delegation headed by Vice
 Premier Marshal Chu Te touring the Satellites
 has been enthusiastically received, particularly
 in Prague and Budapest.  American observers report
 that the Chinese are receiving more attention than
 comparable Soviet delegations.   In general, the
 Satellites' treatment of the Chinese suggests they
 are following the Soviet line laid down last Feb-
 ruary that the Communist camp is headed jointly
 by the USSR and Communist China.                    I.  .    Page

 Soviet Forces in Germany in Winter Training:   Soviet
 forces in Germany are conducting a normal winter
 training program after completing the annual fall
 rotation of incoming recruits and.outgoing dis-
 chargees'in December. The rotation did not affect
 Soviet ground strength in Germany which remains
 at about 400,000.                      .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .    Page  3
 Khrushchev's '.'New Lands" Speech:   Khrushchev's recent
 criticisms of the shortcomings of the "new lands"
 development program do not indicate there will
 be major modifications of that program.  Most of
 his criticisms were standard complaints directed
 at perennial deficiencies and bureaucratic mis-
 management in Soviet agriculture.                          Page  4    25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 Japanese-Soviet Negotiations: Top Japanese government
 and party officials have discounted persistent
 Tokyo rumors that Japan will compromise on the
 territorial issue in order to reach a settlement
 with the USSR.  Despite strong popular support for
 a firm Japanese position, however, Tokyo is likely
 to compromise rather than let the talks fail.

 N. Korea  N. Vietnam, Outer Mongolia Move for Recognition:
 There' have' been' an increasing .riumbe.r.of Sino
 Soviet bloc overtures in the last month aimed
 at obtaining diplomatic recognition of North
 Korea, North Vietnam and Outer Mongolia.   So far,
 the recognition of Outer Mongolia by India and
 North Vietnam by Indonesia are the only instances
 of recognition of these countries by non-Orbit
 countries.  I                    ..    .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .    Page  6
 Peiping Accelerates Socialization:   Communist China
 is moving far more rapidly than scheduled in
 early 1955 toward complete socialization of in-
 dustry, commerce, and agriculture.                                    The accel-
 erated drive may add temporarily to China's
 economic problems, and arouse widespread dis-
 affection, but government controls over the
 population are believed adequate to enforce the
 program.                         .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 Madame Sun Yat-sen's "Goodwill" Tour:               Peiping has
 made Madame Sun Yat-sen 's visits to India and
 Burma the occasion for reviving the concept
 of a high-level conference of all Pacific powers.
 Madame Sun Vat-sen's failure to comment on Indian-
 Pakistani relations and her acceptance of Paki-
 stan's invitation for a visit demonstrate: that'
 the Chinese Communists apparently will not allow
 past strong Communist criticisms of Pakistan
 to interfere with their Policy of courting that

 country and other SEATO powers.                      .  .           Page  8   25X1
 Indonesia:   The moderate Masjumi party, which leads
 the present Indonesian cabinet,has managed thus
 far to keep the. government in office, but its
 chairman, Natsir, faces an attempt, apparently
 backed by President Sukarno and the Nahdlatul
 Ulama (NU), to deprive him of party leadership.
 His probable successor, Sukiman, would be less
 likely to resist the extreme brand of nationalism
 increasingly practiced by President Sukarno and
 the National Party and supported by the Communists.

 The Bombay Riots:      New Delhi intervened for the first
 t me on 23 January to bring to an end the week-
 old rioting in Bombay and some other cities over
 India?s most critical domestic political problem--
 the linguistic states issue.  The rioting will
 probably die down in the near future and be
 followed by political negotiations.  This might
 eventually  lead to a decision not to divide Bombay.

 Cyprus:   Governor Harding returned to Cyprus on 25
 January, following several days of discussions
 in London, for talks with Archbishop Makarios.
 Harding will tell Makarios that London is willing
 to modify "objectionable language" in its formula
 for a settlement, if the archbishop will agree
 to denounce terrorism and co-operate in estab-
 lisping self-government.  The British seem confi-
 dent, however, they can stamp out terrorism
 whether Makarios agrees to co-operate or not.

 Antitax  Movements on Poujade Model in Italy and Greece:

 new extreme rightist movement in West Germany.
 While the initiative seems in no case to have
 come from Poujade, reports of existing or pro-
 jected contacts between him and surviving elements
 of the prewar extreme right suggest that efforts
 may be made to foster and manipulate Poujadism in
 their interest. I                I .  .    .  .  .  .    .     .-.       Page 14

 The emergence of Party First Secretary N.S.
 Khrushchev as the dominant figure in the Soviet party
 presidium is probably the most significant of the
 changes in the collective leadership in the three years
 since Stalin's death.           Group rule continues, however,
 and policy is apparently still made in committee where
 the other leaders exercise a moderating influence on
 Khrushchev.  Preparations for the 20th Party Congress in
 February have been accompanied by political maneuvering
 and personnel shifts-at the intermediate level.

 THE SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTRY SINCE STALIN'S DEATH .  .  .  .    Page   4
 The reorganization of the Soviet Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs and a number of shifts in foreign
 service personnel are the latest in a series of trans-
 fers, appointments, and administrative realignments
 which have taken place periodically since Stalin's
 death.  Assignments within the Sino-Soviet bloc are now
 held primarily by party careerists turned diplomat,
 while posts outside the bloc continue in the hands of
 career diplomats.  These changes appear to be aimed
 primarily at making the Foreign Ministry a more effective
 instrument of the Khrushchev-Bulganin diplomacy.  They
 may, however, be related to Foreign Minister Molotov's
 public humbling in September, and it is possible that
 many of the changes within the ministry since Stalin's
 death have been the subject of controversy between
 Molotov and the party leaders.                                                 25X1

 Many important upward revisions have recently been

 plan well ahead of schedule.  The plan covers the period
 1953  through  1957?.   Plan goals for socialization of
 farming,  industry and commerce have already been achieved,
 and industrial production during 1956 may approach the
 plan target for 1957.   Important elements of the
 economic construction program are ahead of schedule, an
 achievement partly due to strong Soviet and Satellite

 CONFLICTS IN PAKISTAN.  .  .  .         .         .                   Page 10
 The ability of Pakistan's government to make
 domestic decisions and to evolve a consistent foreign
 policy is being reduced by ideological and political
 conflicts which have arisen since East Pakistan re-
 ceived a greater voice in government six months ago.
 None of the warring political factions is yet strong
 enough to overthrow Pakistan's present leadership, but
 the prospect of the government's achieving stability
 and of continuing its wholehearted co-operation. with
 the West seems less assured than a year ago.   Top
 Pakistani officials are now emphasizing the advantages
 of neutralism, possibly to promote additional American
 aid and support.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 USSR APPLIES NEW PRESSURE
 TO NORTHERN TIER STATES
 New Soviet diplomatic
 moves toward Turkey and Iran
 are aimed at convincing the
 states along the USSR's south-
 ern borders that their partici-
 pation in the Western alliance
 system is not necessary because
 there is no Soviet threat.
 The presence in the USSR
 in early January of several
 top-ranking Soviet diplomats
 from Near Eastern posts sug-
 gests that Moscow is carefully
 co-ordinating its campaign
 against the northern tier.   The
 Soviet ambassadors to Iran and
 Turkey returned to their posts
 on 19-20 January after an ab-
 sence of approximately two and
 one half months in the USSR.
 Concurrently the appoint-
 ment of a new Soviet ambassa-
 dor to Pakistan,  Ivan F. Shped-
 ko, was announced on 19 January.
 Shpedko has had considerable
 diplomatic experience in the
 area.   He may bring offers
 with him designed to take ad-
 vantage of growing sentiment
 in Pakistan that neutralism
 pays better than alignment
 with the Baghdad pact and
 SEATO.
 Soviet bloc offers of arms
 and economic assistance to the
 Arab states appear to have been
 a decisive factor in causing
 at least a temporary halt in
 the extension of the Baghdad
 pact.  The success of that So-
 viet campaign also set the
 stage for a frontal diplomatic
 drive on the members of the
 pact, in which the USSR sees
 its best chance to date of
 crippling the spirit, if not
 the body, of the pact.
 Turkey
 Although Turkey has sharply
 rebuffed friendly Soviet over-
 tures in the past, Moscow has
 persisted in its efforts to
 neutralize this keystone of
 the Western alliance system in
 the Middle East.   Khrushchev

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 In his Supreme Soviet
 speech on 29 December, Khxush-
 chev again admitted that some
 part of the blame for the un-
 favorable state of Soviet-
 Turkish relations lay with the
 USSR.
 President Voroshilov went
 out of his way on 10 January to
 outline to the new Turkish am-
 bassador the importance of good
 relations between the two coun-
 tries and repeated Khrushchev's
 remark that the blame for un-
 favorable Soviet-Turkish rela-
 tions was not all on one side.
 Unlike previous encounters be-
 tween Soviet leaders and the
 Turks, no reference was made
 to Turkey's role in NATO.   Voro-
 shilov urged an improvement of
 relations between the USSR and
 Turkey independent of other
 relationships.   According to
 President Baya.r, Voroshilov
 also told the ambassador that
 the USSR was willing to give
 Turkey unlimited economic aid
 "with no strings attached,"
 and to help it out of its
 present financial straits.
 Baya.r said that the USSR
 has stepped up its campaign
 against the present Turkish
 government through the distri-
 bution of leaflets in principal
 Turkish cities where there are
 "large numbers of marginal work-
 ers" who might be influenced
 by Soviet propaganda.   The leaf-
 lets attack the pro-Western
 policies of the government and
 call upon the people to bring
 about a. change.
 Moscow probably-does not
 expect the Turks to respond
 favorably to its offers at this
 time, but calculates that ulti-
 mately Soviet "bargains" in
 economic and financial assistance
 will have some effect.   Turkish
 officials have voiced some con-
 cern lest the Soviet offers, if
 propagandized in Turkey, might
 increase the power of opposition
 elements.
 While it is unlikely under
 present conditions that the
 Soviet offers will be given
 any immediate consideration,
 the Turkish government is ex-
 ploiting them to expedite the
 long-awaited loan from the Unit-
 ed States.,
 After a. brief period of
 coolness following Iran's ad-
 herence to the Baghdad pact,
 Moscow is again pursuing a
 policy of aggressive cajolery
 aimed at encouraging Iran to
 reappraise its military align-
 ment with the West.
 Hard on the heels of ex-
 ceptionally cordial treatment
 of the Iranian parliamentary
 delegation in Moscow, Foreign
 Minister Molotov on 13 January
 attended an Iranian embassy
 reception and told the Iranian
 ambassador that if Iran is not
 satisfied with the assurances
 of nonaggression contained in
 the 1927 Soviet-Iranian treaty,
 it could be replaced by a four-
 power guarantee of Iranian
 neutrality.   According to the
 Iranian minister of foreign
 affairs, Molotov stated that
 the USSR would be happy to
 participate in such a. guaran-
 tee if Iran would withdraw from
 the Baghdad pact.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 Iranian officials fear
 an increase of neutralist senti-
 ment, unrest among the popula-
 tion, and indecision in the
 government  if Moscow should
 propagandize such an approach.
 A Tehran newspaper has already
 stated that the idea of a new
 nonaggression treaty with the
 Soviet Union has been mentioned
 in Tehran political circles.

 on the Israeli-Egyptian fron-
 tier.   Israel reports it used
 "heavy artillery" on the fron-
 tier on 21 January in counter-
 ing attacks on border patrols
 in the El Auja area.
 Incidents on the Egyptian-
 Israeli frontier may be reduced
 if Egypt and Israel observe
 the new UN arrangements in the
 El Auja zone.  These call for
 demarcation of the border and
 the withdrawal of both Egyptian
 and Israeli military forces
 from the zone. UN secretary
 general Hammarskjold obtained
 Egyptian agreement to the ar-
 rangements on 22 January.   UN
 truce supervisor General Burns
 had earlier received a letter
 from Israel "confirming" accept-
 ance.
 The Israelis claim that
 the UN Security Council resolu-
 tion of 19 January condemning
 PART I
 difficulties partly induced by
 Soviet refusal to buy Iranian
 rice, that the USSR will soon
 propose revival of trade and
 possibly some form of economic
 assistance.   In the unlikely
 event that Moscow does not
 soon follow through on the de-
 marche in Moscow,  the Shah's
 trip to Moscow tentatively
 scheduled for May may be the
 occasion for further offers.
 Israel for its attack on Syria
 on 11-12 December failed to con-
 sider the whole history of
 Syrian-Israeli relations.   A
 long-standing thorn in these
 relations may be removed, how-
 ever, if, as seems likely, Syria
 fulfills the UN request that
 all Israeli military prisoners
 be returned.  The Syrian chief
 of staff has indicated to the
 American army attache that if
 necessary he will do this on
 his own initiative.
 Passage of the UN resolu-
 tion has brought renewed Is-
 raeli efforts to press for arms
 from the Western powers--mainly
 the United States.   It is proba-
 ble that purchasing missions
 have already been sent to likely
 markets of supply.   The Syrian
 chief of staff told the Ameri-

 believes Israel has an arms

 of this. A group of Israeli

 Traditionally moderate
 newspapers in Israel have re-
 cently speculated along alarm-
 ist lines concerning Israel's
 course if the United States
 refuses or delays approval of
 its arms request.   The American
 embassy in Tel Aviv believes
 these editorials may be part
 of a propaganda effort to sup-
 port Tel Aviv's pressure for aims..
 The embassy also suggests this
 press speculation may indicate
 a growing conviction that Is-

 measures stronger than in the
 past.   Thus far, however, there
 has been no indication of in-

 MOLLET WILL ATTEMPT
 TO FORM FRENCH GOVERNMENT
 If French Socialist leader
 Guy Mollet succeeds in forming
 a Republican Front government,
 it will probably be with Commu-
 nist backing.   The Communists
 will then be able to claim that
 a popular front has actually
 been achieved.
 Right-center leaders '(Faure-
 Pinay)'.zave indicated a willing-
 ness to tolerate a Republican
 Front government,  but they still
 demand that the Republican Front
 disclaim acceptance of Communist
 support as a prerequisite to
 their support.   The Popular Re-
 publican party (MRP) in particu-
 lar would like to stay close to
 the Socialists, not only to
 thwart a popular front but to
 posture on the frontier will
 almost certainly be maintained.
 The Israeli government may
 be forced to pay more atten-
 tion to its internal political
 problems if the Progressive
 Party carries out its threat
 to resign from the present gov-
 erning coalition over the long-
 debated compromise on wage in-
 creases.
 vailing at present.
 The Arab states, meanwhile,
 also continue to be largely
 preoccupied with their own in-
 ternal problems.   Consequently,
 the new truce arrangements for-the
 El Auja zone, the possibility
 that Syria will release Israeli
 military prisoners, and the
 apparent continuation of Israel's
 careful reassessment of its
 current internal and external
 position account for the rela-
 tively static conditions pre-
 protest its reputation for so-
 cial liberalism.
 Most parties to the right
 of the Socialists,  including
 the Mendes-France Radicals,
 are worried not only about a
 popular front evolving from
 Communist support of a Socialist
 premier but also about joint
 Communist-Socialist efforts to
 abrogate the law permitting state
 aid to church schools.   There is
 some speculation that to prevent
 such a popular front the MRP will
 be willing to offer Mollet its
 support if he will make so forth-
 right a statement on foreign
 policy as to force the Communists
 to qualify their support.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 The Republican Front is
 experiencing difficulty in
 distributing the prospective
 cabinet posts within its own
 camp.   Mendes-France is report-
 edly reluctant to accept the
 over-all direction of economic
 affairs including finance, and
 wants instead the Foreign Min-
 istry.                    Mollet reportedly feels
 such a move might frighten the
 'right-center, from which the
 Republican Front will have to
 get support for its foreign
 policy. The Socialist leader
 would prefer having a Radical
 in the economic post to reassure
 conservative deputies and busi-
 ness interests.
 The two leaders are also at
 odds over other appointments.
 Mollet is cool to Mendes-France's
 wish to accommodate Mitterrand
 of the Democratic Resistance
 Union and Chaban-Delmas, the
 Gaullist Social Republican lead-
 er.
 Although the Republican
 Front thus faces considerable
 difficulty in forming a govern-
 ment, the need for rapid action, 25X1
 particularly in regard to the Al-
 gerian problem,  is expect d
 speed up the process.

 Soviet Bloc Activity in Africa
 The Soviet bloc's effort
 to expand its economic and dip-
 lomatic influence in Africa is
 continuing.   There are reports
 of new Soviet moves in Libya,
 the Sudan, Morocco, Liberia,
 and the Belgian Congo.
 While presenting his cre-
 -'dentials to the king of Libya,
 Soviet ambassador Generalov
 offered to supply immediately
 40,000 tons of wheat and spoke
 of "unlimited" economic assist-
 'ance,   according to Prime Min-
 ister Ben Ilalim.   Generalov also
 n' dicated to the Chairman of the
 Libyan Petroleum Commission that
 the USSR wishes to apply for an
 oil concession in Libya, but
 this subject has apparently not
 been brought up officially.
 with Egypt, which. regards those
 countries as falling within its
 sphere of influence.   The re-
 action of Libyan and Sudanese
 leaders has not been unfavorable
 to-bloc approaches, probably
 because of their awareness of
 the increased bargaining power
 the offers will give them vis-  25X1
 a-vis the United States.
 Pen IIalim says he will
 definitely limit the USSR to
 normal diplomatic activities,
 buut might be "most reluctantly
 forced to accept" Soviet eco-
 nomic aid, unless he has clear
 eviCynce of support from his
 Western allies.
 Sudanese premier Azhari
 publicly stated on 22 January
 that his government had sent
 delegations to Czechoslovakia
 and other Eastern and, Western
 European countries to shop for
 arms.   The Soviet bloc's eager-
 ness to establish trade rela-

 get very good terms from the

 of the group, Marshal Nieh
 Jung-chen, has been designated
 as Communist China's official
 observer at the meeting.
 Official speeches and

 Khrushchev's "suggestion"
 that a part of the poor lands
 having a high salt content and
 too shallow topsoil be used for
 animal husbandry was an inte-
 gral part of the "new lands"
 program as initially conceived.
 In newly formed state farms,
 such marginal lands were planned
 to make up not more than 25
 percent of the cultivated area.
 In practice, however,  the ini-
 tial effort was devoted almost
 exclusively to meeting the
 goals for increasing the sown
 area, and poorer soils now con-
 stitute over half the total.
 Since the effort to expand
 the sown area is now nearly
 complete, Khrushchev's sug-
 gestion that mare effort be
 put on livestock production
 is timely but not a major
 change.
 Khrushchev also promised
 a limited additional agricul-
 tural expansion in eastern
 Siberia and the Far East.   He
 described these areas in glow-
 ing terms, 'hut his key state-
 ment was, "W' shall not force

 Mongolia's ambassador to India,
 who normally resides in Peiping,
 marks the first time since 1925
 that the USSR has permitted an
 Outer Mongolian official to
 engage in bilateral contacts
 with any nation  outside the
 Communist bloc.
 Efforts apparently are
 being made to obtain recogni-
 tion from the newly independ=
 ent Sudan,  whose loosely word-
 ed replies to congratulatory
 messages from all the Orbit
 countries hinted at possible
 recognition of Communist China,
 North Korea, and East Germany.
 The Viet Minh has indicated

 Peiping Accelerates Socialization
 Communist China is moving
 far more rapidly than scheduled
 in early 1955 toward complete
 socialization of industry,
 commerce and agriculture.   All
 private enterprises reportedly
 have become joint state-private
 enterprises in major Chinese
 cities, including Peiping, Shang-
 hai, Canton and Tientsin, which
 were the principal remaining
 strongholds of private capital.
 Co-operative farming is far
 ahead of original estimates
 for this date.
 "Socialism has fundamen-
 tally replaced capitalism in
 China," the Peiping People's
 Daily concluded on 22 January.
 Direct state or party control
 appears to have been estab-
 lished over nearly all eco-
 nomic groups in China except
 a minority of farmers and ped-
 dlers and handicraft workers
 in rural areas.
 The Chinese Communists
 have pushed socialization well

 ticipating "the most amicable

 and North Korea.
 date.
 The recognition of Outer
 Mongolia by India may set a
 precedent for the recognition
 of that country, and possibly
 North Vietnam, by certain of the
 Afro-Asian neutrals.   Efforts
 on behalf of North Korea are
 less likely to prove fruitful,
 however, in view of the UN de-
 nunciations of North Korea in
 connection with the Korean war.
 Where efforts to obtain recog-
 nition are unsuccessful, these
 countries will presumably con-
 tinue to stress commercial and
 cultural ties, with an eye to
 obtaining recognition at a later
 beyond the Five-Year Plan goals
 announced last July.   Under the
 original plan, only half the
 private industrial firms were
 "gradually" to become joint
 state-private enterprises be-
 tween 1952 and 1957.                                                              Similarly,
 only one third of the peasants
 were to be farming in co-opera-
 tives by 1957.
 Last summer, Peiping
 actually scheduled an increase
 in private retailing between
 1954 and 1957, explaining that
 state and co-operative commerce
 had overextended itself.   This
 plan was abandoned after a
 speech by Mao Tse-tung in
 October and a party central
 committee directive, both of
 which urged acceleration of
 socialization in cities.   In
 July, Mao had abandoned a
 cautious schedule enunciated
 in the Five-Year Plan by
 sparking a mass drive toward
 co-operative farming.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 There will be major prob-
 lems of consolidation and ad-
 ministration of the new joint
 state-private enterprises and
 co-operatives,  although public
 reaction to "socialist trans-
 formation" probably will be
 greater in rural areas than in
 cities, where indirect controls
 over capitalists have been strong
 since the early days of the re-'
 gime.  The Peiping press is al-
 ready discussing the next move
 into the final stage of social-
 ism, i.e., into collectives in
 the countryside and state enter-
 prises in the city.   This is
 apparently to be attempted dur-
 ing the next two or three years.
 No clear reason for this
 important and unexpected speed-
 up of socialization has emerged.
 Mao insisted in a December
 Madame Sun Yat-sen's
 "Good-will" Tour
 Madame Sun Yat-sen's recent
 visits to India and Burma,  fol-
 lowing hard on the Bulganin-
 Khrushchev tour of those coun-
 tries, were apparently designed
 to keep the initiative for
 "peace" in Communist hands and
 to expand contacts with all
 countries receptive to Peiping's
 advances.
 Madame Sun's trip was an
 anticlimax to the Bulganin-
 Khrushchev visit, evoking "no
 great enthusiasm" in India and
 an embarrassingly small turnout
 in Burma,  according to officials
 in both countries.   Unlike the
 Soviet leaders, Madame Sun
 avoided making provocative
 statements.   Her failure to com-
 ment on Soviet support for Indi-
 an claims to Kashmir and her
 acceptance of Pakistan's invi-
 tation for a visit suggest that
 statement that the leadership
 had simply underestimated the
 pressures and capabilities for
 moving toward socialism and
 for China's economic develop-
 ment.   Soviet advisers have
 probably emphasized the diffi-
 culties of state planning while
 there is still a. sizable private
 sector with capitalistic inter-
 ests in. conflict with the
 state's aim to monopolize all
 profits.
 The effects of the ac-
 celerated program will be most
 pronounced in the countryside,
 where peasants have reacted by
 selling off and killing farm
 animals.   The regime's controls
 over the population, however,
 are probably sufficient to en-
 force the program.

 The moderate Masjumi-led
 government coalition in Indo-

 parties from the cabinet,  is
 continuing its efforts to re-
 main in office until the elect-
 ed parliament is seated,.prob-
 ably in April,   Prime Minister
 Harahap has announced that
 Dutch-Indonesian negotiations--
 the issue which sparked the
 cabinet withdrawals--will be
 continued.
 The Masjumi's principal
 reason for wanting to continue
 in office at present is its
 desire to influence the selec-
 tion of some 20 appointive rep-
 resentatives of racial minority
 groups to the recently elected
 .parliament.   Should these rep-
 resentatives vote with the Mas-
 jumi,  the party would probably
 have a plurality in the new
 parliament.
 The Masjumi's success in
 avoiding an immediate cabinet

 chairman, Sukiman, either to
 take over leadership of the par-

 Possibly as a move in this
 direction, Sukiman told the press
 on 24 January that he regarded
 the government's negotiations
 with the Dutch as a "national
 tragedy" and would prefer not
 to continue them.
 Any change in the Masjumi

 The Bombay Riots
 New Delhi intervened for
 the first time on 23 January
 to bring an end to the week-
 old rioting in Bombay and some
 other cities over India's most
 critical domestic political
 problem--the linguistic states
 issue.   The rioting will prob-
 ably die down in the near fu-
 ture and be followed by politi-
 cal negotiations.
 The seriousness of the
 riots was indicated by, among
 other things, the unusual. insults
 hui -Led at Prime Minister Nehru.
 Nonetheless,  the strategy of
 both the Bombay government and
 New Delhi appears to have been
 to let popular passions have
 a relatively free hand in the
 hope that they would wear them-
 selves out.   New Delhi is capa-
 ble of taking drastic,  effective
 action to end such riots and
 has done so in the past.   It
 apparently has been awaiting
 the first signs of exhaustion
 among Bombay rioters to step
 in with full force.?
 The Congress Party high
 command announced on 23 Janu-
 ary that the government would
 not alter its decision at some
 time in the future to divide
 Bombay into three new states--
 namely,  Bombay City,  Maharash-
 tra,  and Gujerat.   This an-
 nouncement will probably be
 accepted as final by opponents
 of the move.
 Moreover, the Congress
 Party's refusal to accept the
 resignation of local officials
 unless they simultaneously
 would provide little resistance
 to the extreme brand of nation-
 alism increasingly evidenced by
 Sukarno and the National Party
 and supported by the Communists.
 resign from the party itself
 should greatly discourage this
 form of protest against the
 government's decision.   Use of
 Indian army troops for the first
 time on 23 January also indi-
 cates that New Delhi is now
 prepared quickly to stamp out
 further disturbances.
 Indian Communists, who
 have capitalized on the situa-
 tion in Bombay by indulging in
 their standard tactics of
 throwing acid bombs and attack-
 ing police stations and public
 utilities, are probably not
 strong enough effectively to
 oppose the government's firm
 new. actions.
 Though it has been re-
 ported that Communists were
 directing the Bombay riots,
 their part has; probably been
 exaggerated by Congress Party
 leaders anxious to discredit
 the Communists following the
 Bulganin-Khrushchev visit and
 to hide the probability that
 many rioters belonged to the
 Congress Party.   The rioting
 on this same issue in Bombay
 last November was apparently
 inspired by Socialists and only
 subsequently exploited by Com-
 munists.   Top Communist leaders
 in Bombay are now under arrest.
 The most important factor
 likely to restore peace may be
 the informal announcement on
 23 January by the chief minis-
 ters of West Bengal and Bihar

 end boundary differences by

 ty chairman Erich Ollenhauer.
 They agreed unanimously to a
 substantive program for Euro-
 pean integration and to an
 outline of political strategy.
 In general, the Action
 Committee's program is the one
 approved in principle by the
 foreign ministers of the six
 European Coal-Steel Community
 countries last June, but its
 political strategy is to focus
 for the present on EURATOM, the
 plan for a European atomic a-

 try to get suitable parliamen-

 so by attempting to influence
 the form and content of the
 treaties in the drafting stage,
 they hope to avert another de-
 bacle such as befell the EDC
 treaty.

 ment's "interference" in pri-
 vate enterprise, and evidence
 of this was seen in the out-
 bursts against cabinet repre-
 sentatives at the Rome Conven-
 tion of Small Industries last
 week.
 Prospects for an Italian
 Poujadist movement will be
 better indicated in local elec-
 tions this spring.   Poujadist
 groups may be encouraged by
 the success of the movement i'ri
 France to run lists, particu-
 larly in view of the growing
 political vacuum on the right
 caused by quarreling of mon-
 archist and neo-fascist parties.
 Poujade has reportedly
 told an Italian press corre-
 spondent that he plans to visit
 Italy in the spring in connec-
 tion with the formation of a
 '"middle-class international."
 While it is unlikely that
 Poujade himself has as yet
 formulated any long-range
 project for international
 organization of rightist middle-
 class elements, he would pre=
 sumably welcome foreign move-
 ments of this type as strength-
 ening prospects for his own
 organization in France.
 SECRET
 In West Germany, Otto
 Strasser, Nazi leader who
 broke, with Hitler in a struggle
 for power within the Nazi
 party, is reported planning a
 trip to France to meet Poujade
 soon.   Strasser returned to
 Germany about a year ago and
 has since tried to establish
 an authoritarian-minded po-
 litical following, but so far
 with little success.   Strasser
 may hope that a Poujadist con-
 nection would attract other
 extreme right elements to his
 support.
 A Poujadist party has al-
 ready been organized in Greece
 and will present candidates in
 the elections scheduled for
 19 February.   If this group
 has an electoral success similar
 to that of its French proto-
 type, the small fascist organ-
 izations which have been nurs-
 ing cells in several European
 cities may be emboldened to
 seek broader support.   The
 French group, as soon as it
 had demonstrated extensive
 popular support, reportedly
 began receiving substantial
 financial backing, from well-
 known World War II French col-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY' SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP ON THE EVE OF THE 20th PARTY CONGRESS
 The emergence of Party
 First Secretary N. S. Khru-
 shchev as the dominant figure
 in the Soviet party presidium
 is probably the most significant
 of the many changes in the col-
 lective leadership in the three
 years since Stalin's death.   On
 the eve. of the 20th Party Con-
 gress, Khrushchev's pre-eminence
 is reflected by his ability to
 control personnel appointments,
 by the adoption and continuation
 of major policies associated
 prominently with him, and by
 the gradually increasing defer-
 ence accorded him by lesser
 leaders.
 Despite this show of
 strength, collective leadership
 will probably continue.   The
 other top members of the hier-
 archy--Bulganin, Kaganovich,
 and Mikoyan---appear to work
 compatibly with Khrushchev, and
 they occupy positions of great
 importance in both the party
 and government where their ex-
 perience and ability are prob-
 ably felt to be essential.
 Therefore, while Khrushchev's
 pre-eminence now appears to be
 an accepted fact, the common
 interests of those at the top
 level may dictate that these
 other leaders continue to serve
 in capacities where they can
 act as a moderating influence
 on Khrushchev.
 Khrushchev's Recent Gains
 Since the demotion of
 Malenkov, Khrushchev has pressed
 steadily forward, seemingly
 making decisions with increasing
 confidence and sometimes arbi-
 trariness, and apparently re-
 ceiving little or no opposition,
 even to his more dubious under-
 takings.   His daring policies,
 presented with great persuasion,
 have played no small part in his
 political success.   His really
 solid gains, however, have been
 made in securing the appointment
 of his political associates to
 positions which are likely to
 carry a slot on the party's
 central committee to be elected
 at the congress in February.
 Over a third of the old
 central committee members have
 died,,been purged or relegated
 to lower  jobs.  . Their places:
 on the new central committee
 will probably be taken by the
 men who have succeeded them in
 their party or government work.
 A significant number of the
 new appointees were closely
 associated with Khrushchev,
 either when he was party boss
 in the Ukraine or party first
 secretary in Moscow oblast.
 Others by their actions and
 speeches appear to be loyal to
 him and in accord with his
 methods and policies.
 Some of the more signifi-
 cant appointments of Khrushchev
 associates from the Ukraine
 and Moscow are given.in the
 table on page. 2. None of these
 listed was on the last central
 committee elected in October
 1952; all may be expected to be
 on the new central committee
 elected in February.
 Appointments made at the
 July 1955 central committee
 plenum have been generally in-
 terpreted as a sign of Khru-
 shchev's growing strength.   They
 undoubtedly strengthened loyal-
 ties already existing and may
 have created others.   A. I.
 Kirichenko, who along with M. A.
 Suslov was made a member of the
 party presidium,  was associated
 with Khrushchev in the Ukraine.
 N. I. Belyayev, one of the new
 secretaries elected at the plenum,
 seems to have been astrong
 supporter of Khrushchev's agri-
 cultural policies, and D. T. Shepi-
 lov, another new secretary, seems
 equally a supporter of Khrushchev's
 methods and policies in foreign
 relations and a trusted emissary.

 Other Khrushchev associ-
 ates and friends elected to
 the central committee in 19,52
 have received promotions. L..R.
 Korniyets   was  named  minister
 of agricultural procurement
 and 1. A.  berov made chairman
 of the Committee of State
 Security.   Z. T. Serdyuk was
 promoted from oblast committee
 secretary to be party boss in
 Moldavia.   It also seems likely
 that Khrushchev's influence
 figured in the promotion of
 General A. A. Grechko, former
 Kiev,military district command-
 er,  to marshal's rank.
 The recall of L. G. Melni-
 kovs closely associated with
 thrushchev in the Ukraine since
 1938,  from the Soviet embassy
 in Rumania to head the Ministry
 of Construction of Coal Industry
 Enterprises probably saved him
 from losing his central commit-
 tee membership.
 The most recent indication
 of Khrushchev's strength was
 noted in the dismissal of A.
 I. Niyazov, party boss of Uzbek-
 istan.    This action was taken
 on zG ,iecember, presumably at
 a special plenum of the Uzbek
 central committee which followed
 immediately the two-day visit of
 Khrushchev and Bulganin to Uzbek-
 istan on their return trip from
 South Asia,
 There have been several
 other personnel shifts and signs
 of maneuvering at the interme-
 diate level,  possibly in prepa-
 ration-.for'the 20th Payty Con-
 gress.
 Position of the Other Leaders
 As indicated above, Khru-
 shchev does not seem to be

 facing strong opposition with-
 in the presidium.
 Bulganin, whom Khrushchev
 nominated for the position of
 chairman of the Council of Min-
 isters, seems content to play
 a supporting role, and a friend-
 ly atmosphere seems to exist
 between the two leaders.
 Mikoyan appears to approve
 fully of the current state of
 affairs. He apparently took
 over the reins of government
 during the recent Khrushchev-
 Bulganin trip to South Asia,
 and there have been several
 indications that Khrushchev and
 Mikoyan are particularly close
 to one another.
 The position-,of Kaganovich
 is less clearly defined, .partly
 because he has been subjected..
 to foreign scrutiny less often,
 than some of._:the other. leaders.

 regime.       His speech at the revo-
 lution anniversary celebration
 on 6 November was a forceful ad-
 vocacy of the policies of the
 regime.
 As for Molotov, he has been
 relegated almost to the position
 of an ideological deviationist,
 whose future, both as foreign
 minister and as a member of the
 party presidium, would seem to
 be considerably less than cer-
 tain.   Molotov's position also
 suffers because there do not
 appear to be any other "forces':'
 within the party hierarchy to
 support his "Stalinist" orien-
 tation in foreign affairs.   (See
 Part III, p. 4)
 Malenkov, of course, has
 been demoted to second rank in
 the government, and his once
 powerful voice in the presid-
 i im?. now .seems to. be all but.
 silenced.
 The other members of the
 presidium do not seem to have
 been included in the governing
 collective.
 The leadership has had to
 cultivate.other:forces care-
 fully lest they become dis-
 affected.  The army, for in-
 stance, might logically harbor
 dissident elements.   Yet the
 officer corps is probably in a
 better position under Khrushchev
 and Bulganin than it was under
 Malenkov, both in respect to
 budget allocations and to pres-
 tige status.  Marshal Zhukov,
 undoubtedly the man to contend
 with in the military, is prom-
 inently associated with the
 policies of the regime and with
 the activities of the top lead-
 ers.  Marshal Konev, with ties
 to Khrushchev, may have been
 placed close to the center of
 the military scene to protect
 the politicians' best interests.
 Weaknesses of the Leadership
 Although the leadership
 does not appear to be seriously
 divided, it displays several
 other weaknesses, not of a. crit-
 ical nature, but possible sourc-
 es of trouble in the future.,
 control is gradually becoming
 centered in fewer hands at
 the top, and the leaders seem
 reluctant to let younger men
 fill the void within the party
 hierarchy left by the elimina-
 tion of Beria and the down-
 grading of Malenkov and Molotov.
 Thus, while vacancies in both
 the presidium and secretariat
 were filled at the July plenum
 of the central committee, these
 accretions did not broaden the
 inner core.of leadership.
 Another possible source of
 weakness--impulsiveness in de-
 cision making--stems in no
 small part from Khrushchev's
 own personality.  He has spon-
 sored, and the regime has adopt=
 ed,     uch ill-planned projec..s
 as the corn-hog venture and the
 new lands program.   He has un-
 necessarily offended influential
 foreigners by his untimely re-
 marks, and has caused the other
 leaders to monitor his conver-
 sations and censor his indis-
 cretions in the press.
 Some opposition within
 the collective seems probable,
 particularly since the leader
 ship has permitted the members
 it has discredited to retain
 positions of importance.   Signs
 that this opposition may have
 made itself felt have been sug-
 gested by such developments as
 the failure to replace Molotov,
 the unexplained announcement
 and subsequent denial that Mal-
 enkov had been promoted to first
 deputy chairman of the Council
 of Ministers,.and the dispute
 between Pravda, and Izvestia
 over newspaper coverage of the
 corn program.   More recently,
 passible signs of dissidence
 have been noted in the post-
 ponement of the Supreme Soviet
 in December, and the recent
 delay in convening several
 republic parity congresses.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 If, in fact, disaffected
 elements have gotten together,
 it seems likely that they would
 decide to act promptly, either
 to force a postponement in the
 congress, itself, or to prevent
 a Khrushchev "walk away" at
 the congress-by focusing at-
 tention, ahead of time, on some
 dubious appects of his leader-
 ship.  Preparations for the
 congress are now taking place
 in a normal manner, however, and
 the recently published draft
 directives for the new Five-
 Year Plan follow closely the
 policies enunciated earlier in
 speeches by Khrushchev and Bul-
 ganin.
 Conclusions
 Group rule continues to
 prevail.   The top group of
 leaders has decreased in size
 and the "chairman" has become
 significantly stronger.  Policy,
 however, apparently is still
 being set. by committee.                                                             It
 is also important to note that
 Stalin-like adulation of
 Khrushchev has not set in,
 nor are there signs that it
 is about to begin.   The other
 top members of the regime have
 leading roles to play and they
 seem satisfied with their lot
 and confident about the future.
 They seem increasingly sure of
 themselves and their policies.
 The party congress has been
 ordered to convene in order.
 to endorse these policies and
 the leadership that has been
 responsible for inaugurating
 THE SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTRY SINCE STALIN'S  DEATH
 The Soviet Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs has recently
 reorganized part of its head-
 quarters staff in Moscow and
 made a number of personnel
 shifts both in Moscow and a-
 broad.   These changes are the
 latest in a series of transfers,
 appointments and administrative
 realignments which have taken
 place periodically since Stalin's
 death in March 1953.
 These moves seem to have
 been aimed 'primarily,.at making
 the Foreign Ministry a more ef-
 fective instrument of Soviet
 diplomacy and only secondarily,
 if at all, at increasing the
 political reliability of the
 foreign service.   The shifts
 may be related, however,  to
 Foreign Minister Molotov's
 public humbling and loss of
 status last September.   If so,
 it is possible that many of the
 changes within the ministry
 since Stalin's death were op-
 posed by Molotov and that further
 institutional developments and
 personnel shifts may take place.
 Post-Stalin Developments
 A drastic personnel shake-
 up in the ten months following
 Stalin's death affected almost
 70 percent of the top Foreign
 Ministry -positions.  By 10 Jan-
 uary 1956, only nine of the ap-
 proximately 76 top men in the
 ministry remained in positions
 to which they had been appointed
 prior to Stalin's death, and
 many of the men assigned soon
 thereafter had been moved to
 other posts.
 A new trend in personnel
 assignments developed.  Over,the
 past 34 months, 20 former party
 careerists turned diplomat were
 brought into the ministry and
 assigned to high-level posts.
 Two of them, successively, head-
 ed the ministry's press division;
 a third is, possibly, head of
 its personnel division; and the

 other 17 were assigned to dip-
 lomatic posts in Sino-Soviet
 bloc countries.   At the pres-
 ent time the Soviet Union's
 top diplomatic posts in all
 Communist countries except
 East Germany are held by these
 ex-party careerists.   Apparently
 Foreign Ministry training is
 considered less important in
 Satellite relations than party
 organizational, propaganda, and
 industrial experience.
 Simultaneously with the
 influx of party men into the
 ministry for work within the
 bloc, steps were taken to re-
 vitalize and improve the qual-
 ity of diplomatic representa-
 tion with non-Communist states
 to which only traditionally
 trained diplomats were assigned.
 Furthermore, steps were taken
 to increase the number and
 prestige of diplomatic missions
 maintained abroad.   In March
 1953 the USSR had 43 foreign.
 missions--the UN mission, 28
 embassies, and 14 legations;
 now it has 48--the UN. mission,.
 40 embassies, and 7 legations.

 tary in Belorussia.   These ap-
 pointments continue the post-
 Stalin policy of assigning for-
 mer party officials as ambas-
 sadors to Satellite counk..eies.
 Another post-Stalin trend
 furthered by recent diplomatic
 action is that of upgrading mis-
 sions.                                                       The legations in Ice-
 land and Syria have both been
 raised to embassies with the
 subsequent promotion of the in-
 cumbent chiefs of mission..  In
 addition, relations with Uruguay
 have been regularized by the
 appointment of a minister. The
 Uruguayan post had been held
 by a, charge since N. V. Gorel-
 kin was released in August 1952.
 Organizational changes,
 too, have been recently car-
 ried out.   The Third and Fourth
 European Divisions (geographic
 desks) in the ministry's Mos-
 cow offices were reorganized
 in late October or November.
 This reorganization resulted
 in the re-creation of the old
 Fifth European Division as
 the Scandinavian Countries Divi-
 sion and the old Balkan Countries
 Division as a. new Fifth European
 Division.  The old Fifth Euro
 pean.and.the Balkan Countries
 Divisions had been merged into
 the Third and Fourth European
 Divisions, respectively, shortly
 after  Stalin's death in March
 1953.  The heads of the newly
 created divisions were both
 formerly deputy division heads.
 Conclusions
 Taken individually, the
 current transfers and appoint-
 ments appear to be consistent
 with personnel policies followed
 within the ministry since Sta-
 lin's death and therefore appear
 to have only routine signifi-
 -canoe.                                                       The large number of
 changes in such a short period
 of time, however, suggest the
 possibility that more is in-
 volved.   Some of the shifts may

 The continued reliance
 on career diplomats for posts
 outside the bloc, however, indi-
 cates that Khrushchev and his
 associates, despite their ob-
 vious impatience with diplomats
 and traditional diplomacy, still
 feel that formal missions to
 non-Communist countries should
 be headed by professional diplo-
 ma.ts.  The top Soviet leaders
 may be expected,. however, to
 bypass   these career diplomats
 in the future as in the past by
 means of special missions when-
 ever they feel Soviet aims could
 be furthered. in .tha.t way.
 PEIPING ACCELERATING ECONOMIC PROGRAM
 Many important upward re-
 visions have recently been made
 in Communist China's First Five-
 Year Plan,  suggesting that Pei-
 ping,                  like the USSR, will com-
 plete its first plan well ahead
 of schedule.   The final draft
 of the plan, covering the period
 1953 through 1957, was completed
 only last year.   Its success is
 dependent on continued support
 from the Soviet bloc, which is
 providing thousands of technic
 cia.ns and essential.   capital
 equipment on a priority basis.
 Mao Tse-tung set a, new
 course::for 1956 in late Decem-.
 tier when he stated that the par-
 ty and the country should turn
 their full attention from ques-
 tions of the speed of "social-

 1955 plan of 109 percent for
 steel ingot and 74 percent for

 target is to be reached or ex-

 Production
 The outlook is good for
 industrial production during
 1956 to rise by perhaps 20 per-
 cent over 1955, approaching the
 Five-Year Plan target of dou-
 bling the 1952 level of output.
 The bumper 1955 crops provided
 unexpectedly large quantities
 of agricultural raw materials
 for the important textile and
 other industries that process
 agricultural products.   More-

 begin operating during 1956.

 In agriculture,
 on the other hand,  the
 regime has set un-

 1956, calling for an

 production of 9 percent'
 above the 1955 har-
 vests--which were good
 as a result of favor-
 able weather--or 3 per-
 cent above the orig-
 inal target for 1957.
 Even if weather con-
 ditions are as favor-
 able in 1956, this
 target would be over-
 optimistic.   The gov-
 ernment has only limit-
 ed programs to expand acreage and
 fertilizer supply.   The recent
 mass formation of co-operatives
 has disorganized farming, and
 peasants have reacted to recent
 policies of the regime by sell-
 ing and slaughtering livestock,
 possibly resulting in a serious
 reduction of farm animals.
 Construction
 The construction program
 was lagging last year but will
 more than catch up in 1956 if
 Peiping achieves its announced
 plan to increase state invest-
 ment in capital construction by
 50 percent over 1955.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 January 1956
 The over-all, five-year in-
 vestment program of $18 billion
 (at the official rate of ex-
 change) has not been greatly en-
 larged but its emphasis has
 shifted, with further reductions
 of nonproductive investments
 like housing and major expansion
 of mlans for basic economic ac-
 ti.vities such as_Lransportation,
 the electric power industry, and
 geological surveys.
 The plan target for 2,500
 miles of new railroads is to be
 met during 1956, more than a
 year ahead of schedule, and the
 goal of building and restoring
 14,000 miles of new highways
 had already been reached by the
 end of 1955.
 Much of this
 construction supports
 an accelerated program
 to open up resources
 of Western areas of
 China, which have been
 populated mainly by
 nomadic minority peo-
 ples.  Expansion of
 communications in the
 coastal areas opposite
 Formosa has also been
 accelerated, primarily
 to increase the Commu-
 nists' military capa-.
 bilities in that area.
 The electric pow-
 er industry expects
 to exceed its original
 construction plan for
 1956 by 20 percent,
 in order to meet unex-
 pected industrial de-
 mands for power. Qlbse
 Soviet suppotxt"' Tr
 this revision in the
 construction program
 has been necessary be
 cause nearly all of
 the 2,000,000 kilowatts:
 of generating equip-
 ment to have been added
 to the industry during
 the plan period was to
 have been of bloc manu-
 facture.
 PART I I I
 Also ahead of schedule,
 according to Peiping,. are three
 of its largest industrial con-
 struction projects:   the Anshan
 steel combine, its first truck
 factory--at Changchun, and the
 first tractor factory--at Loyang.
 These projects are designed and
 built under Soviet supervision.
 The Anshan combine plans to com-
 plete all construction work
 scheduled under the original
 plan three to six months before
 the end of 1957.   The vehicle
 factory, which under the orig-
 inal plan was to begin produc-
 ing in 1957--eventually annual
 capacity to be 30,000 trucks--
 is now scheduled to produce
 its first vehicles in October of
 this year.
