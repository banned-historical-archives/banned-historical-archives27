 MOROCCO   G~s`v
 i
 Morocco's successful intervention in
 Zaire will temporarily enhance King
 Hassan's prestige at home. It may also
 help solidify diplomatic support from
 African moderates for Morocco in its
 continuing dispute with  Algeria over
 Western Sahara.
 The Moroccan success in pushing back
 the Katangan exiles who invaded Zaire's
 Shaba Region from Angola will appeal to
 many  Moroccans, who traditionally
 regard themselves as warriors.  The
 triumphant return of the Moroccan ex-
 peditionary                         force   this  week  will
 also  provide  a  badly needed boost
 for the Moroccan military, which has had
 chronic morale problems because of the
 continuing  guerrilla war  in Western
 Sahara.
 Hassan's decision to intervene in Zaire
 was not strongly supported by well in-
 formed Moroccans. In addition, the op-
 position political parties were initially
 stunned by the King's decision, which was
 made in isolation and complete secrecy.
 The subsequent lack of editorial comment
 in party newspapers has indicated con-
 tinuing doubts among politically aware
 Moroccans about the wisdom of such a
 venture. These Moroccans are probably
 more relieved than ;jubilant over the
 successful outcome.
 African reactions to Morocco's in-
 tervention have been mixed, with both
 moderates and radicals generally taking
 previously determined ideological
 positions. Hassan probably anticipates
 that his support of Zaire may widen the
 moderate-versus-radical split within the
 Organization of African Unity. He has
 shown increasing disdain for the OAU
 since it distributed a report last February
 charging Morocco and Gabon with com-
 plicity in an abortive coup attempt in
 Benin in January.
 Hassan hopes his solidarity with Zaire
 will elicit from other African moderates
 stronger support for his position in the
 Western Sahara dispute. He may also
 hope the Moroccan success in Zaire will
 encourage other moderate Africans in the
 OAU to play a more active role in
 countering radical and Soviet influence in
 Africa
 Recent guerrilla attacks on Ethiopia's
 rail link with the sea-the line that runs
 between Addis Ababa and the port of
 Djibouti-pose serious problems for
 freight movement throughout the country.
 The rail line carries roughly half of
 Ethiopia's total freight, excluding oil, and
 there is no easy way to provide adequate
 security. It has several bridges and runs
 through remote areas.
 At least three bridges were damaged on
 June l in attacks that almost certainly
 were carried out by insurgents supported
 by Somalia. The incidents could mark the
 beginning of increased Somali pressure on
 eastern Ethiopia, particularly in the
 Oga,&en area, which is inhabited by a large
 of ethnic Somalis and is claimed
 alia.
 ges of aviation gasoline would
 eTop quickly in Ethiopia and disrup-
 tion of its trade would be widespread if the
 rail line were effectively closed down.

 Ethiopia's two Red Sea ports-Assab
 and Massawa-a.re served only by
 highways. A shortage of trucks, plus the
 active Eritrean insurgency in the north,
 inhibits the Ethiopians from  shifting
 significant amounts of cargo from the rail
 line to these roads. The Eritreans
 periodically disrupt weekly truck convoys
 between Asmara and Massawa, effective-
 ly closing that already isolated port to in-
 land   connections.
 TUNISIA-LIBYA
 Relations between Tunisia and Libya
 went from bad to worse in late May when
 a US-owned drilling ship under contract
 to the Libyan national oil company ar-
 rived in the contested continental shelf
 area A the Gulf of Gabes.
 As long as the ship remains in place, the
 Libyans, who probably believe they have
 the upper hand, will continue to seek
 negotiations and avoid an open break.
 Tunisia is at a distinct disadvantage in
 any military confrontation with Libya and
 is not in a good position to back up its
 tough talk. The foreign ministers of the
 two nations, called together under the
 auspices of the Arab League, began talks
 IS
 The moderate pro-Western government
 of James Mancham was overthrown on
 June 5 by radical members of the
 Seychelles Peoples United Party, the
 junior partner in Mancham's two-party
 coalition government. Mancham was in
 London  for  the  Commonwealth
 Conference, and the government was
 turned over to France Albert Rene, the
 head of the Peoples Party.
 Rene has attempted to disassociate
 himself from the coup, but he undoubted-
 ly gave his tacit consent. There is a history
 of animosity between the left-leaning
 Rene and the more conservative but flam-
 boyant Mancham.
 The immediate issue that appears to
 have prompted the coup was the former
 president's continuing effort to dilute the
 power of his more radical partners. He
 reportedly planned to unite the two coali-
 tion parties and to postpone for five years
 the parliamentary election scheduled for
 1979. In the last election, the Peoples Par-
 ty received only a few seats in the
 legislature even though it won almost
 half of the popular vote.
 Rene's new cabinet includes several of
 the radical members of his party who led
 the coup. The new President's speeches
 since June 5 have provided few hints
 about future policy, although he has ex-
 pressed a willingness to continue all
 agreements with foreign countries. His
 radical colleagues will undoubtedly have a
 strong voice, however, in both domestic
 and foreign affairs. The party receives
 some political and financial support from
 Moscow and actively promotes third
 world causes.
 Rene has assured the US charge that
 the US tracking station near the capital
 will be allowed to continue to operate, and
 members of the diplomatic community
 and the personnel of the tracking station
 have been exempted from the curfew im-
 posed after the coup. There are some 200
 US citizens in the Seychelles, about 150 of
 whom work at the tracking station. None
 have been directly affected by the coup.

 NIGERIA  j(// I
 Nigeria recently announced a package
 of financial incentives intended to reverse
 a three-year downward trend in explora-
 tion and development by foreign oil com-
 panies.  The Nigerians. are concerned
 about maintaining their current level of
 oil exports in order to provide revenues to
 sustain their economic development
 program.
 Current Nigerian oil production of
 more than 2.2 million barrels per day is
 near capacity. Without additional invest-
 ment, output could fait below 2 million
 barrels per day in a few years, but even if
 exploration were increased soon, no
 significant rise in production would be
 likely before 1980. Nigeria exports about
 1.2 million barrels of oil per day to the
 US, nearly as much as Saudi Arabia.
 The government wants to increase the
 number of companies operating in
 Nigeria and to focus future investment on
 high-cost offshore areas where it believes
 sizable reserves are located. To this end,
 the new program will:
 ? Reduce the profits tax rate for
 companies not yet producing oil until
 all their pre-production costs are
 recovered.
 ? Allow all exploration drilling
 costs and costs of the first two ap-
 praisal wells to be written off during
 the year these expenses occur.
 ? Reduce royalty payments for
 offshore production.
 ? Grant investment tax credits.
 ? Permit companies to amortize all
 but 1 percent of total annual invest-
 ment expenditures within five years;
 the time span has been seven or eight
 years.
 These incentives are the most recent in-
 dication that Nigeria is easing the restric-
 tive oil policies that have slashed company
 profits and sharply reduced investment.
 Earlier this year, Nigeria raised its
 second-quarter prices and allowed the
 theoretical average company profits to
 rise by about 4 cents per barrel, to 35
 cents. This was the first boost in company
 per-barrel earnings in about a year.
 The companies' response to the new in-
 centives will depend on their assessment
 of the impact of the package on their in-
 dividual financial positions. Production
 costs are higher in Nigeria than in many
 ISRAEL   26
 Likud party leader Menahem Begin
 has apparently made little progress so far
 toward formation of a broadly-based
 government.  Talks continue with the
 Democratic Movement for Change, but
 the Movement reportedly has adopted a
 strategy of delay, hoping a strong showing
 in Labor Federation elections later this
 month will improve its bargaining posi-
 tion.
 A major split has developed among
 Movement leaders over whether to join a
 government dominated by the rightist
 Likud, adding further uncertainty to the
 outcome of talks. Those favoring par-
 ticipation argue that the Movement can
 carry out its commitment to reform and
 can moderate Likud's hard-line stance on
 peace negotiations only by joining in the
 government. Control of ministries, they
 contend, would also allow the Movement
 to use patronage to strengthen the party's
 grassroots support.
 Other Movement members argue that
 differences with Likud, especially over
 Middle East peace negotiations, are
 irreconcilable. They believe the Move-
 ment should join with the defeated Labor
 Alignment and other parties expected to
 be in opposition to work for the fall of a
 Likud-led coalition. Without either Labor
 or the Democratic Movement, such a
 coalition would hold, at best, only a
 razor-thin majority in the Knesset.
 Even party leaders who otherwise favor
 joining Begin's coalition are concerned
 that the Movement's flexibility on
 negotiations with the Arabs would be
 given scant consideration should the new
 government's most important posts be
 held by hard-liners like Begin, Moshe
 Dayan, and Ezer Weizman, Begin's
 nominee  for defense minister.  Many
 Movement  leaders interpret  Begin's
 failure to consult with the Movement
 before offering Dayan the foreign
 ministry portfolio as evidence that Begin
 would run a future coalition in the same
 autocratic manner he runs Likud.
 Movement leader Yigael Yadin
 believes that Begin's inability to secure a
 comfortable working majority in parlia-
 sent without the Movement gives it an
 ~rdvantage in its coalition bargaining and
 strengthens Yadin's claim on the post of
 rVgn minister.

 EGYPT-LIBYA Z ) " 25
 Egyptian Prime Minister Salim and his
 Libyan  counterpart,  Abd al  Ubaydi,
 reportedly will meet in Cairo soon to dis-
 cuss the strained relations between the
 two countries. A Libyan emissary, after
 meeting with Egyptian President Sadat on
 June 4, told the press that the talks could
 start as early as this weekend.
 Teisions  on  the  Libyan-Egyptian
 border have in fact lessened over the past
 several weeks, and the propaganda invec-
 tive has softened on both sides. Substan-
 tial Egyptian forces are still stationed
 near the border, and the airfields at
 Matrlh, Sidi Barrani and Siwah have
 been readied for combat aircraft; Libyan
 air defenses at Tobruk and throughout the
 Cyrenaica area also have been improved.
 However, the logistics build-up and the in-
 crease in force strength that accompanied
 the heightened tensions of March and
 April appear to have leveled off.
 For the past month, Libyan President
 Qadh ifi has been preoccupied with efforts
 to deter Egypt from. using the forces now
 assem bled on the border.
 There are some
 300,000 Egyptians in Libya; they form the
 backbone of the country's professional
 and skilled work force.
 Qadhafi has also tried to bring
 diploriatic pressure! to bear  in recent
 weeks, appealing both to Moscow and
 to Arab states to use their influence on
 Sadat. Moscow's response-a preemp-
 tory demarche-initially angered the
 Egyptians and added another irritant to
 Moscow-Cairo relations, but also served
 to give the Egyptians pause. F
 Sadat may in fact have consented to the
 new talks to mollify his Arab benefactors.
 Sadat has no illusions tha: any such talks
 will significantly improve his relations
 with Qadhafi, but Egyptian leaders seem
 for the moment to be more concerned
 with the results of the Israeli election and
 the resumption of talks with the Soviets
 than with their dispute with the Libyans.
 PAKISTAN  ~ 6 - ~ 3
 Prime Minister Bhutto and his op-
 ponents resumed negotiations late last
 week and after several meetings appeared
 close to an agreement that could resolve
 Pakistan's long political crisis. At present,
 the country is calm and the government
 has lifted martial law, following a court
 decision that the decree imposing it was
 unconstitutional.
 Bhutto and the opposition leaders with
 whom he is negotiating apparently have
 agreed on holding new elections, but there
 could still be problems in working out
 Bhutto's role in the pre-election period.
 The opposition will probably have to
 abandon its demand that Bhutto resign
 immediately; there are indications that at
 least some opposition leaders are
 prepared to do so. They will, however, be
 seeking means of preventing him from
 rigging a future election.
 There is no confirmation of press
 reports that the two sides have agreed to
 hold the elections in November, but, if
 true, one of the major points of contention
 will have been solved. Bhutto had wanted
 even more time to rebuild his political
 position; the opposition want elections as
 soon as possible.
 The long political crisis has had a
 serious impact on the country's economy.
 The strikes and demonstrations staged by
 the opposition and the curfews imposed
 by the government have on occasion shut
 down economic activity in major cities.
 Industrial production has been curtailed,
 although  no reliable measure of the
 economic setback is yet available.
 Karachi, the country's largest city and
 scene of some of the most violent
 demonstrations, has been hardest hit.
 Labor problems there closed the port for
 several days. Transportation from the
 port to the rest of the country has also
 been disrupted, and industry in the area is
 estimated to have lost the equivalent of a
 month's production.
 Inflation, which was cut to 8 percent in
 1975 from more than 20 percent in 1975,
 is rising again. Price increases have been
 fueled by substantial raises granted to
 government employees just prior to the
 disputed election last March as well as by
 the production losses and shortages that
 developed during the height of the tur-
 moil. Pay increases in the private sector
 are likely to follow, creating new in-
 flationary pressures

 YUGOSLAVIA 3 7- 4 I
 Yugoslav officials are leaking word
 that the party will soon establish a seven-
 man group to run its affairs. Other party
 changes being mentioned are reducing the
 47-man presidium by half and renaming
 its 12-man executive committee the party
 secretariat. These changes would be the
 first significant steps the Yugoslavs have
 taken in over a decade to streamline the
 party structure.
 The new group will reportedly include
 President Tito,  Stane  Dolanc-Tito's
 second-in-command-and  five  other
 senior leaders. No military figure has
 been mentioned, a surprising omission
 given the current prominence and ex-
 pected future importance of the Yugoslav
 military.
 One official has referred to the seven-
 man group as a "political bureau," and it
 is clearly intended to function like polit-
 buros in other communist countries. The
 Yugoslavs, however, evidently want to
 avoid the appearance of moving closer to
 the Soviet model and are likely to come
 up with a different name for the group.
 Such changes could help clarify Tito's
 wishes regarding a party successor.
 Dolanc will "lead the work" of the new
 "political bureau," thus strengthening his
 claim to be first among equals in the party
 leadership. According to the leaked infor-
 mation, Dolanc will give up his current
 post as head of the executive committee,
 and Branko Mikulic-the young party
 leader of Bosnia-Hercegovina-will take
 over the secretariat. This would be his
 first important position in Belgrade; he
 and Dolanc have had policy differences in
 the past.
 Such a compact group would probably
 become the focal point for decision-
 making. In the present structure, collec-
 tive decisions are supposedly made by the
 large and unwieldy presidium. In practice,
 however, Tito makes most key decisions,
 and the party structures simply
 rubber-stamp and implement them. A
 small "political bureau" would be better
 able to make decisions after Tito leaves
 the scene

 tion leader Bulent Ecevit's center-left
 Republican Peoples Party a larger plurali-
 ty. His party gained 28 seats, but has
 fallen 13 seats short of the 226 needed for
 a majority.
 Ecevit will make every effort to attract
 enough independents, defectors from
 other parties, and splinter-party deputies
 to form a working majority. In the end,
 howeve?, he will probably have to turn
 again to the right-wing, Islamic-revivalist
 National Salvation Party, seeking its
 cooperation either as a coalition partner
 or, less likely, as a 'tacit supporter of a
 minority government led by Ecevit.
 As they proved during their eight-
 month coalition in  1974, Ecevit and
 Salvationist leader Erbakan are uneasy
 partners because of differences in both
 tempe-ament  and ideology.  Each,
 however, seems capable of making the
 adjustments and concessions necessary
 for gaining power.
 Their negotiations will be difficult and
 protracted. Ecevit-having come so close
 to winning outright-will jealously
 protect his  prerogatives;  Erbakan,
 although his party's parliamentary
 strength is down, will still be in position to
 sell his votes to the highest bidder. He
 could switch to Justice Party leader
 Demirel if Ecevit's terms are unsatisfac-
 tory.
 Another  Ecevit?Erbakan  coalition
 would have no assurance of longevity.
 Both men would strive to make any coali-
 tion accord as specific as possible in order
 to minimize the bickering that was a ma-
 jor factor in the demise of their earlier
 partnership. Erbakan might be slightly
 less quarrelsome than before, but dissen-
 sior and indecision would probably be the
 norm
 If Ecevit fails to form a government,
 Demirel will try. His Justice Party scored
 dramatic gains over  1973; as an
 aggregate, the four center-right parties of
 the outgoing government, which he head-
 ed, now hold an absolute majority. While
 a I I   parties - particularly  Er-
 bakan's-would be reluctant to recreate
 the stresses of the former coalition, the
 lure of power would probably win out.
 USSR   45
 4,1
 The USSR continues to limit for-
 eign                                                 operations   in   its   coastal
 waters in an effort to offset the reduction
 in its own fish catch because of the
 proliferation of national 200-mile
 maritime fishing zones. On May 25,
 Moscow extended its control over fishing
 in the Barents Sea to 200 miles. On June
 4, the USSR concluded an agreement
 with Japan that cut in half the amount of
 fish and marine products that the
 Japanese can take from Soviet waters.
 Moscow's  announcement  on  the
 Barents Sea was described as a "tem-
 porary" measure to regulate fishing in the
 region of the Soviet Barents Sea coast.
 Moscow had originally exempted this
 area when it established its 200-mile
 fishing zone on March 1.
 The extension focuses attention on the
 USSR's three-year-old dispute with
 Norway over a demarcation line in the
 Barents Sea. The Soviets want a line run-
 ning from the border on shore to the
 North Pole. The Norwegians insist on a
 median line zigzagging between each
 country's offshore islands. The area in
 dispute covers some 60,000 square
 kilometers, some falling within the new
 200-mile limit.
 Norway hopes that a compromise can
 be worked out, possibly by some kind of
 joint administration; talks are scheduled
 to resume on June 13. One of the pro-
 posed areas of joint administration, how-
 ever, may impinge on Soviet strategic in-
 terests because of its proximity to a So-
 viet military facility at Murmansk.
 Moscow has backed off from
 demands that Japanese catches in Soviet
 waters be balanced by the Soviet take in
 Japanese waters. The new limit for
 Japanese fishermen in the Soviet zone is
 700,000 tons, about half the quantity the
 Japanese took in 1976. The Soviets took
 400,000 tons out of Japanese waters last
 year.
 Moscow also cut the number of
 Japanese fishing boats that will be allow-
 ed in Soviet waters from 7,400 to 6,355.
 Fishing in the Soviet zone may become
 unprofitable for some Japanese boats
 because of sharply reduced quotas, and
 Tokyo is concerned about the effects of
 the new Soviet cuts on the Japanese
 fishing industry.
 The Japanese rely more heavily on fish
 for animal protein than does any other
 developed country. Prices are now some
 30 percent higher than a year ago.

 The changes made in the new constitution give the
 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet new tools to manage the
 bureaucracy. These changes will also enhance Brezhnev's posi-
 tion in the leadership, if he assumes the chairmanship of the
 Presidium, as expected.
 The draft Soviet Constitution published
 on June 4 suggests that changes are com-
 ing in institutional relationships that have
 reportedly been the subject of intense
 debate in the leadership. The draft charter
 strengthens the role of the Supreme So-
 viet and its Presidium in their relationship
 to the Council of Ministers. If, as seems
 likely, General Secretary Brezhnev
 assumes the chairmanship of the
 Presidium, not only will he have the trap-
 pings of chief of state for his visit to Paris
 later this month but, more importantly,
 when the constitution is ratified next fall
 he will also have new tools to use against
 the government bureaucracy.
 A new position-first deputy chairman
 of the Supreme Soviet Presidium-has
 been established, presumably to assist the
 Supreme Soviet with protocol duties. Pre-
 mier Kosygin's retirement, should it come,
 and this new position will open up impor-
 tant additional vacancies in the top leader-
 ship, and further shifts are to be expected.
 In defining the relationship between the
 Supreme Soviet and the Council of
 Ministers more precisely than does the
 1936 constitution, the draft charter
 specifically gives the Supreme Soviet and
 its Presidium the power to decide on all
 matters of state, economic, social, and
 cultural developments, and to control the
 execution of those decisions by the Coun-
 cil of Ministers.
 More importantly, the draft gives the
 Supreme Soviet and the Presidium more
 political muscle. Supreme Soviet deputies
 will have the right to address inquiries to
 USSR: Draft Constitution
 government organizations and officials,
 who must reply at a session of the
 Supreme Soviet.
 The draft also transfers the system of
 people's control committees from the ex-
 ecutive branch, where it served essentially
 as a powerless watchdog, to the Supreme
 Soviet, where in the hands of a vigorous
 Presidium chairman it could be used to
 spotlight bureaucratic obstructionism.
 In the 1936 constitution, government
 ministries were listed individually. In the
 new draft, they are referred to in general
 terms and in broad blocks of respon-
 sibilities. In his speech to the Central
 Committee plenum last month, Brezhnev
 explained that this would relieve the
 Supreme Soviet of the necessity of amen-
 ding the constitution each time a ministry
 is established or its responsibilities revis-
 ed. In addition, however, the change may
 make it easier for Brezhnev and others
 long interested in streamlining economic
 management to effect a reorganization of
 the ministerial structure.
 The guiding role of the party has been
 more explicitly spelled out and given add-
 ed prominence. Recognition of the mul-
 tinational character of the USSR has
 been made more explicit. For example,
 the right to schooling in minority native
 languages, which is provided for in laws
 on education and the nationalities, has
 now been enshrined in the draft constitu-
 tion.
 On the other hand, in spelling out in
 greater detail the relationship between the
 central authorities and the republics, there
 is heavy emphasis on strengthening in-
 tegration and control at the center.
 Brezhnev, in fact, alluded to this at the
 Central Committee plenum last month,
 his carefully chosen phrases indicating the
 sensitivity of the shift.
 The draft contains several concessions
 to the interests of senior party secretary
 Suslov. For example, of the six major
 tasks identified for the current stage of the

 USSR's development, the first three are
 in the Field of ideology. Brezhnev's oft-
 repeated desire to raise the standard of
 living follows in fourth place, ensuring
 national security is fifth, and helping to
 strengthen  peace and promote inter-
 national cooperation ranks sixth.
 A brief foreign policy section in the
 draft constitution incorporates key
 phrases Brezhnev has voiced before in
 summarizing the USSR's diverse aims
 abroad. The order in which these are
 listed it the draft is intended to indicate
 Soviet long-term priorities.
 ? First, the preservation of
 favorable external conditions for inter-
 nal Soviet development and the
 strengthening of the position of "world
 socialism"-that is, those communist
 countries dominated by the Soviets
 and those world communist parties
 still on speaking terms with the
 Soviets.
 ? Next, support for "national
 liberat on"  struggles-meaning  an-
 ticolonialist movements of the third
 world--and "social progress"-mean-
 ing i:he. improvement of communist
 positions in the capitalist world.
 ? Then, the prevention of "wars of
 aggression," and the implementation
 of peaceful  coexistence with  the
 capitalist states.
 The order adopted for the draft con-
 stitution is consistent with recent Soviet
 practice, and probably is congenial to
 such ideologues as Suslov. At times in the
 past, peaceful coexistence ranked higher
 in Soviet foreign policy goals than it does
 here.
 Another article in the foreign policy
 section repeats, without attribution, the
 10 principles of the Helsinki Final Act,
 reaffirming  Soviet  determination  to
 adhere to the line of Brezhnev's peace
 program. The draft elevates to first place
 the CSCE provision on nonuse of force
 to settle disputes. This may have been in-
 fluenced by the ongoing Soviet campaigns
 to promote multilateral treaties on non-
 use of force and non-first-use of nuclear
 weapons in Europe. There is evidence that
 the Soviets are planning very widespread
 and lengthy diplomatic efforts on behalf
 of these proposals, particularly the second
 one.
 A section on defense in the draft con-
 stitution contains assurances to the
 military that everything necessary for the
 defense of the country will be provided.
 The draft also specifies that the Supreme
 Soviet Presidium will formally appoint
 the members of the Defense Council, rais-
 ing the possibility that the membership
 will for the first time be published.
 Obviously with an eye to the coming
 CSCE review conference opening on June
 15 in Belgrade, the section on human
 rights has been expanded, but deals
 primarily  with  those rights involving
 physical well-being-the rights to work,
 to housing, to medical care, and to pen-
 sions. The civil liberties section is un-
 changed, but strengthens the previous
 constitution's admonition that these
 rights must be exercised only in support of
 the interests of society and the state.
 There are new provisions, however, that
 give citizens recourse against the actions
 of officials, to sue those officials, and to
 seek compensation for damages deriving
 from unlawful actions of state or public
 institutions. These provisions appear
 designed to protect the nonpolitical
 citizen, not dissidents or other would-be
 reformers   of   the   system.
 Brazil is unable to meet present or future energy re-
 quirements.from domestic resources and hopes to establish a
 nuclear Industry by the turn of the century.
 11 /
 001
 Brazil is laying the foundation for a
 nuclear i idustry to meet its electric power
 needs. Hydroelectric sources will be fully
 used toward the turn of the century, and
 Brazil hopes to achieve nuclear self-suf-
 ficiency  by establishing a complete
 nuclear fuel cycle. The large investments
 needed may worsen Brazil's balance-of-
 payments situation over the next decade
 or so, but in the long run, establishment of
 Brazil: The Nuclear Alternative
 a nuclear industry would bring substantial
 savings of foreign exchange.
 Imported energy accounts for nearly 30
 percent of Brazil's total import bill and is
 the largest single component of its huge
 current-account deficits in recent years.
 Imported  energy, almost entirely
 petroleum, met about 47 percent of total
 energy requirements in 1976, up from 43
 percent in 1970.
 Hydroelectric power, the major domes-
 tic energy source, meets one third of
 Brazil's energy needs; most of the re-
 mainder is met by oil, more than 80 per-
 cent of which is imported.
 Requirements
 Demand for electricity will continue to
 grow rapidly. Brazil could require as
 much as 180 million kilowatts of electric
 power capacity by the turn of the century,
 up from 21.8 million kilowatts at the end
 of 1976. Hydroelectric capacity is ex-
 pected to reach only 110 million kilowatts
 by the year 2000. Only about one third of

 potential hydroelectric power is in
 south-central Brazil where nearly three
 fourths of all electricity consumption
 takes place. About two fifths of Brazil's
 power potential is in the Amazon region,
 too remote for economic transmission to
 major consumption centers.
 Brazil plans to have only 15 million
 kilowatts of conventional thermal capaci-
 ty by the turn of the century unless large
 petroleum reserves are found. The coun-
 try's large coal  reserves have been
 neglected because of their low heat and
 high sulfur and ash content.
 The government has increased oil ex-
 ploration, spending S400 million on
 domestic exploration last year, compared
 with only $140 million in 1973. Brazil has
 broken a long-standing policy by bringing
 foreign oil companies back into domestic
 oil exploration.
 The Nuclear Option
 Policymakers are turning to nuclear
 energy against the contingency that oil
 discoveries will fall far short of re-
 quirements.
 The nuclear agreement signed in 1975
 with West Germany is designed to meet
 Brazil's requirements through 1990, the
 first stage of the current nuclear develop-
 ment program. Under the accord, Brazil
 will buy four 1,300 megawatt reactors
 with an option on four more. Brazil will
 also receive a pilot uranium enrichment
 plant that can be expanded to commercial
 scale, a fuel fabrication plant, and a fuel
 reprocessing plant. If the agreement is ful-
 ly carried out, Brazil will have 10,000
 megawatts of nuclear capacity by 1990,
 enough to meet 5 percent of the econ-
 omy's energy needs.
 Reported cost estimates for the West
 German agreement range from $4 billion
 to $10 billion. Assuming that Brazil ac-
 quires the full package-eight reactors
 and a complete fuel cycle large enough to
 support  them-the  total  cost  will
 probably approach $1.3 billion.
 Brazil's known uranium resources can-
 not support its nuclear development
 plans. Official reserves are estimated at
 about 26,000 tons of U308, little more
 than the amount needed to provide the
 Nuclear plant under construction in central Brazil
 first core and 10 annual reloads for the 8
 reactors. Undiscovered uranium may ex-
 ist in significant amounts, however, and
 exploration now under way has turned up
 evidence of uranium deposits at a number
 of sites.
 Balance of Payments
 During its early years, the nuclear
 energy program could add slightly more
 to Brazil's foreign-exchange expenditures
 than would thermal power. Over the
 longer term, however, a nuclear program
 should greatly ease energy import expen-
 ditures.
 Including capital costs for the fuel cy-
 cle, for example, total foreign-exchange
 expenditures required for the first 1,300
 megawatt reactor-scheduled for comple-
 tion in 1983-would be approximately
 $1.6 billion, almost all of which would be
 spent during the first 5 years of its ex-
 pected 30-year life. Unless large uranium
 reserves are found, an expanding nuclear
 power industry would require growing
 fuel imports. Barring a radical change in
 uranium prices compared with those of
 other fuels, however, uranium import
 costs would be relatively small.
 If an equivalent conventional power
 plant fired with imported oil were built in-
 stead of a nuclear reactor, foreign-ex-
 change costs over the 30-year period
 probably would exceed $4.5 billion.
 Although conventional plants cost less
 than nuclear plants, and Brazilian in-
 dustry could supply more than 90 percent
 of an oil-fired plant, fuel imports would
 cost about $150 million annually. These
 costs, moreover, probably would continue
 indefinitely.
 Foreign-exchange savings per unit will
 increase as additional reactors are built
 and as Brazilian industry expands its
 ability to supply reactor components. By
 the late 1980s or early 1990s, Brazil
 probably will be able to manufacture 80 to
 90 percent of the components for its new
 reactors.
 Imported enriched uranium fuel for a
 1,300 megawatt reactor operating 70 per-
 cent of capacity would cost about $40
 million annually. Domestic enrichment
 would cut this cost in half, and recycling
 the uranium and plutonium contained in
 the spent fuel could reduce it to as little as
 $14 million per year-about one tenth the
 cost of the oil imports needed to generate
 an equal amount of power.
 Despite large foreign-exchange savings
 per reactor, Brazil's nuclear program may
 have little beneficial impact on the
 balance of payments until after the year
 2000, when the growth of hydroelectric
 capacity levels off. If nuclear power were
 not available to replace hydroelectricity,
 however, the cost of energy imports by the
 year 2010 would be nearly twice the cost
 of fuel imports with a self-sufficient
 nuclear  industry-and  perhaps  con-
 siderably more.

 South Africa's white government remains firmly com-
 mitted to apartheid, and neither outside pressures nor actions
 by the black majority are likely to effect meaningful changes in
 the system any time soon.

 Basic Industries: 1.7 Million Blacks

 Services: 1.0 Million Blacks
 0.8 Million Whites
 Apartheid, to which South Africa is
 firmly committed, is designed to maintain
 the essential labor contribution of blacks
 to a white-run economy. The economy is
 divided into two labor markets: one for
 whites restricted largely to skilled and
 management positions, for which there
 are personnel shortages; and one for
 blacks consisting of semiskilled and un-
 skilled jobs, for which there are massive
 personnel surpluses. The division is main-
 tained by laws, customs, white union
 regulations, and the overwhelming advan-
 tage of the whites in education and train-
 ing.
 Although blacks have received steady
 wage increases in the past few years, the
 income gap between blacks and whites has
 continued to grow. In industry and
 government,  for example, the gap
 between average current wages of blacks
 and whites widened from about $3,350 in
 1970 to $5,000 in 1976. Whites now
 receive about 65 percent of the national
 income but account for only 17 percent of
 the population.
 Outlook for Change
 Widespread rioting last summer and
 fall represented a spontaneous expression
 of urban black  frustrations with
 apartheid, not the kickoff of organized
 battle against the system. Students and
 teenage dropouts-objecting to the
 Afrikaans  language  curriculum  in
 schools-were the principal participants.

 short lived, reflecting fears for job se-
 curity.
 The riots caused roughly $50 million in
 physical damage. They weakened
 Pretoria's standing in Western credit
 markets and provoked a sharp drop in
 private foreign investment, forcing the
 leadership to prolong controls on imports
 and government spending. But the
 government made few concessions to the
 young blacks: Afrikaans language is no
 longer obligatory in black schools, and
 blacks are now permitted to buy instead
 of rent homes in black townships. More
 unrest is likely but is not apt to bring
 important changes soon in the system.
 The South African government is un-
 likely to cut white living standards to
 accelerate black progress. To do so would
 require a turnaround in the key apartheid
 policy of protecting the whites' economic
 position.  Labor and social legislation
 passed in the last few decades has been to
 ensure the opposite-reinforcement of
 white advantages.
 International economic pressures
 against apartheid are still too weak and
 disorganized to force meaningful reform.
 In general, foreign firms in South Africa
 have adapted to apartheid, changing their
 own employment practices only when
 pressured by church groups, stockholders,
 or home governments. Pretoria has either
 accepted or ignored such changes, leaving
 management and unions to deal with local
 labor matters. Foreign firms are not will-
 ing to jeopardize their position by taking
 part in political actions aimed at breaking
 down the system.
 Optimism that normal market forces
 arising from economic growth would
 bring evolutionary change is not being
 realized. Growth had been expected to sop
 up the pool of black unemployed and
 gradually bring black opportunity and
 economic participation into equality with
 whites.
 Reduced infant mortality among blacks
 since the 1950s, however, has pushed the
 growth of the black labor force well past
 the ability of the economy to absorb it,
 particularly since the recession in 1975
 and 1976 slowed the growth of job
 openings.  Moreover, whites have
 successfully tinkered with job definitions
 and  pay scales to preserve their
 prerogatives in cases where blacks have
 moved up to skilled positions.
 At current economic growth rates-3.6
 percent  annually  during  1974-1976-
 job openings for blacks are falling far
 short of the increase in the black labor
 force. Black entrants into the labor
 market in these two years are estimated to
 have outnumbered nonagricultural job
 vacancies by 155,000 a year; the excess
 was 100,000 a year in 1971 to 1973. Add-
 ing to the problem is a steady decrease in
 agricultural jobs because of mechaniza-
 tion.
 An annual gross national product
 growth rate of about 7 percent would
 probably be needed to absorb labor force
 increases and cut into the existing pool of
 unemployed during 1977 to 1980.
 Foreign exchange limitations, however,
 point to an economic growth rate con-
 siderably short of the long-term average
 of 5 percent. No extraordinary spurt in
 foreign exchange income is in sight to
 fund the imports of raw materials and
 capital equipment needed to boost
 growth. More rioting would cut into
 capital inflows and force Pretoria to
 tighten controls in imports.
 Moreover, South Africa receives no
 foreign aid now and is not likely to in
 the future. Pretoria is anxious to insulate
 itself from outside pressures and probably
 would be reluctant to accept any foreign
 assistance with strings attached.
 Under present conditions, progress by
 blacks will most likely be along the lines
 already established-gradual expansion
 of black training programs, more elec-
 trical hookups to township housing,
 grudging pay raises, erosion of rules on
 separate facilities, and perhaps more steps
 toward local self-government for the
 townships around white cities. Improve-
 ment in the black standard of living will
 continue   to   be  very   slow.

 Communist leader Carrillo has a strong grip on the party
 leadership and is a force for moderation in party councils,
 wor,cing to dominate the labor movement and make the party a
 respectable and important influence in parliament.
 Spain: Communist Prospects
 Ir the Spanish election scheduled for
 June 15, the Communist Party is likely to
 win about 10 percent of the vote, but party
 boss Santiago Carrillo will have to deal
 with significant problems inside his party
 once the election is over. Carrillo will
 probably hew to the party's moderate line,
 but he could be in trouble if the party
 stumbles badly at the polls. Given Spain's
 economic problems, he will also find it
 hard to maintain his parry's leading role
 in organized labor and at the same time
 avoid confrontation with the government.
 The Spanish communists have emerged
 quickly and confidently f?om the years of
 repression and clandestine operation un-
 der Franco. The party's surprisingly rapid
 acceptance in a country weighted down by
 bitter memories of the civil war and
 almost 40 years of anticommunist
 rhetoric is a tribute to the population's
 support for reconciliation of the "two
 Spains"-the concept encouraged by
 King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister
 Adolfo Suarez.
 The party's success is also traceable to
 the astute policies of communist leader
 Santiago Carrillo who, since the late
 1960s, has fostered a party image of
 moderation  and  respectability.  Over-
 coming initial internal resistance, Carrillo
 rejected the Soviet system as a model and
 asserted the primacy of Spanish national
 interests over the interests of the USSR.
 He advocated the "Eurocommunist"
 commitment to pluralistic democracy,
 civil liberties, and other principles com-
 mon to most West European democratic
 parties.
 The legalization of the party on April 9
 vindicated, for the time being, Carrillo's
 strategy of working within the post-Fran-
 co constitutional system. His opponents
 in the party maintain, however, that the
 party was legalized because of its
 weakness, rather than its strength, and
 I
 hi
 h

 at
 Carrillo must still convince t
 is a viable road to power.
 The communists have assets in the
 scramble for votes. The party has:
 ? An  experienced  political
 organization that is well-established in
 nearly all of the country's 50 provinces
 and is particularly strong in the most
 populated urban areas.
 ? A strong leadership with a
 well-defined and articulately presented
 political strategy.
 ? A  formidable  propaganda
 machine, including a clandestine radio
 station that broadcasts from Romania.
 ? A firm base in organized labor; it
 controls the most powerful of the
 newly-legalized trade unions, the
 Workers Commissions.
 ? An unassailable-record of opposi-
 tion to Franco.
 These strengths contrast with the dis-
 array of most Spanish parties. Com-
 munist domination of working class
 neighborhood associations, which have es-
 tablished a sound reputation for resolving
 grievances, could be especially effective in
 turning out the vote, and possibly boost
 the party's share over the 10 percent
 mark.
 The party's showing at the polls will be
 affected, however, by the civil war legacy
 of distrust that persists in the military and
 in many quarters of the civilian popula-
 tion, even among leftists. Furthermore,
 the wrenching transformation from a
 tightly-controlled  and dedicated
 clandestine organization to an "open par-
 ty" has opened old wounds and inflicted
 new ones in the party itself.

 The Return of La Pasionaria
 Some of these problems were
 highlighted by the return to Spain last
 month of Dolores Ibarruri-the 81-year-
 old titular head of the party-after near-
 ly 40 years of exile in Moscow. At her first
 public appearance, an emotional rally of
 some 35,000 supporters, "La Pasionaria"
 embarrassed the party's leadership by
 praising the USSR and declaring that
 Eurocommunism does not exist. Subse-
 quently the party announced that "health
 reasons" prevented her from participating
 in the ensuing press conference. Carrillo
 and Ibarruri have both stoutly denied that
 they have policy differences, but Carrillo
 confessed to reporters that he found her
 remarks about Eurocommunism "very
 strange."
 La Pasionaria's peccadillos are not in
 themselves significant since she has little
 power in party councils. They are, how-
 ever, symbolic of two deep divisions that
 have long existed with the party. A hard-
 core Stalinist minority remains out of
 tune with Carrillo's moderate line, and a
 "generation gap" separates many of the
 elderly members who fought in the civil
 war and endured imprisonment and exile
 during the Franco era from younger
 militants who chafe under the party's
 older leaders.
 During the past few months Carrillo
 has had to fight dissension on both these
 fronts.   Older   rank-and-file
 Stalinists-pointing a  contemptuous
 finger at the party's recent efforts to avoid
 confronting the government in the
 streets-accuse him of having made too
 many concessions as a price for legality.
 Younger militants also object to his
 moderate approach to the government
 and complain about the authoritarian way
 he imposes his Eurocommunist policy on
 the party.
 Carrillo is a tough infighter who has
 survived nearly 40 years in the upper
 councils of the party. He has defeated the
 Stalinists before-most decisively in the
 early 1970s when he expelled a Soviet-
 backed  faction led by Enrique
 Lister-and probably feels confident that
 he can contain them again. The Stalinists
 the party's leadership be democratically
 elected.
 Internal criticism of Carrillo's policies
 reportedly increased dramatically follow-
 ing a plenum of the party's central com-
 mittee in mid-April. The central com-
 mittee, apparently alarmed by the
 Spanish military's strongly negative reac-
 tion to the party's legalization, attempted
 to mollify the armed forces by announcing
 the party's acceptance of the Spanish flag,
 its support for the monarchy (as long as
 the monarchy works for democracy), its
 commitment to national unity, and its
 dedication to democracy.
 The central committee reached these
 controversial decisions without consulting
 the rank and file, and the statement raised
 a howl of protest when party members
 read about it in the press. Although the
 protests focused on specific issues, it was
 the authoritarian manner in which the
 decisions were reached that sparked most
 of the criticism.
 In Catalonia, where the opposition is
 traditionally anti-monarchical, some par-
 ty militants told the press that they were
 Republicans before they were Com-
 munists and boasted that the Catalan par-
 ty base simply would not accept the
 Dolores Ibarruri, titular head of Spain's Communist Party
 are not likely to pose a serious threat un-
 less Carrillo fails to prove that his tactic
 of moderation is benefiting the party-for
 example, if the party does not win the
 predicted 7 to 10 percent of the vote in the
 coming election.
 Carrillo seems more concerned by the
 "generation gap." It will not go away if
 the party is successful at the polls; a
 strong electoral showing could even en-
 courage militants to press demands for
 greater internal democracy. This form of
 dissidence is also likely to increase as the
 party expands and draws in members who
 have not been subject to party disci-
 pline in the past.
 Growing Dissent
 The first rumbling that there was grow-
 ing dissent appeared in the Spanish press
 in early April after a group of communist
 lawyers issued a document criticizing the
 party's leadership. In it they charged that
 the party had lost its revolutionary
 character and accused Carrillo and his
 colleagues of making deals with the
 government. They further noted with
 regret that although the party was on the
 verge of legality there had been no in-
 crease in its internal democracy. Finally,
 the lawyers proposed that all members of

 decisions. Apparently party officials from
 Madrid were able to smooth over
 differences for the time being. The inci-
 dent  could, however,  foreshadow
 problems between the central party
 leadership and  the strong, nominally
 autonomous regional branches.
 Carrillo's Defense
 Carrillo and his colleagues have met
 specific criticism of party decisions by
 stressing that they were necessary, tac-
 tical, and successful in allaying military
 fears.
 The criticism of the party's lack of in-
 ternal democracy is hard to counter,
 however. Officially, Carrillo endorses the
 principle of democratic centralism, under
 which party members are free to discuss
 issues within the organization but only un-
 til a decision has been reached.
 One of Carrillo's most effective tactics
 has been to insist that the party must close
 ranks and allow nothing to interfere with
 the effort to win as many votes as possible
 in the election. His efforts appear to have
 succeeded, and for the past month the
 party membership has been pulling more
 or less in the same direction.
 Rumors of Carrillo's imminent ouster
 discourage foreign investment
 necessary for growth.
 ? Act with as much restraint as
 possible in labor matters to avoid
 economic destabilization.
 ? Pursue a Eurocommunist foreign
 policy,  advocating  Spanish
 membership in the EC, acquiescing in
 the defense treaty with the US and
 possibly membership in NATO, and
 criticizing the USSR when the occa-
 sion arises.
 So long as the party perceives the
 military to be a potential threat-it is the
 only remaining Francoist force capable of
 reversing the party's legalization-and so
 long as the party does not suffer signifi-
 cant reverses in elections or parliament,
 party members are likely to accept this
 approach.
 Carrillo's goal could conflict, however,
 with his effort to establish the party as the
 only true representative of the working
 class. The greatest strain on his policy will
 almost certainly come from organized
 labor, especially if the next government
 imposes harsh austerity measures. There
 have already been signs that the com-
 munists will have trouble, even in the par-
 ty-dominated Workers Commissions,
 making their political objectives mesh
 with worker demands.
 Last fall, when the Workers Com-
 missions abandoned for the time being
 attempts to build a single, united labor
 confederation  and  played  the
 government's game by applying for
 legalization as a trade union, several
 radical factions pulled out, exposing the
 communists as the moving force behind
 the union. Since then, the Workers Com-
 missions have sought to avoid any con-
 frontations with the government that
 might endanger the Communist Party's
 bid for legality.
 Last month, during the turbulent Bas-
 que campaign for full political amnesty,
 the Communist Party and the Workers
 Commissions refused to support the call
 for a nationwide general strike. They
 asserted that strikes and demonstrations
 might jeopardize the parliamentary elec-
 tions. This stand not only provoked
 abound, but this does not seem likely any
 time soon. His success in containing dis-
 sidence during the critical pre-election
 period implies that he is still firmly in con-
 trol. There is no viable alternative.
 Carrillo's Goals
 Carrillo's twin goals reportedly are to
 build the Communist Party into a respect-
 able organization that can exert its in-
 fluence through parliament and to con-
 solidate the party's dominance of labor.
 He estimates that becoming a genuine op-
 position power will take three to five
 years.
 In order to achieve these goals, Carrillo
 must convince skeptics in both his party
 and the military that the democratic
 system will work in Spain and that the
 communists should take part in it.
 Toward this end, Carrillo seems likely to
 urge that the party:
 ? Cooperate  informally  with
 Spain's moderate, centrist majority to
 ensure the political stability necessary
 to prevent military intervention.
 ? Resist political polarization in the
 country that might enable the hostile
 and frustrated right wing to pull off a
 military coup.
 ? Play down demands for radical
 change in the economy in order not to

 criticism from other leftists but also tore
 open the papered-over rift between com-
 munists and                 noncommunists in the
 Workers Commissions.
 Noncommunist members complained
 bitterly and publicly that the communist
 leaders of the union were using the
 Workers Commissions for political pur-
 poses at the expense of workers' interests.
 A Basque branch of the Workers Com-
 missions went so far as to condemn the
 action of the confederation's national
 leadership and called for the resignation
 of Marcelino Camacho, the communist
 head of the organization.
 Some degree of control over organized
 labor will be a prerequisite for the con-
 tinuation of Carrillo's policy of modera-
 tion. Without this major trump card, the
 party would have little negotiating power
 with  the  next  government.  But  the
 party has a thin line to walk if it is to
 enhance its leverage with the labor rank
 and file without jeopardizing its new
 image of respectability in the country
 as a whole.
 The  potential  conflict  between
 Carrillo's two major goals could lead to
 renewed questioning within the party of
 the wisdom of his policies. Carrillo's sup-
 port among the leadership of the party
 seems sound, and the people most likely
 to move onto the central or executive
 committees in the near future-a large
 number of members on both commit-
 tees is over 60 years old-seem likely
 to endorse his line.
 The depth of support in the party,
 however, is more difficult to gauge. The
 party rank and file probably does not fully
 understand Carrillo's rationalization for
 the break with Moscow, the Eurocom-
 munist line, or the declaration of support
 for the monarchy. Party members have,
 however, demonstrated a willingness to
 follow Carrillo's lead-either because
 they believe in his concepts or because
 they have accepted the tactical necessity
 of his policy.
 Carrillo is a past master at riding the
 currents of change and achieving unity
 among bickering factions. His grip on the
 party is strong enough, and his ambition
 great enough, for him to retain control
 even during the period of economic and
 social turbulence that may follow the elec-
 tion this month. As long as he is at the
 old
 heaof the party, radical Chan es
 are  nikely.
 China in recent months has moved to restore discipline in
 the schools and-within limits-to ease restrictions on cultural
 activity.
 7   China: Educational and Cultural Reform
 Since the purge of China's leading
 leftists last October, Peking has taken
 several steps to improve the Chinese
 educational system and to relax the
 stranglehold on cultural life. Peking's call
 to "let a hundred flowers bloom" in
 literature and the arts, however, has so far
 focused on the revival of older, politically
 acceptable works, rather than on the crea-
 tion of new and innovative ones. China's
 leaders, moreover, seem willing to allow
 real debate only in fields-such as science
 and  technology-that  might  benefit
 China's economic development.
 Discipline in Schools
 One of the most important steps has
 been an attempt to restore discipline in
 Chinese schools, many of which have been
 torn by factional struggles and under-
 mined by lax educational policies since
 the Cultural Revolution a decade ago.
 The latest effort to restore discipline first
 became apparent early this year in news
 articles that attacked the leftists for un-
 dermining the authority of teachers and
 encouraging students to revolt. An article
 in People's Daily in February, for exam-
 ple, denounced the leftists for wanting to
 "make revolution without teachers" and
 for encouraging students to believe that
 their only job was to transform other
 people's attitudes, not their own.
 An item in the Kuangming Daily in
 March was even harsher, charging that
 leftists had "upset the regular order of
 schools," abolished school discipline and
 "rational rules and regulations," and tried
 "by every means to create chaos in
 schools"-moves that were "contrary to
 Mao Tse-tung's principles."
 In  February,  central education
 authorities ordered students to stop at-
 tacking their teachers for political mis-
 takes, to study conscientiously, and to pay
 attention  to  their teachers. Several
 schools have tried to implement these
 orders. A school in Honan Province has
 been made a model for reimposing dis-
 cipline in schools throughout the country.
 In some schools, proposals have been
 discussed for strengthening discipline, in-
 cluding the reintroduction  of strict

 grading standards. A school in Canton
 requires students to hand in work on time,
 attend lectures, and remain quiet in class.
 Repeated offenders are called before the
 school's revolutionary committee, and, in
 extreme cases, may be expelled.
 Efforts to restore order in Chinese
 schools nave been helped by the resump-
 tion of strict grading standards and ex-
 ams, es 3ecially college entrance exams.
 The leadership has found that students
 whose careers depend at least in part on
 academic achievement, rather than on
 vague standards of political reliability,
 have been less inclined to engage in dis-
 ruptive political activities. On the other
 hand, continued propaganda stressing dis-
 cipline in schools may also reflect some
 resistance on the part of students dis-
 gruntled with the purge of the leftists, who
 had worked actively to gain the support of
 young people.
 Cultural Revival
 In the cultural field, a number of films
 and plays produced before the Cultural
 Revolution and later banned by the left-
 ists have been revived. Although these
 works are hardly innovative by Western
 standards, they have helped to enliven the
 drab Chinese cultural diet.
 There also has been a revival of folk art
 and culture. In February, a national fine
 arts exhibition featuring many
 traditional-style paintings, cartoons, and
 sculptures  opened in  Peking.  Tibet
 celebrated the new year with programs on
 Tibetan folk art. Such presentations had
 been taboo in China since the Cultural
 Revolution.
 Revivals of cultural works are also be-
 ing discussed in a more touchy
 area--Chinese literature written before
 the Communists came to power in 1949.
 Altho lgh many of these works are still
 unavailable, Chinese students in at least
 one university reportedly have asked for
 novel. written by "progressive writers" of
 the   930s.  At  Futan University in
 Shanghai, students have put up posters
 demanding broader courses in literature.
 Finally, there has been a greater
 openness to foreign literature, music, and
 art. For the first time in several years
 Electronics class in Swatow, Kwangtung Province
 Western music can be heard in China.
 During a recent visit, the Canadian Brass
 Quintet played works by Beethoven and
 won a "tumultuous ovation." More sur-
 prisingly, China's Central Philharmonic
 Orchestra commemorated the anniver-
 sary of Beethoven's death by playing his
 Fifth Symphony. In April, the Stuttgart
 Chamber Orchestra performed works by
 Bach,   Mozart,   Gluck,   and
 Pachelbel-composers who, with
 Beethoven, were until recently condemned
 as products of bourgeois culture.
 Chinese media have praised the
 literature and art of ancient Greece, the
 Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the
 19th century, and recommended the
 works of Tolstoy, Chern.yshevsky, and
 Gorky. Study of these works, they have
 argued, could improve China's
 proletarian literature and art. The govern-
 ment recently took a step to make such
 works available by announcing that it is
 lifting  the  10-year-yid ban  on
 Shakespeare and publishing a new
 Chinese language edition of his works.
 There have even been hints that the
 Chinese might be ready to consider in-
 creasing  cultural                                                        exchanges  with the
 West. During a recent visit of the
 Shanghai Ballet to Paris, a Chinese of-
 ficial suggested that China might be will-
 ing to return "to the attitude of develop-
 ing cultural exchanges with other coun-
 tries."
 Although these revivals of Chinese and
 foreign literature and art have enlivened
 the Chinese cultural scene, they have not
 produced a cultural renaissance nor even
 a Soviet-style "thaw." There have been
 few, if any, signs that the government is
 encouraging new and original works of
 art. No innovative films have appeared,
 no new, nonpolitical works of literature
 have been written, and no original music
 has been composed. Recent editions of
 poetry  and  literature journals have
 featured not works of creative imagina-
 tion, but politically motivated tracts.
 There have been some signs that this is
 all the government wants-that there are
 limits to debate and cultural flowering
 beyond which it is unwilling to go. Last
 month, for instance, an article in People's
 Daily attacked the notion that authors
 should be free to write on any subject they
 please. Contemporary literature and art,
 it said, should deal only with those sub-
 jects that serve the revolution.
 In  1957, when "letting a hundred
 flowers  bloom"  was last a  national
 policy for literature and art, the Chinese
 interpreted the policy as permission not
 only to produce more original artistic
 works, but also to criticize the govern-
 ment and its policies-something the
 government certain) wants to keep from
 happening again.
