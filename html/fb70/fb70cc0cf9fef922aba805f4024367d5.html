 Communist China:  The Unsolved Mystery
 The origins of the troubled political situa-
 tion                in  Peking remain shrouded in  mystery.
 Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie's six-day visit-
 he arrived in Peking on 6 October-may cast some
 light into the corners. He reportedly was to meet
 Mao Tse-Tung on 6 October but has not yet done
 so.   The military air stand-down, the still un-
 explained crash of a Chinese aircraft deep within
 the borders of Mongolia, and the unprecedented
 cancellation of several traditional National Day
 activities all seem to be symptoms of political
 turmoil at the top. It seems certain that China's
 leadership has been plunged into an upheaval of
 the first magnitude, but the evidence is not con-
 clusive as to what set it in motion or when and
 how it is likely to be resolved.
 The most obvious sign of serious disarray is
 the  unprecedented  curtailment  of  the  tradi-
 tionally festive celebrations held in conjunction
 with National Day, 1 October. In addition to the
 decision to cancel the parade, after several weeks
 of preparation, diplomats in Peking were told at
 the last minute that the banquet normally hosted
 by Premier Chou En-lai on the eve of National
 Day would be replaced by an abbreviated recep-
 tion sponsored by the Foreign Ministry. As in the
 case of the parade, Chinese officials tried to ex-
 plain the move as just another "reform." The real
 purpose was probably to avoid the top-level turn-
 out a banquet would require. Furthermore, for
 the first time in many years the regime failed to
 publish an editorial on National Day. The deci-
 sion not to publish appears to have been made at
 the last minute and suggests that the leadership
 was unable to agree on even a bland statement.
 The continued absence from public view of
 nearly all military members of the politburo,
 while their civilian counterparts appear regularly,
 indicates that whatever the issue, the controversy
 which apparently now centers within the military
 establishment is unresolved. In particular, more
 attention is being focused on the status of Mao's
 designated heir, Lin Piao, who has not appeared
 in public since :early June. Peking has demon-
 strated considerable sensitivity to rumors that Lin
 is in poor health, and there are signs that the
 regime may be taking steps to crack down on
 such speculation at home.
 Other top military leaders who have been
 out of sight since the current round of troubles
 began are army chief of staff Huang Yung-sheng,
 air force commander Wu Fa-hsien, and navy po-
 litical commissar Li Tso-peng. All three had im-
 portant political roles during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion and almost certainly are heavily involved in
 the  present political  maneuvering. Squabbling
 among these military figures would very likely be
 intense should a sudden decline in Lin Piao's
 political or physical condition give rise to succes-
 sion questions.
 Another factor that could contribute to un-
 certainty in high military councils is the question
 of personnel assignments in certain politically
 important  regional  military  commands.  For
 example, the commander and the political com-
 missar of the Peking Military Region, both of
 whom held concurrent posts in the civil govern-
 ment structure, apparently were removed late last
 year. Thus far, there is no firm evidence that
 replacements have been named for them. This
 suggests that the question has been the subject of
 considerable debate within the leadership councils
 at the center.
 The current status of Hsu Shih-yu, an im-
 portant regional military figure in east China, is
 also uncertain. Hsu has been out of sight since 6
 June, and a recent provincial broadcast revealed
 that another man may have moved into Hsu's
 post as commander of the Nanking Military
 Region. Any change of this magnitude would

 almost certainly be connect;d with the unset,led
 situation in Peking.
 Although some elements of the Chinese
 populace have been told that the present crisis
 atmosphere  derives  from  Soviet  "pressures,"
 neither Peking nor Moscow has stepped up public
 polemics since early September. The long-drawn-
 out Sino-Soviet talks in Peking are apparently
 continuing in routine fashion.
 Whatever the motivation and significance,
 developments since mid-September seem to be a
 new and more critical manifestation of the power
 struggle  within  China's  ruling  politburo that
 emerged from the ninth party congress in April
 1969.  The    deep-seated  personal rivalries and
 policy disputes that surfaced during the Cultural
 Revolution probably continue to be the major
 ingredients in the crisis, although it is uncertain
 what brought it to a head now and who the
 primary adversaries are. The possibility is not
 excluded that a succession struggle has been pre-
 cipitated by a dramatic change in the physical or
 political status of either Mao or Lin.i

 Cambodia: Taking Stock
 The Cambodians do have some things to
 cheer about despite the government's wary deci-
 sion to call off celebrations marking the first
 anniversary of the founding of the Khmer Repub-
 lic on 9 October. Not only has the regime stood
 up to Communist military pressure, substantial
 economic dislocation, and increased political dis-
 content, but it has also made the difficult psycho-
 logical adjustment to the prospect of a long and
 difficult war.  Assuming that the Communists
 stick to their low-cost strategy in Cambodia, the
 government's most difficult task in the coming
 months may be to maintain its political cohesion
 and stability.
 As the dry season approaches, the leader-
 ship's determination to resist the Communists on
 the battlefield has been strengthened by the
 army's improved showing in the past few months.
 Although the army is still heavily dependent on
 allied air strikes and on elite Khmer Krom units,
 there is evidence that the training and experience
 Cambodian officers and men have gained over the
 past year have begun to pay off.
 The army's Chenla II operation to open
 Route 6 to Kompong Thom town has made slow
 but steady progress since it was launched on 20
 August and it reportedly achieved its objective
 early in the week. Although the Communists have
 offered little resistance, Cambodian planning, co-
 ordination, and logistic support has been far more
 professional than during the operation to clear
 the same highway just a year ago. Smaller govern-
 ment sweep operations during the rainy season
 along other main roadways-while less impressive
 than Chenla II-have also reflected growing mili-
 tary confidence and a corresponding willingness
 to take the war to the enemy.
 On the economic front, the net is showing
 signs of stability following the drastic deprecia-
 tion in early  summer. Prices of foodstuffs and
 locally manufactured goods in Phnom Penh have
 also dropped, and the capital's stocks of rice are
 being maintained by regular government truck
 convoys from the northwest. Although prospects
 for the forthcoming rice harvest are less grim due
 to a late season surge of planting, some rice may
 have to be imported in 1972.
 The government is pushing ahead with a
 comprehensive program of fiscal and monetary
 reforms designed to reduce the enormous budget
 deficit and to halt the steady deterioration of the
 country's economic position. The regime is con-
 tinuing to seek international participation in an
 exchange support fund-the key element of its
 reform program even though initial reactions by
 prospective donors have been discouraging.
 Though the short-term military and eco-
 nomic outlook seems somewhat brighter right
 now,  the  prospects  for  political  stability in
 Phnom Penh are ci;ouded. Despite warnings from
 his doctors, Lon Nol is now working a full day.
 This not only fans renewed concern over his
 health, but it irritates many officials. The disturb-
 ing fact remains that there is no potential succes-
 sor on the horizon who can command the respect
 and  support-particularly within the military-
 that he enjoys.
 For the moment, given the lack of any or-
 ganized effective civilian opposition and the poor
 chances for holding elections, it appears that the
 self-effacing but politically dominant military es-
 tablishment will retain its strong influence over
 Lon Nol and will encourage his predilections for
 resorting to more authoritarian means of govern-
 ing. The prime minister's recent dismissal of In
 Tam and his reluctance to renew the National
 Assembly's mandate have served to underscore an
 evolving polarization between Cambodia's mili-
 tary and civilian elites.

 Indochina
 South Vietnam: Return to Normalcy?
 The South Vietnamese political climate may
 be somewhat calmer now that the presidential
 election is over. It could be that the country's
 major political forces will decide to take a
 breather and a few soundings before deciding
 what to do next. Vice President Ky has indicated
 that he hopes for prolonged agitation by radical
 student and veterans' groups. But he failed in his
 attempts to stir up large-scale antigovernment
 demonstrations at election time, and his prospects
 do not appear any brighter now.
 The An Quang Buddhists, the opposition
 group most capable of causing major trouble,
 began to take a harsher position against President
 Thieu in the final days before the election. Now,
 An Quang is backing an opposition committee set
 up to plan a long-term cam-
 paign against the government.
 Despite the use of more stri-
 dent language, the Buddhists
 probably will continue to
 move cautiously to avoid pro-
 voking the government into
 taking repressive measures.
 Thieu is pointing to the
 election returns as a vote of
 confidence. According to gov-
 ernment figures, more than 87
 percent  of  the  country's
 registered voters went to the
 polls and over 94 percent of
 these cast their ballots for
 Thieu. It seems likely that of-
 ficials in some provinces may
 have padded the figures, at
 least on voter turnout. The
 claimed turnout was greater
 than the 84 percent voting in the 1967 presi-
 dential contest. This seems high in view of the
 calls by the Buddhists and others for a boycott.
 Nevertheless, it is apparent that political agitation
 by radical students and veterans aimed at disrupt-
 ing the election process was generally ineffective.
 The  Communists'  antielection  campaign,
 largely mortar, rocket, and terrorist attacks, was
 also ineffective. 'There were numerous shellings,
 but the over-all impact was small; only light cas-
 ualties and damage were inflicted. There were
 only a few instances where the Communists ac-
 tually tried to bloc voting by direct attacks on
 polling places.
 In the wake of Thieu's heavy-handed tactics
 and the consequent one-man race, political ele-
 ments of all persuasions will be watching closely
 to see whether Ky and other militant opposition
 leaders have any staying power. For his part,

 Thieu seems fairly confident that he can ride out
 the furor among the urban political elites and that
 he will be able to defuse the opposition generally.
 The President reportedly hopes to get Ky out of
 his hair by sending the vice president on an over-
 seas assignment after Ky's term expires.
 With a new Lower House just elected, Presi-
 dent Thieu faces a number of immediate practical
 problems in the weeks to come. The fall session
 of the National Assembly convened this week,
 and the President is likely to face a larger and
 more vigorous opposition in the legislature than
 he has in the past. He probably will be able to
 gain approval for most of his requests, but he may
 have a tougher time. A major economic reform
 package that the government plans to implement
 in the near future could also cause political
 difficulties. The reforms are designed largely to
 stimulate economic growth and increase gov-
 ernment  revenues,  but they could create in-
 flationary pressures. If they should trigger price
 rises, the government islikely to come in for harsh
 criticism again, as it did following some past re-
 forms.
 South Vietnamese forces, aided by heavy air
 and artillery support, have reportedly inflicted
 severe losses on the Communists east of Krek
 during the week. The 174th Regiment of the
 Communist 5th Division, which was involved in
 the Krek action, has now withdrawn to the east.
 The results of this action by the South Viet-
 namese against the enemy division that hurt them
 badly at Snoul last spring will help restore the
 morale and fighting spirit of the South Viet-
 namese. They fought well and without the assist-
 ance of US ground forces.
 Nevertheless, the Communist forces-one in-

 Military  action  has been relatively light

 take stock before the dry season begins. North
 and northeast of the Plaine, pilots continue to
 report increased Communist activity that pre-
 sumably is related to North Vietnamese efforts to
 redeploy and resupply units in this area.
 Farther south in the Paksong area on the
 Bolovens Plateau, the principal concentration of
 Communist forces appears to be north of the
 town, and enemy-initiated activity has increased
 there in the last few days. Irregular units sweeping
 south and west of Paksong continue to clash with
 small North Vietnamese units, indicating that this
 area is still far from secure. Poor weather has
 hampered air support for government units
 around Paksong. This has given the North Viet-
 South Korea: Party Woes as O Goes
 The National Assembly censured Home Min-
 ister 0 Chi-song late last week and brought to the
 surface deep-seated factionalism within the gov-
 ernment's Democratic Republican Party, seriously
 embarrassing President Pak. In the censure vote,
 some 25 DRP legislators broke ranks against Pak's
 orders and joined the opposition. The move
 against 0 was really aimed at Prime Minister Kim
 Chong-pil, a close political ally. The prime minis-
 ter had reportedly benefited from the home min-
 ister's appointments in the Korean National Po-
 lice made at the expense of anti-Kim elements in
 the hierarchy.
 The break in party discipline took Pak by
 surprise. It also presented him with a difficult
 choice-either take action against the anti-Kim
 forces, which he organized to serve as a check on
 the ambitious prime minister, or let them off and

 namese an opportunity to regroup and resupply
 their forces.
 Government forces  in  Paksong and  Lao
 Ngam north of the plateau have been reduced by
 seven irregular battalions. Only 14 battalions, plus
 a few support companies and an artillery battery,
 are left in the area. Three battalions were sent
 back from Paksong to their home base in Military
 Region 3, presumably for rest and refitting before
 the beginning of dry-season activity in that area.
 A four-battalion irregular task force in the Lao
 Ngam area was withdrawn because of morale
 problems and desertions. So far, only four com-
 panies of neutralists have been sent to replace this
 force, although other neutralist units will be dis-
 patched if command problems and the troops'
 reluctance to leave safer areas can be overcome.
 The over-all reduction of forces in Military Re-
 gion 4 will reduce the government's ability to
 consolidate its position and to keep nearby en-
 emy units off balance.
 thus appear to fail in his support of Kim. Pak's
 response thus far has been an attempt to support
 Kim and yet not decimate the prime minister's
 political opposition. Party elements supporting
 Kim engineered the mass resignation of the execu-
 tive committee on 4 October, providing Pak with
 an opportunity to take action. He has accepted
 the resignations of four leaders of the anti-Kim
 faction but has replaced them with a group only
 slightly less hostile to the prime minister.
 25X1
 Pak will probably be reluctant to take any
 further action against the anti-Kim faction but
 may still face additional difficulties.

 EUROPE
 Russian Globetrotters in Asia and Africa
 Moscow's peripatetic leaders began in earn-
 est this week their campaign to offset Peking's
 increased  stature.  President  Podgorny was in
 southern Asia and Premier Kosygin in North Af-
 rica. Podgorny was given the unusual honor of a
 personal send-off by party leader Brezhnev, a
 gesture not repeated later in the week when Kosy-
 gin took off.
 The most important stop on Podgorny's
 itinerary is clearly Hanoi, where he arrived on 3
 October. To lay the groundwork for a successful
 visit, the Soviets took belated notice of the recent
 US bombing raids over North Vietnam. Tass on 1
 October strongly condemned the attacks and reit-
 erated Soviet support for Hanoi. Podgorny took
 along fellow politburo member Mazurov and a
 host of senior officials from the party, military,
 Foreign Ministry, and aid and trade departments.
 His remarks on Moscow's desire to improve
 relations with the Chinese notwithstanding, Pod-
 gorny is clearly intent on reaping whatever gains
 he can at the expense of Peking in the wake of
 the recent movement in Sino-US relations. In the
 wake of special Chinese efforts to ease the strain

 in Sino-Vietnamese relations resulting from this
 movement, Hanoi has curtailed its open polemics,
 but the North Vietnamese are probably especially
 anxious to keep relations with Moscow in good
 repair of this crucial time. The rhetoric out of
 Hanoi is effusive. The Soviets are stressing the
 continuity and reliability of their support, and
 the Vietnamese are expressing gratitude for past
 and present Soviet assistance and are restating
 their resolve to continue the struggle to the end.
 On his way to Hanoi, Podgorny made what
 is becoming the customary stopover in  New
 Delhi. His remarks there regarding the situation in
 East Pakistan cannot have been satisfying to the
 Indians. Podgorny was milder in his criticism of
 the West Pakistanis and firmer on the necessity of
 avoiding  war  than  was  Kosygin during Mrs.
 Gandhi's visit to the USSR last week.
 Podgorny also stopped off briefly in Ran-
 goon, doubtless hoping to apply cold water to the
 recent warming in relations between Burma and
 China. He implied that additional Soviet assist-
 ance would be provided to further encourage the
 Burmese along their path to a "socialist democ-
 racy."
 Kosygin in North Africa
 Kosygin is due to arrive in Morocco on 8
 October after a four-day visit to Algeria. His
 itinerary is identical to that of Podgorny's visit to
 north Africa in 1969. Podgorny accomplished a
 variety of ceremonial  purposes but failed to
 bridge the political differences between Moscow
 and the Maghreb. Kosygin is expected to have
 similar results.
 The initiative for Kosygin's visit to Algeria
 apparently came from the Soviets who, judging
 by the make-up of the delegation, wanted to talk
 about economic and trade relations. These have
 been strained over the past few years; the Al-
 gerians have been slow to draw on Soviet eco-
 Premier Kosygin
 nomic credits and have shown a marked prefer-
 ence for Western equipment and expertise.
 Kosygin probably made some effort to bring
 the two states closer together on contentious po-
 litical  issues.  Boumediene  has  regularly  de-
 nounced the Soviets for their support of the
 Arab-Israeli cease-fire and has demanded the de-
 parture  of  all  foreign--including Soviet-naval
 forces from the Mediterranean.
 Whatever the political results of the Kosygin
 visits, he will have dramatized once again Mos-
 cow's interest  in the western Mediterranean.
 Neither Algiers nor Rabat is prepared to permit
 Soviet influence over its policies, but both seem
 willing to accept broader relations with the So-
 viets. F_            I              25X1

 Mixed Results at Geneva Disarmament Talks
 The 25-nation  arms  control  conference in
 Geneva adjourned for the year last week, having
 decided on the final day to endorse the US-Soviet
 draft convention curbing biological weapons. The
 superpowers, however, may encounter considerable
 criticism in the UN General Assembly this fall over
 the failure to make more progress toward a compre-
 hensive ban on nuclear testing.
 Agreement on the convention was the only
 substantive accord reached at Geneva this year. A
 key factor in the negotiations was the Soviet deci-
 sion last spring to back away from insistence that
 any agreement would have to include chemical
 weapons as well as biological. The nonaligned bloc
 of 12 states also backed away from including chemi-
 cal weapons when the US convinced them that pro-
 hibition of chemical weapons could not be verified
 adequately at present. The assembly is expected to
 accept the draft convention and open it for signa-
 ture by December.
 Discussion at Geneva this year on the test ban
 issue focused on verification problems, and a grow-
 ing number of participants seem to doubt that either
 the US or the USSR genuinely desires a comprehen-
 sive test ban. A nonaligned memorandum submitted
 UN-CANADA: The Canadian's long-promised initia-
 tive on peace-keeping is in the final stages of minis-
 terial coordination and may be presented next week.
 Preliminary indications are that it could pose prob-
 lems for the US.
 Details of the Canadian scheme are not yet
 available, but it apparently would give the key role
 in conducting peace-keeping missions to the military
 staff committee of the Security Council rather than
 to the secretary general. Such an arrangement would
 seem closer to the Soviet preference for strong coun-
 cil controls than to the US view that a secretary
 general must have latitude for at least the daily
 conduct of peace-keeping operations. There has
 been a recent drift toward the Soviet position
 on the eve of the Geneva adjournment calls on the
 superpowers to give "priority" attention to the sub-
 ject and to take "an active and constructive part" in
 negotiations. The principal proponents are expected
 to make a determined effort during the current
 assembly session to secure passage of a resolution
 similarly placing the burden for progress on the
 superpowers.
 Advocates maintain that a ban will serve to
 prevent erosion of support for the nonproliferation
 treaty and complement agreements reached in the
 strategic arms talks. Canada this year has been the
 most vociferous in seeking testing curbs, in large
 part out of concern over US plans for a high-yield
 underground detonation in the Aleutians soon.
 The Soviets have sparked some interest with a
 proposal that a world disarmament conference be
 convened as "a matter of expediency and urgency."
 Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko last week told the
 assembly that agreement on a date for the session
 should be reached before the end of 1972. He added
 that the world-wide conference should meet every
 two or three years as a semipermanent body that
 would not, however, infringe on the negotiations at
 Geneva.

 among the middle and smaller powers, who now
 regard a Western veto on the council to be as good a
 protection of their interests as the actions of a
 neutral secretary general once appeared.
 Canada is a leading member of the General
 Assembly's Committee of 33 on peace-keeping, and
 its suggestions will probably be welcomed by most
 of the other members. The initiative will at the least
 require considerable study and thus serve to prolong
 the committee mandate, due to expire this fall. The
 Canadians have told the US they will oppose discus-
 sion of partial measures, such as the creation of a
 roster of units earmarked for UN peace-keeping, as
 detracting  from  consideration  of  their  pro-
 posal.

 NATO: Renewed Interest in Defense Cooperation
 Bonn and London, spurred by the monetary
 crisis and by concern about US intentions regard-
 ing Europe, are reassessing the organization of
 West European defenses. One result may be
 greater stress on new programs of intra-European
 cooperation than on "burden-sharing."
 Within the last year, the members of the
 Eurogroup-the  European  caucus  in NATO-
 worked out at US urging the European Defense
 Improvement Program through which they would
 share a greater portion of NATO expenses. The
 program, although still not fully subscribed, is
 financing new aircraft shelters and helping to pay
 for the new NATO communications system. The
 group will meet once or twice before the NATO
 ministerial in December to assess the burden-shar-
 ing program and possibly reorient their efforts.
 Officials of the West German and British
 foreign offices have recently discussed a marked
 shift away from the burden-sharing approach.
 They agreed that the Eurogroup should become
 active in exploring ways to improve conventional
 defense capabilities through cooperative efforts.
 The Europeans are faced with a dilemma.
 They view US troop cuts as inevitable and believe
 it is more important than before that Europe
 ICELAND: In a shift of tactics, the center-left
 coalition in Reykjavik has arranged to open nego-
 tiations with the British next month over fishing
 rights in waters around Iceland. Current arrange-
 ments allow the UK and West Germany to fish
 outside a 12-mile limit. The primary aim of the
 government, which assumed power in July, is to
 extend the country's fishing limits to 50 miles, an
 issue on which it enjoys broad domestic support.
 contribute to the maintenance of a credible con-
 ventional defensive capability. They find them-
 selves limited, however, by constraints on military
 spending resulting from increasing demands for
 social expenditures and from pressures growing
 out of detente expectations. One solution they
 see is to make better use of their resources
 through cooperative efforts in such endeavors as
 weapons development and joint training pro-
 grams. And the fallout from the new US eco-
 nomic policy appears to be providing new im-
 petus in this direction.
 The French position, as odd-man-out in al-
 liance matters, remains a potentially serious lim-
 itation on defense cooperation. The French are
 also concerned about maintaining an adequate
 European defense, and a close adviser of the
 prime minister claimed recently that France is
 willing to undertake a greater share of the burden
 of free world defense in order to prevent with-
 drawal of US for-es. Paris has not said how it
 envisages doing so in conjunction with the other
 Europeans. The French have stayed out of Euro-
 group activities sc. far, and the other allies are
 unclear how far Paris will be willing to go toward
 joint programs even if these were less closely tied
 to the NATO framework.
 Originally intendirg to abrogate the UK and Ger-
 man agreements unilaterally, Reykjavik now ap-
 parently wishes to pursue tactics more defensible
 abroad and avoid being called before the Inter-
 national Court of Justice. The government has
 made no recent m wes on its other major foreign
 policy objective cf negotiating a withdrawal of

 International Economic Developments
 The consensus is that last week's International
 Monetary Fund meeting in Washington produced
 only a "first step" toward resolving the international
 financial crisis, and that negotiations will be long
 and arduous.
 The most optimistic comment thus far came
 from the Netherland's Finance Minister Nelissen,
 who believes that an early resolution can proceed
 without threat of further trade restrictions by any
 country. The comment from London likewise has
 been optimistic, and stems from what is viewed as
 greater US flexibility on the price of gold and re-
 moval of the import surcharge. French Finance
 Minister Giscard D'Estaing has stated it now seems
 possible, and perhaps likely, that "serious" negotia-
 tions will be undertaken before the end of the year.
 The French, like many others, remain convinced
 that the free market cannot be counted on to pro-
 duce an acceptable international currency alignment
 as advocated by the US. West German Finance
 Minister Schiller, although reiterating the impor-
 tance of a small dollar devaluation against gold, has
 endorsed the US proposal  for temporarily per-
 mitting major currencies to float freely. He fears,
 however, that the current situation will last longer
 than desirable.
 In related developments, the Common Market
 and Britain formally protested proposals by the US
 to exempt  imported capital goods from the invest-
 ment tax credit and defer taxes on US export earn-
 ings. The protest note warned that such measures
 are discriminatory and could result in retaliatory
 actions.
 To dampen further appreciation of the pound
 by stemming the inflow of foreign currencies, Lon-
 don has imposed additional restrictions on foreign
 holdings of certain UK securities. Following an-
 nouncement of the new ban, the pound dropped
 from 3.8 percent above par to 3.5 percent.
 Rumors of yen revaluation continue in Japan,
 but Tokyo appears to be waiting for moves by the
 US and Western Europe before doing so. In the
 interim, Tokyo apparently has decided to relax
 somewhat the bounds on its controlled float. This
 week, the value of the yen moved 8.6 percent higher
 than the old official rate after the Bank of Japan
 considerably reduced its intervention in the foreign
 exchange market.
 The Japan Economic Research Center, a highly
 respected independent research agency, last week
 published an 18-month economic forecast that as-
 sumed a 14.3-percent increase in the value of the
 yen relative to the dollar and removal of the US
 import surcharge prior to the end of 1971. Its
 prognosis is considerably more optimistic than other
 recent Japanese forecasts and sees the major impact
 of revaluation concentrated in the first quarter of
 1972 with the economy rebounding to a rate of real
 GNP growth in excess of ten  ercent durin  the
 fiscal year that begins 1 April.
 EC Concerned about Agriculture
 Largely because of present monetary arrange-
 ments, farm policy is again a major concern within
 the European Community. Last week, the agricul-
 tural ministers of the Six debated the consequences
 if exchange rates continue to float within the Com-
 mon Market. It became clear that safeguarding the
 agricultural system-the most integrated area in the
 community-will not be easy until considerable
 progress is made toward monetary union.
 The ministers agreed with the commission
 that, although no significant disruptions of trade
 have occurred thus far, fixed exchange rates within
 the community are necessary to assure the smooth

 operation of the Common Agricultural Policy. Since
 Bonn and The Hague floated their currencies in early
 May, compensatory import levies and export sub-
 sidies were introduced to offset the reduction in
 farm prices that the floats would otherwise entail in
 these countries. This system has become less man-
 ageable now that, in the wake of the US actions,
 there are three different prices within the market for
 each farm product. Moreover, compensatory meas-
 ures always lag behind exchange rate changes upon
 which they are based. Continuation of this situation
 could induce greater reliance on national farm mar-
 kets to the detriment of trade, and on other national
 measures incompatible with the Common Agricul-
 tural Policy.
 A return to fixed parities poses serious prob-
 lems, since the new exchange rates will differ from
 the ones at which the common prices were de-
 termined. Three solutions are possible. Farmers los-
 ing out because of lower prices could be granted
 income compensation. The European unit of ac-
 count-in which the common prices are expressed-
 could be adjusted. Or the present system of com-
 pensatory subsidies and levies could be maintained.
 Germany objects to the first two, claiming they
 would involve heavy budgetary outlays; Bonn wants
 to maintain the compensatory system even after
 new parities are fixed, despite charges that this
 would lead to isolation of the German market and
 constitutes a "sabotage" of the Common Agricul-
 tural Policy.
 Eventually, a solution to the agricultural prob-
 lem-probably involving a new value for the unit of
 account and progress toward monetary union-may
 have to be sought at the highest political level,
 possibly at a summit meeting in early 1972.
 In the meantime, the community is unable to
 decide on agricultural prices for 1972-73 or to make
 much progress on the agricultural reform proposals
 the commission had hoped to push through with the
 price increases. Moreover, delay in setting the new
 prices probably means that they will ultimately be
 set at higher levels than the original three-percent
 average increase the commission had suggested. This
 could

 pose a further threat to US agricultural ex-

 in  record amounts this year.

 Further Erosion likely in East-West Trade Controls
 The COCOM states (NATO members, less Ice-
 land and Portugal, plus Japan) meet later this month
 to consider the levels of control on trade with Com-
 munist states. Like the last time the list was re-
 viewed, the US will be fighting a holding action to
 limit the degree of relaxation of the controls.
 on components, instrumentation, and technology in
 these areas. Britain and France have made the most
 requests, followed by the Italians. In some cases,
 COCOM members have taken unilateral action, in-
 forming the organization only after a deal is put
 through.
 The re-examination occurs against a distinctly
 unfavorable background. In 1968-69, a number of
 controls on exports to the USSR and Eastern Eu-
 rope were relaxed, although more severe restrictions
 on exports to Communist China were maintained.
 Japan, for one, has indicated that it will no longer
 accept this China differential. Since the earlier re-
 view, the number of applications for exceptions-
 relatively small  until  that time-has  increased
 sharply. Virtually all have been approved, and the
 value of such exports rose from $40 million in 1969
 to $106 million last year.
 The exceptions requested have concentrated on
 advanced electronics, such as computer and tele-
 communications systems. The requests have focused
 The basic problem confronting the US is that
 the increase in exception requests includes equip-
 ment with capabilities far above those covered under
 COCOM cut-offs as well as technology having both
 military and civilian uses. In both instances, COCOM
 rules call for negotiations in which the US typically
 finds itself in the minority.
 Up till now, other COCOM members have gen-
 erally gone along with the US in priority situations
 in return for US willingness to compromise on less
 critical matters. This gives reason to hope that effec-
 tive controls probably will be maintained over tech-
 nology and equipment having important military
 and strategic applications.
 Spain: Elections Improve Government Standing
 Candidates favored by the technocrat - opus
 Dei faction that dominates the cabinet won a major-
 ity of the 104 contested seats in direct elections to
 the Cortes last week, although the official tally is
 not complete. The Opus Dei group is expected to
 improve its position still more in the indirect elec-
 tions to be held this month to fill most of the
 remaining 452 seats in the Cortes.
 Although  the  Cortes  has  severely  limited
 powers, the renewal of its membership every four
 years is an important bellwether of the strength of
 the several political factions that support the Franco
 regime. The previous Cortes was dominated by rival
 Falangist (strict authoritarian) and syndicalist (offi-
 cial labor organization) factions. The additional sup-
 port that the Opus Dei faction is expected to pick
 up in the month-long selection process will give it a
 majority in the new Cortes. With this majority, the
 government can permit the Cortes to exercise a
 more independent legislative role. The government
 will also be able to control selection of the Cortes
 representation in the Council of the Realm, an ad-
 visory body that will participate in the selection of a
 prime minister when Franco decides to give up the
 post. The prospects will therefore be enhanced that
 the present cabinet will play a significant role in the
 post-Franco government.
 Voting in the direct elections was light, around
 55 percent of the 17 million eligibles. This was close
 to the participation in 1967, the first time direct
 elections to the Cartes had been permitted since
 Franco came to power. Voter apathy reflected the
 government controls over the election. The cam-
 paign was limited to 15 days, candidates were not
 allowed to use radio and television, and a large
 number  of  candidates  were  government

 The illegal opposition groups canvassed the
 possibilities of presenting a slate of candidates

 UN: The Deficit Issue Is Revived
 The Soviets and the French have offered to
 make voluntary contributions toward meeting the
 UN's huge deficit, which largely stems from their
 refusal  to  honor assessments for UN peace-
 keeping operations in the Congo (K) during the
 early 1960s. Their bids, however, appear inade-
 quate and hedged with unpalatable conditions.
 Ambassador Malik said at a private Big Four
 meeting on 1 October that Moscow would make
 its donation only if the US provided something
 and announced the amount of its contribution.
 He further qualified his remarks by maintaining
 that the USSR's contribution would only be
 against the $31.9 million determined by a General
 Assembly committee  in  1965-just after the
 Congo (K) operations ceased-to be the minimum
 deficit then current. He declined any interest in

 ably not a great factor in the mediocre turnout.

 on their own were re-elected. In addition, the

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The Arab World
 Setting Up Shop
 The leaders of Egypt, Syria, and Libya met
 in Cairo this week at the first session of the
 Confederation of Arab States presidential council.
 During the three-day conclave, they began to set
 up the confederation's structure and consulted on
 other political and military matters.
 The first order of business was to elect a
 council chairman to serve as president of the
 confederation-a  largely ceremonial  post.  The
 selection of Sadat surprised no one. It had been
 expected that the chairmanship would rotate be-
 tween Sadat, Asacl, and Qadhafi in that order.
 The confederal constitution does specify, how-
 ever, that an incumbent's two-year term can be
 renewed. The presidential council, in which the
 confederation's power is concentrated, has no
 authority to impose policy on a member state.
 For the next two years, important questions must
 be decided unanimously, and each member is
 empowered to determine which issues are im-
 portant.
 The council then proceeded to select Cairo
 as the confederal capital, establish a headquarters
 in a suburb of Cairo, and discuss the formation of
 a cabinet and other bodies.

 The three also addressed Jordan-fedayeen re-
 lations in view of the inconclusive talks in Jidda
 late last month. Egyptian and Saudi mediators
 failed to persuade representatives of Jordan and
 the guerrillas even to paper over their differences.
 There was no indication of what steps, if any, the
 three heads of state intend to take on the issue,
 although Qadhafi has previously argued for sanc-
 tions against Jordan if King Husayn continued to
 balk at concluding a settlement with the feda-

 The Egyptians and the Israelis have reacted
 unfavorably to Secretary Roger's speech listing
 six areas of compromise needed for an interim
 settlement to reopen the Suez Canal. Tel Aviv's
 reaction was by far the more negative. Even the
 moderate papers say that the speech represents an
 "erosion" in the US stand and shows a trend
 toward "cumulative pressure" on Israel-which,
 they hasten to add, Israel can withstand. The
 Jerusalem Post called the proposals "a package
 largely made in Egypt," and the organ of the
 ruling Labor Party agreed that the speech sug-
 gested explicit support for the Egyptian position.
 One hard-line newspaper said the speech in effect
 particularly with its stand on Israeli withdrawal.
 The Lebanese Government has capitulated
 to public pressure and revoked a decree imposing
 a tariff on luxury goods. The capitulation attests
 to the viability of Lebanon's democracy, unique
 in the Arab world, and shows once again how
 difficult it is to bring about sorely needed eco-
 nomic and social reforms.
 The tariff was intended to encourage local
 industry and to finance development projects.

 Soviet Military Shipments to Egypt
 The current level of Soviet seaborne military
 deliveries suggests that the military establishment
 in Egypt is being maintained rather than built up,
 as was the case in 1970 and early 1971 when the
 air defense system was significantly expanded.
 Although deliveries in September appear to have
 declined well below this year's monthly average,
 monthly arrivals vary considerably and not too
 much can be read into it.
 About half of the seaborne military cargoes
 are not identified, but the mix of the remainder
 has changed somewhat this year compared with
 the first nine months of 1970. This year a greater
 share has consisted of fighter aircraft and heli-
 copters, primarily MIG-21 interceptors and MI-8
 helicopters, largely delivered earlier in the year.
 Shipments of surface-to-air missile equipment, a
 big factor in last year's deliveries, have repre-
 sented only a small portion of the total in 1971.
 The number of trucks observed, ranging from
 utility to specialized vehicles,  has increased
 markedly over 1970. This may reflect the delivery
 of advanced electronics and communications
 equipment that the Egyptians have been seeking
 to counter Israeli improvements in the same field.
 President Sadat is expected to discuss more
 military equipment during his upcoming visit to
 Moscow, and his requests are likely to focus on
 such  items as additional electronics counter-
 measure materiel. He may also bring up the
 chronic problem of inadequate spare parts that
 result in down time and frequently require
 emergency  deliveries.  In any case,  Egypt's
 primary defense problem continues to be the lack
 of trained personnel to man and maintain the

 Tunisia: Politicians Look to the Future
 The eighth congress of the Destourian Socialist
 Party, which convenes on 11 October, faces the
 need to prepare for a future without Habib Bour-
 guiba, the dynamic and Western-oriented President
 who has dominated Tunisian politics for nearly 40
 years. If his health permits, Bourguiba will appear at
 the congress to appeal for continued party unity,
 but for the most part he will remain in the wings
 and his subordinates will carry out his directives.
 Two interrelated problems will dominate the
 congress-decentralization of power and an orderly
 presidential succession. Guidelines were laid down
 by Bourguiba, 15 months ago when he named a
 superior commission to propose revisions to the
 Constitution and to prepare for the congress. At the
 time, he suggested that the authority of the cabinet
 and the National Assembly be increased and proce-
 dures for presidential succession reviewed.
 For the past decade, Bourguiba has balanced an
 unwillingness to share autocratic power with a deep
 desire to assure orderly succession. At his request,
 the constitution was amended in early 1970 to pro-
 vide that the prime minister would succeed in the
 event of the death or incapacitation of the presi-
 dent. Last fall, Bourguiba seemed to be having sec-
 ond thoughts about this arrangement, and the com-
 mission drafted a new amendment providing for the
 temporary accession of the president of the National
 Assembly and the election of a new president within
 a month. It is not known whether this new proposal
 will be submitted for approval, since the documents
 prepared for the study of delegates in advance of the
 congress have not been made public.
 Debate over these and other issues probably
 will be lively and may become bitter and divisive,
 reflecting the factionalism and personal antipathies
 that have rent the party along regional and ideo-
 logical lines. The structure that emerges from the
 congress will probably be similar to past hierarchies.
 It should, however, be more representative of the
 rank and file and provide a better opportunity for
 dialogue between local and regional units and na-
 India's Green Revolution: A Plus and Some Minuses
 New Delhi's drive since the mid-1960s toward
 self-sufficiency in food grains has seriously limited
 the production of industrial crops. Food grain pro-
 duction reached record levels this year, 21 percent
 higher than the 1964-65 bumper crop. But some of
 the gain comes at the expense of industrial crops,
 since scarce irrigated land has been shifted to more
 profitable food grains.
 The resulting decline in production of cotton,
 jute, and oilseeds has caused serious shortages of raw
 materials for major industries using these crops. This
 has resulted in significant price rises, a squeeze on
 industrial profits leading to business failures, short-
 ages of consumer goods, and losses of export earn-
 ings. Over-all industrial output increased by only five
 percent during 1969 and 1970 instead of the nine
 percent growth target.
 The cotton textile industry has suffered most.
 Short supplies of domestic cotton, combined with
 restrictive government policies, which include limit-
 ing imports of long-staple cotton needed by larger
 factories, has sharply raised raw cotton prices. The
 output of textiles has failed to meet domestic de-
 mand and per capita availability of cotton cloth has
 declined.
 The erratic domestic jute supply, together with
 limits on raw jute imports, export taxes, and restric-
 tion on investment in jute manufacturing, have re-
 sulted in a sharp decline in India's share of the world

 market. Fluctuations in the price and supply of
 jute manufactures have induced foreign con-
 sumers to shift to other sources or to synthetic
 substitutes.
 The price of oilseeds and their products has
 risen about 50 percent since mid-1968. The in-
 crease reflects not only lagging domestic produc-
 tion, but also increased domestic demand for
 edible oils as incomes have risen. Imports of oil
 substitutes such as tallow have increased, and
 exports of certain oilseed products have been
 restricted. Per capita consumption of edible oils is
 still at about the 1963-64 level.
 The slowdown in industrial crop production
 has not seriously affected India's balance of
 payments, mainly because of government import
 restrictions.  Despite the shortages described,
 imports of edible oils, cotton, and jute have de-
 clined since 1967-68.
 With all of India's arable land already under
 cultivation, accelerated industrial crop production
 can be achieved only by shifting land back from
 good grains or by improved yields. Clearly, the
 latter is the more promising option, as New Delhi
 is not likely to reduce significantly its incentive
 programs for food grains. The keys to higher
 yields  are adequate irrigation and the de-
 velopment of more productive techniques, in-
 cluding improved seeds. Progress in these areas
 will be slow, however, unless the government pro-
 vides new-and costly-incentives for industrial
 crop growers.
 Pakistan: East Side, West Side
 Islamabad's efforts to ease its troubles in
 East Pakistan are not making much headway. The
 US Embassy in Islamabad reported recently that
 the Mukti Bahini guerrillas are gradually stepping
 up their activities and may attempt to launch a
 major offensive later in the fall.
 According to the embassy, the government
 has failed to undercut popular support in East
 Pakistan for the guerrillas, especially in rural
 areas. The army continues to carry out reprisals
 against the population, and recent government
 measures, ostensibly designed to mollify the East
 Pakistanis but probably aimed primarily at reduc-
 ing international criticism of the government,
 have not made much of an impression on the
 people. Civil administration in the province is
 functioning very badly and in many areas is non-
 existent. In some districts the insurgents appear
 to have established parallel administrative struc-
 tures.
 In West Pakistan, on the other hand, the
 government continues to enjoy widespread sup-
 port. The strife in the east has not yet caused
 severe economic dislocations in the western prov-
 inces. The separatist elements that have long
 existed in several parts of the western wing re-
 main quiescent. Efforts by the regime to bring
 about unity among the various factions of the
 conservative Muslim League have floundered, and
 Z. A. Bhutto's leftist Pakistan People's Party re-
 mains unchallenged. However, the government ap-
 parently still hopes to strengthen rightist groups
 at the party's expense.
 Elections to fill vacant East Pakistani seats in
 the national assembly are scheduled for Decem-
 ber, and Bhutto's party-heretofore based entirely
 in West Pakistan--plans to participate. He hopes
 to emerge from the balloting with a majority of
 assembly seats and to form a national government
 shortly thereafter, Bhutto recently stated that he
 and his followers would wait at least until next
 January before resorting to more drastic measures
 to force a return to civilian government. By then,
 there is a strong chance that their expectations
 will have been thwarted by a poor showing by
 their party in the elections, by further slippage in
 Yahya's election timetable, or by government dis-
 inclination to turn the reins of power over to

 Guinea: Another Judgment Day
 A "peoples trial" of another large group of
 alleged traitors appears to be nearing an end, but
 this probably does not mean an end to the terror
 that has gripped Guinea for months. President Toure
 still feels insecure and continues to search for help
 in combating what he believes is a foreign-backed
 invasion threat.
 Last week, the various levels of Guinea's single
 political party began meetings to consider confes-
 sions broadcast over Radio Conakry. These con-
 claves are to forward recommendations on the dis-
 position of nearly 150 alleged traitors and "merce-
 naries." The date for final sentencing is uncertain.
 The procedure probably will follow closely that
 used last January when the National Assembly met
 as a "revolutionary tribunal," which condemned 91
 to death; 15 were subsequently hung publicly. Dur-
 ing September, the focus shifted slightly from high-
 level "traitors" to the activities of long-time resident
 foreigners engaged in business. The total number
 jailed since January is not precisely known, but
 probably is several times the 150 currently facing
 sentencing.
 Part of the game is to maintain pressure on the
 US, which, Toure is convinced, is in a position to
 block any new Portuguese attempt to overthrow
 him. Last month's batch of public confessions ad-
 vanced the charges of US involvement in Guinea's
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: Bangui is quiet
 again after demonstrations last week in support of
 President Bokassa's current effort to loosen Paris'
 financial controls. Mob violence against French na-
 tionals and property shook up the French commu-
 nity, which has calmed down considerably and
 largely returned to work; Paris appears to be taking
 the episode in stride. A US Embassy source has
 claimed that, while the demonstrations were going
 on Bokassa foiled a military coup attempt against
 him. So far, however, the President has not de-
 nounced or moved against any plotters nor insti-
 tuted extraordinary security precautions.
 domestic affairs a step further by specifying Ameri-
 can complicity in past attempts to assassinate Toure
 and to overthrow his government. Toure evidently
 intends to keep up these verbal attacks until Wash-
 ington shows its support in more concrete terms.
 Toure may have in mind such things as a favorable
 US response to a recently reiterated request for
 military aid.
 The USSR continues to exploit Toure's secu-
 rity fears and the West's difficulties in Guinea. Mos-
 cow's prompt response to Toure's pleas for help last
 November included a show of naval strength. Soviet
 warships arrived off Guinea in mid-December and
 two or three ships have remained in the area almost
 continuously, making occasional port calls. They
 were anchored in Conakry harbor from late August
 to 6 October.
 At the UN, the long-delayed report of the
 Security Council mission to Guinea was finally in-
 troduced on 29 September. Toure requested the
 mission last August to investigate an alleged immi-
 nent invasion threat. Its report contains no rec-
 ommendations, and it may not lead to a council
 resolution
 The demonstrations appear to have been staged
 to coincide with talks between Bokassa and a rep-
 resentative of the Paris-based Central Bank of
 Equatorial  Africa,  which  issues  the  republic's
 currency. Bokassa wants the bank's monetary con-
 trols and his country's share of its reserves trans-
 ferred to Bangui and the currency revalued. Apart
 from  nationalistic  reasons,  Bokassa  probably is
 motivated by his perennial quest for read   cash to
 meet current ex enses.

 Peru: Velasco Takes to the Provinces
 In his first major trip outside Lima in tUNC
 ilu
 three years since assuming  power, President
 Velasco last week made a swing through the
 southern part of Peru. He wanted to impress the
 peasants and others in the south with the aims of
 the revolutionary government and gain additional
 support in this part of the country.
 President Velasco's speeches, especially the
 one in Arequipa on the anniversary of the coup,
 overflowed with nationalistic rhetoric. He praised
 his government's agrarian reform program and, in
 the plaza where an Inca descendant was executed
 in the eighteenth century, proclaimed, "The land
 belongs to whoever works it, so this land is
 yours." The President hastened to add that legal
 formalities must be respected. He defended his
 government's recent action against striking teach-
 ers, claiming that the teachers had been used by
 "antirevolutionary forces."
 President Velasco also handed out a few
 economic plums to the southern area. He author-
 ized construction of a road linking Cuzco to
 Machu Picchu, Peru's greatest tourist attraction.
 New hotels will be built in both places, taking
 advantage    of incentives under the new tourism
 law. Another law establishes specific incentives
 for private  industries established outside the
 Lima/Callao area. The President also authorized
 investment by the Peruvian mining corporation in
 a copper concession south of Cuzco. These proj-
 ects should provide important economic stimulus
 to the entire Cuzco area.
 The Velasco government clearly is beginning
 to come up against problems in carrying through
 its programs after three years of revolutionary
 rhetoric, accompanied by initial reforms in some
 areas. In Arequipa, he admitted, "No revolution
 can be free of errors and shortcomings." His
 drumbeating in the south should give the govern-
 ment increased support and a little breathing
 space in that area.

 Argentine Military Shaken by Navy DiSCOUkODED
 Changes in the top navy command have added
 to military dissension and prompted rumors of more
 far-reaching changes. The navy has insisted that the
 sudden dismissal of five senior officers was an in-
 ternal problem, but speculation in the public me-
 dia-and even among many military officers-is that
 it poses a political crisis for the Lanusse government.
 The forced retirement of the navy chief of staff
 and the chief of naval operations and the removal of
 three other senior officers from their posts report-
 edly resulted from an attempt to force the removal
 Five additional admirals reportedly have
 requested early retirement in a demonstration of
 solidarity with the dismissed officers and in an ap-
 parent attempt to maintain the pressure on Gnavi
 and force his resignation from the navy and the
 three-man governing junta.
 The apparent deterioration of morale and unity
 in the armed forces is likely to sharpen the concern
 of senior officers who are already wary of Lanusse's
 political and economic policies. Thus, policies that
 appear divisive to the military, such as Lanusse's    25X1
 rapprochement with the Peronists, could begin to
 meet with strong opposition from the senior gen-
 erals on whom Lanusse relies for support.
 Brazilian Terrorists on the Defensive
 The last year has been a period of retrench-
 ment for the terrorists who face an increasingly
 efficient government campaign to suppress them.
 The last important surge of terrorist violence, in
 mid-1970, was capped by the kidnaping of the West
 German  ambassador.  The  subversives'  plans to
 launch a sustained campaign in November 1970 had
 to be abandoned after the death of terrorist leader
 Joaquim Camara Ferreira in October. The abduction
 of the Swiss ambassador in December appears to
 have been an isolated act and not part of a general
 campaign of urban violence. The substantial im-
 provement of the armed forces' techniques against
 rural groups was demonstrated last month in the
 tracking down and killing of renegade army Captain
 Carlos Lamarca.
 Although the tempo of activities in Rio de
 Janeiro and Sao Paulo has increased since May, the
 activity is of a much more limited nature than that
 executed during the high-water period of 1969 and
 1970. The recent operations consist largely of rob-
 beries, attacks on police and military vehicles, raids
 on government offices, and seizures of printing
 equipment. Many of the actions have been joint
 operations carried out by small teams from more
 than one group.
 The largest and best organized groups are the
 National Liberating Action and the 8 October Revo-
 lutionary Movement (MR-8), both of which have
 their roots in dissident factions that developed in
 the Brazilian Communist Party in 1967. These two

 groups have acted cautiously during the past year,
 and have been damaged less as a result. The third
 major terrorist organization-the Popular Revolu-
 tionary Vanguard-has suffered from the combined
 problems of general exhaustion and the loss of sev-
 eral key members. Lamarca's defection from the
 Vanguard last March was a symptom of its decline.
 Its strength had been based on conventional military
 skill and daring.
 The authorities have failed to follow up on
 many of their successes, giving the terrorist groups
 time to fall back and to recruit the few replacements
 they can use effectively. The number of active mem-
 bers of armed revolutionary groups probably does
 not exceed 100 within Brazil, and about as many in
 exile. No more than 1.000 persons, out of a popu-
 lation of 93 million, have ever taken part in violent
 opposition to the government.
 The government has demonstrated that, while
 it is unable to eliminate armed terrorism, it has the
 ability to restrict such activities to essentially in-
 consequential skirmishes. It has been suggested that
 the security forces now are overplaying terrorist
 activities in order to justify the retention of extra-
 ordinary political controls. Leaders of the opposi-
 tion  party have already claimed that Lamarca's
 death removes the government's rationale for main-
 taining authoritarian controls in force. Spokesmen
 for the progovernment party, reflecting the view of
 the security forces, contend that the terrorists have
 retreated only long enough to re lenish their leader-
 sh ip.                                       25X1
 Guatemala Beset by Church and Students
 The Arana government's approach to the se-
 curity problem is under cautious attack from several
 quarters. It is extremely sensitive to criticism and
 may crack down hardest on its least favorite Guate-
 malan institution, the University of San Carlos. Only
 last week, the government expelled two foreign cler-
 gymen for interfering in Guatemalan affairs, and it
 has not been much less subtle in warning the do-
 mestic clergy. Silence by the government now might
 let the storm blow over, but there are signs that
 other elements unhappy with the high levels of
 violence-a good deal of which is caused by security
 operations-may  be  emboldened  to  speak their
 piece.
 Already irritated by pleas from their partisans
 to end the eleven-month-old state of siege, President
 Arana and the military have been meeting a prolifer-
 ation of similar protests. On 20 September several
 church officials, including Episcopalian Bishop Frey,
 a US citizen, released a document calling for an end
 to the systematic extermination of citizens and as-
 serting that the perennial violence in Guatemala is a
 symptom of moral depravation. It asked for the
 lifting of siege so that the law might operate demo-
 cratically. A few Catholic priests signed, but most
 Catholic officials passively dissociated themselves
 from the declaration. The top church official has
 now dissociated himself publicly after a personal
 warning from President Arana to keep the clergy out
 of politics. This warning to the church, however, did
 not deter university groups, opposition congress-
 men, and the bar association from publicly con-
 curring in the protest against violence.
 Coincidentally, the bad  blood between the
 largely leftist university and the government was
 also agitated on 20 September with the killing of a
 Communist professor. Several university faculties at
 San Carlos are now on strike, believing-correctly-
 that he died at government hands. Tension escalated
 with the government's kidnaping of another Com-
 munist professor, since released, and of a Commu-
 nist student, whose detention the government now

 Panama Prepares for Anniversary
 The government, having devoted consider-
 able time and effort to getting a large crowd into
 Panama City for the third anniversary of the
 Provisional Junta Government, is now concerned
 lest provocateurs cause anti-US incidents. Initial
 publicity had billed the 11 October rally as an
 opportunity for the people to demonstrate sup-
 port for the government's position on treaty ne-
 gotiations and had stressed the attainment of
 total sovereignty over the Canal Zone. More re-
 cently, however, the government has played down
 the sovereignty and treaty issues.
 Torrijos may focus instead on domestic is-
 sues and attempt to put the best face on the
 regime's rather limited accomplishments. He will
 undoubtedly make the now-ritual obeisance to
 labor and the peasantry. He may hold out the
 promise of higher wage rates and an intensifica-
 tion of the government's development efforts. He
 may announce an administrative rejuggling to in-
 crease government responsiveness to local prob-
 lems and may hint at future steps toward normali-
 zation of the political  process.  Dramatic an-
 nouncements heralding either bold revolutionary
 schemes or a quick return to constitutional gov-
 ernment are not in prospect. Torrijos, however, to
 demonstrate his independence from the US may
 announce publicly the establishment of diplo-
 matic relations with Romania.
 Security forces will be much in-evidence and
 even Panama City firemen will be pressed into
 service to keep the crowd, expected to reach
 100,000, under control. The government seems
 resolved to prevent violence and discourage incur-
 sions into the zone. Given the number of people
 expected and their proximity to the Canal Zone,
 the potential for trouble is high. Not all elements
 of the crowd will be friendly to the regime and
 some may seek to-embarrass Torrijos by creating
 disturbances. Some students,  moreover, might
 seek to win momentary glory by raising the Pana-
 manian flag in the zone.

 On 21 September 1971, the Year of the Iron Hog in Bhutan, the country was elected
 to membership in the UN. This secluded Himalayan kingdom, one of the world's smallest
 independent states, enters the international arena backed by a population of one million
 who live in a feudal manner not much different than was the case in the 17th century when
 Bhutan first became a distinct political entity. Since the mid-1960s, a small group of
 Bhutanese elite has aspired to UN membership in order to ensure international recognition
 of Bhutan's sovereignty and to hasten development of its backward economy.
 The country, almost totally dependent on India for economic and military assistance,
 is required by treaty to be "guided" by Indian advice in foreign affairs. New Delhi's interest
 in Bhutan rests heavily on the fact that Bhutan borders on the strategically sensitive Indian
 corridor that leads to isolated northeast India. New Delhi energetically endorsed the
 Bhutanese bid for a UN seat, and Bhutan is expected to vote with India on most issues.
 Peking appears content to see Bhutan develop further as a viable buffer state and has not
 pressed earlier territorial claims.

 The landlocked Himalayan kingdom, about
 19,000 square miles, is nearly the size of Vermont
 and New Hampshire combined. The majority of
 its population are Bhotias-Buddhists of Tibetan
 extraction. This group, which shares the basic
 features of Tibetan culture, dominates the govern-
 ment and the clergy. People of Nepalese origin
 and a number of small tribal groups are distinct
 minorities on the fringe of Bhutanese society.
 Much of the population lives in almost inacces-
 sible valleys largely untouched by the laws and
 activities of the government.
 Life is primitive, but, compared to much of
 the rest of Asia, living standards are relatively
 good. The Bhutanese are self-sufficient, meeting
 their basic needs by farming, livestock raising,
 cottage industries, and trade. The country has a
 good economic potential, but its vast forests have
 scarcely even been explored, and its mineral re-
 sources have not been tapped. Less than five
 percent of the population is literate, and basic
 elementary education is just beginning in a lim-
 ited number of government schools. Some 500
 Bhutanese attend secondary schools in India, but
 probably no more than a few hundred Bhutanese
 have ever traveled beyond India's borders. The
 kingdom's international affiliations, prior to ad-
 mission to the UN, were confined to membership
 in the Colombo Plan and the International Postal
 Union.
 The ruler of Bhutan is 43-year-old Jigme
 Dorji Wangchuk. The King (whose official title is
 Druk Gyalpo or Dragon King) succeeded to the
 throne in 1952, about 35 years after his grand-
 father centralized power in the Wangchuk family
 and became the first monarch of all Bhutan. The
 family is still in full control. There is no evidence
 of a serious challenge to the King's pre-eminence
 in both secular and religious affairs, but Bhuta-
 nese history is checkered with power struggles
 between  prominent  families.  The  anticipated

 increase  in  developmental  efforts could upset
 long-standing balances, and there has already been
 some evidence of dissension between tradition-
 alists, particularly within the monasteries, and
 more progressive elements favoring moderniza-
 tion. The King and Queen have lived apart since
 the mid-1960s when members of her influential
 family, the Dorjis, were involved in an unsuccess-
 ful conspiracy for enhanced power at the King's
 expense. The King's half-brother has since be-
 come his chief adviser, a post previously held by a
 Dorji.
 At present, political power is centralized in
 the monarchy and a small circle of court officials
 drawn from the monasteries and landed elite. The
 few reports emerging from Bhutan indicate that a
 rudimentary system of representative government
 is developing at a slow pace. In recent years, the
 King has taken steps to make the government
 more democratic, and his proclaimed goal is the
 establishment of a constitutional monarchy. A
 150-member legislature (the Tshogdu or National
 Assembly), consisting of elected village headmen
 and Buddhist lamas as well as royal appointees,
 has functioned since the mid-1950s. In 1968 the
 King set up a cabinet that now numbers five. The
 ministers belong to a larger Royal Advisory Coun-
 cil that makes recommendations to the King on
 economic and administrative matters. The King
 has introduced a number of reforms, including
 Bhutan's first law code. More recently, he set up a
 high court with the authority to hear appeals
 against judgments of district courts and adminis-
 trators. A potentially far-reaching innovation was
 added in 1969 when the King decided that his
 continuation should depend on his getting a two-
 thirds majority in a vote to be taken every three
 years in the National Assembly. Such a vote of
 confidence was taken last May, and the King won
 133 of the 137 votes cast. There are no political
 parties, but the King has not foreclosed the pos-
 sibility of their eventual creation.
 The King has not recently been incapaci-
 tated due to serious illness, as he was several times
 in the last decade, but his health is not considered

 robust. On his death, or in the highly unlikely
 event he were to be voted out of office, the
 throne would pass to the crown prince, who will
 be 16 in November. A four-man regency council
 will actually rule until the heir reaches his 21st
 birthday. The crown prince, who received his
 secondary education in England and is now being
 tutored in Bhutan, already has had a far more
 extensive exposure to the outside world than has
 his father.
 The Crucial Indo-Bhutanese Relationship
 India is the most important factor in Bhu-
 tan's development. New Delhi inherited Britain's
 relationship with the kingdom after Indian inde-
 pendence in 1947, and in 1949 a treaty of friend-
 ship marked India's formal succession to the role
 played by Britain. The treaty recognizes Bhutan's
 sovereignty but requires that the country "be
 guided by the advice" of India in its external
 relations.  The two countries apparently have
 reached an accord on the imprecise stipulation
 regarding foreign affairs, and neither claims a de-
 sire for treaty revision. Domestic matters remain
 in Bhutan's own hands.
 In the late 1960s, the Indian Government
 committed itself to sponsor Bhutan for member-
 ship in the UN at some unspecified date. Al-
 though progress toward this end probably pro-
 ceeded faster than New Delhi anticipated, the
 Indians responded to Bhutanese pressure with
 enthusiasm and good faith. The Indian UN dele-
 gation assisted Bhutanese officials who attended
 recent UN General Assembly sessions as unofficial
 observers, provided them with training in diplo-
 macy, and undertook a successful lobbying effort
 last winter to win Security Council approval for
 the Bhutanese bid.
 The Indians will underwrite most of the cost
 of maintaining a three-man Bhutanese delegation
 in New York and will, in effect, groom the dele-
 gates for their new role. In return, Bhutan can be
 expected to vote with India and the Afro-Asian
 group on most issues. Both are also very much

 interested  in  the  international recognition ac-
 corded Bhutan, establishing its separate identity.
 This is significant because the Bhutanese-Tibetan
 border is undemarcated; indeed, there is no evi-
 dence of any treaty that comprehensively defines
 the more than 200-mile border. Moreover, Bhutan
 borders on the strategically sensitive Indian cor-
 ridor that leads to the isolated northeast region.
 Indo-Bhutanese relations have become more
 extensive in concert with Bhutan's growing ability
 to absorb additional help, particularly in terms of
 economic aid and training. The kingdom is almost
 totally dependent on India for financing develop-
 mental programs. Bhutan's annual revenue, de-
 rived largely from taxes on land and its produce,
 amounts to only slightly over $1 million. Its for-
 eign exchange earnings total less than $100,000,
 mostly from the sale of postage stamps to col-
 lectors. New Delhi plans to contribute about $47
 million  to  Bhutan's  third  Five-Year  Plan
 (1971-76), a substantial increase over previous
 help. In addition, India is making sizable contri-
 butions for road construction and is responsible
 for building the first roads usable by four-wheel-
 drive vehicles. These join major settlements and
 connect the capital, Thimphu, with the Indian
 border.
 Hundreds of Indian technicians and advisers
 are assigned to Bhutan to work on numerous
 development projects. They are gradually being
 replaced as more Bhutanese acquire the necessary
 skills. The pervasive Indian presence arouses re-
 sentment among some Bhutanese officials, but
 the small number of trained Bhutanese makes the
 situation unavoidable.
 The Indo-Bhutanese Defense Arrangement
 Indian involvement in Bhutan's defense or-
 ganization is even more pronounced. In the late
 1950s and early 1960s, when Peking published
 maps claiming more than 300 square miles of
 northeastern Bhutan and spoke of "liberating"
 Bhutan  and  other  Himalayan  frontier  states

 Delhi  began  strengthening  Bhutan's  defenses.
 Several  months before the outbreak of Sino-
 Indian hostilities in October 1962, New Delhi
 established a military mission in Bhutan to train
 and reorganize Bhutan's defense forces. Now, of-
 ficers in the 6,000-man army receive basic train-
 ing under Indian direction at the military acad-
 emy at Ha Dzong in western Bhutan, and some
 officers are sent for additional training to military
 institutions in India. In addition to their training
 function, Indian officers serve with Bhutanese
 field  units, and India regularly rotates Indian
 Army units through Bhutan, sometimes conduct-
 ing joint exercises with the Bhutanese.
 Indian
 troops are believed still to man watch posts on
 the Tibetan-Bhutanese border, with special inter-
 est focused on the five strategic passes serving as
 potential invasion crossing points for an army
 moving from Tibet into India.
 Both the Bhutanese and Indians recognize
 that Bhutan could not by itself withstand Chinese
 incursions. Both seem to believe a close defense
 relationship enhances Bhutan's securit .               25X1
 there has been no
 recent indication of Chinese pressures on Bhu-
 tan's borders. It is likely that Chinese troops and
 Tibetan graziers occasionally wander across the
 open border by mistake.
 There has been, as far as is known, no recent
 official contact between Bhutan and Communist
 China. Sino-Bhutanese relations deteriorated fol-
 lowing the Tibetan uprising in 1959 and the with-
 drawal of the Bhutanese representative in Lhasa.
 There are no formal ties between the two nor any
 indication that the Bhutanese are planning to seek
 resumption of special political or trade relations
 with Tibet. Chinese troops continue to patrol the
 border region, but Peking has not pressed its
 former boundary claims. A Bhutanese official re-
 cently declared that in 1970 the Chinese pub-
 lished maps of the border that seemed to indicate

 Peking's acceptance of 'Bhutan's version of the
 border.
 In preparation for its debut at the UN, Bhu-
 tan established  its first permanent mission in
 India last May. The 48-year-old Perna Wangchuk,
 who had served as an assistant to the King and
 more recently as a liaison officer in the Indian
 road-building effort, was named Bhutan's "special
 representative"  in  India. In reciprocation, the
 ranking Indian official in Bhutan, B. D. Das, was
 accorded a similar title.
 For the near future, Bhutan does not plan to
 establish any missions in addition to its posts in
 New Delhi and New York. Designated as its UN
 permanent representative is 43-year-old Sangey
 Penjore, minister of communications and a dis-
 tant relative of the King. He has been in govern-
 ment administration since 1945 and was intri-
 cately  involved  in  the  steps  leading to UN
 membership. In his brief contacts with US offi-
 cials, Penjore has appeared friendly and intelli-
 gent. He is assisted by an Indian official, A. M.
 Ram, who is on loan from the Indian Foreign
 Ministry and had spent the previous three years as
 an adviser in Bhutan. The second secretary and
 head of chancery is Kingley Wangdi. Wangdi has
 dealt with foreign affairs in the National Assem-
 bly and served as observer at UN General Assem-
 bly sessions during the last three years.
 The US has no plans at present to open a
 post in Thimphu and will conduct its relations
 through the Bhutanese missions in New York and
 New Delhi. The US had already recognized Bhu-
 tan as a sovereign independent state.

 Furthermore, full membership was the only op-
 tion open as the UN has not yet devised a form of
 associate membership for "micro-states," such as
 Bhutan.
 There is a realization in Bhutan of the dan-
 ger of proceeding too fast in opening the coun-
 try's doors to the world. The King has taken
 specific measures to preserve Bhutan's heritage;
 for example, by insisting on the wearing of tradi-
 tional national dress and by the observance of
 ancient cultural traditions. Tourism may eventu-
 ally bring much needed foreign exchange, but
 today the country is accessible only to invited
 guests. In large part, this is due to the Indian
 Foreign Ministry, which has strict control over
 visas to Bhutan. In practice, this means that with
 few exceptions all but government officials, se-
 lected journalists, and the King's special guests are
 excluded. As Bhutan begins to flex its muscles, it
 probably will seek to assume added responsi-
 bilities in the field of foreign affairs. For the near
 future, however, the Indians and the Bhutanese
 will continue their cordial political, economic,
 and military relationship, especially their mutual
 obligations in the realms of defense and foreign
