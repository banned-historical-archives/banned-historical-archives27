 PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION IN THE
 PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 During a visit of a delegation representing the military academies of
 the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to the United States in the fall of 1980, the
 head of the delegation, Xiao Ke, Commander of the PLA Military Academy and Vice
 Minister of National Defense, informed his guests that the Military Academy was
 building new facilities.  He also observed that the ages of-the members of his
 delegation were quite old;  that they had not been able to retire because the
 devastation of military academies during the Cultural Revolution had made it
 impossible to properly train a generation of younger military leaders.  Commander
 Xiao's remarks  strike at the heart of the key issues for the PLA's professional
 military education for the 1980's: technical modernization and ideological change.
 Both issues continued to be highly controversial as the decade began..
 China's program for economic modernization has experienced dramatic revision and
 there has been political instability at the highest levels.  It is against this
 background that the professional military education system is expected to
 produce officers that are "politically conscious, professionally competent,
 1
 unyielding in work style and physically strong.."  This chapter will examine
 the structure and function of the Chinese professional military education
 system and examine the relationship of this education to the broader questions
 posed by modernization.
 The objective of professional military education in China cited above
 helps to distinguish it from concepts prevalent in the West.  While Western
 scholars have dwelt on the unique aspects of military professionalism, the
 Chinese Communist approach, owing both to Chinese tradition and the revolutionary
 2
 insurgency experience, ham generally downplayed its uniqueness.  This important
 dimension will be discussed in greater detail later, but it should be noted here

 as we establish a background for our discussion by briefly outlining the organiza-
 tion of the Chinese professional military education system.
 First of all, professional military education is pervasive in the PLA.
 At the apex are the three academies which correspond to the organization of the
 high command; the Military Academy (General Staff Department), Political Academy
 (General Political Department) and the Logistical Academy (General Rear Services
 Department).  All of these are located in Beijing.  Below these are service academies
 for the Navy and Air Force and specialized academies (e.g. the PLA Advanced Infantry
 Academy at Nanjing, Air Force Maintenance Academy) located in various parts of China.
 Little is known about the organization of the remainder of the military education
 system, however, it is quite clear from the prolific reports of various study and
 3
 indoctrination efforts in PLA units that the system is extensive.
 Secondly, the curriculum of the military education system has been
 undergoing rapid change.  The amount of time spent in studying "political"
 subjects has been reduced in favor of spending more time on "military" subjects.
 Military educators are concerned that the curriculum reflect the objective of
 military modernization.  Besides studying the Soviet tank offensive in Manchuria
 in 1945, they are desirous of giving more attention to subjects dealing with
 strategy and tactics in a nuclear environoment, the management of combined
 operations, and other aspects of modern warfare.
 Finally, the organization appears to be undergoing some revamping.  A
 conference on military academies in the fall of 1980 attended by China's top
 military leaders concluded that military educators.must "emancipate our thinking
 and boldly change the content of the training and education programs" in the
 4
 military education system.  Though the conference did not reveal precisely how
 the academies were to change to accomplish this objective'it did suggest that
 the teachers become more innovative.  Consequently, any attempt to analyze

 education
 the Chinese military/system must be subject to the caveat that it is undergoing
 change and will likely vary in structure and purpose as the PLA advances into
 the 1980's.
 Rather than focusing upon the institutions which are responsible for
 prfoessional military education, I have chosen to examine more closely the issues
 and problems with which military education must deal.  I believe military
 education is a microcasm'&f:Maty-_is-saes which are readily apparent in the other
 papers.   Inasmuch as military education is an important vehicle for the socializa-
 tion of military leaders, such issues as the relationship between ideological
 and technical values, the role of the military in society, and the pursuit of
 effective national strategy can be readily discerned in its content.  The
 Chinese are extremely aware of the relationship between military education and
 socialization, consequently military education can reveal much about how the
 Chinese leaders view these questions as well as how the military responds to
 them.  In the next few pages I will try to sketch out some of these issues.
 Military v. Civilian
 The selection of military v. civilian as a principle issue area no doubt
 requires some justification, particularly, since Chinese statements from the dawn
 of the revolutionary insurgency era have stressed the close relationship between
 the Army and the masses.  Moreover, because of the insurgent heritage and the
 overlap of Party and military responsibilities  in Chinese political institutions
 since 1949has not led to a sharp dichotomy between the military and other
 segments.  During the Cultural Revolution, the PLA became directly involved in
 political administration in many areas of China, yet it would be mistaken to say
 that the military had staged a coup.  Persons whose careers have been predominantly
 active
 in the military may well have constituted a majority of/Politburo membership in the

 late 1960's and early 1970's;  yet this high level of military involvement in
 political decision making was not akin to the seizure of power by the military that
 occurs in many developing countries.  The charge that Lin Biao was behind a
 "counterrevolutionary coup attempt" in 1971, given lengthy and detailed
 examination during the trial of his alleged co-conspirators in late 1980 and
 early 1981 suggests that the Chinese consider this kind of intervention to be
 particularly odious and repugnant.
 However, in recent times a military-civilian dichotomy has become
 more apparent.  Besides of reports of anti-PLA demonstrations on university
 campuses where troops remained in buildings, complaints of demobilized veterans
 of discriminatory treatment, and other evidence, recent editorials in the
 Liberation Army Daily indicate that a military-civilian cleavage has developed
 over other issues.  The military has been particularly discontent over agricultural
 reforms which discriminated against families with members in the armed forces
 by eliminating extra work points designed to compensate for the loss of able
 bodied workers (and, therefore, income).  A General Political Department
 Circular in October called for intensive efforts by the army to study the
 6
 party's leadership's rural policies.   Furthermore, an article in the army
 paper on November 20 declared that cadre adherence to the Party's political
 and ideological line is "the most fundamental yardstick" in PLA organizational
 work and warned that those who had spoken out or worked against the Party line
 should not be retained in leadership groups.
 Paradoxically, much of the reason for the civilian-military cleavage
 appears to stem from the modernization effort.  Official military spokesmen have
 insisted that the PLA genuine adheres to the principle that military modernization
 hinges on the other modernizations, yet there is some evidence that some disagree-
 ment has occurred over budgetary priorities.  Thus, while military leaders have

 stressed the importance of developing modern and advanced weapons, civilian
 leaders have placed great emphasis on staying within the budget;  official
 figures suggest that the military budget has actually been reduced.  But even----,
 more important than the issue of budget priorities is the question of professionalism,
 9
 a key theme of military education.
 According to Chinese conceptualizations, there have been two broad
 approaches to military professionalism.  The first may be referred to as the
 "Maoist" approach.  This approach was characterized by stressing the importance of
 men over machines and the suppression of uniqueness among the armed forces as an
 institution. This approach recognized the importance of the military in providing
 national defense, but also gave equal emphasis'to its role in society, the Army
 being a work force and a production force as well as a fighting force.  A close
 relationship between the army and the people was an important value, as was the
 exemplary nature of military personnel.
 The "Maoist" approach was most strongly articulated during the periods
 of the anti-Japanese war and Chinese civil war, and during the Cultural Revolution.
 It will be recalled that during much of the 1960's the entire country was supposed
 to "learn from the PTA" which had correctly embodied Mao's thought.  During these
 periods, military personnel not only were responsible for national defense, but
 for serving as models of such values as sacrifice, selflessness, diligence,
 perseverence, hard work, and other "revolutionary ideals."
 The Maoist approach to professionalism may be contrasted with the
 "Pengist" or "Dengist" approach which appears to be closer to Western concepts of
 military professionalism.  This approach stresses the uniqueness of the armed
 forces, its specialization, and its diversity from society.  In this approach
 the military stresses the importance of modernizing equipment, and of developing
 combat expertise over ideological training.  The military should concentrate more
 on providing national defense, and less on performing other social tasks.

 -6-
 This approach was particularly evident during the period of the 1950's
 when Peng Dehuai as Defense Minister followed the Soviet model in developing
 10
 professionalism among the Chinese armed forces.     More recently, this approach
 has been signalled since the death of Mao and the purge of the gang of four.  A
 host of conferences, reports and articles suggest that the drive for moderniza-
 tion is pushing the military toward the approach where "expert" takes precedence
 11
 over "red."     For example, a Red Flag article commemorating the 30th anniversary
 of the People's Republic of China in 1979 written by Defense Minister Xu Xianggien
 stressed the importance of expertise  and demanded that training in the armed
 forces be "geared to the needs of actual combat."
 Obviously, neither approach has been followed exclusively at any given
 time.  Also, both approach to military professionalism share common aspects.  Both
 acknowledge the importance of Party control of the armed forces;  both recognize
 that the principle role of the military is to provide national defense.  I would
 also argue that both accept the premise that the legitimacy of the armed forces
 is expressed in great measure through ideology.  That is, the basis for the
 effectiveness of the armed forces is primarily a correct political line.  Even
 those who stress "expertise" over "redness" do so by saying that "red" is
 defined by "expert."    Nevertheless, the distinctions are quite apparent.  The
 Maoist model abolishes ranks, while the "Perig st-Dengist" model encourages them.
 The "Maoist" approach says that military education should concentrate more
 on ideological study, while the "Pengist-Dengist approach wants more time spent
 on combat training.
 It has already been pointed out, that in the early 1980's 4-t_wa-s ea-r--
 th   the Pengist-Dengist approach is once again being favored.  This poses the
 question of whether or not the inclucation of this concept of professionalism
 will create a greater civilian-military cleavage.  As the military becomes
 increasingly unique and separate from society, will it not find that its interests

 --
 diverge greater from other institutions and sectors in Chinese society?  Given
 the tone and content of recent statements in the official army newspaper, Chinese
 leaders are greatly concerned about this potential.
 Consequently, China's present leaders believe that an important
 responsibility of military education will be to ensure the adherence of the
 military to Party leadership.  It is implicitly assumed that as the military
 becomes more "expert" it will become more distinct as an interest group and that
 the way to deal with this is to ensure Party control.  It is not surprising that
 the conference on military academies concluded that in the future:
 The most important thing is:  The cadres trained by military
 academies and instututions must have a firm and correct
 political orientation, firmly implement the party's line,
 principles and policies and resolutely obey the command of
 the party Central Committee and its Military Commission.13
 Strategy and Doctrine
 Strategy and doctrine are covered more completely in other chapters
 of this book, however, it is also important that they be examined in the
 context of professional military education.  The evolution of strategy and
 doctrine from "people's war" to "people's war under modern conditions"presumes
 that the rising generations of military leaders will be able to comprehend and
 apply the new concepts.  Yet, it is quite evident that the military education
 system is having some difficulties in adjusting its curriculum to explain the
 new concepts, perhaps because they are inherently not altogether clear.
 This was amply demonstrated during a visit to the PLA Military Academy
 when we were informed that the students were expected to master Marxism-Leninism
 and Mao's thought in analyzing and solving problems.  Military training also
 placed emphasis on Mao's teachings on war.  Now that the "thought of Mao" has
 been redefined to a culmination of the party's collective experience rather
 than merely the contributions of one individual1its all-inclusive nature may lend

 itself to proper study as providing some contribution on the nature of modern
 warfare. Nevertheless, there are probably also some pitfalls.  The leaders
 of the military academy seemed to give a good deal of credence to the possibility
 of a massive Soviet tank offensive against China, and pay special attention to
 the operations of the Soviet Army in Manchuria in 1945.  While recognizing that
 there are other possible 'oriet military options vis a vis China, they strongly
 emphasized the view that, for the Soviet Union, China was to great a problem to
 be handled by some kind of limited incursion or selective strike.
 Without debating the merits of the Chinese view, it does appear that
 the PLA leaders are reluctant to modify a strategic image which they have held
 for some time.  As others have pointed out, the deterrent value of "people's
 war" is of more limited utility in projecting foreign policy, as the "defensive
 counterattack" against Vietnam in 1979 has suggested. But in spite of the
 constant articles and statement calling for "people's war under modern conditions"
 there is apparently a bureaucratic tendency to cling to what is known!4 During
 our visit to the Military Academy we were told that the curriculum was undergoing
 revision so that the principles of modernization could be more fully brought into
 play in the program of instruction.  When the reciprocal delegation from China
 visited the US a year and a half later, we were told the same thing--that the
 curriculum was undergoing change  in accordance with the demands of moderniza-
 tion.  This is not to say that curriculums should not be constantly revised and

 over just what is is you teach in matters of strategy and doctrine in order to
 contribute to modernization.   There were some hints that the Chinese were coming
 to grips with the issue in the fall 1980 discussions when they explained that
 they were trying to teach the relationship between diplomacy and military power;
 they were also very anxious to know how US military education taught the subject

 of warnings of impending surprise attack.  Chinese professional military education,
 like other systems of education in China, is trying to impart greater technical
 and scientific knowledge.  Any of these subjects, depending on how they are
 taught could induce momentum away from classical concepts of doctrine and
 strategy.
 As Chinese military education enters the 1980's, it is still the long
 march generation that has ultimate responsibility for what is taught.  In spite
 of the great attention given to modernization in various speeches and writings,
 it will likely be som+ ime before a full transition in strategic and doctrinal
 concepts will occur in the professional military education system.  Ultimately,
 the current mixture of classical aphorisms on people's war, and a good deal of
 talk about modern conditions, will give way to a more coherent system of
 education in these subjects, but for the time being, there is likely to be a

 Generational Change
 At a speech commemorating the 30th anniversary of the PLA Military
 Academy on January 15, 1981, Xiao Ke identified the central task of the
 Military Academy as "to bring up a new generation of middle-ranking and senior
 15
 commanding personnel."   Indeed, this issue is paramount throughout the
 professional military education system, that is, the socialization of a new
 generation of leaders at all levels of the military command structure.  A
 primary function of the military education system to to transmit the values
 of one group of leaders to the next, and in this the Chinese have a unique situation.
 It will be recalled that during his meetings with US military educators,
 Xiao Ke noted the age of the Chinese delegation and suggested they could not
 retire for a while because of the disruptions created in socialization during the
 Cultural Revolution.  Yet, this approach involves a paradox in that the long

 march and revolutionary war generation insists on clinging to authority until
 can be assured that the newer generations are  correctly socialized,
 thereby blocking a transition that is almost certainly necessary if the goal of
 modernization is to be achieved.
 The problem is closely related to the problem of defining professionalism
 and strategy and doctrine discussed above.  Those in authority in the military
 education system at the highest echelons are older veterans for the most part.
 Very little, if any "new blood" has been brought into the system.  Consequently,
 while much lip service is given to modernization, both the curriculuum and
 teaching methodology tend toward the "tried and true" system of the past.  This
 was reflected to a great extent during our visit to various military facilities
 and in our disucssions with Chinese leaders.
 For example, during our visit to a model division near Tianjin we
 were treated to tours and demonstrations illustrating the principle that-the
 PLA is "a fighting force, a working force and a production force" (indeed,
 one of the things most impressive about Chinese museums and exhibits in
 general was their ability to articulate a common theme through organization
 and presentation).  Thus, we witnessed PLA soldiers engaged in climbing and
 descending walls, hand-to-hand combat, and other basic skills.  We also
 visited the unit's fields, factories (including seeing officers' wives
 make vitamins), and other facilities, and were entertained by the Cultural
 groups.  While it was obvious that this was a showpiece unit designed to
 impress foreign visitors, we were surprised that its presentations had changed
 little, if any, since the early 1970's when westerners first visited it.
 At one point during the tour I asked the1Cadre in charge of political
 work who was conducting the tour  how modernization would affect all of this.
 When he finished his answer, which stressed the importance of modernization,

 the necessity of improvements, and so on, I could not ascertain that there was
 any sense of immediate relevance for that particular unit.  I was left with
 the distinct impression that modernization was something which might incrementally
 filter down to various units as time went by.  I do not suggest that the same
 situation exists in all units.  There are numerous reports in the Chinese press
 of unit technical innovations which supposedly contribute to modernization, and
 of increased time spent in learning technical information.  However, there is
 a very strong legacy of the way things are to be done that seems to have a
 good grip on the vast majority of units.
 This should not be surprising.  Given the public relegation of military
 modernization to fairly low priority and the fact that traditionalists head
 the military education system why should units make dramatic changes in the
 way they go about doing things?  Thus, there is the very paradoxical situation
 of leaders constantly alluding to the need for fresh thinking, innovation,
 modernization, while the system itself is strongly wedded to seniority,
 tradition, and continuity.  While it would be unfair to say that the older
 generation is incapable of promoting change, it does seem true that the
 pent socialization scheme does not agur well for the kinds of values that
 16
 the Chinese leaders are saying must be inculcated.
 In summary, the military education requires new leadership which
 can effectively impart new values and methods if modernization is truly to
 become in practice as well as in theory part of the system.  As long as present
 leaders are dissatisfied with the results of the military education system, as
 they have been expressing since the criticism of the Cultural Revolution began,
 and are unwilling to surrender control to new and younger personnel (presuming
 those with proper technical backgrounds can be found), we can anticipate that
 there will be only halting steps toward revamping of the professional military

 education system.  Consequently, the generational issue will continue to be
 of significance in the 1980s.
 The Politics of Modernization
 All of the issues discussed above, military v. civilian, strategy and
 doctrine, the question of leadership transition are closely related and might
 be
 conceivably/subsumed in a more broad general issue, that of the politics of
 modernization.  Modernization, besides being an important slogan in the Chinese
 lexicon, has become an intensely political question.  Debates over strategies to
 achieve modernization resulted in severe political cleavages and leadership
 change during the early 1980s, and in many respects professional military education
 represented a microcosm of the larger questions under debate.
 One of the major questions related to modernization was defining China's
 relationship with the west.  Much as the self-strengthening movement at the turn
 of the century sought to define the Sino-Western relationship, the current leaders
 17
 of China are considering the impact of both western technology and ideas.   This
 issue is of great importance to the Chinese military.  A greater reliance on
 western technology in weapons procurement, for example, would presumably
 necessitate greater specialization in military training.  With this would almost
 certainly come a refinement of the concept of professionalism in the armed
 forces.  That is, it implies a shift toward the Pengist-Dengist model discussed
 earlier.
 Increasing specialization and changes in professionalism must
 necessarily have a political impact.  The bifurcation of Party and military
 offices within the military might help to ensure the continued dominance of
 the military by the Party, but at the same time, increasingly specialized
 military technicians would demand greater influence in decisions over doctrine

 and strategy.  Presumably, over an extended period of time, the PLA could
 evolve into something akin to the Soviet armed forces, however, given the
 heritage of the PLA, this would require some fairly dramatic changes.
 Even if it were to be assumed that the Chinese leadership had a clear
 . 10
 idea of which way they wanted the military to evolve,(which  t obviously cannot
 be assumed) 1the implications for military education are staggering.  The
 military education system would somehow be expected to divorce itself from
 current practices and to produce a group of loyal adherents to the Party who
 are also technically proficient managers (precisely the task that the military
 academies are calling for).  The military education system would have to
 quickly resolve the question of authority between those with seniority and
 those with technical expertise.
 Also, the whole question of political education, one of the major
 components of professional military education, would have to be"addressed.-
 In the present system the major political questions have arisen over the
 question of political line.  Thus, the debates of the 1960's and 70's were
 carried over into the content of political education.  Shifts in the wind
 could be managed by experienced personnel responsible for political education,
 although during major upheavals such as occured during the Cultural Revolution
 many of these people found themselves on the wrong side (in many instances,
 no matter which side they were on).  A review of the General Political
 Department over the past few years shows many criticisms of political cadres
 for not being able to keep up with the correct political line;  even the most
 adept could not escape blame altogether.
 However, the. issue now at stake is infinitely more complex.  In
 addition to coping with shifts in the political line, the professional military
 education system faces a restructuring more profound than was envisioned in the

 Cultural Revolution.                  The reason for this is that the Maoist citizen-soldier model
 must necessarily yield to the modernization model under conditions of increased
 technical specialization.  In the past when the Maoist model was more closely
 adhered to by the PLA, the authority of the command structure was based on close
 identification with ideologically specified values.  Repeating an observation made
 earlier in the paper, while Maoist ideology does not deny modernization, it places
 greater emphasis on non-technical values.  In many instances, specialization
 violated the concept that the soldier must remain close to the masses.  If we
 assume that technical change will result in increased specialization and that
 promotions, awards, recognition and so forth, will be based increasingly on
 technical expertise, then on what will command authority be based?  Rhetorically
 we may answer that it will be based on the expertise of the commander, but as
 in the case with other technologically improving military organizations in the
 world, not necessarily on specific abilities in weapons systems though, of course,
 this skill will be important), but on managerial skills.
 system
 In other words, the military education/will be called upon to provide
 skilled managers, not better combat technicians, or political thinkers, or
 high level decision-makers.  Unfortunately, it does not appear that this has
 been fully grasped by the leaders of the military education system.  Once again,
 however, it must be pointed out that the reason it has not been fully grasped,
 is because the Chinese themselves are not certain they are fully committed to a
 shift away from the Maoist model in spite of the lip service given to moderniza-
 tion.  The Chinese professional military education system and its curriculuum
 are ample evidence of the tenative committment.
 By way of contrast, professional military education in the United
 States reflects the results of modernization.  At various levels, both the
 organization and the curriculuum have historically reflected the perceived
 increasing need for training in management skills, leadership, communication

 -15-
 and other subjects more akin to the social sciences than other scientific and
 technical subjects, or subjects uniquely related to combat.  Part of this is
 due to the fact that officers with college degrees frequently have strong technical
 backgrounds upon which to draw, however, the main reason has to do with what is
 perceived as necessary for operating modern military forces. During the visit
 of the Chinese military educators to Washington in the fall of 1980 the point
 was made that the successively higher levels of professional military education
 in the United States increasingly reflect emphasis on political subjects.  The
 curriculuum of the National War College for example stresses international relations,
 the development of strategy, budgetary politics, and the operation of the upper
 echelons of the national security system.
 When the Chinese say that 80o of their curriculuum is military and 20%
 is political, they mean that much of their training deals with combat operations
 and about 20% of it is indoctrination in Marxist-Leninist theory.  Combat operations
 are stressed even at the highest level of Chinese professional military education,
 the PLA Military Academy.  Even though the PLA has historically been heavily
 involved in political decision making at the highest levels, there seems to be
 little, if any, formal instruction in subjects such as management or public admin-
 istration.  An attribute of modernization it seems would imply greater attention
 to these kinds of subjects.
 If we assume that modernization of professional military education will
 contribute to specialization and a new definition of professionalism in the PLA,
 what will that mean about its political role, an issue mentioned briefly earlier
 in this chapter?  Past models of the military's political role have stressed that

 leadership will continue to be important. Iv However, in the past professional military
 officers have been involved in the Politburo--the Party's highest decision-making
 organ--directly.  Since the Tenth Party Congress in 1973 there has been a tendency
 toward the reduction of military representation at this level, a tendency which

 will probably continue into the 1980's.                  The questions becomes whether the
 military will be willing to strive for its interests within bureaucratic and
 party chapels as it is losing its high level access.
 A situation could be envisioned in which the PLA, its access to top-level
 decision making curbed, its interests challenged, and its prestige damaged, would
 thereby experience tremendous pressures to stage a coup. This would not be a
 Lin Biao style coup attempt in which a leader elicits segments of the military
 to challenge others for power (although another coup attempt of this type can by
 no means be completely ruled out), but one in which the military seizes power
 with design to advancing its own organizational interests, a situation which
 has arisen in many developing countries facing problems similar to those of China.
 Obviously, China's leaders are desirous that such a development not occur.
 Therefore, we can expect to see that a problem for professional military education
 will be to socialize military leaders in such a manner as to minimize the possibil-
 ity that they will want to circumvent normal channels for achieving their political
 objectives.
 The obvious response to this problem is what the Chinese are already
 doing--heavy ideological indoctrination which emphasizes loyalty, discipline and
 other values.  Nevertheless, to the up-and-coming generation of Chinese military
 leaders who have witnessed the vicissitudes of the Cultural Revolution and the
 ongoing movement to "deMaoify" Chinese ideology, finding committment in ideological-
 ly expressed values must be somewhat difficult.  There is already considerable",
 evidence that top military leaders question the effort to denigrate Mao,
 moreover, there is considerable uncertainty as to where this ideological trend
 will lead.  Just as other aspects of the political process in China have
 reflected turbulence over this question, so must professional military education.

 The primary purpose of this chapter has been to look at professional
 military education in the PLA , especially the issues that face it in the coming
 decade. It briefly considered the structure and curriculuum of PME as it now
 stands, but deals mainly with the issues that will confront it in the future.
 Professional Kilitary education is a microcosm of basic economic, social and
 political issues. in China today.  The Chinese Communists are committed to the
 modernization of China, of which military modernization has been defined as an
 important component.  Military modernization is seen not only as the acquisition
 of new weaponry, but as the increasing specialization and technical expertise of
 armed forces personnel. At present, professional military education reflects
 primarily past values which are not altogether congruent with modernization and
 specialization.  For example, little attention is given to public administration,
 management, or other similar training as is typical in most higher professional
 military education  systems in other countries, while a great deal of emphasis
 is placed on combat operations.  Nevertheless, a good deal of lip service is
 given to the rhubric of modernization.
 Though the strategy of how to modernize has been constantly undergoing
 redefinition in China, and the effort to modernize the armed forces has been
 halting at best, it is unlikely that the committment will diminish.  The
 content of professional military education as expressed in the curriculuum will
 change gradually to reflect the demands of specialization.  However, the
 content must also cope with the changing political role of the PLA, thereby
 producing a generation of loyal and technically proficient (in managerial
 skills) military leaders.  The evidence provided above suggests that this task
 will be extremely tortuous.  For the most part, the PLA's professional military

 even greater tests.

 HONGQI No. 1 (January 1, 1981) contains comments on the strategy of the Afghan
 insurgency which reflects the strong influence of Mao's military thinking.  The
 article at length discusses why it is possible for the Afghan insurgents to fight
 against the Soviet Union, a formidable military foe.  Among other points:
 The Afghan people are able to continue the fight against the
 Soviet aggressors because they have adopted correct military tactics.
 They have been able to overcome the enemy's superiority--concentrated
 forces, strong firepower and good mobility, and have given full play
 to the power of people's war.  Their troops are scattered and hidden.
 They have seized opportunities to make sudden attacks upon the enemy,
 to intercept enemy motorcades, to skillfully seize strongholds, to
 burn warehouses and to attack the airport.  In this way the enemy has
 been put into a passive position and has been tired out by too much
 moving around. . .
 Fighting for the purpose of safeguarding the independence of the
 motherland and the survival of the nation and adopting the correct
 military tactics are the fundamental reasons why the Afghan people
 can and are still fighting in the war.
 . The struggle of the Afghan people tells all people in the
 world the following truth:  Despite their military strength, the
 Soviet social imperialists are not irresistible.  When a small nation
 is invaded, its people can mobilize all patriotic forces and adopt
 military tactics which conform with the specific conditions of their
 own nation to deal with even such a military superpower like the
 Soviet Union.  This is an encouragement to all countries which are
 being occupied, controlled, suppressed and threatened by the Soviet
 Union. . .

 16.   Some of China's current leaderscan certainly be considered innovative,
 among them, Deng Xiaoping, who seems quite willing to tinker with political and
 social institutions. Nevertheless, for every innovater, there is an army of
 recalcitrant bureaucrats ready to wear down any new policy, at least if Chinese
 press comment can be believed.  Much of the problem is related to what theorists
 of political socialization have termed "manifest" and "latent"socialization.
 The "manifest" aspects of socialization consisting of numerous speeches, articles,
 and policy documents calling for modernization are very prominent.  The "latent"
 aspects consisting of the organizational structure of the professional military
 education system, careerism, promotions and other aspects of "how the system really
 works" are not as easily seen, yet have a very real impact on how military
 professionals conceive  of the military role, and their own role in the military.

 China," Issues and Studies (July 1979), pp. 22-33; see especially pp. 28-31.
 In the summer of 1980 a -series of articles on the "westernization" movement at
 the end of the Qing dynasty appeared in the Chinese press.  The allegorical
 debate had obvious significance for present issues.  Some of the more notable
 are  Qiao Huantian "Brief Account of the Discussions on Certain Questions Regarding
 the Westernization Movement" RENMIN RIBAO (taken from BEIFANG LUNCONG), 14 July

 the Westernization Group Arranged for the Building of Coastal Defenses," GUANGMING
 RIBAO, 29 July 1980; DR/PRC 12 August 1980, L 13-15.  Qiao generally makes a
 positive assessment of the "westernization" movement.
