May 1969 
THE COMMUNIST SCENE  
(22 March - 18 April 1969) 
1. Soviets Attain Objective in Czechoslovakia  
After prolonged effort, the Soviets have finally succeeded in removing 
Alexander Dubcek from his key position of Secretary General of the Czechoslo-
vak Communist Party (CzCP) by virtue of a Second Soviet Intervention. The 
CzCP Central Committee met on 17 April and announced major changes in the 
leadership. Slovak Party leader Gustav Husak replaced Dubcek, who, however, 
remains on the new 11-man Presidium (Politburo), which itself replaces the 
old 21-man Presidium and its 8-man Executive Committee ("Super-Politburo"). 
Josef Smrkovsky, the most consistent and outspoken of the reformist Czech 
party leaders, was dropped from the Presidium. To make the demotion of 
Dubcek and Srmkovsky palatable to the population and to forestall violent 
mass protests, it was arranged for the Presidium to contain a sprinkling of 
men of known liberal reputation, most notable among whom is Karel Polacek, 
the leading Czech trade union leader, in order to counterbalance the increased 
conservative coloring of the leadership. The inclusion of notorious pro-
Moscow conservatives like Lubomir Strougal, Jan Piller, and Vasil Bilak is 
an ominous portent. The retention of President Svoboda and Premier Cernik 
helps give an air of stability and continuity. Husak himself is generally 
held to be a "realist"; he can hardly be labeled a complete conservative or 
a true liberal. The central fact is that he seems to consider accommodating 
the Soviets as the first and foremost task of the Czech leadership -- and 
it is unquestionably this fact, along with his reputation of being neither 
liberal nor conservative, that persuaded the Soviets to install him as the 
new leader. 
The changeover was accompanied by extensive police action in the form 
of detention and questioning of hundreds of people. Whether this was a 
precautionary measure or a foretaste of a more aggressive police state 
should soon become clear. Also subject to doubt is the sincerity of Husak's 
claim that the change in leadership means no change in policy, that the 
liberal reform program will continue, and that there will be no return to 
the dark pre-Dubcek days of Novotny. The Soviets engineered these govern-
mental changes and installed Husak in his key position for just the opposite 
purpose, namely to hasten "normalization," the Soviet euphemism for making 
Czechoslovakia conform to the colorless pattern of orthodoxy displayed in 
East Germany, Poland, and Bulgaria. The main question to ask is not whether 
the new regime will re-impose an orthodox Communist dictatorship, but rather 
how they will go about it and how long it will take. The answer to these 
questions is to be found partly in the course of action that will be taken 
by the groups in the Czech population who consistently supported Dubcek's 
policies -- students, intellectuals, scientists, journalists, trade 
unionists -- but also in how much moral support they receive from the free 
world.

2. East and West: Two Communist Congresses  
It would be hard to find two more widely divergent phenomena of current 
Communist activity than the Ninth Chinese Communist Party and the 15th Congress 
of the Finnish Communist Party. Both took place in April: the CCP Congress 
beginning on the first and the FCP Congress taking place 3-6 April. Apart 
from that coincidence, virtually all they had in common was the fact that 
both ignored the wishes of Big Brother CPSU, thus illustrating quite per-
suasively the ability of Communist parties to make their own decisions 
independently of the CPSU if they are but determined to do so, regardless 
of CPSU attempts to dictate. 
The Chinese Congress  
Ten years overdue and after only a brief announcement in January that 
the Ninth Party Congress would convene sometime in 1969, the Congress was 
suddenly pronounced assembled on 1 April at an undisclosed site in Peking. 
The Chinese radio announced that Mao Tse-tung made an "important speech" 
and Defense Minister Lin Piao, later officially confirmed as heir-apparent 
to Mao, gave a "political report." For typically mysterious, Maoist reasons, 
not even the substance, much less the text, of either report was made public. 
The 1,512 delegates to the Congress then were said to have broken up into 
discussion groups to study the reports in detail, paragraph by paragraph, 
sentence by sentence, and also to study the new draft constitution. This 
task, clearly a rubber stamp procedure, seems to have absorbed all the 
energies of the delegates for the next two weeks of the Congress. Free 
world "China watchers" have scrutinized the meager offerings from Chinese 
news media, including the slight television coverage of the Congress, for 
clues of its significance. The unconfident consensus, perhaps best expres-
sed in the attached article by correspondent Peter Grose in the New York  
Times, is that a factional struggle is being silently waged between fanatic 
Mao adherents who want to continue the Cultural Revolution (a purge and 
purification of the Party) and more moderate leadership elements, including 
the military, who seek to restore a semblance of normalcy in the administra-
tion of the country. 
The course of the Congress and a communique (attached) issued during 
the Congress on 14 April deserve study. Stalin was in command for roughly 
25 years before the world fully realized and Communists, including his own 
countrymen, acknowledged that he was a megalomaniac. The wording of the 
14 April communique, as a masterpiece of vacuity in content and of 
sycophancy in its flattery of Mao, apart from being an offense to human 
intelligence, contends for honors with the "cult of (Stalin's) personality." 
It seems reasonable to assume that many of Mao's colleagues are suffering 
under the burden of his manias just as Khrushchev and his colleagues suf-
fered under Stalin's manias.

The conduct of the Congress, incidentally, illustrates the complete 
contempt in which the Chinese leadership holds its own people -- in whose 
name the Congress is held. Clearly it does not feel the slightest obli-
gation to keep them informed of what the leadership thinks or has decided 
about the fate of the people, for this fate is supposedly what the Congress 
is determining. 
The Finnish Party Congress  
On the other side of the world, another important CP meeting was 
taking place: the Finnish Communist Party Congress. The FCP's claim to 
distinction is that it is among Europe's most powerful CF's. It holds 41 
seats in a 200-member unicameral parliament, has polled some 20% or more of 
the popular vote in national elections since World War II, and is the only 
CP in non-Communist Europe to be participating in government (it holds three 
cabinet posts in coalition with Social Democrats and Centrists). Since 
Stalin's death in 1953, the party had been gradually liberalized under 
pressure from younger Communists of modern outlook who have little knowledge 
of, and less patience with, the irrelevant, ossified Stalinist (and even 
Leninist) dogma still espoused by their older, Moscow-trained, conspiracy-
minded colleagues. The "generation conflict" of recent years unexpectedly 
reached crisis proportions on the occasion of the Congress, when key 
Stalinists, seeing the prospect of defeat after defeat on party statutes, 
program, and membership in key party offices, walked out in a huff, planning 
to meet separately on 25-26 April to discuss, among other things, whether 
they should establish a separate party. One of the obsolete pieces of 
Leninist baggage seemingly thrown out at the Congress was the traditional 
Communist aim of establishing a "dictatorship of the proletariat" and the 
notion of the Communists' wielding exclusive power. This doctrine gave 
way to acceptance of the ?principle of multiple parties even after establish-
ment of a "Socialist" State. It was largely due to this very heresy that 
the Soviets invaded Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. 
The Soviets seem not to have taken a public stand on these debates 
within the Finnish party, evidently because they are powerless to change 
the FCP stand. But in the matter of the split in the party they could 
not refrain from reverting to direct interference. The main Finnish news-
paper, Helsingin Sanomat, reported that representatives of the Finnish Old 
Guard and of the now dominant liberal group were summoned to the Soviet 
Embassy by Arvid Pelshe, visiting CPSU Politburo member and pressed to 
reconcile their differences with the admonition that whoever splits the 
Finnish Communist Party is no friend of the Soviet Union. Considering 
recent trends in the FCP toward independent decisions, (the dominant 
leadership firmly denounced the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia), there 
is no guarantee that Soviet admonitions will have any appreciable effect. 
3. Briefly Noted  
a. Rumanian Foreign Minister to Moscow. Foreign Minister Corneliu 
Manescu was greeted on his formal visit to Moscow, 7-9 April, with a not-
so-subtle insult in the form of a strong reiteration in Pravda of the 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-pP79-01194A000500110001-9 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000500110001-9 
Brezhnev Doctrine, among the main targets of which is Rumania. It is a 
matter of intriguing speculation for foreign correspondents in Moscow why 
this one-shot insult was printed. No other newspaper carried it, and there 
seems to have been no follow-up. One thing is clear: the Soviets are 
retaining their options concerning future action toward Rumania, and one of 
these options is to apply the Brezhnev Doctrine to Rumania as they applied 
it to Czechoslovakia last August. 
The purpose of Manescu's mission remains even now shrouded in mystery 
and Communist news media offer no enlightenment. His visit was completed 
with a non-committal joint announcement and an invitation to Brezhnev, 
Kosygin, and Podgorny to pay a visit to Rumania. They accepted. 
b. Brutal PCI-Soviet Polemics. Attached are translations of a bitter 
exchange of polemics started by Giuseppe Boffa, prominent journalist-com-
mentator and former Moscow correspondent for the Italian Communist news-
paper L'Unitg, who often speaks for the leadership of the party. Boffa, 
writing in L'Unit6 on 9 April took the occasion of the Sino-Soviet border 
conflict to raise all the objections and apprehensions the PCI has about 
CPSU policies and intentions, including the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and 
the role of the Soviet Union as a "guiding state" for the world's Communist 
parties. Stung badly, the Soviets lost little time in replying through 
Pravda on 13 April in an article by one Ivanov. Boffa's article may well 
be the PCI's way of serving notice on the CPSU that they still have grave 
doubts about participating in the World Communist Conference on 5 June 1969, 
at which it is expected that the CPSU will try once again to reassert a 
measure of control over the world's Communist parties.

? 
Indeed, the tight secrecy sur-
rounding the congress is con-
sidered impressive evidence 
that significant issues are be-
ing threshed out. Since the 
opening day, Tuesday, the Chi-
nese press and radio have 
maintained a total silence 
,about the proceedings. . 
A Hanel rommoniquis, of the 
'opening clay is still repeated 
iregularly by ,Peking, four days 
later. No additional details 
;have been given to the Chinese 
ipeople about the speech of 
;Chairman Mao or the political 
ireport of his heir apparent, De-
'loose Minister Lin Piao. 
When the eighth party con-
gress first met, in 1956, the 
major opening day speeches 
were published in full two days 
later. That congress recon-
vened in 1958, and then the 
proceedings were not made 
known until a final report at 
the end. 
Analysts believe that the 
1958 meeting provoked consid-
erable internal controversy 
over decisions leading up to 
the ambitious and unsuccessful 
economic program called the 
"Great Leap Forward?' 
Another sign that solidarity 
Arhievpci :nmnrig 
congress or the Chinese Com-
munist party now under way 
in Peking appears to be an at-
tempt by Mao Tse-tung not 
only to rebuild the party but 
also to insure its future ideo-
logical purity. 
, It was the party chairman's 
conviction that the old party 
bureaucracy was riddled with 
men who opposed him person-
ally and ideologically. That is 
believed to have led him to 
undertake in 1966 the pro-
longed purge known as the Cul-
tural Revolution. 
Tho party congress has met 
without press publicity since it 
opened Tuesday. It is believed 
to be deliberating on a politi-
cal report given by Defen:e: 
Minister Lin Piao, Mr. Mao's 
hand-picke 'r 
A draft 
stitution that reached 
Kong in January defines a pa.-
? 
as observers. 
Normally, Communist party 
congresses attract a large num-
ber of representatives from al-
lied parties. Peking has not 
reported the presence of any 
foreigners, and diplomats know 
that in the weeks preceding the 
congress several potential dele-
gations were discouraged from 
attending, at least at the early 
stages. 
This suggests that the lead-
ership did not want to have 
outside witnesses to whatever 
deliberations are taking place. 
A final indication that 
unanimity was lacking on key 
issues was the long delay in 
convening the congress. Prom-
ised since August, 1967, the 
opening was repeatedly post-
poned, even, apparently, up to 
the last minute. Almost all the 
important provincial leaders 
are reported to have been in 
Peking for the congress from 
the beginning of March; yet the 
congress did not open until the 
beginning of April. 
The most pressmg question 
for Western analysts is thel 
identity of the officials who will 
emerge with key Government 
and party jobs. The narnpq  
y congress ea "tlIC h:010t 
leading organ of the party," 
and 1,512 delegates have ga-
thered in Peking for the meet-
ing. 
To Adopt Party Charter 
One of their jobs will be to 
adopt the new charter, the Pe-
king radio has said. The draft 
document suggests much abot:t 
the tactics that Mr. Mao evi-
dently intends to follow in re-
structuring the party.} 
He is believed to have been! 
obsessed in recent years withl 
chef that a "socialist" state; 
n clangbr of a restoration oi. 
italisra or of "revisionist" 
as as it proceeds toward,: 
e "communism." 
he preamble, or "general pro-
m," of the draft constitution, 
ects this view when it says 
t in the stage of transition, . 
socialism to communism; 
re will throughout exist 
ses, class contradictions and! 
class struggle, there will:

The 176 persons listed as

now doubt that this will be

CHINA'S RUA VOTE CHARM AKING EEIR TO fi1A01 
Party Congress Approves 
' New Po!icy Program ? 
DiF,doses No Details 
By CHARLES MOHR 
ti) The New YwV rmtz 
'HONG scrim- April 14?The 
inth congress of the Chinese 
Communist party unanimously 
adopted today a new party 
charter that stipulates that De-
fense Minister Lin Piao will 
eventually succeed Mao Tse-
tung as China's leader. 
' A communique made public 
today by the official press 
agency Ilsinhua said the con-
gress also unanimously adopt-
ed a political report by Mr. 
ln that will' probably become 
'blueprint for policy in for-
eign, economic and domestic 
political fields. But it gave no 
details of the report. 
The communique added that 
the party congress would begin 
tomorrow to elect a new Can.: 
tral Committee. During the Cul-
tural Revolution initiated by 
Mr. Mao three years ago, about 
two-thirds of the members of 
the old Central Committee were 
dismissed as "power-holders 
taking the capitalist road." 
Unusual Occasion 
A congress Is described by 
Chinese Communists as the 
highest governing organ of 
their party, and such convoca-
_ ?Ions are both rare and im-
ithiosertant. The ninth congress is 
,only the second held since the 
Communists won control of 
China in 1049. The last con-
gress was elected in 1956 and 
'last met in 105S.

TtntHtnnt Vflore had Won 
no further news on their de-
liberations, but today's corn-
muniqu6 indicated that the 
congress would soon adjourn. 
The first two items on the 
congress agenda, as announced 
April I, were the adoption of 
Mr. Lin's politieal report and a 
new party constitution. These 
tasks have been completed. 
Mao Title in Doubt 
Tonight's communiqud said 
the congress would begin elect-
ing a new Central Committee 
."starting from April 15." It was 
unclear how long this process 
would take. 
The Central Committee will 
then meet to select a new 
Politburo, which, in turn, will 
elect a standing committee. 
This will be the supreme ruling 
party body in China. 
The new Central Committee 
would technically be empow-
ered also to elect a new chair-
man of the committee, but most 
analysts in Hong Kong assume 
that Mr. Mao will be re-elected 
to his post with Lin Piao the 
sole vice chairman. 
Some observers in Washing. 
ton have speculated that Mr. 
;Mao may be elevated in title 
:to something approximating

The more they read it the 
more it warms their hearts. 
The delegates have made 
many good proposals for ad-

All the delegates conscien-

party's mass line. 
The delegates pointed out 
that the draft constitution of 
the party has clearly reaf-
firmed Marxism - Leninism, 
Mao Tse-tung's thought, as 
the theoretical basis of the 
party's guiding thinking and 
clearly stipulated that Com-

Slogans Are Shouted 
At the plenary session in 
?April 14, the great leader 
chairman Mao made an ex-

made an important speech. 
Comrades Chou En-lai, Chen

Yu-kno Weii Feng-ying and 
Chi Teng-kuei also spoke. 
They expressed their unan-

tremely important speech 
made by the great leader 
Chairman Mao. for the politi-
cal report made by Comrade 
Lin Piao and for the draft 
constitution of the Commu-
nist party of China. 
'? Their speeches were punc-
tuated by warm applause and 
shouting of slogans through-
out the hall. After adopting 
Vice Chairman Lin Piao's po-
litical report and the Constk 
tution of the Communist 
party of China, the congress 
decided to entrust the secre-
tariat of the presidium of the 
congress with the publication 
of the two documents after 
making modifications in 
wording. 
Seated in the front row of

Since the opening of the

the whole nation has been in 
jubilation. Hundreds of mil-

it k re;'orted, they has.e neither 
financial nor political support 
from the Soviet Union, 
In a recent interview, Mr. 
Saarinen and Mr. Aalto sug-
gested that Moscow's tolerance 
for the Finnish Communist dis-
'sidence was a result of a So-
viet need not only for making 
peace with as many of the 
world's Communist parties as 
possible but also for Maintain-
ing cooperation with Finland. 
Most Finns, including Com-
munists, believe it is an axiom 
of Soviet foreign policy to cul-
tivate normal relations with 
Finland and to keep her out 
of the tensions besetting cen-
tral Europe. 
A further peculiarity of the 
Finnish Communist party is 
that it is the only one in 
Western Europe that is repre-
sented in a national govern-
ment. Under Mr. Saarinen's 
guidance, it has committed it-, 
self to responsible participation 
both in the five-party coalition 
Government headed by Social 
Democrats, and in Parliament 
where it holds 41 of the 2()B 
- c 
to , t,c Fin 
Democratic League. 
Rejecting old slogans of 
"dictatorship of the proletari-
at," Mr. Saarinen has cam-
paigned for "peace, democracy 
and socialism. 
Elected in 1966 
He has consistently fought 
for this approach since he was 
elected chairman in January,' 
1966, replacing Aimo Aaltonen, 
an old-time Stalinist. 
The chairman and Mr. Aalto 
concede that the walkout of 
the Stalinists may cost the par-
ty some voter strength in next 
year's parliamentary elections, 
but they are hoping that the 
general trend in Finnish politi-
cal thinking is leftward and 
that, as liberal Communists, 
they may one day be strong 
enough to form a government 
coalition alone with the Social 
Democrats. 
The Social Democrats, under 
Premier Maunio Koivisto, are 
the strongest single party in 
Finland, with 55 seats in Par. 
'lament. 
The Saarinen leadership's 
new freedom ..of maneuver is, 
`11111 I I Pp I 
(sum 1),):.?itio1;s 
power in the Politburo and the 
Central Committee. 
It is evident especially in the 
chairman's critical stance to-
ward certain elements of Soviet 
policy, for example, his move 
to send a delegate to the Yugo-
slav Communist party congress 
last month, even after Moscow 
ordered the Soviet-bloc parties 
to boycott the Yugoslays. 
Ironically, the Finnish clele: 
gate to Belgrade was Mrs. 
Hertta Kuusinen, the grand old 
lady of the party who is the 
daughter of the late Otto 
Kuusinen, a Bolshevik who was 
prominent in both the Finnish 
and Soviet parties. Mrs. Kuusi-, 
nen, 65 years old, was former-
ly a Stalinist and is now a 
member of the Saarinen reform 
majority and of the new 12. 
member Politburo. 
The only other member of 
the Politburo previously iden-
tified with the orthodox group 
is the fornler general secretary, 
Ville Pessi, and he, like Mrs. 
Kuusinen, has pledged loyalty 
to Mr. Saarinen and his reform 
program.

Aarne Saarinen, chairman of the FCP, Erkki Salomaa, vice-chairman, 
and Arvo Aalto, Secretary General, also attended the dinner hosted by 
Ambassador A.E. Kovalev on Tuesday evening, 8 April. 
The tone of the speech by Pelshe, the leader of the CPSU delegation 
attending the FCP congress, was said to be.that those who walked out of the 
congress should return without delay to the mother party. 
It is said that the feelings of the Stalinist have already calmed down

and the foundin: of a new party is not considered very probable. Possibly 
Arvid l'elshe's messa-Le had some influence on this. 
The preparatory'committee of the FCP opposition camp is supposed 
to meet in a fQw days. The arrangement:for the meeting have hit a snag: 
"A sufficiently large hall has not been found available in Helsinki," 
our paper was told. 
Arvo Aalto, the new Secretary General of the FCP, is optimistic 
about the possibilities for a reconciliation: "Very likely these 
problems can be resolved. The desire for reconciliation is in the wind 
more than during the congress and it creates a favorable atmosphere," 
Aalto stated. 
The 15th congress of the FCP was concluded on Easter with sharp 
differences between the two Communist camps. The Stalinist minority 
which walked out of the Culture House on Saturday held its own meeting 
in Koitto. 
At the conclusion of the Koitto meeting, it was reported that a 
country-wide Communist meeting would be held on 26-27 April. The 
intention at that meeting is to consider the founding of a new Communist 
Party. 
The regular congress placed Communists supporting the party line into 
FCP leadership positions; not even one Stalinist visibly participating 
in the opposition activity was elected to the FCPis leadership bodies.

CPU CONCERNED ABOUT THREAT TO SPLIT FCP 
^ 
,"The necessity to achieve unity in the FCP was strongly emphasized in 
the discussions which were held with the representatives of the CPSU 
already in Moscow and later during the congress. Similarly it was made clear 
that the difficulties arising from a party split would not concern internal 
policies only, but the situation would also lead to foreiEn policy problem," 
stated Aarne Saarinen, chairman of the FCP, on Thursday L.10 April/ when he 
presented an evaluation of the events of the congress to the SOL executive 
committee. "The CPSU delegation presented the view at the congress and in 
discussions during the congress that the minority group should return from 
the Koitto hall to the congress," said Saarinen. 
Chairman Saarinen stated that, "Arvid Pelshe, the leader of the CPSU 
delegation, dealt with the situation on Tuesday at the dinner at the Soviet 
Embassy, which was attended by the former and present members of FCP political 
comittee. At that time, Pelshe repeated in his speech that the line of the 
FCP has been correct and this also holds true for the party's new program in 
principle, the immediate objectives, and the decisions for collaboration in the 
government. Similarly he stated in speech that there were no obvious reasons 
for splitting the party. Administrative measures do not resolve differences 
since they would continue despite everything."

be possible to continue in the same way as before. Disciplinary actions 
are the extreme means' when everything else has been tried. Saarinen 
mentioned that the ndw Central Committee would meet after the Finnish

draws near. 
Until now. Moscow has made 
no public comment On the di' 
vergendes. . 
Moscow, April --Throughout these recent weeks Soviet public opinion has been , 
anxiously eyeing tne country's eastern zrontiers where trio long border with China lies. ? 
It is a genuine concern. Any observer comes to realize it within a few hours. A 
few signs of nervousness in the streets--and I have seen more such signs that at any. ' 
time in the past--suffice to reveal this concern at the beginning of March when. for 
the first time, it was learned that blood had been shed. Whereas no one among the ft:, 
better informed circles believes that graver dangers are imminent, among the "man ea 
in the street" there are those who fear the worst. bn 
i!ea 
But let us clarify some points. Peking's claims over vast areas of Soviet territory 
are absolutely unjustified. There is little that is socialist in any territorial Jczei 
claim. This is particularly true when the territories in question are not inhabited ca, 
by people of the claimant nation. And this is the case in the territories of the ? nail 
Soviet Far East, weare there are in effect no Chinese and practically have never beenLI, 
any. The arguments of the unequal treaties, according to which those borders were ,.);.r 
fixed, is not convincing. On this basis one cottld, in fact, demand the revision of 
almost all frontiers in the world. Anyway, the Chinese themselves became aware that a.. 
these treaties were unequal only in 1963 when they came into open conflict with the 
Soviets. Nor is there any validity in that other argument (which, in truth, even the ?/ 
Chinese themselves do not seem to use), according to which Chinese territory is too 
small for such a large population as that of the CPR. Quite apart from resembling , te 
other such dangerous theories, the fact is that there are in China enormous underpopui. 
lated areas where man's creative energy could be well applied. True, these areas ;14 
are not all hospitable. But the same applies to the entire Asiatic area of the Soviet 
Union where the Soviets have invested colossal efforts and worked extremely hard to , - 
transform those lands in the past 50 years. 
Despite these points in their favor, the Soviets have noticed with some embarrassment , 
how during this very spring their position vis-a-vis the Chinese has become weaker, 
and particularly so from the viewpoint of the sympathy which international. progressive ) 
opinion could have aroused for the Soviets. Why? Primarily because of the shock e; 
caused by the fact, in itself very grave, that such a conflict should have occurred 
between two large socialist countries which have both effected great revolutions of , 
a socialist nature. But there are also more detailed reasons. 
4 , 
What has struck this time has been the Soviet difficulty in finding a socialist ,and 
positive reply to the Chinese claims. Let me explain. In 1963 Khrushchev was also 
faced with similar claims. Although some of his most serious errors were committed 
in the field of relations with China. Khruahchev knew then how to give a constructive' 
answ,rikl4PrPaYoghfctrReleasectOWNiaa:04k.milan -01f9U01306K15t01 
day all frontiers would disappear, that this was the communists' objective; u e r 
also added that this could not be achieved by starting with an arbitrary shifting of, 
existing frontiers, because this would open the way for a worldwide process which 
could culminate only in a general war. On this basis he then proceeded to propose 
negotiations which were at that time blocked by the prejudiced manner in which, the 
Chinese asked that the existing treaties should be declared invalid--at least 
preliminarily and in principle. 
ToLL, time, however even before reac.hing the stage of a constructive offer to 
negotiate, boviet propaganda has eontlned itself to getting excited about the theme, 
of the "inviolable nature" of the "fatherland's sacred borders." This is certainly 
not the way to make an impression on leftwing opinion in the world, which is justly 
concerned about the very hypothesis of a possible Sino-Soviet conflict. To this 
have been added some absolutely deplorable voices such as that of the Soviet 
Journalist who, addressing himself to the political forces of the West, went So far 
as to suggest in the Paris LE MONDE that the USSR is not defending only its own 
borders in the Far East. Irresponsible voice? Could be. However, it also indicate* 
a certain climate and a certain mentality which is not that or one individual alon0f 
Let it be said that the support given to the Soviet positions in the ideologival 
and political dispute with China by a large section of progressive world opinion, 
and by the communist movement in particular, has never been, nor could it have ever, 
been support for the USSR as such and against China as such. And in my opinion, 
the reason it could not have been so has been explained excellently in a recent 
article by Comrade Carrillo, Spanish Communist Party secretary, who explained that 
:the "unconditional defense of the USSR" was valid for the communist movement only 
when the Soviets were isolated and encircled by hostile countries. "Today," he 
added, "there are 13 socialist countries. When one of them--and it does not mattor 
:which one it is--finds itself in conflict with the imperialist camp, there are no 
:problems and there can be no doubt as to the choice that must be made. But when 
;there is a conflict, of whatever nature, between socialist countries, the question 
As no longer as clear and as simple. The old conditioned reflexes of the time )(bon 
:the Soviet Union was the only socialist country are no longer enough." 
What,, then, was the nature of the support given by so many parties (including the 
'Spanish and Italian ones, among others) to the Soviet communists in their polemic 
with Peking? It was support primarily for a definite political line. To be quite 
'clear about it, we could say briefly that it was support for the political line of 
the 20th CPSU Congress. IV would be just as well, however, to recall some of the 
,main points of that political line, points which were defended in the Peking polemic. 
They included, and still do, peaceful coexistence, understood not as a simple 
rejection of atomic war but as a struggle for a new system of international relations 
d system particularly based on the peaceful resolving of controversies, noninterferen 
and respect for the sovereignty of others. They also included a confirmation of the 
'need for socialist democracy and its continuous development; seen in this light, it 
included a criticism of Stalinism, its methods, and its consequences. 
They included d new concept of relations between parties, a concept which was to do 
away with any residual idea of a leading center and would thus make room for the 
autonomy of every party in choosing its own path to socialism and its own model of 
.ocialism. That is what we Italian communists have been struggling for, and still 
are, in the international communist movement, and it seems to us that this is the 
path that must be followed, also in order to avoid the degeneration of disputes 
between socialist countries. 
And precisely because these were the stakes, our polemic with the Chinese was also 
accompanied, as things developed, by criticism of what seemed to go against such a 
direction in the Soviet Union itself, a direction which was opened by the 20th CPSU 
Congress and for whose development we have always wished. But the real crisis of thL 
direction happened in August 1969 an a result of the intervention in Czechoslovakia.

By Kenneth Ames 
specist to The Washington Post ' 
PlyiGUE, April 17?A1-: 
exander Dubcek, Czecnos1o.1 
vakia's national political 
hero since January, 1968, 
today was forced to resign'# 
as First Secretary of the: 
,Communist Party. 
Dubcok, 47, was removed. 
.from thb key Party post "at' 
this own request" in the course. 
,of a plenum meeting of the 
Party 'Central Committee in' 
:Prague today. Elected in his, 
:place was another Slovak, Dr. 
' Gustav Hausak, 56, until now 
.leader of the Slovakian Party. 
Dubeek was forced into a , 
tlosition where he virtually' 
had to resign after growing ' 
pressure from the Soviets and 
the conservative wing of the 
Party since the anti-Soviet 
demonstrations of March 28. 
The announcement of 
changes was made tonight in a 
television appearance -by Pres-
ident Ludvik Svoboda and Dr. 
,Husak at the end, of the firisi' 
day's meeting of the 190-mem-
ber Central Committee. 
President Svoboda told a 
television audience: "We have 
been through many crises and' 
experienced many difficulties., 
Provocative actions in recent 
weeks have hindered our ef-
forts of many months and 
damaged the efforls of the 
Party, particularly in our rela-
tions with the Soviet Union."' 
Svoboda added: "The Cen-
tral ;Committee is seeking 
ways out of the complicated 
situation. Comrade Dubcek 
;has asked to be relieved of his 
post. The name of Dubcek will 
rethain in our history. During 
the period of his work he has 
"Our present situation re-
quires," President Svoboda 
continued, "an energetic First 
Secretary and Dr. Gustav 
Husak has been chosen. I 
know that Husak is an honest 
worker and ask for the trust 
of the people." 
[AP reported the white-
haired, bespectacled Husak 
told the television audience: 
"I beg ?yru to keep calm and 
support he new leadership. 
We are 'rot going to give up 
anything of the great ideas 
which in the past year have 
come int( our public life." 
[But, i.e added, "it will be 
necessary to determine how, 
When an I in what order we 
can imp' ement those ideas." 
He also warned that "some 
people magine liberty is 
something without limits, but 
rules must be ob-
served."] 
The election of Husak 
to the Op Party slot repre-
sents a concession to pres-
sures whth have been increas-
ing from the Soviets and from 
the orthodox,. left-wing- Ale-
ments of the Party. 
It is significant that only a 
few bouts earlier a statement 
was isst ed which virtually 
whitewa4ted 10 of these con-
servative members who had 
been under suspicion of col-
laborating with the Russians. 
Husak, until now leader of 
the Slov ik Party in Bratisa-
lava, ha: recently earned the 
reputatio for being a Slovak 
national' ;t and chauvinist. 
The newest joke in Prague to-
night is .hat Husak will now 
change from being 'a ' Slovak 
nationalist io being a' czechp;. 
slovak nationalist. ' 
It is generally' conceded 
among ' Czeehoslovaks that 
Dubcek was showing definite' 
signs of falling down on the 
job. He has from the begin-
ning bdet an extremely popu-
lar man but has never been 
mistaken- for a strong or wily1 
politician. 
As some Czechs say, "He Is 
too' nice i guy for that. In fact 1 
he is just too nice period." ' 
Husak has shown definite" I 
indications of knowing how to ' 
handle r egotiations with ther 
Russians,  
tral Committee met. Roads 
surrounding the Hradeany 
Castle above Prague were cor-
doned off and traffic diverted. 
Police patrqlled the. sur-
youndings and army trucks 
were kept in reserve to be 
used as road blocks against 
possible demonstrations. But a 
mere handful. of 40 oir.'50 per-
sons stood outside the palace 
gates as members of the Com-
mittee drove in. , 
Earlier ; it was announced, 
that ' security forces had' 
rounded up. several thousand 
people in the country, the first 
action of this kind to be an-
nounced in many years, and 
had arrested persons sus-
pected of being "anti-social 
and criminal" elements. . 
On television, Husak, a 
quiet, able speaker talking off 
the cuff, explained: "We be-
lieve it essential to request 
you not to .cause a panic. For 
almost a year we have been 
trying to get out of .a difficult 
situation and to produce the; 
atmosphere for a calm life." . 
He added that one of the 
Central Committee resolutions 
was the election of a new 
Party Chairman and First Sec-
retary. 
' At the. ;same time, in re-
sponse to Soviet pressure, the 
Party presidium has been re-
duced from 21 to 11 members, 
With the exclusion of the lead-
ing reformist Josef Smrkovsky 
and aumber of other liber-
als.l Apart from Smrkovsky, 
the er inal quartet of reform-
ers remains intact. Oldrich 
Cernik head of the Czechoslo-
yak gqvernment, Svoboda and 
Dubcqk stay as members of 
the smaller party presidium. 
[A report carried by the Bul-
garian news agency BTA, 
which could not be confirmed, 
said the new presidium's mem-
bers would be: Husak, Cernik, 
Dubcek, Svoboda, union leader 
Karel Polacek, National Front 
chairman Evzen Erban, Slovak 
Premier Stefan Sadovsky, con-
servative Czech Party Bureau 
head Lubomir Strougal, con-
servative leader Vasil Bilak, 
former Interior Minister Jan 
Pillnr Anti Parlors'. Avaamhly  
ounced changes 
made this a turning point in 
the recent political history of 
Czechoslovakia. It was the mo-
ment which many Czechs have 
been awaiting since the Au-
gust invasion, to see if the two 
leading figures of the 1968 
progressive policy would be! 
quietly dropped or shoved into 
the sidelines. 
The immediate Party prob-
lem is now to make the new 
set-up palatable to the trade, 
unionst the intellectuals and 
the students?all of whom 
have recently been united in a 
front against erosion of, re-
formist policy. 
Husak told the nation to-
night in his first television ap-
pearance as party leader, "Our 
main task is to lead the coun-
try out of the crisis situation 
and return to a normal life, 
solving our problems with the 
Soviet Union." 
[Reuters reported that 
Prague was tense but out-
wardly calm tonight after the 
announcement. City police, 
reinforced. by blue-uniformed 
provincial police and troops, 
appeared on the streets in in-
creasing numbers.] 
A communique issued after 
the Central Committee meet-
ing stated that Dubcek would 
be moving into "a high state 
function." It was assumed by 
officials that this meant chair-
manship of the Federal As-
sembly. 
; Referring to the appoint-
ment of Husak to succeed 
Dubcek, the communique said, 
"We are convinced that in his 
new function he will do all 
possible to avoid repeating the 
practices and injustices of the 
50's." 
In a separate appeal to 
workers, the Party committee 
asked for maintenance of law 
and order 'and referred to 
"opposition elements which 
abused freedom." 
There has been "serious 
danger from rightist forces 
which would bring us into a 
power conflict. The develop-
ments of the past weeks have 
made the situation unbear-
able," it said in a clear refer: 
once to the rift which had 
developed in the Party leader.

Mr. Husak, who was arrested

that Mr. Dubcek would remain

nounce what citizens had be-
gun to fear would happen, first 
after the invasion and then aft-
er the anti-Soviet riots that 
erupted following a Czechoslo-
vak ice-hockey victory over the 
Russians last month. 
"Keep calm," Mr. Husak said. 
"Preserve peace. Support this 
course. We expect the Wide 
participation of the masses, of 
every citizen in creating our 
policy, in its realization and 
its control. 
"We are not giving up on 
any fundamental principles of 
our post-January policy. But we, 
have to know what to do andl 
when." 
It remained to be seen 
whether strikes and demonstra-! 
bons would be called by stu-
dents, intellectual groups and, 
reform-minded traded unions.1 
Tonight in Wenceslas Square, a 
small crowd of about 100 had 
gathered at the statute at St. 
Wenceslas, the informal memo-
rial to those who died during 
the invasion. Police cars were 
patrolling the square. 
In appealing for support, 
President Svoboda noted that 
the current crisis had resulted 
from extremists "who caused 
great damage to our country 
in the anti-Soviet rioting last 
month. 
Declaring that "we have had 
only a few hopeful and pleasant 
days," he urged the "majority 
of honorable journalists, rep-
resentatives of culture and sci-
ence, the intelligensia and trade 
unions and youth" to "have 
nothing in common" with what 
he -Allr.d the extremlst forces. 
The bespectacled Mr. Husalt 
put the appeal with more blunt-
ness. 
"Some people think that free-
dom has no limits, no restric-
tions," he declared, and I 
'would say that they would 
want some elements of anarchy 
in it. But in every orderly statel 
there must be some rules of 
play. Laws must be kept. So-
cial, party and civil disciplinel 
observed. And ther must be! 
stress on honest work." 
Once the country is out of 
the crisis, he said, the party 
will move to carry out such 
liberal demands as another 
party congress and elections to:

WWI U1e .en.menta. Mr-I 
Husak was apparently trying! 
to strengthen' his position wit1. 
the reform-minded groups, 
which have been supporting 
Mr. Dubcck in his efforts to 
transform Czechoslovakia in-
to a liberal Communist state. 
Though considered a friend. 
of the liberals at the height of 
the reform movement, Mr. Him-
ak is now generally regarded 
as more likely than Mr. Dubcek 
to compromise with Moscow 
an dcontinue with the restraints, 
imposed under Soviet pressure 
after last month's violence.

vasion because he joined with 
conservatives in declaring il-
legal the esults of the 14th 
party congress held secretly 
during the invasion to chose a 
liberal-minded Presidium. 
An articulate, 'lifelong Com-
munist, Mr. Husak has risen to 
power rapidly. He became one 
of four deputy Premiers under 
Premier Oldrich Cernik during 
last year's liberalization and, 
after the August invasion, took 
over as Slovak party leder Vol 
the Vasil Bilak, who had been 
out of favor for his support of 
Moscow. 
Until after the invasion, Mr. 
Husak was not even a member

quale spiegava come la di-

nione Sovictica valesse per

CPYRGHT 
As usual the world press devotes extensive commentaries to bloody 
provocations by Maoists on the Ussuri River. These commentaries are of 
course different. The imperialist press is engaged in searching for 
something in favor of their masters. And why not "the old red flag is

And, Life calls ox theAUStoinake a "unilateral first, step" in establishing '

Illogic of class war is being revealed. 
nwrI I I( 
On the other hand, the press of the progressive forces, led by the 
icommunist press, is indignant about-the-treacherous activities of the Peking 
leaders. Those in Peking only butter the bread of. the enemies by resorting 
to armed provocations against a socialist state. 
The presb of socialist Countries, 'the press of communist parties in 
Pcapitalist countrieb, and-the press of young states that consider the Soviet 
('Ilnionianciother sObialist countries their loyal friends angrily condemn the 
"gression OfvMaotb group., This is easy-to understand., ,Here it is also 
"YIJOSsible o,See thellogid ofclass struggle. 
II ? Itlid,much!morediffictlt, however,ito understand some journalists who 
seek to place themselves above the melee and to argue in general whether it 
is worthwhile supporting, the party that was attacked. There are not many 
of these, and they could, be ignored if among them were not included a 
contributor to the Italian communist paper, Comrade Giuseppe Boffa, who 
published an article on 9 April, under a strange, ostensibly neutral heading, 
,"The' Chinese are Exerting Pressure, and It is Being Felt." 
Comrade Boffa admits that Peking's territorial pretensions are absolutely 
unjustified. Indeed, he also admits that any sort of territorial claim has 
little to do with socialism. Comrade Boffa immediately forgets this, 
however, and turns all his ardor against the CPSU. Yes, you understood 
perfectly. Comrade Boffa considers the present moment most suitable to 
darken the serene sky. You see, to begin with, immediately after the 
perfidious attack by the Maoists on our border guards, Soviet propaganda 
limited itself only to exalting the theme of the inviolability of the sacroSanc 
frontiers of the motherland. 
Such statements, writes Comrade Boffa with the tone of a mentor, 
certainly cannot receive the approval of leftwing world public opinion. 
Did you hear that? What do you expect, dear sir, that we should renounce 
the defense of our brothers? And do you believe that in that case, left-
wing world opinion, in whose name you claim to speak with astonishing 
courage, would have understood us? We wish to be sincere. You know very 
well that progressive world opinion actually esteems and supports our 
people precisely because, while defending just positions in international 
relations, they also know how to defend their own borders Smd to deliver a 
crushing blow to any aggressor. 
In the second place, Comrade Boffa is indignant that a Soviet journalist 
in an article released by NOVOSTI and printed in the Parisian paper Le Monde  
Observed that the Soviet Union is not defending: merely Soviet borders in 
the Far East.' "What is this?" He exclaims, "An irresponsible statement?" 
Actually, it is Comrade Boffa's statement that is irresponsible. He should 
not forget that the Soviet people defended not only their own freedom and 
independence, but also the freedom and independence of other peoples in the 
battles against fascism during World War II. And also today, the Soviet

peace-loving peoples. 
And there is another important observation: Every communist keeps 
in his heart the idea of proletarian internationalism. Its importance is 
well understood by the 'working men of all countries, and in particular by 
Comrade Boffa's fellow countrymen, who remember the Soviet people's role in 
the destruction of the fascist regime in their country as well. 
The Soviets also remember the fraternal aid that the Italian workers 
rendered to our country during the tempestuous half century following the 
October Revolution. Now Comrade Boffa is trying to argue that the time may 
have come to reexamine the question of proletarian internationalism. Referring 
to the observation made by Secretary of the Spanish Communist Party Cartillo 
' that today the old beliefs dating back to the time when the Soviet Union was 
the only socialist country are no longer sufficient, he purses his lips and 
concludes that at present support for the Soviet Union should be determined 
within the framework of a given political direction. What direction is meant? 
He claims that he is a supporter of the decisions of the 20th CPSU 
Congress--as though there were communists who question these decisions--
Comrade Boffa cites the following: peaceful coexistence, confirmation of the 
necessi.ty for socialist democracy, and finally a new concept of the relations 
between parties based on the renunciation of the idea of the existence of a 
directing center. And is that all? Yes, that is all. It is precisely in 
that, he states, that the way is to be found that will make it possible to 
avoid the intensification of differences between the socialist countries. 
And Comrade Boffa adds: precisely because this was at stake, our 
argument with the Chinese gradually reduced itself to a criticism of those 
same phenomena in the Soviet Union--which it seemed to us and still seems to 
us--that are contrary to that trend. And here, he immediately refers to 
the intervention in Czechoslovakia. So it came to that As we say) 
Comrade Boffa began praying for health, but finished praying for the dead. 
He began with an expression of sympathy for the Soviet people, but finished 
by blaming them for the "interference". 
Comrade Boffa, it is a dangerous thing to forget the principles of 
proletarian internationalism, which imperatively oblige all revolutionaries 
to close ranks, compactly and firmly, every time that danger emerges. This 
occurred in Czechoslovakia, where the rightwing and the counterrevolutionary 
forces formed a bloc with external imperialist reaction. The fraternal aid 
of the socialist and allied countries was rushed there to defend socialist 
gains. It also occurred in the region of Damanskiy. Island on the Ussuri 
River, where the Chinese soldiers, operating on Mho's directives, opened 
fire on their Soviet brothers. 
We could explain all this to Comrade Boffa privately, so to speak, 
without using the pages of Pravda for this purpose. The fact is, however, 
that he printed his confusea mnoughts in the Italian Communist Party paper 
L'Unita. Everyone who has the Marxist-Leninist unity of our movement at 
heart will understand that it was impossible to leave such a public statement 
without a published reply.

THE FORGOTTEN WAR IN LAOS  
While military action in Vietnam and political maneuvering in Paris 
dominate the headlines, a war goes on in neighboring Laos, a war that per-
sists in spite of the Geneva Accords and great nation guarantees of inde-
pendence and neutrality. For most of the free world Laos has been a 
matter of almost subliminal concern -- crowded out by Vietnam, the Middle 
East, the events in Czechoslovakia, the Sino-Soviet clashes. And in the 
meantime the Communist Pathet Lao, led and bolstered by North Vietnamese 
troops, has gained control of at least half the territority of Laos. The 
Communist forces do not yet control half the population, although the long, 
wearing struggle has rendered the Laotian people and economy anemic, its 
youth cynical and many of its leaders corrupt. 
From 1964 through 1967, the military situation in the field at least 
looked hopeful and Government forces were able to maintain the military 
initiative and provide protection against the Communists for most non-
Communist elements of the population. But in 1968 the number of North 
Vietnamese regulars (Peoples' Army of Vietnam - PANN) in Laos reached 
40,000 and the Communist forces were able to inflict a series of shattering 
military setbacks on the Royal Laotian Government (RLG) forces. Govern-
mental defeats on the battlefield not only wiped out many of the earlier 
territorial gains, but also badly eroded the confidence of the political 
and military establishment. The start of the Paris negotiations to end 
the war in Vietnam gave many Laotians a psychological breather in May 1968, 
but they felt so badly deceived when their hopes for a speedy end to the 
war were dashed that the general loss in fighting spirit intensified on the 
home front and battlefield alike. 
Despite the military edge they are believed to enjoy, the Communist 
forces have let pass many recent opportunities to seize governmental gar-
risons and important towns by frontal attack. They seem instead to be 
trying to force the RLG to evacuate towns and garrisons of strategic or 
psychological importance without a pitched battle, the ultimate objective 
being to enable the Pathet Lao to quietly win more territorial control and 
therefore more leverage for political bargaining with Premier Souvanna 
Phouma. (Phouma's neutralists hold eight of the RLG's sixteen cabinet 
posts under the 1962 Geneva Accords and, although he could not allow the 
Pathet Lao much more power and hope to survive, he'could probably add 
two to their present four Cabinet posts on condition that the North 
Vietnamese forces withdraw from Laos.) 
Of course, a political settlement with its native Communists would by 
no means solve Laos' security problems because the ambitions of other near-
by Communist powers must also be considered. China has been looking 
hungrily at Laos for a long time. The Soviet Union also has a lively 
interest in Laos. Under the terms of the Geneva Accords the Soviet Union 
and Great Britain are Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Convention on Laos and 
Moscow tries to appear to be the responsible mediator. It is suspected, 
however, that the Soviets are more interested in increasing their influence

over the Neo Lao Hak Sat (NLHS) which is the political organization of the 
Pathet Lao, than in establishing any serious dialogue between the NLHS and 
the RLG aimed at a political settlement. Certainly the recent affair of 
Soviet Ambassador to Laos, Viktor Minin, hints at this possibility. In 
February, Minin, with Souvanna Phouma's agreement, traveled to the NLHS 
stronghold in Sam Neua to talk with NLHS Chairman, Prince Souphanouvong. 
His alleged purpose was to persuade Souphanouvong to begin talks with his 
half-brother, Souvanna Phouma. Rather than preparing the ground for an 
RLG-NLHS dialogue, Minin's trip was almost immediately followed by a major 
Pathet Lao-North Vietnamese offensive, which is still going on. A real 
dialogue has yet to begin. 
Increasing its influence over the Pathet Lao is probably not Moscow's 
only reason for moving into Laos, although it may be the most compelling. 
Moscow probably believes that the Pathet Lao has a brighter political 
future in the long run than the politicians and generals who lead the present 
government in Vientiane. However, Moscow also has another objective: to 
pre-empt Chinese influence in Laos. And, of course, a Pathet Lao govern-
ment in Laos would give the USSR a foothold in the center of Southeast Asia. 
China's view of Laos appears to be the one she traditionally casts on 
any small neighbor: potential food for the tiger. In September 1968 Peking, 
without permission from the RLG, resumed road building in northern Laos after 
a lapse of five years. By late January 1969 the Chinese had completed a 
motorable road between the Chinese-Laotian border town of Batene and Muong 
Sai, a Laotian town 70 kilometers from the border. It took two more months 
to push the next section of the road through difficult terrain to a point 
10 kilometers northeast of Muong Sai. That branch of the Chinese-built 
road will lead into North Vietnam near Dienbienphu; the other branch will 
go south and west and could be extended south to the Mekong River and into 
Thailand. 
Estimates of the number of Chinese involved in this venture range from 
two to ten regular Chinese army (PLA) battalions, equipped with mobile anti-
aircraft batteries, who are assigned to defend from 2,000 to 5,000 Chinese 
coolies and engineers working on the roads. There are also reports of PLA 
fighting units in northwest Laos with estimates on their numbers also 
widely varied. Support for the Chinese forces in Laos comes from Yunnan 
Province, from which hundreds of Chinese trucks pass into Laos monthly 
carrying food and construction materials and, presumably, military equip-
ment for the PLA units in the area. 
Peking's possible reasons for being in Laos include her search for more 
territory, but there are others, as well: she may be seeking to create 
both a buffer zone and a sphere of influence in the region in anticipation 
of a settlement in Vietnam; she may be striving to prevent further growth 
of North Vietnam's influence with the Pathet Lao which the great number of 
PAVN regulars deployed in Laos gives to Hanoi; Peking may be establishing

a road link to old route 46 which runs southwest of Muong Sai and has long 
been used by Thai Communist terrorists to move into and out of Thailand. 
The new road system could also be intended to facilitate shipment of Chinese 
supplies to the Thai Communists, to the Chinese and North Vietnamese laborers 
keeping the Ho Chi Minh Trail operating, and to PAVN and Viet Cong units 
fighting in South Vietnam. 
The prolonged fighting has propelled the nation into a vicious cycle, 
for as long as the war continues the RLG is compelled to keep up a large 
military establishment which now consumes 50% of the national budget. The 
growth of this military establishment and the readiness of some to profit 
by built-in opportunities for special privileges, law evasion and cor-
ruption have discouraged the Laotian people and made cynics of many among 
the younger element in politics. The swelling Swiss bank accounts of the 
elderly, non-military upper classes, who make up the Laotian ruling elite, 
have further alienated a vital group -- the men in their thirties who are 
at the beginning of their political careers. 
The small nation of Laos lives in very real peril. The most immediate 
menace comes from North Vietnam, already on the scene with 40,000 troops. 
But Communist China's thrust over the border with roads, laborers and her 
own troops shows she is as firmly committed as Hanoi to territorial expansion 
and subversion. And the Soviet Union stands in the wings. Any Asian knows 
that events in the Southeast Asian area will be largely determined by what 
happens in Vietnam, and Laos' future is no exception. Failure to reach 
peace in Vietnam will lead to additional fighting in Laos, and a peace in 
Vietnam without reference to Laos will surely mean more trouble for Laos, 
whose Communistoccupied areas will not readily submit to the discipline 
of any central government except one controlled by the Pathet Lao.

Over the Horizon 
Stirrings in Laos 
Pallet Lao, the 'leftist Lao-
tian forces entrenched in the 
eastern half of the country, 
have been stepping up their 
military and political activi-
ties as the world uneasily 
watches the slow progress of 
the Paris talks. 
Their recent 
behavior 
would seem 'to 
show that they k . 
are planning' !T? 
to settle the 
Muffled civil 
war in Laos 
by the same 
tactics aspf, 
those employ , 
ed by North 
Vietnam and the National 
Liberation Front in South 
Vietnam. 
On Sept. 21 last year, just 
10 days before the United 
States announced the com-
plete suspension of the bomb-
ing of North Vietnam, Radio, 
Pathet Lao declared that if, 
the U.S. halted the bombing 
of the "liberated areas" in 
Laos, conditions favorable for 
distussing the Laotian issue 
would be created. 
About three weeks after the 
complete suspension of the 
American bombing of North 
Yietnam, Radio Hanoi report-

ei the new Pathet Lao pont'. 
pi tenet to the effect that 
Fathet Lao aims at setting up 
a "democratic, national coati-
t on Government" in colla-
boration with "patriotic, na-
t onal forces" in Laos. 
Pathet Lao's call for the 
s ispension of bombing is 
identical with Hanoi's appeal 
while their slogan for a *na-
t onal coalition Government 
is an exact replica .of the ap-
real made by the NLF in 
South Vietnam. 
After the American bomb. 
Ing halt against the north, 
owever, U.S. air attacks on 
tie "liberated areas" of Laos 
were reportedly tripled in in-
t.nsity, presumably because 
of the increased need to 
disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail 
hilowing the bombing halt 
against North Vietnam. 
Last January, Prince Soup-
lanouvong, who is the leader 
t) the Pathet Lao, again called 
f )r. the suspension of U.S. 
bombing of Laos' "liberated 
areas" as a condition for 
peace and threatened to in. 
tmsify Pathet Lao military 
activities "until peace mated.
aizes." 
The U.S., however, cannot 
le expected to halt the 
bombing of the Ho Chi Minh 
Trail that runs through the 
"liberated area" in view of 
the uneasy situation in South 
Vietnam. 
Thus, the Pathet Lao forces, 
With the support of 40,000 
North Vietnamese troops, are 
stepping up guerrilla attacks 
against the Royal Laotian 
region under, Premier Souvan-
na Phouma. Their tactics re-
semble those of North Viet-
nam and the NLF in South 
Vietnam, whose Vietnam War 
strategy consists of "breaking 
the military balance" and 
"winning the political war." 
In another significant de-
velopment, Y u e Tai-hong, 
Communist China's first high-
ranking diplomat to return to 
an overseas post following 4 
long diplomatic hiatus, resum-
ed his assignment early last 
month as counselor in the 
Communist Chinese Embassy

Soviet ambassador to the Lao-

Pathet Lao headquarters in

One view is that the question 
of Laos might finally enter the 
peace talks in Paris at the stage 
at which the participants had

cease-fire. 
Before the talks reach this 
stage, however, the Communists 
appear determined to solidify 
their hold over vast stretches of 
the Laotian jungle. 
During the current "dry-season 
offensive," they have knocked 
out small government installa-
tions from the northern to the 
southern provinces, have built 
new roads and ambushed vehi-
cles on old roads leading to im-
portant towns in the Mekong 
River lowlands. The Commu-
nists, spearheaded by an esti-

on Laos that would enable the

Peace has its dangers 
CPYRGHT 
FROM A CORRESPONDENT LATELY IN LAOS 
" What we want is an independent life, 
blessed equally by both America and Red 
China. We must build together a peace-
ful, independent, democratic, united, 
neutral and prosperous Laos." So runs the. 
manifesto just published by a group of 
right-wing politicians in Vientiane. 1 
Their leader, Mr Chao Sopsaisana, vice-
chairman of the national assembly, has 
no friend in the past of the neutral-
it posed on Laos by the 1962 Geneva 
agreement, and certainly no supporter of I 
moves to find a fresh basis for co-opera-
tion with the communist Pathet Lao. But 
the Vietnam peace talks raise the possib-
ility of a new attempt to reunify Laos. If ; 
it happens these conservatives do not wish 
to be caught with their trousers down. ; 
"We have no political organisation to ; 
match the communists," Chao Sopsaisana 
told this correspondent in Vientiane. " We 
may well have to face a general election ; 
in Laos before 197i, We must now set up 
3. political movement of all Buddhists andi 
ion-communists." Ile is trying, with syni-1 
lathy from the Americans, and support 
.rorn certain politicians and generals. 
These are mostly relatively young men,1 
n their forties, professing opposition to! 
'injustice, corruption and inefficiency; 
rkomitie royal government headed by 
Prince Souvanna Phounia. But there isi 
little sign that they have captured the, 
dealism of the still younger men, gener-! 
31Iy disgusted with their elders?including 
most of those involved in Laotian politics 
;ince the early 196os?and with a good ! 
leal to be disgusted about. Power politics 
lave propelled the Laotians abruptly into i 
the twentieth century, and mountains of:: 
American money. Economic aid in 1967-'! 
:38 amounted to $63 million (for a popula-
tion of some 1.5 million under royal 
government control). A fair part has gone 
to line the pockets and Swiss bank 
accounts of the numerous potentates who 
employees of the Soviet news agency 
Novosti in Vientiane can be seen distribu-
ting in the streets anti-Chinese literature 
in French. One of the booklets, entitled 
" DuplicitC," describes Chinese policies 
as " irresponsible and insane." 
The Chinese are now building a road, 
:through northern Laos, to link Yunnan 
with Dien Bien Phu, just across North 
Vietnam's western border. They are 
!pernianently represented in Pathet Lao. 
territory by a consulate. Yet the Pathet! 
!Lao has given its full approval to the, 
!invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Russians, 
evidently can still pull strings. 
: The royal government claims the Pathet 
'Lao threat would quickly evaporate if 
'North Vietnamese units withdrew from 
Laos. It reckons they total 18,000 combat 
troops and over 21,000 men in support 
.units. They have been responsible for 
the communist military successes of the. 
last four years. Recently North Viet-
namese reinforcements are reported to 
have come in from South Vietnam. Com-
munist troops have also recently been. 
:supplied with 140 mm rockets and other 
new weaponry. Meanwhile the royal army, 
.now some 75,000 men strong, has 
reorganised with American assistance and 
advisers. Abler officers have been 
given responsible command. American' 
air force support has increased greatly? 
since the attpckx on North Vietnam were 
halted. 
Events in Laos are bound to be influ-
enced by what happens to Vietnam. A' 
failure to reach peace there will probably' 
lead to more fighting in Laos. But peace, 
:in Vietnam may not mean peace in Laos:

:significance, the large areas bordering on,: 
China and North Vietnam now occupied: 
by the communists will not easily return 
to the control of any central government,.' 
except a Pathet Lao one. 
make up the Latian rei ing class. 
No Laotian politician, right-wing or 
Pathet Lao, could survive if he did not 
pay at least lip service to the need for 
national reunification. But neither of the 
warring parties is prepared to work for 
union except on its own terms. The royal 
'government unrealistically asks Prince 
Souphanouvong and three of his left-wing 
! colleagues simply to endorse the old tri-
partite formula, return to Vientiane and. 
:take up their vacant cabinet seats, 
as if nothing had happened in the six 
!years since the left-wing ministers fled 
from a right-wing coup. (The Pathet Lao, 
:in fact, now &:introls at least half the 
:territory, although somewhat less than 
half the povulation.) And except for 
Souvanna Phouma himself it is hard to 
name anyone in the non-communist ruling 
group who can be considered a neutralist. 
Some of the neutralists have joined the 
Pathet La.o, as a separate group, and may? 
now demand representation in a coalition! 
government. 
The Russians could do much to help 
Prince Souvanna Phounia (for whom 
they have a great liking) out of his predic-
ament, if they wanted! to. But there is no 
real evidence to suggest that they do. Far 
from wishing to mediate they seem to. 
be principally anxious to rebuild their 
,bridges to the Pathet Lao. This would 
explain the unexpected recent visit of 
the Soviet ambassador in vientiane to 
Prince Souphanouvong's headquarters .in 
Sam Neua, in northern Laos. 
They evidently do not wish to create, 
the impression of being in collusion with! 
the Americans over a possible settlement.: 
And they believe that the Pathet Lao has 
a brighter future as a political movement 
than the conservative politicians and 
generals in Vientiane, whose fortunes may 
depend on how long the Americans 
choose to support them. Not that they . 
want Chinese-sponsored disorder. Russian

Foreign Affairs: How the War Must End 
By C. L. SULZBERGER 
SAIGON?There can be no 
valid setucmcmof he VIeLoani 
war that does not specifically 
include Laos and Cambodia. 
? Otherwise Southeast Asia 
would face, the following para-
? doxical situation: Communist 
? troops could withdraw from 
South Vietnam but continue do 
facto occupation of eastern 
, Laos and eastern Cambodia. 
^ They now control the entire 
strip running from the Laotian 
border of China to the Cam-
bodian Parrot's Beak that points 
right at Saigon. 
Therefore no basis for evac-
t. uating foreign forces from 
South Vietnam can be devised 
that does not also include 
evacuation of foreign forces 
from Laos and Cambodia. If 
there is to be a return to the 
formula of the 1954 Geneva 
agreement governing Vietnam 
and Cambodia, there must also 
be a return to the 1962 Geneva 
agreement neutralizing Laos. 
Threats to ,Salgon 
Any other settlement would 
be meaningless. It might pro-
vide for restoring peace to 
South Vietnam, but the Saigon 
regime would be permanently 
? threatened not only by the 
access routes from North Viet-

the Sihanouk trail through

This problem is so acute that 
the Paris Vietnam negotiations 
must ultimately be expanded to 
take in diplomatic representa-
tives from Laos and Cambodia. 
The Laotian situation is in-
creasingly bad. Hanoi, which 
has been violating the 1962 
agreement with mounting ef-
frontery, is now pushing its 
most serious drive into Laos 
since 1962-63. If it advances 
any further it will destroy the 
heartland of the Meo tribes. 
crumbling their especially dedi-
cated resistance. 
At the same time, the Ninth 
Vietcong Division (80 per cent 
North Vietnamese) is stationed 
in the Cambodian Parrot's 
Beak. Some strategists guess it. 
will eventually be committed 
with two other divisions sent 
through Cambodia in the pres-
ent offensive against Saigon. 
- Others speculate it will attack 
the provincial capital of Tay-
ninh. It is worth considering, 
however,- that Hanoi prefers to 
leave the Ninth just where it is. 
This menaces the Cambodian 
Government and prevents it 
from reaching accommodation 
with the United States and its 
allies. 
The Ninth Division alone is 
strong enough to overwhelm 
6 
deeply worried. There are Viet-
cong and Vietminh [meaning 
North Vietnamese] infiltrating. 
If you look at a map near 
Mondolkiri is Sen Mororom, is 
0 Raing. After 0 Raing is 
Mount Nam Lean and there 
are plenty of Vietcong and Viet-
minh there. If you go up to 
Ratanakiri you will see Laban 
Siek. Farther north is Bo 
Khanh. Let us stop there?a 
few meters from Bo Khanh. It 
is full of Vietcong and Viet-
minh." 
Sihanouk's Dilemma 
These are Sihanouk's first de-
tailed admissions of the Com-
munist military advance into 
Cambodia, which is now their 
outright sanctuary against Sai-
gon and U.S. troops. The Com-
munist military presence is 
even more extensive than the 
Prince acknowledges and Siha-
nouk doesn't know how to get 
them out. 
Sihanouk still proclaims Cam-
bodia has "only four enemies?
Thailand, Laos, Vietnam [South] 
and the United States." But he 
hints he is prepared for accom-
modation with all of them if 
they will only recognize Cam-
bodia's existing frontiers. He 
insists he will "always support" 
the Vietcong "in their just 
a diplomatic solution to this 
impasse. Both Bangkok and 
Saigon have recently indicated 
willingness to recognize pres-
ent Cambodian frontiers, thus,, 
abandoning their own previous 
claims. , One suspects U.S. i 
prompting. Furthermore, Nixon 
sent Sihanouk a personal letter ' 
and encouraged Robert McNa-
mara and David Rockefeller to - 
contact him. 
But Sihanouk complains that ; 
Nixon has not yet granted "un-
conditional recognition of my 
frontiers" and adds: "Whether; 
I swing toward the right or Walk 
depends on me alone." He does, 
of course, have the alternative 
of temporarily resigning?which 
he has done before?and letting 
General Lon Nol, the pro-West-
em Acting Premier, take respon-
sibility for a difficult transition, 
What is also taking place in 
Laos?where there is heavier 
North Vietnamese military oc-
cupation?is vitally important' 
to South Vietnam. There can be 
no final settlement here until 
there is settlement as well in 
Its westerly neighbors South-

From Fred Ermry, lately in Vientiane 
OSTENTATIOUS RULE 
1111101111MInt does seem that precious 
little has been done by Prince Souvanna 
Houma in the way of political galvani-
zation during the past seven years. In 
the face of many frustrations the inclina-
tion is not to rock the boat. 
The proclamation of the Lao Patriotic 
Front's political programme moved ,hitn 
,to respond with a political statement on 
New Year's Eve in which he implored 
his countrymen "not to remain passive 
and take the easy way". Most observers 
estimate. however, that " government " 
as an entity beneficial to the people still 
means little more than it did seven years 
ago. , 
The Americans, meanwhile, have not 
'waited for peace to attempt efforts at 
economic development. While it is, true 
that U.S.A.I.D. props up the country 
with aid (excluding military) at some 
$58m. last year, moves have been made 
to, 'stimulate rice production. Some 
optimistic assessments reckon that self-
sufficiency could be hopod for next year, 
with even some rice exports in 1971. An 
American-backed purchasing agency is 
trying to make the short cut from sub-
sistence to a market economy without 
the intercession of money lenders, and 
may succeed. Timber exploitation has 
been stepped up considerably, and in the 
towns there has been transformation 
since the "village days" of ,only 10 
years ago. Cars taxis and motor cycles 
?nearly all Japanese?fill the streets. 
The question is. how much of this 
advance do the people associate with 
government and how much with the 
Americans. An honest answer is: The 
Americans "?and therein lies a great 
problem. 
There have been radical changes in 
administering American aid since the 
1950s, younger Laotians are? asserting 
themselves in economic planning; and 
there is a sense of mission. But there 
is far to go?and nowhere farther, in 
the eyes of the young .men, than .in 
correcting the flagrant luxury and otten-
tation of the lives of the ruling families 
and cliques. It is generals, government 
ministers and high officials who have 
built all the stylish villas for renting to 
the many foreigners. 
It may well be true the future of Laos 
will depend more on external than in-
ternal decisions. But a healthier internal 
situation would obviously help to decide 
that future in more positive terms. It 
seems clear that the Americans, in return 
for their own withdrawal from Vietnam, 
will insist on North Vietnamese with-
drawal from the Ho Chi Minh trails 
complex. But it seems doubtful that the. 
!North Vietnamese will leave northern 
Laos, where people have so long been 
directed towards Hanoi rather than 
, Vientiane. ? ? 
In this sense all 'depends on the 
lUnited States, Russia, 'and of course 
China. Can they improve on the present 
miserable reality?that a buffer .istate 
is only a cover for hostile partition.?

Compiled from Newspapers and Periodicals  
On Laotian Protests at Hanoi Aggression 
Continuing military activity of the North Vietnamese in Laos 
has caused the Laotian Prime Minister, Prince Souvanna Phouma, to 
protest to the co-chairmen of the 1962 Geneva Conference, Britain and 
the Soviet Union. The Protest, published in Laos on 19 March 1969, 
has been circulated by Britain to other countries which took part in 
the Conference - Cambodia, Nortil Vietnam, France, Laos, China, South 
Vietnam, the United States, Burma, Canada, India, Poland and Thailand. 
Britain has also suggested to the Soviets that the International Con-
trol Commission (ICC) for Laos (India, Poland and Canada) be asked to 
report on the situation. 
Although the Geneva Agreement provided for the withdrawal of for-
eign troops from Laos and guaranteed her neutrality, the Laotians have 
frequently protested at the North Vietnamese military presence. Be-
cause of the refusal of the Communist Pathet Lao to allow the ICC to 
investigate areas under their control, the strength and composition of 
the guerrillas could not be assessed, but Prince Souvanna Phouma gave 
an estimate on 24 October 1968, that there were now some 40,000 to 
50,000 North Vietnamese troops in his country, either fighting with 
the Pathet Lao or protecting the Ho Chi Minh trail (the route through 
Laotian territory by which the North Vietnamese have been infiltrating 
men and supplies into South Vietnam). 
All foreign troops were supposed to leave Laos after the 1962 
Agreement, and although there were then some thousands of North Viet-
namesein the country, only 40 North Vietnamese civilian technicians de-
parted from Laos via the checkpoints set up by the ICC. 
Both Hanoi and the Pathet Lao have since denied that any North 
Vietnamese men or materiel are in Laos, but in September 1964. three 
North Vietnamese soldiers were captured. At Souvanna Phouma's request 
the ICC inspected documents found on the prisoners, considered their 
statements and confirmed their nationality and military status. 
In March 1965 nine more prisoners were captured at Dong Hene in 
Southern Laos. The evidence they provided formed the basis of a ma-
jority report published by the ICC on 22 August 1966, which amounted 
to a major indictment of North Vietnamese intervention in Laos. (Po-
land refused to be associated with this.) 
In an article published by the Far Eastern Economic Review on 
21 November 1968, Guy Hannoteaux, who had been captured and held for 
a month by the Pathet Lao, confirmed the existence of a "sizeable num-
ber" of North Vietnamese in Pathet Lao-held territory. He spoke to 
one who said he was North Vietnamese "like the others you have seen 
in this camp;" he had come to Laos only ten days previously. Accord-
ing to Hannoteaux, it was generally the North Vietnamese who directed 
Pathet Lao operations. '

May 1969 
ECONOMIC STAGNATION IN CUBA  
After an initial period of growth and expansion, the Cuban economy has 
stagnated, in spite of the approximately $350 million in subsidies and 
credits which Cuba receives annually from the Soviet Union. Since 1957, 
the record pre-revolutionary year, the Cuban Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
has risen by an average of only 1.5 per cent per year -- one of the poorest 
records in the region. Since the population has steadily grown, this means 
that per capita consumption has declined 15 to 20 per cent in the past decade. 
Change in Economic Objectives  
During its ten years in power, the Castro regime has changed its 
economic policies and objectives. Soon after taking over the government, 
Castro announced broad and ambitious plans to achieve rapid agrarian reform 
and agricultural diversification, rapid industrialization, nationalization 
of the economy, redistribution of income, improved living conditions and 
other benefits for the lower classes. After trying, without success, to 
attain so many objectives simultaneously for the first two to three years, 
the regime ordered a change in priorities. 
In 1963, after several disastrous sugar harvests and other economic 
failures, the government gave highest priority to increasing sugar pro-
duction, while its earlier goals for industrialization and an increase in 
popular welfare were postponed until after 1970, the year the regime 
expected to meet its goal of a ten-million-ton sugar harvest. Emphasis has 
also been given to cattle raising, with the aim of developing livestock 
products for export purposes. The year 1963 marked the low point in the 
transition of the Cuban economy to a socialist structure. Since then, 
Cuba's GNP has grown at an average annual rate of less than two per cent, 
or about the same as the growth in population. 
Problems of the Economy  
The major reason for the general lack of economic progress in Cuba has 
been gross mismanagement of the economy. Most of those who now belong to 
the managerial class are poorly educated and inexperienced, while the system 
itself gives little authority to lower echelon managers and excessive 
authority to higher level officials. The administrative structure has been 
frequently reorganized and personnel has been freely shifted about, with 
consequent duplication and conflict in authority. There has been a 
perpetual shortage of labor in the agricultural sector, while at the same 
time a labor surplus has existed in other sectors. The U.S. trade embargo 
has forced Cuba to import capital goods to replace U.S.-built equipment and 
so has limited Cuba's ability to import other goods. And even this limited 
ability must be sustained by large infusions of economic aid from Communist 
countries, most of it from the Soviet Union. In spite of government efforts 
to increase the value of exports, there has been a decline. This is the 
result of a lower volume of sugar exports as well as a drop in non-sugar 
exports because of production problems, increased domestic demand and the 
loss of U.S. markets.

Sugar Production  
Current prospects indicate that the 1969 sugar crop will not be much 
larger than -- if as large as -- the 5.2 million tons of 1968, and Castro 
himself has admitted the crop has "gone badly." During a recent tour of 
Camaguey Province, a major sugar-producing area, Castro declared the delays 
in harvesting this year's crop could cost Cuba ten million dollars in 
foreign exchange, the same amount he hoped to earn by sugar rationing which 
was started the first of this year. Far from reaching the nine-million-ton-
goal originally planned for 1969, this year's harvest should yield 51-- million 
tons, according to Castro's own estimates at the beginning of the year. Even 
that figure now appears unlikely since no production statistics have so far 
been published, although in the past the harvesting of one or two million tons 
early in the season has been widely publicized. Furthermore, it is said that 
preparations to meet the 1970 target of 10 million tons are interfering with 
the current harvest, with rumors that sugar from the current crop may even be 
concealed in order to appear to increase the yield next year. 
According to the official Communist Party newspaper Granma, Cubans must 
work harder to bring in the 1969 harvest and to cope with other economic 
tasks. A fresh drive in harvesting and planting was begun on 30 March and 
is to last until 1 May. This custom was started in 1966, when Castro 
proposed the Easter holidays be replaced by a week of intensive work in 
honor of his victory at Playa Giron. In 1967 Playa Giron week as it is now 
called was extended to two weeks, and in 1968 it was extended to a month. 
Now Castro has suggested there be no public holidays at all between October 
1969 and July 1970 in order to meet economic goals. Such a drive, however, 
is in addition to the now regular mass mobilizations of thousands of citizens 
who are required to spend at least a month between February and May in the 
harvesting of sugarcane. All other activity -- governmental, business and 
educational -- suffers as a result, as it must either cease or slow down 
during this period. 
Dependence on the Soviet Union  
In early February the 1969 Soviet-Cuban trade protocol was signed, 
including the grant of long-term credit to finance the Cuban trade deficit, 
presumably not only to cover the deficit for this year, but also whatever 
may be necessary to cover the unfinanced protion of past trade deficits. 
Thus Cuba may well need more Soviet aid than last year when it totaled 
$328 million. (The 1968 trade deficit was larger than planned because Cuba 
shipped considerably less than the 2.7 million tons of sugar required by 
last year's protocol. Thus her deficit is estimated to be close to $400 
million, or an increase of $150 million over the 1967 deficit.) 
Although Soviet exports to Cuba are not expected to increase in the cur-
rent year, the USSR is expected to continue to supply considerable machinery 
and equipment, including that needed for Soviet-aided projects, raw materials, 
foodstuffs and almost all of Cuba's petroleum. Even if Soviet petroleum

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000500110001-9 
deliveries to Cuba were to increase over the 1968 total of 5.3 million tons, 
there is no indication that it would allow the lifting of fuel rationing, 
which Cuba has had for over a year. 
The 1969 trade protocol was signed within the framework of a six-year 
agreement reached in 1964. There is no indication the Cubans have obtained 
any firm Soviet commitment for the years after that basic agreement expires 
in 1970. Obviously Castro's need for an assured subsidy will continue to 
be as great as ever, especially since economic planning includes further 
mechanization and diversification of Cuban agriculture and general expansion 
requiring huge capital investments. 
Dismal Outlook for Average Cuban  
In general, the average consumer is faring poorly under the Cuban 
revolution. Per capita consumption of goods and services has declined about 
15 per cent since 1957. Except for landless farm workers and urban service 
workers, who now receive higher wages and increased health and education 
benefits, consumption levels for most other groups have declined, and high 
income groups have lost nearly everything. Acute shortages of almost all 
types of consumer goods have developed, and the people now must queue up 
daily for many essentials. Prices in the controlled retail market are 
forty per cent above 1957, and prices in the widespread black market are 
five times higher than legal prices. Because the supply of goods and 
services is expected to grow only slightly faster than the population, 
there will apparently be little improvement in living conditions for the 
average Cuban in the foreseeable future. Added to this is the fact that 
the average citizen can no longer find temporary escape in such simple 
pleasures as playing the lottery or visiting his neighborhood cantina, 
since the regime considers such past-times out of line with economic austerity 
and its concept of the "new Communist man." All told, there is little in 
this bleak situation to appeal to would-be instigators or followers of the 
revolution elsewhere in Latin America. And, indeed, the widespread admiration 
which the Cuban revolution once inspired in Latin America is now almost 
entirely dissipated. The cause is not hard to find: the Cuban revolution 
has simply failed to live up to its promise.

ECONOMIC STAGNATION IN CUBA  
After an initial period of growth and expansion, the Cuban economy has 
stagnated, in spite of the approximately $350 million in subsidies and 
credits which Cuba receives annually from the Soviet Union. Since 1957, 
the record pre-revolutionary year, the Cuban Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
has risen by an average of only 1.5 per cent per year -- one of the poorest 
records in the region. Since the population has steadily grown, this means 
that per capita consumption has declined 15 to 20 per cent in the past decade. 
Change in Economic Objectives  
During its ten years in power, the Castro regime has changed its 
economic policies and objectives. Soon after taking over the government, 
Castro announced broad and ambitious plans to achieve rapid agrarian reform 
and agricultural diversification, rapid industrialization, nationalization 
of the economy, redistribution of income, improved living conditions and 
other benefits for the lower classes. After trying, without success, to 
attain so many objectives simultaneously for the first two to three years, 
the regime ordered a change in priorities. 
In 1963, after several disastrous sugar harvests and other economic 
failures, the government gave highest priority to increasing sugar pro-
duction, while its earlier goals for industrialization and an increase in 
popular welfare were postponed until after 1970, the year the regime 
expected to meet its goal of a ten-million-ton sugar harvest. Emphasis has 
also been given to cattle raising, with the aim of developing livestock 
products for export purposes. The year 1963 marked the low point in the 
transition of the Cuban economy to a socialist structure. Since then, 
Cuba's GNP has grown at an average annual rate of less than two per cent, 
or about the same as the growth in population. 
Problems of the Economy  
The major reason for the general lack of economic progress in Cuba has 
been gross mismanagement of the economy. Most of those who now belong to 
the managerial class are poorly educated and inexperienced, while the system 
itself gives little authority to lower echelon managers and excessive 
authority to higher level officials. The administrative structure has been 
frequently reorganized and personnel has been freely shifted about, with 
consequent duplication and conflict in authority. There has been a 
perpetual shortage of labor in the agricultural sector, while at the same 
time a labor surplus has existed in other sectors. The U.S. trade embargo 
has forced Cuba to import capital goods to replace U.S.-built equipment and 
so has limited Cuba's ability to import other goods. And even this limited 
ability must be sustained by large infusions of economic aid from Communist 
countries, most of it from the Soviet Union. In spite of government efforts 
to increase the value of exports, there has been a decline. This is the 
result of a lower volume of sugar exports as well as a drop in non-sugar 
exports because of production problems, increased domestic demand and the 
loss of U.S. markets.

honor of his victory at Playa Giron. In 1967 Playa Giron week as it is now 
called was extended to two weeks, and in 1968 it was extended to a month. 
Now Castro has suggested there be no public holidays at all between October 
1969 and July 1970 in order to meet economic goals. Such a drive, however, 
is in addition to the now regular mass mobilizations of thousands of citizens 
who are required to spend at least a month between February and May in the 
harvesting of sugarcane. All other activity -- governmental, business and 
educational -- suffers as a result, as it must either cease or slow down 
during this period. 
Dependence on the Soviet Union  
In early February the 1969 Soviet-Cuban trade protocol was signed, 
including the grant of long-term credit to finance the Cuban trade deficit, 
presumably not only to cover the deficit for this year, but also whatever 
may be necessary to cover the unfinanced protion of past trade deficits. 
Thus Cuba may well need more Soviet aid than last year when it totaled 
$328 million. (The 1968 trade deficit was larger than planned because Cuba 
shipped considerably less than the 2.7 million tons of sugar required by 
last year's protocol. Thus her deficit is estimated to be close to $400 
million, or an increase of $150 million over the 1967 deficit.) 
Although Soviet exports to Cuba are not expected to increase in the cur-
rent year, the USSR is expected to continue to supply considerable machinery 
and equipment, including that needed for Soviet-aided projects, raw materials, 
foodstuffs and almost all of Cuba's petroleum. Even if Soviet petroleum

deliveries to Cuba were to increase over the 1968 total of 5.3 million tons, 
there is no indication that it would allow the lifting of fuel rationing, 
which Cuba has had for over a year. 
The 1969 trade protocol was signed within the framework of a six-year 
agreement reached in 1964. There is no indication the Cubans have obtained 
any firm Soviet commitment for the years after that basic agreement expires 
in 1970. Obviously Castro's need for an assured subsidy will continue to 
be as great as ever, especially since economic planning includes further 
mechanization and diversification of Cuban agriculture and general expansion 
requiring huge capital investments. 
Dismal Outlook for Average Cuban  
In general, the average consumer is faring poorly under the Cuban 
revolution. Per capita consumption of goods and services has declined about 
15 per cent since 1957. Except for landless farm workers and urban service 
workers, who now receive higher wages and increased health and education 
benefits, consumption levels for most other groups have declined, and high 
income groups have lost nearly everything. Acute shortages of almost all 
types of consumer goods have developed, and the people now must queue up 
daily for many essentials. Prices in the controlled retail market are 
forty per cent above 1957, and prices in the widespread black market are 
five times higher than legal prices. Because the supply of goods and 
services is expected to grow only slightly faster than the population, 
there will apparently be little improvement in living conditions for the 
average Cuban in the foreseeable future. Added to this is the fact that 
the average citizen can no longer find temporary escape in such simple 
pleasures as playing the lottery or visiting his neighborhood cantina, 
since the regime considers such past-times out of line with economic austerity 
and its concept of the "new Communist man." All told, there is little in 
this bleak situation to appeal to would-be instigators or followers of the 
revolution elsewhere in Latin America. And, indeed, the widespread admiration 
which the Cuban revolution once inspired in Latin America is now almost 
entirely dissipated. The cause is not hard to find: the Cuban revolution 
has simply failed to live up to its promise.

ESTANCAMIENTO ECONOMIC? EN CUBA  
Tras un periodo inicial de crecimiento y expansiOn, 
la economia,cubana se ha paralizado a pesar de los sub-
sidi9s y creditos que con'valor aprwsimado qe 350 millones 
de dolares recibe cada aflo de la Union Sovietica. Desde 
1957, alio extraordinario de la era pz.revolucionaria, el 
Producto Nacional Bruto de Cuba (PNB) ha promediado un 
agmento de uno y meg() por ciento anual, una,de las cifras 
mas bajas de la region. Dado que la poblacion ha aumentado 
regularmente, el porcentaje significa que el consum9 per 
capita ha decrecido en un veinte por ciento en los ultaMos 
diez anos. 
Cambios en los objetivos econOmicos. 
. El regimp de Castro ha modificado su politica y 
objetivos economicos durante los diez afios que ha permanecido 
en el poder. A raiz de asumir el control del gobierno, 
Castro dio a conocer programas vast9s y ambiciosos encami-, 
nados a lograr la reforma agraria rapl.da, la diversificacion 
de la agricgltura, la industrializacion del pe,..fs, la na-
cionalizacion de la economfa, la redistribucion de los 
ingresos, la mejora de las condiciones de vida y otas 
medidas beneficiosas para las clases pobres., Despues de 
intentar infructuosamente de alcanzar simultaneaments tan 
varialas metas en los,primeros dos o tres anos, el regimen 
ordeno una modificacion de las prioridades. 
En 1963, tras algunas zafras azucareras clesastrosas 
y,otros fracasos economicos, el gol3ierno otorgo la prioridad 
mas alta al aument9 de la produccion azucarera, abandonando 
la industr4lizacion y el mejoramiento del bienestar del pueblo 
hasta despues de 1970, alio en que el gobierno espera alcanzar 
la meta que se fijo: la zafra azucvera de diez millones de 
toneladas. Asimismo, se ha pues,to enfasis en la ?lila de 
ganado con vista a la exportacion. 
El alio de 1963 marc6 el punto ms bajo en la transiciOn 
de la economfa cubana hacia una estructura socialista. Desde

crecimiento de la poblacion. 
Problemas de la economra. 
La causa principal de la falta de progreso,econcimico 
general de Cuba ha sido la malfsima administracion de la 
economla. La mayorla de los dlirigentes son personas 
inexpertas y de poca preparacion, y por otra parte, el 
sistema le otorga poca autoridad a los funcionarios de 
segunda categoria mientras que le concede excesivo poder 
a los dirigentes principales. 
La estructura administrativa ha sufrido numerosas 
reorganizaciones, transfiriendose al,personal de un lugar 
a otro con la consiguiente duplicacion y conflict? de 
autoridad. Ha habido una constante escasez de mano de 
obra en el sector agrIcola, mientras que en otros sectores 
se ha registrado exceso de empleados. El embargo de los 
Estados Unidos ha forzado a Cuba a importar bienes capitales 
para r;emplazar los equipos de manufactura norteamericana, 
limitandose asf la capacidad para importar otros bienes. 
Y aun esta capacidad limitada necesita ser sostenida por las 
grandes dosis de ayuda exterior iue Cubs recibe de los parses 
comunistas, mayormente de la Union Sovietica. 
A pesar de los esfuerzos del gobierno por aumentar las 
exportaci9nes estas han disminufdo,a consecuencia de la 
disminucion en los embarques de azoa11 y de otros productos 
por los probleTas en la produccion,e1 aumento de la demanda 
interna y la perdida de los mercados norteamericanos.

Las pvspectivas actuales indican que la zafra de 
1969 no sera mayor que las 5,200,000 toneladas logradas en 
1968... sI es que se llega a.esta cifra. El propio Castro 
ha admitido que .1a zafra no marcha bien."

posit? de alcanzar las metas economicas. Sin embargo esa

Cuban AgLizaz0trare?Ten 
!ears Under Castro CPYRGHT 
Although Cuban farms have changed 
drastically over the past decade 
sugar remains the No. 1 crop?
and the mainstay of the economy. 
By WILBUR F. BUCK 
Foreign Regional A nalysis Division 
Economic Research Service' 
This January 1, Fidel Castro's Government observed its 
10th anniversary?a suitable vantage point from which to 
review the major events in Cuba's agricultural development 
under the present regime. 
Although the decade has been a period of significant 
change in the political, social, and economic structure of 
Cuba, the change has not necessarily meant progress. Tan-
gible benefits to the populace?such as free schools, free 
medical services, and minimal reths?have been offset by such 
negative factors as increased food costs and severe rationing 
of food, clothing, gasoline, and other daily requisites. 
Undcr Castro, Cuba's gross national product has risen from 
$2.7 billion in 1958 to nearly $3.0 billion in 1967. But per 
capita income has declined nearly 14 percent, to $368.; popu-
lation is now 8 million compared with 6.5 million in 1958. 
The Cuban economy continues to be weak, requiring massive 
aid from the Soviet Union (reportedly some $360 million, 
annually) plus additional assistance in the form of credits 
from Free World countries to stave off collapse. 
Cuba continues, almost fanatically, to focus its agriculture ? 
on sugar?a commodity that faces already-glutted world mar-
kets and low prices. The tourist business, once an important 
source of revenue, has disappeared. Migration of professional 
and other skilled citizens continues, and Cuba remains iso-
lated from nearly all its Hemisphere neighbors. 
Cuba has a preferential sugar-price agreement with the 
Soviet Union (incidentally the world's largest producer of 
sugar), but most payment is taken in the form of barter, 
leaving considerable doubt with respect to actual price. 
Castro's 10 years in office have produced a trade balance over-
whelmingly in favor of the Soviet Union, which has had 
the effect of mortgaging the Cuban sugar crops for years to 
come.

months of fighting, revolutionary forces led by Fidel Castro 
succeeded in toppling the Batista Government. On January 1, 
1959, Castro gained control of the government, and the 
people of Cuba?after long civil strife?welcomed the pros-
pects of change. 
The change they encountered exceeded their expectations. 
Premier Castro, promptly revealing his Communist sym-
?pathics, lost no time in calling for sweeping agricultural and 
political reforms. His government set out "to eradicate the 
effects of a colonial and imperialist heritage and to build a 
new life." 
The blueprint for Castro's agricultural programs appeared 
in the first Agrarian Reform law passed May 17, 1959. This 
legislation established the National Agrarian Reform Institute 
(IN RA), an agency to carry out government directives relat-
ing to agriculture. The agency promised land for the landless, 
arranged for expropriation of the large estates (with pro-
visions for indemnification), prohibited sharecropping, and 
endeavored to diversify agriculture to increase the island's 
food production and thereby conserve scarce foreign ex-
change. 
- 
Under INRA supervision, all lands in excess of 402 hec-
tares (about 1,000 acres) were promptly confiscated; in some 
instances 2-caballeria units (about 66 acres) were redistrib-
uted to former tenants. Few of the estate owners received 
indemnification. The estates were not subsequently dissolved 
as planned; rather the government began to operate the seized 
lands as Soviet-type state farms with hired workers. 
Confiscation of agricultural properties proved a severe blow 
to United States interests. U.S. holdings were said to equal 
about 35 percent of the entire sugar industry (some 39 of the 
157 sugar mills and their estates were U.S. owned), and U.S. 
interest was also heavy in rice production and cattle ranches. 
The few remaining large landholders were eliminated by 
the second Agrarian Reform law passed. October 3, 1963, 
which nationalized all farmlands in excess of 67 hectares (167 
acres). These properties were added to the established state 
farms. The remaining 200,000 small farmers were bracketed 
into the government-directed National Association of Small 
Farmers (ANAP). By mid-I960, the 1NRA had taken title 
to 60 percent of all Cuba's privately owned cropland. By 
1966, the number of small farmers reportedly had dwindled 
to 120,000. 
Loss of a U.S. good neighbor 
In the meantime, diplomatic and trade relations with the 
United States, Cuba's major trading partner, continued to 
deteriorate. In 1958, Cuba was shipping two-thirds of all its 
agricultural exports to the United States and purchasing a 
similar share of its agricultural needs from U.S. firms. Value 
of Cuban imports of U.S. farm products came to $145 million 
in 1958; wheat and flour, rice, pulses, meat, and lard were 
the principal import commodities. Cuba ranked seventh 
among U.S. foreign markets. 
Early in 1960, Castro's Government negotiated trade agree-
ments with many of the Communist countries and systemati-
cally began shifting its traditional trade with the United States 
in atiother direction. In less than a year, 70 percent of all 
Cuban agricultural exports were being routed to Communist 
country destinations.

U.S.-Cuban relations reached a clima7 when refineries owned 
by the United States and Britain re ised to process Soviet 
crude oil and their properties were seed by the Cuban Gov-
ernment. 
In February 1962 the United Stg es imposed a trade em-
bargo on Cuba and severed diploi atic relations. Thus, 60 
years of mutually beneficial trade I Aween the two countries 
went down the drain. 
The changing economic plan 
The early years of central plannin, 
were characterized by intensive eff&. 
food production and to expand tit+ 
for development during the years 
signed to increase the gross nationa 
cent a year, followed. In 1963, this r 
its impracticality became evident. 
The policy then reverted to emph sis on sugar production, 
frequently at the expense of rice an other food crops; com-
mercial development was limited to it dustries either connected 
with agriculture or to other enterr ises requiring relatively 
small investments. This policy rema'ls in force today. 
Agricultural development has incuded such programs as 
land reclamation, irrigation, pasture improvement, and de-
velopment of the cattle industry. Botween 1955 and 1965, 
cropland was increased by 22 percent and much of the waste-
land was returned to pasture. Acquisition of a number of bull-
dozers and other farm machinery in recent years reportedly 
has accelerated the rate of land improvement. 
A sugar dependency 
Cuba and sugar are synonymous; the island has always been 
highly dependent on this crop. 
In 1958 the sugar industry employed half a million workers 
and accounted for four-fifths of the value of all Cuban ex-
ports. At estimated 60 percent of the cropland was in sugar-
cane. Or a world basis, Cuba produced 15 percent of all the 
sugar manufactured and accounted for one-third of all sugar 
moving in foreign trade. Production was reasonably good that 
year?about 5.6 million metric tons compared with the 4.9-
million-ton average for the preceding 5 years; it was valued 
at nearly $400 million. The United States had an agreement 
to purchase approximately 60 percent of the 1958 crop at 
preferential prices. 
In 1958 and other pre-Castro years, Cuba's sugar-producing 
capacity was probably much greater than production because 
growers were then'deliberately trying to hold output to market 
requirements. Emphasis seemed more on factory efficiency in 
extraction than on efficiency in cane production. 
In 1959, production of sugar in Cuba reached 6 million 
metric tons. It continued at approximately the same level (5.9 
million tons) the following year. In 1961?the best sugar-
producing year of the Castro administration-6.8 million tons 
were produced. In 1962, however, sugar output declined 
sharply to 4.8 million tons, as redirection of production re-
sources and a general falling-off in efficiency of both equip-
ment and management began to have their influence. The low 
point of sugar production in the Castro period came in 1963

to million tons of sugar is ihe target program d o 
This was to be achieved by stages according to the following 
timetable of annual production: 
Million metric tons Million metric tons 
1965   6.0 1968   8.0 
1966   6.5 1969   9.0 
1967   7.5 1970   10.0 
Since the establishment of these goals, sugar production has 
reached the target only in 1965. In 1966, output was short 
by as much as 30 percent. In 1968, the goal will likely be 
underachieved by more than 35 percent. Prospects for the 
oncoming 1969 harvest have already been dimmed by an ex-
tended period of drought. 
Attainment of the 10-minion-metric-ton sugar goal by 1970 
may be remotely possible but only under fortuitous climatic 
conditions and at great cost to the Cuban people and their 
economy. This would entail the mobilization of a vast army 
of cane-cutters and other workers to man the expanded acre-
age in cane, converting of transportation and other facilities 
to the sugar industry, plus intensive application of fertilizer, 
farm machinery, and other resources to the crop. 
Undoubtedly much 1969 cane will be "left over," and in all 
probability subsequent crops will suffer as a result of over-
cutting. In past efforts to reach sugar goals, few production 
resources have been spared; high priorities have been set for 
labor and machinery, and large allocations of funds have been 
made for the purchase of fertilizer and the modernization and 
-expansion of milling facilities. 
Cuba's present exports of coffee are being accomplished by 
squeezing an undcrsupplied domestic market?a sharp con, 
drast with the situation in 1958 when, from a relative surplus 
20 percent of its crop was sold abroal. Coffee production for 
1968 is estimated at 30,000 tons, ap somewhat from the 
previous year but still 25 perccr short of the 1957-59 
average. 
The 1968 rice harvest is less if In the 1967 tonnage and 
just slightly over half the output pre-Castro days. Produc-
tion of' tobacco, an important ea ter of foreign exchange, h 
only about two-thirds the prerc lution volume. There hat 
been some improvement recent' in the production of live. 
stock and meat, but the totals st'J remain substantially Woe 
the 1957-59 averages. 
Diets deteriorate 
When the Castro regime came t.? power in 1959 the Cuban, 
were one of the best-fed peoples i Latin America. Excessive ? 
and indiscriminate livestock slaugh? * in 1959 and early 1960\ 
however, caused a sharp drop in r ?at supplies. A decline in 
the output of food crops, especial') ice, during Castro't carl 
years in office was precipitated t , rapid nationalization o 
farm properties and the shift in di ; :tion of trade. 
The past decade has witnessed ; deterioration in the avers 
age Cuban's diet, particularly in i quality, as grain protcia 
has replaced much of the animal r ? ttein. 
Food production in 1968 is esti ated to have been about

CPYRGHT Cuba Striving to, Boost 
Size of Vital Sugar Crop 
By Fenton Wheeler 
HAVANA (AP)?Fidel Cas-
tro named it ''the year of deci-
sive endeavor." Everybody 
agrees 1969 will be a year of 
unprecedented hard work, sac-
rifice and probably less con-
sumer comfort for Cuba's' 
eight million people. 
There is little doubt the gov-
ernment is making its most se-
rious effort so far to 
strengthen the economy. The 
goal: A record 10 million tons 
of sugar production next year. 
Present indications are that 
the government will have to 
hustle to make it. 
Premier Castro already says 
:this year's harvest? billed as 
a rehearsal for next year?is 
not going Well. It may make 
five million tons. 
Cuba needs a big sugar har-
vest to meet credit obligations 
on both sides of the Iron Cure 
lain. Trade experts say it is 
possible that Castro can get by 
financially in 1970 with less 
than 10 million tons?say 
eight million tons?if sugar 
prices stay up. 
But the Cuban leader him: 
'self has tied political consider-
ations to the 1970 harvest by 
pledging the honor of his 
Communist government on 
reaching the goal. He says the 
Cuban revolution can be 
Judged once and for all on 
whether the country makes it. 
; The result has been to make 
the 10 million tons a national 
motto. Huge posters dot the 
countryside proclaiming "thee 
1 
.10 million are coming." A big 
neon sign flashes the same 
'news in red, white and blue on 
litivana's main street. 
I Along with sloganeering has 
,come more work. Some exam-
ples:, 
? 
? More than 110,000 volun-
teers, mostly young people, 
are working in hot, Texas-like 
Camaguey province. Many will 
stay up to three years. 
? Workers in westernmost 
Pinar del Rio province have 
pledged to work 12 hours 
daily. Some dn Las Villas 
province have given up vaca-
tions this year. Most factory 
workers have agreed to work 
one hour extra daily without 
pay to make up the production 
loss of fellow workers toiling 
In agriculture. 
? High school students who 
normally spend 45 days in ag-
ricultural work are doing 90 
this year. Some are staying for 
120 days. 
Castro has indicated the tra-
ditional Christmas and New 
Year's holidays will be post-
poned 'until July, 1970, when 
the harvest is finished. This 
year will be 18 months long,' 
he says. 
Meanwhile, the country's. 
food a n d clothing shortages 
continue. Thousands of man-
hours are still being lost in 
queues and in a breakdown of 
services as employes leave 
their jobs to work in agricul-
ture.Castro has blamed bad ort 
ganization for this year's daw-
dling harvest. He also has 
noted that many state work 
centers are run by administra-; 
tors who have no more than a. 
sixth-grade education. 
Nature, too, is a persistent 
problem for one-crop Cuba. 
After the 1967 drought bat' 
tered sugar production, Castro 
'rushed ahead plans on dam 
building and irrigation. Now 
'too much rain has slowed 
planting for next year aid 
,though the really rainy season 
'doesn't begin until mid-May.

THIRD WORLD IMPATIENCE WITH SINO-SOVIET MEDDLING 
Among the large numbers of African, Asian, and Latin American 
students returning from the Soviet Union, East Europe, Communist China, 
Cuba, or North Korea, those who have been subverted and trained as 
"professional revolutionaries" are in the minority; the politically 
naive and "duped" make up a larger group. Once the students are home, 
the distinction is of little import since the naive, both foreign and 
native-educated, can be easily led by the professionals into stirring 
discontent among other students. Too often,. the disciplined, disrup-
tive minority succeeds in capturing the leadership of entire student 
unions and associations. 
The professional revolutionaries do not .operate alone, without 
outside guidance. Activities are carefully monitored and directed 
either by Bloc representatives in the country (or in neighboring coun-
tries), or by Communist-front organizations, such as the International 
Union of Students or the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Since 
guidance is given clandestinely and is unknown to persons not directly 
involved, its existence can be all too readily denied. Occasionally, 
when student dissidence threatens to run out of control, the revolu-
tionaries are put down, the participants exposed, and the clandestine 
curtain parted to provide a true insight into the dangers of such sub-
version. 
Two recent cases in Ethiopia and Kenya in which the curtain parted, 
as outlined below, should be especially.meaningful to countries of the 
Third World since the Communist effort is directed principally against 
them. 
Ethiopian Restraint  
As illustrated by the following chronology of events, the Imperial 
Ethiopian Government (IEG) has consistently been sympathetic to the 
students' point of view in internal university matters but became in-
creasingly concerned about the way extremists, with Communist backing, 
exploited the situation for purely political ends: 
March-April 1968 - Outbreak of student disturbances, the most 
widespread since the attemped coup of 1960. A police search of the 
National Union of Ethi,opian. Uhivergity.Stu4ents (NUEUS) headquarters revealed 
large quantities of propaganda pamphlets prepared by the Communist-
(Soviet-) controlled International Union of Students (IUS) and numer-
ous propaganda and instruction films, some made in Czechoslovakia. 
East European embassies (especially Soviet and Czechoslovak) which had

the university's two student unions (NUEUS and another), and to pro-
hibiting publication of an extremist student monthly, Struggle. 
November 1968 - A boycott of classes at the University of Addis 
Ababa, which began on 14 November, ended two days later when student 
leaders met with the Prime Minister and received his assurances that 
a student Union could again be established at the university and a 
newspaper published, provided it respected the libel laws. At a 
17 November student meeting, leaders who had met with the Prime Minister 
were accused by extremist students of being too soft because they had 
agreed to a referendum on the new union. Those same extremists captured 
the leadership of the student movement and threatened continued boycotts 
until three days later when the Government abandoned its request for a 
referendum. A pamphlet distributed early in November and credited to 
a radical extremist student cell, "The Crocodiles," made it clear that 
the new student leadership was aiming at political action against the 
government. It called on peasants, the urban proletariat, soldiers and 
"revolutionary students" to unite in opposition to feudalists, bourgeoisie, 
"top-brass" military leaders and "perfidious imperialism." The IEG was 
described as a "treacherous, senile and cynical feudal regime." It 
was the pamphlet's Marxist terminology which pinpointed "The Crocodiles" 
as its authors and suggested that the extremist students belong to or 
were influenced by this Marxist-Maoist cell, known to exist in the 
university at the time of the April disturbances and known as the pub-
lishers of Struggle. 
February-March 1969 - A resurgence of dissidence throughout pro-
vincial secondary schools and among students at Haile Selassie Uni-
versity culminated in a school shutdown on 4 March. During this 
period, Radio Moscow's broadcasts to Ethiopia were harshly critical 
of the IEG, degrading to Haile Selassie, and usually prefaced by the re-
mark that the broadcaster's information "came directly from our Addis 
Ababa correspondents." One broadcaster, on 7 or. 8 March, prefaced a 
strident vituperation of the Emperor by identifying himself as Vladimir 
Sharayev, a cultural attach; at the Soviet embassy in Addis Ababa and 
at that time on vacation in the Soviet Union. Such flagrancy could 
only have been iterpreted by the IEG as sanctioned by the Government 
of the USSR;. In addition, Radio Moscow propaganda was repeated in 
student-circulated, mimeographed flyers mass distributed throughout 
Addis Ababa. 
13 March 1969 - An editorial in the morning Ethiopia Herald, 
probably inspired by the government (copy of text attached), WTned 
against the subversive activities of certain foreign agents (meaning 
Soviet-) and noted that there is a point beyond which patience ceases 
to be a virtue. 
14 March 1969 - A front-page news feature in the Ethiopia Herald  
(reprint attached) announced the expulsion of six Soviet Bloc officials, 
to be effected within 24 hours, on charges of fomenting subversion 
among students.

Who Was Expelled? 
Names of the ousted Communist officials are given in the attached 
Ethiopia Herald news story. The three Czechoslovak officials were 
fairly recent arrivals unknown, minor functionaries in the Addis 
Ababa commercial mission. Perhaps their. expulsion, can be explained 
as a backlash of IEG anger stirred up by Soviet, blatancy; or as the 
IEG's belated reaction to Czechoslovak -involvement in the 1968 dis-
turbances; or even as an indirect IEG slap at the trouble-making, So-
viet--controlled IUS, which is headquartered in Prague. The Soviet 
dfficials, at least two of them, are better known: Victor Matveyev, 
TASS correspondent; Mikhail Novikoy, Novosti correspondent; and 
Vladimir Sharayev, cultural attache and director of the Soviet Per-
manent Exhibition in Addis Ababa. 
. Bombay's Current of 12 April 1969 discusses the "Soviet Agents 
Chucked Out" of Ethiopia and recalls the early 1950's when Victor 
Matveyev headed TASS in New Delhi, where.. he. was active in agitating 
students and trade union subversion (excerpts from text attached). 
Vladimir Sharayev was associated with Radio Moscow long before 
his now-famous broadcast of early March and has long been known in 
Ethiopia. A feature article published in the 25-26 February 1967 
edition of Rome's independent daily, Il Giornale d'Italia, describes 
Sharayev aa:being,Un the'mid-1960's, the broadcaster from Radio Mos-
cow of all the Amharic-language scripts which openly attacked IEG pol-
icies. Sharayev acquired his fluency In the Amharic language in the 
'early 1960's as an exchange student at the University in Addis Ababa. 
Kenya Not in the Mood  
In Kenya, student agitators have been abette-d.by both Peking and 
Moscow and have been helped by the Soviet-controlled International 
Union of Students (IUS): 
January-February 1969 - An article in the 6 February 1969 Hin-
dustan Times (copy attached) described the closing in early 1969 of 
the University College in Nairobi and noted that in. Kenya the gov-
ernment was in no mood to "tolerate trouble from students -- or any-
one else." A Radio Peking broadcast to Africa, which claimed 34 
deaths and police disobedience caused by the university closure, was 
scored by the Kenya press: 
"The broadcast shows how far removed from reality 
the authorities in China have become..... They can no 
longer even lie intelligently.... There is no doubt the 
Chinese technique of the big.lie has gained some dupes 
in Africa who are eager to parrot the tired slogans which 
Peking and its supporters feed. (East Africa  
Standard, 3 February 1969)

The Communist Bloc role in training young men and -students in subver-
sion came to light with the appearance at Nairobi court hearings, 
7-11 February, of eight defendants charged with circulating banned 
Communist Chinese publications, most of which advocated violent revo-
lution. One defendant was a Moscow University postgraduate research 
student, one admitted to having attended a "school of professional 
revolution" in North Korea, one was just a student in Nairbbi, and 
five were students in the mid-1960's at the Wuhan Military Training 
College in Peking. 
March 1969 - A 14 March Kenya Gazette article-announced that a 
considerable number of scholarships. would be awarded Kenyan students 
by the Soviet Union under terms of a new cultural agreement which is 
presently under discussion. Kenyan officials had in the-paSt expressd 
public concern about the qualifications of the many IUS-sponsored 
scholarship students returning from the USSR and East Europe and the 
prospect now of facing "considerable numbers" of graduates of the 
Patrice Lumumba Friendship University could not have been very reas-
suring. Someone may have recalled an East African Standard article 
of 10 May 1965 which discussed Kenyan students in Bulgaria under IUS 
auspices and stated that the students were studying "nothing but Com-
munist ideology and guerrilla warfare." They were reported to have 
attended a "Party Students' School" and to have taken part in a Com-
munist revolutionary course.

the article said, "had clamped a news blackout on the situation ... 
and there was no comment from Home Office sources." The story con-
tinued that in February 1968 Kenya had expelled a Soviet Novosti 
correspondent (Venyamin D. Zakharov) and the Soviet representative 
of Sovexportfilm (Eduard B. Agadzhanov). At that time, Mr. Daniel

ETHIOPIA HERALD, Addis Ababa 
13 March 1969 
Editorial  
Time for Action 
ItThere is a point beyond which patience ceases to be a virtue. 
The subversive activities of certain foreign agents are now pushing 
Ethiopia to this point. 
"The problem of subversion and interference in the affairs of 
other states by major powers is an old but continuing cause for con-
cern, not only among the now developing nations of the third world, 
but even among some highly industrialized but nevertheless subjugated 
satellite nations. Nor is Ethiopia a stranger to such intervention. 
The annals of our history bear witness to many instances of foreign 
intervention, interference and invasion. The whole long and lamenta-
ble era of colonialism is replete with examples of intervention under 
the guise of the so-called civilizing mission of imperialist powers. 
The Fascist invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 was one example of such in-
tervention which the world-- to its subsequent sorrow -- chose to 
,ignore. The invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was. the latest but 
apparently not the last example of such foreign intervention. 
"Sometimes foreign interference takes a more subtle form than 
the naked aggression of 1935 and that of 1968. Interference in na-
tional sovereignty may take the form of efforts to divide a country 
against itself, efforts to divide generation against generation, re-
gion against region. The undermining of developing nations may even 
take the more insidious form of posing as a protector. When the need 
in developing countries is for economic advancement, some major powers 
prefer to sow the seeds of discord and conflict by offering aid only 
in the form of arms. 
"Ethiopia has experienced and survived if not all at least most 
of the forms of direct and indirect interference and subversion. On 
her part, Ethiopia, as a founding member of the United Nations and the 
seat of the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity, has 
stood fast against all instances of interference by outside powers 
against the sovereignty of any nation. Nor will Ethiopia view inter-
ference against herself any more lightly than she would against a sis-
ter state. 
For sometime outside agents have been trying to dupe students and 
some other groups of Ethippians not only into betrayal of their own , 
best interests but even into violence against the very fabric of their 
nation. Those who would try to tear Ethiopia apart should be warned: 
the cloth of our unity is durable and tough. 
, "Ethiopia did not become aware only yeaterdqy or.today of the sub-
versive activities being fomented here by foreign agents. The various

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000500110001-9 
acts of subversion attempted through bribery and corruption that 
have perpetrated have been known since their inception.' Diplomatic 
hints have been dropped to the countries responsible. The soft hints 
seem to have fallen on deaf ears. The hand of friendship which Ethiopia 
continued to hold out to these countries seems to have been misinter-
preted. If the open hand of brotherhood is misunderstood, perhaps it 
is time to show the closed fist. 
"Many diatribes against Ethiopia, broadcast recently by a foreign 
radio have lately been circulated in the streets of Addis Ababa under 
the name of Ethiopian students. Subversion should at least be more 
subtle; duplicity, less obvious. Were the circumstances not so tragi-
cally sad, such an act might be viewed as an absurd and amateurish 
betrayal of itself. In this sophisticated age, even the intended vie-
time of subversion might expect it to be carried out with more skill. 
"Ethiopia, as a cornerstone of the non-aligned world, has made 
the principle of non-interference in the integrity and soveriegnty 
? of nations the foundation of its own foreign policy. We believe equal- , 
ly in national unity. We expect our sister nations to do the same. A 
country which has no% bent to the Fascist sword will not bend to sub-
version from any source. Ethiopia's determination to defend herself 
against foreign aggressors has inscribed itself in the pages of history. 
A new page in this long and honorable history must now be written. The 
time for concern is passed. The time for action is here. Those respon-
sible for subversive interference and cowardly attacks against Ethiopia 
will now have:to pay the price. It has been said that those who do not 
know history are forced to repeat it. Those who ignore Ethiopia's long 
and heroic history ot self-defense now have to be taught the lesson at 
first hand."

"Soviet Agents Chucked Out" 
(Excerpts) 
"In New Delhi there is nothing but love between the Indians and 
Soviets but in Addis Ababa, the capital 'of Ethiopia, it is different. 
Ethiopian intelligence is smarter than ours for recently, following 
serious student unrest, the Ethiopian government chucked out two Rus-
sians and three Czechs as being the brains behind this student agita-
tion. 
"Now the interesting thing is that among those expelled was Com-
rade Victor Matveyev former TASS correspondent in New Delhi who was 
regarded as an old friend of India. Matveyev was head of the TASS. 
bureau in the capital city in the early 1950's. 
"Also expelled was Mikhail Novikov, representative of the 'unof-: 
ficial' Novosti news agency. 'Unofficial' only because the Russians 
continue to claim that this news agency has nothing to do with the 
Soviet government. 
"These strong and firm measures taken by the Ethiopian government 
are in striking contrast to the attitude of laissez-faire shown by 
India in exactly the same kind of student agitation. For years So-
viet personnel have been active in subverting-Indian University tu-. 
dents but with Mrs. Indira Gandhi as the head of our government, so 
anxious not to displease her guru, Mr. Kosygin, no action is being 
taken here. Mrs. Gandhi is known to have passed the word down the 
line that under no circumstances should Soviet 'feelings' ever be 
hurt. 
a. 
-.? 
"In the case of Victor Matveyev, who was known as the TASS Cor-
respondent in India and who is now expelled from Ethiopia, the Ethio-
pians bluntly said that he is no journalist. They dub him as a propa-
ganda activist for the KGB which he also was during his Indian tour 
of duty. Matveyev was not Only an activist among students but he also 
did a great deal of damage in the trade union field. He was, of course 
an accredited correspondent to the Government of India. The Indian 
government gives facilities to Soviet agents to do their work in our 
country. 
"While Matveyev was regarded as a journalist in New Delhi and was 
treated as a pen-pal by local journalists, he Was even then working 
with Soviet intelligence personnel. In the Soviet set up -- KGB and 
others -- it is often the number two who control the number one and so 
it was with Matveyev who had an 'assistant' Comrade Protyannikov. Yet 
it was Protyannikov who was the control man and the main liaison with 
the headquarters of the KGB in Moscow.

"Under Matveyev's regime the TABS office in New Delhi was greatly 
expanded. Propaganda work particularly at the time of the Telengana 
riots erupted and soon Matveyev had to push aside his student 'side 
line' to others to perform. The bigger subversive activity, namely 
Telengana riots, needed his attention first and foremost. 
"After Matveyev's departure a number of Soviet intelligence men 
have been in charge of Indian student 'cells.' At least two of these 
did not come to the attention of the Indian authorities chiefly because 
the Indian authorities are not suspicious of Soviet activity in this 
country. There was for instance, Comrade Ramiz Ibrahimov, a Central 
Asian, who specialized in infiltration of what is known as the Muslim 
wing of the student movement. When Ibrahimov was whisked away, his 
successor in.the job was Alexandr Dmitrievich Terekhin, a very effi-
cient operator in India, who established many close contacts but al-
ways managed to keep his nose clean. Ibrahimov and Terekhin were the 
kingpins of the KGB personnel attached to the student wing in India 
during the middle 1960's."

SOVIET SCIENTISTS: DISAFFECTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT  
Contradictions between the USSR's self-proclaimed image and Soviet 
reality are nowhere so glaring as in the broad realm of science. Marx 
repeatedly referred to the scientific soundness of his analyses of con-
ditions and of his forecasts of the historically inevitable victory of 
communism. Stalin in 1927 predicted, that in the communist society of 
the USSR, "Science and art will enjoy conditions conducive to their 
highest development." Khrushchev in 1957 boasted of achievements of 
the USSR which "mark a new epoch in the development of science and 
technology" and acclaimed the "greatest feats of workers of Soviet 
science and technology" ih solving complicated problems. In January 
1966 Soviet Academy of Sciences member Peter Kapitsa spoke of "the 
great advantages offered by our socialist system in the organization 
of our science and industry." In February 1969 the World Marxist 
Review called science and technology "one of the principal ?and deter;.-
minative fields in the contest between the two opposed social systems" 
and asserted that socialism offers "the greatest scope for scientific 
worth." Finally, in Moscow News of 29 March 1969, Soviet Academy of 
Sciences member Janis Peive asserted that the Soviet state "displays 
great concern for developing science, which is making an important con-
tribution to the acceleration of engineering progress, to the solution 
of major probelms of the conomy, and to the further raising of cultural 
standards in our country." 
How does this picture of a science-oriented society square with 
the actual achievements of Soviet science and the situation of Soviet 
scientists? Several recent documents and. commentaries shed consider-
able light on this subject. It can be clearly concluded that Soviet 
science, except in military support work, has fallen far short of the 
Kremlin's expectations. Moreover, Soviet scientists, who as a class 
have long been favored by the regime, have demonstrated that they are 
deeply disaffected by the Soviet system and some recent Kremlin poli-
cies. 
Major Conclusions Concerning Soviet Science  
An exhaustive study entitled "Soviet Science Policies" was completed 
in June 1968 by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD). Richly documented and offering cogent discussions in 
its 738 pages, it has only recently been distributed, in limited numbers 
to reviewers in Great Britain and the United States. In the reviews,three 
of which are attached, several of the OECD compendium's findings are high-
lighted: 
a. Soviet science has scored tangible achievements in 
military research and development and, as alcompanion effort, 
in space exploration,

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000500110001-9 
b. In other selected scientific pursuits, such as re-
search in mathematics, theoretical physics, earth sciences, 
and physiology, the Soviets have done well; but it is noted 
that these are pursuits in which pre-Revolutionary Russian 
scientists also did well. 
c. In technology, besides aerospace, the USSR has done 
reasonably well in electric power equipment, machine tools, 
steelmaking equipment, and some aspects of medicine. 
d. As for the balance, according to one reviewer, "There 
remain huge deserts in Soviet science, both in academic work 
and in industry." 
e. Soviet achievement in almost every science-based in-
dustry lags far behind that of Western Europe and even farther 
behind that of the United States. The need to call on Italian 
and other Western European help in the present effort to devel-
op' the automobile industry is a case in point. 
f. The Soviet bureaucracy has been able to marshal scien-
tists for selected military-related projects, but the clumsy un-
responsiveness of the bureaucracy has severely impaired scien-
tific and technical development in other fields. 
g. Soviet science and technology has yielded only meager 
returns on the huge outlays -- three per cent of gross national 
product -- invested in science. An important reason for this 
is that research is given an unduly large emphasis at the ex-
pense of developmental and experimental work related to industry. 
h. Soviet scientists are estimated to be only one half as 
productive as American scientists. (This is admitted by Soviet 
scientists; one reviewer believes the comparison is even more 
unfavorable to the Soviets.) 
i. The critical failing in Soviet science is the incentive 
to innovate. Soviet scientists have been judged mainly on the 
volume of their reserach as measured in money terms, and not on 
the quality and number of projects which yield genuine benefits 
to the society. 
j. The most evident shortcoming of Soviet science is in the 
technology of the USSR's consumer goods industries (automobiles, 
refrigerators, TV's, sewing machines, etc.). Soviet consumer goods 
are so shoddy that cash-heavy and goods-poor Soveit citizens de-
posit increasing percentages of their income in savings banks.

Past Soviet Efforts to Improve Scientific Work  
It would be inaccurate to say that the Soviets fail to recognize 
the plain fact that they have obtained poor overall results from their 
vast array of scientific institutes and industrial research establishments. To refute that notion it is enough to note (as does the OECD 
study) that the Soviets have reorganized their scientific and technical 
establishment time and again over the years. These reorganizations, 
however, were superficial and even frequently repeated systems resembled 
solutions which had been tried and found wanting in the past: 
A departure from this dependency on reorganization was started in 
January 1966, when a speech by the prominent physicist Peter Kapitsa 
was published in the Communist youth newspaper. Kapitsa noted Premier 
Kosygim's statements in September 1965 about the declining growth of 
labor productivity and linked that decline to the unsatisfactory ap-
plication of the achievements of Soviet science and technology. As-
serting that the Soviets had not been closing the scientific gap be-
tween them and the Americans, he made a series of recommendations, the 
most important of which was that some means be found to offer monetary 
incentives for useful innovations. Kapitsa was quite candid in attrib-
uting his suggestion to American experience and, possibly for this reason, 
little was done about it for almost three years. (See the attached trans-
lation of Kapitsa's speech.) 
New Proposals to Improve Scientific Work  
In October 1968 the Soviet Government issued a decree entitled "Meas-
ures to Raise the Efficacy of the Work of Scientific Organizations and to 
Accelerate the Utilization of Scientific and Technical Achievements in the 
National Economy." (See attached article from Pravda.) The published re-
port of the decree is largely a rehash of familiar, nagging problems, but 
it contains a remarkable new feature: a: proposed system of material in-
centives to be introduced gradually, starting 1 January 1969. Under this 
system, both the institutes and their employees will be rewarded in prb-
portion to the profits that their innovations earn for industry. Insti-
tutes;andJscientiSts are to be rated every three years by committees com-
posed of scientists, Party representatives, and trade union officials. 
Those who fail to measure up will be demoted or dismissed. Scientific 
and professional competence will no longer be the criterion of success; 
rather, it will be the practical economic results of the work performed. 
How this profit and incentive system will work out is an open queu-
tion. One obstacle is the deeply entrenched system under which Soviet 
scientists have been working for decades; demoting veterans for failure 
to meet new criteria is not easy, especially for their contemporary super-
visors in the institutes. Getting industry to accept new and better 
methods has always been difficult, for the simple reason that factory 
managers customarily avoid the kinds of work slowdowns and loss of pro-
duction which result from experiments with, or the introduction of new 
equipment. It would jeopardize their profits. Moreover, the profit 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-FDP79-01194A000500110001-9 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000500110001-9 
system for science will depend largely on the profit system introduced 
since 1965 in Soviet industry, which has fared poorly during the past 
several years, largely because bureaucrats have resisted changes and 
Party ideologists have been suspicious of reforms which would lead in 
the direction of a market economy. These shortcomings won't encourage 
the scientists to hope that their system will work any better. 
Soviet Scientists Are Increasingly Disaffected  
Signs that Soviet scientists are disaffected are apparent not only 
from the above-noted deficiencies in scientific achievement and the re-
gime's moves to redirect scientists' work and make it more profitable. 
There are also signs that many prominent Soviet scientists are question-
ing the basic Soviet system, and that many young scientists are, at the 
least, politically apathetic. 
The best-known figure among disaffected Soviet scientists is Andrei 
Sakharov, the physicist who in 1954, when still in his early thirties, 
was made the youngest full member in the history of the USSR's Academy 
of Sciences as a reward for making a major contribution to the USSR's 
hydrogen bomb. In 1968 Sakharov, in an essay circulated widely amongst 
leading Soviet scientists, set forth his theses of convergence of commu-
nist and capitalist systems in the interest of serving mankind, and of 
the essential need of intellectual freedom in human society. Sakharov's 
essay scathingly condemns the Stalinist survivals'inthe Soviet society, 
and proposes measures which would radically changethe political philoso-
phy and structure of the USSR. 
Other leading Soviet scientists have since 1966 joined with prominent 
intellectuals in protesting against moves taken or contemplated by the 
Soviet regime. The attached article by Victor Zorza entitled "Scientists' 
Rebellion Upsets the Kremlin" describes some of these protests by scientists, 
as well as steps being taken by the regime to discredit the scientists and 
thus minimize the effect of their protests. Also described are Soviet 
press articles indicating that residents of the "science town" of Obninsk 
have held "misguided" political seminars and have invited "dubious people 
who preached incorrect views" to speak to them. 
Causing further concern to the regime is the indication that young 
Soviet scientists are either apathetic to political affairs or are taking 
unorthodox views of wrestling with national problems. The Soviet press 
particularly attacks young scientists who "lack the political experience 
to get to the bottom of even simple questions" and are unable to draw 
the line between "correct" criticism and "criticism which seeks to under-
mine the foundations of our society." The press maintains they wrongly 
dispute the party's right to restrict their personal and political freedom.

The Soviet regime shows little evidence that it can solve the sub-
stantial problems posed by the long-tolerated shortcomings in science 
and technology and at the same time contain the stirrings of disaffection 
among prominent and young scientists. Offering more money for more re-
sults will undoubtedly help some. However, the Soviet regime would be 
very naive to believe that scientists, who have undergone many years of 
rigorous training, will confine their thoughts to strictly scientific 
matters and agree not to encroach upon the party's monopoly over politi-
cal questions.

R the reran 
The COMMUNIST WORLD: 
by VICTO zonzA 
THE. Kremlin's thought-
' police is moving in slowly,. 
circumspeetly, on the Soviet 
. scientific community whose 
:rebellion Is threatening to 
undermine? the party's totali-
tarian rule. Professor Andrei 
Sakharov, whose call . for a 
multi-party system in Russia is 
circulating ever more widely 
'through underground chart, 
nets inside the country, is still 
.at liberty. ? 
To arrest this nian?who made 
a signal contribution to the 
Soviet nuclear programme?for 
demanding freedom of thought 
. for scientists and the public 
alike would be to provoke a 
powerful wave of public protest. 
The scientists took a prominent 
, part in the recent protests 
against the arrests of "freedom 
; writers." They would fight that 
; much harder against the arrest 
, of one of their own. ? 
. The Sakharov manifesto, with 
:its closely argued pica for the 
'convergence"of the Commu-
nist and capitalist systems, 
:clearly shook the party establish-
ment. There was no public con-
demnation, nor even any direct 
mention, of the Sakharov docu-
ment in the Soviet press, but the 
problem which lie created for the 
party's control of the scientific 
community is being tackled with 
i 
increasing vigour n the party 
journals. 
The latest contribution to the 
debate appears in "Kommunist," 
the party's chief ideological maga-
zine, in an article signed by N. 
Sviridov?whose position as 
deputy head of the party propa-
ganda department is tactfully 
glossed over. He complains that 
some scientists, whom he does not 
name, get hold of." casual " poll-
lical information "and on this 
shaky foundation they sometimes 
build far-reaching conclusions." 
At the same time, without 
actually threatening them with 
th) sack for political noncon-
formity, he mentions that ' a 
check on the qualifications of 
scientists in Leningrad has led 
to 100 dismissals.. This appears 
to be the first such check since 
the announcement recently of 
the new system under which all 
scientists would have to undergo 
fitg riet(aUftagg IfuRrigb 
of retaining their posts. 
The examination panel con-
sists not only of the scientists' 
own peers, but also of party and 
trade union officials. It is thus 
clear that political as well as 
professional criteria enters into 
the decision. Indeed. 'the 
" attestation" procedure now 
extended to scientists is a long-
standing Soviet prsctice, which 
Is specifically defined in a Soviet 
law encyclopaedia as being con-
Cerned, among other things, with 
the " political qualifications" of 
the people being "attested." 
Clearly, the Kremlin cannot 
afford anything like a real purge 
of free-thinkers among the 
scientists, because this would 
pull the rug from under its own 
feet. All the evidence suggests 
that too large and too influential 
a part of the scientific com-
munity shares, to a greater or 
lesser extent, many of Sak-
harov's ideas. The thought-police 
nntst, therefore, proceed circum-
spectly, using both stick and 
carrot. 
Material conditions for scien-
tists, who already comprise the 
most privileged section of the 
community, have recently been 
further improved as part of a 
general reorganisation of the 
administration of science. Steps* 
have been taken to cut out the 
dead wood, about which there 
have been many complaints from 
younger scientists, whose career 
prospects were frustrated by old 
men hanging on to lucrative 
posts. The " reattestation" pro-
gramme is partly directed to this 
end. 
? In science, however, the intel-
lectual._ rebellion is maturing 
among both the old and the 
young, as distinct from most 
other walks of Soviet life, where 
the young are the rebels. Sak-
harov himself was joined by such 
old pillars of Soviet science as 
Kapitsa and Tamm in a widely 
distributed protest to the 
Politburo at the time of the last 
party congress against the pro-
posed rehabilitation of 'Stalin. 
At the same time, young, 
scientists" are criticised, as in 
the recent "Kommunist " article, 
for taking an "abstract and ? 
classless" view of such ideas as 
" democracy, freedom of the 
person, and humanism." This is 
?to say that they dispute the 
party's right to impose restric-
tions on personal and political 
they ewiv pccial meeting 
and issue a thumping resolution 
which publicly condemns the 
'shortcomings and demands imme-
diate improvements. It would 
seem that in the present matter 
they have behaved with much 
greater discretion. A meeting has. 
certainly been held and the, 
appropriate minority resolution 
passed?but it was all done in 
secret, in order not to stir up, 
the scientific hornets' nest. 
The evidence of the party's 
secret moves is to be found in 
articles' which began to appear 
shortly after the Sakharov mani-
festo had emerged from the 
underground. Many of them use 
:precisely the same phrases and 
the same evidence of ideological 
backsliding among scientists, 
thus indicating that they are all 
based on the same original docu-
ment?that is, on the secret 
party resolution about the 
.scientific rebellion. 
Brezhnev's warning to the 
'Soviet intelligentsia in general. 
? issued in the early stages of the 
Czechoslovak reformation, has 
now, been made to apply to the 
scientists in particular. The 
scientists are told that "the 
enemies of communism are 
clutching at any evidence of 
political immaturity among its 
individual representatives, whom 
they are attempting to use in. 
their hostile activity against our 
country." They should, as " Kom. 
munist" instructs them, stand 
firm "against the attempts of the 
ideological saboteurs to introduce 
Ideas and views that are alien to? 
socialism into our midst." 
But what happens if " alien " 
ideas are somehow conceived by 
thoroughly . patriotic scientists,-
who base their case for political 
and social modernisation of the 
system on grounds of national 
interest? The party's answer is 
to ridicule the scientists as 
politically immature. 
Many young scientists, com-
plains the newspaper "Soviet 
Culture," .take a " snobbish " 
attitude to the public activities 
In which the party asks them to 
participate. Instead, it would 
seem, they demand the demo-
cratic right to take part in the 
discussion and shaping of policy, 
ialmost as if this was not the 
exclusive province of the party.

Club lectures 
Soviet scientists are privileged 
not only materially but also 
ideologically, for the party has 
bad to give them with one hand 
the right to independent think-
lag which it is trying to take 
away from them with the other. 
If they are to produce tho

Russia Found

CPYRGHT 
, icor a naiocentury, the :no-
s'irit Union has looked to sci-
ence to take the country to 
-the forefront of the modern 
industrialized world. 
For all their solid achieve-
ments on the space and mili-
tary frontiers, the Russians 
,today still suffer a chronic 
technology gap in countless 
other, important sectors of 
their vast and cumbersome 
.economy. Indeed, by one defi-
nition, the Soviet Union still 
falls short of being an indus-
trialized nation. 
In an exhaustive new trea-
tise dissecting Soviet science 
policies and programs,. the 
Paris-based Organization for 
shins are turning to Western 
approaches in some cases in 
hopes of improving their sys-
tem. 
When the Soviet leaders once

.some technological program,.

j()ECD report concludes, they 
can marshal their resources 
errpririv r. y inel icnnlly 
poses definite limits on the ef-
ficiency of Soviet research 
and development." 
In terms of sheer man-
power, the Soviet education 
system has been turning out 
masses of scientists, engineers 
and technicians. As of 1965, 
for example, an estimated 
one-third of the 4.891,000 citi-
zens with higher-level school-
achieve icsu is on a tr w 
anything the United States ac-
complished. 
But such crash efforts are 
limited, and the Russians lag 
well behind their American ri-
vals in the crucial computer 
and chemical industries and in 
almost all consumer products. 
Rigid, centralized planning, 
and unwieldy hareaucracy, 
limited research support, fail-
ures to follow up research 
with development and fre-
quent resistance to innovation 
on the factories have all con-
tributed to this Soviet gap.

Aware of their system's fail-

few year's have been undertak-

what the OECD analysts view 
so Ear as mixed results. They

The OECD experts consider 
this last a healthy step but not 
a panacea. "It seems certain," 
their summary observes ''that 
successful innovations in the 
West cannot entirely be ex-

'profit margins obtainable 
from innovation." 
At the same time, they add, 
"Soviet efforts in the next few

nevertheless likely to be rele-

The 22-nation OECD's ana-

its shortcomings, the Soviet 
Union has made immense 
strides toward becoming a

Tha Teciindosical Gap? in Russia 
Looking at thc Russians achieve- , 
merits in space, one finds it hard 
to believe that one of ,their obses- ? 
sions at home is with the techno-
logical gap between themselves 
and the United States, and the 
way to ?close it. The Russians 
are, after all, training a quite 
staggering number of scientists' 
and engineers ; half the students 
coining out of the universities 
have qualified as either thc one 
or the other, making the num-
ber of young, technically qualified 
graduates coming out each year 
substantially higher than it is in 
the United States. 
And the pool of technically quali-
fied manpower is substantial, even 
for a country the Size of the 
Soviet Union ; it could be well 
over gi mu, of whom nearly 
700,000 are university graduates 
or the equivalent. The American 
pool of qualified man-power is 
not all that different, although 
the ratio of university-trained 
scientists and engineers is much 
higher?about i mu gradu-
ates ApprovednFolg,Release 
sets of figures excluding the social 
CPYRGHT 
sciences. It is not lack of trained 
.men that explains the gap, nor 
is it lack of money. The sums 
spent on science have been 
increasing 'annually and very 
rapidly, trebling in a decade and 
running at 3% of gross 
, national product, roughly the 
same ratio as in America; what-
ever else they lack, those Soviet 
scientists arc not short of money. 
Then what are they short of ? 
The Organisation for Economic 
Co-oneration and Development 
has been making its own, if not 
exactly clandestine, then not 
exactly official assessment for thc 
last two or three years, and thc 
resulting report*, nearly 750 pages 
long, is now being given a 
restricted circulation. Because of 
the notorious unreliability of 
official Soviet figures, and the still 
more notorious difficulty of match-
ing them to any comparable

western data, the specialists who 
compiled the report have been 
careful to explain their sources 
and methodology at every step, 
and the rash attempt to make 
some comparison with thc Ameri-
can research is ours, not theirs: 
But 
we thought it useful to show, 
, however notionally, that the 
Russians have tried the brute force 
approach of throwing in masses 
of men and money on a scale 
approaching thc American?but 
failed to get the results they 
Were looking for. They arc now 
groping for some more subtle key 
to technological innovation and 
this is having a profound effect 
on thc whole of their economic 
thinking. 
-Why they lag 
For what thc Russians appear 
, to have found is that innova-
tion requires first of all an 
attitude of mind that is not 
fostered by a normal Marxist 
economy. If a factory managers 
wage nontises if( teed

re-tooling that is going to inter-, 
fere With production. lie is also, 
going to run into difficulty in pric-
ing the new product so that it 
pays for its re-tooling and still 
remains competitive enough to 
CPYRGHT 
, sell. And even when a plant 
:manager is prepared to innovate,1 
he 'runs the risk of being landed 
,with a half-baked scheme badly 
worked out and only partially 
'tested. The Russian scientific 
'establishment, it seems, prefers 
,to spend its time on research 
'rather than development work. 
1Few of the big research institutes 
,have adequate facilities for pilot 
,plant design. The lack of these has 
.hit the chemical industry partieu-'

,long way to explain why so much, 
?chernical and synthetic fibre

from the west. But there have 
been complaints about electronics,

puter controlled machine tools 
:and iron and steel as well. And 
:these are nearly all fields- where 
a big technological fall-out front

:The Russians thernelves estimate 
that the productivity of their

from the. things that industry 
really wanted to know. The same 
tendencies are at work in the 
Soviet Union with a few out-
standing exceptions like the two 
major iron and steel research 
institutes that have established a 
two-way flow of information with 
the factories which has made this 
one of the most advanced of 
Russian industries. 
The Russian press, like. the 
British,. has been irritated by the 
number of times ideas that 
originated in Russia have been 
exploited commercially by other 
countries, notably the United 
States; instances of work on cer-
tain electronic components seem 
to rankle the most. And to pot 
beside this is a number of spec-
tacular failures; OECD cites 
computers (the infamous Ural 4_ 
.series) and car design. This, in 
the report, is contrasted with 
Soviet successes in what are 
classed as priority industries like 
space' defence.' research and 
? atomic energy. But except for 
space, ? is this strictly 'true ? 
No one questions the quality of 
Soviet military equipment, includ-
ing aircraft, but thc performance 
. of Soviet civil aircraft is open to 
challenge, and so is the country's 
record in atomic energy. Early 
Soviet planners made such basic 
'mistakes as drawing up energy 
policies that tied the country to 
coal rather than oil, and transport 
, policies that ivcre based on steam 
locomotives rather than diesels. 
But Russia ,was also the first 
country to have a working nuclear 
ixiwer station?a small one, 
admittedly but pre-dating Calder 
hall by several years. llowever, 
this never materialised into a 
nuclear power programme. Simi-
larly very few Soviet civil aircraft 
have ever gone into quantity pro-
duction. 
Russian remedies 
These examples arc important 
because the OECD seems to think 
that the reason that scientists in! 
these industries got more idoor 
than their colleagues in other 
research institutes is because they 
knew what they were attempting 
to do. They had a clear goal 
that allowed them to co-ordinate 
the efforts of researchers and 
industries scattered the breadth 
of the Soviet Union and had 
government backing from the top 
to by-pass the normal labyrinthine 
scientific planning machine to get 
their hands on key materials and 
equipment of good quality, to get 
the Soviet supersonic prototype 
:airliner now tlying; the evidence 
is that it suffers from all the short-
comings that have given super-
;sonic airliners in the west such 
:a chequered record. Yet aircraft 
is a shining example of a Russian 
?industry where development work 
and the construction of prototypes 
is given its due importance, and 
where the designer and his sup-
porting engineers outrank the 
factory manager, which they do 
not do elsewhere. 
Among the remedies the Russians 
have sought to prevent the dissi-
pation of their scientific effort, 
are reforms aimed at cutting 
down the power of the scientific 
establishment, as represented by 
the Academy of Sciences, and the 
giving of more autonomy to the 
individual research centres includ-
ing the famous Novosibirsk 
laboratories in Siberia. Around' 
this a "centre of excellence 
is building up on American lines, 
and attracting advanced industries 
to set up locally to cater for 
its advanced needs. The result 
of these reforms should in the 
long term be to reduce the status 
somewhat of the pure scientist 
and increase that of the engineer 
--Russian intellectuals are as big 
culture-snobs as any in the west 
and engineers have (like teachers) 
had to put up with a good deal 
of patronising. But this merely 
alters the climate slightly, of itself 
it will not close the technological 
gap. 
So efforts arc being made to 
devise a Soviet-type formula for 
measuring the possible costi., 
effectiveness of innovation ; for 
giving factory managers a choice 
of innovations to adopt .in theiri 
own plant?say, to choose which 
of several possible designs of 
machine tool they think worth . 
putting into development ; and 
combining this with sonic. incen. 
live to adopt innovation on the 
factory floor, together with a, 
price system that will not penalise 
the manager who does so. If 
this sounds as if the Russians 
arc moving, at industry level, 
towards a more western approach, 
to cost accounting, this is precisely , 
what the OECD specialists who 
have studied the research ,and 
development end of Russian ? 
industy think they arc doing. llow? 
far this can be carried without , 
a wholesale revision of the indus-
trial cost structure, and of 
economic policy generally, the 
next few . years may show.

THE CURRENT DIGEST OF THE SOVIET PRESS 
13 November 1968 
Resolution to Spur Scientific 
Research and Development 
CPYRGHT 
In the C.P.S.U. Central Committee and the U.S.S.R. Council of 
Ministers: ON MEASURES TO RAISE THE EFFICACY OF 
THE WORK OF SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONS AND TO AC-
CELERATE THE UTILIZATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECH-
NICAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. 
(Pravda and lzvestia, Oct. 23, p. I. Complete text:) The 
C.P.S.U. Central Committee and the U.S.S.R. Council of Min-
isters have examined the question of measures to raise the 
efficacy of the work of scientific organizations and to accel-
erate the utilization of scientific and technical achievements 
In the national economy. The resolution adopted on this ques-
tion notes that in a short historical period Soviet science and 
technology have attained a high degree of development and 
exert a decisive influence on the pace of the country's techni-
cal progress. Soviet science is first in the world in several 
major fields; this makes it possible to resolve important 
tasks in developing the economy and strengthening the coun-
try's defense capacity. 
The 23rd C.P.S.U. Congress defined the chief trends of 
technical progress that are connected with the growth of pro-
duction forces, the strengthening of the Soviet state and a 
steady increase in the people's material and cultural stan-
dards of living. To resolve these tasks, it is essential to im-
prove the work of scientific organizations substantially and to 
eliminate the obstacles retarding utilization of scientific and 
technical achievements in the national economy. 
A common shortcoming in the work of scientific-research, 
design, drafting and technological organizations and scientific 
subdivisions of higher schools is that their work is not fo-
cused to the proper extent on solving the most important sci-
entific-technical problems, especially questions related to 
accelerating the growth rate of labor productivity in industry, 
agriculture, construction, transport and other branches of the 
national economy. The time it takes to apply scientific 
achievements is still considerable; the Chief explanation for 
this lies in the insufficient responsibility exercised by scien-
tific institutions for the level of performance of scientific and 
technical projects, and by enterprises for the timely_pgrA-,,, 
tion of items Apriscoletwor Release 199 viu 
6 
Clear-cut specialization of scientific, design and drafting 
organizations has not been provided, and scientific-technical 
competition among them is poorly developed. There is a 
large gap between the time scientific research and design and 
technological elaborations are done and the time they are put 
into practice. To a considerable degree the reason for this 
lies in the inadequate role played by design subdivisions and 
laboratories at enterprises and in the slow development of 
capacities for the production of technological equipment and 
tools. 
The existing system of economic incentives for scientific 
research and for assimilation in production of the results of 
this research does not promote a rise in the efficacy of the 
scientific organizations' work. The scientific base at enter-
prises is being developed inadequately, and the technical 
equipment of many scientific-research institutions and higher 
schools is lagging. Adequate measures have not been taken to 
make rational use of scientific cadres and to increase their 
responsibility for the technical-economic level of research. 
The C.P.S.U. Central Committee and the U.S.S.R. Council 
of Ministers, on the basis of the tasks of the country's further 
economic development, have proposed to the U.S.S.R. Council 
of Ministers' State Committee for Science and Technology, the 
U.S.S.R. State Planning Committee, the U.S.S.R. State Con-
struction Administration, the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, 
the ministries and departments and the Union-republic Coun-
cils of Ministers that in drafting long-term, five-year and 
annual national-economic plans, broader use be made of the 
latest achievements of domestic and foreign science and tech-
nology and advanced experience and urgent measures be taken 
to raise substantially the efficacy of the work of scientific in-
stitutions, to improve the organization of scientific research 
and the management of scientific and technical development 
and to increase the responsibility of heads of enterprises, sci-
entific organizations and higher schools for the creation of new 
technology and applying it in the national economy.

State Planning Committee, the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences 
and the U.S.S.R. State Construction Administration, together 
with interested ministries and departments and Union-republic 
Councils of Ministers. 
On the basis of the scientific-technical forecasts, ministries 
and departments and Union-republic Councils of Ministers 
have been instructed to organize long-term elaboration of . 
:drafts for enterprises and production branches, as well as 
models of machinery and equipment for the future. The inten-
tion of all this is to provide the necessary scientific and 
technical backlog for the transition to qualitatively new 
"technological processes making it possible to raise labor pro-
ductivity severalfold over the present level. By the time' 
enterprises now being designed go into operation, they should 
substantially surpass existing enterprises in our country and 
abroad in terms of technical-economic indices and technical 
, level of output. 
The basic form of state planning of science and technology is 
? the five-year plan, which is drafted in accordance with the 
tasks of the country's economic development and the basic 
trends in science and technology over the long run. Proposals 
on the basic trends in scientific and technical development, as 
well as a list of major scientific-technical problems, are 
drawn up by the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers' State Commit-
tee for Science and Technology jointly with the U.S.S.R. Acad-
emy of Sciences, with the participation of ministries and de-
partments, Union-republic Councils of Ministers and scientif-
ic-technical societies. These proposals define the level of 
technical development for various branches of the national 
!economy that is to be attained by the end of the plan period, as 
well as the most important scientific research and projects 
? necessary to create a scientific-technical backlog. 
The chief components of the plan to solve the basic scientif-
ic-technical problems should be: 
4 ?creation and use of highly productive machinery and equip-
ment for industrial production, construction, agriculture, 
transport and the communal economy, as well as both effective 
means of mechanizing and automating of production processes 
and new, More economical materials; 
?creation and use of highly effective technological produc-
tion processes to ensure integrated utilization of raw and other 
,materials, improvement in the quality of output, reduction in 
'outlays of labor and material expenses, increased productivity 
and improved working conditions; 
? ?further improvement in the methods of organizing and 
managing production and in scientific organization of labor; 
and the creation and use of automated control and data pro-
cessing systems in enterprises, associations, ministries and 
'departments and of automated systems for the control of tech-
nological processes?these systems are to be based on the ap-
plication of mathematical methods, computers and control 
machinery; 
?solution of problems in the area of construction, architec-
ture, agriculture and public health. 
! In order to improve scientific and technical leadership, when 
necessary pilot organizations will be appointed to deal with 
fundamental scientific-technical problems, and scientific di-
rectors or chief designers will be appointed from among lead-
ing scientists and specialists; their assistants will also be ap-
pointed and will be responsible for solving particular parts 
of the problem. 
In addition to the five-year plan for scientific-research 
projects ?acomponent part of the State Five-Year Plan for 
the u.S.S.R. National Economy?coordi-
nated plans are being drawn up to solve basic scientific-tech? 
nical problems, as well as annual plans for applying new 
machinery and technology in the national economy. It has 
also been deemed necessary to have branch and republic five. 
. year and annual plans for research work and for utilization ol 
scientific and technical achievements in production, as well - 
as analogous plans for every scientific institution and enter-
prise.

U.S.S.R. ministries and departments and Union-republic 
Councils of Ministers have been instructed to provide the 
projects stipulated in the coordinated plans with the neces-
sary cash and material-technical resources on a top-priority . 
basis. Control over fulfillment of these plans has been en-
'trusted to the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers' State Committee 
for Science and Technology. 
U.S.S.R. ministries and departments and Union-republic 
Councils of Ministers have been permitted to have in their 
possession an undistributed reserve of up to 2% of budget 
appropriations, within the limits of the total expenditures on ? 
research projects. These funds are to be used to strengthen 
the most important areas of scientific-technical research. 
The U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers' State Committee for Sci-
ence and Technology has been granted the right to redistrib-
ute, in consultation with the ministries and departments, ex- - 
penditures on research work, including the salary fund. 
The research institutions of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sci-
ences, of the Union-republic Academies of Sciences, of branch 
academies and of several ministries and committees have 
been permitted to undertake projects with clients on a con-
tract basis over and above the volume of expenditures on sci?
entific research established by the national-economic plan. 
The U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers' State Committee for 
Science and Technology, the U.S.S.R.. State Planning Commit-
tee, the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Finance and the U.S.S.R. Acad-
emy of Sciences have been charged with elaborating a system 
of planning, statistical and accounting indices for scientific 
and technical development that will make it possible to evalu-
ate the actual economic effectiveness derived from applying 
the results of scientific-technical projects and to determine 
the correctness of technical policy in the branches of the 
national economy. 
The resolution charts steps to develop wide-scale competi-
tion in the scientific-technical area and to prevent a monopoly 
in solving the most important scientific and technical prob-
lems. Toward this end it has been recommended that when 
necessary the ministries and departments, Union-republic 
,Councils of Ministers, the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and - 
'branch Academies of Sciences assign the conduct of explora-
tory research, as well as design, drafting and technological 
'projects, to several organizations that are following different 
'paths. This will make it possible to choose the best scientific, 
technical and economic solutions at the early stages of re-
search and technological-drafting projects. In performing 
particularly important tasks, research projects should be 
carried to the stage of making experimental models for pur-
poses of comparing them and selecting the best ones for use 
in production. 
It is recommended that branch research, design and draft-
ing organizations and enterprises participate widely in the 
most important scientific work done in general-science in-
stitutes and higher educational institutions, with the intentioll. 
of ensuring continuity in scientific-technical projects, all the 
way to their utilization in production. It is essential to deter-
