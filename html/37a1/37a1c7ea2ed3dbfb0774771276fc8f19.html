 China:   Bank Support to Rural Development
 Summary
 Beijing is adjusting its rural banking system
 to meet the needs of the rural  reform program.   In
 recent years:
 -- Agricultural  banks and credit cooperatives
 have altered their loan priorities to support
 the development of specialized households and
 rural industries.
 -- The State Council has granted rural  banks and
 credit cooperatives increased autonomy to
 conduct bank operations.
 -- The central  government has raised interest
 rates on loans and deposits while allowing
 banking authorities greater flexibility in
 setting rates.
 Rural  banking reforms are designed to increase the
 ability of banks to respond to local credit needs
 and to improve the allocation of funds in the
 countrysi de.
 We believe that the rapid growth last year in
 rural  industrial production results,  in part, from
 rural credit reforms already implemented.
 Government policy encouraging further development of
 diversified farming and township and village

 industries, however, will put increasing pressure on
 the rural  banking system to provide funds for
 investment.   Although risking local failures and
 some loss of central control over rural  credit,
 continuing bank reforms should improve the rural
 banking system's ability to support rural
 development.
 REFORMS IN RURAL BANKING
 Introduction of the household responsibility system,
 increases in purchase prices of agricultural staples,  and
 extensive development of rural  industries have caused a surge in
 the supply of and demand for funds in China's countryside.   The
 volume of work conducted by the rural  banking system has
 increased enormously in the last six years, with the number of
 farm clients increasing from 6 million production teams to over
 170 million peasant households.   Beijing has responded by
 shifting rural  loan priorities, by allowing greater
 decisionmaking autonomy at all  levels in the rural  credit
 network,  and by raising interest rates on loans and deposits
 offered by rural banks and credit cooperatives.
 Beijing's commitment to continued reform of the system was
 underscored in a speech by Vice Premier Wan Li  at a national
 rural work conference last December.   Complaining that the rural
 banking system is not yet adept at absorbing and efficiently
 distributing idle funds in the countryside, Wan maintained that
 it is imperative to speed up the transformation of agricultural
 banks and rural credit cooperatives from fund distributing
 administrative organs to independent banks operating under broad
 state supervision.   Wan also praised the efforts of peasants in
 raising and pooling funds outside the rural  banking framework.
 RURAL CREDIT POLICY
 China has initiated two major changes in rural  credit policy
 since 1983 to support the readjustment of production in the
 countryside.   First, agricultural  banks and credit cooperatives
 have switched from primarily supporting communes,  production
 brigades,  and collectives to offering greatly enhanced support
 for individual, and particularly specialized, farm households.
 Second, rural  banks have shifted from mainly supporting
 agricultural production to encouraging development of rural
 industry,  iycluding storage, transport,  and marketing
 operations.    Apropos of the second change, agricultural banks

 have been given primary responsibility for handling monetary
 affairs for industrial  and commercial operations in the rural
 areas.
 In 1985, Beijing plans to provide enhanced banking support
 to rural  industries.   According to press reports early this year,
 the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) and the rural  credit
 cooperatives (RCCs) will  increase their total  volume of loans by
 20 percent, with loans to rural enterprises projected to increase
 by 30 percent, while loans to the2agricultural  sector are
 expected to grow only 10 percent.    Loans for animal  husbandry,
 forestry,  and fisheries are projected to increase by 70 percent,
 50 percent,  and 15 to 20 percent, respectively.   If the planned
 allocations are realized,  by the end of 1985 the combined loan
 portfolio for the ABC and the RCCs will  have the following
 composition:   41.4 percent will  be loans for agricultural
 production,  49.2 percent will  be loans for rural enterprises,  1.1
 percent will  be loans for animal husbandry,  and 8.3 percent will
 be loans for forestry, fisheries,  and side-line activitives.
 Rural banks will adjust interest rates to support Beijing's
 rural development policies.   Preferential  rates will  be offered
 on loans to nonf armi ng enterprises including food and fodder
 processing industries,  small-scale energy projects,   and building
 materials production.   Preference also will  be given to existing
 enterprises seeking funds for modern technology to upgrade
 facilities.  Agricultural  banks will  continue to support
 irrigation projects, rural mining operations, transport and
 marketing activities, and the adoption of scientific farming
 methods.   Rural  banks will  offer loans to farmers for use in
 purchasing agricultural  inputs,  but farmers will  be urged
 increasingly to make use of their own funds to finance
 agricultural production.
 The ABC plans to promote rural  development by offering
 grants of 300 million yuan a year for the next six years to
 China's most economically deprived counties.   In 1985, the ABC
 will  also provide 300 million yuan in special development loans
 for the same areas.
 2At the recently convened National People's Congress,
 Beijing ordered the People's Bank of China to establish quarterly
 credit ceilings for each of the specialized banks  (including the
 ABC).   We do not know whether the ABC and the RCCs will now have
 to curtail their plans to increase loan support to the rural
 sector this year,  but rural  banks are likely to react to any
 credit tightening by putting increased pressure on borrowers to
 speed up repayment of loans--especially those that are overdue.

 BANK AUTONOMY
 Beijing recognizes that budgetary problems will  prohibit the
 state's financial  departments from increasing their investments
 in the countryside for some time.   Since continued rural
 development will  depend largely on the ability of the rural
 banking system to acquire funds from peasants, rural   banks and
 credit cooperatives have been granted increased autonomy and a
 broader range of operations.
 Agricultural Bank of China
 Beijing has reduced the proportion of savings that the ABC
 must hand over to the People's Bank of China (China's central
 bank) and now allows the ABC to redistribute funds within the
 rural  banking network.   Rural  banks have increased flexibility in
 approving (or denying) loan requests for technological
 transformation and other projects.  To enhance the ability of
 rural  banks to support industrial  development, Beijing has
 removed the restriction that all ABC loans be made during the
 spring planting season.
 For the past two years, rural  banks have been allowed to
 extend loans to small, privately-owned businesses in the
 countryside.   Similarly, families engaged in rural  production are
 allowed to hold individual  accounts at rural banks and credit
 cooperatives.   Some provincial  branches of the ABC now offer
 loans to farmers for purchasing automobiles and large farm
 machinery (provided the farmers supply one-half of the required
 capital), while other provincial agricultural  banks have expanded
 their network of RCCs, establishing credit cooperatives at the
 village level.
 Rural Credit Cooperatives
 In order to increase rural savings and to improve the
 allocation of rural funds, the State Council last August released
 a circular encouraging reform of the credit cooperative system.
 The circular proposed a gradual  transformation of the credit
 cooperatives into independent economic entities responsible for
 their own profits and losses,  collectively owned at the village
 level through peasant shareholding.
 Guidelines announced at the provincial  level  suggest that
 the RCCs:
 Will  be controlled locally by a "cooperative members'
 representative assembly" which will elect cooperative
 directors and oversee planning and financial management.
 Will  have freedom to determine the nature, recipients,
 amounts,  and terms of loans it offers, without ABC
 approval.

 -- Will  be allowed to set loans rates within a 20-percent
 band of the state-determined rate.
 -- Will  give priority to shareholders                (which may include
 village workers and rural enterprises) when extending
 1 oans.
 Agricultural Bank officials,  however,  have used the credit
 cooperatives  as their own branches,  and continue to oppose an
 independent role for the RCCs.   According to Embassy reporting,
 the ABC thus far appears to have been successful  in stalling the
 reforms.
 Popular Credit Institutions
 In what is perhaps a concession to an already established
 practice, Beijing has recently encouraged peasants to form
 private credit institutions to support the development of rural
 factories and transport and power networks.   These "popular"
 credit institutions--often taking the form of local  credit unions
 or joint stock operations--were praised by Wan Li  in his December
 speech as important supplements to the ABC and the RCCs.
 According to provincial media,  popular credit institutions often
 outbid rural  banks and credit cooperatives for funds by offering
 higher rates of return,  and extend loans at above-bank rates to
 peasants  and enterprises that have no other place from which to
 borrow.
 We believe that Beijing's willingness to loosen control  of
 rural  credit and risk complaints about usurious interest rates
 reflects a disappointment with the pace of reform in the rural
 banking system.   In his speech, Wan referred to unresolved
 structural  problems that limit rural  banks and credit
 cooperatives.   Supporting the development of private credit forms
 may also be an attempt to diminish the control of rural  cadres
 over credit in the countryside.
 INTEREST RATES
 On 1 January,  1984, China raised the basic monthly interest
 rate for agricultural  production loans from approximately 0.45
 percent to 0.6 percent,  giving the head office of the ABC
 discretion to idjust the rate upward or downward within a 20-
 percent range.    The increase was designed to bring loan rates in
 line with credit conditions in the countryside and the
 discretionary range was instituted to enhance the ability of
 rural banks to differentiate between borrowers.

 at rural  banks in 1984.

 The increase in loan rates was also implemented to correct
 the inverted interest rate structure that was  adversely affecting
 the profitability of rural  banks and credit cooperatives.   The
 success of the household responsibility system in agriculture
 caused a large increase in savings deposits held by individual
 peasants  (which earned a monthly interest rate of 0.24 to 0.75
 percent compared with the 0.15 percent received for deposits by
 commune and brigade collectives).   As the proporation of high-
 interest-rate deposits increased, the cost of rural  deposits
 exceeded the interest that agricultural  banks and credit
 cooperatives received from rural  loans.
 We believe that the rapid growth in China's rural  industrial
 production last year resulted,  in part, from loan support
 provided by the ABC and RCCs.   Loans from private credit
 institutions also appear to have provided an important boost to
 village-level enterprises.   Beijing's policy encouraging further
 development of diversified farming and rural industries,   however,
 will  put increasing pressure on the rural  banking system to
 provide funds for investment.
 Reports that interest rates on private loans are
 considerably higher than rates on bank loans,  along with official
 criticism of the rural  banking system for its inability to absorb
 and efficiently use idle funds, suggest to us that substantial
 barriers exist which inhibit the transfer of credit within the
 system from surplus to deficit areas.   Granting rural  banks and
 credit cooperatives more latitude to set interest rates and
 screen potential borrowers should help improve the allocation of
 funds in the countryside.
 Expansion of credit to specialized farm households and
 privately-operated rural enterprises will  inevitably lead to
 instances of borrowers who are unable to repay loans.   Beijing
 maintains that because the state owns the land,  peasants cannot
 go bankrupt and will  always have claim to a plot of "food grain"
 land.   Supposedly, the state and local authorities will  aid
 peasants who become financially overextended.   Beijing,  however,
 has not spelled out a policy for handling bankruptcies in the
 countryside, and we believe it may not understand fully the
 dimensions of the potential  problems.

 banks and thrifts from the boondocks now going into
 the wholesale money markets for funds, that assump-
 tion is outdated. The Federal Reserve and the treasury
 need to take a greater interest in the middlemen in
 government securities-and weed out the incompetents
 and undesirables before they cause others grief, as
 Drysdale Securities caused grief in 1982 and ESM has
 done to Home State Savings Bank and others this
 month.
 Preventing a loss of confidence among depositors
 throughout the banking system, without., protecting
 individual banks from competition, is a harder task.
 Free-market fundamentalists argue that full insurance
 of deposits inhibits competition because depositors
 have little incentive to choose better banks. But in the
 real world any attempt to make American banks
 compete more freely by dismantling deposit-insurance
 schemes is just about the best way to risk turning local
 banking panics into a national (or even international)
 banking crisis.
 Instead, the few remaining state insurance schemes

 doing. First, because federal regulators are usually
 A bad time to flicker
 Sir Geoffrey Howe hasn't helped a star-wars agreement
 At first sight, Sir Geoffrey Howe's star-wars speech of
 March 15th is an admirable example of the Ooh-Ooh
 approach to difficult subjects. On the One Hand, On
 the Other Hand, goes this approach: and for a careful
 bureaucrat, or an undecided academic, it is a fine way
 of starting down the long, winding road to ultimate
 truth. The British foreign secretary's analysis of the
 pros and cons of President Reagan's Strategic Defence
 Initiative was calm, thorough and balanced. A good
 defence specialist would be delighted to have written it.
 With one exception-what exactly "deterrence" con-
 sists of-its arguments have all appeared in The Econo-
 mist. It was, nevertheless, a mistake.
 Was he carrying Mrs Matchmaker's banner?
 Sir Geoffrey is neither a bureaucrat nor an academic; he
 is a politician. He therefore understood perfectly well
 that everybody would pass lightly over his on-the-one-
 hand pro-Reagan points (such as the fact that Russia
 has an SDI of its own-see page 47-and that Mr
 Reagan has been quite diffident about the prospects of
 America's anti-missile research), but would leap on his
 on-the-other-hand doubts and head-scratchings-the
 cost and uncertainty of the whole thing, the danger that it
 might make deterrence harder, not easier, the "Maginot
 line" phrase. He knew what he was doing. The only
 question is whether Sir Geoffrey did it to separate himself
 from Mrs Thatcher's apparently more tolerant view of
 SDI, or was carrying a banner for Mrs Thatcher herself.
 The answer is almost certainly the latter.
 better qualified and are much better placed to see
 trouble coming now that hardly any financial business is
 confined by state lines. Second, because individual
 depositors cannot be expected to learn to draw a
 distinction between rickety and sound banks.
 Bankers and big investors, however, can be expected
 to learn something from their mistakes. Most of the
 recent losses in American capital markets have come
 because bankers and investors did not understand the
 risks they were taking. ESM, was able to sell more
 government securities than it actually owned because
 many buyers were too ignorant or careless to take
 physical possession of those securities. The more the
 gulled suffer, the less likely are others to repeat their
 mistakes.
 So try to make sure the managers lose their jobs, and
 the bank's shareholders their investments, when com-
 mercial or savings banks fail. It is the depositors who
 need rescuing. Mr Paul Volcker rightly promised to do
 this when he told a meeting of the National Cattlemen's
 Association (yes, really) that the Fed was prepared to
 keep lending funds to the savings banks in Ohio "until
 they are deemed strong enough to reopen".
 Ever since she entertained Mr Mikhail Gorbachev in
 Britain last December, Mrs Thatcher has shown signs of
 wanting to be a matchmaker between him and Mr
 Reagan. Trying to tug Russia and America together is
 not a new phenomenon among west European politi-
 cians. Mr Harold Macmillan felt the urge; so have some
 recent West German chancellors. The problem is not
 just that the would-be European matchmakers have
 relatively little influence over the superpowers. In the
 present missile-and-anti-missile debate, the time for
 matchmaking has not yet arrived.
 It would be wrong, as Sir Geoffrey would agree, to
 call for a ban on anti-missile research. Both sides are
 doing it; the Russians, at any rate, would not open up
 their laboratories to foreign inspectors; and, who
 knows, the research might throw up some useful
 answers. Nor would it make sense to ask both sides to
 promise in advance that even fruitful research will
 never be put into practice.
 The eventual matchmaking hope in Geneva lies in
 the possibility of America and Russia agreeing (a) to
 reduce their missile armouries while (b) writing down
 the rules by which both might move from anti-missile
 research to useful deployment, if the research proves
 that practicable. They are so far only nibbling at the
 edges of that negotiation. Signs of wobbling on the
 western side, such as Sir Geoffrey's speech, will encour-
 age the Russians to hold out for ban-it-all western
 concessions, instead of plodding on towards the desir-
 able deal. Which, to put it mildly, would be a pity.      17
