 "Water Margin":  A Drop in the Bucket
 F
 As campaigns go in China, the criticism of the
 ancient novel "Water Margin" currently fall';; well
 short of a mass political movement.  Although it
 began with a potentially explosive series of arti-
 cles in late August, it has not yet gone beyond the
 study movement phase.  R,gular study sessions re-
 portedly are being held to criticize the novel in
 some areas, but there are no signs of political ac-
 tivism--individuals singled out for criticism or
 posters attacking current leaders.  Undoubtedly,
 there are many in the leadership who would like to
 see the "Water Margin" issue remain within its cur-
 rent confines.
 There is some evidence that the criticism of
 the novel lacked the careful preparations usually
 associated with a major political campaign.  China's
 publishing houses are trying to fill rush orders of
 the novel, many of which will not be off the press
 until late September.  The Shanghai journal Study
 and Criticism clearly was taken by surprise:   its
 August issue praised the novel, but the followinc;
 issue had to turn around and criticize it.
 Since the publication. of the People's Daily
 editorial of September 4, which included the first
 public reference to Mao as the initiator of the
 campaign, the provinces have begun to comment on
 the novel.   In the August articles, which harped
 on "amnesty" and called for opposing the emperor,
 amnesty could have been read as a swipe at the
 rehabilitated Teng Hsiao-ping, and the emperor,
 lacking any public reference to Mao, could have

 In light of the propaganda surrounding last
 year's anti-Confucius campaign, which seemed to
 use historical analogy to criticize certain mili-
 tary commanders for being pro-Soviet, it is possible
 to read the current criticism as a continuation
 of that charge.  Since the fall of Lin Piao, Mao
 has seemed concerned that some elements in the mili-
 tary are sympathetic to Lin's alleged pro-Soviet
 views.  Moreover, the Chairman apparently fears that
 some change in China's policy toward Moscow could
 occur after his dea':h.   Some communist officials
 25X1          I                      interpreted the "Water Margin"
 criticism in precisely that light, and several
 propaganda broadcasts have noted the importance of
 this criticism "in the present and in the future"
 and "in this century and the next."
 .Although the Chairman may have had specific
 targets in mind when launching the "Water Margin"
 criticism, others in the leadership seem content
 to allow study of the novel merely as an educational
 exercise warning against the dangers of following

 Teng and others in the leadership seem more
 interested'in creating a stable political climate
 to encourage economic growth than in promoting po-

 aganda, in fact, continues to condemn factionalism
 and to call for unity even as it discusses "Water

 Toying with Taipei
 For the second time in the past six months,
 1eking has r:.leagea3 a large group of imprisoned
 Chinese Nationalist officials in a move seemingly
 designed to satisfy several important foreign policy
 objectives.
 Most important, the release last week of nearly
 150 "US-Chiang special agents," captured on the main-
 land in the mid-1960s, is intended to characterize
 Peking as magnanimous and seriously interested in
 attempts to open contacts with the Nationalists on
 Taiwan.  By announcing that the prisoners are free
 to go to Taiwan if they wish, Peking has again issued
 a tacit invitation for opening some sort of dialogue
 with Taipei.  The move is also a signal to Washington
 --as preparations are being made for President Ford's
 trip to China--that Pelting is being "reasonable" on
 the Taiwan question.
 Taipei will probably reject any future requests
 from released "special agents" to visit Taiwan, as
 it did earlier this year when ten released "war
 criminals" asked for permission to visit relatives
 on the island.  Despite the adverse propaganda, espe-
 cially in the Hong Kong press, that resulted from the
 cold-shouldering of these ten, Nationalist leaders
 seem persuaded that any suggestion that they are pre-
 pared to deal with Peking would carry great risks.
 Taipei will probably be in for even rougher press

 in a major speech on the day after the "special
 agents" were released, Premier Chiang pointedly
 reiterated Taipei's firm opposition to any dialogue
 with either Peking or Moscow.
 Included in the batch of prisoners released
 last week were two Japanese who had participated
 in Nationalist operations against the mainland.
 Their inclusion, coming at a time when Sino-Japanese
 negotiations for a peace treaty are deadlocked, was
 almost certainly intended in part as a friendly ges-
 ture to Tokyo.  The move, however, is not likely
 have a significant impact on the negotiations.

 A Show of Unity
 b080023-7          25X1
 Leadership appearances over the past few weeks,
 amid speculation that China's leaders are once again
 engaged in behind-the-scenes fighting, seemed de-
 signed to present at least a facade of unity.
 The most surprising, and perhaps most calcu-
 lated, display occurred at an agricultural confer-
 ence in Shansi Province on September 15.  Heading
 the turnout was senior Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
 His unlikely companions included Chiang Ching and
 Yao Wen-yuan, neither of whom have any known agri-
 cultural duties.  Teng and Vice Premier Chen Yung-
 kuei spoke at the conference, and their speeches re-
 portedly received enthusiastic applause.  Chiang
 Ching, on the other hand, made her first quasi-
 public speech since the Cultural Revolution. It was
 described as "important," but was not disseminated
 in the propaganda and was not described as being
 greeted with applause.
 In an apparent bid for publicity, Chiang Ching
 eschewed the makeup so noticeable during the banquet
 for Sihanouk in early September in exchange for a
 rag over her head and a shovel in her hands.   She
 was photographed digging an irrigation ditch, along
 with Chen Yung-kuei.  Another photograph apparently
 taken at the conference and appearing in People's
 Daily was that of Teng Hsiao-ping flanked by Chiang
 Ching and Yao Wen-yuan--an obvious display of unity
 between the perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution
 and one of its most prominent victims.  The confer-
 ence was presided over by Vice Premier Hua Kuo-feng,
 thus confirming that he continues to hold important
 agricultural responsibilities.
 Yao Wen-yuan continued his high public profile
 with a number of appearances, including escort duties

 for visiting North Vietnamese party chief Le Duan.
 Yao did not take part in the substantive talks with
 him, however.  Also given unusual prominence of late
 is the shadowy Wang Tung-hsing, who logged in at
 least five appearances in September.   Previously,
 Wang rarely appeared in public and then only on ma-
 jor occasions.
 Some leaders who were missing from public view
 earlier returned to the spotlight, and others were
 accounted for.  Party vice chairman Wang Hung-wen
 reportedly returned to troubled Chekiang Province
 in early September.   Teng Hsiao-ping's wife, Cho
 Lin, appeared at the mid-September agricultural con-
 ference, and Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying was on
 hand for the Le Duan visit.   Television shots showed
 the 77-year-old defense minister being assisted into
 the banquet hall, however, confirming long-standing
 rumors that his health is declining.

 Chekian :   Pilgrim's Progress
 Peking's movement of troops into Hangchou ap-
 pears to have stabilized the situation there, and
 production is said to be increasing, but armed
 clashes have been reported recently in another city
 in the troubled province, and it is evident that no
 long term solution has been achieved.  Deep fac-
 tional divisions remain throughout Chekiang and
 the authority of the party first secretary, an out-
 sider who headed another province prior to the Cul-
 tural Revolution, is still being called into ques-
 tion.
 Hangchou is rela-
 tive I y cam.     num er or             leaders have re-
 portedly been arrested, but one faction is said to
 have criticized first secretary Tan Chi-lung for not
 being harsh enough on the incarcerated leader of the
 rival faction. This prompted party vice chairman
 Wang Hung-wen, who remains deeply involved in efforts
 to restore order, to reiterate Peking's support for
 Tan and to criticize both factions.
 Chekiang and Peking radiobroadcasts have made
 repeated claims that production in the province is
 rising.  A September 5 Chekiang broadcast, for ex-
 ample, listed 32 enterprises that had fulfilled August
 nrnrlnnf-.inn quotas.  Nevertheless,

 to near zero in many areas because of the recurring
 factional struggles.
 The armed fighting in Chekiang reportedly oc-
 curred in Wenchou earlier this month.  Since the
 militia is involved in the factionalism and was
 abolished in several cities, the only sure method
 for preventing continuii.g outbreaks of violence
 outside of Hangchou would seem to be the use of
 troops, but that is imp.:actical for the whole of
 Chekiang.   Perhaps the authorities will attempt to
 pacify Hangchou first and then deal with the most
 troubled areas in the rest of the province.
 The situation in Chekiang illustrates the dif-
 ficulty of bringing in an outsider to run a divided
 province.   There have been cases where Peking has
 broken factional deadlocks by removing the leaders
 of both factions, as in Shansi, or by bringing in a
 new face.   In the past such new leaders have invari-
 ably been military men, however, and some of them
 brought their armies along.   This solution is not
 practical today.   It runs counter to Peking's goal
 of reducing the number of military men in provincial
 leadership posts.  Thus, although Tan Chi-lung was
 appointed first secretary in May 1973, he has been
 without a real power base. and has obviously been

 Thu Soviet Threat:   Rhetoric or Politics?
 25X1
 25X1
 For some time the Chinese media have warned
 that US-USSR contention inevitably will lead to
 war.  While this theme is still. being pushed, in
 recent weeks the Chinese people are being told in
 addition that war between China and the Soviet
 Area i.ng    a word    a

 the Chinese seem to be saying that they
 will be forced into a superpower war soon after
 it breaks out or that war will begin with a Soviet
 attack on China.   In either case Chinese officials
 are stressing that there is a new and ominous
 threat from the Soviet Union.
 These points all seem to reflect Central Directive
 No. 18 which focuses on Moscow as a threat to peace
 and calls for the modernization of the PLA.   In
 conveying this line, Chinese official3 are exhort-
 ing the people to prepare for war.

 Although the "war preparations" theme has
 never completely dropped out of Chinese propaganda,
 it has not received special prominence in overt
 propaganda in the past few weeks.  This suggests
 that the line being taken privately is directed
 solely at an internal audience.   There are a number
 of domestic purposes which the war theme could
 serve.  The threat of war might well help the Chi-
 nose people accept an overhaul of the army.   It
 might also--in connection with the demobilization
 of a large number of soldiers--contribute in some
 measure to popular understanding of the necessity
 to settle some of the demobilized soldiers in rural
 rather than urban areas.
 Equally important, the "war preparations"
 theme is being trotted out by Peking to emphasize
 current foreign policy lines.   By raising the specter
 of an increased Soviet military threat, Peking is
 lending further rationale to this stronger anti-Soviet
 line which has appeared in the (Chinese press during
 the past few months.  Most recently, "war prepara-
 tions" dovetails well with the movement to criticize
 the novel Water Margin, which provincial broadcasts
 use to chastize any form of reconciliation with the
 Soviet Union.
 The war preparations line is also being used
 to promote worker discipline and increase production.
 Labor unrest and worker factionalism during the past
 several months has been a serious problem for the
 regime, resulting in set:.)acks to production.  As
 conveyed .:o workers in the factories, Central Di-
 rective No. 18 quotes Mao on the need for unity,
 stability, and promotion of production.    Factory
 workers have been told to stay at their jobs in the

 home the urgency of this order, it was stressed that
 an accidental war could break out at any moment.

 While there can be no doubt that the Soviet
 threat is being used to shape and reinforce public
 opinion, there is probably more to it than that.
 It is probably worth noting that the last time a
 Soviet attack was widely trumpeted in China was
 also the last time there was a major reordering
 of priorities in the PLA.   In the latter half of
 1971, after the fall of Lin Piao, the press began
 to warn of an impending Soviet attack.  At about
 the same time military training increased markedly
 until it received roughly equal status with army
 political activities.   Spending for sophisticated
 weaponry, however, was cut back sharply.
 While there are obvious differences, the cur-
 rent situation is similar.                               The prospact of a war
 with the USSR is being used in a highly visible way
 to justify a major change in military policy, and
 there is no dearth of evidence that military pri-
 orities have been a contentious issue within the
 Chinese leadership since at least the late 1960s.
 It is possible that in 1971 and today the Soviet
 threat has been and is being used to politically
 neutralize elements in the leadership who might
 object to these readjustments of priorities.  By
 making opposition to Central Directive No. 18 tan-
 tamount to being pro-Soviet, it becomes more haz-
 ardous--in the current climate--to resist the
 directive.
 It is anyone's guess whether the same faction
 that opposed the 1971 decision is today unhappy
 about Central Directive No.  18.   In this connection,
 it may be significant that both decisions are
 moves toward elevating military over po1itic'1
 training

 Military versus political training has long
 been a bone of sharp contention in China.   it
 seems to have led in large part to the purge in
 1965 of Chief of Staff Lo Jui-china, who was a
 strong advocate of military training, and it prob-
 ably is no coincidence that Lo was rehabilitated
 in August, only weeks after Directive No. 18 was
 issued.
 25X1             they were not concerned about NATO force reductions
 ent level.   Since early 1973 Peking has emphasized
 that Moscow has its sights principally fixed on
 Europe rather than China.  Peking is continuing to
 take this tack to encourage the Europeans to keep
 their defenses strong--and this works to China's
 strategic advantage.  To do an about face and say
 that the Soviets are intent on attacking China
 would undercut this theme entirely.   In 1971 the
 Chinese had no such difficulty in discussing the
 Soviet threat in their press, since at that time
 Chances are that the Chinese will not escalate
 the war issue and the Soviet threat beyond its pres-
 in Europe.

 Provincial Leadership Changes
 Continue Apace
 A flurry of promotions and new appointments
 marked the provincial leadership picture in Septem-
 ber.   First secretaries were named in Shansi and
 Liaoning, and a total of eight changes were an-
 nounced.  Although one of the new first secretaries
 is a career military officer, six of the appoint-
 ments went to civilians.  The high number of assign-
 ments continues Peking's drive toward consolidating
 provincial leadership despite signs of heightened
 political tensions in the initial stages of the
 campaign to criticize the novel "Water Margin."
 Only two provinces, Hei..iungkiang and Tsinghai,
 now lack designated first secretaries.  Nine of
 China's twenty-nine province level units are headed
 by military men, but most are commissars rather than
 troop commanders--a reversal of the case before the
 rotation of military region commanders.  The com-
 missars are less of a threat to civilian party au-
 thority and are probably better able to operate in
 the political milieu than some of the commanders.
 Civilian first secretaries now outnumber military
 men by two to one.
 The appointment of Wei Ping-kuei and the appar-
 ent appointment of Liu Sheng-tien as secretaries of
 the Liaoning party committee (Liu was listed ahead
 of a known Liaoning secretary at the national con-
 ference on Tachai held in Shansi recently) may be
 designed to counterbalance the promotion of Tseng
 Shao-shan from second secretary to first secretary.
 Tseng is a military man and 1,1ei and Liu are civil-
 ians.   Wei and Liu are the first secretaries to be

 added to any of the three provinces constituting the
 Shenyang Military Region since the rotation of the
 former commander, Chen Hsi-lien, to Peking in late
 December 1973.  Most provinces in other .,yeas have
 added secretaries, and the failure in Heilungkiang,
 Kirin--and Liaoning until recently--to do so suggests
 that Chen may retain some influence in his former
 region.  There are indications that changes may be
 in the cards for Kirin and Heilungkiang, which now
 needs a first secretary, so the unusually static
 situation in Manchuria may be coming to an end.
 In any event, the new party boss in Liaoning,
 who is the first political commissar of the military
 region, has close ties to Chen Hsi-lien.  He served
 immediately under Chen from 1937 to 1950, and with
 him after the Korean War.  However, Tseng Shao-shan
 also has historical ties to Teng Hsiao-ping and to
 Li Te-sheng, the current regional commander, who
 used to be Tseng's subordinate.

 Problems in China's Steel Industry

 Factors which contributed to the fall in steel
 production in the second half of 1974 continued into
 1975.    Labor unrest was a major cause.  Dissatisfac-
 tion over wages and factional fighting have led to
 a high rate of absenteeism among steel workers.
 C
 managers used various ruses
 stay away  rom the mills, thus further complicat-
 ing production problems.
 The shortage of coal has been another major
 contributing factor to the poor performance of the
 steel industry.  Labor difficulties are responsible
 for part of the coal shortage, but a longer stand-
 ing problem is that of inadequate equipment.  China
 possesses huge coal reserves but lacks the modern
 equipment to exploit them fully.  In recent years,
 Peking has begun to import new capital equipment
 and move away from a policy that stressed labor in-
 tensive methods as a means of increasing coal out-
 put.  Nevertheless, it will require many years be-
 fore maximum utilization of coal reserves can be
 achieved.

 China's total steel supply has been further
 hampered by a decline in imports from Japan.  In
 the first six months of 1975, imports amounted to
 only 900,000 tons, a decline of more than one third
 compared to the same period last year.  Japanese
 steel exports to China of more than 2.8 million
 metric tons in 1974 composed 80 percent of China's
 total steel imports.  Delayed steel trade negotia-
 tions, mainly due to Chinese demands for lower
 prices, contributed to the decline.
 At midyear, China's leaders began to take steps
 to correct some of the most critical problems in the
 industry.  Two recent central directives have strongly
 condemned the disruption of production caused by
 labor unrest and factionalism.  A July Red Flag
 article specifically dealt with factionalism in the
 iron and steel industry.  Troops have been sent to
 the provinces of Chekiang, Kiangsu, and Inner Mon-
 golia to help improve steel or coal production.
 In June 1975, Peking re-entered the market for
 US steel scrap as a means of increasing production.
 In 1973, more than 420,000 tons of US scrap were
 imported by China.  After export controls were im-
 posed by the US in 1974, Chinese scrap imports de-
 clined to about 190,000 tons and no purchases were
 made after April of that year.   Controls were lifted
 at the beginning of 1975 and nearly 100,000 tons of
 scrap were exported to China during June and July.
 If outstanding problems are resolved, produc-
 tion in 1976 probably can surpass the 1973 level
 of 25.5 million tons.  Nevertheless, shortages of
