 Toying with Taipei
 For the second time in the past six months,
 Peking has released a large group of imprisoned
 Chinese Nationalist officials in a move seemingly
 designed to satisfy several important foreign policy
 objectives.
 Most important, the release last week of nearly
 150 "US-Chiang special agents," captured on the main-
 land in the mid-1960s, is intended to characterize
 Peking as magnanimous and seriously interested in
 attempts to open contacts with the Nationalists on
 Taiwan.   By announcing that the prisoners are free
 to go to Taiwan if they wish, Peking has again issued
 a tacit invitation for opening some sort of dialogue
 with Taipei.   The move is also a signal to Washington
 --as preparations are being made for President Ford's
 trip to China--that Peking is being "reasonable" on
 the Taiwan question.
 Taipei will probably reject any future requests
 from released "special agents" to visit Taiwan, as
 it did earlier this year when ten released "war
 criminals" asked for permission to visit relatives
 on the island.   Despite the adverse propaganda, espe-
 cially in the Hong Kong press, that resulted from the
 cold-shouldering of these ten, Nationalist leaders
 seem persuaded that any suggestion that they are pre-
 pared to deal with Peking would carry great risks.
 Taipei will probably be in for even rougher press
 treatment this time around.   The Chinese announced
 Monday that permission had been given to 65 of the
 released agents to return to Taiwan.   This much
 larger group includes relatively younger men and they
 presumably have many relatives living on Taiwan.  More-
 over, they are closely linked with Nationalist Premier
 Chiang Ching-kuo, who was in charge of mainland opera-
 tions at the time of their capture.  Nevertheless,

 in a major speech on the day after the "special
 agents" were released, Premier Chiang pointedly
 reiterated Taipei's firm opposition to any dialogue
 with either Peking or Moscow.
 Included in the batch of prisoners released
 last week were two Japanese who had participated
 in Nationalist operations against the mainland.
 Their inclusion, coming at a time when Sino-Japanese
 negotiations for a peace treaty are deadlocked, was
 almost certainly intended in part as a friendly ges-
 ture to Tokyo.  The move, however, is not likely to
 have a significant impact on the negotiations.   (CON-

 A Show of Unit
 Leadership appearances over the past few weeks,
 amid speculation that China's leaders are once again
 engaged in behind-the-scenes fighting, seemed de-
 signed to present at least a facade of unity.
 The most surprising, and perhaps most calcu-
 lated, display occurred at an agricultural confer-
 ence in Shansi Province on September 15.   Heading
 the turnout was senior Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
 His unlikely companions included Chiang Ching and
 Yao Wen-yuan, neither of whom have any known agri-
 cultural duties.   Teng and Vice Premier Chen Yung-
 kuei spoke at the conference, and their speeches re-
 portedly received enthusiastic applause.  Chiang
 Ching, on the other hand, made her first quasi-
 public speech since the Cultural Revolution. It was
 described as "important," but was not disseminated
 in the propaganda and was not described as being
 greeted with applause.
 In an apparent bid for publicity, Chiang Ching
 eschewed the makeup so noticeable during the banquet
 for Sihanouk in early September in exchange for a
 rag over her head and a shovel in her hands.   She
 was photographed digging an irrigation ditch, along
 with Chen Yung-kuei.   Another photograph apparently
 taken at the conference and appearing in People's
 Daily was that of Teng Hsiao-ping flanked by Chiang
 Ching and Yao Wen-yuan--an obvious display of unity
 between the perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution
 and one of its most prominent victims.   The confer-
 ence was presided over by Vice Premier Hua Kuo-feng,
 thus confirming that he continues to hold important
 agricultural responsibilities.
 Yao Wen-yuan continued his high public profile
 with a number of appearances, including escort duties

 for visiting North Vietnamese party chief Le Duan.
 Yao did not take part in the substantive talks with
 him, however.  Also given unusual prominence of late
 is the shadowy Wang Tung-hsing, who logged in at
 least five appearances in September.   Previously,
 Wang rarely appeared in public and then only on ma-
 jor occasions.
 Some leaders who were missing from public view
 earlier returned to the spotlight, and others were
 accounted for.   Party vice chairman Wang Hung-wen
 reportedly returned to troubled Chekiang Province
 in early September.   Teng Hsiao-ping's wife, Cho
 Lin, appeared at the mid-September agricultural con-
 ference, and Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying was on
 hand for the Le Duan visit.   Television shots showed
 the 77-year-old defense minister being assisted into
 the banquet hall, however, confirming long-standing
 rumors that his health is declining.   (SECRET NO FOR-

 Chekiang:   Pilgrim's Progress
 Peking's movement of troops into Hangchou ap-
 pears to have stabilized the situation there, and
 production is said to be increasing, but armed
 clashes have been reported recently in another city
 in the troubled province, and it is evident that no
 long term solution has been achieved.   Deep fac-
 tional divisions remain throughout Chekiang and
 the authority of the party first secretary, an out-
 sider who headed another province prior to the Cul-
 tural Revolution, is still being called into ques-
 tion.
 Han
 chou is
 rela-
 g
 tively calm.  A number of factional leaders have
 re-
 portedly been arrested, but one faction is said
 to
 have
 criticized first secretary Tan Chi-lung for
 not
 being
 harsh enough on the incarcerated leader of
 the
 rival
 faction.  This prompted party vice chairman
 Wang
 Hung-wen, who remains deeply involved in efforts
 to restore order, to reiterate Peking's support for
 Tan and to criticize both factions.
 Chekiang and Peking radiobroadcasts have made
 repeated claims that production in the province is
 rising.   A September 5 Chekiang broadcast,  for ex-
 ample, listed 32 enterprises that had fulfilled August
 production quotas.  Nevertheless,               reports
 that while the situation in Chinhua city in Chekiang
 is improved, the factories still only operate five
 hours a day.   On the other hand,
 said that since troops moved into his factory in
 Hangchou in late July and began to labor alongside
 the workers, the factory is back on an eight hour
 day.  The level of operation may vary widely in
 Chekiang, but the simple fact of restoring order
 and getting the workers back into the factories
 undoubtedly increases production, which had fallen

 to near zero in many areas because of the recurring
 factional struggles.
 The armed fighting in Chekiang reportedly oc-
 curred in Wenchou earlier this month.   Since the
 militia is involved in the factionalism and was
 abolished in several cities, the only sure method
 for preventing continuing outbreaks of violence
 outside of Hangchou would seem to be the use of
 troops, but that is impractical for the whole of
 Chekiang.   Perhaps the authorities will attempt to
 pacify Hangchou first and then deal with the most
 troubled areas in the rest of the province.
 The situation in Chekiang illustrates the dif-
 ficulty of bringing in an outsider to run a divided
 province.   There have been cases where Peking has
 broken factional deadlocks by removing the leaders
 of both factions, as in Shansi, or by bringing in a
 new face.   In the past such new leaders have invari-
 ably been military men, however, and some of them
 brought their armies along.   This solution is not
 practical today.   It runs counter to Peking's goal
 of reducing the number of military men in provincial
 leadership posts.   Thus, although Tan Chi-lung was
 appointed first secretary in May 1973, he has been
 without a real power base and has obviously been
 unable--and rather unwilling, according to some re-
 ports--to resolve factional problems.   Tan is now
 supported by a revamped provincial leadership, the
 presence of Peking leaders like Wang Hung-wen, and
 by the rotated troops, but it is not yet clear that
 he has gained firm control over this long-troubled
 province.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/CONTROLLED

 The Soviet Threat;   Rhetoric or Politics?
 For some time the Chinese media have warned
 that US-USSR contention inevitably will lead to
 war.   While this theme is still being pushed, in
 recent weeks the Chinese people are being told in
 addition that war between China and the Soviet
 Union is highly likely.  At high-level cadre
 briefings as well as study sessions in factories
 and schools, Peking is spreading the word that
 China will be involved in a war within the next
 few years.
 the Chinese seem to be saying tnat tney
 wi    be   orced into a superpower war soon after
 it breaks out or that war will begin with a Soviet
 attack on China.   In either case Chinese officials
 are stressing that there is a new and ominous
 threat from the Soviet Union.
 At a recent meeting in Hong Kong ranking com-
 munist cadres were even told that war between China
 and the USSR is "inevitable."   It was argued that
 Moscow's aggressive intentions were quite evident
 from its high military expenditures, whereas the US
 has adopted a "defensive posture."   In a similar
 vein, Ta Kung Pao editor Fei I-min in a conversa-
 tion with US officials left the impression that the
 Chinese are quite concerned about a Soviet attack
 on China.   Moreover, high level cadres involved in
 propaganda work in China have been told that while
 it is possible that the US might initiate a war,
 in all probability the Soviets would start it.
 These points all seem to reflect Central Directive
 No. 18 which focuses on Moscow as a threat to peace
 and calls for the modernization of the PLA.   In
 conveying this line, Chinese officials are exhort-
 ing the people to prepare for war.

 Although the "war preparations" theme has
 never completely dropped out of Chinese propaganda,
 it has not received special prominence in overt
 propaganda in the past few weeks.  This suggests
 that the line being taken privately is directed
 solely at an internal audience.  There are a number
 of domestic purposes which the war theme could
 serve.   The threat of war might well help the Chi-
 nese people accept an overhaul of the army.   It
 might also--in connection with the demobilization
 of a large number of soldiers--contribute in some
 measure to popular understanding of the necessity
 to settle some of the demobilized soldiers in rural
 rather than urban areas.
 Equally important, the "war preparations"
 theme is being trotted out by Peking to emphasize
 current foreign policy lines.   By raising the specter
 of an increased Soviet military threat, Peking is
 lending further rationale to the stronger anti-Soviet
 :Line which has appeared in the Chinese press during
 the past few months.   Most recently,  "war prepara-
 tions" dovetails well with the movement to criticize
 the novel Water Margin, which provincial broadcasts
 use to chastize any form of reconciliation with the
 Soviet Union.
 The war preparations line is also being used
 to promote worker discipline and increase production.
 Labor unrest and worker factionalism during the past
 several months has been a serious problem for the
 regime, resulting in setbacks to production.  As
 conveyed to workers in the factories, Central Di-
 rective No.  18 quotes Mao on the need for unity,
 stability, and promotion of production.  Factory
 workers have been told to stay at their jobs in the
 interest of national defense.   In order to bring
 home the urgency of this order,  it was stressed that
 an accidental war could break out at any moment.

 While there can be no doubt that the Soviet
 threat is being used to shape and reinforce public
 opinion, there is probably more to it than that.
 It is probably worth noting that the last time a
 Soviet attack was widely trumpeted in China was
 also the last time there was a major reordering
 of priorities in the PLA.   In the latter half of
 1971, after the fall of Lin Piao, the press began
 to warn of an impending Soviet attack.  At about
 the same time military training increased markedly
 until it received roughly equal status with army
 political activities.   Spending for sophisticated
 weaponry, however, was cut back sharply.
 While there are obvious differences, the cur-
 rent situation is similar.                              The prospect of a war
 with the USSR is being used in a highly visible way
 to justify a major change in military policy, and
 there is no dearth of evidence that military pri-
 orities have been a contentious issue within the
 Chinese leadership since at least the late 1960s.
 It is possible that in 1971 and today the Soviet
 threat has been and is being used to politically
 neutralize elements in the leadership who might
 object to these readjustments of priorities.  By
 making opposition to Central Directive No.  18 tan-
 tamount to being pro-Soviet, it becomes more haz-
 ardous--in the current climate--to resist the
 directive.
 It is anyone's guess whether the same faction
 that opposed the 1971 decision is today unhappy
 about Central Directive No.  18.   In this connection,
 it may be significant that both decisions are
 moves toward elevating military over political
 training within the PLA.   Since Directive No.  18
 was issued, provincial broadcasts have come down
 on both sides of the training issue, which suggests
 continuing controversy.

 Military versus political training has long
 been a bone of sharp contention in China.   It
 seems to have led in large part to the purge in
 1965 of Chief of Staff Lo Jui-ching, who was a
 strong advocate of military training, and it prob-
 ably is no coincidence that Lo was rehabilitated
 in August, only weeks after Directive No. 18 was
 issued.
 Chances are that the Chinese will not escalate
 the war issue and the Soviet threat beyond its pres-
 ent level.             Since early 1973 Peking has emphasized
 that Moscow has its sights principally fixed on
 Europe rather than China.   Peking is continuing to
 take this tack to encourage the Europeans to keep
 their defenses strong--and this works to China's
 strategic advantage.   To do an about face and say
 that the Soviets are intent on attacking China
 would undercut this theme entirely.   In 1971 the
 Chinese had no such difficulty in discussing the
 Soviet threat in their press,  since at that time
 they were not concerned about NATO force reductions
 in Europe.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/NO DISSEM

 Provincial Leadership Changes
 Continue A ace
 A flurry of promotions and new appointments
 marked the provincial leadership picture in Septem-
 ber.   First secretaries were named in Shansi and
 Liaoning, and a total of eight changes were an-
 nounced.  Although one of the new first secretaries
 is a career military officer, six of the appoint-
 ments went to civilians.   The high number of assign-
 ments continues Peking's drive toward consolidating
 provincial leadership despite signs of heightened
 political tensions in the initial stages of the
 campaign to criticize the novel "Water Margin."
 Only two provinces, Heilungkiang and Tsinghai,
 now lack designated first secretaries.   Nine of
 China's twenty-nine province level units are headed
 by military men, but most are commissars rather than
 troop commanders--a reversal of the case before the
 rotation of military region commanders.   The com-
 missars are less of a threat to civilian party au-
 thority and are probably better able to operate in
 the political milieu than some of the commanders.
 Civilian first secretaries now outnumber military
 men by two to one.
 The appointment of Wei Ping-kuei and the appar-
 ent appointment of Liu Sheng-tien as secretaries of
 the Liaoning party committee  (Liu was listed ahead
 of a known Liaoning secretary at the national con-
 ference on Tachai held in Shansi recently) may be
 designed to counterbalance the promotion of Tseng
 Shao-shan from second secretary to first secretary.
 Tseng is a military man and Wei and Liu are civil-
 ians.   Wei and Liu are the first secretaries to be

 added to any of the three provinces constituting the
 Shenyang Military Region, since the rotation of the
 former commander, Chen Hsi-lien, to Peking in late
 December 1973.  Most provinces in other areas have
 added secretaries, and the failure in Heilungkiang,
 Kirin--and Liaoning until recently--to do so suggests
 that Chen may retain some influence in his former
 region.   There are indications that changes may be
 in the cards for Kirin and Heilungkiang, which now
 needs a first secretary, so the unusually static
 situation in Manchuria may be coming to an end.
 In any event, the new party boss in Liaoning,
 who is the first political commissar of the military
 :region, has close ties to Chen Hsi-lien.   He served
 immediately under Chen from 1937 to 1950, and with
 him after the Korean War.   However, Tseng Shao-shan
 also has historical ties to Teng Hsiao-ping and to
 Li Te-sheng, the current regional commander, who
 used to be Tseng's subordinate.   (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Angolan Blues
 As the deadline for Angolan independence draws
 nearer, Peking's involvement with the contending
 factions there appears to be growing ever more
 troublesome.  China's latest setback involves Tan-
 zanian President Nyerere's refusal to forward a
 shipment of Chinese arms to Jonas Savimbi's National
 Union, the smallest of Angola's three liberation
 groups.  Peking apparently decided to respond to a
 request for aid from Savimbi several months ago
 when units of the Soviet-backed Popular Movement
 appeared to be moving toward a clear-cut military
 victory over both the National Union and Holden
 Roberto's National Front--which has received the
 bulk of Chinese assistance.*  Some - of Chi-            25X18
 nese arms arrived in Dar es Salaam in late August
 destined for delivery to the National Union via
 Zambia under an agreement reached some time ago
 by Nyerere, Zambia's Kaunda, and Savimbi.  The Tan-
 zanians, however, have been sitting on the shipment
 for over a month.
 In explaining his action to Savimbi at the
 recent Lusaka meeting on Rhodesia and Angola,
 Nyerere--whose sympathies for the Popular Movement
 have become more apparent in recent months--claimed
 *In his speech the UN last Friday,  Foreign Minister
 Chiao Kuan-hua claimed that Peking had "stopped giving
 new military aid to the three Angolan organizations"
 when Portugal agreed to grant Angola independence on
 November 11.   From the Chinese viewpoint,  "new" is
 undoubtedly the operative word in this statement;
 China has continued to try to honor old commitments
 to its Angolan clients by funneling arms through
 African intermediaries such as Zaire, Zambia and
 Tanzania.

 that he could not "in good conscience" take steps
 that would "escalate the fratricide" in Angola.
 Nyerere said that the Chinese had pressed him to re-
 verse his decision on the arms shipment by arguing
 that Tanzania had made a commitment to store and
 transship material for various African liberation
 groups.   Nyerere claimed that he had told the Chi-
 nese that he would not contribute to a struggle
 between China and the Soviet. Union which cost the
 lives of "brother Africans" and admitted that his
 actions have caused strains in Sino-Tanzanian rela-
 tions.
 Peking is no doubt incensed over Nyerere's
 reneging on the arms shipment--as well as by the
 unsuccessful effort by Nyerere and Mozambique's
 Samora Machel to gain formal recognition for the
 Popular Movement at the Lusaka meeting.  The Chi-
 nese reaction, however, may be tempered by the need
 to limit the damage to the carefully and expensively
 constructed Sino-Tanzanian relationship and by the
 realities of the situation in Angola.
 China's move to shore up the National Union
 was most likely undertaken originally as part of an
 effort to nudge Savimbi's group toward a formal alli-
 ance with Holden Roberto's fading National Front.
 Peking probably reckoned that the Popular Movement
 might then agree to a cease-fire and the re-estab-
 lishment of a tripartite transition coalition.  The
 chances for such a development have diminished, how-
 ever, in the face of the unyielding rivalry between
 the Popular Movement and the National Front and by
 Savimbi's failure to show much interest in formally
 aligning himself with the Front.  Under these condi-
 tions, Peking would appear to have little to gain and
 much to lose if it tried to apply the sort of pres-
 sure that might make Nyerere reverse his stand on the
 arms shipment.
 Zambia's stand in the bruhaha over the embargoed
 arms may provide some small measure of consolation

 for Peking.        During the acrimonious exchange between
 Nyerere and Savimbi, Kaunda reportedly took the Na-
 tional Union side and tried to persuade Nyerere that
 the Soviet-sponsored Popular Movement was largely
 responsible for the continuing bloodshed in Angola.
 Kaunda, of course, had good reason to make a show
 of support for Savimbi since the Benguela railroad--
 which previously carried a significant portion of
 Zambia's copper exports and will again become impor-
 tant once the fighting stops in Angola--runs through
 National Union territory.  Nevertheless, Peking will
 probably be heartened that Kaunda has not been stam-
 peded into the Popular Movement camp and will read
 this as a sign of improvement in Sino-Zambian rela-
 tions.   In recent weeks both Peking and Lusaka have
 apparently been trying to repair damages to their
 ties caused by a blow-up this spring over differing
 views on the Rhodesian question (see Chinese Affairs,
 May 27, 1975).   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/CONTROLLED

 Problems in China's Steel Industry
 In the first half of 1975, China's steel in-
 dustry continued the dismal performance of the last
 half of 1974.  Even with the corrective measures
 now in force to boost output, production in 1975 is
 unlikely to improve much over the 1974 level of 23.8
 million tons, 7 percent below the level achieved in
 :L973.
 Factors which contributed to the fall in steel
 production in the second half of 1974 continued into
 1975.   Labor unrest was a major cause.   Dissatisfac-
 tion over wages and factional fighting have led to
 a high rate of absenteeism among steel workers.    Re-
 ports also indicate that managers used various ruses
 to stay away from the mills, thus further complicat-
 ing production problems.
 The shortage of coal has been another major
 contributing factor to the poor performance of the
 steel. industry.   Labor difficulties are responsible
 for part of the coal shortage, but a longer stand-
 ing problem is that of inadequate equipment.   China
 possesses huge coal reserves but lacks the modern
 equipment to exploit them fully.   In recent years,
 Peking has begun to import new capital equipment
 and move away from a policy that stressed labor in-
 tensive methods as a means of increasing coal out-
 put.  Nevertheless, it will require many years be-
 fore maximum utilization of coal reserves can be
 achieved.
 At least three of China's major steel plants,
 Anshan, Wuhan, and Paotou, are known to have experi-
 enced production difficulties in 1975.  These plants,
 with a combined capacity of about 10 million tons,

 TOP SECRET UMBRA
 compose roughly one third of China's total steel-
 making capacity.   In addition, reporting has indi-
 cated that smaller plants such as Nanchang have ex-
 perienced production shortfalls.
 China's total steel supply has been further
 hampered by a decline in imports from Japan.   In
 the first six months of 1975, imports amounted to
 only 900,000 tons, a decline of more than one third
 compared to the same period last year.   Japanese
 steel exports to China of more than 2.8 million
 metric tons in 1974 composed 80 percent of China's
 total steel imports.   Delayed steel trade negotia-
 tions, mainly due to Chinese demands for lower
 prices, contributed to the decline.
 At midyear, China's leaders began to take steps
 to correct some of the most critical problems in the
 industry.   Two recent central directives have strongly
 condemned the disruption of production caused by
 labor unrest and factionalism.  A July Red Flag
 article specifically dealt with factionalism in the
 iron and steel industry.   Troops have been sent to
 the provinces of Chekiang, Kiangsu, and Inner Mon-
 golia to help improve steel or coal production.
 In June 1975, Peking re-entered the market for
 US steel scrap as a means of increasing production.
 In 1973, more than 420,000 tons of US scrap were
 imported by China.  After export controls were im-
 posed by the US in 1974, Chinese scrap imports de-
 clined to about 190,000 tons and no purchases were
 made after April of that year.   Controls were lifted
 at the beginning of 1975 and nearly 100,000 tons of
 scrap were exported to China during June and July.
 If outstanding problems are resolved, produc-
 tion in 1976 probably can surpass the 1973 level
 of 25.5 million tons.  Nevertheless, shortages of
