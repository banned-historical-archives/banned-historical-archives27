 SOUTH AFRICA: Summit Results
 I          I The few details available thus far on the summit
 con erence of five southern African presidents and Rhodesian
 nationalist leaders in Dar es Salaam indicate that much of the
 two day meeting focused on strengthening the military effort
 against Rhodesia. The brief communique issued at the conclusion
 of the talks mentioned only that the liberation struggle would
 be intensified.
 I      I The five presidents probably have held off making
 any   ina  decisions until they assess the results of Secretary
 Kissinger's meeting with South African Prime Minister Vorster
 last weekend. Reliable reports confirm that no progress was
 made toward uniting the fragmented nationalist movement.
 Meanwhile,  Prime Minister Vorster will meet wi
 o esian Prime Minister Smith early next week to brief Smith
 on the results of his talks with Secretary Kissinger.

 Rhodesian security forces claim that they have been
 inflicting heavy casualties on guerrillas, but the level of
 insurgent activity appears not to have been affected.
 According to government figures,  131 guerrillas were
 killed in Rhodesia during August--the highest monthly total
 since the fighting began in 1972. Press reports indicate, how-
 ever, that the insurgents last week made one of their largest
 attacks ever. Some 100 guerrillas are said to have followed up
 a mortar and rocket barrage by raiding a Rhodesian army outpost
 near Mtoko in northeast Rhodesia.
 //In southeastern Rhodesia, the guerrillas,
 according to press reports, shot down a helicopter last week. The
 Rhodesian air force faces a serious shortage of trained heli-
 copter pilots following the withdrawal of South African pilots

 eastern l  odesia, there have been further reports of small-scale
 activity in the west. A guerrilla was killed after killing two

 LEBANON: Situation Report
 I             The Syrians are apparently stressing in talks with
 Lebanese leaders this week the need for full cooperation with
 the future government of president-elect Sarkis.
 25X1                       Damascus'  main concern is the inauguration itself,
 which   as now been officially scheduled for September 23, the
 expiration date of President Franjiyah's term.

 The Syrians would like to hold the swearing-in cere-
 mony at Shaturah, which is well within Lebanese territory con-
 trolled by Syrian forces. This would allow the 25 or 30 members
 of the Lebanese parliament who are now living in Syria to attend.
 I            Several sites in Beirut reportedly are also under
 consi er     ion, but the Syrians no doubt are concerned that hold-
 ing the ceremony in the capital would lead to a potentially ex-
 plosive security situation similar to the convocation of the
 parliament there last April. Moreover, if significant numbers
 of parliamentary deputies are prevented from attending the ses-
 sion, Sarkis'  inauguration could be challenged on legal grounds.
 I             Before his departure for Damascus yesterday, Shamun
 apparently remarked publicly that current efforts to forge a
 new basis for negotiations will come to naught and that the
 fighting will escalate dramatically before Sarkis is able to
 take office. Shamun's railings will reinforce the suspicion
 among many Palestinians and Lebanese Muslims that the current
 round of talks in Damascus is laying the groundwork for another
 major Christian-Syrian offensive.
 I      I Tensions in Beirut have risen markedly over the last
 severer    ays as the various factions steel themselves for the
 crucial period before the scheduled inauguration. The US em-
 bassy in Beirut reports that artillery duels along the main
 dividing line between the Christian and Muslim sectors of the
 city have intensified. The Arab League security forces patrolling
 the main cross-over point have also come under direct fire from
 combatants who apparently want to prevent any movement between
 the two zones.
 I             In their talks with Phalanges Party leader Pierre
 Jumayyi   early this week, the Syrians pushed the idea that re-
 constituting a military that will be responsive to Sarkis must
 begin immediately. They reportedly presented a detailed proposal
 for rebuilding the Lebanese army with the Syrian-controlled
 "Vanguards of the Lebanese Army" as the core of the new command.

 The Syrians began building the Vanguards soon after
 ei.r intervention in Lebanon,  and although it is not a large
 force,    its members have been hand-picked. Most are Shia and
 Sunni Muslims who are sympathetic to Damascus and have no affil-
 iation with any Lebanese militia.
 The Syrians emphasized to Jumayyil and presumably
 aiso to Camille Shamun the need for cooperation among the Chris-
 tian parties. The Syrians want Sarkis to have sufficient stature
 to conduct meaningful negotiations,  and they recognize that this
 stature must derive primarily from Sarkis'  ability to control
 his fellow Christians. Jumayyil has from the start been a sup-
 porter of Sarkis; however, Shamun has a long-standing personal
 grudge against the president-elect, and in any case, opposes
 negotiations under any auspices until the Palestinians have
 been more thoroughly chastened.
 USSR-SYRIA-LEBANON: Pravda Statement
 The USSR has issued an authoritative and relatively
 moderate statement on Lebanon to convey its support for a negoti-
 ated settlement. A statement in Tuesday's Pravda, signed "observer"
 to signify Kremlin endorsement, criticizes both the Syrian inter-
 vention in Lebanon and--for the first time--"leftist elements"
 within the Palestinian movement.
 I    I The US embassy views the article as an attempt by the
 Soviets o put moderate, reasoned views on record.  In calling
 for a "reasonable compromise" as the "only" way out, Moscow is
 admitting its inability to do anything to improve the Palestin-
 ians' worsened military and political situation. The item also
 omits any indication that Moscow would be able to play any sort
 of international role in resolving the crisis.
 The statement criticizes Palestinian leftists for
 'rejecting out of hand any peaceful proposals," and calls atten-
 tion to the deep split within the Palestinian leadership over
 negotiations. This will be interpreted by Palestine Liberation
 Organization leader Yasir Arafat as an endorsement of his
 position.

 The Pravda article--which is also Moscow's most
 authoritative criticism so far of the intervention of Syrian
 forces in Lebanon--terms the Syrian decision "harmful."
 IThe Soviets are still pulling their punches, however,
 by retraining from forthrightly calling for a Syrian withdrawal
 and instead expressing tacit agreement with the demands of
 "many Arab countries and other countries" that Syrian forces
 leave. Soviet commentary is obviously bent on not antagonizing
 Damascus more than necessary.
 Unlike the last "Observer" article on Lebanon, in April,
 the current article does not go out of its way to castigate Israel  25X1
 or to raise the possibility of US military intervention.

 //The delay of the announcement may be the re-

 agree on the proposed economic measures. More conservative mem-

 hikes on imports, wage curbs, and a devaluation of the escudo.//
 //Members of the Socialist Party's left wing,
 however, are re uctant to go along with any measures that might
 provoke opposition from the Communist Party, which has vowed to
 fight measures deemed contrary to workers'  interests.//

 institute economic reforms to support the request he made last

 mapping out an appropriate program. He conceded, however, that
 his advisers are evenly divided on the question of devaluation.

 POLAND:  Leadership
 Poland's current economic troubles have led to specu-
 about party
 chief Gierek's future.
 Several influential Polish journalists recently told
 a US diplomat that they were "absolutely fed up" with the Gierek
 regime. They appeared, however, to place the blame on the system
 as a whole and did not hold Gierek personally responsible. One
 predicted that Prime Minister Jaroszewicz would be the first to
 go, but implied that within a year Gierek would follow.
 I             Gierek is undoubtedly in a weaker position now than
 he was before June. We have seen no indications, however, of
 any movement within the party or from the Soviets to unseat him.

 Occasional reports over the past 18 months have suggested grow-
 ing dissention and factionalism within the Politburo, but no
 Pole or foreign observer has yet been able to link these asser-
 tions with specific names. Decision-making is evidently still
 by consensus and not fiat.
 Several factors argue that Gierek will stay on as
 first secretary for at least the next year:
 --Prior to June, Gierek was generally regarded as favoring
 a go-slow policy on raising prices.
 --There has been no public outcry for Gierek's removal.  In
 1970, when Gierek came to power during riots over food
 price increases,  the public had become incensed by brutal
 police suppression, and demanded the ouster of Gierek's
 predecessor. During the demonstrations this year,  the po-
 lice were held in check,  and Jaroszewicz has taken much of
 the blame for the price fiasco.
 --Gierek's resignation would publicly underscore the re-
 gime's weakness, something neither the party nor Moscow
 wants.
 --No one is standing in the wings ready to take over.
 Gierek has no designated heir-apparent, and the leadership
 realizes that a mere change in face at the top will not
 satisfy the public, which is concerned about solutions to
 serious economic problems. Any replacement would more than
 likely be one of the current Politburo members, and no one
 in that body could ins ire more public confidence than
 does Gierek himself.
 POLAND:  Party Plenum
 I     I Polish party leaders have evidently decided not to
 risk pu is anger by raising food prices in the near future.

 In a speech to workers last Friday, party chief Gierek
 said the politburo will propose the establishment of five teams,
 one of which will deal with establishing principles for pricing
 meat. He added that these teams will have at least a year to
 carry out their studies.
 The leadership thus appears to have backed away from
 Prime Minister Jaroszewicz's proposal in July to increase the
 prices of meat and meat products by 35 percent this year, while
 holding other foodstuffs stable.
 I     I The public has been showing its discontent since the
 abortive attempt to raise food prices in June. The current ten-
 sion is mainly the result of severe shortages of sugar, meat,
 and other consumer goods, and the leadership has probably de-
 cided that it is politically too dangerous to introduce higher
 prices on top of the shortages.
 I Sugar rationing was introduced in mid-August to halt
 a speculative surge in buying that threatened to deplete stocks.
 Forgoing meat price increases this year could lead to meat ra-
 tioning to assure a more equitable distribution of available
 supplies.
 I     I In his speech, Gierek called for public patience un-
 til the economy can work its way out of the present difficul-
 ties. He frankly admitted that there are serious problems in
 supplying the population with meat and other products. He also
 commented favorably on church-state relations in an obvious bid
 to win support from the church during troubled times.
 I     I Today's Central Committee plenum will consider Polit-
 uro recommendations on the food price issue and also on stimu-
 lating agricultural production. The Central Committee plenum,
 the first since February,  is long overdue. The leadership evi-
 dently chose not to consult the Central Committee before an-
 nouncing the June price package, and this failure irritated
 many of its members.

 USSR - US - SOUTH AFRICA
 Soviet commentary on the US - South African talks
 in Zuric      has stressed the role played by Secretary Kissinger,
 indicating Moscow's apprehension over the possibility that
 "shuttle diplomacy" will be resumed.
 Writing in Pravda on Tuesday, senior political
 commentator Yuriy Zhukov charged that the US role in Africa
 may cause "new dangerous complications" in the area and that
 the Secretary was trying to maintain "racists" in power.
 I             iDuring the talks, Soviet media accused the US of
 resorting to "illusory compromises, dubious half-measures,
 and political maneuvers" to create the "semblance" of a solu-
 tion. The message to black African leaders is to be wary in
 dealing with the US.
 I              IThe Soviets are already concerned that Secretary
 Kissinger s efforts may bear fruit. The chief of the USA
 Institute's Foreign Policy Department,  G.  A.  Trofimenko,  re-
 marked to a US embassy official on Tuesday that he personally
 viewed the Secretary's activities in Africa as a "carbon
 copy" of the US approach in the Middle East.
 The selection of Zhukov--a well-connected commentator
 who usually deals with major East-West issues--to write the
 Pravda commentary strongly suggests that more than just Afri-
 can issues are being addressed.  Zhukov's direct criticism of
 Secretary Kissinger appears to be part of an increasing inclin-
 ation on the part of the Soviets to find fault with the US ad-
 ministration in general and the Secretary's role in particular.

 of Teng highlighted the editorial's stricture against fac-
 tionalism and its lenient attitude toward mistaken officials.
 I             There is some evidence, however, that the August 23
 editorial was not endorsed by the entire leadership. Several
 articles in the national media published within days of the
 editorial diverged from it by arguing for a continuation and
 broadening of the anti-Teng campaign.

 them to be toppled.

 than the editorial with which they are taking issue. They also
 have not been widely replayed in China, suggesting that most

 The fact that People's DaiZiy has seen fit to publish
 so many editorials on boosting production and curbing faction-
 alism, however, suggests some resistance to concentrating on
 economic rather than political issues. Teng in fact has been
 attacked by the leftists all year for doing just that.
 Media treatment of Premier Hua Kuo-feng further
 suggests that, although the more conservative members of the
 leadership are in the ascendancy, the political infighting is
 far from over.
 Hua has finally emerged as the leading spokesman for
 earthquake relief efforts. At a reception on September 1 for
 "heroes" in relief work, he gave his most impressive speech to
 date on a domestic issue, emphasizing economic priorities and
 paying only perfunctory attention to the anti-Teng campaign.
 I     I Immediately following the earthquake, however, Hua's
 activities as the leader of the relief group received very
 little publicity.  It was several days after the group had left
 Peking to visit the stricken areas before Hua was publicly
 identified as head of the group, and People's Daily did not
 begin showing pictures of him in the earthquake area until
 nearly two weeks after the earthquake.
 //This delay in publicizing Hua's activity caused
 some Peking residents to grumble that the Premier had been slow
 to react,// which apparently was not the case. The delay did
 suggest, however, that those in charge of the media were not
 anxious to push Hua into the limelight.
 (S NF)    Even more unusual is the see-saw media treatment
 of Wu Te, Peking's party boss and a member of the Politburo.
 Wu was the only leader of an earthquake-stricken area not to
 participate publicly in relief activities,
 The controversy surrounding Wu probably involves his
 position in the national government. He is the leading candi-

 The death of Mao Tse-tung, announced this morning, will
 no   come as a traumatic surprise to the Chinese populace; the
 regime has been preparing the public for this event for some
 time through wide dissemination of photographs showing an in-
 creasingly aged and infirm Chairman. The political repercussion
 9f his demise, however, may well last for years.
 I          Mao had been an important member of the Chinese Com-
 munist Party since its founding in 1921, and Chairman since
 the mid-1930s.   He has been the most important man in China
 since the Communists took power in 1949 and the central refer-
 ence point in the often confused politics of the party for
 much longer. Even when his will was partly thwarted by others
 in the Chinese leadership whose policy views differed from his
 own, his personality and programs could never be ignored;
 even his opponents claimed to be speaking in his name and to
 be carrying out his commands.
 As the dominating force in Chinese politics,  a
 oun er of the party, the formulator of the "Chinese way" to
 communism and the man who led the Chinese revolution to
 triumph, Mao will be irreplaceable. There is no one on the
 Chinese scene today who even remotely commands the authority
 that has been accorded to him or  who can easily assume the
 charismatic role of leader of the Chinese people he exercised
 for years.
 In the upper echelons of the party, however, the
 Chairman's death may come as something of a relief to a con-
 siderable number of second-level leaders. Mao's autocratic
 actions, suspiciousness and sometimes erratic policy shifts
 were almost certainly resented by some of his associates and
 subordinates, particularly in the past decade. Some of these
 individuals are now likely to believe that more orderly and
 rational approaches to policy problems can be taken without
 fear of reprisals from the Chairman.
 Although Mao's place in the three-thousand-year-old
 history of the Chinese state is likely to loom large, one
 conspicuous failure in his long domination of the political
 scene is already glaringly evident and is likely to have
 serious implications for the future. The Chairman did not
 Approved For Released 2007/03/06 : CIA-RDP79T00975PI029300010014-1
 Approved For Rele
 succeed in providing for a widely acknowledged and recognized
 successor. Two designated successors, Liu Shao-chi and Lin
 Piao,     fell by the wayside in 1966 and 1971 respectively.
 A third, Teng Hsiao-ping, who appeared in a position
 to Inherit much of Mao's authority if not the formal title
 of party chairman, was removed from all his high positions
 in early April. At the same time,  the young Wang Hung-wen,
 who by virtue of his position in the hierarchy seemed to
 have a shot at succession to the formal title of party
 chairman--but probably without much of the authority that
 normally could accrue to that post--was passed over for
 promotion last April.   Finally, Chou En-lai, who by virtue
 of his experience and the respect accorded him by most Chi-
 nese was perhaps the most logical of all possible successors
 to Mao, died last January.
 For several years the Chinese have talked about
 post-Mao arrangements in terms of a collegial group which
 would in effect share the Chairman's authority among them-
 selves. Such an arrangement is entirely possible,  at least
 in the short run,  since it seems clear that no single in-
 dividual has the stature to replace Mao in his full leader-
 ship capacity.
 It is possible,  in fact, that the post of party
 chairman may now be retired, as a post that could only be
 held by the irreplaceable leader who has just died. The
 Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan followed a similar procedure
 at the death of Chiang Kai-shek last year.  In this case,
 Peking would probably revive the post of party secretary-
 general, which has been dormant since the start of the Cul-
 tural Revolution, in order to provide a manager for party
 affairs.
 If the post of Chairman is to be filled, however,  the
 most likely candidate for the job is Premier Hua Kuo-feng,
 who is now "first" party vice chairman, a new post created
 in early April, at the time of the fall of Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Hua is, however, a compromise figure who lacks a strong power
 base and who has operated at the center of power for only a
 few years.  In his hands the post of chairman would be less
 important than it was when Mao occupied the position. Moreover,
 there are almost certainly a number of senior leaders of the
 party who would prefer that additional power and prestige did

 not accrue to Hua. There have been occasional covert attacks
 on Hua in the media since January,  and his deputy in Hunan
 Province, which he ran before coming to Peking, has been under
 heavy political pressure for several months.
 I       frt is possible, therefore, that Hua's elevation to
 the chairmanship could be contested, and in fact any deci-
 sion to fill the post might be put off for some time.   It
 is also possible that if Hua were elevated to the chairman-
 ship, he could be balanced off by a reconstitution of the
 post of secretary-general.  In this case a leading candidate
 for that job would be the leftist political boss of Shanghai,
 Chang Chun-chiao, who probably performs the functions of
 secretary-general on a de facto basis at present. There is
 certain to be opposition to this appointment from the party's
 right wing, however.
 If the post of chairman were abolished, that of the
 current party vice chairman would also have to be abolished.
 In addition to Hua,  the other vice chairmen are Wang Hung-wen,
 whose youth makes him suspect to many older party members
 and whose alignment with the left wing of the party is
 a major disability in the eyes of the rightists,  and Defense
 Minister Yeh Chien-ying, a long-time associate of the late
 Chou En-lai who has been identified with the party's right
 wing and who came under criticism earlier this year for
 his vehement support of Teng Hsiao-ping.
 argument The balance these two men provide could be an
 for preserving the system of chairman and vice
 chairmen.  If, however, that system is scrapped, Hua Kuo-feng
 would be an obvious candidate for the secretary-general's
 post. Since Chang Chun-chiao also has claims on this job,
 a clash between the two could easily develop.
 Insofar as the principle of collegiality is fol-
 lowed by the Chinese, the three current vice chairmen, Chang
 Chun-chiao and Peking Military Region Commander Chen Hsi-
 lien would almost certainly form the core of the collective.
 These five men are the most powerful in China today. They
 are not likely to work easily together, however.   The
 left-right split between Yeh, on the one hand, and Wang and
 Chang, on the other, is already pronounced, and as already
 noted there is potential for serious friction between Chang
 and Hua.

 I         IChen, even more than Yeh, the defense minister, is
 likely to represent military interests in the collective.
 Many important military figures have resented the leftist
 leaders since the days of the Cultural Revolution, and to
 the degree that Chen speaks for them, he could. come into
 conflict with Chang and Wang. Chen, however,  appears to be
 an ambitious man whose personal interests could lead him
 into temporary and expedient alliances with any civilian
 faction.   He is reported to have abandoned Teng Hsiao-ping
 at a crucial juncture last January,  for example, and this
 move may have been an important factor in Teng's subse-
 quent political demise.
 Latent factionalism among the ruling group is
 likely to come to the fore rather quickly, in fact. Mao's
 death occurs at a tense and rather fluid moment in Chinese
 politics. Repercussions from the Teng purge are still
 echoing throughout the country--in the provinces and in
 Peking. The fissure between the party's right and left wings
 is perhaps wider than at any time since the late stages of
 the Cultural Revolution, and the issue of relations between
 the military and civilian members of the party is still not
 fully resolved. Since the attacks on Teng began,  the army
 has begun to reemerge as an important factor in political
 affairs; this tendency is likely to become more pronounced
 in the wake of Mao's death.
 his confused situation makes a struggle among the
 various factions in the leadership all but inevitable,  and
 this struggle is likely to make itself manifest. sooner rather
 than later. Mao has died at an unpropitious moment for the
 party's left wing, however. This group--a minority in
 the party and among the leadership--has not yet managed to
 achieve a solid and largely unassailable position,  as it
 clearly hoped to do before the Chairman's death. Mao had
 his differences with the leftists in recent years, but they
 were at most times able to play on his obsessive concern
 for the development of an equalitarian China, and their
 enemies were inhibited by fear that Mao could intervene
 on their behalf in unexpected fashion. This inhibition has now
 been removed.
 one likely victim of these changed circumstances
 is Mao s wife, the termagant Chiang Ching. She is widely
 disliked, and without the Chairman's potential protection

 Approved For ReleaO
 she may well fall by the wayside rather quickly. The left
 as a whole is in fact now in a somewhat unenviable position.
 It is likely to be on the defense in whatever struggle
 develops in the wake of Mao's death.   Nevertheless,  leftist
 leaders, although a minority,  speak for a significant
 portion of the Chinese party,  and the struggle,  if it
 develops, is not likely to be resolved quickly.
 I    I This fact, plus the obvious difficulty the Chinese
 will have in adjusting to a China without Mao, is likely
 to inhibit the development of new policy initiatives and to
 slow the implementation of policies already adopted, both
 in the domestic and foreign policy spheres.  If the military
 gains an increased voice in policy-making, however, it is
 possible that Peking may become more receptive to the idea
 of moderating somewhat its unyielding opposition to the
