PREFACE 
Cloud physics and weather modification research is being con-
ducted on an increasingly large scale in at least 15 countries in addition 
to the United States and the USSR. Some ultimate objectives are to 
improve man's ability to augment precipitation in areas of little or no 
rainfall, to dissipate fog and low clouds, to prevent or reduce hail 
formation, and to control or dissipate large storm systems such as hurri-
canes and typhoons. In addition, weather modification experimentation 
has potential military applications. 
This report is an evaluation of Communist Chinese research in 
cloud physics and weather modification, with special emphasis on basic 
theoretical research and cloud seeding programs. The effects of the 
Cultural Revolution upon Chinese research in these fields are unknown, 
but their programs probably have been affected to some degree. Little 
information on basic research has been received since the cessation 
of publication of the major scientific journals in mid-1966. 
The present report updates an earlier report on the same subject, 
 and supplements a recent gen-
eral study on Chinese meteorology. It was prepared by the Office of 
Scientific Intelligence and coordinated with the Directorate of Intelli-
gence. It is based mainly on a study conducted for OSI  
\ Information received through October 
1968 is included.

CHINESE CLOUD PHYSICS AND 
WEATHER MODIFICATION RESEARCH 
PROBLEM 
To evaluate Chinese research in cloud physics and weather modification. 
CONCLUSIONS 
1. The Chinese are substantially behind the lead-
ing nations, whose work they have followed closely, 
in cloud physics and weather modification research. 
Organization of these efforts on a national scale is 
not apparent and no orderly, long-range program 
appears to be in progress. The Chinese have demon-
strated little improvement in their weather modi-
fication experiments since the late 1950s. They have 
decreased the number of field experiments and have 
reported few quantitative measurements. 
2. From the early 1960s to mid-1966, the Chinese 
emphasized basic theoretical studies in cloud phys-
ics in an effort to explain cloud dynamics and pre-
cipitation processes. Although this research exhibits 
a wide range of quality, only a limited number of 
investigators and organizations appear to be capable 
of producing high-quality theoretical analyses. The 
Chinese are strongest in the mathematical and 
analytical aspects of cloud physics and weakest in 
data collection techniques. This emphasis on a 
theoretical approach may eventually lead to more 
significant results than their hapazard experimental 
work. 
3. Few Chinese laboratory experiments in cloud 
physics have been noted. Of those reported, most 
were crude and the concepts and instrumentation 
used were quite similar to those of earlier foreign 
experiments. 
4. Chinese cloud physics and weather modifica-
tion instrumentation development is far below the 
quality and quantity of that of the leading nations. 
The majority of instruments are of low quality or 
are prototypes, a major handicap to the Chinese. 
Ground-sampling techniques predominate. There is 
little indication that aircraft sampling techniques 
are used. 
SUMMARY 
Communist China has been conducting weather 
modification experiments since at least 1958. The 
initial activity, which was prompted by a major 
drought, consisted of several cloud seeding experi-
ments to produce rain. The early experiments, as 
well as those noted since the late 1950s, were crude, 
with little or no apparent scientific control. In addi-
tion, little basic research was evident in the early 
stages of this effort. 
CONrIDENTIAL 
In the early 1960s fewer experiments were noted 
and more emphasis was placed on theoretical re-
search. Chinese literature at this time consisted 
mainly of reviews of the work being performed by 
foreign countries. Typical work of this period was 
a series of monographs published in 1965 which 
presented the state-of-the-art and results of Chi-
nese studies. These were also intended to serve 
meteorological workers and educators as reference

texts and several were concerned with such aspects 
of physical meteorology as cloud structure, ice 
nuclei, and cloud and rain droplet size spectra. 
Papers were authored by relatively high-level 
meteorologists, such as Chao Chi-p'ing of the In-
stitute of Geophysics and Meteorology, who re-
ported in 1963 on the progress of research on cloud 
current dynamics. 
Chinese scientific literature up to mid-1966 is 
characterized by a steady increase in papers on 
cloud physics research while the number of articles 
on experimentation has decreased. Most of the Chi-
nese cloud physics research, conducted at the Insti-
tute of Geophysics and Meteorology by several of 
their leading meteorologists such as Ku Chen-ch'ao, 
has been published in Acta Meteorologica Sinica. 
The published papers show that the Chinese have 
improved somewhat their theoretical cloud physics 
research, but most of their work consists of repeti-
tions or extensions of previous foreign experiments 
and has produced nothing outstanding. While their 
mathematical and analytical work is strong, par-
ticularly in stochastic treatment of warm cloud proc-
esses, the Chinese have not developed or made good 
use of radars, computers, aircraft samplers, and 
other instrumentation. However, some unsophisti-
cated cloud physics instruments which are adequate 
for measurements not requiring high precision have 
been developed. The improvement in Chinese theo-
retical research in cloud physics will probably con-
tinue and may lead to more significant achievements 
in weather modification than the unorganized ex-
perimental approach of the early years. 
There is no evidence of a well coordinated large-
scale program in either weather modification or 
observation systems capable of greatly improving 
their understanding of the physical processes of 
clouds. Observational and other hardware limita-
tions severely limit Chinese abilities to conduct 
effective field programs. More recent weather modi-
fication attempts also have shown the lack of sci-
entific control that was evident in early experiments. 
Most of the experiments were conducted on a local 
scale by commune members, usually with the as-
sistance of aircraft of the People's Liberation Army. 
In all cases noted, these activities were in support 
of local agricultural programs by attempting arti-
ficially to produce rain or disperse hail clouds. 
These experiments reportedly produced good results 
but their verification techniques have been ques-
tionable. Their true success, therefore, is doubtful. 
This is especially true in their use of "sky-high fire-
works" to combat hail. 
There is a possibility of a chance discovery due 
to their freedom to seed or otherwise modify clouds 
at will. They appear to be unaffected by the various 
political, sociological, and legal restrictions that 
often exist in other countries. 
DISCUSSION 
BACKGROUND 
Weather modification studies in Communist 
China began in the late 1950s with a number of 
crude attempts to modify cloud and precipitation 
processes, mainly for the purpose of increasing 
precipitation in agricultural areas. Although these 
attempts were widespread, no quantitative meas-
urements were reported and few attempts at con-
trolling the experiments or of measuring their re-
sults were noted. Experimentation began because 
of a severe drought in northeast China. The Twelve 
Year Plan for Meteorology ( formulated in 1956) 
included cloud physics research and weather modi-
fication. These programs were later affected by the 
Great Leap Forward, the Soviet withdrawal, and 
probably the Cultural Revolution.' 
Through the early 1960s modification attempts 
diminished and more emphasis was placed on theo-
retical studies to examine and explain the basic 
cloud dynamics and precipitation processes. Rela-
tively high-level personnel, such as Ku Chen-ch'ao 
( 7457/7261/3390 ) and Chao Chi-p'ing ( 1560/ 
4764/1627) were reported to be leading such atmos-
pheric physics studies, illustrating their importance 
to the Chinese.23 A selected list of organizations 
and key personnel is included as an appendix. 
Work in the early 1960s centered around the 
collection of papers relating to Chinese cloud phys-

ics studies which resulted in a series of monographs 
published in 1965.4 5 These monographs presented 
the results of selected Chinese studies and were 
intended to serve as a reference text for meteorolo-
gists and educators. While the overall quality of 
these papers was not high, their significance was in 
their value as a single-source reference for an in-
troduction to some of the problems in cloud physics 
under investigation. 
BASIC THEORETICAL RESEARCH 
The main Chinese effort in cloud physics, subse-
quent to the diminished widespread modification 
experiments of the late 1950s, has been in basic 
theoretical research. Published Chinese literature 
on cloud physics research increased after 1959 
while the number of articles on weather modifica-
tion experiments declined. They rapidly increased 
their theoretical cloud physics research and this 
trend may have continued. Although no outstand-
ing achievements have thus far resulted, their 
studies follow closely those of the USSR and the 
West, and their theoretical approach may lead to 
more significant achievements in weather modifica-
tion than the earlier, more haphazard, field experi-
ments. Their mathematical and analytical work is 
strong, particularly in stochastic treatment of warm 
cloud processes.� Three of a total of six cloud 
physics articles published in Acta Meteorologica 
Sinica in 1966 may be classified as theoretical or 
basic research. This proportion is roughly indica-
tive of their interests and activity during 1963-1965 
and is also typical of a series of monographs pub-
lished in 1965. 
One of these articles is related to the coalescence 
processes occurring in a large scale vertical motion 
field.1 The second article is a mathematical treat-
ment of the earth's electrical field potential and 
makes computations of the distribution of electrical 
potential in a vertical cross section of a thunder-
storm and at the earth's surface in the vicinity of a 
thunderstorm.� The results are claimed to be better 
than those of Wilson ( England) or of Frenkel 
( USSR) whose previous work is referenced. This 
claim, however, is not supported by the paper. 
The last of the three articles is the latest in a 
long series of theoretical papers concerning the 
growth of cloud drops under conditions of small 
scale fluctuations. This subject and the Chinese 
emphasis upon warm cumulus cloud growth caused 
by "fluctuations" were first introduced in a paper 
by Ku Chen-ch'ao published in 1962. This paper 
was the first article relating to cloud physics to be 
published in Acta Meteorologica Sinica. Ku pub-
lished four additional articles relating to this effect 
in Acta Meteorologica Sinica in 1962 and 1963. In 
his 1963 article he suggested that the concept of 
gravitational coalescence, which takes into account 
eddy fluctuations in the vertical currents, repre-
sented a more reasonable explanation of rain in 
warm clouds than other theories do.� Similar ideas 
had been suggested as early as 1947 in the litera-
ture of other nations to explain precipitation from 
nonfreezing clouds. The Chinese press, however, 
promoted this idea as a "new precipitation theory ad-
vanced by China's 'Young Weather Workers'." 10 11 
Other Chinese meteorologists adopted Ku's concept 
of the effects of fluctuating environments of mois-
ture and turbulence, resulting in the appearance 
of more articles on this topic than any other be-
tween 1964-1966. Ku's influence is clearly evident 
in Chinese investigations and published articles in 
the cloud physics area. While this would be ex-
pected owing to his position as head of the Atmos-
pherics Physics Laboratory of the Institute of Geo-
physics and Meteorology, the extent of this follow-
the-leader attitude is striking and may indicate a 
reluctance of other Chinese meteorologists to strike 
out on their own. 
The latest example of the continuing Chinese 
interest in warm cloud precipitation theory is a 
mathematical treatment of the probability of con-
tinuous growth of cloud drops published in June 
1966.12 The authors' conclusions were that, while 
vertical motion fluctuations were dominant in con-
densation processes to about the 20 micron size, 
fluctuations in moisture content plays the principal 
role in stochastic growth of droplets beyond 20 
microns by continuous coalescence. Ku Chen-ch'ao's 
guidance and encouragement are acknowledged.12 
The complexity of the mathematical treatment of 
the problem is more impressive than the conclu-
sions which are simply more refined explanations 
of Ku's earlier conclusions. 
An earlier article deserves mention because of its 
further indication that the Chinese have at least a 
few scientists working in the Institute of Geophysics 
under Ku who are capable of performing high-level 
theoretical research. This article, published in

1964, is excellent and concerns the development 
of a three-dimensional model for cumulus cloud 
growth.13 It is noteworthy that calculations for the 
model were reportedly carried out on an unidenti-
fied computer. Computers available to Chinese me-
teorologists prior to this time appear to have been 
almost exclusively reserved for numerical weather 
prediction work. Although published Chinese work 
indicates a wide range of scientific quality, only a 
limited number of personnel and organizations ap-
pear capable of producing high-quality theoretical 
analyses. 
LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS 
Few Chinese laboratory experiments in cloud 
physics have been reported. Perhaps the most 
notable work reported recently (1966) was con-
ducted at the Lan-chou Institute of Geophysics on 
the investigation of the growth of frost needles on 
the surface of frozen water drops in an electric 
field.14 The instrument setup was relatively simple 
and utilized easily accessible items. The experiment 
was well conceived but the author admitted that 
it was an extension of a Soviet experiment con-
ducted in 1962. The Soviet experiment showed that 
the growth of frost needles by deposition of super-
cooled fog droplets in the presence of an electric 
field is accompanied by electrification of the drop-
lets, but quantitative measurements were not 
made." The Chinese measurements of this elec-
trification resulted in values an order of magnitude 
higher than those of British investigators published 
in 1963. The Chinese investigators suggest their 
results may offer a clue to a better understanding 
of the electrification mechanism in thunderstorms. 
The work would have been more significant if the 
concept and the instrumentation were original 
rather than similar to those used in previous foreign 
experiments. 
A second article on laboratory experimentation 
published in 1966 was a report on chloride particle 
detection studies by Yeh Chia-tung ( 0673/1367/ 
2639) of the Department of Meteorology, Nanking 
University.16 Yeh discussed microscopic investiga-
tions of the reaction halo enlargement of chloride 
particles collected on gelatin films. These investiga-
tions resulted in an empirical relationship between 
the enlargement factor and the diameter of the 
chloride particle. Results of this experiment ap-
parently were intended to correct size distributions 
of chloride particles collected via the film processes. 
The chloride particles were probably selected for 
study because of the use of salt or salt water in 
several Chinese cloud-seeding experiments and be-
cause of their importance as naturally occurring 
condensation nuclei. 
INSTRUMENTATION DEVELOPMENT 
Chinese cloud physics instrumentation is con-
siderably inferior in quality and quantity to that of 
the United States, the USSR, and several other 
countries. The Chinese can make some relatively 
simple measurements, but their lack of sufficient 
quantities of sophisticated instruments is a major 
handicap in improving their knowledge of cloud 
physics processes and weather modification work. 
Minimal use has been made of radars, computers, 
airborne instrumentation or of other observation 
systems which could greatly improve their under-
standing.� 
None of the articles in the last issues of Acta 
Meteorologica Sinica (first two volumes of 1966) 
pertain to cloud physics or weather modification 
instrumentation development. During 1965, how-
ever, four articles were noted, three of which de-
scribed actual Chinese developments. In the other, 
Ku Chen-ch'ao discussed the problems associated 
with determining the location of "thunder-lightning" 
utilizing a single-station detector, but offered no 
solution to these problems.17 No implication of 
actual instrument design or development activities 
in this general area can be inferred, but a review by 
Ku indicates the kind of high-level interest which 
sometimes precedes Chinese development. 
One of the 1965 articles included a discussion 
on an improvement in the Chinese cloud-droplet 
sampler for utilization at ground level that extends 
the sampling period from 2 seconds to 2 minutes 
and has an adjustable exposure. In addition, the 
drums containing the sampling tapes are motor-
driven rather than hand-driven. A prototype of this 
still rather crude instrument was built for field 
data collection in 1964.18 This is typical of Chinese 
attempts to improve crude instruments. Admitted 
shortcomings of operational inconvenience, lack of 
a dehumidifying mechanism, and bulkiness probably 
have prevented its quantity production. The em-

cates only limited use of aircraft for sampling pro-
grams. 
Another paper was concerned with the develop-
ment of a special radiosonde for probing electric 
fields in thunderclouds." The advantages over air-
craft soundings, however, seem hardly worthwhile 
unless such measurements are to be made on a 
routine, high-density basis, and this again may illus-
trate aircraft restrictions for atmospheric research. 
In any event, only five soundings were reported, 
and this development as recently as 1965 appeared 
to be of a prototype nature. 
The third cloud physics instrumentation develop-
ment reported in 1965 is that of an atmospheric ice 
nuclei counter consisting of a cloud chamber. The 
chamber was reported to perform satisfactorily and 
to be under experimental production at the Shang-
hai Refrigerator Plant;2� however, none of the field 
investigations described in Chinese articles are re-
ported to have utilized this instrument. 
An earlier ( 1964) development of a laboratory 
instrument for determining the electric charge of 
cloud droplets relied on the deposition of charged 
cloud droplets on a sampling plate and a subse-
quent determination of their deflection in an electric 
field.21 The instrument was tested using a spray of 
water in a laboratory and is not suitable for field 
use. No subsequent mention of the instrument has 
been found. 
A summary of known Chinese sampling tech-
niques for determining size and/or concentration 
of precipitation elements and atmospheric nuclei 
appears in table 1. 
FIELD ACTIVITIES 
Weather modification 
Weather modification in China began in the late 
1950s with a number of crude attempts to modify 
clouds and precipitation. Through the early 1960s, 
modification attempts decreased and theoretical 
studies were given more attention. While some 
modification attempts have continued, they are 
usually isolated activities connected with agricul-
tural activities. There is no evidence of any large-
scale well-controlled field program. Although a large 
number of Chinese who are familiar with Western 
and Soviet modification techniques have been in-
volved in the work, they have a limited ability to 
operate effective field programs.�

The earliest attempts at producing rain from 
clouds were prompted by extreme periods of 
drought and took place mainly in Kirin and Kansu 
Provinces. Routine methods were employed in 
which various materials such as carbon dioxide, 
salt, quicklime water, salt solution, silver iodide, and 
sodium iodide were used as seeding materials. Mili-
tary aircraft and ground-based and balloon-borne 
generators were utilized to dispense the materials. 
Positive results were reported but no scientific con-
trol of the experiments was indicated.' 22 
Infrequent reports were noted during the 1960-
1964 period. These included reviews of foreign 
weather modification attempts with different tech-
niques and materials and contained several refer-
ences to Chinese experiments in cloud seeding to 
produce rain. One activity in the Shanghai area in 
1964 reportedly produced heavy rains.23-26 The seed-
ing of summer cumulus clouds in Hunan Province 
reportedly took place in 1963. A total of 62 attempts 
were made in which powdered salt was injected 
into thick cumulus clouds. Of these tests, 11 re-
sulted in precipitation in the thick cumulus state, 
25 in the incus ( anvil shaped), six in only virga 
( evaporating rain), and six in cloud dispersal. 
Three tests showed no effects and the results in 
the rest could not be observed. These results, com-
pared with earlier Chinese data, were claimed to 
be in agreement with US data.27 The Nationalist 
Chinese reported in 1964 that rainmaking experi-
ments had taken place over Hainan Island and sev-
eral other areas but no details were given.28 
The most recent reports of field weather modifica-
tion were noted in widely separated publications. 
One, a New China News Agency article of Sep-
tember 1967, indicated that "man-made rain" had 
recently fallen on farming districts around Shang-
hai. The seeding was reported to have been ac-
complished by People's Liberation Army (PLA) 
aircraft in response to a threat to crops due to a dry 
spe11.29 No mention of seeding material, techniques, 
or numerical results was made, and it is important 
to note that the crew "worked around the clock to 
equip the plane with artificial precipitation devices." 
This indicates that planes equipped with such de-
vices were not available on a standby, or opera-
tional, basis, but the implication of operational 
utilization of cloud seeding to produce precipita-
tion is inherent. 
On 28 December 1967 the Peking New China 
News Agency also reported on artificial seeding of 
rain clouds in Chekiang Province. Wen-chou, Li-
shin and other areas in the hilly region of southern 
Chekiang suffered a 150-day drought and artificial 
seeding operations were carried out in the areas 
by the PLA Air Force for more than 20 days. Al-
though no results of the experiment were reported, 
the report implied that a bumper harvest, achieved 
despite the worst drought in 100 years, was at least 
partially due to the cloud seeding activity.30 
The next mention of cloud modification attempts 
was included in recent press accounts of a new Chi-
nese hero, Men Ho. Men was publicized throughout 
China as a true supporter of Mao and a "brilliant 
example for all revolutionary cadres in the party, 
the country, and the Army to follow." Men was a 
deputy political instructor of an Army unit in 
Tsinghai Province. He reportedly lost his life while 
assisting in the preparation of explosives for rockets 
to be used for dispersing clouds to prevent the for-
mation of crop-destroying hail. No other details 
of this experiment were reported except that native 
rockets were being readied for launch.31-33 
Two earlier news releases from the Chengchow 
Domestic Service, 18 November 1966, reported on 
two rainmaking experiments in Honan.34 These so-
called experiments also appear to have an opera-
tional overtone since they were conducted to relieve 
drought in specific areas, in October and Novem-
ber of 1966, and since none of the detailed measure-
ments normally associated with scientific experiment 
were mentioned. These operations, plus those pre-
viously mentioned, indicate that the Chinese experi-
ments are mainly carried out in areas that are 
undergoing drought conditions. This attitude is in 
contrast to that of the US practice wherein broad 
experimentation is underway but with a slower, 
more scientific approach to operational utilization. 
It should be noted, however, that private concerns 
in the United States are operationally active in 
rainmaking activities on a much larger scale than 
the total of the reported Chinese activities. A list-
ing of selected Chinese cloud seeding experiments 
is included in table 2. 
A field operation similar to that in which Men 
Ho was involved was reported in a news release of 
1966, and while apparently occurring in the sum-
mer of 1965, it is probably representative of 83 hail-

dispersal operations conducted from 1960 to 1965 
in Mien-fling County, Szechwan Province. The use 
of locally-made rockets ( actually fireworks) was 
noted to have been ineffective prior to 1959. Im-
proved multistage "sky-high fireworks" capable of 
achieving heights of 2,000 meters ( 6,500 feet) be-
fore explosion have been in use since then. These 
improved rockets were reported to have dispersed 
hailclouds without hail formation in 78 of 83 at-
tempts. A firing network was organized to launch 
a thousand rockets whenever a hailstorm was re-
ported to be imminent.35 Based on similar Western 
and Soviet work, such experiments have little effect 
on a hail-producing cloud. A similar, possibly re-
lated report appeared in a Hong Kong publication 
in 1966. The author discussed rockets used to com-
bat hail in Wan-ning County, Szechwan Province. 
These were single and two-stage rockets weighing 
a little over an ounce and slightly over a pound 
respectively. The propellant chamber was made of 
strawboard and the launching pad of wood. The 
rocket reportedly produced a strong pulse wave 
upon exploding at altitudes of 1 to 2 km ( see fig-
ure 1).36 No mention of similar activities in other 
areas has been reported. Evaluation of the claims 
for this form of hail suppression is difficult to make, 
but the reported results are exceedingly doubtful

since the rockets could not reach the freezing levels. 
The Chinese claimed, however, that dispersal was 
caused by the sound waves resulting from the ex-
plosions. 
The firing of so-called "National Guns" for mod-
ifying hail clouds also has been reported and evi-
dently has been in use for some time. These guns 
consisted of iron tubes which were filled with black 
powder and packed with felt wadding. They were 
mounted on wooden supports, aimed in the di-
rection of a cloud, and fired. The Chinese attributed 
control of a cloud by this means to the sound waves 
produced by the explosion ( see figure 2).36 
Other countries, such as the USSR, Italy, and 
other European countries, have tried explosive sup-
pression, and some success has been claimed. The 
Soviet attempts, which utilize artillery firings of 
ice-producing nuclei into specified portions of 
a potential hailcloud, are reasonably well docu-
mented with data. In comparison, the Chinese 
techniques are crude, and their claims appear to 
be exaggerated. Furthermore, reported Chinese ef-
forts in hail prevention are minor in comparison 
with those of the USSR." 
Other Chinese attempts at hail prevention more 
scientific in nature include the aircraft dispersal 
of silver iodide, pilot-balloon-lofted cartridges con-
taining silver iodide, and jet aircraft burning silver 
and acetone. In the latter, the silver iodide and 
acetone are mixed in an airborne generator and 
the mixture fed into the aircraft's nozzle where 
it is sublimated ( see figures 3 and 4).36 It is not pos-
sible to evaluate the significance of this technique 
because of insufficient information. 
No other recent Chinese field experiments have 
been noted. The final volume of Acta Meteorologica 
Sinica was largely devoted to cloud physics articles, 
and no mention was made of either an experimental 
or operational weather modification study or proj-
ect. The last published deeding experiments which 
reported cloud measurements occurred during the 
winter of 1963-1964 near Shanghai. The objective 
of that experiment was to produce snow from strat-
iform clouds and it was reported to be successful 
on a small scale.37 
The almost compete lack of scientific articles 
subsequent to the summer of 1966 makes a current 
evaluation of Chinese field operations and experi-

ments difficult. It appears unlikely that the re-
cently reported attempts to operationally increase 
rainfall in local areas are the only experiments 
conducted during the past few years. Despite the 
continuance of this type of activity, it is doubtful 
that the Chinese have made much improvement 
in their relatively low standing in field activities 
as compared with other nations. However, due to 
their ability to test without regard to the political, 
legal, and sociological constraints imposed in other 
countries, such as the United States, the possibility 
of a chance breakthrough does exist. Until their 
experimentation measurements are improved, it ap-

pears that only a major change in cloud and/or 
precipitation patterns resulting from their experi-
ments would be detected by the Chinese. 
No recent reports have been noted which would 
reflect Chinese work on the dispersal of clouds 
and fog. Some tests were indicated, however, by 
reports presented at the 1962 annual meeting of 
the Chinese Meteorological Society. Although no 
progress in this area is known, the Chinese 
would have little difficulty applying well-known 
techniques to supercooled clouds and fogs with

results similar to those achieved by other coun-
tries.28 
Data Collection 
The Chinese have concentrated their efforts in 
cloud physics data collection in the field on cloud 
and precipitation droplet size measurements, nuclei 
measurements, thunderstorm electrical fields data, 
and, to a very limited degree, radar analyses of 
hailstorms. Some cloud temperature and turbulence 
data have also been collected in conjunction with 
the above measurements. 
Overall, the number of field data collection ac-
tivities reported in the Chinese literature is small, 
and these data collections generally lack the scope 
and complexity typical of the programs in other 
countries. The lack of, or failure to assign, aircraft, 
sophisticated measurement devices, and computers 
for use in these activities to any significant degree 
is obvious in their efforts. This deficiency prevents 
the Chinese from being able to adequately verify 
their more extensive theoretical models or to 
properly evaluate their weather modification efforts. 
While this might be taken to indicate a low priority 
for the activities, it is more probably due to the 
lack of necessary equipment. 
One reasonably complete field collection of cloud 
data utilizing aircraft occurred in the Kirin area 
of northeast China in the late spring and early 
summer of 1963. Fifteen flights were conducted 
to observe ice and snow crystals in precipitating 
cold stratus using an aluminum foil sampling de-
vice. The aircraft could not reach altitudes with 
temperatures lower than �150C.38 For the latitude 
of Kirin, 45�N, this temperature would result in 
an altitude limitation of approximately 15,000 feet 
during the late spring and early summer. Whether 
this limitation was due to aircraft ceiling, personnel 
limitation (lack of oxygen devices), or other causes 
is not known, but earlier seeding flights have men-
tioned the lack of oxygen supply for personnel. 
Two other examples of field data collection re-
ported in 1966 consisted of ground observations 
of electric field variations near thunderstorm clouds 
and analyses of radar echoes from hailstorms.3940 
The electric field observations were taken in 
the summer of 1963 in Kansu Province, and the 
radar echo analyses and associated surface ob-
servations were for ten hailstorms near Peking in 
1964. Studies of radar echoes from thunderstorms 
in the Tai-shan area in the summer of 1962 were 
published in 1965.41 Additional collections dur-
ing this time period involved ground observations 
of nuclei42 43 and cloud-fog droplets or crystals." 
Neither the instrumentation used nor the reported 
results would contribute significantly to a better 
understanding of cloud or precipitation processes. 
The majority of the Chinese data collection opera-
tions have been small in scope and duration, and 
very minor when compared to similar activities in 
the advanced nations.
