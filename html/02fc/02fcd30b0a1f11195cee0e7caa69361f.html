 FAR EAST
 The pattern of Communist military and political
 activity in Vietnam suggests that Hanoi remains con-
 vinced the time is not ripe for a move toward negotia-
 tions and is determined to strengthen the Communist
 position in the South for a protracted conflict.   The
 recent upsurge in attacks on allied base camps and air-
 fields in northern South Vietnam may be the forerunnc.
 of a summer offensive in this area which, according to
 a North Vietnamese defector, is scheduled to begin in
 mid-April.   The disruption of Saigon's Revolutionary
 Development program remains a top-priority Communist
 objective.   In an effort to deal with that program a:.
 well as with Viet Cong demoralization caused by allied
 military pressures, the Communists are seeking to
 strengthen their organizational apparatus and revital-
 ize their local leadership cadres in the South.
 The main result of the two-week campaign against
 Liu Shao-chi,  Teng Hsiao-ping,  and other important
 Chinese Communist leaders has been moves to restore
 the authority and prominence of militant Red Guard
 organizations which were suppressed by the army in
 February.   Pro-Maoist attacks on leading military
 figures appear designed to impose restrictions on the
 army's role in the contest between militant forces
 and those within the military and government leader-
 ship who are committed to restoring order and produc-
 tion.   Although recent charges against Mao's opponents
 recall the extremism of last winter,  it is not clear
 that this campaign will lead to a return of the ex-
 cesses which marked earlier phases of the Cultural
 Revolution.
 Cambodia's Chief of State Sihanouk is taking
 strong measures in response to an increase in polit-
 ical unrest and antigovernment agitation over the
 past two months.   Although he has charged that pro-
 Communist elements are behind these disturbances, he
 appears to be concerned with the erosion of his
 political position and prestige and may be seeking
 a pretext to assert direct personal control of the
 government.

 VIETNAM
 The unusually well-coordi-
 nated series of heavy attacks on
 5 and 6 April against US and
 South Vietnamese positions be-
 tween Quang Tri city and Hue may
 have actually marked the initia-
 tion of a summer campaign,  di-
 rected against the Revolution-
 ary Development program in South
 5X1 Vietnam's northern provinces.
 2
 scheduled to commence in mid-
 April and extend through Sep-
 tember.
 These attacks, which re-
 sulted in nearly 300 South Viet-
 namese casualties, demonstrated
 the insecurity surrounding two
 of the country's most important
 provincial capitals.   Apart
 from their psychological shock
 value on the local citizenry--
 still evident several days
 afterward--the attacks may
 have been designed to lure siz-
 able allied reaction forces
 into ambush positions prepared
 in advance.
 Saigon Politics
 The Constituent Assembly
 has turned its attention to
 this fall's presidential and
 legislative elections.   During
 the rest of April,  the assembly
 is scheduled to elect new of-
 ficers,  to revise some of  its
 present procedural rules, and
 to draw up the laws governing
 the electoral process.
 The assemblymen's dElibera-
 tions in the next few weeks may
 involve lively internal jockey-
 ing both to form new allia:ices
 with an eye toward their on
 participation in the fall  election
 and to organize blocs of sapport
 for individual presidential candi-
 dates.   Since the present                                                                             assem-
 bly chairman,  Phan Khac Eua,  is
 already running for president,
 a new assembly chairman ~&itl
 probably be chosen and there may
 be further realignments cr mergers
 among the present blocs in a
 scramble to fill and control as-
 sembly offices.
 Outside the assembly,
 another civilian,  Tran Van Huong,
 has entered the presidential con-
 test.                                                                              Huong and Suu, both south-
 erners,  are probably about evenly
 matched in terms of popular sup-
 port and should prove to be the
 most serious civilian contenders.
 However,  certain similarities
 of their political experie:-ice
 and the fact that both will be
 appealing basically to the same
 segment of the electorate  could
 cause them to cancel one another
 out in any three-way race with
 a military candidate, wheteer
 he be Premier Ky or Chief   of
 State Thieu.   The prospective

 military candidate is already
 given the edge in terms of a
 readily available campaign
 mechanism.
 DRV Premier Reported in Moscow
 North Vietnamese Premier
 Pham Van Dong and the Soviet
 ambassador to Hanoi are report-
 edly in Moscow
 n his I.ast visit to  os-
 cow in August 1966 Pham Van
 Dong was accompanied by De-
 fense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap
 and concluded an agreement
 for new Soviet military aid to
 North Vietnam.
 DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 The official campaign against
 Chinese Communist Chief of State
 Liu Shao-chi--now in its second
 week--shows no sign of abating.
 Mammoth anti-Liu rallies are
 still being held almost daily
 in Peking,  and authoritative
 central committee journals con-
 tinue to publish a steady flow
 of articles and editorials blam-
 ing Liu for every mistake made
 by the Chinese leadership under
 Mao Tse-tung during the past
 30 years.
 Peking appears to be setting
 the stage for the public ouster
 of Liu and the many senior offi-
 cials who have been implicated
 with him in recent months.   In
 fact,  formal action of some kind
 may already have been taken at
 a high-level meeting convened in
 late March.   Wall posters claim
 that Liu and four other already
 disgraced members of the elite
 politburo standing committee were
 "condemned and crushed" at this
 meeting.   The posters identify
 those who sided with Chairman
 Mao as Vice Chairman Lin Piao,
 Premier Chou En-lai, Cultural
 Revolution officials Chen Po-ta
 and Kang Sheng,  and economic
 planner Li Fu-chun.
 Militant elements in the
 leadership may also be trying
 to use the anti-Liu campaign to
 renew and extend the drive against
 Mao's opponents.   Steps are being
 taken to revive militant Red
 Guard groups and reverse some of
 the moderate policies adopted in
 February and early March when
 the regime was trying to restore
 order.   At that time Red Guards
 came in for considerable press
 criticism and in some localities
 were subdued and arrested by
 military commanders, presumably
 acting on orders from Peking.

 In the past two weeks, however,
 Peking has published fulsome
 praise for the Red Guards and
 has criticized the army for
 suppressing pro-Mao leftists.
 Directives by the central
 committee and its Military Af-
 fairs Committee, posted in Pe-
 king on 1 and 6 April,  ordered
 the army to protect leftists--
 even those with shortcomings--
 and not to arrest any without
 permission of the central com-
 mittee.   In posters seen on 6
 April, Chou En-lai, Madame Mao,
 and Public Security Minister
 Hsieh Fu-chih were quoted as
 saying that leftist student
 groups disbanded in February
 would be revived,  and that mili-
 tary representatives who had
 been sent to schools to restore
 order would be withdrawn.
 Three vice chairmen of the
 party's powerful Military Af-
 fairs Committee and Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi have come under
 severe Red Guard criticism for
 trying to block the Cultural
 Revolution and to protect "con-
 servatives" opposed to Mao.   A
 few posters defending these
 men have also been seen, however,
 suggesting that the attacks were
 aimed at policies of retreat as-
 sociated with them rather than
 at the men themselves.
 An additional problem facing
 the regime is the epidemic of
 meningitis which has str_irk at     25X1
 least 17 provinces since __ate      25X1
 1966 and does not appear to be
 abating.

 ably spread between mid-1`+66 and
 February 1967 when milli ins of
 Red Guards, workers,  and peasants
 traveled far from their tomes to
 engage in the Cultural R~"olu-
 tion.   Public health serv::ces
 probably broke down in many areas
 during this period.   The central
 committee order of 19 March pro-
 hibiting further travels may
 have been partially prompted b
 reaction to the epidemic.

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S TRADE IN 1966
 The Cultural Revolution and
 deteriorating external relations
 appear to have had little effect
 on Communist China's foreign trade
 in 1966.   This trade grew during
 the year by 10 percent to reach
 an estimated $4.2 billion,  just
 a shade below the previous peak
 of $4.3 billion in 1959.   The
 growth lagged behind the 18-per-
 cent figure of the previous year,
 however,  and some effect of the
 domestic disorders could become
 apparent in 1967.
 China continues to put in-
 creasing emphasis on trade with
 the West.   Free world countries
 accounted for over 70 percent of
 1966 trade and most of its growth.
 Trade with Japan, China's largest
 trade partner, grew about 32 per-
 cent to constitute about 15 per-
 cent of the total.   Western Eu-
 rcpean trade grew over 30 percent
 with West Germany replacing the
 UK as China's largest supplier in

 Western Europe.   The rate of
 growth for trade with less devel-
 oped countries in the free world,
 which dipped sharply in 1965,  re-
 mained at a low percent.                                                                       Figures
 on trade with Communist countries
 must be estimated  (see chart) but
 probably grew slightly,  largely
 because of increased imports from
 Eastern Europe and increased ex-
 ports to North Vietnam.   Sino-
 Soviet trade was probably a lit-
 tle less than the low level of
 1965.
 Grain remains China's largest
 import commodity, with 1966 ship-
 ments of about $375 million, pri-
 marily from Canada and Australia.
 Much of the increase in imports
 from Western Europe represents de-
 liveries of equipment under con-
 tracts signed in 1964 and 1965
 for complete industrial plants.
 Such contracts signed in 1966
 totaled an estimated $21.5 million,
 down substantially from the value
 of orders placed in the previous
 two years, probably because of the
 failure to conclude the contract
 for the $150-million steel rolling
 mill from a Western European con-
 sortium.   Negotiations on this
 contract have resumed this month.
 Imports from Japan included finished
 and semifinished industrial goods
 as well as equipment under whole-
 plant contracts.
 Almost half of China's exports
 were in agricultural products, with
 foodstuffs accounting for almost a
 third of the total.   Textile and
 light manufactured items contimit-
 to be major ex ort items.

 INCIDENTS RISING IN KOREAN DEMILITARIZED ZONE
 Shooting incidents in the Korean
 Demilitarized Zone  (DMZ)  have in-
 creased in recent weeks as they do
 every spring when the North Koreans
 take advantage of improved weather
 and ground conditions to step up
 agent penetrations of the south.
 This year, however, the number of
 incidents is about three times
 greater than during the same period
 of 1966.
 Two principal factors probably
 account for this.  UN Command forces
 have stepped up their patrolling as
 the result of an upsurge in North
 Korean provocations last fall.
 Also Pyongyang is reported to have
 doubled its agent training and op-
 erational capability.
 Three incidents this year
 appear to have resulted from inten-
 tional North Korean provocations.
 On the night of 2-3 February a South
 Korean guard post was unsuccessfully
 attacked by 10 or 11 North Korean
 troops.   On `i April a US work
 party was pinned down by enemy
 fire for an hour about a mile east
 of the Panmunjom Joint Security
 Area.   The proximity to Panmunjom
 suggests that the incident may
 have been a retaliation for the
 defection of the vice chief of the
 North Korean Central News Agency
 during a Military Armistice Com-
 mission meeting there on 22 March.
 On 12 April a South Korear ambush
 unit came under heavy fire after
 it fired on three intruders.  The
 North Koreans may have been seek-
 ing revenge for earlier losses.
 This year's incidents  in the
 vicinity of the DMZ have cost the
 North Koreans about 17 kilLed.
 The US and South Korea have lost
 one man each.   In addition, 49
 South Korean naval personnei were
 lost on 19 January when a North
 Korean shore battery sank -,heir
 patrol boat off the east coast,

 ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVITY IN CAMBODIA
 Chief of State Sihanouk ap-
 pears to be taking strong meas-
 ures to bolster his authority
 in the wake of increased anti-
 government activity in Cambodia.
 In a speech on 3 April de-
 nouncing armed attacks by "pro-
 Communist" rebels in Battambang
 Province near the Thai border,
 Sihanouk stated that he would
 ca:Ll,  if necessary,  for a "sus-
 pension" of the functions of the

 he is genuinely concerned over
 the security situation and over
 the erosion of his own prestige

 both the leftist and moderate

 A number of agitator:;,

 The extent to which hard-

 unclear.   It appears, however,
 that leftist elements in Phnom
 Penh,  supported by Communists
 there, have at least provided
 the main imp tus for the rebel

 The NATO allies have reacted favorably to
 textual revisions of the draft nonproliferation
 treaty offered by the US, but serious problems re-
 main.   The article on international safeguards
 continues to be the chief stumbling bloc, and the
 Soviet attitude toward the compromises being sought
 is problematical.   The new text is scheduled to be

 assistance--similar to last week's Polish-Bulgarian
 pact--is expected in the near future,  ].inking Sofia
 to the anti-Bonn treaties recently signed by the

 clear, however, that it does not share the strident
 anti - West Germanism of its northern allies, who
 may fail to gain a strong endorsement of their view;:
 at the European Communist party conference later
 this month.   Meanwhile, high-ranking members of the

 SECRE`1
 NEW SOVIET DEFENSE MINISTER NAMED
 The appointment of Marshal
 A.  A. Grechko as the USSR's minis-
 ter of defense has cleared the
 way for the long overdue renova-
 tion of the Soviet high command.
 Grechko is known to a strong
 prcponent of professionalism in
 military affairs,  as symbolized
 by one-man command--usually a
 sore issue with the political
 leadership.   However,  the cur-
 rent political leaders have
 placed a high premium on clear-
 cut and regular channels of com-
 mand and responsibility and have
 taken steps to reduce the party's
 interference in operational mat-
 ters in many spheres of national
 life.   Under these conditions,
 Grechko's emphasis on profession-
 alism and command responsibility
 need not lead to conflict, and
 may even improve his relations
 with the political leadership.
 Grechko became the number
 two man in the Defense Ministry
 in the spring of 1960.   He re-
 placed Marshal I.  S.                   Konev who
 opposed Khrushchev's streamlining
 of the USSR's defenses,  as War-
 saw pact commander and senior
 first deputy minister of defense.
 Grechko consistently flattered
 Khrushchev and supported his pro-
 grams.   He backed even those Khru-
 shchev moves which others in the
 high command opposed.
 Despite his association with
 Khrushchev,  Grechko is believed
 to have good connections with
 several present: members of the
 politburo and other important
 political leaders.   Grechko's
 record suggests that he will
 maintain a judicious balance
 between political and profes-
 sional demands,.   He has a force-
 ful personality, however, and in
 the past has advocated strong
 reliance on strategic attack
 forces,  especially mobile ICBMs
 and missile-armed nuclear subma-
 rines,  assigning somewhat less
 importance to the other forces.
 Even if he finds it politic to
 submerge these views,  they may,
 over the long term,  influence
 Soviet politico-military policy.
 The first step in the re-
 alignment of the high command
 has been the promotion of three
 relatively young officers,  all
 in their mid-50s.   Army General
 I.  I. Yakubovsky has been made
 a marshal and a first deputy
 minister and will probably
 take command of the Warsaw Pact
 forces.   Colonel Generals S.  L.
 Sokolov and I.  G. Pavl.ovsky have
 been promoted to general of the
 army.   Sokolov has also been
 made a first deputy minister
 and Pavlovsky,   a deputy minister.
 Rejuvenation of the military
 hierarchy probably would have
 begun in any case around the
 time of the 50th anniversary of
 the Bolshevik Revolution this
 fall, but its schedule has ap-
 parently been moved forward as
 a result     Marshal Malinovsky's
 death.

 EASTERN EUROPEAN MILITARY BUDGETS INCREASE
 The military budgets of
 most of the Eastern European
 countries have been increased
 for the second year in a row.
 Only Bulgaria's budget is be-
 low last year's; Albania's is
 unchanged.   No figures are
 available for Czechoslovakia.
 Except for East Germany, how-
 ever,  the Eastern European
 countries have earmarked a
 smaller percentage of their
 total 1967 budgets for mili-
 tary expenditures than they
 did in 1966.

 Increased defense expendi-
 tures probably are largely at-
 tributable to the gradual modern-I  a few additional transporters
 ization of equipment taking place
 in Eastern Europe.   This is es-
 pecially true in Poland, Czecho-
 slovakia,  and East Germany, where
 the armed forces are getting more
 sophisticated weapons costing
 more than the equipment they re-
 place. Small increases in admin-
 istrative expenditures may also
 account for the higher military
 budgets.   Annual changes in mil-
 itary expenditures probably re-
 flect,  in part, payments for im-
 ports made during the preceding
 year rather than planned pur-
 chases in the budgeted year.
 Poland and Czechoslovakia
 produce most of their own land
 armaments,  although they bought
 and missiles from the USSR in
 1966.   A Hungarian defense of-
 ficial has stated that Htngary
 intends to develop,  strergthen,
 and modernize its army it  1967
 in order to fulfill its Parsaw
 Pact obligations.
 The figures are believed to
 understate the actual level of
 spending because some military
 expenditures are includec  else-
 where in the budget and because
 subsidies on some items purchased
 by the military are not included
 in the military figures.   However,
 they probably indicate the gen-
 eral trends in the national lev-
 els of military expenditures.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The Syrians were stung badly by the Israelis
 last week, losing a quarter of their MIG-21 in-
 ventory.   The Israelis appear to believe they have
 proved that they can be dangerous if pressed too
 far but, to stress the point, they are reinforcing
 their border.  Although Syrian leaders undoubtedly
 do not wish to risk further serious losses soon,
 they cannot appear intimidated and occasional
 sniping across the border continues.   In general,
 the affair has revealed the present emptiness of
 the Syrian-Egyptian defense pact.
 Cyprus is uneasy in the wake of several seri-
 ous exchanges of fire between Greek and Turkish
 Cypriots last weekend.   UN Peace Force troops suc-
 ceeded in silencing the guns but the atmosphere of
 confrontation continues around the Turkish Cypriot
 enclaves.
 Athens is still preoccupied with its own crisis.
 Demonstrations have now been stirred by leftist ele-
 ments seeking the fall of the Kanellopoulos govern-
 ment and the installation of a service government to
 hold elections.   Despite this agitation, Kanellopou--
 los may proceed to exercise his mandate from the
 King to dissolve Parliament and call elections with--
 out the parliamentary approval he had been seeking.
 In any event,  Greek conservatives are hoping somehoi,J
 to circumvent a return to power of the radical oppo-
 sition sparked by the Papandreous.

 UN MISSION TO SOUTH ARABIA FAILS
 The UN mission to Aden ap-
 pears to have ended in failure,
 although the British are continu-
 ing efforts to revive it.   The
 main achievement of the visit ap-
 pears,  somewhat ironically,    to
 have been the further exacerba-
 tion of internal rivalries among
 Adeni nationalists.
 The mission left on 7 April
 after only five days, charging a
 lack of British cooperation.   It
 refused to speak to leaders of the
 British-backed South Arabian
 Federation,  either as government
 officials or as traditional tribal
 leaders.   In fact,  it spoke only
 to one group,  imprisoned terror-
 ists, most of whom refused to
 answer,  since they belonged to
 the nationalist groups boycotting
 the mission.   The mission is now
 in Geneva deciding its next move,
 which could be the visit to London
 the British are pressing for.
 The violence which grew out
 of the general strike called on
 the occasion of the visit was an-
 ticipated and was accordingly kept
 to a minimum by the military pre-
 cautions taken by the British. On
 the other hand it served to delin-
 eate   the seriousness of the
 schism between the contending
 nationalist groups in Aden.   In
 addition to their sporadic clashes
 with British troops,  the national-
 ists engaged in vicious inter-
 necine skirmishes which killed
 five and wounded two of their own
 number--and which are continuing
 despite the end of the strike and
 the departure of the mission.

 Both Israel and Syria appear
 to be braced for further action

 further serious incidents develop.
 An air battle between Is-

 developed over the border after
 an exchange of mortar and tank
 fire in the southern demili-

 Lake Tiberias.   The Syrians had
 provoked the initial skirmishes
 by firing at Israeli tractors
 plowing fields in the disputed
 area, but the Israelis were pre-
 pared for action and were the
 first to take to the air.   Dur-
 ing the engagement the Syrians
 apparently lost six MIG-21s--

 CRISIS CONTINUES IN NIGERIA
 There is still little hope
 of an early reconciliation be-
 tween Nigeria's feuding leaders.
 In response to Eastern gov-
 ernor Ojukwu's edict requiring
 that all revenues collected in
 the East be paid to the regional
 treasury,  federal government
 head Gowon has decided that ships
 using Eastern harbor facilities
 must pay their port costs in
 Lagos.   Stiff fines would be
 levied on any who pay in the
 East.   Implementation, however,
 has been held in abeyance.I
 There are some recent indi-
 cations that Gowon may now be
 supported by the Western and
 Mid-Western governors, who pre-
 viously have been reluctant to
 take strong action against Ojukwu.
 The two governors are reported
 to be increasingly impatient with
 Ojuk.wu.
 In the Eastern Region, tempers
 are also rising over the continu-
 ing differences with the federal
 regime, and Ojukwu's leading
 civilian and military advisers
 are leaning toward outright seces-
 sion as the only possible solu-
 tion.
 Ojukwu
 still seems interested in nego-
 tiating, but is becoming increas-
 ingly pessimistic about achieving
 terms acceptable to the East.             He
 almost certainly would secede
 rather than jeopardize his present
 personal position of leadership.
 Although Gowon seems willing
 to participate in a possible
 second meeting in Ghana of Ni-
 geria's Supreme Military Council
 (SMC),  prospects for such a meet-
 ing do not appear bright.   The
 federal government has so far
 refused to register the executive
 jet aircraft Ojukwu recently pur-
 chased,  and Ojukwu has already
 told the US consul he will never
 again attend an SMC meeting  unle s
 this is done.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 25X1
 Caretaker governments tended shop throughout
 the hemisphere this week as the presidents gathered
 in Punta del Este for the summit meeting.
 Security forces in several countries were
 alerted in response to reports of plans for student
 demonstrations repudiating the summit conference
 and a call by the Havana-based Continental Students
 Organization for a general student strike.  Bombs
 which exploded in several countries probably were
 the work of extremist groups protesting the summit
 meeting.
 The Ecuadorean Government is being harassed by
 labor tensions and small-scale civic demonstrations
 protesting alleged government inaction and inatten-
 tiveness to local problems.   The Communist-dominated
 Confederation of Ecuadorean Workers is seeking a
 40-percent wage increase for its members.
 Jamaican Prime Minister Sangster, who died on
 11 April, has been succeeded by Hugh Shearer, the
 former minister of external affairs and a powerful
 labor leader.   Shearer--who lacks Sangster's na-
 tional prestige--will have his work cut out for him
 in uniting the ruling Jamaica Labor Party behind
 him.
 In Nicaragua,  the death of former president Luis
 Somoza on 13 April removes a much-needed moderating
 influence on the president-elect,  his younger brother
 Anastasio,  and will reinforce the opposition's ap-
 prehensions about the younger Somoza.

 NEW PRIME MINISTER IN JAMAICA
 The Jamaica Labor Party's
 selection of External Affairs
 Minister Hugh Shearer to succeed
 Prime Minister Sangster, who
 died on 11 April,  could produce
 a sharp division in the party.
 In choosing Shearer,  the
 party has bypassed Housing Min-
 ister Tavares, who was Sangster's
 choice for acting prime minister.
 Tavares'  resentment will probably
 25X6        be shared by his powerful
 colleague, Minister of
 Welfare and Development Edward
 Seaga, who together with Tavares
 heads the Liberal wing of the
 JLP.
 Shearer, 43, became external
 affairs minister in February when
 Sangster succeeded Sir Alexander
 Bustamante.   As a powerful trade
 union leader and Bustamante
 favorite,  Shearer has been con-
 sidered a likely successor to
 Sangster;  the two had worked
 closely together in the past. The
 new prime minister may, however,
 have some difficulty in uniting
 the party behind him.   He lacks
 Sangster's national prestige and
 is not known to be an astute
 politician.
 As prime minister, Shearer
 is expected to pursue an increas-
 ingly independent line in inter-
 national affairs.   He gained some
 international recognition when
 he headed Jamaica's mission to
 the United Nations.   Shearer has
 exhibited great friendliness
 toward the United States,  al-
 though he has become somewhat
 cooler since 1963, primarily be-
 cause of differences over US
 assistance and a failure to ob-
 tain waivers for the entrance
 of Jamaican migrant workers to
 the US.   In 1.965 Shearer said he
 was personally opposed to any
 move to join the organization of
 American States.   He may have
 moderated this view, however,
 since OAS membership is appearing
 increasingly attractive to other
 former British colonies in the
 Caribbean.
 As chief leader of govern-
 ment business in the Senate,
 and the government's principal
 Senate spokesman on foreign pol-
 icy and defense, Shearer has
 demonstrated considerable ability
 and seems adequately prepared
 to assume the reins of government.
 His only political or economic
 philosoph  , however,  is party
 to salt  .

 DOMINICAN PRESIDENT'S PROBLEMS
 Delicate political and mil-
 itary problems that are in part
 an outgrowth of the 21 March at-
 tempt to assassinate Antonio Im-
 bert will confront Dominican
 President Balaguer when he re-
 turns from Punta del Este.
 Prior to his departure Bala-
 guer averted the threatened res-
 ignation  of  Minister of Interior
 and Police Amiama--whom the Pres-
 ident appointed only two weeks
 ago to head off antigovernment
 repercussions from the attack
 on Imbert--by sending one of
 Amiama's adversaries,  ex - police
 chief Tejeda,  to a minor post in
 the interior.
 This move, however,  is un-
 likely to do more than merely
 postpone further dissension be-
 tween Amiama and Balaguer.   The
 President has reportedly said
 that Tejeda's new assignment is
 only temporary and commented that
 Amiama's pressures are reaching
 the limit he will tolerate.
 Amiama seems sure to press for
 a further reduction of "Trujil-
 lista"  influence in the govern-
 ment as well as to build up his
 own power base.
 Should Amiama resign, his
 action would probably be coupled
 with strong criticism of Balaguer
 for hindering solution of the
 Imbert shooting and could lead
 to cooperation between the anti-
 Balaguer right and left.   Indeed,
 there already has been some
 collusion between Amiama and
 Dominican Revolutionary Party
 secretary general Pena.
 Political tensions have      25X1
 created cracks in the h_~retofore
 solid facade of military support
 for Balaguer.
 Military discontent is in
 part focusing on Minister of
 Defense Perez.   Many of ::-cers
 believe he is allowing .\rniama
 too much leeway in inve:t.igat-
 ing possible military i-ivolve-
 ment in the attack on hnLert.
 They also represent Perez'  ef-
 forts to curb the autonomy of
 the military services wch ap-
 parently were made at the be-
 hest of Balaguer.   In addition,
 endorsements of Perez' ,conduct
 by the Dominican left hive prob-
 ably discredited him among some
 officers.
 So far,  antigovernment
 civilian and military eements
 are not united.   Nevertheless,
 the potential clearly e::fists for
 alliances that could pose a
 serious threat to government
 stability.

 BOLIVIAN GUERRILLAS ACTIVE AGAIN
 Guerrillas operating in
 southeast Bolivia have struck
 again at army patrols and in-
 flicted heavy casualties.   The
 latest incident occurred on
 10 April not far from the site
 of the 23 March attack.
 The government declared
 the guerrilla area a military
 zone on 12 April and outlawed
 both the pro-Soviet and pro-
 Chinese Communist parties and
 the Trotskyite Revolutionary
 Workers'  Party.   The latter ac-
 tions may presage similar moves
 against other opposition politi-
 cal groups.
 Although the political or-
 ientation of the guerrillas has
 not been definitely established,
 they are still believed to be a
 mixed bag of extreme leftists
 numbering up to one hundred and
 under the leadership of Moises
 The latest incidents are
 likely to increase disagreements
 within the military over the
 reasons for its poor showing
 against the guerrillas.  I
 Repeated guerrilla successes
 against the ineffective military
 units could spark activity in
 northern and central Bolivia
 where bands belonging to the
 pro-Soviet Communist Party are
 reported.
