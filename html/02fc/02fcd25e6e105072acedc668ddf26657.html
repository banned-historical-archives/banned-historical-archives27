 SECTION I. SUMW,AHY OF FAR EAST TIU 4DS AND DEVELOPMESSTS
 The Chinese Nationalists are continuing to seek some means of
 withdrawing PAT Chum-hai's forces intact into Indochina but French
 authorities, appreciating the explosive potential of such a move,
 have stated that only unarmed units will be permitted to enter (p. 2).
 Korean President Hhee's requests for US assistance in building up
 an air force at least equal to that of the northern Korean puppet
 regime have received the endorsement of US representatives there (p. 4).
 The growing Chinese Communist threat to the refugee Nationalist
 administration on Taiwan has not yet resulted in any significant attempts
 at improvement of conditions on that strategic island (p. 5).  Meanwhile,
 on the mainland, Communist currency has once more begun to depreciate
 after a comparatively stable period of level commodity prices (p. 5).
 The marginal notations used in succeeding sections of this ifeekly
 ( "A", "Be, or "C") indicate the importance of the item in D/FE opinion
 with "A" representing the most important.

 achin fi  border probe   begaming critical--The Importance of
 Indochina as a barrier agaizat Communist expansion or as a potential
 asylum for remnants of Chinese Nationalist forces has been emphasized
 to the US by French and Chinese Nationalist sources as MAO Tse-tung's
 forces advance through South China.  Although the authorities of
 both the French and National governments are hopeful of involving
 the US in their own difficulties, their interests in the matter of
 residual Nationalist forces diverge sharply.  Apparently tailing In
 their efforts to secure French authorization for the retreat of
 Nationalist General PAT Chung-hails farces into Indochina, the Nation-
 al Government has recently proposed that the Vietnamese living in
 China be armed and despatched to Indochina on the condition that they
 join forces with Han Dai against Ho Chi Minh. The strength of such a
 force obviously would be negligible, and its true purpose probably
 would be to serve as a careen for the entry of Chinese Nationalist
 troops into Vietnam.
 There is as yet no evidence that a Chinese Comaunia t invasion of
 Indochina is contemplated, although Chinese Commaniat sympathy for
 the Vietnamese, as well as the withdrawal of French forces along most
 of the Sino-Vietnamese frontier, may be expected to encourage and
 facilitate smuggling of arms and other indirect assistance to the VistP-
 namesee

 Rhee-CHIAr Military Agreement?                                          during  "A"
 the Rhea CHIANG conversations at Chin has  Korean Coast Guard Base) on
 6-? August, military cooperation between Korea and Chinese Nationalists
 was discussed on lower levels by authorized representatives.  The discussions
 are alleged to have resulted in tentative agreement for the exchange of
 Nationalist ships, airticraft, arms, and ammunition for Nationalist use of
 Koan ports and airfields including Chinhae, Inchon, Pusan and Cheju--r.o.
 ;.Ater reports that the new Korean Ambassador, Shin auk doo, was carrying
 :rr, "important message" to Canton for CHIANG, suggest that Rhee may have
 confirmed the agreement.
 Korean military leaders and President Rhee are known to feel that
 their need for additional aircraft and patrol vessels is urgent and they
 have explored various possible means of supplementing the equipment supplied
 by the US Government.,  In view of their impatience for aircraft and shipa
 and other circumstances of the Rhee-CHIANG meeting, it appears possible
 that Rhee has attempted to obtain military equipment from CHIAANG.
 CHIA,`rG's interest in a military agreement with Korea is consistent
 with his continuing attempts to associate the Nationalist cause with a
 US-supported Pacific military union.  Furthermore, Nationalist use of
 Korean bases might materially assist the blackade of Chinese Communist
 ports.
 It appears doubtful, however, that Rhee would permit Nationalist
 forces to operate  ,ainst Communist China  from Korean bases.  Such action
 would risk adverse repercussions from the US and unpopular reaction from
 the Korean people who have an inherent distrust and dislike of the Chinese
 Furthermore, the presence of Nationalist forces in southern Korea probably
 would incite military action by Communist forces from the north to eliminate
 once and for all the remnant's  of anti-Communist resistance from southern
 Korea.
 It may be that Rhea plans to use the possibility of extending the
 Nationalists Communist conflict to the US-nurtured Korean Republic only as
 a bargaining point in requests for more US ships and planes.

 Arnie Smugg ing in Southeast Asia-The existence of a large international     "B"
 arms smuggling syndicate based in Manila and operating throughout South-
 east Asia and perhaps extending to China is currently being revealed by
 the Manila press.  Although there is no evidence to suggest other than
 profit motives behind the transactions, public disclosure of large-scale
 smuggling may have unfavorable repercussions upon the Philippine government's
 relations in Southeast Asia,  The US may also be embarrassed since most of
 the firearms are of US origin and were obtained from US war surplus stocks
 in deals which in many cases involved US citizens.
 25X1C8b
 Complete details of the arms syndicate are still lacking but the
 Manila press alleges that high Philippine and other Southeast Asian govern-
 ment officials are involved.  It is claimed that black-market rice, presum-
 ably from Thailand, and gold bullion and diamonds from Indonesia have been
 used for payment.  It is believed that opium has also been a medium of
 exchange.  The complete story concerning smuggling activities has yet to
 be disclosed.  Certain Philippine officials, Including one of the brothers
 of President Quirino, are said to be involved in arms deals and will prob-
 ably bring strong pressure to bear upon Quirino to hush the whole affair.

 North Korean Premier vague on unification--Premier Kim Ilsung, in a major
 policy speech to the opening session of the Supreme People's Assembly in
 Ppxgyang on 8 September, gave no indication that the "Democratic Unifica-
 tion Front" intends to carry out "elections" in all. Korea this month.
 There was also no indication that military action is contemplated this
 fall to overthrow the Republic of Korea.  The speech, which dwelled at
 great length on past achievements and future tasks within northern Korea,
 failed to present any concrete program for the attainment of unification.
 Although Kim stated at one point that the People's Army stands ready to
 "mop up" its enemies, the general tenor of his speech seems to call for an
 indefinite continuation of familiar tactics of "peaceful" subversion of
 the Republic by guerrilla warfare, propaganda, and infiltration.
 Korean food deficit to continue--The Korean food situation is still believed
 to be serious despite recent reports that the 1949 crop will reach 95% of
 the 1948 crop.  Reasons given are the necessity to export grain and the
 fact that foods were imported in 1948.  ECA estimates a grain deficit of
 some 3 million "auk".  (6.67 "suk" to a metric ton.)
 As ECA has committed its funds to essential rehabiliation of the
 economy, it has said that no funds will be diverted to food imports.  Fear
 is expressed that the Korean Government's plan to export a million suk of
 rice in return for a larger amount of coarse grains may involve FGA in
 just such an expenditure.  This could come about if, after the coarse
 grains had been imported, the Korean Government failed to collect enough
 rice for export to cover the coat  of the imported grain.
 A further source of concern is felt over the matter of Korea's foreign
 exchange.  The recent trade treaty between Japan and Korea was largely
 predicated on Koreas's having a net foreign exchange Cain of $16 million
 from its rice exports.  Present indications are that, even if the Koreans
 are able to export a million auk of rice, only $4 million net gain will be
 realized.  A method must be found for financing Japanese imports or the
 progress of economic rehabilitation will be seriously jeopardized.

 tilita.Z lullcontinues---The Chinese Con unists scored no major advances     "Air
 on the military fronto during the past -neck and their efforts to lure the
 non-Communist Suiyuanese into the fold have proven unsuccessful so far.
 However, the Nationalists appear to have made no significant progress in
 their search for a coherent program of opposition and military stagnation
 continues.  Meanwhile, the Communist forces reportedly have landed success-
 fully on Pingtan island, off the coast of Fukien, and, according to later
 Communist claims, have overwhelmed the island's defenders.  CHIN Yi's
 forces moving toward Amoy are said to be on the outskirts of Changchow,
 just 25 miles northwest of their objective.  CCU' capture of Amoy will give
 the Communists continuous control of the Fukien coast and a base for their
 promised attack on Taibvan.  Communist regulars on the northern borders of
 Xwangtung made no appreciable progress cur i.ng the past week, but an early
 break through of these forces to Canton is expected.  limns in Shensi are
 reportedly delaying the southward movement of Communist legions in the
 Chinling Mountains.  Tice Chinlings rise between the Communist positions
 in the Paochl area and the defensive bases of RU Tsung ran in Nazichertg.
 Reports from Peiping at-ate that FU Tso-yi's "escape" from the city
 was with Conn anist contrivance and with Communist "advisors".  FU apparently
 was sent to Kueisui, caaital of Suiyuan, to arrange for a peaceful turnover
 of the province, where the present leaders have refused to accept Communist
 terms,.  Despite Communist desire to take the area by negotiation and thus
 eliminate  any possibility of opposition from that sector, FIJ has not yet
 succeeded and it is suspected that he may not be lending, himself whole-
 heartedly to the effort.
 CCP 1a1in    oundwork for "reacetirse" err Y._-i4ith the coming of comparative   "B"
 peace to wide areas of Communist -he.id China, the CCP has begun to concentrate
 upon defining the proper position in the Commmunist hierarchy of its post
 war army.  It appears that, once its primary military uses are come to an
 end, the army is to be shorn of a large measure of its power.  As the mili-
 tary phase of the Communist revolution draws to a close, the power of the
 FLA in areas already liberated is being carefully curtailed.  The top
 political leaders, itAO Tse-tung and LIU Shao-chi for example cannot continue
 to tolerate the great popularity of military leaders-LIN Piao and Liii ?o-
 cheng for example.--nor can they permit them to gain positions from which
 the preeminence of the political. leadership could be threatened.  However,
 the exigencies of the present military situation require that, in areas of
 active combat, this debilitating of the military must be delayed or held
 in abeyance,
 The Party has lately taken the following steps to clarify this post-
 war subordination of the military.  It has abrogated Forth China's war
 service regulations which had provided the legal basis for mobilizing the

 area's population and resources.  It has broached plans for the creation
 of a "modern" army in Manchuria.  It has set up various "bandit suppression"
 bodies to occupy the troops and keep them away from the corrupting influence
 of city life.  It has introduced a new organizational twist into the army
 reducing large numbers of combat troops to garrison status.  It has separa-
 ted certain commanders whose influence la-distrusted from direct command
 of their troops, split up the forces of other, and transferred still others
 from; the areas where their power had been based.
 The Communists have added a series of organizations called Military
 Ai yes, garrison commands charged with the maintainence of peace and orecr,
 to their Field Armies, whose responsibility remains the successful completion
 of assigned tasks of liberation.  Following liberation, the Field Armies are
 either: (1) moved as a unit to another area for further operations; (2)
 retained intact to garrison the area liberated; or (3) split with a contin-
 gent to each assignment.  LIN Piao was deprived of his carefully nourished
 position in the Northeast (Manchuria) under the press of military necessity.
 He was shunted from the "Northeast to North China and from there into Central
 China,  He is now committed to operations near Hengyang in southern Hunan.
 The military authority in the Northeast has passed to the Northeast Military
 Area under KAO Kang and CHOU Pao-chung.  KAO is concurrently chairman of
 the Northeast People' 3 Government and CHOU has boon in Manchuria since 1931,
 first as an anti-Japanese guerrilla and later as a top subordinate of LIN Piao.
 After the liberation of North China, NIEB Jung chan's north China command
 lost two of its three major units.  These were dispatched to assist PENG
 Teh-huai in the liberation of the Northwest.  The unit which remained in
 North China then formed the nucleus of the North China Military Area under
 NIEH's command.  Chen YI in Fast China and PFAQ Teh-huai in Northwest China
 now command both Field Armies and Military Areas and may remain in control of
 the areas they are now liberating.
 The steps taken are but preliminary to the Communists' principal task
 in this regard--that of demobilization.  They must find or create positions
 which offer returns commensurate with the contributions of military leaders
 but which at the same time will not provide these commanders with spring-
 boards from which they could eventually challenge the elements presently
 controlling the Party.  Demobilized troops must be assured of an adequate
 means of liv'libood to keep them loyal to the concept of a Communist China
 and out of the ever-present armed bands opposing that concept.  No Chinese
 regime since Dr. SUN's revolution has successfully dealt with the "tiger" of
 demobilization, but the CCP has made a start.
 Manchvrian harvest ~rrospects poor-Estimates based on the scanty available    "B"
 information indicate that this year's Manchurian harvest will be extremely
 short and will at best. provide only a small. exportable surplus.  Since the
 war kanchurian crop acreage has been sharply reduced and the weather condi-
 tions throughout the present growing season have been the most adverse in
 many years.  The acreage reduction is one result of widespread unrest which

 Ek ,s discouraged farriers from cultivating in excess of their owe immediate
 new,  in addition curtailment of railroad services has restricted cultiva-
 tion on the more remote farms.  Export markets have been inaccessible,
 further reducing the production of cash crops for market.    Dro  ht,, an
 aver--present agricultural hazard, has materially damaged current crops in
 north and central Manchuria.  No rain fell in Krin Province until late
 July and the drought extended for still another month in Hellungkiang ,and
 5t ngkiang.  The major crops, wheat and soy beans, will have suffered most
 einco they are less resistant to drought than millet and maize..    In southern
 churia, where kaoliaag is the forest; crop, the Liao River, which Y-~1[38
 t"_-rough its richest agricultural area, was flooded by excessive rains during
 vane and July, and nearly one million acres of crop land in Liaohsi and
 ?..iaoning were reported dam ged.  In addition the Chinese Communists in
 Manchuria have been unable to provide the farmers with sufficient fertilizers,
 proper irrigation, transportation, tools, draft animals and other agricul-
 tural stimulants formerly available.
 Widespread hunger and scattered famines are in prospect for Manchuria
 this winter.  These conditions will increase the already existing anti-
 Communist discontent and may lead to further armed uprisings.  Little if
 any food will be available for North, China, where famines will be epidemic.
 It appears unlikely therefore that Manchuria will be the attractive haven
 for North China's excess population as envisaged by the forth China People'e
 Government.   Moreover, major food shortages in Manchuria will result in a
 great curtailment of that area.'s contribution to the US SPA liancharian trade
 pact.
 BURMA
 New   lit3.cal schism   ssib:a.e _The position of the Burmese Socialist Party   "B"
 ) in Burmese politics, since its leaders resigned from the Cabinet in
 Apri]. 1949, has been relatively obscure.  Two trends, however, have become
 increasingly discernable.  First, BSP and Government policies have diverged
 to a considerable degree since April.  The now comparatively conservative
 Government has shown a growing tendency to align itself more closely-with
 the nest and defer the implementation of nationalization policies, while
 than 13SP has continued to advocate a program of extrer-m and more immediate
 leftism.  Second, there appear  to be forming at least three factions in
 the BSP:  (1) an ultra-lof '.ist group under U Ba Swe,  the party's General
 Secretary, (2) a group led by former Foreign. Minister U t;yaw Nyein which
 is perhaps somewhat less radical than Ba Swe's and (3) a group which follows
 Defense Minister and Supreme Commander  Pie din.  As matters now stand, the
 Ba? controls the parliament and has reluctantly acquiesed to the Government's
 more conservative approach to Burmese problems.   Both Socialist and Govern-
 ,
 maent leaders probably recognize the serious consequences which could rezLLtt
 from new political.. crises, and have thus avoided a ma f or i deological collision.
 Nevertheless, tti.srrltherelarechanges

 ire din, who has meticulously avoided identifying himself with any political
 organization or expressing  his views on controversial issues, figures
 prominently in all of them. First, it is possible that Ne din will ccntin-
 tie to support the present Government and its policies, and that the BSF
 will regroup into two factions:  those supporting the Government and those
 gApea" it.  Seconds the Socialists may attempt to regain control of the
 Government and restore a program based upoa complete state socialism.  How-
 ever, to accomplish this aim, they would at least require Ne din's tacit
 consent, and probably be forced to accept his leadership.  Third, No  in
 may attempt to assume personal control of Burmese affairs.
 PlILlPPf?FS
 Special session imminent--As the result of a recent Supreme Court decision   e'BK
 nullifying two of his executive orders providing for appropriations in
 FY 1950, President Quirino is faced with the necessity of calling a special
 session of Congress--a measure which he would prefer to postpone until after
 the November election.
 Last May when it appeared that Quirino forces had lost control of the
 5enatee, the regular session of Congress adjourned suddenly without passing
 the budget and other important legislation.  Instead of calling a special
 session of Congress, Quitino decided to use emergency powers derived from
 a law passed in December 1941 which has never been repealed.  By ecutive
 order he authorized a budget for FY 1950 and a fund of ~6,000,,000 for the
 November elections.
 In July the Nacionalista Party brought a petition before the Supreme
 Court challenging the constitutionality of Qu: ino's use of the smergency
 powers in peacetime.  On 16 September, by a majority vote of 6-2, the
 Supreme Court held that the executive orders were issued without authority
 of law. The Courts decision becomes effective within 15 days and the
 Commissioner of the Budget reportedly has stated that If President Quirino
 fails to call Congress into session before the end of that period, the release
 of further funds will be halted.
 Should' a special session of Congress be called, Quirino forces are
 likely to face political defeat in the Senate where they no longer control
 a working majority.  A Nacionalista-Avelinista coalition may be formed to
 depose the pro-Quirino acting Senate President and elect a man of their
 own. There is also a possibility that supporters of Jose Avelino, Quirino' .s
 rival for the Presidency, within the Liberal Party,, Will be able to obtain
 his readmission to the Senate from which he was suspended by Quirino forces
 last April.  Such a favorable change in the political fortunes of Avelino
 way draw vacillating L:bera:   from Quirino back to Avelino thus further
 :iividirig the Liberal vote and further improving the chances of Nacionaliata
 candidate Josee P. Laurel.
