 Swedish Communists Stop Publishing WORLD MARXIST REVIEW.  As of the
 beginning of this year, the Swedish Communist Party (SKP) ceased publica-
 tion of INTERNATIONELL REVY (International Review), the Swedish edition
 of the Soviet-sponsored international monthly, WORLD MARXIST REVIEW/PROB-
 LEMS OF PEACE AND SOCIALISM.  Declining circulation was given as the rea-
 son, and indeed the magazine had only an average monthly circulation of
 approximately 1,000.  Some copies were distributed in Finland, Norway and
 Denmark.  According to other reports, the magazine was considered too
 "orthodox" by the present "revisionist" leaders of the Swedish Communist
 Party (SKP).  Whatever the reason, (and it was probably a combination of
 the two cited above), Communist publications in Europe have steadily dec-
 lined in circulation and influence during the past twenty years, -- a
 fact which has been underscored by numerous items in this column during
 the past several months.
 IZVESTIYA Begins a Comic Strip.  The Soviet Government's leading
 daily,  IZVESTIYA (News), has recently inaugurated a comic strip, which to
 date has been used chiefly to draw attention to shortcomings in Soviet
 services by the use of heavy-handed humor.  One strip showed a pipe-smok-
 ing engineer with a Dagwood haircut, naturally named Ivan Ivanich, buy-
 ing a pair of roller skates so he could hitch a ride on the back of one
 of Moscow's overcrowded buses.  Another showed him treating 18 families
 to drinks at an outdoor fruit stand because restaurants were too full.
 "Ivan Ivanich" is believed to be the first comic strip in any of the more
 authoritative Soviet newspapers. (Sample attached)   (Unclassified)
 Castro Government Building Vast Radio Network.  Communist Cuba is
 well on the road to  possessing one of the world's more powerful  inter-
 national broadcasting complexes.   In February 1967, at Holguin in Oriente
 Province, the Cubans opened a 150,000 watt medium wave facility, which
 is three times as powerful as the most powerful U.S. commercial stations.
 (The power of U.S. domestic stations is restricted by the FCC to 50,000
 watts)  Now a 50,000 watt Cuban station has been opened at Cocucum,
 only 15 miles from the Holguin facility,  These are only two of six
 powerful transmitters ordered from Czechoslovakia.  To date nothing is
 known of Cuban plans for the other four. The two stations already on
 the air are so powerful as to interfere seriously with domestic broad-
 casts in the U.S.A., and in neighboring countries in the Caribbean and
 Central America.  As Cuba is a signatory to the North American Regional
 Broadcast Agreement on the use of broadcasting frequencies, there may be
 formal protests over the interference caused by the Cuban stations.
 Observers speculate that Cuba is hastening the development of Communist
 propaganda facilities in connection with the "Solidarity Conference of

 At the request of Yu. M. Aksenov of the city Hiepaya, Ivan Ivanych
 today solves the problem of "peak-hour" transportation for our city
 dwellers.  We hope that city Soviets (councils) will find still other
 means.  Perhaps less original, but no less radical.

 Czechs and     Six Spies Tried in Two
 East Germans   Days.
 Run Agents           Two espionage cases,
 in France involving six per-
 sons, were recently
 tried behind closed doors in the Cour
 de la Surete de 1'Etat in Paris.   On
 26 April, two men who had spied for
 Czechoslovakia were condemned to eight
 and four year sentences.   Stephan Kri-
 govsky, who received the longer sen-
 tence, had once been a General Secre-
 tary of Communist Youth in Bratislava
 - showing again, as in the cases of
 Shelepin and Semichastny of the Kom-
 somol and theKGB, that there is.a
 close affinity between Communist youth
 work and Communist intelligence acti-
 vity.   Jean Sarady, who was condemned
 along with Krigovsky, had been a pro-
 fessor at a religious institution in
 Toulouse and, as Krigovsky had done,
 had wornreligious garb and had passed
 himself off as a priest.  The two men,
 who had sought to gather information
 .on Czech emigres in France and on the
 French "Concorde" aircraft, had been
 arrested in Toulouse in January 1966.
 The other case, tried on 27 April,
 concerned, two married couples who had
 spied for East Germany, Hans and
 Marianne Bammler and Peter and Renee
 Kranick.  Each of them had been paid
 60,000 francs a year (about $12,000),
 and this had contributed to their
 downfall; Mme. Bammler worked as a
 housekeeper and rode in an expensive
 car, a discrepancy which attracted
 attention.  Her husband had been re-
 cruited in 1960 while working in East
 Berlin, and had later assumed a new
 identity in Egypt, had acquired Swiss
 citizenship, and had moved to Paris in
 1963.   Peter Kranick had been enlisted
 by the East Germans when involved in
 an East Berlin traffic accident while
 he was working for the French Mili-
 tary Government in West Berlin; he
 met his wife while she was working
 for the same organization.   She
 later was employed in the West Ger-
 man Embassy in Paris and then by
 NATO.   French counter-espionage
 agents surprised the couples in bed
 one morning, and found in their
 lodgings a hollow statue concealing
 a miniature camera and codes.   They
 had sent postcards with pictures of
 flowers, but the flowers were sprin-
 kled with microdots.   The two couples
 had sought information on NATO.   Sen-
 tences given were:     Peter Kranick -
 20 years; Hans Bammler - 18 years;
 Renee Kranick - 14 years; Marianne
 Bammler - 12 years.   (A French ver-
 sion of the story, from which the
 above is taken, appeared in PRESS

 important conference will follow well
 in advance of the conference.)  The
 first conference of the Latin American
 Solidarity Orgainzation (LASO) will
 meet in Havana from July 28 to August 5
 under the slogan, "The duty of every
 revolutionary is to make revolution."
 Delegations from 27 Latin American
 countries and territories are expected
 to attend.
 LASO is an outgrowth of the Tri
 Continental Conference (TRICON) of
 the Afro-Asian-Latin American Peoples
 Solidarity Organization, which met in
 Havana in January 1966.   TRICON issued
 a resolution supported by the Soviet
 delegation, calling for armed struggle
 for "national liberation."  Castro
 has since criticized the Soviet Union
 for insufficient support to guerrilla
 groups.   At the LASO conference Castro
 will attempt to strengthen his contro:'_
 over the Latin American guerrilla
 movement and will seek to emerge as
 the leader of Latin American Commu-
 nists.
 The agenda for the conference
 concentrates on revolutionary strug-
 gle and armed insurrection for "na-
 tional liberation" by workers, pea-
 sants, students, and intellectuals;
 the danger to the "national libera-
 tion" movement presented by reforms
 that alleviate conditions that cause
 people to struggle for "national
 liberation"; unifying opposition to
 "imperialist" actions in the politi-
 cal-military, economic, ideological,
 and cultural fields; defense of the
 Cuban Revolution and opposition to
 "imperialist" economic and political
 isolation of Cuba.   The Inter-American
 Peace Force, the OAS, the Central
 American Defense Council, military
 bases and pacts, "imperialist" finan-
 cial resources and foreign trade, and
 "imperialist" influence on society
 and culture, are all scheduled for
 discussion.
 The conference is also to dis-
 cuss a "sociological survey" conducted
 by LASO on the political, economic,
 cultural, racial, and religious
 structure of each Latin American
 country.   The declared purpose of the
 survey is to provide detailed know-
 ledge for the development of a com-
 mon revolutionary strategy and of
 means of support for revolutionary
 grouses.
 The composition of delegates
 to the conference is disputed among
 Latin American Communists.   In several
 countries the "fidelistas" -- the
 extreme revolutionary splinter groups,
 some being semi-isolated bands of
 guer:^illas .-- are in conflict with
 the officiaL pro-Soviet Communist
 Parties of their countries.   Castro
 wants a conference in which most
 delegations will represent the ex-
 treme revolutionary groups, and which
 will provide him with a base for
 gaining greater control over Commu-
 nist groups throughout Latin America.
 The organizers hope that LASO
 will emerge from the conference as
 a fully structured organization.
 Plans for a LASO Bulletin, for in-
 stance, are underway.   LASO's emphasis,
 however, is on armed revolutionary
 struggle, and the Conference is
 expected to aim mainly  at estab-
 lishing unity among the various revo-
 lutionary groups.
 Why Do They    The Refugee: Symbol

 reported that approximately 100 East
 Europeans who were attending the world
 ice hockey championships had requested
 political asylum in Austria.   In
 Austria alone 3,850 persons were
 granted asylum in 1966.
 Flights from the communist world
 have become quite common.  Yet the
 refugee's decision to leave his home-
 land is an experience filled with
 pathos.  Although escape from some
 countries may be easier, the refugee
 is often separated from his family
 and friends, possibly for life.  Still
 the exodus continues away from commu-
 nist states -- rarely the other way.
 An unclassified background paper
 gives data on the number of people who
 have "voted with their feet."

 1125.         VIETNAM:  "NON-ALIGNED" CONFERENCE IN STOCKHOLM
 WPC Prepares to Manipulate Pacifists
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   (UNCLASSIFIED)  On the initiative of some Swedish
 pacifists, a World Conference on Vietnam will be held in Stockholm,
 Sweden from 6 to9 July.  The initial promoters of the Conference are the
 prominent leftist pacifist, Bertil Svahnstr8m, a Swedish council member
 of the Britain-headquartered, non-Communist International Confederation
 for Disarmament and Peace (ICDP) and the Communist-influenced Swedish
 Peace and Arbitration Society (SPAS), a,Swedish peace organization formed
 in 1883 of which Svahnstr8m is a leading member.  The Conference will take
 place under the SPAS' titular auspices.
 At least eight international peace organizations', including the
 World Peace Council (WPC), have promised to take part in the Stockholm
 Conference, and there is increasing evidence that the WPC is seizing the
 initiative from the non-aligned, leftist/pacifist sponsors and supporters.
 At the WPC's Presidential Committee meeting in Prague (February
 215-27,,,1967), Vietnam and European security were the main topics and
 considerable importance was attached to the Stockholm conference.   In
 March, Romesh Chandra, the Indian secretary general of the WPC, stated
 that Vietnam would be virtually the sole focus of attention for the WPC
 over the next few months,   In his report at Prague on the work, program,
 and organizational problems of the WPC, Chandra underlined the need for
 cooperation among various social and, political groupings (i.e. united
 fronts);   and said that every effort should be made to isolate the USA
 and by these tactics force her to agree to talks about Vietnam.

 About 350 to 400 delegates are expected to participate in the Confer-
 ence, including representatives of North Vietnam and of the National Front
 for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NFLSV).,  Many national committees,
 especially in Europe, but also in such countries as I.-,he UAR and India,
 have been formed to prepare for the meeting.   A spec:.al effort is being
 made to obtain impressive representation from countries 'which support the
 American war effort in Vietnam.  The organizing comrn::.ttee drew up a list
 of the appropriate numbers of delegates from each country, e.g.,25 from
 Sweden, 20 from the great powers. down to one from Luxembourg and New
 Zealand.  Svahnstr8m, chairman of the organizing committee (Address:
 Jungfrugatan 30, Stockholm c.), wrote a lengthy article on the forthcom-
 ing Conference which appeared in the March issue of the WPC's publication,
 PERSPECTIVES.  f= Note:  Information contained in the article as
 to the purpose of the meeting and the procedures to be followed is borne
 out in classified reporting.                    Svahnstr8m says inter alia:
 "The idea behind the initiative is to coordinate a worldwide
 public opinion for the common aim to stop the Vietnam war, to ex-
 plore the ways and means most likely to lead to results, and to pre-
 sent the case of the Vietnamese people in a way strong enough to
 make the 'war lords in Washington' listen."
 Svahnstr8m also related that after informal preliminary talks of represen-
 tatives of peace groups in Stockholm (29-30 October),, the meeting released
 a press communique, which said in part:
 "...consideration was given to the proposal... for... a conference
 to initiate efforts to end the war in Vietnam and to ensure indepen-
 dence for the Vietnamese pecple in accordance with the Geneva agree-
 ments of 1954.  The meeting decided to bring together representatives...
 from parliaments, trade unicns, religious bodies, universities and
 other groups from all continents.   Experts in various fields are
 being invited to join in the preparation of documents to be distribu-
 ted in advance of the conference..."
 Organizing and editorial committees (the ICDP is in charge of the editor-
 ial committee; address:  Gerry Hunnius, general secretary, ICDP, 3 Handon
 Ave., London N.3)* were formed at the October meeting;.  The two committees
 met in Stockholm on 16-17 December and issued a communique which stated in
 part
 It is interesting to note that the WPC has tried to play
 down Hunnius's ICDP identification, apparently not wanting to adver-
 tise unnecessarily its tactical collaboration with the ICDP.  (END

 SITUATION:     (UNCLASSIFIED)                                     The Communist-front International
 Organization of Journalists (IOJ) is much smaller, more specialized and
 less,in evidence than the mass.membershp fronts with which it cooperates
 closely, and it is particularly important to the Communist propaganda
 structure because of these very characteristics.   It seeks to influence
 those who report, analyze and disseminate news, and, equally important,
 it serves to reinforce the campaigns of the larger fronts by publiciz-
 ing and participating in their activities.   Thus, it is not surprising
 that the IOJ has announced it will be represented at the World Conference
 for Peace in Vietnam to be held in Stoclcholm, 6-9 July1967.   (See
 Item #11255, this BPG.    For IOJ positions on the Vietnam problem, see
 unclassified attachment.) IOJ President Jean-Maurice Hermann (who is
 also Secretary General of the French Journalists' Union, an affiliate
 of the Communist-controlled Confederatipn Generale du Travail) frankly
 admits that the IOJ is a political as well as a trade union organization.
 This was not always so.
 I.                   .:
 The IOJ was founded in Copenhagen in June 1946 as a world-wide
 successor to the International Federation of Journalists of Allied and
 Free Countries which., in turn, had been formed in London in 1941 to re-
 place the International Federation of.Journalists (IFJ)., paralyzed by
 the Axis occupation of most of continental Europe.   The IOJ, initially
 headquartered in London, was a bona fide journalists' organization only
 during the first year of its existence.,  At the Second Congress (Prague,
 June 1947), the Soviet Bloc delegations although not in a majority,
 'achieved voting control, moved the IOJ headquarters to Prague, and
 installed a Czech Communist in the key position of Secretary General-
 Treasurer,   By the eve of the Third Congress, finally held in Helsinki
 in 1950, the exodus of non-Communist affiliates had left the IOJ composed
 entirely of Communists and fellow-travelers.   When its first President,
 Archibald Kenyon,, a distinguished British journalist, resigned in late
 1949, he labeled the IOJ a Party puppet and a Cominform tool.   It has
 continued under Soviet control and manipulation ever since, initially
 treating its rivals (the non-Communist IFJ was reconstituted in 1952;
 its headquarters are in Brussels)with scorn and abuse; but since the mid-
 50's it has more relied on united front tactics, urging Western and
 neutralist journalists to cooperate and collaborate with the IOJ on
 common objectives.

 The IOJ's unity campaign oJDened in Helsinki in June 1956 with the
 first International Meeting of Journalists (IMJ),"a great gathering
 irrespective of political or other distinctions from all parts of the
 world." The IFJ refused to participate, pointing out that its affiliates
 had helped to found the IOJ, had withdrawn because of the "persistent
 use of its forum for virulent political propaganda," and added:   "It is
 not possible for us to consider a reunification until a radical change
 is effected in the conditions of the press in those countries which are
 represented by national organizations in tae IOJ."  The IFJ has also
 declined all subsequent overtures.   A number of Afro-Asian and Latin
 American journalists were, however, drawn into the planning for the
 meeting, and an even larger number attended.   Among the neutralist dele-
 gates, enthusiasm for international journalists' unity waxed so strong
 that the IOJ found itself in danger of losing control.   President
 Heimann even declared IOJ's willingness to dissolve -- if the IFJ would
 follow suit.   The final outcome was the establishment of a Committee
 "representing the East and the West, as well as neutral countries,"
 which subsequently assumed the name of the "International Corm-nittee for
 Cooperation of Journalists" (ICCJ).   This body, a still ill-disguised
 IOJ subsidiary -- a front for the front, so to speak -- is now head-
 quartered in Rome.
 In the intervening years, the ICCJ has held a not very successful
 2nd IMJ in Baden, Austria, in October 1960 and a 3rd meeting in September-
 October 1963.   This last conference was somewhat more successful;, partic-
 ularly among Africans and Arabs because it was convened aboard the
 Russian liner "Litva", cruising the Mediterranean.   (The Chinese boy-
 cotted the meeting because of its Soviet control.)                        At each port of
 call -- Naples, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, Port Said and Beirut -- meetings
 were held with local leaders and journalists.   A 4th IMJ, suggested for
 Summer 1967 in Latin America, now appears unlikely :before 1.968, and the
 site is still undetermined.
 Meanwhile, the parent IOJ finally held its IVtl1 Congress after a
 lapse of 8 years in May 1958 (Bucharest) , its Vth in August =.962 (Buda-
 pest), and its VIth in October 1.966 (East Berlin).   The VIIth is sched-
 uled to be held in Havana in 1970.
 During this period, the IO_-, although not ignoring the rather diffi-
 cult target represented by the Journalists of the developed) non-Communist
 world, has gradually intensified its interest in the developing areas
 with the primary objective of influencing the growing numbers of jour-
 nalists of Africa, Asia and Latin America.   In those areas, IOJ offi-
 cials have traveled regularly, initiating and. maintaining contacts; IOJ
 has enlarged its membership, both organizational and individual, and has
 elected officials from those areas.
 In 1961, the IOJ announced its "Three Year Plan for the Development
 of the Press, Radio and Television in Africa, Asia and Latin America"
 with the intent of "a more rapid elimination of the remnants of

 colonialism", The Plan (which ends this year but will presumably be
 extended by the Executive Committee at its next meeting in Ulan Bator,
 6-9 September 1967) covers gifts of equipment, limited financial aid
 through  the IOJ's International Solidarity Fund, and -- above all --
 training.
 In the field of journalistic training, the IOJ and its Czechoslovak
 and East German national affiliates operated informally for a number of
 years, offering individuals opportunities for travel and observation.
 In late 1963 and early 196)4, however, training activities were formalized.
 The ?OJ opened its International Center for the Training of Journalists
 from the Developing Countries, offeringe3-month courses, in Budapest.
 mWWWWO  The IOJ is also reported to be considering the establishment
 of an Institute of Press Study and Communications Media sometime in
 1967.   END        }  The Union of (East) German Journalists operates the
 "School of Solidarity" near Berlin, offering 6-12 months courses for
 African, Asian and Latin American                   GOPFRFFA''Its  Director
 recently claimed to have graduated 60 journalists so far, and to have 20
 students from 9 African and Asian countries in the current (5th) course.
 END            The Union of Czechoslovak Tournal_ists and the Czech News
 Agency (CTK) jointly operate the International School for News Agency
 Journalism and Techniques, where instruction includes practical on-the-
 job training in CTK's bureaus.   In addition, the USSR's educational
 activities must not be overlooked.   Fu_l  scholarships, including those
 offered to journalism students, play a significant role in the Soviet
 plan for long-range influence on the molding of public opinion in the
 developing areas.
 Among other activities, both the Czech and East German affiliates
 will assist the host Union of Journalis s of Cuba in organizing a
 Seminar for Latin American Journalists  .n Havana sometJme during Summer
 1967.   Both, as'well as the IOJ, are publishing  journalism text books.
 All, with some CTK participation, have assisted variously in a few local
 courses and seminars -- in Mali, Guinea, Algeria and Afghanistan.
 CTK has cooperative agreements with, among others,
 Tanzania and Afghanistan; the 10J has offered assistance to the Kenya
 News Agency.  END
 IOJ activities in ,the, developing areas appear to have had success
 in Africa, where the front is operating in its own name, through the
 development of personal and sometimes inconspicuous relationships, and 11 also through the Pan-African Union of Journalists (PAUJ) which'it helped
 to establish in 1961.   The PAUJ, headed, by IOJ Vice President Jean-
 Baptiste Deen of Guineas is analogous in the journalists' field to the
 All-African Trade Union Federation and bras also controlled by Nkrumah
 until hisfall,                       Following the February 1966 coup in
 Ghana, Deen caused a slight ripple of doubt by sandwiching a trip to
 Peking "between two visits to Prague, but showed no evidence of being
 other than pro-Soviet at the VIth Congress.   END     __-

 In Asia, the IOJ has followed the "travel and personal contact"
 route with some minor success.  For example, Secretary General Jiri
 Meisner visited India in the summer of 1966 and was able to arrange a
 liaison committee for Indian re-presentatio.ra at the VIth Congress.   The
 All-China Journalists Association and the Union of Albanian Journalists
 are still listed as IOJ affilia-:es, but neither was represented at the
 VIth Congress or the Executive Committee meeting which preceded. it in
 September.  The Sino-Soviet split is a fact of life in the IOJ.  The
 split was already widening when the IOJ-?supported Afro-Asian Journalists'
 Conference was held in Bandung in April 1963.   The :;hinese and Indones-
 ians gained control of the meeting and of the Afro-Asian Journalists'
 Association (AAJA) which was formed there.   The AAJA, though, is not the
 rival it once was.   It was never able to garner more than hard pro-
 Peking support in Africa, its Center in Djakarta has disintegrated, and
 it now has apparently no real strength in Asia.
 In Latin America, the IOJ claims "an affiliated organization in
 every country, and one in three journalists as a member".   The published
 roster (See unclassified attachment) lists groups in 13 countries,
 excluding Cuba, 9 of which were admitted at the VItha Congress. The  IOJ
 has long hoped to establish a controlled federation to oppose the non-
 Communist Inter-American Federation of Working Newspapermen.:  Such a
 federation will undoubtedly be discussed again at the Summer 1967 Havana
 Seminar. The IOJ did help to establish, in 1962, a Commission for Infor-
 mation and Cooperation Among Latin American Journal: :sts (CICPLA) which
 maintains an office in Montevide'c, and publishes an occasicnal bulletin.
 An IOJ Executive Committee meeting was held in Santago, Chile, in
 September 1963 -- the last at which Communist China was represented.
 The sessions were closed, probably  in well-founded anti-
 cipation of some disruption by the Chinese, and outside, the excluded
 press was loudly disapproving.,   In the resulting unfriendly atmosphere,
 the IOJ abandoned the planned establishment of a Regional Bureau in
 Santiago in which it had already invested   large sum of money. END
 At the time,disintere,;ted observers called the meeting a fiasco.
 But a year later, Secretary General Meisner,report:ing to the VIth
 Congress, recalled it as "an important event for strengthening our
 contacts... a great manifestation of friendship among democratic jour-
 nalists of the whole world with their Latin American colleagues...."

 CHEN Y1 AVOWS CHINESE AIM~
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:.  On 26 August 1966, Chicom Foreign Minister Chen Yi
 received goup of Swedish visitors belonging to the Swedish Clarte 11
 organization and gave them answers to various questions about Chicom
 aims and policies. The text of the interview has now been published in
 the Swedish organization's bimonthly magazine, CLARTTE, in a special
 issue (1967, No. 1) devoted.to China ad the experiences of the group
 which went. to China.   (Translation and,original of the CLARTE report of
 the interview are attached to this guidance.)
 "Clarte" is an organization of intellectuals originally founded
 in Paris in 1919; the organ of the Swedish branch began publication
 in 1924.   Once a left-Socialist student-professorial organization,
 the Swedish branch came under Communist influence; and is now pro-
 Chicom.   The group is a rallying point for Swedish radical youth.
 According to NCNA reports of last summer, the Clarte tourists
 travelled in China with French mezgbers of the "Un~ve.rsi,ty Students'
 `section of the Franco-Chinese Frigndship Society."  On the way back
 to Sweden through the Soviet Union, the Swedish travellers had the
 experience of having the Chicom publications they were carrying
 seized by Soviet authorities; NCNA published their letter of pro-
 test.
 Since Chen Yi was addressing what for all intents and purposes was
 a Chicom-controlled group, he spoke very frankly.   One notable feature
 of his remarks was his endorsement of the "dQminotheory" of Southeast
 Asian politics -- i.e., the belief that if South Vietnp,m falls, other
 Southeast Asian countries will fall to,Coxpmunism as wei.l, as a row of
 standing dominoes falls.   (Chen Yi wrongly attributed this theory to
 President Johnson; actually it was originated by President Eisenhower.
 It should also be noted that Chen Yi sqmewhat distorted the American
 elsAmerican ewhere,d but that ife      would
 wAmericann defeat that
 entail
 ~                                                                       falls into
 o
 the hands of the Communists through a failure of the United States to
 assist the South, the other Southeast Asian countries would then --
 again, if not assisted by the U.S. -- fall successively under Communist
 control.)
 Other points of interest (with comment in italicb):
 1.   Chen Yi says:   "We can't export the revolution."  He also denies
 that China is carrying on any subversive work.   But he states:
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060004-9
 (1127 Cont.)
 Approved For Release 2000JM%7-?-CJA-RDP78-03061A000400060004-9
 "Our present foreign policy is concentrated on resisting the
 American aggression and helping Vietnam.   We use every possi-
 bility to support the Vietnamese people in the battle against
 the U.S.A. imperialists."
 And Chen Yi says further:
 "Therefore our foreign policy all over the world is to encour-
 age the nations to display the broadest',                                most genuine and
 efficient united front that includes the nations from all
 aspects.  The united front must be the broadest possible, but
 it won't include the new Soviet revisionists."
 He also predicts that "after the U.S.A. imperialism has been con-
 quered in Vietnam, the national revolution in Latin America and
 Africa will experience a new tidal wave."
 With a policy which resists "U.S.A. aggression" and which pro-
 poses a united front excluding the Soviets, it is not hard to see
 what country is to assume the leadership.  Latin Americans and
 Africans may be interested to know that their tidal wave is due
 after a U.S. defeat in Vietnam.
 2.  Chen Yi strongly endorses Lin Piao's doctrine that the rural
 areas should rise in rebellion against the cities -- i.e., that
 Asian, African, and Latin American nations should rise against
 Europe and the United States and "devour" them.   He denies, however,
 that China opposes the "revolutionary movement" in Europe and the
 United States. Chen says:
 "... We must mobilize young people who will unite  with the
 farmers and workers.  This is the basic strategy of Marxism-
 Leninism; here the implication is to change the conditions of
 exploitation and the difference between ccuntry and city."
 One wonders if the plan is not to reduce the city dwellers to
 peasants, rather than raise the level of the peasants.
 3.   Castro becomes a subject of discussion during the interview,
 in connection with anti-Chinese statements by the Cuban leader.
 After a long statement in which Castro is bracketed with other
 critics of China, including the Pope, Chen Yi says, "I don't want
 Castro to steal more of our precious time," and adds that while he
 is not in a position to say whether Castro is turning against China
 on Soviet orders:
 "We all know that the U.S.A. imperialists hate China above
 everything.   They explain that China is the U.S.A.'s enemy
 Number One.   The fact that Castro now appears and shows himself
 to be,in opposition to China, denotes a gesture to the U.S.A."

 Chen's statements about Castro seam designed to show contempt.
 4.  On the Cultural Revolution, Chen Yi says:
 "Each [Chinese] private person has to clarify his attitude
 toward this revolution: whetl?er he is for it,. and marching on-
 'ward or whether he will be irk the way and be conquered."
 He claims that the Cultural Revoll4tion gives the workers and stu-
 dents a chance "to practice a comprehensive democracy with the right
 to participate directly in the governmental rule."    There have
 been some recent reports that Chen is in danger of being ousted;
 While no one can predict the course of events in today's China,
 his statements on  in Piao's ideas and on the Cultural Revolution
 make us wonder why the Maoists should want Chen's removal.
 5.   Chen Yi thinks. that the Soviets follow a policy of cooperation
 with the U.S. "in order to dominate the whole world."  He suspects
 that Moscow and Washington use the "hot line" to concert their
 plans.   He says it is known "to all the nations in the world" that
 New York and Washington have grown wealthy by exploiting the rural
 areas of the worlds including the rural U.S.; the wealth, is used to
 train urban workers to become aristocrats.  Hebelieves the American
 people have "risen in rebellion to fight their own country's
 imperialism,'  and -- although he_speaks of democracy in China --
 he does not think the American people have the right to dismiss
 President Johnson.    Chen Yi's state of doctrinaire ignorance --
 assuming, as is probable, that he expressed his true opinions -
 is not only, deplorable, but also dangerous.                          25X1 C1 Ob

 THE USSR AND NORTH VIETNAM GOVERNMENTS
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  On 22 April 1967' the Thai Ambassador to Moscow was
 summoned to the Soviet Ministry of -Foreign Affairs and handed a stiff
 protest note upbraiding the Royal Thai Government (RTG) for permitting
 the U.S. to mount air strikes from Thailand against North Vietnam.  The
 Soviet note was replete with the usual accusations of "U.S. aggression",
 "bandit war in Vietnam", and the like, and was probably triggered by the
 RTG's March 1967 public sanction of U.S. fighter-bomber bases in Thailand
 and the RTG's simultaneous decision to send a 2,100 man battalion to
 assist South Vietnam in the war against the north.   On 4 May the Soviet
 Ambassador to Bangkok was, in his turn, summoned to the Thai Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs where an Under Secretary handed him a Note Verbale.   The
 Thai Note sharply rejected the Soviet protests and charges, attacked
 the USSR in its role as co-chairman of the Geneva Conference, and made
 scathing references to North Vietnamese and Soviet violations of the
 international laws by which civilized nations govern. themselves (see
 texts of notes in unclassified section).                                    25X1C10b

 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  With an unresolved conflict between the regime and the
 country's most successful Communist author, and with a writers congress
 in the offing, Czechoslovakia appears toobe entering another round in
 the continuing struggle between top Communist authorities and Czech and
 Slovak  intellectuals.  Ladislav Mnacko , a veteran Communist with a
 partisan record and a long-time friend of top CF leaders, wrote a book,
 THE TA$TE,OF POWER,, in which he bitterly criticized Stalinism and, im-
 plicitly, the present system in Czechoslovakia.   The West German and
 Austrian press reports that Mnacko gained written-permission from CP
 authorities to publish his book both in Czechoslovakia and in Austria.
 Subsequently, however, top Czech leaders, probably on orders from CP
 boss Novotny himself, halted the serial publication of THE TASTE OF
 POWER in Czech and tried unsuccessfully to retrieve the manuscript from
 the Austrian publishers with whom Mnacko, had dealt.  Meanwhile, in the
 April 1967 issue of PLAMEN ( TORCH; the literary monthly of the Writers'
 Union) indicates that a writers' congress will be scheduled in the near
 future.   Past regime-versus-writers quarrels can be expected to rise to
 the surface if the congress is held.
 The Mnacko stoxy differs, from the usual regime-writer conflict in
 that Mnacko is writing as a member of the inner circle of the party,
 and also in that he goes ruthlessly to the heart of the( matter:  the
 corruption, inadequacies, and injustices of the system (rather than
 merely treating segments of the problem,. as liberal writers in the Bloc
 are apt to do, in the hope of fostering gradual changes in the system).
 I
 After the regime changed its mind and decided against publication,
 Mnacko was given the opportunity to cooperate by allowing the censors to
 trim his book before publishing it at home and by requesting the Austrian
 publisher'-- Verlag Fritz Molden -- to return his manuscript.  Mnacko
 evidently opposed censorship and is reported to have urged Molden to go
 ahead and publish his book.
 The next move is W ,to the Czech CP leadership.  They can opt to
 continue to suppress THE TASTF OF POWER or to release the book for
 publication.  Both alternatives are unattractive, for the regime knows

 it will lose either way.  Perhaps Novotny will decide for release, since
 the appearance of the book in German (March 1967) and its forthcoming
 publication in Groat Britain and the U.S.  (around June 1967) will increase
 pressures at home for a Czech edition; the country's intellectuals may
 well add to this pressure by voicing their objections to Czechoslovakia's
 growing reputation for banning books.   The forthcoming writers' congress
 may coincide with the announcement of the regime's decision on Mnacko's
 book, and in any case should serve to amplify discussion of the case.
 For the writers as a group have a stake in the Mnacko conflict, inasmuch
 as a favorable o  unfavorable decision would indicate the trend of the
 regime's publication policies for some time to come.  Czech writers visit-
 ing Western Europe have remarked, in the context of discussions of the
 intellectual climate in their country, that the forthcoming writers con-
 gress will be "a hot one."
 The struggle between the regime and the writers has considerable
 significance in and of itself.  At issue, basically, is the right of
 authors to write and have published books that criticize the reality of
 life in Czechoslovakia.  Secondary disputes revolve around the regime's
 methods of keeping the writers under control.  The regime, to strengthen
 its hand, has sought to enlist the support of the workers by continually
 fanning their animosity towards the intellectuals.   ;Novotny has been
 particularly active in this effort.   In their relationships with the out-
 side world of creative intellectuals, the Czechoslovak writers have been
 particularly frustrated.   In ear--y 1966, for example, a delegation of
 Czechoslovak writers went to Moscow to try to find out first-hand about
 the condemned fellow-writers, Sinyavskiy and Daniel.   Shortly thereafter
 two well-known authors, Josef Grossman and Vaclav Havel, had their pass-
 ports taken away.   Subsequently, only a small delega'~:ion of Czechs* was
 permitted to attend the significant International PEN Congress in New
 York in June 1966.
 Addendum:  FYI, reports
 describe the bitter struggle between Mnacko and the regime as an extension
 of the struggle between Czech and Slovak factions of the CP of Czechoslov-
 akia.             They state explicitly that Novotny, the head of the Czech faction,
 gave his oral approval to the publication of Mnacko's'book but later,
 after the impact of the initial installment was known, reacted by ordering
 the publication stopped and by firing Pavel Auersperg, Chief' of the Depart-
 ment of Ideology of the CP of Czechoslovakia.                                    25X1 C1 Ob
 The Czechs took umbrage at the fact that the Ceylonese delegation
 was larger than theirs.

 Those Who Voted With Their Feet
 Since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, more than 16,000,000 have
 fled from communism and have chosen the uncertainties of settling in a
 foreign country rather than live (or die) under a Communist state.
 It began when, between 1917-1921 1,500,000 persons escaped from the
 Soviet Union.   The Russian borders were virtually sealed in 1921 and
 the flow was reduced to a mere trickle.
 The next mass exodus occurred after the communist takeovers in
 Eastern Europe.  Altogether, more than 15,000,000 who have fled communism
 in the last twenty years.  More than 1.6 million displaced persons refused
 to return to their homelands in Eastern Europe at the end of World War II.
 Their ranks were swollen by 6Q,000 Czechoslovaks who fled after the
 19+8 Communistcoup.   Some 200,000 Hungarians fled their country in 1956
 after their anti-communist coup was crushed by Soviet tanks and troops.
 Before East Germany erected the Berlin wall in August 1961, she had
 lost 3.7 million citizens which constituted a severe drain of her labor
 force.   Even since that date, an additional 25,000 have evaded armed
 guards, barbed wire and mine fields to reach West Germany to escape the
 hated Ulbricht regime.
 Communism in the Far East and Cuba also brought its waves of refu-
 gees.   8.3 million refugees escaped to free Asian countries.   North
 Korea alone has lost 5 million citizens to the South and more than two
 million have left Mainland China for freedom.   Tibet lost more than
 80,000 citizens to Nepal and India when the Chinese suppressed a major
 revolt in 1959.
 One of the most dramatic refugee movements is taking place in Viet-
 nam.  Whenthe Communists took control of the northern section of the
 country in 195+ more than 900,000 refugees moved south in a period of
 10 months.   And when the Viet Cong launched its full scale war in the
 south more than one million South Vietnamese fled Communist-controlled
 areas from 1960-1967.   These refugees are a grim reminder of what commu-
 nists do to their own countrymen.
 Since Castro established his regime in 1959, more than 350,000
 Cubans have fled their country.  Most have found sanctuary in the United
 States. A US sponsored airlift brought more than 40,000 refugees in
 one year and hundreds of thousands have signed up to leave.  Many still
 hazard their lives by leaving the island in small boats where they risk
 death by drowning or by Communist gunfire.
 Despite all obstacles and hazards, 50 years after the establishment
 of the first Communist government, the exodus from the Communist world
 continues at the rate of more than 25,000 individual border crossings
 per year.

 The International Organization of
 Journalists (IOJ) on Vietnam
 The IOJ adopted a "Resolution on the Vietnam Problem" at the VIth Congress in
 East Berlin in October 1966, which states:
 "In pursuance of its policy of armed intervention U.S. imperialism,
 in July 1954, invaded South Vietnam, installing a puppet regime,
 and aimed at the transformation of South Vietnam into a neo-colony
 and a military basis for attacks on the Democratic Republic of
 Vietnam and countries of Asia, and to perpetuate the division of
 Vietnam...
 "Since the beginning of 1965 the imperialists of the U.S.A. (have)
 disembarked their expeditionary corps in South Vietnam and at the
 same time brought in tens of thousands of soldiers from satellite
 countries:  South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, the
 Philippines.  It should be brought to the special attention of
 world opinion that the West German Government is supporting both
 in a direct and indirect manner, the dirty war against the people
 of Vietnam...
 "The 6th Congress of the IOJ has decided that the member organiza-
 tions of IOJ shall hold weeks of solidarity with journalists and
 the people of Vietnam from December 15th to 20th 1966 and July 20th
 to 27th 1967 (and) shall celebrate September 20th 1967 as the first
 anniversary of the death of Vu Tung, the President of the Associa-
 tion of Patriotic and Democratic Journalists of South Vietnam
 (IOJ), who was murdered by the American aggressors by toxic  as
 on September 20th 1966..."
 Observance of the December 1966 "Week" in Prague was reported by the Czech News
 Service On December 15th:
 "'The week of journalists' solidarity with fighting Vietnam is to
 stimulate the journalists to mobilize their nations in support of
 the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. war and to help
 end the aggression,' declared Secretary of the IOJ Sepp Fischer
 (East Germany) when he opened a photographic exhibition concerning
 Vietnam in the Union of Czechoslovak Journalists in Prague today.
 "The photographs by reported Vladimir Lammer, who visited Vietnam
 in July as a member of the IOJ delegation, mainly show the life and
 work of the Vietnamese people under war conditions.
 "The opening of the exhibition was attended by secretaries of the
 General Secretariat of the IOJ, M.T. Rodriguez (Colombia) and
 Pavel Yerofeyev (USSR), General Secretary of the Union of
 Czechoslovak Journalists Adolf Hradecky, Pham Van Su, DRV

 Ambassador in Prague, and Ha Thanh Lam, representative of the

 "Fischer presented the IOJ protest; against the U.S. aggression
 in Vietnam, which was delivered at the sixth congress held
 in Berlin in October.  He expressed the conviction that an end
 to the aggression would enable the people of Vietnam to solve
 their problem without foreign intervention.  Rodriguez stressed
 the Latin American journalists' admiration for the Vietnamese
 people as representatives of the national liberation struggle
 which is preventing the aggression from escalating into a
 world war.
 "The Vietnamese representatives informed the Journalists
 about the recent bombardment of Hanoi and the increased
 danger which the attack on the heart of the country repre-
 sents.  They reminded the listeners that the Vietnamese
 people are determined to fight to a victorious end regard-
 less of sacrifice."

 ranslation from Clartt                                                may 1967

 The Clart  interviews the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs
 CHEN YI
 The day when the White House in the U.S.A., Whitehall in Great Britain,
 and the Kremlin no longer try to destroy us but give us medals and Nobel
 prizes will be a tragedy for China.  It would mean that we were no longer
 revolutionary...   (Chen Yi, 26 August 1966.)
 QUESTION:  We'd like to ask about the main line of the Chinese foreign
 policy, especially concerning the Chinese attitude and policy toward
 countries which have a national, bourgeois government along with a
 revolutionary movement within the country, for instance: Burma, Egypt,
 Iraq.  What is the difference between the Chinese foreign policy and
 party policy?
 The revolution can't be exported
 ANSWER:   The Chinese foreign policy is adapted to protect the socialistic
 build-up of the country, prevent imperialistic attacks, beat off imperial-
 istic attacks, strengthen the anti-imperialistic, anti-colonialistic unity
 among the nations, guard the existing world peace and prevent a possible
 World War III.
 In relation to the nationally independent countries in Africa, Asia, and
 Latin America we apply the five principles for peaceful coexistence be-
 tween countries with different social systems.  This means that we don't
 meddle in each other's domestic affairs, that we respect each other's
 integrity and sovereignty, that we support the anti-imperialistic, anti-
 colonialistic battle of the nations, that we don't betray them but ex-
 press deep sympathy while we support them.   But the revolution is their
 domestic affair, we can't export the revolution.   The nations must choose
 their road themselves; we are not carrying on any subversive work.   We
 d'on't carry through the revolution by pleading for a world war - the
 revolution among the nations of the world can't be monopolized by the
 Chinese people.
 Our comrade from Sweden mentioned Burma:  that's an interesting example.
 Our relations with the Burmese government are friendly.   But you under-
 stand, in Burma there is the Burmese Communist party and there is a civil
 war between the two - and, in addition, the civil war continues.   Negotia-
 tions were held with the Burmese Communist party but fell through.   Of
 course, we can't meddle in the Burmese affairs.
 Our present foreign policy is concentrated on resisting the American
 aggression and helping Vietnam.  We use every opportunity to support the

 Vietnamese people in the battle against the U.S.A. imperialists.   To
 conquer the U.S.A. imperialists in. Vietnam is one of our main tasks.
 After the U.S.A.'s imperialism has been conquered in Vietnam, the
 national revolution in Latin America and Africa will experience a new
 tidal wave. At that time the world revolution will develop yet another
 step - there will be a basic change in the world situation.
 The domino theory is correct
 The Johnson administration says that they act as if they were playing
 a game of Dominoes.   If they are conquered. in Vietnam they will auto-
 matically be conquered on all other battle-fields.   Therefore they must
 maintain their positions.   He (Lyndon Johnson) is indeed right here.
 You understand, you mustn't think that Johnson is always wrong - some-
 times he is quite right.   Even he sees this problem rather clearly;, this
 is shown by his desperation.   He is aftraid that when U.S.A. imperialism
 is once conquered on the battle-fields in Vietnam, it will automatically
 be conquered on all the other battlefields where it is engaged.   I
 appreciate very much this opinion of his.   Certainly, U.S.A. imperialism
 will be conquered.  U.S.A. imperialism has military bases all over the
 world - how can the nations of the world live on if they don't beat them
 off?  The U.S.A. imperialists have military bases in Japan, South Korea,
 the Philippines, on China's Taiwan; and they are carrying on an aggressive
 war in South Vietnam.   In addition, they also have military bases in Thai-
 land, they attack in the Congo, Leopoldville, in Africa.  In Africa the
 Belgian, Dutch and Portuguese imperialists are also carrying on aggrepsion.
 The U.S.A. imperialists also have military bases in Latin America.  If
 these bases are not discontinued, how can there be any lasting peace?
 Therefore they must be abolished.
 The "'hot" line
 Therefore our foreign policy all over the world is to encourage the
 nations to form the broadest, most genuine and efficient united front that
 includes the nations from all aspects.  The united front must be the broad-
 est possible, but it won't include the new Soviet revisionists.  It en-
 compasses the masses of the Soviet nation, their participation in the anti-
 imperialistic battle, but not the Soviet revisionist leading stratum in the
 Kremlin.  As the Soviet revisionists have their foreign policy clearly out-
 lined -- that is, cooperation between the U.S.A. and the Soviets in order
 to dominate the whole world -- they use a policy in which they ally them-
 selves with the United States in order to oppose China.   This is quite
 clear, we can't expect them to join the anti-imperialistic battle.   Between
 the Kremlin and Washington there is a "hot lihe"; each day connections are
 made across this hot line.  Who knows what's discussed? They have already
 betrayed Marxism-Leninism, they have betrayed the October revolution, they
 have become U.S.A. imperialist accomplices.  We can't; include them. in
 the anti-imperialistic united front.  My conrades from France 'and Sweden
 surely can understand my feelings.  We had contacts with Lenin, with Stalin,
 with Khrushchev, and with Brezhnev and Kosygin.  Maybe we are more experienced

 than you in this respect.  We had contact with Lenin, of course; this
 was very good; with Stalin too.   These men fought imperialism, they
 were rebels.   Of course, we didn't agree on everything in the contacts
 with Stalin.   But anyway there were no big problems with Stalin; you
 understand, he was an anti-imperialist.  But with Khrushchev and Brezhnev
 it was very difficult - they were unreliable.   Everything we told them,
 they told the Americans.   They were going to betray us.  We can't trust
 them, surely you realize that.
 I end this answer by saying:  the present problem is to fight U.S.A.-
 imperialistic aggression all over the world.  At present we have, to an
 increasing extent, to battle against their aggression in Vietnam and also
 to battle against the cooperation between the U.S.A. and the Soviets for
 world dominance.   Our point of view in this matter is extraordinarily firm.
 Even if the U.S.A. imperialists invade China, even if they start "special
 warfare", "local warfare", or a great war, or step up the war to still
 larger extent, we won't change this firm, revolutionary standpoint of ours.
 Long live the victory......
 QUESTION:  Comrade Lin Piao, in his work "Long Live Victory in the People's
 War", has pointed out the new course of the world revolution, from the
 rural areas in the world, that is the less developed countries, towards
 the cities of the world, that is West Europe and the U.S.A.  We would like
 you to explain the consequences of this new course for the situation of the
 Western European proletariats and the United States, also the consequences
 for the revolutionary movement in these parts of the world.
 ANSWER:  We see Western Europe and the United States as the world's big
 cities.  The Asian, African, and Latin American states resemble the vast
 rural area which devours the large cities.
 It is known to all the nations of the world that the riches in New York
 and Washington have been accumulated by exploitation of the rural areas
 of the world, that is, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  Money and property
 have been accumulated from the Asian, African, and Latin American nations
 and the rural area in the United States has also been exploited.  This is
 unreasonable.   Therefore, the nations ought to rise in rebellion to surround
 the city.   This is comrade Lin Piao's opinion.   It implies a development
 of Chairman Mao Tse-tung's Marxistic-Leninist.ic   view and also the view of
 Lenin.   Lenin once said that the European capitalism has been developed by
 exploitation of the millions of masses of people of the Asiatic, African,
 and Latin American nations.   This is the reason why the capitalists in
 Western Europe and the United States can train workers to become aristo-
 cratic.   It is in connection with this viewpoint that we build our strategy,
 which is completely correct.   But the imperialists are trying to create
 discord, they pretend that comrade Lin Piao wants to oppose the labour
 movement, the revolutionary movement in Europe and the United States - this
 is a venomous attack.

 The U.S.A. imperialists mobilized the [American] people during the two
 last wars to fight the imperialists in Europe.  The American nation
 fought in this matter.  But this time, the third time, we notice an ex-
 ception:                  the people have now risen in rebellion to fight their own
 country's imperialism   this is a very important world event.  That the
 U.S.A. imperialists now realize that it is impossible to mobilize their
 own people in the Vietnam war like they did during World War I and World
 War II and the Korean war.. .this is a new, very important phase in the
 development.
 Today we have the power in China and there is real unity between the
 Government and the people.   But yet, to fight imperialism, build up
 socialism and eliminate the left-overs from capitalism we must still
 mobilize young people who will unite with the farmers and workers.   This
 is the basic strategy of Marxism-Leninism:; here the implication is to
 change the conditions of exploitation and the difference between country
 and city.   In order to be able to seize governmental power, the revolu-
 tionaries must, during the revolutionary period, rely on the majority of
 the population.  Once this problem is solved we must still rely on the
 broad masses of workers, farmers, and soldiers.
 QUESTION:   What is your attitude in regard to Castro's anti-Chinese
 statements?
 ANSWER:  When Castro had finished his statement, he expressed deep dis-
 satisfaction with the fact that he received our answer through a lower-
 grade official in the Department of Commerce.   We chose to do so after
 several discussions;  Castro's attack was extremely unreasonable and in-
 sulting - it would have been inappropriate for the Prime Minister, and
 also for me as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to answer his slander.
 We will arrays support the great revolution of the Cuban people against
 the Batista domination.   In the same way we also support the Cuban people
 in the battle against the U.S.A.'s imperialism - irrespective of whatever
 mistakes the Cuban leaders will make, irrespective of however anti-Chinese
 they will be.  The Cuban leaders will never succeed in establishing discord
 between the Chinese and Cuban nations.
 What kind of technical, military, political and industrial aid has China
 given to Cuba?  Plenty of aid and it is free of charge.   Castro knows this
 very well.  I also know it but won't discuss it here.  If necessary, we
 will in the future publish certain documents in order to get a fair Judge-
 ment.   The time has not yet come for publication.
 Concerning the Pope....
 Let the Cuban leaders participate in the anti-Chinese activity!   Let
 them make all kinds of anti-Chinese statements - the more violent, the
 oftener, the more exaggerated - the better!   Now the U.S.A. imperialists
 and the Soviet revisionists cooperate in the great campaign against new

 China, against Mao Tse-tung.   It is good that there is large participation.
 The addition of a Castro doesn't frighten us, we welcome it.   Let them
 unite and devote themselves to anti-Chinese activity - we will leave them
 alone, we won't answer, we will leave them alone!   Today Johnson, Rusk,
 McNamara, Wilson, Kosygin, Malinowsky, even my former friend, "His Ex-
 cellency" Tito, also Mrs. Gandhi in India, are making a violent attack
 against China.   China is attacked every day by the Voice of America.   Con-
 cerning the Pope in the Vatican, I don't know whether he makes anti-
 Chinese statements; I feel and hope, however, that the Pope will also join
 the anti-Chinese activities and willingly lead them.  Let him lead with
 his cross.  As a matter of fact it is true that the more engagement there
 is in anti-Chinese activity, the more the workers, farmers and revolution-
 ary intellectuals all over the world will sympathize with China.  The day
 when the White House in the U.S.A., Whitehall in Great Britain, and the
 Kremlin no longer try to destroy us but give us medals and Nobel prizes will
 be a tragedy for China.   It would mean that we were no longer revolutionary.
 Who then would like to come to Peking?  Who then would be interested in
 China?  Therefore, we think it would be better to be destroyed by these
 people than to reach such a result.
 According to what your hosts have said our friends from Sweden are not so
 much interested in sightseeing as in political studies and discussions -
 that is, really to find out something about China.   Personally, I very much
 admire your revolutionary spirit and that's why I talk with you now.    If
 at some time ih the future you were to find that the Chinese Minister of
 Foreign Affairs no longer is prepared to talk with regular revolutionary
 visitors but prefers to spend his time in clubs, bars, and earning money,
 I am sure you would be very disappointed.
 I don't want Castro to steal more of our precious time.   Therefore, I can
 only say this:  we can'see that the foreign press says that Castro is
 turning against China because he is acting on orders from Moscow.  I am
 pot in a position to decide whether this is correct or not, for Castro has
 not authorized me to serve as his spokesman.   But I want to pose the
 following question:   is this problem concerned with taking orders from
 Moscow?  Is it only a problem of whether Castro is willing to choose the
 road of socialism, of Marxism-Leninism?  No, there is also another problem
 to which I want to direct my friends' attention.  We all know that the
 U.S.A. imperialists hate China above everything.  They explain that China
 is the U.S.A.'s enemy Number One.   The fact that Castro now appears and
 shows himself to be in opposition to China denotes a gesture to the U.S.A.
 The cultural revolution
 QUESTION:  What does the Cultural Revolution imply?
 ANSWER:  Our friends have posed the question of the Cultural Revolution
 and I will be very happy to answer it.  As the Cultural Revolution started
 in the cultural field, we call it the Cultural Revolution.  As a matter of

 fact it touches upon all aspects of life in the new China.   It is a
 political revolution, not only a cultural one.  We destroy four old things
 and build up four new ones.  We are destroying old ideology, old culture,
 old tradition and the old style of life.  This, however, is not sufficient
 to express what we imply with the Cultural Revolution.  The goal of the
 Cultural Revolution is to destroy the capitalistic system to the foundation,
 to build up the socialistic system from the foundation.   This is a simple,
 yet comprehensive answer.  The Chinese Communist party and the Chinese
 working class seized the government in 1949; shortly after that the first
 five-year-plan began.   Successively the capitalistic system has been re-
 placed by the socialistic one.  According to our view we must, after hav-
 ing established socialism, that is after the Communist party and the work-
 ing class have seized the government, continue to develop the socialistic
 system.   Even though we have reached a certain success we must force the
 development further on, establish the socialistic system on a yet"higher
 level.    We must never-permit a return to capitalism.
 We have learnt from the Soviet Union example.  We have learnt what is best
 from the Soviet Union, not only from the positive aspects but also from
 the negative ones.   In the Soviet Union they have carried out more than
 40 years of socialistic build-up, but: now the revisionists are introducing
 a capitalistic system instead of continuing forward toward communism.  By
 the great Cultural Revolution, workers, farmers, young students and sub-
 ordinate cadres in various positions get the opportunity to practice a
 comprehensive democracy with the right to participate directly in the
 governmental rule.  At the universities we combine the broad masses of
 revolutionary professors, students, members of the staff' and workers, to
 manage the universities.  We don't send any secretaries from any party
 committee to work there.  The method used at the universities will also
 be used within the many departments.   The masses of members of the personnel
 within the institutions mentioned will have the right to demand that any
 one of their chiefs, even ministers, be dismissed, and can demand that the
 central government send a minister of the people's own choice.
 Why should I in particular be a minister?
 Johnson ought to be dismissed as the president of the United States.   The
 American people don't have this right.  To judge from the Great Cultural
 Revolution in China it seems as if a group of ministers ought to be re-
 moved.   Concerning me myself, whether I will be moved or not, that news
 you will hear when you get home.  I can continue to serve the people as
 a member of a people's commune or as a factory worker.  Why should I in
 particular be a minister?  Why not a farmer, or a regular worker?  Why is
 it that I can only be an officer but not a common soldier?  Why can I only
 lead others but not be led by others?  It is inside and outside a bourgeois
 philosophy which must be destroyed to the foundation.   If you come :here
 in a few years and I have been transferred and am a regular member of the
 commune, then you can ask your hosts to see me and I will receive you.
 This cultural revolution is a revolution which touches upon all aspects
 of life.  A political, industrial, economic, military and agricultural

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060004-9
 revolution.   The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture will
 be moved away from Peking and the same thing will happen to several other
 Ministries.   To let these ministries remain in Peking will only serve the
 development of bureaucracy.  All these thousands and again thousands of
 functionaries wbo work within  the government departments - what they
 ought to do is to devote themselves to the real practical knowledge of
 how to build the front lines.  What they ought to do is to travel directly
 to the factories, to the villages, to the real battle fronts.
 But then I have still an unsolved problem, namely, where should this
 Foreign Ministry be placed?  In the factories?  There is no diplomatic
 work there.  In the villages?  There is no diplomatic work there either.
 Should we then drive out all the ministries from Peking and only let the
 Foreign Ministry remain?  Is this quite fair? ...I have considered and
 will tell my friends what my thoughts are deep down.   The Foreign Ministry
 can't be in a village, nor at a place like Sinkiang.   It can only be in
 Peking, otherwise the foreigners couldn't find us.   But I have discovered
 another possibility:   let the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vice Minister
 of Foreign Affairs, and all the civil servants spend at least four months
 a year in a factory.   Socialistic and capitalistic countries have one
 thing in common namely that the people often prefer to live in the cities
 instead of the rural areas.   People also prefer intellectual work to manual
 work - manual work is also harder than intellectual work.  This creates a
 small number of people in the society who are living a rather pleasant
 life while the great majority are living a comparatively hard life.  The
 aim and goal of the Great Cultural Revolution is to reduce the difference
 between the city and the country, to reduce the difference between workers
 and farmers on one side, intellectuals on the other.  Its purpose is to
 give the governmental power as well as the cultural power to the masses
 of workers, farmers and soldiers.
 So-called authorities and experts
 In this connection some people fear that the level of our science and
 technique will be lowered, but such a fear is without foundation.  We
 must try to see clearly; in a capitalistic country or in a revisionistic
 one like the Soviet Union, a small number of people have a monopoly on
 science and technique.   They consist of some thousands or tens of thousands.
 Here we give science and technique to hundreds of millions of people.   In
 this way the development of science and technique must proceed much faster,
 the level won't be lowered.
 Chinese cultural life has been characterized by the different branches of
 science having been monopolized by a smaller group of so-called authorities
 and experts.  Articles and documents written within their branch of science
 are not permitted to be published without being approved by them.   These
 people nowadays produce nothing themselves, they don't teach, they only sit
 at home and fetch their high salaries.   If they have to write some article,
 they ask the third or fourth-year students to write in their place.   But
 they publish the article in their own name and keep the money themselves.

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060004-9
 This is altogether a capitalistic exploitation within the cultural life.
 Now we tell these people:  "You have already earned a sufficient amount
 of money, now the time has come to rest a while.  Let the young people who
 really teach, really write and do research, let them take over."  This is
 something we are all happy about.  Now there are dozens of ministries and
 committees in Peking.   Some of its ministers don't write any petitions
 or documents any more, don't any longer give any directives.   That is,
 such work is done by their subordinates, all the ministers do is to sign.
 To such ministers we say:   "Now the time has come to rest for a while."
 Let these return to the back lines, and let those who now work in the
 back lines move up to the front lines.  This can save a great deal of
 money for the government and the working efficiency will be much higher.
 The problem is posed already in this room.   The future foreign ministers
 will be young people, they will speak to you,-directly in English or French,
 then there will be no need for interpreters.   A four-hour-discussion now
 will mean an eight-hour-discussion then.   The young people are more competent
 than we who are older.  We older people ought to create developmental
 possibilities for the young to develop, we mustn't stand in their way.
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung has said:   "This is a great revolution which touches
 the people's souls."  These words are true.  Each private person has to
 clarify his attitude toward this revolution:  whether he is for it and march-
 ing onward or whether he will be in the way and be conquered.  As the Chinese
 population represents one fourth of humanity, this revolution certainly
 will have a great influence on world progress.  The movement how has been in
 progress for a couple of months and will continue.  It is probable that various
 errors and shortcomings will ensue during the course of the movement - it is
 unreasonable to demand that everything will proceed properly in the beginning.
 Nor is it anything to be afraid of.   During a revolutionary course the errors
 will by degrees be self-corrective.
 Interest in relics
 Tourists from the West, diplomatic envoys from various Asiatic and African
 countries and various Western 'diplomats are always very interested in
 things which have to do with the old China.  They are very interested in
 antique culture, in antique social structure, in old relics, in jade
 products, old pictures and paintings.  Such things they esteem highly.
 They are not especially interested in anything modern in China,  They
 h,Pq deep down that the old China will remain as it is, that China will
 be a conservative China.   They are very afraid that China will be modern-
 ized, that China will surpass the European countries, surpass the capital-
 ist countries, surpass the revisionist Soviet Union, carry through real
 socialistic modernization on the way toward communism.  This is the China
 they fear most of all, and they are very unhappy about the situation of
 today.  For us ourselves the fact is that we are not so interested in the
 old things in China.  Without hesitation we walk the road of the revolution,
 the road of social modernization.  The Chinese feudal culture, irrespective
 of however splendid and beautiful it may seem, was a culture used to oppress

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060004-9
 and lead the people astry.   Therefore, it must be removed to its core.
 Famous poets during the Tang and Sung dynasties really were great poets,
 their works are among the best in the world as to beauty.  But yet,
 however we twist and turn, these poets are only running errands for kings
 and emperors, generals and so-called heros.  They don't sing the praise
 of the workers and the soldiers.  As a matter of fact they often laugh
 derisively at workers and soldiers.  Therefore, we can't encourage the
 development of such poetry.  We can only use this poetry as reference
 material.  We, the Chinese people, are certain that we will create great
 lyrical poetry for ourselves and the people of the nations in the world,
 epoch-making poems which will contribute to the development of the world.
 The history of humanity progresses.  We ought to rise to a new level,
 hig13er than that of our ancestors.  It is a common task for this generation,
 for our young friends present as well as for me.  If we only live within
 the old frame, refer to the slogans of the old culture, then we are in
 a bad way.  People like us are useless if we don't surpass our ancestors.
 We'ought,to avow this heroic striving to surpass our ancestors and bring
 world culture to a new and higher level.  This is yet another interpreta-
 tion of the Cultural Revolution now in progress.

 FRAGA: Vilken inst5fining liar ni till Castros anti-kine-
 niska uttafanden?                ?
 SVAR- Etter att Castro gjort silt uttalande, uttrycktc han
 djup otillfredsstai!clse over dct faktum act vi svarade lto-
 norn genom en age tjansteman i handelsdepartementct.
 Vi valde an gore sill efter Vera bverliiggttingar; Castros an-
 grcpp var ytterst oruniigt och lid nkande - det skittle lia
 v:arit okinipligt fiir premiarministern, avers for tnig som
 nitikesntimster, act hesvara bans fortal.
 Vi komIner alltid att stodja det kubanska folkets stora
 revolution mot 1latistas hcrrava.lde. 1'S saunma salt stoder
 vi ocksi de tva rcvolutionara Havanna.-deklarationerna.
 Det at mojligt act de amerikanska imperialisterna kommer
 act angripa Kuba. I s5 fall stoder vi ovillkorligt Kubas
 folic a kampen mot USA-imperialismen - oavsett vilka
 inisstag de kubanskai ledarna gor, oavsett hur antikinesiska
 de konurter att vars. De kubanska ledarna lyckas aldrig
 aitadkomtna splittring mellan de kinesiska och kubanska
 foiken.
 Vad lair slags teknisk, tnilitar, politisk och industricll hjilp
 har Kina givit Kuba? Massor tried hjalp och den err kost-
 nadsir:i.  Detta vet Castro mycket val. Jag vet ocks5,
 men ska inte diskutera det har. I fall deL blir nodvandigt
 -a-miner vi i fratntide:n att obfentliggora handlingar for
 qtr f5 en rattvis bediimning. Tidpunkten err annu inte inne
 for offentliggorande.
 Vad betraffar Pavers ...
 1.5t de kubanska ledarna to deli i den anti-kinesiska vcrk-
 samhcten! Lit dent komnta tried alla slags anti-kinesiska
 p,istacnden - ju v5ldsamutarc., ju oftarc, ju mer over-
 drivna -- desto battre! Nu samarbetar USA-iruperialis-
 tcrna och Sovjetrevisionisterna i den stora kampa ijen
 ntot nya Kina, mot Mao Tse-tung. Det 5r bra lied stort
 dsltagandc. Till6kningen rued en Castro skrinuner oss
 lute, vi valkoninar den. Lit dcm gig samutatn och hiitrge
 sig at anti-kincsisk vcrksamhet --- vi larnnar deco, vi svarar
 into, de far h5llas! I dag gar Johnson, Rusk, blcNarnara,
 Wilson, Kosygin, Nlalinowski, liven min force van )Ohaus
 exccllcnsb Tito, treks! Mrs Gandhi i Indicn, tilt vtid.saurt
 angrepp root Kina. Kina attackeras varje deg av Voice
 of America. Vad bctriiffar pavcn i Vatikanen k:inner jag
 lute till huruvida hen avger anti-kinesiska uualarrdeu. Vi
 hoppas einellertid act iven paven forenar sig i de anti-
 kinesiska aktiviteterna, och garna leder dent. IIau kan
 gi i spetsen med sid.kors.
 I sjiilva verket err dot s5, att ju mer man engagerar sig i
 anti-kinesisk  verksanthet, desto hugre  prestige kommcr
 Kina att rona, destu mer kornmer arbetare, bonder och
 rnvolutionira intellektuella i bola varlden att sympatiscra
 tried Kina. Den dagen der Vita Iluset i USA, Whitehall i
 Storbritannien och Krentl inte langre forsoker krossa oss,
 utan get medaljer- txh, skiinker oss nobclpris, konuner att
 vara en tragedi fair Kina. Detta. skulle innebira att vi irate
