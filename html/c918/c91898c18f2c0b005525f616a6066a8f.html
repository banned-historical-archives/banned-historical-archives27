 Priorities for Developing China's Computer Industry
 Summary
 During  1984, central  government and  local
 authorities      in China reorganized their computer
 resources to focus on microcomputer production and
 software development.                                                   Although the effort is
 intended to remedy the duplication of resources and
 lack of coordination that traditionally have plagued
 the Chinese computer industry, the proliferation of
 oversight organizations and multiple priorities may
 be worsening the problem.   China is concentrating on
 acquiring foreign microcomputer production
 technology as a way of achieving eventual  self-
 reliance in computers, but it continues to purchase
 some larger computer systems and other production
 technology from US, Japanese, and other foreign
 firms.   Software development is being heavily
 emphasized, particularly that related to Chinese
 language processing, as a key to broadening computer
 applications in China.
 Introduction
 Although development of computers and electronics has been a
 priority for China throughout this decade, high-level  interest in
 expanding the number and uses of computers increased
 This memorandum was prepared by                    of the Office of
 East Asian Analysis in response to a request      rom the Deputy
 Assistant Secretary for Trade Development, Department of
 Commerce.   Questions and comments are welcome and may be
 addressed to Chief, China Division,

 significantly in 1984.   At an April conference for coordinating
 development of computerization in China, Premier Zhao Ziyang said
 China must make a great effort to catch up with industrialized
 nations in the computer field.   Deng Xiaoping and Party Chairman
 Hu Yaobang subsequently spoke out on the importance of computer
 development to China's modernization effort.   Premier Zhao's
 interest reportedly was stimulated in part by Alvin Toffler's
 book, The Third Wave,  and its discussion of the importance of
 information technology to the post-industrial  society.   More
 generally, disappointing results from China's past efforts to
 develop its computer industry also led Beijing to reexamine its
 computer development efforts.   Overall, Chinese computer
 production has increased only slowly, has not been able to meet
 demand-  is of varying quality, and lacks standardization
 25X1            According to recent statements by Li Peng, head of the
 Leading Group for Invigoration of Electronics, China will  produce
 microcomputers as its main computer product, while also giving
 consideration to medium-sized and large computer models.   Greater
 attention will  also be given to the development of the software
 needed to apply computers to China's economic modernization.
 Beijing sees Chinese character information processing technology
 as the key to popularizing and applying foreign technology to
 China.   Although many of these priorities have been previously
 identified, Beijing apparently is hoping that centrally directed
 organizational changes and unified oversight will  lead to more
 successful implementation of its plans.                           25X1
 Organizing Domestic Computer Resources
 In late 1984, a Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI)
 official  said the Chinese computer industry consisted of 20
 developmental  institutes,  111 manufacturing facilities,  13
 service organizations,  and over 90,000 employees.   Less than half
 of these resources are believed to be under MEI control, with the
 remainder subordinate to municipalities and provinces.
 Additional electronics resources are subordinate to the several
 defense-related ministries.   Beijing, Guangzhou,  and Shanghai  are
 major centers of computer research and production.
 Both MEI and provincial authorities have given renewed
 attention to the organizations and policies governing computer
 development.   The MEI's China Computer Technical Service Company
 (CCTSC) has been increasingly active in promoting computer use
 and securing foreign cooperation in computer research and
 development.   Some provinces have established provincial  computer
 centers or provincial computer leading groups to plan
 microcomputer production, distribution,  and applications.
 Several locations have combined computer research and production
 units to facilitate transfer of research results, eliminate
 duplication of efforts and improve production.,  (See table for

 Shanghai, which produces roughly one-third of China's
 computers,  has made a particularly visible commitment to the
 priority development of its computer industry.   The municipality
 has formed a Leading Group for Computers and Large Scale
 Integrated Circuits and assigned responsibility for the
 development of electronics industry to two vice mayors.   In the
 spring of 1984 Shanghai created the Shanghai Computer Company to
 oversee computer research and development, production,  service,
 training and marketing for six of Shanghai's computer enterprises
 and established a similar organization to coordinate software
 development.
 All of these reorganization efforts are intended to promote
 greater coordination and more efficient use of resources, yet we
 believe the proliferation of oversight organizations may cause
 confusion.   The relationship of municipal organizations to
 oversight organizations at the ministerial or national  level
 (e.g., the MEI's Administration of Computer Industry or the
 Leading Group for the Invigoration of Electronics) is unclear.
 eve], contusion persists.   The Shanghai Computer Company, for
 example,  shares control over the Shanghai Computer Technology
 Research Institute with the Shanghai S&T Commission.   Moreover,
 the creation of oversight and marketing units has done little to
 dampen the competition between factories for computer production
 and sales.
 Popularizing Computers
 Beijing has initiated a series of educational efforts aimed
 at expanding "computer literacy," including sponsoring exhibits
 and holding conferences on computer applications in foreign
 trade,  industry,  and the military.   The State Economic Commission
 and the Chinese Association for Enterprise Management are running
 computer training courses for managers and factory directors.
 China is equipping more schools with computers and introducing
 computer courses for elementary and middle school children.
 Scientific associations have joined in popularizing computer
 knowledge among youths through national computer design contests
 and science camps, with prominent S&T officials participating in
 the ceremonies
 Provinces are also promoting microcomputer education and
 applications.   Heilingjiang Province, for example, has equipped
 some primary and middle schools as well  as research institutes
 with computers.   Liaoning Province subsidizes units that use or
 develop microcomputers and offers low-interest loans and tax
 breaks to units purchasing computer equipment.

 Applications
 China's goal  is to apply computers to a wide range of
 economic,  social, scientific,  government,  and industrial
 activities.   Microcomputers have been used in the textile,
 chemical metallurgical  and publishing industries,  as well  as for
 traffic control,  hotel management, medical  diagnostics,
 aeronautics research,  and even video introductions for singles at
 the Beijing Marriage Consulting Center.   The military is using
 microcomputers for training, operations, administration and
 management, rear services activities, war games training
 exercises,  and weapons control applications.
 Computer networks are being developed for national economic
 planning, management of S&T information, meteorological  uses,
 energy management and other purposes.   The military also appears
 keenly interested in networking applications.   For example,
 military related organizations have negotiated with Honeywell for
 joint development of a computer network based on the DPS-6
 minicomputer.   Despite claims that this network is for office
 applications, such a network would probably be used for command
 and control purposes or for China's strategic missile force.
 Networking applications in China are currently limited by lack of
 adequate telecommunications lines,  incompatible equipment,  and
 lack of equipment, experience and software.   Chinese emphasis on
 fiber optic communications for both long-haul  and local  digital
 transmission also indicates the growing significance of computer-
 to-computer interface.   A number of local  area networks                         (LANs)
 already are being established utilizing fiber optics.
 Domestic Production                                                        25X1
 Estimates of Chinese computer production and of China's
 computer inventory vary greatly,  although it is clear that both
 have increased significantly in the past two or three years.
 From production of 250 to 350 computers of all types in 1982,
 China reportedly produced between 3,700 and 5,400 microcomputers
 in 1983.   Some MEI officials claim China produced more than
 20,000 microcomputers in 1984, but we believe this number is
 inflated because official statistics indicate Shanghai--generally
 believed to produce one-third of China's computers--produced only
 about 3,000 micros in 1984.   Some Chinese officials put expected
 microcomputer production for 1985 at 30,000.   One Chinese
 official claimed in 1984 that China had a total  inventory of

 30,000 domestic and imported microcomputers, while foreign press
 estimated the number to be 57,000 microcomputers by the end of
 1984
 In our view, enthusiasm for developing the computer industry
 is causing Chinese officials to set unrealistic production
 goals.   A manager of the Shanghai Computer Factory, for example,
 said microcomputer production at the factory is to increase from
 several hundred per year in 1984 to 10,000 per year, even though
 assembly lines were not even partially automated.   Shenzhen
 special economic zone near Hong Kong, slated to become an
 important electronics base, hopes to produce 100,000
 microcomputers per year even though proposals for development are
 Many of the Chinese computer models reportedly under
 production in China may be prototypes.   Standardization of
 production is a major problem, as is obtaining high quality
 components. Chinese computers frequently are copies of foreign
 computers or rely on imports of important components such as
 microprocessors.   Western specialists have commented that
 Chinese-built computers are expensive, and often cost more than
 imported computers.
 Microcomputers.   Of the many Chinese models said to be under
 production, the Great Wall 100 and the BCM 3, both 16-bit
 machines, seem to be slated for mass production.
 Supercomputers.   According to Chinese press, China's Galaxy
 supercomputer was developed at the National Defense S&T
 University in Changsha and is capable of 100 million instructions
 per second (mips).   The effective speed of this computer, which
 we believe is probably devoted to military research,  is probably
 slower and its applications reportedly are limited by lack of
 software.   However, its development reveals Chinese familiarity
 with advanced computer architectures such as vector and parallel
 processing.   The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of
 Computer Technology in Beijing developed a dual processing
 machine--called the 757--which is capable of 10 mips.   This
 machine has been mistakenly identified as a supercomputer by some
 foreign visitors.   Ministry of Petroleum Industry officials also

 have been trying to obtain supercomputers from the US and France
 Acquisition of Foreign Equipment and Technology
 China has purchased or expressed interest in purchasing many
 types of computers and related peripheral equipment during the
 past year.   Recently, China has started buying large numbers of
 micro- and mini-computers at one time, sometimes  in a semi-
 knocked-down state for assembly in China.   Most purchases involve
 hardware and software training.
 Although many Chinese organizations negotiate for foreign
 computer purchases, apparently without central coordination, the
 governm?nt appears to control most computer purchases through
 import  licenses.   Organizations unable to obtain licenses, or
 lacking foreign exchange, have been forced to purchase equipment
 from other Chinese organizations, which resell  imported computers
 at vastly inflated prices.
 China's current attitude toward imported microcomputers
 seems ambivalent.   State Department officials reported that
 import licenses for microcomputers were particularly hard to
 obtain in late 1984.   In January 1985, China raised the import
 duty on small computers (under 32-bit) to between 50 and 70
 percent, which should further discourage microcomputer imports.
 On the other hand, on 6 March, China's General Administration of
 Customs announced a reduction of import duties on microchips and
 data processing equipment from 25 percent to between 6 and 9
 percent to aid the electronics industry and spread the use of
 microcomputers.   We suspect, but cannot be certain, that these
 reductions do not apply to small computers.   We continue to
 believe Beijing is tightening control of microcomputer imports
 primarily to force foreign firms to transfer production activity
 to China.   Conserving foreign exchange and protecting the
 domestic industry may be additional concerns.   At the same time,

 however, China probably recognizes that imports of some equipment
 will be necessary to meet the sizable pent-up demand for
 computers.
 Chinese acquisition of foreign production technology
 accelerated during 1984, and China will seek additional  Joint
 ventures in the future.
 The availability of computers in China has increased
 significantly, and these joint ventures will further increase the
 numbers of computers in China.   These agreements will take some
 time to reach their full potential, however.   A microcomputer
 production line imported from France in 1979 tegan production
 only in 1983.   Most of the foreign companies involved are
 planning, lona training and supervisory programs to ensure
 quality.

 Software
 China sees development of a strong software industry as both
 necessary to successful  application of computers in China and as
 an area in which China might succeed quickly.   The MEI, the State
 S&T Commission, and the Ministry of Education have each
 established new organizations to oversee software development, as
 has Shanghai.   These organizations are seeking foreign
 cooperation in developing China's software industry.   Several
 also are planning software exports.
 The MEI established the China Software Technical Company
 (CSTC)  in April 1984 to direct, coordinate, and evaluate the
 national effort to establish a modern software industry.   The
 objectives of the company are to reduce the duplication of effort
 in Chinese software research and to draw up a five-year plan to
 develop the software industry.   The company is to have a staff of
 120 professionals, with the budget reportedly more than US $50
 million over the next five years.   CSTC already has begun
 publishing a trade magazine, established a model  software
 factory, and set up the China Computer Software Association for
 sharing and distributing software throughout China.   CSTC
 officials have said they will hire foreign firms to assist in
 developing China's software industry, but these firms will
 eventually withdraw as China becomes self-sufficient.
 MEI's China Computer Technical Service Company (CCTSC) also
 devotes a major part of its efforts to the development of China's
 software industry and popularizing computer usage.   CCTSC
 cooperated with four foreign firms in setting up software
 research centers in China.   CCTSC researchers have also developed
 under contract an anti-earthquake software program for Japan, and
 in 1983 CCTSC signed a long-term contract with Nippon Electric
 Company (NEC) to produce software.
 The Ministry of Education consolidated its software
 research, development, and training units  into an inter-
 university software research center in March 1984.   The center
 will offer technical services to the government, military and
 industrial enterprises, make plans for software development,
 train software personnel and formulate standards for software
 research personnel.
 In addition, the State S&T Commission and other central
 government organs  in mid-1984 planned the establishment of two
 "world class" software development centers in Beijing and
 Shanghai.   The Beijing Center reportedly will specialize in
 software for microcomputers while the Shanghai center will work

 applications.   Each of the centers, estimated to cost $30 million
 for design and construction,  is intended to accommodate 1,000
 Officials in Shanghai  reorganized their software research
 and development units  into the Shanghai Software Technology
 Development Center, which is responsible for software R&D,
 production and management of software personnel and resources.

 Company in April  1984.   According to reporting, the new company,
 which has an operating budget of $60 million,  is supposed to

 Shanghai's Jiaotong University established the Nanyang
 International Technology Company as an auxilliary profit center
 in 1983 to produce software for export.   Nanyang has a contract
 with a US firm to develop software for the US market and is
 negotiating with several Japanese firms.   Nanyang engineers
 reportedly have developed domestic software packages for
 shipbuilding,  industrial process control, and computer-aided
 design applications, although to date their work for the US firm
 has been limited to software program conversions, spreadsheet
 A major focus of Chinese software research is on Chinese
 character processing systems, which are essential  if computers
 are ever to be widely used in China.   At an October 1983
 international conference on Chinese Information Processing in
 Beijing, Chinese specialists said over 200 methods for coding
 Chinese characters had been proposed by Chinese researchers, and
 over 20 were currently under development at various research
 centers.   An exhibition of Chinese character processing methods
 that same month revealed a handful of systems developed by
 Chinese researchers,most of which relied at least partially on
 imported components.   A system developed by the China Information
 applications and game packages.
 Research Institute reportedly is being used by a Hong Kong

 The Chinese expect  the software  industry  to progress more
 rapidly than the hardware  industry  in  part  because software
 relies more on personnel  and  intellectual  power than equipment.

 raining large numbers o  so   ware specialists quickly are
 probably optimistic.   A Vice Minister of Education in March 1984
 claimed China had 10,000 software specialists and said China
 would have over 100,000 specialists by 1990.   Some Western
 observers  believe China currently has  a  surplus of computer  power
 because  it  lacks  the personnel and  the know-how to use
 effectively the computers already on hand.
 Other problems also exist.   The head of the Shanghai
 Software Technology Development Center told Western visitors the
 development effort suffers from a shortage of systems engineers
 and the lack of software tools such as high-level editors and
 microprocessor development systems.   China would like to import
 computer hardware that will  allow it to tailor software packages
 to specific operating systems, but it continues to run into
 problems in obtaining US export licenses.
