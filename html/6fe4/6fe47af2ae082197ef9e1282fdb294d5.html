 THE SING-SOVIET DISPUTE
 INTER.-PARTY DEVELOPMENTS AT AND AFTER THE
 RUMANIAN WORKERS PARTY CONGRESS--BUCHAREST, 20-25 JUNE 1960
 The background of the dispute (1957-1960)
 1.  The present dispute between the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union (CPSU) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) has
 its origins in differences which date back at least three years-
 .that is, to the.summer of 1957.  On the Chinese side, antecendent
 resentments may date as far back as the formative period of the
 CPC in the twenties, when Stalin?s policy of alliance with the
 Kuomintang drove the CPC to disaster, as well as to the war and
 early post-war period, when Soviet support for the Chinese Com--
 munist cause was minimal and did not inhibit the stripping of
 Manchuria.  There is clearly no single cause for the current
 dispute.  Rather, it would appear, an accumulation of Chinese
 policies and actions increasingly displeased and challenged
 Khrushchev and, presumably, a majority of the Soviet leadership.
 In the field of domestic policy, it is nowhnown that Mao's "Let
 a.hundred flowers bloom" program aroused Soviet doubts about
 its usefulness.  The program for the "great leap forward"
 beginning in early 1958 and the communes program, adopted by
 the CPC in May 1958, were readily recognizable as a considerable
 irritant in Sino-Soviet relations by the silent treatment which
 they received in the Soviet Union.
 2.  Disagreement over foreign policy manifested itself in
 August 1958 when Khrushchev, after four days of discussion with
 Mao Tse-tung, publicly rejected, on 5 August, Western proposals
 for a summit meeting within the U. N, Security Council on the
 crisis in the Middle East--proposals which he had accepted in
 July.  Nevertheless, on 23 August the Chinese began shelling of
 the off-shore islands.  On 23 May 1958 the Commander of the
 Chinese' lair Force paiedicted that China would make atomic bombs
 "in the not too distant future" and the Chinese press ceased to

 refer to Khrushchev's earlier plan for an atom-free zone in
 Asia.  Khrushchev revived his concept of an atom-free ?done
 for "the Far East and the entire Pacific Basin" at the 21st
 CPSU Congress in February 1959.  Chinese reactions were
 not enthusiastic, and, from April 1959, on, reference to the
 plan disappeared altogether.  In the light of these and other
 indications, it can be fairly assumed that Soviet unwillingness
 to deliver atomic weapons to Chinese control had become a
 serious issue.  It is now known that the Soviets cited as the
 reason for their reluctance their apprehension over Chinese
 policies and pronouncements in the external field which were
 in conflict with Khrushchev's "peaceful coexistence" tactics,
 which affirmed that global or limited war need not be avoided,
 and which objected to Khrushchev's aid programs for "bourgeois"
 regimes in underdeveloped countries on the grounds that they
 would delay revolution.  Chinese objections to peaceful coexistence
 tactics manifested themselves after 1957 in the deliberations of
 the International Communist Front organizations, especially
 within the World Peace Council and the International Union of
 Students--two organizations which were  lost directly and in-
 tensely engaged in building their appeal on the unity campaign
 so typical of the peaceful coexistence period.  They desired to
 involve bourgeois and nationalist groups in mass action and
 therefore advocated informal conversations, negotiations,
 and concessions to such groups.  The Chinese refused to "sit
 around the table" with them except in formal meetings of
 designated representatives, and resisted Soviet efforts to
 broaden the scope of concessions on program and organization
 questions.  Chinese resistance was particularly manifest after
 the Soviet decision of June 1959 concerning Khrushchev's visit
 to the United States.
 3.  In August 1959, the Chine-se overran the Indian border
 post at Longju and reopened the border dispute v4tlkIndia, after
 eight years of quiet.  The Soviet position on this dispute signifi-
 cantly failed to give full endorsement to the Chinese claims,
 although earlier Chinese repressive actions in Tibet had been

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 promptly supported as just and as an "internal affair. "
 Khrushchev, as was known later, did not interpret the reopening
 of the dispute as a mere attempt to register opposition to his
 trip to the United States, but as an un-Marxist blunder which
 needlessly undermined Indian neutralist attitudes and potential
 value in the peace and disarmament campaign and impaired the
 appeal of CP India.  When Khrushchev visited Peiping, after
 his trip to the United States, for the October anniversary cele-
 brations in 1959, the Sino-In&.an dispute was one topic of discussion
 and it is virtually certain that Khrushchev presented his views on
 improving USSR-U.S. relations.  Sino-Soviet discussions were
 unsatisfactory, however, and no communique was published.'
 According to three widely separated and reliable sources, in
 October 1959 the CPSU sent a letter to at least the bloc parties,
 holding fast to Khrushchev's views on USSR-U. S. relations.
 In November 1959, V. Ilyitchev, Chief of the Agitprop Department
 of the CPSU, published an article in Problems of Peace and
 Socialism that justified the policy of peaceful coexistence as eblass
 struggle on the international plane" and significantly noted Lenin's
 criticism of "Left Communists. "  It is mown that the Chinese
 have since been accused of criticizing the November 1959 joint
 program of the European parties, which is clearly based upon
 the same premises as the article.  In December 1959, Khrushchev
 warned the Chinese in stating at the Hungarian Party Congress
 that "we must all synchronize our watches."
 4.  In January 1960, the Chinese positions hardened.  At
 the Rome meeting of the Presidential Committee of the World
 Peace Council in January 1960 it transpired that the Chinese
 had charged the USSR with seeking to isolate China in the
 interest of achieving a modus vivendi with the U. S.  A reliable
 source states that the USSR in January 1960 informally broached
 to the Chinese the idea that the Sino-Soviet differences required
 discussion, only to be told by the Chinese that the differences
 were between the parties and should not be mentioned.  The
 CPC appears to have reached during January important decisions
 which had a major effect on the dispute.  On 21 January the

 Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted
 a resolution concerning disarmament which specified that
 China would be bound only by treaties it takes part in framing;
 and in February 1960, at the meeting of the foreign ministers
 of the Warsaw Pact countries, the Chinese observer, K'ang
 Sheng, incorporated the statement in his speech, broadening
 it to include "all international agreements. "  The contrast
 between the descriptions of the world situation in K'ang Sheng's
 speech and those given by the European bloc speakers was
 striking.
 5.  It is at this point that the 1957 Moscow declaration
 first began to be quoted to support the conflicting positions,
 when the People's Daily of 6 February 1960 asserted that "the
 development of the international situation has borne out the
 correctness of the declaration." It appears likely, therefore,
 that the Chinese decided in late January to take the initiative
 in broadening the debate.  But also on 6 February a verbal
 message from the Central Committee of the CPSU asking the
 CPC to attend a meeting to discuss outstanding problems was
 reportedly delivered in Peiping.
 6.  In mid-April 1960 the Chinese took advantage of the
 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth to make their most serious
 public attack on the theoretical innovations developed by the
 CPSU at and after the 20th Party Congress in January 1956.
 Using oblique but unmistakable arguments, the Chinese
 challenged the premises underlying Soviet foreign policy and
 by implication disparaged Khrushchev's stature as a Communist
 theorist.  The Chinese attack comprised three major statements:
 two articles in the party's theoretical monthly Red Flag (issues
 no. 7 and 8, 1 and 16 April), the first entitled "On Imperialism
 as the Source of War in Modern Times" and the second entitled
 "Long Live Leninism, " as well as an editorial on 22 April in
 the authoritative newspaper, the People's Daily.

 7.  The Soviets replied in the speech delivered in Moscow
 on 22 April by Otto Kuusinen of the CPSU Central Committee and
 Secretariat.  A very strong defense of current Soviet foreign
 :policy and of the general lines endorsed at the 20th and 21st
 CPSU Congresses, his speech confined its critical comments
 to general statements condemning "dogmatic positions as back-
 ward positions." On the same day a Chinese Politburo alternate,
 Lu Ting-i, gave a speech in Peiping which incorporated many
 of the arguments of the "Long Live Leninism" article.  The
 divergences between the two speeches were so great that when
 one Communist party seriously affected by the dispute, the
 Indian party, published both speeches side by side in the 8 May
 issue of its newspaper N!   Are, without comments, its action
 aroused considerable comment and created confusion among
 party members.
 8.  The Chinese then began to carry their case to the
 other parties.  "Long Live Leninism, " the Lu Ting-i speech,
 and the People's Daily editorial of 22 April were translated
 and published in the widely circulated English language Peking
 Review of 26 April.  At the same time, the first edition of
 a book containing the three articles was produced by the
 Foreign Languages Press in Peiping in many languages for
 distribution abroad. Two further editions of this book were
 produced, one in May and the other, after the Bucharest
 confrontations, in August.  The book is known to exist in
 English, Spanish, French, the Eastern European languages
 (including Russian), and Vietnamese.  It has been distributed
 in India and in certain countries at least of Latin America
 and Western Europe.  It appears that the Chinese later at-
 tempted to circulate the articles in the USSR in one of their
 two Russian language publications, Druzhba, an action which
 the Soviets protested.  The magazine was in fact suspended
 from circulation in the USSR after the publication of the June
 issue.  Earlier instances of Soviet refusals to circulate
 Chinese doctrinal writings in the USSR have recently been
 reported by reliable sources, who heard the details during
 party discussions of the Sino-Soviet differences.

 9.  After the Kuusinen rebuttal of Chinese charges, the
 CPSU took advantage of the 40th anniversary of the publication
 of Lenin's book Leftwing Communism, an Infantile Disorder
 (10 June 1960) to carry the public ideological debate with the
 Chinese to new heights, including the use of the charge of
 "deviation."  Two Soviet articles published on 10 June, one
 by D. Shevlyagin in the newspaper Soviet Russia and one by
 N. Matkovsky in the party newspaper Pravda, expressed this
 criticism by attacking "contemporary left-wing deviationism"
 in terms which referred to the positions held by the Chinese
 party.  Both articles highlighted the significance of the 12
 Party Declaration of November 1957.  Matkovsky characterized
 it as a "programmatic document of the international Communist
 movement, " and as a validation of the general line expressed
 by the CPSU.  Shevlyagin, one-the other hand, referred parti-
 cularly to the declaration as authorizing and requiring a struggle
 against "leftist opportunism" as well as against "rightist
 opportunism" such as that of the Yugoslavs.  In discussing
 manifestations of left opportunism he made the significant
 point that " ntyonly groups of Communists but the leadership
 of individual parties have veered into leftist deviationism."
 Neither of the articles explicitly identified the Chinese as
 the target of criticism, but their relevance to the dispute
 was unmistakable.
 10.  The timing of this intensification of the Soviet attack
 on the Chinese views coincides with a CPSU letter on the
 Summit Conference which was circulated, shortly after
 Khrushchev's return home following the collapse of the con-
 ference, to the Communist parties of the bloc and those of
 France and Italy.  Although the text of this letter is not
 available, it seems likely to have been unacceptable to the
 Chinese, Who emphasized from mid-May on that the course
 of events before and at Paris proved the validity of the
 Chinese arguments concerning imperialism and the illusory
 and fruitless character of negotiation.  Perhaps the worst
 offense of the Chinese, in Soviet eyes, was their argument
 6

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200240005-7
 that the only value of Communist participation in such peace
 negotiations was the purely tactical advantage that came out
 of their eventual exposure of the true character and intentions
 of the enemy.  This observation was precisely the kind of
 statement which the CPSU was most eager to avert.
 11.  It is likely too that the CPSU decided at this time
 to send a sharp letter ofd criticism to the CPC.  One
 prominent Free World Communist who visited Moscow in
 late May stated that he learned from a member of the CPSU
 Secretariat that a "sharp" letter was being sent to the CPC.
 CPSU letters calling for a conference vAre reportedly sent to
 the Chinese on 2 Ju'1e and on 7 June, and it appears likely that
 the letter of 2 June 4was the "sharp" one.  It is also worth
 noting that the CPC leaders went into closed conference in
 Shanghai on 8 June, a move which may well have been prompted
 by the receipt of the two CPSU letters.  They were in fact still
 meeting when the Chinese delegation left for the Bucharest
 party congress.
 12.  The Chinese too made a major move in the now
 rapidly developing dispute.  They did this in early June at the
 XIth General Council meeting of the World Federation of
 Trade ? Unions in Peiping., On 2 June they presented an ultimatum
 on the official WFTU report to the chief Soviet representative,
 who rejected it.  The Chinese claimed that the report contained
 objectionable features, including attacks on the communes.
 At this meeting, which opened on 5 June after a five-day delay,
 in the presence of both WFTU affiliates and representatives
 of some twenty-five unaffiliated national trade union federations,
 the leading Chinese figures Chou En-lai, Liu Shao-ch'i, Liu
 Ningri, Teng Hsiao-ping, and Liu Chang-sheng publicized
 the Chinese views on the peace struggle, tke threat of imperialism,
 and the "illusions" aroused by the campajgns for peaceful co-
 existence and by programs for giving substantial economic aid
 to bourgeois-led underdeveloped countries.  Using a tactic they
 had employed earlier in April, the Chinese leaders accompanied

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200240005-7
 those criticisms with fulsome expressions of approval of
 the Soviet posture towards the U. S. at the time of the
 collapse of the Summit Conference.  This approval of the
 Soviet actions was accompanied by expressions of solidarity
 with the USSR in its stand against U.S. acts of aggression.
 It was learned that the CPSU was particularly stung by the
 speeches of Liu Ning-yi and Liu Chang-sheng.
 13.  When the Chinese convened a private meeting of
 Communist party members among the delegates to hear a
 statement of the Chinese criticisms of CPSU doctrines, rep-
 resentatives of the CPSU promptly opposed the continuation
 of the talks and made the ominous charge that the Chinese
 action was violation of the terms of the 12 Party Declaration
 of November 1957.  This Soviet appeal to the authority of
 the Moscow declaration paralleled the similar appeal in the
 Shevlyagin article published in Moscow, and the charge has
 since figured prominently in the CPSU's presentation of its
 case.  According to credible reports, during the WFTU session
 Teng Hsiao-ping, general secretary of the CPC, accused
 the CPSU in turn of "throwing the Moscow declaration over-
 board. "
 14.
 Soviet representatives in Peiping not only criticized the Chinese
 actions in  eri"e i ldiscussions with foreign Communist rep-
 resentatives but by 9 June took concrete steps to enlist the
 support of other CP?s against the Chinese.  The representative
 of one Free World CP was told, by a representative of the
 Soviet All Union Central Council of Trade Unions, that the
 Soviet embassy in Peiping was interested in knowing if he
 could stop over in Moscow after the end of the conference.
 15.  When a group of European and African delegates to
 the WFTU meeting arrived in Moscow on 13 June, a number
 of CPSU officials conferred with members of this group.  One
 of the delegates in the group is known to have talked privately
 with a top official, V. Tereshkin, of the CPSU Foreign
 Section, concerning the Sino-Soviet dispute.  The delegate was

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 informed of the interpretation the CPSU placed on recent
 Chinese actions, and Tereshkin asked that he have a plenum
 of his party's central committee convened after his return
 home to discuss the Chinese at Peiping and to condemn them
 as violations of the Moscow declaration.  A second person,
 tentatively identified as L. I. Brezhnev, chairman of the
 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, was also reported present
 at this meeting.  According to a statement broadcast while
 the Bucharest congress was in session, representatives of
 the French and Spanish Communist parties held a meeting
 on 14 and 15 June, at which they reaffirmed their adherence
 to the 12 Party Declaration.  Because the leadership of both
 these parties was represented in the group of WFTU delegates
 in Moscow at this time, it appears possible that the meeting
 in question took place there and that the reaffirmation was
 a reaction to the Peiping events.
 16.  In contrast to these cryptic endorsements of the
 Moscow declaration, on 19 June 1960 a statement by Agostino
 Novella, a leading Italian Communist and president of the
 WFTU, was published in the Italian Party newspaper Unita.
 In this statement, which was also broadcast in Italian from
 Czechoslovakia on 20 June, Novella described the Chinese
 criticism of the resolutions proposed at the WFTU Council
 meeting in Peiping and, like the 10 June Soviet articles,
 characterized the Chinese views as "deviations. "   So far as
 can be determined, this was the first instance in which a
 Free World Communist party publicized this charge against
 the Chinese.  The appearance of the statement coincided
 with the opening of the 3rd Congress of the Rumanian
 Workers Party in Bucharest, where the next phase of the
 dispute developed.
 The Nucharest debates (20-27 June 1960)
 17.  The Chinese determination to press at Bucharest
 for Soviet adoption of a militant line is suggested by an

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 article in the 16 June issue of Red Flag, which, in an obvious
 reference to the CPSUts earlier justification of its views on
 peace and peaceful coexistence, observed that 'tone cannot
 separate oneself from the revisionists merely by stating that
 the forces of socialism predominate over the forces of
 imperialism."  The Chinese delegation to the congress of
 the Rumanian Workers Party stopped in Moscow for an
 exchange of views on 17 June.  It presented a letter from the
 CPC which limited its powers to agreeing on a date for a
 party conference to discuss Sino-Soviet differences and ex-
 changing views, without, however, adopting any formal
 resolution,  The CPSU representatives were not successful
 in obtaining an admission from the Chinese delegation of
 the errors of the CPC.  The Chinese, however,. reportedly
 expressed a willingness to correct their positions if in an
 exchange of views with the delegates at Bucharest a majority
 should prove them wrong.  The CPSU, justifying its action
 by invoking the November 1957 Peace Manifesto (not the 12
 Party Declaration adopted at the same time), insisted that
 the views of all the Communist parties should eventually be
 ascertained before attempting a meeting to reach a final
 solution.  In this context, the Bucharest session should
 presumably have involved nothing but *n exchange of views.
 The Chinese stated at Bucharest that in Moscow the CPSU
 had first made the proposal that other parties be brought
 into the debate, but had wished to confine the group to
 delegates from the bloc parties only.  The Chinese said that
 they had rejected this proposal.  It would appear, then, that
 the Chinese adherence to their instruction forced the Soviets'
 hand.
 18.  A.though there are reports that the CPSU intended
 by the end of May to attack the Chinese at Bucharest, the
 Soviet decision to make a major effort there to enlist the
 support of other parties appears to have been reached as a
 result of the Chinese stand on 17 June.  Virtually none of
 the major Free World parties sent top-level delegates to the

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 congress,.:.,.  The fact that Khrushchev was to lead the Soviet
 delegation was announced only on June 18, the day of his
 departure,  All the European satellite delegations except
 Albania were led by persons of national stature equal to that
 of Khrushchev, but the late arrival of Gomulka of Poland
 and the early departure of Novotny of Czechoslovakia suggest
 that this top-level representation was organized on short
 notice.  The leader of the Chinese delegation, P'eng Chen,
 was clearly outranked by this group.  Fifty parties were
 represented at the congress.    Twenty-five of the thirty-five
 i3on-,bloc fraternal delegations identified as present were
 composed of second and third echelon party leaders and
 none of the more significant Free World parties, except
 Chile and Syria, were represented by their leaders.
 19.  The Soviet delegation to Bucharest included
 B. Ponomarev and Y. A. Andropov, the heads of the two
 Central Committee sections for relations with the non-bloc
 pasties and bloc parties, respectively.  During the first days
 of the congress they and their colleagues concentrated on
 briefing fraternal delegates,  It is known that a group of
 English-speaking delegates and a second group comprising
 those who spoke Spanish were called together separately and
 briefed from a long letter which the CPSU intended to issue
 to all parties.  The letter had apparently been either com-
 pleted or revised at the last moment, for it contained the
 Soviet account of the Moscow exchanges of 17 June and
 explained the Soviet view of how the inter-party discussion
 should be handled.  The inclusion of Wu Hsiu-ch!uan, the
 deputy director of the CPC's International Liaison Depart-
 ment, as one of the four Chinese delegates suggests that the
 Chinese too planned to exploit their supporters and acquaintances
 among the delegates.
 20.  The reporting on the sequence of events at Bucharest
 concerning the Sino-Soviet dispute is in some respects contra-
 dictory.                          The following probable chronology, however, emerges

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 from an analysis of the available information.
 a.   On 21 June the Rumanian party congress began
 its open sessions.  N. S. Khrushchev, in his first public speech
 to the congress, presented the essentials of the Soviet line and
 criticized "mechanical repeaters of what Lenin said on
 imperialism," called such persons "children", and attacked
 "those who do not understand that war is, under present
 circumstances, not inevitable." Other public speeches by
 Rumanians and fraternal delegates, including the Chinese,
 P'eng Chen, occupied most of the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd.
 b.  On 22 June P'eng Chen spoke publicly in the
 morning. . He included in his remarks a characterization of
 recent U. S. actions as a "peace fraud, " and he warned that
 "imperialism can never be trusted." Referring on a number
 of points to the 12 Party Declaration, he emphasized the
 doctrinal statements previously highlighted in the Chinese
 criticisms of the Soviet line.  He praised the C4xban and Algerian
 struggles and said that war could be averted and peace pre-
 served by aiding liberation movements and revolutionary
 struggles.  He also called for Communist unity and the
 "broadest possible anti-imperialist united front with this unity
 at its core." He further charged, as his party had done
 earlier, that the imperialists were using modern revisionists
 (Tito) to disrupt Communist unity, and he called for a struggle
 to the end against modern revisionism.  He made no mention
 of "peaceful coexistence, " an omission for which he was later
 upbraided by Khrushchev.  It was on this day that the CPSU
 reportedly begun caucusing with the fraternal delegates.
 21.  Three inter-party meetings dealing with the Sino-
 Soviet dispute appear to have been held.                       The first occurred on
 24 June, when the Soviet bloc representatives met all day to
 draft a communique.  No information is available on this meeting
 beyond a statement that the first draft of the communique was
 presented by the Soviet representative and that the Chinese felt
 12
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 obliged to refer the final draft to the Central Committee in
 Peiping for possible amendment.  The move to produce a
 communique appears, in the light of the CPC instructions to
 its delegation, to have been a surprise pressure move by the
 CPSU.  The Chinese delegates were obviously faced with
 a dilemma, but succumbing to pressure, they did sign the
 communique on the 24th.
 2.2.    On 25 June, after the conclusion of the congress
 at mid-day, a closed meeting of approximately 140 delegates
 from 50 parties was convened.  This second meeting, a full-
 scale debate, was opened by the first secretary of the
 Rumanian party,  Gheorghiu-Dej, who read the draft com-
 munique.                             A number of other delegates then spoke, including,
 at least, representatives of East Germany, the UK, France,
 and Italy. In fact, according to one source, morea.than
 twenty delegates spoke before the Chinese representatives
 took the floor.  The Soviet caucusing and briefings had had
 some effect, for most of the speakers are reported to have
 adhered in general to the Soviet line of argument.  It is also
 worth noting that Pospelov, the Soviet representative at this
 meeting, reportedly did not speak.  This tactic--in which
 others take the lead in a Soviet-inspired attack--is well known
 and is usually employed to permit the CPSU to have the last
 word and to appear as an objective mediator rather than
 merely as one more partisan participant in a debate.  When
 the Chinese representative finally spoke, he attacked the
 line taken by most of the preceding speakers, charging that
 it was unrealistic, slanderous, and groundless, and based
 upon incomplete evidence.  He also criticized negative
 attitudes toward certain Chinese domestic policies and
 asserted that the reports prepared for the WFTU Peiping
 meeting had contained attacks against the communes and great-
 leap forward programs.  (See note.)   He refuted charges
 that the Chinese had not played their full part in the peace
 struggle, referring to their support of Khrushchev's visit to
 the U. S. and to Chou En-lairs negotiations with many countries.
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200240005-7
 He also insisted that the Chinese had supported peaceful
 coexistence, noting in particular their role in the 1955 Bandung
 conference.  According to another source, the Chinese rep-
 resentative also stated that China would stand on the Moscow
 declaration of 1957, supported the idea that a reappraisal of
 the international situation was necessary, and endorsed a
 proposal that the reappraisal should be carried out on a
 multiparty basis.  Pospelov too endorsed this proposal.  This
 Chinese reaction appears to have been mainly defensive; what
 new facts the Chinese delegate brought forward were apparently
 selected to prove that the Soviet case was a biased and and
 incomplete presentation.
 (Note.  This Chinese charge is particularly interesting
 because the two main WFTU reports presented at Peiping, by
 Marcel Bras and Ibrahim Zakaria, did not criticize these
 Chinese policies.  In fact, the Bras report contained two
 laudatory references to the communes.  It is known, however,
 that on 2 June (i.e., three days before the delayed opening of
 the Peiping meeting) the Chinese informed V. Grishin, the
 head of the Soviet delegation, that the treatment of the peace
 and disarmament themes in the draft WFTU reports was
 inacceptable and would be openly attacked if the drafts were
 not amended before presentation.  It is also known that these
 sections were not amended to meet Chinese demands--in fact,
 a number of amendments actually made in the final report
 strengthened the WFTU's support for the Soviet peace line.
 At least one amendment, dealing with the question of Free
 World economic trade and aid with under-developed countries,
 was, in fact, of such a nature as to be particularly unpalatable
 to the Chinese.  It has also been reported that the French
 representatives at Bucharest were particularly incensed with
 the Chinese for having brought this question.into the debate,
 but no one is reported to have refuted the Chinese charge as
 untrue.  One report provides a clue to a plausible explanation
 of this matter by noting that the Chinese said that "such a
 WFTU report would have been rejected by the Chinese people."

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 It seems likely then that the Chinese charges referred to the
 original draft of the WFTU report prepared by Louis Saillant.
 The offending language probably was edited out, at Soviet
 insistence, before Bras actually delivered the report to the
 council.  The involvement of the two Frenchmen, Saillant and
 Bras, in this matter would explain the vigorous reaction of the
 French delegates at Bucharest,)
 23.  Delegates at this second meeting received a number
 of papers, including an 80-plus page Chinese translation of a
 CPSU document.  This document appears to be a critical factor
 in the further development of the dispute.  Its existence has
 been reported by a number of independent and widely separated
 sources, and at least two reports indicate that it was a sharp,
 wide ranging, and bitterly critical summary of Soviet criticisms
 of the CPC.  One source has reported that, prior to the Bucharest
 congress, the CPSU addressed a "sharp" letter to the CPC
 embodying its criticisms of Chinese doctrines and actions, in-
 cluding charges against the Chinese foreign policy toward India
 and Algeria, as well as charges that Chinese actions were
 destroying "bourgeois" confidence in Communist desires for
 peace and arousing Afro-Asian suspicions of international
 Communism.  The fact that the CPSU sent a letter "raising
 various issues" to the CPC was also stated by P'eng Chen at
 Bucharest.  A third source, describing the contents of the
 document, also notes its sharpttx,e and its charges of Chinese
 errors in the foreign policy toward India.  In addition, this
 source says that it criticized Chinese nationalism and Chinese
 noncooperation with the USSR in military matters.  On the
 basis of this series of reports it seems probable that the
 Chinese -translated Soviet-document distributed at this second
 meeting on 25 June was in fact the full text of the "sharp"
 CPSU letter to the CPC,(see above para 11).  If this was the
 case, its presentation by the Chinese was clearly a part of
 their effort to set the record straight, and undoubtedly
 disrupted the Soviet tactical plans for the meeting.  Such a
 significant decision must necessarily have been made by the
 -E-T
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200240005-7
 CPC Central Committee, probably during its early June
 meeting, and suggests that the CPC's attitude toward the
 Bucharest meeting was predicated, at least to some extent,
 on the use of this tactic.  There is some question whether
 Khrushchev was present at this first day of debate.  At least
 one source indicates that he was present, but there is no
 evidence that he participated in the discussion.
 24.  On 26 June came the final meeting, another closed
 session that was attended by those present on the preceding
 day.  It was at this second installment of the debate that
 Khrushchev personally presented his general indictment of
 the Chinese and provoked a heated exchange with P'eng Chen.
 A number of reports state that the Khrushchev speech opened
 the proceedings.  The speech was a long one and reportedly
 involved direct attacks on Mao Tse-tung, comparing him to
 Stalin as "always thinking in his own terms" and "formulating
 theories without coming into contact with the events of the
 modern world. " One source states that Khrushchev's speech
 was arranged at short notice.  The reporting on the speech
 suggests that it was at least partly extemporaneous, with
 Khrushchev injecting facts, anecdotes, and direct charges
 that effectively demolished the attitude of restraint, tact,
 and adherence to principle which the CPSU had previously
 tried to maintain in the debate.  Speaking angrily, with
 violent gestures, he described the CPC doctrines as ultra-
 leftist, as dogmatic, and, finally, as left revisionist.  He
 said the Chinese did not understand the nature of modern
 war, and rejected Chinese protests over the fact that the
 USSR had failed to support China in her border dispute with
 India, characterizing the dispute as a conflict of purely
 national interests in which the interests of world Communism
 were not involved.  There is reason to suspect that his attack
 also included charges directed against some elements of
 other Communist parties of complicity with the Chinese.  He
 attacked P'eng Chen himself, chiding him for his failure to
 refer to peaceful coexistence in his public address to the
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200240005-7
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 congress on the 22nd.  In general he apparently reiterated in
 stronger and less ambiguous terms virtually all the charges
 embodied in the original CPSU letter to the CPC.  Since
 his speech is described by some sources as a systematic and
 detailed presentation of the Soviet charges, it seems likely
 that it was in fact built around the argumentation of the draft
 cirualar letter of 21 June earlier shown to Free World
 delegates,!
 25.  P$eng Chen is reported to have replied in very
 heated terms.  He said he had asked for a discussion to he
 held on equal terms, and that the CPC respected the CPSU
 as an "elder brother" but not as a "father" party.  Counter-
 attacking strongly, he accused Khrushchev of organizing the
 meeting to make an attack on the CPC and Mao Tse-tung and
 to cover up a Soviet effort to undermine the prestige of the
 CPC;  He defended Mao{as "more in contact with the modern
 world than Khrushchev, and more active than ever since
 leaving the government chairmanship." Referring to
 Khrushchev himself in terms reminiscent of the 16 June Red
 Flag article, he charged that "Khrushchevds policy is a policy
 of revisionism, creating illusions about imperialism and under-
 estimating its true nature."  Speaking of the abrupt shifts in
 Khrushchev's policy toward the imperialist powers, he reportedly
 asked the delegates whether "any conclusions can be drawn re-
 garding Khrushchev's policy toward the imperialist powers.
 He stated finally that the CPC had no trust in Khrushchev's
 analysis of the world situation and especially his policy toward
 the imperialists.  Refuting Khrushchev's charges that the
 Chinese did not understand modern war, Paeng aaid the Chinese
 had proved in Korea as well as against the Japanese that they
 have more experience than other peoples of the world.  He
 further registered a protest, saying that he had asked for delay
 in the issuance of the communique but had been told on 24 June
 that it had to be signed in the interest of unity.  He stated for
 the benefit of other delegates the instructions under which he
 was working, and said that if the communique were published
 17

 without the approval of the CPCds Central Committee cor-
 rections might later be required.
 26.  A number of statements by others were then made
 in a general discussion.  Todor Zhivkov first spoke and gave
 full support to Khrushchev's position; others, while less
 warm than Zhivkov, were, it is reported, generally pro-
 Khrushchev in their views.                                No one spoke against the Soviet
 position.  Khrushchev reportedly ended the session by saying
 that further bilateral discussions between the CPSU and the
 CPC were necessary.
 27.  A commission (or committee) was set up at these
 sessions to prepare for a conference to be held during the
 next November anniversary celebrations in Moscow, where
 all parties were to present their views,  Divergent reports
 on the composition of the committee have been received.  In
 general they agree that the committee was to involve about
 twenty parties and that all the bloc parties were to be rep-
 resented.  At least two separate reports state that the parties
 of Argentina, Cuba, Brazil, Japan, and West Germany were
 also to be represented on the commission.  One of these re-
 pol3ts, supported by a third separate one, also states that Italy
 and France were to participate.  Other parties to participate,
 listed only in single reports, are those of the U.S., the U.K.,
 India, Syria, and Australia.  At least one source states that
 the commission was to be composed only of representatives
 of the bloc parties.  The terms of reference of this commission
 are not known.  The commission has since been called to meet
 in Moscow at the end of September.  A.-separate CPSU committee
 has allegedly been set up as well, to prepare a new CPSU
 document on the dispute.  It seems probable that the CPSU is
 planning to use it in November as the draft letter of 21 June
 was used at Bucharest, to predetermine the outcome of the
 conference.  According to one source, Khrushchev gave in-
 structions to the delegates at the end of the session that they
 were to report back to their Central Committees that a plenum
 18
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 should be convened to discuss the doctrinal dispute, with the
 results of these plenums to be disseminated at all levels of
 the party.  On the basis of other information, however, it
 appears probable that most parties did not construe his state-
 ment,:as a command, for there were few such program-is
 initiated before the CPSU's plenum of mid-July.
 28.  The final communique approved by the fraternal
 delegates was released by TASS in Moscow on 27 June.
 According to one source, it was adopted primarily to conceal
 the fact that the meeting had failed to accomplish anything;
 but the CPSU, particularly Khrushchev, clearly wanted it
 as a device to exert pressure for prompt resolution of the
 dispute.  A short and virtually mechanical reaffirmation of
 the validity of the 12 Party Declaration of November 1957,
 its text did not in fact clarify any of the is sues in the dispute.
 This became apparent in a few days with the appearance of
 the Soviet and Chinese press statements on the communique.
 The signatures of the 12 Bloc parties (including the CPC)
 registered on 24 June, and the unanimous approval given by
 the fifty parties represented were to prove the only significant
 feature of the communique.
 29.  The principal results of the Bucharest meetings appear
 to be the following.  The Chinese succeeded in making known
 to a large audience of bloc and non-bloc Communist party
 delegates their strong exceptions to Khrushchev's policies and
 some of the less "principled" actions taken against them by
 the CPSU.  They may have hoped that their adamant tactics
 would create fear of an open split and thus force the Soviets
 to break down or compromise.  Their actions left the Soviets
 and their supporters in other parties little choice but to
 defend the Soviet position as the supreme authority and policy
 maker in the international Communist movement and to apply
 against the Chinese all their influence within the bloc and Free
 World Communist parties,  It would appear that the final
 Chinese position was one from which they will have to retreat
 if they desire a settlement.  It is premised that this will be

 the situation with which the Soviets will attempt to confront
 them in November 1960, when the world Communist leadership
 meets in Moscow on the occasion of the celebration of the
 October Revolution.
 The CPSU Document of 21 June 1960
 30.  The CPSU circular of 21 June consisted of some seventy
 pages.  In an introductory section it outlined the history of the
 dispute in "recent"* years.  In succeeding sections it analyzed
 and refuted the Chinese arguments and it presented a bill of
 particularb on instances of Chinese violation of discipline.
 31.  Soviet views on the background of the dispute.  The
 document stated that, despite a long history of friendly re-
 lations and cooperation between the USSR and the CPR, the
 Soviets noted that the Chinese had "recently" begun to take
 divergent positions on very important questions and that this
 stand threatened to disrupt good relations and the solidarity
 of the international movement.  This divergence was mani-
 fested in the Chinese articles on the anniversary of Lenin's
 birth in April, statements within the WFTU and other inter-
 national organizations, and Chinese statements at variance
 with the 1957 Moscow Declaration and Peace Manifesto.  The
 CPSU had made no move against these Chinese statements,
 considering it necessary to hold a meeting to discuss them.
 32.  According to the Soviets, Chou En-lai told the
 Soviet Ambassador to China in January that the problem was
 essentially a Party matter and that he preferred not to discuss
 it.

 based on a number of summaries of the document, and

 33. On 6 February 1960, the Central Committee of the
 CPSU proposed a discussion to resolve the differences,  The
 Chinese refused to attend such a meeting and began publicizing
 their views.
 34.  At the time of the meeting of the General Council of
 the WFTU in Peking in early June, the Chinese revealed to
 the Soviets their great dissatisfaction with CPSU positions
 and they also told other Communists of their attitude.  On
 Z June Liu Ning-yi told Grishin that the Chinese were very
 dissatisfied with the position of the WFTU on the question of
 peace and disarmament.  Liu Ning-yi sad that "to sit down at
 the same table with imperialists" meant the "betrayal of all
 mankind".  He warned Grishin that if the report of the WFTU
 were not changed, the Chinese would criticize the WFTU and
 expose its "right opportunism."
 35.  At a session of the General Council, Liu Ning-yi
 presented views that differed from the Soviet positions, the
 CPSU document charged.  Then, at a supper and meeting to
 which the Chinese Politburo invited some delegates, Liu
 Shao-chi said that there were important differences of opinion
 among the Communist Parties.  Teng Hsiao'-p'ing then spoke
 on "War and Peace", accusing the Soviets of errors in the
 20th Congress thesis on "peaceful coexistence" and "throwing
 overboard" the Moscow Declaration"-at the same time,
 according to the CPSU document, as he himself contradicted
 the Moscow Declaration.  He attacked, Soviet efforts to negotiate
 with the West as a "betrayal" of world Communism.  Chou
 En--1ai was going to speak, but the delegates asserted that they
 would not condone criticism or discussions "behind the backs"
 of the Communist Parties.
 36.  The CPSU document criticized the Chinese methods
 as incorrect, unacceptable and opposed to proletarian inter-
 nationalism.  The Soviets had been informed by comrades of
 other Parties that the Chinese had many times asked for meetings
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 and had been making known criticisms and disagreements
 going back to as early as 1956.
 37.  The Chinese said that because of the opposition
 expressed against their attitude, they would not speak in the
 WFTU sessions; but they did so nevertheless, even in
 discussion with non-Communist delegates.  Thhn, the
 Chinese speakers at the WFTU meeting tried to impose the
 Chinese line on the WFTU and openly to line the WFTU up
 against the CPSU.
 38.  In addition, the Soviet document charged, the Chinese
 were distributing "Long Live Leninism" and other critical
 articles within the Bloc, without the permission of the other
 CPs.
 39.  It is necessary to discuss the problems of, the
 "character of the present epoch", "war and peace", "co-
 existence", and "road to socialism", the CPSU document
 states, because the "Communist movement does not see these
 problems clearly. "
 40.  "Character of the present epoch".  The document
 criticized as one-sided the Chinese characterization of the epoch
 as one of "imperialism, wars, and revolutions." The Chinese
 claim that any other attitude is a departure from Lenin's views.
 The CPSU believes tht.t:the Chinese fail to take into account
 the changes in the correlation of class forces and that they
 misunderstand and misinterpret Lenin's thesis.  The Chinese
 analysis is "incomplete" and it conflicts with the Soviet
 characterization of the "epoch" as one also of "disintegration
 of imperialism, transition to socialism, and of formation and
 consolidation of the world system of socialism." Developing
 further the well-established Soviet concepts in this regard, the
 document stated that the definition of the character of the epoch
 has "great fundamental importance", for from this definition
 are derived different conclusions regarding "strategy and

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 tactics, peaceful transition, peaceful coexistence, war, peace,
 and disarmament. "
 41.  The Chinese claim that the CPSU has departed from
 Leninism in appraising the nature of "imperialism",. but they
 are wrong.  The document cited statements at the 20th and
 21st Congress and by Khrushchev on his return from the U. S.
 and later, from France, to support the Soviet refutation of the
 Chinese charges.
 42.  War and Peace.  At one time, the CPSU document
 said, the Chinese adhered to the Khrushchev thesis on peace-
 ful coexistence.  Lately, in the April articles and at the WFTU
 meeting, the Chinese have departed from this thesis.  In Red
 Flab, the Chinese said that only the "imperialist general staff",
 and not the Communists, could decide whether there would be
 war or peace, whether to launch local or general war, or
 whether to intervene abroad.  This attitude is based on a wrong
 analysis of forces.  The document reiterated the Soviet
 argument that "war is not merely an economic phenomenon",
 but depends upon the correlation of forces, and that the forces
 of peace may be able to prevent the "imperialists" from re-
 sorting to war.  The most "decisive" factor is the Communist
 camp,
 43.  To take the position that war is inevitable leads to
 "fatalism", "paralyzes the struggle", and "disarms the people.
 Events after the 20th Congress confirm the Soviet thesis.  By
 '-11965"'even, the most rash imperialists Will see that war is
 impossible. "
 44.  At the Moscow conference in 1957 Mao himself said
 that p1 'Everything reduces itself to gaining fifteen years. Lasting
 peace will be assured throughout the world. !  "  Today, the
 Chinese are inconsistent.  On the one hand, they call imperialism
 a "paper tiger".  On the other hand, they say that the imperialists
 cannot be restrained.  The CPSU, however, says that the
 imperialists should neither be over or underestimated.

 45.  According to Chinese articles, whoever defends the
 thesis /of averting war/ is " 'opposed to wars of liberation' ".
 This is false.  Coexistence "does not mean renunbiation of
 proletarian class war, or of national liberation, including
 armed struggle."  The contrary is true:  class struggle will
 increase once the threat of war has been eliminated.
 46.  The Chinese have persisted in their view that "as
 long as imperialism exists...the succession of periods of
 war and peace will be permanent and inevitable. "  (The
 document cited Red Flag and People's Dail.) At the WFTU
 meeting, Liu Chang-sheng said that it was an "illusion" to
 think that there mould be a world without wars and without
 arms so long as imperialism exists.  At a public session
 of the WFTU, members of the Chinese Central Committee
 launched a polemic against the Peace manifesto which had
 been signed by "all" Parties, including the Chinese.
 47.  The CPSU document declared: that peaceful co-
 existence means "gaining time" for the "consolidation of
 the Socialist system and the acceleration of the building of
 socialism and Communism."  The "Communist Parties
 cannot permit society to be thrown back hundreds of years"
 and the destruction of "hundreds of millions" of people.
 48.  It is impossible to accept the arguments of Red
 Flag:  " 'We need not fear war.  Atom bombs are paper
 tigers /used by the imperialists// to subjugate people.  The
 losses from war will be compensated by the victory of
 socialism.' "
 49.  The Soviet position, the CPSU document said, is
 that ten or fifteen years of peace will assure the supremacy
 of Socialism and it will then be possible to exclude war, ""even
 if capitalism remains in part of the world."  (The document
 cited Lenin in support of this policy.)

 50.  Coexistence, the Soviets asserted, will encourage
 cer*rifugal forces within the "imperialist bloc" and will
 I'sharpen contradictions" within "imperialist countries" and
 between them.
 51.  The Chinese say that coexistence means "class peace".
 This is wrong.  The Soviets never included within the concept
 of coexistence relations between colonies and colonialist
 countries, between dependent and imperialist countries, or
 between the proletariat and the exploiters.  Coexistence, on
 the contrary, is a "form of class war" on the international
 level.  It opens up possibilities for solidarity ti th the masses
 for the eventual defeat of capitalism.  (The document cited
 the November 1959 Rome "Appeal" of the 17 West European
 CPs).
 52.  The Chinese say that, in connection with the struggle
 for national liberation, "the CPSU is flirting with the national
 bourgeoisie" and "abandoning class positions."  This is
 wrong.    The Soviet position on participation of the national
 bourgeoisie in the national liberation struggle is "Leninist".
 53.  Soviet economic aid to the "liberated countries"
 is justified by the fact that "objectively" such aid promotes
 the cause of peace and weakens imperialism.  The Chinese
 say that the policy should be "revised" on the ground that
 when the national boureoisie gains power it loses its ability
 to fight imperialism /'India, Egypt, and Indonesia were
 cited/ and "are themselves becoming imperialists".
 54.  The Soviets answered this by saying that it is
 necessary not to "skip stages in the revolution".  To do
 so can cause "serious danj~Sp. "  It is essential to "look at
 the correlation of class forces. "  The "imperialists" try to
 exploit "splits in the national liberation movements".  The
 Communists must try to increase their "friends" among
 the neutralists.  This used to be the policy of the Chinese,

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 with. their slogan of "unity and struggle", but no longer.
 55.  The CPSU document said that it was necessary to
 exploit "contradictions in the enemy capap" and cited Lenin's
 statements on this subject.  The Chinese argument that one
 should " 'not sit at the table with the imperialists' " is a
 denial of this Leninist policy.
 56.  The Soviets consider it essential not to minimize
 the military strength of the "imperialists" because to do so
 would make it impossible to "mobilize the masses against
 the threat of war. "
 57.  The document denied that coexistence weakens the
 military ability of the "Socialist camp", and refuted Chinese
 insinuations at the WFTU meeting that disarmament proposals
 encouraged "illusions".  The current Soviet approach to
 disarmament is "new".    It is based on the belief that the
 Soviet policy would make it possible to create "broad popular
 fronts" and mass movements, and that it makes it difficult
 for "bellicose circles to intensify the arms race."  The
 Soviet effort to get rid of U.S. overseas bases is a major
 aim of the disarmament campaign, and events in Japan have
 shown the effectiveness of Soviet policy.  The Chinese are
 wrong to oppose the disarmament slogan and this opposition
 is in conflict with Soviet program.  The Chinese concppt of
 a "third way" which was put forward at the WFTU meeting
 means nothing less than continuation of the cold war and of
 the arms race, and causes political difficulties for the peace
 policies of the USSR by substantiating imperialist charges that
 Communists want war.
 58.  Different forms of transition to socialism.  The
 CPSU document refuted the Chinese charge that the CPSU had
 been advocating the idea that the "peaceful way" was the "only
 way of transition."  It cited the 20th Congress thesis on this
 point and the statement in the 1957 Moscow Declaration.  The

 Chinese, the document said, had apparently departed from
 their previous agreement with the CPSU, and if they no longer
 agreed, they should say so.
 59.  Chinese activities in the "international democratic
 organizations".  Within these international /fronts/ the CPSU
 charged, the Chinese had been taking a separate position which
 made it difficult to arrive at decisions.
 60.  Within the World Peace Council, the Chinese had
 refused to vote on key resolutions.
 61.  At the IUS meeting at Tunis in February 1960, the
 Chinese had opposed "broader contacts with student organi-
 zations in capitalist countries" and had instead emphasized
 the need for "uncompromising struggle".  At a WFDY meeting
 in March, and at the Afro-Asian conference in April, the
 Chinese had opposed discussion of disarmament on the ground
 that the "call for disarmament lulls the popular masses and
 demobilizes them in the struggle against imperialism."
 62.  As early as 1949, at the conference of Asian trade
 unions in Peking, the Chinese had proposed " 'unfolding bitter
 struggle in colonial and semi-colonial countries' " and formation
 of "liberation armies" under Party direction.  This had been
 done without consulting the Parties and had helped the "imperialists"
 in their fight; against the W'FTU.  The Chinese had later revised
 this attitude, the document said.
 63.  In May 1954, the Chinese Central Committee had sent
 to the CPSU a report ofithe Communist fraction of the Chinese
 trade unions which agreed with the WFTU positions.  However,
 the Chinese were opposing WFTU decisions which applied to
 all countries.  This caused trouble between the WFTU and
 some CPs.     "Now", the CPSU document said, "the Chinese
 talk of WFTU opportunism, and this threatens the unity of its
 ranks. "

 64.  Chinese divergence from the 1957 Declaration and
 Peace Manifesto.  The CPSU charged the Chinese with departing
 from the Moscow documents of 1957 on six main counts.
 1.  They had "revised" the characterization of the
 present "epoch" so as to make it read that this is "an epoch
 of wars and revolutions".
 2.  They say that the "Leninist principle of peaceful
 coexistence", as it is spelled out in the Moscow Declaration,
 creates "illusions" and that "peaceful coexistence is impossible;
 it only gratifies the imperialists and enables them to murder
 the peoples of Asia and Africa with impunity. "
 1         3.  The Chinese say that the thesis in the Moscow
 Declaration that "the struggle for peace /is/ the foremost
 task" of the Communist Parties is "erroneous and anti-Leninist"
 and that it encourages the "delusion that there can be peace
 with capitalism."
 4.  The Chinese reject the Moscow Declaration's
 thesis on " 'different forms of transition' It as coming from
 an " 'incorrect understanding of imperialism.' rr
 5.  The Chinese question the thesis of the Moscow
 Declaration that the 20th CPSU Congress had opened "a new
 stage" in the international movement, and they want to re-
 open the question of the "cult of personality. " The Chinese
 had endorsed the CPSU's action regarding the "cult of Stalin",
 and Mao-Tse-tung himself had done so at the 1957 Moscow
 meetings.  The new proposal to reopen the discussion "de-
 tracts from important Party tasks, and weakens the struggle
 against the consequences of the cult of personality" in some
 other parties, the document declared.
 6. In violation of the principle of correct "fraternal
 relations" of Communist Parties, the Chinese have criticized
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 Parties "behind their backs".  This criticism of the policies
 of the CPSU "does not contribute to the prestige or unity" of
 the international movement.  In particular, the Chinese
 had disagreed with the November 1959 "Appeal" of seventeen
 West European CPs and had called thidocument "opportunist".
 In this way, the Soviets say, the Chinese have set themselves
 up as the "judges over the group of most experienced parties",
 and they did it in the absence of these parties, at a meeting
 at Peking.  In criticizing the CPSU itself, the Chinese CP
 has not been direct, but has made use of "indirect methods
 and functionaries. It
 65.  The need for closer unity between the socialist camp
 and the international Communist movement.  The CPSU docu-
 ment said that the Chinese position threatens serious damage
 to the unity of the socialist camp and that "many" Chinese
 actions have been "disloyal and uncomradely".
 66.  Although the Chinese 'say that } , 'USSR should lead
 the "camp", behind the back of the CPSU they have attacked
 the CPSU, through "trade union representatives, representatives
 of the national liberation movement and other representatives
 of the Communist parties."  This shows a lack of "sincerity"
 and is a violation of the "principles of proletarian internationalism.
 67.  The document cited cases when the CPSU had disagreed
 with the Chinese Party, but had not intervened:  the "hundred
 flowers"" program; the Chinese abandonment /in the commune
 program/ of the "Leninist principle of material incentive under
 socialism." In Soviet eyes, "loyalty to Leninism is tested not
 only by pards but by deeds", the document said, and it cited
 Soviet aid to the Chinese (15 billion rubles in deliveries and
 6. 6 billion rubles credit.)
 68.  The document said that it was necessary and possible
 for the differences between the Chinese and the Soviets to be
 overcome "without compromising principles."  The Chinese

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 must take into account the "interests of the world Communist
 movement"; dissension can only benefit "imperialism, the
 common enemy. "
 69.  On 17 June, CPSU representatives met with CPC
 Relegates en route to the Rumanian Party Congress.  The
 Soviets told the Chinese that they considered the Tatters'
 "views and methods erroneous." The Chinese refused to
 change their stand, but said that they would be willing to
 "admit their errors" if a majority at the Bucharest conference
 "proved" them to be wrong.
 70.  The GPSU document said that, in view of the fact
 that the issues in dispute had been defined in the Peace
 Manifesto of 1957, signed by all Communist Parties, the
 CPSU considered it necessary to exchange views with rep-
 resentatives of all parties.
 71.  The doonment concluded with an expression of
 confidence that the CPC would "weigh our comradely
 criticism in a Marxist way and draw the necessary conclusions,
 bearing in mind the interests of the entire Socialist camp and
 the international Communist movement, which are inseparable
 from the interests of the building of Communism in the Chinese
 Peoples Republic."
 Developments after Bucharest
 72.  In the three months following Bucharest, the dispute
 continued unresolved, and indeed, there was no serious at-
 tempt to resolve it.  Each side continued to argue the merits
 of its respective position; each continued its effort to get
 support within the world movement.  The Soviets sent a series
 of letters to the Chinese criticizing Chinese propaganda
 activities and putting the Chinese on notice that Soviet technicians
 would be withdrawn during August.   The Chinese replied to these
 letters and, on 10 September, produced a comprehensive rebuttal

 of the charges which the Soviets had made in the circular
 draft letter of 21 June.  The contents of the Chinese letter
 of 10 September were made known to some foreign Com-
 munist leaders, just as the Soviets had done with their
 21 June circular.  As of mid-September, leading circles
 throughout the international movement were well aware
 of the gravity of the dispute and many were disturbed by
 the prospects of an international meeting, scheduled for
 9 November in Moscow, at which they would be called
 upon to commit themselves.

 June.", .,
 74.  On 29 June both Pravda and the Peiping People's
 Daily carried editorials on the Bucharest communique
 that made it abundantly clear that both Parties remained
 firm in their divergent views.  Neither of the articles
 criticized the opponent, but the "principled" statements
 of position were clearly divergent.
 75.  Pravda falsely claimed that in signing the com-
 munique the entire Bloc had endorsed the thesis of the
 20th and 21st CPSU Congresses, as well as the proven
 validity of both Moscow Declaration and the Peace Manifesto
 of 1957. The article was clearly intended to create the
 impression that the CPSU had the full support of the world
 movement.
 76.  People's Daily disposed of the communique
 biaefly, using it mainly as a peg for a lengthly presentation
 of the correctness of the Chinese interpretation of the
 Moscow Declaration, with emphasis on "revisionism" as
 the "main danger".

 and Danish CPs were in Moscow and were presumably briefed,
 on how to handle the dispute.
 July
 78.  During $uly the CPSU took action against Chinese
 propaganda activities in the USSR, arranged to withdraw
 Soviet technicians from China, reasserted the fundamentals
 of the Soviet position, and adopted a resolution which formally
 endorsed Khrushchev's actions at Bucharest while sharply
 attacking Chinese views.
 79.  The CPC leadership apparently held a long conference
 during the month.  It is believed that the Chinese decided to
 withdraw temporarily from open disputation, to concentrate
 on strengthening domestic controls in order to counter Soviet
 pressures, and, in preparation for a resumption of open
 debate, to exert pressures on the international movement.
 80.  On 6 July, the CPSU informed the CPC that, in
 carrying two offensive editorials, the Chinese Russian-
 language journal Druzhba had violated an agreement that
 neither country should publish articles against the other.
 The two articles were characterized as against Marxism-
 Leninism and the Moscow Declaration.  The Soviets told
 the Chinese that the Soviet publication in Peking was being
 stopped and they asked that Druzhba also be stopped. #
 81.  Kommunist No. 10, signed to the press 11 July 1960,
 carried an important article by F. Konstantinov and K.
 Momdzhyan, who proceeded to uphold the CPSU positions
 In addition to suspending the distrii+bution of Druzhba,
 the Chinese illustrated periodical Kitai was dmppped for
 at least two issues.  It is not known whether or not this
 was also mentioned in the 6 July letter.

 and refute the Chinese arguments on the basis of "revolutionary
 dialectics" and "creative Marxism".  "Only doctrinaires, and
 not revolutionaries" could fail to understand the significance
 of peaceful coexistence in the "changed conditions" of today,
 they said.  Those who argue (as the Chinese have) that
 coexistence "could disarm the peoples ideologically and
 demobilize them" are guilty of a "blunder".  Those who deny
 the possibility of "peaceful transition" (as the Chinese have
 tended to do) are guilty of "misleading" some CPs.  "They
 can only drag these parties to the positions of sectarianism
 and dogmatism".  Anyone who acts to create disunity in' the
 Bloc, the authors charged, are "willy, or nilly" working
 against the "success of the struggle for peace and sokialism.
 the sacred duty" of all Communists.
 82.  On 12 July the Central Committee of the CPSU
 convened in plenary session; and its final resolution, dated
 16 July, went far beyond a mere criticism of left-wing
 dogmatism.  The resolution gave unusually heavy emphasis
 of the CPSU's approval of the conduct of the Soviet delegation
 to Bucharest, and it actually distorted the result of the
 Bucharest debate to make it appear that it had formally
 endorsed the theses of the 20th and 21st CPSU Congresses
 and that it had included denunciation of "narrow nationalism".
 For the first time, the Central Committee formally
 characterized as "deviations" such views such as those
 held by the Chinese.
 83.  The strong commitment by the Central Committee
 to the Khrushchev line at Bucharest reflected new, disturbing
 developments in Sino-Soviet relations during the two weeks
 following Bucharest.  Military relationships snagged, and
 the matter of the Soviet technicians was reaching a critical
 stage,
 84.  A Soviet military mission dispatched to China
 after Bucharest to conclude certain defense arrangements

 reportedly found that the Chinese had abruptly decided that
 they, and not the Russians, should control the facilities in
 question.  A CPSU foreign section official told a leading
 Free World Communist in July that problems had arisen
 from Chinese demands for modern (presumably atomic)
 weapons.
 85.      On 21 July the CPSU sent a letter to the CPC
 complaining about the Chinese attitude toward Soviet
 technicians.  According to the CPSU, the withdrawal of
 Soviet technicians for work at home had been requested
 at the end of 1956 (and/or early in 1957), on the ground
 that local technicians had been trained.  The other Bloc
 countries agreed to this, but the Chinese did not.  Again,
 when the Chinese complained about the behavior of some
 technicians in August 1958, the Soviets considered their
 withdrawal, but the Chinese demurred.     Recently, the
 CPSU letter charged, the Chinese had added to their
 disrespectful treatment of the technicians by circulating
 "anti-Marxist" literature among them in an effort to
 subvert them.  The Chinese pamphlet entitled "Long Live
 Leninism", containing three April ideological refutations
 of the Soviet line was cited as an example of the type of
 subversive literature being used by the Chinese.
 86.  In a letter dated 25 July, without waiting for
 a reply from Peking, the CPSU served notice that all
 Soviet technicians would be withdrawn during the period
 28 July - 1 September.
 87.  Less is known of Chinese activities during the
 month of July.  "Long Live Leninism" ;was widely distri-
 buted abroad in an effort to publicize the Chinese views
 within the world movement.  A theoretical journal
 (Hsiang River Critic), which had played a key role during
 the period in the 1920's and 30's when Mao was opposing
 Soviet influence on Chinese Communism, was revived in

 the middle of July.  Liu Ning-=i, leading a delegation to
 Japan at the end of July, subsequently demonstrated by his
 actions in Japan the content of the hard Chinese line in
 foreign policy.  The Chinese leadership, apparently in
 extended conference from 2 July to 22 July, prepared its
 answers to the CPSU letters, and it seems likely that
 the Chinese were then in favor of conciliating the Soviets
 as much as possible without, however, retreating from
 positions of principle.
 Au 9_u -St
 88.  Relations continued to worsen during August.  The
 month opened with a Chinese letter (or possibly, two
 separate letters) dealing with the technicians and the question
 of publications.  Later, the Chinese leadership appears
 again to have met and probably to have decided to take a
 harder position against Soviet pressures.  In mid-August
 the Chinese began again to participate in the open disputation.
 The CPSU continued to publish articles attacking Chinese
 positions and employed the Bulgarian Party leader Zhivkov,
 to push pro-Soviet, anti-Chinese theses in the international
 Communist journal, Problems of Peace and Socialism.
 A "conciliatory" ];bitter was sent to the CPC on 20 August,
 but late in the month the CPSU was circulating to foreign
 CPs a revised and strengthened version of the 21 June letter
 which had been shown to foreign CP delegations at Bucharest.
 89.  In a letter (or letters) dated 1 August the Chinese
 answered the CPSU letters of July regarding the publications
 and technicians.
 9P.  The Chinese said that, although the CPSU publi-
 cation in Peking had been writing objectionable pieces since
 September 1959, they had not demanded a stoppage, on the
 ground that they trusted their own cadres to be able to
 determine fight from wrong.  The Chinese pointed out that

 the U. S. Embassy in Moscow was permitted to distribute
 Amerika in 50, 000 copies and suggested that it was "curious"
 that the U. S. should be able to publicize the "American way of
 live" an."imperialism".   The Chinese acknowledged that they
 must accede to Soviet insistence but requested reconsideration.
 91.  Concerning the Soviet technicians, the Chinese
 refuted the CPSU charges.  In 1958 the CPC had asked that the
 technicians be called "technical experts" rather than "advisers".
 This had been agreed to.  The CPC had only complained about
 a few technicians, and this had been settled.  It was not true
 that the advice of the technicians had been "demonstratively
 burnt" as the CPSU had charged; the advice had been accepted
 in the main.  The technicians themselves had asked for Chinese
 literature at the very beginning, and it was not unusual that
 they had attended occasional lectures.  The distribution of
 "Long Live Leninism" was not exceptionable:  the technicians
 had not been forced to discuss it.
 92.  The Chinese said that if the Soviets continued to
 object to these practices, they could be discussed, but the CPC
 did strongly object to the unilateral Soviet action as wrong--
 legally, morally, and politically.  It constituted a violation
 of the Sino-Soviet treaty of Friendship.  It would damage
 the Chinese construction program, create difficulties, weaken
 the Bloc, and encourage the "imperialists".
 93.  An Orientalists Congress, which had been long and
 widely-heralded by the Soviets attid at which Sinology had been
 given high booking, opened in Moscow on 9 August--without
 the Chinese.  Their withdrawal, without explanation, and
 with lame explanation by the Soviets, was probably intended
 to demonstrate disapproval of "opportunist" Soviet efforts to
 attract participants from the West.
 94.  Another meeting of the Chinese leadership appears to
 have been held between 2 and 13 August.  No details are available.

 95.  In mid-August, Problems of Peace and Socialism
 carried an article by Bulgarian Party chief Todor Zhivkov, who
 had signally supported Khrushchev at Bucharest.  Zhivkov's
 defense of Khrushchev's peace strategy as both necessary and
 -feasible followed the line previously enunciated by Khrushchev,
 Gomulka, Novotny, and Togliatti, and indicated that the CPSU
 was beginning to step up its use of Problems of Peace and
 Socialism as a weapon in the dispute.
 96.  Li Fu-ch'un, Politburo member and Chairman of
 the State Planning Commission, reopened the Chinese campaign
 in the overt debate.  His 16 August article in Red Flag (like
 the April "Long Live Leninism" article) was published in
 English in Peking Review, 23 August.  He charged that the
 ""modern revisionists" who had been trying to isolate China
 since 1958 would only isolate themselves (as the CPC had
 said privately to the CPS'; in late 1959 or early 1960).  In
 mid-month, the deputy director of the CPC's international
 Liaison department lead a strong Chinese delegation for
 the Cuban Party congress to Habana, where he concentrated
 on lobbying among foreign delegates to line them up against
 the "modern revisionists",
 97.  Also in mid-August, a speech by Li Wei-han as=
 serted that the Chinese were the only correct interpreters
 of Leninism:  "The Mao Tse-tung ideology is Marxism-
 Leninism in its fullest developed form in the era of socialist
 revolution by the proletariat."  Characteristically, the speech
 added a second major thesis reminiscent of 1949:  "armed
 struggle is the principal form of waging the revolution. "
 It is of considerable significance that this speech was not
 published until 24 September, by which time the CPC had
 definitely decided upon a much more intransigeant attitude
 toward the CPSU.
 98.  Meanwhile, the CPSU in mid-August was continuing
 to elaborate its ideological position.  Following an important

 article by Frantsev in Pravda of 7 August against a 'rebirth
 of views similar to those of the left-wing Communists", a
 leading spokesman for the foreign section of the Party,
 B. N. Ponomarev, declared in Pravda that peaceful coexistence
 was "nothing else but a higher form of class struggle." On
 16 August, an article by S. Titarenko explicitly singled out
 the Chinese for warning against the dangers of "isolation."
 99.  Almost coincidentally, on 16 August Li Fu-ch'un
 wrote in Red Flag about the need for the Chinese to i'rely
 mainly on our own efforts".
 100.  Sometime after mid-August the CPSU. sent what
 was described by a high Soviet official as a "conciliatory"
 letter to the CPC.  Nothing is known about this letter, or why
 the spokesman considered it "conciliatory".  Other very good
 evidence suggests that the Chinese saw nothing very "con-
 ciliatory" in the Soviet actions.       .
 101.  On 26 August the leading CPSU expert on Com-
 munist tactics in underdeveloped countries, Ye. Zhukov,
 wrote in Pravda on "Some Questions of the Contemporary
 National Liberation Movement." This was a sharp rebuttal
 of Chinese hostility toward "bourgeois nationalists", which
 "haughty attitude", Zhukov said, constituted "sectarianism
 of the most dangerous kind."
 102.  Late in August it appeared that the CPSU had
 circulated among the Free World CP's a revised and
 strengthened version of the 21 June circular which had been
 shown to delegates at Bucharest.  The CPSU seems to have
 told the recipients that they would noty have sufficient time
 to digest the Soviet charges and to reach clear-cut decisions
 prior to the scheduled meeting in Moscow in November.  The
 letter emphasized that the CPSU intended to seek clarification
 and to reach a clear agreement with the CPC:  this purpose may
 have had something to do with the "conciliatory" letter mentioned
 above.

 September
 103.  Chinese determination to stand firm on its positions,
 demonstrated by statements in the Chinese press and at the
 Vietnamese Party Congress, was communicated to the CPSU
 in the Chinese letter of 10 September.  Soviet statements
 during the first half of the month indicated that Moscow was
 also not prepared to retreat.
 104.  On 4 September the Chinese belatedly published
 the full text of a speech delivered on 22 July to the Chinese
 Writers Congress.  The speech included a direct attack
 on the concept of "humanism"--theme in both the domestic
 and foreign programs of the CPSU.
 105.  The following day Li Fu-ch?un, who headed the
 Chinese delegation to the Vietnamese congress, delivered a
 speech reasserting the correctness of the basic Chinese
 positions.  The response of the leading Soviet delegate
 N. A. Mukhitdinov on 11 September was a violent attack on
 the Chinese.
 106.  The Chinese letter of 10 September 1960.  By far
 the most important development, however, was the 10
 September CPC letter to the CPSU, which was outlined by
 the Chinese for the benefit of foreign CPs in continuation of
 the Chinese effort to enlist their sympathy.  The letter is
 organized on a pattern similar to that of the 21 June CPSU
 circular for the purpose of countering each of the charges
 in that circular.
 107.  Chinese views on the background of the current
 dispute.   It was not true, as the CPSU had.alleged, that the
 CPC had agreed with the CPSU in the past and had only
 recently diverged from the CPSU.  Actually, the letter statdd~i,
 the differences began at the 20th CPSU Congress in 1956, when

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 the CPSU wrongfully atruck off Stalin's "positive role"* without
 prior discussion with the fraternal parties, and when the CPSU
 put forward an erroneous theory of "peaceful transition", also
 without consulting the other CP's.  The CPC had registered
 tbs objection to these CPSU actions, both in principle. and in
 the unilateral way they had been taken.
 108.  In October 1956, the Chinese letter stated, the.
 CPSU had mobilized armed forces against Poland and the
 CPC had objected.  The Soviets eventually agreed with the
 Chinese.   The CPSU had wanted the fraternal. CP's (apparently
 in a joint meeting) to condemn the Polish Party, but the CPC
 had advised the Soviets that the parties should individually
 advise the Poles.  Again, the CPC letter states, the CPSU
 eventually agreed.
 109.  In the case of the Hungarian uprising, the Chinese
 had again been obliged to intervene with the Soviets to get
 them to crush the uprising by force.  The Soviets had at one
 point been determined to withdraw their forces from Hungary.
 110.  At the 1957 Moscow conference of CP's the CPC
 had been instrumental in forcing significant revisions in the first
 draft of the 12 Party Moscow Declaration.  The first draft had said
 nothing      the subject of state power of class struggle, but
 rather outlined a purely "parliamentary path" for "transition".
 The CPC had sent a letter of objection, but, in order to save
 the "prestige" of the CPSU, had agreed that the Declaration
 should show a link between the formulations contained in the

 Declaration and the 20th CPSU Congress theses.*
 Ill.. At the Moscow conference, Mao had carefully specified
 that the CPSU should "lead" the Bloc. ** This preeminence
 carries with it the responsibilities of leadership, the 10 September
 letter stated, and the CPSU should discuss matters with the
 other CP's on an equal basis.
 112.  The CPC letter, in refuting Soviet charges to the
 contrary, asserted that the CPC had not discussed these
 differences with other CP's.
 113.  The Chinese declared that the CPSU had gradually
 deviated from the Moscow Declaration and had gone back to the
 "wrong theses" of the 20th CPSU Congress.  Khrushchev,
 especially, was guilty of this from September 1959, and of
 open. criticism of the CPC and its leaders. The letter cited
 numerous examples of the incorrect CPSU attitude:  allegations
 that the Chinese want to maintain the cold war, characterization
 of the.Sino-Indian border dispute as "foolish and stupid", in-
 sinuation that "an old man (Mao presumably) like one of a pair
 of galoshes can be kept in a corner to be admired"; "'testing
 stability of capitalism by arms"; Khrushchev's friendly
 characterizations of Eisenhower and his statements about
 "1960--a new era"; talk about banishing war; etc.  Kuusinen's
 A key symbol of the current dispute is the consistent
 Chinese avoidance of the theses of the 20th and 21st CPSU
 Congresses in their affirmations of the Moscow Declaration.
 The CCP and the Albanian CP have employed the term "led",
 rather, than "headed", referring to the CPSU position. within
 the Bloc, advisedly.  The other East European satellites
 in general use the Soviet formula, "camp headed by the
 CPSU".

 Lenin day article, the Chinese claimed, did not even mention
 the Moscow Declaration-which shows how far the CPSU
 had departed from it.  Even if Khrushchev sars that no names
 have been mentioned in these statements, it is clear to eveyy-
 one according to the Chinese, who is meant.
 114.  The CPC letter defended the Chinese actions at the
 WFTU meeting in Peking in June 1960 and pointed out the
 inconsistency of the Soviet position:  it is correct for the
 CPSU to attack the CPC in the presence of non-Communists
 and "imperialist reporters at Warsaw and Bucharest", but
 wrong for the Chinese to call a meeting of leading Communists
 at Peking.  Furthermore, the CPC letter reveals the main
 point of the Chinese objection to the Saillant report (written with the
 help of a Soviet comrade, the letter states) to the WFTU meeting:
 the report mentioned the free world without quotation marks,
 whereas communes and the Leap Forward were put in quotation
 marks.  This styling constituted an open criticism of the CPC's
 policy.
 115. According to the 10 September Chinese letter, the
 CPSU had sent a letter to the CPC on Z June calling for an
 international meeting to resolve the differences.  The CPC
 had agreed but had asked for time to prepare itself.  Then,
 on 7 June, the CPSU suggested that there be held at Bucharest
 a preliminary conference to discuss tactics following the
 collapse of the Summit.  The CPSU assured the CPC that no
 resolution would be adopted at this meeting.  Again, the
 Chinese agreed.  But at Bucharest Khrushchev surprised the
 Chinese by launching on their positions a full scale attack
 for which they were not prepared.  Instead of an attack on
 "imperialism", as the CPSU had proposed, the discussion was
 diverted to a "harmful and disruptive" attack on the CPC.
 After Bucharest, a press campaign was launched against the
 Chinese.  The CPC letter criticized the CPSU for rashness
 and said that the latter seemed not to have understood how
 much this had damaged Soviet prestige as the leader of the
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200240005-7
 "camp".  The letter then took up the basic questions raised in
 the CPSU circular of_,Zl June.
 116. "Present Epoch".  The CPC letter reasserted the
 correctness of its assessment of the present balance of forces
 and its interpretation of this shift as meaning "greater op-
 portunities for struggles for Socialism, for national liberation,
 for peace, to expand and to succeed."  Khrushchev's views on
 the significance of the shift (which Mao recognized as early as
 1949) are erroneous.  The CPSU and Khrushchev have deviated
 from the Moscow Declaration in talking about "banishing war
 for ever", "would without arms and weapons", "export of
 capital helping the development of colonial people", local %var s
 leading "inevitably to world war", etc.  The CPSU, by "attaching
 exclusive importance to discussions with imperialist statesmen",
 promotes the "personality cult."  These views harm the
 "liberation struggle'".  Khrushchev overestimates the weakening
 of "imperialism"; and his views are "subjective", "idealist",
 and  left'".
 117.  "War and peace".  The CPC letter challenged the
 CPSU attitudes toward this question.  The CPSU has turned
 the slogan "war is not fatalistically inevitable" into "war is
 fatalistically avoidable".  The CPSU "always hesitates" to,.
 support "liberation struggles" and "even opposes" them.  Of
 all the "props" for maintaining peace cited in the Moscow
 Declaration, the strength of the camp is the most important,
 but the CPSU is weakening the camp by withdrawing technicians.
 The letter justified Mao's "paper tiger" thesis by quoting Lenin
 to the effect that "Anglo-French imperialism has feet of clay".
 The well-known Chinese emphasis on "vigilance" and "struggle"
 was reiterated, and the letter argued that not the Chinese but
 the Soviet argument about the "destruction of mankind" by
 nuclear war "is to create panic and lead to surrender and
 blackmail. '"
 118.  "Peaceful Coexistence".  In this section the Chinese
 letter conceded that negotiating with "imperialists" may be

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 necessary but objected to :anything that would "beautify and
 prettify them." It might also be necessary to compromise,
 but the Chinese would trust more in the efficacy of "exposing
 and mass struggles" than in the "good wishes" of the
 imperialists.  The letter held out for what the 21st June CPSU
 circular had called the "third way":  ''world war can and
 must be avoided, but the alternative may not, be peaceful
 coexistence.  It may be something like what obtains at present,
 call it cold war or, anything you like."  The letter objected to
 specific. Soviet form 1ations, such as calling peaceful coexistence
 "the highest form of class struggle"* and. saying that the
 "'upsurge of liberation struggles is the result of,coexisten-ce".*41
 It said :that Zhivkov had carried this (false). line of reasomjl;
 .further in:saying that "coexistence is the road to socialism.
 The Chinese attitude toward bourgeois. nationalists was reaf-
 firmed.
 3  119.  "Peaceful transition." Here the ,Chinese claimed
 that the CPSU had taken a "one-sided" view, had sought in the
 first draft of the Moscow Declaration to "evade" the hard
 facts of :"state power, class struggle, dictatorship, smashing
 the state. machinery", and had been guilty of turning "Leninism
 into bourgeois humanism".  The question of "peaceful transition"
 mu'at not be confused with the "parliamentary path":  "we
 should knave no illusion about the possibilities of bringing about
 structural changes through Parliament."

 international fronts:  they should be "fighting organizations";
 they must fight "imperialism, particularly U. S. imperialism";
 they must "support unequivocally all national liberation
 struggles" and "democratic struggles inside capitalist countries
 they must be "flexible" and not merely rubber-stamp Bloc
 policies.  But the Soviets were "all along opposed to support
 of national liberation struggles by the World Peace Council"
 and the International Union of Students "nearly was liquidated
 due to Soviet insistence on the merger of reactionary students'
 organizations.'"
 121.  "Revisionism and Dogmatism."  The Chinese letter
 reaffirmed the Moscow Declaration assertion that "inter-
 nationally revisionism is the main danger" and rebuked the
 CPSU for holding that " 'revisionism has already been smashed'
 It sought to turn around the Soviet attack on "dogmatism" by
 pointing out that it was "dogmatic" to attack such "concrete
 applications" of Marxism as the Communes and Great Leap
 Forward.
 122.  "International Solidarity" Finally, the 10 September
 letter returned to the CPC's views on the way the CPSU
 should conduct itself as the "leader" of the Communist "Camp".
 The relationship must be on a basis of equality and responsi-
 bility.  The CPSU violated this principle when it said that
 I'all the fifty parties at Bucharest supported us."  This assertion
 was not true, the Chinese said:  some CP's had taken different
 positions.  Also, it was "unfortunate" that the CPSU had
 raised the dispute to the level of state relations in the matter
 of the technicians.  The letter expressed the Chinese con-
 viction that "Socialist unity is basic, while the differences are
 temporary." As for the November meeting in Moscow, the
 Chinese believed that it would be a good thing if there could
 be an agreement, but they feared that one meeting might not
 be sufficient.  Meanwhile, they would continue to emphasize
 issues on which agreement existed, while continuing to discuss
 unresolved differences.

 123.  Following the issuance of the 10 September CP.C
 letter, the last development to be accounted for in this survey`
 is the publication in mid-September of two Soviet-inspired
 articles in Problems of Peace and Socialism, and an article
 in Kommunist.  The PPS articles, by Leon Bohr and Jean
 Dienne, further develop the validity of the Soviet argumentation
 and present a number of the anti-Chinese charges.  Neither
 writer has been identified.  The names may well be pseudonyznns,
 and the CPSU's "use of functionaries" to conceal its hand is
 interesting in view of the fact that it had accused, the CPC of
 using this same device earlier.
 124. An article by A. Belyakov and F. Burlatsky in
 Konumunist No. 13 (10 September 1960) systematically criticized
 "dogmatic" (Chinese) positions on peaceful coexistence, class
 struggle and national liberation movements, and the possibility
 of "peaceful transition."  Significantly, the article upheld the
 "creative approach" of the November 1959 Rome "Appeal" of
 the seventeen West European Communist Parties, which the
 Chinese had been covertly attacking as "opportunist."
 The Mb   Parties.
 125.  In the first three weeks after Bucharest (i.e., prior
 to the CPSU.plenum), the Soviet effort to. get full support for
 their positions on the part of the other Bloc parties met. with
 mixed success.  The.CPSU plenum of mid-July stimulated
 further developments in this direction.
 126.  By mid-September the following Bloc parties were
 on record as formally committed to the Soviet side on the
 issues in dispute:  Hungarian (29 June), Bulgarian (13 July),
 East German (24 July), Rumanian (1 August), North Korean
 (11 August), Polish (15 September).  In addition, Novotny of
 Czg   slovakia early in July made. statements endorsing the
 CPSU line. His statement and.a similar one by Gomulka
 at that time were sufficiently satisfactory. to the CPSU for
 publication in Pravda (8 July).

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240005-7
 127.  The Mongolian Party on 4 July and the Albanian
 Party on the 11th adopted resolutions which clearly failed to
 satisfy the CPSU, and they were ignored by the Soviet press
 in a 20 July roundup.  The CPSU evidently exerted pressure
 on these two parties, for on 14 August the Mongolian party
 publication finally presented a vigorous criticism of "dog-
 matists" and aligned itself with the CPSU, and on 2 August,
 Enver Hoxha of Albania spoke in support of the Soviet view
 on war and the desirability of peaceful coexistence.  He
 did not, however, retreat from the Albanian party's firm
 insistence that right revisionism remains the main danger
 to the Communist movement, and in fact the Albanian CP is
 clearly on the Chinese side in the dispute.
 128.  The North Vietnamese Party at the outset indicated
 that it wished to remain neutral in the dispute and has
 continued to do so despite evidence of Soviet pressure.  In
 private conversation in September, Ho Chi Minh reportedly
 stated that he was determined to remain neutral.  He
 considered it important that an agreement between Mao
 and Khrushchev be reached before the November meeting
 in Moscow, but he feared that neither would give in.  On
 the questions of "transition" and Chinese policy toward.India,
 Ho appeared to support the Chinese views.
 129.  In addition to the adoption of formal positions on
 the dispute, "explanatory" programs were observed in some
 IIloc countries.
 130.  Following a conference reportedly held at Varna
 among Bulgarian, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, and Rumanian
 representatives in the last week in July, the Bulgarian party
 leadership discussed the launching of a "mass explanation"
 within the .party in order to explain the issues in dispute, to
 justify Bulgarian support of the CPSU, and to allay what was
 described as a feeling of "general tension border#ag'on panic"
 in the upper echelons of the Party as-a result of the gino-
 Soviet dispute.

 131.  The East German party also launched a briefing
 campaign at the same time.  Lower cadres were briefed on
 the. basis of extracts from the report of an SED delegate to
 Bucharest.  An attempt was made to create the impression
 that the dispute involved practical matters rather than basic
 policy considerations.
 13Z.  In both the Bulgarian and East German parties
 it seems that Party officials were told to watch out for mani-
 festations of deviations similar to those of the Chinese, and
 countermeasures against "nationalist" deviations figured
 in the plans for the anti-Chinese effort in both countries.
