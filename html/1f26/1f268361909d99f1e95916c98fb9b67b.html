 ANGOLA: ON AND ON
 None of the contending parties in the civil
 war scored any major military gains during the
 past week, although the forces opposing the
 Soviet-backed Popular Movement for the Libera-
 tion of Angola made some progress in the
 west-central sector. Leaders of the two sides are
 intensifying their efforts to win political support
 among African states prior to the planned special
 summit meeting of the Organization of African
 Unity. The conference apparently will not con-
 vene before next month.
 The Military Situation
 Late last week, a strike force including
 elements of the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola and the allied National
 Front for the Liberation of Angola pushed the
 Popular Movement out of the town of Cela. A
 National  Union  communique  issued  on
 December 15 had the force moving north toward
 Quibala, apparently along one of the main routes
 leading from the south to Luanda, seat of the
 Popular Movement's government. The muscle of
 this and other combined National Union -
 National Front task groups is provided by un-
 known numbers of South African soldiers, white
 mercenaries, and black Angolans who fought for
 the Portuguese against the Popular Movement
 during the insurgency.
 In the east, the National Union consolidated
 its hold on Luso, recaptured last week.

 North of Luanda, the military situation has
 remained essentially static since Popular Move-
 ment forces, backed by Cuban-manned artillery,
 advanced two weeks ago to within about 50 miles
 of Ambriz, the headquarters of the Zairian-sup-
 ported National Front.  Destruction of bridges
 over several rivers and the start of the rainy season
 have checked the Movement's drive, at least tem-
 porarily.

 by OAU officials, to set a date and agenda for a
 later OAU summit. Governments supporting the
 Popular Movement's Agostinho Neto insisted the
 two meetings be held  back-to-back, but OAU
 members have not yet agreed on timing. The
 Popular Movement's friends are eager for an early
 summit, believing that, under present cir-
 cumstances, they can exploit the meeting to the
 Movement's advantage. At present the diplomatic
 trend in Africa continues to run in favor of the
 Movement; with Sudan's formal recognition of
 Neto's regime this week, the score among African
 states now is 14 for the Luanda government to
 none for the nominal joint regime proclaimed by
 his rivals last month.
 Countries that want to keep the OAU official-
 ly neutral in the Angolan conflict, on the other
 hand, are trying to buy time. These countries and
 the National Union's Savimbi apparently hope to
 counter the political damage to the Movement's
 Angolan adversaries from the highly publicized
 aid they are getting from South Africa by develop-
 ing a backlash against Soviet and Cuban assistance
 to Neto. Support will be sought for a blanket con-
 demnation of all outside involvement in Angola
 and for a cease-fire and government of national
 unity there.
 With the OAU meetings in abeyance, Savimbi
 flew to Uganda this week for talks with OAU
 chairman Idi Amin. The National Union leader is
 due in Dakar on December 19 to confer with con-
 servative  Sengalese  President  Senghor and
 reportedly intends on the same trip to visit
 Cameroon and Ivory Coast. In his talks with the
 West African leaders, all of whom oppose the
 Popular Movement's drive for OAU recognition
 as the sole legitimate Angolan nationalist group,
 Savimbi presumably will be focusing on concer-
 ting tactics for building African support against
 the Soviets and Cubans. His principal African
 backers-President Mobutu of Zaire and Presi-
 dent Kaunda of Zambia-are actually working
 toward the same goal.
 Savimbi and his allies face an uphill struggle
 in their effort to neutralize the highly emotional
 South African issue, which mainly motivated
 Nigeria's and Tanzania's recognition of the Neto
 regime and is clearly causing other African
 governments to waver in their adherence to
 neutrality. The Popular Movement, of course, will
 continue to exploit the issue for all it is worth. This
 week the Movement stoked the fire by exhibiting,
 at a press conference in Luanda, four South
 African soldiers captured in the recent fighting at
 Cela. Neto's lieutenant then took the four with
 him on a visit to Nigeria that began in Lagos on
 December 16; they are certain to attract wide
 publicity there and wherever else he may visit.
 Savimbi, while in Kampala, made an attempt
 to disown Pretoria's assistance by claiming that

 any South African forces in Angola are there on
 their own and by calling on African states to help
 drive them out. His argument is not likely to be
 persuasive in many African capitals.
 Soviet Press Admits Support  is
 1~
 The Soviet central press has, for the first time,
 indirectly admitted that both Moscow and
 Havana are providing military support to the
 Popular Movement in Angola.
 Earlier this month Pravda, in reporting on a
 press conference held by President Nyerere in
 Brussels, cited the Tanzanian President's state-
 ment that he was "certain" the USSR was
 providing the MPLA with the "necessary arms"
 for its struggle against the "interventionists" from
 South Africa. In an accompanying commentary,
 Pravda stated inter alia that the Soviet Union,
 which stands "among the loyal friends" of the
 Angolan people and was one of the first to
 welcome the birth of an independent regime, "is
 providing help and support to Angola during
 these difficult days."
 Last weekend, moreover, the Soviet news
 agency Tass took the unusual step of publicizing
 MPLA leader Neto's expression of gratitude for
 Moscow's "all-round help" to the Angolan peo-
 ple. At the same time, Pravda provided the first
 hint seen thus far in the Soviet press that Cuba is
 furnishing substantial assistance to the MPLA. The
 Communist Party daily said that Cuba "always sup-
 ported  all  national  liberation  movements in
 Africa, including the MPLA-the sole legitimate
 representative of the Angolan people."
 Moscow's decision to make public, even in
 an unofficial way, its role in Angola coincides with
 recent MPLA gains in the military and diplomatic
 arena and suggests that the Soviets may want to
 get their fair share of the credit for these
 successes. The decision also dovetails with recent
 revelations in the US press of allegedly substantial
 US support for the MPLA's rivals; hence, the
 Soviets may now feel less compelled to mask the
 dimensions of their own involvement.
 Sino-Soviet Rivalry --
 Peking is still making an effort to capitalize on
 Moscow's heavy-handed support for the Popular
 Movement. Publicly, the Chinese are maintaining
 a position of strict neutrality, and there is no
 evidence that any significant new amounts of
 Chinese military assistance are reaching the
 National Front or National Union.
 The South Africans reported that a Chinese
 ship transferred cargo to trawlers off the Angolan
 coast nearly a month ago, indicating that Peking
 was making good on an earlier promise to
 provide some arms to the National Union.  No
 similar deliveries have been reported since. In-
 direct Chinese deliveries via Zaire also remain at
 an undetectable level.
 As long as other countries maintain their
 current levels of assistance to the National Front
 and the National Union, China can be expected
 to maintain a low profile with its former clients,
 endorse the Organization of African Unity's call
 for neutrality toward Angola, and score
 propaganda points at Moscow's expense. Peking
 is clearly concerned, however, that it may not be
 able to sustain this approach.
 Any significant reduction in support for the
 National Front and National Union by other
 countries, for example, would present the
 Chinese with difficult decisions. Mobutu would
 almost certainly want to divert to Angola large
 amounts of the Chinese assistance to his country
 to make up for the loss of other sources, and such
 increased Chinese involvement would soon
 become public knowledge.
 The prospect of a reversal of the Organiza-
 tion of African Unity's position on Angola or an
 agreement among its members to go their
 separate ways on the recognition issue would be
 equally unsettling to the Chinese. This would
 almost certainly lead to much wider African and
 Third World recognition for the Popular Move-
 ment and leave Peking on the wrong side of the
 fence.

 Phalangists take aim at snipers during recent fighting in downtown Beirut

 LEBANON: FIGHTING DOWN
 The fighting in Beirut between Christians and
 their Muslim and leftist foes abated somewhat
 during the week following the proclamation last
 Sunday of yet another cease-fire. The new truce
 was negotiated by Prime Minister Karami and
 Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, with the Syrians
 playing a key role in smoothing the   way.
 Damascus has also made a new mediatory move
 aimed at getting Lebanon's political leaders talk-
 ing again.
 Lebanese politicians-Christian, Muslim, and
 leftist-have over the past two weeks traveled to
 Damascus for consultations, and Syrian Foreign
 Minister Khaddam may soon come to Beirut to
 continue the Asad regime's efforts to mediate a
 political settlement. At present, the Syrians are
 focusing on helping Prime Minister Karami to
 form a more representative government.
 Arafat apparently was instrumental in gaining
 acceptance of the truce from Ibrahim Qulaylat,
 the leader of radical leftist forces that spearhead-
 ed the recent battle with Christian Phalangist
 militiamen for domination of the city's inter-
 national hotel district. The latest peace
 arrangements provided for security forces to
 replace the army in the embattled district. This
 was a concession to the leftists who had gained
 control over much of the area and had refused to
 relinquish their vantage points to the army units
 Expansion of the present narrowly-based
 cabinet to include members of all principal
 political groups is one of the few remaining op-
 tions that might help bring about a basic political
 settlement. A broadened government would
 strengthen the Muslim Prime Minister's hand in
 controlling the terms and pace of a reform
 program, thus reassuring moderate Muslim
 groups. At the same time, it would give Christians
 a better chance to prevent or at least delay serious
 erosion of their dominant position. Such a balan-
 cing of interests would not satisfy Lebanon's leftist

 the capital, and in the Tripoli-Zagharta area of
 northern Lebanon. In this uncertain atmosphere

 SPANISH SAHARA: SPANIARDS DEPARTING
 Morocco's King Hassan is continuing to send
 Moroccan security forces into northern Spanish
 Sahara to fill the void left by Madrid's withdrawal
 from the territory well ahead of the late February
 deadline set in the agreement it signed with Rabat
 and Nouakchott last month. Algeria, frustrated by
 the failure of its efforts to obtain a clear-cut dis-
 avowal of the tripartite agreement by the UN
 General Assembly last week, is strengthening its
 general military posture and increasing aid to
 Polisario Front guerrillas fighting for the in-
 dependence of the territory.
 Madrid appears to have virtually completed
 its evacuation of Spanish forces and civilians.
 Spanish press reports indicate the few remaining
 troops will leave in early January; a small
 diplomatic mission will be maintained in El Aaiun,
 the territorial capital. The new Spanish regime is
 anxious to avoid any involvement in hostilities
 between Morocco and the Polisario Front or its
 sponsor, Algeria.
 Moroccan army units recently arrived in El       25X1
 Aaiun to take up security functions. As many as 4,-
 000 to 5,000 Moroccan troops reportedly are in
 the capital and a similar number in Semara. Some
 600 Moroccan police are also stationed in El Aaiun
 and a few outlying towns.
 Despite the influx of Moroccan forces and
 their aggressive pursuit of the guerrillas, Polisario

 Last week also brought the first reports of
 fighting between Mauritanian and Polisario
 forces, with incidents occurring at several widely
 separated points along the long border between
 Mauritania and the Saharan territory. Nouakchott
 has mobilized its 1,500-man army and is inducting
 new recruits. President Ould Daddah's govern-
 ment is especially concerned about protecting a
 vital rail line that runs parallel to the territory's
 In their engagements with the Moroccans
 and Mauritanians, the Polisario guerrillas are now
 using mortars, machine guns, and grenade
 launchers. Each side has alleged the other is com-
 mitting atrocities and both are almost certainly
 guilty.
 So long as they have Algerian backing, the
 guerrillas can keep up terrorist and sabotage at-
 tacks. The automated belt conveyor system that
 moves prosphate ore some 60 miles from Bu Craa
 to El Aaiun is especially vulnerable to guerrilla
 operations.
 Algeria, for its part, has increased its troop
 strength and added to its supply depots at Bechar
 and Tindouf, although the actual extent of the
 buildup is unknown. The Algerians have also
 ordered tents, medicine, and surgical equipment
 from French firms.
 Algeria's efforts are probably intended, for now
 at least, to exert psychological  pressure on
 Morocco and to strengthen Algerian defenses
 along the border. Moreover, some of this activity
 is probably in direct support of the Polisario
 Front. The Algerians are providing arms, training,
 and possibly some volunteers to the Front in the
 hope that the Moroccans will be bogged down
 fighting a long and costly insurgency. Algiers is
 undoubtedly concerned over how Rabat will
 react to this support and wants to be ready for any
 contingency.

 ITALY: POLITICAL MANEUVERING
 Italy's Christian Democratic and Socialist par-
 ties are both troubled by serious internal divisions
 as they prepare for congresses early next year.
 Debate will revolve around the central issue of
 how best to compete with the Communists in
 local elections this spring and in the next
 parliamentary race.
 In the six months since the Communists near-
 ly outpolled the long-dominant Christian
 Democrats in nationwide local elections, the
 latter have done little to improve their prospects.
 The question of how to deal with the Communists
 has deeply divided the Christian Democrats, with
 the result that they were able to agree on little
 more than a date for the party congress at their
 last strategy session.
 The congress will open on March 4, a date
 acceptable to both the Christian Democratic
 left-led by interim party chief Zaccagnini and
 Prime Minister Moro-and the opposing center-
 right group that is seeking to gain control of the
 party. The latter group, which includes a majority
 of the party, wanted the congress held as soon as
 possible, since Zaccagnini is scheduled to step
 down at the meeting. The center-right maintains
 that Zaccagnini's support for an open "dialogue"
 with the Communist opposition threatens to edge
 the Christian  Democrats toward  broader
 collaboration with them. Zaccagnini was in favor
 of delaying the congress until spring or later in
 order to consolidate the influence the party left
 has been gaining since he took over in July.
 Fearing a split that could cripple the party in
 the next campaign, some Christian Democrats
 have begun to work to bridge the gap between
 these two groups. Foreign Minister Rumor and
 Treasury Minister Colombo, for example, are part
 of an emerging centrist faction that is trying to put
 together a broadly based majority that includes
 all but the extreme left and extreme right in
 the party.
 The Christian Democrats' lack of progress so
 far, however, has helped convince the Church to
 take a more active role in domestic politics than it
 uP
 Zaccagnini
 has since the 1 950s. Alarmed in particular by the
 possibility of the Communists' winning the
 municipal elections in Rome this spring, the
 Church hierarchy-including the Pope-is taking
 a harder line on the Communists. The strongest
 statement came this week, when the Council of
 Italian Bishops declared that it is impossible to be
 Marxist and Christian at the same time.
 For their part, the Socialists have been preoc-
 cupied by an internal quarrel over whether to
 continue their crucial parliamentary support for
 the Moro government. Socialist leader De Mar-
 tino has been under strong pressure from
 members of his party who believe that continued
 support for the government will hurt the Socialists
 in the next election.
 Last week, De Martino-while sharpening his
 criticism of the government-convinced the
 Socialist directorate to postpone until the party
 congress in February any decision on whether to
 end support for Moro. De Martino maintained
 that causing a government crisis now would play
 into the hands of Christian Democrats and Social
 Democrats who are opposing the trend in their
 parties toward an accomodation with the

 Socialists. He also agreed that a crisis in present
 circumstances could precipitate early parliamen-
 tary elections, which  most political  leaders
 oppose and for which the Socialists would be
 blamed.
 De Martino probably also wants to avoid bad
 publicity prior to or during his visit to the US in
 January. In addition, divisions among Socialists
 over what course to follow if Moro falls could
 destroy the veneer of unity that De Martino
 hopes to maintain through the party congress.
 The Communists are also urging the gover-
 ning parties to=avoid actions that could lead to the
 collapse of Moro's government. Communist
 leaders fear that dissolution of the government
 now would lead to early parliamentary elections
 in which the central issue would be the question
 of Communist participation in the government.
 The Communists want to avoid a premature con-
 frontation and prefer to devote their time to con-
 solidating the gains they scored at the local level
 PORTUGAL
 41
 Portuguese military leaders are proceeding
 with a plan to reduce the armed forces' role in
 politics. On December 12 the Revolutionary
 Council announced a constitutional law forbid-
 ding military participation in partisan political ac-
 tivities. Recognizing the changing political situa-
 tion, the law describes the armed forces as the
 "guarantor" of democracy and socialism rather
 than as the "driving force of the revolution," the
 phrase often heard under former prime minister
 Vasco Goncalves. It also lays the groundwork for
 ending months of military domination of the
 government by relegating the armed forces to a
 less grandiose role.
 The constitutional law foreshadows changes
 in the agreement reached between the military
 and the political parties last spring, in which the
 civilians agreed that the armed forces would re-
 tain their dominant role for the next three to five
 years. Since the pro-Communist regime headed
 by General Goncalves was overthrown in
 September, the political parties have demanded
 revisions in the pact, claiming that it no longer ac-
 curately represents political realities. Talks began
 this week between the parties and a five-man
 commission from the Revolutionary Council for
 the purpose of making such revisions.
 This new attitude of the military reflects the
 views of a group of "professional" soldiers-some
 of whom are members of the Revolutionary
 Council-which seeks to return political power
 exclusively to civilians and to let the Portuguese
 people decide whether they want a socialist
 society.
 The strength of the "professional" officers'
 group is not known with certainty, but its in-
 fluence is believed to be growing. It already
 appears to have played a major role not only in
 putting down last month's leftist rebellion, but
 also in bringing about a marked change in the
 political direction of the country. An early test of
 the group's strength will be the extent to which
 the new pact between the civilian political parties
 and the military reflects the "professionials" call
 for the military to turn power over to the civilians
 and return to the barracks.
 ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
 The purge of leftists following the insurrec-
 tion on November 25 improves prospects for the
 emergency economic program outlined last
 month but by no means assures its implementa-
 tion. Within a week of the uprising, the govern-
 ment was able to shift attention to economic af-
 fairs long enough to approve a series of minor
 measures.  Lisbon  still  faces fundamental
 economic difficulties and has a limited political
 capability to deal with them.
 The emergency economic program is a work-
 ing document intended to be the basis for discus-
 sion and development of specific measures. It
 calls for a number of unpopular actions, notably a
 10 percent cut in consumption to reduce imports

 and free capacity for production of export and in-
 vestment goods. Consumption would be curbed
 by increased taxes, wage controls, higher prices,
 and perhaps rationing.
 The balance-of-payments deficit would be
 cut by higher tariffs, export subsidies, and other
 measures. Employment and output would be rais-
 ed by boosting public sector investment and en-
 couraging private investors. Civil construction
 and export industries would be the priority areas
 for investment.
 To carry out this program, government of-
 ficials of varying political stripe must agree on a
 detailed series of laws and regulations. Even un-
 der the best of circumstances, the government is
 not likely to succeed in reassuring investors
 because of its commitment to worker control
 over private enterprise.
 Lisbon now estimates real gross national
 product will decline 10 to 15 percent this year.
 Output fell sharply with the nationalizations and
 worker seizures that followed the abortive coup
 in March. Agricultural production has held up,
 but large-scale nationalization and seizure of
 land, which began in September, will depress
 next year's farm output.
 The government already controls 60 to 75
 percent of the modern economy, but has not yet
 begun to operate it in a coordinated manner or to
 invest heavily in it. Many of the remaining private
 businesses are on the brink of ruin, their chance
 of survival sapped by forced wage increases, price
 controls, a ban on dismissals, confused and incon-
 sistent regulations, and denial of credit by leftist-
 dominated committees in the nationalized banks.
 Economic activity has been interrupted by fre-
 quent political meetings and hampered by
 worker insubordination.
 Most prerevolutionary managers and owners
 have been forced from their positions, leaving a
 shortage of critical talents. Many have fled to
 Brazil, while others have been jailed on charges of
 "economic  sabotage."  Remaining  private
 businessmen and farm proprietors have been
 subjected to constant harassment. Legal measures
 to impose worker control in enterprises still in
 private hands are pending.
 Unemployment is believed to be ap-
 proaching 400,000 persons, or 13 percent of the
 labor force. The total has been swelled in recent
 months by the influx of Angolan refugees, the dis-
 charge of military personnel, a drop in the
 number of Portuguese finding jobs in France; and
 the deterioration of the economy. Only about
 20,000 people seem to be receiving unemploy-
 ment benefits.
 Consumer prices, which rose about 25 per-
 cent in the 12 months prior to the April 1974 coup,
 rose at a 20-percent annual rate in the succeeding
 16 months, according to official figures. All wage
 negotiations have been suspended for the
 remainder of the year, pending enactment of an
 incomes policy.
 The serious drain of foreign exchange
 reserves continues, although this year's current
 account deficit could be less than the $800 million
 of 1974. Reserves dropped $400 million in the first
 eight months of 1975, following a nearly $500-
 million decline in 1974.
 Despite  expected  government  borrowing
 from the IMF and private banks, Lisbon will have
 to initiate sizable gold sales by the second quarter
 of 1976. Foreign aid will neither stop the decline
 of reserves in the near term nor correct the
 problems underlying the payments imbalance.
 So far, the EC has offered more than any
 other donor-$175 million in concessionary loans
 to finance specific development projects, refugee
 assistance consisting of $2.5 million in surplus
 powdered milk and butter oil, and a credit for
 medicines. Disbursement of the loans cannot
 begin for several months, as Lisbon has not come
 up with plans for projects in accord with EC re-
 quirements. The US and individual West Euro-
 pean countries also have offered assistance, but
 little aid has been forthcoming from Communist

 SPAIN: THE KING'S MEN
 Most of the key political portfolios in the new
 Spanish cabinet are held by men who have
 publicly supported gradual liberalization of
 Spain's political system, closer ties with Europe,
 and continued friendly relations with the US.
 They are joined by a team of bright technical ex-
 perts who now hold all of the important
 economic portfolios. The orientation of the
 cabinet has thus shifted away from the
 authoritarian right, and the few rightists remain-
 ing may find it difficult to stand in the way of
 gradual change toward a more democratic socie-
 ty. Fhe cabinet was sworn in on December 13.
 The King's hand is evident in a number of the
 appointments and
 anuel Fraga Iribarne-w o was named
 to head the Interior Ministry-was also in-
 strumental in choosing the new cabinet. Prime
 Minister Carlos Arias appears to be left with only
 one personal follower, the hold-over minister of
 public works, Valdes Gonzalez.
 Fraga, until recently Spain's ambassador to
 London, has achieved the strongest position
 within the cabinet. Strong-willed and outspoken,
 Fraga has an eye on the prime minister's job. He
 heads a powerful ministry-charged mainly with
 internal security-and is one of three deputy
 prime ministers. A brother-in-law and three close
 colleagues occupy the ministries of education and
 science, information and tourism, commerce, and
 industry, giving Fraga important levers in five ma-
 jor areas.
 The cabinet is generally considered one of
 transition. If Fraga succeeds in making his mark,
 he may well take over from Arias. Fraga has
 publicly favored legalization of political parties,
 excluding the Communists, and free parliamen-
 tary elections.
 Fraga will try to use sweeping personne
 25X1
 25X1
 changes to liberalize the police, the security
 police, and the civil guard.
 The second major personality in the cabinet
 is the new foreign minister, Jose Maria de Areilza,
 the Count of Motrico, a former ambassador to
 Washington and Paris and long-time monarchist.
 In 1964, Areilza gave up his post in Paris in order
 to distance himself from the Franco regime, and
 in recent years he has been outspoken in op-
 posing the repressive policies of the government.
 he is political-     25X6

 King Juan Carlos presents his new cabinet
 replaces Arias' right-hand man, Carro Martinez,
 as minister of the prime minister's office.
 Although regime Christian Democrats are the
 most conservative of the various Christian
 Democratic factions in  Spain,  they favor
 evolutionary change and could provide a bridge
 to other Christian Democrats in the illegal
 democratic opposition.
 Prior to the announcement of the cabinet,
 there was much speculation that Arias would set
 up a defense ministry to coordinate the three
 military services. The move was reportedly op-
 posed by the old-guard navy minister, Pita da
 Veiga-a conservative who presumably held onto
 his ministry because of his effectiveness in moder-
 nizing the navy. The King and Arias apparently
 decided to compromise and appointed Lieuten-
 ant General Santiago y Diaz de Mendivil, one of
 the less conservative members of the armed
 forces hierarchy, deputy prime minister for
 defense and minister without portfolio. Santiago
 will apparently be responsible for defense coor-
 dination, but it is unclear how much authority he
 will have over the three service ministries.
 Following the first meeting of the new
 cabinet last weekend, the government issued a
 forward-looking statement of principles
 emphasizing economic and social welfare and
 orderly political reforms. Its broad generalities
 and lack of a timetable have disappointed the left,
 which will continue to try to organize strikes and
 protest demonstrations to bring pressure on the
 government. Nevertheless, some leaders of the
 democratic opposition have voiced approval of
 the sweeping cabinet changes. While emphasiz-
 ing that the changes do not go far enough, they
 have admitted that the new government is a
 positive step given the present situation in Spain.

 ICELAND: THE UN APPROACH
 Iceland last week requested an urgent
 meeting of the UN Security Council following an
 incident on December 11 in which an Icelandic
 patrol boat was rammed by a British support ship
 inside Iceland's 12-mile limit. The British ship ap-
 parently was seeking shelter from a storm when
 the incident occurred. Iceland called the incident
 a "flagrant violation of Iceland's sovereignty, en-
 dangering peace and security."
 Reykjavik first instructed its UN delegation to
 propose a resolution condemning the ramming
 incident as a violation of Icelandic sovereignty,
 but later agreed to a more subdued approach.
 The UK engaged in some quiet diplomacy and
 successfully persuaded most of the Security
 Council members, as well as the Nordic countries,
 to urge Iceland to limit the Security Council ses-
 sion to a presentation of views.
 Iceland has for several weeks been con-
 sidering an approach to the UN as part of an effort
 to gain worldwide sympathy and support. Reyk-
 javik deferred an approach to the UN General
 Assembly on a resolution that would have brand-
 ed the UK an aggressor, but reserved the right to
 act if other initiatives failed. The ramming inci-
 dent provoked the request for an emergency
 meeting of the Security Council.
 This is the first time in the long history of its
 fishing dispute with the UK that Iceland has
 appealed to the UN. In the 1972-73 cod war,
 Reykjavik considered raising the issue at the UN,
 but never followed through. Iceland probably felt
 it could make a better case out of the current dis-
 pute because of British violation of Iceland's 12-
 mile limit, which the UK recognizes.

 The timing of the ramming incident-it oc-
 curred during a meeting of NATO foreign
 ministers in Brussels on December 11-12-may
 have killed any hopes that Iceland will accept
 Britain's latest offer on the size of the annual
 fishing catch. In an effort to get the stalled
 negotiations  going  again,  British  Foreign
 Secretary Callaghan told   Icelandic Foreign
 Minister Agustsson during bilateral talks in
 Brussels that the UK was prepared to recognize
 that fish stocks were dangerously depleted and
 were vital to Iceland. On the tough issues, Lon-
 don would reduce its annual catch to a figure
 somewhere between the 110,000 tons the British
 have demanded until now and the 65,000 tons
 that Iceland wants. He repeated that Britain
 would withdraw its warships from Icelandic
 waters if Iceland would stop harassing British
 trawlers.
 So far, there has been no response from
 Reykjavik. Iceland has consistently maintained
 that its position on the size of the British catch is
 non-negotiable and has rejected London's con-
 clitions for, removing its frigates.
 LAW OF THE SEA: THE 200-MILE ZONE
 Moves in recent months by Mexico and
 Iceland to establish 200-mile zones of control off
 their coasts have raised fears that other nations
 will take similar actions. If many more countries
 do so, efforts to reach an international consensus
 at the Law of the Sea Conference may be under-
 mined.
 During the session of the conference in
 Geneva last April and May, most nations agreed in
 principle that coastal states should have exclusive
 control over petroleum and other seabed mineral
 resources, as well as the right to manage coastal
 fisheries, out to 200 miles. Several major issues re-
 main to be resolved, however, before an inter-
 national agreement can be reached:
 ?  The legal status of the economic
 zones, and residual rights of states that have
 heretofore operated in the zones to
 freedom of navigation, marine scientific
 research, and control over marine pollution
 within the economic zone.
 ?  The right of landlocked states to fish
 in the economic zones of neighboring
 coastal states.
 ?  The harvesting of coastal fish not
 taken by the zonal state.
 ?  The management and conservation
 of highly migratory species of fish.
 Uncertainty as to whether the Law of the Sea
 Conference could resolve these issues was
 probably a major factor in the recent declarations
 by Mexico and Iceland of 200-mile zones. Other
 nations may follow suit, and many will, unless
 substantial progress is made in the next session of
 the conference, scheduled for March in New
 York.
 Unilateral declarations are most likely from
 countries that desire to conserve offshore fishing
 resources. Even Japan, which has long voiced op-
 position to unilateral declarations, is under in-
 tense domestic pressure to extend its territorial
 waters to 12 miles to curb Soviet fishing activity.
 Nations such as Canada, whose waters are
 heavily fished by foreign fleets, can be expected
 to claim the right to manage all living and mineral
 resources out to 200 miles. Additional Latin
 American countries, concerned about fishing
 resources and offshore minerals, may take similar
 unilateral actions. Major fishing nations, especial-
 ly the USSR, will seek bilateral agreements to
 protect their access to their usual fishing grounds.

 EUROPE: CIVIL AIRCRAFT MARKET
 Over the next decade, West European civil
 airlines will need to replace about 850 short-haul
 aircraft, worth about $20 billion in 1975 dollars.
 for the past two decades, Western Europe's
 civil aircraft manufacturers have been unable to
 compete with US manufacturers in the West Euro-
 pean market. The Europeans have acquired ad-
 vanced US technology, however, and now have
 the potential to produce a new cost-effective
 short-haul aircraft.
 Within the next year, the European manufac-
 turers will have engine and airframe technology
 comparable to that of US manufacturers and can
 therefore meet the performance requirements
 established for the new short-haul aircraft. They
 also have the necessary production capacity to
 build most of the 850 aircraft that are needed.
 They will have to marshal their resources and
 cooperate to the fullest, however, if they are to
 get their short-haul aircraft off the ground ahead
 of their US competitors, who last year exported
 $2.7 billion worth of civil transport aircraft.
 The Soviet aircraft industry is expected to be
 no more than an onlooker. The Soviets have
 neither a current production model nor plans for
 a new model that would come close to the re-
 quirements established by the West Europeans.
 Aircraft Requirements
 About a year ago, at the urging of their
 governments, a group of West European aircraft
 manufacturers and national airline companies ex-
 amined requirements for the 1980 to 2000 period.
 They decided they would need two sizes of
 replacement aircraft:
 ?  A smaller aircraft with 90 to 120 seats
 and a range of up to 1,000 miles. Such a
 plane is expected to evolve from
 modifications in US and West European air-
 craft now under production.
 ?  A larger short-haul aircraft with 170
 to 200 seats and a range of aboud 2,500 miles.

 Manufacturers wishing.to compete for the
 West European replacement contracts will have to
 commit themselves to a new aircraft program now
 or in the very near future. Several models of air-
 craft in existing fleets have been out of produc-
 tion for as long as a decade and have reached
 retirement age. About half the current West Euro-
 pean short-haul fleet-assuming a 16-year aircraft
 life--will be out of service by mid-1983.
 YUGOSLAVIA-USSR: MINIC VISIT
 Yugoslav Foreign Minister Minic's early
 December visit to Moscow produced several
 bland statements that suggest a deliberate
 attempt to play down the failure to resolve
 basic Soviet-Yugoslav differences.
 Before the trip, considerable Western
 press attention had focused on Belgrade's dis-
 agreements with the Soviets over the proposed
 European  Communist Conference  and  on
 Yugoslav suspicions that Moscow is behind
 pro-Soviet subversive activity in Yugoslavia.
 Neither side, however, has wanted a serious
 deterioration in relations, and the Minic mis-
 sion provided a useful opportunity to quiet
 speculation about an impending break.
 The communique on the visit said the talks
 occurred in an atmosphere of "friendliness,
 mutual understanding and frankness." There
 were no direct references to differences, but
 neither were there any hints that the Yugoslavs
 accept Soviet denials of involvement with
 Stalinist subversives in Yugoslavia.
 European replacement needs, in fact, are
 some two to three years ahead of the needs of US
 airlines. The availability of a quiet, economical
 engine with a 10-ton thrust provides West
 Europeans with an opportunity to supply Western
 Europe's needs for short-haul aircraft.
 The  European  manufacturers  need this
 market to maintain employment and to keep
 production lines going. They are suffering from
 the failure of some past civil aircraft programs and
 from US success in winning the competition for
 replacement fighter aircraft with the F-16.
 A meeting in the near future of the EC Coun-
 cil is expected to address European civil aviation
 plans and policies. The results of this meeting will
 affect Western Europe's ability to capture a major
 portion of its own market and to remain com-
 petitive  in  the  international  arena.
 The communique evidently was drafted
 after considerable wrangling, and Yugoslav
 observers are privately discounting  its
 significance. Instead, they are stressing Minic's
 toast to Gromyko which, they say, amounted to
 a lecture on the principles of non-interference
 in Yugoslav internal affairs.
 Given the contentious political substance
 of the  talks,  economic relations emerged
 center stage  in media coverage. A new

 two-way trade was signed by the foreign trade
 ministers at the outset of Minic's trip. The
 growth in bilateral trade will thus continue
 through 1980, but at a somewhat slower rate.
 By September of this year, the USSR had
 supplanted  West  Germany as Yugoslavia's
 leading trading partner, and bilateral trade in
 1975 will probably reach nearly $2 billion. Two
 years ago, trade amounted to only $815 million,

 USSR-EGYPT: RELATIONS DETERIORATE
 The recent impasse in Soviet-Egyptian debt
 negotiations is a further indication of the
 deterioration in their relationship. Egypt's finan-
 cial options have increased as a result of generous
 Arab aid, which has reduced the effectiveness of
 Moscow's withholding of arms deliveries and its
 hard line on debt rescheduling.
 Debt talks reached a stalemate over Cairo's
 refusal to accept Soviet conditions for reschedul-
 ing Egypt's $2- to 4-billion aid debt. Moscow
 refused  Sadat's demand for a ten-year
 moratorium on all payments and for spreading
 repayments over a 30- 40-year period. Despite the
 failure to reschedule the debt, a 1976 trade
 protocol signed at the recent meeting allows
 Egypt to export roughly $140 million more than it
 receives. Presumably, some of the excess could be
 used for debt repayments.
 Until recently Moscow had deferred most of
 Egypt's military repayments, although service on
 economic debt was maintained. The latter has
 been paid as scheduled over 5-12 years at 2.5 to
 3.0 percent interest. Payments have amounted to
 $60 million to $85 million a year since completion
 Net Flow of Soviet Economic
 Aid to Egypt
 of the Aswan Dam in 1970, about equal to annual
 aid receipts from the USSR. In 1975, Egypt paid
 back more than it received in new aid.
 Moscow's quick replacement of most of
 Cairo's military equipment losses in the 1967 and
 1973 wars underlined the extent of the Soviet
 commitment to the Middle East. Since the 1973
 Arab-Israeli  conflict,  however,  no  new
 Soviet-Egyptian military agreements have been
 signed. Deliveries under old accords continued,
 but even these have been reduced to a trickle
 since early summer. Deliveries totaled $80 million
 in 1974. Three squadrons of fighters, including 26
 MIG-23s, and other equipment worth about $155
 million were delivered in the first half of 1975,
 bringing total Soviet arms shipments to Egypt in
 the last two decades to at least $3.5 billion.
 Recent Arab financing has decreased Egypt's
 dependence on the USSR and allowed it to con-
 tract with the UK and France for jet fighters,
 helicopters, and air-to-air missiles. Negotiations
 now are under way for additional jet fighters, an-
 ti-tank missiles, and laser target seekers to
 enhance air-to-ground strike capability. Egypt
 also is seeking Arab and Western financing to ex-
 pand its military aircraft industry. Nevertheless,
 the Soviet arms embargo has had a serious impact
 on Egyptian military readiness, and substantial
 amounts of Western arms are a long way off.
 Strains  in  Soviet-Egyptian  political  and
 military relations have not directly affected ongo-
 ing Soviet development assistance to Egypt. Dur-
 ing                                                                      1975, more than 1,500 Soviet economic
 technicians were in Egypt, many working on the
 expansion of its only integrated steel mill and on a
 Soviet-built aluminum plant. They also were
 employed on ship repair work and shipbuilding at
 the Alexandria shipyard, and in providing
 assistance to Egypt's fishing industry and
 large-scale irrigation and rural electrification
 programs. Here too, however, Arab financing has
 reduced the relative importance of Soviet aid.

 credits remain to be drawn on old agreements
 that total $1.4 billion. Moscow has been cautious
 in undertaking new assistance, however. A $20-
 million grant for clearing mines from the Gulf of
 Suez was the only emergency-related assistance
 provided in the aftermath of the October 1973
 war.
 Moscow, still anxious to maintain a role in
 Egypt, has recently been seeking to revitalize its
 economic aid program. It agreed earlier this year
 to go ahead with a cement plant at Asyut and to
 increase the capacity of the aluminum plant, both
 to be financed under existing credits. The USSR
 has also offered to underwrite the development
 of the Abu Tartur phosphate deposits and related
 facilities, for which at least $600 million of new
 Soviet credits would be required. Egypt is ap-
 parently shoppin elsewhere for funding the Abu
 Tartur, however.
 USSR: NEW FIVE-YEAR PLAN
 On December 13, the Soviets outlined a
 five-year plan for 1976-80 that apparently commits
 the country to lower, more realistic goals than did
 the previous five-year plan. The highest targets
 are in the agricultural sector; investment there is
 to be further increased and the annual grain
 harvest is set close to the record level.
 Thrift, efficiency, and quality production are
 stressed, and there is little encouragement for the
 consumer to expect anything more than a gradual
 increase in the standard of living. This was
 foreshadowed in the 1976 plan announced earlier
 this month.
 The new plan calls for the following increases
 over the five-year period:
 ?  Agriculture:  14-17 percent versus
 37-40 percent originally planned for 1971-75.
 The goal for grain is set at between 215 and
 220 million metric tons a year; only once has
 the harvest been higher than 215 million
 tons. The already heavy investment program
 in agriculture will be further emphasized,
 rising from 131 billion rubles in 1971-75 to
 172 billion rubles in 1976-80.
 ?  Industry: 35-39 percent versus 47
 percent  originally  planned  for  1971-75;
 heavy industry is to grow by 38-42 percent
 and light industry by 30-32 percent. The
 1976-80 plan thus continues the midterm
 reversal of the current plan, which at first
 promised to accelerate the production of
 consumer goods faster than that of producer
 goods.
 ?  National income (roughly com-
 parable to the Western concept of gross
 national product): 24-28 percent, compared
 with 39 percent originally set for 1971-75.
 ?  Wages: 16-18 percent for salaried
 workers and 24-27 percent for collective
 farmers. The difference is in line with the
 current policy of reducing the disparity
 between the two groups.
 ?  Foreign trade: 30-35 percent in
 volume, roughly comparable to the increase
 planned for 1971-75.

 acknowledging the negative impact on the
 economy caused by weather-connected harvest
 failures, criticizes production shortfalls and other
 shortcomings in the non-agricultural sectors as
 POLAND: HEDGING ON THE ECONOMY
 With a cautious eye on the volatile working
 class, the Polish party congress ended last Friday
 with promises of further economic progress.
 Both party leader Gierek and Prime Minister
 Jaroszewicz acknowledged that serious economic
 problems beset the country-including in-
 Page  17    WEEKLY SUMMARY    Dec 19, 75
 Approved For Release 2008/01/03: CIA-RDP79-00927A011200120001-6
 Polish leader Gierek listens to Brezhnev's speech at the party congress
 flationary pressures, consumer goods shortages,
 and mushrooming repayments on a soaring hard
 currency debt. Instead of shifting growth
 priorities to alleviate these problems, however,
 the leadership outlined a program that would
 continue the current economic momentum.
 Thus, investment, consumption, and production
 targets for 1976-80 are the same as those set for
 the last five-year period. Gierek and Jaroszewicz
 claimed repeatedly that the projected goals can
 be achieved through better management and
 worker performance and through increased
 productivity based on  imported Western
 machinery and equipment.
 Both leaders hedged on the sensitive issue of
 price increases for basic foodstuffs. Gierek, for ex-
 ample, justified the need for removing the price
 freeze, but added quickly that a final decision will
 be made only "after further study and con-
 sultations with the people." Every Pole knows that
 this means the price of food will go up, but the
 bureaucratic maneuvering could last until after
 Easter. The leadership most certainly recognizes
 that any sudden large price increases could lead
 to violent worker reaction as they did in 1970.
 The few changes in the top leadership an-
 nounced at the congress were obviously designed
 to strengthen Gierek's control. His pre-congress
 team was re-elected virtually in toto.
 Two  newcomers were elected candidate
 members of the Politburo. Jerzy Lukaszewicz,
 party secretary for press and propaganda matters,
 is regarded by many Poles as a comer. Tadeusz
 Wrzaszczyk, who was appointed head of the plan-
 ning commission and a deputy premier earlier
 this fall, is a strong supporter of Gierek's efforts to
 use Western credits and technology to modernize
 the economy.
 The party secretariat and the central com-
 mittee were enlarged, but the changes will not
 affect power relations at the top.
 More then 70 foreign delegations attended
 the congress. Soviet party leader Brezhnev's
 speech was short on substance, but-as is his
 wont in recent months-bearish on relations with
 the West. CSCE was clearly on his mind. He
 demanded that no one aspect of the Helsinki
 agreements be emphasized over another, and he
 criticized the West for its failure to disseminate
 the text sufficiently. In addition, he repeated his
 earlier references to "ideological penetration."
 The unexceptional speeches of the other East
 European party leaders were generally refrains of
 Brezhnev's themes.
 Now that the congress has promised a con-
 tinued rise in the standard of living, and with
 special supplies of food available for Christmas,
 tensions in Poland will remain low for the next
 few weeks. Warsaw cannot continue its special
 supply efforts indefinitely, however, and signs of
 discontent will soon resurface as Poles go back to
 their normal business of rumor-mongering in an-
 ticipation of price increases and renewed food
 shortages.

 PERU: PURGING THE LEFT
 During Army Day speeches on December 9,
 both the President and Prime Minister Vargas
 warned "counterrevolutionaries" against attemp-
 ting to "destabilize" the government. Morales
 Bermudez went on to declare that, if necessary,
 force would be used to protect the military-led
 revolution.
 The government is in fact facing serious
 economic problems, and balance-of-payments
 difficulties may be more troublesome than it had
 anticipated. The problems have been com-
 pounded by labor strife, which continues despite
 government efforts to respond to worker
 grievances.
 A crackdown against leftists would give rise
 to charges that the President has sold out to the
 right wing and reneged on earlier promises of
 more open political debate. Morales Bermudez'
 support within the military, however, almost cer-
 tainly will not suffer and may even be enhanced
 by such a move. A number of high-ranking of-
 ficers, particularly in the navy and air force,
 reportedly have complained recently that unless
 the President breaks sharply with some of former
 president Velasco's more radical policies, Peru
 will be unable to obtain needed assistance from
 the US and other Western sources.

 CHILE-BOLIVIA: INCHING FORWARD
 The Chilean government is apparently still
 not agreed on just how far to go toward satisfying
 Bolivia's aspiration for a sovereign outlet to the
 Chilean  President  Pinochet's  military
 colleagues have already raised some opposition
 to the idea. The navy is on record against the ces-
 sion of territory under any circumstances, and
 divisions have been reported within the other ser-
 vices over which course to take. Pinochet
 probably
 arguing that it was necessary for
 Chile to make some gesture to show its good
 faith.
 A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Santiago
 meanwhile has issued a formal opinion that early
 resolution of the problem is unlikely, a move
 calculated to lower the heat that Banzer has
 applied to the issue. Pinochet nevertheless
 recognizes that pressures are building on Banzer
 for some sign of progress in the talks before
 February=the first anniversary of the decision to
 resume diplomatic relations and begin bilateral
 discussions on the century-old problem.
 Lima would have serious reservations about
 any agreement involving the erstwhile Peruvian
 provinces won by Chile in the War of the Pacific
 (1879-1883). A 1929 protocol requires Peruvian
 consent to any alteration of boundaries. For the
 time being, the Peruvians are willing to let Chile
 and Bolivia grapple with the issue by themselves,
 but the Morales Bermudez government will insist
 on a voice in the settlement if it affects areas sub-
 ject to irredentist claims.
 ARGENTINA: IMPEACHMENT VOTED DOWN

 to translate its grave objections to President

 over a month ago by a group of opposition
 deputies. The motion, which charged poor
 presidential performance on a variety of fronts,
 was defeated on grounds that it contained no
 concrete charges, only political criticism.
 the committee's action is not surprising. In
 the first place, the strongest support for impeach-
 ment has come from a handful of congressmen
 representing a tiny splinter party. Thus far the
 larger opposition groups have not followed
 through on their threats to push for impeach-
 ment. Moreover, members of the governing
 coalition have the largest representation on the
 chamber's impeachment committee.
 Although spared the immediate threat of im-
 peachment, the government lost ground in the
 chamber as a whole, when, for the first time, it
 ceased to command an absolute majority. The set-
 back came last week when 27 members of the
 coalition officially left it. The 27 then formed their
 own group, joining other congressmen trying to
 fend off administration efforts to hinder congress'
 investigation of high-level corruption.
 The split merely formalized the steady ero-
 sion of the President's authority. She is the titular
 head of the Peronist party, which forms the core
 of the coalition. The attack on her leadership
 began many months ago and is highlighted by the
 passage of a succession law she strongly opposed
 and by the ouster of a close associate from the
 presidency of the chamber of deputies.
 The President's loss of authority does not,
 however, mean a corresponding increase in the
 power of the forces ranged against her. Indeed,
 the latter seem more and more disorganized
 despite the generally agreed need to "do
 something." Thus, congressional action on the
 impeachment and investigation questions faces
 protracted wrangling and may not produce con-

 CHINA: A VOICE FROM THE LEFT
 Party leftists have been remarkably silent all
 year as many of their pet policies, adopted during
 the Cultural Revolution, have been overturned by
 a moderate coalition headed by vice premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping. Early this month, however, they
 launched a propaganda counterattack in their last
 remaining area of influence-education-and
 have attempted to expand this into a general
 defense of the Cultural Revolution and the
 policies of that period.
 Chairman Mao has reportedly endorsed
 several changes in educational policy that would
 raise the level of academic training in China's u-
 niversities. These changes were elaborated on in a
 speech made by the minister of education this
 fall. On December 4, however, the day the educa-
 tion minister returned from a trip abroad, the par-
 ty newspaper carried an article on the front page
 that attacked each of the educational changes
 point by point.
 The leftist outcry over education has
 probably thrown enough of a scare into educators
 to prevent them from making any changes in
 educational policy. Attempts to expand this attack
 into a defense of the Cultural Revolution in order
 to regain some lost ground are likely to meet with
 less success.
 Several articles lauding the Cultural Revolu-
 tion appeared recently, calling for a defense of
 the "new things," policies that emerged from the
 Cultural Revolution. This broader attack is a
 response not only to the changes in Cultural
 Revolution  policies-and  to  Mao's  apparent
 abandonment of the left-but also undoubtedly
 to the growing power and prestige of the
 rehabilitated Teng Hsiao-ping. Teng is a particular
 irritant to the party's left wing because, as one of
 the most prominent victims of the Cultural
 Revolution, he personifies all of the evils that the
 leftists wanted to eradicate during that period.
 One article, in fact, specifically warns officials
 who were purged during the Cultural Revolution
 but have now been reinstated to mind their p's
 and q's.
 Teng Hsiao-ping
 Teng's power, greater now than before the
 Cultural Revolution, is likely to confine leftists' at-
 tacks to propaganda broadsides while limiting
 their actual influence over policy. Nevertheless,
 these recent articles demonstrate that leftists re-
 tain access to the media and are capable of stir-
 ring up propaganda debates despite a steady
 decline in their political influence. In the past
 year, the left has not been able to mount a
 sustained attack on current policies. If kept up
 over time, such leftist activity could force the
 hard-nosed Teng to take firm action against his
 antagonists or, in the tradition of Premier Chou
 En-lai, to tread more cautiously in overturning the
 policies of the Cultural Revolution.
