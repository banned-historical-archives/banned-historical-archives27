 China:  Poor Outlook for the Three Gorges Project
 Summary
 We believe the Three Gorges hydroelectric project is a far cry from
 the "sure thing" China's power ministry has tried to convince United States
 and other foreign parties it is. For the project to become a reality, we
 believe seven major obstacles must be overcome: the World Bank must
 endorse it, low cost financing must be secured, China's economy must
 improve, stronger domestic political support must be found, a strategy for
 meeting short term energy needs must be agreed to, better management
 of limited resources must be realized and a division of labor between
 Chinese and foreign firms must be worked out. If the Chinese
 Government approves the project, we believe low-cost loans, grants, and
 supplier credits from Japan, Canada, and elsewhere will give foreign firms
 the edge over the United States in bidding on the project.
 This memorandum was prepared byl            Office of East Asian Analysis.
 Information available as of 3 October 1986 was used in its preparation. Comments and
 queries are welcome and may be directed to the Chief, Economic Assessments Branch,

 The Chinese Government has again deferred--this time until late 1987--a final
 decision on whether to build the giant Three Gorges project (see inset). In June, the
 State Council assigned responsibility for the project to two new offices and authorized
 still more feasibility studies, which Canada will carry out and the World Bank will
 supervise.' For a number of reasons, we doubt the project will come to fruition even if
 it wins State Council approval in 1987.
 Three Gorges: A Mammoth Undertaking
 For over three decades, proposals to dam the Yangtze River at Three
 Gorges have been debated by successive Chinese leaders. If built, the dam
 would provide more power capacity than any other in the world--13,000
 megawatts (MW), according to the Chinese press, equal to 15 percent of China's
 current total power capacity--within a practical distance of China's
 power-starved coastal industries. It would also provide flood control and
 improved navigation on the Yangtze River, possibly allowing oceangoing vessels
 to reach Chongqing. The cost would be steep--with Chinese and foreign
 estimates ranging from $10-16 billion, depending on height, power capacity, and
 lock capabilities--and construction would take anywhere from 10 to 20 years.
 Some Big Ifs
 For the Three Gorges to become reality, we believe seven major obstacles must
 be negotiated. The fact that the project has been on the drawing broad for over 30
 years testifies to the difficulty of that task.
 Favorable International Findings
 To persuade the State Council that the project is a legitimate use of tight
 investment funds, we believe China's review groups will need a strong recommendation
 from the World Bank. World Bank approval, however, is not ensured. Past favorable
 evaluations of Three Gorges, which were done by the pro-project Ministry of Water
 Resources and Electric Power (MWREP), never included the Bank-style cost-benefit
 analysis. Also, the technical studies of various aspects of the project done by MWREP
 ' We believe the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power--the leading
 proponent for Three Gorges--has been sidelined by the State Council decision. See
 appendix A for a discussion of who is calling the shots on the Three Gorges project.

 have used different assumptions about such factors as dam height, 2 reservoir levels,
 and navigation capabilities--making an assessment of the merits impossible. Nor is it
 clear that the Bank will recommend a single large dam as the optimum method of
 meeting flood control and electric power needs; MWREP itself has been debating this
 question for decades.
 Low-Cost Financing
 we estimate the Chinese will need
 $5-8 billion in foreign exchange for the Three Gorges project.  China is only interested
 in low-cost, concessionary loans--Vice Premier Li Peng, China's energy czar, has told
 US Government officials that Three Gorges would not proceed without them. We
 believe China cannot secure this amount without unusual cooperation from several
 countries and international organizations, and Beijing's best sources of low-cost
 financing, the World Bank and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), may
 not be able to provide much help. The World Bank has already indicated to US Embassy
 officials in Beijing that it would not finance Three Gorges alone. And, although Japanese
 press reports suggest that Tokyo is willing to devote China's next two OECF allocations
 (covering the 1990s) exclusively to Three Gorges, we believe China's developing
 industries would lobby hard against the proposal because it would cost them a major
 source of low-cost project financing for an entire decade.
 We think China's best hope is to press potential foreign participants, including the
 United States, to contribute to an international finance package that might include a
 partial OECF allocation, various eximbank contributions, supplier credits, and possibly
 loans from the World Bank. Beijing's success in assembling such a package will depend
 on the ability of foreign firms to agree on a division of the Three Gorges pie and to
 convince their governments and financial institutions to provide the financing, which we
 believe will be difficult.
 A Sound Economy
 Because the dam provides no direct source of foreign exchange to repay project
 loans, the level of China's foreign exchange reserves will be a factor in Beijing's
 decision, even if low-cost loans are available. By our calculations, assuming a 30 year
 pay-back period, foreign loan repayment costs for the dam would climb gradually, to at
 least $500 million a year for 10 or more of those years. Moreover, we think China
 would have considerable difficulty financing the costs of Three Gorges not covered by
 foreign loans, costs we estimate at 15 to 25 billion yuan ($4-7 billion), more than
 China's entire hydropower budget in the last decade. China's capital construction
 budget is already stressed by two years of excessive growth, and other industries will

 try to delay a decision on Three Gorges to preserve their share of the pie.
 A Strong Backer
 high-cost project that will not provide any payoff for decades.
 Research by two leading US China scholars concludes that large projects such as
 Three Gorges must have strong backing from at least one top leader if they are to
 become a reality.3 We believe the support of Deng Xiaoping or Zhao Ziyang is critical
 for Three Gorges.  We suspect the project faces strong opposition from many quarters
 in the bureaucracy--including other energy ministries such as coal and oil, and several
 provincial governments--who see their shares of the state investment budget, access to
 foreign exchange, and power threatened. Vice Premier Li Peng seems a lukewarm
 supporter at best, and we do not detect any other strong support in the top leadership,
 perhaps because no one sees any personal gain from championing a high-risk,
 Urgent Power Needs
 we believe that serious power shortages are likely to continue.
 Chronic power shortages resulting from rapid industrial growth in the 1980s may
 force China to opt for investment in easy-to-build thermal plants and to defer
 long-term hydroprojects such as Three Gorges. China is already building more thermal
 power capacity than it had planned, and although industrial growth has slowed in 1986,
 promised in the budget.
 China's record for completing hydropower projects is poor. China actually
 commissioned only 400 MW of hydro capacity--two or three generators--in 1985,
 compared with 5,100 MW of thermal capacity, though it has had 10,000 MW of hydro
 capacity under construction for years. Most of the problem lies in overall management
 of the hydropower effort. Projects are frequently and wastefully postponed and later
 reactivated. Four of eight major hydroprojects begun in the late 1970s were shelved for
 two years or more; two of the four only recently resumed construction." Even while
 some projects were on hold, those actively under construction had to compete for
 materials and investment funds. Moreover, over the last year, we suspect that dams
 designated as key national projects have had problems getting money that had been

 We believe China could handle construction of Three Gorges if it were the only
 major hydroproject, but plans call for an ambitious expansion of hydropower even
 without Three Gorges. China's official targets for large hydropower projects call for
 adding 28,000 MW of new capacity--twice as much as Three Gorges represents--by the

 year 2000 (see table 1). We doubt China can marshall the resources to add that much
 capacity in that time period, but given China's severe power shortages and
 provincial-level support for other hydroprojects, Beijing is unlikely to scale back its plans
 either. In our judgment, MWREP will find itself overextended and behind schedule even
 without Three Gorges.
 Self-Reliance Versus Foreign Participation
 Li Pang has emphasized that the Chinese themselves would build Three Gorges,
 and not turn the project over to foreigners. Whether the Chinese truly act as general
 contractors for Three Gorges, or assume the role In name only, we believe efforts to
 ensure maximum Chinese participation and the usual bureaucratic hassles encountered
 by foreign companies will lead to negotiating and construction delays.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/25: CIA-RDP86T01017R000606650002-6
 Moreover, the Chinese in our view misjudge their capabilities. US officials have
 recommended--in large part because of perceived problems in China's hydropower
 sector--that Beijing plan on spending at least three-fourths of the cost of Three Gorges
 abroad to buy construction equipment, building materials, electrical equipment (including
 all 26 generators), and to acquire foreign consultants and management for various
 stages of construction. MWREP, however, told US officials it wants to keep foreign
 exchange costs down to roughly 40 percent of project costs and to minimize outside
 foreign management. It is also considering importing the technology for the plant's
 500-MW generators and building them in China. Either tactic is likely to delay
 completion, given China's lackluster record in hydropower construction and its ongoing
 problems with even trial production of smaller 300-MW hydroturbines.
 We also expect bargaining with foreign suppliers on equipment and engineering
 contracts to cause considerable delay. Based on our analysis of Chinese negotiating
 tactics, we believe the Chinese will play one vendor's quotes against
 another's--regardless of the time wasted in negotiation. For example, China began
 commercial discussions for the Guangdong nuclear power plant more than three years
 ago, but only last month signed a final contract for the reactors.
 We believe that no compelling advantage to US firms would evolve from either
 private or US Government contributions to the current round of feasibility studies. Past
 US contributions of hydroproject studies to China did not even guarantee US firms a
 right to bid on those projects, and MWREP has already told US Embassy officials in
 Beijing that any contributions for Three Gorges must include no "preconditions," even
 the right to bid. MWREP also said Ottawa was told that Canada's contribution of $5
 million to the new studies did not preempt any other potential suppliers.
 If the project is approved, both financing requirements and Beijing's emphasis on
 self-reliance suggest that neither the United States nor any other country will be
 permitted to take the lead on Three Gorges. Consequently, US firms can expect
 substantial competition for all goods and services the Chinese seek for Three Gorges.
 China has purchased both hydropower construction equipment and expertise from the
 United States, but given the likely intensity of competition, price and financing
 arrangements will play a key role in all negotiations, and here US firms will be at a
 distinct disadvantage. If China builds Three Gorges, low-cost loans, grants, and supplier
 credits available from Japan, Canada, and elsewhere would give other foreign firms a
 competitive edge that may exceed the benefits of a cheaper dollar.
 In fact, a little-publicized supplier credit issued by Canada concurrently with the
 feasibility study donation may have given Canada a leg up on both the United States
 and Japan in supplying the hydropower generators for Three Gorges. Canada's US$252
 million in equipment credits allows for technology transfer packages, and if the project
 goes ahead the Chinese could use this money to import Canadian 500-MW generator
 technology--dashing US and Japanese hopes of selling China 26 generators or the
 technology to build them.

 Appendix A
 Three Gorges: Who Is Calling the Shots
 We believe the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power (MWREP) has
 consistently misrepresented both its ability to influence decisionmaking on the Three
 Gorges project and the chances the project will gain final State Council approval.
 Indeed, the recent creation of two oversight bodies by the State Council signals a
 decline in MWREP's influence and unhappiness with the way it had managed the project.
 project approval before MWREP would have to choose a specific height.?
 The MWREP has marshalled every resource available in trying to convince the
 leadership to build Three Gorges.5 Hoping for the dam's inclusion in the Seventh Five
 Year Plan (1986-90), MWREP's Minister, Madame Qian Zhengying, unsuccessfully tried in
 1984 to sell the dam as an answer to East China's electric power needs, according to
 MWREP, who also told US Embassy officials they later placed more emphasis on the
 dam's other benefits--navigation and flood control.6 We believe, MWREP remained
 deliberately vague about the height of the dam to gain maximum political support at the
 provincial level, hoping that a coalition of high and low dam supporters would lead to
 planning office should eventually govern Sanxia Province.
 We believe MWREP's main strategy, however, has been to try to give the Three
 Gorges project enough momentum to preempt strong opposition from arising before the
 State Council made a final decision. Last year the Ministry was instrumental in
 establishing a planning office to create a new Chinese province for the dam, called
 Sanxia. MWREP provided staff for the planning office, and used it as a springboard for a
 press blitz on the benefits of the Three ,Gorges dam--even hinting at support from Deng
 Xiaoping--to create the impression that its construction was a foregone conclusion.
 Articles in Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao and elsewhere mapped out tentative boundaries for
 the province, and MWREP hinted through these articles that its own officials in the

 electric power.
 In studies carried out by the US Interior's Bureau of Reclamation in 1981 under the
 US-China Hydroelectric Protocol, US experts told MWREP that in cost-benefit terms
 the dam probably made more sense as a flood control project than as a source of
 greater flood control capabilities.
 Most of those outside of MWREP willing to consider the dam favored a lower dam to
 keep down costs, including peasant relocation costs. According to Lieberthal and
 Oksenberg, Chongqing favors a higher dam that will allow oceangoing vessels to
 reach the city; the provinces downstream presumably also favor a higher dam with

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/25: CIA-RDP86T01017R000606650002-6
 Criticism Forces Postponement...
 We believe MWREP's political maneuvering was ineffective and possibly
 counterproductive. In March of this year, outspoken opposition to Three Gorges
 surfaced at the sixth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). A
 well-received speech by economist Qian Jiaju--reported in both the Beijing and Hong
 Kong press--blasted the leadership's usual willingness to "give the nod" to large
 projects without comprehensive technical evaluations. Following Qian's speech, an
 earlier CPPCC review critical of Three Gorges was detailed In Ta Kung Pao. Then, .in an
 April press conference, Vice-Premier Li Peng downplayed plans for a new province and
 belittled the planning office. In June, the leadership dissolved the provincial planning
 office and postponed a final decision on Three Gorges until late 1987.
 And a New Approach
 In the meantime, the State Council has set up two new planning bodies for the
 project. According to Chinese press reports, both are directly answerable to the State
 Council, and neither includes any MWREP representation. The new groups represent a
 leadership effort to make a more informed and less political decision on the merits of
 the Three Gorges project.
 The Three Gorges Project Coordination Group will oversee a new round of
 internal bureaucratic review. It includes members of the State Council, the National
 People's Conference (NPC) Standing Committee, the CPPCC National Committee, and the
 Central Advisory Commission, namely Li Peng, Wang Renzhong, Chang Zihua, and Bo
 Yibo.
 More powerful is the Three Gorges Project Examination Committee, which will
 evaluate new foreign and domestic feasibility studies, and make the preliminary
 recommendation next year on whether the State Council should approve the dam.
 Chinese press reports list LI Peng as chairman of this committee with two State
 Councillors as vice chairmen: Song Ping, head of the State Planning Commission (SPC),
 and Song Jian, head of the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC).
 Li Peng was personally opposed to the project in
 the early 1980s, and In talks with US officials over the last two years he has been a
 lukewarm supporter at best. In an era of budget cutbacks and foreign exchange
 restrictions, he Is already committed to another big-ticket item, China's commercial
 nuclear program, which has Itself been cut back In recent months. Despite his influence
 and his position as "energy czar," we think LI will recommend Three Gorges receive
 State Council approval only If concessionary funding is available and the feasibility
 studies make the project appear quite sound. Even then, he may not prove a strong
 supporter of the project.

 Appendix B
 How Big Is Three Gorges?
 Although Three Gorges is not a high dam---the low design option of 160 meters
 would make it shorter than the 172-meter dam being built by the Chinese at
 Longyangxia--it is relatively long and--for a concrete-and-earth dam--massive; in
 volume terms Three Gorges ranks among the world's largest, many of which are lower,
 earth or rockfill dams.
