 Chinese and Vietnamese leaders could have been the characters
 Samuel Beckett had in mind when he wrote in Waiting for Godot,
 "They gave birth astride the grave...." For the'death of Ho Chi Minh
 provided the occasion for the infusion of new life into the Sino-
 Vietnamese association. Like a distant relative who had been out of
 touch, Premier Chou En-lai hurried to Hanoi the day after Ho's death
 as if to make amends for not maintaining family relations.
 The public breach in Sino-Vietnamese relations that opened
 with the beginning of the Paris talks in mid-1968 was indeed closed
 with the death of Ho Chi Minh. But Sino-Vietnamese relations are a
 part of the hard world of international politics, and there is more
 behind this change than a death in the family,

 S.: ,RE
 For years, China and North Vietnam have
 been bound together by the war in South Viet-
 nam. Hanoi's goal of achieving control of all
 Vietnam has coincided with Peking's interest in a
 major, clear-cut defeat of the US in Southeast
 Asia-a defeat that the Chinese have hoped would
 lead to a general lessening of the American
 presence in Asia and, specifically, a reduction of
 US political and military commitments to nations
 adjacent to China. Additionally, a US defeat in
 Vietnam or even a continuation of the present
 struggle could be used by Peking to demonstrate
 the efficacy of a Chinese-style "peoples war" and
 to further its ideological case against Moscow.
 Political relations between the Chinese and
 the Vietnamese Communists have always con-
 tained elements of serious friction. a legacy of
 historical Chinese imperialism brought up to date
 by Hanoi's repeated demonstrations of inde-
 pendence during the past several years.
 Prior to the overthrow of Khrushchev, how-
 ever, the North Vietnamese clearly regarded
 China as their primary ally, characterizing their
 relations as being as close as "lips and teeth."
 Scarcely an issue of North Vietnamese publica-
 tions missed taking a swipe at "modern revision-
 ism," and no occasion was overlooked to praise
 Peking. This attitude on the part of the Viet-
 namese stemmed almost entirely from the hard
 fact that China offered political and material sup-
 port for Hanoi's efforts to take over the South,
 whereas Moscow had refrained from all but token
 gestures of support.
 This unnatural dependence ended when the
 Soviet Union first assumed an active role in sup-
 port of Hanoi's war effort, allowing North Viet-
 nam to strike a balance between Moscow and
 Peking. Since then, Hanoi has accepted assistance
 Special Report
 SECRET
 and advice from both but ultimately has charted
 its own course. Thus the power and proximity of
 China-and even the considerable assistance it has
 provided without interruption-have not enabled
 Peking to exert what it considers a proper degree
 of influence in Hanoi.
 The Sino-Vietnamese frictions that might
 have been expected as a result of this new politi-
 cal equation were exacerbated considerably by
 the growing Sino-Soviet conflict and the con-
 vulsions of China's Cultural Revolution. Chinese
 propaganda began to treat the Vietnam issue as an
 object of Sino-Soviet ideological rivalry, an ap-
 proach  that produced  increasing Vietnamese
 resentment. Hanoi was also angered and alarmed
 by Peking's efforts to export the Cultural Revolu-
 tion to North Vietnam's ethnic Chinese commu-
 nity-the same "Red Guard diplomacy" that
 ruined China's relations with many of its other
 friends. In May 1967, the North Vietnamese
 party journal went so far as to publish an indirect
 but unmistakable personal attack on Mao Tse-
 lung and the destructiveness of his Cultural
 Revolution.
 Despite these frictions, Peking maintained
 close relations with Hanoi. Throughout 1966 and
 1967 the war in the South was expanding, and
 the Chinese used every occasion to encourage a
 maximum Vietnamese Communist war effort.
 Chinese propaganda treated the 1968 Tet offen-
 sive effusively and ecstatically, even though it was
 far from the kind of peoples war envisaged in
 Maoist doctrine. At the same time, however, the
 Chinese  became increasingly concerned that
 Hanoi, under the pernicious influence of Moscow
 and the growing physical pressures of the war,
 might not stay the course but might prove willing
 to settle for something less than victory. Chinese
 propaganda began to lecture the Vietnamese
 openly on this subject, exhorting them to shun
 "Soviet-US peace-talk plots" and to persist in
 protracted war.

 Thus the limitations on Chinese influence
 were perhaps most dramatically illustrated by
 Hanoi's decision to begin talks with the US in the
 spring of 1968. In fact, Peking ma not have been
 informed by Hanoi in advance.
 In any event, the strong an  in-
 sistent propaganda line Peking had maintained
 against any kind of negotiations was severely
 undercut by Hanoi's decision.
 With the opening of talks, the Chinese re-
 vised their treatment of the Vietnam issue con-
 siderably. Posters in Peking supporting North
 Vietnam were removed, and small-scale pro-Hanoi
 parades and demonstrations-previously a daily
 occurrence-were stopped. Formerly numerous
 and extensive Chinese radiobroadcasts covering
 military activity in Vietnam virtually ceased.
 Chinese propaganda continued to attack the gen-
 eral concept of negotiations as a US fraud and
 hoax, and even refused to acknowledge that talks
 were actually under way for some five months.
 For its part, Hanoi was forced to adapt to
 the change in the Chinese attitude, but attempted
 nevertheless to preserve an impression of correct
 relations with Peking. For example, North Viet-
 namese negotiators traveling between Paris and
 Hanoi continued to stop in Peking as well as
 Moscow to confer with Chinese and Soviet of-
 ficials. Privately, however, the North Vietnamese
 were undoubtedly irritated by Peking's behavior.

 frained from doing

 The deterioration of relations between Hanoi and
 Peking was clearly reflected during the Chinese
 National Day celebrations on 1 October 1968.
 Chinese leaders virtually ignored the subject of
 Vietnam, and, in terms of protocol, ranked the
 low-level delegations representing Hanoi and the
 National Liberation Front behind even the
 Australian Communist Party. Later in the month,
 the North Vietnamese had to resort to force to
 free some harassed Soviet officials at the Chinese
 Embassy in Hanoi.
 Despite the obvious strain, Peking was care-
 ful to express its displeasure with Hanoi ob-
 liquely, so as not to impair its fundamental inter-
 ests in North Vietnam. Chinese propaganda did
 not criticize Hanoi directly for participating in
 the Paris talks, but rather attacked the US and the
 USSR for their perfidy in supporting the talks.
 Most importantly, materiel in support of the Viet-
 namese Communist war effort-including Soviet
 shipments-continued to pass through China. Al-
 though the withholding of such aid was Peking's
 one physical lever on Hanoi short of armed force,
 Chinese leaders seemed well aware that an aid
 stoppage would only diminish Hanoi's ability and
 will to continue the war at a critical stage and
 thus would be self-defeating from Peking's point
 of view. A new aid agreement was signed in
 August 1968, and the Chinese were quick to deny
 subsequent Soviet charges that aid shipments
 transiting China were being held up deliberately
 by Peking.
 As reports from Paris began to point toward
 some progress in the talks during the fall of 1968,
 Peking found public avoidance of the subject in-
 creasingly untenable. Finally on 19 October, the
 Chinese broke their official silence by reprinting
 several 'Western news reports of an imminent US
 bombing halt. They later followed up by publish-
 ing without comment the official US and North
 Vietnamese government statements on the
 ort   ietnamese

 bombing halt of 1 November and the enlargement
 of the talks to include Viet Cong and South
 Vietnamese Government representatives.  Pri-
 vately, Chinese officials continued to denigrate
 the talks but admitted that they were unable to
 influence Hanoi. During the rest of 1968 and
 through the spring of 1969, Peking continued its
 indirect criticism of the talks and further indi-
 cated its displeasure with Hanoi's policy by
 refusing to acknowledge publicly the stopovers in
 Peking of North Vietnamese negotiators traveling
 between Paris and Hanoi. Chinese publicity for
 the war in the South remained at a low level; even
 the 1969 post-Tet offensive was ignored.
 The inherent difficulties of this ambivalent
 policy of supporting and criticizing Hanoi were
 again illustrated by Peking's recognition of the
 South Vietnamese Communists' Provisional Revo-
 lutionary Government (PRG) in June  1969.
 Oriented primarily toward Hanoi's negotiating
 strategy, the PRG was an instrument for which
 the Chinese obviously had little use. On the other
 hand, nonrecognition by Peking would have con-
 stituted an open break with the Vietnamese Com-
 munists, and there is no evidence that the Chinese
 ever seriously considered this course. Even so,
 Peking managed to convey its misgivings by re-
 sponding tardily and by somewhat fudging its
 official recognition statement.
 Otherwise, there were few revealing events in
 Sino-Vietnamese relations in the last months be-
 fore Ho Chi Minh's death. The Chinese predict-
 ably labeled US troop withdrawals, announced
 after the Midway meeting, as a fraud. Though
 their congratulatory message to Hanoi on its inde-
 pendence day on 2 September was perhaps
 slightly warmer in personal greetings to Ho Chi
 Minh than was the previous year's message., it still
 stressed the standard Chinese line indirectly op-
 posing the Paris talks by attacking the US and the
 USSR and urging the Vietnamese to carry the war
 on to complete victory.

 SECRET
 The death of Ho Chi Minh on the following
 day, however, was an occasion for something
 more than a routine or automatic response by
 Peking. Indeed, Premier Chou En-lai's quick trip
 to Hanoi within hours of the North Vietnamese
 announcement was an expression of high-level
 interest and action, and in fact foreshadowed a
 week-long outpouring of condolences and eulo-
 gies for Ho Chi Minh throughout China. Even
 though the thrust of the attendant Chinese pub-
 licity was still aimed at urging the Vietnamese to
 turn grief into strength and fight on, China's
 over-all response went well beyond the level of
 necessary courtesy, and distinctly improved the
 climate of Sino-Vietnamese relations.
 The  attendance  of North Vietnamese
 Premier Pham Van Dong and NLF chairman
 Nguyen Huu Tho at Peking's anniversary day on 1
 October further signified improved relations. In
 stark contrast with the anniversary day the year
 before, the high-ranking Vietnamese representa-
 tives were warmly received by the Chinese and
 were afforded considerable publicity. The signing
 of the military and economic aid agreement also
 contributed to the image of renewed Sino-Viet-
 namese solidarity. In Hanoi, an impressive array
 of the North Vietnamese leadership appeared at
 the anniversary reception given by the Chinese
 Embassy. Indeed, so that no one would miss the
 point, an editorial in Hanoi's Nhan Dan stated
 that "the fact that a delegation... led by Premier
 Pham Van Dong (went to Peking)... clearly shows
 that our people pay great importance to the
 friendship and militant solidarity between the
 peoples of the two countries, and have made
 untiring efforts to enhance it."
 More significantly, these signals of renewed
 Sino-Vietnamese friendship in the month follow-
 ing Ho Chi Minh's death were accompanied by an
 apparent softening of Peking's attitude toward

 A death in the Vietnamese family brings a mournful Premier Chou En-lai to Hanoi on 4 September
 1969. Flanking him are Yeh Chien-ying, a member of the Chinese Communist Party politburo, and
 Wang Yu-ping, Peking's ambassador in Hanoi. Rounding out the front row is the core of the North Viet-
 namese politburo: Defense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap; Premier Pham Van Dong; party first secretary
 Le Duan; party theoretician Truong Chinh; and China specialist Hoang Van Hoan.                9694612-69
 the Paris talks. After the anniversary on 1 Octo-
 ber, Nguyen Huu Tho's NLF-PRG group re-
 mained in China long after other major delega-
 tions had departed, and subsequent sessions with
 the Chinese became occasions for statements by
 both sides on the issue of a Vietnam settlement.
 At a banquet on 8 October for the Vietnamese,
 Chou En-lai for the first time publicly addressed
 the question of a settlement by declaring that the
 unconditional withdrawal of all US troops was
 the sole correct basis for ending the war. Nguyen
 Huu Tho's reference to the NLF-PRG's ten-point
 Special Report
 peace plan in a speech at the same banquet was
 rebroadcast the next day by Chinese news
 media-the first public Chinese acknowledgment
 of any Vietnamese Communist plan for a political
 settlement. A joint communique issued after talks
 between the same men on 15 October reiterated
 Peking's agreement that the unconditional with-
 drawal of US troops was the crux of any settle-
 ment. By containing individual as well as joint
 statements, however, the communique also
 clearly revealed continuing differences in em-
 phasis 'between the two sides, the Vietnamese

 reiterating the correctness of their ten-point peace
 plan and the Chinese stressing protracted war.
 As the South Vietnamese group departed
 China after nearly three weeks of lavish Chinese
 hospitality and publicity, North Vietnamese
 Premier Pham Van Dong arrived back in Peking to
 resume talks with Chou En-Iai, after seeking aid
 and good will on a tour of Eastern Europe and
 the USSR. In Peking, Chou and Pham exchanged
 speeches at a banquet on 23 October, .and another
 joint communique on Vietnam was issued on 25
 October. Though the communique was virtually
 identical to the one issued on 15 October, Chou
 appeared to go further in his speech by omitting
 the standard Chinese call for the Vietnamese to
 persevere in protracted war until final victory.
 Instead, he expressed the belief that the Viet-
 namese would overcome all difficulties along their
 "road of advance"-a vague formulation that
 could sanction various military or political moves
 by Hanoi.
 By introducing something other than Pe-
 king's standard emphasis on protracted war, Chou
 in effect injected some flexibility into China's
 tactical stance regarding the Paris talks. In so
 doing and in supporting Hanoi on the issue of an
 unconditional US withdrawal, Peking has im-
 plicitly become the champion of Hanoi's maxi-
 mum demands in Paris without committing itself
 to the talks per se or to any lesser terms the
 Vietnamese might be tempted to accept. Al-
 though Peking could, if it chose, now support a
 settlement at Paris based on lesser terms, the shift
 in its position to date by no means signifies a
 lessening of its interest in seeing a maximum
 defeat inflicted upon the US.
 Indeed, at least for the present, Peking seems
 to have concluded that mutual concessions lead-
 ing to a settlement are not in the offing. After a
 delay of about a week, Chinese propaganda
 Special Report
 portrayed President Nixon's speech of 3 Novem-
 ber as conclusive evidence that the US intended
 to maintain its aggressive policy in Vietnam. The
 delay in Peking's response may indicate that the
 Chinese  attached special  significance to this
 speech and, consequently, evaluated it carefully
 before taking a position. In any case, the eventual
 Chinese commentary was extensive, perhaps in-
 ordinately so; it even seemed to contain under-
 tones of perverse satisfaction that Peking's long-
 standing charge of US intransigence had been, by
 Chinese lights, validated.
 Peking has also endeavored to maintain its
 hard-line attitude toward the Vietnam issue by
 affording more preferential treatment ' to the
 NLF-PRG than to Hanoi. The Chinese described
 their talks with South Vietnamese Communist
 representatives in October in glowing terms, while
 applying friendly but distinctly less effusive ad-
 jectives to subsequent talks with North Viet-
 namese Premier Pham Van Dong. Additionally,
 the NLF-PRG rather than Hanoi was thanked for
 its observance of China's 20th anniversary in a
 note signed by Mao Tse-tung, Lin Piao, and Chou
 En-lai. By so distinguishing between the Vietnam-
 ese Communists, Peking is certainly indicating
 something less than complete satisfaction with all
 elements of the leadership in Hanoi, and probably
 is trying to further its interests by paying special
 tribute to those at the forefront of the struggle in
 the South.
 In any event, the improvement in relations
 has allowed Peking to play a more active role.
 This was demonstrated as early as China's Octo-
 ber anniversary day in Peking. Taking advantage
 of the presence of high-ranking Vietnamese Com-
 munist and Cambodian officials, Chou En-lai ar-
 ranged for a meeting between them, apparently to
 resolve the interrelated problems of Vietnamese
 Communist use of Cambodian territory and
 Cambodia's withholding of arms shipments

 destined for the Viet Cong/North Vietnamese
 Army. Although details of the meeting remain
 obscure, limited arms shipments are apparently
 once more reaching the Viet Cong through Cam-
 bodia. Cambodian agreement to deliver future
 shipments appears to be contingent upon the ful-
 fillment of promises made by the Vietnamese
 regarding their use of Cambodian territory.
 It seems clear that both Hanoi and Peking
 were mutually interested in restoring close rela-
 tions. Hanoi's point of view appears relatively
 clearcut. North Vietnam has consistently wanted
 its relations with China to be as friendly as possi-
 ble, provided that its independence did not
 become the price for such relations. This desire
 was made specific by Ho Chi Minh's posthumous
 request for Sino-Soviet rapprochement and in-
 creased Communist unity.
 Because Peking's petulant reaction to the
 start of the Paris talks was the major cause for
 poor Sino-Vietnamese relations since mid-1968,
 the improvement in relations clearly hinged more
 upon a change in Chinese attitudes than upon
 North Vietnam's behavior. In this respect, the
 awkward and unproductive aspects of Peking's
 position on Vietnam since mid-1968 are worth
 stressing again. Indeed, it is not clear why the
 Chinese reacted adversely in the first place unless
 they feared that the war might be settled quickly
 at Paris. If so, the passage of time and the lack of
 any Communist concessions at Paris proved that
 such fears were unfounded. At the same time, the
 Chinese probably derived some encouragement
 from Hanoi's apparent preparations for a lower
 level, protracted war as an alternative to a quick
 settlement. Thus by mid-1969, the Chinese easily
 could have concluded that the eventual outcome
 in Vietnam was still uncertain, and that China's
 interests were best served by renewing close con-
 Special Report
 tacts with Hanoi in order to influence future
 decisions there. This kind of pragmatic evaluation
 is in line with the general restorative trend in
 Chinese policy since the Ninth Party Congress last
 April, and with the professional hand of Chou
 En-lai that has since been more evident.
 This turn toward realism in Peking meshed
 neatly with Ho Chi Minh's death, which provided
 not only an opportunity but an extra incentive
 for the Chinese to restore close relations with
 Hanoi. Indeed, the vacuum caused by Ho's demise
 and the inevitable readjustments to be made
 among remaining North Vietnamese leaders cer-
 tainly contain the potential for the more effective
 application of Chinese influence.
 As decisions are ap-
 proached by Hanoi in the future, it seems reason-
 ably clear that the Chinese intend to weigh in
 heavily on the side of those opposing a settlement
 and supporting a continuation of the war.
 The Vietnam war almost certainly looms
 large enough in Chinese eyes to warrant special
 consideration; nevertheless, the adjustment in Pe-
 king's Vietnam policy has also been encouraged
 by China's bitter dispute with Moscow. During
 the past year Peking has become increasingly con-
 cerned over its weak and isolated position vis-a-vis
 the USSR and currently is working to improve its
 relations with Communist states such as Yugo-
 slavia and North Korea as well as Hanoi. Peking's
 decision to enter border negotiations with Mos-
 cow made its overt opposition to Hanoi's nego-
 tiating strategy even more untenable. Indeed, the
 Chinese have used their justification for the cur-
 rent Sino Soviet border talks as rationalization for
 their new approach to Vietnam, maintaining that
 their "dual revolutionary tactics" of negotiating

 while resisting Soviet aggression can be applied by
 "all revolutionary people."
 In important respects, the strained Sino-
 Vietnamese relationship that existed from mid-
 1968 through the summer of 1969 may best be
 viewed as an abnormal period, with the recent
 improvement representing a return to normality.
 From this perspective, the change in China's posi-
 tion does not foreshadow a major new effort by
 Peking to create a second front against the US,
 either in Indochina or elsewhere, in order to aid
 the Vietnamese. For years, the Chinese have
 maintained a low profile of active involvement in
 Southeast Asia. Chinese support of insurgency has
 been limited, partly out of caution vis-a-vis the
 US and partly because of the long-term view that
 the weaknesses of the various insurgencies have
 forced the Chinese to adopt. At this point, there
 is little to suggest that either of these basic Chi-
 nese considerations has changed.
 On the other extreme, Peking's more am-
 biguous attitude toward the Paris talks does not
 seem to reflect any Chinese willingness that a
 compromise settlement materialize at Paris. Al-
 though the Chinese now support Hanoi's maxi-
 mum demands, they still emphasize protracted
 war and continue to demonstrate their disdain for
 the Paris talks. Indeed, it seems very likely that
 Peking intends to use the opportunity provided
 by closer contacts with the Vietnamese to influ-
 ence the post-Ho leadership against accepting any
 compromise.
 The closing of Sino-Vietnamese ranks and
 Peking's public support of North Vietnam's terms
 for a settlement will obviously benefit Hanoi. The
 North Vietnamese, however, still retain their ulti-
 mate independence, and their crucial decisions
 about the war and the negotiations will undoubt-
 edly continue to be influenced more by physical
 realities in North and South Vietnam and by US
 action than by considerations of relations with
 China. Peking's close contacts with Hanoi did not
 prevent the North Vietnamese from deciding to
 go to Paris in 1968, and the Chinese have no
 assurance that improved relations will forestall
 future decisions that are equally unpleasant to
 them.
 In short, basic tensions will probably remain
 beneath the surface of Sino-Vietnamese relations
 while the war continues and its outcome remains
 in doubt. So long as Peking does not increase its
 physical involvement in the war, relations be-
 tween Hanoi and Peking are more likely to reflect
 major developments than to cause them. In this
 respect the end of the war should prove a water-
 shed from Peking's point of view, because rela-
 tions with Hanoi would tend to lose the special
 significance that the war against the US has lent
 them to date. Of the various possible outcomes in
 Vietnam, the Chinese would be faced with, a par-
 ticularly difficult decision if the war were ended
 by a compromise in which South Vietnam's po-
 litical future was uncertain and the US retained
 ties with the Saigon government. Indeed, Peking's
 ambivalent attitude toward Vietnam from mid-
 1968 to mid- 1969 probably serves only as a mild
 rehearsal for the searching reappraisal that Peking
 would undergo in such circumstances.
