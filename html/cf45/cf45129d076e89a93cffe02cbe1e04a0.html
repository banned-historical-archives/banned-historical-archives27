 TIBET AND CHINA
 Introduction
 The present situation in Tibet is similar in many respects
 to incidents that have occurred repeatedly throughout centuries
 of contact and conflict between Tibetans and Chinese.  For this
 reason an understanding of past developments in Sino-Tibetan
 relations is essential to an assessment of the present.  The
 basic factors which have continued to affect this relationship
 include the nature and persistence of native Tibetan institutions,
 the policies of various Chinese central governments toward Tibet,
 and the activities of other nations in the area.  These factors
 have operated within the framework of the difficult terrain and
 climate of Tibet and its rigid social structure.
 The area designated by the name "Tibet" has varied greatly.
 For the purposes of this discussion,  "Tibet" will include the
 existing political entity consisting of Tibet proper and the
 Chamdo area immediately to the east.  The eastern boundary of
 the region follows roughly the upper reaches of the Yangtze
 River.  The area principally inhabited by ethnic Tibetans is
 much greater, but it includes territories traditionally gov-
 erned  by China,  India, Nepal, and other border countries.

 I.  Tibetan Institutions
 The outstanding characteristic of the government of Tibet
 is that until recently it has been a functioning theocracy.
 While religious and political aspects of the government could
 be distinguished, the former were dominant.  Events in Tibet
 cannot be understood, therefore, without some knowledge of the
 Tibetan religion and its coordinate leaders, the Dalai and
 Panchen Lamas.
 The Tibetan religion is a form of Buddhism usually re-
 ferred to as Lamaism.   Subjected to a heavy admixture of prim-
 itive animism, it is regarded as unorthodox by adherents of the
 major schools of Buddhism.  Because the early history of the
 region was characterized by constant contention among petty ru-
 lers, the monasteries, as symbols of continuity and security,
 acquired a considerable amount of political power.
 The temporal power of the religious authorities was en-
 hanced in the 13th century when invading Mongols were converted
 to Lamaism and established a Tibetan government under Mongol.
 suzerainty.  The subsequent conquest of China by the Mongols
 led to close relations between Tibet and the central govern-
 ment of China.
 With the fall of Mongol authority in China in 1368, Tibet
 became largely independent and internal conditions became un-
 settled.  About a century later there arose a Buddhist leader

 who instituted reforms in the Tibetan church and consolidated
 the position of a new sect.  He was highly revered during his
 lifetime, and upon his death an infant was discovered who was
 declared to be his reincarnation.  This marked the establish-
 ment of the institution of the Dalai Lama, of whom the present
 incumbent is the 14th reincarnation.
 The temporal authority of the Dalai Lama was made absolute
 under the able fifth reincarnation, who ruled during the 17th
 century with the support of a Mongol Khan.  As a mark of rever-
 ence for his aged tutor, the fifth Dalai Lama declared him to
 be a reincarnation of a Buddha.   In addition, the tutor was
 granted a large and rich monastery as his headquarters and a
 court was established for him which resembled that of the Dalai
 Lama but on a smaller scale.  Thus was founded the institution
 of the Panchen Lama, who has continued to share spiritual auth-
 ority among Tibetans with the Dalai Lama.   The present incumbent
 is the tenth in the 'Line.
 Both the Dalai and Panchen Lamas are selected from infants
 born within a reasonably short interval after the death of an
 incumbent.  Delegations of religious authorities search out such
 infants, subject them to certain tests, and look for physical
 attributes which are supposed to indicate that the child is the
 reincarnation of the deceased Lama.  The Lamas need not be born
 within the political boundaries of Tibet nor be of Tibetan par-
 entage; a Mongol prince was once selected as Dalai Lama.  As a

 practical matter, however, the search is conducted in areas in-
 habited largely by ethnic Tibetans.
 From the point of view of Buddhist theology, the Panchen
 Lama is superior to the Dalai Lama since he reincarnates a be-
 ing of higher rank.  Practically, however, the Dalai Lama has
 continued to exercise paramount authority, both spiritually and
 temporally.  The relationship between the two Lamas has fre-
 quently been one of rivalry which at times has broken out into
 open quarreling.
 A significant instance of rivalry occurred during the reigns
 of the predecessors of the present incumbents.  A long and bitter
 disagreement was climaxed by the flight of the Panchen Lama to
 China in 1923.  After the death of the Dalai Lama in 1933 and
 the selection of a successor in 1935 the Panchen Lama began the
 journey back to Lhasa, but he died in 1937 while still in Chi-
 nese territory.
 The present Dalai and Panchen Lamas, although they are eth-
 nic Tibetans, were born and discovered outside the political
 borders of Tibet, in China's Tsinghai Province.  The Dalai Lama,
 who was born in 1935, was brought to Lhasa four years later
 while the Panchen Lama, born in 1937, remained in a monastery
 in Tsinghai until 1952.  Their relations have been outwardly
 amicable since that time, but recent events have brought their
 basic differences to the fore. These developments will be
 discussed below in connection with Chinese activities in Tibet.

 The system by which a Dalai Lama is selected has resulted
 in the growth of a strong regency as the center of political
 power in Tibet.   In 1947 a dispute between the current regent
 and an ex-regent led to the outbreak of hostilities and the siege
 of the Dalai Lama's residence by the faction of the latter.  The
 regent defeated his enemy, however, and severe reprisals were
 taken against the rebelling monks.
 The traditional government consisted of two major divisions,
 one to administer ecclesiastical affairs and the other to handle
 secular affairs.  Many principal posts were dual, held jointly
 by a monk and a layman.  Even the command of the armed forces was
 shared in this manner.   Most lay members of the government were
 chosen from the nobility, whose families often owed their posi-
 tions to association with the church.  The families of the suc-
 cessive Dalai Lamas, for example, have traditionally been ele-
 vated to the nobility and granted estates.  The form of govern-
 ment was preserved under Communist domination until the recent
 outbreak of rebellion in Lhasa, at which time it was dissolved.
 A prime minister--often the regent or ex-regent--served as
 intermediary between the Dalai Lama and the Kashag (cabinet).
 The Kashag, which consisted of one monk and three lay ministers,
 was responsible to a "Small Assembly" of mixed lay and ecclesias-
 tical membership whose decisions it was obliged to carry out.
 All government acts, however, required the approval of the Dalai

 Lama before being put into effect.  A "Great Assembly" of about
 400 members representing major monasteries and noble families met
 only to consider important matters such as the selection of a re-
 gent or a declaration of war.
 Tibetan society is characterized by rigid stratification
 based on the dominance of the clergy and nobility.  Since the
 church has been the only road to advancement open to the common
 people, great numbers of young men enter monasteries.  It has
 been estimated that about one sixth of the male population are
 monks, a factor which has tended to limit the growth of the
 Tibetan population and, in some parts of the country, led to
 the practice of polyandry.
 The importance of the monasteries is not limited to polit-
 ical and religious matters.  Because of the large proportion of
 the population living under their control, the monasteries are
 deeply involved in economic activities such as trade and the
 management of farms and herds.  The monks also carry on a sub-

 II. Land and People
 Various aspects of the physical environment in Tibet--par-
 ticularly terrain, climate, and location--pose serious obstacles
 to domination by an outside power.  Most of Tibet consists of
 very rugged, inhospitable terrain, with vast, desolate plateaus
 to the north and high mountains and deep river valleys in the
 east.   These act as formidable barriers isolating and protecting
 the major centers of authority in southern Tibet, which are lo-
 cated principally in the middle reaches of the Tsangpo (Brahmapu-
 tra) River and its tributaries.  Here are located the chief ur-
 ban centers and much of the cultivated land, as well as Lhasa,
 the capital and seat of political and religious power.  Chinese
 activity consequently has focused on southern Tibet, and major
 efforts have been directed toward construction of communication
 links with Chinese bases across the outlying barrier regions.
 Eastern Tibet, or Chamdo, Tibet's second most important re-
 gion, contains the upper reaches of the Salween, Mekong, and
 Yangtze--rivers that flow in extremely deep, rocky, north-south-
 aligned gorges.   On the interfluvial divides of 13,000 to 15,000
 feet are grassy plateaus that permit considerable grazing. The
 northwestern portion of Chamdo is a transitional region--the
 characteristic features of the plateau of northern Tibet merge

 Approved For Release AN4/?9C1A82R00025R000100060022-5
 into the mountain and gorge terrain of southeastern Chamdo. The
 topographic complexity isolates the productive areas and severely
 restricts communications, thus contributing to the political frag-
 mentation of Chamdo, the continuance of petty feudatories, and a
 favorable milieu for, guerrilla warfare.  Communist activity in
 eastern Tibet has been concentrated on the construction and main-
 tenance of the Szechwan-Lhasa road and connecting routes and on
 the control of strategic centers such as Chang-tu.
 Northern Tibet is a vast plateau (the.Chang Thang) 14,000
 to 16,000 feet in elevation, enclosed on the north and south by
 mountains more than 20,000 feet high.   It is a region of Internal
 drainage with numerous large, usually brackish lakes--particu-
 larly in the southeast.  Although extensive grazing grounds--
 mainly in the southern half--support nomads and their flocks,
 much of the Chang Thang is desolate and uninhabited. Except for
 mineralogical exploration and the exploitation of borax, Chinese
 activity in this region has been nil.
 Western Tibet (A-li) is a largely isolated area consisting
 of mountains, plateaus, and the gorges and ravines of the SutleJ
 and Upper Indus Rivers.  Gartok is the regional capital.  The
 principal activity of the few Chinese troops quartered here is
 directed toward political security--a matter of some concern to
 the Chinese because of the considerable trade and pilgrim traffic
 with  India and Nepal.  A recently constructed road connects
 A-li with Chinese supply bases in Sinkiang.

 The climate of Tibet varies considerably from region to
 region.      In general, cold, arid conditions prevail in northern
 and western Tibet while there are more moderate temperatures
 and heavier precipitation in the southeast.  The northern
 plateau of Tibet is characterized by extreme cold during much
 of the year (temperatures may drop to -40?F), great daily vari-
 ations in temperatures, scanty precipitation mainly in the form
 of snow and hail, and frequent    very strong winds.   In the more
 sheltered valleys of southern and eastern Tibet, however, tem-
 peratures are more moderate, permitting a four-to-five month
 growing season.  Precipitation is considerably greater and, in
 some favored areas, reaches 40 inches a year (about the same as
 for Washington, D. C.).  Although only low grasses and shrubs
 can grow on the high plateau, the more moist conditions of south-
 eastern Tibet result in some forested areas and extensive high
 altitude grasslands.
 Climatic factors have posed serious problems for the Chi-
 nese Communists in Tibet.  The Szechwan-Lhasa, road--particularly
 the section west from Chang-tu to where it nears the Brahmapu-
 tra River--is subject to landslides and washout of roadbed and
 bridges during the summer rainy season and snow and ice are
 often problems along the higher sections during winter.  The
 other main road from China, the Tsinghai-Tibet road, is like-
 wise subject to some damage and blockage during the rainy season

 Approved For Release 20&RMIR00025R000100060022-5
 and occasional snow and ice problems; damage is generally less
 serious, however, because of lighter precipitation.  The high
 elevations and bitter cold characteristic of much of Tibet have
 contributed to morale problems for Chinese personnel, most of
 them lowlanders with little liking or tolerance for the Tibetan
 environment.
 The population of Tibet is estimated to be about 1,300,000
 inhabitants, but there are at least as many Tibetans outside the
 political boundaries--primarily inhabiting the adjoining prov-
 inces of Szechwan, Tsinghai, and Yunnan--making the total Tibetan
 population in all of China almost 3,000,000.  Additionally, there
 is a considerable admixture of Tibetans with various hill groups
 in northern Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, and the North-East Frontier
 Agency of India, part of Kashmir, and in other Himalayan border
 tracts of northern India.  According to the Chinese Communists,
 the area of Tibet is 1,225,000 square kilometers--roughly com-
 parable in area to the combined territory of Texas, New Mexico,
 and Oklahoma--but this figure includes an estimated 70,000 square
 kilometers of the North-East Frontier Agency shown on Chinese maps
 as part of Tibet.  The population density of about 1 person per
 square kilometer (or slightly more than 2.5 per square mile) is
 the lowest of any province or comparable administrative unit in
 China, and makes Tibet one of the most sparsely populated areas
 in the world.

 Concentrations of population correspond closely to areas of
 relatively low elevation (generally under 14,000 feet), suitable
 temperatures and adequate water supplies to permit the growing
 of hardy grains and vegetables, and available natural vegetation
 suitable for grazing.  Consequently, the major concentrations
 of population are in southern Tibet in the Brahmaputra Valley
 and along its major tributaries, and in lowlands and valleys of
 eastern Tibet.  Outside of these comparatively few lower valleys
 and plainp,the population is very scant and confined almost en-
 tirely to the more favored grazing lands.  There are large un-
 inhabited areas, in particular the cold, barren wastes of the
 northern portion of the Tibetan plateau.
 The major urban centers of Tibet include the capital of
 Lhasa, located in the fertile Kyi Chhu Valley at about 12,000
 feet--population about 80,000, including several thousand monks;
 Zhigatse, situated at the confluence of the Nyang-chu and the
 Brahmaputra rivers and the traditional seat of power of the
 Panchen Lama--population 20,000; and Gyangtse, located on the
 Nyang-chu River some 50 miles southeast of Zhigatse--estimated
 population 10,000.  Other population centers are much smaller,
 and villages of a dozen houses or less are typical.
 Tibet has countless monasteries that may or may not be
 associated with a village or town.  Although several monas-
 teries, notably those near Lhasa, have 5,000 or more inmates,

 most are small with fewer than 100 inhabitants.   In western Tibet
 near the Indian and Nepalese frontiers, several temporary trading
 encampments are established for several weeks each year--generally
 during late summer and early fall--at which time the nomads and
 Tibetan traders barter with traders from India and Nepal.
 The pattern of distribution of the Tibetan population has
 both aided and hindered the institution and maintenance of Chi-
 nese control.  The traditional concentration of Tibetan political
 and religious power in a very few urban centers has facilitated
 the imposition of Chinese authority.   Most of Tibet, however,
 consists of rugged and remote uplands--the domain of the nomads.
 Because of the difficult and isolated areas in which they dwell
 and because of their mobility, nomadic groups have long enjoyed
 virtual independence from any central authority.  The physical
 factors have proved significant obstacles to consolidation of
 Peking's control over the sparsely populated areas of Tibet,
 through which Chinese Communist overland supply routes must pass.

 III. Economy and Transportation
 The traditional economy of Tibet prior to 1951 was largely
 self-contained. Although industry was practically nonexistent and
 the known resources largely undeveloped, the people were accus-
 tomed to a simple mode of life and there was little demand for
 industrial products.   In general, the agricultural areas of south-
 ern Tibet supplied adequate quantities of the main food staples--
 barley, lesser amounts of other grains, and root crops--and meat
 and dairy products were available from the vast herds of sheep,
 yaks, and yak-cattle crossbreeds.   The only significant dietary
 item not supplied in Tibet was tea, and this was obtained from
 China.  Tibet's animal population also provided skins and wool
 for clothing and shelter, and the ubiquitous yak supplied dung
 for fuel throughout the sizable areas devoid of fuelwood.
 Tibet did engage in trade with India, China, and the neigh-
 boring Himalayan states.   Trade with India was of most importance,
 with the greatest volume carried over the Lhasa-Kalimpong (Gang-
 tok) trade route that. crossed the passes on the border of Sikkim.
 Several million pounds of Tibetan wool was exchanged annually for
 a wide variety of goods, of which cotton textiles, foodstuffs,
 and sundry consumer goods were of greatest importance.   Trade be-
 tween western Tibet and India likewise was important, and petty
 barter trade--normally salt from Tibet exchanged for grains--
 was common to the entire southern frontier of Tibet.

 After eight years of Chinese rule, Tibet's basic
 economic structure remains essentially unchanged.  Aside from
 the construction of transportation routes, Chinese efforts have
 been directed towards a survey and appraisal of Tibet's resources,
 with emphasis on strategic minerals and food crops.   Perhaps the
 most notable Chinese project has been the mining of borax from
 one of the numerous brackish lakes of the Tibetan plateau.  The
 output from this deposit (at Panggog Tso,  located some 160 miles
 west of Hei-ho) is one of the two major sources of China's pro-
 duction.   Since total output is far in excess of known Chinese
 needs, much of this borax is believed to be exported to the Soviet
 Union and the European satellites.   In addition to traditional
 uses, borax derivatives are potentially useful as missile fuels
 and as control materials in atomic energy production.
 Economic progress in other fields has been slow.   A truck-
 repair shop has been built in Lhasa, and an iron works to pro-
 duce machine parts and agricultural equipment is under construc-
 tion.   Three small hydroelectric and steam power plants have been
 constructed at Lhasa, Zhigatse, and Chang-tu, the total generat-
 ing capacity of which is only 800 kilowatts.  A larger hydro-
 electric plant with a proposed generating capacity of 7500 kil-
 owatts is under construction near Lhasa.
 In agriculture, the Chinese have improved existing irriga-
 tion facilities, reclaimed unknown amounts of "wasteland," and

 experimented with the growing of grains and vegetables suitable
 to the Tibetan environment.   The Chinese may be able to supply
 much of their vegetable requirements locally, and the Lhasa area
 reportedly supplies outlying garrisons.   Despite Chinese efforts
 along these lines, however, the increase in food-grain produc-
 tion has apparently not kept pace with the growing number of Chi-
 nese personnel stationed in Tibet.   An announcement from Lhasa
 in  1958 told of the "determination" of the Tibet Military Dis-
 trict to be self-sufficient in food grains within the next three
 to five years.
 Chinese statements that Tibet could provide land for "sev-
 eral million" peasants from overpopulated areas in China have
 been cited as one reason for Tibetan discontent,  From an analy-
 sis of Tibet's physical environment and fragmentary statistics
 released by the Chinese, there appears to be little additional
 arable land actually available for prospective colonization.   A
 Chinese report indicates that only 2,000 to 3,000 acres of addi-
 tional farm land has been found in the fertile Brahmaputra Valley;
 roughly 20,000 acres of potential farmland is purported to be
 available in southwestern Chamdoo  Even it these acreage figures
 were doubled, probably only 75,000 to 100,000 Chinese could be
 absorbed.
 It is probable that improved grain varieties, greater em-
 phasis on and improvement of irrigation facilities, and use of

 fert1lizex's could increase total food-grain output appreciably,
 but limitations of high elevations, low temperatures, a short
 growing season, and inadequate precipitation suggest that Tibet
 is not likely to become another Manchuria to the Chinese.
 No major alterations in India-Tibet trade have occurred un-
 der Chinese occupation, even with the opening of the roads from
 Lhasa to China.   In recent years a balance favorable to India has
 been recorded as a result of the increased Chinese demands for
 consumer goods, construction materials, and foodstuffs.   Some at-
 tempts have been made through trade agreements with India and
 Nepal to limit the number of trade routes and markets.
 Prior to the Chinese Communist occupation there were no mo-
 torable roads in Tibet.  Caravan trails joined the major towns
 and areas, and a journey from Lhasa to Chinese centers in Szech-
 wan and Kansu over the long difficult trails required from two
 to three months.
 Initial work on a motorable road from the east, begun in
 1950 in conjunction with the advance of Chinese Communist troops
 to Tibet, was completed to Lhasa in December 1954.  Construc-
 tion problems were numerous since the road, about 1,400 miles
 long, crossed some of the world's most difficult terrain, with
 mountain passes up to 15,000 feet and river gorges several
 thousand feet deep.   Moreover, maintenance was difficult and
 costly since many sections of the route were susceptible to

 washouts, landslides, and, at higher elevations, ice and prob-
 lems of freezing ancl: thawing. The section in southwestern Chamdo
 where the road approaches the Indian border was particularly
 troublesome, due to the heavy summer rains.   In 1956, Tibetan
 rebel forces apparently assisted the forces of nature, and since
 that time large sections--particularly in the west--have been
 inoperable most of the time.  Construction of alternate roads
 north and south of the main road has been undertaken to bypass
 the troublesome portions of the Szechwan-Lhasa road.
 In 1954 the Chinese also constructed a second road-about
 1,300 miles in length,-conncecting Lhasa with Hsining, capital
 of Tsjnghai Province.  Because much of this road passes over high
 and barren but essentially passable plateau, "construction-" in
 many areas simply meant the moving of a few rocks from a suit-
 able area of level ground.   Serious drawbacks to the use of this
 road have been extremely high elevations and intense cold and
 strong winds during much of the year.  The Chinese have con-
 tinued to improve this road, nevertheless, and it is now the ma-
 jor supply route to their forces in southern Tibet.
 Additional roads within southern Tibet have been built,
 notably a road from Lhasa to Yatung, near the Sikkim border, via
 Zhigatse and Gyangtse.   A road from Sinkiang has been constructed
 to supply their forces in distant western Tibet, but it is open
 only six months of the year.  The alignment of this road appar-
 ently crosses some uninhabited high plateau and mountain country
 that normally is shown on Indian maps as part of Indian Kashmir.

 Although the construction of these roads represents signif-
 icant engineering achievements, they were built at an unknown but
 probably considerable human cost, particularly the difficult
 Szechwan-Lhasa road.  Forced labor has been used, including that
 of Tibetans, and this latter fact has been one of the many fac-
 tors exacerbating Sino-Tibetan relations.
 The key to continued Chinese occupation of Tibet is the main-
 tenance of their transportation links with bases in Kansu and
 Szechwan.  The eastern part of the Szechwan-Lhasa road and a new
 road to the south may enable the Chinese to supply their forces
 in eastern Chamdo, but to supply Lhasa via this route would mean
 the reconstruction of many sections. There is the strong possibil-
 ity that the combined actions of man and nature would make this
 difficult and costly.  The maintenance of the Tsinghai-Tibet road
 is less difficult, principally because the general plateau sur-
 face over which the road passes is far less susceptible to inter-
 diction.  This road is capable of supporting the present number
 of Chinese Communist troops in Tibet; additional measures of re-
 serving the road for military traffic and increasing the number
 of trucks would enable the Chinese Communists to support a 50-
 percent increase in their current strength.
 An air link between Tibet and China has been established,
 with the construction in 1956 of an airfield at Tang-hsiung in
 a 13,900-foot plain located about 100 miles north of Lhasa. Air-
 lift support is possible but difficult.

 IV. Sino-Tibetan Relations to 1950
 Relations between Tibet and the central governments of
 China have been marked by conflict since the first appearance
 of Tibet in historical records more than a thousand years ago.
 In general, vigorous and expansive Chinese dynasties have at-
 tempted to assert authority over Tibet, often by force of arms,
 while less dynamic ones have been content to maintain a merely
 ceremonial suzerainty over the area.
 During periods of Chinese withdrawal, the rulers of Tibet
 tended to acknowledge the suzerainty of Mongol leaders.   As noted
 above, Lamaism was made the state religion of the Mongol empire
 by Kublai Khan in the 13th century, and the fifth Dalai Lama be-
 came absolute ruler of Tibet in the 17th century through the in-
 tercession of another Mongol Khan.   As a result of these close
 connections with the Mongols, Tibet had established contact with
 the Manchus even before the latter conquered China in 1644. The
 newly enthroned Manchu emperor did not immediately question the
 temporal power of the Dalai Lama, backed as it was by the armed
 force of a great Mongol Khan and the religious devotion of all
 the Mongols.   Mongol authority was represented at Lhasa during
 this period by a Mongol king who administered secular matters un-
 der the control of the Dalai Lama.

 It was not until 1709 that the second Manchu emperor, Kang
 Hsi, sent a Chinese official to Lhasa to "assist" in the govern-
 ment.  Certain Mongol tribes, believing that the Dalai Lama and
 the Mongol king of Tibet had become Chinese puppets, thereupon
 invaded Tibet, deposed the Dalai Lama, and killed the king. The
 Manchus responded with a counterinvasion and by 1720 had taken
 Lhasa and driven out the Mongols.  The suzerainty thus gained by
 the Manchus included Bhutan and other Himalayan dependencies as
 well as Tibet itself.  The Manchus enthroned a seventh Dalai Lama
 and permitted him and the Panchen Lama to retain both temporal
 and spiritual powers over the country.
 A strong Manchu garrison remained in Tibet after the con-
 quest, but a rebellion in 1727 compelled the Chinese government
 to take stronger measures.   After that date, a Chinese resident
 was stationed in Lhasa and eastern Tibet was placed under the
 jurisdiction of two Chinese provinces.  The Tibetan government
 was reorganized into the form which it retained until the pres-
 ent day, garrisons were increased, and communications between
 China and Tibet were assured.
 After a further revolt in 1750, the Manchus tended to dis-
 courage foreigners from visiting Tibet and the Nepalese began
 to warn the Tibetans against the English, who were then push-
 ing up from India.  As a result of these influences Tibet
 started withdrawing into the isolation for which it later be-
 came noted.

 Some of the basic elements of later Chinese policy toward
 Tibet were instituted during the first decades of Manchu influ-
 ence in the area.   In the early years of Kang Hsi's reign the
 famous fifth Dalai Lama visited Peking at the invitation of the
 Manchu court: the Panchen Lama had declined because of his ad-
 vanced age.  The succeeding Panchen Lama, however, was granted
 honors by the Chinese government and  his became the first of
 several Panchen Lamas to be bolstered by various Chinese regimes
 as a counterweight to the authority of the Dalai Lama.
 Peking's interest in Tibet was further asserted in 1792,
 when a Chinese force defeated a sizable invasion by Gurkhas from
 Nepal in mid-winter.  The Manchus thereafter forbade any deal-
 ings between the Tibetan government and representatives of a
 foreign power.
 By the beginning of the 20th century Tibet had become a
 pawn in the game being played in the area by China, Britain, and
 Russia.   The Manchus held nominal control; in reality, however,
 no one had full authority, and Britain and Russia were maneuver-
 ing to secure the exclusive right to trade and develop the re-
 sources of Tibet.  When a British request to send a mission to
 Lhasa to deal directly with the Dalai Lama was refused, Britain
 invaded Tibet and entered Lhasa in 1904, forcing the 13th Dalai
 Lama to flee to the Mongolian city of Urga, now Ulan Bator. The
 invasion resulted in a convention which strengthened trade

 relations between Tibet and India, and in a subsequent agree-
 ment in 1906 Britain pledged "not to annex Tibetan territory or
 to interfere in the administration of Tibet."
 When it appeared that British influence was beginning to
 weigh heavily in Tibet, the Manchus tried to regain their posi-
 tion by force and in 1910 sent an army to Lhasa.   The Dalai Lama,
 who had just returned from his Mongolian exile, then fled to
 India for British protection.   The Chinese revolution of 1911
 intervened, however, the Manchus were overthrown, and by 1913
 the Tibetans expelled the Chinese from their territory and ar-
 rangements were made for the Simla conferences between China,
 Britain, and Tibet.
 A tripartite agreement was initialed at Simla in April 1914,
 but China refused formal signature.  The negotiations broke down
 over the question of the frontier to be established between China
 proper and Tibet.  The British and Tibetan representatives were
 willing to recognize China's suzerainty over the whole of Tibet,
 provided China would agree not to convert it into a Chinese
 province and would recognize the autonomy of Outer Tibet--i.e.,
 the western portion of the area, excluding Chamdo.  The Chinese
 were to maintain a resident at Lhasa with not more than 300
 troops; the British agreed to maintain only a visiting agent
 there.

 During the two decades after the failure of the Simla con-
 ference, British influence in Tibet increased at the expense of
 the Chinese.  British missions were sent to Lhasa at various
 times, and trade between Tibet and India flourished.   Meanwhile,
 fighting broke out on the Sino-Tibetan border in 1917 and again
 in 1931, And by 1933 Tibetan control had been extended almost to
 the Chinese province of Szechwan.   Tibetan resistance was aroused
 in part by the action of the Nationalist Government of China in
 including parts of eastern and northeastern Tibet in the prov-
 inces of Sikang and Tsinghai, which had been created in 1928.
 It was in 1924, during this period of unrest, that the ninth
 Panchen Lama fled Tibet as a result of a dispute with the Dalai
 Lama and took up residence in Chinese territory.   Since he re-
 mained in China until his death in 1937 and his successor did not
 return to Tibet until 1952, nearly three decades passed during
 which there was no Panchen Lama in Tibet and the two successive
 holders of the title were under Chinese influence,
 The Panchen Lamas stayed in Tsinghai--a province initially
 under the control of a local warlord, who owed only a tenuous
 allegiance to the Nationalist government at Nanking.   When the
 ninth Panchen Lama dried and a tentative successor was found in
 1939, this warlord apparently saw an opportunity to extend his
 influence to Tibet by supporting the candidate.  This action was
 in keeping with the long-standing tradition of the Panchen Lamas'
 pro-Chinese leanings.

 V. Chinese Communist Control in Tibet
 When Communist forces moved into northwest China in 1950
 the young Panchen Lama and his attendants had already been sub-
 jected to more than ten years of grooming as potential carriers
 of Chinese influence into Tibet.   The new Communist authorities
 were quick to take advantage of this situation and held the Pan-
 chen Lama in Tsinghai only until their position had been consoli-
 dated in Tibet.  After gaining the acquiescence of the Lhasa
 authorities, the Chinese Communists returned the Panchen Lama
 to his former headquarters near Zhigatse in June 1952, in the
 midst of a vigorous propaganda campaign asserting that the Dalai
 and Panchen Lamas were once again on friendly terms.   It was not
 until 1954, however, when both were in Peiping, that a final
 agreement was reached between them.
 The Tibetan government, apparently alarmed at the rapid
 gains being made by the Chinese Communist forces, expelled the
 representative of the Nationalist government from Lhasa in July
 1949.  The Tibetan authorities were prepared in February 1950
 to deal with a Communist delegation in Hong Kong but would not
 consent to a meeting in Peiping which the Chinese demanded.  The
 Chinese Communists opened hostilities in October 1950 and moved
 their forces into Chang-tu in the extreme eastern part of Tibet;
 they then issued a proclamation calling on the Tibetans to

 co-operate.  Tibetan military forces, in the face of the military
 superiority of the Communists, capitulated after only token re-
 sistance.  As the Chinese forces approached Tibet, the Dalai Lama
 left Lhasa and moved to a point near the Indian border where he
 remained for several months.
 The captured leader of the defeated Tibetan forces, Ngabo
 Ngawang Jigme, was named negotiator for the Lhasa government at
 Chinese Communist insistence.   After an abortive attempt to seek
 aid from the United Nations, Lhasa sent a small group of repre-
 sentatives to Peiping to negotiate under Ngabo's leadership. On
 23 May 1951, the Tibetan representatives signed an agreement be-
 tween the "Government of the Tibet Region" and the Chinese Com-
 munist government which provided for the "peaceful liberation"
 of Tibet.   The Chinese Communist forces were thus able to enter
 without further fighting.
 The Sino-Tibetan agreement of 1951, which consisted of a
 preamble and 17 articles, served as the basic document govern-
 ing the Chinese position in Tibet until 28 March 1959.   The
 agreement began with the propagandistic assertion that the
 Tibetan people had "returned to the big family of the mother-
 land--the Chinese People's Republic."  The Chinese central gov-
 ernment was given the right to station and maintain troops in
 Tibet and to conduct Tibet's foreign affairs.   In return the
 Chinese professed to accord to Tibet the right of local self-
 government in internal matters.   It was stipulated that the

 Chinese central government would not alter either the existing
 political system in 'Tibet or the established status and authority
 of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.   Peiping further agreed
 to respect the religious beliefs of the Tibetans, to protect the
 monasteries, and to make no change in their revenues.
 An article relating to "reforms" stated that the Chinese
 Communist authorities would not force them on the Tibetans, but
 that the local government of Tibet would undertake such reforms
 of its own accord following popular demands expressed through
 consultation with the "leading persons of Tibet."  The Chinese
 conceded that former officials who had been"pro-imperialist" or
 "pro-Kuomintang" might remain in office, provided they severed
 their old relationsh:lps and did not engage in resistance.
 Although the validity of the 1951 agreement has sometimes
 been questioned, the Tibetans did not openly repudiate it until
 the rebellion of March 1959.   A case for invalidity might be
 made on the grounds of duress, since the chief Tibetan signatory
 had been captured by the Chinese Communists in the course of mil-
 itary operations; however, three of the other four Tibetan del-
 egates who signed the agreement had been sent to Peiping for
 the express purpose of negotiating.   In October 1951 the Dalai
 Lama, who by then had returned to Lhasa, addressed a telegram
 to Mao Tse-tung expressing approval of the agreement.
 After the arrival of Chinese Chinese Communist military
 forces in Lhasa in September 1951, Tibet was incorporated into the

 Chinese military system as the "Tibet Army District.,,  The num-
 ber of Chinese troops in Tibet has varied according to the degree
 of resistance occurring in certain areas but has probably aver-
 aged about 50,000, the major portion of them stationed in the
 Lhasa area.
 Chinese Communist propaganda has made much of the claim that
 Chinese forces in Tibet have not confined themselves to military
 tasks but have also reclaimed and cultivated patches of land and
 assisted the local inhabitants in the construction of small-scale
 irrigation works.  As a means of spreading improved methods, the
 Chinese Army is said to run an agricultural training course in
 Lhasa for Tibetans and to have opened an experimental center there
 for agriculture and animal husbandry.
 The 1951 agreement provided that the Tibetan local troops
 would be reorganized as part of the Chinese Communist regular
 forces.   Although some senior Tibetan officials have been given
 high rank in the Chinese military command and Chinese officers
 have been assigned to the headquarters of Tibetan regiments, it
 appears that integration never proceeded very far.   Press re-
 ports have referred to Tibetan local military units at major
 urban centers, and the Dalai Lama retained his bodyguard.   It
 also appears that the! Panchen Lama acquired a bodyguard, al-
 though he did not have one previously.

 The Chinese Communists apparently were quite careful to ad-
 here to the letter of the 1951 agreement regarding religious and
 local political affairs.  There was some indication that Peiping
 would attempt to build up the political authority of the Panchen
 Lama during the early years of Chinese Communist occupation of
 Tibet, perhaps with the intention of substituting him for the
 Dalai Lama as the highest temporal and religious leader of Tibet.
 This attempt was soon abandoned, however, and the Communists
 were scrupulous thereafter in acknowledging the Dalai Lama's
 supremacy.
 The Chinese Communists have made a show of not meddling in
 the purely religious affairs of Tibet, just as they have usually
 been careful to avoid offending the religious sensitivity of
 the Moslems in other parts of China.  Furthermore, Tibetan
 authorities on numerous occasions have warned the Chinese in-
 directly that interference with their religion would have seri-
 ous consequences.
 While attempting to maintain an appearance of observing
 the letter of the 1951 agreement, the Chinese Communists set
 about to undermine the religious and political systems of Tibet
 by other means.   These have included propaganda, education,
 economic penetration, and the creation of the Preparatory Com-
 mittee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.   The Chinese announced
 their intention to establish this committee in 1955, and it

 was formally inaugurated in April 1956 under the nominal chair-
 manship of the Dalai Lama.  Technically the committee did not
 violate the 1951 agreement, since it was merely "preparatory"
 and did not actually take over the administration of the local
 government at that time.
 The Panchen Lama and the commander of the Tibet Army Dis-
 trict were first and, second vice chairmen respectively of the
 Preparatory Committee, which included  an additional 48 Tibetans
 and four Chinese.  The Tibetan membership was made up of both
 ecclesiastical and noble personages.  The committee was made sub-
 ordinate to the State Council (cabinet) at Peiping and was given
 the task of preparation for regional autonomy "in accordance
 with the provisions of the Chinese Constitution, the 1951 agree-
 ment, and the concrete circumstances of Tibet."  The committee
 was provided with a number of subordinate commissions and depart-
 ments to deal with financial, religious, civil, economic, educa-
 tional, and other affairs.  Appointments to the key posts in-
 cluded a number of Chinese.   Eight offices of the Preparatory
 Committee were set up in important towns throughout Tibetan
 territory.
 The Chinese Communist party has operated in Tibet through
 its "Tibet Work Committee," which has its headquarters at Lhasa
 with branch committees at other important places.  Before mid-
 1956, no Tibetans from Tibet proper appear to have joined the

 Communist party, although a number from border areas had done so,
 including one who helped pave the way for the entry of the Chi-
 nese Communists into eastern Tibet in 1950.   Since 1956, however,
 there have been occasional reports of "Tibetans in Tibet" having
 joined the party.   It is likely that Peiping has counted heavily
 on party recruitment as a means of facilitating control in Tibet.
 Another arrangements made by the Chinese Communists which
 was not provided for in the 1951 agreement was the establishment
 of the office of the "Representative of the Central People's Gov-
 ernment in Tibet."  This official, Chang Ching-wu, first arrived
 in Tibet in 1951 and has held his position since then in spite of
 appointment to a high post in Peiping in 1955.  Chang is also
 secretary of the Chinese Communist party's Tibet Work Committee.
 Although the Chinese Communists did not attempt to impose
 sudden and drastic social and economic reforms within Tibet,
 they did introduce land reform and collectivization measures
 among some groups of ethnic Tibetans living in Chinese border
 provinces--measures which were greatly accelerated as a result
 of the intensive collectivization drive of 1955-56.   These in-
 creased pressures led to revolts in Tibetan-inhabited "autono-
 mous areas" within the Chinese provinces of Tsinghai and Szechwan,
 The Chinese Communists promptly revised their policies and a
 "comfort mission" was sent from Peiping to placate the inhab-
 itants of these regions, but apparently with little success.

 In February 1956 a serious uprising occurred in a Tibetan
 autonomous area in Szechwan Province, during which the Chinese
 Communists resorted to aerial bombardment of at least two
 Lamaist monasteries which had become centers of resistance.
 Traffic on the road from Szechwan to Tibet proper was interrupted
 for a considerable time, and sporadic outbreaks continued for
 many months,   Peiping admitted publicly the following June that
 the trouble had been caused by an attempt to impose land reform
 and to establish agricultural co-operatives, thus depriving the
 monks of income from their lands and from peasant donations. The
 monasteries had also been adversely affected by new policies con-
 cerning taxation and grazing lands and by the confiscation of
 their weapons, including those placed in temples as offerings
 to the gods.
 The Chinese Communists attempted for a time to conciliate
 the Tibetans.  The inauguration of the Preparatory Committee for
 the Tibet Autonomous Region has held in April 1956, and the prin-
 cipal Chinese speaker declared that "reforms in Tibet in the fu-
 ture must proceed from the upper to the lower level by peaceful
 consultation, and they must accord with the wish of the great
 majority of the people."   In an attempt to allay the apprehen-
 sions of monks and nobles, the speaker assured them that "during
 and after reforms the government must take steps to guarantee
 the upper strata of Tibetans (including the upper strata of

 religious circles) that their political status and level of ma-
 terial life is not lowered."
 A year later, in April 1957, the Chinese Communists went
 still further in postponing "reforms" in Tibet and announced
 that action would not be taken until after 1962.  They promised
 that organizations established to prepare for reform would be
 reduced in size, and that many Chinese personnel who had entered
 Tibet to assist with reform would be withdrawn.
 In spite of Chinese attempts to reassure the Tibetans, out-
 breaks of rebellion continued to occur in the eastern part of the
 region.   In sympathy with their fellow Tibetans living in Chinese
 territory, the Khambas, a tribe inhabiting Chamdo, attacked Chi-
 nese garrisons and seriously interfered with road traffic between
 China proper and Tibet.  Refugees from the disturbed areas be-
 gan to appear in Lhasa in early 1956, and it became known that
 a Tibetan independence party--the Mimang--was functioning as the
 moving force behind anti-Chinese demonstrations.  The Mimang also
 prepared petitions against Chinese policies and presented them
 to the Dalai Lama.  The instances of revolt by Tibetans were on
 a relatively small scale, however, and constituted an annoyance
 rather than a threat to Chinese Communist domination.
 During 1957 and 1958 the Chinese may have intensified their
 military countermeasures in an effort to stamp out the continuing
 uprisings.   In addition, the highly publicized communalization

 movement in Communist China in the autumn of 1958 undoubtedly
 increased Tibetan apprehensions.  Tension was further raised
 by the gradual drift westward of Khamba tribesmen into the
 vicinity of Lhasa, an area where violence had not yet occurred,
 The Chinese Communists announced in March 1959 that the
 Dalai Lama had been named a delegate to the National People's
 Congress, scheduled to open in Peiping the following month. The
 Dalai Lama had attended the initial session of the congress in
 1954, and his visit to Peiping had extended to eight months.
 The Tibetans had protested the departure of the Dalai Lama from
 Lhasa at that time, however, and the prospect of another journey
 to Peiping was probably even more alarming in 19590
 On 10 March 1959, the Dalai Lama was invited by the Chinese
 to attend a function in Lhasa.  The manner in which the invita-
 tion was delivered may have helped to inspire rumors that the
 Chinese were about to abduct him, and violent anti-Chinese
 demonstrations occurred throughout the city.   Disorders con-
 tinued during the following days, and the Dalai Lama was spirited
 from Lhasa on 17 March.   Open fighting between Tibetans and
 Chinese broke out in Lhasa two days later.
 Peiping first acknowledged on 28 March 1959 that a violent
 rebellion was taking; place in the Tibetan capital.   In an attempt
 to minimize its implications, the Chinese Communist authorities
 claimed that the Dalai Lama had been taken from Lhasa under

 CONFIDENTIAL
 Approved For Release 2005/04/19 : CIA-RDP82R00025R000100060022-5
 duress by the rebels. On the grounds that the Tibetans had, by
 their own actions, abrogated the Sino-Tibetan Agreement of 1951,
 Peiping declared the Tibetan government dissolved, turned over
 its authority to the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Auton-
 omous Region, and "temporarily" named the Panchen Lama chairman--
 a position nominally held by the Dalai Lama.  Chinese Communist
 armed forces in Tibet were enjoined to "thoroughly stamp out" the
 rebellion.   It was claimed that the revolt involved "only about
 20,000"" insurgents in southern Tibet and other "very remote
 places" in Tibet and western China.
 The Panchen Lama was sent to Peiping in April 1959 as a del-
 egate to the National People's Congress.  He was elected to its
 presidium and spoke out strongly in support of Peiping's action
 in suppressing the Lhasa revolt.  Before leaving Tibet, he had
 called for the regimentation of ecclesiastical and secular mem-
 bers of Tibetan society and requested that they assist Chinese
 Army units.  The Panchen Lama also suggested that reluctant
 acquiescence in Chinese Communist policies would no longer be
 tolerated, as "willingness to follow the path of socialism" is
 now mandatory for all Tibetans.
 On 31 March the Dalai Lama entered India, where he was granted
 asylum as a religious leader. While the Chinese Communists have
 at their disposal ample military strength to quell the rebellion
 within Tibet, the presence of the Dalai Lama in India will pro-
 vide a continuing reminder of the rebellion and its implications.

 VI. International Aspects
 Outbreaks of rebellion against Chinese Communist authori-
 ty.will probably continue for some time in Tibet and Tibetan-
 inhabited areas of China but will not present a serious in-
 ternal threat to the stability of the Peiping regime.  Out-
 side Communist China, however, the revolts and the repressive
 measures by which Peiping has quelled them have damaged its
 prestige among the Afro-Asian countries.
 Peiping had entered into two international agreements
 which contain provisions regarding the status of "the Tibet
 region of China."  A treaty concluded with India in 1954
 governs the conditions under which trade and travel would be
 carried on between territories under the jurisdiction of India
 and Tibet, and a similar treaty was negotiated with sepal in
 1956.   Both treaties permitted continuation of the locally
 important traditional trade across the southern borders of
 Tibet and the travel of Buddhist and Hindu pilgrims to holy
 places.   New Delhi agreed to turn over Indian-owned postal and
 telegraph facilities to the Chinese, and both India and Nepal
 agreed to withdraw military escort forces which they had main-
 tained in Tibet.   The signatories were also authorized to set
 up trade agencies in specified places.
 In these treaties India and Nepal acknowledged Chinese
 sovereignty over Tibet, with the provision that the traditional
 - 35 -

 CONFIDENTIAL
 Approved For Release 2005/04/19 : CIA-RDP82R00025R000100060022-5
 Tibetan government would continue to administer local affairs.
 Indian and Nepalese representatives at Lhasa became consuls
 general accredited to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 rather than to the Tibetan government.   The treaties subscribed
 to the "five principles of peaceful coexistence" (Panch Shila),
 which include mutual "noninterference in interal affairs."
 Even before the Dalai Lama had been granted asylum in
 India, Prime Minister Nehru had publicly expressed concern
 over the situation in Tibet and sympathy with the rebels, but
 without violating India's pledge of "noninterference."  Nehru
 reiterated his government's hands-off policy toward the "Tibet
 region of China" before an aroused parliament on 23 March 1959,
 but his statement by implication put Peiping on notice that he
 regarded Chinese failure to respect Tibet's "autonomous"  status
 as a violation of previous assurances.   The Indian Parliament
 and press urged a much stronger stand than that publicly assumed
 by the government.
 Peiping on 28 March accused India of permitting a "central
 headquarters" of the Tibetan revolt to operate'at Kalimpong in
 the Indian state of West Bengal.   The Chinese Communist communi-
 que                     implied that further discussion of Tibet in the Indian
 Parliament would be "impolite and improper."  These charges
 were sharply rejected by Nehru with the comment that his gov-
 ernment would not "submit to any kind of dictation from any.

 CONFIDENTIAL

 country."  His statement was balanced, however, with a plea
 for restraint and a reaffirmation of friendship for China.
 After these initial exchanges of charges and rejections,
 it appeared for a time that Peiping would treat Indian sensi-
 tivities with greater regard, perhaps in the hope of inducing
 the Indian government to restrain the Dalai Lama from making
 public statements refuting Peiping's claims as to the nature
 of his flight.  After the Dalai Lama's statement of 18 April,
 when he denied that' he had left Tibet under duress, Chinese
 Communist attacks on the.Indian government became more intem-
 perate and carried hints that India must not permit the Dalai
 Lama to engage in political activity.   Peiping did not, however,
 make a formal diplomatic protest to India.
 One of the strongest  Asian reactions to events in Tibet
 came from Malaya, where the foreign minister officially con-
 demned the Chinese use of force and likened it to Soviet re-
 pression in Hungary.                           Cambodia's Premier, Prince Sihanouk, was
 quoted in France as expressing surprise that India was not
 firmer in exercising its "moral duty" to uphold the Tibetan
 cause.
 Buddhist circles in Ceylon strongly protested Chinese
 Communist actions in Tibet.   A delegation of Buddhist per-
 sonages of high rank attempted to gain a hearing at the Chi-
 nese embassy in Colurbo but was refused admittance, bringing
 further unfavorable publicity to the Chinese.

 Sections of the press in Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan,
 the Philippines, Japan, and the United Arab Republic have
 voiced protests, some of them in publications which had pre-
 viously tended to be uncritical of the Chinese Communist re-
 gime.   The Japanese press has given the Tibetan developments
 especially heavy play, almost unanimously criticizing the sup-
 pression of the revolt and Peiping's callous disregard for its
 understandings with the Indian and Tibetan governments.  Cairo
 radio joined the UAR press in denouncing Chinese repression in
 Tibet as "the new imperialism."
 While India will not permit the Dalai Lama to carry on
 political activities during his residence there, his status
 as a refugee from Chinese Communist oppression cannot fail
 to have political as well as religious implications.   His
 flight from Tibet and Peiping's dissolution of the Tibetan
 government have done more than any other development to dam-
 age the image of Communist China as champion of freedom for
 the Afro-Asian nations--an image the regime has been trying
 to set up in the four years since the-Bandung Conference.
