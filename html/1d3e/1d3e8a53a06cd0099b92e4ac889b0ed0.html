March 3, 196u ? CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX A1123 - 
Under unanimous consent, I include 
the editorial at this point: 
R.F.K. USES THE LINCOLN PLOY 
We have seen the trick used over and 
over and over again, until we are so annoyed 
with misrepresentation that we can't let it 
pass any longer, unimportant though the de-
tail may be. 
We mean the persistent practice of folks 
raising some form of fuss about the Vietnam 
war, claiming the "precedent" of Abraham 
Lincoln and his famous speech in criticism 
of the Mexican War. 
BOBBY KENNEDY is the latest to do so. His 
recent speech that caused a bit of fuss led 
off with 2 pages of apologia on the virtues of 
dissent even in time of war and again cited 
Lincoln's alleged example, rapping the Polk 
administration in the "war of 1848." 
But there wasn't any war in 1818. 
It was over. 
The Mexicans had been beaten on every 
field. Our troops were occupying Mexico 
City. A new election started the year 1848 
with a new Mexican "peace president" and 
peace negotiations began at once. 
We were already completely and totally vic-
torious in that war before Lincoln rose to 
criticize in a speech that couldn't possibly 
affect American forces in the field or the 
character of the Mexican re,sistance and could 
only have been aimed at demanding a fair 
and reasonable peace treaty for the defeated 
Mexican nation. 
The fact of history is that Lincoln held 
his tongue throughout the period of actual 
fighting and waited until our arms were not 
affected before he made his criticism. 
And that's the precedent that has been re-
peated and falsely cited as justifying remarks 
being made today in the midst of battle at a 
time when they have been welcomed as en-
couragement by the enemy in the field. 
If anyone were really, honestly, concerned 
to follow Lincoln's example they would, in 
fact, keep their mouths shut in these cir-
cumstances. He did. 
Yet they have either the nerve, or the un-
scrupulous trickery, or the historical stupid-
ity to actually claim "Lincoln's action" as 
an excuse for their own. 
It's irritating, but we admit, beside the 
point. 
There is not any question at all about the 
right to find fault in war as in peace. You 
can verbally attack the United States even 
though it does encourage the enemy in the 
midst of bitter fighting. 
And, then, in turn you can also be at-
tacked for your position on the matter?by 
the same principle, and right, and guaran-
teed freedom. 
Your responsibility then is to defend your 
position?not holler "foul" ?or cite a phony 
"example" in Lincoln. 
We haven't heard anybody deny the fact 
that Ho Chi Minh has been encouraged by 
the seeming confusion, uncertainty, and 
fears thus expressed in the United States, to 
the point that he has publicly given thanks 
for them, and has cited them as evidence 
that the Vietcong should keep on fighting 
and refusing to negotiate. 
No. They just want to howl?"But we have 
a right to speak up." 
Sure, you do. That's beside the point. 
The question is not if you have such a right, 
but are you doing the right thing when you 
make use of it to give aid and encourage-
ment to the enemy and to prolong the war 
in which Americans are fighting and dying 
at the behest of their country as required 
of them by those legally elected to make 
such decisions? 
And you surely don't have a right to snug-
gle up to Lincoln?he plainly did not think 
such conduct was right.

EXTENSION OF REMARK 
OF 
HON. TENO RONCALIO 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 1966 
Mr. RONCALIO. Mr. Speaker, an edi-
torial from the Cheyenne, Wyo., Eagle 
seems typical of many which I have 
read recently. It states that it believes 
"the vast majority of Americans under-
stand and support the President in his 
policy of 'prudent firmness under care-
ful control' while pursuing a diplomatic 
search for an honorable peace." 
The paper recognizes that "President 
Johnson has left, is leaving no stone un-
turned in his efforts to move the Viet-
nam conflict from the battlefield to the 
conference table. And he has made it 
abundantly clear, over and over, that the 
United States will not be pushed out of 
Vietnam by force of arms." 
The article to which I refer clarifies 
some issues which concern us so urgently 
at this time, and with the permission of 
my colleagues I offer the editorial for the 
RECORD: 
GOALS UNDERSCORED 
By now, everyone in this Nation, and most 
of the leaders throughout the world, should 
understand our goals and purposes in Viet-
nam, our reasons for being there, and our 
determination to stay until aggression from 
the north has stopped. 
President Johnson has left, is leaving no 
stone unturned in his efforts to move the 
Vietnam conflict from the battlefield to the 
conference table. And he has made it 
abundantly clear, over and over, that the 
United States will not be pushed out of Viet-
nam by force of arms. 
In his state of the Union message, delivered 
during the 37-day bombing lull, the Presi-
dent said: 
"We do not intend to abandon Asia to con-
quest." 
He pointed out "our decision to stand firm 
has been matched by our desire for peace." 
And he stated: 
"Until peace comes, or if it does not come, 
our course is clear. We will act as we must 
to help protect the independence of the 
valiant people of South Vietnam. We will 
strive to limit conflict, for we wish neither 
increased destruction nor increased danger. 
"But we will give our fighting men what 
they must have; every gun, every dollar, and 
every decision?whatever the cost and what-
ever the challenge." 
Wednesday, the President again under-
scored U.S. goals in southeast Asia, pledging 
a continued military course of "prudent firm-
ness under careful control" while pursuing 
a diplomatic search for an honorable peace. 
"We will build freedom while we fight," he 
said, "and we will seek peace every day by 
every honorable means. But we will per-
severe along the high, hard road of freedom." 
He said that, already, "the tide of the 
battle has turned" against the Communists. 
And he reminded North Vietnam his offer 
of unconditional peace talks still stands. 
He assured critics here at home that "there 
is not, and there will not be, a mindless 
escalation." 
"We have threatened no one?and we will 
not," he said. "We seek the end of no 
regime?and will not. 
"Our purpose is solely to defend against 
aggression. To any armed attack, we will 
reply." 
"Men ask who has a right to rule in Viet-
nam. Our answer there is what is has been 
here for 200 years; the people must have this 
right?the South Vietnamese people?and no 
one else. Washington will not impose upon 
the people of South Vietnam a government 
not of their choice. Hanoi shall not impose 
upon the people of South Vietnam a govern-
ment not of their choice." 
Still with us, of course, are those who 
would have us plunge forward in a "mind-
less escalation" of the war. 
Some urge unlimited bombing, regardless 
of what effect it might have upon world opin-
ion, and apparently without concern over the 
question of whether it might bring China or 
Russia into the war. 
On the other hand, some would have us 
turn our backs on our commitments?pull 
out of southeast Asia and leave South Viet-
nam, and perhaps other countries, at the 
mercy of the Communists. The utter folly of 
this course should be obvious to all. 
Fortunately, the man with the responsibil-
ity is the President of the United States. 
The decisions are his, and he has the advice 
and assistance of the best experts available. 
We believe the vast majority of Americans 
understand and support the President in his 
policy of "prudent firmness under careful 
control" while pursuing a diplomatic search 
for an honorable peace. 
Business Citizenship Competition by the 
American Security Council 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 1966 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, be-
ginning today the American Security 
Council, nationally and internationally 
renowned for its sober analyses and proj-
ects regarding the cold war, is conduct-
ing a unique contest open to all Ameri-
cans with respect to the role of business 
of the cold war. Awards amounting to 
$100,000 are being offered for the best 
papers and articles on this vital subject. 
There are many of us who have felt 
that the United States had not exploited 
to the full its economic power in turning 
the scales against the Red totalitarian 
network in this incessant cold war. Also, 
the actual and potential losses of con-
structive American investments abroad, 
as for example in Cuba and Venezuela 
respectively, have not been soberly as-
sessed by our dynamic entrepreneurs. 
It is questionable, too, that private 
enterprise with its tremendous genius for 
technological revolution has been fully 
appreciated as a formidable weapon for 
freedom. In addition, the generally 
neutralist attitude of American business 
in the cold war ' is another angle calling 
for intensive analysis. These and many 
other basic points are ideas deserving of 
careful study, which this unique contest 
provides the opportunity for. 
For the benefit of all Americans, I in-
sert the release on "$100,000 for Best 
Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67600446R000400050006-7

:01Tie cad the current conflict a cold war. 
It is also a psychological hot war, waged by 
communism to shape and Influence the ac-
tions of free men.. The Communist takeover 
of Cuba is a good. example Of this kind of war. 
Most Cubans and Americans were fooled by 
the false picture of Castro the liberator?a 
composite of Simon Bolivar and George 
Washington. Not until Cubans had lost 
their freedcm was he revealed as ii tool of 
communism. 
We understand, react to, and repel attacks

Our challenge is to find the most effective 
way of recruiting and using the talents and 
resources of business in the global oattle for

BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE CONFLICT 
Private enterprise and. all Americans de-
pendent upon it for their livelihood suffer 
every time the free world gives ground to

be it in Cunia, the Far :East? or Latin America, 
the danger to the remaining free world in-

Countering communism is the re, ponsibil-

meat alone. 
No one :snows this better than President 
Johnson, vtin recently said, "The qeat ma-
jority cif o ir citizens, I believe, we et to un-
derstand tile form and fashion of the chal-

that need, the President said there is "not

ship of business * * * in providing :Americans 
with * * * sound information on which they 
can rely and from winch they can make their 
own decisions as to the rightness or wrong-
ness of the paths we pursue in the search for

And in ;1 :formal report on cold Tic educa-
tion, the C-overnors of our 50 State t reminded 
businesses that "the American right to en-

REFORMS HAILED 
(Mr. HANSEN of Iowa (at the request

matter.) 
Mr. HANSEN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, 
President Johnson's plan to intensify 
political, social, and economic reforms, 
with particular stress on rural recon-
struction in South Vietnam, is hailed in 
a recent article appearing in the maga-
zine of Wall Street. 
The writer, John Scott, quite candidly 
points out that there is good reason for 
the President's insistence that major 
emphasis now be placed on this effort. 
The informative and frank article con-
cludes with the opinion: 
President Johnson is moving cautiously 
but firmly to apply more and more military 
pressure in Vietnam. Now he is moving to 
bring the reconstruction effort up to the 
level of the war effort. This is a balanced 
and sane approach to the problem which re-
jects the counsels of extremism at either end 
of the spectrum. 
Knowing that many will want to read 
this frank and informative article from 
start to finish, I suggest that it be pub-
lished in the RECORD: 
THE ANSWER TO VICTORY IN VIETNAM 
(By John Scott) 
The most important result of the Honolulu 
Conference between President Johnson and 
the leaders of South Vietnam was the strong 
joint commitment to intensify political, 
social, and economic reforms, with particular 
stress on "rural reconstruction." 
There was good reason for the President's 
Insistence that major emphasis now be placed 
on this effort. The failure so far of United 
States and South Vietnamese officials to 
achieve any significant improvement in the 
lot of the peasants in most of the Govern-
ment-held areas is the Achilles heel of the 
anti-Communist effort in Vietnam. 
A year ago, when the South Vietnamese 
military effort appeared to be on the verge of 
collapse, the major emphasis had to be placed 
on increasing U.S. military strength. The 
first priority naturally was to avert military 
disaster. Economic, medical, and educa-
tional programs had to take second place. 
SO PAR 
Novi American armed strength has been in-
creased from 25,000 a year ago to more than 
200,000 and more troops are going in all the 
time. North Vietnam has been brought 
under limited U.S. aerial attacks to show the 
Hanoi regime that it will not enjoy a privi-
leged sanctuary while engaging in the effort 
to overthrow the Government in the south. 
In the words of Defense Secretary Robert 
McNamara, "we have stopped losing the war." 
While we are a long way from "winning" 
the war?and the Communists spurn all bids 
to talk peace?we are in a position to devote 
vastly more time, men and money to the 
reconstruction programs necesary for any 
lasting success. 
WI-IT HO CHI MINIS HAS THE EDGE 
The necessity to bring about a rather dra-
matic improvement in the social, economic, 
and political situation of the rural areas 
under control of the Saigon government is 
particularly acute because the background of 
the struggle in Vietnam since 1946. 
President Ho Chi Minh of Communist 
North Vietnam has a far greater influence 
on the.peasants in South Vietnam than many 
Americans realize. He was the "George 
ashington" who led them to independence 
In 1954 after a long and bitter struggle 
against the French. He still is revered by 
many millions of peasants in the south who 
haven't the vaguest idea what "communism" 
Is and don't particularly care. 
On their list of priorities, food and cloth-
ing, housing, and a bare education, are the 
top items. Ideological considerations are 
away down the list. 
From their standpoint, there is little dif-
ference between the Saigon government and 
the Vietcong. When "Uncle Ho" tells them 
everything will be better if they support the 
Vietcong in its effort to run the Americans _ 
out and destroy the Saigon government, 
they are inclined to believe him, 
THE COMMONSENSE ANSWER 
The United States and the Saigon govern-
ment can overcame this problem only by 
improving living conditions in Government-
held areas and areas reclaimed by the 
Government dramatically enough to demon-
strate the advantages of life in non-Com-
munist territory. A successful program 
along this line not only will erode peasant 
support for the Vietcong but broaden sup-
port for the Saigon government and give it 
a stability it has not been able to achieve 
since the overthrow and murder of the late 
President Ngo Dinh Diem. 
The task is not going to be easy. While 
the Saigon government has dominion over 
the majority of people in South Vietnam, 
because it holds the big cities, it is in con-
trol of only one-fourth of the territory. 
The Vietcong and their North Vietnamese 
colleagues hold about one-fourth of the 
area. 
The remaining one-half of the land in 
South Vietnam is a sort of "no-man's land," 
penetrated by military forces of both sides 
but held by neither. 
It is in this vast "no-man's land" that 
the Saigon government, with U.S. military 
support, must hack out its gains and con-
solidate them by swift application of recon-
struction measures which will enlist 
the wholehearted support of the local 
inhabitants. 
CONSIDERATIONS THAT MOVED PRESIDENT 
JOHNSON 
It is clear then why President Johnson 
felt it time to raise the reconstruction cam-
paign to a level of equal importance with 
the military effort. The joint communique

4676 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE March 3, 1066 
issued in Honolulu spelled out "three par-
ticular points" in the reconstruction pro-
gram as being "essential for rapid progress": 
1. Continued emphasis by both Vietna-
mese and allied forces on the effort to build 
democracy in the rural areas?an effort as 
important as the military battle itself. 
"2. Continued emphasis on the design of 
rural reconstruction work to meet the peo-
ple's need for larger output, more efficient 
production, improved credit, handicrafts 
and light industry, and rural electrification. 
"3. Concentration of resources?both Viet-
namese and American--in selected priority 
areas which are properly related to military 
plans so that the work of rural reconstruc-
Lion ean be protected against disruption by 
the enemy." 
President Johnson returned from Hono-
lulu determined to see the reconstruction 
program pushed effectively and his peace 
cfforts continued along with the military 
campaign. He believes, according to his 
aids, that: 
and Haiphong should not be 
bombed. 
Communist China will not enter the war 
If the United States continues present 
lab: policies are correct and his critics, both 
on the left and right, offer xio practical 
alternatives. 
birr ymi.sinc TO PRESSURES AND WHY 
Th President has been under consider-
able pressure from some military men and 
some Congressmen to bomb the industrial 
installations in the area of the North Viet-
bamcse capital of Hanoi and the port city 
of Haiphong. However, he shows no sign 
of giving in to this pressure, 
fie may well feel that destruction of these 
cities would not end Communist resistance, 
that it might bring Ited China into the 
conflict. 
He also.must recognize that the large civi-
lian casualties would weaken the U.S. stand 
in the eyes of many of the nations now 
inclined to sympathize with Washington. 
THE EMENCH HELD THE BIG CITIES, BUT LOST 
THE WAR 
The French, who failed to hold Indochina 
with 500,000 men, frequently have pointed 
out that they held Hanoi, Haiphong, Saigon, 
and every other major city in North and 
South Vietnam and Ho's men still licked 
-them. 
IN 88M 
Thus?while the French position in 1954 
and that of the Americans today are not 
analogous, there are enough points of refer-
ence to make it doubtful that Ho and the 
Vietcong can be defeated by bombing the 
big cities in the north. 
President Johnson :Ls moving cautiously 
but firmly to apply more and more military 
pressure in Vietnam. Now he is moving to 
Ming the reconstruction effort up to the 
level of the war effort. This is a balanced 
and sane approach to the problem which re-
jects the counsels of extremism at either 
end of the spectrum. 
If the strong words on social, economic, 
and political reform in the Honolulu decla-
ration are followed by strong action along 
those lines in Vietnam, the road ahead may 
0ecoine considerably brighter.

SCHOOL LUNCH AND SPECIAL MILK 
PROGRAMS 
(Mr. K()RNEGAY (at the request of 
Mr. MeGaiern) was granted permission 
to extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. KORNEGAY. Mr. Speaker, the 
President told the Congress in his mes-
sage this week on domestic health and 
education that "a poor diet is a root 
cause of disease." wholeheartedly 
agree. 
I am also firmly of the opinion that 
the roots of a healthy nation are in the 
youth of America. President Johnson 
said that it is hard to teach a hungry 
child. I wholeheartedly agree. 
?We need to insure that the American 
youth be healthy, that he be vibrant, 
that he have the vitality he will need in 
the complex and challenging years 
ahead. We need to insure, as best we 
can, that he get the proper nourishment 
that his growing body and mind needs. 
get, President Johnson's new budget 
calls for drastic reductions in the exist-
ing school lunch and special milk pro-
grams, He has submitted a proposed 
Child Nutrition Act of 1966, which would 
be a new effort directed at feeding the 
needy. There is no doubt in my mind 
that we must continue to help feed 
hungry children who lack a proper diet. 
However, it does not seem wise or even 
logical to do away with a prograM which 
has worked well since 1954. In the 
special school milk program, we get 
more return for less expenditure than in 
any Federal subsidy program with which 
I am familiar. 
Therefore, I am introducing a bill to-
day which will continue this program 
which is now used in over 92,000 schools 
throughout the country. 
The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 would 
be directed only toward the needy child. 
Who is to declare who the needy chil-
dren are? In my judgment, all children 
need milk and it is fallacious to main-
tain that only the needy child would 
benefit from a milk supplement. 
The school milk program has worked 
efficiently for a long time and at rela-
tively small cost to the Government. I 
would like to see it continued. 
SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 
(Mr. ALBERT (at the request of Mr. 
MCGRATH> was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in 
the RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr.. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, at a press 
conference recently several colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle expressed con-
cern about the status of the Small Busi-
ness Administration, alleging that the 
agency had been neglecting the problems 
of small business. These allegations are 
inaccurate and I am most pleased to state 
the facts and set the record straight. 
Under President Johnson's guidance 
and leadership the major programs of 
the agency are operating at record levels. 
In terms of the agency's lending pro-
grams, which is a true measure of the 
effectiveness of the agency, I am pleased 
to report the following facts: 
During fiscal year 1960, for all its fi-
nancing programs the agency loaned a 
little more than $171 million. In this 
current fiscal year, the total lending level 
will be about $718 million. Next year, 
under President Johnson's budget, that 
total will be increased to $725 million, 
more than four times what the agency 
accomplished in 1960. 
It is also interesting to compare these 
figures on a program basis. Concern has 
been expressed about the business loan 
program. In 1960, the agency put out a 
total of $144.3 million in regular business 
loans. Last year they established a new 
record of approximately $339 inillion. 
This year, despite curtailment they ex-
pect to exceed that record, raising the 
total amount to $354 million. Next year 
under President Johnson's budget, the 
program level for regular business loans 
will be $428 million. Again, this is almost 
four times what they were able to accom-
plish in 1960. 
The comparisons carry through for 
every SBA loan activity. Loans to State 
and local development companies in 
1960 totaled $4.6 million. This year 
their volume will be almost nine times 
that amount--$40 million. Next year 
under President Johnson's budget for 
SBA, they will increase that amount by 
25 percent to $50 million. 
In 1960, approximately $18.4 million 
was loaned to small business investment 
companies. This year, the amount will 
be about $75 million and next year you 
can expect a similar amount. 
The amount of funds allocated for dis-
aster lending depends, of course, on the 
need. In 1960, the amount was slightly 
in excess of $4 million. This year it will 
be $220 million. While a comparison of 
these amounts is not particularly use-
ful as such, the disaster loan program 
being carried out in the agency today 
does throw some light on the present 
quality of leadership and efficiency of the 
agency. Put very simply, since Hurri-
cane Betsy struck Florida, Mississippi, 
and Louisiana in September of last year, 
this agency in response to that and other 
needs, made more disaster loans than 
were made in the entire history of the 
agency. This was accomplished at a 
time when the agency's 68 field offices 
were operating the business loan program 
at record levels. In the Betsy disaster 
area alone, they will make approximately 
3,000 loans. 
In 1965, they added a new program of 
loans to improverished businessmen 
which was incorporated in the Economic 
Opportunity Act. That year they loaned 
$2 million. This year they will increase 
to approximately $25 million and next 
year, under the new budget the amount 
will double to $50 million. 
If the size of SBA is any indication of 
importance, then we find that under 
President Johnson's budget, at a time 
when budgets are very tight, the agency 
will increase significantly to almost 5,000 
employees. This can be compared with 
a little more than 2,000 in 1960. This 
growth does not suggest plans to down-
grade or destroy the agency.

sumer?who buys what he must?re-

The cost of living index as currently 
contrived by the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics is faulty and misleading. It fails 
to include the high cost of family inter-
est and increased contributions to re-
tirement and health programs. Statis-
tically, it leaves the individual family 
with disposable income which does not 
exist. 
There are other ways to control credit 
expansion which seem completely over-
looked by the Federal Reserve. The 
Comptroller of the Currency and the 
Federal insurance corporations have the 
authority to increase the liquidity of 
banks and savings and loans simply by 
ordering an increase in the reserves. 
Without raising interest rates one pen-
ny, the lending institutions would be 
stirred into the purchase of Government 
securities to bolster liquidity. This 
would contribute to the stability of pub-
lic borrowing and reduce the rate at 
which the Government itself could bor-
row?reducing in this way the cost of 
servicing the public debt. Perhaps this 
would call for a higher degree of patri-
otism than we have a right to expect 
from our bankers. However, a reserve 
increase policy should be completely 
suitable to responsible lenders who 
should see the long-term advantage to 
national fiscal policies. 
An increase in bank reserves would 
dry up excess credit and continue to 
make it available for priority purposes 
at no greater costs. 
The Federal Reserve policies on col-
lateral lending restrict credit to 30 per-
cent on securities listed on the major 
exchanges. However, no such restric-
tion applies on over-the-counter issues

America has been built upon enter-

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S IN-
TEREST INCREASE MAY HAVE 
TURNED PHANTOM INFLATION 
INTO AN ECONOMIC MONSTER 
(Mr. ANNUNZIO (at the request of 
Mr. VANIK) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. ANNUNZIO. Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to wholeheartedly endorse the remarks 
made by the gentleman from Texas [Mr. 
PATMAN) and the gentleman from Ohio 
[Mr. VANIK]. 
The actions taken by the Federal Re-
serve Board to stem a "phantom infla-
tion" may have actually produced an in-
flation where one did not exist. In the 
area of home building the increase in 
the discount rate which was followed by 
the rise in FHA mortgage interest 
charges have succeeded only in raising 
the cost of housing; and when the cost 
of housing goes up, the cost of building 
materials must go up, and so on around 
the circle until prices on virtually every 
service and product rise. 
I sincerely hope that the Federal Re-
serve Board will not make the same mis-
take again, but I have an uneasy feeling 
that the Board is planning to adopt an 
even higher increase in the discount rate 
and bank savings account rates in the 
near future. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not a lawyer, but 
I will use a practice adopted by many 
trial attorneys called arguing in the al-
ternative. Under this practice, the 
lawyer contends that his client did not 
punch the plaintiff in the nose, but if 
his client did punch the plaintiff, then 
it was only because the plaintiff struck 
him first. By arguing in the alternative, 
I will state that there is no inflation in 
this country, but if there is an inflation, 
it was caused by the Federal Reserve 
Board's hastily concocted interest rate 
increase. 
The United States, as we well know, is 
sailing along in its period of peacetime 
prosperity. For some unknown reason, 
the Federal Reserve Board through its 
economists, self-appointed prophets, and 
ouija board operations have determined 
that we are not in an era of prosperity, 
but rather are in the midst of an infla-
tion and the only remedy they foresee to 
cancel this period of prosperity is to 
raise interest rates. 
Recently, I was privileged to discuss 
interest rates and tightening of money 
with the Governor of the Italian Central 
Bank System, Gov. Guido Carli. In the 
past several years Italy was faced with 
what everyone, I am sure, will consider 
a bona fide inflationary period. The 
Italian Central Bank, following estab-
lished Federal Reserve Board policy, 
sought to solve the inflation by tighten-
ing money. I want every Member of this 
Congress to know that Italy solved its 
problem of inflation by tightening 
money. No longer is there inflation in 
Italy. The country?as a result of the 
tight money policy?is now in the throes 
of one of its worst depressions and Gov-
ernor Carli personally admitted to me 
that?
We might have gone a little too far In our 
tight money policies. 
Mr. Speaker, the Federal Reserve 
Board, by tightening credit, has taken 
the tiger out of the tank and injected 
it into the monetary system. It has 
jerked the tail of the monetary tiger and 
gained an instant response. But what 
happens when the Federal Reserve Board 
faces the task of stimulating the econ-
omy? No longer can they jerk the tiger's 
tail. They must now push that same 
tiger and, like the tiger, it is not easy to 
push a recessionary monetary state bank 
to a time of prosperity. 
For several months the Small Business 
Administration has been under fire for 
Its cutback lending policies, and I fail to 
see an end to SBA's problems unless the 
Federal Reserve Board withdraws its 
rate increase. At the present time the 
Small Business Administration cannot 
make loans with an interest rate of more 
than 51/2 percent. In addition, it must 
make millions of dollars worth of 3-per-
cent disaster loans and many other mil-
lions of dollars worth of loans that bear 
4- or 5-percent interest rates. In order 
to make these loans, the agency must 
reimburse the Treasury for the money 
lent at an interest rate which is equal to 
the current Government money market. 
At the present time it costs the Govern-
ment nearly 5 percent to obtain funds. 
If SBA is required to pay Treasury nearly 
5 percent for its money and then turn 
around and relend the money to disaster 
victims and small business owners at 
rates as low as 3 percent, then it does not 
appear that the agency can go on indefi-
nitely making loans. This same situa-
tion applies to every governmental 
agency or program which is engaged in 
the lending business. The only way to 
solve this situation is to reduce interest 
rates in general and thereby lower the 
cost which the Government has to pay 
to obtain funds. In short, the less money 
the Government has to pay in interest 
on its funds, the more money that SBA 
and other Government lending agencies 
will have available. I urge every small 
businessman to write and to protest to 
the Federal Reserve Board for increasing 
the discount rate and together let us lay 
the responsibility where it belongs?at

Mr. Speaker, I shall not go into the mo-
tives that were in the Federal Reserve 
Board's mind when it raised interest 
rates but only hope that these gentle-
men can justify this increase to them-
selves when it turns a period of pro-
longed prosperity into a period of de-

VIETNAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentle-
man from Ohio [Mr. AYRES] is recog-
nized for 60 minutes. 
Mr. AYRES. Mr. Speaker, the voices 
of dissent have been heard throughout 
the land. Many of these have impugned 
our Armed Forces in Vietnam?inferring 
that they are oppressors or tools of im-
perialism. 
While these voices have not been many 
in number, they have been broadcast 
loudly throughout the country. The 
story of their so-called dissent has been 
distributed to the press of the world and 
has undoubtedly given great hope to our 
enemy. I do not question that they have 
also encouraged him to fight on with re-
newed vigor despite the efforts of our 
Government to bring about a just settle-
ment of the conflict. 
Some might come to the conclusion 
that the morale of our fighting forces in 
Vietnam would be destroyed by these 
dissenting messages from their home 
base. Never in past wars has the Ameri-
can fighting man lacked in support from 
the home citizenry. While we can but 
agree that the right of the dissenter to be 
heard is fair, we also believe that it is 
about time that the voice of the assenter 
has an equal opportunity to reach the 
ears of the people. I know of no seg-
ment of our populace who can better 
speak for the American people than the 
rank and file of the servicemen who are 
serving overseas.

Source: Annual Report of the Secretary of 
(lie Treasury, 1964, and Treasury Bulletin, 
November 1965. 
Mr. Speaker, let, me translate these 
percentage increases in interest rates into 
more meaningfull terms. Since 1952 the 
people of this great Nation have paid 
some $60 billion in excess interest costs. 
This figure is based on the. level of inter-
est rates existing in 1952. This amounts 
to almost 10 percent of the gross na-
tional product in 1965 and more than 
half?more than 50 percent?of the esti-
mated Federal administrative budget for 
fiscal 1965. I need not dwell on the many 
vital programs these funds could be in-
vested in if they did not have to be paid 
out in higher interest rates. 
When the Martin regime took over in 
1951, the Nation's taxpayers were paying 
$6 billion in interest on the national debt. 
Today, 15 years later, this figure has sky-
rocketed to $13 billion. In each of the 
past 3 years, Mr. Martin has raised the 
discount rate on the wholesale cost of 
money to the banks. 
As a result, Mr. Speaker, there is abso-
lutely no hope that Mr. Martin will exer-
cise voluntary restraint. If we allow 
him, Mr. Martin will lead us to total mon-
etary disaster. And the great long si-
lence of the Congress leads Mr. Martin 
to believe that he is free to follow this 
reckless course. 
Therefore, I am convinced that the 
Congress in this session must set the 
record straight. In the next few days, 
( olan to meet with our "unofficial steer-
ing committee to maintain the 41/4-per-
cent interest rate." As you know, this 
committee is composed of 87 Democratic 
Members of the House. I plan to ask the 
c.-anmittee to consider the introduction 
of a resolution which would include these 
points among others: 
foirst. That the Federal Reserve Board 
rii;:;cind its order of December 6 and re-
torn the discount rate to 4 percent. 
Gecond. That the House of Represen-
tatives go on record in support of the 
41/4-percent maximum on long-term 
Government securities. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no secret to anyone 
in this Chamber that I am strongly in 
favor of a complete overhaul of the Fed-
eral Reserve System so that it is more 
responsive to the people and to the 
elected representatives of the people. I 
have introduced legislation to accom-
plish this I hope Congress will see fit to 
act on this legislation soon. 
However, today I address myself to the 
need for an immediate and emergency 
resolution setting forth the sense of the 
Congress on the financial issues which 
cannot wait. All of us know we are 
facing the absolute necessity of providing 
funds for massive military expenditures 
in southeast Asia. This is a fact that 
cannot escape -as. Therefore, I feel it is 
imperative that we take action now that 
will assure that we can finance and carry 
on this war without bankrupting the Na-
tion through skyrocketing interest rates. 
We should strongly consider steps 
which will allow the country to finance 
the Vietnam expenditures on a formula 
comparable to that used in World War 
II, when interest rates on long-term 
Government securities never did rise 
above 2Y, percent. 
Let us riot deceive ourselves. We are 
at the crossroads. n one direction we 
can let the big banks and their wining 
ally the Federal Reserve Board stoke the 
fires of rising interest rates in wartime 
profiteering. Or we can take a more 
rational and sounder position which will 
hold interest rates down and give the 
Johnson administration the ability to fi-
nance the Vietnam conflict within 
reasonable monetary limits and without 
inflation. 
We cannot dodge the issue. We can-
not dodge our responsibility. The coun-
try is watching and waiting. 
Mr. ULLMAN.. Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
join today with my good friend and col-
league, the gentleman from Texas, in 
emphasizing the danger of continued 
high interest rates. I commend the 
gentleman for his; outstanding work in 
bringing to the attention of the Ameri-
can people the folly of high interest poli-
cies and in citing the terribly high cost 
that it imposes on our economy and on 
each of our citizens. 
During the past 15 years, the natimal 
debt has increased by 20 percent, but 
during the same period the interest; cost 
on the debt ;has gone up 100 percent. 
Comparable increases in the field of pri-
vate credit cast the American consumer 
many billions of dollars each year. 
Because of the imminent danger of 
further increases and because of the need 
for Congress to reassert its constitutional 
authority in monetary matters, I intro-
duced a bill on March 1 which would 
require the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System to obtain eon-
gressional confirmation for changes in 
rates of discount. Under provisions of 
the bill, the Board would retain the flexi-
bility to make changes, but without con-
gressional confirmation, they would re-
main in effect for only 90 days. Congress 
would have the power to rescind the 
Board's action at any time during the 
90-day period. 
This degree of congressional control 
must be asserted to assure that the na-
tional monetary policies of the Federal 
Reserve Board do not conflict with the 
combined economic policies of the Con-
gress and the national administration. 
Again, I want to congratulate the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Committee 
on Banking and Currency and all of 
those who have joined in this most vital 
effort to maintain stability in the Na-
tion's banking and credit systems. 
SPIRALING COSTS OF CREDIT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
a previous order of the House, the gen-
tleman from Ohio [Mr. Vamx] is rec-
ognized for 60 minutes. 
(Mr. VANIK asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VANIK. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
take this opportunity to commend the 
distinguished chairman of the House 
Banking and Currency Committee and 
chairman of the Joint Committee on 
Economic Report for directing the at-
tention of the Congress to the spiraling 
costs of credit brought about by recent 
Federal Reserve policies. 
I cannot join those who reason that 
an inflationary Price spiral can be curbed 
by raising the price of money borrov ed 
for enterprise or family life. Our pric-
ing experience since the unwarranted 
rise in the discount rate last December 
has not reduced a single price. On the 
contrary, it has added considerably to 
every item of purchase. For the aver-
age American who must rely upon credit, 
the new house is drastically more ex-
pensive?and so is the automobile and 
the refrigerator. The added interest 
rate paid to those who lend money is 
like a new excise tax on every item of 
purchase?ordered to be paid by an 
agency of the Federal Government to 
private lending agencies. This exercise 
of the power of the Federal Reserve con-
stitutes the worst form of "administered 
pricing," pricing upward for the lending 
industry. 
During the past 60 days, the cost of 
living index continued more sharply in 
its upward trend. It is not coincidence 
that the acceleration of trend during the 
past 60 days over the previous 60-day 
period appears to be just about equal to 
the increase in the cost of credit?
decreed by Federal Reserve policies. 
The method of calculating the cost of 
living index fails to include the cost of 
credit as a family commodity--and yet 
in my district the cost of credit per fam-
ily ranges from 10 percent of family in-
come to as much as 35 percent of family 
income. The action of the Federal Re-
serve on December 6 raising the dis-
count rate from 4 to 4.5 percent had the 
effect of precipating at least a 121/2 per-
cent rise in the interest rate at all con-
sumer level?thereby driving low-
income, high-borrowing families closer 
to the poverty levels. 
Business and industry can simply tack 
on added interest rates as an additional 
business expense, added to the higher 
price. Through the multiplying effect 
of price increases at the production, 
wholesale, distribution, and retail levels, 
the economic domino pressure eventu-
ally crashes down on the family con-

Despite the terrors of guerrilla war-
fare, the penalties of tropical disease, the 
lack of adequate supplies, the bombing of 
his rest zones, the failure of total support 
from home?our servicemen have carried 
on in the tradition of heroism that has 
marked our fighting men in every con-
flict since we first took up arms in the 
Revolutionary War. 
The American serviceman's morale 
has also remained high through the ces-
sation of bombing of North Vietnam. He 
knew full well that this cessation would 
permit the enemy to bring larger forces 
to oppose him and that greater casual-
ties would be forthcoming. In the re-
newal of that bombing, he has seen the 
failure of the cessation plan and the 
realization that the road ahead is one 
that could cost him his life. 
Winston Chruchill said: 
No one can guarantee success in war, but 
only deserve it. 
Most certainly by our actions in the 
Vietnam situation, we are deserving of 
success: Our motives are clear and hon-
est. At one time, we put trust in the 
words of the Communist nations and 
thus placed entire nations of people into 
bondage. The Berlin wall remains to 
this very day as a symbol of the impris-
onment of millions. 
I have not chosen the dove nor the 
hawk as my symbol in the great debate 
that exists in the Congress. I have in-
stead remained firm in the support of 
that bird which has ever symbolized a 
just freedom for all?the American 
eagle. 
I do not disagree with the principle 
of debate. I do say, however, that the 
national interests of our Nation should 
be ever paramount during such discus-
sions. 
I pledge my entire support to our 
Armed Forces in Vietnam and that, of 
course, includes the decisions of its Com-
mander in Chief. 
Just today, I attended the signing of 
the new GI bill. The House Veterans' 
Affairs Committee has always treated 
such matters in a nonpartisan manner. 
I worked very closely with its most able 
chairman, Representative OLIN TEAGUE, 
in the preparation and passage of this 
bill. As I stood in the White House and 
watched the President sign this measure, 
I could but feel that this was a further 
demonstration to our men in Vietnam 
that the overwhelming majority of this 
Congress supported them. 
Before the Christmas holidays, the 
Akron Beacon Journal, with its usual 
concern for the welfare of our service-
men, asked the parents of those serving 
on foreign shores to send in their names 
and addresses so that the readers of that 
paper might be able to send them Christ-
mas cards. I do know that the Akron 
populace responded en masse to this op-
portunity. My son, Frank, who is serv-
ing with the Navy in Asian waters has 
told me that he received a large volume 
of mail. I am certain that the other 
men also received many well wishes 
from the Akron Beacon Journal's 
readers. 
No. 38-8 
I also wrote a letter to each one of 
these young men, from my district, who 
were serving overseas. I wish to assure 
them that I am appreciative of their ac-
tions and that the people of the United 
States of America, with but few excep-
tions, are standing firmly in their 
support. 
I did not ask nor did I anticipate a 
reply but I was most pleased to receive 
a large volume of mail from them. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier in my remarks, I 
stated that no one could better speak 
for the assentors than our servicemen 
overseas. I shall read a number of the 
letters that I have received from the men 
who are serving on foreign soil. I would 
have you note that without exception 
they not only know what they are fight-
ing for but have no dissent with it. 
Their letters have brought pride to my 
heart and tears to my eyes. I do not 
include the letter that I have received 
from my own son, Frank, who is serving 
amongst them, but I assure you that he 
agrees with every one of their state-
ments. 
I hope that every Member, not only 
of this House but of the other body, as 
well, read their words. We can have no 
greater authority than this, for our fu-
ture actions. 
They ask for our support and prayers. 
Can we deny them to them?

House of Representatives, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR MR. AYRES: I wish to thank you very 
much for the letter that I have just received 
from you. It meant a lot to me and to all 
my shipmates. 
Some of the men have received "anti-U.S. 
intervention in Vietnam" letters from people 
back home. They sound as if they don't 
know what is really happening. For this 
reason, your letter meant a lot to all of us. 
I myself wish that all people everywhere 
could live together in friendship with no fear 
of each other. We, I know, are trying to 
make such a world by fighting communism 
here in the Vietnam area. 
Sir, when you asked if there was anything 
that you could do for me, I thought of only 
one thing. I was wondering if you, yourself, 
would tell everyone in the United States the 
whole truth on why we are over here fight-
ing; tell them we are here to help save the 
whole world from communism. I do not 
think that half the people of the United 
States really know that this is why we are 
here. 
From the news we get, it seems that they 
are fighting among themselves over some-
thing that they do not really understand. 
Thank you again for the letter. I want to 
wish you a very Merry Christmas and wish 
you many more in the years to come.

out the time to write to me. 
Everything is going along for me here in 
Vietnam fairly well. Sometimes it is a little 
rough, but it is an honor for me to be chosen 
from Ohio to serve in the Army. 
The only thing that I could ask of you is 
to say some prayers so that we can win the 
war over here. 
I am a little late in wishing you a merry 
Christmas and a happy New Year.

Men like your son and myself fulfill this

I would appreciate your reading it and pass-

Hon. WILLIAM H. AYRES, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR Ma. AYRES: Just a few lines to thank 
you for your letter to one of our men. Be-
ing a GI during these troubled times, letters 
such as yours does much for one's morale. 
Many people in the United States don't 
realize the situation we are faced with. Al-
though we are stationed in Europe, many 
miles away from our counterparts in Viet-
nam, we realize the hardships and trouble 
they suffer. I'm sure we speak for the many 
men in uniform when we say thank you for 
your kind support. 
It's hard for us to understand the reason-
ing behind these peace loving Americans who 
walked around supporting the very people 
Who are killing their sons and neighbors. 
What must it take to bring these individ-
uals around to their senses? Did our grand-
fathers and fathers go through the same 
when they were called up to defend their 
country? 
Don't these people realize that basically 
what the young men of today are fighting is 
just the sons and grandsons of the past 
oppressors. Sure their color and features 
are different but their ideas are no different 
than those of the Kaiser, der Fuhrer, H 
Duce and the Rising Sun. The young men 
of today are fighting more than an enemy, 
they are fighting for ideals and beliefs that 
have been taught to them from youth, yet 
their own teachers are now saying they are 
wrong, that they should give up and return 
home. What kind of home would they re-
turn to if they did this? What kind of 
home would they have now if their fathers 
and grandfathers had just given up? To-

day it's the Constitution?what's it going to 
be tomorrow?"The Communist manifesto?" 
Each day here in Europe units lose from 
three to five men daily who have volunteered 
for service in a forgotten war. Are these 
youths warmongers or just men who believe 
in America's future? Some day these same 
young men hope to raise families and I'm 
sure they would much prefer to raise them 
as they remembered it: TV, local dances, 
stopping at the local hamburger shack for 
a snack. This brings a question to mind. 
What if the one hundred and some odd Red 
divisions rolled across the border that we are 
protecting into the heart of Europe. What 
would be America's reaction, that we were 
warmongers? Is there a difference? The 
hammer and sickle has many faces and col-
ors (as was proven in Korea). We say there 
will never be another Pearl Harbor; will 
there be? 
Sir, this letter all came about because you 
were considerate enough to express your 
appreciation in the form of a Christmas 
greeting to one of our men. Along with this 
soldier we, the men of this company, would 
like to extend sincerest gratitude and ap-
preciation to you, along with our wishes for 
a very merry Christmas and a fruitful New 
Year. Our thanks, sincere thanks, to the

Americans who have not forgotten their 
heritage.

DEAR SIR: I want to thank you for send-
ing me a Christmas greeting. I was really 
surprised. I just don't know what to say. I 
almost feel honored to have gotten a letter 
From you. It sure made me feel good to 
know that you found time out of all your 
work to send me a letter. 
F know my Christmas wasn't the best a 
man could hope for in the way of being 
home and all, but as far as proudness goes, 
don't think I could have been any more 
proud than I was Christmas Day. It really 
hilt good to know that I was a part of a 
team working to conserve freedom and peace 
For all. I think that my being here is the 
best Ch:ristmas present I could give. I only 
hope and pray that this war is over soon, 
so that we all here and in Vietnam can come 
home to our loved ones safe and sound. 
I am on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Han-
cock somewhere close to Vietnam. It is hot 
and we have been working 12- to 18-hour 
days, 'I days a week. We have been here 2 
weeks and we still have 4 to go. 
It's not really bad. I guess it's just being 
out here in the middle of nowhere for days 
on end that bug you. But I guess it's better 
than what those poor guys are going through 
in Vietnam itself. Compared to them. I 
guess we have it pretty soft. I only pray 
that we do not lose many more men. 
I will close here. Thanks again for every-
thing and I pray that your son will come 
back sate and sound. As for things here, 
they are fine and if ever I need your help, 
I'll be sure to let you know. Thanks. May

DEAR Mn. WILLIAM B. AYRES: I WOWd like 
to thank you for sending me a very nice let-
ter wishing me season's greetings. It means 
a lot to a soldier to know that he isn't for-
gotten when he is away from his family and 
loved ones. 
It is wonderful to know what we service-
men in Vietnam are doing for our country. 
But we wonder if we have the backing of our 
fellow citizens who are sitting in their homes, 
relaxed and happy with their holiday, where 
they are free. We hear on the radio and read 
in the Stars and Stripes wha I. a few of our 
fellow citizens think of what we are doing 
here. 
It is the prerogative of every citizen to 
protect his rights, but when we receive word 
of demonstrations against our being here, 
and of donations to the north, we begin to 
wonder whose country we are really trying 
to protect. But there are few people who 
don't realize or appreciate what the Ameri-
can serviceman is trying to do over here to 
try arid keep our country free. 
I always remember what thc late President 
Kennedy (God rest his soul) said, "Ask not 
what your country can do for you, but what 
you can do for your country." 
I hope your son will come back home with 
his family and loved ones, sefe and sound. 
I hope, too, that your family had a very nice 
and cheerful holiday. Well, I have taken up 
enough of your time, so I will Mose. 
God be with you.

today and I must say I was really surprised 
to hear from you. First of all, I wish to thank 
you for your great concern over me, as well 
as the many others from Ohio who are here. 
I know you are a very busy man and your 
time is limited, as well as mine, so I wish to 
take this spare moment I have to thank a 
very great man and a great leader of our 
Nation, as well as Ohio. Thank you. 
feel it's a pleasure serving the United 
States here in Vietnam so that other there 
might live in peace and enjoy their holiday 
seasons and worship our Lord as often as 
possible wherever they may be. I am proud 
serving my country and I will do all I can in 
the years to come for world pace. 
I just hope and pray that my wife, Nancy 
and baby, yet to arrive, will always be safe 
and free from danger, as well as everyone else. 
I love my country, State, and family and 
will do anything for our freedom. Thank you 
once again. Clod bless you.

DEAR MR. AYRES: I Would, at this time, 
like to thank you for the season's greetings, 
which you so thoughtfully extended to my-
self and, I presume, to many other service-
men here in Vietnam. 
Although I Miss not being borne for Christ-
Inas, I consider myself lucky to be baying a 
turkey dinner on Christmas Day. It is some-
thing I'm sure many of the mariners won't 
get. It doesn't seem like Christmas here at 
all because of the absence of cold and snow. 
The only thing I really miss about Christ-
mas is the people. 
Once again thank you, best wishes for a 
merry Christmas for you and your family; 
and may the people of Ohio continue to sup-
port you in your effort to maintain freedom 
in our country and peace throughout the 
world. 
Respectfully,

DEAR Sari: I would like to thank you for 
your wishes, and also for taking time to do 
so. I know that you are a very busy person 
and I thought it was wonderful to hear 
from you. I have never received such a nice 
letter, especially from someone who really 
understands what we go through and the 
reason why. 
We have a wonderful country and it's worth 
giving up 2 years of my life. That's a 
small price when so many men have given 
their lives. I'm here in Germany now. This 
is my first time away from home. I've seen 
enough of this country and how the people 
live to really make me realize how lucky I 
am to be an American. We have a wonder-
ful country. 
I hope very much that your son returns 
home safely from Vietnam. II I ever need 
any help, I will let you know. I would like 
to wish you a very happy New Year. Thank 
you again for your kind thoughts. 
Sincerely,

DEAR MR. AYRES: Thank you very much 
for your wonderful letter. I've shared it 
with others that they may appreciate it. 
also. 
1 can't tell you how proud we've all been 
at the wonderful cards and letters we've got-
ten. 
I'm forwarding your letter, with some of 
the others to my wife and family so they may 
also share these warm greetings at this fes-
tive season, 
What is heartwarming are some ot the 
letters of children. If only all adults could 
share their wisdom and knowledge. 
Thank you again. Wishing the merriest 
of Christmas seasons to you and yours and 
a very fine New Year. 
Very sincerely yours.

and support. I've never once doubted the 
integrity our people are capable of demon-
strating when the chips are down. 
I have watched your career since your 
initial election and I am very proud to state 
that I have never missed voting for you. I 
met you once back in 1953 when I was a 
student of Akron University, and have al-
ways been grateful for the assistance you 
rendered to my father by speeding up the 
arrival of his new wife from Italy. I've al-
ways wanted to correspond with you, but 
have hesitated due to my military status. 
I believe it is "healthy" and beneficial to 
keep in touch with our elected officials. I 
hope some day I will be able to meet you 
again?I would consider it an honor. 
I am proud of my career soldier status and 
enjoy the honor of helping to defend the 
American way of life.

was even known. But I see now at least 
my State is behind me, and I am very proud 
to be serving my country. My only thoughts 
now are returning home to my family in one 
piece. And I pray the good Lord for that. 
And Congressman, I wish you and your 
family a very merry Xmas and a happy New 
Year and for the years to come, very pros-
perous years. 
Thank you very much for your concern 
about me. I just hope my being here will 
help end this endless war. 
And God bless you Congressman?you and

DEAR Sue: May I take this opportunity to 
thank you for the letter that I received from 
you over the holidays. I hope that you for-
give me for taking so long to send this 
note of thanks. 
I cannot explain how glad I was to find 
out that you had taken time out of your 
busy schedule to send a cheering note to 
me over the holidays. It was especially good 
to find that the majority of the U.S. citi-
zens are behind the American serviceman, 
as I received several other notes and cards. 
Thanks again for the wonderful letter.

DEAR SIR: I would like to take this op-
portunity to thank you for your most ap-
preciative letter. I realize that you are a 
very busy man, so I won't keep you from 
your work any longer. 
All I wanted to say is thanks for thinking 
of me during the Christmas holidays. As 
you said, you were in the service at one 
tme and you know how lonely a man can get 
during this time of year, so again I thank 
you. 
I will remember you at the polls and in 
my prayers.

DEAR MR. AYRES: I would like to thank you 
for your letter to me sending season's greet-

Although my thoughts are of my family 
at this time, I still think of the people who 
have sent their greetings to me and other 
servicemen wishing US well in everything we 
do. I would like to say that they are not 
forgotten in our hearts and knowing they 
are behind us enables US to do an even better 
job. 
Although you are my Congressman, you are 
people, and I would like to send my sincere 
thanks for your formal letter and greeting. 
You are helping me enough by knowing 
you are behind me. 
Thank you,

DEAR Sia: I would like to take this op-
portunity to express my profound apprecia-
tion and gratitude to you for your Christmas 
message of December 20, 1965. Such an 
acknowledgement of one's efforts has a 
tremendous reinforcing effect, especially at 
Christmas time. 
I noted that the envelope was postmarked 
in Cuyahoga Palls, Ohio, which is where I 
was born and raised, so the letter seems to 
carry a special significance to me. With your 
permission, I am sending your letter on to 
my wife and children in Dayton, Ohio. 
May I also extend belated season's greet-

that some day we may all enjoy the holidays 
in peace and prosperity.

appreciation. 
I am proud to be an American soldier 
for I know it is part of my duty to help 
maintain freedom for my country and all 
of my people. 
May God bless you for your efforts to see 
that the American servicemen are being

DEAR HONORABLE AND MRS. AYRES: This is ? 
in regards to your letter I received on the 
24th of December. 
I would like to thank you and your family 
for the real nice letter and special thoughts 
and message you sent to me. 
I am hoping and praying that your son 
arrives home safely from the Vietnam area. 
I know how much he was missed at your 
table on Christmas. 
With persons like yourself and Mrs. Ayres 
and the wonderful country we have, it isn't 
much of a hardship for myself to be away. It 
is well worth it when you personally know 
what the outcome could mean if there wasn't 
anyone to defend and fight for what we love 
and believe in. 
I would like to wish you and your family 
a wonderful and joyous New Year. 
Again, thank you sincerely for your wel-
come letter. May God bring your son home 
safely. Best wishes, health, and happiness.

DEAR SIR: I appreciated your sending me a 
letter of season's greetings. In a way over 
here, it sure isn't like Christmas, but we are 
trying to get the Christmas spirit. 
Oh, yes, we all went down to see the Bob 
Hope show. It was really great. They had a 
lot of talent there and it was good to see real 
American girls. It built up morale a lot 
around here. 
Oh, yes, before I forget, I am a little too 
late to wish you a merry Christmas, so I am 
wishing you a happy New Year. Well, I 
guess that's all for now. 
See you in April.

I would like to wish you the very best of

writing. 
It is very encouraging and gratifying to 
hear from the people back home to let us 
know they are with us in thought and pray-
ers. 
This is my third overseas assignment and I, 
for one, am honored to have an active part in 
our fight for peace. 
I really enjoy overseas duty and hope to go 
to Germany when I am reassigned in 1967. 
But it is too soon to think about that yet.

DEAR Ma. AYRES: Thank you very much for 
your holiday greetings. It may sound funny, 
but I am very proud to have received such a 
letter from you. 
Yes, indeed, sir, my feelings are very much 
mixed up in many instances. This is my 
first Christmas away from home, and as you 
know, it is not the Christmas I formerly 
knew. 
I consider myself a very lucky fellow, Mr. 
AYRES. As you told me, your son is serving 
in the Vietnam area. And doing such is a re-
sponsibility to which every serviceman of the 
United StateS is a part in one way or another. 
And I know you are very proud of him for 
his contribution as such. 
And thank you for your willingness to 
help me, sir. But I think with the help of 
God and the situations and surroundings 
that I will encounter while in the Navy, I 
will be able to cope with any problem that 
might come up. 
Again sir, thank you for your interest in 
myself and my situation. 
Very sincerely yours,

yours and their letters made my Christmas

the third Christmas in a row I missed. 
flow is your son coming along? Fine, I

they would. ever get a letter from their Con-

have the distinction of receiving one from 
my Representative first. 
only hope that you will exeuse any mis-
takes which you may find, but 1 had a rather 
hectic day as my first day working alone as

it in another election. I am pleased with my 
choice. I am the only man on my ship who

major fl political science, with a position in

educational subsidies for Vietnam veterans. 
I will be greatly interested in such a pro-

DEAR MIt. AYRES: I just want te drop you a 
short note i:n appreciation of your letter. I 
was certainly surprised to receive it and am 
grateful for your interest in us here. 
I am stationed at Camp Holloway, Pleiku. 
Vietnam, and have been here for 6 months al-
ready. Since I put in for a 6-month exten-
sion of my tour, I have another year to go. 
There is one advantage to the great amount 
of work here; that being, in addition to 
learning more about electronics, time goes 
by much faster. My job is aviation elec-
tronics equipment repair, which I consider a 
very interesting job. I plan on going into the 
electronics field when I get out of the service. 
As yet I'm not certain what field in elec-
tronics I would like the best. Maybe you 
could give me a suggestion. 
Once again, I want to thank you for your 
letter and I also wish you and your family 
a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

MY DEAR Ma. AYRES: Having been familiar 
with you through the early part of your 
political career in the Akron area, I can say 
that I am very deeply honored to receive your 
greetings. 
It is true you can not know my feelings at 
the present. But what you have overlooked 
is the fact that your lot is a heavier load to 
bear than mine, as I am here and can see 
wliat is to happen. But you are home and 
must wait for news of the unknown. For 
this reason I extend my sincerest regrets. 
I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank you and all who are concerned for the 
benefits which have been extended to the 
men in combat. The benefits of which I 
speak are: income tax exemption, which I 
might add, for a touch of humor, we call 
legal tax evasion, and the free mailing serv-
ice. Neither of these are of no great capital 
gain, it's true, but they tell us that there 
are people on top of the ladder, looking out 
for us, and this does a lot for morale. 
As I close, once again thank you for the 
kind and timely greetings. May your holiday 
be happy and may the New Year treat you 
well. 
Very respectfully, 
J. W. BARE, 
Signalman, 2.

Mr. Speaker, these are the words of 
the men who are prepared to die for our 
principles. They have given us an ex-
ample by which we might well conduct 
ourselves during this time of war. 
Before closing, I wish to commend 
Publisher Ben Maidenburg of the Akron 
Beacon Journal for creating the vehicle 
by which the citizens of the 14th Ohio 
District might communicate their sup-
port of their soldier citizens who are 
serving abroad. The Akron Beacon 
Journal is also printing a very fine news-
letter that they are sending bi-monthly 
to all of these men. They have done this 
so that these men might have the news of 
their home community. 
Mr. Speaker, the words that I have 
spoken here are insignificant compared 
to the words that you have heard from 
the patriots serving overseas. Let us 
make certain that they have not spoken 
in vain. 
SCHOOL MILK AND LUNCH PRO-
GRAMS IN MINNESOTA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
a previous order of the House, the gen-
tleman from Minnesota [Mr. Qum] is 
recognized for 10 minutes. 
Mr. QUIE. Mr. Speaker, I have pro-
tested long and loud in recent weeks the 
President's request that we reduce the 
school lunch and special milk programs 
to much smaller proportions than they 
now enjoy. Hundreds of thousands of 
children would be adversely affected by 
this cut, as my colleagues in Congress 
have been quick to point out. Letters 
have literally poured into congressional 
offices, pleading for the continued sup-
port of two programs that have won 
popular approval at every level. We 
have letters from concerned parents who 
have never written their Congressman 
before. We have letters and telegrams 
from school district supervisors, princi-
pals, business managers, teachers, and 
concerned citizens. Almost without ex-
ception, they want to know why this pro-
gram is being cut to help pay for a war 
on poverty that fills local newspapers 
with stories of scandal, mismanagement, 
and waste. They want to know why a 
program whose benefits are obvious, 
whose benefits are apparent and attain-
able by every citizen, should be cut to 
make way for a whole series of experi-
mental programs over which they have 
almost no control. 
In Minnesota, the school lunch and 
milk programs are so successful that they 
have had rapid growth rates in recent 
years. In 1965 alone, participation in 
the school lunch program increased by 
6.1 percent, and school milk participation 
Increased by 11.95 percent. Very few 
Federal programs?very few indeed?can 
boast this kind of popular acceptance. 
Figures supplied to me by the Minne-
sota Farmers Union and the Department 
of Agriculture show the following: 
About 455,000 school lunches are served 
daily in all Minnesota schools and about 
800,000 half pints of milk consumed. 
In 1965, schoolchildren consumed 77.3 
million half pints of milk under the spe-
cial milk program and 61.1 million half 
pints served with the noon school 
lunches. 
The school milk program provides for 
Federal reimbursement of up to 4 cents 
per half pint of milk served. 
Out of Minnesota's 2,850 schools, 2,644 
elementary and secondary schools par-
ticipate in the special milk program, and 
1,673 participate in the school lunch pro-
gram. 
Of the 2,211 public schools participat-
ing in the school milk program, 1,013 
schools supply the milk free of charge; 
626 schools charge 1 cent per half pint to 
the student; 465 schools charge 2 cents 
per half pint to the student; and 107 
schools charge 3 cents or more per half 
pint. 
The 197 other outlets?camps, settle-
ment houses and so on?dispense milk 
under the special milk program. 
Application of a needs test or "means" 
test would mean that almost all students 
would have to pay the full cost of the 
mik, varying from 3 to 5 cents per half 
pint, which would be 3 or 4 cents more 
than they now pay. 
Presently, only a very small number of 
students obtain the school lunches free 
because of low family income. About 4 
percent of the schoolchildren participat-
ing in the lunch program are given the 
meals free, but most of these receive the 
meals in return for assisting with the 
kitchen or lunch-line work. 
As can be seen from the figures, Mr. 
Speaker, nearly half of the children in 
participating schools are presently re-
ceiving school milk absolutely free. If 
they are suddenly required to bring from 
3 to 5 cents for every half pint of milk 
they drink, even if only exclusive of lunch 
milk, their parents are in many cases go-
ing to tell them to wait until lunch to 
have milk, and are not going to give 
them the 15 or 25 cents per week they 
need to get their extra half pint per day. 
This to me represents a great loss. Who 
knows what percentage of the 64.1 mil-
lion half pints will not be consumed in 
1967? Who knows what this will mean 
to the nutrition of the children involved? 
Who knows what effect this will have on 
the dairy farmers? All these unknown 
quantities must be carefully weighed 
against the risk we take if we curtail 
these valuable programs as the Presi-
dent has suggested. 
Mr. Speaker, one-half of a pint of 
milk contains one-fourth of every child's 
minimum daily requirement of vitamin 
D and one-eighth the minimum daily re-
quirement of vitamin A. No one is will-
ing to dispute, I am sure, that these vi-
tamins are essential to growth and gen-
eral health. Children who have come 
to depend in part for their daily require-
ments in these vitamins through the 
school milk program will inadvertently 
be cut off from this source; it is more 
than likely that in many cases these vi-
tamins will not be replaced at other 
points in the child's diet.

4868 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE March ;];, 1066 
Department of Agriculture officials 
admit that there will be a decrease in 
milk consumption if the proposed cuts 
are allowed to take place, and their con-
servative estimate is a 20-percent reduc-
tion. To me, that reduction is more 
than sufficient justification for the con-
tinuation of these programs. When the 
school milk and lunch programs were 
initially devised, it was the opinion of 
Congress that it was immoral for the 
Government to hoard surplus commodi-
ties at great expense when those com-
modities could be doing untold good for 
the schoolchildren of the Nation. That 
precept still holds true. If dairy product 
consumption goes down as a result of a 
budgetary cut to these programs, the CCC 
wiil have to become more involved in 
dairy supports, and the taxpayer will lie 
paying to store dairy surpluses at the 
same time he is paying extra for his 
child's milk in school. This makes little 
sense morally or economically. 
I AM A TIRED AMERICAN 
(Mr. MOORE (at the request of Mr. 
Dux H. CroinsEN) was granted permission 
to extend his remarks at this point in the 
Ecoao and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I believe 
most of us will agree that this past win-
ter has been a winter of discontent for 
many Americans. Perhaps it is best 
epitomized by an editorial entitled "I Am 
a Tired American." It was written by 
Alan McIntosh, publisher of the Rock 
County Herald, Luverne, Minn., and has 
been reprinted in numerous newspapers 
throughout the Nation. Perhaps it may 
some day come to be regarded on a par 
with William Allen White's famous 
"What's the Matter With Kansas?" 
which appeared 70 years ago. 
So that my colleagues may share Mc-
Intosh's editorial, I include it with my 
remarks in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:

THE ROLE OF BUSINESS IN THE 
COLD WAR 
(Mr. FASCELL (at the request of Mr. 
McGaarii) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. PASCELL. Mr. Speaker, nearly 
3 years ago?on May 8, 1963, to be ex-
act?a very significant exchange was 
taking place in room II-227 of the U.S. 
Capitol. 
Four distinguished representatives of 
the American business community were 
meeting that afternoon with the Sub-
committee on International Organiza-
tions and Movements of the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs. The topic under 
discussion was the U.S. ideological of-
fensive in the cold war. 
More specifically, the subcommittee 
was trying to ascertain what American 
business was doing, and what more it 
could do abroad, to advance the cause 
of freedom and world peace: the twin 
goals of U.S. foreign policy. 
The transcript of that meeting appears 
in part II of the hearings on "Winning 
the Cold War: The U.S. Ideological Of-
fensive," issued by the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. It constitutes a signifi-
cant part of a study which is being con-
ducted by the Subcommittee on Inter-
national Organizations since 1962: a 
study of the fourth--the ideological and 
psychological?dimension of our foreign 
policy. 
As chairman of the subcommittee. I 
have been responsible for the initiation 
of this study and for its conduct. And 
I have taken particular pride in one of 
its achievements: the focusing of public 
attention?and the attention of policy-
making officials in the executive branch 
of our Government?on the important 
role which private American initiative 
continues to play in the global struggle 
which has engaged the energies and the 
resources of our Nation for the past two 
decades. 
The role of our private sector was men-
tioned prominently in report No. 2 on

4650 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE March 3, 1966 
When business people learn and live this 
truth, business will have come to maturity. 
This sounds idealistic. Statements of be-
lief and faith always are. But it is action 
that is significant and action is difficult. 
Values must be made real by individuals 
acting an them, and even then, results are 
all too apt to be ambiguous. Throughout 
the corporation, management must find 
ways to articulate and support these values, 
as well as the company's objectives. 
MORE THAN TECHNOLOGY 
Theiefore it takes more than technical 
competence for the successful, responsible 
conduct of business today. The developing 
concepts of administration as I have out-
lined them require an understanding of art, 
the social sciences, history, religion and lit-
erature. In the words of Montaigne: 
We need men and women who know what 
courage is, and temperance, and justice; 
what the difference is between ambition and 
cupidity, slavery and submission, license and 
liberty; by what signs genuine and solid 
contentment may be known; to what extent 
we should fear death, pain, and shame; what 
springs move us, and the occasion of so 
many stirrings within us." 
In short, the nub is education. We must 
deeply ponder Judge Stein's opinion in the 
Supreme Court of New Jersey: 
"Nothing that helps or promotes the 
growth and service of the American universi-
ties can possibly be anything short of direct 
benefit to every corporation in the land." 
We of Xerox, for example, believe that the k 
vitality of democracy depends on free and 
open discussion of the troubling issues, and 
that this is the only means to continuing 
education in the movement of events around 
us. 
This is why we support higher education 
aa fully as we can. 
It is why we try to increase public under-
standing of controversial issues, through 
such television programs as those about the 
United Nations, or presentations of sig-
nificance in man' search for freedom and 
purpose, such as the TV shows about "The 
Louvre," or "Let My People Go," which told 
of the Jews' establishment of a, homeland 
in Israel. 
But the first purpose of the businessman 
is the profitable conduct of his enterprise. 
This is the sole source of his power for good. 
There can be no controversy on this point. 
Yet our experience demonstrates that in-
novative policies involving social respon-
sibility bring very interesting reactions to 
the business as a business. Our sponsorship, 
without advertising, of the U.N. television 
series, brought an avalariche of favorable as 
well as unfavorable comment, and has been 
hailed as a revolutionary action, We knew 
it would provoke much comment. That is 
why we decided to do it. 
An Elmo Roper survey has shown that 
thus far we gained much, much more good-
will than we lost. 
Another example relates to the proposal by 
one of our shareholders that our corporate 
contributions for charity and education be 
restricted to those which could be proved 
to be directly beneficial to the company. 
The proposition, put to a vote at our annual 
meeting, was overwhelmingly defeated. 
The effect upon business of this kind of 
action is extremely difficult to measure. The 
only thing we know with certainty is that 
Xerox has become identified, in the minds 
of people who know something about it, with 
progress, with education, and with the spirit 
of responsibility and that's enough for us. 
THE MORAL CHOICE 
Pioneering on a frontier inevitably causes 
deep reactions pro and con. It could not 
be otherwise. It is the result of the prob-
lem of moral choice which faces corporate 
heads who, like all other citizens, have the 
duty of every individual to work for good 
government and a health of society. It is 
a tightrope over a deep chasm that the 
manager walks with only his insight for a 
balance pole. The risks are great and mis-
steps are inevitable, although we dare to hope 
inconsequential and temporary, if he is wise. 
The businessman must now above all 
other times act bravely with convictions and 
courage to inspire him. And to insure the 
best of his service, society must allow, indeed, 
ask him to do so. As John Stuart Mill 
said: 
"A state which dwarfs its men, in order 
that they may be more docile instruments 
in its hands even for beneficial purposes, will 
find that with small men no great thing 
can really be accomplished." 
By the same standard, dignity, even great-
ness can come to those men, and only to 
those men, who accept fully the challenge 
of responsibility inherent in their work, 
whatever the risks. In the words of Theo-
dore Roosevelt: 
"Credit belongs to the man who is actually 
in the arena * * * who strives valiantly, who 
errs and comes up short again and again; 
who knows the great enthusiasms and the 
great devotions, and spends himself in a 
worthy cause; who at the best knows in the 
end the triumphs of high achievement; and 
who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails 
while daring greatly; so that his place shall 
never be with those cold and timid souls who 
know neither defeat nor victory."

(Mr. MADDEN (at the request of Mr.

RECORD, and to include an address by 
Vice President HUMPHREY.) 
Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, at the 
annual dinner given by the American 
Legion for Members of Congress last 
evening, Vice President HUMPHREY gave 
a review of his recent trip to southeast 
Asia. It was one of the Vice President's 
great messages for which he is famous. 
It was received with almost unanimous 
approval by the gathering of over 3,000 
legionnaires and their guests. 
The following are the highlights of his 
observations and facts concerning Viet-
nam problems: 
ADDRESS BY VICE PRESIDENT HUBERT HUMPHREY 
AT THE ANNUAL AMERICAN LEGION LEGISLA-
TIVE DINNER, WASHINGTON, D.C., MAackx 2, 
1966 
It is good to be back again with my friends 
of the Congress and the American Legion. 
I am particularly pleased to be in the com-
pany tonight of my good friend Representa-
tive OLIN TEAGUE. I can think of no one in 
the Congress, who more deserves the award 
you have bestowed on him. 
There is no doubt what is on all our minds 
tonight. It is the war in Vietnam. 
As you know, I returned a few days ago 
from 2 weeks in southeast Asia and the Pa-
cific. Tonight I would like to give you some 
of the impressions I bring home from my 
mission. 
First of all, may I say that the conflict 
we face in Vietnam is not an isolated conflict. 
It does not exist in a vacuum. 
South Vietnam is the testing ground for 
two struggles taking place in Asia: The 
struggle of nations to maintain their inde-
pendence while threatened by Communist 
subversion and aggression, and the struggle 
to bring about a social and economic revolu-
tion for the people of that part of the world. 
In Vietnam, the tide in both those strug-
gles has begun to turn in our favor. But 
make no mistake about it, we must be pre-
pared to face a long and costly effort. 
The military situation has improved over 
even a few months ago. South Vietnamese, 
American, and allied forces are holding their 
own with the Vietcong. They are today tak-
ing offensive initiatives in Vietcong sanc-
tuaries which were previously immune to at-
tack. Sections of road and railroad, previ-
ously unusable, are being used again. The 
Vietcong defection rate has increased in the 
past few months. Defectors report low 
morale, food shortages, and, above all, fear of 
bombing among Vietcong forces. 
Allied firepower and mobility are increas-
ing. 
Tactical air support is excellent. 
Our communication and supply situations 
have improved.

occupation and, cynics to the contrary, self-

in a recent publication, "Managers for 
Tomorrow," Rohrer, Mbler & Replogle, psy-
chological consultants, put it this way: 
"Growth, finally, is the evolvement of 
personal goals and the sense of venture in 
pursuing them. This Is the meaning of the 
dedicated man. His personal goals, his 
company goals, and his job goals have coinci-
dence to a great extent; and his personal 
power is directed single mindedly toward be-
tog himself on his job." 
The corporate leader who does not try to 
conduct his company so as to instill pride 
in his people is di armed, these days. 
The considerations I have discussed?
power, farseeing pragmatism, varied motives 
and self-expression?are a few among many 
that have affected the nature of large corpo-
rations as they are run today in America. 
CoMniNED FROM NEED 
People organize Institutions to deal with 
the recurring problems of a civilized life. 
The institution of business grew out of the 
basic needs of all people, from primitive so-
cieties to the present day, to make and dis-
tribute tools, weapons, clothing, or automo-
biles and television sets. 
.111 much the same fashion, institutions 
arise in response to social needs. 
in short, the only stability in society, 
either in business or outside it, is the cer-
tainty of change and the need for existing 
institutions to be prepared for change or be-
come reconciled to extinction at worst and 
Cr iesilization at best. 
'rim situation is dynamic. Businessmen 
have not changed; people have not changed; 
but our environment and its possibilities and 
demands have. In this ebb and flow our per-
spective must be enlarged. Required pro-
grams must be developed and administered, 
never maid by whom. We should not oppose 
either Government intervention or big busi-
ness expansion for the sake of opposing (Inc 
or the other, but we should oppose each if it 
threatens the quality of life. 
UNEAMMTAR INVOLVEMENT 
.business has not failed in discharge of the 
duties conventionally assigned to it?the 
production and distribution of goods. The 
problem comes when business, in organizing 
for these necessary and socially significant 
objectives, finds itself in a realm where there 
are consequences outside the range of the 
businessman's training and experience, 
where criteria are fuzzy indeed. 
Aeceptance of a corporate commitment to 
socially responsible action raises fearsome 
specters in the eyes of both businessmen and 
the public. 
There is the problem of adequate control 
Cr, insure that power will not overrun the 
hitt:rests of the individual, a difficulty inher-
ent in any large organization. As size and 
isimplexity increase, it becomes more and 
more difficult to administer policies equi-
bly, even those adopted precisely and 
exclusively for the benefit of the individual. 
'there is the problem of paternalism, 
which, implies return to a feudal structure of 
noblesse oblige basically insulting to indi-
vidual dignity and destructive of individual 
initiative. Fringe benefits, for example, are 
sometimes criticized as snaking a kind of 
industrial feudalism which binds workers to 
ik, particular corporation by threatening 
losees of seniority, or retirement benefits, to 
tliore who change jobs. 
iturther, any act of responsibility is an 
tetrcise of power, and people fear the exercise 
or power greater than their own, especially 
when coupled with confusion about goals or 
GI.,LILIS or both. 
There is fear that the large corporation it-
self is a kind of welfare state which may 
reach into every aspect of life, and could 
become a leviathan and a threat to freedom. 
This would be anathema to a society dedi-
cated to pluralism as ours is, and business-
men would deplore it as much as any were 
it to happen. 
Here is the classic moral problem confront-
ing each of us. No man has the right to 
order the lives of others, even for good, but 
Inevitably, the decisions of the businessman 
do just this-- and yet, act he must. 
S.KARCH FOR CRITERIA 
The revolution in thinking about business' 
responsibility leads to a search for workable 
criteria upon which the businessman can 
base his actions. There appear to be two 
kinds of criteria: the external standards em-
bodied in formal law, and the internal 
standards of an ethic based on philosophy 
and religion. 
Although the first of these may take the 
form of positive, or enabling legislation, most 
laws governing business have been negative 
and restrictive. Legislation, both Federal 
and State, has permeated business activity to 
an extent tho.t would amaze many people 
outside it. A vast multitude of statutory 
restrictions scts limits to the conduct of 
enterprise. 
The truth if; that most of the laws which 
so hedge in the operation of today's business 
were enacted because of early abuses of free-
dom by some businessmen and the conse-
quent need to protect various segments of 
the community. The net result has been to 
force business into a mold of responsibility--
and to keep it 'there--without providing 
really workable criteria for the businessman 
who seeks to reconcile his duties to society 
and his duties Co his share owners. 
for example, a highly motivated man would 
undoubtedly pay Isis employees a wage con-
sistent with the level of the economy. Not 
to do so, in the absence of legislation, would 
be "morally" wrong. Today's laws convert 
the moral issue to a legal one and say that 
not to pay at least a specified wage is legally 
wrong. The businesman, however, continues 
to have a moral problem. He must deter-
rnine whether the legal :minimum wage is a 
moral minimum wage. 
Beyond these laws, the structure of the 
corporation itself presents a paradox which 
restricts the kinds of moral actions a cor-
portation can undertake. The corporation, 
legally, is orginized to act as a person in 
the conduct of its affairs. Yet unlike a per-
son, it is composed of individuals whose 
rights must be respected. This second con-
sideration restrains the corporation in many 
ways. Legally, a corporation may, for exam-
ple, donate a part of its profits to chari-
table organizations like United Funds. The 
corporatism may also distribu be literature to 
its employees advertising a blood drive. But 
it is not defensible on any ground for a 
corporation to order its employees to donate 
blood, or to exert pressure on them to con-
tribute to a charity. 
This points up the distinction which must 
be made between the kind of service it is 
right for an individual to offer, and the 
sort of service proper for an artificial person 
Lls.e a corpora tion. Progress made by com-
munity organizations depends to a large ex-
tent on the vislumary contribution of time 
and energy by members of corporations act-
ing as private individuals. Participation in 
church acitivit.es, fund drives, elections, and 
service on school boards are matters which 
must be engaged in by individuals as indi-
viduals. Corporations can only foster an at-
mosphere in which participation of this sort 
is nurtured. Corporate responsibility must 
manifest itself in other ways. 
LEGAL PROGRESS 
Until recent years, there has been a dearth 
of legal expmsion on positive actions open 
to corporations. Now the law has so de-
veloped that it permits the exercise of re-
sponsibility to the community through the 
commitment of corporate resources to chari-
table purposes. More than 40 States have 
passed statutes authorizing corporations to 
make donations to philanthropic and edu-
cational institutions. In 1953, a unanimous 
decision of the Supreme Court of the State 
of New Jersey established the doctrine: 
"When the wealth of the Nation was pri-
marily in the hands of individuals, they 
discharged their responsibilities as citizens 
by donating freely for charitable purposes. 
With the transfer of most of the wealth to 
corporate hands and the imposition of heavy 
burdens of individual taxation, they have 
been unable to keep pace with increased 
philanthropic needs. They have, therefore, 
with justification, turned to corporations to 
assume the modern obligations of good citi-
zenship in the same manner as humans do. 
Congress and State legislatures have enacted 
laws which encourage corporate contribu-
tions, and much has recently been written to 
indicate the crying need and adequate legal 
basis therefore." 
A policy of making contributions to 
worthwhile efforts is the best way, it seems 
to me, for the corporation to contribute to 
the welfare of the community without in-
fringing the rights of the individuals who 
compose it. 
A CODE FOR BUSINESS 
All of this leads to the notion that busi-
ness ought to be a profession?in the sense 
of one which comprises a concept of service 
and a code for its practice. 
Management has largely shifted from the 
owners of the means of production to a 
class of salaried managers ultimately re-
sponsible to an enormous, diffuse body of 
shareholders who do not run the busiguss. 
The new justification for control of re-
sources is knowledge and ability to use them, 
rather than possession. These facts facili-
tate understanding of the managerial func-
tion as a service, directly to the shareholders 
and indirectly to the general public. Al-
though managers may own stock, most of 
them do not control the company through 
this holding; their services are purchased 
in the same way people purchase the serv-
ices of doctors, lawyers, or teachers. 
Donald K. David, dean of the Harvard 
Graduate School of Business Administra-
tion, put it this way: 
"The goal of professional adminietra-
tion * * is the achievement through our 
economic system of a full life beginnig with 
but not ending with material plenty * *. 
The direction in which we are moving com-
pels me to say that administration will some 
day be recognized as the process of conduct-
ing affairs in the interest of a life worth liv-
ing according to the values of our society 
and the capacity of each individual." 
The concept of the businessman as a pro-
fessional brings me back to my original his-
toric view of business activity. It never has 
been and is not now outside the dictates of 
moral considerations. Business today is 
neither immoral nor amoral by nature; the 
consequences of its actions in pursuit of its 
objectives are subject to judgments as to 
their morality. The businessman, to be 
successful, to be honorable, must be a full 
man, developed both intellectually, spir-
itually, and in the special knowledge 
relevant to his affairs. 
The idea of banditry may be hard to dis-
pel. Distrust has been built upon very real 
experience. Some bandits are still with us. 
This does not change the need for accept-
ance of moral responsibility. 
No matter what laws are enacted, no 
matter what changes transform our institu-
tions. men will err. But through attitude, 
standards can be high. This goes for the 
man at the top; it goes for the man at the 
bottom and for all the ones midway.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE 4651 
Coordination among allied forces has im-
proved. 
I think you should know that our American 
troops are conducting themselves in the best 
traditions of this country, not only in the 
field but in their work in building rural 
schools and hospitals, in helping the Viet-
namese people to build, plan, and have hope 
for the future. Their performance is good, 
their morale is high, and we have every rea-
son to be proud of them. 
Special mention should be made of the ex-
cellent rescue and medical care available to 
our troops in Vietnam. Within 3 hours most 
wounded receive skilled medical treatment. 
And fewer than 1 percent of all wounded 
troops hospitalized fail to survive?this com-
pared to a rate of 8.5 percent in World War I; 
4.5 percent in World War II; and 2.2 percent 
In Korea. 
There are no "Yankee go home" signs on 
the walls in Saigon and other cities. Indeed, 
the Vietcong themselves seem to have some 
trouble in getting their soldiers to believe 
their own anti-American propaganda. Ques-
tioning of prisoners and defectors shows that 
very few of the Vietcong feel the United 
States seeks conquest or domination in Viet-
nam. 
One prisoner who was questioned said this: 
"I saw an American once, working with sev-
eral Vietnamese to repair a bridge. He wore 
no shirt. I saw that he and the Vietnamese 
workers understood one another very well." 
Another prisoner said that he had seen 
Americans nearly every day in his area and 
added: 
"I've never seen an American doing some-
thing which showed that he wanted to rule 
the Vietnamese." 
And he was right. 
We are not in Vietnam to rule the Viet-
namese. We are there to repel aggression, 
and to prove to the aggressors that the price 
of their aggression comes too high. 
We are in Vietnam to maintain the rights 
of self-determination and national inde-
pendence in face of calculated subversion, 
terrorism, and military force. 
The other side calls itself the National Lib-
eration Front. 
I agree that it is a front?a front for Hanoi 
and for the expansionist drive 91 Asian com-
munism. 
I have had direct experience with the front 
tactic. I faced Communists first-hand as 
mayor of Minneapolis. I helped clean them 
out of my State political party. And I helped 
clean them out when they tried to infiltrate 
the American labor movement and a number 
of liberal organizations. 
And, in case there is any doubt in any-
one's mind, let me make it clear that the 
people who use the front tactic are not mild-
mannered social reformers. They are hard, 
callous men filled with a drive for power 
and domination over others. 
The so-called National Liberation Front 
in Vietnam is being used by Communists. 
It is led by Communists, and its direction 
comes from the north. 
And I challenge tonight the idea that the 
Vietcong is anything but an instrument of 
the Asian Communist thrust for power. 
There are no doubt honest nationalists 
swept up in the Vietcong movement. But 
their tragedy is great, for they are being 
deluded and used?just as others have been 
in the past. 
I said earlier that there are two struggles 
in Vietnam and southeast Asia: the struggle 
against subversion and aggression; and the 
struggle for a better life for the ordinary 
people of that part of the world. 
The first struggle is going better, although 
there will undoubtedly be disappointments 
and setbacks ahead. 
What about the second struggle?the 
struggle which can build that area's long-
term health and stability? 
When I left Saigon, Premier Ky told me 
"We have begun 12 years late. But it is not 
too late." 
The South Vietnamese Government has 
now undertaken?late in the day, it is true?
programs which will give the people of the 
countryside a feeling of participation and 
a stake in their government. 
The South Vietnamese Government is 
working hard to educate Vietnamese chil-
dren; to feed, clothe, and house hundreds 
of thousands of Vietnamese refugees; to 
overcome a dangerous inflation in the Viet-
namese economy; to defeat corruption and 
administrative inertia. It is working hard 
toward the day when truly free elections 
may be held. 
And we are helping in this second struggle 
just as we are in the first. 
At the same time we seek, as strongly as 
ever, to bring this conflict to negotiation. 
Our aim in that negotiation: The establish-
ment of a just and honorable peace?and the 
chance for the long-suffering, valiant people 
of South Vietnam to decide their own futures. 
We have chosen no easy course. We have 
not chosen the course of withdrawal. Nor 
have we chosen the course of massive escala-
tion and violence. 
We have chosen the course which faces 
with sober responsibility the whole complex 
situation there. 
Have we the resolve, the staying power, and 
the courage to see it through? 
If we do not, we may face tomorrow else-
where the aggression we face today in South 
Vietnam. 
I found, on my journey, that almost all the 
Independent nations of southeast Asia fear 
the expansionist drive of Asian communism?
an ideology which seeks to exploit every pos-
sible point of weakness in that part of the 
world. 
The approach of Asian communism is not 
merely economic, although It capitalizes on 
the poverty and despair of the Asian peasant. 
Its tactic is not merely political, although 
its hardcore followers are dedicated believers 
in Marxist doctrine, and although it wraps 
itself in the robes of nationalism to attract 
those who are not yet ready for the full 
gospel. 
Its thrust for power is not simply military, 
although it has never won power except by 
ruthless use of force?and I believe it never 
will. 
Here in the United States, many thousands 
of miles away, it is easy to debate and theo-
rize about Asian communism. But, in Asia, 
it is not a subject for debate. It is a harsh, 
dangerous reality. The peoples and govern-
ments of southeast Asia are facing this real-
ity. And we?and an increasing number of 
our allies?are facing it with them. 
The people of Asia want to decide their 
own futures. They want to be independent. 
But no free Asian nation is strong enough to 
stand alone in face of massive military force, 
subversion, and terrorism directed against it. 
I believe that the time may come when 
Asian communism may lose its fervor, when 
it may lose some of its neuroses, when it may 
realize that its objectives cannot be gained 
by aggression. 
But, until that time, I believe we have no 
choice but to help the nations of southeast 
Asia strengthen themselves for the long road 
ahead. 
There truly is no alternative. 
The continent of Asia may seem distant 
and remote to us here in this comfortable 
ballroom. But I would remind you that, in 
this nuclear age, no point on the globe is any 
longer remote from any other. In this tithe 
we would well heed the words of great Asian 
Thinker Confucius. 
"If a man take no thought about what is 
distant, he will find sorrow near at hand." 
And so it is that we must rededicate our-
selves to the pledges made last month in the 
historic declaration of Honolulu?pledges to 
defend against aggression; to the work of 
social revolution; to the goal of free self-
government; to the attack on hunger, igno-
rance, and disease; and to the unending quest 
for peace. 
FARM INVESTMENT PROTECTION 
FOR CITIZEN-SOLDIERS 
(Mr. NELSEN (at the request of Mr. 
DON H. CLAUSES) was granted permis-
sion to extend his remarks at this point 
in the RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. NELSEN. Mr. Speaker, recogniz-
ing that many young farmers may be 
drafted or recalled to active duty from 
Reserves or the National Guard in the 
near future because of Vietnam, I am 
today proposing an amendment to cur-
rent farm law designed to protect their 
farm investments in their absence. 
My bill, the first of its kind to be in-
troduced in Congress, would permit such 
farmers, on notice of induction or recall 
to active military duty, to receive first 
preference in retiring their cropland 
under provisions of the Cropland Ad-
justment Act passed by Congress last 
year. Additionally, participants could 
retire land only for the duration of their 
military obligation if they preferred this 
to the standard 5- or 10-year retirement 
program. 
If the term of the land retirement 
agreement were to end after the normal 
planting season, the returning service-
man would have the option of extending 
the agreement to the end of the year. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to realize that 
the young farmer just getting started 
often has indebted himself substantially 
for equipment and farm rental. When 
he is called up with as little as 7-day 
alert, he has inadequate time to make 
arrangements for the running of his 
farm in his absence. In the past, 
farmers faced with this situation have 
often been forced to sell out at a loss, 
and it is time to remedy this situation. 
I might say further, Mr. Speaker, that 
this legislation was suggested by Capt. 
Kenneth L. Keil, a young farmer in Red-
wood County, Minn., who is a member of 
the Minnesota National Guard. His 
sound suggestion was passed on to me 
by Maj. Gen. Chester J. Moeglein, ad-
jutant general of the Minnesota National 
Guard. 
Captain KeiFs sound suggestion would 
benefit young farmers In my district as 
well as many others around the Nation. 
I would like to commend Captain Keil 
for his initiative, and I hope Congress 
will give this proposal earliest possible 
consideration. 
I request unanimous consent to in-
clude correspondence I received in con-
nection with this new proposal at this 
point in my remarks.

the Minnesota Army National Guard are 
subject to being ordered into active Federal 
service with as little as 7 days' alert. While 
such a requirement places a burden on all 
of these guardsmen, it imposes a particular 
hardship on individuals who are in a business 
or profession for themselves. Among this 
latter group are the farmers, who quite 
obviously cannot sell their farms or refrain 
from planting their craps based on mere 
probabilities. 
am enclosing copy of a letter I received 
from Capt. Kenneth L. Keil, commander of 
our unit at Redwood Falls, Minn., which 
contains a proposal for farmers who are also 
members of a National Guard or other mili-
tary unit. This proposal seems to me to 
have merit. The Congress has by law pro-
vided protection for individuals who are in 
the employ of others but has so far been 
ible to do very little for the self-employed. 
Since a, GI bill for post-Korea veterans is 
now before the Congress for consideration, I 
should like to recommend that some action 
_along the lines suggested by Captain Keil 
be taken to ease the situation for our many

;ire: In the past years when our men in 
uniform returned to civilian life, many of 
them found their jobs taken and bad to 
adjust to other means of providing for self-
sustenance. Laws were passed giving these 
people the assurance of returning to their 
former employment. However, there is no 
provision for keeping the young men on the 
Farm after their tnur of military duty is com-
pleted. Many gave up months and years 
or their lives to make it possible for those 
on the homefront to capitalize on the mis-
fortunes of war. When they returned, they 
found. their land. had been rented by someone 
else and that there was no more available. 
These people who stayed behind enjoyed the 
prosperity of good prices for their products 
and refused to yield to those who made it 
possible for their prosperity. 
Many of us face this possibility again, 
therefore, 1- present to you the enclosed copy 
of a proposal to help these men and also 
aid the farm program in retiring acres from 
production. 
Very truly yours, 
NNETH t..

M.:swoon COUNTY ASO, 
Redwood Falls, Minn. 
DEAR COMMITTEEMEN: As I and other young 
farmers face the possibility of entering mili-
tary service in the near future, we are in-
terested in a. program of retiring our crop-
land. For those people that are wage earn-
ers and employed as carpenters, electricians, 
etc., there is provided for them by law that 
they will be entitled to their jobs upon re-
turning from the military service. For the 
young farmer who is just beginning his life 
:Embition as a farmer or those of us who have 
been in the business of farming for several 
years, it will be a burden and hardship for 
us 1;0 have our programs interrupted. I am 
referring now to the possibility of our Na-
tional Guard unit being called to active duty 
sometime in the near future. There are 
several of us who have already been in the 
service for several years and we lost those 
years as far as competing for land and finan-
cial gains are concerned. 
I realize there are obligations on the part 
Of everyone to their country especially the 
young men of today. However, it is difficult 
for a man to begin a farming program and 
to take on a great debt which is required 
of him in these times and to leave it for a 
period of time. He has a financial loss be-
cause of the depreciation of his equipment 
and a risk o his own life. The monetary re-
turn from the Government for his service to 
protect the people at home does not cover 
the potential income he may have derived 
from, his agrarian operations, Also, the pos-
sibility of losing the land he is renting is 
very strong, and in many eases he must seek 
other lines of work. 
Using myself as an example, I am renting 
my land and I would like to retire my crop-
land (with the consent of the landowners) 
either for the duration of one milisary tour 
or for a specified time, preferably during the 
length of tour. I have no brothers and my 
father is -unable to continue the operations 
because of his age. I do not consider it eco-
nomically feasible to hire anyone to carry 
on for me as my machinery is too much of 
an investment and help is not dependable. 
Even if I owned my own land, I would con-
sider this program and those who have 
brothers and fathers to carry on should be 
given the same privilege cif retiring their land 
either all or i.n excess of the 50-pertent corn 
base. 
Therefore, I propose the following program 
concerning those who must enter or reenter 
the military service: 
Upon receiving word of induction or mo-
bilization to active duty, the obligee (mili-
tary) be given the opportunity to retire 
either all of his cropland or that percentage 
of cropland (disregarding the maximum 50 
percent corn base) which cannot be operated 
without hi:; assistance. This refers only to 
the man, Inmse:1, who has contracts on land 
which he himself is operating and has a 
financial debt or a family farm wLich may 
be hindered financially (but muss be re-
viewed by the county committee) by the 
loss of this individual. In the case of rented 
land there must be a signed certificate by 
the landowner and renter agreeing to enter 
this program. 
To retire his land, he must comply with 
the county committee's policies as to weed 
control and seeding. Also, he may be given 
an option of retiring this land for a number 
of years (5 or 10) or only for the duration 
of his obligation. If his tour of duty should 
end during the growing Or planting season 
so that it may create a hardship on his part 
to accurately plant a crop, he be given the 
option to remain in the program for the 
remainder of the growing season. 
The foregoing proposal is for your study 
and consideration. This is mainly to help 
us to retain our operations and provide us a 
Future when we return. I will be willing to 
discuss and answer any questions you may 
have. 
Sincerely,

THE FIRST STEP IN PROTECTING 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM 
CRIPPLING TRANSPORTATION 
STRIKES 
(Mr. GURNEY (at the request of Mr. 
DON H. CLAUSEN) was granted permis-
sion to extend his remarks at this point 
in the RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. GURNEY. Mr. Speaker, I am to-
day introducing a resolution to create a 
joint congressional committee to study 
and report on problems relating to col-
lective bargaining, strikes and lockouts 
in the transportation industry. 
It would be composed of eight Mem-
bers of each House, and would be author-
ized to conduct hearings, investigations 
and studies of the entire area of trans-
portation labor disputes and strikes. 
The issue of paralyzing strikes has 
been with us for a long time, but it was 
brought vividly to our attention earlier 
this year when the transit workers 
unions in New York crippled the city in 
a strike felt across the Nation. 
Direct costs of the strike to the city of 
New York have been estimated at $50 
million. Loss of wages of those people 
not connected with transit, but who were 
unable to get to work has been guessed 
at near $300 million. Countless hours 
of productive time were lost, to business 
and industry, retail sales dropped more 
than 50 percent. Hardest hit were the 
small businesses which were least able to 
recover, and the poorer workers who 
could least stand the financial strain. 
And a great percentage of the people hurt 
were not citizens of New York City or 
even the State of New York. 
But this strike was only one of the 
series of recent walkouts that have had 
serious effects upon our economy. A 
shipping strike early in 1964 brought in-
ternational shipping to a standstill, cut-
ting off goods and services to the entire 
Nation. A rail crisis in 1963, only nar-
rowly averted by special legislation, may 
erupt again when the contract expires. 
It has become clear that something 
must be done. 
There have been many suggestions; 
many bills have been introduced in an 
effort to remedy the situation. But the 
business of the Education and Labor 
Committee, through which the majority 
of this legislation must pass has been 
taken up with every program from 
poverty to the minimum wage, leaving 
little time for the detailed considerations 
necessary. 
These strikes involve so many people, 
so many businesses, so big a part of the 
economy, and so many questions of Fed-
eral and State law, that an extraordinary 
amount of study and time is required to 
fully consider them. The Congress must 
have the benefit of the best advice avail-
able, and the machinery for a careful 
and thoughtful study. 
The problem is so far-reaching that 
it must be dealt with through broad 
methods, fair to every dispute and, above 
all, to the American people. I am con-
fident that the Congress can and will 
devise such a solution, but they must 
first have the benefit of the best advice 
and information available. 
The joint committee which I propose 
will not be an investigating comtnittee 
to hear recriminations on past strikes, 
but rather to consider ways of averting 
them in the future. 
The principle and practice of collec-
tive bargaining have made great contri-
butions to the development of the econ-
omy and industry of this Nation. They 
should be left intact as much as possible. 
But it has become apparent that new 
approaches must be found to cope with 
matters of national interest.

SEPARATE STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER LEE 
LOEVINGER REGARDING PROPOSED CATV 
LEGISLATION 
I believe it Ls necessary for Congress to 
legislate on the subject of community 
antenna television and that the draft of 
proposed legislation submitted herewith by 
the FCC is the best compromise that can 
now be agreed upon. It is my opinion that 
under present statutes the. Commission does 
not have the jurisdiction which it claims 
over CATV's. See my separate opinion at 
4 R12,2d 1679, 1712. If the Commission is to 
act in this field legislative authorization is, 
therefore, necessary. 
In general I agree with the views expressed 
by Commissioner Bartley in his dissenting 
statement. However, those views are more 
relevant to consideration of the regulations 
that may be promulgated by the Commission 
under the proposed legislation than to the 
bill now proposed. The legislation proposed 
is basically a broad authorization to the 
FCC to act in this field, with a specific 
declaration that congressional action shall 
not be construed as Federal preemption. It 
would be desirable for Congress to establish 
more specific standards for administrative 
action than are contained in the proposed 
bill. But it is appropriate for Congress to 
delegate broad authority for the Commission 
to act under whatever standards Congress 
may see fit to establish. Accordingly I join 
in recommending that Congress consider the 
proposed bill submitted herewith and enact 
legislation in such form as may best express 
the congressional view of the proper way to 
deal with the problems involving FCC juris-
diction to regulate CATV systems, the opera-
tion of CATV systems, the relations of CATV 
systems to conventional broadcasting sta-
tions, and the relation between Federal and 
State jurisdiction in this field. 
FEDERAL COMM UNICATIONS 
COMMISSION, 
Washington, D.C., March 3, 1966. 
Hon. HARLEY 0. STAGGERS, 
Chairman, Committee on Interstate and 
Foreign Commerce, House of Representa-
tives, Washington, D.C. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN In accordance with 
your request that the Commission furnish 
your committee as soon as possible with our 
suggestions for legislation on CATV, I am 
enclosing proposed legislation which the 
Commission at its meeting yesterday agreed 
to recommend. The dissenting statement 
of Commissioner Bartley and the separate 
statement of Commissioner Loevinger are 
also attached. 
Because of this urgent request, and the 
fact that the bill has just been drafted, it 
has not been presented to the Bureau of 
the Budget for advice as to its 'relationship 
to the program of the President. However, 
a copy is being sent to that Bureau 
forthwith, 
Please call on me if T. can be of any further 
assistance in this matter. 
Yours sincerely, 
E. WILLIAM HENRY, 
Chairman. 
SUPERSONIC TRANSPORT PLANE 
(Mr. BOW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BOW. Mr. Speaker, I am intro-
ducing today a bill to provide for the 
prototype construction of a commercial 
supersonic transport airplane, to be fi-
nanced with ,funds obtained from the 
general public rather than from the U.S. 
Treasury. 
The President's transportation mes-
sage yesterday contained a request for 
an additional $200 million to initiate the 
prototype of a supersonic aircraft. We 
have already appropriated $231 million 
to this project. 
I have believed for a long time that 
this is a burden which could be carried 
by private rather than Federal funds, 
and I think the war effort makes it im-
perative that we develop a sound plan to 
do so. 
The bill I introduce today provides 
such a plan. It incorporates suggestions 
made to the Appropriations Committee 
last September 8 by Col. W. S. Whitehead 
whose firm, Ives, Whitehead & Co., Inc., 
has been engaged hi a 3-year study on 
financing an SST. 
If we are to relieve the taxpayers of 
this burden, this is the critical time for 
decision and I hope the bill will receive 
widespread study and discussion. 
The Bow proposal will permit the 
orderly and timely transition of respon-
sibility for this development task from 
the Federal Aviation Agency to a pro-
posed independent Government agency 
to be known as the Supersonic Transport 
Authority. The independent agency ap-
proach was recommended in the Black-
Osborne report released by the White 
House in late 1963. 
The Supersonic Transport Authority 
would be empowered to sell to the public, 
through normal investment channels, 
development bonds in the amount of $1.5 
billion. 
These securities will not be obligations 
of the United States, but in event of 
any default in the payment of principal 
and interest, the United States will guar-
antee the payment thereof. 
The proposed legislation requires that 
industry share a reasonable proportion 
of the cost of development, but postpones 
fulfillment of this responsibility until 
the commercial production of the SST is 
realized. 
The patents, patent rights, and so forth 
resulting from development, will remain 
the proRerty of the United States until 
all of the bands of the SST Development 
Authority are paid off. When this oc-
curs, the rights to these inventions will 
pass to private industry. 
The advantages of the bill may be sum-
marized as follows; 
First. It avoids the necessity of appro-
priating huge sums by Congress for this 
gigantic commercial research and de-
velopment project. 
Second. It permits a savings feature 
by using all residual usable assets ac-
quired during development, in the com-
mercial production of the SST. 
Third. It assures more effective sur-
veillance over development costs since 
each separate major stage of construc-
tion will be financed separately. 
Fourth. It permits an outlet for ex-
cessive investment funds now held in 
private hands. 
Fifth. It provides an equitable and 
sound basis for determining industry's 
share of the development cost, after the 
fact, and not before development of the 
SST. 
Congress is now being called upon to 
authorize huge sums to finance the war 
in Vietnam, and for enlarged and ex-
panded domestic programs. Appropri-
ated funds required for our defense come 
first, especially since the President re-
ports a long and hard war is ahead. 
I strongly support the provisions of 
the bill I have introduced and sincerely 
hope a 1 Members will recognize the wis-
dom of achieving the objective of devel-
e SST with private funds. 
SERVICE FOR VIETNAM VETERANS 
(Mr. HALPERN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Speaker, some 
disquieting information has reached me 
which I believe should be of concern to 
the House. As a member of the Vet-
erans' Affairs Committee, I would want 
to see that those who serve in Vietnam 
and return home, especially the wounded, 
are granted all the service to which they 
are entitled and which a grateful Na-
tion can bestow. 
I have learned with dismay that an in-
excusable backlog, due to lack of ad-
ministrative machinery to process dis-
charges, has resulted in the virtual con-
finement of Purple Heart cases. 
I understand that the situation pre-
vailing at the Forest Glen facility at 
Walter Reed is characteristic of other 
medical separation centers. At Walter 
Reed, wounded veterans from Vietnam, 
who have already undergone thorough 
treatment, are made to wait for pro-
longed periods before they can be re-
leased to return home. In other words, 
despite the fact that they have received 
all possible treatment and are ready for 
discharge, they are kept from returning 
to civilian life, mainly because of 
bureaucratic redtape. 
Military authorities state that the rea-
son for this delay is that men must await 
due process of boards to adjudge dis-
ability ratings. Their treatment is com-
pleted; their medical case files are in 
order; but they must wait for a brief 
appearance before the disability board. 
I quite agree that this separation process 
is essential. 
However, in some instances wounded 
veterans have been detained for as long 
as 2 months while awaiting their cases 
before the board. It seems to me out-
rageous that men who bore the brunt of 
battle in Vietnam and who suffered am-
putations and other injuries are pre-
vented from rejoining their families be-
cause of the shortcomings of the separa-
tion system. In this age, it is uncon-
scionable that we lack the personnel and 
the means to discharge these men with-
out undue delay. 
Anything short of an expeditious and 
efficient separation worthy of the cour-
age of these wounded men fails to recog-
nize their gallantry and sacrifices. It 
seems the least a grateful Nation can do. 
The urgency of the situation is drama-
tized by the news that last week's total 
wounded in Vietnam action was 747, rep-
resenting over 10,0 per day. Many of 
these wounded will soon arrive back in 
the States, increasing the number of 
those detained by the already jammed 
facilities. 
I think we should do everything pos-
sible to expedite final clearance proce-
dures for these men.

their size or nature, need not be encom-
passed within the regulatory scheme. For 
example, the Commission's present regula-
tions exempt systems serving fewer than 
.50 subscribers or which serve only 1 or more 
apartment houses under common ownership, 
control or management. (See, e.g., 47 C.F.R. 
21.710(a).) 
Of prime importance is the proposed new 
section 331(a) (1) of the act, which would 
expressly confer upon the Commission, in 
broad and comprehensive terms, authority to 
regulate community antenna systems in the 
nubile; interest. This authority is to be 
exercised only to the extent necessary to 
carry out the purposes of the Communica-
tions Act, particularly the establishment 
and maintenance of broadcast services and 
the provision of multiple reception services. 
There is thus a, congressional recognition of 
the public service rendered by the broadcast 
and CATV industries and a directive to pro-
mote the orderly growth of both industries. 
We recommend the broad approach along 
the lines of proposed section 331(a) (1) be-
cause of the dynamic and relatively new 
nature of the CATV field. We believe that it 
would be difficult and indeed impracticable 
to attempt to delineate precisely in a statute 
all of the possible areas in which the public 
interest may in the future require Commis-
sion action. Had legislation been drawn so 
deal specifically with the problems posed by 
CATV in the fifties, it would have been in-
adequate as to such present problems as 
those raised by CATV entry into the major 
markets. Today, for example, because there 
is so little program origination or alternation 
or deletion of broadcast signals being car-
ried, there wont(' appear to be few, if any, 
problems concerning the carriage over CATV 
systems of politic-el broadcasts or of appro-
priate identification announcements with 
respect to sponsored material, including pro-
grams Involving controversial issues. But 
there could be future problems in these re-
spects, requiring regulation along the lines 
of sections 315 or 317. The broad regulatory 
approach we urge is similar to that adopted 
by the Congress for regulation of radio, and 
Lice following quotation from the landmark 
Supreme Court case construing the Commu-
nications Act is equally pertinent to the dy-
namic and new field of CATV: 
"Congress was acting in a field of regula-
tion which was both new and dynamic. * * ? 
While Congress clid not give the Commission 
unfettered discretion to regulate ell phases 
of the radio industry, it did not frustrate the 
Purpose for which the Communications Act 
of 1.934 was brought into being by attempting 
an itemized catalog of the specific manifes-
tations of the general problems for the solu-
tion of which it was establishing a regulatory 
agency. That would have stereotyped the 
powers of the Commission to specific details 
in regulating a field of enterprise the domi-
nant characteristic of which was the rapid 
pace of its unfolding. And so Congress did 
what experience had taught It in similar 
attempts at regulation, even in fields far less 
fluid and dynamic than radio. The essence 
of that experience was to define broad areas 
for regulation and to establish standards for 
judgment adequately related in their appli-
cation to the problems to be solved." (NEC v. 
U.S., 319 U.S. 190, 218-219). 
There is one area which we believe that 
Congress may wish to consider specifically 
at this time, rather than leaving to subse-
quent regulatory decision under the pro-
posed section 331(a) (1); namely. Whether 
community antenna systems should be re-
quired to obtain the consent of the originat-
ing broadcast station before retransmitting 
the station's signal over the system. It has 
been urged that such a requirement would 
obviate the need for much, if not all, of the 
Commission's present regulations in this 
field. The Commission is not now in a posI-
No. 3t3---5 
tion to state whether a so-called section 
325(a) approach would be effective or fully 
consistent with the public interest. The 
matter is one of such a nature that we be-
lieve it should be more appropriately con-
sidered by the Congress. In this way, there 
could be congressional hearings on how such 
a retransmission consent provision would 
function as a practical matter, whether 
there should be special provisions for the 
CATV systems operating in a small commu-
nity, and whether and to what extent there 
should be "grandfathering" of existing sys-
tems. The statute finally enacted could then 
reflect the congressional judgment on this 
important aspect 
The proposed new section 331(b) of the 
Communications Act deals with the question 
of possible program origination by commu-
nity antenna systems. We believe it would 
be inequitable to allow unlimited program 
origination, since this would permit com-
munity antenna systems to use the distri-
bution of free television broadcast signals 
as a base for engaging in pay-TV operations.3 
Moreover, the Ccmmissiorx, and indeed the 
Congress, has had a continuing conceen with 
the possible impact of subscription tele-
vision servicee on the free television broad-
cast service. The Commission currently has 
before it a petition requesting the institu-
tion of rulemaking proceedings to provide 
for subscription television service, on a per-
manent and carefully regulated basis 
throughout tae country, utilizing the facili-
ties of television broadcast stations. Be-
cause of the fciregoing considerations, the 
proposed section 331(b) would bar any gen-
eral pay-TV operation by a community an-
tenna system. 
While cony_ nceel that community antenna 
systems shou id not be permitted unlimited 
program origination, we are not recom mend-
ing that Congress impose a complete ban on 
program orig,.nation. There would appear 
to be various possible exceptions (e.g., the 
fairly common time and weather casting 
channels on -CATS systems; see also para-
graph 57 of (sir Notice of Inquiry and NTetice 
of Proposed Ruleraaking, Docket No. 15971, 
1 FCC 2c1 453, 474-75). The scope cii such 
possible exceptions to the ban collie only 
be determined after appropriate proceedings. 
Becauee cif the importance of the matter, we 
would suggest that Congress, upon the basis 
of its hearings, resolve this question and 
enect specific statutory guidelines. 
Absent such congressional guideline.;, the 
Commission recommends that Congress fol-
low the approach set out in the new section 
331(b). The proposed section 331(1,), in 
addition to barring program origination by 
community antenna systems, would permit 
the Commission to grant exceptions subject 
to several limitations. An express inicling 
would have to be made, after appropriate 
proceedings, that an exception would serve 
the public interest; it could be grantee only 
by general rule; and no additional enarge 
to subscribers would be permitted under any 
exception granted. 
Finally, the Commission believes that con-
gressional consideration should also be given 
to the appropriate relationship of Federal 
to State-local jurisdiction over community 
antenna systems, particularly with regard to 
initial franchising, rate regulation, and re-
lated matters. The Commission generally 
has not proposed to exercise any jurisdic-
tion with respect to these matters. (See 
par. 32, Notice -of Inquiry and Notice of Pro-
Specific charges to subscribers for pro-
grams originated by a community antenna 
system could, of course, be barred, but it 
might be difficult to insure that monthly 
rates charged to subscribers were not being 
set at a level which would take into account 
programs ciriginated by the system, par licu-
larly in the case. of a new system. 
posed Rulemaking, Docket No. 15971, 1 FCC 
2d 453, 466.) Rather, it has recognized that 
many local governmental bodies, usually in. 
connection with the grant of franchises, 
have asserted some jurisdiction with respect 
to rates charged subscribers and similar mat-
ters. At least three States (Connecticut. 
New Jersey, and Rhode Island) have held 
that CATV systems are public 'utilities. 
In our opinion, the public interest will beet 
be protected by permitting State and local 
regulation to continue with regard to those 
matters not regulated by the Commission. 
We are therefore recommending legislation 
along the lines of the proposed section 331 
(c). That section provides that there would 
be no Federal preemption except to the ex-
tent of direct conflict with the provisions of 
the Communications Act or regulations en-
acted by the Commission. This would per-
mit State and local action, but would not 
foreclose Federal action to carry out the pur-
poses of the act and to promote the "public 
interest in the larger and more effective use 
of radio" (sec. 303(g) ), where such lie tion 
becomes necessary. 
Adopted: March 2, 1966. 
DISSENTING STATEMENT OF COMMISIIIONER 
ROBERT T. BARTLEY 
I believe that telling the public it cannot 
receive broadcasts it wants and is willing to 
pay for via CATV is unsound public policy. 
People willing to pay extra should be al-
lowed to bring in broadcasts which they 
would not otherwise receive as well or not 
at all. 
Conditions which the Commission would 
impose on CATV as to carriage, rioncluplica-
tion and procedural impediments to devel-
opment in the top 100 markets appear to 
be for the economic protection of television 
stations. Experience indicates that eco-
nomic protection begets more regulation. 
The heart of concern over CATV is its 
possible evolution into pay television. Fear 
has been expressed that the community an-
tenna systems will be built and made viable 
by using free broadcasts from television sta-
tions; then, after the systems have acquired 
a sufficient number of subscribers, they 
could afford to originate their own programs, 
and pay television would result. 
Consideration_need be given to the exist-
ing types of systems, (1) community an-
tenna systems which receive, and distribute 
to subscribers, transmissions of broadcast 
stations, and (2) closed-circuit systems 
which originate their own special progam-
ing and distribute it by wire or cable to the 
theaters, business establishments or homes 
of subscribers. 
I believe we should not discourage closed-
circuit systems built and made viable by dis-
tributing their own programs. 
It is the mixing of the two types of sys-
tems which would give rise to an unfair 
competitive advantage. It would be in-
equitable to allow programs origination 
since this would permit community antenna 
systems to use the distribution of free tele-
vision broadcast signals as a base for engag-
ing in pay television operations. 
Accordingly, at the present time, I would 
recommend the following legislation, limited 
to prohibiting program origination, by com-
munity antenna systems: 
Section 3(h) (definition) : Commuility 
antenna system means a facility which re-
ceives any programs transmitted by a 
broadcast station and distributes such pro-
grams by wire or cable to customers paying 
for the service. 
Section 331: No community antenna sys-
tem shall distribute programs other than 
those received from transmissions by broad-
cast stations.

If it is any consolation to those who are 
now inexcusably bogged down in admin-
istrative redtape, I am certain that once 
their cases are passed on to the Veterans' 
Administration, they will receive the 
benefit of the efficient processes of the

THE SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM 
(Mr. BRAY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute, and to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. BRAY. Mr. Speaker, for over 25 
years Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director 
of the Selective Service System, has been 
sending "greetings" to draftees. His 
name has become synonymous with the 
Selective Service and all too frequently 
attacks at the System itself have been 
aimed directly at him. This is wrong 
and quite unfair to a man who has served 
his country so admirably for so many 
years and who at age '72 is still going 
strong. 
There is much confusion and misun-
derstanding over just what the prime 
function of the Selective Service System 
is. It is primarily to select a man and 
deliver him to the Armed Forces. Selec-
tive Service does not prescribe nor ad-
minister the mental and physical ex-
aminations, for instance. It was the 
Army that refused to take Cassius Clay 
originally, and the blame cast upon 
Selective Service was in error. All Selec-
tive Service did was reclassify him after 
the Army had delivered its first opinion 
of him; that is, after Clay had failed 
the mental examination. Now that the 
Army has lowered its standards?mark 
that well, the Army has changed, not 
Selective Service?Clay has been recon-
sidered and reclassified, and it is incum-
bent upon all Selective Service boards to 
reshape their classifications, based upon 
the Army's changed requirements. 
The deferment process is also misun-
derstood. The only deferment specified 
by law is ILS. This category applies to 
high school students who are of registra-
tion age-18?but not yet 20; they 
hold this classification until graduation 
or age 20 or until they cease to attend 
school. It also applies to college students 
until the end of the academic year. De-
ferments beyond the academic year are 
solely the result of Presidential direction. 
On the basis of the law itself, college 
deferments would only be for the com-
pletion of the academic year. 
At this time plans are underway for a 
series of tests and examinations to be 
given to college students on behalf of the 
Selective Service System to determine 
their progress and academic ability. 
This was last done during the Korean 
war. It very well may lead to reclassifi-
cation for many. 
The real authority as far as the draft-
ing of men into the armed services is 
concerned lies with the President. The 
Chief Executive is specifically given the 
power to select and induct as many men 
as are required. The Selective Service 
System merely follows policy set by the 
President and his advisers. 
It is the same situation in the case of 
deferments. Save for the student defer-
ments specified by law, the President has 
the authority and responsibility to pro-
vide, by rules and regulations, for defer-
ments involving occupations, depend-
ency and fitness. Recent cancellation of 
an order exempting men married before 
a certain date from induction is a good 
example of this. 
As the U.S. Government Organization 
Manual states: 
The purpose of the Selective Service Sys-
tem is to assure the Armed Forces a supply 
of manpower adequate to insure the security 
of the United States, with concomitant re-
gard for the maintenance of an effective 
national economy. 
It is the President who decides the 
number desired and what their qualifica-
tions should be. The selective service 
merely processes the young men and es-
tablishes their priority under existing 
law and presidential directives. 
The House Armed Services Committee 
will in the near future review the opera-
tion of the Selective Service System to 
determine whether additional legislation 
Is needed. 
NEWT GRAHAM LOCK AND DAM 
(Mr. BELCHER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute, and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Speaker, today I 
have placed in the hopper a bill that I 
hope in some small way will pay proper 
tribute to a dear and personal friend of 
mine, the late Newt Graham, of Okla-
homa. I have asked that lock and dam 
No. 18 on the Verdigris River in Okla-
homa, and the lake created thereby, be 
named for this wonderful Oklahoman, 
and that they be called the Newt Graham 
lock and dam and the Newt Graham 
Lake. 
This small honor is not one that I had 
to pull out of the thin air; for Newt Gra-
ham's fondest dream for many long years 
was the development of the Arkansas 
River Basin. Why, I can remember Newt 
talking enthusiastically about his ideas 
when in some places along this little 
stream it was so narrow you could step 
across it. And you can imagine what a, 
good many of the home folk thought 
about such a "wild dream" at that early 
stage. 
But my good friend did not falter. He 
kept right on working toward his goal. 
And I can remember the magnificent 
job he did in selling this project to one 
Governor after another who had never 
heard of such a thing?one of them 
being the late Senator Kerr when he 
was Governor. Newt Graham just was 
not fickle?he carried a torch for this 
dream to the end. 
For as long as I can remember almost, 
my dear and personal friend kept at 
this post of duty, with great vision, and 
I feel did more than any other man to 
to get the Arkansas River develop-
ment basin started. Year in and year 
out, season in and season out, Newt's 
work never ceased in this endeavor. 
A few years ago, dear old Newt passed 
away without living long enough to see 
the completion of his finest dream; and 
perhaps without realizing the great 
gratitude that not only Oklahomans felt 
for him, but also the folk in Arkansas 
and Kansas?for the Arkansas River de-
velopment basin has literally meant the 
life of a good many locations in these 
States. 
I am happy and honored to try in some 
small way to perpetuate the memory of 
this fine Oklahoman by asking that this 
lock and dam and the lake be created 
in tribute to him. And I know this will 
meet with the great approval of the 
thousands of friends Newt has in Okla-
homa, Kansas, and Arkansas, who knew 
him over those trying years. 
Someone has wisely said that the good 
a man does lives after him. This is 
certainly proved true in the case of my 
dear friend, Newt Graham. 
JOB CORPS DISCIPLINE 
(Mr. QUIE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. QUIE. Mr. Speaker, on January 
7, 1966, my colleague, the gentleman from 
New York [Mr. GOODELL] and I took the 
floor to discuss a serious incident that 
occurred at a Job Corps Camp in Moun-
tain Home, Idaho. We described an at-
tack by a Job Corps enrollee on a fellow 
corpsman. The reason that we brought 
the attention of our colleagues to this 
unfortunate occurrence was to point out 
the lax enrollment and disciplinary pro-
cedure of 0E0 that is endangering the 
entire Job Corps concept. 
I am gratified to learn that other per-
sons, more intimately involved with Job 
Corps operations, are also concerned 
about present procedures and share our 
desire to see the potential of the Job 
Corps concept be fulfilled. 
The Washington Evening Star carried 
a front-page article yesterday, March 2, 
which described a directive issued by Mr. 
Charles H. Stoddard, Director of the Bu-
reau of Land Management which runs 
six Job Corps centers, including the one 
In Mountain Home, Idaho. According 
to the Star, the directive orders directors 
of Interior Department Job Corps cen-
ters to disregard procedures established 
by 0E0 that no enrollees may be dis-
missed without clearance by 0E0. Mr. 
Stoddard says that his camp directors, 
contrary to 0E0 policy, may refuse to 
accept enrollees whose advance records 
indicate the enrollee has a history of 
serious and repeated law offenses. 
Serious disciplinary problems are said 
to be caused in the centers by present 
policies and, as an example of such prob-
lems, Mr. Stoddard described the same 
Incident to which Congressman GOODELL 
and I referred about a month ago. In 
the words of Mr. Stoddard: 
On October 19, 1965, we were notified by 
the center director at Mountain Home that 
18 enrollees of a group of 37 scheduled for in-
put at his center had criminal records, 
several with serious and repeated offenses. In 
spite of appeals from the center director and 
from the departmental Job Corps staff, 0E0 
proceeded with the scheduled input. One 
of these enrollees performed the stabbing 
which led to the recent notoriety at that 
center. 
I might remind my colleagues that in 
answer to our remarks about this same

incident in January, one of our col-
leagues stated that the Job Corps au-
thorities at Mountain Home had no 
knowledge of the criminal record of Mr. 
Jones. The Office of Economic Op-
portunity did not give my colleagues the 
correct information. The welfare of 
Job Corps enrollees is being sacrificed to 
maintain a favorable public relations 
image for 0E0. 
would like to commend Mr. Stoddard 
for his forthright stand in recognizing 
the problems in the operation of the Job 
Corps program and taking measures to 
correct them. It is regrettable that one 
Federal agency has to defy another 
agency, but I hope that 0E0 will soon 
adopt the wise and sound policy accept-
able to Mr. Stoddard. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask permission at this 
point to include the article from the 
Nvening Star: 
(iorom. the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star, 
Mar. 2, 1966) 
OUST UNSUITAELE BOYS, SIX Jon CORPS UNITS 
TOID?BunEACT OF LAND MANAGEMENT ACT-
ING ALSO TO BAR FURTHER PROI3LEM RE-
CRUITS 
illy Orr Kelly) 
Tee directors of the six Job Corps Conserva-
tion Centers operated by the Bureau of Land 
Management have been ordered to refuse to 
accept delivery of problem boys and to dis-
charge unsuitable corpsmen. 
Charles H. Stoddard, Director of the Bu-
reau, said he had held up the effective date 
of the order during the negotiations with 
the Office of :Economic Opportunity but that 
it would go into effect in a week. 
Ms order, issued in a teletype message 
February 24. is the first open break between 
0E0 and the head of one of the many Gov-
ernment agencies that operate the Job Corps 
camps. Many others, however, are reported 
to be as disturbed as Stoddard. 
SItocidard's order, which was obtained by 
the Star from sources outside the Depart-
ment of the Interior, said: 
111,(CHARGES URGED 
"Ti, is apparent from continuing incidents 
at your centers that poor screening of candi-
dates for enrollment in the program has and, 
is having a deleterious effect on the program. 
Additionally. your tack of authority to imme-
diately discharge unsuitable corpsmen has 
led to serious troubles in maintaining dis-
"For above reasons I direct you to review 
records you now have on your corpsmen and 
to discharge immediately any who show a, 
history of serious and repeated offenses 
against persons or propery, extreme sexual 
deviation, or emotional disturbances.. 
"You will take this action without regard 
to procedures established by 0E0 when delay 
will cause overburdening of your staff, ad-
verse community relations, escalation of dis-
cipline problems with other corpsmen, or 
serious morale problems at your center. 
REJECTIONS ORDERED 
"As you receive additional new enrollees 
and advance records indicate problems of the 
stature stated above, you will not accept de-
livery of corpsmen but will return them to 
their homes immediately. 
"Should you be questioned from any source 
as to your authority to take the above ac-
tions, you will quote this communication 
erorn me." 
Stoddard said the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, a part of the Interior Department, op-
erates the six Job Corps centers with money 
appropriated for that purpose. The centers 
have an enrollment of about 1,000 youths, 
with a weekly turnover of about 5 percent, he 
said. 
The 0E0 retains control over education 
and discipline, he said, and all cases involv-
ing major disciplinary action must be cleared 
with 0E0 in Washington. "It is days and 
sometimes weeks," he said "before a decision 
comes back from Washington." 
SPECIFIC CASES SOUGHT 
Directors of the centers have bee a asked to 
send Stoddard reports of specific cases to 
back up his order giving them disciplinary 
authority. 
"T hope to have a good, tight case in a 
week or so." he said. 
Stoddard said he had heard nettling di-
rectly from 0E0 since his order wee L out, but 
"we've been talking to them for a year and 
getting nowhere." 
One of Stoddard's major compla as is that 
the 0110 does not operate screening centers 
and the result has been that youths with 
criminal records and serious emotional dis-
turbances have caused serious problems at 
the Job Corps centers. 
In a memorandum to Secretary of the In-
terior Stewart L. Udall telling iibout his 
order, Stoddard said: 
"Over many years the :BLM has built favor-
able relations with communities in which 
our field operations are situated. Assurance 
was given the public that youths who show 
a history of serious and repeated offenses 
against persons or property would not be en-
rolled in the program, This has nob been the 
cafe. 
"To illustrate this point, I cite the diffi-
culties experienced at our center st Moun-
tain Home. Idaho, which was the subject of 
considerable discussion recently in Lim House 
of Represeiatatives. 
"On October 19, 1965, we were notified by 
the center director at Mountain Dome that 
18 enrollees of a group of 37 scheduled for 
input at .nis center had criminal records, 
several wish serious and repeated offenses. 
In spite of appeals from the center director 
and from :he departmental Job Corps staff, 
0E0 proceeded with the scheduled input. 
One of these enrollees performed the stab-
bing which led to the recent notoriety at that 
center." 
OTHER INCIDENTS CTIED 
In a separate state:ment of the underlying 
reasons for his order, Stoddard cited a num-
ber of other incidents and said: 
"This series of events need not have oc-
curred. From the beginning the record will 
show that I have asked for disciplinary au-
thority on the part of center director who 
is in the final analysis as responsible for his 
camp as the captain of his ship. 
'Furthermore, I have exhausted every 
channel of communication to urge 0E0 to 
establish reception centers as a means of 
screening misfits, outfitting, providing medi-
cal examinations and adequate orientation 
prior to arrival at camp * *. 
'Many people in the national .conserva-
than movement who worked strongiy for the 
passage of the Antipoverty Act did so only 
because the Youth Conservation Corps pro-
gram was an. integral part of it. They are 
deeply concerned over the failure to date, 
and wish 1 o see corrective action taken im-
mediately. 
POORER QUALITY DUE 
"But in December the Federal conserva-
tion agency liaison people were told that 
the enrollee input would be of poorer quality 
than previously and that boys not capable 
of meeting urban center standards would go 
to conservation centers. If these moves were 
not calculated to ruin the program this 
could be their Only result. 
"If 0E0 will establish reception centers 
and delegate adequate disciplinary authority 
to Job Corps camp directors, those easily 
preventable situations will not occur. As 
soon as this is done, I will be glad Lo rescind 
my order of February 24. Furthermore, I 
will request a leave of absence from the Sec-
retary of Interior to direct this program into 
a successful operation." 
The Bureau operates Job Corps Centers at 
Kingman, Ariz., Mountain Home, Idaho, 
Antelope Mesa, Nev., Fort Vannoy and Tilla-
mook, Oreg., and Castle Valley, Utah. 
Other centers are operated by Interior's 
Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau ,if Sport 
Fisheries and Wildlife, National Park Serv-
ice, and Bureau of Indian Affairs, the De-
partment of Agriculture's Forest Service, 
and the California Resources Agency. 
JOB CORPS 
(Mr. GIBBONS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GIBBONS, Mr. Speaker, I do not 
have any prepared remarks, but I have 
done some on-the-spot investigation of 
the charge that has just been made here 
by my colleague, the gentleman from 
Minnesota [Mr. QuiE] . I talked to Mr. 
Stoddard last night as soon as the article 
to which the gentleman referred ap-
peared in the newspaper, and he ap-
peared at my request in my office this 
morning. 
I said, "Mr. Stoddard, let me see the 
documentation you have for this charge. 
How many people do you know of? How 
many corpsmen have you asked to have 
discharged because of their character 
and record?" I said, "Has it been more 
than 100?" He did not know. I said, 
"Has it been less than 10?" He did not 
know. 
I submit to my colleagues this man is 
the kind of man who, when he secs a fire, 
would throw gasoline on it rather than 
try to put it out. 
The whole purpose of the Economic 
Opportunity Act and the Job Corps Cen-
ters is to take disadvantaged people from 
disadvantaged surroundings and try to 
uplift them, try to make productive citi-
zens out of them. That is what we are 
trying to do. 
When you deal with this segment of 
society, you are going to have a few prob-
lems. We cannot run away from those 
problems. These problems exist. We as 
Americans and Christians have a re-
sponsibility to do something about them. 
I would suggest that my colleague pay 
a little more attention to how these 
camps are operated and not criticize so 
much. If he does criticize, I suggest that 
he get his facts straight.

MOST SENSIBLE RECOMMENDA-
TIONS ON VIETNAM MADE BY 
SENATOR STUART SYMINGTON 
(Mr. HULL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute, to revise and extend his remarks, 
and to include an editorial.) 
Mr. HULL. Mr. Speaker, the most 
sensible recommendations on Vietnam 
made in recent weeks are those advanced 
by Senator SWART SYMINGTON, Of 
Missouri. 
He believes that the United States 
should take those measures necessary to 
win in Vietnam and I am absolutely cer-
tain that a great majority of Americans 
agree with him, 
Under leave to extend my remarks, I 
enclose a copy of an editorial in support 
of Senator SYMINGTON'S position, written 
by Joseph R. Snyder in the Gallatin, Mo., 
Democrat: 
SymiNcrox's VIEWS 
Of all the people in high Government 
places who have issued public statements 
on the war in southeast Asia, the words of 
Missouri's own Senator STUART SYIVIINGTON 
conic closest to matching the thoughts this 
newspaper has entertained. Of all the people 
in Government, outside our generals in the 
Military Establishment, we are more inclined 
to trust SYmiNaToN's judgment 011 the situ-
ation than any other. Happily his views are 
largely shared by the military. 
There is, of course, a realistic way to win 
the war In Vietnam. Senator SYMINGTON is 
persistently urging It upon President John-
son and his advisers. The Senator has an 
exceptionally fine background of Government 
service in areas of defense upon which to base 
his views. He has projected his opinions to 
the public only after completion of a several 
weeks visit in the Far East during which he 
was able to obtain vital information on the 
spot. 
That war can be ended and many lives 
saved, the Senator asserts, by a. blockade and 
mining of Haiphong waters, which is the 
principal North Vietnamese port. This 
could cut off about 80 percent of the supplies 
reaching the Vietcong. 
SYMINGTON also urges air attacks on im-
portant military targets such as powerplants, 
oil supply, clocks, etc., to destroy the Viet-
cong's capacity to wage war. He further 
recommends fuller use of U.S. naval power 
to pound enemy troop concentrations and 
supply lines along the coastal areas. 
As he so aptly puts it: "We should either 
move ahead or move out." It is our feeling 
that a majority, of Americans feel the same 
way about this conflict. We commend him 
for hammering away at this theme. 
History shows that limited war in south-
east Asia is a failure. It is not the American 
way to give the enemy every advantage, per-
mitting him to choose the time and place of 
battle and sanctuaries from which he can 
attack, fall back, gain strength, and then 
attack again. 
It is our opinion that once America de-
cides a situation has become so intolerable 
we must take action on the field of battle, 
Congress should authorize the conflict by a 
formal declaration of war. We do not like 
one man?the President, no matter who he 
is?having the power to commit this Nation 
to war without approval from the people 
through Congress. We also do not like a war 
being fought by a relatively few while the 
Government pretends "business as usual" 
and hopes the public won't notice the cas-
ualty lists. 
It is our belief that once the United States 
Is committed to battle; we should go on a 
war footing and end the fighting as quickly 
as possible. We further believe that military 
decisions should be left to military people. 
Had this been done in the past we would 
not now be fighting in Vietnam. 
The question of whether we should be in 
Vietnam at all is not the point of this edi-
torial. We recall with irony, however, that 
every top general we have had has warned 
against becoming involved in a land war in 
Asia. 
We believe the American people will sup-
port the action called for by Senator SYMING. 
'TON. We believe they are tired of the lack 
of decision and purpose displayed thus far. 
We believe they want a victory in Vietnam 
as quickly as possible and a halt to con-
fusion and half answers. Ho CM Minh will 
not be ready to talk peace until he's hurt. 
We must make the cost of aggression too 
high to endure. 
APOLOGY AND CLARIFICATION RE-
QUIRED ON RELEASE STATING 
THAT FBI WAS BEING ORDERED 
TO INVESTIGATE REGISTRATION 
PRACTICES IN "SAMPLE COUN-
TIES" IN TEXAS 
(Mr. CABELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute, to revise and extend his remarks, 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. CABELL. Mr. Speaker, in view of 
an ill-conceived release from the Office 
4637 
of the Attorney General that implies an 
Indictment of the people of my district 
and of my State of Texas, I consider a 
clarification and an apology to be in 
order. 
This release stated that the FBI was 
being ordered to investigate registration 
practices in "sample counties" in Texas. 
No such implied indictment can be al-
lowed to go unchallenged. I, therefore, 
submit for the RECORD my reply to the 
Attorney General: 
lVfarCen 3, 1986. 
Hon. NICIIOLAS DED KATZENBACH, 
The Attorney General, 
The Department of Justice, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Never in my 
career as a citizen-businessman, a municipal 
official or more lately, as a Member of Con-
gress, have I observed such a flagrant, and 
cheap, abuse of power as that recently dem-
onstrated by your appointment of voter reg-
istration "monitors" in Texas, and particu-
larly in my home district of Dallas County. 
Not only is this a debasement of your 
hitherto respected office, it is also a debase-
ment of many fine segments of our society 
and Is a relegation of one of our most re-
spected agencies (FBI) to the status of a 
cheap political tool. 
The victims of the insult include: 
1. The Negro citizens of Dallas County and 
Texas. They have consistently exercised 
their voting franchise, without any form of 
coercion. In 1964, the Negro citizen quali-
fied by registration or by payment of poll 
tax, a higher percentage of their potential 
than did their white counterparts. 
2. The white citizenship of Dallas County 
and the State of Texas, and all elected offi-
cials. They have consistently provided un-
told numbers of volunteers, both white and 
Negro, who were deputized to issue registra-
tions and poll tax receipts, and who worked 
diligently in all communities from the pe-
riod, October 1, 1965, through January 31, 
1966. All of this was done without reference 
to race or color. 
3. The Dallas County leadership of both 
political parties. All these leaders have en-
couraged voter participation of all races, and 
they have endorsed the candidacy of Negroes 
as nominees of both parties to the State leg-
islature in the forthcoming elections. 
4. The Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Through the years they have enjoyed world 
renown as the most respected such organi-
zation in the world. If the duties of the 
Bureau are to be reduced to such muckrak-
ing, then the present high caliber personnel 
will neither be needed, nor be retained. 
As a citizen, and as a public official, I wel-
come any legitimate investigation, but I defi-
nitely question the motives behind this one. 
When has It been the practice of the FBI to 
publicize and signal its intention to conduct 
an investigation on all subjects? Publica-
tion of such intent 18 an indictment, per se. 
In the eyes of the general public. 
In closing, let me express the hope that 
this decision was the brainchild of an un-
qualified underling, and that clarification, 
and apology, will be forthcoming from your 
office. 
Respectfully yours, 
EARLE CABELL, 
Member of Congress. 
FREEDOM'S BEACON 
(Mr. PRICE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute, and to revise and extend his re-
marks and include an editorial.) 
Mr. PRICE. Mr. Speaker, the Chi-
cago Daily News points out in a recent 
editorial:

4638 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE March 3, 1966 
In one of his most eloquent speeches, 
President Johnson answered 10 questions 
still being asked about Vietnam, within the 
broad context of. freedom and what freedom 
means. 
It goes on to say: 
Whet emerged was not only a clearer defini-
tion of the self-imposed limits operative in 
eentheast Asia, but a clearer vision of Amer-
ican aspirations and the guidelines for world 
leadership as the President sees them. 
The paper believes that: 
Surely freedom is at the heart of the 
struggle in Vietnam and no less involved in 
the great issues of race, religion, and politics 
that suffuse both the domestic and the in-
ternational scene. And freedom was and is 
the beacon that the United States has held 
aloft for the world. 
The aopraisal given by the Chicago 
Daily News will be of interest to others, 
and because many will want to read the 
editorial in its entirety I herewith offer 
it for publication in the RECORD: 
011E1MOM'S ilsemon 
The critics of the administration's Viet-
nam policy?the hawks and the doves and 
the dawks---have all had their turns at peck-
ing In recent days. Wednesday night came 
the turn of the man who alone bears the 
burden of final decision. 
In one of hie most eloquent speeches, 
President Johnson answered 10 questions 
still being asked about Vietnam, within the 
broad context of freedom and what freedom 
means. What emerged was not only a 
clearer definition of the self-imposed limits 
operative in southeast Asia, but a clearer 
vision of American aspirations and the guide-
Mies for world leadership as the President 
sees them. 
For the doves, Mr. Johnson had reassor-
aoce that the United States is not "caught 
in a blind escalation of force that is pulling 
us headlong toward a wider war." For the 
hawks, he had the promise that aggression 
will continue to be opposed by whatever 
Mille is required to stop it. POT the govern-
ment in Hanoi, he had a warning that free 
discussion in a free nation means neither 
weakness nor indecision: 
"We are united in our commitment to free 
eiscrission. So also we are united in our de-
termination that no foe anywhere should 
mistake our arguments for indecision----or 
our debates for weakness." 
But in addressing Freedom House and ac-
cepting its award, the President also took the 
occasion to reevaluate and expand a vision 
or a quarter-century ago. Harking back to 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's "four freedoms," he 
noted the considerable progress America has 
made toward achieving the goals of freedom 
from want end fear, and preserving freedom 
pa speech and worship. 
Then, to the original four, he added three 
oil his; own: Freedom to learn? freedom to 
grow, freedom to hope. 
fdke his idol, President Roosevelt, Lyndon 
Johnson put his "freedoms" in a global set-
ting, not as goals merely for Americans, but 
for al/ mankind. There is, in this declara-
tims an extension of a pattern that has been 
evolving In Mr. Johnson's recent messages on 
foreign policy and foreign aid, and especially 
in his emphasis on the civilian aspects of the 
at 711ggle in Vietnam. 
Some may see the emerging pattern as an 
attempt to export the Great Society before 
WP have made adequate progress in building 
It here. Others may gee it as unconscionable 
meddling or a meaningless mixture of corn 
and polities. Still others may view it as un-
bridled idealism?lovely to look at but with-
out substance. 
There may indeed be some or all of these 
elements in Mr. Johnson's vision of freedom 
11/r4q, 11111 
in a world that has too little of it. Yet 
surely freedom is at the heart of the struggle 
in Vietnam and no less involved in the great 
issues of race, religion, and politics that sUf-
fuse both the domestic and the international 
scene. And freedom was and is the beacon 
that the United States has held aloft for the 
world. 
Perha.ps the world will understand us a 
little better because of what Mr. Johnson 
said Wednesday night and see us for what 
we a .e ? a nation striving in as; imperfect way 
to k ndle the aspirations of mankind and 
lead- -or at least point?the way toward a 
better life in a freer world. 
LEGISLATION TO REGULATE COM-
MUNITY ANTENNA SYSTEMS 
(Ma. STAGGERS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute, to revise and extend 
his remarks, and to include pertinent 
material.) 
Mr. STAGGERS. Mr. Speaker, I am 
introducing today a bill which has been 
submitted by the Federal Communica-
tions Commission which would authorize 
the Commission to issue lines and regur 
lotions with respect to community an-
tenna systems. This bill has been sub-
mitted to the Congress in accordance 
with the Commission's earlier statement 
that it would recommend legislation in 
this urea. 
Mr. Speaker? in order th advise the 
Members of the House and the public 
in general of the reasons which moved 
the Commission to submit this particular 
bill, I am including in the Roo:me at this 
point the text of the bill, an explanation 
of the bill submitted by the Commission, 
and a letter from Chairman Henry ad-

EXPLANATION OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO 
THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS 
AMENDED, CONCERNING REGULATION OF COM-
MUNITY ANTENNA SYSTEMS 
These proposals for amendments to the 
Communications Act are submitted pursuant 
to the Commission's determination, an-
nounced in its public notice of February 15, 
1966, that it would make the following rec-
ommendations for legislation to the Con-
gress: 
(a) Clarification and confirmition of FCC 
jurisdiction over CATV ,systems generally, 
along with such spechic provisions as are 
deemed apprtmriate. 
(b) Prohibition of the originetion of pro-
gram or other material by a CATV system 
with such limitations or exceptions, if any, 
as are deemed appropriate. 
(c) Consideration of whether, to what ex-
tent, and under what circunisi slices CATV 
systems should be required to obtain the 
consent of the originating broadcast station 
for the retransmission of the signal by the 
CATV system. 
(d) Consideration of whether CATV sys-
tems should or should not be deemed public 
utilities. In this connection, Congress will be 
asked to consider the appropriate relation-
ship of Federal to State-local jurisdiction in 
the CATV field, with particular reference to 
initial franchising, rate regulation, and ex-
tension of service. 
The Commission has determined that it 
has jurisdiction over all CATV systems, and 
it has asserted that jurisdiction to the extent 
necessary to carry out the announced regu-
latory program. However, given the im-
portance of CATV, we believe it highly desir-
able that Congress amend the Communica-
tions Act to confirm that jurisdiction and to 
establish such basic national piney as it 
deems appropriate. 
The proposed new subsection :3(h) of the 
Communications Act broadly defines a "com-
munity antenna system" to include any 
which receives broadcast signals over 
the air , and distributes them by means of 
wire or cable to subscribing members of the 
public. While the definition is all-inclusive, 
we believe it is unnecessary to impose regu-
lations on all systems. Therefore, the pro-
posed new section 331(a) (2) would empower 
the Commission to exempt from regulation, 
by general rule, systems, which. because of 
1 Both radio and television signals are in-
cluded. While we are aware of no commu-
nity antenna system which now distributes 
only radio signals, some systems do distribute 
signals from both radio and television broad-
cast stations. 
2 This would include signals received direct-
ly off the air from a broadcast station, as 
well as those broadcast and then relayed by 
means of a microwave relay system.

A Sellout Coming in Vietnam? 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ROBERT H. MICHEL 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 1966 
Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Speaker, is a 
shapeup for the sellout gaining mo-
mentum? I bring to the attention of my 
colleagues a column which appeared in 
the Miami Herald, which indicates that 
the Johnson administration is thinking 
more and more in terms of negotiating 
any kind of peace to get us out of the 
Vietnam war. 
Peace with honor was once the by-
word of this Nation. We have made vast 
commitments of men and materials to 
Vietnam. Has our conduct of military 
operations been so misguided that we 
are now on the verge of admitting 
defeat? 
I suggest that my colleagues read this 
thoughtful analysis of our present po-
sition in Vietnam. A text of the column 
follows: 
A MODERATE FonzszEs DEFEAT FOR OUR 
VIETNAM EFFORTS 
(By Edwin A. Lahey) 
WAsHnicrox.?A friend who is a U.S. 
Senator made an observation the other 
evening that seemed to be the most signifi-
cant thing I've heard about the Vietnam 
crisis in some time. 
This Senator expressed the belief that 
President Johnson, if and when it became 
necessary, could take to the television and 
convince the citizens of this country that 
they had to accept humiliation and a failure 
of mission in South Vietnam. 
This comes from a thoughtful and 
troubled man, who has been neither an ap-
peaser nor a bombardier in his public 
utterances. The importance of his words 
lies in the implication that the middle 
ground Members of Congress, and perhaps 
the bewildered citizens of the Nation, are 
getting ready for the excruciating experience 
of throwing in the towel. 
It is difficult to believe that a President 
could do this and get away with it politi-
cally. Johnson would be torn to _shreds as 
an appeaser. And the Democrats would have 
a terrible monkey on their back in the 1966 
campaign. 
But we did it in Korea. Once the military 
caskets began showing up in the United 
States in fearsome numbers, it became possi-
ble to negotiate a truce which after 16 years 
is most precarious. 
Facing the reality of a failure of mission 
will be all the more difficult because of the 
propaganda that the White House, the 
Pentagon, and the Department of State have 
fed the people these many years about our 
commitment in South Vietnam. 
Despite all - the hopeful predictions, 
despite all the increased bombing pressure, 
the grim reality of Vietnam control of much 
of South Vietnam continues to stare at us 
as the big fact of the war out there. 
And, they may have to face up to the 
problem in that we cannot negotiate a peace 
unless we talk with the guerrillas who have 
been dug in all the time. In effect, we will 
have to negotiate with burglars who have 
taken over the upper floors of the house. 
The first day we negotiate with the Viet-
cong we repudiate the government in. Saigon, 
and they go clown the drain. After all the 
months and years of mish-mash that we have 
been "defending freedom," out in South 
Vietnam, the repudiation of our wards in 
Saigon will come as a pretty tough blow. 
But when moderate men are speaking 
privately of President Johnson's ability to 
make the American people accept the hu-
miliation of defeat, it may be later than they 
think over in the Pentagon. 
Additional Federal Judges and Districts 
SPEECH 
OF 
HON. HENRY S. REUSS 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 1966 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (IL Res. 734) provid-
ing for consideration of S. 1666, a bill to 
provide for the appointment of additional 
circuit and district judges, and for other 
purposes. 
Mr. REUSS. Mr. Chairman, I strong-
ly support S. 1066, to provide additional 
district and circuit judges. 
In the eastern district of Wisconsin?
which encompasses territory with about 
two-thirds of the State's population, its 
highest growth rates, and its chief cen-
ters of industry and commerce?there 
has long been a need for additional ju-
dicial manpower. 
As of June 30, 1963, 11.6 percent of the 
pending cases ready for trial in the east-
ern district of Wisconsin were more than 
3 years old. For the Nation the figure 
was only 8.4 percent. 
At that time, the median period from 
filing to disposition of cases was 29 
months in the eastern district of Wis-
consin and only 16 months on the aver-
age across the Nation. 
Litigation was being seriously delayed 
and this was of great concern to all who 
recognize the validity of the maxim that 
justice delayed is frequently justice de-
nied. 
In October, 1963, I introduced legis-
lation to provide a third Federal judge 
In the eastern district of Wisconsin. The 
bill was referred to the Judicial Con-
ference which in March, 1965 recom-
mended an additional judge for the east-
ern district of Wisconsin, on a temporary 
basis. 
The Judicial Conference's recommen-
dation is included in the excellent leg-
islation before us today. 
The passage of this bill and the ap-
pointment of an additional judge of the 
eastern district of Wisconsin will pro-
vide for the elimination of the large 
backlog of pending cases and will sub-
stantially improve the administration of 
justice in that district. It will alleviate 
the very heavy burden on our present 
Judges, Robert E. Tehan and John Rey-
nolds. 
My only regret is that the judgeship 
for Wisconsin will be temporary. 
With the bar of the eastern district 
of Wisconsin, I believe that Wisconsin's 
eastern district already needs three 
permanent judgeships. If this need is 
not yet clear?as the Judicial Conference 
and the Judiciary Committee appear to 
believe?surely the eastern district of 
Wisconsin is on the brink of having a 
continuing workload that would fully 
justify three permanent judgeships. 
As the judicial business of the district 
continues to grow, I hope that Congress 
will make the third judgeship perma-
nent. 
Our Presence in South Vietnam 
IN) SPEECH 
or 
HON. JOHN BUCHANAN 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 1966 
The SPEAKER. Under previous or-
der of the House, the gentleman from 
Alabama [Mr. BUCHANAN] is recognized 
for 60 minutes. 
(Mr. BUCHANAN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re- . 
marks, and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, for 
some weeks now debate has raged and 
many questions have been asked con-
cerning the rightness of our presence in 
South Vietnam and the rightness or 
wrongness of the way in which we are 
conducting our mission there. 
It was my privilege, within the past 
two weeks to visit southeast Asia on the 
occasion of the Lincoln Day recess. I 
felt there could be no more appropriate 
way to spend it than with our troops who 
are fighting for human freedom in South 
Vietnam. So it was I spent 6 'days in 
the field, observing our men, what they 
are doing, and how they are doing it. 
This trip was not made at Government 
expense, but was financed by friends in 
my district, and it had a rather special 
purpose. 
BIR1VIINGIIAM'S ADOPTION OF 1ST INFANTRY 
Back in January I informed the House 
that during the fall recess my city had 
adopted the 1st Infantry Division. We 
did so as a sign of our support for the 
men in Vietnam, for our soldiers, and 
for what they were attempting to 'do 
there. This idea was first conceived by 
retired Brig. Gen. Edward M. Friend, Jr. 
It was a good choice. 
The Big Red One is this country's old-
est division, and has an outstanding and 
much-decorated history. It was first to 
shed American blood in France in World 
War I, and it was the first to land in 
North Africa in World War II. It spear-
headed the conquest of Sicily; it stormed 
across Omaha Beach in the D-day as-
sault at Normandy, and was first to be in 
Germany. It was the first infantry di-
vision to sweep across the line into 
Czechoslovakia, the farthest advance of 
'U.S. troops in World War II. The 1st 
Division is now distinguishing itself in 
the battle for the freedom of the people 
of Vietnam. It was my pleasure to go as

A1174 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- APPENDIX March /966 
the people's representative to tell these 
fghting men of our support for them 
and our pride in them. 
Mr. Speaker, the idea of this adoption 
became a reality when the mayor of the 
city of Birmingham, the president of 
the county commission, the Birming-
ham Chamber of Commerce, the Bir-
mingham News, and others, got together 
to organize a coordinated council of dis-
tinguished citizens. It was fulfilled by 
the overwhelming support of the people 
foe Birmingham. In this plan, particular 
civic groups and other organizations are 
serving as sponsoring or adopting units 
For particular units of the let Division. 
While there have been many letters, 
Christmas gifts sent, and so forth, to 
individual soldiers by sponsoring groups, 
the primary emphasis has been on joint 
Projects for the benefit of the Vietnamese 
people in the III Corps area. For ex-
ample, the Birmingham Retail Druggists 
Aasociation has donated medicines and 
supplies for use in dispensaries set up by 
the 1st Division for citizens of hamlets 
and villages there_ Many hundreds of 
ptople are receiving medical help here-
tofore not available from any source in 
this way. Berry. High School in Bir-
mingham has adopted an orphanage. 
The list of such activities goes on and on. 
At the kickoff of this project, Sgt. Maj. 
Bill Woolridge of the 1st Division. 
came to Birmingham to represent the Big 
Red One. He promptly won the hearts 
of our city for himself and for his divis-
ion. Later. the Birmingham News sent 
two representatives, All Van Hoose, cor-
respondent, and Tony Faletta, photog-
rapher, to cover the 1st Infantry's 
operation and to provide the communica-
tions necessary to maintain the relation-
ship. These two fine ambassadors for 
Birmingham accompanied me through-
out my tour in Vietnam. 
yEsTTONS NEEDING ANSWERS 
There was a second reason for my 
visit. I have many constituents arid 
sons of constituents who are engaged in 
the Vietnamese action, and I have per-
sonally written too many letters to the 
parents and to the wives of servicemen 
who have given their last full measure of 
devotion for the freedom of southeast 
Asia. 
enerefore, in my own mind, as I know 
ha:; been the case with many Members, 
there were questions: Is what we are 
doing in Vietnam necessary? Are we 
doing it right? Can we succeed in our 
mission? How is the morale of our 
troops? Are they adequately trained? 
And are they adequately supplied? 
'l'o seek out the answers, spent 2 
days in the field with the 1st Infantry, 
touching all its units and operations, 
then the balance of my time touring from 
the engineering miracle of Cam Rhan 
Bay to the Marine's domain in Da Nang 
ana the far north; touching all our major 
Forces, plus the crack Republic of Korea 
Tiger Division; visiting the "golf course"' 
at Ankhe and spending the night on 
America's nuclear-powered Enterprise, 
witli its awesome striking power. 
came back encouraged and inspired 
by what I found in Vietnam. There has 
never been a more classic case of good 
versus evil, light versus darkness, free-
dom versus tyranny than the struggle 
in which vie are now engaged. Nor has 
America ever produced ? finer soldiers 
than the officers and men of the Military 
Assistance Command, Vietnam. 
Our forces are in large part made up 
of and led by regulars, fine professional 
American soldiers. Yet there are also 
represented young draftees and volun-
teers, taken away from a life here which 
had every reason to make them soft 
at an age in which they could not be 
expected to yet be men. To all the 
doubters of the strength or virtue of this 
Nation's youth I must report that these 
magnificent young Americans who are 
fighting in Vietnam are their Nation's 
crowning glory. They are not soft and 
they are fully men. They are the finest 
soldiers a great military tradition has 
yet produced. From where I ;s;tand, they 
look 10 feet tall. 
Typical was a young man E met in a 
field hospital who could not have been 
more than 20?blond hair, young face, 
young-old eyes and a fine, muocular body 
minus one leg, lost to a Vietcoeg mine. 
He said: 
It's all :right, sir. I know whs I've been 
fighting for. 
This conviction was repeated by every 
American. I met in Vietnam. Would 
God the Congress?all the Congress?
could know as well. 
IS VIETNAM I ECESSARY 
Is such a costly action as this really 
necessaey? In answer, we =et face two 
great giim realities about southeast Asia 
in our time. 
The first is the fact?the reality of 
Communist aggression?the aggressive 
acts of a tyranny which would impose 
its iron :rule upon the people of all 
southeast Asia if it were permitted to do 
so. In Vietnam we face the present and 
continuing aggression on the part of 
North Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh that 
is continuing every week of every month 
at this time. But it is not only a present 
aggression, an aggression we are sworn 
to act against and committed to act 
against. It is also a longrun aggression. 
Ho Chi Minh has been working for 20 
years to establish his rule in Vietnam. 
The infiltration of subversion and the 
terrorism in South Vietnam sponsored 
from the north?these things have gone 
on not for months but for years and be-
cause for years he has been working to 
infiltrate and to subvert and to capture 
control of South Vietnam and of its 
people, the Communists of the Vietcong 
are thoroughly woven into the fabric of 
the society of the Republic of Vietnam. 
They are deeply entrenched. They are 
interwoven into the whole life of the 
society. 
They are imbedded and they are in a 
position :30 intermingled with the rest of 
the people of South Vietnam that their 
removal is a slow and painful and step-
by-step process. This lon.grun aggres-
sion makes of this present action in 
Vietnam a unique kind of warfare in our 
history in which we are combating not 
only the regular troops in the field, 
where we can find them and get them to 
face us, but in which we are struggling 
against a very insidious kind of guer-
rilla wart are. 
A REIGN OF FORCE AND EL AR 
The reign of the Vietcong where they 
do have power and influence is not one 
of the love of peace or democracy, it is 
gangster government. It can beat be 
compared to the influence and PUa of:- of 
the Cosa Nostra?the underworld?an 
this country. Sixty-five percent of their 
actions are criminal rather than mill-
tary?crime..ss against people. 
The idea that there is any desire on 
the part of the Vietnamese people for the 
kind of goverrunent which regularly be-
heads those who disagree with it and 
which regularly uses as its methods, 
murder, torture, and terrorism and 
which rules by force and fear is ridicu-
lous in the extreme. The benefit to the 
people involved in permitting VC con-
trol of or participation in government is 
approximately equal to letting the under. 
worldtake over the government of Chi-
cago, or advocating that Bogaloosa, 
be run by the Ku Klux Klan. 
Mr. Speaker, the people of Vietnam are 
enduring a terrible kind of tyranny and 
persecution at the hands of the Vietcong. 
The aggression being committed in 
southeast Asia is a brutal and tyrannical 
aggression. There is nothing pretty 
about it. There is nothing in it that 
either conservatives or liberals in this 
country could reasonably defend. This 
rule of force and fear has been imposed 
upon large numbers of people in the Re-
public of Vietnam and has been sustained 
by terrorism. This is the first grim fact 
about southeast Asia. 
We see in Vietnam Communist aggres-
sion which, if left unrepelled and un-
checked, which if we bow before it and 
surrender, will extend to nation after 
nation until the millions of Asia are liv-
ing under the dark night of tyranny. 
This is the grim threat not only of the 
North Vietnamese but of the Red Chi-
nese aggression--the dark night of com-
munism which threatens all of southeast 
Asia is the first great reality that we naist 
face. 
THE NEED 
The second is the poverty of Asia. 
Americans are not prepared to see the 
poverty which fills Asia, and Vietnam is 
no exception. The condition of the peo-
ple stands in marked contrast to the star-
tling beauty of the land. Poverty, dis-
ease, illiteracy are everywhere. 
It is a wonderful thing that here in 
these United States where we have to 
search out the people to be the recipients 
of our poverty program and apparently 
have to use great dilligence to find these 
persons. But the fact is one does not 
have to look in Vietnam. 
One does not have to go anywhere at 
all to find poverty, disease, and illiteracy 
running rampant. It is unfortunate to 
have to say so but we were not left a 
very pretty legacy by the French. The 
citizens of Vietnam have been subject. 
peoples most of the time for hundreds 
of years, and for 70 years they were 
under the control of the French. 
Yet, when we see the legacy left us 
and to the Government of the Republic 
of Vietnam, we see a country in which 
there are virtually no public schools. We. 
see one in which various epidemics run 
rampant, and disease is everywhere, one

March 3, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPEN 
in which there is no kind of public health 
program, one in which there is great pov-
erty and no little hunger. 
We see one hi which there is one hos-
pital per province, and these poor by our 
star dartir:? There are only 100 doctors 
in the land and most of these are in-
accessible to the people. American mili-
tary medics, AID people, and private 
agencies have become literally the differ-
ence between sickness and health?and 
even life and death?for countless citi-
zens of this nation. 
So if we ask ourselves is it necessary 
for us to do what we are doing in Viet-
nam, we need to answer that question in 
the light of Communist aggression, which 
left unchecked, could threaten the free-
dom of all Asia and, indeed, all the 
world. 
We must also answer recognizing the 
poverty of Asia and the need of the peo-
ple for a life that is blessed with liberty, 
with human dignity, and with some op-
portunity for economic, medical, and 
agricultural advancement. 
OUR COMMITMENT 
We must also look at our solemn com-
mitments. Everything we are doing is 
in line with our commitments as a mem-
ber of SEATO and our specific commit-
ments to the Republic of Vietnam. 
Those are solemn contracts of this 
Government which must be solemnly ful-
filled. 
THE INVESTMENT 
We must look at what we are doing 
in the light of our investment in south-
east Asia. We have invested not only 
millions of dollars economically, but also 
that which is most precious in our land. 
Some of us for the first time voted the 
other day for an aid bill to provide eco-
nomic assistance to the people of south-
east Asia. 
The House of Representatives over-
whelmingly voted for that bill and for 
the bill this day, not only in the fulfill-
ment of our commitment, but as a sign 
of our willingness to make whatever 
further investment is necessary to ful-
fill our mission there. And well we 
should, for we have invested our young 
men in Asia, and any other investment 
pales to insignificance in the face of their 
sacrifice. 
During my visit to the 1st Infantry, 
I talked to a certain young soldier. He 
and another American had for some time 
been helping the people in a nearby Viet-
namese village build a school for their 
children. Having worked for several 
weeks without incident, they had relaxed 
their guard a bit and had set down their 
weapons a little too far away. Suddenly 
a group of Vietcong appeared from hid-
ing, grabbed the rifles, fired at the Amer-
icans, and ran away. One soldier was 
wounded, his buddy killed. This 
wounded soldier had requested to return 
to complete the project as soon as his 
'wounds permitted. "The school is not 
finished yet," he explained, "and besides, 
now I have got an investment." Amer-7 
lea's job is not finished yet, either, in 
Vietnam. And our investment is too 
great to turn back now. 
THE ALTERNATIVE 
Is it necessary to stay in Vietnam? 
Let us answer in terms of the future 
freedom and safety of all the world, be-
cause this, too, is at stake. The domino 
theory is not inaccurate, for if the ty-
rant sees he can succeed by aggression 
and by extending his tyranny, he will 
continue by force to so extend it, and he 
must be stopped still here and now. 
THE MORAL QUESTION 
Are we doing right in southeast Asia? 
There are the doves who say that we 
have no moral right to be doing what 
we are doing, and we ought to seek im-
mediate negotiations and not do any-
thing that might be interpreted as esca-
lation of the war, that we are the ag-
gressors, and we are the ones who are 
immoral. 
What are we doing, and are we doing 
it right? It seems" to me that in re-
sponse to the doubters of our land we 
need to recognize very fully and very 
firmly that the President has gone the 
second mile and has turned the other 
cheek in his attempt to find the road to 
peace. He has sought negotiations con-
sistently for a long period of time. He 
has explored through his own efforts and 
those of the Vice President, the Am-
bassador to the United Nations, the 
Secretary of State and others every ave-
nue that might lead toward negotiations 
and toward peace. 
He declared a cessation in the fighting, 
two holiday periods. He declared a ces-
sation in the bombing. He has persist-
ently sought the pathway to peace, to 
negotiation. And consistently Hanoi 
and Peiping have jeered at those efforts, 
and rejected them. They have rather 
used those times of unilateral peace 
moves on our part as times of reorgani-
zation, entrenchment, increasing sup-
plies and men into South Vietnam as 
times of increased aggressive action. 
Mr. Speaker, once, when I was a 10-
year-old boy, the lesson in Sunday School 
one Sunday morning made a great im-
pression on me. For some weeks another 
boy who lived two doors from my home 
and I had had a series of fist-fights al-
most every day over events that would 
develop. The Sunday School teacher 
said: 
One should turn the other cheek arid go 
the second mile. 
Being thereby converted, I told my 
friend the next morning that no matter 
what he did, my response would be to 
turn the other cheek and not fight back. 
He became delighted at the idea. He hit 
me on one cheek, I turned the other, and 
he hit me on that one, too. While I did 
not completely lose my religion, it 
seemed I had run out of cheeks to turn, 
and it became necessary for me to enter 
into fisticuffs with him to attempt to 
teach him to respect other people's 
religion. 
It seems to me that we have gone well 
past the second mile and we have turned 
all the checks that there are to turn in 
seeking the way to peace and to negotia-
tion, and the enemy has used these to his 
consistent advantage and has con-
sistently rejected our overtures of peace. 
Consequently, it seems that the only 
thing we can do under such circum-
stances is to do everything in our power 
to render the aggressor incapable of 
further aggression, to stop his present 
and continuing aggression, and to do all 
we can to demonstrate to him with all 
the force at our command the foolish-
ness, the folly, of trying to get those who 
are firmly determined to stand for 
freedom and for human dignity to bow 
before tyranny and to accept his aggres-
sion without responding with great force 
and with unaltering firmness. Such a 
course seems the most likely way to bring 
the present conflict to an early and 
honorable conclusion. There are times 
when a big stick brought down with vigor 
upon the head of a bully is the most 
effective instrument of peace. 
STRIKING AT THE SOURCE 
I would say this would include step-
ping up the bombing of strategic targets, 
cutting supply lines, cutting the flow of 
North Vietnamese troops into South 
Vietnam in every way possible, increas-
ing sanctions against those who are sup-
plying North Vietnam, and doing any-
thing and everything reasonably pos-
sible to stop the aggression there at its 
Source. 
PACIFICATION AND RECONSTRUCTION 
There is a second task. Even if we 
step up the bombing of strategic targets, 
even if we close the harbors, even if we 
use strong enough sanctions against 
other nations so that they do stop sup-
plying the Vietcong?he receives supplies 
from many places, though Red China is 
the primary source of supply?we must, 
nevertheless, do a second job, which is a 
job of step-by-step pacification and re-
construction in South Vietnam, in the 
Republic of Vietnam. 
It is an oversimplification to feel that 
we can step up our activities against the 
north, against Ho Chi Minh, and that, in 
6 months or a very short period of time, 
by escalating our own conduct of the 
war, we can bring this situation to a suc-
cessful conclusion. The fact is that be-
cause of the long-term aggression of Ho 
Chi Minh and of the Communists in 
Vietnam, this is not enough. The only 
kind of action which can possibly secure 
the land, which can possibly put the 
country into a condition under which 
there can be such a thing as free elec-
tions, such a thing as self-determination, 
is action to release the people from the 
rule of terror and the reign of fear of the 
Vietcong within South Vietnam. 
Our troops, in cooperation with the 
Republic of Vietnam, are conducting a 
step-by-step pacification and reconstruc-
tion program. They are going out to 
clear given areas of the Vietcong, and 
they are moving in to convince the peo-
ple of those areas that we can protect 
them from the one who holds his gun 
to their heads. If elections were held 
all over South Vietnam now, in those 
areas where he has influence and power, 
he would respond with murder to any 
who opposed him. 
We must, as we are doing now, seek 
out the hidden enemy. He is hidden and 
entrenched as a guerrilla. For example, 
tunnels have been found that have been 
as long as 2 miles, and six layers deep. 
Also he dissolves into the populace. Be-
cause people fear him, they do not 
always readily identify him, until they 
are sure we can provide them security 
from his reprisal.

A1176 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX March 3, 1966 
We must, therefore, convince the peo-
ple that this enemy. who dissolves himself 
into the civilian population, and who 
remains unidentified, because of the fear 
the people have of him, is one from whom 
we can and will protect them. 
In the second place, we must convince 
them that we are their friends. Re-
grettably, one of the propaganda instru-
ments the Vietcong have used rather 
electively against the Americans has 
been to compare them to the French, by 
saying, "They are here to rule, to exploit." 
The French soldiers in many instances 
were mercenaries. They were fighting 
for pay and for the loot they could take, 
and their record was not always what 
it should have been. The French rule 
did not accomplish for the people of 
Vietnam what might have been accom-
plished by more humane and enlightened 
Therefore, we must overcome this and 
other forms of propaganda against our 
traops. We must persuade the people 
that we are their friends, that we can 
pi otect them and that we want to help 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, everywhere I went I was 
greatly impressed by the understanding 
of this phase of our mission possessed by 
our troops. They understood they had 
a Jnilitary mission to meet the enemy on 
the field, as regular troops. When this 
has been done they have made a mar-
velous record and have totally defeated 
the enemy. 
They also understand that they have 
to search out the guerrilla forces, which 
Is a step-by-step as well as a dangerous 
and time-consuming occupation, requir-
ing many troops. They are doing this 
and doing it well. 
llut a civic action phase of our mission 
goes hand-in-hand with the military 
program. We are helping to demon-
strate concretely our friendship for the 
people of Vietnam, our desire to help 
rather than to rule them. by helping 
them te construct roads and schools and 
churches. We are helping them to meet 
their medical needs by setting up dis-
pensaries all across the land, and are 
conducting a variety of other programs 
of civic action, all in cooperation with 
the Government of the Republic of Viet-
nam. This is being done in cooperation 
also with our AID people and our private 
civilian agencies, and it is being con-
ducted in many instances by our military 
Personnel. 
Tee aREAT HUMANITARIANS 
Our men are demonstrating once more 
For the world to see that GI Joe is the 
world's greatest humanitarian. Their 
understanding of this part of their mis-
sion and its necessity and the way they 
are performing it is an inspiration to be-
hold. These men understand that they 
must win the friendship of the Viet-
namese people, and they are doing so. It 
is anparent to anyone. 
The fine young officer assigned to es-
cort me was Capt. Bert H. Custer, a West 
Pointer, a fine soldier, a good example 
of the kind of fine professional that we 
have at every level of leadership in Viet-
nam. His easy but firmly disciplined re-
lationship with both senior officers and 
enlisted men was matched by his rapport 
with the people of Vietnam. He has 
been a fine fighting soldier as well as hav-
ing the kind of finesse and patience nec-
essary to serve as a congressional escort. 
On the day of my departure from Viet-
nam, he and I went to visit an orphanage 
in Saigon. This orphanage was one that 
Dr. Tom Dooley had helped begin. 
When .we entered the grounds little Viet-
namese children swarmed around us and 
surrounded us. They lifted their arms 
to us with their faces lighted in smiles. 
In the wisdom of their innocent hearts 
they knew that Americans were the good 
guys. 
Those tough combat soldiers who had 
come into Saigon for an evening and 
taken a. little group of orphan children to 
the zoo and who had hearts as big as all 
outdoors?the children knew them to be 
their friends, and so did the people in the 
villages and the hamlets. 
When people have had sick children for 
many months, and the Americans have 
come in to provide medical care to help 
heal their children, such peoiale under-
stand that we have come in Friendship. 
As they understand they begin to have 
confidence in us and in their Govern-
ment, which Government looks more 
hopeful than any we have seen for some 
time in Vietnam. They are beginning to 
warm up to us and to gain courage to 
identify the hidden enemy in their midst, 
the local Vietcong, so that the Govern-
ment of the Republic of Vietnam can deal 
with these enemies. 
Now, this step-by-step part of suc-
ceeding in our mission will take time and 
will take troops. This will require firm-
ness of purpose; it will require patience 
at home: but unless we do this to free 
and liberate the people of the Republic 
of Vietnam from the power and influence 
of this long-term aggression of the Viet-
cong, and unless we stand firm until we 
do this, we cannot succeed in our mis-
sion in Asia. 
CAN WE WIN IN VIETNAM? 
This brings me to another question; 
namely, Can we succeed? May I say that 
I have never seen anything quite match-
ing the high morale of our troops in 
Vietnam. These men, everywhere I 
went, wounded men, generals and pri-
vates, men in the hottest spots in Viet-
nam, and everywhere in that area, uni-
versally reflected high dedication match-
ed by understanding of and an unshak-
able faith in the rightness of their mis-
sion. They also demonstrated the con-
fidence and conviction that they were 
going to succeed in their assignment in 
Vietnam. Their morale was as high as 
I have seen anywhere. 
LEADERSHIP 
We shall succeed in Vietnam because 
these men who would match any soldiers 
that this country has ever fielded in any 
of its wars, and we will succeed in this 
mission because we have great military 
leadership. The men who are leading 
the combat there in this supporting role 
of ours read like a roll of honor. First 
among them, of course, is Gen. Wil-
liam Westmoreland, who is a gifted mili-
tary general and who has also a gift for 
understanding the delicate political and 
diplomatic phases cif his mission. He re-
spects his supporting role in the Repub-
lic of Vietnam and remains in that role, 
but he manages to lead magnificently 
from that position. 
I found confidence, unshakable con-
fidence, in General Westrnorehett on the 
part of every man under his command as 
well as on the part of the Vietnamese 
everywhere. This man has done nothing 
less than a magnificent job of leadership, 
and we owe him a debt of great gratitude. 
Such was also the case with each of his 
field commanders. 
Gen. Jonathan 0. Seeman, who is com-
manding officer of the 1st Infantry Divi-
sion, with which I spent much of my 
time, is the finest kind of military leader. 
High quality marks the leadership of the 
1st Cavalry, the Air Force, the Navy. 
Nor could any military force boast great-
er leadership than that of General Walt 
with whom some of us were privileged to 
meet this day. The Marines under his 
command are living up to the highest 
traditions of their corps. Everywhere 
one goes in Vietnam, one is impressed 
with the high caliber of both of beers and 
men. 
General Westmoreland gives to every 
man who becomes a part of the U.S. 
Armed Forces in Vietnam. nine rules for 
personnel to follow. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
to include them in the RECORD at this 
point. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
KREBS). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Alabama? 
There was no objection. 
The matter referred to follows: 
NINE RULES FOR PERSONNEL OF U.S. MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE COMMAND, VIETNAM 
The Vietnamese have paid a heavy price 
in suffering for their long fight against the 
Communists. We military men are in Viet-
nam 'now because their Government has 
asked us to help its soldiers and people in 
winning their struggle. The Vielcong will 
attempt to turn the Vietname:;e people 
against you. You can defeat theni at every 
turn by the strength, understanding, and 
generosity you display with the people. Here 
are nine simple rules: 
1. Remember we are guests here: We make 
no demands and seek no special treatment. 
2. Join with the people. Understand their 
life, use phrases from their language and 
honor their customs and laws. 
3. Treat women with politeness and re-
spect. 
4. Make personal friends among the sol-
diers and common people. 
5. Always give the Vietnamese the right-
of-way. 
6. Be alert to security and ready to react 
with your military skill. 
7. Don't attract attention by loud, rude 
or unusual behavior. 
8. Avoid separating yourself from the peo-
ple by a display of wealth or privilege. 
9. Above all else you are members of the 
"U.S. Military Forces on a difficult mission, 
responsible for all your official and personal 
actions. Reflect honor upon yourself and 
the United States of America. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, these 
rules are abided by, and our men are 
following them and following them well. 
MOBILITY AND FIREPOWER 
We shall win because we have superior 
mobility and firepower. This is being 
used with increasing effectiveness to rout 
the Vietcong. There has never been 
more extensive use of air transportation

and air support, from helicopters to 
bombers and from light reconnaissance 
to heavy transport. Helicopters are used 
with great flexibility and effectiveness?
transporting troops and supplies, rescu-
ing doe-ritd aviators and wounded men, 
and flying Combat missions. Armed heli-
copters are proving of great value in this 
operation. Artillery is being widely and 
effectively used against Vietcong strong-
holds. 
Ground-air support and bombing mis-
sions by Air Force, Marine, and Navy 
jets are having a cumulative effect both 
in casualties and in their demoralizing 
effect upon the Vietcong. As our intelli-
gence improves, these become increas-
ingly effective. Skill and science, men 
and morale, mobility and firepower are 
being blended into a devastating combi-
nation which is playing havoc with the 
enemy. 
MEDICAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT 
Mr. Speaker, the medical work we are 
doing outstrips anything we have ever 
done. We have stationary hospitals 
which are in a central location. Since 
the conflict is everywhere, and there are 
not fixed battlelines, as in previous wars, 
rather than having field hospitals which 
normally follow the troops, helicopters 
bring into this central location men who 
have been wounded in battle. A doctor 
there at one of the hospitals told me that 
often within 30 minutes of the time a 
man was wounded he had him in sur-
gery at that particular hospital. We 
are losing almost no men who get to 
the hospital and who have been wounded. 
The ratio is extremely low. This work 
has been outstanding. 
We shall win because the men who are 
there have had excellent training. They 
are marvelously trained. They are 
highly motivated. They understand 
their mission. They ,have excellent 
medical care. And they are well sup-
plied. In spite of the engineering and 
logistical miracle required to move 150,-
000 troops into this little country with 
no real port facilities, few roads, none of 
them safe, and limited railway, persist-
ently interdicted by the Vietcong, and 
then sustain those troops and support the 
military actions of a highly mobile army, 
this has been done. We are developing 
the port facilities. We are moving the 
supplies. I found no present shortages 
anywhere I went, and I went almost 
everywhere. 
ROTATION POLICY 
Mr. Speaker, another thing that means 
a great deal to them is this: We have a 
policy of rotating each man after 1 year. 
While morale is of the highest, every man 
there can tell you to the minute how 
much time he has left on his tour and 
on his mission. This is a system worth 
maintaining. 
A STABLE GOVERNMENT 
Then, Mr. Speaker, we have the en-
couraging South Vietnamese progress. 
This government is taking seriously the 
need for reconstruction in order to meet 
the needs of the people and is determined 
to lead the way to abetter life for them. 
This government is determined to suc-
cessfully complete its military operation. 
It is committed to free elections as soon 
as security is established. And it shows 
signs of strength and stability that are 
greatly encouraging to see. 
Mr. Speaker, we have ano,ther encour-
aging factor, and that is the participa-
tion of the forces of the Republic of Ko-
rea. It was my privilege to visit the Tiger 
Division and to see with my own eyes as 
fine a group of fighting men as I have 
seen anywhere. These men are the re-
flection of our earlier investment and 
continuing investment in this part of 
southeast Asia. 
It was with particular interest that 
I visited with this Republic of Korea di-
vision and saw its outstanding work, be-
cause the blood of my own family was 
shed in Korea, for the people of south-
east Asia. Their devotion to freedom is 
an inspiration to behold. 
Mr. Speaker, this represents another 
indication of the fact that what we are 
doing is right, and that indeed we can 
succeed. I believe we shall succeed, not 
only because of our superior mobility and 
firepower and magnificent leadership, 
not only because of the high morale and 
courage on the part of our troops doing 
an outstanding job, not only because of 
the new hope on the part of the South 
Vietnamese Government, and the other 
hopes that we see reflected in Korea and 
in its people there, but I believe that we 
shall win because in the last analysis, as 
Abraham Lincoln said, "Right makes 
might." 
RIGHT MAKES MIGHT 
We are on the side of truth and jus-
tice in Vietnam. The Communists mur-
der and steal and dismember and de-
stroy. We heal, and we help. They tax 
away the people's rice. We take it away 
from the Vietcong, and give it back to 
the people. They tear down. We build 
up. They terrorize. We make secure. 
They enslave. We set free. There may 
be those in the other body of this Con-
gress, and there may be those elsewhere, 
who will question the rightness of what 
we are 'doing in southeast Asia. But 
there is no question on the part of our 
military forces there. We are fighting 
a battle to liberate a people from a tyr-
anny and from poverty and sickness. We 
are fighting a battle to bring new hope 
to the millions of Asians. We are fight-
ing the eternal battle for human free-
dom. This is perhaps the most crucial 
battle of all in the modern history of 
Asia. This can be the turning point, in-
troducing a new era of hope, of freedom, 
of self-determination, of individual lib-
erty and human dignity for the people 
of southeast Asia, or it can be the begin-
ning of the darkest night that Asia has 
ever seen. 
Mr. Speaker, there is much at stake in 
Vietnam. We have invested much, be-
cause we have invested there our young 
men. But we must not swerve in our 
purpose. We must recognize the neces-
sity of victory for freedom and the dan-
ger of settling for anything less. Our 
President must stand firm, and we must 
stand firmly behind him. 
THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
Mr. Speaker, on the day on which I 
left Saigon I had the privilege of visit-
ing with Mr. Mann of our AID program. 
He made a suggestion which I am glad 
to pass on to my colleagues. There are 
some 43 provinces in Vietnam, each 
roughly equivalent to a State. He recom-
mended that it might be a good idea if 
each State in these United States 
adopted a Province. I had told him about 
my city's adoption of the 1st Infantry 
Division, relating that since the men's 
needs were met, other than the need for 
the knowledge of our support, we had 
agreed that what we could do best was 
to work together on civic action pro-
grams to help the Vietnamese people of 
the area of operation of the 1st Infantry 
in Vietnam. 
So we are doing so in a number of 
concrete ways. I told him about it and 
he said that he would like to see each 
State of our Union adopt a Province 
in South Vietnam. There is such tre-
mendous popular support for what we 
are doing in southeast Asia. 
There is a great desire on the part of 
millions of Americans to demonstrate 
how much they stand behind our troops, 
and how much they believe in this battle 
for human freedom. Here is a concrete 
way to demonstrate that support and to 
turn it into a constructive channel that 
can help `us fulfill our mission and suc-
ceed therein. 
NO TURNING BACK 
There can be no turning back in 
southeast Asia. The battle call is sound-
ed. The troops are in the field and 
human freedom and human dignity and 
all the things that all the years of Amer-
ican history stand for are at stake. If we 
fail in our mission, we shall not only 
fail the people of Vietnam but the people 
of southeast Asia and not only the people 
of southeast Asia but the hope for free-
dom for the people of all the world in 
our time. If we fail, we shall have be-
trayed our own heritage and our OWR 
future. 
If we become weak and if we do not 
stand firm, we shall betray everything 
that America has stood for in all its 
shining years. In our weakness and in 
our failure, we shall become traitors to 
our own destiny, and the Judas Iscariots 
of a civilization. 
We have no choice in southeast Asia 
but the choice that was made by the 
men of the Continental Army and by 
Americans in each succeeding genera-
tion: That we will pay whatever price 
is necessary that freedom might live in 
our time.

Old Myth and New Reality 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
110N. ROBERT H. MICHEL 
OF U.I.INOIS 
IN THE :HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
'1'/Dirsda2J, Al arch 3, 1966 
Mr.. MICHEL Mr. Speaker, under 
unanimous consent. I wish to include the 
following editorial from the March 1, 
1966, issue of the Peoria Journal Star: 
SENATOR EDT. ERIGHT : "OLD MYTH AND NEW 
REALTT 
'rWO years ago Senator FUT, BRIGHT wrote a 
hook called "Old Myths and New. Reali-
ct's look at some of the things be set 
down then, coolly and soberly. 
"It is diffieult to see how a negotiation. 
under present military circumstances, could 
lead to the termination of the war under 
conditions that would preserve the free-
dom of South Vietnam. It is extremely dif-
ficult for a party to a negotiation to achieve 
by diplomacy objectives which it has con-
epteuously failed to win by warfare. The 
laid fact of the matter is that our bar-
gaining positron is at present a weak one, 
and until the equation of advantages has 
been substantially altered in our favor, there 
can be little prospect for a negotiated set-
tlement. 
eft seems clear that there are only two 
realistic options open to us in Vietnam in 
the immediate future: the expansion of the 
epellict in one way or another, or a renewed 
effort to bolster the capacity of the South 
Vietnamese to prosecute the war success-
fully on its present scale. The matter calls 
for continuing examination by responsible 
officials in the executive branch of our Gov-
ernment. 
erntil and unless they conclude that the 
military situation in South Vietnam, and the 
politierl situation in southeast Asia, war-
rant the expansion of the war, or that the 
overall situation has changed sufficiently to 
establish some basis for a successful nego-
tiation, it seems to me that we have no 
choice hot to support the South Vietnam-
ese Government and Army by the most ef-
fective means available." 
In the same book, he suggests that carry-
ing the war to North Vietnam might be nec-
essary- order to bring them t f the confer-
ence table. 
This is the same Fcji,BRICHT who now pub-
licly "wonders" how we got into this situa-
tion? Who throws up his bards at what 
the President has &me as if it were carried 
out mysteriously and secretly behind his 
back? And, above all, as if he never, never 
consented to such action? 
Is it the same Senator EULBRI G HT who had 
earned a considerable reputation for re-
sponsibility in his long years in the Senate, 
and who wrote those words just 2 years ago?
is this the same man who turns over his 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the 
Senate's long-recognized prize eccentric, 
WAYNE MORSE, for the kind of diatribes 
against the United States and its Govern-
ment that have characterized him for a 
dozen years? 
Is the; the same man who eow permits 
his committee to be a platform to make a 
loner, the "black sheep" of the Serrate ap-
pear. falsely, before the American people to 
be the voice of the U.S. Senate? 
Some dring has happened to Senator 
EMBRIG ED. 
Skuneihrng sad. 
A od :.,(yrictiling dangerous too, because the 
new, steerage EULERIGEI T carries over some-
thing or lie shred of reputation, at least, 
earned by a different kind of me if?the man 
lie was before. 
How else to explain that a man who ex-
plained 2 years ago that we cannot negotiate 
from weakness, is now engaged i.n making 
our position to achieve negotiations

OF 
HON. ELFORD A. CEDERBERG 
OF NM Ei IRAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF HEPRESEN tATIVES 
TimeSdati, March 3, 1966 
Mr. CEDERBERG. Mr. Speaker, many 
Members of Congress and many veteran 
staff members will recall plea,ant asso-
ciations with Francis J. P. Cleary, who 
headed what later became the Congres-
sional Inquiry Unit of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture and who retired 
in 1946. 
I have been asked to advise Mr. Cleary's 
friends that he passed away at the Susan 
B. Miller Nursing Hone in Woodstock, 
Va., last Monday at the age of 90. Fu-
neral services for him were conducted 
this morning. 
I am told by a member of my staff who 
knew him intimately that Mr. Cleary had 
a Horatio Alger type of rise to promi-
nence in the career ranks of the Govern-
ment. I understand he started his Gov-
ernment service as a Messenger at the age 
of 16 and in 54 years rose to a key posi-
tion through which many congressional 
offices successfully channeled their in-
quiries and problems involving the De-
partment of Agriculture. 
Mr. Cleary was born in Nenagh, Tip-
perary, Ireland, on March 2, 1876, and 
was brought to the United States as an 
infant by his parents, Dr. Frank P. 
Cleary, U.S. Army, and Nora Egan 
Cleary. His earliest years were spent in 
Illinois, and the family moved to Wash-
ington, D.C., in 1881. Mr. Cleary at-
tended public and parochial schools in 
Washington and was graduated from the 
School of Law of Georgetown University. 
At the age of 16, Mr. Cleary entered 
Government service as a messenger in 
the Department of Agriculture. He 
served for 54 years in the Department, 
retiring in 1946 at the age of 70. He rose 
through the ranks as a career employee 
and was an administrative assistant to 
the Director of Information when he re-
tired. For many years he was the em-
ployee-elected member of the Personnel 
Appeals Board of the Department of 
Agriculture. 
Mr. Cleary's late wife was Frances Ann 
Whalley, sister of Mrs. F. Wilson Gearing 
of Woodstock, Va. Mrs. Cleary died in 
1950, and since 1951 Mr. Cleary had re-
sided in Woodstock. 
An active participant in sports in his 
youth, Mr. Cleary was an avid sports 
fan. During his long career in Washing-
ton he also was active in amateur theatri-
cals and in the Knights of Columbus. 
Mr. Cleary is survived by his brother-
in-law and sister-in-law, Dr. and Mrs. F. 
Wilson Gearing of Woodstock, Va., and 
by three nephews and two nieces, Dr. 
F. W. Gearing, Jr., of Harrisonburg, Va., 
and John K. Gearing, W. John White, 
Mrs. Clarence R. Gorman and Mrs. R. 
Earl Harron of the Washington area. 
In behalf of a number of veteran staff 
members on Capitol Hill who were ac-
quainted with Mr. Cleary, I want to ex-
tend condolences to the family.

Neither Withdrawal Nor Escalation Is the 
Answer 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 17, 1966 
Mr. MOORHEAD. Mr. Speaker, it is 
obvious that neither withdrawal nor mas-
sive escalation is the answer to our 
dilemma in Vietnam. The Pittsburgh 
Press, in a recent editorial, said that the 
American people must exercise great 
patience in dealing with this crisis. 
The danger?
As the Press editorialist points out--
is that for lack of obvious battlefield victories, 
will either pull back and prove to the world 
our anti-Communist role is too big for us?
or will expand the conflict at vast, unneces-
sary cost in lives and money. 
Under leave to extend my remarks I 
include the entire editorial, entitled "A 
New Kind of War," as published in the 
Pittsburgh Press February 13, 1966, in 
the RECORD at this point: 
A NEW KIND OF WAR 
Confusion and divided counsels on Viet-
nam largely result from a lag in imagina-
tion?the tendency always to fight the new 
war in terms of the last. 
A bookful of examples might be offered 
to illustrate this stubborn habit. British 
military brass scorned the tank in the First 
World War. American military authority 
practically had to have the airplane shoved 
down its throat. 
Even as late as World War II the Poles 
sent cavalry against Hitler's tanks. De 
Gaulle senesd the futility of the maginot 
line but couldn't get French authority to 
listen, 
The French used World War II tactics in 
Vietnam and were beaten by much smaller 
native forces, mainly armed with captured 
guns. The American military has had to 
learn the hard way how to fight a guerrilla 
war which is kept in bounds by common fear 
of nuclear weapons. 
To the fixed idea as to how a war should 
be fought, Vietnam is bound to be frustrat-
ing. War should involve front lines which 
are attacked or defended, with progress com-
puted in terms of slain enemies or gained 
real estate. 
So far as the Vietnam phase of the present 
war is concerned, this is an outmoded con-
cept. The big victories are gained maybe 
thousands of miles from battles which in-
volve only a relatively few men. 
This is too little comprehended by critics 
of U.S. policy?either those who think we 
can't win in Vietnam and should get but 
or those who appear to think we can. clean 
this one up promptly if we just throw enough 
bombs. 
True, in terms of the two prior world con-
flicts, this is a "no win" war. But, granting 
that Red China is our principal, immediate 
enemy in Vietnam, cast up the scores: 
The Communist effort to take over Indo-
nesia has collapsed in armed revolt which 
essentially has destroyed the Indonesian 
Communist apparatus. Does anyone hon-
estly believe the Indonesian conservatives 
would have dared challenge the Communists 
with the United States either losing or with-
drawing from Vietnam? 
As result of Communist defeat in Indo-
nesia the Indonesian assault on Malaysia has 
faded from view. Only a short time back 
this looked like big trouble. 
A truce has been called in the menacing 
war between India and Pakistan. The Red 
Chinese invasion of India has not been re-
newed. 
These are the "front lines" in the type of 
war we are fighting. Our weapons include 
food as well as guns. Our allies are the 
Indonesian patriots, the economists strug-
gling with inflation in Brazil, the statesmen 
counseling faith in Africa. 
In each of a hundred nations there are 
varying sets of political opinion as to which 
way to jump in order to get on the winning 
side in this struggle between America and 
the Communist powers. 
This is cooly calculated. Only the strong 
can afford to stand up for principle. The 
weak must concentrate on saving their own 
hides and making the best possible deal with 
whichever of the big fellows comes out on 
top. 
These people now watch Vietnam for evi-
dence that the United States has either 
the will or the weight to fulfill it avowed 
commitment, which is containment of com-
munism. The generally favorable trend of 
affairs in southeast Asia, indeed the gen-
erally favorable trend around the world?in 
Africa, Latin America, Western Europe?evi-
dence world opinion as to who is winning 
the war in Vietnam. 
It is a war requiring vast patience on the 
part of the American people because the local 
results are not immediately obvious and 
because it is difficult to associate cause and 
effect in events far from Vietnam. 
The danger is that, for lack of obvious 
battlefield victories, we will either pull back 
and prove to the world our anti-Communist 
role is too big for us?or will expand the 
conflict at vast, unnecessary cost in lives and 
money. 
Much depends on understanding of this 
if America is to be the eventual victor in 
this oddly fought third world war and avoid 
world-destroying nuclear conflict. 
Albert Thomas 
SPEECH 
or 
HON. L. MENDEL RIVERS 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 1966 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, once again we pause to note 
the passing of a beloved colleague. Too 
often the stalwarts of the Congress, who 
have written so much of the history of 
their times, are suddenly gone from the 
scene. In awe of God's inscrutable ways 
we meet today to register our sincere 
thoughts of ALBERT THOMAS, what he 
meant and how we will miss him. 
To know ALBERT was to love and re-
spect him. During the years he so ably 
served the Eighth Congressional District 
of Texas, I learned to appreciate what a 
fine, outstanding job he did in carrying 
out his responsibilities to his people. 
Loved and respected for his fairness, 
A1145 
sound judgment, deep courage and devo-
tion to America, his rare capacity for 
leadership will be sorely missed in the 
years to come. 
He was quiet and soft spoken, and as he 
went about his daily tasks, he had a kind 
greeting for everyone. 
In thinking of ALBERT, I am reminded 
of the words penned by the late Sir Wil-
liam Osier, the noted Canadian phy-
sician: 
I have three personal ideals. One, to do 
the day's work well and not to bother about 
tomorrow. The second ideal has been to act 
the Golden Rule, as far as In me lay, toward 
my professional brethren and toward those 
committed to my care, And the third has 
been to cultivate such a measure of 
equanimity as would enable me to bear suc-
cess with humility, the affection of my 
friends without pride, and to be ready when 
the day of sorrow and grief came to meet it 
with the courage befitting a man. 
ALBERT THOMAS fully measured up to 
Such ideals. We shall miss him, but he 
has left forever with us countless mem-
ories of a wonderful person. 
Some Commonsense Words About Our 
Supplementing World Food Supplies 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. HOWARD W. ROBI SON 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 1966 
Mr. ROBISON. Mr, Speaker, at a 
meeting in Albany, N.Y., held recently 
for northeastern dairy co-op leaders, 
Lester Martin, president of the 15,000-
member Dairymen's League Cooperative 
Association, spoke some words of uncom-
mon commonsense about the role of the 
American farmer in any new programs 
to supplement world food supplies. 
As we prepare to consider the alter-
natives available to us in this connection, 
it would be well for us to pay heed to 
Mr. Martin's ideas, and, under my leave 
to include extraneous material, granted 
to me on February 8, 1966, his speech is 
now set forth: 
STATEMENT BY DAIRYMEN'S LEAGUE PRESIDENT 
TO THE LEAGUE'S AFFILIATE BOARD OF DI-
RECTORS, FEBRUARY 23, 1906 
Much has been written and spoken in re-
cent months about the great population ex-
plosion in the world and the virtual in-
evitability of a widespread food shortage 
In some of our most populous countries. 
The U.S. Government, both in Congress 
and in the executive branch, has expressed 
concern over this critical situation and rec-
ommendations have been made at both 
levels for action to expand American food 
production to meet the emergency. 
As a farmer and as an elected head of 
a major farm organization, I am ready, 
willing, and eager to,see the untapped pro-
ductivity of this Nation mobilized to aid 
everyone, at home or abroad, who faces a 
shortage of food. No one should go hungry 
if food can be made available to feed him. 
At the risk, however, of being called self-
ish, I must urge all farmers, whether milk 
or grain producers, to stop, look, and listen 
before plunging headlong into expensive in-
vestments in more production facilities.

Whether the motive is a desire to cash in 
or the expected bonanza of foreign aid, or a 
desire to respond to the world need for more 
food or a combination of both- -let us not 
create a situation in which we Can rapidly 
ru,d ourselves once more the victims of our 
own efficiency_ 
gor some 20 years the milk and grain pro-
ducers of this country have been criticized, 
ridiculed, and generally ill-used by the press, 
politicians, and the public because of the 
na-
il al commodity price support program. In 
;v1 ition, -farmers have been. .an (idled with the 
economic distress that has necompanied an 
inihelonced supply-demand situation. 
Meet of this criticism was unjustified. 
The food sorptuses that arose after World 
Wi:r it were an outgrowth of the war and 
the postwar needs of the world. They were 
edoocated and encouraged by our Govern-
ment to meet an -urgent need. It was un-
realistic to expect them to simply disappear 
when the need declined. The Federal price 
impport, program was used to prevent eco-
nomic disaster to the industry that virtually 
kept a large (tart of the world alive during 
iLa darkest emirs. It SOON 110Wever, bechime 
as political chopping block and an easy source 
of headlines. The farmer's role in. feeding

history's gree test provider, the American 
humor, was that of a greedy hick with one

neck of the isinsumer. 
I we, as Meiners, let that happen again 
we deserve to wear the biggest and brightest 
deuce cap history can devise. At long last, 
consumption and production in tilis country 
are beginning to attain a reasonable balance. 
:thriee.s to food producers have improved and 
will likely continue to do so if we exercise 
reationahte restraint in our expansion pro-

American efforts to curb world hunger 
through a food-for-peace program.. His pro-

Tte American farmer does not need to ex-
taint his Tina-loci-ion facilithis beyond the. 
normal pace that can meet expected growth 
in commercial demand.. To exceed this rate

to be cautious. A farmer who Ii ;s spent 20

Let us lieve legislation thet W1 I provide a

a provision is not necessary because the in-

I soy the provision will never hove to be 
UI ed- so why object to it? 
Smarter men than I will have to figure out 
the details and language of the legislation I 
am propoeing, but without such tssurances 
I strongly urge all farmers to view any tem-
porary inducements for rapid expansion of 
production with suspicion, and ti act with 
extreme rim tion. A sudden bonanga for the 
maehinery, inanufacturers. the 1; inks, the 
feed dealess and land speculators, could well

IN THE lICUSE OF REPRESENTe'FIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 1966 
Mr. BURKE. Mr. U,pcaker, it was my 
great priv..leg,e to addres the A,?nerican 
Lithuanian Council of Boston, Mass., on 
Sunday, February 20, 1.966. The cere-
monies were held to co.almemoi ate the 
48th annil ersary of the independence of 
Lithuania, now only a bright memory in 
the heavy hearts of all Lithuanians. 
I insert here my remarks on that oc-
casion, as well as those of the Honor-
able Elliot L. Richardson, Liei aenant 
Governor of Massachusetts, who was in 
attendance representing the Holorable 
John A. Volpe, Governor. I include, too, 
a list of th prMcipal officers and guests 
who were present, and a, copy of the res-
olutions adopted by the council .1.t that 
meeting: 
REMARKS OF CONGRESSMAN JANIFI, A. BURKE 
More as a friend and neighbor of my fellow 
American-Lithuanians, than as a U.S. Repre-
sentative in the Congress, I consider it a par-
ticular privilege to take part in this program 
commemorating the 48th anniveriary of the 
declaration of Lithuania's independence. 
Tins annual ceremony is dear to the hearts 
of all Lithuanians and their American friends 
because it is held to recollect Um dale of 
February 16, 1918, which marked the end of 
well over a century of suffering under a hos-
tile, foreign rule. Back on that joyful 
Lithuania stood forth as an independent 
democratic republic. There WaS cause for 
celebration then and the future was feced 
with confidence. 'Your hoineland people 
were happy and prosperous in their own sov-
ereignty. 
Unfortunately, in this year of 12,36 our oh-
servance hero must be shaded with sorrow. 
The bright star of Lithuania's .freedom hes 
been clouded over by the violent storms of 
tyranny. We gaze with sacInes,s upon the 
continuing tragedy of sacrifice to ruthless 
imperialism that has enveloped Lithuania; 
she has ceased to be cm independent nation. 
The brutal tyranny now being forced upon 
Lithuania, and the other small nate :am or as 
continuing challenge to the moral conscience 
of our Nation and the United Nations to 
reestablish tha great, basic principles of free-
dom and liberty for all peoples. In simple 
justice, our Government must perseveringly 
insist that the Lithuanian people be per-
mitted their inalienable right to govern their 
internal existence as they themselves see fig 
'The major world powers, including the 
United States should not remain acqiiiescent 
parties to the disgraceful betrayel of the 
smaller nations like Lithuania?winch be-
trayal defies every decent concept of sell 
-
determination and democracy. 
On this occasion dedicated to the memory 
and future objective of Lithuanian inde-
pendence, I again say that the United states 
and the United Nations must 101 (ClSl fll y 
call upon Russia to give up her occupation 
and control over Lithuania and Lie other 
Baltic Nations, 
The Soviet Union has repeatedly violated 
the political pledge made at 'Teheran, Yal 
and Potsdam. Unless restitution is made, 
the United States should not be liel-d bowel 
by such unratified agreements. We must 
continue to use our moral leadership in the 
United Nations In demand that the sup-
pressed rights of Lithuania and other so n-
jugated nations to govern themselves be re-
stored. 
Although we mourn over her cresont 
plight, there is no cause for despair. Re-
peatedly, through her history, Lithuania hae 
proved that her people can eventually over-
come the temporary triumphs of oppreesors. 
The Christian faith, which in 1399, defeattsi 
the Tartar invasion and saved all Europe 
from barbarism, is still with her tieley. It. 
gives her the spiritual vigor to outlive reiy 
dictatorship. From my own knowledge and 
experience with my fellow Americans ot Lith-
uanian descent, I know that deep to the 
heart of every Lithuanian is that pit:h.:ion for 
liberty and freedom which never dies. 'There 
is no power that can forever enslave people 
who are determined to be free. 
As the keynote of this ceremony, may 
suggest that we rededicate ourselves in the 
determination to perseveringly rev eel mat 
present to the Christian world the fitets and 
the truth about the persecution of Lithos/1M, 
so that the United Nations and the United 
States will be inspired to accept the foil 
moral and humanitarian responsibilit; of re-
storing Lithuanian independence. 
In this rededication, I am sure ycitu will 
have the complete support of all Chre'dian, 
freedom-loving people throughout the world. 
I am confident you can rely upon theni to 
Jolla in your efforts and prayers that yom 
homeland may once again be free. May God

THE NEW GLOBAL DUTIES OF THE VICE 
PRESIDENT 
(By David Lawrence) 
Charles Martel deal with the Moors by tak-
ing the field at Tours with an offer of a few 
fat bucks if they'd just retire beyond the 
Pyrenees. 
Mr. Johnson must be succumbing to the 
infection of the appeasement wing in his own 
party?the BOBBY KENNEDYS who would wel-
come the Vietcong into the Saigon Govern-
ment, the FULBRIGHTS who are forever carp-
ing about a policy that requires standing up 
to the Communists at all, the MOSSES who 
contend it would be no weakness if we 
bugged out. 
Senator FULBRIGHT'S Foreign Relations 
Committee recently heard a pointed warning 
from Gen. Maxwell Taylor that the leaders 
of North Vietnam still hoped "for some kind 
of victory in the south," apparently because 
they were convinced that the United States 
be detached from support of South Vietnam. 
The stream of criticism against the war which 
comes from Democrats in Congress is one 
reason for this Communist conviction. 
"They have not," the general said in ref-
erence to the Communists, "forgotten that 
the Vietminh won more in Paris than in 
Dienbienphu and believe that the Vietcong 
may be as fortunate in Washington." Dien-
bienphu was a climactic French defeat in 
1954, but the French at home had lost 
stomach for the war after 7 years, just as 
they later lost heart in Algeria, where French 
arms had succeeded in checkmating the 
guerrillas. 
Our recent history amply demonstrates 
that wars can be more readily lost in Wash-
ington or at the conference table than in 
the field. Franklin Roosevelt threw away 
the fruits of military victory at Tehran and 
Yalta. Our allies, notably the British under 
the Socialist Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, 
became terrified lest the United States de-
feat the Communists in Korea. General 
MacArthur was handcuffed by Washington, 
and the victory that was possible was sacri-
ficed in favor of an ignominious stalemate, 
equivalent to the first military defeat in 
this country's history. 
It is all in process of happening again. 
The Communists know what rides on the 
stakes, for the North Vietnamese commander 
in chief, General Clap, has said, "If the spe-
cial warfare that the U.S. imperialists are 
testing in South Vietnam is overcome, then 
it can be defeated anywhere in the world." 
South Vietnam is the acid test whether 
Communist wars of national liberation are to 
sweep the world. 
"Despoilers of Democracy"

Mr. RUMSFELD. Mr. Speaker, a 
highly respected Washington newsman 
and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, Mr. 
Clark R. Mollenhoff of the Cowles Pub-
lications, has authored a book entitled 
"Despoilers of Democracy." 
In this straightforward writing, Mr. 
Mollenhoff has described, detail by de-

the part of some Government officials.

HON. WILLIAM L. ST. ONCE 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March I, 1966 
"DESPOILERS OF DEMOCRACY," CLARIC R. 
MOLLENHOFF (DOTJBLEDAY) 
In his unsuccessful 1964 campaign Senator 
Goldwater attempted to focus attention on 
the topic of corruption in Government and 
the need for the revitalization of the Ameri-
can Governmental processes. Clark Mollen-
hoff, a perennial critic of the political scene, 
in his heavily documented and incisive anal-
ysis, considers the background and intricate 
interaction between the problem of distorted 
democratic government and the breakdown of 
the independence of the several segments of 
our Government. The traditional balance of 
the divisions of our Government has lent 
stability in minimizing the problem of cor-
ruption in Government. Mollenhoff ex-
amines as principal figures in this breakdown 
the situations of such individuals as Bobby 
Baker, Billy Sol Estes, and in a different vein, 
Otto Otepka. 
The use of Federal power for its own end 
is illustrated by the experiences of Don Reyn-
olds who testified against Bobby Baker 
before the Senate Rules Committee. Rey-
nolds, himself a controversial figure, was 
allegedly harassed by the Government to an 
almost unbelievable extent. Mollenhoff 
writes, "He [Reynolds] revealed that he had 
been questioned many times by the FBI, by 
tax agents, and by the Senate Rules Com-
mittee staff, and that the pattern of ques-
tioning made it appear he was the target of 
major emphasis, not Bobby Baker or others." 
Clearly this is a misuse of Federal power and 
an area of concern for those dedicated to 
the preservation and advancement of civil 
liberty for all our people regardless of their 
individual philosophy as Mollenhoff so com-
pellingly discloses. 
The author presents specific proposals to 
eliminate and cut down the threat of cor-
ruption to democracy and erosion of basic 
liberties. His strong arguments emphasize 
the decline in the independence Of Congress 
in the context of American democracy in the 
1960's and the companion decline in the inde-
pendence of the American press under the 
influences of the Federal Government and the 
competition of centrally controlled media. 
To him the only way this Government decay 
can be effectively halted is if the people sense 
the problem, grasp its importance, and "dem-
onstrate that the people are the masters." 
The public must become aware of the dangers 
of massive presidential Rolitical power and 
the effects on the governmental machinery 
of enormous Government contracts and Fed-
eral handouts. For Mollenhoff "in the end 
the responsibility for good Government rests 
with the people. America will get as good a 
government as Americans demand." Of 
course, as is so often the case in such writing. 
Mr. Mollenhoff fails to explain just how the 
people will become so aware and GO aroused 
given the situation he describes. One obvious 
way would be to read his book. 
Wasuurcrox.?Originally, the chief func-
tion of a Vice President of the United 
States was to preside over the Senate. Now-
adays, however, he plays a far more impor-
tant role as an unofficial member of the ex-
ecutive branch of the Government. This 
practice arose only in recent years, when 
America began to participate actively in 
world affairs and the help of allies in meet-
ing emergencies became essential. 
Vice President HUMPHREY, who returned 
last week from a 43,000-mile journey to Asia, 
can do more during brief visits to the vari-
ous capitals of the world to publicize Ameri-
can policies than sometimes can be accom-
plished in longer periods of time by the am-
bassadors or ministers accredited to those 
countries. This is because diplomatic rep-
resentatives must be supercautious in what 
they say, as they have to stay at their posts 
the year around. But a Vice President, as 
the No. 2 man in the U.S. Government, can 
make speeches of a positive nature, and they 
will be widely printed. 
Public relations has become a significant 
factor in the evolution of international pol-
icy. Many Americans do not realize that, al-
though a speech by the President may be 
broadcast over television and radio and be 
given considerable space in the newspapers 
within the United States, it may get only a 
brief mention abroad?even in countries 
friendly to the United States. The reason is 
that what happens locally or in neighboring 
areas takes up most of the space in the news 
media. 
When an emissary as prominent as the 
Vice President of the United States, how-
ever, visits a foreign country, it becomes a 
local story of magnitude. Crowds assemble 
to hear him speak, and the newspapers give 
front-page treatment to the event. Many an 
issue that has been repeatedly explained at 
home by the President is clarified for the 
first time in other lands when it is given 
publicity on the occasion of a Vice-Presi-
dential visit. 
It is, therefore, sensible tactics for the 
Vice President to go around the world mak-
ing speeches, especially during critical times 
when the Communist propaganda machine

and ministers tell us there is a driving force

drive, it has initiative, it has power. There 
is a stirring unrest within the very heart and

unrest. I cannot deny it because I per-
:: many know it exists. 
What can teenagers do to constructively

laens proclaiming everything from religious 
Minna to obscene words. "A government 
in which the supreme power is in the hands 
in' the people who exercise it, either directly. 
er through their chosen representatives." 
Action and restraint The substitution of 
conscience for emotion and in 
laought for irrational thought. American 
ft' singers do possess the right to sit down.

also possess the Moral obligation to their

A :arcing democracy is built upon intent-

IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2. 1966 
iVir. HANSEN of Idaho. Mr. Speaker, 
Idaho has contributed many men of ex-
tremely high caliber to important posi-
tions in the Federal Government,. One 
such man is Commissioner Abe McGregor 
con' of the Interstate Commerce Com-
ill isssorl. 
finder leave to extend my remarks and 
to include extraneous material, I sub-
mit for the RECORD an essay on this dedi-
c:ited public servant, by Dwight Win. 
.iimsen. writing in the Idaho Observer of 
February 24, 1966, and published in Boise, 
Idaho: 
AN IDAHO HAND A'r THE THROTTLE 
(Hy Dwight William Jensen) 
:Vor 24 years, ending in 1954, a man from 
Voscow, Idaho, named Bill Lee served on the 
interstate Commerce Commission. When 
Cie left office President Eisenhower looked 
4'1.rounel and plucked from the Post Office De-
partment its General Counsel, a man named 
Abe McGregor Goff, who also happened to 
hail from Moscow, Idaho. 
It was late in the 19th century and early 
in this one that regulatory Commodious 
came to power in the U.S. Government; dur-
ing the depression they bloomed to full 
flower. Now Idaho is furnishing three ire, 
portant members of those important; regu-
latory Commissions. 
Rosel Hyde of the Federal Comnmnicatioas 
Commission is the senior of all U.S. reg 
ii tory Commissioners in time of service. 
Hamer Budge of the Securities and Sc'

missioncrs, but is coming to be one of the 
more respected_ 
And Abe McGreaor Goff is one of the me

Hie more gregeriot 
He enjoys people, likes being with cad 
friends, and meeting new acquaintancs S. 
And he loves to talk about his colorful at 
purposeful life. 
Goff had served in Congress from Idaht's 
First District before going to work for the 
Post Office DcparLnent. Before that he Imd 
been in the Army, in both World War II the; e-
ters. His service Secluded work on the SI .11 
of General MacArthur, work tis it brougnt 
him into contact with General Eisenhower, 
and work in the war crimes trials in Lie 
Fir Eastern theater. 
But his fame in Idaho preceded his wisic 
In politics, government, and the militate. 
The first time Or gon State played Idaho at 
Boise--1923?Golf was a lineman of the 
Idaho team that won, 7 to O. Playing will 
him were Sib KleTner, Skippy Slivers, John 
Vessar, Larry Quinn, Bob Fitzke, Ray Ste-
phens, Charlie Bousen, and Dusty Kline, 
among others. Later he became a footbell 
coach, a prosecuting attorney, a State sen::-
tor, and president of the Idaho State Bar 
JV;sociation. 
Tn. World War I. Golf served as a private i 
the Army. He entered the second war as a 
major and rose to the rank of colonel, win-
ning the Legion of Merit and nine other 
decorations. Amellg the many unusual far at 
about this man is the fact that he is admitted 
to practice law before the Supreme Court Lif 
Ile has held national offices in the Ameri-
ca u liar Association, the American Socie;:a7 
fiiC International law, the Federal Bar Asso-
ciation, the Federal :Bar Foundation, and the 
Jialge Advocates Association. 
Coif was born December 21, 1899, at Col-
fax, Wash. he was married in 1927 to 
Florence Richardson, then a faculty member 
at the University of Idaho. They have two 
children, both now grown. He is an Episco-
palian. 
Goff waa with tie British in North Africa 
during Romm.el's 1942 drive across the sands; 
later he became a military envoy to the Em-
peror Haile Selassie.. and for a time served 
as military escort to Madam Chiang KU-
slick. He organized Use InternaLonal 
eeution Section for the Supreme Commandtr 
in Tokyo before the war crimes trials there. 
And the Secretary of War once asaigned him 
to maks a special review of the court-mart!.1 
of Billy Mitchell?Gen, William Mitchell 
The appointment of the ICC was not the 
first time Goff had succeeded William E. Lee; 
in 1926, when Lee left Moscow to become a 
member of the Raho Supreme Court, Goff 
took over his place as the law partner of 
C. J. Orland. Goff had been a junior al - 
terney in the firm 2 years. 
The Chairman of th,e ICC is selected from 
among the members on a rotating basis; 
Golf rotated into the -top spot during 196 I. 
He found himself shiefiy concerned with big 
railroad mergers being proposed, tl-e 
giant of all being the New York Central with 
the Pennsylvania. Golf's decisions and 
views then might be felt for years to coir e 
In the economic a ad thansportation systems 
of America. 
Like most Commissioners, Golf cares ri,t 
to talk about spec fit eases. But he will re-
mark upon tlae general place of his Com-
mission and all regulatory Commissions in 
the American system. 
Goff disagrees with any tendencies to cuill 
the regulatory Commissions "a fourth braim't 
of Government." Actually, says he, tie, 
combine elements of all three branches?the 
judicial, the executive, the legislative. Hie 
if they must be classified under one branch. 
that one branch, Goff thinks, must 'be the 
legislative. 
"We are an agent of the Congress. No 
it's true that we are known as quasi-judica.1 
agencies because we hold hearings and issile 
decisions. And we also exercise some of ilia 
functions of the executive--we have enforce-
ment people who see to it that our politics 
are carried out. 
"Basically, though, we are an instrumen., 
of Congress. Now, the Congress could sb, 
down and it could write out safety rogue) - 
tions and freight rates and weight spec-
ifications and all the rest of that. 
"But it is so complicated, so complicatee. 
that Congress would find time to do nothina 
else. And so we handle that work tuade, 
authority set out by Congress. The Cur. 
gress can change anything we do. It can 
limit us or restrict us. We don't have ill, 
power of a fourth branch of Government. ' 
Wars Lost in Home Capitals 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF' 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 1966 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, his
does repeat itself, or we might web 
say that the present administration 
caught in its own web of confusion in it.; 
continued failure to provide leadership 
in the Vietnam war. The Chicago Trib-
une editorially brought; home in very 
effective fashion this morning the lack of 
progress based on the lack of a practical 
policy: 
WARS LOST IN HOME CAPITALS 
President Johnson is back where he was s 
year ago on the war in Vietnam. On Apri. 
7, 1965, at Johns Hopkins University, he 
offered the Communists "unconditional dia-. 
cussions" to end the war, throwing in tin 
promise of a billion dollars for reconstrue 
tion as a sweetener. North Vietnani 
responded that he could go roll his hoop. 
Yesterday Mr. Johnson seized the fifth en 
niversary of the Peace Corps as occasion to 
renew his plea that the Communist regime 
in Hanoi negotiate peace and let war stant 
aside while elections are held. He said tilt 
United States would abide by the out conn 
of the balloting, presumably even if the Cant 
munists were to win a big or controlling volt't 
in the Government of South Vietnam. 
Along with this was the familiar tender o; 
"a massive effort of reconstruction and de 
velopment open to all including North Viet-
nam." 
It is the same old Johns Hopkins formula 
It didn't work then and it won't work me,: 
As we remarked on that previous occasion 
we are not aware that history offers a single 
instance that the Johnson formula of a pin 
chased peace has ever bought off an invader

is so active in sneering at or denouncing 
American policies. 
Mr. HUMPHREY visited- South Korea, the 
Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, India, 
Pakistan, Thailand, and Laos, and, of course, 
spent some time in South Vietnam. All of 
these countries were given a clear statement 
not only of America's firmness and resolute-
ness in handling the Vietnam war but of 
the sincere desire of the United States to 
achieve an honorable peace. 
Mr. Johnson, while Vice President, also 
made trips to Asia, Africa, and Europe, and 
in the preceding administration, Vice Presi-
dent Nixon went to countries on every conti-
nent, including a visit to the Soviet Union. 
The use of a Vice President for foreign trips 
is even more necessary today than it was a 
decade or two ago, because the international 
situations that have since developed are 
frequently subject to misunderstanding, 
particularly as the Communists are busily 
engaged in fomenting friction by means of 
repeated distortions. 
When the Constitution was written, it was 
agreed that a Vice President should be desig-
nated to succeed the President in the event 
of the latter's death or disability, but no-
where else in the document were any duties 
of a Vice President specified in relation to 
the executive branch of the Government, 
Some Presidents have altogether ignored 
their No. 2 man. In the last 30 years, how-
ever, it has became customary for the Vice 
President to attend Cabinet meetings and to 
be given the confidential background of 
many important developments in national 
and international policies. 
Mr. HUMPHREY happens to be a very vocal, 
healthy, exuberant person who delivers effec-
tive speeches. He has a congenial person-
ality and makes a good impression abroad. 
Most important of all, he follows carefully 
the instructions given him by the President 
and the Secretary of State back home. So 
the role of the Vice President as a roving 
ambassador is indeed unique. 
Certainly, in bygone days, when it was 
often said that a Vice President really had 
nothing to do, few people envisaged the im-
portant position that the No. 2 man occupies 
today in the American Government and 
throughout the world. 
Those Who Place Themselves Above the 
Law 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 1966 
Mr. TEAGUE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
under leave to extend my remarks I am 
pleased to include an editorial from the 
"Stars and Stripes-National Tribune" 
Issue of February 17,1966. This thought-
ful editorial gets to the crux of the mat-
ter by stating: "We abhor the ever-grow-
ing doctrine that, if in an individual's 
judgment a law is a bad one, then he is 
not bound to conform with it." 
The expression of this doctrine by 
Professor Lynd and the draft board sit-
ins by students at the University of Mich-
igan is special cause for concern because 
it comes from educated people who 
should have more appreciation of the 
consequences of their acts. The end re-
sult of this doctrine is anarchy and I join 
with the "Stars and Stripes-National 
Tribune" in expressing the hope that ac-
tion will be taken to curb such activities. 
IS LYND UNTOUCHABLE? 
Like millions of other Americans, we are 
deeply concerned with the actions of Staugh-
ton Lynd, Yale professor who has so flagrantly 
flaunted the laws of our Nation. 
Lynd, on two occasions has taken unto 
himself the prerogatives of defying the U.S. 
Government and the laws of that Govern-
ment. Ho traveled to North Vietnam, meet-
ing there with high Communist officials 
without U.S. authorization and actually in 
defiance of statutes which prohibit travel to 
foreign countries by U.S. citizens unless law-
fully permitted. 
More recently the Yale professor left the 
United States and appeared on a television 
broadcast in London, England, again without 
express permission from Government officials. 
We abhor the ever-growing doctrine that, 
if in an individual's judgment a law is a bad 
one, then he is not bound to conform with it. 
This was first promulgated in aggressive civil 
rights demonstrations. 
By far the overwhelming percentage of law-
abiding American citizens do not look with 
favor upon Lynd's defiance of a Government 
edict. Not only is he an American citizen 
duty bound to obey the laws of his country,. 
but his consorting with enemy leaders in 
enemy country gives the impression that our 
law-enforcement agencies for some reason to 
not want to take such perpetrators to task. 
When American boys are dying daily in 
South Vietnam no unauthorized American 
citizen should abrogate to himself the func-
tions of proper Government officials. We be-
lieve that it is time to curb the travel ten-
dencies of Staughton Lynd and any other 
Americans who entertain similar views. 
When Marines Wage Peace in Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JAMES C. CORMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 1966 
Mr. CORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it was 
my great privilege to visit South Vietnam 
last fall and spend a week in the field 
with the 3d Marine Division. I served 
with this division in World War II, when 
it was bent on recovering territory seized 
by the Japanese. 
Today, in Vietnam, the 3d Marine Di-
vision is determined to rid Asia of a new 
aggressor?the North Vietnamese Viet-
cong. All of us are very much aware of 
the military efforts of the marines in 
Vietnam, but there are many who do not 
realize that the United States and the 
marines are waging an equally impor-
tant battle in southeast Asia?a battle 
against hunger, disease, and fear. 
When American marines go into Viet-
namese villages, they often carry the 
tools of peace, as well as the implements 
of war, rood, clothing, medicine, and 
friendlaoss are winning hearts while 
weaponr provide security. 
In the United States, marine reservists 
are raising CARE funds for these same 
villages, and other organizations are 
joining in this vital campaign. 
The Christian Science Monitor, on 
February 24, published an excellent 
article detailing some of the marine ac-
A1135 
tivities in this other war. At this time, 
I insert this article in the RECORD in the 
hope you will share my pride in the 
Marine Corps and its Commandant, Gen. 
Wallace M. Greene, Jr.: 
WHEN MARINES WAGE PEACE IN VIETNAM 
(By David K. Willis) 
WASHINGTON.?AS the first marines 
walked warily into the hamlet, children 
watched silently from doorways. Adults 
stayed inside. 
The sun beat down; fear and hostility 
hung in the air. 
The villagers knew the Americans were 
fighting the Vietcong, but they were afraid 
of both sides. They just wanted to get back 
to their rice fields and to be left alone. 
The marines started to patrol. As they 
fanned out, someone noticed a pump was 
broken. Without a word, it was fixed. 
VILLAGERS TRAINED 
The next day, a group of villagers walked 
over to the Marine headquarters, smiling 
gratefully. Soon they were stanch allies. 
A new cistern was built with sand and 
cement bought by the marines from their 
own pockets. After a Vietcong attack, Ma-
rine doctors treated several villagers, then 
opened a center and helped up to 150 
patients a day, 6 days a week. 
"For Vietnam's 15 to 16 million people, 
there are only 900 doctors," a senior officer in 
the Agency for International Development 
(AID) told this newspaper, "but 600 of them 
are in the armed forces." 
Others with medical training are either 
elderly or saddled with political or other re-
sponsibilities, and can work only part time 
in the health field. 
Air Force Maj. Gen. James W. Humphreys 
is AID's man in charge of the medical effort. 
He is making radical changes in the program. 
He is encouraging U.S. medical units to 
train as many Vietnamese as possible. 
These workers are trained in rudimentary 
hygiene and health care. 
Town health centers, safe from the Viet-
cong, are replacing vulnerable village sta-
tions. 
Women are being encouraged to take up 
nursing. This has been a challenge, because, 
traditionally, nurses?like schoolteachers?
have been men. 
"We've broken the tradition, we think," 
said one official. "Now 70 percent of new 
nurses are female. Two years ago, it was 
20 percent." 
From time to time, AID officials tour the 
United States looking for volunteer nurses 
to serve in Vietnam. Recruiting drives have 
been held' in Chicago, Los Angeles, and else-
where. Housing and other facilities are lim-
ited in Saigon, but officials accept as many 
volunteers as they can. 
FUND DRIVES SET 
The war has also put a new focus on quick 
courses-6 weeks to 3 months?for lower 
echelon Vietnamese, to turn them into health 
workers for rural areas. 
The Vietcong killed 30 of these health of-
ficers last year, and the Government pay is 
low?less than $1 a day. So the Vietnamese 
are not rushing to volunteer. 
The Vietcong tells villagers that Americans 
will steal, kill, and torture. At the village 
of Le My, 7 miles north of Da Nang, more 
than one marine was killed by sniper fire as 
they began handing out extra rice. 
But the people saw that the rice kept com-
ing, that their children were, freely helped 
by military doctors, that the "terrible" Amer-
icans smiled under their helmets. 
A sergeant in Da Nang bought a small 
horse to give children rides. Others gave 
dolls to orphanages. 
Then last September, the Marine Corps 
Commandant, Can. Wallace M. Greene, Jr., 
decided to organize this "civic action" on a 
wide scale.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. GLENN CUNNINGHAM 
OF NEERASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 24, 1966 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, 
Rev, Daniel Lyons, S.J., writing in Our 
Sunday Visitor, the National Catholic 
ecumenical weekly, stated: 
We used to be able to count cal our Gov-
ernment to protect us from salacious litera-
ture, but not any longer. Its sense of values 
has been perverted. The Government pro-
tects us from drugs that harm the body, hilt 
when it comes to , salacious literature or 
seductive films that harm our morals, the 
Government does not seem to care. 
I strongly believe the legislative 
branch of our Government does care, as 
evidenced by the fact the House of Rep-
resentatives overwhelmingly passed my 
bill last year to halt the unsolicited flow 
of obscenity through the mails. This 
legislation is now before the other body 
and I am hopeful of early consideration. 
Passage of this legislation, H.R. .980, will 
show the American people we do care. 
Cardinal Spellman said recently: 
Our youth today is under assault from a 
powerhouse of perversion. 
Father Lyons may have been appealing 
to the Congress of the United States 
when he added: 
For God's sake, do something abcart it. 
I would commend Father Lyons' col-
umn to the attention of every Member of 
the Congress: 
THE RIGHT To DESTROY 
(By Rev. Daniel Lyons, 
Tell me what you read and I will tell you 
what you are. Americans spend $2 billion 
a year on pornographic literature. If the 
merchants of filth traded only with aclults, it 
would be bad enough, but three-fourths of

their early teens. 
Are you as an individual helping to pre-
serve the values on which our Nation was 
founded, and on which it must; rely in order 
to survive? Or are you, through your broad-
mindness and indifference, letting the youth 
around you become corrupted? To aay that 
"there is nothing I can do about it" is just 
taking the easy way out. 
We used to be able to count on our Gov-
ernment to protect us from salacious litera-
ture, but not any longer. Its sense of values 
has been perverted. The Government pro-
tects us from drugs that harm the body, 
but when it comes to salacious literature,

standard, unacceptable by education or 
other practical criteria. 
Furthermore, the cutback in appropri-
ations for this program does not produce 
any appreciable savings. Any reduc-
tion, at the expense of our schoolchil-
dren, particularly those who are under-
privileged and improperly nourished, can 
only be viewed as a penny-wise and 
pound-foolish program. 
Many children, especially those from 
low-income families, the ones who need 
the milk most, will drop out of the pro-
gram. I can think of no better invest-
ment of our national resources than in 
this milk program which strengthens the 
bodies and health habits of our young 
people. Since the Government is already 
buying milk, I question whether there 
are really alternate uses for this milk 
that are more economic and important 
than the milk school program. 
Mr. Speaker, the school milk program 
has proven over the years to be most 
effective. I see no need to reduce this 
program which has cost relatively little 
and done so much. 
INTEREST RATE INCREASE ON VOL-
UNTARY CIVIL SERVICE RETIRE-
MENT CONTRIBUTIONS 
(Mr. OLSEN of Montana (at the re-
quest of Mr. McGRATH) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD, and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. OLSEN of Montana. Mr. Speaker, 
I have introduced a bill today to increase 
the interest rate paid by the civil service 
retirement fund on voluntary contribu-
tions of employees from 3 to 41/4 percent. 
The 3-percent rate was first fixed when 
the system of voluntary contributions 
by employees under the civil service re-
tirement system was established by the 
act of August 4, 1939?Public Law 263, 
76th Congress?and is continued today 
at the same old-fashioned, outdated rate. 
We are continually being reminded 
that the annuities payable under the 
civil service retirement system are wholly 
inadequate and afford little more than 
a minimum standard of subsistence for 
our elder civil service retirees. Just last 
year our committee was instrumental in 
obtaining legislation, Public Law 89-205, 
to increase the annuitiA for the retirees, 
all at the expense of the Government. 
The voluntary contribution system 
would permit Federal employees to con-
tribute additional amounts to the retire-
ment fund in order to provide a sufficient 
annuity which will meet their needs 
when they retire. It is these voluntary 
contributions on which the Government 
today is only paying 3 percent. 
I believe the Government should pro-
vide an incentive to the employees and 
encourage the system of voluntary con-
tributions to a much greater extent than 
can now be expected when the Govern-
ment pays an outdated and fantastically 
low interest rate of 3 percent. 
In addition to providing additional 
encouragement for the employee to plan 
an adequate annuity for his future re-
quirements, an hierease in the rates of 
Interest on these contributions will be-
come one of the Nation's additional 
weapons in averting inflation and thus 
coincide with the President's program 
Just recently announced to increase the 
rate on savings bonds. 
Savings bonds yielded 2.9 percent in-
terest in 1941 at the time the voluntary 
contributions were earning 3 percent. 
The savings bond rate was increased to 
3 percent in 1952, to 3.52 percent in 1957, 
to 3.75 percent in 1959, and now has been 
Increased to 4.15 percent. Certainly, we 
should expect to pay at least this much 
on the voluntary contributions by our 
employees to the civil service retirement 
fund. 
It is perfectly ridiculous when the 3-
percent rate is compared to the mini-
mum 41/2-percent rate now being paid by 
savings and loan associations, or the 51/4 
to 51/2 percent that the Federal Housing 
Administration now permits to be 
charged on FHA mortgages. 
Mr. Speaker, we certainly are not be-
ing fair to our employees by permitting 
the 3-percent rate to continue. I believe 
we should encourage the employees to 
contribute greater amounts as voluntary 
contributions and thus assist the Presi-
dent in his program to avert inflation 
under the current economic situation. I 
will urge for immediate consideration of 
this legislation before our Committee on 
Lf)/Post Office and Civil Service. 
VIETNAM?FACTS ARE NEEDED 
RATHER THAN FANCY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
previous order of the House, the gentle-
man from Delaware [Mr. McDowEra.] is 
recognized for 15 minutes. 
Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, in the 
current debate over national policy in 
Vietnam almost everybody claims to be 
an expert. The position of some of the 
self-styled experts only goes to prove 
how essential it is to have the facts be-
fore rushing into print, or onto the air-
waves. 
Some of those in a position to present 
their views to the public do have the 
facts, while others are in the main moved 
by fancy. It is for this reason that I 
call to the attention of my colleagues the 
following two articles by writers in pos-
session of the facts. 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star, 
Mar. 1, 19661 
WASII/NGTON CLOSE-UP: VIET DESERTIONS: 
FIGURES AND FACTS 
(By Richard Fryklund) 
The Government of South Vietnam has 
added up the number of deserters from its 
armed forces during the last year. The total 
is more than 100,000. 
In fact, South Vietnam has counted about 
100,000 deserters annually for 3 years. 
This is a huge number for a country that 
has only 675,000 men in all its forces, regular 
and home guard. In fact, any army that 
loses 100,000 men through desertions 3 years 
running simply cannot survive. 
Clearly something here does not make 
sense. Either the Army of South Vietnam is 
collapsing or the figures are wrong or those 
men aren't really deserters. 
Washington officials say it is easy to rule 
out a collapse of the South Vietnamese Army. 
It has never been in better shape. It is 
fighting at least as well as the enemy. It 
is growing. It is getting better equipment. 
Its morale is good. 
A year or two ago a collapse would have 
been possible, but not today. 
Could the figures be wrong? Certainly 
not that wrong. 
The South Vietnamese Army keeps pretty 
good statistics now, using methods taught 
by American military advisers. 
The men are fingerprinted and photo-
graphed as they are enlisted. The Toll is 
called every morning and anyone who doesn't 
answer "here" is put on the deserter list. 
This is where we find a departure from 
the practice of the American Forces. Here, 
a man is listed as "absent without leave" 
when he first fails to turn up and becomes a 
deserter only when it is clear that he does 
not intend to return. 
But even if a missing South Vietnamese 
soldier returns the next day and apologizes 
for overstaying a pass, he still becomes a 
number on the desertion list. No one knows 
how many of the listed deserters are really 
AWOL, but there must be many of them. 
tinder the South Vietnamese system, a 
deserter can also be a man who transferred 
himself to another outfit without any legal 
formalities. 
American advisers in South Vietnam say 
that it is common for a soldier, particularly 
a new recruit or a draftee, to leave his as-
signed base, return to his home village and 
reenlist as a home guardsman or even a 
regular. 
He is listed as a deserter from his original 
outfit, but the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment understands the deep feelings of a 
peasant for his home and for the graves of 
his ancestors and so it tolerates such 
transfers. 
Some men, of course, are real deserters. 
They go over to the enemy or go home. 
What this true figure is, no one can say for 
sure. Pentagon estimates indicate it has 
been about 20,000 or 30,000 a year for several 
years. 
This is a high desertion rate, too, but it 
also is misleading. 
Men seem to desert without too many 
qualms and often without severe punish-
ment from the armies on both sides in South 
Vietnam. 
The Communist forces, regulars, irregulars, 
and organizers who can bear arms, number 
about 235,000 men now. About 1,600 of 
these men deserted in January and came 
over to the Government's side. How many 
went home is not known. Through Febru-
ary 15, another 1,167 deserted. 
On an annual basis, the enemy probably 
has a desertion rate therefore, of something 
like 5 or 10 percent. The South Vietnamese 
rate cannot be any higher. 
It is probable, however, that the Vietcong 
rate is going up while the Government rate 
is going down. For the last 3 years, the 
strength of the Government forces has in-
creased from 400,000 at the end of 1963 to 
676,000 at the end of 1964 to 675,000 at the 
end of 1965. But the official desertion rate 
has been rather steady. 
The present high rates on the enemy side 
are setting wartime records and may indicate 
an important new trend. 
Despite desertions, both sides are able to 
maintain their strength and even grow, 
mostly by volunteers. 
Draft figures on the enemy side are not 
known but the South Vietnamese regular 
armed forces have only 13 percent draftees?
a figure comparable with that of the Ameri-
can Army. All of the home guard forces, 
about 100,000 men, are volunteers. 
The South Vietnamese people, then, must 
be roughly as willing to fight for their village 
or country as are Americans. 
If, even after all the corrections, the de-
sertion figures for South Vietnam cannot be 
easily reconciled with American experience, 
it may simply be because of differences in 
custom and outlook. The figures may always 
puzzle us, but they need not be cause for 
alarm.

HIGHWAY SAFETY RESEARCH AND 
DE VELOPMENT 
(Mr. FALLON (at the request of Mr. 
McGamm) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
tECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. FALI,ON. Mr. Speaker, I have to-
day introduced legislation which would 
amend title 23 of the United States Code 
to provide for even greater highway 
safety research and development on all 
of our Nation's roads than now exist. 
During the entire operation of the Fed-
eral-aid highway program from its in-
ception in 1916 to the present date the 
question of safety has been one of the 
outstanding factors in the operation of 
the program. The Committee on Public 
Works which reported out the great Fed-
eral-Aid Highway Act of 1956 and which 
has handled the operation of this pro-
gram during the ensuing years has been 
acutely aware of the need ? for writing 
into any legislation authorizing highway 
construction the proper controls for 
safety measures including needed re-
search. In our legislation we have con-
sistently sought to bring out highway de-
sign factors which would contribute the 
maximum possible safe operation of the 
i.Tiads for the users thereof. This in-
cludes such items as wide bridges, firm 
shoulders with gentle slope, elimination 
of roadside obstructions and few inter-
sections. 
The legislation that I have introduced 
today will further implement this course 
of highway safety we have followed in 
1,he committee through the entire opera-
tion of the Federal-aid highway pro--
gram. There is need to cut back the 
appalling loss of life and injuries that 
are suffered day in and day out on the 
various roads of our Nation. The com-
mittee was acutely aware of this last year 
and last year it adopted the so-called 
Baldwin amendment which provides that 
atter December 31, 1967, each State 
should have an adequate highway safety 
Program as approved by the Secretary of 
Commerce. 
We will continue in the Committee on 
Oublic Works in the future to pay the 
most careful attention to safety factors 
in highway construction and do all with-
di our legislative power to see that the 
day will come when the drivers on our 
Nation's roads will be able to travel from 
one section of our Nation to the other 
he safest and most practical manner. 
would like to include at this time a 
brief digest of the highway safety re-
;gionsibilities of the Bureau of Public

way laws reported by the Committee on 
Public Works: 
,,,ATINTENTS CONCERNING HIGHWAY SAFETY 
iii.:FSPONSIBILITIni OF THE BUREAU OF Pan-
1(0 UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS 
Highway safety is a predominant and in-
"heron]; factor throughout the whole Federal-
-id highway program since its inception un-
der the Federal Highway Act of 1916. 
Some of the statutory references to safety 
appearing in title 23 of the 'United States 
Code (which has codified all of the Federal 
highway laws enacted throughout the years) 
are as follows: 
Section 109(a), vvhthh provides that plans 
and specifications for projects shall only be 
approved if they will adequately meet the 
existing and probable future needs and con-
ditions in a manner conducive to safety. 
This provision stems from section 8 of the 
1921 act.. 
Section 109:d) relates to official traffic 
signs and signals which will promote the 
safe arid efficient utilization (A' highways. 
Section 307,a) expressly authorizes the 
Secretary to ergage in research on all phases 
of safety. 
Section 307(7) expressly presides that the 
States may use up to 114 porcent of? their 
apportioned Federal-aid funds for various 
types of planning surveys and investigations, 
including safety studies. 
Section 125 :Baldwin amendment), which 
was enacted on August 28, 1965, presides 
that after December 31, 1967, each State 
should have an adequate highway saletN, pro-
gram as approved by the Secretary, and 
places the responsibility on the Secretary to 
establish uniform standards for such pro-
gram. 
Section 313 of title 23 directs the Secre-
tary to assist in carrying cut the notion 
program of the President on highway ssfety. 
The act approved on July 14. 1960, presides 
that the Secretary of Commerce shall estab-
lish and maintain a driver register sen ice?
in the interest of safety. 
Pursuant to iection 117 of the Federal-Aid 
Highway Act of 1916, the Secretary of Com-
merce was directed to make a comprehensive 
investigation and study on the whole sub-
ject of highway safety. This study reflects 
the magnitude and complexity of the high-
way safety program and the various reipon-
sibilities of the Secretary of Commerce and 
the Bureau of Pubic Roads in such regard. 
Copy of this report is enclosed. 
The Bureau a now engaged in a hirtway 
safety improvement projects program. The 
status of this program is redected Ir the 
enclosed statements. 
On December '1, 1961, the Office of High-
way Safety was established in the Bureau as 
a major unit, headed by a Director. At pres-
ent, this office has a complement of 51 per-
sonnel on board, with an authorized com-
plement of 68 in order to meet personnel 
requirements iacident to developing al and-
ards under the Baldwin amendm.ent. The 
current budget for this present fiscal year is 
$1.2 million. 
The Bureau's budget for highway sifety 
research for 1966 is $2.3 million, ape. for 
1967 is $6.6 million. 
It is estimated that upon completien of 
the interstate there will be a total savings 
of 8,000 lives aanually due to highway i:fcci-
dents. 
COLICIUSiOI it should be said that high-
way safety is ir terw oven in ail phases o: the 
Federal-aid highway program.

SCHOOL MILK PRO3RAM 
(Mr. KASTENMEIER, (at the request 
of Mr. McG RATH ) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD, and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mi.. Speaker, I 
am introducing a bill today to establish 
a permanent special milk program for 
children. 
Although milk and dairy products 
have been made available for school 
lunch programs since 1955, conditions 
arose recently which threaten to cut off 
this supply. The school milk program 
is scheduled to be terminated on June 
30, 1967. Furthermore, the Department 
of Agriculture had notified all school 
districts that after February 1, 1966, al-
locations for the special milk program 
would be reduced by 10 percent. For fis-
cal 1967, beginning July 1, the admin-
istration plans to cut spending on school 
milk from $103 to $21 million. 
Originally set up as only a school pro-
gram, this special milk program was 
later expanded to include summer camps, 
nursery centers, and other child-care in-
stitutions. It is estimated that between 
24 to 26 million children daily in 92.000 
to 93,000 schools throughout our Nation 
received around 3 billion half pints of 
milk through this program in 1965. Al-
though the program is not compulsory, 
it encourages children to drink more 
milk by making it available at a price 
that most children can afford, generally 
3 to 4 cents on the average for a half 
pint, and at no cost to those children 
who are unable to pay for the milk. 
Mr. Speaker, at a time when our Gov-
ernment is spending millions of dollars 
to rehabilitate school dropouts, is en-
larging the food stamp program and car-
rying on a war against poverty, it is 
inconsistent to curtail a program that 
adds to the health, energy and vitality 
of children who are in school. The 
school milk program is of vital impor-
tance for our youngsters because milk 
contains nutrients essential for good 
health. Milk is an important factor in 
building proper diet habits. Further-
more, we know -that a well-nourished 
child learns better than an undernour-
ished child. 
The proposal to distribute milk on the 
basis of economic need is unreasonable in 
view of the way the program works with-
in our schools. At present it is posstile 
to take a milk break at midmorning. All 
students are able to stop for a moment 
in their studies and enjoy the wholesome 
benefits of milk. Not only does this pro-
vide them immediate nourishment and 
enhance their ability to continue their 
studies, it also establishes good health 
habits. Instead of running to the coke 
machine, they are finding that milk pro-
vides more of their needs and contributes 
more to the building of healthy and 
sound bodies. 
If the proposal to limit the program to 
the needy is enforced, school adminis-
trators are going to be asked to segre-
gate those students whose parents have 
a low level of income from those who can 
afford to buy the milk. Not only is this 
requesting something our schools are 
not geared to do, but it also is likely to 
create an artificial barrier between stu-
dents. 
As a result many students are likel,c to 
forgo accepting milk :rather than accept 
the stigma of being labeled poor and un-
able to pay for a glass of milk. It would 
be in my judgment a grave mistake to 
replace the broad and vastly popular milk 
program with one geared to some poverty

March 3, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 4679 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Mar. 2, 
1966] 
THE UNTOLD SToRy: VICTORY? 
(By Joseph Alsop) 
Instead of gabbling interminably about 
escalation, this town would do well to begin 
talking about the possibility of winning the 
Vietnamese war. 
The antiescalators are either ignorant or 
dishonest; for they never mention the key 
fact, that it is the enemy who has been doing 
the escalating. If the enemy is in the proc-
ess of putting in another eight divisions, as 
explained in the last report in this space, the 
President has only two possible choices. He 
can retreat and surrender, or he can match 
the enemy's increase of force. 
But this escalation by the enemy is like 
a medal with two sides. On one side, it 
demands a greater American effort. But on 
the other side, it gives a stronger promise of 
American success. For it is really like a last 
high raise in poker, which exhausts the 
raiser's resources, but by no means exhausts 
his opponent's resources. 
To see why this is so, one must first turn 
to the Mao Tse-tung-Vo Nguyen Giap book 
of rules of guerrilla warfare. In phase I of 
such a war, says the book, the guerrilla 
movement is organized. In phase If, classi-
cal guerrilla war is carried on, with ever-
increasing ferocity but always in small units, 
guerrilla-style combats, until the other side 
is hanging on the ropes. And when?but 
only when?this point is reached, phase III 
begins with the organization of larger units, 
of at least regimental strength, to finish off 
the other side in large conventional battles. 
The rule book is particularly strict about 
continuing phase II until victory in phase 
III is absolutely certain. When General de 
Lattre de Tassigny took over the command 
in the French war, General Giap entered 
phase II prematurely. After only one really 
major setback, Glap at once returned to 
phase It, and he patiently remained in phase 
It until ,Dienblenphu, over 3 years later. 
According to the rule book, a similar return 
to phase II should have been the enemy's 
response when he was taken by surprise by 
the large-scale American intervention last 
summer. There are good reasons to believe 
there was an argument about this, no doubt 
among the North Vietnamese leaders, and 
also between Hanoi and Peiping. 
Lin Piao's famous, outwardly ferocious 
paper on "People's War" contains clear evi-
dence of this argument; for it includes an 
interminable recitation of rules from the 
book, all of which are now being broken by 
the North Vietnamese and Vietcong. In 
Communist discourse, in circumstances of 
this sort, such things are not said accident-
ally. 
Why, then, is phase III being obstinately 
continued? The answer almost certainly is 
that no other choice was open, because of the 
impairment of the Vietcong infrastructure 
by the effort to enter phase HI. 
This was a very big and very costly effort. 
In 1964-65, the Vietcong recruited, trained 
and put in the field no less than 18 main 
force regiments, bringing their own force 
of regulars up to the equivalent of 8 divi-
sions. The northern divisions also came 
south: By the spring of 1965, therefore, the 
Vietcong infrastructure was carrying the 
heavy burden of a regular army of 10 divi-
sions, additional to the local and guerrilla 
forces. 
For this purpose, every promise to the vil-
lage people had to be broken. Very heavy 
taxes were levied. Universal, press gang-
style conscription was enforced. Thus ex-
pansion to enter phase III both alienated the 
villages, and diluted the Vietcong military 
units, at every level from guerrilla band up 
to main force regiment, with great numbers 
of raw, unwilling conscripts. 
No. 38-10 
Apparently therefore, it was considered too 
dangerous to respond to the arrival of the 
Americans by contraction to phase IT, with 
all its bitter overtone of hope long deferred 
and the struggle long continued. The course 
now being followed, however, is also acutely 
dangerous. 
The main danger is the added strain on the 
Vietcong infrastructure. If the intelligence 
is correct, the infrastructure's 1965 burden 
of a regular army of 10 divisions will grow, 
by the end of 1966, to the burden of an army 
of 20 divisions. 
This army's weapons and ammunition will 
of course come from the north. But every-
thing else must be found in the south?
countless recruits to fill gaps in the ranks; 
manpower for greatly expanded porter bat-
tallions; food and many other supplies, and 
so on and on. 
This will be no light burden. In fact, it is 
so clearly excessive that Hanoi's current re-
inforcement of the Vietcong is just as clearly 
a one-shot proposition?a last high raise in 
the game, In fact. And those who make a 
last high raise can always be beaten by those 
with the resources and the guts to call and 
raise again.
