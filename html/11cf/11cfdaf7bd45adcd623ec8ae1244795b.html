 A month of intense political maneuver-
 ing is likely to end this week with the
 collapse of the Moro government and a
 decision by President Leone to dissolve
 parliament and schedule an election.
 All that remains is for parliament to
 complete a debate requested by the Chris-
 tian Democrats on a series of economic
 proposals drawn up by the government
 last week. The debate is scheduled to end
 with a confidence vote. Moro may step
 down in advance of the balloting,
 however, since the Socialists and Social
 Democrats have already said they will
 vote against the government.
 The Christian Democrats are still
 plagued by deep internal differences that
 center mainly on the question of how to
 deal with the Communist Party. Christian
 Democratic conservatives have urged
 Moro to resign in order to make way for a
 prime minister from the Christian
 Democratic right to lead the party into an
 election. Moro and Christian Democratic
 leader Zaccagnini, who lead the party left,
 want to avoid an election, even if it means
 giving the Communists an indirect role in
 national policy making.
 The decision to hold a parliamentary
 debate was a compromise between the two
 sides. It seems likely to give the Christian
 Democratic right the election it has
 sought and to leave the party left at the
 helm of the government, since Moro will
 probably be asked to stay on in a
 caretaker status if parliament is dissolved.
 The Christian Democrats are ill
 prepared to face the electorate.
 Communist leader Berlinguer is still
 unenthusiastic about an early election and
 wary of the political polarization that the
 campaign is likely to produce. Party rank
 and file, however, are urging the
 leadership to push for an election and to
 move toward an alliance with the
 Socialists. The Communist leadership is
 emphasizing its continued preference for
 an eventual partnership with the Christian
 Democrats-the  "historic  com-
 promise'

 PO  UCAL
 The legislative election on April 25 did
 little to chart a clear political course for
 Portugal and instead injected a new note
 of uncertainty into Portuguese politics.
 The Socialist Party remained the
 leading vote-getter, but it failed to win
 sufficient seats in the assembly to enable
 party leader Mario Soares to form a
 government without at least some outside
 support in parliament. The Socialists ob-
 tained 35 percent of the vote, a drop of
 more than 2 percent from their showing
 in the 1975 election to the constituent
 assembly.
 The Popular Democratic Party came in
 second with 24 percent of the vote, a drop
 of 2 percentage points from its showing
 last year. The party was hurt by the
 revival of the conservative Social
 Democratic Center, which doubled its
 share of the 1975 vote-bringing it to 15.8
 percent-by appealing to essentially the
 same constituency as the Popular
 Democrats.
 The most surprising development was
 the strong showing of the Communist
 Party, although it dropped from third to
 fourth place. The Communist Party
 appeared to benefit from the lower voter
 turnout this year as it advanced some two
 points from its 1975 showing to 14.6 per-
 cent of the vote. This reflects, however,
 the Communists' ability to hold on to part
 ROMANIA     i I
 Romanian President Ceausescu, speak-
 ing on April 26, used exceptionally strong
 language to charge that Moscow is
 twisting Marxist-Leninist doctrine to ad-
 vance Soviet hegemony in the world com-
 munist movement.
 The Yugoslavs immediately rebroad-
 cast his speech, describing it as the "of-
 ficial opening of a polemic" against ad-
 vocates of limited sovereignty-a
 euphemism for the "Brezhnev Doctrine."
 Ceausescu told a pongress of Romanian
 trade unions that certain   Marx-
 ist-Leninist  "philosophers                            and
 theoreticians" are denigrating national
 sovereignty by interpreting "proletarian
 internationalism" to mean that anyone
 of the 4.5 percent of the vote received in
 1975 by one of its front groups that was
 not on the ballot this time.
 The failure of a clear winner to emerge
 will complicate efforts to form a govern-
 ment following the presidential election
 this summer. The Socialists will probably
 get the nod, but Mario Soares so far is
 continuing to insist that his party will
 govern alone or not at all.
 The Popular Democrats, the Social
 Democrats, and the Communists have
 voiced their claim to a share in the
 government.  With  approximately two
 months to go before a new government is
 to be installed, there will undoubtedly be a
 good deal of maneuvering among the four
 major parties and the military.

 SPAIN    6---
 Prime Minister Arias' speech to the na-
 tion on April 28 was the most detailed
 presentation of the government's reform
 program yet, but it will satisfy neither the
 opposition forces on the left nor the
 proponents of the status quo on the right.
 Responding to pressures from King
 Juan Carlos and reform-minded
 ministers, Arias outlined specific reform
 measures and a timetable for their im-
 plementation. His call for a referendum
 on constitutional reforms by next October
 who defends his nation's independence
 violates communist theory.
 The Romanian President said this argu-
 ment is "absolutely erroneous" and con-
 tradicts  Marxist-Leninist doctrine.
 Quoting Marx and Engels to support his
 position, he said the Romanian party and
 working class are "duty bound" to defend
 the "freedom of the fatherland."
 Ceausescu quoted Lenin to the effect
 that those who do not aspire to freedom
 are worthy only of repulsion, indignation,
 and contempt. He warned the Soviets that
 they themselves cannot be free if they op-
 press others and that "true" proletarian
 internationalism is based on the defense of
 national sovereignty.
 Ceausescu's strident rhetoric-which
 will  not  be  ignored  by  the
 and a general election early in 1977,
 however, sets a more leisurely pace than
 reformers like Foreign Minister Areilza
 had been urging.
 The Prime Minister said that all reform
 measures, except the election law, would
 be ready for submission to parliament by
 May 15. These are to include con-
 stitutional provisions on monarchical
 succession and the establishment of a
 bicameral legislature, with one house free-
 ly elected and the other retaining some of
 the features of the present Cortes. The
 changes in the legislative and monarchical
 succession are to be the topics for the
 referendum. There will also be revisions
 of the penal code and of laws restricting
 freedom of assembly and association to
 legalize non-extremist political parties.
 The government's proposal for widen-
 ing suffrage would be submitted by July
 15, according to Arias.
 Arias said he trusted the parliament
 would act on his proposals in time for the
 King to call the referendum on schedule,
 an indication that he is concerned over
 possible rightist obstructionism in the pre-
 sent parliament.
 Arias warned that the government's
 call for expanded political liberties does
 not extend to extremists on the left or the
 right who want  totalitarianism. This
 serves as a  reaffirmation of the
 government's stand against legalizing the
 Communist Party.
 Kremlin-suggests that Bucharest feels
 itself under pressure from Moscow. His
 charges and the prompt Yugoslav com-
 mentary clearly reflect the apprehensions
 of Bucharest and Belgrade over the
 greater Soviet emphasis on ideological
 conformity since the recent Soviet party
 congress and over Moscow's intentions in
 the Balkans in the post-Tito period.
 The Soviets have been steadily criticiz-
 ing the independent-minded communist
 parties, specifically those in Western
 Europe, for falling into the trap of
 "bourgeois nationalism," and Moscow
 and its loyal East European allies may use
 the occasion of the East German Party
 Congress opening May 18 to address the
 Romanian  challenge.                      25X1

 president be chosen before May 2 when
 the present parliament's term would have
 ended had it not been extended for two
 years last month. The leftists apparently
 want more time to consider their strategy
 and have intimated they may boycott the
 scheduled session.
 The top contenders to replace Fran-
 jiyah-Ilyas Sarkis, the choice of the con-
 servative Christians and the Syrians, and
 Raymond Edde, the favorite of the
 Lebanese left-have campaigned for sup-
 port throughout the week. Leftist leader
 Kamal Jumblatt and other anti-Syrian
 deputies object to Sarkis because of his
 close ties to Damascus. Edde has offended
 the Syrians and faces stiff opposition
 from conservative Christians who resent
 his calls for secularizing the government
 and his sympathetic attitude toward the
 Palestinians.
 I f neither Edde nor Sarkis is able to win
 over his major opposition, the race will be
 open to a host of weaker candidates. The
 parliamentary session might then turn
 into a prolonged debate that could upset
 Tensions dropped sharply in Lebanon
 after April 24, when President Franjiyah
 signed the constitutional amendment that
 provides for the immediate election of his
 successor by the parliament. The speaker
 of parliament has scheduled a vote for
 May 1, despite a controversy among the
 Lebanese political factions over the tim-
 ing and security arrangements for the
 election. The speaker acted after confer-
 ring with the Syrians, who continue trying
 to promote a political settlement in
 Lebanon.
 Ironically, the strongest protest over
 holding the election so soon after the
 promulgation of the constitutional
 amendment came from the Muslim left-
 ists who originally demanded that a new
 the shaky cease-fire in Beirut.
 The haphazard security arrangements
 for the brief parliamentary meeting
 earlier this month that passed the con-
 stitutional change proved how quickly
 security can collapse if left in the hands of
 the rival militias and the remnants of the
 Lebanese army. Similar patchwork
 arrangements have apparently been made
 for the May 1 session, although the 25X1
 Syrians have hinted that their forces in
 Beirut can guarantee the safety of the
 deputies.
 RHODESIA  % j,. 4
 Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith
 announced on April 27 that he is bringing
 ten blacks into his government. Four
 tribal chiefs were to be sworn in the next
 day as full cabinet members, and six depu-
 ty ministers will soon be appointed from
 among Rhodesia's black businessmen and
 professionals.
 Smith apparently hopes to offset the
 POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR LEBANESE PRESIDENCY
 The speaker of Lebanon's parliament has announced that a new
 presidential election will be held Saturday, May 1. The following
 reviews the possible presidential candidates.
 Ilyas Sarkis, the governor of the central bank, has strong backing
 from the Syrians, the Phalanges Party, and President Franjiyah and
 recently received endorsement from Prime Minister Karami. Sarkis
 does not have an independent power base in parliament like his
 chief rivals and will probably run into considerable trouble if the
 voting goes beyond a first or second ballot. Sarkis' greatest liability
 is that leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt and Palestinian leaders object
 to his close ties with the Syrians. His liberal attitude toward social
 reform, however, might sway Jumblatt to accept his candidacy.
 Raymond Edde, leader of Lebanon's third largest Christian party,
 has gained favor with Jumblatt and the leftists by advocating an end
 to confessionalism in government, including the Maronite Christian
 hold on the presidency. Edde's maverick position has antagonized
 many conservative Christians and raised doubts that he would
 provide responsible leadership. The Syrians adamantly opposed him
 because of his public denunciation of their efforts to bring about a
 cease-fire in January. President Franjiyah, who fears that Edde
 might use the presidency to discredit him, reportedly has threatened
 not to resign if Edde is elected.
 Edward Hunayn, a parliamentary deputy and member of Edde's
 party, has been mentioned by the conservative Christians as a
 fallback candidate. Hunayn has close ties with important Christian
 leaders but apparently has not been involved in the rivalry and petty
 feuding among them. He has generally taken a moderate course in
 the dispute between Muslims and Christians and has actively worked
 for reconciliation during the recent civil strife.
 Pierre Edde, the younger brother of Raymond Edde and a respected
 figure in his own right, has been mentioned as a possible alternative
 to his brother. Although Edde has served in both the cabinet and
 parliament, he is a less controversial politician than his brother and
 could attract support from the same quarters without inciting the
 same dislike.
 Jean Aziz, also a former deputy and cabinet minister, reportedly is
 on Jumblatt's list of possible compromise candidates. Aziz does not
 have any significant support among conservative Christians but
 apparently would be acceptable to them. He is from one of the few
 mixed Christian-Muslim areas in southern Lebanon and has carefully
 protected his home district from the recent civil strife.
 Pierre Hilu, a deputy and former minister, is considered a
 front-runner among the compromise candidates mainly because of
 his close connections with Jumblatt. He is the cousin of former
 president Charles Hilu which gives him automatic prominence in
 Lebanese circles although apparently not enough to make him a
 serious contender.
 Michel al-Khouri, the son of a former president and an adviser to
 President Franjiyah, has been mentioned by the Christians in their
 general casting about for candidates. His close association with
 Franjiyah, however, would almost certainly make him an unaccept-
 able figure for the leftists.
 General Hanna Said, commander in chief of the Lebanese Army, is
 not a participant in the campaign but is being considered as a
 possible nominee should parliament reach an impasse. He has
 generally tried to play a moderating role during the crisis and has
 been able to maintain the respect of many Muslims. F

 collapse last month of his constitutional
 settlement negotiations with Joshua
 Nkomo, one of the rival leaders of the
 divided African National Council.
 Nkomo had demanded immediate pari-
 ty between blacks and whites in top ex-
 ecutive positions and elections within a
 year under a broadened franchise that
 would put a black majority in the Rhode-
 sian parliament. Nkomo told the
 press-and Smith has not denied it-that
 Smith's best franchise offer would have
 postponed majority rule for at least ten
 years.
 Smith's token measures toward "power
 sharing" are not likely to win over
 Rhodesia's urban blacks, who have sup-
 ported Nkomo, nor to deter foreign back-
 ing for the Rhodesian guerrillas, who have
 recently stepped up incursions from bases
 in Mozambique.
 Nevertheless, Smith's announcement,
 following a closed caucus of the ruling
 Rhodesian Front Party, suggests that he
 has succeeded once again in asserting his
 unrivalled influence over Rhodesia's
 beleaguered white community. He has ap-
 parently faced down the sizable faction
 within his party that reportedly opposed
 even such token measures. He also may
 have reassured the relatively few white
 moderates who hope that some accom-
 modation of black aspirations might at
 least stem the Qrowth of insurgency
 EGYPT-USSR
 Egypt's foreign trade minister underlines
 the recognition by both sides that they
 would lose from a break in economic
 relations. Moscow is aware that an open
 break would foreclose the possibility of
 collecting  on  Egypt's  outstanding
 economic and military debt, the largest
 with the USSR by a third-world country.
 A severance of economic relations
 would also hurt Egypt. The Soviets are
 providing aid to expand the Huiwan steel
 mill-Egypt's only integrated steel com-
 plex-and the Naja Hammadi aluminum
 plant. These enterprises have absorbed
 more than a quarter of Moscow's $1.4
 billion of development assistance.
 It would be equally costly for Cairo to
 terminate its trade arrangements with the
 Soviets. Egypt's current exports to the
 USSR consist mainly of cotton and
 low-quality consumer goods. These goods
 would bring much less on world markets
 than the more than $500 million paid by
 the Soviets on bilateral account. Ad-
 ditional Western credits would be needed
 to pay for the essential goods Egypt now
 imports from the USSR, such as coking
 coal, jet fuel, and scrap iron.
 Although Cairo will probably phase out
 the Soviet presence, no overt steps have
 yet been taken to reduce the level or
 character of the economic relationship

 New threats against Kenya by Ugan-
 dan President Amin are certain to
 heighten fears in Nairobi about Kam-
 pala's military intentions.
 According to a Ugandan radio broad-
 cast on April 27, Amin is "seriously con-
 cerned" about a report he allegedly
 received from a Kenyan official that
 Secretary Kissinger advised Nairobi to
 withdraw from the East African Com-
 munity "so the US could give Kenya full
 military assistance."
 Amin is quoted as saying he cannot act
 as long as he serves as chairman of the
 Organization of African Unily but that he
 would "return to the barracks" when his
 term expires in July.
 Relations between Kenya and Uganda
 have been seriously strained in the last few
 months as a result of Amin's announced
 territorial claims against  Kenya,
 Nairobi's imposition of economic restric-
 tions on Kampala, and several cross-
 border forays by Uganda in early April.
 Although Amin has voiced measured
 approval of the Secretary's policy state-
 ment in Zambia this week, the Ugandan
 President has been generally critical of
 Kissinger's African trip. He apparently is
 angry that Kampala was not included in
 the itinerary; the US embassy in Kampala
 was closed in 1973.
 His anger was probably compounded
 by the Secretary's well-publicized visits
 with Kenyan President Kenyatta and
 Tanzanian President Nyerere, another
 neighbor with whom Amin has shay
 differences.

 The criticism of Teng Hsiao-ping has
 aroused widespread dissatisfaction and
 bitterness in China. This was evident in
 the party's higher echelons when Teng's
 staunchest supporters failed to join the
 rest of the leadership earlier this week at a
 reception denouncing the demonstrations
 in Peking of April 5.
 Some lower level officials in China and
 Chinese officials abroad have been willing
 to speak frankly about Chinese domestic
 politics with foreigners-a departure from
 attitudes that have prevailed for decades.
 Even more startling, a number of officials
 are willing to criticize Mao Tse-tung.
 From the beginning of the anti-Teng
 campaign, many Chinese have pointed a
 finger at Mao, calling him "selfish" and
 "senile." Since Teng's fall, criticism of
 Mao has increased. Chinese diplomats
 have spoken candidly of Mao's
 diminishing political influence, and one
 even suggested that Mao ought to step
 down. In January, after the initial move
 against Teng, criticism of the Chairman
 reportedly surfaced for the first time in
 the party central committee.
 There seems little doubt that Mao's
 political stock has fallen and that many
 Chinese blame Mao for the latest
 leadership upheaval. Current criticism of
 the Chairman seems greater than that
 which surfaced in the early 1960s and is
 different in that it is expressed openly,
 rather than indirectly as was the case in
 the 1960s.
 Since Teng was blocked from the
 premiership in early February, there has
 been widespread and sometimes out-
 spoken support for him and the policies he
 and the late Chou En-lai represented.
 Some of the discontent over his treatment
 abated in March, when the attacks on
 Teng seemed to have stalled, but it rose
 again rapidly after the demonstrations in
 Peking and Teng's subsequent dismissal.
 Teng may be more popular today than
 before the campaign against him began.
 Many Chinese have commented that the
 charges against him are false and that he
 is a ca able official who was treated un-
 fairly.

 The Prime Minister's Democrat Party

 political maneuvering earlier this year and
 his more recent manipulation of army of-
 ficer assignments just before he stepped
 down as defense minister.
 Seni and his foreign minister, Phichai
 Rattakun, hope to fashion a foreign
 policy that will include some balance in
 the Khukrit government's handling of the
 negotiations for a residual US presence
 and view continuation of US military aid
 as important to Thailand's security. They
 have indicated an interest in reopening the
 negotiations on one or two facilities
 currently scheduled for closure and have
 made it clear that they want to tie any
 possible new agreement to a guarantee of
 a significant increase in US military
 assistance.

 The Argentine military government is
 undertaking a sweeping program to raise
 farm income. It regards improvement in
 agriculture as the basis for long-term
 economic growth and as a source of
 foreign exchange to meet the country's
 huge financial obligations.
 The government has reversed a number
 of Peronist agricultural policies that kept
 returns to farmers low and discouraged
 agricultural investment. This has per-
 mitted the government to siphon off
 profits-through state grain- and meat-
 marketing  monopolies-and  subsidize
 food prices for urban workers.
 The new measures, some already in
 operation, raise farm prices and eliminate
 the government marketing monopolies.
 They also provide for more favorable
 foreign exchange rates on the proceeds
 from agricultural exports and will
 gradually reduce agricultural export tax-
 es. Although too late to influence the
 harvest this year, the new program will
 stimulate meat production and should
 lead to increased planting of crops next
 year, especially wheat and oilseeds.
 Marketing a larger grain harvest should
 be easy, but a higher beef output may be
 harder to sell. Loss of the EC market
 because of EC import restrictions was
 chiefly responsible for the $500-million
 drop in Argentine meat sales last year.
 Sales are recovering, however, along with
 economic recovery in the industrial
 nations.
 The new farm program will complicate
 the problem of reducing Argentina's large
 fiscal deficit.  Eliminating government
 marketing monopolies and  reducing
 agricultural export taxes will cut revenues
 sharply and force the government to seek
 other sources of income.

 The basic elements of Hanoi's postwar foreign policy are
 beginning to take shape. A unified Vietnam will insist on an in-
 fluential role for itself in Southeast Asia. It will seek help from
 France, Japan, and elsewhere in its effort to avoid unnecessary
 dependence on the USSR or China.
 (~ 4~~
 Vietnam: One Year Later
 The Vietnamese communists have held
 to a fairly low foreign policy profile in the
 year since their victory in the south. The
 other Southeast Asian nations, which had
 feared that Hanoi would adopt an
 aggressive posture toward the rest of the
 region, have become more relaxed in re-
 cent months.
 Although there are several insurgencies
 active in the region and Vietnam has am-
 ple arms to send them, every security ser-
 vice in the area is watching arms
 shipments closely and, so far, not a single
 report of shipments from Vietnam has
 been verified.
 There seem to be three principal
 reasons for Hanoi's restrained foreign
 policy behavior during the past year:
 ? It is giving first priority to putting
 its own house in order.
 ? Its foreign policy objectives just
 now are limited.
 ? It is working out a basically new,
 long-term foreign policy.
 Domestic Priorities First
 Hanoi's first priority is to consolidate
 its control of the south. The communists
 are aware of the widespread opposition to
 their take-over in the south and are deter-
 mined to reindoctrinate or eliminate all
 Vietnamese who have opposed them.
 In the field of economic reform, party
 leaders are proceeding !it a deliberate
 pace. Their pragmatic approach appears
 aimed at avoiding the kind of powerful
 anti-regime reaction that occurred in the
 north in 1956 against forced collectiviza-
 tion of agriculture.
 The regime gradually took control of
 banking and currency, large enterprises,
 foreign trade, and the vital wholesale rice
 transport system. Last fall Hanoi
 prescribed a mixed economy for the south
 ranging from state-owned major enter-
 prises to privately owned small
 businesses. The bulk of rice production in
 the south is still in the hands of small
 private  farmers.  Collectivization  of
 agriculture has taken place only in areas
 long held by the communists and in "new
 economic areas" settled by urban
 emigrants.
 Hanoi is aware that harsh measures to
 merge two disparate economic and social
 systems would not only have highly dis-
 ruptive effects in the south but would ex-
 ceed the party's administrative capacities.
 Party leaders, therefore, apparently are
 prepared to tolerate major north-south
 differences in economic organization for
 some years.
 Hanoi's objective is to free itself of
 dependence on Soviet and Chinese aid,
 with the help of France, Japan, and
 others.
 Immediate Objectives Limited
 For Hanoi, the victory of the Viet-
 namese communists was a turning point
 in the history of Southeast Asia, and
 Hanoi's foreign policy is based on its
 perception of that victory and its im-
 plications. The Vietnamese communist
 leadership doubtless believes that, at a
 minimum, the new Vietnam deserves un-
 questioning respect from Laos and Cam-
 bodia as the pre-eminent power in In-
 dochina. Beyond Indochina, the Viet-
 namese clearly feel they are entitled to
 respectful cooperation from the other
 nations of Southeast Asia, particularly
 from Thailand.
 Vietnam's main foreign policy effort in
 Southeast Asia has been to press Thailand
 to rid itself of US bases and to discredit
 the Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations as a US-backed alliance that in-
 vites great power intervention in the area.
 The Vietnamese clearly are thinking
 ahead to a time when they may take a
 leading role in the region.
 Hanoi has given a high priority to
 bringing Thailand to terms, since the Thai
 were the most conspicuous Southeast
 Asian ally of the US in the fight to pre-
 vent a communist take-over in South
 Vietnam.
 Vietnam's outspoken attacks on the
 Thai-US connection, together with the
 shifting balance of forces in Southeast
 Asia, undoubtedly helped to bring home
 to the Thai that it was time to put their
 foreign policy on a new footing. The Thai
 were also motivated by their own sense of
 nationalism, and by election campaign
 politics, when they decided recently that
 the remaining US presence must be
 withdrawn. Whatever the immediate
 cause for the US withdrawal, Hanoi
 clearly welcomes it, and it has been
 muting its tirades against Bangkok in the

 Le Duan during talks last October with Soviet General Secretary Brezhnev
 hope that the new Thai government will
 continue to put more distance between
 itself and the US.
 Hanoi's strong condemnation of
 ASEAN when the organization held its
 summit meeting in Bali in February caus-
 ed more bewilderment and resentment
 than  fear  in  the  five  ASEAN
 capitals-Bangkok,  Manila, Jakarta,
 Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. The Viet-
 namese clearly regard ASEAN as a relic
 of the anticommunist war effort. Their
 early interest in developing relations with
 Thailand and the Philippines and their re-
 cent overture to Indonesia, however,
 suggest that hostility toward ASEAN will
 not deter Hanoi from developing better
 relations with the five member states.
 Independence in the Communist World
 North Vietnam was dependent on
 Chinese and Soviet support throughout
 the war years but even so managed to play
 the two communist powers off against
 each other.
 Now, as Vietnam seeks to end the
 relative isolation of the war years, the
 balance has tilted toward Moscow. The
 basic relationship with Peking is one of
 limited tension; Moscow now provides
 substantially greater  political  and
 material support.
 Underlying the tension between China
 and  Vietnam  is  a    conflict    in
 national-ethnic-cultural pride. China's
 sense of superiority has for more than
 2,000 years caused the Chinese to expect
 all other peoples to come to them. As
 SOV Fr-t'
 Western power recedes from Southeast
 Asia, Peking inevitably thinks it should
 exercise the most important foreign in-
 fluence in the region.
 The peoples who migrated south from
 China and became Vietnamese many cen-
 turies ago brought with them a similar
 ethnic-cultural arrogance. Today, in the
 wake of their victory, the men who make
 Vietnamese communist policy believe that
 Vietnam should wield the most important
 influence over the countries of Southeast
 Asia.
 Hanoi, moreover, is earning Peking's
 distrust because of its good relations with
 Moscow. Peking can hardly welcome the
 prospect of Vietnam taking a leadership
 role in Southeast Asia if Vietnam and the
 USSR seem to be working closely
 together there.
 The conflict and distrust between Viet-
 nam and China can be seen all around
 Vietnam.
 To the east, in the South China Sea, the
 two governments assert conflicting claims
 to the Paracel and Spratly islands. China
 made a special point of underscoring these
 conflicting claims in its propaganda on
 the eve of a visit to Peking last September
 by party chief Le Duan. Each government
 is deeply offended by the presumption of
 the other.
 In Cambodia, within weeksof the fall of
 Phnom Penh, clashes erupted between
 communist forces of Vietnam and Cam-
 bodia along disputed sections of the
 border, Vietnamese forces captured some
 disputed islands in the Gulf of Thailand
 from the Cambodians, and the new rulers
 of Cambodia asked the Vietnamese com-
 munists to get out of their long-establish-
 ed base areas in Cambodian territory.
 During this somewhat tense period,
 scores of Chinese suddenly began appear-
 ing in Cambodia. The Chinese, the only
 substantial foreign group there, were
 presumably sent to provide practical
 assistance of various kinds to the new
 government, but their presence was and
 remains most important as proof of
 Peking's support to the Cambodians.
 Today Hanoi has representation in
 Phnom Penh, but there are few hints of
 any sort of a cooperative relationship. The
 Cambodians, with direct encouragement
 from the Chinese, have taken steps to im-
 prove their relations with the Thai, a
 policy at odds with Hanoi's firm position
 that Thailand must expel the remaining
 US military presence before any improve-
 ment can be made in relations with
 Thailand.
 In Thailand, a Chinese connection has
 also helped Bangkok stand up to Hanoi.
 After the fall of Saigon, Hanoi, confident
 that the Thai would quickly come to
 terms, demanded that the aircraft and
 ships taken to Thailand in the last days of
 the war be turned over to the victors.
 The Thai refused with some apprehen-
 sion, but after Prime Minister Khukrit
 returned from Peking  he was clearly
 more relaxed about Vietnamese demands,
 and Hanoi drew the obvious conclusion:
 the Chinese had encouraged Khukrit to
 stand up to Vietnamese pressures.
 In Laos, too, there is an adversary
 relationship between the Vietnamese and
 Chinese. The Chinese have a large
 presence in northern Laos, where they are
 building roads connecting to China. In
 general, however, the Lao-with Viet-
 namese support-are holding the Chinese
 at arm's length.
 North Vietnamese forces did most of
 the fighting on the communist side in
 Laos during the last two decades, and the
 North Vietnamese provided the Lao com-
 munist leadership its indoctrination and
 training. This history and the strength of

 Vietnamese communist units still in Laos
 give Hanoi a major voice in Lao com-
 munist decisions.
 It was doubtless with the encourage-
 ment and assistance of the Vietnamese
 that the Lao invited several hundred
 Soviet technicians to Laos last year. Pek-
 ing presumably regards the introduction
 of this Soviet presence into Laos as con-
 firmation of its darker suspicions of
 Hanoi's position in the Sino-Soviet com-
 petition.
 Prospects
 With the formal completion of the un-
 ification process in the next month or so,
 the Vietnamese probably will adopt a
 more active foreign policy. They will in-
 sist on an influential voice in Southeast
 Asian affairs and will work to expand
 political and economic contacts with the
 noncommunist world to reduce their
 dependence on the USSR and China.
 In their relations with Thailand and
 other neighboring countries, the Viet-
 namese will probably continue to subor-
 dinate revolutionary rhetoric to appeals
 for cooperative relations.  Hanoi,
 however, will continue to insist that
 friendly relations cannot be achieved as
 long as US military personnel and bases
 are allowed to remain in these countries.
 The Vietnamese almost certainly will
 attempt to influence their neighbors, par-
 ticularly Thailand, by keeping open the
 option of increasing support to local
 "revolutionary movements."
 Hanoi's priority domestic goals,
 however, will impose sharp restraints on
 its ability to pursue expansionist policies
 or to translate military prestige into effec-
 tive political influence in Southeast Asia.
 At least for the next few years, Vietnam
 will need to import about $1.3 billion an-
 nually in industrial machinery, raw
 materials, fuels and food, and it will re-
 quire foreign assistance to cover an an-
 nual trade deficit of about $1 billion.
 These urgent economic requirements
 will oblige the Vietnamese to maintain
 heavy reliance on the USSR, Eastern
 Europe, and China, who for now appear
 willing to foot most of the bill. Hanoi,
 however,  is also seeking financial
 assistance from the noncommunist world
 and is expanding commercial relations
 with developed countries. The Vietnamese
 leaders are well aware that a policy of
 confrontation with their neighbors would
 jeopardize their prospects for securing ad-
 ditional foreign assistance.
 Hanoi's long-term  political  and
 economic  interests  probably will en-
 courage it to hold the door open for an
 eventual normalization of relations with
 the US. The Vietnamese, however, are
 determined to drive a hard bargain. They
 will continue to make the provision of
 further information on Americans miss-
 ing in action, the  repatriation of
 American bodies, and the release of US
 citizens remaining in Vietnam contingent
 on US willingness to provide reconstruc-
 tion assistance and to relax the US em-
 bargo on trade.
 The Vietnamese have long insisted that
 the US must honor the "commitment" to
 provide aid to "heal the wounds of war"
 under the Paris Agreement of 1973, but25X1
 they privately acknowledge they do not
 expect US aid or a normalization of
 The Latin Americans' sense of their place in the world has
 been changing in recent years. Most of them, however, still
 accept a strong US role in the hemisphere and would respond
 positively to US initiatives for a more productive relationship.
 Latin American Perceptions of the US
 The search for national identity in
 Latin American countries has produced
 profound changes in the region over the
 past 15 years, changes which have been
 dictated by and at the same time fuel
 nationalist sentiment. Finding their own
 grievances  and  aspirations  echoed
 throughout the underdeveloped world, the
 Latin Americans in the last three years
 have become more conscious of the rest of
 the world and have developed a new,
 sharper perception of their own place in it.
 Their self-image and their definition of
 self-interest have altered, yet their fun-
 damental view of the US remains almost
 the same.
 The Latin Americans believe that the
 US possesses the power and wealth to
 help or to hurt the rest of the hemisphere.
 Their assessment of the US treatment of
 Latin America over the past few years is
 that Washington's interest in the area has
 waned. In their view, the US has
 repeatedly failed to deliver on promises
 and has put new obstacles in their path to
 economic development. Distrust of the
 US has grown measurably.
 The Latin Americans have accused the
 US of preoccupation with other areas,
 protectionism in commerce, punitive
 legislation, threats of retaliation for dis-
 agreement on international issues, and
 failures to reciprocate favors. They think
 the US has unilaterally changed the rules
 of hemispheric relations to their detri-
 ment, and they find the US unwilling to
 change international arrangements that
 they have come to perceive as serving only
 an exclusive club of wealthy nations. They
 believe the US is misjudging its own in-

 terests by turning its back on Latin
 America.
 Most seem to expect the divergence
 between the US and Latin America to be
 temporary, and it is clear that many want
 a more productive relationship. For now,
 however, the Latin Americans believe
 their most promising course is to maintain
 pressure on the US,  wherever and
 however they can. Pursuing this course,
 they judge the impact of US actions on
 the hemisphere from a highly critical
 perspective,
 Reactions to US Leadership
 Common interests and ideology link
 groups of Latin American countries on
 certain issues, but it has become difficult
 to predict which countries will line up for
 or against the US on a particular issue.
 The Latin Americans are now responsive
 to a larger and more complex set of issues,
 countries, and blocs than they were a
 decade ago. They have come to devalue
 the importance of backing the US, which
 they find inconsistent in rewarding its
 friends or punishing its foes.
 Political ideology works to keep certain
 governments allied unless some compel-
 ling practicality intrudes. Strongly anti-
 communist governments like those of
 Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Nicaragua,
 and Brazil worry about East-West an-
 tagonisms and the Marxist menace, and
 they tend to vote alike on such matters as
 the Cuban question. In contrast, the leftist
 ideologues-Peru,  Guyana,  and
 Jamaica-tilt somewhat toward a Cuban
 view of the capitalist world.
 On international issues of significance
 to the US, Latin American support has
 steadily waned. Voting on those issues
 that test the drawing power of two
 sides-the "Zionism is racism" vote in
 the UN is an example-divides the Latin
 Americans according to no traditional
 pattern.
 Many issues and developments,
 however, draw remarkably similar reac-
 tions  from  all  Latin  American
 governments. An examination of Latin
 American perspectives on several recent
 problems shows that Latin Americans
 hold tenaciously to the view that their
 area holds a special, if neglected, interest
 for the US.
 US Problems
 Latin Americans unanimously judged
 the outcome of the long struggle in In-
 dochina to be a major defeat for US
 policy. But almost all viewed the defeat as
 an aberration. Most Latin Americans
 were never able to comprehend the US ex-
 penditure of human and material
 resources on a large scale in that remote
 area. The strongly anti-communist
 minority wondered why the US drew back
 from using the full weight of its military
 strength.
 The Indochina issue had almost no
 effect on the Latin American sense of the
 US security commitment in the
 hemisphere.
 The experience has, however, affected
 the image of US strength, resolve, and
 judgment in the role of leader of the
 Western world. Many Latin Americans
 have had an exaggerated impression of
 US power, and their new appreciation for
 the limits of that power probably gives
 them a more realistic base for assessing
 US action.
 US and Cuban responses to Angola
 brought more serious doubts about US
 will. Another communist victory, this
 time after a significant contribution from
 Havana, raised sharper questions about
 US reliability and judgment. The anti-
 communist governments that refused a
 year ago to vote with the majority on lift-
 ing OAS sanctions against Cuba feel
 smug about having trusted their own in-
 stincts rather than voting with the US.
 These same governments are nervous,
 however, and feel vulnerable. They fear
 that a predatory USSR and Cuba are
 continuing on an aggressive path and that
 the US is not resisting the communist
 drive. Their bewilderment over US
 "generosity" toward the Soviets leads
 them to conclude that the US has been
 fooled by the notion of relaxing tensions
 between East and West.
 Another set of countries, especially in
 the Caribbean, believes Washington was
 aligned on the same side as South Africa
 in the Angolan civil war, and that this is
 further evidence of US hostility toward
 the Third World and black liberation.
 Most Latin Americans are convinced
 that the US would react strongly to resist
 any communist threats to the Western
 Hemisphere. It would be difficult to find a
 politically conscious Latin American who
 does not believe that the US was responsi-
 ble for the overthrow of the Allende
 regime in Chile. Whether they take com-
 fort in it or deplore it, most continue to
 believe that the US will act pater-
 nalistically in its own sphereof influence.
 Their confidence in US protection has
 diminished, but not significantly.
 Diffusion of Authority in the US
 The role of the US Congress in limiting
 US action in Angola helped jell the ran-
 dom clues available to Latin American
 observers about the real autonomy of the
 branches of power in the US, and this new
 appreciation worries them. Latin
 Americans have been fascinated by
 Watergate, the intelligence investigations,
 and the foreign policy debates, though
 they remain baffled by much of this.
 The internal divisions in the US
 translate for many Latin Americans as
 national disarray. They are accustomed to
 a near monopoly of executive power and
 are uneasy about Congress' successful
 challenges of the US presidency.
 The Big Stick
 US internal divisions and problems
 overseas would mean little in Latin
 America if the hemispheric relationship
 were prospering. But there is growing opin-
 ion that the US has moved into a hostile
 position toward Latin American develop-
 ment.
 References to a new big stick policy
 have multiplied in the year and a half
 since the signing of the trade act-with its
 "retaliatory provisions" against OPEC
 members Ecuador and Venezuela. The
 Latin Americans say they see threats and
 intimidation in US arguments and warn-
 ings at the UN and other international
 forums, in US official reactions to
 national voting patterns in these forums,
 and in the US accordance of special con-
 sideration for the other giant of the
 hemisphere, Brazil.

 Increasingly, the Latin Americans
 believe the "hard-line" positions they see
 in US policy and disbelieve the "rhetoric"
 of cooperation. Latin American bitterness
 has grown as the relationship has turned
 more clearly on a series of differences on
 trade, investment, and military support.
 Even so, the Latin Americans displayed
 a willingness to work with the US to make
 a new start toward a productive
 relationship.  They  responded
 enthusiastically in 1974 to the offer of a
 new dialogue. The derailment of that ef-
 fort badly embarrassed the foreign
 ministers who had most effusively backed
 it and left new wounds that have not yet
 fully healed.
 The cautious and skeptical reception
 given Secretary Kissinger by political
 pundits during his visit to Latin America
 this year indicates that the Latins intend
 to keep their guard up. They seem to be
 awaiting strong evidence of interest and
 sympathy from the US before they take
 its pledges at face value.
 Solidarity and Relations with the US
 The ideal of Latin American unity,
 which arises from several sources, works
 sometimes to nurture and sometimes to
 damage relations with the US. The
 traditional version of pan-American
 solidarity continues to be the preferred
 option for most of the governments even
 though much in the recent history of the
 Organization of American States testifies
 to the perversion of that tradition. Despite
 the recurrent use of inter-American
 forums as arenas for political gang action
 against the  US, however, pan-
 Americanism retains a durable core.
 The Latin Americans feel less and less
 compunction about giving offense to the
 US; indeed, several governments nurture
 their own sense of independence by op-
 posing or challenging the US on many
 issues. Yet it remains dogma that when
 the chips are down on issues of survival,
 they must inexorably line up with the US.
 With only a few exceptions, the Latin
 American governments want a cordial
 and cooperative link with the US and
 hope that changed attitudes in the US will
 eventually make Washington more sym-
 pathetically inclined toward them.
 A Special Relationship
 The notion of the Western Hemisphere
 as a sphere of US interest is so ingrained
 in Latin American thinking about the US
 that it amounts to an inter-American doc-
 trine with a life of its own. The concept of
 South Africa's program for Namibia-the development of
 separate. autonomous "homelands" for the territory's nine
 tribal groups while preserving Pretoria's economic interests
 there faces serious challenges from within as well as outside
 Namibia.
 a special relationship is very much alive
 even in the current climate of skepticism
 and discouragement with US policy.
 Latin American attitudes toward the US
 have traditionally been marked by am-
 bivalence, and they remain equivocal. The
 current accent is on resentment rather
 than respect, and resentment will remain
 in the mix of the Latin Americans'
 perspectives so long as their sense of
 dependence on the US prevails.
 Despite their strong desire for in-
 dependence and notwithstanding the value
 they place on having found new political
 and economic partners throughout the in-
 ternational community, the Latin
 Americans still consider close alignment
 with "their superpower" as natural. The
 current "unnatural" state of the
 relationship alarms them sufficiently that
 their characterization of it as a crisis is
 not hyperbole to them.
 Most Latin American governments are
 ready and even anxious to respond
 favorably to US policies that meet their
 needs but preserve their pride in the in-
 evitably assymetrical relationship
 between the US and  relativelv  werless
 Latin America.

 Namibia: Pretoria's Control to Be Tested
 Recent  developments  in  southern
 Africa augur a hard testing of South
 Africa's scheme for yielding formal con-
 trol of Namibia (South-West Africa)
 while  preserving Pretoria's important
 economic and strategic interests.
 South Africa's military intervention in
 the recent Angolan civil war-using
 northern Namibia as a staging area-has
 sharply intensified black African opposi-
 tion to South African control of Nami-
 bia, a one-time German colony man-
 dated to Pretoria by the League of
 Nations in 1920.

 Pretoria remains concerned about
 Neto's declared backing for the Namibian
 insurgents who are trying to extend their
 guerrilla forays from southern Angola.
 Last week a band of terrorists ambushed a
 small South African force on patrol in
 northern Namibia near the Angolan
 border.
 Actual  support  for cross-border
 operations, however, will probably be
 tempered by the Angolans' economic
 needs as well as their fear of reprisal from
 the South African forces poised along the
 Namibian side of the border.
 Pan-African and communist support
 for Namibian insurgency is likely to build,
 however, as the South Africans try to
 maintain their present advantages in the
 territory.
 The UN Position
 Namibia has long been an object of
 sterile contention between South Africa
 and the United Nations, which from its
 earliest days has differed with Pretoria
 over South Africa's obligations regarding
 the territory.
 In 1966, the UN General Assembly
 voted to terminate the South African
 mandate and to assume direct respon-
 sibility for the territory. Subsequently, the
 General Assembly renamed the territory
 Namibia (after the Namib Desert), es-
 tablished a UN Council for Namibia to
 prepare the inhabitants for independence,
 and repeatedly demanded that Pretoria
 relinquish control to the council.
 Pretoria, for its part, has acknowledged
 the special international status of the
 territory but rebuffed all UN assertions of
 control. In practice, the South Africans
 have administered the territory virtually
 as a province.
 South Africans regard Namibia as a
 substantial economic asset as well as a
 buffer shielding South Africa from poten-
 tial enemies to the north. By 1966, when
 Pretoria ceased publishing separate trade
 statistics for Namibia, South Africa was
 deriving some $250 million in foreign ex-
 change earnings from the territory's
 mineral, fish, and agricultural exports.
 South African private investment in the
 territory amounts to at least $550 million,
 and South Africans own some 70 percent
 of the important mining industry.
 Although diamonds are the principal
 product, the territory also exports signifi-
 cant quantities of uranium, copper, lead,
 zinc, and tin. Its uranium resources, still
 being explored, are extensive.
 Separate Development in Namibia
 The population of Namibia-roughly
 900,000-contains  white  and  mulatto
 settler groups and nine indigenous tribes
 that vary widely in numbers, cultural
 characteristics,  and  capabilities for
 autonomous existence.
 Since the mid-1960s, Pretoria has
 systematically extended to Namibia the
 policy of ethnic "separate development"
 that the ruling National Party previously
 adopted in South Africa proper. The
 demarcation of separate geographic sec-
 tors for most of the ethnic groups, as well
 as the fostering of more or less
 autonomous governmental units for each
 group, has tended to maintain not only
 the traditional cultural divisions but also
 the extreme disparities in economic con-
 ditions.
 Although the whites make up only
 about 12 percent of the population, the
 area of Namibia that is reserved for them
 includes much of the better grazing land
 as well as most of the known mineral
 deposits. On the other hand, Ovam-
 boland, the area along the Angola border
 allotted to the Ovambo tribe, which in-
 cludes almost half of the territory's pop-
 ulation, is more fertile than most of the
 tribal homelands, but is inadequate for
 the expanding Ovambo population.
 Some of the smaller nomadic tribes
 have been restricted to "homelands" that
 are virtually barren. Consequently, the in-
 digenous tribesmen have tended to work
 in the mines, where the contract labor
 system keeps them in the lowest paid jobs.
 The Insurgents
 Among Namibians, the most articulate
 opposition to separate development has
 come from the South-West African
 People's Organization. This predominant-
 ly Ovambo group wants Namibian in-
 dependence under a unified, popularly
 elected government. South African ad-
 ministrators have countered SWAPO's
 activities with suppressive tactics short of
 outright banning, and the group's most
 prominent leaders have been in exile for
 years.
 Largely as a result of its persistent in-
 ternational lobbying, SWAPO is the only
 Nambian nationalist group recognized by
 the UN or the Organization of African
 Unity. In 1973, its youth wing organized a
 highly effective boycott of the election for
 the Ovamboland Legislative Council-the
 first popular election held in Namibia. To
 offset the fiasco,  South African ad-
 ministrators held a new election in Ovam-
 boland in January 1975 in which they
 achieved a 55-percent turnout of eligible
 voters.
 The exiled SWAPO leaders have ad-
 vocated violent revolt against the South
 African administration and maintained a
 small guerrilla force in Zambia. SWAPO
 has apparently never had more than a few
 hundred active guerrillas or carried out
 more than small-scale raids inside
 Namibia. Nor does it seem likely that the
 surge of SWAPO influence in Ovam-
 boland during 1973 is attributable to the
 exiled leaders; their ties with the leaders of
 the youth wing appear tenuous.
 Little Foreign Help
 Foreign backing for SWAPO, aside
 from rhetoric, has been limited

 officials have been worried that the new
 situation in Angola might lead to a sharp
 increase  in  SWAPO  insurgent
 capabilities. Several recent developments
 suggest that SWAPO insurgency is indeed
 assuming new importance.
 Since mid-1974, when Portuguese
 border  patrols ceased apprehending
 refugees from Namibia, at least 3,000
 Ovambos have fled through southern
 Angola to Zambia, where they now live in
 refugee camps. There is no indication that
 significant numbers of the refugees have
 joined the SWAPO guerrillas, but a large
 portion are youths who would be likely
 recruits in the event that foreign backing
 for a SWAPO buildup materialized.
 At least some of the SWAPO guerrillas
 who were based in Zambia are now in
 southern  Angola.  South  African
 authorities have blamed SWAPO in-
 truders for a series of small-scale terrorist
 attacks in northern Namibia since last
 September, including the killings of an
 Ovambo chief and several whites. Most of
 the attacks clearly were carried out by
 well-trained guerrillas who managed to
 get through the newly reinforced border
 defense.
 Constitutional Conference
 By mid-1974, the South African
 government had apparently reached a
 decision to revise its strategy for
 Namibia. In September of that year,
 leaders of the white settlers in Namibia, at
 Prime Minister Vorster's behest, called
 for multiracial talks on the future of the
 territory and urged each of the non-white
 ethnic groups to choose truly represen-
 tative spokesmen for the talks.
 In May 1975, the South African foreign
 minister informed the UN secretary
 general that the delegates would be free to
 choose any form of government for
 Namibia-including independence for the
 whole territory as a unified state.
 The delegates were ultimately chosen
 indirectly by the existing legislative or ad-
 visory bodies of each ethnic group, and a
 large portion are old-line tribal leaders
 who usually have gone along with South
 African tutelage.
 a body will endorse Pretoria's apparent
 goal of a loose federal system that would
 maintain white control of the territory's
 principal resources. Until recently most
 spokesmen for the smaller tribes have ex-
 pressed fears that a unified, popularly
 elected government would be dominated
 by the Ovambos.
 Three-Year Target
 When the conference convened last
 September, it adopted a declaration of in-
 tent that set a three-year target for devis-
 ing a constitution that is to guarantee
 every ethnic group considerable say in its
 own affairs.
 The non-white delegates have shown
 more solidarity than the South Africans
 anticipated-possibly as a result of work-
 ing together in inter-ethnic committees
 that were set up in November to consider
 various social and economic measures.
 Last month a brief plenary session
 adopted resolutions calling for equal
 educational opportunities for all ethnic
 groups and equal pay for equal work.
 The session also set up a drafting com-
 mittee whose members appear to be a
 fairly even mix of delegates who want a
 loose federal system and those favoring a
 unitary state.
 The trend of sentiment toward a uni-
 tary state may be attributable to a caucus
 of delegates from the smaller indigenous
 tribes and the mulatto groups. These
 delegates are considering constitutional
 devices that they believe would offset the
 numerical superiority of the Ovambos by
 fostering solidarity among, the smaller
 non-white groups.
 The caucus is also advocating that
 various non-white political par-
 ties-including SWAPO-be represented
 in future sessions of the conference. Such
 proposals may be pushed to a vote at the
 next plenary session in June. Vorster may
 then have to decide whether to accept
 revisions of his scenario that would be un-
 palatable to the white settlers-mostly
 South African citizens-or to forfeit what
 may be a last opportunity to gain non-
 white support for a peaceable phasing out
 of the South African administration.

 The informal alliance of Arabs and black Africans was
 highlighted last week with the conference of more than 50 Arab
 and African foreign ministers. Both sides see advantages in the
 relationship, but there are some strains, and the Arabs cannot
 count on automatic African support for their initiatives.
 -Y&
 African-Arab Cooperation
 The conference of Arab and African
 foreign ministers in Dakar, Senegal, last
 week brought together for the first time
 the overlapping memberships of the Arab
 League and the Organization of African
 Unity. The meeting was an outgrowth of
 the new cooperative relationship between
 black Africa and the Arab world that
 crystallized during and after the Middle
 East war in 1973.
 Israel's diplomatic presence south of
 the Sahara was all but erased at that time
 as black African states severed ties with
 Tel Aviv in a display of solidarity with the
 Arabs.
 The Afro-Arab relationship rests on a
 trade-off of support on Middle East and
 southern African issues at the UN and
 other international gatherings and on a
 common interest in restructuring the
 world economic order for the benefit of
 the developing countries. Cooperation
 gives both groups a stronger hand in
 third-world politics and gives the Third
 World greater cohesion and hence greater
 strength in international forums.
 The relationship shows some signs of
 fraying. The Africans feel they have not
 received adequate economic compensa-
 tion for the support they have given the
 Arab cause since 1973. This sense of being
 let down, coupled with often heavy-hand-
 ed Arab efforts further to expand their in-
 fluence on the continent, has stirred grow-
 ing resentment and complaints, especially
 among those African states that were the
 most reluctant to sever ties with Israel.
 Even in the best of circumstances, the
 Afro-Arab relationship is complicated by
 strong anti-Arab feeling in many parts of
 black Africa. The feeling stems from
 memories of Arab slave traders and the
 only thinly veiled racism of many modern
 Arabs.
 Despite their frustration, many
 Africans concede their long-term interest
 lies in continued cooperation since only
 the Arab oil producers can offer them the
 hope of substantial aid for development
 and relief from the oil price squeeze. So
 far, Arab aid is estimated to have offset
 less than one fourth of the increased cost
 of oil imports to nonproducing OAU
 members.
 The foreign ministers' conference was
 proposed some time ago by Arab leaders
 in an effort to initiate a new dialogue with
 the Africans aimed at bolstering coopera-
 tion. A total of 57 foreign ministers
 attended the conference. Only Guinea and
 Angola were absent because of their
 political differences with Senegal.
 Few details of the four-day closed
 meeting are yet available, but differences
 apparently prevented publication of a
 final communique. The conferees did
 agree on a draft charter outlining a
 program of action for future Afro-Arab
 cooperation.
 The delegates failed to arrange the
 Afro-Arab summit that will be required to
 ratify the charter, leaving this matter to
 be worked out by the secretariats of the
 Arab League and the OAU. It appears
 that a summit will not convene before ear-
 ly next year.
 The compromise
 version is said to parallel closely one
 originally offered by the OAU. It calls for
 mutual respect for sovereignty, for in-
 stitutional links between the OAU and
 Arab League, and for expanded political,
 cultural, and, particularly, economic
 cooperation.
 Africans have unrealistic hopes that the
 charter will commit the Arab side to un-
 dertake more generous aid and invest-
 ment programs in black Africa in return
 for stronger African support for the Arab
 cause in the Middle East.
 Arab Aid Institutions
 Apparently the Arabs made no new
 financial commitments at the Dakar
 meeting nor was there formal discussion
 of the three aid institutions established
 under Arab League auspices after the Oc-
 tober 1973 war:
 ? A $200-million revolving fund
 that provides long-term, easy credit
 loans to help African countries pay
 their increased oil import bills.
 ? A  Khartoum-based bank for
 African development that makes non-
 concessional loans; it is capitalized at
 less than half its projected level of $500
 million.

 The meeting apparently avoided formal
 discussion of current Middle East and
 southern African political issues. The
 Arab conferees did make a token response
 to a request from Mozambique for special
 assistance to help compensate the Machel
 government  for its  application  of
 economic sanctions against Rhodesia.
 Mozambique was provided a $6-million,
 low-interest loan from the Arabs' revolv-
 ing oil-loan fund.
 Cracks in Afro-Arab solidarity have
 put the Arabs on notice not to expect
 automatic African support for their in-
 itiatives, particularly for those involving
 Israel. Arab militants did not try this time
 to drum up support for excluding Israel
 from the UN.

 UNCTAD: Fourth Session to Convene
 The atmosphere generated at the 4th
 UN Conference on Trade and Develop-
 ment in Nairobi from May 5 to 28 will be
 more important than any specific
 decisions the conference may reach.
 Many of the developing states have ex-
 plicitly linked the acceptance of their
 demands to the future of negotiations in
 other forums. Despite this linkage, the
 developing states are not likely to break
 off the talks at the Paris Conference on
 International Economic Cooperation un-
 der any but the most negative cir-
 cumstances. The developing countries'
 spirit of accommodation at Paris, in the
 UN, and at the GATT multilateral trade
 negotiations will be affected, however, by
 the outcome of the Nairobi conference.
 Some observ r
 that Nairobi will degenerate into a
 propaganda attack against the in-
 dustrialized states. On balance, however,
 the session will probably maintain the
 generally conciliatory tone set at last fall's
 UN special session. Their limited
 bargaining strength, and the concern of
 many developing states that an un-
 successful conference could threaten their
 future unity, will probably lead the
 developing states grudgingly to accept
 even  limited  progress  at  UNCTAD.
 Unresolved issues would then be taken up
 in other, more limited forums, even
 though the developing states prefer the
 North-South dialogue in UN bodies where
 they have the advantage of numbers.
 Preparations by Developing States
 For most developing countries,
 UNCTAD  represents the  near-term
 culmination of their efforts to achieve
 economic  independence  that  began
 with decolonization and were in-
 stitutionalized in the first UNCTAD con-
 ference in 1964. Most of these states
 believe the industrialized countries began
 to take their demands seriously only after
 effects of the OPEC oil embargo were felt
 in 1974.
 The developing countries are divided by
 regional, political, economic, and racial
 factors, but all of them largely share a
 conviction that low levels of development
 are due to past exploitation and can be
 overcome only by persistent opposition to
 efforts of the industrialized states to
 perpetuate discriminatory trade and
 financial structures. This view, codified in
 a series of demands for a "new inter-
 national economic order," found expres-
 sion most recently in the documents of the
 Group of 77 ministerial meeting in

 Manila last January. The Group of 77 is
 composed of the 110 developing states
 that are members of the UN.
 Most developing states recognize that
 their unity in economic negotiations
 remains their major bargaining strength;
 they will go to considerable lengths to
 maintain that unity. Weaknesses in the
 facade, however, are evident in private
 caucuses such as the Manila meeting.
 The most contentious issue for the
 developing countries in Manila was about
 commodities-specifically over the
 proposal to create an "integrated
 program." This program, developed by
 the UNCTAD secretariat, remains the
 cornerstone of developing country policy
 for the Nairobi meetings and will be the
 main bone of contention with the in-
 dustrialized states.
 The program addresses the assertion
 that developing states cannot plan their
 development because revenues from their
 exports of raw materials are uncertain.
 The integrated program calls for a $3-
 billion common fund-primarily to come
 from industrialized states-to help sup-
 port prices for 18 different raw materials
 through the use of buffer stocks. The
 program also calls for an expansion of ex-
 isting mechanisms that provide compen-
 sation to developing states whose earnings
 from exports of raw materials decline.
 The splits at Manila were largely along
 regional lines-primarily between
 Africans and Latin Americans. Argument
 focused on differences over which
 products should be covered by the in-
 tegrated program and over the preferred
 access some developing states now enjoy
 in developed country markets. The Latin
 Americans believed the list of com-
 modities covered items only of interest to
 African states; they also opposed a
 proposal to cancel existing commodity
 agreements because this would call into
 question a separate commodity pact for
 coffee.  .
 African states opposed a call for univer-
 sal nondiscrimination in trade because
 they do not want to give up the preferen-
 tial treatment granted them by the Euro-
 pean Community under the Lome agree-
 ment. The Latin Americans argued with
 some justification that such treatment
 creates special-interest blocs among the
 developing states.
 Another point of contention among the
 developing states will be important in the
 discussions in Nairobi-the issue of debt
 burdens. Some developing states, primari-
 ly African and Asian, have been support-
 ing a call for an international conference
 to consider a debt moratorium or a broad
 rescheduling of repayments. These states
 are opposed by the Latin Americans who
 fear their own relatively favorable credit
 standing would be jeopardized in such a
 move. The Group of 77 did agree to call
 for special measures to aid the poorest
 developing states, which face especially
 heavy debt burdens.
 The developing states are likely at
 Nairobi to press for restructuring
 UNCTAD to increase its influence in the
 UN system. The developing states would
 like to see UNCTAD become the primary
 forum for economic talks between in-
 dustrialized and developing states. The
 developing states recognize, however, that
 trying to make UNCTAD a specialized
 agency of the UN-rather than letting it
 remain an organ of the General
 Assembly-could diminish rather than in-
 crease the conference's value to them.
 Industrialized States
 The industrialized states have, in large
 part, been reacting to policies advocated
 by the developing countries rather than
 presenting their own program and have
 had less success in forging even the
 appearance of a common policy. Most of
 these states recognize the need for some
 compromise in order to maintain the
 dialogue but are unwilling to agree to
 potentially expensive, open-ended
 agreements.
 Japan, as well as the members of the
 EC, who have yet to agree on a common
 policy among themselves, have been look-
 ing for US initiatives at Nairobi. At the
 same time, they are concerned that the
 US may again appear to be leading the in-
 dustrialized countries, as it did during the
 special  session of the UN General
 Assembly last September. At that session
 both the Europeans and the Japanese
 resented the appearance of being
 followers rather than fully consulted
 partners.
 Most EC members might go along with
 US proposals they believe the developing
 states would consider favorably. The EC
 Nine are anxious that the Community
 itself earn credit among the developing
 states, and the Nine might agree to some
 concessions only to show that they too can
 be "generous." The EC meets on May 3
 and 4 to complete preparations for
 UNCTAD. If no common policy is ar-
 rived at, as seems likely, most EC mem-
 bers will present their own views. This
 would not ony undermine the EC's negoti-
 ating position but also weaken the stand
 of the industralized nations as a whole.
 The Japanese are mainly concerned
 that they not appear unsympathetic to the
 demands of the developing states.
 Conflicts within the government,
 however, will make it impossible for
 Tokyo to do anything but line up with the
 more conservative developed countries.
 Any Japanese concessions will be aimed
 at improving Tokyo's relations with ma-
 jor suppliers of raw materials, but will
 avoid getting the Japanese involved in
 broad commodity agreements.
 Almost all of the industrialized coun-
 tries-but not the Dutch and Scan-
 dinavians-will resist the full range of
 developing country demands at Nairobi.
 On raw materials, most of the in-
 dustrialized states may well agree to an
 overall statement to permit a study of
 buffer stocks for a number of com-
 modities, but will not accept the proposed
 common fund. The industrialized states
 are united in opposition to a debt
 moratorium, but most of them would sup-
 port a conference on general debt
 problems.
 The industrialized states will also op-
 pose a legally binding code for the
 transfer of technology and a restructuring
 of UNCTAD. They will reject the conten-
 tions of the developing countries that in-
 sufficient attention has been paid to their
 problems in the GATT multilateral trade
 negotiations.
