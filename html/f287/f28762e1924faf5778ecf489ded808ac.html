FOREWORD 
This report attempts to assess the impact of the Communist system 
of economic planning, regimentation, and rapid industrialization upon 
the backward, predominantly agricultural economy of China; to estimate 
the effect of that impact upon Communist China's economic development 
and capabilities through 1960; and to examine the foreign economic 
relations of Communist China with Western countries, the USSR, and 
other members of the Sino-Soviet Bloc.

ECONOMIC PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT IN COMMUNIST CHINA* 
1952-60  
Summary and Conclusions 
The announcement in July 1955 of the first Five Year Plan 
(1953-57) for Communist China followed a period of reconstruction and 
economic experimentation and a series of basic policy decisions. 1L?C?e 
These decisions, 'which indicated the trend of the planned development 
program, included the socialization of large-scale consumer goods 
industries and and the monopolizatAonopf trade in grain, cotton, and 
agricultural mport products. `13y postponing increased output of con-
sumer goods, gulating the profits of agriculture; and following a teellt: 
general policy of forced economizing, the Communists were able to 
expand heavy industry despite the additional decision to modernize ksSsc-.. 
the armed forces with its resultant heavy drain on resources that 
could alternatively be used for investment. Governmental actions of 
this nature are dictated by the Communist Party through the State 
Council and by agencies, such as the State Planning Commission, which 
are formally controlled by the State Council. 
The acceleration of the pace of socialization of agriculture, 
industry, and trade in late 1955 under direct order of Mao Tze-tung 
showed sharp advancement of the goal of complete socialization as 
set forth in the Five Year Plan. Over 60 percent of all peasant 
households were organized into cooperatives by late 1955 as com-
pared with only 11 percent at the end of 1954. By the end of 1954, 
75 percent of industry was under state, cooperative, or joint state-
private enterprises, and practically all of foreign and wholesale 
trade and 58 percent of retail sales were in the hands of state, and 
cooperative trading companies. 
The most recent information on the budget of Communist China 
indicates further increases in revenues and expenditures in 1955 and 
a growing reliance on the taxes and profits of state enterprises as 
* The estimates and conclusions contained in this report represent 
the best judgment of ORB as of 1 January 1956.

  1 The increased defense expendi-
tures in combination with economic construction expenditures com-
prise 75 percent of the budget for 1955. 
The Chinese Communists plan to build up productive capacity on a 
wide front from 1953 to 1960. The capital construction program 
emphasizes industrial buildup especially. It also includes invest-
ment in the fields of transport, communications, agriculture, water 
conservancy, education, propaganda facilities, and health. The 
total amount of planned capital investment in the Five Year Plan is 
equivalent to $18.1 billion at the official exchange rate. The 
relative emphasis assigned by the Chinese Communists to development 
of the various sectors is shown by the allocations, which are 
58.2 percent to industry; 19.2 percent to transport and posts and 
telecommunications; and 7.6 percent to agriculture, forestry, and 
water conservancy. Within the industrial portion of the current 
plan, 88.6 percent ($9.3 billion) of investment is to be in 
producer goods industries and 11.4 percent ($1.2 billion) in con-
sumer goods industries. 
The population of Communist China totaled 582.6 million in 
mid-1953, according to the official results of China's first com-
plete census. This is approximately 20 percent higher than the 
officially reported total of 487 million in 1950. The sharp 
increase is due chiefly to improved statistical coverage rather than 
to natural increases. The predominantly rural character of the 
Chinese population is indicated by the classification of 505.3 
million people, or 83.7 percent of the population, as rural inhabit-
ants. There is increasing evidence of overpopulation in present-
day China. The appearance of articles on birth control in Party-
controlled publications indicates that the ground is being prepared 
for a policy shift on population control. 
The estimated labor force in Communist China is about 300 million 
of the 1954 population of 594 million, with over 75 percent of the 
labor force in farm employment. The dominance of agriculture in the

Chinese economy is brought out even more clearly by the fact that in 
1954, less than 23 million of the nonfarm labor force of 56 million 
were in industry, trade, transport, and government. 
Indexes of industrial production show large annual increases 
averaging nearly 33 percent from 1949 to 1952. Estimated 1952 out-
put was about 10 percent over pre-Communist peak levels of output. 
Increases in industrial production in 1953 and 1954, the first 2 
years of the Five Year Plan, dropped to an average of about 20 per-
cent. Estimated increases of output from 1955 to 1957 are smaller, 
averaging about 10 percent a year and reaching a total in 1957 that 
is 87 percent higher than in 1952. Output originating in modern 
industry alone in1957 is expected to double that of 1952. This 
estimated increase reflects a level of gross value of production 
that is 75 percent over that of 1952 as compared with the Five Year 
Plan goal of nearly 100 percent. The rate of industrial growth is 
expected to decline further from 1957 to 1960 to about 8 percent a 
year. The decline in rate of increase is due in part to the greater 
reliance on increases in capacity and also to the much slower 
increases in output of agricultural raw materials, limiting the 
expansion of light industry. The output of industry, however, still 
is relatively very small in the Chinese Communist economy as com-
pared with that in more industrialized economies. 
The success of Chinese Communist objectives for developing heavy 
industry at the expense of light industry is shown in the industrial 
indexes for producer goods and for consumer goods. After 1957 the 
projected value-added index for consumer goods shows an average 
annual increase of about 9 percent as against an average annual 
increase of about 17 percent for producer goods. 
The current Five Year Plan places increasing emphasis on the 
development of heavy industry in order to industrialize the country 
and modernize the military establishment. With the exception of 
electric power, steel, machine tools, and chemicals, in which 
relatively large new capacities are to be brought into production 
after 1957, planned rates of growth of the principal industries from 
1955 on decline sharply. The trends in the modern industrial sector 
are illustrated in the figures for production of major industries 
for 1953 and projected for 1957 and 1960 as follows:

The estimated average increase in gross national product* (GNP) 
from 1950 to 1952 is about 12 percent. The increase in GNP for 1953 
is about 6 percent over 1952 and is higher if Communist figures are 
accepted. Setbacks in agricultural output in 1954 reduced the increase 
in GNP in 1954 to 4.5 percent over 1953, but agricultural outpuu in 
1955 was expected to increase by 6 percent over 1954. The projected 
trend from 1954 to 1957 gives annual average increases in GNP of 
about 7.5 percent, with total production reaching a level 36 percent 
higher than in 1952. The GNP is expected to increase from 1957 to 
1960 at an annual rate of about 4.5 percent.

The general trend embodied in the indexes of major sectors of GNP 
shows a steady increase in the proportion of national output origi-
nating in the industrial sector. Modern industry is expected to rise 
by one-half in its contribution to GNP in the period of the Five Year 
Plan, and the modern industry sector, including transport and state 
construction, should increase from 17 to 25 percent of GNP. This 
trend through 1957 still leaves the modern sector a relatively small 
share of total output in comparison with Japan or Western industrial 
powers. Moreover, because the index was computed in 1952 Chinese 
Communist prices, it reflects the high prices of producer goods 
relative to agricultural prices. 
In terms of 1952 prices, consumption is expected to decline from 
about 73 percent of GNP in 1952 to about 65 percent in 1957 and invest-
ment to rise from about 15 percent to about 21 percent. Government 
purchases of goods and services including military expenditures are 
expected to rise from about 12 percent to about 14 percent. 
The index for construction in fixed prices, derived from an index 
of available investment goods including construction materials, shows 
the following percentages of the total estimated volume of construction 
in the Five Year Plan completed in 1953-54 and projected for 1955-57: 
1953, 15 percent; 1954, 18 percent; 1955, 20 percent; 1956, 22 percent; 
and 1957, 25 percent. The burden of the Five Year Plan on the economy 
is therefore expected to rise steadily from 1952 to 1957, and invest-
ment should increase as a proportion of total output. 
The GNP of Communist China in 1952 now is estimated to be about 
69 billion yuan in the new currency. The increase over the previous 
estimate of 60 billion yuan is due in general to the acceptance of 
Communist claims of output of agricultural products in 1952. The 
usual procedure for converting Communist China's GNP into other 
currencies is to apply the official exchange rate, which for nearly 
all of 1952 was about 20,000 old yuan (2 yuan, new currency) to 
1 US dollar. This is equal to $34 billion. If the GNP for Com-
munist China in 1952 is directly valued in US 1952 prices, however, 
its value is about $65 billion. On the other hand, when both US 
and Chinese GNP's are valued in 1952 yuan prices, the value of the 
Chinese output as a percentage of US output is equivalent to $25 
billion.

The Communists' estimate of total grain production in 1954-55 of 
169.5 million metric tons* probably is overstated by about 11 million 
tons. This difference, however, probably is attributable to a 
number of factors, including the collection of peasant grain reserves 
carried over from previous years. 
The Communist plans for agriculture include ambitious increases 
of production of commercial crops as well as grain. The limitations 
of total cultivated acreage, plus the possibility of expanding it by 
about 1-1/2 percent per year, necessitate close scrutiny of planned 
conversions of land from grain to commercial crops. 
In the field of transport the Five Year Plan includes the laying 
of about 10,000 kilometers (km) of track, including over 4,000 km of 
new lines (later revised upward to more than 5,000 km), and increases 
in double tracking, spur lines, and sidings. By the end of the Five 
Year Plan, 7,100 km of new highways will be open to traffic. Invest-
ment for transport in the Five Year Plan is more than 8.2 billion 
yuan ($3.4 billion), or nearly 20 percent of the total basic con-
struction plan. 
The new official figures on Communist China's foreign trade 
indicate a much higher level of trade than had been previously 
estimated. Total trade is valued at $3.47 billion in 1954 and is 
approximately in balance if military deliveries under loan arrange-
ments are excluded. The bulk of Communist China's trade continues 
to be with the Soviet Bloc, the Free World portion being about 
20 percent. The USSR, as Communist China's most important trading 
partner since February 1950, has agreed to provide extensive assistance 
for 156 of the 694 principal projects currently scheduled for con-
struction or renovation during the Five Year Plan. 
In 1954 the North Korean government placed a value equivalent to 
about $125 million on Chinese Communist goods delivered in 1954, the 
first year of the 10-year economic agreement, under which Communist 
China promised to send the equivalent of $338 million in goods and 
materials during 1954-57. Detailed reports of actual materials 
delivered in 1954, however, are estimated to be only half that value, 
or about $60 million to $70 million. In 1954, Communist China 
exported to North Vietnam a minimum of 30,000 tons of goods, which 
Tonnages throughout this report are given in metric tons.

I. Introduction. 
The period of Communist control of China -- since the seizure of 
the mainland in 1949 -- and of the imposition of the Communist 
pattern on the economic institutions of the country may be divided 
into three phases, as follows: 
A. 1949 Through 1952. 
The Chinese Communist leaders during 1949-52 concentrated 
upon reconstruction and rehabilitation of the industrial plants left 
by the Nationalists and Japanese, demolished the influence and seized 
the reserve assets of the Nationalist capitalists, and expropriated 
Western-owned enterprises. Industrial production was restored 
generally to the levels previously attained under the Japanese in 
Manchuria and under the Nationalists in China proper, and the assets 
of Chinese and Western industrialists seized in China proper were 
used as means for further expansion. During this period, also, the 
institutional framework was established for central planning and 
statistical compilation, financial and budgetary controls, centralized 
procurement and allocation of resources, and socialization of agri-
culture and private industry. 
B. January 1953 Through June 1955. 
Although annual production goals and plan fulfillments had 
been announced during the previous period, goals and announcements 
for 1953 became parts of the new Five Year Plan for economic develop-
ment. This plan depended heavily upon a Soviet technical assistance 
agreement, reached only in May 1953 and announced in the following 
August. After the truce in Korea, in June 1953, which entailed the 
diminution of Soviet military aid and the reallocation of domestic 
resources, further detailed elaboration of the plan depended 
principally upon (1) surveys to establish geological resources, 
engineering requirements, economic feasibility, and practical sites 
for the location and construction of industrial projects and mines; 
(2) basic planning to develop cost and resource calculations, 
engineering designs, and determination of the extent to which the 
USSR and the European Satellites could provide industrial equipment 
for the projects; and (3) further extension and development of the 
economic controls and institutional framework of socialization and 
centralized economic planning and administration.

C. July 1955 Through 1957 and 1960. 
The Chinese Communist government outlined the Five Year Plan 
at the Annual National People's Congress in July 1955. The delay 
between the inauguration of annual production goals under the Five 
Year Plan and the enactment into law of the complete plan provided 
time for the development of specific industrial projects, for working 
out detailed technical assistance arrangements with the USSR and the 
European Satellites, and for the Chinese to prove their ability to 
execute annual segments of the plan. After 2-1/2 years of the plan, 
major portions of the capital investment plan, in addition to pro-
duction goals for the more complicated machine and producer goods 
industries, still remained to be accomplished. 
The following sections briefly examine the resources, 
capabilities, and weaknesses of the Chinese Communists in relation 
to the goals of the Five Year Plan.

II. Economic Planning and Administration. 
A. Five Year Plan (1953-57). 
The Chinese Communist government announced in July 1955 its 
complete Five Year Plan which had been inaugurated in 1953. The prin-
cipal aim of the plan is to form a base for further industrialization 
of the econom nd modernization of the armed forces. With the aid 
ke.-0,2W 
of the USSR, 156 rojects are to be undertaken, projects which are to 
make possible e doubling of industrial output within the 5-year 
period. The collectivization of agriculture and the nationalization 
of private industry are to be carried out in accordance with the 
Soviet model. In fact, since the announcement of the aims of the 
plan, official pronouncements have indicated that the pace of 
collectivization and industrialization has been increased. 1/* 
B. Extension of Economic Controls. 
1. Organizational Structure. 
The recent changes in the organizational structure of the 
Chinese People's Republic represent the continuing trend toward 
greater centralization of control over the economic, political, and 
social life of Communist China. This trend is illustrated by the it) )00Gn 
formal structure of the Chinese Communist government adopted in c Pt' 60 
September 1954, as shown by the chart in Figure 1.** This new Av4 
structure indicates that there has been little change in the real locus of of power, which resides in the key organs of the Chinese Com
munist Party -- the Central Committee, the Politburo, and the 
, 14, ,44,

Under the constitution the National People's Congress 
and its Standing Committee are superior to the State Council, but 
in practice and on the basis of the,membership.of both organizations 
the State Council appears to be theore important of the two)>The kwir., 
State Council, which is described in the-constitution-as?"the Govern-J744?0:.

to include responsibility for the armed forces by subordinating to 
the Council the newly created Ministry of Defense. 2/ In the eco-

responsibility for national economic planning, the state budget, con-
trol of foreign and domestic trade, and the coordination and leader-
ship of the various ministries and commissions on the national level 
and of the local people's councils at every subordinate level 
throughout the country. 1/ 
It appears probable that coordination functions which 
formerly were handled by committees under the former Government 
Administrative Council now are performed by the eight staff offices 
of the State Council which were established "to assist the Premier 
in controlling the work of the various departments under the State 
Council." V These staff offices are directed by men who are, in 
general, prominent Party leaders and who frequently hold concurrent 
posts as ministers or commission chairmen. 
2. Economic Control Organizations and Methods. 
The Chinese Communist economy is formally controlled by 
a number of economic ministries, commissions, and agencies under the 
State Council. The various economic ministries, commissions, and 
agencies may be divided into three general groups: (a) those which 
control the extractive or productive industries, (b) those which 
control economic services, and (c) those which perform over-all 
control and planning functions. Figure 2* shows the subordination 
and functions of the economic ministries. 
There are approximately 11 agencies in the Chinese 
Communist government administrative structure whose duties include 
over-all economic planning or control. functions. On the commission 
level there are two agencies, the National Planning Commission and 
the National Construction Commission. There are also six ministries 
which are mainly concerned with over-all economic control and 
planning functions rather than with operations -- these are the 
Ministries of Finance, the Procurement of Agricultural Products, 
Local Industry, Third Machine Building, Supervision, and Labor. 
Four of the specialized agencies are in this category: the National 
Statistical Bureau, the People's Bank of China (which is also a 
service organ), the Central Handicrafts Administrative Bureau, and 
the Central Industry and Commerce Administrative Bureau.

a. National Planning Commission. 
The National Planning Commission is the key economic 
control body. It is 1:e.sDonsible for the internal consistency of the 
national economic plans as well as for coordinating subordinate 0( 
economic organizations and allocating the resources of caaital, raw 
?ffigt-F=1ana skilled_labor. The fact that Vice-Premier Li Fu-cE7un 
is the chairman of this organization emphasizes its preeminent posi-
tion. 
b. National Construction Commission. 
Little is known about the National Construction Com-
mission, which is comparatively new. It probably was created to plan 
construction activities on a national basis and to remedy the lack 
of coordination and standardization which existed among the various 
industrial ministries, construction enterprises, and the Ministry of 
Building. 
c. Ministry of Finance. 
The Ministry of Finance is one of the major control 
organs of the Chinese Communist government. It is responsible for 
tax collection and administration 2/ (including taxes-in-kind); for 
the preparation, execution, and audit of the national budget ?/; 
for the inspection and supervision of financial policies, budgets, 
accounts, and audits of enterprises and agencies of the central 
government 7/; and for the management of the national treasury 
(including the currency issue and public granaries). .f./ The Office 
of Food Control, of the Ministry of Finance, which had the respon-
sibility for the operation and control of the public granaries, 2/ 
now will coordinate with and perhaps supervise the recently created 
Ministry of the Procurement of Agricultural Products 10/ under the 
central government's forced procurement program. 
d. People's Bank. 
The People's Bank is the operating arm of the Ministry 
of Finance. It acts as the national treasury, bank of issue, and 
clearinghouse and exercises monetary and currency control. It op-
erates as the tax collecting agency, conducts the construction bond

drives and other national borrowing activities, and serves as the 
principal government and public depository and dispenser of credit. 
e. Ministry of the Procurement of Agricultural Products. 
Following 1-1/2 years of experience in the implemen-
tation of the state's 'balanced supply and marketing program," the 
State Council apparently concluded that a reorganization of the 
control mechanism for the procurement of agricultural products was 
needed. The Ministry of the Procurement of Agricultural Products 
accordingly was established in June 1955. Its functions and 
responsibilities have not been publicly announced, but apparently it 
is intended to centralize all procurement efforts with respect to 
grain and commercial crops. The Ministry of Food still appears to 
have responsibility for the supply and marketing of foodstuffs and 
operates the ration coupon program. 
f. Ministry of Local Industry. 
It is believed that the Ministry of Local Industry 
was created to provide central coordination for the enterprises 
directly under the control of the local governments and prepare the 
way for the further socialization of private industries under the 
state's nationalization program. 11/ 
g. Third Ministry of Machine Building. 
The Third Ministry of Machine Building was established 
in April 1955 purportedly "to direct the machine and electrical engi-
neering industries of local state enterprises, joint state-private, 
cooperative, and private enterprises." 12/ Its functions are believed 
to be related to further socialized control of industries in the 
machine and electrical engineering fields. 
Two other organizations apparently also exist for 
the control, direction, and extension of socialization of local 
industries and trade: 
h. Central Handicrafts Industry Administrative Bureau. 
i. Central Industry and Commerce Administrative Bureau.

j. National Statistical Bureau. 
The National Statistical Bureau, because of its func-
tions of auditing and aggregating national production statistics in 
all fields and of providing basic data for national planning, is one 
of the key support agencies for economic planning and control. 
k. Ministry of Labor. 
The Ministry of Labor apparently does not play a 
very important role in the Chinese Communist economic control 
mechanism other than to provide over-all statistical and planning 
data. It has declined in importance with the eclipse of its 
Minister, Li Li-san. 
Finally, there are two ministries which, although not 
primarily economic, play an important role in the economic control 
system. 
1. Ministry of Public Security. 
The Ministry of Public Security is important in the 
economic field because it controls a considerable resource of man-
power through the "reform through labor" (forced labor) program. 12/ 
Under this program, labor is supplied for water conservancy work, 
highway construction and maintenance, and construction programs of 
varied nature in hardship areas. In addition, this ministry has the 
power to prevent mass migration of the peasants to the cities. 
m. Ministry of Supervision. 
The Ministry of Supervision presumably controls the 
people's supervisory offices which are attached to government 
organizations and enterprises at all levels. It was reported in 
1954 that there were almost 4,000 supervisory organs alleged to be 
"supervising all activities of production and finance, concentrating 
on the supervision of economic construction." This ministry is 
responsible for cutting down waste and costs in connection with the 
implementation of state procurement and allocation of resources for 
the 5-year capital construction program.

3. Progress Toward Socialization. 
Speeches made by various Chinese Communist officials 
leave no doubt as to their ultimate objective of a socialist economy. 
They consider state control the only way to industrialize, and, in. 
order to provide support for the industrialization program, measures 
to socialize industry and to collectivize agriculture have priority 
as the means of controlling output. By the end of 1954 these 
measures had reduced the private sector to 25 percent in industry, 
12 percent in wholesale trade, and 42 percent in retail trade. The 
record is less impressive in handicrafts and agriculture, but even 
here 5 percent of handicraftsmen and 11 percent of farm households 
had been organized in producer cooperatives, an intermediate form 
of socialist organization preceding complete collectivization. 
The initial slackening of the socialization pace 
in 1955 varied in degrees from sector to sector. An actual rise in 
private retail trade was first predicated, from 42 percent of sales 
in 1954 to 48 percent in 1955, but large-scale conversion of private 
trading enterprises to joint state-private firms in December 1955 
apparently reversed the announced policy. A stepping-up of the 
process of socializing private industrial enterprises by means of 
converting whole industries in the large cities to joint state-
private status also began in December 1955. The conversion of 
private industry and trade into the intermediate form of state 
capitalism termed "joint state-private enterprise" (in which the 
state initially invests the requisite new capital funds in the form 
of raw materials or merchandise inventory as a share of total capi-
tal) is more gradual than outright nationalization which character-
ized earlier years. The preharvest policy of temporary abatement in 
the fate of agricultural socialization -- that is, of recruitment of 
peasants as members of producer cooperatives -- was terminated 
abruptly in October 1955 when an all-out drive for agricultural 
cooperativization was launched following publication of a speech by 
Mao Tse-tung. 12/ He called for a 100-percent increase in agri-
cultural cooperatives (from 650,000 to 1.3 million) rather than the 
previously agreed on target of 1 million cooperatives by October 1956. 
The December 1955 results of this effort indicated that Mao's goal 
already had been exceeded.

On a somewhat longer range basis -- that is, by the end 
of the Five Year Plan -- the Chinese Communists expected to reduce 
the contribution of private industry to 12 percent of total indus-
trial output and the contribution of private retail trade to 21 per-
cent of sales and to organize into producer cooperatives 5 million 
handicraftsmen (about 50 percent of the total). 
a. Agriculture. 
State-owned farms in Communist China account for an 
I insignificant part of the total farm area. The number of totally 
socialized mechanized state farms is expected to rise from 94 in 
1954 to 117 in 1955 and to 141 in 19571 while nonmechanized state 
farms will then number 2,897 according to plan. The establishment 
of large-scale state farms is said to be delayed pending the planned 
production of farm machinery. 
The government embarked on an intensive campaign in 
1952 to form mutual aid teams, and by 1954 these teams embraced 
56 percent of peasant households. Great headway in organizing 
producer cooperatives was made during 1954, but it occurred in a 
year of declining agricultural production. Although floods prob-
ably were the chief cause of the decline, the decision to slow down 
the organizational work of forced socialization is a partial 
acknowledgement of the effects on production of peasant resistance 
to the "hard line" policy pursued by the government during that year. 
Nevertheless, the number of producer cooperatives reached 500,000 by 
the end of 1954. Despite the emphasis on consolidation and volun-
tarism, the latest statistics on agricultural producer cooperatives 
show continued organizational increases to a total of 670,000, 
embracing 15 percent of peasant households by the spring of 1955 and 
to over 1.24 million, containing 63 percent of peasant households, 
by the end of 1955. These data are summarized in Table 1.* The 
effect of such a rapid rate of growth of peasant cooperatives on 
production will not be evident until the next harvest, but past 
experience in other Communist countries suggests that it may be 
seriously adverse.

b. Trade. 
The official policy with respect to socialization of 
trade in Communist China as announced in the Five Year Plan indicated 
a desire on the part of the central government to increase rural-
urban trade and therefore to delay further socialization in order to 
utilize the talents of private merchants. Private retail trade was 
to be the main beneficiary of this policy, as wholesaling and foreign 
trade had been largely taken over by the state. This new line was 
changed again in November 1955, however, as a result of the direct 
intercession of Mao Tze-tung, and the emphasis again was on conversion 
of private trading firms into joint state-private firms as an inter-
mediate step to complete socialization.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
In 1954-55) before the abrupt change of policy pre-
scribed by Mao, supply and marketing cooperatives and state trading 
organizations were directed to concentrate on wholesale trade and 
to curtail competition with private retailing. Private merchants 
were encouraged to make wholesale purchases from supply and marketing 
cooperatives, and, in order to strengthen the effects of this policy, 
cadres were directed to encourage private traders to organize mutual 
aid groups, or cooperatives, to pool capital for such purchases. 
The state trading companies apparently have con-
sistently underquoted prices of private traders in a multitude of 
fields. The major blow to private trade, however, came in the form 
of bans on private trading in major agricultural products and in the 
policy of "planned purchase and supply," which gave the state the 
exclusive right to buy certain commodities and.enabled it to control 
supplies to the market. This policy was applied to grain in November 
1953 and to cotton, cotton cloth, and oil-bearing seed crops in 
September 1954. The state then assigned some of its purchasing 
authority to supply and marketing cooperatives, which, in addition 
to buying the products mentioned above, monopolized purchases of tea, 
tobacco, peanuts, and jute. Private sales of these commodities were 
made for the most part on a commission or fixed-price basis. 
The 32,000 supply and marketing cooperatives with a 
membership of 160 million have continually cut into private trade. 
They were in a position to underprice private trade because of the 
lower wholesale prices, cheaper credit, and tax exemption accorded to 
them by the state. The inroads made on private trade were manifested 
in its declining share of total wholesale and retail sales, from 
81 percent in 1950 to 42 percent in 1953. State trading departments 
and cooperatives, as indicated in the Five Year Plan, were expected 
to control 55 percent of retail trade by 1957, as compared with 
34 percent in 1952. The policy inaugurated in November 1955, whereby 
the state contributes capital funds in the form of merchandise inven-
tories to private trading firms thus converting them into joint 
state-private firms, is a drastic intermediate step toward complete 
socialization and places nearly all trade under direct state control.

c. Credit. 
The People's Bank of China has controlled almost all 
credit in urban areas since the beginning of Chinese Communist rule. 
A more difficult socialization task has been the elimination of 
private credit in the rural economy. Several organs have been used 
to achieve this goal, the key ones being the rural credit coopera-
tives. Their number has grown from 542 in 1950 to 130,000 in 
April 1955, which means that 59 percent of rural villages now are 
served by credit cooperatives. Other villages are served by credit 
departments of the supply and marketing cooperatives or by credit 
mutual aid teams. These forms are used to prepare the way for 
credit cooperatives. 
The plans for 1955 are to forego further expansion 
of credit cooperatives in favor of improved management and firmer 
alignment with the state financial policy. The 1957 goal for credit 
cooperatives had been achieved by the first half of 1955. The 
expansion of socialized credit organs is shown in Table 2.* 
The socialization of industry is a clear goal of the 
Chinese Communists although there has been variation in government 
relations with private enterprise. The initial approach to private 
enterprise prevailed through 1951 and may be described as a period 
of adjustment with recognition of state leadership as the basis of 
adjustment. Private enterprises had to submit operational plans 
for government approval, distribute earnings according to a set 
pattern, and submit reports on the value of their assets. 
Having substantially restored production and gained 
knowledge of private industrial practice, the Chinese Communists 
embarked on a direct and violent attack on private enterprise during 
the first half of 1952. The campaign succeeded in breaking the power 
of private industry and commerce. Subsequent production declines and 
unemployment brought about a shift in government policy. The means 
used to revive private enterprise, such as state loans and orders, 
made private enterprises almost completely dependent on the state. 
The simplest device was for the state to place an order with a pri-
vate enterprise and then arrange for state distribution of the output.

Moreover, the state, by control of raw materials and their allocation, 
could make a private enterprise simply an agent carrying out a pro-
cessing contract. It was announced officially that 86.4 percent of the 
gross output of private industry in 8 leading cities fell within such 
control. 2/11 
Joint enterprises are another form of state capitalism, 
and their encouragement dominated policy in 1955. This form evolves 
when private enterprises are forced to the verge of bankruptcy because 
of state capital levies, price controls, or stoppage of credit and are 
obliged to accept state funds, usually in the form of raw materials, 
as a share of total capital. These enterprises are subject to direct 
supervision and financial control by the government and, regardless of 
the percentage owned, the state directs their policies. The share of

joint enterprises in total industrial output doubled between 1953 and 
1954 and was expected to contribute 15.4 percent of total industrial 
production in 1955. The joint form facilitates eventual takeover by 
the state and at the same time retains some incentives for priVate 
entrepreneurs to contribute their experience. 
In late 1955 a hastening of the process of sociali-
zation of private industry in the intermediate form of joint state-
private ownership was indicated in a policy change instituted by 
Mao Tse-tung. The only industries in which as much as 5 percent was 
planned to be left in private hands by 1957 were the food processing 
and machine building industries. Table 3 shows the planned pro-
portions of ownership of selected industries in 1957. In view of 
this policy inaugurated in late 1955, however, it is estimated that 
these proportions will be effective in 1956.

The handicraft industry is the only sector of the 
Chinese Communist economy in which socialized organization still plays 
only a minor role. Although the Communist timetable under the Five 
Year Plan called for organizing all 10 million handicraftsmen into 
cooperatives by 1960, EY Mao Tze-tung stated in late 1955 that the 
socialization problem of the handicrafts would be solved in the spring 
of 1956. Handicraft output was valued at 15.3 billion yuan in 1953, 
and the 300,000 organized handicraftsmen contributed less than 4 per-
cent of the total. Membership in the various types of handicraft 
organizations is expected to rise from 1.16 million in 1954 to 1.7 
million in 1955. The Five Year Plan membership goal of 2.1 million 
persons applies only to handicraft cooperatives, which account for 
roughly half of the organized handicraftsmen. 
C. National Budget and Fiscal and Accounting System, 1950-55. 
1. Budget Revenues and Expenditures, 1950-55. 
Planned revenues and expenditures in the 1955 budget 
represent new highs for the Chinese Communists (see Figure 3*). 
Planned current receipts of $11.85 billion** are 7 percent higher than 
in 1954. Inclusion of the surplus carried over from 1954 raises the 
total revenue of $13.178 billion. In terms of yuan, the total budget 
amounts to roughly 31 percent of the Chinese Communist GNP. Despite 
a rise in expenditures of 20.7 percent to $12.56 billion, 1955 is to 
be the fifth successive year in which the achievement of a budget 
surplus is claimed. This surplus, however, includes revenue from 
the surplus brought forward which is drawn upon to cover the actual 
deficit of $710 million. The proportions of revenue derived from 
each category are presented in Table 4,*** with budget data for 
1950-55.**** 
* Following p. 24. 
** The yuan converted at the official Chinese Communist rate --
1 US dollar = 2.367 yuan. The official rate of the Communist Bank 
of China probably overstates the value of capital investment in 
yuan as much as 50 percent in terms of US prices and understates the 
value of services and of food crops. However, the official rate of 
exchange is used throughout this report (except where otherwise noted) 
in order that consistent proportions may be maintained in the dis-
cussion of value relationships between budget categories.

a. Capital construction is composed of expenditures for fixed assets under the economic construction; administrative; and social, cultural, and educational categories of the budget. 
b. A total of 1,604.39 billion additional yuan was added to the cumulative surplus by the end of 1954. The 1955 budget speech states that roughly half of the surplus had been 
previously allocated and therefore only a portion was available for 1955 expenditures. It is not clear how the surplus was accumulated for it exceeds the unspent revenue of the 
years 1950 through 1953.

a. Revenues. 
(1) Surplus. 
The surplus of the Chinese Communist budget was 
stated to be $2.583 billion at the end of 1954. It is not clear how 
this surplus was accumulated because the unexpended balance on budgets 
of previous years totals only $1.448 billion. Certain statements in 
the 1955 budget report clarify the nature of the surplus category and 
indicate for the most part that it is fictitious because all but 
$1.327 billion of the surplus is already allocated. The available 
surplus is even lower if a 1955 appropriation of $713 million to state 
enterprises for repayment of overdue loans from the state bank is con-
sidered an existing obligation. 
Clarification of the relationship of the state 
bank loan program to government surplus accounts was necessary because 
of overlapping plans for the same funds. In both 1953 and 1954, 
budget officials apparently drew on the surplus funds forcing the 
state bank to contract its loans of working capital to state enter-
prises and cooperatives. The state bank now has free use of the 
funds repaid to it. The breakdown of the surplus category is 
presented in Table 5.* 
(2) Revenue Increases and Secret Military Credit. 
Revenues in the Chinese Communist budget of 1955 
are expected to increase at roughly the same rate as agricultural and 
industrial output. Over 60 percent of the increased revenue will be 
in the form of profits fram state enterprises. The increases in prof-
its are.to result from increased productivity and expansion of com-
modity circulation. The remaining two categories of revenue --
taxei and credits, loans and insurance -- also will increase but to 
a lesser degree. 
In accounting for the rise in the credits, 
loans, insurance, and the category other, announcement is made for 
the first time of military loans from the USSR. The only specific 
reference to military credit is in connection with a $40-million 
increase in credits and loans in 1955. There is reason to believe, 
however, that military credit of from $400 million to $500 million

Increase in local budget revolving funds 35.96 
was given in 1954 and will continue at the same level in 1955. This 
range is derived from a statement that a Soviet loan is mainly respon-
sible for a $600-million excess in revenues from the credits, loans, 
and insurance category achieved over the budgeted 1954 figure. Over-
subscription to a domestic bond drive accounts for $100 million of the 
unexpected revenue. If this were in fact the only other cause of 
overfulfillment -- and only the two are cited in the budget speech --
the military credit may have been as much as $500 million.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
There is evidence, however, that other components 
of the budget category may have increased unexpectedly during 1955. 
These possibilities include an increase in industrial credit based 
on the Soviet loan of $130 million (520 million rubles -- terms not 
announced) agreed to in October 1954 and on the inclusion as a credit 
of Soviet shares in several jointly owned companies turned over to 
the Chinese Communists during 1954. The October 1954 agreement 
specifies that Communist China is to repay the USSR with exports over 
a period of years for the capital shares thus surrendered. Allowances 
for these items would support a military loan estimate closer to 
$400 million. 
This interpretation of the budget statement is 
substantiated by foreign trade statistics announced by the Chinese 
Communist government on 29 July 1955. The reported value of imports 
is approximately $600 million more than previously estimated and 
could encompass at least $400 million worth of undisclosed Soviet 
military deliveries under the announced 1954 loan. 
A lower estimate of the loan might be derived 
from the expenditure side of the budget. Defense expenditures for 
1954 exceeded the plan by $230 million. If the unplanned expenditure 
was due chiefly to the allocation to the Ministry of Defense of an 
unexpected Soviet loan, the loan could be estimated at roughly that 
amount. 
(3) Revenue by Sectors. 
Revenue also is broken down into contributions by 
sectors. Taxes, profits, and depreciation reserves of state enter-
prises are a greater source of revenue than the bond and tax payments 
of all the other sectors combined. These sector contributions were 
mentioned in the budget speech only as a percentage of total revenue 
excluding foreign loans. In order to arrive at the dollar value of 
revenue by sectors, as presented in Table 4,* estimated foreign loans 
of $500 million in 1954 and $475 million in 1955 were deducted from 
total revenue.

b. Expenditures. 
(1) Increases. 
The large increase in expenditures in 1955 is 
attributed by the Chinese Communists to a carryover of unused 
appropriations for basic construction in 1954, increased payment of 
interest and principal on domestic bonds and Soviet loans, and 
allocations for economic development. The more important causes are 
the appropriation of approximately $700 million to state-operated 
enterprises to provide for repayment of overdue loans from the state 
bank and the increase of $600 million in defense expenditures neces-
sitated by the withdrawal of Soviet armed forces from Port Arthur --
that is, "necessitated" by the allocation to the Ministry of Defense 
of Soviet equipment turned over at the time of the withdrawal and 
the subsequent maintenance of operations and equipment at Port 
Arthur. 
Although the defense share of the budget did 
not increase in the 1955 plan, the substantial absolute increase in 
military expenditures may be partially responsible for the declining 
share of expenditures for economic construction. Within the economic 
construction category there are significant shifts in expenditures 
from agriculture and light industry to foreign trade, heavy industry, 
and transport. From the small allocation of economic construction 
funds to agriculture it is apparent that the Chinese Communists are 
still relying largely on organizational changes, minor investment 
measures, and favorable weather to realize their goals of increases 
in production of 7 percent per year. The investment plans also show 
scant consideration for production incentives in the form of consumer 
goods inasmuch as investment in light industry is cut almost in half 
and will represent only 10.8 percent of industrial investment as com-
pared with 22 percent in 1954. 
(2) Capital Construction. 
Capital construction is a new budget category, 
defined by the Chinese Communists as "construction increasing the 
fixed assets of the state." 27/ It cuts across the usual expendi-
ture categories of economic construction; social, cultural, and 
educational; and administration, and gives a more accurate figure of 
fixed investment in Communist China than could be derived from 
previous budgets. Fixed assets are to increase by $4.05 billion in

1955, which is approximately $0.5 billion more than was spent in 
1954. The only breakdown of the capital construction figure that 
is given pertains to industrial investment in 1954. In that year, 
48 percent of the funds allocated for capital construction were spent 
by industrial departments. 
(3) Budget Trends. 
(a) Nationalized Assets. 
In order to view the 1955 budget of Commu-
nist China in a wider perspective, a comparison with budget trends 
since 1950 is useful. Socialization probably is the best single ex-
planation for over-all and specific budget trends. The primary reason 
why revenue has risen from roughly $2 billion in 1950 to $12 billion 
in 1955 is that receipts include the value of confiscated enemy 
assets, profits, and reserves of former private enterprises, and 
capital levies on the public in the form of forced bond purchases 
and penalties for alleged tax violations and profiteering. 
(b) Categories of Expenditure and Revenue. 
Socialization of the economy also affects the 
types of expenditures in the Chinese Communist budget. Allocations to 
heavy industry account for 40 percent of economic construction expend-
itures under the 1954 budget in contrast to the 5 percent allocated 
to light industry. Total budget allocations for fixed investment 
(capital construction) constitute about one-third of budget expend-
itures and about 10 percent of GNP. The apparent rate of savings is 
thus very high considering the low level of per capita income in 
Communist China. The actual rate of savings in Communist China is 
even higher when private investment and working capital are taken 
into consideration. 
Another aspect of the socialization pro-
gram which has tremendous repercussions on the budget of Communist 
China is the government monopoly over, purchases of major agricul-
tural products. The prices at which agricultural products are sold 
by state stores or supply and marketing cooperatives are estimated 
to involve substantial markups over the official procurement price. 
The trading profits resulting from this price differential constitute 
almost 25 percent of the profits of state enterprises. This category 
of revenue has risen from 13 to almost 40 percent of the budget. A

S-E-C-R-E-T 
similar price differential also prevails on the tax assessment values 
at which grain taxes in kind are taken into the budget. The tax 
value of grain is less than half the fixed retail price. The con-
sequences of these differentials are that the tax burden on the 
peasant is heavier than the budget indicates) whereas the payment 
of wages in kind to administrative and military personnel, at a rate 
roughly midway between procurement values and official retail prices, 
understates these expenditures in relation to others. The true grain 
tax burden on the peasant has been estimated at 21 percent of budget 
receipts rather than the official proportion of 13.5 percent. 28/ 
The subsidization of expenditures through the use of wages in kind 
affects about 30 percent of both defense and administrative expend-
itures. If this portion of the two categories were raised by 25 
percent to represent the extent of underevaluation of grain, total 
expenditures would be $600 million more than reported in 1954. 
Defense and economic construction expenditures 
have more or less reversed their proportions in the budget over the 
5-year period. At the beginning, 41 percent was allocated to defense 
and 25.5 percent to economic construction. In 1955, 24 percent was 
allocated to defense and 48 percent to economic construction. The 
correlation of the two expenditure groups is close: for example, 
in 1952 the allocation to defense fell 16 percent, and the allocation 
to economic construction increased by 16 percent. 
The Chinese Communists have succeeded in 
restraining the growth of administrative expenditures and thus freed 
a greater portion of revenue for other more productive use. The share 
of administrative expenditures in the state budget has declined 
steadily, from 19 percent in 1950 to a planned 7.5 percent for 1955. 
Recent budgets have tried to build up the 
General Reserve Fund to give leeway for seasonal fluctuations of 
receipts and expenditures and for shifting the expenditure alloca-
tions during the fiscal year. Planned budgets since 1953 have 
included an appropriation to the General Reserve Fund, but no budget 
speech has indicated that reserves were increased according to plan. 
(c) Budget Fulfillment. 
Information on budget fulfillment since 
1950 shows a consistent underestimation of revenues and overestimation 
of expenditures. Profits of state enterprises seem to be the most

unpredictable revenue category for the Chinese Communist planners. 
The Soviet loan in 1954, however, caused the greatest single case of 
overfulfillment. 
Failure to carry out basic construction 
(investment) plans reflects a serious shortcoming in Chinese Com-
munist planning. In contrast to this underfulfillment, there has 
been consistent overspending on economic construction. A partial 
explanation for the contrasting results is that certain economic con-
struction expenditures, such as training and operating expenditures 
and assignment of working capital and fixed assets, are not dependent 
on availability of scarce skills, materials, and equipment and so can 
be more readily carried out. 
2. Capital Construction Program. 
a. Introduction. 
The Five Year Plan of Communist China predicates a 
total expenditure for "economic construction and cultural and 
educational development" during 1953-57 of 76.64 billion yuan (equiv-
alent at the official exchange rate to $32.8 billion). This planned 
expenditure includes allocations for capital construction, geological 
prospecting, engineering survey and design, stockpiling of equipment 
and materials, trial manufacture of new products, working capital of 
government enterprises and economic ministries, and operating expenses 
and training of personnel under the education ministries. 
Capital construction as defined by the Chinese Com-
munists includes construction, repair, and conversion of buildings 
and other structures for the purpose of expanding production; purchase 
of productive machinery and equipment and their installation; survey, 
design, and planning in the preparation for construction; L91 and 
expenses for training production cadres after completion of con-
struction. ]2/ The sum allocated for capital construction constitutes 
55.8 percent of the total planned outlay, or 42.74 billion yuan 
(equivalent at the official exchange rate to $18.1 billion). The 
allocations of the total planned expenditure and of the capital con-
struction funds included are shown in Table 6.*

b. Capital Construction Investment. 
The distribution of investment funds under the Five 
Year Plan of Communist China demonstrates the pattern of development 
which the Chinese Communists are attempting to put into effect. The 
pattern is one of emphasis on the building up of sectors which his-
torically have been weak in the Chinese economy. This pattern is 
illustrated in Table 7* and Figure 4.** Agriculture, which was the 
sector responsible for 44 percent of the estimated GNP in 1952, is 
receiving only 2 percent of the investment funds. Modern industry, 
which in 1952 contributed 12 percent to the estimated GNP, is 
receiving 62 percent. Within modern industry the emphasis on 
development of heavy industry shows up strikingly. The contribution 
of heavy industry to GNP in 1952 was about 50 percent higher than 
that of light industry, yet investment in heavy industry is to be 
eight times as great as in light industry. The transport and tele-
communications sector contributed 2 percent to GNP in 1952, yet it 
is to receive 19 percent of capital construction investment under 
the Five Year Plan. As would be expected, investment in transport 
and telecommunications is in approximately the same proportion to 
investment in heavy industry as was the 1952 GNP contribution of 
transport and telecommunications to the 1952 GNP contribution of 
heavy industry. The two sectors are moving together. 
Within the modern industry sector the pattern of 
emphasis upon historically weak phases is carried out. This pattern 
is illustrated in Table 8,-xxx which compares estimated value added*xxx 
by various industries with the shares of those industries in the 
capital construction investment under the Five Year Plan. Value 
added by heavy industry in 1952 is estimated to have been approxi-
mately 60 percent of value added by modern industry, and value 
added by light industry is estimated to have been approximately 
40 percent. Investment in heavy industry under the Five Year Plan 
Table 7 follows on p. 35. 
Following p. 34. 
xxx Table 8 follows on p. 36. 
*xxx Value added is the sum of the values created in the process 
of producing the output of an economy. Gross national product is 
the sum of the sales to the final consumer of the economy: that is, 
the gross value of the output of the economy less purchases of 
materials, fuels, and power used in the production process. The 
totals of these measures are equal.

is to amount to 89 percent, and investment in light industry is to 
amount to only 11 percent of total industrial capital construction 
investment. The textile industry, with the second highest value 
added in 1952, is to receive only 5 percent of total investment in 
industrial capital construction. 
Within heavy industry the engineering industry of 
Communist China shows the biggest contrast between 1952 value added 
and investment under the Five Year Plan. The showing for steel on the 
other hand seems low in relation to value added. This probably is 
because of the high price of steel products in Communist China, which 
results in a lower capital output ratio than in the engineering 
industries. Within heavy industry the emphasis is upon engineering, 
power, and steel. Petroleum products and miscellaneous heavy indus-
tries (chemicals, construction materials, and nonferrous metals) are 
of less interest, though the proportion of investment they are 
receiving is greater than their share of value added by heavy industry.

c. Industrial Capital Construction. 21/ 
The Chinese Communist program of industrialization 
envisages a 98.3-percent increase in the gross value of total 
industrial output by the end of the Five Year Plan, requiring an 
average yearly increase of 14.7 percent. Production by modern 
industry (exclusive of handicrafts) is to increase by 104.1 percent 
during the period, or 15.3 percent per year. Within the present 
plan period, emphasis is to be upon the development of heavy 
industry, which is to receive 88.8 percent of industrial invest-
ment funds, whereas light industry is to receive only 11.2 percent. 
In terms of the number of investment projects the 
major effort is to be expended on 694 projects which the Chinese 
Communists call "above-norm" construction projects.* Among these 
are 156 projects for which the USSR is furnishing technical and 
material aid, of which 145 are to be started, and, of these, 45 to 
be completed, during the 5-year period. The remaining 11 are to be 
designed within the 5-year period. It is contemplated that 455 of 
the 694 projects will be completed within the current Five Year 
Plan. In addition to the above-norm projects, there are 2,300 
relatively small, "below-norm" construction projects which the 
Chinese Communists expect to complete by 1957. 
The following are among the large projects: 
(1) Forty-eight major construction and reconstruc-
tion projects are to be completed between 1953 and 1960 in the An-
shan iron and steel complex, including 3 iron mines, 8 ore-selecting 
and sintering plants, 6 automatic iron blast furnances, 3 steel-
making plants, 16 steel-rolling mills, 10 batteries of coke ovens, 
and 2 heat-resistant material shops. 
* For each industry a norm has been established for building and 
expansion projects, according to an arbitrary classification of the 
size of the expenditure involved or the new capacity to be added. 
The relatively large projects, classified as "above-norm," generally 
are considered to be of key importance in the over-all plan of 
economic development and, therefore, require higher level super-
vision and control than the smaller "below-norm" projects.

(2) Two other major iron and steel combines are to be 
started: the No. 315 Plant at Wu-han - Ta-yeh 12/ in central China, 
and another plant at Pao-t'ou in Inner Mongolia. The No. 315 Plant is 
to be an entirely new development apart from the existing Ta-yeh Steel 
Mill. Although the latter is already expanding its facilities, it is 
believed that large-scale new construction work at the two new plants 
is not yet under way and may not get into full swing until 1956 or 
1957. 
(3) Fifteen thermal power plants of 50,000-kilowatt 
(kw) capacity are included among the many power projects to be built 
in the 5-year period. The Feng-man hydroelectric station in the 
Northeast is to have a total capacity of 567,000 kw 2.3./ after the 
installation of new generating units and Completion of renovation. 
(4) Thirty-one projects in the coal mining industry 
are to be completed during the 5-year period, each of which is to 
add a capacity in excess of 1 million tons of coal a year. 
(5) Many projects in the engineering industries are to 
be completed or started in the 5-year period. These include the No. 1 
Automobile Plant, to be completed at Ch'ang-ch'un within the current 
plan period; the No. 2 Automobile Plant, with a planned capacity 
double that of the No. 1 Plant; and a tractor plant with a capacity 
of 15,000 units per year. In addition, power_generating equipment 
Is planned with an output of 800,000 kw of new capacity within the 
5-year period, including units of 12,000-, 25,000-, and possibly of 
50,000-kw capacity. .3.V 
(6) Cotton textile mills with 1.65 million spindles 
and 47,100 looms are to be built in the 5-year period. The mills 
will range in size from 30,000 to 100,000 spindles. 
The additions to capacity planned for the prinO.pal 
industries by 1957 over 1952 and the total increases to be realized 
when all the planned projects have been completed are shown in 
Table 9* and indicate that the major part of the capital construction 
work remains to be carried out in the last 2 years of the plan period. 
The basic construction program as a whole reached 32 percent of com-
pletion by the end of the first 2 years. The Chinese Communists 
announced in September 1955 that by the end of the first 3 years of

the Five Year Plan, 52 percent of the volume of capital construction 
would have been completed, lY leaving 48 percent to be completed in 
the last 2 years of the plan period. 
Table 10* shows the sum specifically allocated by the 
Peiping regime to selected industrial ministries for capital con-
struction under the Five Year Plan, with estimates of the sums to be 
devoted to capital construction in individual industries under those 
ministries. Among the industrial capital construction investments 
the planned investment of the Ministries of Machine Building, 
6.93 billion yuan, is the largest. Under the Ministries of Fuel 
Industries, electric power is to receive the largest share of invest-
ment funds -- 3 billion yuan. In addition, the estimated local 
investment in electric power is 140 million yuan. The capital con-
struction investment in the petroleum industry is the residual sum 
of 1.53 billion yuan. 
It is estimated that, under the Ministry of Heavy 
Industry, steel will receive the largest share of capital con-
struction funds -- 3.4 billion yuan. The residual sum of 1.79 
billion yuan under this Ministry covers, for the most part, 
investment in the construction materials, nonferrous metals, and 
chemical industries. 
Capital construction under the Ministry of the 
Textile Industry is devoted principally to production of cotton 
textiles, with minor investment in plants for production of woolen 
textiles, silk, hemp, synthetic fibers, and for printing and dyeing. 
Capital construction for production of textile machinery also falls 
under the Ministry of the Textile Industry. Investment by the 
central government in productive capacity to produce cotton textiles 
is estimated to be 703 million yuan. Investment by the central 2 
government in other textile industry projects is estimated to be 
225 million yuan, which is a residual sum. 
Under the Ministry of Light Industry, investment 
is in the food-processing, sugar, rubber products, pharmaceutical, 
and paper industries.

It is believed that the capital construction invest-
ment funds allocated to the Ministry of Construction and Engineering, 
amounting to 690 million yuan, are to be expended upon construction 
machinery and equipment and upon construction of storage facilities 
for storing building supplies. 
Within the total of 26.62 billion yuan to be spent 
on industrial capital construction, 1.77 billion is to be spent by 
nonindustrial ministries upon industrial enterprises. Among such 
expenditures by nonindustrial ministries is an investment of 790 
million yuan by the Ministry of Forestry for capital construction in 
the lumber industry. The other industrial investments by non-
industrial ministries are in processing enterprises of the Ministries 
of Commerce and Food, shipyards of the Ministry of Communications, 
locomotive and railroad car construction and maintenance shops of 
the Ministry of Railroads, film studios of the Ministry of Culture, 
and others. 
d. Nonindustrial Capital Construction. 
Of the total amount of 42.74 billion yuan allocated 
for capital construction under the Chinese Communist Five Year Plan, 
26.62 billion yuan are allocated for industrial construction and 
17.89 billion yuan (including the 1.77 billion yuan to be spent on 
industrial construction by nonindustrial ministries) are allocated 
for investment by the various service ministries and the Ministries 
of Agriculture, Water Conservancy, and Forestry. 
The allocations of capital investment in transport, 
telecommunications, municipal utilities, state commerce, education 
and health, and the agricultural sector, ?as specified in the Five 
Year Plan, are shown in Table 11.* 
Total allocation under the Ministry of Railroads is 
5.67 billion yuan. Basic construction in the railroad system is to 
consist of building new lines, improving existing facilities, and 
increasing the locomotive and rolling stock. In the field of rail-
road construction investment, 21.5 percent, or 1.2 billion yuan, is 
to be spent on increasing the locomotive and car park.

port. It is estimated that 900 million yuan are to be spent for the 
construction of highways. In addition to the expenditure for high-
way construction, the allocation of the Ministry of Communications 
includes a residual of 439 million yuan, a small part of which prob-
ably will be used for other phases of highway transport, for example,

highway maintenance equipment, and the balance for water transport, 
mainly for the purpose of increasing shipping tonnage and developing 
shipyards. 
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications was 
allocated 361 million yuan for capital construction. This is a 
small amount considering the magnitude of this ministry's duties, 
and it is believed, therefore, that it is augmented by investment 
funds at the local level (listed under investment for local com-
munications) to be spent by local government organs. The Chinese 
Communists have allocated 739 million yuan to investment for local 
communications. It is believed that this sum is to be spent by 
local government organs for developing local road transport, water 
transport, and posts and telecommunications. 
Capital construction in water conservancy absorbs 
the preponderant share of funds for the budget item agriculture, 
forestry, and water conservancy. The Ministry of Water Conservancy 
on 26 July 1955 announced that 2.490 billion plan were to be spent 
on capital construction in water conservancy during the Five Year 
Plan period. 1// It is believed that the bulk of the 1.035 billion 
yuan allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture is to be spent for 
water conservancy projects and that most of the 200 million yuan 
invested by other ministries in agriculture, water conservancy, and 
forestry also will be spent on water conservancy. 
Projects under the Ministry of Water Conservancy 
include flood control, irrigation, and the development of water 
resources for hydroelectric power. At present, state investment in 
water conservancy takes the form primarily of the repair and building 
of dikes and the building of huge reservoirs. 111/ 
Investment for capital construction in agriculture 
other than that which goes to water conservancy goes into hand 
manufacture of tools; supply of tools; improvement of cooperative 
organizations; equipment for the preparation and distribution of 
organic fertilizers, tools, and seeds; land reclamation; state 
farms; farm tool and tractor stations; animal husbandry stations; the 
dewelopment and distribution of improved seeds and drugs and insec-
ticides; marine products enterprises; cadre training; and the 
Instruction of farmers in improved cultivation practices.

The basic construction investment of 789 million yuan 
allocated to the Ministry of Forestry apparently will be invested in 
the lumber industry, probably going into facilities for timber con-
servation and afforestation. 
Capital construction under the item culture, 
education, and health amounts to 3.08 billion yuan. The expansion 
of educational facilities will be for the accommodation of planned 
incredses in enrollment, which amount to 127 percent of 1952 enroll-
ment. The plan is to establish 60 new schools of higher education 
so that by 1957 there will be 208 schools of higher education. In 
addition, existing schools are to be expanded. 
Facilities for the publishing of books, magazines, 
and newspapers are to be rehabilitated or built. The system of 
state-operated bookstores is to be expanded. It is planned that 
within the period of the Five Year Plan, radio transmission capacity 
is to be increased by 2,174 kw. The motion picture industry is to 
be developed. Construction of a new developing and printing plant 
with an annual capacity of 45 million meters is to be started in 
1956. The building of a raw film plant with a production capacity 
of 65 million meters a year and of a new film studio is to be 
started in 1957. The number of state-operated theaters is to be 
increased. Culture halls, libraries, and museums are to be built. 
The number of hospital beds under the central government is to be 
increased by 77 percent to a total of 244,000 within the period of 
the Five Year Plan. The number of epidemic-prevention centers, 
health stations, and district health offices under the central 
government is to be increased by 65 percent to a total of 17,000 by 
1957. 
Capital construction investment under commerce, 
banking, and commodity stockpiling amounts to 1.28 billion yuan. 
It is believed that the expenditure for commerce will be for 
storage and distribution facilities. The expenditure for banking 
doubtless will be for branch banking facilities. It is believed that 
the expenditure for stockpiling will be for equipment needed in con-
struction. 
The item construction of municipal utilities probably 
covers items which contribute to city improvement and expansion, 
such as power plants, city roads, bridges, drainage, water supply, 
and sewage systems.

III. Population and Labor Force. 
A. Population Trends. 
The population of Communist China totaled 582.6 million people 
at mid-year 1953, according to the official results of China's first 
complete census. This total is approximately 20 percent higher than 
the officially reported total of 487 million in 1950. Tile sharp 
change cannot be attributed to natural increase of the population. 
Instead, it must be explained in terms of statistical inaccuracies, 
deriving from what seem to have been consistent underestimates of 
the population made before 1953. 
The predominantly rural character of the Chinese population 
is indicated by the classification of 505.3 million people, or 83.7 
percent of the total population, as rural inhabitants. The urban 
population included 77.3 million people, or 13.3 percent of the total, 
according to the census announcement. Although not defined by the 
Chinese, it is believed that the urban population refers to cities with 
a population of 10,000 or more. Table 12 presents population estimates 
for selected Chinese cities as of June 1953.

No detailed information on the age and sex composition of the 
census population has been issued by the Chinese Communists. They have, 
however, announced that men outnumber women, with 107.5 males for every 
100 females. This is in contrast with the US, where there are only 
98.9 males per 1.00 females. They have also indicated a high concen-
tration in the younger age groups, reporting that children less than 5 
years of age accounted for 1.5.6 percent of the census population. By way 
of comparison, the US had only 10.8 percent of its population in that 
age group in 1950, and Japan had only 13.5 percent for the same year. 40/ 
The birth rate in China is believed to be between 40 and 45 
per 1,000 persons, and no significant decline is expected through 1960. 
The trend of the death rate, on the other hand, is far more difficult 
to predict, but, judging from China's past history, it seems likely 
that the annual average death rate has probably fluctuated between 
30 and 50 per 1,000 for the past several generations. It is probable 
that the death rate has fallen since the Communists came to power, 
although not so much as they have claimed. Food shortages remain a 
very serious problem in Communist China, however, and there is no

There is increasing evidence of overpopulation in present-
day China. Overpopulation has direct significance for China's eco-
nomic plans, and there are indications within China that the planners 
are just now beginning to recognize the seriousness of this threat. 
Indeed, doubts have been quietly expressed about the ability of China's 
resources to support such an enormous population. The appearance of 
articles on birth control in Party-controlled publications, plus the 
lack of any specific refutations from official sources, indicates 
that the ground is being prepared for a policy shift on population 
control. 
B. Labor Force. 
The key direct figure on the labor force in Communist China 
is contained in the recently published Five Year Plan which stated 
that workers and clerical staff totaled 21,020,000 persons in 1952. 
By 1954 it is estimated that this total had increased to 23,020,000 
persons. This employment total is exclusive of the numerically most 
important segment of the Chinese labor force -- agricultural workers 
as well as of self-employed, handicraft, service, and miscellaneous 
workers.

Scattered data on these remaining sectors have been fitted 
into the framework of an estimated 1952 labor force of 300 million 
persons and a 1954 force of 309 million persons and are presented 
in Table 14. The implied labor force participation rate of 52.5 
percent (in terms of the 1952 population*) is derived from the age 
and sex distribution of the population, present labor force policy 
in Communist China, and comparative data from other Far East countries.

1. Employment in Modern Industry. 
The modern industry labor force is equated with the 21,020,000 
persons classified as workers and clerical staff in 1952 as noted in the 
Five Year Plan. Approximately half of the workers were then in pri-
vate employment. The detailed breakdown of this figure given in the 
plan is presented in Table 15. The 1954 breakdown is based partially 
on announced figures and partially on estimates derived from Five 
Year Plan employment targets and output data.

There is a limited amount of data which may be used to 
subdivide the 1952 figure of 5.4 million industrial workers. In the 
absence of official figures on employment in light industry, a tenta-
tive estimate was made and is presented with announced data in Table 16. 
The estimate of employment in light industry is based on the estimated 
value added by such industries, less profits, divided by an estimated 
average wage. 42/ The 1954 breakdown is estimated on the basis of 
changes of output adjusted for productivity increases.

2. Employment in Industry. 
a. Urban Employment Opportunities. 
The industrialization program of the Chinese Communists 
has improved urban employment opportunities, although underemployment 
and unemployment have by no means been eliminated. The expansionary 
elements in regard to job opportunities include growth of industry, 
commerce, construction, flood relief, and irrigation projects. On 
the other hand, relocation of industry away from coastal areas, social-
ization, economy programs, campaigns to increase labor productivity, 
the Party line on such occupations as ricksha- and cart-pullers and 
domestic servants, and the elimination of foreign businesses have 
caused unemployment. The depressive effects of these factors are 
particularly evident in the large cities; they are not, however, of 
such magnitude as to offset entirely the improvement in employment 
opportunities that is a result of the expansionary elements in the 
economy. 
The only announced labor force goal for the Five Year 
Plan period is the increase of the workers and clerical staff by 
4.22 million persons. If the only labor force increase with which 
the Chinese Communists have to deal is a growth of 2 percent per year 
in the 1952 nonfarm labor force, 5.8 million additional jobs will be 
needed. Future prospects then would hinge on the feasibility of the 
Five Year Plan goal and the absorption of the balance of 1.6 million 
persons in private or socialized trade, handicrafts, and services. 
The Five Year Plan goal of employment had already been half met by 
the end of 1954 and, unless the labor productivity and labor economy 
programs are extraordinarily effective, it is believed that additional 
jobs required under the plan will be created. 
Even though the number of jobs in the Chinese Communist 
economy may grow through liberal use of the abundant labor supply, 
underemployment and peasants' attempts to move out of rural areas 
constitute grave and continuing problems for the Chinese Communists. 
In addition, the problem of actual unemployment reached serious pro-
portions in 1955. Floods in late 1954 left peasants without adequate 
supplies for the winter, and thousands of them swarmed into urban 
areas to live with relatives or to earn enough to avoid starvation. 
Also in 1955, light industry and textile mills were forced to curtail 
operations on account of shortages of raw materials arising from the 
1954 floods. The reported good harvest in the fall of 1955 should 
assist the regime in dealing with both these sources of unemployment.

b. Labor Productivity. 
The Chinese Communists have put increasing stress on 
raising output per worker and on cutting down on excess staff as a 
means of reducing production costs, raising output, and providing 
capital. The Five Year Plan stated that productivity has "experienced 
a great and continuing increase under the Communist regime and that 
during the Five Year Plan period, 2/3 of the increased production 
value of State-operated industry will be due to increased labor pro-
ductivity." 49/ 
Some of the productivity goals of the Five Year Plan 
and the National Statistical Bureau's yearly figures on labor pro-
ductivity are presented in Table 17.

c. Forced Labor. 
As a means of channeling surplus labor into produc-
tive work and of reforming recalcitrants, forced labor is taking on 
increased significance in Communist China. The Communists have 
announced that "over 83 percent of the prisoners in penal institu-
tions of the country are engaged in agricultural or industrial pro-
duction." 50/ Defining forced labor in terms of convict labor, how-
ever, restricts the meaning to rather narrow limits relative to the 
total number of involuntary workers in China. In addition to the 
forced laborers in prison camps, the Chinese Communists force the 
unemployed, the flood-stricken peasants, and peasants idle in the 
nonharvest or planting period to work in dike repair, irrigation, 
and highway construction projects. 
The postponement, however, of many of the planned 
conservancy projects to the second and third Five Year Plans indi-
cates the limitations which shortages of technical personnel and 
food resources impose on labor-intensive construction projects. 
3. Working Conditions. 
Controls on Chinese labor, especially industrial workers, 
have become increasingly severe over the past 5 years. A new set 
of regulations was promulgated in July 1954, and, although developed 
mainly for state-operated enterprises, it was clearly intended to 
serve as an outline for all enterprises. 51/ Among the more signif-
icant provisions, control over the movement of workers is sought by 
requiring each job applicant to furnish certification of his past 
record, including approved release from his last employment. 
At the present time a worker's pay rate in Communist 
China is determined by three basic factors; (a) type of industry, 
with highest rates of pay for mining and heavy industry and grada-
tions downward to consumer industries at the bottom of the pay scale; 
(b) productive capacity of individual plants, with the larger and 
more efficient plants having a higher wage level; and (c) skill of 
the individual worker, usually classified by an eight-grade system. 52/ 
Incentive methods of payment including piecework pay rates, bonuses, 
and awards are being instituted wherever possible in preference to 
time rates.

The Chinese Communists until 1955 used a system of com-
puting wages in terms of units of purchasing power. Thus a worker's 
wages were computed in a given number of units, the value of the unit 
being based on the price of a market basket of commodities. 53/ 
There are indications that the wage unit was rigged so as not to 
reflect the actual increase in commodity prices, with the result 
that increases in wages lagged behind price increases for consumer 
goods. 54/ If this proves to have been the case, then real wages 
of urban workers may have declined in the 1953-55 period. 
As regards money wages, it has been announced that the 
average monthly wage of workers (presumably industrial workers) was 
from 500,000 to 600,000 old yuan in 1953 -- that is, 50 to 60 yuan 
in the new currency. 55/ Available information from scattered plants 
and industries tends to support this range. 56/ 
C. Education and Technical Training. 
When the Communist regime launched its industrialization pro-
gram in China, it was immediately apparent that one of the most seri-
ous obstacles would be the shortage of skilled workers and technicians. 
The rather modest industrial developments in China before the Communist 
takeover relied heavily on foreign technicians and managers, with 
little industrial management experience accruing/to the Chinese. The 
immediate problem of coping with the shortage of technical personnel 
left the Communists with several courses of action. They could get 
maximum use from the small number of available technicians and special-
ists by distributing them according to the priorities of the indus-
trialization program; second, they could organize training programs, 
both in the schools and on-the-job, to turn out technicians as rapidly 
as possible; and, finally, they could rely heavily on foreign techni-
cians, using the interned Japanese and White Russian specialists as 
well as accepting aid from their Soviet allies. 
In their haste to advance economic construction, the author-
ities followed all three courses, giving each a high priority. 
Japanese technicians and specialists, trapped in China after World 
War II, helped in the reorganization of production in Northeast 
China. 57/ Soviet advisers in China have been reported in practically 
all phases of economic construction, such as superintending projects, 
advising Chinese managers, or traihing Chinese workers in the required' 
techniques. 58/ In addition to these technical and managerial advisers, 
Soviet experts in China include academic personnel assigned to Chinese 
colleges.

The Chinese also concentrated on expanding their own techni-
cal force rapidly. The city of Shanghai sent out over 63,000 skilled 
workers, technicians, engineers, and management personnel to con-
struction sites throughout China during 1950-54. The factories in 
Shanghai and An-shan also trained additional skilled workers, who 
were sent to basic construction sites, usually in the Northeast or 
Northwest. 59/ 
The official Chinese Communist estimate of personnel require-
ments for national economic construction was announced in late 1951. 60/ 
The Chinese estimated that, over the period of the first Five Year 
Plan, their economic construction would require an additional 150,000 
senior technical and administrative personnel and 500,000 intermediate 
and junior technical personnel. In addition, the Chinese Communists 
listed a need for 1.61 million teachers. They also listed a need 
for 200,000 additional health workers of advanced and intermediate 
level. 
The pressure to train specialists for economic, cultural, 
and health work has resulted in a rapid expansion of the enrollment 
in institutions of higher learning. According to Communist claims, 
a total of 117,000 students were enrolled in colleges and universi-
ties in the school year 1949/50. In the 1954/55 year, the enrollment 
had more than doubled the 1949/50 figure, increasing to a total of 
258,000 students. Although there has been an unusually rapid expan-
sion in the enrollment of China's universities and colleges, the 1954 
graduating class of 40,300, including 15,000 engineers, was considered 
by the Ministry of Personnel to be "far from enough to satisfy the 
growing needs of the country." 61/ 
In terms of total enrollments, the senior middle schools of 
Communist China have grown at a slower rate than have either colleges 
or primary schools. This has resulted in an inadequate reservoir of 
students prepared for college work. One of the most obvious reasons 
for this condition has been the shift from emphasis on general educa-
tion to that on specialization, especially in technical subjects. A 
more fundamental reason is that, in spite of unprecedented expansion 
of school facilities, educational opportunities are still severely 
limited in China.

The most striking evidence of failure in education can be 
found in the fact that, by the Communists' own estimate, over 80 per-
cent of the Chinese population is illiterate. 62/ And although the 
Communists claim to have expanded primary schools to an enrollment 
of 51.5 million students in 1954, this includes, by their own ad-
mission, only 62 percent of the total eligible school-age children, 
leaving some 30 million children completely outside the educational 
system. 63/ 
In summary, it is clear (1) that the imperative need to 
obtain trained workers and technicians quickly has resulted in an 
excessive emphasis on numbers of graduates, students, and trainees; 
(2) that this emphasis has not been able to surmount the serious 
obstacle of the high rate of illiteracy; (3) that higher education, 
although meeting the decreed requirements of numbers of students pro-
cessed and indoctrinated, is falling seriously short of quality stand-
ards; and (4) that the resort to on-the-job training of workers and 
administrators, while filling the positions with the specified num-
bers of trainees, must result in the imposition of heavy responsibili-
ties on the supervisors and administrators and in costly mistakes in 
the execution of orders and plans by the inadequately trained novices.

IV. Trends in the Economy. 
A. Significance of Chinese Communist Statistical Reports. 
The trends in nonagricultural production presented in this 
report are based on research to determine the resources, the pro-
ductive facilities available to exploit the resources, and the 
approximate magnitude of year-by-year production, which in most 
cases substantiate Chinese Communist claims of the output of im-
portant commodities. Reliance upon Communist statistics to esti-
mate the absolute magnitude of production is necessary in some 
cases because of the lack of precise data available from non-
Communist sources. The use of Communist announcements offers some 
advantages in that advance notices of production goals and planned 
increases of capacity allow time in which to seek data from other 
sources which might indicate the feasibility of the planned per-
formance. The use of Chinese Communist announcements is not with-
out its drawbacks, however, for such announcements, in some cases, 
diverge from estimates previously derived exclusively from non-
Communist information. 
Chinese Communist statistical series probably are much 
better than any that existed previously for China. Statistical 
reports are a part of the apparatus of economic controls, and 
there is much evidence of Chinese Communist efforts to develop and 
enforce accounting procedures and periodic reporting by all enter-
prises of any importance. As the state rapidly extends its control 
directly and indirectly over the economy, the coverage of the 
statistics available to the Communist government -- if not to the 
outside world -- is increasing. 
The reliability of Communist statistics, aside from the 
question of outright deception, must depend on Communist cadres 
that were initially untrained to meet the demands placed upon 
them. In addition, the development of systematic data for a rela-
tively underdeveloped economy such as China's is enormously dif-
ficult. Agricultural production; handicraft output; and the whole 
miscellany of distributive services, including native transporta-
tion, coolie stevedoring, and other middleman functions, depend 
on the relatively isolated activity of individuals and family units 
where systematic records of economic activity are lacking.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
The extension of centralized control, furthermore, and its 
concomitant expansion of economic reporting may account for a portion 
of the claimed production increases since 1949. Economic reports 
probably have incorporated statements of production from the areas 
of previously uncounted and unrecorded activities of unorganized 
farmers, traders, and other private operators as these groups have 
come either under direct Communist administrative control or under 
the tax system. The probable resultant overstatement of production 
increases is difficult to differentiate from actual increases in 
production. In general, recent Communist statistical reports repre-
sent increasingly important data on the Chinese economy  
Moreover, as these statistical reports become available, 
the opportunities are increasing for cross-checking Communist state-
ments from the points of view of both internal consistency and 
aggregative analysis. 
B. Gross National Product. 
1. By Sector of Origin. 
From 1950 to 1960, GNP, in factor prices, is expected to 
grow at an average annual rate of almost 8 percent compared with an 
expected rate of about 6 percent for the USSR and 3 percent for the 
US. This growth rate, as indicated by the indexes in Table 18,* is 
not distributed evenly over the period or among the major sectors 
contributing to the product of the economy. 
The average increase in GNP from 1950 to 1952 was about 
15 percent. The increase in output for 1953 was 9 percent over 1952. 
Reduced agricultural output in 1954 restricted the increase in GNP in 
1954 to 4.5 percent over 1953. The projected trend from 1954 to 1957 
indicates an average annual increase of about 6 percent, with GNP 
reaching a level in 1957 36 percent higher than in 1952. From 1957 
to 1960, GNP is expected to increase at about 4.5 percent a year. 
The Chinese Communist emphasis on the industrial develop-
ment of the economy is demonstrated by the different rates of growth 
expected for the various sectors. Those sectors directly related to 
industrialization will more than double output from 1952 to 1960. On

contribution to GNP, and the modern sector including transport and 
state construction will rise from 17 percent to 25 percent of GNP. 
This trend through 1957 still leaves the modern sector a relatively 
small share of total output in spite of the industrialization 
program. 
It must be remembered that the changes projected are in 
terms of Chinese prices for 1952 -- a year in which industrial 
goods were in short supply and highly priced in relation to agri-
cultural products. As the output of producer goods rises and as 
demand for agricultural products increases, with agricultural out-
put remaining relatively constant, prices of producer goods are 
likely to fall in relation to prices of agricultural products. 
Such a trend in prices would mean that industrial output would not 
command as large a portion of 1957 output in current prices as is 
indicated in Figure 6.* 
2. By End Use. 
Table 19** presents trends expected for GNP in terms of 
estimated final sales to consumers, government, and for invest-
ment. Based on the estimated allocations of GNP in 1952, an in-
dex of GNP at market prices is derived as a second method of com-
puting an index for GNP. The two indexes do not vary significantly 
in view of the difficulties of obtaining trends in over-all output. 
The different rates of growth noted in the preceding 
section are reflected in the anticipated growth of consumption, 
investment, and government purchases. As a result, by 1957 (in 
terms of 1952 prices) consumption will decline from about 73 per-
cent of GNP in 1952 to about 65 percent, and investment will rise 
from about 15 percent to about 21 percent. Government purchases 
are expected to increase from about 12 percent to 14 percent. 
3. Size of Gross National Product in 1952. 
The total GNP of Communist China in 1952 was about 69 
billion yuan in the new currency. This represents an increase of 
9 billion yuan over previous estimates and results almost entirely 
from the higher estimate of agricultural output. If the official 
exchange rate is used to convert Communist China's GNP into dollars

a. 1952 prices are used. 
the total is $34 billion. At best, this conversion rate is an average 
exchange rate for goods entering into foreign trade, and of course it 
does not reflect the relative prices of US and Chinese goods and ser-
vices which do not enter foreign trade. Even if the exchange rate 
were considered the best average conversion rate for total output, it 
would be inappropriate for direct comparisons of various sectors of 
the economy. 
For these reasons, a conversion rate based on a cross-
valuation of the Chinese Communist GNP in terms of Chinese prices 
and US prices for the year 1952 was constructed. Many problems arise 
in making such an international comparison of output. The first is 
the adequacy of the GNP concept for measuring the output of an under-
developed country such as Communist China. The second qualification 
springs from discussion of the welfare significance of the GNP con-
cept. The well-being of the Chinese and US populations should not 
be compared on the basis of GNP alone. Food distribution services in

the US, which increase the market value of foodstuffs, are not re-
quired by the Chinese, and US residents are not necessarily better 
off because their foodstuffs have a greater market value. On the 
other hand, US output may be understated because GNP does not fully 
reflect higher quality of goods, greater diversification of pro-
duction, freedom of consumer choice, and other benefits to the US 
economy. 
To convert Chinese output to US dollars, each sector 
of the Chinese economy was valued in US dollars, and the output of 
goods and services in the US in 1952 was valued at Chinese prices. 
The difficulties of such comparisons are great even when comparing 
corresponding sectors of GNP. Despite these differences caused by 
opposing methods of allocation of resources, varying scales of 
production, and differing levels of technology, the comparisons 
thus obtained are considered more valid than the general use of the 
exchange rate as the basis for valuing Chinese output in dollars. 
The differences between the sector ratios for the US 
and for the Chinese bill of goods are moderate except in the case 
of industry. In the case of the industrial sector the US dollar 
is worth about 2-1/4 times as many yuan for the US bill of goods 
as for the Chinese bill of goods. Largely because of this dis-
crepancy, the total GNP is valued at $65 billion in terns of the 
average conversion rate for the Chinese bill of goods and at $25 
billion in terms of the average conversion rate for the US bill of 
goods in yuan. This range is extreme, and no particular conversion 
rate can be regarded as more meaningful or appropriate than the 
others. 
C. Consumption and Investment. 
1. Consumption. 
Recent Chinese announcements indicate that the population 
is increasing by at least 1.5 percent a year, and the increase may 
have been even greater in recent years. Table 20* presents an index 
of estimated per capita availability of consumer goods without con-
sideration of subtractions due to exports or of stocks carried over 
from one year to the next.

The index of per capita availability of food increases 
from 1949 to 1952, then stabilizes slightly below the 1952 level 
for the Five Year Plan period. The index demonstrates the extent 
to which national resources are being diverted to the industrializa-
tion program and poses the problem of the maintenance of the same 
food level in the face of a rising population and increases in in-
come. Increases in production of fuel and textiles and miscellaneous 
consumer goods, on the other hand, permit greater expenditures for 
consumer goods other than food. If planned trends up to 1957 are 
realized, Communist China's ability to export textiles and other 
consumer goods will be increased. 
2. Investment. 
The index for investment increases at about 34 percent 
a year from 1949 to 1952. From 1952 to 1957 the average annual 
rate of increase is about 13.5 percent. The large increases 
achieved from 1949 to 1952 and, in part, 1953 probably represent 
largely the reconstruction and repair of war-damaged plants and 
equipment. The period 1953 through 1957 indicates the first steps 
of the Chinese Communists toward the industrialization of the 
economy. The extremely large increase of 1957 over 1956 reflects 
the final phase of the first Five Year Plan.

D. Agriculture, 
1. Food Production. 
A review of the basic factors influencing agricultural pro-
duction in Communist China indicates that China, with a population 
nearly four times as large as that of the US, has a cultivated acreage 
less than half that of the US. The total land under cultivation in 
China in 1952 is estimated to be roughly 100 million hectares, of 
which almost 31 million hectares are double cropped. The allocation 
of the total cropped area of 131 million hectares to individual crops 
is shown in Table 21.

The Five Year Plan of Communist China states that total 
production of grain crops in 1952 (including soybeans and sweet 
potatoes converted to a grain basis) amounted to 163.9 million tons, 
which is accepted as approximately correct. The 1957 goal for pro-
duction of grain crops is 192.8 million tons, or 17.6 percent over 
1952, which is considered to be far too high. On the basis of pre-
war yields and of the improvements which might be effected by 
measures now being instituted by the Chinese Communists, it is be-
lieved that the most that could be achieved in the increase of 
grain crops during the 5-year period is about 11 percent, or a 
total production in 1957 of 180 million tons. On the basis of the 
Five Year Plan and the relative emphasis given to increasing pro-
duction of crops of relatively high yield per acre, it is estimated 
that the given crop production of 1952 may be increased proportionately 
for the individual crops as shown in Table 22.* 
US specialists have estimated that a program of agri-
cultural improvement in China for a period of gO to 25 years could 
accomplish an increase of food production on the land presently 
cultivated of approximately 40 percent of present production and 
that an additional 6 to 8 percent could be added by the cultivation 
of new land. Thus, assuming that the Communist system of regimenta-
tion could accomplish the necessary instruction of peasants in the 
measures which would yield short-term increases and which require 
relatively small investment, it is possible that within 5 years or 
so an increase of 10 million to 15 million tons of food production 
could be realized on the land presently cultivated. Table 23** 
shows the relationship between the estimated production of the main 
food crops and population growth for 'the years 1949 through 1954 
and projected through 1960, as compared with the 1931-37 average. 
The table reveals that in the best year of agricultural production 
under the Communists -- 1952 -- the per capita availability of food 
was equal to only 87 percent of that in 1931-37. In order to 
attain the prewar level by 1957, an increase in food production of 
38 million tons of food, or 23.5 percent over 1952, would have to 
be realized. This may be compared with the Communist plan to in-
crease the gross value of agricultural output by 23.3 percent over 
1952, including an increase over 1952 of 17.6 percent or 31 million 
tons of food. .

For the realization of an increase of food production suf-
ficient ta keep pace with the increase in population the Chinese Com-
munists rely mainly on the extension of relatively minor measures of 
improvement. It therefore seems unlikely that the goals for increased 
food production will be reached. The best that could be achieved in 
the way of increased production of grain crops during the Five Year 
Plan, it is believed, would be a 9- to 11-percent increase over 1952. 
Furthermore, it is believed that improvements more long term in nature 
(such as irrigation, flood control, and the opening up of new land) 
and the extension of minor improvement measures together might realize 
a further increase in production of grain crops of possibly another 
6 percent by 1960. This would still leave the per capita availability 
of food, on the basis of projected increases in population, at a level 
approximately 10 percent below the 1931-37 average.

2. 1955 Food Situation. 
in Communist China during 
the spring and summer of 1955 indicated a serious food shortage fol-
lowed by grain rationing in the urban areas. The state council 
issued grain rationing orders along with other orders designed to 
extract larger grain deliveries from the peasants and to move the 
available food thus obtained to the cities, industrial centers, and 
towns. The rationing system became operative in cities and towns, 
and in industrial and mining areas before the end of November. 
In Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech of 21 July 1955 he 
stated that the production of grain in 1954-55 totaled 169.5 mil-
lion tons. It is estimated, however, that the total production 
of grain in 1954-55 was about 158 million tons. The difference of 
11 million tons may be attributed in part to the possibility that 
the Communists, in expanding their production base, included for-
merly unreported areas and grain reserves carried over from pre-
vious years. A general padding of statistics for political purposes 
is also a possibility. A subsequent decree by the Chinese Com-
munists announcing a lowering of grain procurement quotas for the 
next 3 years .?..Y would seem to indicate, however, that the 1954 
production was less than the officially announced 169 million tons. 
On the basis of the 1954-55 grain production of 158 
million tons, the supply available for food would have totaled 110 
million tons, or an annual per capita availability of 186 kilograms. 
This would have provided, statistically, a daily caloric intake of 
1,781 calories per capita, that is, some 10 percent below the pre-
war average daily caloric intake of around 1,967 calories. In 
comparison with other countries of Asia the 1955 per capita caloric 
intake of Communist China was lower than that of other Eastern 
countries with the exception of North Vietnam and India. 
3. Principal Commercial Crops. 
Under the land utilization pattern in China the largest 
proportion of cultivated land is devoted to the principal food crops, 
with relatively small shares divided among the commercial crops --
cotton, tobacco, sugar beets and cane, vegetable oil seeds, hemp, 
silk, and animal husbandry. Thus a relatively small conversion of 
land from grain to commercial crop production, or increases in culti-
vation of commercial crops on new land, results in relatively large 
percentage increases in acreage and production of commercial crops.

Within the limits of the total cultivated acreage of about 
134 million hectares (including double-cropped areas) in 1955 and the 
possibility of expanding cultivated acreage by about 1.5 percent per 
year, it is believed possible that substantial increases can be achieved 
in both cultivated acreage and yields of commercial crops without 
compromising the projected increase of food crops. The Five Year 
Plan for increased production of commercial crops, however, does not 
appear to be completely related to possible acreage increases within 
the total prescribed acreage limits which have been postulated. 
The announcements of the Five Year Plan goals for production of com-
mercial crops are shown in Table 24.

Besides increasing the acreage sown to grain, cotton,

of 2.1 million hectares in acreage sown to oil seeds is planned, 
this latter constituting nearly 10 percent of the planned increase 
of cultivated acreage during the 5-year period, which is believed un-
likely of accomplishment. The production of cotton in Communist 
China is estimated by US specialists on the basis of acreage, yields, 
the relationship of raw cotton to cotton yarn production and of 
available yarn to cloth production, the number of operable spindles 
and looms in cotton mills, and the production of yarn per spindle 
and cotton cloth per loom. Such a procedure results in production

figures which are considerably below those announced by the Chinese 
Communists. A comparison of the two sets of data is shown in 
Table 25.* It is clear from the comparison in Table 25 that the 
Communists' claims were excessive for the amounts of raw cotton 
available to produce the stated amounts of yarn. It is apparent, 
however, that the Communists recognized this disproportion by 1955 
when the various claimed production figures for 1954 reflected 
adjustments to more appropriate mutual proportions although raw 
cotton production is still somewhat excessive for the amount of 
yarn indicated. 
E. Industry. 
The Chinese economy for the period 1949-60 may be charac-
terized by two major features: first, the period of recovery from 
the war years, 1949-52, and, second, the inauguration of a program 
to develop the industrial base of the economy, 1953-60. It would 
appear that the Chinese Communist recovery programs were, in general, 
successful, and by 1952 the output of major industrial commodities 
met or exceeded the peak pre-Communist levels of output. Similarly, 
the Chinese Communists appear to have achieved some success toward 
their goal of developing heavy industry. 
Chinese Communist statistical reports substantiate three 
major trends in the economy. First, the reports demonstrate large 
increases in industrial output and in the growth of the share of 
total output originating in industry. Second, they indicate the 
more rapid growth of heavy industry relative to consumer goods. 
Finally, these reports show the growing proportion of industrial 
output originating in the areas of the economy which are dominated 
by the state. 
From 1949 to 1952 large increases in industrial output were 
achieved, reflecting the integration of the economy under one govern-
ment. The indexes presented in Tables 26 and 27** show that in the 
first 2 years of their industrialization program the Chinese Com-
munists made substantial progress in developing industrial output, 
achieving increases of about 24 and 14.5 percent for 1953 and 1954, 
respectively, when measured by value-added indexes and 21 and 14 
percent when measured by gross value of production indexes.xxx

Increases in output for 1955 to 1957 are expected to be smaller, 
averaging about 10 percent a year for industry excluding farm handi-
craft. The rate of industrial growth is expected to decline still 
further from 1957 to 1960 to about 8 percent a year. The decline is 
due in part to the greater necessity for increases in industrial 
capacity as the basis for increases in production and to the much 
slower increases in output of agricultural raw materials. 
A comparison of the indexes for heavy industry with those for 
light industry indicates the greater emphasis placed upon heavy indus-
trial development by the Chinese Communists. Value-added indexes indi-
cate that the output of heavy industry may triple over the period 
1952-60, whereas the output of light industry will be less than double. 
The two sets of indexes presented in Tables 26 and 27 are 
not strictly comparable. The value-added inaexes, constructed net 
of intraindustry sales, measure only the final contribution of in-
dustry to the economy. The gross value indexes, on the other hand, 
include some, if not all, intraindustry transactions. To facilitate 
a comparison of the production estimates employed to project the 
value-added indexes with Chinese announcements, indexes based on CIA 
production estimates and available 1952 prices have been calculated. 
The discrepancy between Chinese Communist claims and the CIA 
estimate of the gross.value of industrial output may be explained in 
part by differences in the product mix and prices used for the con-
struction of the two indexes. For the period 1952-57 the differences 
between the Chinese and the CIA figures stem largely from the greater 
growth claimed by the Chinese in the light industries than is credited 
by CIA. 
Expanding economic reporting, differences in classification, 
and the weighting system employed by the Chinese Communists probably 
have resulted in an inflation of the announced index. The expansion 
of state control over food processing and distribution, with the con-
comitant extension of reporting, and the change in the classification 
system used for the handicraft industry are likely to have caused the 
index to rise more rapidly than actual output. Whereas it is not pos-
sible to compare the price weights used in the two indexes, it appears 
that the Chinese index is more sensitive to changes in the output of 
more heavily taxed commodities. It is felt, as a result of the fore-
going, that the CIA index more accurately reflects the growth ex-
perienced by the light industries.

The relatively small difference between the indexes for heavy 
industry result largely from different estimates of the output of 
machine industries. The Chinese Communists claim these industries 
increased output by 65 percent in 1953 and 13 percent in 1954. The 
increase from 1954 to 1957 is to be about 8 percent a year. Such 
a growth pattern can be explained only by the rapid multiplication 
of simpler types of machine tools in 193 and 1954, followed by a 
diversion of resources to production of more complex types of 
equipment and machinery. 
1. Engineering Industries. 
Although the Chinese Communists claim that output of 
the engineering industries has risen 14 times from 1949 to 1954, 
it is admitted that these industries are still largely limited to 
the production of parts and to assembly, repair, and manufacture 
of small and simple machinery and equipment. The Five Year Plan 
calls for many construction projects to diversify as well as to 
augment the capacity of the engineering industries to produce more 
complete units and more complicated types of machines. The Five 
Year Plan admits the Chinese Communists' dependence on the USSR 
for 50 to 70 percent of the equipment needed for the 156 Soviet-
aid construction projects, which are the "core" of the Five Year 
Plan, and for 40 percent of the equipment for the industrialization 
program. 
The orientation of the Five Year Plans, present and 
future, is toward the indigenous production of a full range of 
producer goods for further industrial expansion. Table 28* gives 
production figures included in the current plan for major items 
of the engineering industries for 1952 and projected for 1957. 
The productive capacity of other key items planned for 1957 or 
1960 is as follows: metallurgical and mining machinery, 171,000 
tons; power generating equipment, 800,000 kw; trucks, 90,000 
(capacity in 1960); and tractors, 15,000 (1960 capacity of a 
tractor plant to be commissioned in 1959). 67/ 
The first Five Year Plan also records the state council 
intention for the machine industry to begin the trial or actual 
production of many more complex machine products, including the 
following: (a) 1,000-meter blast furnaces, each with a capacity of

a. According to the Five Year Plan, the number of metal-cutting machine tools 
to be produced in 1957 is less than that of 1952 but the aggregate tonnage 
will be increased by 80 percent. The technical quality as well as the cutting 
capacity of these machine tools to be produced in 1957 is planned to be much 
better than those produced in 1952. In addition, the number of different types 
of these machine tools to be produced in 1957 is to be increased, the output 
of small machine tools is to be cut; and more and more large-scale, compara-
tively modern machine tools are to be produced in 1957.

Some of the more important of the Soviet-aid projects 
which are reported to have been finished or are scheduled for com-
pletion under the sponsorship of the First Ministry of Machine 
Building within the span of the current Five Year Plan include: 
the No. 1 Northeast Machine Tool Plant and the No. 2 Machine Plant, 
the Mukden Pneumatic Tool Plant, and the Northeast No. 7 Electrical 
Machinery Plant, all in Mukden; the Northeast Precision Measuring 
and Cutting Tool Plant, the Northeast No. 4 Electrical Machinery 
Plant, the Harbin Electric Meter and Apparatus Plant, and the Harbin 
Boiler Plant, all in Harbin; the No. 1 Automobile Plant in Chiang-
ch'un with a planned production capacity of 30,000 trucks per year; 
the Fu-shun Mining Machinery Plant; the T'ai-yuan Heavy Machinery 
Plant; and the Ching-wei Textile Machinery Plant at Peiping. 01 
Two other major plants which are to be started within the current 
Five Year Plan but which will not be in production until the second 
Five Year Plan are the No. 2 Motor Vehicle Plant and the No. 1 Tractor 
Plant, with planned annual production capacities of 6o,000 trucks and 
15,000 54-hp tractors, respectively. ?.2/ 
The success of this ambitious Five Year Plan for the ma-
chine industry will depend largely upon the importation of equipment, 
the completion of a number of Soviet-aid construction projects, and 
the assimilation of advanced industrial techniques. Although notable 
increases in the value of output apparently have been achieved by the 
machine building industry, the gross value of output was little more

than 6 percent of total industrial output in 1954 and will continue 
at the same rate. Because the substantial investment allocated to the 
engineering industries embodies the drastic reorganization required 
to overcome these weaknesses in product mix and in technology, the 
value of output is expected to increase only moderately in the last 
3 years of the plan. Greater increases may be expected after 1957. 
2. Armaments Industry. 
Although the Chinese Communist armaments industry is not 
yet capable of meeting all the equipment requirements of the Chinese 
Communist Armed Forces, it is believed to be proceeding apace with 
a program of gradual modernization. The government apparently is still 
concentrating on the production of infantry regiment equipment such 
as small arms, machineguns, and mortars as well as some light artillery. 
Table 29* gives both estimated production and production 
capacity for ammunition and indicates that, although estimated pro-
duction decreased radically after 1953 (Korean Armistice), capacity 
has increased and will continue to do so through 1960. Estimated 
minimum production of ammunition for 1954-60 was calculated on the 
basis of roughly one-third of estimated capacity. In anticipation 
of or in the event of war, it is believed that actual production 
could be quickly expanded to the capacity figure. 
Table 29 shows, in general, the estimated production of 
artillery, mortars, machineguns, small arms, and armored vehicles 
for 1950-60. The estimated increases in production of artillery, 
mortars, and machineguns through 1955 are considered necessary in 
the light of requirements of the Chinese Communist Armed ,Forces, which 
are in process of standardizing weapons and equipment. The increases 
are further considered possible because of reported increases in the 
number of arsenals,** because of increased labor efficiency brought 
about by Soviet training and guidance at production points, and be-
cause of imports of Soviet machines. 
Using the estimated production for the years 1953-55 the 
requirements*** for all the weapons produced except artillery and

machine guns would be fulfilled from indigenous production. Thus the 
production of weapons except artillery and machineguns will be cut 
back in 1956 and the production of the latter items cut back in 1957. 
There is little doubt that the restoration of plant facili-
ties by the installation of Soviet equipment following 1952, combined 
with the advice and training given by Soviet experts, has resulted  
in an improvement in the quality of output. 73/  
Ammunition production in Communist China has been limited 
to the production of ammunition for the following listed weapons, but 
the munitions industry is capable of production of other ammunition 
items presently imported from the Soviet Bloc.

90-mm rocket launcher 
57-mm recoilless rifle 
Rifle and submachinegun 
ammunition 
Land mines 
Hand grenades (AT and hand) 
The Chinese Communist production of ammunition for these 
weapons is estimated to be sufficient to meet peacetime requirements 
for the period 1954-60 but not sufficient, even at the estimated 1960 
capacity, to meet requirements equal to those for the Korean War in 
1952. It is believed, however, that the Chinese arsenals will have 
the capacity by 1956-57 to be self-sufficient in the production of 
light weapons such as small arms, machineguns, light mortars, light 
artillery, and special weapons such as rocket launchers and recoilless 
rifles. 
It is estimated, however, that even by 1960 the Chinese 
Communists will not be able to produce the heavy artillery, anti-
aircraft artillery, tanks, and self-propelled guns required during 
time of war. By 1957, Communist China may have the facilities for 
producing some heavy artillery and antiaircraft artillery and may 
have the beginnings of a tank industry by 1959. Nevertheless, the 
production of these items probably will take place at the expense of 
a cutback in the production of light weapons because heavy weapons 
will be produced in the same arsenals in which light artillery and

mortars are now produced. For the production of limited peacetime 
requirements it is estimated that Communist China will be self-
sufficient in all categories of conventional weapons by 1960.

During the current Five Year Plan, Chinese Communist 
planning envisages an increase in total electricity output capacity 
of 4.1 million kw, or 2.05 million kw over the 1952 capacity, and 
a planned output in 1957 of 15.9 billion kwh. This is expected to 
be accomplished by undertaking 92 power station projects, among 
which are included 15 thermal power plants, each with a generating 
capacity of 50,000 kw) and by the renovation and expansion of exist-
ing plants, Most significant of which is the renovation of the Feng-
man hydroelectric station to achieve a total power generating capac-
ity of 560,000 kw. 22/ Table 30 shows the estimated production of 
electric power for the years 1952-60.

Current plans for construction of power plants necessi-
tate continued reliance on imports of power equipment from the USSR, 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Hungary. IY In order to fulfill 
the planned installed capacity pal for 1957, it will be necessary 
to import 61 percent of the necessary generating equipment. 
In the past 2 years the Chinese Communist government has 
conducted the training of 11,000 skilled workers for the power in-
dustry in 12 technical schools, and 10,000 additional workers are 
to be trained during the course of the Five Year Plan. 
4. Coal. 
Communist China's coal industry appears to be capable of 
meeting the needs of domestic consumers, including the armed forces, 
through 1960. This capacity is expected to be achieved by under-
taking 179 above-norm coal-mining construction-projects and an un-
known number of below-norm projects. The large projects include the 
construction of 31 enterprises, each of which is designed to produce 
more than 1 million tons of coal a year. Planned output of coal by 
the end of 1957 is expected to be about 50 million tons greater than 
that of 1952, then amounting to 113 million tons. 77/ Table 31 shows 
the reported and estimated production of coal for the years 1952-60.

During the first Five Year Plan, the Chinese Communists 
plan to install 11 new modern coal-washing plants, with a total 
planned capacity of 17 million tons of washed raw coal a year, in 
order to improve the quality of coking coal needed by the' metal-
lurgical industry for the production of metallurgical coke. 721 
These plants are expected to be in production by 1958, thus greatly 
increasing the volume of washed coal available for coking for 
metallurgical use. 
5. Ferrous Metals. 
The capacity for production of pig iron in Communist 
China is to be increased by 2.8 million tons and crude steel by 
2.53 million tons during the current Five Year Plan. When all 
metallurgical projects, either completed or started before the 
end of 1957, have been put into operation, total capacity for pro-
duction of pig iron is expected to be increased by 5.75 million 
tons and crude steel by 6.1 million tons per year. 79/ 
The major emphasis in the ferrous metals field will be 
placed on the further expansion of the An-shan Iron and Steel Works, 
which is scheduled to complete 48 projects of construction and 
rehabilitation during 1953 to 1960. The increased productive capacity 
of the plant will enable it to produce annually 2.5 million tons 
of pig iron, 3.22 million tons of crude steel, and 2.48 million tons 
of rolled steel. .1E22/ Construction of the Wu-han and Pao-t'ou iron 
and steel centers also will begin during the first Five Year Plan. 
In addition, reconstruction and expansion work to be completed 
before 1957 will be conducted at the Chungking Steel Plant, Tientsin 
Steel Works, Tiang-shan Steel Works, Pen-ch'i Iron and Steel Company, 
Ma-an-shan Iron Works, and Lung-yen Iron Works. Lil/ Table 32* 
presents the estimated production of ferrous metals for the years 
1952-60. 
The raw material resources of Communist China are esti-
mated to be adequate to support an iron and steel industry much 
larger than the one planned for 1960. Improvement in the quality 
of raw materials and in technology has been responsible for pro-
duction gains and improved quality of pig iron and crude steel. 
The quality of finished steel, although somewhat dependent on whether 
emphasis is on increased tonnage or quality, apparently is improving.

6. Nonferrous Metals. 
The major emphases on nonferrous metals during the cur-
rent Five Year Plan are the stress on geological surveying for new 
ore deposits and the expansion and mechanization of existing mines, 
smelters, and refineries. The most important construction project 
now under way is at the Ko-chiu Tin Mine (Yunnan Province), which 
is the largest tin producer and supplies about 80 percent of total 
tin output in Communist China. 2'12/ 
Assuming that extensive geological surveying is con-
tinued throughout Communist China and that the current influx of 
Soviet Bloc material and technical assistance in the field of mining 
and prospecting is continued, it is estimated that Communist China 
by 1960 will be self-sufficient in the production of fluorspar, salt, 
pyrites, and possibly lead and that it will continue to have sub-
stantial export surpluses of tin, antimony, and mercury but will 
continue to be dependent on imports of copper and aluminum. With 
the possible exceptions of copper, aluminum, and tin, the quality 
of most nonferrous metal products is considered to be about standard. 
Estimated production of nonferrous metals in Communist China is 
shown in Table 33.* 
7. Petroleum. 
On 6 July 1955, Li Fu-ch'un, Chairman of the National 
Planning Commission, in his presentation of the Five Year Plan an-
nounced that "current production of the petroleum industry is very 
low, falling far below actual needs." 83/ Estimated production of 
crude petroleum and shale oil in 1954 was 790,000 tons, whereas 
estimated demand was approximately 1.7 million tons, thus forcing 
Communist China to import about 1 million tons from the Soviet Bloc. 
The Five Year Plan goal for production of crude petroleum 
recently was reported to be set at approximately 2 million tons by 
the end of 1957. This goal is believed to be doubtful of achieve-
ment, although not impossible, because it would require doubling the 
present estimated refining capacity within the next 2 years, which 
indeed seems to be the plan. There are still no indications, how-
ever, that Communist China will be self-sufficient in the production 
of refined petroleum at least before 1960. Table 34** shows the esti-
mated and projected production of petroleum products for 1952_60. XXX

8. Chemicals. 
The ever-increasing industrial and agricultural demand 
for chemicals in Communist China apparently is planned to be met 
primarily by the expanding production of existing plant facilities 
and by imports rather than by the construction of completely new 
plants. This expansion seem to be centered in the Northeast and 
East China, where most of Communist China's chemical fertilizer and 
industrial chemical production facilities are located. The Chinese 
Communists have announced that by 1960 the capacity for production 
of chemical fertilizer is to be increased to 910,000 tons per 
year. Li-/ It is estimated that about 600,000 tons of this capacity 
will be devoted to the production of ammonium sulfate. L12/ 
Soviet assistance will also be rendered in expanding 
the rubber and pharmaceutical industries. According to the announced 
Five Year Plan, 4 rubber plants will be reconstructed and I con-
structed in the Northeast, North China, and East China. In con-
junction with the development of the rubber industry, 1 carbon 
black plant will be constructed in the Southwest and 1 in the North-
east. In the pharmaceutical industry, Soviet assistance will be 
instrumental in the designing and building of 2 pharmaceutical 
plants, 1 in the Northeast and the other in the North of China. 86/ 
Table 35* shows the estimated production of selected chemical and 
rubber products for 1952-60. 
The quality of chemical and rubber products has been 
the target of much criticism, and special emphasis is now being 
placed on improving the quality of these products. 
9. Cement. 
By the end of 1957, cement production is to be increased 
to about 6 million tons per year. Lq/ This goal probably will be 
overfulfilled by about 400 thousand tons primarily because of the 
capacity increases planned for 1955-57. As a result, the cement 
industry will be able to meet the increasing domestic demands for 
cement throughout the current Five Year Plan. Production of cement 
has been increased rapidly through more efficient operating methods, 
but at the same time the general level of quality of the cement pro-
duced has deteriorated. Table 36** shows the reported and estimated 
production of cement for 1952-60.

industry including textiles are given in Table 37.* The diffi-

dustry are shown by the official figures for output in the years 
1952 to 1955. The gross value of output of textiles and other 
light industry commodities is claimed to have increased by 28 
percent in 1953 over 1952, but the increase dropped to 15 per-
cent in 1954 over 1953. The real crisis in inc.reasing production 
of light industry, however, is shown by the increase slated for

This sharp decline in the growth of light industry is due primarily 
to the shortage of cotton, tobacco, and other agricultural raw ma-
terials. According to figures given by Chia To-fu, Minister of 
Light Industry, in connection with the announcement of the Five Year 
Plan, the rate of utilization of equipment in 1954 was less than 
one-third for tobacco and match plants, about 50 percent among oil 
and fats plants and flour mills, and about 60 percent among leather 
plants. In state-owned textile mills the rate of utilization in 
1954 was claimed to be 96 percent but was to drop to 76 percent in 
1955 because of the poor cotton crop in 1954. In the light.of 
this limitation on output of light industry and the official pre-
disposition against increasing imports of raw materials for con-
sumer goods industries, the small amount of investment in light 
industry as against heavy industry is understandable. 
The greatest emphasis in the food-processing industries 
is given to machine-made sugar and -- presumably to secure added 
exports -- to meat processing. Of 34 big new food-processing enter-
prises scheduled for the first Five Year Plan, 18 are sugar re-
fineries and 9 are meat-packing plants. Oil-extracting and flour 
plants already are said to be operating at half of capacity and 
little emphasis is being given to investment in these industries. L/ 
The slow rate of annual increases projected for 1955 to 1957 is 
obvious from the production estimates in Table 37.* 
Absolute decreases in output of cotton yarn, gunny bags, 
and cigarettes for 1955 compared with 1954 highlight the impact of 
the shortage of agricultural raw materials. Chia To-fuTs speech 90/ 
specifically stated that the large increase in the output of con-
sumer goods in 1953 was due to the bumper harvest of crops in 1952 
and that the flood in 1954 would have a serious impact on output of 
light industry in 1955. A serious situation was admitted with re-
spect to the quality of output of light industry, 21/ obviously one 
of the costs of the production increases given in Table 37.

economic and population centers as Mukden, Peiping, Shanghai, Hankow, 
and Canton. The industrial region in the Northeast is particularly 
well served by internal transport routes. New route construction 
into western areas, presently served largely by primitive means of 
transport, is being increasingly emphasized in an attempt to develop 
unexploited resources and increase the effectiveness of central 
government control. 
Since the Communists gained control of the China 
mainland in 1949, transport service as a factor of demand has shown 
marked increases in performance, paralleling to a great extent the 
growth of the industrial sector of the economy. By 1954, total 
traffic of tons originated was indicated to be more than double the 
1950 performance. 
By 1953 railway traffic had equaled the annual rate of 
ton-kilometer performance of the previous peak year of 1945 under the 
Japanese. Inland water traffic, although increasing at a rate greater 
than railroad traffic, had reached a level only somewhat less than 
half previous peak performance by 1954. By 1960 this deficiency is 
expected to be overcome. 
Highway transport remains of little significance in 
terms of total transport performance. It is, however, quite sig-
nificant in the long-haul mOvement of goods in the western provinces, 
as is indicated by the growing volume of traffic carried annually. 
Civil air transport has not yet attained previous levels of perfor-
mance. The probable addition of new air routes to adjacent countries 
of Southeast Asia and the prospective acquisition of better perform-
ing Soviet aircraft, however, are expected to facilitate progress 
in the future. Despite the disruption of regular coastal services 
which followed the Communist acquisition of control over China, 
Chinese merchant marine performance has grown considerably, although 
as yet the fleet remains well below pre-Communist levels. NeVer-
theless, the basic reorientation of China's foreign trade toward the 
Soviet Bloc, accompanied by an increased use of railroads for foreign 
trade and the disruption of regular services in the Formosa Straits, 
is likely to impede the growth of Chinese coastal shipping. 
The growing performance of Communist China's transport 
system since the Communists gained control of the government has been 
the product of many factors -- a growing demand for the service, in-
creasing investments, and greater operating efficiency. Outstanding 
among these have been the. increasing requirements generated by the

industrialization program, without which transport performance could 
not progress. 
b. Rail. 
(1) Pattern and Adequacy of Operations. 
Railroads in Communist China especially have borne 
the burden of increasing economic activity, particularly in industrial 
areas. Manchuria, with about 9 percent of China's area, has more than 
half of the rail mileage and originates far more traffic per capita 
than the remainder of China. The Peiping - Tientsin area and the 
regions around Tsingtao, Shanghai, Hankow, and Canton are also im-
portant, but most of China as yet generates little rail traffic. 
As is evident, Chinese rail operations consist 
largely of the movement of a few bulk commodities from a relatively 
small number of places of origin to a few principal destinations. 
Coal, the largest single item shipped, comprises about one-third of 
total tonnage. Foodstuffs are also a major traffic commodity, fol-
lowed by metals, construction materials, wood, and ores. Iron and 
steel products such as plates and rails are becoming of increasing 
importance, whereas petroleum, in contrast to the situation in most 
other nations, is still a relatively minor item. 
It is readily apparent that the Chinese have em-
barked on a major program of construction. It is noteworthy, more-
over, that in view of the large commitments of capital resources 
necessary to implement such a program, more than 20 percent of total 
railroad investment during the Five Year Plan is to be devoted to 
the manufacture of rolling stock and motive power. This apparently 
large-size allocation is testimony of the progressively tightening 
freight car and locomotive situation in China as well as of an in-
tention to prevent its becoming a brake on economic growth. Based  
on 
 Chinese Communist announcements, it is 
estimated that in 1954 the Chinese possessed some 3,420 locomotives, 
6,300 passenger cars, and 73,000 freight cars. 92/ 
(2) Investment.

21,700 kilometers (km) of operable railroad line, they have allocated

a large part of the available investment resources to the expansion 
of the rail system and to bolstering existing facilities. Consider-
able progress has been made. By the end of 1955, about 25,500 km 
of track will be operable, and plans call for construction of 
3,100 km more by the end of 1957. 
During the Five Year Plan, 5.67 billion yuan, 
or about 70 percent of the new capital investment in transport and 
telecommunications, is to be allocated for rail transport. Of 
this, 2.4 billion yuan is to be used in new line construction, with 
the major part of this effort being concentrated in the western 
provinces of China. Extension of the rail system into regions 
hitherto inadequately served by modern transport apparently is 
designed mainly to exploit undeveloped economic resources and to 
a lesser extent to provide more effective political control over 
greater areas of population. In addition, it will enlarge the 
logistic capability of the railroads and significantly add to the 
total length of operable track by 1960. 93/ 
A prime example of this effort is the construc-
tion of the 2,800-km section of track begun in 1953, which is to 
extend westward from Lanchou, via Yumen and Urumchi, to the Chinese 
border, where it will connect with a line from Alma-Ata on the 
Turkestan-Siberian railroad. In 1956, at the present rate of prog-
ress, the line is expected to reach Yumen and to be in a position to 
facilitate the more rapid exploitation of petroleum resources in the 
area. 2V The new line connecting Pao-t'ou in Inner Mongolia with 
the Trans-Siberian, across Outer Mongolia, was completed in 1955. 
A great deal of the construction effort also 
has been directed toward strengthening the established rail system. 
During the Five Year Plan, 1.85 billion yuan is to be allocated for 
improvement of existing lines. According to the 1954 railroad 
plan, 22/ 50 percent of the funds invested by the state for rail-
roads were to be used to strengthen existing installations of the 
railroads and to add new wagons and locomotives. Line increases on 
dxisting installations in 1954 were reported to total 280 km. 96/ 
In 1955 the size and number of such projects were to be greatly 
increased. On three lines alone) an aggregate of 240 km of double-
tracking was to be completed, and another 2,700 km were to be either 
surveyed or designed for similar construction.

(3) Operating Efficiency. 
Since the Communists gained control over the China 
mainland in 1949, the railroads have shown progressive gains in per-
formance, consistent with the requirements of a growing economy. By 
1953, turnaround time was reduced from 4.7 to 4 days, where it has 
apparently leveled off. By 1954 the average tons loaded per loaded 
car had reached 31.6, an increase of 3.3 tons over 1950. 21/ The 
significance of this achievement is apparent when it is realized that 
the increase in the average carload of coal by 1.3 tons in 1954 over 
1953 was equivalent to loading, on the average, an additional 6,500 
tons in 24 hours. 98/ 
By 1953, freight traffic more than tripled the 
performance of 1949, when traffic was at an estimated low of 48.2 
million tons originated on account of economic and political dis-
organization following the civil war. As of 1954, when tons origi-
nated reached an estimated 183 million, however, there were indica-
tions that the railroads were operating under an increasing strain, 
which might soon become acute for both the economic and military 
sectors of China. 22/ 
Whereas the magnitude of annual increases in 
terms of tonnage has been growing, the proportionate growth during 
recent years has become smaller. Tons originated have fallen from 
a 20-percent increase in 1953 over 1952 to a planned 13.6-percent 
Increase in 1955 over 1954. Progress in reducing turnaround tine 
is not likely to continue, but tons loaded per loaded car should con-
tinue to increase somewhat, chiefly because of the increased intro-
duction of.larger capacity freight cars. These trends suggest that 
the Chinese apparently have reached a definite turning point in the 
development of railroad transport. Further appreciable progress by 
the railroads can be accomplished only through a program of addi-
tional capital investment, designed to increase both physical route 
capacity and the availability of rolling stock and motive power. 100/ 
c. Highways  
(1) Pattern and Adequacy of Operations. 
Motor transport in Communist China is used most 
frequently for short-distance, intercity freight movement. Highway 
transport performance in 1954 increased almost sevenfold over 1950.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
The extent of progress in road transport is indicated by the fact 
that its share of total tons originated by all carriers in China 
has grown from about 6 percent in 1950 to over 16 percent in 1954, 
and performance by 1960 should be at a level 3 times that of 1954. 
The road network was expanded from 78,000 km 
in 1950 to 140,000 km by the end of 1954, mainly by extending new 
motorable roads into areas formerly served only by coolie and animal 
transport. 101/ At present the greater part of this road net is 
not capable of supporting truck traffic throughout the year. 
Motor transport also has greatly facilitated 
the .growth of commercial centers in rural areas not served directly 
by rail or waterways. New feeder roads which join many scattered 
farming communities to the transport network have facilitated the 
marketing of commodities previously dependent dn animal and coolie 
carriers. Construction of new roads into border areas as well as 
in mining and industrial regions is expected to bring the total 
highway length in China to 158,000 km by 1960. 
Increasing the vehicle park has also been a 
prime goal which has met with considerable success. Mainly as a 
result of large imports of vehicles from the Soviet Bloc, the 
motor truck inventory has grown from 40,000 units in 1950 to some 
67,000 units in 1954. 102/ Moreover, the continued import of 
vehicles from similar sources, coupled with domestic manufacture 
beginning in 1957, is expected to bring the total truck park to 
150,000 units by the end of 1960. 103/ 
(2) Investment. 
It is estimated that, during the Five Year Plan, 
about 900 million yuan of the allocation to the Ministry of Com-
munications will be used for highway construction. In addition, 
a major share of the 730 mi1lion yuan allocated for "local communica-
tions" is to be used in local highway construction. The 1955 plan 
provides for the survey and construction of an additional 23 roads, 
mainly in industrial and mining areas or into national minority 
regions. 104/ These projects will add 4,500 km to China's highway 
network during 1955. 105/ Some idea of investment in inventory can 
be obtained from the plan to produce domestically 4,000 vehicles 
by 1957. 106/

(3) Operating Efficiency. 
The efficient utilization of highway transport 
is hampered to a large extent by physical restrictions such as low-
capacity bridges, numerous ferries, and inadequate road construction 
and maintenance. Lack of adequately trained personnel also has 
been a problem. Although the technological innovations necessary 
to overcome physical limitations have not been forthcoming to an 
appreciable degree, 107/ considerable effort has been directed toward 
reducing inefficient hauling. Provincial transport companies were 
established under the central control of the government, and a 
rigid system of traffic control was introduced to allocate trucking 
properly. 108/ Administrative reorganization, coupled with the 
introduction of heavier loading vehicles, undoubtedly resulted in 
some improvement, but commodity distribution is such that trucks 
are still required to operate empty more than half the time. 
The need for more technically trained personnel 
was realized by the Chinese Communists as early as 1952, 109/ but 
the building of adequate training facilities, for the most part, is 
still in the planning phase. Technical advice provided in many 
cases by the USSR, however, overcomes this deficiency to some extent. 
d. Inland Water. 
(1) Pattern and Adequacy of Operations. 
Inland water operations have steadily improved 
since the Communists assumed control of China. Freight movement, 
in terms of ton-kilometers, was four times greater in 1954 than in 
1950, and tons originated grew at a somewhat greater rate because 
of a progressively decreasing average length of haul. 110/ River 
traffic has not, however, yet approached prewar levels. Continued 
emphasis on this medium of transport and the consequent gains en-
visioned should bring performance close to prewar levels by 1960, 
when it is estimated that some 48 million tons of cargo will be 
originated. Nevertheless, with the constantly growing role of the 
railroads, it is considered that inland water transport will never 
again be as important to China in terns of percentage of total 
traffic as it was in the 1930's.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
In general, inland water transport in China ful-
fills its usual role of carrying bulk cargoes where speed is not of 
major importance. The inland waterway system of China is one of 
the most extensive in the world, with about 95,000 km of inland water-
way routes now open to navigation, although most are suitable only for 
shallow draft vessels. 111/ The essentially local nature of the traf-
fic is demonstrated by the average length of haul of the modern water 
transport sector of only 370 km in 1954, despite the great length of 
such main routes as the Yangtze River. Inclusion of local junk traf-
fic which on the extensive Yangtze system carries 85 percent of the 
traffic would lower the average length of haul considerably. 
The composition of waterway traffic is shifting 
from agricultural cargoes, which are becoming relatively less im-
portant though still significant, to industrial traffic, which has 
been increasing. Between 1951 and 1953, for example, agricultural 
cargoes accounted for over half of the freight movement on the 
Yangtze River, but decreased from 4o to 30 percent of the total 
inland waterway traffic in Communist China. 112/ 
Little change in the composition of the river 
fleet has occurred since the Chinese Communists came to power. The 
self-propelled fleet remains small, both actually and relatively, 
and is estimated to total about 750. vessels, 113/ ranging from 
4,000 gross register tons (GRT) passenger-cargo vessels to smaller 
tugs and steam launches. The nonpowered fleet still consists mainly 
of a great number of small junks, which, in the aggregate, have a 
freight capacity of over 3 million tons and account for about 85 
percent of the total inland water transport. 114/ On the Yangtze 
River, especially, tug-barge units are replacing to some extent the 
traditional junk on longer haul routes. 
(2) Investment. 
The Communist regime has developed an impressive 
program for the rehabilitation and improvement of its inland water-
ways. Of the 1.339 billion yuan allocated to the Ministry of Com-
munications for capital investment during the Five Year Plan it is 
estimated that about 440 million yuan is for water transport, but 
the allocation to inland water transport cannot be determined specifi-
cally. Appropriations for waterway construction in 1954 were 74 per-
cent higher than in the previous year and reportedly will increase 
by 35 percent in 1955. 115/

Before 1954, relatively little investment in 
vessels was devoted to new vessel construction, most of the invest-
ment going for the purchase of second-hand craft, salvage work, and 
rehabilitation of the existing fleet. Since 1954, however, more 
emphasis has been placed on new construction. 
The Yangtze River apparently is receiving par-
ticular attention. Appropriations for construction projects on 
this river in 1953 were four times the 1952 amount, 116/ and planned 
investment during 1955 is scheduled to increase about 70 percent 
over the 1954 level. 117/ 
Significantly, the Chinese Communist government, 
in an effort to reduce its-own burden, has decided that local 
authorities must finance inland water transport improvements. The 
directive to this effect issued in November 1953 by Chou En-lai 118/ 
does not seem to have brought the desired results, however, for 
local officials apparently still are relying on the central ad-
ministration for required funds. 
(3) Operating Efficiency. 
Chinese Communist statements claim sharp rises 
in the operating efficiency of the river fleet. Voyage time has 
been greatly reduced, in some instances from one-third to one-half, 
by operating vessels on scheduled runs. The efficiency of tugs has 
been improved by the substitution of the pushing method for the tra-
ditional means of towing of barges, with a resultant increase in 
speed and decrease in fuel consumption. 119/ Barge transport 
efficiency has been further improved by routing the barges through 
the entire voyage, instead of transshipping cargo several times. 
Labor productivity also appears to be improving, 
although shortages of trained personnel persist. Efforts are being 
made to reduce administrative duplication and organize traffic 
operations more efficiently. Remarkable improvement is claimed in 
some areas in cargo-handling efficiency 120/ through the use of 
mechanical equipment in place of manual operations. 121/ 
In addition to increasing the efficiency of water 
transport, the Chinese have directed some effort to making the cost of 
river transport more attractive to shippers. Substantial reductions.

status of inland water transport. 122/ 
e. Coastal Shipping. 
(1) Pattern and Adequacy of Operations. 
Despite the irregularities and disruptions in 
Communist China's coastal trade, traffic carried in Chinese vessels 
during 1954 123/ represented an eightfold increase over 1950. .124/ 
The growth of merchant shipping since 1949, however, has been ham-
pered by the extensive loss of merchant shipping tonnage to the 
Nationalists and the radical shift in international trade routes 
from sea to rail through the northeast, which accompanied the re-
orientation of China's foreign trade toward the Soviet Bloc. 
Additions to the coastal fleet, coupled with 
continuing efforts to increase its utilization, are expected to 
raise performance by 1960 to roughly 50 percent above the 1954 
level. 
Operations of Communist China's ocean fleet are 
confined to serving the domestic coastal trade. Chinese Nationalist 
interdiction of coastal shipping activity has diminished and is at 
present effective only in the Taiwan Strait area. In the Yellow 
Sea and the Gulf of Chihli (Po Hai) the Chinese Communists are able 
to operate unobstructed trunk and feeder passenger and freight routes 
servicing all coastal ports north of Wenchow. The largest segment 
of the coastal fleet is concentrated in this area, and a smaller 
segment of the coastal fleet operates from Canton in South China to 
Swatow and ports in the Liuchow Peninsula-Hainan Island area. 
The domestic operations of the powered merchant 
fleet are considerably augmented by a large number of small ocean-
going junks and, to a limited extent, by chartered foreign shipping. 
The Chinese Communists are completely dependent upon foreign registered 
vessels, both Bloc and non-Bloc, for longer international waterborne 
trade. 
Apparently the available Chinese Communist fleet, 
augmented by specialized foreign registered vessels, is able to handle 
present tonnage requirements. BetVreen 1950 and 1954, with salvage

efforts, foreign purchase, and new construction the Chinese Communist 
merchant fleet increased from about 79 vessels of 175,000 GRT to about 
111 units of 278,000 GRT. 125/ The coastal fleet had grown by mid-
1955 to some 120 vessels of 295,000 GRT. A fleet of 350,000 to 400,000 
GRT by 1960 is believed to be within Chinese capabilities, but this 
would still be less than half the size of the merchant tonnage possessed 
by the Nationalist Chinese in 1949. 
Communist China has few good harbors. Dairen, 
Tientsin - Taku - Hsin-k'ang, Tsingtao, Shanghai, Swatow, and Canton 
Whampoa, which combined can discharge some 115,000 tons daily, 
possess 66 percent of the total cargo-handling capacity of Chinese 
ports. Yin-k'ou, Ch'in-huang-tao, Yen-t'ai, Yin-hsien, Wenchow, 
Foochow, Amoy, Fort Bayard (Chan-chiang), Hai-Mou, and Yu-lin, all 
of relatively minor size, are important as terminals of domestic 
coastal trade. Amoy and Foochow, opposite Taiwan, are currently of 
singular importance a6 possible staging areas for an offshore island 
offensive against the Nationalist Chinese. 
(2) Investment. 
Investment in China's merchant marine -service 
apparently has been devoted in large part to modernizing the exist-
ing fleet and to improving port facilities. In 1954 the government 
allocated nearly 10 million yuan to increase port mechanization 126/ 
in a significant attempt to replace less efficient cargo-handling 
procedures. 
(3) Operating Efficiency. 
A comparison of the growth indexes for the mer-
chant marine inventory and its performance show that great strides 
have been made in increasing the utilization of the coastal fleet. 
Efforts have been directed toward a more efficient use of labor by 
the mechanization of cargo handling at ocean terminals and bSr closer 
supervision of traffic operations. 127/ The consistent fulfillment 
of performance plans, in some cases by substantial margins, indicates 
progress in this direction inasmuch as targets apparently are inte-
grated with plans for increasing efficiency.

f. Air. 
(1) Pattern and Adequacy of Operations. 
Air transport in Communist China as yet plays a 
very limited role in freight movement, but it is important in the 
movement of officials and high-value, low-tonnage cargo. Despite 
the acquisition in 1955 of the latest transport types (I1-12's and 
I1-14's) from the USSR, air transport operations are limited. 
During 1954 the unduplicated basic civil air 
network of Communist China comprised approximately 15,700 route kilo-
meters flown by two airlines -- CPAC* and the Sino-Soviet enterprise, 
SKOGA.** 128/ With the withdrawal of the USSR from SKOGA at the 
end of 1954, the Chinese undertook to fly the entire network. Flights 
radiate from Peiping via Hankow or Sian to Chungking, Kunming, 
Nan-ning, Canton, and Shanghai. There are routes to the USSR via 
Sinkiang Province and Mongolia to Irkutsk and Alma-Ata. 
The inventory of the Chinese civil air fleet, 
composed of various types of craft acquired from diverse sources, is 
still well below pre-Communist levels. By the withdrawal of the USSR 
from joint ownership in SKOGA, the Chinese obtained the 15 Li-2 air-
craft provided by the USSR as its share in the company. The civilian 
fleet -- consisting of these aircraft, the existing CPAC fleet, air-
craft abandoned by the Nationalists, and additionally acquired Li-2's 
totaled about 50 2-engine transports in mid-1955, a considerable re-
duction over the 92 aircraft, some of which were 4-engine types, avail-
able in 1948. The regularization of civil air operations throughout 
the Bloc has led to the Chinese acquisition of new Soviet aircraft, 
probably the better performing I1-14. 
(2) Investment. 
During the Five Year Plan, 101 million yuan are to be 
invested in civil aviation. The end use of this allocation cannot be 
determined, but some money will be spent for additions to equipment. 
Equipment received from the USSR following its withdrawal from SKOGA 
reportedly is being paid for on a long-term basis. The requirement for 
new aircraft which will accompany expected route expansion will doubt-
less be met by the same source and on similar terms.

(3) Operating Efficiency. 
Operating efficiency of civil air transport in 
Communist China is believed to have suffered by the conflict in 
ideologies between the US-trained managerial group that defected 
from the Nationalists and the Soviet-influenced Peiping organization. 
2. Telecommunications. 
Telecommunications facilities in Communist China are con-
centrated in the most industrialized and densely populated eastern 
part of the country, with Peiping as the hub. Industry and govern-
ment consume about 80 percent of the basic telephone and telegraph 
service. 
Postal volume has been increasing about 12 percent a 
year and probably will continue this rate of increase. Although 
25 percent of the country reportedly lacked postal service in 1954, 
at the anticipated rate of expansion it is estimated that all of 
Communist China will have postal service by 1960. 
Expansion of communications is being approached with 
energy and determination, but there are still many deficiencies 
which must be overcome before an adequate plant is established. 
Although during the Five Year Plan 361 million yuan are allocated 
to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, this sum does not 
appear, adequate to provide for the announced expansion program. 
Communist China still has to import over 80 percent of her needed 
equipment, and there is a deficiency of managerial and technical 
personnel. Although some sectors of the communications system will 
have shown a large growth by 1960, communications facilities in 
Communist China still will require improvement in order to serve the 
economy adequately.

V. Foreign Trade and Economic Relations. 
The foreign trade of Communist China has been constantly increas-
ing with the countries in the Sino-Soviet Bloc. In 1950, 25 percent 
of the total Chinese trade was with the Bloc, and by 1954 the figure 
had risen to 80 percent. The Chinese Communists announced that to-
tal exports and imports in 1954 amounted in value to 8.47 billion yuan 
and in volume to over g million tons. 129/ Based on this reported 
amount of foreign trade, Table 38 and Figure 7* have been prepared 
from announcements by the Chinese.**

** In the absence of US-Communist China trade and currency remittances 
carried on directly in yuan and US dollars, there is no genuine rate of 
foreign exchange between the two currencies for trade purposes. The rate 
of exchange used to convert the yuan value of Communist China's foreign 
trade into US dollars is the average between the buying and selling rates 
for sterling remittances in Canton. The sterling rate is consistent 
with the remittance rate for other Free World currencies in Canton. Use 
of this sterling cross-rate permits conversion of yuan into dollars 
through a currency which actually is exchanged directly into Chinese yuan.

The import surplus of $500 million shown in Table 38 arose primarily 
because trade with the USSR showed an imbalance against Communist 
China. It is probable that during 1954 Communist China imported mili-
tary equipment from the USSR which was financed by a loan of as much 
as $500 million. 131/ Trade with the European Satellites resulted in 
a Chinese import surplus of about $50 million, reflecting the settle-
ment of previous balances in China's favor. Exports to Far Eastern 
members of the Bloc consisted of trade items (25 percent) and mili-
tary and economic aid (75 percent) furnished by Communist China to 
North Korea and the Viet Minh. 132/ 
Chinese Communist exports continue to reflect the predominance of 
agriculture and the extractive industries in China's economy. Indus-
trial production such as pig iron, cement, and light manufactures 
provides a small surplus for export, but most industrial output is 
returned to the domestic economy. The Chinese announced that in 1954 
the export of light industrial products amounted to about $60 million. 133/ 
The Chinese Communist claims that 88.5 percent of total imports 
in 1954 consisted of products for industrial and agricultural produc-
tion 134/ reflect the avowed policy of restricting consumer goods 
imporTT-In order to maximize the rate of industrialization. This 
claim, however, omits reference to military goods, which probably are 
concealed in the industrial products category. 
The Chinese Communists reported that during the first 8 months of 
1955, total foreign trade increased nearly 13 percent over the compar-
able period in 1954. The increase with non-Bloc nations was reported 
to be 23 percent, whereas the increase with Sino-Soviet Bloc nations 
was slightly more. than 10 percent. 135/ 
The estimate of Communist China's foreign trade through 1960 de-
pends on the export potential. If the recent growth rate (1952-54) 
in total trade of 8 percent per year were maintained, the value of 
trade in 1957 would total $4,400 million and in 1960, $5,400 million. 
The Chinese Communists have announced, however, that trade in 1957 
will increase 67 percent over the 1952 (yuan) value of trade. 136/ 
Considering the possibilities of increasing production and marketing 
of exportable surpluses in conjunction with the Five Year Plan trade 
goal, a reasonable average rate of growth is believed to be 4 percent, 
which is more in line with the 1954 increase in trade. The value of 
trade in 1960, at this rate of growth, would total $4,300 million.

Communist China carries on approximately 80 percent of its trade 
with the Soviet Bloc, 53 percent with the USSR alone, and depends 
almost entirely on the Bloc for its essential imports of industrial 
and military products. As Communist China's planned annual require-
ments of industrial equipment amount to only about 0.5 percent of the 
Soviet GNP or 1.5 percent of Soviet production of industrial equip-
ment, it is probable that the USSR could supply most of these goods 
without difficulty. In any event, the phasing of these requirements 
over a period of years allows the USSR to make provision for the 
requirements in its plans. Recent trends suggest that Soviet food 
imports from China are more likely to grow rather than diminish. 
The USSR granted Communist China loans of $60 million per year 
for 5 years beginning in 1950, to be repaid in 10 annual installments 
beginning in 1954. Since 1953, several assistance agreements with 
the USSR have been concluded by Communist China to increase the aid 
begun in 1950 and to assure the continued flow of capital goods. In 
addition to the Soviet technical assistance agreements, the USSR in 
1954 agreed to extend loans to China totaling $130 million. 137/ The 
Soviet unwillingness to extend larger credits undoubtedly influences 
the scope of the Chinese Communist Five Year Plan, although this is 
fundamentally determined by the Chinese Communists' own capabilities. 
Nevertheless, if the USSR does not extend sufficient credit to satisfy 
China, then China may be tempted to seek Free World credit. In 
general, however, China now appears to be satisfied with present 
Bloc assistance and, in turn, has even undertaken to extend aid to 
North Korea and the Viet Minh. 
Some shift away from trade with the Bloc may be expected if trade 
controls are relaxed. If Free World and Bloc prices of industrial 
equipment are compared, however, it appears that Communist China's 
terms of trade with the Free World during 1950-54 in general would 
have been but slightly more advantageous than trade with the Bloc. 
The elimination of trade controls, therefore, would not result in an 
important diversion of Chinese trade from the Soviet Bloc to the 
Free World because of price differentials. 
Communist China's total trade with the Free World has declined 
steadily from $965 million in 1951 to $690 million in 1954. On a 
physical volume basis, however, trade dropped sharply in 1951 and 
then began to increase. As the total trade of Communist China in-
creases, it is likely that trade with the Free World also will main-
tain an upward trend. In 1954, Communist China's major non-Bloc

trading partners, in terms of total value of trade turnover, were the 
UK (including Hong Kong), Japan, Ceylon, West Germany, and Pakistan. 
The goods provided by these countries were such items as basic chemi-
cals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, raw textiles, rubber, coconut oil, 
paper products, textile machinery, and some manufactured goods. Al-
though the prospects for increasing trade seem to be favorable, the 
stories of tremendous trade opportunities between Communist China and 
the Free World, and especially with Japan, are perhaps misleading. 
The Japanese have estimated that this trade probably could be increased 
from the 1954 high of $60 million to a total value of only $140 mil-
lion by 1957. The Japanese demands would conflict to only a limited 
extent with Communist China's domestic and Bloc requirements, but 
the continuation of Japanese controls on many capital goods exports 
to Communist China will tend to hamper the growth of this trade. If 
trade controls are relaxed, there is a possibility that Sino-Japanese 
trade relations would show the biggest gains because Japan is a ready 
market for Chinese exports (rice, soybeans, coal, iron ore, and salt) 
and Communist China is interested in obtaining Japanese machinery, 
metal products, and fertilizers. The major limiting factor over 
such a trade development would be Communist China's ability to increase 
production while maintaining the present volume of exports to the 
Bloc in order to satisfy its trade and aid obligations with its Bloc 
partners. 
The reduction of US controls from complete embargo to CCCOM levels 
would enable Communist China (1) to obtain a net increase in its total 
export volume by exporting to the US commodities that it cannot export 
elsewhere and (2) to obtain better prices for other export products 
owing to the resultant increase in world market demand. Within 2 
years, Communist China possibly could increase its net export earn-
ings by $60 million if it had free access to the US market. 
The European Satellites have contributed less than the USSR to 
the development of Chinese Communist industry, but their help has 
nevertheless been substantial. Exports of industrial items to 
Communist China seem to have had a high priority in the European 
Satellites, particularly in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, and 
Poland, where entire plants have been built for export to Communist 
China. Cranes, excavators, trucks, power generating equipment, diesel 
engines, telecommunications equipment, machine tools, ballbearings, 
and farm and mining machinery are on the list for delivery to Communist' 
China. These goods and equipment are being shipped to Communist China

in fulfillment of barter trade protocols, which are signed each year 
by Communist China with each of the European Satellites. As a result 
of this continuing increase in European Satellite technical aid, it 
is clear that Communist China has been able to fill an important gap 
in its industrialization program caused by the continued shortage of 
its own technical manpower. 
On 23 November 1953, Communist China and North Korea signed a 
10-year economic and cultural cooperation agreement. In 1954, North 
Korea placed a value of 3 trillion "old" yuan (about $125 million) 
on Chinese Communist goods delivered in 1954 under this agreement, 
whereas the value of Soviet material and technical aid to North Korea 
was $105 million.  Chinese Communist 
goods consist of about 45 percent industrial materials (coal, steel, 
construction materials, and transport equipment) and 55 percent con-
sumer goods '(food, clothing, and newsprint). 138/ The estimated value 
of the Chinese Communist aid, however, is estimated to be about $60 mil-
lion to $70 million. 
In 1954, Communist China sent at least 1,825 engineers and tech-
nicians to North Korea to work in various industrial establishments. 
It is estimated that about 65,000 civilian laborers also were sent 
to North Korea. In addition, large numbers of Chinese Communist 
troops were used on land reclamation projects and to rehabilitate 
the North Korean railroad system. 139/ 
North Korean exports to Communist China are limited to minerals, 
marine products, and electricity, the latter being by far the most 
important. During 1946 to 1950, Manchuria was supplied with approxi-
mately 0.9 billion kwh of electricity per year, or one-half of the 
total electric power generated by the Suiho Power Station (1950 
capacity, 400,000 kw). 140/ Assuming that Communist China is still 
receiving approximately one-half of Suiho's electric power output, 
it is possible that in 1956, when Suiho probably will have been 
restored to its 1944 capacity of 600,000 kw, Communist China will 
receive as much as 1.35 billion kwh from North Korea. 
Although the total value of Communist China's aid to North Korea 
in 1954 exceeded that of the USSR, its impact on the North Korean 
economy probably is not so great. It appears that most of the Soviet 
aid is designed for the reconstruction of basic industries, whereas 
the bulk of Communist China's aid is in the form of consumer goods, 
construction materials, and transport facilities.

Most of the foreign trade of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam 
to date has been with Communist China. The total volume of all Chinese 
Communist exports known to have been received by the Viet Minh dur-
ing 1954 is estimated at a minimum of 30,000 tons. Communist China 
has supplied and is supplying the Viet Minh with considerable material 
and technical aid. In December 1954, Communist China promised to 
send the Viet Minh 10,000 tons of rice as well as 5 million meters of 
cloth, 141/ most of which probably have been delivered. In late Decem-
ber 1957The Chinese Communists and the Viet Minh also reached agree-
ment on Chinese assistance in the restoration of transport and communi-
cations lines, postal and communications services, and water conservancy 
projects. 142/ Under the agreement the Chinese Communists were also 
to supply the necessary experts and technicians. 
In the past the most important and significant aid rendered to 
the Viet Minh by the Chinese Communists has been military aid. In 
early 1954 there were indications of increased military aid, estimated 
to be as high as 3,000 to 4,000 tons per month in volume. 143/ 
Chinese Communist and Viet Minh 
violations of the Indochina truce agreement soon after the agreements 
were signed. Between 21 July and 20 August 1954 alone, it is estimated 
that some 3,000 tons of military supplies were shipped to North 
Vietnam from China. 144/ There is evidence that this level of ship-
ments of all goods was maintained during 1955. 
In July 1955, on the occasion of Ho Chi Minh's visit to Peiping, 
it was announced that Communist China was making a gift of 800 million 
Chinese yuan (new currency -- equivalent at the official exchange 
rate to about $338 million) for the reconstruction of railroads, river 
docks, highways, and bridges and for the restoration and construction 
of textile mills, tanneries, papermills, and factories for suoh things 
as medical equipment, electrical equipment, and agricultural imple-
ments. 145/ It also was stated that both countries would "cooperate 
fully with each other on the technical personnel" sent to the Viet 
Minh and that the Viet Minh also would "dispatch workers as appren-
tices to certain enterprises in China." The figure mentioned prob-
ably covers past aid -- at least the aid under the December 1954 
agreements -- as well as present and future aid. The 800-million-
yuan figure, like the similar 1953-57 Chinese Communist grant to 
North Korea for postwar reconstruction, is indicative of the high 
political value placed by Communist China on the rehabilitation and 
orientation of its Far Eastern partners, a project which involves 
the allocation of materials and manpower that could be used in 
China's own development program.

APPENDIX A 
METHODOLOGY 
The estimates of production and of production trends made in this 
report consist first of estimates of physical output of commodities 
or services. Second, with the use of price data, industrial indexes 
by value are calculated, grouping related commodities into larger 
aggregates. Finally, major sectors of the GNP are combined in terms 
of estimated value added for the subsectors. 
I. Production Estimates. 
Production trends for the commodities and services listed in the 
Chinese Communist Five Year Plan for both the official Communist 
figures and the CIA estimates are given in the text and tables of the 
report.* 
A. Agriculture. 
The Five Year Plan presents claimed production for 1952 and 
the 1957 targets for food and technical crops. Miscellaneous crops 
are estimated by cultivated area rather than output. Communist 
claims for total food output are made for 1949-54. Absolute figures 
for food crops (rice, wheat, and soybeans) and for technical crops 
(cotton, tobacco, sugar cane, sugar beets, peanuts, sesame, and 
rapeseed) can be derived from the National Statistical Bureau 
reports for 1953 and 1954. 
Previous CIA estimates of agricultural production were extra-
polated trends from the pre-Communist years. The estimates of the 
output of food crops, particularly, made on this basis are far below 
the Communist claims. It is felt that the pre-Communist estimates 
understated output because of limited statistical coverage. When 
adjustments are made in the light of the probable understatement 
of prewar output, the Communist figures for total output of food 
crops in 1952 are considered reasonable. The trend in the Communist 
series from 1949 to 1952, however, almost certainly involves

increased coverage more than it represents actual increases in pro-
duction, and so a different trend is estimated based on weather 
conditions and other evidences of actual output. The 1954 figures 
for food crops claim an increase of 3 percent over 1952, but this 
trend is considered unlikely in view of the serious floods in 1954. 
The 1954 claims may overstate actual production because of increased 
use of stocks and other factors. An alternative hypothesis would be 
that Communist figures for 1952 are still understatements of actual 
output and the 1954 claimed output represents further statisical 
coverage of the agricultural sector. Within the total for food 
crops it is believed that the claims for wheat output are too low 
and that the output of rice and potatoes is somewhat overstated. 
Estimates of cotton production based on requirements for 
yarn production, estimated rates of home consumption, and estimates 
of native yarn production result in output figures for 1952 that are 
well below the Communist claims and slightly below the Communist 
figure for 1953. The 1949 and 1950 figures in official claims for 
cotton output probably are understated. 
The average annual increase expected in the output of 
food crops is estimated to be about 2 percent a year. The 1955 out-
put of food crops is estimated to be 2 percent over the 1952 level, 
reflecting the floods of 1954 and the unusually favorable crop year 
in 1952. Targets for increases in cotton and other industrial crops 
are more feasible as the percentage of total crop land planted 
to these crops is relatively small and industrial requirements 
probably will lead to priorities in fertilizer and other means of 
increasing production. In the absence of detailed information on 
industrial crops other than cotton, the general trend in cotton 
output is used for this whole category of agricultural output. 
Trends in production of livestock and meat, vegetables, and 
other miscellaneous crops are moved with the food crops index in 
the absence of data that permit separate production indexes for 
these categories. 
B. Industry. 
Estimates of production of industrial commodities have been 
evaluated in the light of known capacity in pre-Communist periods  
and of new plants added since that time

  For the most part, however, Communist production claims, 
though usually somewhat higher than to?,als arrived at by plant-by-
plant study, appear reasonable in view of the likelihood that some 
production capacity has not been covered in plant-by-plant studies  
for the industry concerned. 
  The production series neces-
sarily reflects, in part, improved coverage in statistical reporting 
for the commodities concerned during the period from 1949 to 1954. 
To this extent, indexes based on trends in production of these 
commodities would overstate the industrial growth that actually has 
taken place. 
Projections for production through 1957 are made in the 
light of announced targets for the Chinese Communist Five Year Plan, 
but these targets are evaluated and changed where indicated by pro-
gress of construction projects in the industries concerned. 
II. Industrial Indexes. 
Table 39* presents output indexes for industrial groupings. All 
the indexes shown are based on physical output except weapons, 
petroleum, metals, engineering items, chemicals, and rubber prod-
ucts. In the case of engineering output, an index based on Chinese 
Communist claims for the gross value of output of the machine 
industries is used except for 1950 and 1951. These years were 
interpolated on the basis of physical production trends weighted 
by available 1952 prices and by an estimated breakdown of value 
added within the engineering industries. For 1956 and 1960 the 
estimates are based on the average rate of annual increase between 
1954 and 1957. Indexes of nonferrous metals, ferrous metals 
chemicals, and rubber products were projected by estimated gross 
value of physical output in 1952 prices. Prices for some non-
ferrous metals were estimated in terms of world prices, and for**

some chemicals in terms of comparable price ratios with US prices for 
similar commodities, where Chinese prices were not available. Avail-
able prices for machinery and equipment were limited, but the use of 
a gross value index for machinery and equipment makes such prices 
unnecessary. The petroleum index is based on estimated gross value 
per ton of petroleum products extracted from natural and shale oil 
per ton, including estimates for imported natural crude oil less the 
estimated value of the imported crude. 
III. Sector Indexes. 
An estimate of GNP for Communist China in 1952 at current prices 
is the basis for aggregating industry indexes into major sectors. 
A. Agricultural Sector. 
Income originating in agriculture was obtained by adjusting 
the official figure for gross farm output (49.39 billion yuan) in the 
following manner. Gross agricultural output was revalued in terms 
of estimated price received by farmers, including the value of home 
processing. This estimated value of farm output is about 40 billion 
yuan, 82 percent of the official figure. The higher official valua-
tion is believed to be based on the city price for unprocessed grain 
or on the producer price for the equivalent in processed grain, both 
of which include a transport and trade markup and, in the case of 
market sales, a processing charge as well. 
Estimates of farm consumption of agricultural materials 
(especially feed, seed, and waste) and of materials purchased from 
nonfarm sectors were deducted. 
The estimate of value added in agriculture is described in 
the note to Table 40.* 
B. Nonagricultural Sector. 
Income originating in the nonagricultural sector is presented 
in Table 41** and provides a control figure for income originating in 
industry, construction, trade, transportation, and government (30.33 
billion yuan). A series of independent estimates of the components***

Output and Income for the Agricultural Sector of Communist China 
1952 
(Continued) 
a. Gross agricultural output at farm prices including home processing. This estimate was 
obtained in the following manner: 
1. The value of gross agricultural output (48.39 billion yuan) at unspecified prices, 
broken down between farm and subsidiary output, was obtained from Chinese Communist 
announcements. 
2. The value of food crop production (26.13 billion yuan) at unspecified prices was 
computed on the basis of Communist announcements that taxes on food crops were less than 
7 percent of the value of food crops and less than 13 percent of total gross agricultural 
output. 
3. Food crop output was estimated at 164 million metric tons, in terms of grain 
equivalents. 
4. The ratio of the estimated value of food crop output to the quantity of food crop 
output in metric tons is taken to be the average price of food crops implicit in Communist 
announcements. 
5. This implicit price was compared to data on retail prices and farm procurement 
prices. While a sample of farm procurement prices averages about 65 percent of the city 
retail price, the implicit price is 87 percent of the average percent of the city retail 
price (or 159,300 yuan per metric ton). The price implicit in the Communist announcements 
is probably, therefore, either the city retail price for unprocessed grain or the producer 
price for the equivalent in processed grain and includes both home processing and also 
some transport, distribution, and additional processing costs. 
6. The imputed value of home processing for grain consumed on the farm was assumed 
to be 20 percent of the farm procurement price for grain. On this basis average farm 
prices, including home processing, are about 72 percent of the city retail prices and 
83 percent of the implicit prices given in the Communist figures. Allowing for the fact 
that home processing probably is less important for meat and nonfood crops than for grain,

it was estimated that the average farm price including home processing was about 80 percent 
of the price implicit in Communist announcements. 
7. The gross value of farm output including home processing was, therefore, estimated 
at 80 percent of he value given in Communist announcements. The value of subsidiary income 
in Communist announcements was used without adjustments. 
b. Estimated to be about 14 percent of the value of farm crops at farm procurement prices. 
c. Estimated to be 8 percent of the value of farm and subsidiary output on the basis of a 
study of rural income in Shantung Province. 
d. Rent is estimated to be 5 percent of total farm income and 11 percent of urban income 
on the basis of income and expenditure studies. 
e. Gross farm cash income (10.20 billion yuan) 
(15.42 billion yuan 
less the expenditure of persons classified as ru 
culture (estimated to be 5.42 billion yuan on t 
cash savings of 2 percent. 
f. Taxes on food crops are given as less than 7 percent of gross agricultural output. 
Taxes on all crops are estimated at 9.1 percent of gross output. This estimate exceeds the 
figure for agricultural taxes included in the Chinese Communist budget by more than 1 billion 
yuan, reflecting the difference between the tax accounting price and the farm price used 
for valuing farm output.

The sum of the individual value-added estimates in Table 42 
is 3.5 percent higher than the control figure for those sectors 
presented in Table 41. This difference is of such a small magnitude 
that the value-added estimates lend support to the control figure 
derived from the end-use estimate. 
The sum of computed gross values of industrial commodities 
was 16 percent lower than the official figure for gross industrial 
production. The difference between the sum of the estimates and the 
official figure probably is due for the most part to the fact that 
part of handicrafts output could not be directly measured and that 
the producer prices derived from wholesale prices may have been too 
low. The official figure was therefore accepted as a measure of 
gross industrial output. The independent estimate of value added by 
trade was based on estimated markdowns of available city market 
prices and on a breakdown of expenditures based on data of state 
trading charges as percentages of total net commodity turnover in 
state trade. 
For purposes of weighting indexes of output by sector of 
origin to estimate changes in GNP, the percentages of the total in 
Table 42 were applied against the control figure of 30.33 billion 
yuan. 
Estimates of components of the nonagricultural sector are 
as follows: 
1. Industry. 
Wherever possible, the gross value of output of the 
components of the modern sector was obtained by pricing the physical 
output of industrial commodities and services. Considerable data 
are available on the output of leading commodities in the modern 
industrial sector. These production figures are subject to error 
but are quoted regularly in the Chinese Communist press and in many 
cases can be compared to prewar data and with data on available plant 
facilities. Price quotations for producer goods are fewer and less 
representative than those for agricultural commodities and consumer 
goods. In the case of some metals, world prices were used to deter-
mine the price of domestic output because a substantial portion of 
the output of these metals is exported. Other industrial subgroups 
could not be priced at all, and their gross value had to be estimated 
in indirect ways.

Value added for the various components was obtained in 
three different ways: (1) the direct valuation of wages and other 
factor costs; (2) the deduction of purchases of materials, transport 
services, and the like, from gross value; and (3) the use of pre-
Communist Manchurian analogy. In order to obtain a measure of factor 
cost, the approximate value of indirect taxes was subtracted from 
total value added on the basis of commodity tax rates. 
Direct estimates of gross value and costs were made for 
cotton textiles, electric power, and iron and steel. The gross 
value of output for coal, petroleum, nonferrous metals, ferrous 
metals other than iron and steel, industrial chemicals, cement, rub-
ber products, cigarettes, paper and pulp, and printing was directly 
estimated, but the percentage of gross value that is value added is 
based either on an analogy to Manchurian industry in 1941 or on 
independent estimates. Engineering output was valued on the basis 
of a Communist statement that it constituted 5.2 percent of indus-
trial output in 1952. Weapons and ammunition were valued in dollars 
and then converted on the basis of an estimated yuan-dollar ratio 
for such output. Gross value of miscellaneous textiles, ceramics 
other than cement, and chemicals other than industrial chemicals 
was estimated on the basis of their probable value in relation to 
those commodities within the general industry. 
The absence of production information for some components 
of the food industries and the lack of an adequate basis upon which 
to allocate the output among modern industry, handicraft workshops, 
and individual handicraft restricts the usefulness of the food-
processing measures. The indexes of flour, edible vegetable oils, 
and refined sugar were employed to project the food sector to 1960. 
The weights used were as follows: flour, 1.01 billion yuan, vege-
table oils, 5.66 billion yuan; sugar, 2.99 billion yuan; and wine, 
grain polishing, and miscellaneous food-products, represented by 
the flour index, 4.13 billion yuan. Individual handicraft is esti-
mated to account for 2.5 billion yuan by value in these catepries. 
Table 39* presents the production indexes used and 
Table 43** the gross value and the value-added weights used to 
derive gross value and value-added indexes for industrial output.

2. Individual Handicraft. 
To estimate trends in the output of individual handi-
craft, the gross value series available from Communist aggregate 
figures was used for 1949, 1952-54, and 1957. The years 1950 and 
1951 were interpolated on the basis of gross value for consumer goods 
from the industrial index. The year 1955 was assumed constant in 
relation to 1954, and a constant rate of increase from 1955 to 1957 
was projected to 1960. Value added was estimated from sample data, 
and labor force income was assumed to be 30 percent of the gross 
value of output or 2.19 billion yuan in 1952. 
3. Modern Transport and Telecommunications. 
The index for modern transport was derived from an esti-
mated value added per ton-kilometer and per passenger-kilometer for 
rail, highway, and water transportation. To this was added an index 
of estimated gross revenue for posts and telecommunications with a 
value-added weight of 0.14 billion yuan. The value added for modern' 
transport and communications totaled 1.43 billion yuan in 1952.

4. Construction, Government, and Other Services. 
Value added by construction was estimated from wages and 
the relation of profits to wages and projected by the index for 
cement output. An index for government services was constructed from 
budget data for nonmilitary government administration and deflated by 
a price index. For military expenditures, trends in the number of 
men under arms were used against estimated 1952 budget expenditures 
for pay and allowances. Miscellaneous consumer services and urban 
house rent were projected by the trade index, and rural house rent 
was projected by the index for agriculture. 
III. Indexes by End Use. 
Table 44* presents estimates of GNP by end use and summarizes the 
estimates introduced in Table 4o and Table 41. 
The end-use estimate of Communist China's GNP in 1952 is calcu-
lated from: announced retail sales, the government budget, the 
imputed value of farm home consumption, and estimates of house rent 
and miscellaneous services. Announced retail sales include sales 
to consumers, sales of production materials to peasants, and goods 
sold to enterprises for their own use (which is reported as not 
large). These totals are subdivided into urban and rural sales. 
The budget forms the base for estimates of government investment 
and government purchases. The imputed value of farm home con-
sumption is estimated indirectly by subtracting the value of 
imputed home production materials and cash income (based on the 
rural retail sales figure) from the estimated value of farm output 
at farm prices. Finally, the estimate of house rent and miscella-
neous consumer services was made on the basis of typical rural and 
urban consumption expenditures together with an estimate of the 
portion of the labor force in these personal consumer services. 
A. Index of Consumer Goods. 
The index of estimated final sales to consumers is based 
on allocations of output by value which is also consistent with 
reported consumption patterns in rural and urban areas. The com-
ponents of the index are as follows: food, 64.o percent, projected 
by the food crops index; clothing, 9.8 percent, projected by the

b. Investment estimated at 2 billion yuan a year for peasants out of 
own income (from the Communist press). 8 percent of the value of farm 
and subsidiary output is estimated to be purchases of materials for 
current production (based on a study of Shantung rural income).

index; wine and other food products, 3.0 percent, projected by the 
food crop index; and miscellaneous (including printing), 3.7 percent, 
projected by the paper index. 
B. Index for Investment. 
The aggregate index for investment is composed of an index 
for investment goods, the trade index, and the index for agricultural 
output. The investment component of GNP may be subdivided as follows: 
private farm investment, 2.00 billion yuan; government investment, 
8.13 billion yuan. The latter is estimated to include the following: 
basic construction, 4.55 billion yuan; increased inventories, 2.40 
billion yuan; and capital repairs, 1.18 billion yuan. 
The index for investment goods, employed to project basic 
construction and capital repairs, is a weighted composite of steel, 
cement, lumber, and engineering output. The indexes for agricultural 
output and trade, used to project private farm investment and inven-
tories, respectively, are described above. 
C. Index for Government Purchases. 
The composite index for government purchases is constructed 
from an index for military expenditures and an index for nonmilitary 
expenditures. The four components of the latter and their respective 
1952 values are as follows: administrative expenditures, 1.31 billion 
yuan; cultural expenditures., 0.29 billion yuan; educational expendi-
itures, 0.57 billion yuan; and medical expenditures, 0.26 billion yuan. 
The components of the index for military expenditures and their 1952 
weights are as follows: personnel, 1.77 billion yuan; weapons and 
ammunition domestically produced, 0.68 billion yuan; weapons and 
ammunition imported, 0.54 billion yuan; petroleum, 0.34 billion yuan; 
electrical equipment, 0.29 billion yuan; and transport and tele-
communications, 0.28 billion yuan.
