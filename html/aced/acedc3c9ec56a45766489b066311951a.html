 CUBAN SUGAR CROP FAILURE POSES MAJOR PROBLEMS
 Cuba's 1966 sugar. is now harvested and the results pose
 a rather bleak outlook for the island.  One year ago Castro announced that
 a harvest of 6.5 million tons was planned for this year.  By this April,
 when the harvest was half finished, he .admitted that it would more likely
 be 5 million tons.  A few weeks later he spoke of "less than 5 million
 tons."  In the end, the- crop will amount to only ~+.5 million tons, a low
 which has been hit only three times in 15 years.
 The fundamental reason for the poor harvest eras bad weather.  Last
 year Cuba was hit by an exceptionally bad drought. -This year, when the
 harvest was underway, rainfall was heavy. and greatly hampered harvesting
 operations.  However, there are many other factors which have also served
 to curb production and which are. more directly related to the.. nature of
 the Castro regime.  They include serious mismanagement, shortage of ferti-
 lizer, the decrepitude of harvesting and milling equipment, and the re-
 luctance of the people to work hard at the harvest.  None of the factors,
 taken separately, can be said .to have a decisive effect; however their
 cumulative effect has seriously limited production.
 The poor sugar harvest will have serious repercussions on the entire
 Cuban economy be-cause sugar accounts for about 85% of a:Ll her sales abroad.

 world for industrial equipment, fuels, raw materials, critical consumer
 goods, and even for food,  Hard currency is also needed for fomenting sub-
 version and revolution in countries of the Free World
 Since Cuba's commitments of sugar this year exceed he:r production --
 even taking into consideration an estimated 500,000 tons left over from
 last year -- she will have to default on part of her scheduled deliveries
 to the USSR, a procedure Castro has already had to follow .n 1962, 1963,
 and 196+.
 Putting the best face on the situation, Castro boasted in his May Day
 speech that while this. year's harvest is poor due to bad weather, the heavy
 rains augur well for next year's harvest, which should be the best ever ...
 a full 7 million tons,  However in mid-June Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos

 How its promises were fulfilled - or violated
 Fourteen August 1966 marks the 25th anniversa
 ry of the
 Atlantic Charter in which the US and the UK proclaimed, inter alia, that
 "their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other"; and that
 "they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the
 freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned."  [See Atlantic Char-
 ter, attached, for the eight principles which set the framework of the
 US-UK postwar foreign policy.]  A little over a month later (2~+ September
 19+1), 15 anti-Axis nations including the USSR~had endorsed the Charter.
 The Western Allies have faithfully adhered to these principles; the
 USSR has been equally active in violating them.
 Distrust of the Soviet Union was widespread as the war clouds foamed
 over Europe.  And this distrust was justified when the Soviets signed
 the "non-aggression pact" with Hitler's Germany in August 1939 and di-
 vided their spheres of interest in Europe  in secret protocols.
 When Nazi Germany turned and attacked its erstwhile partner in world
 aggression on 22 June 19+1, Western Europe was fighting for its life and
 freedom against Hitler's armies.  Therefore, on the following day,
 Winston Churchill broadcast this offer to the USSR:
 "Any man or state u~ho fights on against Nazidom wiZ2 have
 our aid.    ...  It foZZozvs,  therefore,  that we shaZZ give
 whatever help we can to Russia and the Russian people."
 The differences in the Soviet Union's communist motives, political ideas
 and objectives were clearly recognized.  But Hitler's aggressive war was
 the immediate critical danger to Europe and the needs of military co-
 operation with Moscow took priority over all else.

 Nonetheless, in an effort to establish an identity of political
 principles, the US and UK proclaimed their Atlantic Charter in August
 and invited its allies to subscribe to it.  In spite of endorsing these
 principles., Moscow immediately pressed for but failed to get political
 commitments from its Western Allies.  For example, in December 191+1 when
 Stalin was demanding Western recognition of Soviet right to territory
 taken in the period 1939-191+1, and settlement of most other European
 political and territorial questions which would emerge from the war,
 British Foreign Minister Eden reminded him of the Atlantic treaty to
 which he had subscribed and said that these matters would have to wait.
 Stalin said he thought the Charter was directed against those who were
 trying to get world domination (sic) "but it was beginning to look as
 though it were directed against the Soviet Union."  No better example is
 needed of the disparity between communist fiords and actions, promises and
 performance, and understanding of morality,
 The Soviets are commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Nazi attack
 on the USSR -- and desc~?ib.ing West Ger~.any as the lineal descendant of
 Nazism.  Their propaganda attempts to rewrite history, namely to bury the
 fact that the victim in a falling out of thieves hardly deserves sympathy,
 and that East Germany is the authoritarian descendant of Nazi Germany.
 Since the immed=i ate postwar period, the Soviet Union has pressed its
 strategy of pretended acceptance of the principles of sovereignty, free-
 dom, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and
 peoples.  At the same time, she has annexed vast territories in Europe
 and Asia and imposed her will on numerous Satellite regimes.  Thus her
 actions continue to expose these protestations as tactical camouflage
 for aggression and subversion for furthering her expansionist aims  In
 practice tYle Soviet Union's peaceful coexistence is basically subversion
 through popular fronts and infiltration through friendship and cultural
 exchange ;pacts; its sup~~ort of nationalism and independence is in reality
 support of wars for national liberation and direction of guerrilla war-
 fare and coups by dissidents against legitimate governments -- including,
 as  in the case of Ghana, those waged by one country against its neigh-
 bors.
 1) The Free West has honored its commitment to the foreign poacy
 principles stated in the Charter:  it has not imposed its rule on any
 new territories or peoples.  Even more, it has worked actively to sup-
 port those principles, e.g., by transforming its colonies into indepen-
 dent nations as quickly as possible (England and France in particular);
 supporting UN efforts to settle disputes peacefully (e.g., Middle East,
 Yemen, Kashmir, Laos); a.nd fighting actively to prevent aggressive nations
 from imposing their rule over others by force (e.g., Korea, Congo, Viet-
 nam).

 2) The Soviet Union has, for twenty-five long  ears, abrogated its
 similar commitments:  it has brought immense territories and millions of
 people under its control by force (e.g., Baltic countries, East Poland,
 and parts of Czechoslovakia, parts of Finland and Japan, Bessarabia).
 It has abrogated not only this Charter, but countless bilateral treaties,
 pacts and agreements pertaining to the recognition of sovereignty, mutual
 assistance, non-aggression, friendship and trade, with large and small
 countries .                                                      50X1-HUM
 1) Europe was fighting for its life and freedom in WW II and all dif-
 ferences between allies had to be submerged if the immediate critical
 danger threatened by Hitler's fanatical Nazism was to be met.  Only the
 sudden attack of Nazi Germany upon its erstwhile collaborator -- who had
 been willing to protect itself from such attack and reap sizeable advant-
 ages from the war against the West -- brought the USSR to a position of
 "accepting" help from the western allies.  Differences between the USSR
 and its Western Allies in motives, trustworthiness, political intent,
 etc. were known.  But the war effort had to come first and political
 disagreements warded off in the interim.  There is no such pressing need
 to mollify aggressors today.
 2) The Western Allies could hope that a war won against a strong
 aggressive power, along with the experience of collaborating with western
 democracies, would make the Soviet Union more responsive to the rights
 and institutional differences of others.  Only the consequences of the
 Yalta and Teheran conferences, and Soviet intransigeance in occupying and
 taking over all of East Europe showed how wishful the thinking of Western
 leaders had been.
 3) The principles of the Altantic Charter are, by and large, the ones
 to which the USSR again purports to subscribe in its peaceful coexistence
 policy, its endorsement of non-interference in the internal affairs of
 other countries, and its demands for "liberation."  But the current ac-
 tivities of the USSR are ,just as equally in conflict with these stated
 principles as its actions during and subsequent to WW II when it enslaved,
 inter alia, East Europe.  Among current communist activities in conflict
 with stated principles the following are suggestive:  proposing popular
 fronts as'the means of government takeover; supporting subversion against
 legitimate governments; encouraging active sabotage, rebellion within
 foreign countries; supporting North Vietnam's aggressive war against
 South Vietnam; collaborating with foreign governments against their neigh-
 bors (e.g., Ghana, Tanzania, Somalia, UAR); refusing to participate in
 UN efforts to maintain the peace in numerous places throughput the world.

 were two professors at Peking University.  These learned gentlemen (named
 CH''EN Tu'hsiu and LI Ta-chao) were leaders of China?s westernized intel-
 ligentsia - they were also men of vastly differing temper, at one only in
 their common desire to cast off the traditional trappings of Chinese cul-
 ture and look to the West for philosophic guidance.  Their disparity of
 temperament, aim and motivation cut the pattern with remarkable accuracy
 for what was to be the character of the Chinese Communist Party for the
 first half century of its existence:  chronic discord which has run the
 gamut from petty bickering to reasoned dissent to bloody rebellion.
 The original founders of the Chinese Communist Party
 CCP) in 1921 and first dispensers of Marxist-Leninist doctrine in China
 The dissent-ridden history of the CCP is the best proof available -
 abjective and factual - that communism is far removed from the monolithic
 structure its leaders and followers would have the non-communist world
 believe.  Chinese Communism is quite possibly even less monolithic than
 other communist systems since it has been twisted to one man's changing
 will (MAO Tse-tung) and forced by the press of circumstance to relax its
 rigidity in a most un-communist manner (the "Hundred Flowers" episode,
 for instance).  In its turbulent life-span, the CCP and its leaders have
 fought with their Chinese brothers (the Kuomintang), have fought among
 themselves on levels as high as the Politburo, and have proved so pug-
 nacious internationally that they have virtually isolated the Chinese
 people from the rest of the world.  Finally the CCP squared off at the
 CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) - a testimonial to Chinese
 ingratitude, since the CPSU nursed an ungracious CCP through its growing
 pains in the 1950's.  Wishing to maintain some facade of international
 unity the CCP and the CPSU have not broken formally but the echoes of"
 their quarrels (regularly published. by both parties in "secret" letters
 and voiced through mouthpieces like Albania), have given comfort to the
 enemies of communism and helped to shatter the image of communist oneness
 of purpose.
 Another reason for communism's failure to build a truly monolithic
 structure is man's driving desire for change or movement regardless of
 the direction -- a fact "scientifically" disclaimed by communists. Homo
 sapiens is pliant to a certain degree but as has been demonstrated through-
 out the history of the CCP, inevitably one faction breaks away from the

 through a glass darkly) ih China today is simply one more episode
 in the inevitably turbulent history of communism - life is stirring
 within the so-called monolith, causing cracks in the structure today
 as it has in the past and will in the future.
 What sparked the current feud (the. purge of intellectuals) is not
 clear.  It may have been simply the first step in a deliberate campaign
 .plotted by MAO's lieutenants to arrange for his succession, with or
 without his connivance.  If controls were ariginally~agreed upon by
 MAO's men as to the pace of the purge or the identity of the successor,
 those controls back-faired and it now appears that a full fledged battle
 for succession is raging :in Communist China.. The leadership struggle
 has already spread we:11 beyond Peking and as it continues will probably
 reverberate. down through the echelons o.f the hierarchy to be repeated
 at every level of the party and state organizations.  It is believed ':
 that from this time forward MAO's'role will be that of a figurehead
 until such time as one of his successors - now dependent on the momentum
 of MAO's revolutionary mystique - feels strong enough to shed MAO-ism
 and stand on his own feet.  At that point MAO-ism will be officially
 dead.
 History is once more in the process of proving that communism is
 fragile, fallible and subject to ills.  History will undoubtedly also
 prove that like other famous communist leaders before him (most notably
 Stalin and Khrushchev) MAO is no more a monolith than the system he has
 represented-for three- decades.
 Proof that history is repeating itself can be found and used in play-
 ing up what the regime has exposed in its current criticism_ of the intel-
 lectuals who are leading the drive in China for the missing elements which
 have always caused dissension under communism:  literary realism, a for-
 eign policy which does not alienate the rest of the-world, a domestic
 economy which gives Preer rein to individual initiative and the opportunity
 for an education uninterrupted by time abut for work for the state (in com-

 is being revealed as a consistent loser.  He has failed as a theorist for

 he twisted Marxism-Leninism to his own interpretations of China's parti-
 cular needs; ..his failure as an .e.conomiet was shouted to the world and
 the Chinese people in the debacle of the great Leap Forward; his inept-
 ness as a foreign policy maker can be graphically shown in China's iso-
 lation from the free world, the deterioration of her relations with
 African nations, other Asian nations, other communist natons~parties and even
 h.er growing alienation from her erstwhile benefactor and most powerful
 former ally, the Soviet Union.  And now MA0's failure to hold together
 or even control his own lieutenants is becoming known to the world as
 the battle to take over his power rages.
