Indonesian trade in 1955 with theSine-Soviet Bloc, although 
still a small share of the total trade, showed a sizeable increase over 
previous years ? During the past several years the Bloc countries 
hays made considerable efforts to inarease trade and economic relations 
with Indonesia. These efforts have included the conelusion of trade 
agreements, the establishment of permanent trade miasions, participation 
in the Djakarta International Trade Pairs and, more recently, offers 
of technical assistance for Indonesia08 economic development? During 
1956 the Bloc has intensified its efforts to develop closer relations 
with Indonesia, In April the Soviet Union made its first concrete 
proposal to give Indonesia economic assistance for development in all 
fields and in September a $100,000,000 credit agreement was signed? 
Tut. agreements providing for Csech assistance were also announced in 
April, President Sukarno visited the Soviet Union and Communist China. 
Indonesia sent parliamentary missions to the USSR, Poland, Csechoslo-
vakia and Communist China, 
To date the Sino-Soviet Bloc has provided Indonesia with known 
oredits totalling $112.3 million. Of this total, the USSR has provided 
$100 million and the European Satellites $12,3, The Soviet credit 
program will undoubtedly involve large shipments of capital equipment 
to Indonesia, Following the pattern established in India and Afghan-
istan, Soviet technicians will probably be sent to man the installations 
in their initial phase of operations and to train Indonesians in the 
use of the equipment, 
Prior to the signature of the Soviet credit agreement in September 
1956, Floc technical assistance to Indonesia was limited to small=. 
acale projects-'the construction of a sugar refinery, a canvas-producing 
factory, a tire factory and an enamelware factory, Under the Soviet 
credit agreement, however, technical assistance will probably be extended 
to the large-seale development projects such as hydroelectric installntinns, 
coal-mines and the development of non-ferrous metal ore deposits all 
of Which have been given a high priority by the Indonesian 0overnmera 
in its industrialization program. The Soviet mission which will begin 
anroey work in 1957 in the above fields will be in a position to exer-
nine considerable influence in establishing a format for their development. 
The amount of Bloc credit has been small compared with the assistance 
Indonesia has received from the US. Total US assistance to Indonesia 
nince 1950 has amounted to approximately $10 million which includes a 
3100 million Export-Import Bank credit extended in 1950. An agreement 
ander Public Law 480, signed in March 1956, provides an additional 
gum of $77,4 million to be used for economic development purposes.

With Indonesia's economic developsent severely handicapped by a 
1,..T. of capital and a shortage of skilled personnel, it is apparent 
t's.,a Indonesia will require appreciable outside assistance if an 
? asive development program is to be undertaken. The Indonesian 
Gc enment, in line with its neutralist policy? has indicated its 
wIllingness to receive assistance from any source provided it contains 
nc olitical or military commitments. Indonesia will probably continue 
to 9ek a large share of its capital and technical assistance require-
csint s from the Free World, but there is an increasing receptivity 
tc Lloc offers of assistance. If the Bloc countries continue to make 
of re which conform to Indonesia's expressed aims, Bloc aid will 
? inue to be accepted.

I Foreign Trade 
Sino-Soviet Bloc trade in. 1951-1956, as Shown in Table 1, represented 
an insignificant percentage of Indonesials total trade. Indonesian trade 
with the Bloc countries in 1955, although still a relatively small share 
of total trade, Showed a sizeable increase over 1954. Indonesian exports 
to the Bloc in 1955 totalled $33,898$000 (3.6 percent of total experts) 
compared to exports in 1954 of $900820000 (1.1 percent of total experts). 
Similarly, Indonesian imports from the Bloc in 1955 increased to $40,366,000 
(6.6 percent of total imports) from $15,333,000 (2.4 percent of total 
imeerts) in 1954. The gradual increase in the volume of trade with the 
Blee evidenced in the first half of 1955 was somewhat offset by a decrease 
in the second half, partially attributable to the policy of the Harahap 
Cabinet Which restricted Czech, Polish and Hungarian imports from July 
to mideDecember because of unfavorable trade balances. Trade statistics 
for the first half of 1956 (Table 1) indicate a repetition of the 1955 
pattern. However, since new trade agreements are being concluded with 
the European satellites which require payments in "effective currency" 
in place of the barter arrangements used earlier, it is not now possible 
to ascertain whether second half 1956 trade will tend to balance imports 
and exports on a country-by-country basis. 
Czechoslovakia, Communist China and Hungary are Indonesia's most 
important Bloc trading partners. Rubber, copra, pepper, coffee, cane 
sugar, and coconut oil are exported to the Bloc countries in exchange 
for light manufactures notably textiles, cement, motorcycles, and 
machinery. 
Of Indonesia's three principal export commodities - rubber, tin 
and petroleum - only rubber is exported to the Bloc, although under the 
current bloc agreements tin is included on Indonesia's export lists. 
Even though rubber accounted for approximately 63 percent of total 
Indonesian exports to the Bloc in 1955, rubber exports to the Bloc 
accounted for only 5.6 percent of total Indonesian rubber exports. In 
1956 low rubber exports began to evoke reactions in the Tndoneeian 
rubber producing areas. Further alarm was evoked by President Eisenhower"e 
statement to Congress that the US could be self-sufficient in synthetic 
rubber production within 2 years. On 7 June 1956 an Indonesian Cabinet 
decision to lift the embargo on rubber shipments to Communist China was 
announced. Although the Bloc provides only a relatively minor market 
for Indonesian rubber, it is apparent that with a decline in rubber 
exports Indonesia will be under pressure not only to expand rubber

"MEN, 
shipments to the Bloc countries but also, with the recent Indonesian 
cabinet decision, to take steps to open possibilities for the export 
of rubber to Communist China. In 1955 the Bloc took significant pro-
portions of certain agricultural products, as follow: coffee, 7.5 
percent; copra, 11.4 percent; sugar, 18.8 percent; spices, 38.6 percent 
and coconut oil, 92.4 percent. 
Commodity statistics for 1955 thow that textiles accounted for 
about half of the Bloc exports to Indonesia, while cement and semi-
firuthed iron and steel accounted for about 10 percent each, with 
miscellaneous light manufactures making up most of the balance. 
Bloc supplies of textiles to Indonesia increased considerably in 
1955. Although the Bloc had sold only about t5 million worth of 
textiles to Indonesia in 1954(3.6 percent of total textile imports), 
it sold over f17 million worth in 1955, increasing its Share in this 
import market to 10.8 percent (see Table 2). Indonesia is highly 
dependent upon external sources for textiles since only 10 percent of 
requirements are met by domestic production. 
It is worth noting too, that existing American business practices 
are causing US suppliers to loss out to European exporters in the 
textile field. American suppliers refuse to give a firm contract for 
goods "subject to the iseuance of an import license". Local importers 
in Medan (commercial center in Sumatra) are turning to European firms - 
Czech, Hungarian, Dutch and West German - which have indicated their 
willingness to enter into firm delivery contracts prior to the procure-
ment of an import license (Czech and Hungarian representatives have 
been particularly active in this respect). Under the Indonesian system 
of liceneing, Indonesian import firma must, when they get an order, get 
quotations from their suppliers and then apply for an import license 
at the price and in favor of the company quoted. This process is tima-
consuming and an import license, once granted, cannot be changed either 
In terms of price or source. If an American supplier of textiles raises 
the price of his goods between the time a quotation is given and an 
import license is secured, the Indonesia importer must apply for a new 
license with a resultant delay in delivery to local customers. 
The Bloc is not limiting its sales in the textile field to textiles 
clone. Czechoslovakia provided 34.5 percent of Indonesia's imports of 
textile machinery in 1955. Whereas Czech sewing machines comprised 
only 0.4 percent of the total imported in 1954, their share increased

to 10 percent in 1955. Bloc overtures in this field have not come 
solely from Czechoslovakia. Communist China in 1955 offered to provide 
eqwpment for textile mills on a long-term credit basis. East Germany 
also has made offers of equipment, and following the 1954 Djakarta 
Trade Fair it donated an automatic weaving machine and two knitting 
nachines to the Textile Research Institut* in Bandung. 
In view of Indonesia/a intended expansion of its textile industry, 
he Bloc may continue to be an important supplier of equipment. In 
954 Indonesia had 65 textile mills in operation and the textile industry 
as equipped with about 95,000 spindles, 12,000 mechanical looms, and 
70,000 hand looms. In September 1955, the head of Indonesia's Textile 
3e:search Institute, Dr. Safuin, accepted an invitation to visit a Czech 
Lextile machinery exhibit. Before his departure he declared that Indonesia 
At that time had only 20 percent of its minimum requirements of textile 
machinery. The potential impact of Bloc equipment upon Indonaaials 
textile industry is therefore significant.

Under the Ali Government which held office from July 1953 to 
August 1955 government policy led to a strengthening or trade relations 
with the Bloc. Closer trade ties were negotiated as trade agreements 
were concluded for the first time with Communist China, Rumania, and 
Bast Germany. In early 1955 the Ali Government began to Show disillusion-
ment with 'Bloc trade: Implementation under the agreements had not 
measured up to expectations; Indonesian products sold to the Bloc 
countries were being resold on the European markett at lower price; 
and the Bloc, in seeking outlets in Indonesia appeared to favor local 
Communist businessmen. After the Harahap Cabinet took office in August 
1955 special trade patterns - the parallel transactions* formerly used 
extensively with Eastern Europe - were abolished- (lovernment decelerations 
issued in October 1955 indicated that trade errengements with the Blot 
countrieu had been unsatisfactory and had resulted in a general deterioration!. 
in the foreign exchange position. The Prime Minister, in a Parliamentary ' 
debate, pointed out that raw materials exported to the Bloc had been 
retraded in ether markets in direct competition with normal Indonesian 
exports and that, under parallel transactions, Indonesian exports were 
usually sold below world market prices with the deficit made up by 
charging Indonesian consumere more for imports. 
Under parallel transactions the commodities of one country are 
exchanged for commodities if the other without transfer of funds.

Communist China, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland 
and Rumania participated in the 3rd International Trade Fair held in 
Djakarta from 18 August - 26 September 1955. Poland and Rumania had 
only information booth e and East Germany exhibited through a local 
agent. While the Bloc oountries did not dominate the Fair aa they 
had in 1954, they nevertheless made a very impressive showing. The 
Czechs were the most aggressive in publicizing their exhibit, running 
a series of ads in local newspapers about the proaucts on display. As 
in the past, the Bloc countries used the Fair for major propaganda 
purposes, exhibiting their products in an effort to convince Indonesia 
they were capable of supplying Indonesian requirements for capital and 
.consumer goods. Remarks made by some Indonesian officials and business-
men indicated that China, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary had, to some 
extent, succeeded in establishing such a conviction. 
D. laidaltUad Advertjsjji 
The Bloc countriee have advertised extensively to promote sales 
of their products. Polish advertisements appearing in the Indonesian 
. press have listed 14 Polish trade organizations which claim to be able 
to deliver a wide range of goods including heavy capital equipments 
ships, and motor vehicles. The Czech Commercial representative attached 
to the Czech Consulate General,-. inan effort to interest local importers 
in Medan in Czech products, distributed to importers a catalogue listing 
a wide variety of available products. In included machinery, vehicles 
and light engineering products, textiles and leather goods, ceramic 
and glass products. A Rumanian delegation was also in Madan demonstratinR 
agricultural machinery -- a crawler tractor, a triple-gang plow, disc 
harrows, and other farm equipment -- to the employees of the Office of

In spite of the fact that the delay may have been caused in part by the 
failure of Indonesia to provide adequate financing and transportation 
facilities for the equipment, the Past Germans will almost certainly be 
blaned. 
A number of Indonesian officials have expressed dissatisfaction 
with the Fast Genvin contract and disappointment in the execution of 
the plans. DrMuanda, State Master for Plannine, has stated that the 
Sultan of Jogja proceeded with the project against the advice of the 
government. The Sultan himself admitted that the factory was costing 
3 to 6 times the original estimate, He claimed one of the reasons for 
the increase in cost was that East Germany was not accustomed to 
erecting a complete sugar factory but Only in manufacturing some of the 
equipment? 
To date there is no definite date mentioned for the completion 
of the sugar' factory although the central goverment is anxious that it 
be completed by the end of 19570 Completion of the plant will primarily 
depend on the availability of domestic financing which is still 
questionable. 
Sugar production in Indonesia has steadily increased since the 
liar, with 1955 production estimated at 850,000 m. t0 compared with
718:000 mo to for 1954 and 619,521 m, t. for 19530 Domestic consumption ' 
requirements have almost equalled annual production, however. The

Czech efforts to provide technical assistance for Indonesia's 
economic development met with very little success in 1955. Only one 
email-scale project, the construction of a canvas-producing factory, 
waiw undertaken with Czech assistance. A January 1955 article in Amigo 
in reporting on this project, indicated most of the textile machinery 
bed arrived and Czech technician* were assisting in the mounting and 
operation of the machinery. An Embassy check-up revealed the press 
velem)* Vis italgersitedi, the texti.la machinerrhad not arrived or had 
construction work begun. Date of arrival of either the textile machinery 
or the Czech technicians is not known. ,Reports that Czechoslovakia is 
building an electric power plant, a factory for radio receivers, a 
pharmaceutical plant, and a factory for small and medium-sized agri-
cultural machines have not been confirmed. 
Hoverer, Indonesian Economic Ministry sources revealed on 13 
April that the Czech Government had submitted a draft credit agreement 
to the Indonesian Government under which credits would be granted to 
Indonesia for the establishment of such industries as steel, cement, 
textiles, glass, paper and pulp, and fertiliser. The Foreign Office 
has stated this vas a revision of the draft on which the countries had 
failed to agree in Jay 1955. The Embassy understood that the total 
line of credit is not specified but that subsidiary agreements are to 
be reached on a project-by-project basis. The terms call for payment 
in sterling with 10 percent down,15 percent on the first shipment and 
the balance 9 semi-annual insallments. The draft envisages the use 
of Czech technicians whose expenses will be paid in local currency. 
The agreement was signed on 16 May and the press reported the first 
credit under the agreement was the $1.6 million credit to the Indo-
nesian Tire and Rubber Company. 
The credit will be used by the Indonesian Tire and Rubber 
Company to equip a tire factory in Djakarta. A contract for this 
purpose was signed between the Bank of Industr* and the Czech firm, 
Technoexport. 
Information received from the Goodyear Tire and Rubber 
Company reveals that the total coat of equipment for the tire factory 
is ftp 50 million ($4,386,000). Equipment valued at ftp 18 million 
(*1.6 million) is scheduled to arrive in Djakarta in January 1957. The 
plant, scheduled to begin operations in January 1958, is to produce 
600 tires per day in two sizes, 6.00 x 16 for jeeps, light trucks and

passenger cars, and 7.50 x 20 for heavier trucks. The existing factory 
in Indonesia, operated by Goodyear, produces about 1,000 motor vehicle 
tires per day and supplies about 65 percent of the market. 
In early 1956 Prague announced the conclusion of a second 
contract by Technoexport (under the Czech credit agreement) for the 
construction of an enamelware factory which is to turn out 750 tons of 
enamel utensils a year. The Czechs are to deliver the complete equip-
ment including an electric power station. Czech technicians are to 
install the equipment and train Indonesian workers in the servicing or 
the machinery and in production methods. According to press reports, 
part of the enamelware factory equipment has arrived in Indonesia. 
Czechoslovakia is continuing to exert considerable effort to 
promote the sales of its industrial products. It has been reported 
that Czechoslovakia is, planning to have a mobile exposition of its 
industrial products tour the large cities of Indonesia. A standing 
offer has been made to send Czech experts to train Indonesian techni-
cians in the use of Czech industrial machinery ordered by Indonesia, 
Currently there are two Czech technicians working, without pay, in 
Modjokerto in East Java province, testing bulldozers, bestry trucks, and 
locomotives ordered from Czechoslovakia by the East Java Publi Works 
Service. The equipment, valued at approximately $780,000, will be sent 
to Kediri residency in south Java for use in construction work on the 
Brantas River flood control project and in the digging of a new 
irrigation canal.

C. Rumania 
A Rumanian-Indonesian agreement of August 1954 included a 
provision for Rumanian assistance in the construction of a cement mill, 
in drilling oilwells and working mineral deposits. 
In October 1955 the head of the Rumanian Trade Office in 
Djakarta made an offer for the construction of a cement mill on long. 
term credit. Rumanian technicians were due to arrive in January 1956 
for a 2-month survey to select a suitable site for the plant. Indonesia 
already has one cement plant in operation and construction work is pro-
gressing on a cement at Gresik, near Surabaya (East Java), which is 
being financed by an Export-Import Bank loan. Anticipated production 
of the Gresik plant, added to current production, is expected to bring 
local cement output close to the present demands of the domestic market. 
Dr. Djuanda has stated that the plant at Gresik will save Indonesia 
approximately $6 million per year in foreign exchange. Construction of 
this third plant would make Indonesia self-sufficient in cement and 
might even supply a surplus for export. It also would have the con-
comitant result of displacing Bloc exports of cement in Indonesia. 
Over half of Indonesia's total cement imports in the first half 
were supplied by the Bloc. Of total Bloc exports of cement to Indonesia 
in January..June 1955 approximately 70 percent was supplied by Czecho-
slovakia, 23 percent by Rumania, and the remainder by Poland and 
Hungary. Although the Indonesian Government has not announced that 
Rumania has been awarded the contract for construction of this cement 
plant, it seems likely that RUMWAftfl aeuistance will be accepted. 
IrJuly 1956 an offer was made by tuntania to operate the 
North Oumatre oilfields for a period of 10 years,, This offer is still 
under coneideration by the Indonesian Government.. Least Germany hnd

North Sumatra. It is unlikely that anything will come of the aimanian 
offer of assistance if negotiations are succeesful with HAM. On the 
other hand, it it is decided to nationalize the oilfields Bloc: oifers 
of assistance will more than likely be accepted. 
Indonesia's failure to establish a stable petroleum policy 
presents a sizable drawback for foreign investors. Under present 
conditions each foreign firm must make separate arrangements Zor con-
cessions, taxes? and the use of foreign exchange -- all of which are. 
subject to change. In mid-September the Indonesian Economic Minister 
indicated that the draft petroleum bill involving deoisions on renewal, 
extension, and revision of oil exploitation concessions by foreign 
companies was ready for discussion by the Planning Council. He stated 
that the bill was aimed at the most efficient possible exploitatien or 
Indonesia's oilfields.

D. The SovAet Won 
Joint talks on the USSR's offer of technical and economic aid 
took place in Djakarta in August 1956. One stumbling block to the 
conclusion of the talks appeared to be the question of repayment of 
the loan. The Indonesians wanted repayment to begin after the project 
was completed, but the Soviets wanted repayment to begin when the goods 
were shipped. Proposals made by the Soviet delegation ;or some aid 
projects, including credit offers, of $50 to $100 million* were 
consistently rejected by the Indonesians on the basis of the incomplete 
status of their 5-year Plan. 
The Soviet-Indonesian economic and technical aid agreement 
was signed on 15 September 1956. The agreement provided for a Soviet 
line of credit equivalent to $100 million for industrial projects. 
The credit which will be repaid over a 12-year period at 2i percent 
interest beginning 3 years after the loan has been made is payable in 
sterling or Indonesian raw materials. The Soviets will make experts 
available for research in peaceful uses of atomic energy' and will train 
Indonesians in this field. It was announced that Soviet credits would 
be used for financing 11 government-operated projects in the electric 
power, coal, chemicals, pulp and paper, and cement industries. Separate 
agreements are to be concluded later for specific projects* 
A Soviet mission, scheduled to be sent to Indonesia in 1957* 
will start preliminary surveys of the coal, nonferrous metal, hydro-
electric, and industrial raw material resources. The draft proposal 
Which was drawn up by the Indoneelan delegation outlined the following 
projects for Soviet technical assistance within the scope of the aid 
agreement: 
Coal Mining Industry - Conduct geological surveys of coal 
deposits in Kalimantan and West Sumatra and conduct research 
work on the industrial utilisation of these deposits. Inspec-

Free World Asalstasce and. Iaveetment (Other than U. 34) 
Apart from the Netherlands loan of 1950 for $75.7 million 
assistance from *thorn... World coustries through June 1956 had been 
amine 1a 1954 the Minister at Finance, me. Ong Eng Die reportedly 
stated that the government had obtained loans abroad totalling Rp. 
1 billion (approximately $88 million) 400 million (approxinertely 
$05 millien) from France, Bp. 300 million (approximately $26 million) 
from West Germany and 816 200 million (approximately $17.5 million) 
from the Netherlands. A subsequent Tmbassy check with members of other 
Missions and officials in the Ministry of Finance revealed the status 
of the credits from these countries to be Mg follows: 
?ranee - France and Indonesia reached an agreement 
in June 1954 at the conclusion of their trade agreement 
negotiations which provided for credits totalling 12 
million francs (approximately $35 million) to be Used 
within one year and repayable ever a period of 7 years. 
The oredits were to be used for the puroLase in France 
of capital goods?hydroelectric installations, power 
and electric equipment, building equipment, ships, 
mining equipment. As of the end of 1954 no agreement 
had been reached on the terms for the implementation of 
the credit and the French Government was becoming 
impatient and had asked the Indonesian Government to come 
to some early oonclusions or release the credit for use 
by France in other parts of the world. 
West Germany. - An agreement with the Bank Verein 
Westduetschland, Dusseldorf, simply provided that the 
Dank mould consider requests for credit from Indonesia, 
and if the project was considered sound and terms of 
credit could be agreed upon, the Bank would grant the credit. 
The amount and credit terms were not stated. There had 
been no specific requests submitted to the Bank for credit 
as of December 1954. 
Ike Netherlands - The Bank of Indonesia was authorised 
by the Monetary Council on 9 April 1954 to conclude a 
credit agreement with the N. V. Export Financiering Hij, 
the Hague for approximately 75 million rupiahs (Mor.ex-
imately 4.5 million). According to the Commeroial 
Counselor of the Office of the High Commissioner for 
the Netherlands none of the credit had been used as of 
December 1954. He added that the credit is to be used 
for projects which must have the prior approval of the 
Netherlands Government and can, in no sense, be dispensed 
freely by the Indonesians as claimed by the Minister of

Failure of the Indonesiae Goiennment to provide the necessary 
guarantees for foreign investtent?guarantees against nationalisation 
and double taxation, settlement dr lend cencession rights and assur-
ances that profits can be transferred ebroad--hes discouraged rein-
vestment as well as new investment by foreign capital. The withdrawal 
of Dutch capital, primarily invested in rubber plantations, has been 
most extensive, but in 1954 British. and US interests also announced 
their intentions of liquidating particular holdings. US petroleum 
interests-Standard Vacuum and Caltex-expect, however, to invest 
approximotely $140 million in Indonesia over the next four or five 
years. NUnthly transfer of profits is tied to commitments of new 
investment of 47040 million by stanvac and of $60 million by Caltex. 
On 27 April 1956 the Indonesian press announced Indonesian and 
Japanese governmental approval for the establishment of a joint Japanese-
Indonesian National Reconstruction Bank. The bank will have a capital 
of 50 million rupiahs (approximately 44.4 million), 49 percent of which 
will be provided by a Japanese compaey and 51 percent by private Indo-
nesian investors. The Japanese investor, /sshivara Sangyo Company, 
has reportedly paid its first installment. The bank will net engage 
in foreign exchange transactions but it will lend money for the develop-
ment of Indonesia 2s petroleum industry, interisland shipping services, 
and other industries. 
In mid-June 1956 a contract to finanie machinery for a rice straw 
paper mill in Central Java under a four-year credit wen concluded 
between the State Industrial Bank and an Italian firm "Cellulose 
Pomilie." The m411, scheduled to open by mid-1958, in to have an 
annual capacity of 7,500 tons. A second State Industrial Bank.prejeet 
for an asbestos cement factory near Gresik (test Java) is to have 
Italian teshnical aid and financial aid from New Zealand under the 
Celotbo plan. New Zealand assistance has also been reported for 
planned Usury and glass factories. The Indonesian foreign credits 
committee.has samouneed the continued opportunity for sapital goods 
imports odor ltageterm credits from the Netherlands, West Germaty, 
Frans., &Wee, Italy, Osethoslovakia, the DIE and the DB.
