 An Interview with Tim Butz
 JIM HARTZ:   After CIA station chief                         in Athens Richard
 Welch was assassinated,       U.  S.  intelligence officials point out
 that he had been identified as  an agent                                     in.a magazine called
 Counter-Spy,  a Washington based publication which specializes
 in exposing American intelligence activities,  and suggested
 that  this identification may have led to his murder.
 Well,  to  answer these charges,                     Counter-Spy's editor
 Tim Butz       is in  our Washington News  Center  this  morning with
 "Today" Washington correspondent Douglas Kiker.

 DOUGLAS KIKER:   Thank you,  Jim.   Good morning, every--
 Mr.                         Butz,  here  is  your winter  edition of  Counter-Spy.
 And  inside  it you  list     country  after  country,  and you  list  the
 names or what you think are           the names of the  station chiefs,
 CIA agents     there.      Doug Porter,  who is   the co-editor of Counter-
 Spy,  your              associate,  says  that  it  is conceivable  that  the Athens
 News,  which      published the  name  of Richard Welch    as  a  CIA agent,
 could have gotten that name         from Counter-Spy.    Do you agree?
 TIM BUTZ:   I  think  that Mr.  Porter  was  quoted out  of
 context.       That was  in an Associated Press'dispatch that  appeared
 in many newspapers  yesterday.         With  Counter-Spy  and its limited
 circulation -- we        circulate  about  three  thousand copies through-
 out  the United States  -- we               have  the element  of  distribution or
 redistribution  after  it  goes  to  a     subscriber.   We  can guarantee
 in  any way,   shape or form that   a     copy  of Counter-Spy wasn't
 seen by  the Athens Daily News,        because  we  don't  know what some-

 one might                  have  done afterwards....
 KIKER:   What  -- what   are  you  trying  to  accomplish?
 BUTZ:    Its  the way    the New York Times    perhaps  would
 land up on Chairman Mao Tse-tung's desk some morning.
 KIKER:   What are you trying to accomplish publishing
 the name of agents?
 BUTZ:    Well, we're not doing it      simply for expose.
 The  article where we  listed the hundred and  fifty station
 chiefs,  for example, was an analysis of the role of  station
 chief,  an analysis of what they do.   And we  listed  the names
 primarily to give people   an idea of how widespread the CIA
 is.   From Katmandu to Karachi,  there are CIA stations  in some
 of the most innocuous places  in the world, men operating  at
 the request of the United States government.   And what we're
 trying to do is raise the question of what are they doing there
 and,  even more important, how are they  functioning..
 KIKER:   Well,  a lot of people -- David Phillips,  former
 CIA agent,,    says you're endangering agents' lives.   Mike.Ackerman,
 who was on the Today  show,  a  former CIA agent on the Today show

 .
 last week,     said you're endangering American agen
 Do you think you are or not?
 BUTZ:   No, we're not endangering lives.  Our policy
 at Counter-Spy is  to only reprint names  that have already
 appeared in the foreign press.   We don't engage in a campaign
 of  ferreting out people under deep cover and printing  their
 name in an irresponsible manner.   We take the tack -   and
 we  think it's    a very responsible one  of going over the
 foreign press,  picking out those names that have been ideu.ti.-
 fied,  rechecking them against  several different sources,  and
 then publishing them only if it comes up in the context of a
 critical nature.
 KIKER: Well,  obviously other  intelligence networks,
 the Soviet network and  so    forth:   they know our agents; they
 know those names.   You've  got a book there  that purportedly
 was  published by the KGB that lists many of the names  --
 fellow professionals.   But by publishing the names,  don't you
 make U.          S.  agents targets for terrorists who probably wouldn't
 have  access     to  such information?

 worldwide..  If  Counter-Spy was       to stop publishing   the  names
 tomorrow,    the names would  still be published.in newspapers
 throughout   the world.   There's  a worldwide move        on  against
 the CIA that has  led to a lot of expose activity.             Counter-
 Spy is not a journal of expose;  it's a journal of analysis.
 KIKER: You have  announced  that  you're     going  to
 publish the names  of seventy more agents who. are operating,
 CIA agents,  in Angola,   France and Sweden next month.          Do you
 intend  to   do  it?
 BUTZ:   So far some of those  lists have arrived in  the
 mail  from the foreign press.      Liberation Newspaper      in France,.
 which is a daily,  is planning on publishing the names           there.
 And if they appear in France,         there's a very good  likelihood
 that we will reprint  them in Counter-Spy.
 Our  policy  on printing names is  constantly under
 review,  and  there're several  things we have  to  take into
 consideration when we proceed with the publication of names.
 The  primary  point  in our mind           is  "Will  it  benefit the American
 people?      Will    it   lead to a greater understanding of what  the
 CIA is doing      around  the world?" If that   first criteria is
 filled,  if it       indeed will help to foster better understanding,
 and,  even more important than that,  better public debate on the
 role of the CIA,          then we'll proceed. But we are  in contact with
 our advisers; we're       in contact with our supporters,          people who
 in the past has  indicated a willingness,       trying to get their
 feedback.
 The  printing of names  is  almost a. tactical      exercise
 and not  something we're married to.
 KIKER:     Where do you get the names?   Are you sure that
 your sources        are correct when they give you these names?   And
 how do  you    know you're  not  fingering non-agents?
 BUTZ:   Well,    we take  several precautions.   For example,
 the newspaper Information in Denmark recently ran an eight page
 supplement  to its newspaper outlining CIA operations         in Denmark.
 Now it's  kind      of hard  to  imagine that  CIA operations in Denmark
 would  fill eight  pages    of newsprint,      but,  in  fact,  it  did.   We
 take        those names. We  cross-check  them  against  the    State Depart-
 ment                      Registry,  which  is a  publicly  available  document.   And Mr.
 Ackerman  on Friday  detailed  a  little       bit  of  how you  could     identify
 CIA agents  from that document.   And we also use        another source,
 one  that was never  talked         about before.   But  being honest      with  you,

 what  we  use  is  embassy  telephone  directories.   From  an  embassy
 telephone     directory,  you  can  ascertain who is  in  a CIA station
 simply by the rooms      that  the people are located in and the
 telephone exchanges.
 BIKER:   The  British have  an intelligence  system also.
 What do you   think would happen  if     somebody  like you published
 an equivalent of Counter-Spy in Great Britain? They'd be
 put in jail.   They would be restrained, wouldn't they?
 BUTZ:    Well,  there  is an Official Secrets Act in
 Great Britain that would probably. restrain the ability of
 people there to conduct those operations.          And one of our
 fears  is    that a similar restriction on the First Amendment
 will be put into effect here....
 KIKER:   You're publishing......
 BUTZ:    ..:in this  country.
 KIKER:   That's  right.   You're publishing these because
 the First Amendment  gives you  the right  to publish  them.    I
 want  to ask you,     do you think you are abusing your First Amend-
 mentrights?
 BUTZ:    No.   The Bill of Rights,  especially the First
 Amendment, was put together because the    framers of the Constitu-
 tion,  the leaders of                      the country two hundred years ago  felt
 that the public had a right to know,  that the public had  the
 right to free  association, and that people had a right        to  say
 what they wanted.
 The  purpose behind Counter-Spy,  the purpose behind
 the Fifth Estate, has  always explicitly been to foster a public
 debate on the  question of national security.   Until three years
 ago,                such  things  weren't  discussed  in  Rgblic. They were  talked
 about only behind closed doors  in Washington.   We felt that
 the lessons of Vietnam had a very specific ma.nd.ate:   to  take
 that  question of national    security out of   the secret  doors-
 of the White House and Langley, Virginia and  put              it  out  in
 the public where people  could have their  input,  where  people
 could debate this critical question that everyday becomes.
 more  interesting and exciting.                           .
 KIKER:   Okay.   A member  of  --  a member  of  your advisory
 board,  Arthur  (?)       Richard  Sales,  says,  and  this is  a  quote:   "Our
 job  is to      expose  every  clandestine    agent until  the  CIA abandons
 its  covert actions."   Is  that your mission,          to, in effect,  destroy
 the  agents,   or  try    to?
 BUTZ:   Well, I don't   think that "destroy"     is  the proper

 name.   Our     target  is obviously covert  operations  and  the  inter-
 vention into                  the  affairs of  foreign countries.   We also  feel
 that  the CIA  is  not  capable of  existing  unless  it  carries  out
 this  sort of  function.
 In truth,  Mr.  Kiker,  the  CIA serves very  little
 purpose when   it comes  to  intelligence.   The vast majority
 of critical intelligence needed  for policy-making and decision-
 making  in  this             country         comes  from  the National Security Agency
 and  the  State Department.   Their intelligence         collection  pro-
 grams,  their                analytical programs are       far superior to anything
 that  the CIA has.  We feel that that     leaves  the CIA in a cer-
 tain              light,  and that  light is to act  as the cop around the
 world, to enforce,  in  a covert   fashion,  the  whims  of  the
 National Security Council,    whims        that may not necessarily be
 the desires of the American people.
 KIKER:   Finally, very quickly, who finances Counter-
 BUTZ:   Counter-Spy is                          financed by the subscribers,
 by sustainers,  people such as Norman Mailer and others.
 KIKER:   Thank you very much.   And  as  far  as  I  can
 see, Mr.     Butz, what you intend to do really is     to keep it up --
 is  what  you  say.
 BUTZ: We're going  to continue   to  foster   the  public
 debate.      We're  in touch with our advisers,   and what course
 we'll  take from here is up to everyone.
 KIKER:   Thank you very much,  Tim Butz,  who  is  the
 co-editor  of  Counter-Spy.   Time  now for   a station break.

 HARVARD CLUB SEMINARS
 1976 WINTER LECTURE SERIES AT.DUMBARTON OAKS
 The Harvard Club of Washington, D.C. is sponsoring another unique series of four lectures
 dealing with the great civilizations and arts currently under research at the Center for Byzantine
 Studies, Dumbarton Oaks, and at the Center for Hellenic Studies. The lecturers are the directors
 of research for Byzantine, Hellenic, Pre-Columbian studies and Landscape Architecture.
 Dumbarton Oaks has graciously offered the use of its facilities (1703 Thirty-Second Street, N.W.)
 for these lectures. There will be opportunity to view the collections after the Pre-Columbian and
 Byzantine lectures.
 . This series is an opportunity to participate in lectures singular to Harvard in Washington. We
 believe the combination of attractive surroundings and the topics presented should guarantee a
 pleasant and educational experience.

 In From the Cold
 FOR RELEASE ON RECEIPT
 AIRMAILED FROM WASHINGTON
 FOR RELEASE ON OR AFTER
 WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7, 1976
 By SMITH HEMPSTONE
 ARLINGTON, VA. -- On the orders of the President, they
 buried him among heroes.        And it was meet and right so to do.
 For although Richard Skeffington Welch never wore a
 uniform, the CIA's station chief in Athens -- gunned down Dec.  23
 outside his home by three unidentified assassins and buried yesterday
 (Tues., Jan.  6)  in Arlington National Cemetery -- was killed in action
 after nearly a quarter of a century in the service of his country.
 Who killed 46-year-old Dick Welch?  Take your pick:
 The KGB, which in 1968 published his name in the
 East German book entitled Who's Who in CIA.
 The editors of the Washington quarterly, Counter-Spy,
 which last year published the names of 150 CIA station chiefs,
 including Welch.
 Norman Bailer and his radical chic friends, who
 provided the initial funding for Counter-Spy.
 ? Author Philip Agee, a former CIA agent (and member
 of Counter-Spy's advisory board), who has published the names of
 scores of his former colleagues and called for their "neutralization."
 s The editors of the Athens News,  an English language
 paper which in November published Welch's name and address and
 those of other CIA agents in Athens -- but declined to publish the
 names of 10 Russian KGB agents serving in Greece.
 The members of the congressional committees that
 for nearly a year have been holding the CIA up to ridicule and
 verbal abuse.
 All of these,  it could be said,  had an indirect hand
 in Uelch's murder,  and it seems to me the time has come to put a
 'stop to this sort of thing.   Sure,  the CIA has been guilty of
 errors of judgment,  and at times has seriously violated its mandate.
 But these failings have been admitted and corrected.   What the
 Agees and their ilk have to ask themselves is this:
 Which side am I on?   To which country do I owe
 allegiance?   Do I want to be an accessory to the murder of one of
 my countrymen?
 The identity of.the masked men who pulled the trigger
 does not much matter.   In all probability, Welch's murder was not
 a KGB assassination.   There is an unwritten understanding between
 the two intelligence organizations that they do not target each
 other's senior officers (Welch is the first CIA station chief

 murdered since the agency was formed in 1947).
 The CIA's operation in Greece is a large one.   The
 country has land frontiers with three Communist nations -- Albania,
 Yugoslavia and Bulgaria -- and its islands stud the Soviet Union's
 sea lanes into the Mediterranean.
 The fledgling agency's first group of officers,  many
 of them graduates of the wartime OSS, played a key role in defeat-
 ing the Communists in the Greek civil war of 1944-49.   The Greek
 intelligence agency, the KYP, was set up with CIA help.
 Because several members of the military junta that
 ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974 were KYP graduates, the CIA has been
 accused of masterminding the coup that brought the colonels to
 power. The CIA has also been accused, again without proof, of
 having engineered the temporary disposition of the Cypriot president,
 Archbishop [1akarios,  in 1974.
 Welch served in Cyprus in the early 1960s, and it is
 possible that he was killed to settle an old score.   But it is a
 better guess that he was murdered by members of some far-left
 Greek group not subject to Communist discipline.
 As station chief,  he was the biggest fish in the Athens
 pool.   And that made him a natural target.

 So now a 32nd star will go up on the marbled wall of
 the entrance hall of CIA headquarters in Langley,  Va.   Those
 stars represent the intelligence officers who have lost their
 lives in 30 years of not-so-cold war.
 And a few weeks from now,  Counter-Spy will be coming
 out with an edition giving the names of CIA agents serving in
 Angola,  Paria and Stockholm.   It makes you sick.

 FRIDAY, JANUARY 30- 6:45pm
 There is a school of taste in the wine fraternity which
 because of early training of tongue buds,  or of the
 vagaries of service abroad, or out of plain orneryness
 feel that the white wines from the north of Europe are
 -superior to all others. _
 In truth, there are magnificent wines from the Moselle
 and its tributaries and from the Rhine in its many
 manifestations.   The Chef will conjure up some Rhine
 delicacies to accompany the wines.
 These will be the focal point of our Sipping Session on
 January 30.   Reservations should be made by calling
 Mrs. Abbott at 296-7350.   The limit is 75 persons.   The
 cost is $6.00 per person.
 Through one of those quirks to which
 the human mind is wont to indulge
 itself on occasion and particularly
 so during the holiday season, the day
 of the week on which "Winter in Mexico"
 will be shown was mis-stated in our
 recent bulletin on the matter.
 To clarify matters, January 8 is a
 THURSDAY and it is on THURSDAY,
 January 8 that "Winter in Mexico" will
 be shown.
