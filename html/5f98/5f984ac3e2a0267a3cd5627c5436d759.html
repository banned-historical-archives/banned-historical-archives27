 The Chang-   Moscow Rewrites Tibetan
 ing Soviet   History
 Line
 The following two quota-
 tions illustrate the change in Mos-
 cow's line on Tibet in the light of
 the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 Small Soviet Encyclopedia, vol. 9
 (1990):
 "With the support of imperialist
 circles and the Chiang Kai-shekites,
 Tibetan reactionaries organized a
 plot against the Central People's
 Government and in March 1959, began
 an armed uprising...  The defeat of
 the reactionary rebels by units of
 the People's Liberation Army, which
 was actively supported by broad sec-
 tions of the Tibetan population,
 foiled the dangerous plot by the
 internal and external enemies of the
 Chinese People's Republic and opened
 up the prospect of building a new,
 democratic and Socialist Tibet before
 the Tibetan people."
 Tashkent Radio, 3 April 1967:
 "Blood is flowing again and
 hundreds of Tibetans have been killed
 or have committed suicide after tor-
 ture.  Monasteries and shrines are
 being desecrated and sacred books
 destroyed.   The Tibetans fought for
 their national freedom and indepen-
 dence in 1959, when tens of thousands
 of Tibetans were killed by the Chi-
 nese and tens of thousands more were
 forced to flee.   In January 1965, the
 Tibetans rose again against 'Peking's
 policy; for Peking's proclamation of
 sham national autonomy has not satis-
 fied them.   The Tibetans will con-
 tinue their struggle for survival
 and independence and their libera-
 tion struggle, like that of other
 nationalities, will never be subdued."
 Moscow's pious sympathy for the
 Tibetan people seems even more-eyni-
 cal when contrasted with the 1960
 statement and in view of her own
 policy of offering "sham autonomy"
 to various nationalities within her
 own boundaries.                    25X1C1Ob

 sumer Benefits
 As part of the 50th
 Anniversary celebrations, the Soviet
 government has promised its citizens
 more consumer goods.  The following
 items are just two of the myriad
 which appear in the Communist and
 Western press, pointing up economic
 shortcomings in the Soviet Union.
 (UNCLASSIFIED) Flour Returns to State
 Stores in Moscow.   Flour is being
 sold in state stores for the first
 time since the autumn of 1963.  This
 is partially due to the favorable
 wheat crop of 1966 but is also an
 extra bonus for the jubilee year.
 While importing wheat, Russia had
 also made selected exports for politi-
 cal purposes while denying her own
 citizens the privilege of purchasing
 flour for their own use.
 More and Better Shoes.  According to
 EKONOMICHESKAYA GAZETA and IZVESTIYA
 the shoe industry is beset by a

 shortage of modern plant equipment
 and quality raw material.  The annual
 output of shoes is scheduled to
 increase from 522 million pairs in
 1966 to 760 million in 1971.   In
 order to meet this schedule new fac-
 tories will have to be built and
 modern equipment imported.   Improve-
 ment in the quality of domestic hides
 and artificial leather will also be
 necessary.   Artificial leather is, of
 such poor quality that it can only be
 used for sandals and summer footwear.
 Modern facilities for treating, stor-
 ing and shipping hides are also lack-
 ing.   Consequently, the regime has
 had to import large quantities of
 shoes from "Socialist" countries as
 well as the decadent West.

 Propagandist's Guide -to
 WORLD COMMUNIST AFFAIRS
 25 April-22 May 1967
 1.   Although Soviet media continue to acclaim the Karlovy Vary conference of
 European CPs (#13) as a great triumph and demonstration of unity with world-wide
 significance (media of other participants are generally much more restrained on
 the subject), the hollowness of the victory quickly becomes apparent.   Immedi-
 ately after its close, the participating British CP releases (A 27) a major
 new policy document which differs widely from Soviet policy in important as-
 pects.   Ten days later, the non-participating Rumanian CP boss Ceausescu pub-
 lishes a major statement which expands on that Party's previously expressed
 stance of independence, including a strong affirmation of the right of any
 party not to participate in any international meeting.   He strongly reiterates
 Rumanian opposition to any form of "an international coordinating center" and
 to  the setting up of compulsory norms of conduct for CPs."  And in a surpris-
 ing new thrust, he brands it as inadmissible for any member of one party to
 maintain relations with any other party "over the head of the leadership" and
 for any party to establish relations with any members or groups in another
 party (in the view of the most observers, a thinly-veiled charge of underhanded
 Soviet relations with sympathizers within the Rumanian CP).
 2.   Meanwhile, true to form, the Chinese and Albanians scathingly denounce KV
 as deceitful, hackneyed, and sterile, -- "symbolic of the utter bankruptcy of
 Europe's new scabs."
 3.   Soviet media continue to report statements by other parties calling for the
 convening of a world CP meeting, and they join in the call with the Greeks
 (A 29), but clandestine reporting indicates that in the aftermath of KV  most
 parties see the prospects for one deferred indefinitely.
 4.   Bilateral meetings between European parties continue, producing two more
 new 20-year friendship treaties, USSR-Bulgaria (M 10-13) and Hungary-E. Germany
 (M 18-21):   neither departs notably from the pattern of the recent series.
 5.   Castro's relations with the established CPs of Latin America are further
 inflamed by increased Cuban militance -- and the publicity caused by a series
 of "red-handed"captures:   one of Castro's closest political theorist
 collaborators with the guerrillas in Bolivia (A 25); a courier in Colombia
 (M"3); an agent with a clandestine radio and full paraphernalia in the Domin-
 ican Republic (M 8); and three Army officers attempting a landing on the coast
 of Venezuela (M 12).   Unabashed, he boastfully acknowledges the landing at-
 tempt and declares he'll continue to aid "fighters against imperialism" any-
 where in the world.   (M 1, 4, 18)

 6.   Radio Tirana broadcasts to Poland purported extracts from two more sedi-
 tions documents of an underground, anti-Gomulka "Polish CP."   (M 8 & 14)
 7.   Chinese media attack the Soviet revisionists heavily along many lines and
 expel a PRAVDA correspondent from Peking, while Soviet media reciprocate on a
 somewhat lower key.
 8.                       report from a usually reliable source states that the Chi-
 nese have indefinitely postponed their attempt to hold a rival AAPSO conference
 in Peking this year -- an intent which they announced after the Soviet-
 dominated Council meeting in Cyprus (#11, Feb. 13-16) voted to change the venue
 for the 5th conference to Algiers.   The postponement probably reflects China's
 difficulties in rounding up delegates.  Actually, the prospects for the Algiers
 AAPSO conference now appear doubtful, too.
 9.   Castro is confidently proceeding with plans for his own Latin American
 Solidarity Organization (LASO) conference in Havana July 28.
 10.   The new Maoist drive to crush opposition loyal to Liu (#13) gains little
 or no ground during this period:   on the contrary, the regime's media again
 warn against anarcay and violence as reports of clashes and even "large-scale,
 bloody repression" of Maoists increase.   (Note:   a number of experts on China
 believe that the poster and Red Guard bulletin reports of strife and massacres
 are intentionally exaggerated by the Maoists to provide grounds for ousting
 oppositionist leaders who can be held responsible, -- and there is little "hard"
 evidence to prove or disprove such views.)
 11.   As Maoist-led rioting breaks out in Hong Kong, the Chicom regime delivers
 stern demands to the British Govt, stirs massive demonstrations in Peking,
 maltreats a British consul in Shanghai, etc.   The British ignore the :Peking
 demands; the Hong Kong police (largely Chinese) remain loyal and handle the
 crowds firmly; and the situation is again relatively calm as the period ends.
 (M 6. and continuing)
 12.   Chinese media continue their heavy barrage of attacks on the Soviets on:
 collusion with U.S. imperialism (dragging this into articles on other subjects
 and other countries), India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Pope; on the Soviet
 "new system" of economic management and agriculture; on practicing economic
 imperialism in milking the socialist camp and countries of Asia and Africa; etc.
 (Chrono, A  26 & continuing)
 13.   Chinese-Indonesian political strife continues, but on. a somewhat lower
 key.   (A 25 & continuing)

 14.   On the 2nd anniversary of Mao's statement supporting the Dominican rebels,
 PEOPLE'S DAILY sounds the call to armed struggle to "the Dominican and other
 Latin American people."   (M 12)
 15.   Soviet media continue  extensive criticism of Chinese events, though per-
 haps less intensely than last month.   (A 29 & continuing, and M 7, 8 )
 16.   An IZVESTIYA attack on W. German-Japanese talks is rebuffed by the
 Japanese.    (M 16 & 18)
 17.   Appointment of CC/CPSU Secretary Andropov to relieve Semichastny at the
 head of the security police (KGB) is seen as resulting from a series of failures
 in recent months but indicates also closer party control of intelligence opera-
 tions.   (M 19)
 18.   The June issue of ATLANTIC MONTHLY contains an essay on the Russian people
 written by Svetlana Alliluyeva (Stalina) in Switzerland after she had read
 DR. ZHIVAGO.   (M 21)
 19.   The long-delayed 4th Congress of Soviet writers convenes on the last day
 of the period, with indications that it will be as bland, non-controversial,
 and conservative as can possibly be managed.   (M 22)
 20.   The USSR increases to $122 million its long-term loan for reconstruction
 of the Cuban sugar industry.   (M '7)                     This is an increase of
 almost 50% over the September 1966 agreement.
 21.                       Further deliveries of Soviet military hardware to Cuba,
 the UAR, Algeria, Morocco, and Uganda are reported during this period.
 22.                       The Deputy Chairman of the Soviet-Japan Friendship  Society
 in Japan in April reportedly makes some progress in efforts to woo the JCP
 and JSP and to encourage the two to form a common front in Japan.
 23.   EAST GERMANY:   Despite Ulbricht's "hard" speech at the SED Congress
 (#13, A 17-;22), the E. German regime sends 3 communications to Bonn in apparent
 efforts to draw the W. German Govt into intergovernmental negotiations; Bonn
 appoints a special commission to consider answers.   (M 1 & 17)
 E. German Foreign Minister Winzer visits UAR, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria and Iraq
 on a hurried trip apparently intended to exploit what they believe is Arab
 disenchantment with Bonn, but returns emptyhanded.   (See also item #1131, this

 24.   ALBANIA:       The Albanian regime decrees a set of harsh new "revolutionary
 initiatives" to "revolutionize the life of our country, -?- including reduction
 or abolition of personal plots for peasants, abolition or reduction of pro-
 duction material incentives in favor of moral incentives, intensifying of work
 and reduction of high wages.   (A 30)
 25.                     Czech expenditures for defense and security in 1967 will
 be 14.2% above 1966.
 26.   SWEDEN:  At its 21st Congress, the Swedish CP reelects Chairman Hermansson
 and decides to continue to follow his "liberal" ways:   it even changes the
 party's name to "Left Party -- Communist,"     which it admits is an effort to
 identify itself more closely with the socialist left.   (M 13-16)
 27.   FRANCE:  "Bloody strife" between pro-Moscow and pro-Chinese local Commu-
 nists reaches Paris, according to the Chinese.              (M 7)
 28.   JAPAN:  The JCP continues to struggle against Chinese--supported "split-
 ters," expelling two more prominent members.                 (M 8 & 13)
 29.   MONGOLIA:  Mongolia again protests a "new provocation organized by the
 Chinese Embassy" in Ulan Bator and expels the Chinese school-teacher offenders.

 30.   THAILAND:  The premier announces further Communist terrorist activities in
 the northeast.   (M 1 & 8)                      Communist activities show a 30% 4-11001 mifibi&W increase in armed clashes in March over February, with an accommpanying
 increase in village propaganda activities.   ____.__ 111P OW

 WORLD COMMUNIST AFFAIRS
 Continuing from preceding r?Llbers:  The situation in China appears to be
 more coizfused and t:4ap.>ledictablethan ever:  we treat it again in outline
 summary.
 A.  The new Maoist drive to eliminate the opposition headed by Liu & Co.
 apparently makes liti-.< or no headway.  Regime media in Peking and the
 relatively few ?'Maoi!-seized" provinces continue to attack  the number
 one Party person in authority taking the capitalist road`'  (Liu Shao-chi),
 his book, and the "handful of persons" supporting him, -- but with no dis-
 cernible concrete progress towards ousting him.  On the contrary, with
 increased reporting of bloody strife among Maoists as well as between
 Maoists and their opponents, regime media are again warning against anarchy
 and violence and solemnly predict a long, hard struggle ahead, with ''many
 other" cultural revolutions before China is safe from a `capitalist restora-
 tion."  Noteworthy items include:
 (1)  A 26 April PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, "Down with Anarchism," admits:
 At this very moment, anarchism has again appeared to scatter the
 targets of our struggle and divert the general orientation of the
 struggle."
 (2)  Wall posters in Peking on April 28 reveal that "under Mao's instruc-
 tions the Party CC's cultural revolution group on 22 April released from
 prison 139 middle school Red Guards affiliated with the United Action Commit-
 tee, which is comprised mainly of sons and daughters of high cadres," as
 reported by Tokyo SANKEI Bureau Chief Shibata.  Some posters attack and
 others laud the release of the UAC Red Guards.
 (3)  May Day brings an unprecedented turnout of the top leaders (Mao's
 first MD appearance since 1962), including several who have been subjected
 to repeated poster attacks in recent months, such as the 81-year-old mili-
 tary veteran Chu Teh, standing in 4th position, after Mao, Lin Piao, and
 Chou En-lai.  None of those closely identified with Liu are seen, however,
 nor any regional chiefs other than Li Hsueh-feng of the North China Party
 Bureau and Chang Kuo--hua of Tibet.  The large turnout was undoubtedly
 intended to convey an impression of unity, but, as Tillman Durdin reports
 to the NYTIMES from Hong Kong, "it did not, on balance, represent the
 accretion of much real strength for the Maoists."
 (1k)  Red Guard media report the ousting of two important anti-Maoist pro-
 vincial chiefs shortly after May Day:  Ulanfu, top Party, government, and
 military chief of Inner Mongolia reportedly relieved by a relatively
 unknown Liu Hsiang--chuan:  Ulanfu is accused of wanting to turn Inner
 Mongolia into an independent kingdom. THE EAST IS RED, student newspaper
 of the Peking Geological Institute, on May 9 reports a May 7 CC decision
 to oust Li Ching-chuan, CC Politburo member, Southwest China Party Bureau

 chief, and political commissar of the Chengtu Military Region, and appoint
 a preparatory committee to set up a Szechwan Provincial Revolutionary
 Committee.  It contains detailed` charges of the use of PLA troops in "large-.
 scale  bloody repression of the revolutionary masses" in that province
 which has 100 million people and vast grain producing areas(.  Thus far,
 the regime's formal media have made no mention of these reported ousters ---
 while wall posters and other sources increasingly depict bloody clashes in
 Szechwan,Heilungkiang, and elsewhere.
 (5)  The most systematic attack of Liu's book (HOW TO BE A GOOD C0124 MIST,
 or ON SELF-CULTIVATION) to date comes in a joint RED FLAG/PEOPLE'S DAILY
 editorial on May 7.  Among other charges, it claims that Liu in his 1962
 edition "deleted Stalin's name and,all the passages he originally quoted...,
 and that "nowhere does it so much as mention Mao Tse-tung's thought."  (A
 review of the 1962 edition shows that it does retain some passages attri-
 buted to Stalin and actually adds numerous Mao quotes not in the earlier
 versions.)
 (6)  The CCP on May 16  releases the text of a hitherto secret CC circular
 dated 16 May 1966:  "this great historic document, drawn up under Chairman
 Mao's guidance, smashed the scheme of the Peng Chen counter-revolutionary
 revisionist clique for a capitalist restoration.  For the first time it
 systematically presented the theory, line, principles, and policy of the
 GPCR...."  All papers front-page it on the 17th, and a joint RED FLAG/
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the 18th emphasizes its "tremendous significance."
 The latter concludes:  "The present GPCR is only the first, and in the
 future there are bound to be many others."
 (7)  PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on May 21 warns:
 `'Lately an, evil wind of struggling by force is seen in some
 places and units and among some mass organizations...  We must firmly
 curb this evil wind...."
 Toronto GLOBE AND MAIL correspondent Oancia on the 22nd describes security
 measures in Peking verging on martial law, with troops carrying fixed
 bayonets on their rifles patrolling the streets "in addition to the usual
 guards on duty.'
 B.  Names in the news:  In addition to those mentioned above, the following
 prominent CCP names warrant special note:
 (1)  Chiang Ching (Mao's wife) is boosted in prestige as all papers on
 May 10 front-page the text of a militant speech she allegedly made almost
 3 years ago, at the July 196+ Festival of the Peking Opera.  (Observers
 point out that her name was not even mentioned in any of the reporting
 associated with the Festival in 1964.)
 (2)  Chen Yi continues to be attacked by Red Guard posters and a Guard
 detachment broke into the Foreign Ministry building on May 13, apparently
 attempting to ransack the files for material to be used against him.

 However, he is reported still performing at least his ceremonial duties as
 Foreign Minister receiving the Cambodian Foreign Ministry's secygen as
 late as May 16.
 C.  Miscellaneous:  The Chinese on May 6 expel PRAVDA correspondent Pasen-
 chuk:  NCNA says that P,  who has always assumed a hostile attitude toward
 China, went so far as to attack by name, open and virulently, Chairman
 Mao ... and to smear China's GPCR in his dispatch of 14 April."
 April 25 and continuing: Bolivian Army patrols operating against Communist
 guerrillas (who had ambushed them on March 23 and April 10) capture 3
 foreigners and identify one as Jules Regis Debra, a militant French Commu-
 nist friend and writers-collaborator of Cuban Premier Castro, author of a
 1965 article, "'Castroism, the Long March of Latin America," and a 1967
 Havana-published book, REVOLUTION WITHIN A REVOLUTION.  Confirming the
 capture of Debray and his companions in a May 4 interview with WASHINGTON
 POST's Goshko., armed forces commander Ovando adds that many guerrillas in
 Bolivia "were trained in special guerrilla schools in Cuba and that others
 received training in similar schools in Russia."  Be concludes that "the
 situation is grave because they are backed and financed by international
 sources bent on the overthrow of the Bolivian Government."
 April 25 and continuing:  Chinese-Indonesian political strife continues,
 while the Indonesian Govt attempts to dissuade and prevent its people from
 actions against Chinese residents in I.  Highlights include:
 -- While Djakarta Radio on the 25th accuses the Chinese of "tampering with
 the facts about events in Indonesia involving Communist Chinese elements,"
 ANTARA on the 26th admits that I. youths in Medan on the 24th stormed and
 ransacked a number of Chinese houses,               adding that security
 troops rushed to the scene    - arrested the suspected instigators and pro-
 mised "stern measures'` against culprits.  ANTARA adds, though, that a group
 of Chinese awaiting repatriation had marched demonstratively to the Chinese
 Consulate,  chanting and yelling in Chineselapparently provoking the I youths.
 -  NCNA May 13 charges that "the Yugoslav Tito renegade group is stepping
 up its collusion with the I. fascist regime," citing "'secret meetings held
 from 8 to 11 May between Y. Deputy Foreign Minister Pavicevic and Suharto,
 Adam Malik, and other butchers of the I. people."
 _M, A May 18 Chinese Embassy note to the I. Foreign Ministry protests new
 "bloody atrocities" against Chinese nationals in Malang, East Java, on
 May 12 and 13.
 April 26 and continuing:  Media of the participants generally extol the
 results of the April 24+-26 Karlovy Vary conference of European CPs (see
 #13), led by the Soviets, who expand on its "international significance''
 and declare that its decisions "will become an increasingly important factor
 not only in the struggle for security in Europe but also for improving the

 international atmosphere in the whole world."  (PRAVDA, May 17).  On a
 more restrained note, however, Italian CP SecyGen Longo in a televised Rome
 press conference May 12 sees the  new significance" of KV in its recogni-
 tion of the autonomy and independence of each party.  (See major Rumanian
 statement May 7.)  The Chinese and Albanians, of course, scathingly denounce
 it.  PEOPLE'S DAILY May 4 calls it  symbolic of the utter bankruptcy of
 Europe's new scabs":
 "The meeting was convened by the Soviet revisionists to engineer
 further actions against China.  At the meeting Brezhnev led the attack.
 Outside the meeting the gang undertook intense anti-China activities....
 On the question of European 'peace and security,' the KV meeting fell
 back on a lot of hackneyed phrases, some picked up from the old revi-
 sionists, some from Khrushchev, some from Tito, and some from the
 imperialists.  This lengthy 7,000-word statement is crammed with
 deceitful phrases....
 What Brezhnev, Kosygin, and company call "security in Europe"' means
 security for the privileged bourgeois stratum in the countries where
 the revisionist groups are in power....
 The KV meeting was a meeting in the service of U.S. imperialism...."
 April 27:  Immediately after Karlovy Vary, the British CP releases a
 major policy statement on "Questions of Ideology" which differs widely from
 Soviet policy in advocating complete freedom of religion, artistic expres-
 sion, and "the free confrontation of different scientific theories and,
 when necessary, prolonged debate."  It also recognizes the.need for a
 diversity of democratic parties, "including these which do not accept, or
 oppose, the advance of socialism."
 In Paris, a state security court convicts two couples of s  in  on
 NATO for E. GermanX and sentences them to terms ranging from 12 to 20 years.
 April 27 and continuing:  Chinese media attack the Soviet revisionists
 heavily and repeatedly throughout the period:  the ch} arge of Soviet collu-
 sion with U.S. imperialism against China is now commonly included even
 in articles on other subjects, and even in tirades directed primarily
 against other countries -- the USA, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
 The "new sy stem" ' in Soviet economic management (production geared to
 profitability  and in Soviet agriculture also comes under exceptionally
 heavy attack, interpreted as further evidence of Soviet revisionist degen-
 eration toward the restoration of capitalism.  Noteworthy items include:
 ?- PEOPLE'S DAILY Observer April 30, "Soviet Revisionist Ruling Class Are
 Rank Traitors to the Vietnamese Revolution," responding to Brezhnev's public
 complaint at the East German Party Congress April 18 of Chinese Chinese
 refusal to take "united action" to help Vietnam, lists ten examples of
 how, over the last two years, the Soviets have "worked hand in glove with
 U.S. imperialism in a series of conspiratorial activities, unscrupulously

 resorting to the 'peace talks' hoax and alternating this with war black-
 mail. "
 ?_- A Chinese Defense Ministry May 2 accusation that 4 U.S. fighter planes
 had intruded into Chinese airspace includes the charge that the U.S.
 imperialists are expanding their aggressive war in Vietnam `'with the coordi-
 nation and instigation of the Sovi'pt revisionist leading clique."  PEOPLE'S
 DAILY takes up the theme on May 3 ,'.following which 500 Chinese demonstrate
 at the Soviet Embassy, pasting up slogans accusing the Soviets of conspir-
 ing with the U.S. to bomb China.   (Reuters, from "Soviet sources.")
 -- PEOPLE'S DAILY May 5 devotes half a page to extracts from Soviet pub-
 lications "revealing the extent to which capitalism is being restored in
 accelerated tempo in the Soviet countryside."  Same issue of PD has a short
 commentary, "Renegades Peddle Opium," based on Soviet publication of Bible
 stories for children, concluding that
 "you should also include that one about Judas Iscariot,  It
 would be a great help to the Soviet people in recognizing your dirty
 features as a handful of renegades if you acquaint the Soviet readers
 with the story of that traitor who betrayed Jesus Christ for 30
 pieces of silver."
 ..?.W NCNA May 6 reports that the Soviets have banned the distribution of
 PEKING REVIEW in the USSR, saying:  "Always timid as mice, the Soviet rev.
 ruling clique stands in mortal fear of the dissemination in the S.U. of
 Mao Tse-tung's thought, M.-L at its highest level in our era...."  PEOPLE'S
 DAILY same day brands Soviet implied accusations of Chinese-West German
 collusion as "lies fabricated in league with U.S. imperialism to slander
 China."
 PEOPLE'S DAILY article May 7 exploits a statement by Soviet Foreign Trade
 Minister Patolichev to TRUD, in which he :"smugly declared:   'I would like
 to make it perfectly clear that neither in the Asian countries, in the
 countries in the.Near East, nor in any other country have we been running
 at a loss in selling commodities."'
 "That is to say Soviet revisionist foreign trade must never 'run
 at a loss,' which means putting financial interests first.  Thisone
 sentence really speaks volumes.  But where has it the least flavor of
 socialism!  Where is the difference between it and the foreign trade
 of imperialism, capitalism! ...
 The Soviet revisionist leading clique frequently boasts of its
 'aid' through foreign trade to the EE countries and countries in Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America.  Patolichev's statement has now poked
 another hole in the disguise covering such 'aid.'  In the Soviet revi-
 sionists' foreign trade activities, 'aid' is a lie while the earning
 of profits is true,;, 'mutual benefits' and 'support' is a lie while
 exploitation and profits is true....

 Most severely exploited by the Soviet revisionists' unequal value
 exchange are the 'fraternal' countries and a number of other countries
 in Asia and Africa... markets for industrial goods and sources of
 agricultural products and consumer commodities....
 Of course, the Soviet revs' foreign trade does not exist merely
 for the sake of  profits.:  it is the Soviet rev. clique's tool for
 pushing their policies of rev. and great--power chauvinism, and it
 servestheir general line of 'Soviet-U.S. collaboration for world
 domination.'..."
 NCNA May 17 says that the mass demonstrations in Peking over the situa-
 tion in Tong Kong (see below) included "big character posters and cartoons
 deriding U.S. imperialism, British imperialism, and Soviet revisionism
 as paper tigers."'
 - A thousand demonstrators outside the Soviet Embassy in Peking on May 20
 carry oversize caricatures depicting Liu Shao-chi and Khrushchev as great
 friends.
 -.,. "Routine" collusion charges include:  collusion with the Pope (A 27);
 collusion with the U.S. in betrayal of the Arabs over Palestine (M 15);
 with the U.S. in European troop redeployment; with the U.S. in a proposed
 "international anti-ballistic missile defense" (M 10, 17); with India and
 Indonesia in SE Asian defense (M i6); etc.
 A r l 29:  All Moscow papers feature a communique on an April 28 Moscow
 meeting of a Greek CP delegation headed by First Secy Koliyiannis with
 Suslov and Pelshe, at which both "condemned the splitting activities" of
 the Chinese and "stressed the necessity of convening an international con-
 ference" of CPs.
 April-29-.and continuing:  Soviet media continue to give considerable atten-
 tion to events in China, mostly through critical reporting of chaos and
 strife resulting from the "political bacchanalia taking place there ... by
 the Mao Tse-tung group in its unprincipled struggle for power."  (Quote
 from Radio Moscow April 29.)  They cite other sources when possible:  e.g.,
 PRAVDA on A 29 publishes a Jordanian CP statement condemning "the crimes
 of the Mao Tse-tung group and his pernicious 'thought' "which have brought
 ``complete anarchy'" to China, "unleashed a case campaign of hatred against
 the CPSU, the Soviet people, and the USSR Govt," etc.

 May l:  May Day is celebrated by Communist govts and parties (and also by
 some non-Communists) around the world.  The celebration in Moscow is rela-
 tively low--key, with the French Chief of General Staff, Gen. Ailleret, as
 the first Western military guest on the Lenin Mausoleum since Gen. Eisen-
 hower in 1945:  the Chinese diplomats again walk out when Marshal Grechko
 implies that they are hindering united action in Vietnam.  In contrast,
 the militant celebration in Havana is keyed to the guerrilla struggle in
 Latin America, extols Che Guevara as a leader in this struggle, broadcasts
 recordings of his last major speech, and displays signs with his words:
 We must create two, three, and four Vietnams in LA."
 May 1 & 8:  At his regular press conferences, Thai Premier Kittikhachon
 describes stepped-up Communist terrorist activities in the northeast.
 May 1 & 17:  In West Germany Chancellor Kiesinger's May Day speech in West
 Berlin, he challenges East Germany to test his proposals for easing rela-
 tions between the peoples of the East and West (see #13, April 17-22).
 On the 17th West German spokesman Ahlers announces that Bonn is ending its
 policy of returning E. German communications unopened and has formed a
 special committee to deal with answers to three recent letters:  one from
 E.G. Premier Stoph to Kiesinger announced on May 11; and one each from
 the E.G. Ministers of Transport and post to their W.G. counterparts.
 May 3:  The Colombian Govt announces the capture of a courier involved in
 smuggling counterfeit passports to Cuba.
 May 4:  Cuban CP daily GRANMA publishes a full-page summary of Uruguayan
 CP SecyGen Arismendi's Lenin Day speech in Montevideo, a version which
 acknowledges but tones down A's stress on the continuing possibility of
 bloodless revolution.  Observers see the act as intended to repair Castro's
 strained relations with the Soviet-line CPs in LA on the eve of the con-
 ference of the Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO) scheduled to
 open in Havana July 28.
 May 6, 7:  Radio Moscow announces that the Chinese have decided to expel
 PRAVDA correspondent Pasenchuk, the fourth Soviet journalist since the CR

 NTa  6 and continuing:   tong Kong is thrown into a major crisis potentially
 threatening British control.  The: disturbances begin with a clash between
 police and Maoist-led sympathizers with workers at an artificial flower
 factory and are rapidly expanded into violent riots and orderly demonstra-
 tions.  Peking first reacts on the 15th with a strong Foreign Ministry  '
 protest to the British Embassy denouncing large-scale "bloody atrocities
 which "are the result of long premeditation and are a component part of
 the British Govt's scheme of collusion with U.S. imperialism against China"
 because the British authorities "mortally fear and bitterly hate China's
 GPCR. `'
 The Chinese Govt demands in all seriousness that the British Govt
 instruct the British authorities in Hong Kong as follows:
 Immediately accept all the just demands put forward by the Chinese
 workers and residents of Hong Kong;
 Immediately stop all fascist measures;
 Immediately set free all the arrested persons...;
 Punish the culprits responsible for these sanguinary atrocities, offer
 apologies to the victims, and compenstate for their losses;
 Guarantee against the occurrence of similar incidents." Anti-British demonstrations in Peking build up to a rally of 100,000 on
 the 18th attended by Chou En-lai, Chen Po-ta, Chen Yi, and Kuo Mo-jo.  In
 Shanghai, demonstrators break into the residence of the British Consul on
 the 16th and destroy the furnishings.  The British ignore Peking's threats,
 and the Hong Kong police (largely Chinese) seem to be controlling the situa-
 tion as the period ends, in the face of loudspeaker appeals to them to turn
 against the British.
 M7,  Rumanian CP daily SCINTEIA features a major theoretical article
 by SecyGen Ceausescu, "The Leading Role of the Party in the Stage of the
 Completion of Building Socialism," which, in its long international section,
 expands on the RCP's independence views (with apparent reference to  recent
 Soviet pressures):
 Each CP has the legitimate right to participate in an interna-
 tional meeting if it considers it necessary and useful, just as it has
 the legitimate right not to participate.  Internationalist solidarity
 is not a conference....   CPs who uphold that non participation in a
 conference must not affect, in any way whatsoever, comradely relations
 between parties... are perfectly correct.
 Such an approach ... contributes to eliminating old practices of
 linking inter--party relations to the acceptance or non-acceptance of a
 point of view and of exerting pressure in one form or another, all of
 which result in sharpening divergencies in the Communist movement.

 ...he normal development of the communist movement and the assertion
 of each CP as a vanguard political force of the working class and its
 people are incompatible with the existence of an international coordi-
 nating center, with the practice of setting compulsory norms of conduct
 for CPs....
 ... It is inadmissible under any form for a party member to establish
 or maintain, over the head of the leadership, relations with other
 parties, to supply information, and to participate in actions against
 the political line of his party....
 ... Relations must unfold in an organizational framework, from party
 to party.  An attempt Uy a_party to establish relations with members
 or groups within another party outside the organized frameowrk means
 an encroachment upon the principle of proletarian internationalism,
 an action splitting the unity of that party....
 ... It is the essential duty of each party not to undertake anything
 which might aggravate the divergencies in the Communist and workers
 movement, which might further deepen the abyss of division....
 Indian Chi weekly NEW AGE publishes a resolution of its National Council

 writers should intensify their "offensive against bourgeois ideology," strike
 hard against "vulgarizers of Marxism," and "help those misled by hostile
 propaganda to find the right track."  Editor Tvardovsky of the most liberal
 Soviet library journal NOVY I`MIR is elected to the Congress Presidium, as

 HANOI'S AIMS REVEALED, IN DOCUMENT
 25X1C10b
 (Editor's Note:   Three days after Hitler became Chancellor, he
 gave a lecture to top German military leaders, telling them
 that his over-riding aim was to restore German power, particu-
 larly military power:  pacifism and socialism should be "rooted
 put"; the people should be so indoctrinated that there could
 not be another collapse of morale on the home front; and the
 army should be strengthened by every possible means.   He stated
 his view that the only solution to German economic problems was
 to conquer territory in the East and "ruthlessly to Germanize"
 it, and he clearly implied that Germany would go to war unless
 the French took action before German rearmament was completed.
 One of the generals present took extensive notes on this meet-
 ing, but they were not available to the public for 20 years.
 Had they been known and publicized at the time, it seems possible
 that subsequent history might have been somewhat different.
 The record of General Nguyen Van Vinh's lecture, now avail-
 able to us one year after the lecture took place, appears to be
 just as valuable a document.   It needs to be made more widely
 known.)
 SITUATION:   On 28 January 1967, elements of the US 101st Airborne
 Division operating in Ninh Thuan province seized the notebook of a People's
 Revolutionary Party cadre member who had attended the 4th COSVN (Central
 Office, South Vietnam) Congress in April 1966*.   This notebook contained
 *The PRP is the Southern arm of the Lao Dong (North Vietnamese Workers'--

 evidently for purposes of concealment.   The COSVN is the PRP's Central
 Committee and functions as headquarters for military operations and for the
 National Liberation Front, which includes non-PRP elements but is controlled
 at each level by the PRP.   The'location of COSVN is believed to be Tay Ninh

 Communist governments.  When reading the speech, it isimportant to remember
 that Vinh was somewhat in the position of having to jus,ify Lao Dong-?NLF
 policy, which had failed to anticipate the large-scale intervention of the
 United States; also, while Vinh was quite frank about some problems and
 shortcomings, especially those which his listeners could be expected,tQ

 ity of ultimate success, the situation in the North Vietnamese support area,
 or the backing being received from other "socialist" countries.  The speech
 contains many interesting points, but the most important is perhaps the
 long description of Hanoi's plans for continuing to fight while negotia-

 EAST GERMANY CONTINUES TO PRESS FOR
 THIRD WORLD RECOGNITION
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   (UNCLASSIFIED):  While East Germany has brought pressure to
 bear on the other East European Satellite countries not to follow Rumania's
 move in recognizing the West German Government, it has also been beseeching
 the uncommitted governments of the Middle East and North Africa to recognize
 its own regime.    In the latter instance, there have been no immediate signs
 of success thus far.
 Foreign Minister Otto Winzer recently returned to East Berlin from a trip
 to Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, and Iraq without having made any concrete
 gains in East Germany's long-standing quest for diplomatic recognition.   The
 trip was obviously timed to take advantage of what East Germany hoped was
 Arab disenchantment with the Bonn Government:,  Arab League Secretary General
 Hassunah had recently gone to West Germany in an apparently unsuccessful bid
 to get more aid for the Arabs and to prevent any increase of'German assistance
 for Israel.   Before leaving on his trip, Winter denounced Bonn's policies
 toward the Israelis and the Arabs and stressed East Germany's common interests
 with the latter.  But while. on the trip, during which he offered economic aid
 in exchange for diplomatic recognition, it soon became apparent that recogni-
 tion will not come until some time in the future -- if at all.  See the at-
 tached interview which Winzer gave the East Berlin  radio correspondent in
 which he speaks of his discussions only in terms of results which "will bear
 fruit in the future."
 Arab propagandists reported Winzer's trip with varying degrees of accu-
 racy:   some papers reported that Egypt would grant diplomatic recognition to
 East Germany within two months while others stated Lebanon was not even con-
 sidering recognition.   In actual. fact, Winzer returned emptynanded.   The
 Arab League is scheduled to consider the entire German question when it meets
 in September, but it seems unlikely that even Egypt and Syria, the two coun-
 tries most favorably disposed toward the Communist regime in East Germany,
 will press full diplomatic recognition of it.
 Meanwhile, it can be expected that East Germany will continue its quest
 for recognition not only in the Arab World but also in other nations of the
 "developing" areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America -- as outlined in the
 (attached) article from the FOREIGN AFFAIRS BULLETIN published 25 January 1967
 by the Press Department of the East German Foreign Affairs Ministry:   "scien-
 tific and industrial" feet in the door aiming toward "long-term relations."

 1132-c.           COMMUNIST EXPLOITATION OF BAPTISTS
 25X1C10b
 "Churches must be free from the
 interference of the states, and
 all churches should, as far as
 their principles permit, abide by
 the laws of the state."  (From
 the statement issued by the 1955
 London Conference of the Baptist
 World Alliance)
 "Baptists are one of the most
 widely spread Christian sects...
 In their overwtelming majority
 they were hostile toward the Great
 October Socialist Revolution and
 the Soviet State. [Nevertheless]
 the Soviet Government, which sepa=rated State and Church, granted the
 Baptists freedom to practice their
 cult."  (From the Great Soviet
 Encyclopedia, 2nd Edition)
 `-SITUATION:    (UNCLASSIFIED)  How do the Baptists in the Soviet Union
 and other Bloc countries fare under Communist domination?  There is grow-
 ing evidence, even in the Soviet press, that some of them are carrying on
 militant activities "underground" and that the encouragement they receive
 from publications abroad is having a telling effect on the Communist
 regimes' atheistic campaigns.  Last summer there was an unusual number of
 items in Soviet media reporting on the Moscow Government's efforts to
 quash the activities of Baptists who live in the USSR and of those who
 visit there and bring religious literature with them from the Free World.
 Two examples of this follow.  The 16 July KOMSOMOLSKOYE ZNAMYA published
 an article about the domestic activities of the Baptists under the head-
 line "Thieves with a Prayerbook -- Spiritual 'Pastors' as They Are."  It
 said in part:
 "Baptist pastors daily rob children of their youth, poisoning
 their immature minds and hearts with religious narcotics.  For the
 crimes they have committed, the presbyter of the Evangelical-Christian
 sect, V. Golub, and the preachers N. Butkov and A. Balatski have been
 brought before the People's Court of the Kamennobrodeki region of
 Lugansk.  These are not grey-bearded old men but quite young:  Golub,
 the oldest, is only 36...These beguilers of souls decided to organize
 a school of their own to teach religious music.  Here, under the pre-
 text of learning to play stringed instruments, the children were
 taught psalms... The 'prophets' got what they deserved -- not for their
 faith but for the evil they had committed."

 Ten days earlier, in another typical report aimed at denigrating
 Baptists, TASS distributed for its worldwide outlets this report about
 tourists "smuggling religious books" being expelled from the USSR:
 "Three British motor tourists and a Dutch subject have been
 expelled from the USSR for attempting to smuggle in Baptist religious
 literature, TRUD reports today.  Anthony Richard iippisZey and his
 wife Anne Marie tried to smuggle through the border checkpoint in
 Brest 400 religious books donated by the British Z'oreign Biblical
 Society for illegal circulation in the USSR.  These books were con-
 cealed in eight secret compartments in their specially equipped VoZks-
 wagon.  Driving an Opel Rekord, two Baptist priests -- Murrey John, a
 British subject, and Fisser Johannes, a Dutch subject -- tried to
 smuggle 300 similar books into the USSR across the ryausheny check-
 point in Soviet Moldavia,  TRUD, the newspaper of Soviet trade unions,
 writes that the religious literature and the cars with secret compart-
 ments have been confiscated and the smugglers expelled from the USSR."
 (See the attached unclassified selection of clippings from Free World
 papers on other cases in 1966, as well as the translations of the 5 June
 and 30 August articles in IZVESTIYA attacking the Baptists.)
 The 29 March 1967 issue of the Swiss Radical Democratic NEUE ZURCHER
 ZEITUNG gives the background of the Baptist controversy in the Soviet
 Union.  The officially recognized Baptist leadership is the A1.1--Union
 Council of Evangelical-Christian Baptists; as=ide from the Russian Ortho-
 dox Church, this is the only church organization. permitted to function
 legally on a USSR-wide basis.*  Like the official Orthodox hierarchy,
 this All-Union Council is controlled by the Soviet regime.   In 2_960,
 the All-Union Council (no doubt at the insistence of the regime) decreed
 new statutes which were designed to discourage missionary activities and
 the introduction of children into service.   Obviously, the aim of these
 statutes was to let the Baptist church gradually wither away for lack
 a  new members.  Many church members became aroused not only at the content
 of the statutes, but also at the undemocratic way in which they were im-
 posed from outside.   The result was a counter-movement, launched by
 A. F. Prokofiev and G. K. Lriutchkov in 1961;  the movement calls itself
 the "I:nitsiativniki" ("Initiators").  The Soviet regime has responded
 *The All-Union Council of Evangelical Christians-Baptists was formed in
 1944 and today claims a membership of around 500,000 believers.   In 1927,
 following the initial increase in many religious sects in the decade after
 the Revolution, there were 500,000 members of the Baptist Union and 4,000,000
 members of the Union of Evangelical Christians.  The two groups steadily
 declined under pressures brought about by the Soviet regime and today their
 combined membership totals only that of the 1.927 Baptist segment.   (Not
 treated in this Guidance, but nevertheless a problem of similar magnitude,
 is the fate suffered by Baptists in other Communist countries, including
 90,000 in Rumania, 35,000 in Hungary, 9,000 in Bulgaria, and lesser numbers
 in East Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Cuba --- the latter having arrested
 in recent years several Baptist mi:zisters on espionage charges.)

 with, among other things, two decrees (of 18 March and 22 September 1966)
 which place new restrictions on worship and the religious instruction of
 children, and forbid  religious demonstrations of any kind.  The two news
 stories quoted above are reflections of the Soviet policy of trying  to
 make religion die out.
 (Further information on the history of confrontation between the
 Baptists and the Communists is contained in the attached article, "Russian
 Baptists Quote Lenin in Plea for Religious Tolerance," an unclassified item
 prepared by USIA which may be used for background purposes.)
 Attention was again focused on the Baptist problem last fall when
 the Government-sanctioned Evangelical-Baptist Church leadership held an
 All-Union Congress in October in an attempt to bring the dissident
 "Initsiativniks" back into the fold.   (Note --                          This
 may have been partially successful, but the American Embassy in Moscow re-
 ports that "the seriousness of the Government's continued concern is well
 reflected by repeated references in the press to public demonstrations by
 the schismatics and to the apparent willingness of their leaders to accept
 martyrdom rather then submit to the demands of the Soviet authorities.")
 PRAVDA VOSTOKA reported on 22 October a trial of four Baptists in
 Tashkent, the chief defendant being N. P. Khrapov, described as the head
 of the South Asian Branch of the dissident Union of Churches of Evangeli-
 cal Christians-Baptists.   The article said Khrapov had recently served
 three years in:prison for "antisocial activity" and it gave considerable
 details of illegal publications allegedly being distributed by the "Initia-
 tors".   The group's journal VESTNIK SPASENIYA (Herald of Salvation) and
 a number of underground pamphlets were said to contain "slander against
 Soviet society."
 How serious a problem the Soviet Government considers the dissident
 Baptists today is perhaps best illustrated by an article in the September
 1966 issue of the official atheistic propaganda organ NAUKA I RELIGIYA
 (Science and Religion) which complained that the "Initiators" are produc-
 ing a number of illegal publications and have adopted a policy of such
 o v e r t defiance' to authority as :
 "...collective singing of psalms in buses and at bus stops,
 in railway cars and at stations, religious processions and services
 in the streets, in squares, and in buildings of state institutions,
 and the creation of special schools and groups for instructing child-
 ren in religion."
 Another problem which the Baptists present to the Soviet Government
 is their stand on military service: see unclassified attachment to BPG
 Item # 1057 of 12 September 1966, "Communist Exploitation of Conscientious
 Objectors," which notes reports of Baptists being arrested in Moscow for
 demonstrating against military service and sentenced to prison terms in
 Cherkessk for refusing on religious grounds to serve in the Army.   (END

 1133.              VIETNAM WAR:  CONTINGENCY PLANNING
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:    In the event that the U.S. decides it is necessary to
 mine or bomb Haiphong Harbor or its approach channels, we can expect a
 major propaganda barrage from the opposition.   Hard intelligence has
 indicated that the East Germans are even planning to send a camera team
 to Haiphong to film the bombing of the harbor for propaganda purposes.
 To date U.S. planes have not bombed the Harbor and the SS Dartford,
 which was flying the British flag when recently damaged in Haiphong Har-
 bor, is now believed to have been hit by North Vietnamese antiaircraft
 fire or debris from exploding SAMs.   The SS Dartford was not the bbject
 of accidental U.S. bombing as was feared when the news first broke.
 The U.S. has apparently refrained thus far primarily because of
 the foreign shipping (mostly Soviet and Chinese) that regularly offloads
 in Haiphong Harbor.   The great bulk of supplies for North Vietnam comes
 from the USSR rather than from closer-by China and much of this materiel
 moves by sea past U.S. warships into Haiphong.  Aerial reconnaissance
 suggests that the Soviets have limited sea-borne goods to those usable
 for peaceful as well as military purposes such as oil, trucks, medicines,
 pontoon bridges, structural steel, machine tools, etc.   Soviet equip-
 ment whose war use is unmistakable such as radar sets, antiaircraft guns,
 SAMs, aircraft and the like is believed to be routed by rail through
 China.
 According to experts, the most reliable recent figures in open
 sources on Soviet and other foreign equipment shipped to North Vietnam
 appeared in a WALL STREET JOURNAL article of 14 February.  The WSJ staffer
 had been briefed by State and Defense experts and the text into which
 he wove the statistics they gave him can supply the basis for discussion
 on the subject.   The article is included as an unclassified attachment.

 Guide to Lecture by_NE;y_en Van Vinh, Chairman
 of Reunification Department, Lao Dong Central Committee
 Vinh's remarks in his lecture to the 4th COSVN Congress, held in
 April 1966, were wide-ranging,   Some sections remain somewhat obscure, as
 they refer to doctrinal positions taken at the earlier plenums of the Lao
 Dong Central Committee.  Moreover, the treatment of various subjects in
 the lecture often overlaps.   Nevertheless, Vinh's lecture provides clear
 and decisive evidence on questions of major interest.
 The following are major points which emerge from the record:
 1)  There is close control by the North Vietnamese regime over the
 Viet Cong, and the former closely supports the latter.   The existence of
 Hanoi control is evident from the very fact that the speech was given by
 a North Vietnamese leader and recorded by a Viet Cong member, and also from
 the whole tone and setting of Vinh's remarks, accompanied as they were
 by remarks by the NLF Commander, Nguyen Chi Thanh.   Specifically, Vinh
 expounds the significance of the resolutions of the Lao Dong Central
 Committee (pp. 1-5).   He says, for example:   "Execution of the resolution
 is a major requirement," (p. 3)--evidently a requirement for his Southern
 listeners as well as for the North.   He uses the first person plural, clear-
 ly including his audience among the "we" or "our" (e.g., "Our advance must
 pass through many transitory steps"- p.5).   On page 7, Vinh says:   "We have
 main force units, regional troops, guerrillas, and the masses..."    On page 9,
 Vinh claims that "the enemy" will have to increase his strength to 700;000
 or 800,000 men "in order to be able to stop reinforcements from North Viet-
 nam.  Without doing so they will be unable to stop our growth in the
 South." This is a frank statement of the importance of North Vietnamese
 infiltration to the war.   Further on, Vinh says (p. 11) that one of the
 goals is to "advance toward national unification."  In discussing negotia-
 tions, Vinh envisages close coordination between Hanoi and the Viet Cong;
 one might negotiate while the other continues fighting   (p. 15).   Towards
 the end of his remarks, Vinh states:
 "We can thus conclude that even if the Americans intensify their
 air raids, we will still stand firm to protect the North and re-
 inforce the South...The Northern citizens have clearly realized
 their responsibility with regard to this matter. Therefore, they
 have provided reinforcements to the best of their ability." (pp.20-21)
 2) Although Hanoi refuses to be dominated by any particular Bloc country,
 it receives large quantities of supplies from Communist states.   Indeed,
 Hanoi seems to profit by playing off` the Soviet and Chicom rivals against
 each other.   It is possible that, in the interests of boosting morale,
 Vinh may have somewhat exaggerated the quantity of material aid (pp. 18-21)
 or the willingness of the big Communist powers to spring to the defense of
 North Vietnam (p. 9).   But attention should be given to his statement that
 China provides nearly half the budget of "the South" (presumably the NLF) and

 that Soviet aid became extensive after the fall of Khrushchev (p.21).
 One may wonder if the Chinese provide such support without making some
 effort to use it to increase their influence..  And it appears that the
 step-up in Soviet aid preceded t;se big increase in U.S. aid and support
 to Saigon in early 1965, which ob" course was a response to ominous Viet
 Cong successes.
 A rather striking series of` revelations appears on p. 15:
 "China holds the view that Condit-ions for negotiations are not yet
 ripe, not until a few years from now, and, even worse, seven years
 from now.,   In the meantime, we should continue fighting to bog down
 the enemy, and should wait until a number of so ialist countries
 acquire adequate conditions for strengthening their main force
 troops to launch a strong, ail-out, arid rapid offensive, using all
 types of weapons and heeding no borders.   What ;,e should do in the
 South today is to try to restrain the enemy and. make him bogged
 down, waiting until China has built strong forces to launch an all-
 out offensive,"
 In other words, Hanoi and the Viet Cong should confi:c.e themselves to
 guerrilla warfare and await liberation by modernized Chicom forces In
 seven years.   It is easy to see why this  Chicom proposal has little
 attraction  for Hanoi; aside from uncertainty as to ?;~hether China can
 meet any such timetable (an uncertainty which has increased since Vinh
 spoke), such a procedure would tend to weaken Viet G:ong morale and
 make  Hanoi a vassal of Peking.   Vinh says,  "We must achieve decisive
 vict_or1r within the next four years" (p. 21), a,nd he admits that "we
 are worried" over the disunity in the "socialist camp"  (p.  21,).
 3)  While Vinh assumes an a__r of confider(-,e   va,ious remarks indicate
 some of the problems facing Hano:. and the Viet Cone  On page 5, he admits
 that, "at certain moments, certain people underestima:~ed the U.S. imperial-
 ists and overestimated. the heroism of the Southern p,eeople."  "Cur strength,"
 he says, "does not suffice to de'ea.t the Americans," (p. 7) On. page 13,
 he says that ARVN troops occupy "over 250 districts": it is believed
 likely that he meant 250 district capitals, as there are only about 250
 districts in all.   (On p. 1b, Vinh says that forces must be introduced into
 the cities.)  Vinh indicates that quite a number of "nationalist countries
 in Asia, Africa, and Latin America" have doubts about the ability of Hanoi
 and the Viet Cong to defeat the Americans (p.         He complains that the
 build-up of forces on his side has been slow; in say.a.ng that, the guerrillas
 were previously 10 percent or the population, and that now the proportion
 is as small as 1 percent in some areas, he seems to imply that, the over-
 all proportion of guerrillas to population has declined (p. 16).   In
 another place (p. 17) he says the building of guerrilla forces has been
 unsatisfactory.   There are d.itficulties with the recruitment of youth:
 "It is necessary to carefully consider why we cannot recruit youths to
 replenish our forces."  The enemy would have been defeated if he had been
 unable to replenish his forces, but (unlike the VC guerrilla.sj he was
 able to replace and supplement his strength (p. 17).   ]Remarks on pp. 16 and
 17 also suggest that the Viet Cong has often failed to retain control of

 areas it has "liberated."  Vinh makes no mention of napalm or poison gas,
 but the use of chemical defoliants, he says, has made the Lao Dong Central
 Committee "very concerned" (p. 18).   While claiming that transportation
 capabilities have doubled, Vinh says transportation on roads is almost
 nonexistent in daylight, and that the requirements of the 14th Zone (the
 North Vietnamese area bordering on the Demilitarized Zone) and the South
 are: not being met (p. 20).   He indicates that North Vietnamese missile
 units have failed to meet the 100 percent "kill rate" set by the Soviet
 Union.  Although MIG 21's are dodged by the enemy, "the MIG 21's have
 not yet been widely used" (p. 19).  As already noted, Hanoi is worrried
 over the lack of unity in the "socialist camp"--yet North Vietnam itself
 insists on pursuing an independent line.
 4+)   For Hanoi, the war-is not merely a military struggle, but a
 political one, and success depends on deceiving the enemy, particularly
 by pretending to negotiate while continuing the fighting.   Like other
 Communists, the leaders in Hanoi turn the formula of Clausewitz around;
 they believe that politics is the continuation of war by other means.
 It had been necessary to defeat the French colonial army militarily to
 get the French out of Vietnam, but in 1966, the Lao Dong believed that
 "after defeating a greater bulk of the puppet army and an important
 part of American troops, we can push the Americans out of South Viet-
 nam by coordinating the political struggle with diplomacy"  p. 5).   In
 an interesting passage, Vinh says that a situation in which the "puppet
 troops" have not been completely annihilated provides a condition for the
 Americans to withdraw, while if the "puppet administration" is completely
 eliminated, there are no conditions for the Americans to withdraw; this
 seems to mean that in the former case, the Americans could withdraw with-
 out a complete loss of face and with some self-deception as to an agree-
 ment being possible "between Vietnamese" (between the Saigon government
 and the Hanoi-directed National Liberation Front), while in the latter
 case, there would be a simple military contest between Vietnamese Communists
 and the United States, which the Communists would be unable to win. (p. 5).
 The Americans must be forced to "eat rice with chopsticks" (engage in a
 political-guerrilla competition), and the Vietnamese Communists should
 avoid "eating rice with spoons and forks" (engaging in a war of position)
 (p.8).   Vinh says:   "Under these conditions [of politico-guerrilla war-
 fare], if they force us to surrender while we are not defeated, then they
 are defeated" (p. 8); this epigram appears to signify that if there was
 a Viet Cong military surrender which did not involve an end to the VC's
 political struggle, the U.S. would have failed to achieve its political
 objecti.e.
 Vinh reveals that the 11th (1965) Lao Dong Resolution foresaw the
 possibility of a situation where fighting and negotiations were conducted
 simultaneously (pp. 13-16).
 "Fighting while negotiating is aimed at opening another front
 with a view to making the puppet army more disintegrated, stimulating
 and developing the enemy's internal contradictions, and, thereby,
 making him more isolated in order to deprive him of the propaganda

 weapons, isolate him further, and make a number of people who mis-
 understood the Americans clearly see their nature" (p. iii).
 Such tactics, Vinh notes, were used during the Vietnamese war against the
 French and in China (i.e., prior to 1949).   They cannot, however, be employed
 "as long as we have not yet acquired adequate strength" (p. 14).   Further
 on, 9inh indicates that the required conditions for negotiation amount to
 conditions overwhelmingly favorable to his side:   e.g., enemy troops should
 be withdrawn and their bases dismantled, or in a slightly di:rfe.rent version,
 the "puppet forces" must be concentrated in barracks, must not herd people
 into strategic hamlets, and the Americans must be stationed at the wharves.
 (p. l6).
 Fn the Lao Dong system of teought, "fighting while negotiating also
 represents a principled step in tee evolution of the war" (p. 11+).   This
 exercise in bad, faith might take place in several ways:   "It is possible
 that the North conducts negctiations while the South [the National Libera-
 tion Front] continues fighting, aed that the South also participates in
 the negotiations while continuing to fight" (p. 15).  As the Lao Dong sees
 it, no considerable success can be achieved in negotiations if fighting
 stops while the negotiations are going on.   But--"if we conduct, negoti.a-
 tions while fighting vigorously, we can also take advantage of the opportun-
 ity to step up the political struggle, military proselyting (sic), and
 activities in the cities.   Thus, we will take advantage of the opportunity
 offered by the negotiations to step up further our military attacks,
 political struggle and military proselyting  (sic)"  (p.  15).   Vi.nh :indicates
 that "a number of East European socialist countries" .gold similar views:
 they think "that conditions do prevail,  and are ripe for achieving success
 (.The Americans would withdraw their trope and we wi l_1. continue the
 strug ;le to achieve total success).   These socialist countries also posed
 a number of conditions? cessation of the bombing of the North; gradual with-
 drawal of U.S. troops from the South" (p~ 14).

 3)   Some ideas on the nature and characteristics of the war.
 +)   Strategic missions and guidelines.
 - Resolution #9 assessed the balance of forces between us and the

 to a high degree and having the factors of a limited war.
 - Resolution #12 noted the characteristics and nature of the special
 war developed into a limited war which still have the character of the
 special war.   Determination of the party'to win the limited war.
 B.   Necessary conditions to be held fast.
 There are two points to be held fast:
 a)  Dialectics on ideological methods.
 b)  Steadfast determination and spirit of thorough revolution.

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060001-2
 a)  Dialectics on ideologLcal methods:
 It is necessary to pay attention to the difference between the
 natural world and the development of human society.
 The rules concerning the development of the natural wor~_d can be
 asserted. For example, at 99.5 degrees water does not boil.   It will
 boil at a fixed temperature.   At zero degrees it will freeze and become
 _.ce.
 As for the development of human society, there may be this possi-
 bility or the other.   For example, we assert that when 200,000, 300,000
 or 1+00,000 Americans have been annihilated, the enemy will be defeated.
 Yet, sometimes when a small number of the enemy has been annihilated, he
 is defeated; sometimes when a large number of the enemy has been anni-
 hi.:Lated, he is not yet defeated.   The former resolution (11th) stated
 that victory would be won in a relatively short period of ti:are, from
 s.:several to four years.   It was a flexible statement.   The latter resolu?-
 tion (12th) also stated that decisive victory would be won i:ri a vela=
 Lively short period of time (a few years).   This must also be understood
 .uus a flexible statement, since it is impossible to ascertain one or two
 years.   However, the time must not be spoken of as unlimited? and in
 speaking of a protracted struggle one may not "'say it is protracted.,
 unlimited."' As far as thinking methods are concerned, if one thinks
 mechanically and inflexibly he will be unjustifiably optimistic, or be-
 come pessimistic when he Las not yet seen victory.   How long a time
 depends  on subjective and objective factors, and on the evolution of
 these factors.
 b)  It is necessary to have a steadfast determination and a _!pir:it of
 thorough revolution.
 Speaking of war is speaking of the worst; difficulties and hardships
 in life. To win the war is a very difficult undertaking which requires
 boundless energy.   When we spea., of achieving success within a relatively
 short period of time., it means that we assert our determination, and when
 we saw so, the difficulties have been taken into consideration.  When
 we say that even if the Americans introduce such and such number of
 troops we still can defeat them, it means that we assert our determina-
 tion to overcome all difficulties in order to achieve success.                       When we
 speak of winning the war, even -:hough the Americans increase the number
 of their troops, and achieve decisive success within a relatively short
 period of time, it means that we are determined to overcome countless
 difficulties before success is achieved.   Such a statement is not theo-
 retical, but is 50 percent prac7;ical.   It is on the basis of this state-
 merit that we strengthen our determination to defeat the U.S. aggressors.
 "herefore, it is necessary to have the spirit of thorough revolution and
 a very high determination.

 With regard to the general offensive (TCK) and general uprising
 (TKN), it was requested that a concrete plan, including the quantity
 of weapons needed, the number of armed force's needed, etc., be made
 known in order to carry out the undertaking confidently.   For secrecy's
 sake, it is not yet necessary to reveal information on these matters.
 Therefore, we must firmly grasp the above two matters and. express
 unanimous agreement with the TW (the Lao Dong Party Central Committee),
 and, in the process of struggle, try to understand them better and supple-
 ment the resolution.
 Execution of the resolution is a major requirement.   Yet, the
 greater requirement is to execute the resolution creatively in the days
 ahead.   In the course of the war, it is possible that some locality,
 district, or province may be levelled and may sustain serious losses.
 3.   Some matters concerning the characteristics and nature of the war.
 There has been much discussion on the nature of the war--special,
 limited, colonialist, and neocolonialist.   The matters which we discuss
 here have also been discussed in the North.
 Speaking of the special war, limited war, colonialist, or neo-
 colonialist war is trying to find answers to the following questions:
 Do the political and military war and the three-pronged offensive still
 exist?  Do TCK and general uprising (TKN) still exist?
 In general and unified terms, to speak of a just war and an unjust
 war.   When a war develops, it is called variously an aggressive war, a
 national liberation war, a war among the imperialists, or a war between
 the two camps.
 Formerly, we spoke only of limited war and world war.   The scope
 of the war was then understood likewise.   When we spoke of limited war,
 we took into account i:s scope.   And when the U.S. imperialists began
 to change their war strategy (the "flexible reaction strategy"), they
 defined war as follows:   world war, limited war, and the war whose scope
 is inferior or to that of the limited war (special war).  When they
 spoke of special war, we did not just follow him.   In fact, the enemy
 actually changed his strategy.
 The TW resolution said:   in the Americans' view, the conduct of
 the special war relics mainly on the puppet army and administration. With
 the characteristics of the present situation, the war that is most

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060001-2
 appropriate for a neocolonia._is, policy in a country where there exists
 a national liberation movement is the specia_ war.   The special war is
 just a type of limited war, but its scope is inferior to that of the
 limited war,   And since the special war takes place in South Vietnam, it
 bears the character of a conflict between the two camps, gradually
 becomes a limited war, ana will develop to a higher intensityr and larger
 scope.   it is now obvious that the war has become a, limited war, since
 the enemy has increased the number of his troops tc more than 200,000.
 At this point, how must the "spe2ial?' concept be understood?  Special
 war must be understood yn the sense that it is a "separate" type of war,
 not in the sense ascribed by the Americans.   Ere'alously, there was an
 erroneous analysis:  if the imperialists increase the number of their
 troops to 200,000, the war will become an old-type aggressive war.   (In
 calling a war special the Americans take into cons_deration its scale
 --large or small-while we understand "special" or? "separate" as the
 nature of the war).   To speak of (words uninteilig_i_ble) is to speak of
 the purpose of the war:   _,t ha-_ a neccolon c.at.st na.?ure.   Even if the
 number of enemy troops is increased t.o 300,000, `500,000 or 600,000, the
 purpose of the war remains to :.mpose neocoi.cnlaiism.
 The fact that the imperia._lsts firmly rr,aintain neocolonialism. is
 di.:re to the following reasons:
 - Old-type colonialism has been opposed and cursed by the peoples
 in the world and the oppressed peoples, aid theref:ire, has no conditions
 for survival; and colonial sys-tems have continuously disintegrated every-
 where.   The U.S. imperialists realized that it they  id not resort to
 new-type colonialism they wouli not be able to maintain colonialism.
 - Science and techniques nave developed.   Various countries which
 had won independence but which were under the bourgeois' control also
 needed aid to maintain their regime,:-.   1'h e.r?c fore, the Americans have
 taken advantage of --.his  situation to penetrate into these countries and
 gain net profits.
 - The U.S. imperial.:.sts are wealthy :rmp)erla.ii.sts.   They have engaged
 in .large-scale business, retail business.   They possess ample capital,
 and could use money and iaerchandise to ir.:fluence, dominate, and exploit
 many other countries using neocolon__alist methods, and, thereby gain
 greater net profits.  WhLle no imperialists whatsoever could wage aggres-
 sion through old colonia ism, the imperialists could still deceive a
 number of people by wagi:ig aggression through neocolonialism.
 Although the present, limited war in the South still has its "sepa-
 rate"                          nature and still ties within the category of implementation of a
 r..ceocolonialist policy, it sti._i relies upon the puppet army and adminis-
 t ration.

 Formerly, during the French domination period, we had to defeat the
 French expeditionary troops, and only by basically defeating these troops
 could the French be defeated, whereas at present we must crush mainly
 the puppet army.   As far as the American troops are concerned, we do
 not fight them in the same way as we did against the French.
 To defeat the enemy in the South is to basically defeat the puppet
 army and to defeat part of the American troops, and, thereby, smash
 the Americans' aggressive will.   If we fail to see the role of the pup-
 pet army and administration, we will fail to use our own forces to a
 certain extent to basically smash the puppet forces, and, thereby
 deprive the Americans of their military and political base.   Likewise,
 without defeating an important part of the American forces we cannot
 crush their aggressive will.   In reality, today the relations between
 fighting the Americans and fighting the puppets have become increasingly
 clearer.   In the old colonialist period, only by defeating the aggres-
 sive army would the imperialists consent to being defeated.                                With neo-
 colonialism, after defeating a greater bulk of the puppet army and an
 important part of American troops, we can push the Americans out of South
 Vietnam by coordinating the political struggle with diplomacy.
 With regard to strategy, the situation in which the puppet troops
 have not yet been completely annihilated does also provide a condition
 for the Americans to withdraw.   This is true with regard to the question
 of sovereignty:   if we completely eliminate the puppet administration,
 there are no conditions for the Americans to withdraw.   If we speak only
 of a local war, there may be errors in strategy and possibly im leader-
 ship over the strategy.   Our advance must pass through many transitory
 steps.
 Evaluation and comparison of the enemy forces and our forces:
 So far, our evaluation has been correct.   But at certain moments,
 certain people underestimated the U.S. imperialists and overestimated
 the heroism of the Southern people.   Evaluation of the Americans is very
 difficult.   Some people believe that it is difficult to defeat the U.S.
 imperialists, because it is often said that the U.S. imperailists are
 the most powerful imperialists:   their manpower is great, their forces
 are large, and they have atomic weapons.   In expressing this view,
 these people create the impression that the imperialists are strong.
 This is also a reality.   The people who believe in this view are not few.
 For years, there has been a constant discussion of this problem in
 our camp.   Without the war in Vietnam, how can this problem be solved?
 How can one explain our victories over the U.S. imperialists who have
 gross national product of 650 billion dollars against our gross national
 product of 3 billion, who have a population of 200 million against our
 population of 30 million, who have 3 million men in their armed forces
 against our armed forces of 1 million men in both zones?

 Yet despite this big difference between the two sides--one side is
 t;wo large and other too small--our small country dares fight the Ameri-
 cans and defeat them.   It is difficult to make people believe that a
 small country such as ours can defeat the U.S. impe=rialists who have
 great economic and military potentialities.   Therefore, our struggle is
 a great contribution to the discussions of the evaluation of and. com-
 parison between our forces and the enemy's.                          Usually, people easily
 discern the enemy's strong points and do not see his weak points.   Only
 through defeating him can we see his weak points.   For instance, intelli-
 gence services of various countries--no matter how clever they are--
 cannot know all the techniques of the U.S. planes.   We know them
 because we have downed these planes and studied these aircraft, we have
 interrogated the captured pi,iots.
 We know the enemy's material strength, his tactics and techniques.
 But there are things we cannot know even through our intelligence ser-
 vice or through documents which have been supplied to us in order that
 we could understand and evaluate the enemy better.
 it is said that U. S. planes are modern.   If wer do not attack them,
 they remain modern.   However, if we attack and down them, they become
 outmoded.   (The enemy has said that his planes have become outmoded)
 Summarily appraising a small country such as curs which dares to
 fight against and win over the Americans is an important problem.   As
 for estimating how many troops the enemy will introduce and a-1 what
 rate, this task sometimes cannot be done thoroughly.   Basically, our
 Party has evaluated the U.S. imperialists relatively accurately.
 (At that time) our Party made such an evaluation,   But later it
 changed its mind from time' to time.   Thus, it was afraid of the Ameri-
 c?an.s dared not fight them.   It,.cept on discussing and, arrived at no con-
 elusion.   If it dared fight them, it would have been able ".,o understand
 ahem better and evaluate them. more correctly.
 Under the present war situation, the forces of both sides have
 increased greatly.   U.S.  and satellite troops have increased quickly.
 Ours have increased too.   Both rides have used these force.,  to  fight
 ,ac::h other.   Now the problem consists of finding the best way to com-
 pare the two forces.   The fact that U.S.  forces are. strong ie_, obvious to
 a.1__. But against whom are they fighting? They are strong.,   but  are they
 capable of defeating us?    To which side does the evaluation c_:f the com-
 parative balance of forces swing?  It is obvious that the comparative
 balance of forces gradually swings in our favor.   We may not imagine
 that we only have endurance.  We must see that  our  strength is growing.

 The Americans are stronger than us militarily and materially.   Yet, how
 do they use this strength, and how are they fighting against us?  We
 have main force units, regional troops, guerrillas, and the masses,
 whereas they cannot introduce into the South as large military forces
 as they want.   As far as the material factors are concerned, we have to
 use a weak force to fight, against a, strong force.   Yet, considering all
 factors combined, it is we, not the enemy, that are strong.   Thus, a com-
 parison of the forces of both sides shows that we are stronger than the
 enemy.   Our victory over him is not chancy, nor is it temporary.   Pre-
 viously, we said we could defeat the Americans even if they had 150,000
 or 200,000 troops.   It was a theoretical statement.   However, this state-
 ment has now become a fact which has been proved by realities.
 In short,  (two words unint,el:ligi.ble), why are we victorious?
 - We have the correct leadership of the Party.
 - The Southern people and army, and the Vietnamese people and army
 are heroic.
 - We firmly grasp the rules of the people's war.
 - We insure self-reliance.
 -? We enjoy the wholehearted supported of the peoples in the world,
 and of our camp.
 If we speak only of the quantity of forces, other countries also have
 forces.   Yet, if we go deeply into the realities, we find that the
 quality and combat value of our people are very great.   Our fourteen
 million people are better than 70 million (Indonesian) people and the
 200 million American people.   This fact cannot be explained by the matter
 of quantity.
 It does not suffice to say that we use a weak force to fight against
 a strong  force.   We must also understand how strong our main points
 are, and must explain under what conditions we are strong.   Thus, we
 must say that our. South is strong.   Yet, our strength does not suffice
 to defeat the Americans.   It is now fit to say that there can be no
 unlimited escalation in the North, and there can be no complete destruc-
 tion in the present situation in the South.
 In the Korean War, what was different from the situation in South
 Vietnam was that when the Americans -introduced (520,000) troops (includ-
 ing satellite troops) into Korea, they sent them all to the frontline
 because their rear base was secure, whereas in South Vietnam, when the
 Americans introduce 300,000 or 1!00,000 troops they cannot send them all
 to the frontline.   Taylor recentLy said that "we should calculate the

 number of troops we :rust :_ntrocuce, and w?en and under what circumstances
 these troops must be introduced in order to defeat the enemy," and that
 11 if we introduce our troops at a time when. the adversary is strong, we
 cannot defeat him."  Therefore, the Americans have realized that they
 did not, introduce their troops at the right time.
 The second condition is that when troops are introduced there must
 be a strong administration, which is nonexistent in South Vietnam.   At
 present, the Americans st..l1 hold that because the number of Americans
 introduced into the South is insufficient they cannot win.   Therefore,
 as long as they still bel:;eve that if they introduce more troops they
 can win, they will pursue the war.   As soon as they see that no Matter
 how many troops they introduce they are still. defeated, then their aggres-
 :cive will be crushed..   Formerly, the French sent 2,0,000 troops to fight
 against us.   After a period of time, they realized that they could not
 win even if they introduced more troops,   In Algeria., with 700,000
 French troops and 100,000 puppet troops, the French could not, win the
 war.   They realized that. to win the war, the most important factor is
 not. strength, but tactics.
 Now we are fighting the Americans with existing number of troops
 and weapons.   In a war of position, they can defeat us.   But with our
 present tactics, we will win, and they will be defeated.    It is the same
 as if we force them to eat. rice with chopsticks  (if' we eat rice with
 spoons and forks like them., we will be defeated; if' chopsticks are-
 used, they are no match for US).
 -
 Under these conditions, if they force us to surrender while we are
 riot defeated, then they are defeated.
 In combat, a number of localities and comrades may be hurt.   But
 it is incorrect to base oneself' on the fact '..hat when some localities
 are damaged and. some comrades are sacri:=seed, we are then defeated.
 In South Korea, the enemy sent all his troops to the front.   In
 ;Uou.th Vietnam, he has introduced between 300,000 to 600,000 troops who
 must fight on the frontline and, at the same time, protect the rear.
 But the latter can fulfill only one of these tasks.   If they oppose our
 ,people's movement in the South, they will be unable to stop reinforce-
 ments from North Vietnam.   If they concentrate their force to stop rein-
 t:'o:rcements from North Vietnam, they cannot stand firm on the front in
 the .rear.   If all their troops are sent to the front, their rear will be
 Left unguarded.   If they leave part of their troops in the rear, they
 will. not be strong enough to fight us on the front.   To fulfill both
 tasks, they must have a million troops.   To :.ntroduce a million troops
 into South Vietnam, the United Mates must double its mobilisation rate.

 If the war is expanded to North Vietnam, the balance of forces will
 be changed.   The front will be changed too.   The enemy will have to
 fight not only the Vietnamese people, but also the Chinese people.   The
 enemy is still afraid of this outcome.   Establishing their front in Laos
 is not an easy task.   If the Americans attack Laos, because of the 1962
 Geneva Accords they will face North Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China
 which will join the war to a certain extent.   they are planning to send
 their troops to Laos.   But does this mean the opening of a new front?
 The Americans are capable of doing this.   But they are weighing the pros
 and cons because if they send troops there, the form of the war will
 change.
 The enemy has not achieved unanimity concerning the problem of
 expanding the war to Laos and North Vietnam; but they have achieved
 relative unanimity concerning the problem of introducing troops into
 South Vietnam.
 Thus, they introduced troops at a moment when their special war had
 failed and they were in a state of strategic passivity.   If they raise
 their strength to 400,000 men, this means that their 300,000 men have
 been defeated.   But the introduction of 400,000 men into South Vietnam
 means that they would raise their strength to 700,000 or 800,000 men in
 order to be able to stop reinforcements from North Vietnam.   Without
 doing so they will be unable to stop our growth in the South.   That is
 why the Americans cannot thoroughly use their power in the war against us.
 4.   Strategic missions, guidelines, and leadership:
 There are some misunderstandings concerning the strategic missions,
 guidelines, and leadership and the relations among the three problems.
 Strategic missions are clearly stated in the resolution of the 12th
 Party conference.   There are two strategic missions:   the general stra-
 tegic mission, and the strategic mission in South Vietnam.   The strategic
 mission in South Vietnam consists of defeating the imperialists and
 feudalists, and achieving land reforms.   Its'immediate task consists of
 overthrowing the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys.
 To what extent the war will develop?  How must the Americans be
 restrained and defeated?  The exertion of strategic leadership varies in
 each period of time.   Yet, the strategic mission remains unchanged no
 matter how many troops the Americans may introduce into the South.   Each
 time the enemy introduces more troops, some people contend that the enemy
 has not been fully evaluated, and that the strategic missions have not
 been clearly set forth.   In fact, the strategic mission has already been
 ,set forth, and it remains unchanged.   We continue to pursue it.   As long
 as the war remains within the South, the strategic mission remains
 unchanged.  When the war is extended to the North, the strategic mis-
 sion will be different.                                 Some people asked why we did not assert in

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060001-2
 advance that limited war would break out, so that -:.he mission we had set
 forth would become out of date.   This problem is not like having an
 ample shirt made so that it suits one when he grown  up.   That is not
 correct.
 When the war in the ~3outh remains within the __.imits of a special
 war, we must restrain and defeat   the enemy in thin, and must at the
 same time take precautionary measures against limited war.  When the
 war has become alimited war, we must restrain and defeat the enemy in
 this war, and, at the same time, take precautionary measures against
 the enemy's expansion of the war throughout the country.
 As far as the leadership is concerned, it is necessary to restrain
 and defeat the enemy in the above types of war in the South, not to
 allow the enemy to expand the war, and to restrict the losses he inflicts
 on the people.   This effort is ours to exert.   It, is wrong to say that
 we failed to restrain and defeat the enemy in. the South.   We must see
 that we defeated the enemy's special war, and, as      result, -the enemy
 cad to introduce more troops -to wage the :limited war..
 in speaking of winning victory over the enemy in the special war
 we did not mean a total victory, but a decisive victory.   Today, in
 restraining and defeating the enemy in the limited war in the South, we
 also speak of achieving decisive success within a, relatively short
 period of time.   The contents of the guidelines anci strategy involving
 protracted fighting and the contents of achieving c.ecisive success
 within  . relatively short pericd of time  are not mutually contradictory.
 '[hey are the same.   In indoctrinating the cadres and party members
 ideologically, we must speak of protracted. fighting; and the determina-
 tion to fight and win, and must not disseminate to the lower echelons
 the idea of achieving dec=.sive success within a feti,- years.
 It is wrong to say that the Party leadership is not correct when
 the enemy sent part of his forces to the 4th zone or farther., while we
 estimated that there was little possibility of the enemy sending troops
 to the North.
 At present, in terms of restraining and defeating the enemy in the
 south, the Party's s-nrategic leadership remains correct.   Although the
 enemy has not yet acquired the conditions for sending his troops to the
 [Vo:rth, we have to take precautionary measures.    At  present, we must
 understand that fighting a protracted war and achieving decisive success
 within a relatively short period of time remain the same.   In a resis-
 tance war, it is right to speak of protracted war  and self-reliance, and
 the urge to fight and win quickly represents a rightist tendency.

 Today, is a great error not to speak of achieving decisive success in a
 relatively short period of time.   Therefore, we must achieve and are
 determined to achieve that objective.   If we fail to achieve that objec-
 tive, it is because of ourselves, not because of the socialist camp.  We
 may not speak of protracted fighting as unlimited fighting.   It is erron-
 eous to understand protracted as unl:i_mited.
 Contents of the significance of decisive victory:
 These contents are stated in the resolution.   To achieve the same
 solution as that in Laos, the contents of which we have already realized,
 the U.S. imperialists will agree immediately.
 We want to achieve decisive v:ict:ory which is:   to exterminate and
 disintegrate the puppet authorities and troops to the point that the
 puppet force is no longer the military and political leaning point for
 the Americans, that the U.S. troops must play the main role and resort
 to political measures.  When such a situation occurs the puppet troops
 will not be strong enough to protect their regime.
 But U.S. troops have been introduced.  Thus we must wipe out an
 important part of them in order to defeat them.
 There are three ways to achieve decisive victory:
 - Wipe out the majority of puppet troops and foil the enemy's
 political goals;
 - Wipe out an important part of U.S. troops and crush their aggres-
 sive will;
 - Achieve the goals:   national independence, democracy, peace,
 neutrality, and advance toward national unification.   On the basis of
 wiping out puppet troops, we can, to a certain extent, wipe out part of
 U.S. troops.   If the war is pursued for two or three years, we can do
 what the Koreans did:   overcoming 380,000 Americans.  The fact that
 southern guerrillas can wipe out the Americans--although not many Ameri-
 cans have been killed--is an optimistic event.
 Ba's ideas:   The introduction of U.S. troops into the South was not
 wanted by us.   But it is an opportunity for us to defeat them.   Some-
 times the enemy can understand this only after fighting with us for
 several years.    Thus, shortening this time is very important.
 Some individuals have asserted that since the Americans have intro-
 duced their troops we cannot defeat them and that the Americans have
 caused us heavy casualties.   These assertions are obviously belied by
 realities.

 To achieve decisive victor^y in a relatively snort period, we must
 concentrate our forces in both zones.   We must not speak only of an
 unlimited period.
 We will not do what A.]_ger_.a has done,   And we will not do what Korea
 did in using armed troops to liberate the South Ko:'eans.   We will do
 what the Soviet Union, did in. the war against Gernany.
 To achieve decisive victory, it is necessary to have very high
 determination.  We must endeavor to achieve it and be convinced that we
 are able to achieve it.   To do so, we must; face very great difficulties,
 even difficulties we cannot anticipate.
 The task of wiping out and. disintegrating a large number of puppet
 troops must go along with the task of foiling the enemy's reinforcement
 plan.   Therefore, this task must be accom-oanied by mass struggle and
 military proselyting.
 Our achievements in =_965 were very great.   They can be regarded as
 big leaps, as a great progress (defeating from 8 pt:ppet D in 1964 to
 46 I) is a great victory, causing the Americans to be frightened and to
 .rush in to rescue the puppets).
 It is necessary to prevent the enemy from increasing his troops,
 thus causing him to stop.   In. 165, he wanted to increase his troops,
 but could not.   In the future,  it is necessary to prevent him from
 supplementing his troops in time.   When the casualties of the puppets
 reach between D and regiments a:-id battle groups and those of the Arr~eri-
 cans between C and D, the war will be settled?   The enemy will be unable
 to stand firm in the rear, to pacify it.   These are the basic causes of
 his defeat.
 The greatest desire of the U.S. and other imlaerialists is to occupy
 the South, apply the neocolonialist policy, and check our Southern
 people's movement.
 We will defeat the enemy:   in several years, we will be able to
 wipe out and disintegrate 300,000 to 400,000 puppet troops and 200,000
 U.S. troops.   The Americans will be unable to introduce sufficient troops
 to fill the gaps left by the wiped out and disi.nteg:r.?ated U.S. and. puppet
 troops.
 On the other hand, in introducing more troops the Americans must
 develop their logistic service.   But, at the same time, we intensify our
 attacks against their logistic establishments. isolate their bases, cut
 off their transport roads.   In the future, In certain areas puppet troops
 will have to eat soup for months.   U.S. troops will also encounter diffi-
 culties.   Thus, in the future, the attacks against logistic bases will
 be intensified by 10 times.   This is a very important strategic mission.

 The problems of general offensive and general uprising and fighting and
 negotiations.
 General offensive and general uprising:   uprisings have been car-
 ried out.   Now with the arrival of the Americans, what are the problems
 of the general offensive and general uprising?
 In the past, we did not have any doubt about this capacity in the
 puppet-controlled areas.   Now the areas where this capacity still exists
 are still large.   The U.S. troops occupy only 15 important districts.
 Puppet troops occupy over 250 districts.   We realize that since we have
 the capacity to defeat puppet troops, we have the capacity to carry
 out general uprisings and liberate these areas.  We do have the capacity
 to liberate the district capitals and a number of provinces.
 In the old-type colonial war, the enemy would not consent to being
 defeating and withdrawing until his vitality had been annihilated to a
 certain degree.   In the new-type colonial war, when the greater bulk of
 the puppet army and an important part of the American troops will have
 been annihilated and disintegrated, the enemy has to agree to withdraw
 under definite conditions.   For example, with regard to areas where
 American troops are stationed we use military and political means to
 attack them; in areas where they are still strong, we encirble them.
 When negotiations are held, the American troops may agree to withdraw
 from these areas, under definite conditions.   We then proceed to solving
 the problems of the remaining areas.   With regard to the centers such
 as Saigon and Cholon we must combine the old experiences with creative
 ideas to carry out the task.
 Fighting and Negotiating:
 The resolution of the Party's 11th conference clearly stated that
 in the process of achieving success, a situation where fighting and
 negotiations are conducted simultaneously may arise.   At present, the
 situation is not yet ripe for negotiations.   Fighting while negotiating
 is aimed at opening another front with a view to making the puppet army
 more disintegrated, stimulating and developing the enemy's internal
 contradictions, and, thereby, making him more isolated in order to
 deprive him of the propaganda weapons, isolate him further, and make a
 number of people who understand the Americans clearly see their nature.

 In a war between a powerful. country which wages aggression and a
 weak country, as long as we have not yet acquired adequate strength a
 situation where fighting and negotiations are conducted simultaneously
 does not exist.   Fighting continues until the emergence of a situation
 where both sides are fighting indecisively.   Then., a situation where
 fighting and negotiations are conducted simultaneously may emerge.   in
 fighting while negotiating, the side which fights more strongly will
 compell the adversary to accept his conditions.   Considering the compara-
 tive balance of forces, the war proceeds through the following stages:
 --The fighting stage.
 --The stage of fighting while negotiating.
 --Negotiations and signing of agreements.
 Whether or not the war will. resume after the conclusion of agree-
 ments depends upon the comoarative balance of force:;.   If we are capable
 of dominating the adversary, the war will not break out again., and conversely.
 Therefore, fighting while negotiating also represents a principled step
 in the evolution of the war.   Thus, a situation where fighting and
 negotiations are conducted simultaneously will unmistakably emerge.   In
 cur anti-French resistance, there were also times when fighting and
 negotiations were conducted simultaneously.   The same situation had emerged
 in China.
 At present, there are three viewpoints with regard to war and peace.
 --The Americans find it necessary to negotiate, but negotiate from
 a strong position, partly because they have deceitful motives, and partly
 because the situation has compelled them to negotiate.   Yet, they want
 us to make concessions to ,hem.
 --A number of countries want us to enter into negotiations, any form
 of negotiations--so that a big war does not break out and that the war
 can be ended--regardless or the interests or' Vietnam.   Some ether countries
 wonder whether we can defeat the Amer-weans., and if not, we should enter
 into negotiations.   (Most of these countries are nationalist countries
 in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.)  A number of East European socialist
 countries hold the view that conditions do -prevail., and are ripe for
 achieving success   (The Americans would withdraw their troops, and we will
 continue the struggle to achieve total success.)  These socialist countries
 also posed a number of conditions:   cessation of they bombing of the North;
 gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South.

 --China holds the view that conditions for negotiations are not yet
 ripe, not until a few years from now, and, even worse, seven years from
 now. In the meantime, we should continue fighting to bog down the enemy,
 and should wait until a number of socialist countries acquire adequate
 conditions for strengthening their main force troops to launch a strong,
 all-out, and rapid offensive, using all types of weapons and heeding no
 borders.  What we should do in the South today is to try restrain the
 enemy and make him bogged down, waiting until China has built strong forces
 to launch an all-out offensive.
 --Our policy: to continue fighting until a certain time when we can
 fight and negotiate at the same time,
 This is also a fighting method:   repulsing the enemy step by step,
 and achieving decisive success.
 The Party Central Committee entrusts the Politburo with the task of
 deciding on the time for negotiations.
 The problem of choosing the opportunity and deciding to negotiate:
 -Basing ourselves upon the actual situation in the South.
 --Considering the opinions of the friendly countries which have
 provided us with quite a large volume of assistance, in order to gain
 their maximum support.
 The future situation may lead to negotiations.   Yet, even if there
 are negotiations, they are conducted simultaneously with fighting.  While
 negotiating, we will continue fighting the enemy more vigorously.   (It
 is possible that the North conducts negotiations while the South continues
 fighting, and that the South also participates in the negotiations while
 continuing to fight).   Those who are in charge of conducting negotiations
 negotiate and those in charge of fighting continue fighting, because
 the decisive factor lies in the battlefield.   The enemy wants us to stop
 fighting to his advantage.   But we have to fight.   Therefore, the enemy
 also fights.  We must fight to win great victories with which to compell
 the enemy to accept our conditions.   If we stop fighting (at that stage),
 no considerable success can be achieved in negotiations.   If we conduct
 negotiations while fighting vigorously, we can also take advantage of the
 opportunity to step up the political struggle, military proselyting, and
 activities in the cities.   Thus, we will take advantage of the opportunity
 offered by the negotiations to step up further our military attacks,
 political struggle, and military proselyting.,  At present, the Americans
 have put forth deceitful arguments.   Therefore, we must put forth conditions
 to prove that we fight for the aspirations and interests of the people, and,
 thereby, to win the support of various countries,

 .If the enemy wants to negotiate, he must accept a number of conditions,
 such as, to permanently cease their war of destruction against the North,
 withdraw his troops from the South, and dismantle his military bases.  The
 failure to pose the above conditions is tantamount to implicitly accepting
 the Americans' presence in the South.
 Depending on the situation prevailing at the time, we will impose
 conditions.   For exam-ole, the puppet forces must be concentrated in barracks,
 must not repress the people, must not carry out espionage activities, must
 allow the people to move about freely or choose their places of residence,
 must not herd the people into strategic hamlets and concentration centers;
 the American troops must be stationed at the wharf's.
 The basic situation prevailing in the South for the past years requires
 that we attack the enemy more vigorously.  This front involves millions of
 people.   While attacking, we must concentrate all our forces on fighting
 the enemy.
 11. Some additional opinions:
 Generally speaking, this is a difficult task, which must be con_,
 tinned.   However, guerrilla warfare must be stepped up and developed further.
 In the recent past, the building of the regional forces, main force units,
 and guerrillas, on the whole, has continued to develop.   Yet, considering
 the proportion, the building of these forces has been slow.
 Previously, the guerrillas comprised 10 percent of the population.
 In the western highlands, the highest proportion is only 3.5 percent,
 and, in some areas, the proportion is 1 percent.
 Formerly, the French imperialists tried to find out why we had
 numerous mobile units while we had only '(5 F's), whereas they had only
 a small number of mobile units ( only ten to 15 percent) although they
 had large forces.   The greater part (60 to 70 percents of enemy forces
 have been dispersed to cope with the guerrillas, and 20 percent have to
 cope with the regional troops.   Thus, only 10 percent of enemy forces are
 available to cope with our main force units,.
 As the Americans have increased the number of their troops, we must
 develop our guerrilla and regional forces to restrain and fight the enemy
 everywhere.   We must thin out 60 to 70 percent of the enemy regular
 forces in order to enable our main force units to carry out their task of
 annihilating the enemy on the main battlefields.
 We must firmly maintain and broaden our control over areas which
 have been liberated and which will be liberated.   We have to do so because
 of the following reasons.

 --In China, it was said that the annihilation of enemy vitality
 resulted in the liberation of the land.
 --In our country, we must speak of annihilating enemy vitality and
 firmly maintaining our control over the liberated areas and enlarging
 the liberated areas.
 If we speak solely of annihilating enemy vitality, and not of control
 over the liberated areas, sometimes a situation may emerge where the enemy
 has been annihilated but the areas under our control cannot be enlarged.
 In such a case, if the enemy is still strong he may still be capable of
 re-occupying these liberated areas.   'Therefore, after liberating an area,
 we must immediately organize its defense, and must enlarge it.
 How should we best develop and deploy our forces to maintain our
 control?  What has enabled certain areas to maintain their control?
 Experiences must be drawn.
 By developing guerrilla warfare and pinning the enemy down, we will
 create conditions for our main force units to annihilate him.
 The experience drawn is that it must be insured that the Party
 chapters and branches thoroughly understand the necessity of leading the
 guerrillas, and developing guerrilla warfare.   The Party branch committee
 must build up the guerrilla force.
 At present, there is a contradiction between the build up of the guerrilla
 forces, the regional troops and the main force units.   The building of the
 guerrilla force to supplement the main forces has not been satisfactory.
 There was a situation when the enemy would have been defeated if he could
 not supplement his forces    Yet, he could replace and supplement his forces.
 Although we have achieved successes and have the just cause, we have
 encountered difficulties in recruiting youths to supplement our forces.   It
 is necessary to carefully consider why we cannot recruit youths to replenish
 our forces.
 2.   The enemy's use of aircraft and artillery, and spraying of poisonous
 chemicals.
 How have the people endured and coped with the enemy's air attacks,
 shelling, and spraying of poisonous chemicals?  What experiences have been
 acquired?
 In addition to the ideological measures, it is necessary to:
 --Dig trenches.
 ---Insure that dwellings are widely spread out.

 --Narrow the enemy-controlled areas, herd him into the cities, and
 not allow him to concentrate his forces to attack areas under our control.
 The TW is very concerned about the enemy's spraying of poisonous
 chemicals. It is necessary to collect the chemicals sprayed so that we
 can. ask friendly countries to analyse them, and, thereby to find appropriate
 preventive measures.   Party members in areas which are not subjected to
 the spraying of poisonous chemicals, or which are lightly sprayed, are urged
 to step up their production, and. to cultivate many kinds of plants and
 many crops.
 3.   The cities:
 We should introduce our forces into- the cities in order to strengthen
 our forces there.  We must conduct investigations of the urban situation.
 Everyone must carry out propaganda activities and enlighten the masses to
 a certain extent.  We must take advantage of the enemy's internal contra-
 dictions to lead the masses' struggle, and make the masses understand the
 political significance of the struggle for the improvement of their living
 conditions and for democracy.
 III.,   Situation of the defense of the North and. reinforcement of the
 South.
 The enemy advocated attacking us vigorously at the beginning of the
 year (February 1965)   so that he could put forth his peace negotiations
 policy and compell us to negotiate.   The enemy was firmly confident he
 could compell us to sit down at the conference table and the socialist
 camp would force us to negotiate.   Taylor proposed, that the Americans
 attack us continuously, so as to exert, pressure on.L.s..   But the reality has
 emerged contrary to the enemy's expectations, and has made him more passive.
 At first, due to lack of experience, we encountered difficulties
 and confusion.   The greatest difficulty arose from. the blockade of roads.
 After some months, we acquired experiences, and have, strengthened our
 national defense forces.
 At present, the air defense force in the North is a rather strong force
 in Asia.   The density of the anti-aircraft net with conventional weapons
 is even higher than that of countries in our camp.   The enemy himself said.
 that  "we danced on the muzzles of their anti-aircraft guns" when he ran  :into
 a dense fire net formed by conventional weapons.    Our missile force also
 constitutes the strongest anti-aircraft  -force,  as compared with Asian
 countries, including China.
 We have MIG 17's and MIG 21's.  MIG 21's have a speed comparable to
 that of the various types of modern aircraft used by the Americans to attack
 us.   Yet, the above two forces are still insufficient.   It is necessary
 to have a greater force, with better long range weapons, at least medium-
 range rockets.   (We are trying to get these.)

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060001-2
 At present, the enemy conducts his heaviest raids against the 4th
 military zone.   In other areas, he only attacks us suddenly and then flees.
 Captured enemy pilots states:   "If we want to attack a wide area, we must
 have eight aircraft carriers, and many more air tankers and airfields.
 With five more aircraft carriers we can fly only 500 sorties at the most.
 If we want to attack Hanoi, we must have even more aircraft and must attack
 it in many phases."
 Recently, our anti-aircraft force has achieved good results.   The
 conventional weapons have contributed to fighting enemy aircraft flying at
 the lowest altitude.   The missiles have an effective range from 800 meters
 to 35 or 50 kilometers.  Recently we have downed many enemy aircraft with
 mobile missiles.   (We have shot down a large number of enemy aircraft, but
 reported a small number).  Though newly formed, this armed serivce has
 scored fairly good achievements.  At the beginning, it took one to eight,
 or one to five missiles to shoot down one enemy aircraft.   Now it takes
 one to two missiles to shoot down one enemy aircraft.   The kill rate set
 by the Soviet Union was 100 percent.  Due to the rapid training they
 had received, our missile units have failed to react in time in complex
 cases.
 A missile has a bigger diameter than two arms' length, and is twenty
 meters long.   It is radar-guided when launched,   It pursues and catches
 up with the target because its speed is faster than that of the target.
 When firing missiles, members of missile units acclaim:   "Dragons are
 pursuing aircraft."  Although the speed of the MIG l7's equals 60 percent
 of that of enemy aircraft, they have scored great achievements, and, in
 some cases, downed two enemy F-105's.   The enemy did not think that we
 dared use MIG 17's to fight him.   Technically speaking, if our equipment
 is poor we cannot identify the enemy.   Enemy aircraft always dodge our
 MIG 21's.   Yet, the MIG 21's have not yet been widely used.
 The enemy is afraid of us because we are both heroic and bold.  We
 can counter enemy aircraft at any altitude.   Cuba, the Soviet Union, China,
 and Korea, have voiced their readiness to help us, but we see that we
 are still able to fight alone.
 There are some conclusions I want to present so that we can rejoice:
 --The enemy has been unable to destroy our agricultural economy.
 Despite the fact that the youths have gone to the battlefields, the women
 and aged people have insured production and attained the planned norm of
 five tons per hectare.   The youths have gone to the battlefield, the women
 have assumed the three responsibilities, engaged in all fields of activity
 in the rural areas, and simultaneously engaged in production and combat.

 A team of women from a fruit factory, commanded by women cadres and equipped
 with machineguns, heavy machineguns, and 20mm and l2mm guns, put up a
 demonstration for women from foreign countries.   The latter said that
 "l.f we were Americans we would have left Vietnam long ago."  Another
 example:  when she saw enemy aircraft appear, Miss Hang, a female
 guerrilla, rushed into the combat trench.   But there was a snake in the
 trench.   She wondered if she shculd fight the snake or shoot at enemy
 aircraft.  She jumped into the trench and shot enemy aircraft.   Only
 after shooting down an enemy aircraft did she return to kill ,he
 snake.   The comrade Party Secretary concluded that Miss Hang had held
 firm to the Party's viewpoint. to direct the spearhead at the main
 enemy.
 --Now we can conclude that no matter what the enemy does, he
 cannot destroy us.   During the past year, our brother countries gave
 us a quantity of equipment larger than that provided during the previous
 five years.
 Despite the present intensity of the war, the cost of living in
 the North has not risen.   The masses' daily life remains normal.  Our
 lines of communication are uninterrupted.  At the beginning, we learned
 from the Korean Engineer Corps, but now the progress, we have made far
 exceeds that of the Korean Engineer Corps.   Owing to our strong defense
 system, the enemy has encountered difficulties in bombing our installations.
 Although the Ham Rong bridge has been riddled with bullets, it is still
 standing, and the people living in the surrounding area have not :moved
 away.
 Transportation is possible.  Despite the fact that we are in
 a war situation, our transportation capabilities have doubled, and
 we are using all means available.   Yet, we still fail to meet the
 requirements of the 4th zone and of the South.  The transportation
 operations on the roads are almost non-existent in. daylight.   But at
 night, there are all kinds of transportation means, such as floating
 bridges, rafts, cable chains, rails installed on rafts for trains to
 cross over rivers, and so forth.
 Although the Americans can destroy our industry to a certain
 extent, they cannot destroy our national defense industry, because we do
 not yet have a major one.   The socialist ccuntries' aid has been increased.
 We can thus conclude that even if the Americans intensify their
 air raids, we will still stand firm to protect the Torth and reinforce
 the South.

 Reinforcements to the South:
 The Northern citizens have clearly realized their responsibility
 with regard to this matter.   Therefore, they have provided. reinforcements
 to the best of their ab.Llity.
 1V.   International support
 On the one hand, we find that international support is fairly
 good, and, on the other hand, we are worr.ie-d.   The reason for this is
 that we are fighting the enemy at a time when there is a lack of unity
 within the socialist camp.   This is a reality.  Disunity still exists.
 We cannot just sit by and wait until the socialist camp is united to
 achieve decisive victory.   On the -ontrary, we must achieve decisive
 victory within the next four years.   Therefore, it is necessary to
 try to win maximum support.   We say that our Party's leadership is
 correct and our people are heroic.   Yet, without international support,
 our success would be limited although we still can achieve it.   Generally
 speaking, the countries in the socialist camp unanimously agree with
 our line, and wholeheartedly assist us.
 Since the downfall of Khruschev, the Soviet Union has provided
 us with much assistance in all, fields.   Three fourths of the weapons
 sent to the South have been received from the socialist camp.   Half of
 the South's budget has been provided by our camp, mainly China.   The
 quantity of weapons provided has been so large that we could not
 transport all of them.   During the past year, the quantity of equipment
 provided for the building of the North equalled that received during
 the five previous years.   We have sent back those materials for which
 we did not yet have requirements, so that we do not lose them or have
 to maintain them,.   The socialist camp has agreed to construct mobile
 missile launching pads, and to establish factories to construct mobile
 missile launching pads for us
 Nevertheless, we are riot satisfied in certain respects.   If there
 were no disunity within the socialist camp, our success would have been
 greater.   Yet, we also rind that if we did not obtain the great assistance
 from our camp, we would not have been able to achieve such great successes.
 Our party has highly evaluated the support of the socialist camp.   If
 we do not try to gain the support of the socialist camp, we will be guilty
 of our duty to our people   We cannot accept the line of this country
 or that country in order to obtain aid, nor can we accept aid from one
 country without accepting aid from another, because otherwise we will
 be guilty before the entire camp, and before our people.

 V. Realtions within the Socialist Camp
 China said:  We must unite and insure the purity of Marxism-Leninism.
 Yet, only a number of countries have sided with China.   The same situation
 also exists with regard to the Soviet Union.  As for us, all countries
 in the camp, except Yugoslavia, are siding with us.  Recently, our party
 did its best to contribute to the unity within the socialist camp.
 At a time when there  is a -polemic among various countries, we
 must have an independent line.   We must be confident in no one but our
 own Party.  We advocate opposing revisionism, and, at the same- time, must
 take precautionary measures against dogmatism, and must constantly pre-
 serve international solidarity.
 China said:   To positively oppose imperialism without positively
 opposing revisionism will finally lead to compromise with imperialism.
 That is not true.   If one is revisionist., he does not oppose imperialism,
 and advocates peaceful coexistence with imperialism.
 We do not hold the view that the Soviet leadership is as revisionist
 as the leadership under Khrushchev, and that it is somewhat more dangerous
 than Khrushschev.
 We hold that the Soviet leadership still contains some rEvisionists,
 some indecisive elements, and al3o active elements.
 We do not think so.   We think that Khrushchev fell because of internal
 causes, and, of course, the external struggle also was a very important
 contribution to his downfall.
 According to China, things do not have two or three characteristics.
 This is true.   Yet, in a transitionary period when we are not yet
 positive about everything, we cannot attribute to environmental things
 this characteristic or another.   Instead., we must continue to follow them
 up before we can draw a correct conclusion.

 bet not unexpected; Ulbricht is a frightened man. m
 He is frightened less of the kind of uprising thatt

 East Germany even within the Soviet bloc. -He pan-,,
 ieked at the prompt, positive response of other!*
 Communist regimes to the initiatives launched by then
 Kiesinger-Brandt coalition.
 Panic accounts for his abrupt trip to Moscow, for l
 the feverish conclusion or renewal of bilateral treaties ;
 with Poland and Czechoslovakia, and for East Ger-
 many's blasts at Rumania after that regime had'
 accepted diplomatic relations with Bonn.
 Herr Ulbricht has slowed Bonn's diplomatic of-

 from the Kremlin. Even the Poles and Czechs may one
 day find compelling'the advantages of closer.relations

 As Herr Ulbricht may recall, the. authentic revolt
 of German workers erupted not in the Federal Repub-

 fourteen years ago on June 17-and was crushed by
 Soviet tanks while the Communist leaders hid for

 Collaboration with Developing Countries.
 The GDR's scientific and industrial
 relations with a great number of
 developing  countries,  which  have
 shown  a  very     favourable trend
 particularly during 1965-86, form a
 substantial part of  the  country's
 economic exchanges.      They are a
 decisive means of promoting and
 deepening  the  collaboration  with
 these countries which in the new
 stage  of their development   have.
 taken steps to strengthen and safe-
 guard their national Independence.
 Arrangements to send specialists
 (outside commercial contracts) have
 helped these countries a great deal
 in building up and strengthening
 their own economies.
 Training of Technical Personnel
 When sending specialists and train-
 ing local staff the Interests of the
 country concerned are taken into
 consideration  and  due  regard  is
 being  paid  to  the  principle  of
 equality and mutual respect of sov-
 ereignty.
 Thus, in 1965, advisers and spe-
 cialists were sent to 19 develop-
 ing countries and the number of
 trainees which came to the GDR
 from 48 countries to acquire tech-
 nical knowledge, had nearly doubled
 .as against 1964.

 RUSSIAN BAPTISTS QUOTE LENIN IN PLEA FOR RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE
 By Arthur Channing
 Back in 1903, when he was seeking popular support: for his revolutionary
 cause, V. I. Lenin made an eloquent defense of religious freedom in Russia.
 After his Bolsheviks gained power in 1917 and established the world's first
 Communist regime, however, he discarded. his seemingly liberal views and helped
 to launch the campaign against all religions that his successors are still waging
 today.
 The-Russian Church of Evangelical Christians-Baptists recently
 reminded the present Soviet leadership of Lenin's previous stand in an appeal
 for religious freedom addressed to the USSR's highest party and governmental
 authorities.
 This quotation from a 1903 Lenin statement was included in the, Baptists'
 "Each person must have complete freedom not only to observe any faith
 but also (to) propagate any faith.... None of the officials should even have a
 right to ask anyone of his faith:  this is a matter of conscience and nobody
 should dare to interfere in this field?"
 The Baptists cited. a number of other instances in which Communists
 have taken public positions that are now being contradicted by the party's day-
 to-day persecution of religious believers throughout the USSR.
 Their letter, written in April, 1965 but unknown. outside of the Soviet
 Union until a copy reached contacts in Western Europe in July, 1966 -- pointed

 out that the original Soviet constitution of 1918 professed to recognize the
 right of each citizen to immunity from both "religious and anti-religious
 propaganda."  Later, however, the constitution was changed to fit the present
 policy of denying believers the right to propagate their faith but giving the
 party's atheist agitators a free hand in conducting anti-religious propaganda.
 The Baptist appeal also charged that Soviet authorities had violated
 provisions of the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (ratified
 by the USSR Supreme Soviet in 1962) dealing with freedom of conscience, con-
 victions and religious beliefs.  Specific reference was made to Article 5 of
 the Declaration which states that parents "must have the possibility of
 securing for thcir children a religious and moral upbringing in conformity
 with their own convictions."
 Since 1929, the letter said, the revised Soviet constitution has
 permitted the wholesale persecution of believers, thousands of whom perished
 in prisons and labor camps.
 "Can one say that all these nightmares are of.things of the past?"
 the Baptist appeal asked.  "No!  The crime has not yet ended.  It still con-
 tinues.                             And here is a vivid example of this:  At the very time you are reading
 this letter, hundreds of believers are being deprived of liberty illegally.
 They are languishing in prisons, labor camps and in exile.  Some of them died
 in agony as martyrs.  The children are being taken away from their parents.
 Thousands of Evangelical Christian-Baptist communities are deprived of all
 rights.   Their meetings are being held in private homes which sometimes can
 accommodate only 25 to 30 percent of a Baptist community, and even under these

 trying conditions the believers cannot get together without harassment.  Quite
 often their meetings are dispersed by police and volunteer militia? and their
 homes confiscated.  All this testifies to the fact that the crime has not yet
 ended."
 The letter included a plea for restoration of the original wording
 of the constitution and for the honoring of its provisions concerning religion.
 It was addressed to L. I. Brezhnev, Chairman of the Constitutional Committee
 of the Supreme Soviet (parliament); legislative committees of the Supreme
 Soviet; the USSR Council of Ministers; and the Presidium of the USSR,Supreme
 "As:rulers," the Baptist spokesmen said in conclusion, "you carry
 the responsibility before God, not for the violation of church canons, but
 for the violation of natural laws of truth, liberty, equality and fraternity."
 Although there has been no indication of an official Soviet reply
 to the Baptists' plea for religious tolerance, press reports from Moscow in
 late August revealed that six of the church's leaders had been sentenced to
 prison for taking part in a baptismal ceremony for 40 young men and women.
 The Baptists, according to these reports, also were charged with giving
 religious instruction and secretly printing religious tracts.
 In an earlier incident, two young parish priests of the Russian
 Orthodox Church, Fathers Nicholas Eshliman and Gleb Yakunin, were suspended
 from performing their religious duties after writing similar letters of protest
 to Soviet and church officials.  The priests charged, in December 1965,? that
 Soviet officials had undermined the church's own leadership and, in effect,

 held the power of veto over all religious activities. .They pointed out that
 no priest can be ordained without approval of the regime's Council on Affairs
 of the Church.          More than ten thousand churches and dozens of monasteries,

 Ifuroyadou on &ptist Schism and Lr,s on Religion
 interview at Readers' Request: SOME QUF;STiONS ON REI.1-
 r,1ON AND THE CIIURCII. (izvestia, Aug. a0, p. 4. Complete
 text:) From time to time izvestia publishes articles concern-
 Ing religion, the church, and atheist work. They usually evoke
 many letters from readers.
 The editors, feeling that the thoughts expressed in the let-
 ters are of interest of the public, asked Vladimir Alekseyevich
 Kuroyedov, Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers'
 Council for Religious Affairs, to answer some of the questions
 raised by reactors.
 question.-Are there many believers in our country? What
 status do Soviet laws grant to religious organizations and what
 procedure do they provide for these organizations' activities?
 Answer.-It is impossible to answer the question of how
 many believers there are, since our country conducts no state
 census of citiz.;,,is in regard to their attitude toward religion.
 No official documents contain indications of whether a person
 professes a religion or is a nonbeliever. It Is very important
 to emphasize this circumstance, for it is one of the conditions
 for ensuring freedom of conscience in the U.S.S.R. Under the
 Soviet Constitution, the church in our country is separated from
 the state, and the schools from the church, in order to ensure
 freedom of conscience. In conformity with this, state agencies
 do not interfere In the internal devotional activities of religious
 organizations. Religious organizations. In turn, do not inter-
 fere in any state affairs.
 The soviet state, taking into account the fact that a part of
 the population consists of believers, permits church associa
 lions to function freely in order to satisfy the religious needs
 of the believers, These associations are granted the use of
 church buildings without charge and are granted the possibility
 (if training clergymen, publishing religious literature, manu-
 facturing articles of worship, etc.
 Our laws strictly protect the rights of believers, An Insult
 to the feelings of helievers or any kind of discrimination
 ;c ainst them is prosecuted according to law.
 ft is precisely in these conditions, which have been created
 in our country, that it is possible genuinely to ensure every
 citizen the freedom to believe or not believe in God, the free-
 clon- to perform religious rites or to spread antircligious prop-
 aganda.
 Everything stated above is a commonly known truth. Foreign
 church delegations visiting the Soviet Union acknowledge that
 the church in our country exists freely and independently.
 Yet from time to time some Western publications print
 islander and various insinuations about the status of religion in
 the U.S.S.R. For example, the newspaper Lo Parisien Libere,
 in its issue of April 4, 1966, presented as a sensation a report
 of new Russian Itcpublic legislation concerning the church and,
 in so doing, offered the peremptory conclusion that 'a new of-
 fensive against Christian worship" was being organized in our
 country.
 Let us see how matters actually stand.
 At the beginning of this year the Presidium of the Russian
 Republic Supreme Soviet adapted two decrees and a resolution
 concerning legislation on religious cults. Similar resolutions
 :out decrees were adopted by the Presidiums of the Supreme
 Soviets of other Union republics. Any unbiased person, after
 reacting these documents (published in Vcdomosti Verkhovnovo
 Soviea RSF'SII, No. 12, March 24, 1966),  will recognize that
 there can be no talk of an 'offensive" against the church and
 against believers' rights or of any infringement of these rights.
 These decrees and resolutions were adopted to clarify the
 prevailing legislation on cults; they concern chiefly the ques-
 tion of combating violations of the law on the separation of
 church and state and of schools and church, and they clarif it
 along the followtppm'Ye Po v, Releases20    /
 set forth specifically which violations of the above law entail
 criminal liability. The Itussian Republic Criminal Code (Art.
 142) had not previously defined these specific violations. It
 should be particularly emphasized that the sphere of criminal
 punishment has been considerably narrowed. And for various
 types of violations an administrative penalty has been intro-
 duced in place of criminal responsibility.
 Essentially, it is a matter of reducing the punishment of per-
 sons who are first offenders against the law on separation of
 church and state. However, increased responsibility is estab-
 lished for citizens who had previously been convicted of such
 violations and also for those who have undertaken organized
 activities aimed at the committing of such violations.
 From all this it is apparent that the new judicial acts do not
 at all infringe upon the rights of believers, all the more so
 since the resolution of the Presidium of the Russian Republic
 Supreme Soviet states that discrimination against believers is
 punished according to criminal procedure. In particular, this
 concerns such instances as 'refusal to hire citizens or to admit
 then. to educational institutions, dismissal from work or expul-
 sion from educational institutions, and the deprivation of citi-
 zens' privileges and benefits that have been established by law,
 as well as other substantial limitations of the rights of citizens
 because of their attitude toward religion."
 It is not fortuitous that believers and also the clergy correctly
 understood these new normative acts of the Union republics and
 approved them.
 To the credit of certain foreign church publications, it should
 be said that they gave an objective Interpretation of the new So-
 viet acts on religion and the church. Such an influential church
 publication as the Bulletin of the World Council of Churches do-
 clared in No. 17, May 26:
 'At the beginning of April various news services carried re-
 ports from Moscow that a decree of the Supreme Soviet in Rus-
 sia (the Russian Republic) introduced restrictions on freedom of
 religion. A study of the text, actually containing three decrees,
 showed that these decrees on the whole confirm, clarify and In
 some cases introduce greater flexibility into existing laws.
 Contrary to what was printed in the newspapers, none of these
 decrees forbids freedom to collect JrontributionsJ for the needs
 of the church or sanctions discrimination against persons be-
 cause of their religion,
 'To illustrate the alleviation of previous conditions, it may
 he noted that some law violations previously punished by im-
 prisonment now only entail a fine of up to 50 rubles."
 The bulletin goes on to give, on similar aspects. a concrete
 analysis of each of the new normative acts of the Presidium of
 the Russian Republic Supreme Soviet concerning religious cults.
 Thus, no matter how much Le Parisien Libere wanted to
 slander the Soviet government's policy toward religion, it failed.
 The new legislative acts in the sphere of religion and the church
 are in no way a persecution of religion or a violation of the     i
 principle of freedom of conscience in the U.S.S.It.
 Of course, freedom of conscience in our country does not
 mean, as some clergymen would like, that the activities of
 religious orl;anizalions should be completely unrestricted and
 that they may do whatever they wish, without regard for the
 laws and customs of our country.
 Every state has special laws on religion and the church, es-
 tablishing a definite framework for the activity of religious
 associations. It is natural that we too have laws on religion and
 the church. The basic one is the Soviet government decree 'On
 Separation of Church From State and of Schools From the Church," '?
 issued Jan. 23, 1918, and signed by V. I. Lenin.
 The chief requirement which the law sets for religious organi-
 zations is that hey( corfi   h i  c iXit  "WA g  nc

 and without infringing upon the person or rights of citizens.
 The law forbids the use of meetings of believers for addresses
