 SITUATION REPORT
 CHINA-VIETNAM-USSR

 yesterday that China would "wholeheartedly welcome" a UN
 proposal under consideration calling for a Chinese with-
 drawal from Vietnam as well as a pullout of Vietnamese

 troops from Kampuchea.   Both Vietnam and the Soviet
 Union have opposed the linkage of the two questions,  and
 an implied Soviet veto of such a UN Security Council reso-
 lution has stalled discussions there.                   Deng reiterated
 Beijing's position on the limited nature of the Chinese
 action,  estimating that the fighting might end "in about
 10 days,  or perhaps a few days more."   He also implied
 strongly that a Chinese withdrawal was in no way depen-
 dent upon the Kampuchean situation.
 A Chinese Embassy official in Moscow reported Sun-
 day that, despite Soviet anger at the Chinese invasion,
 some "normal" diplomatic interaction was still taking
 place.   Most importantly,  the Sino-Soviet border river
 navigation talks began on schedule in Blagoveschensk on
 20 February, four days after the outbreak of fi htin .
 The talks were expected to last about a week-.
 In an editorial in Peoples Daily yesterday, China
 reiterated its earlier call for negotiations with Viet-
 nam over their border dispute.   The editorial repeated
 China's earlier assurance that it does not want "one
 inch" of Vietnamese territory and will pull back Chinese
 forces when Vietnam has been punished "as far as is
 necessary."   In an evident move to increase pressure on
 the Vietnamese, however,  the editorial insisted that the
 "border conflict between China and Vietnam can only be
 settled through negotiations between the two sides.
 There is no other way out."   It is still not clear what
 the Chinese envisage would be the substances of the
 negotiations they pro ose or how they expect the nego-
 25X1         tiations to begin.
 Soviet Response
 In an election speech yesterday in Minsk,  Soviet
 Foreign Minister Gromyko condemned Chinese "aggression"
 against Vietnam and repeated for apparent emphasis that
 portion of his prepared text that warned Beijing "to
 stop before it is too late."   Gromyko, however, did not
 specify an  Soviet action if China did not stop its
 25X1    activity.
 Gromyko,  in contrast to some of his Politburo col-
 leagues, did not refer to US "connivance" with China.
 Rather, he took the more restrained position that the

 Chinese are seeking "to set the Soviet Union and the
 United States at loggerheads."   Gromyko's remarks sug-
 gest a desire to limit as much as possible the damage
 that the Vietnam situation might do to Soviet-US rela-
 tions.   He said that the Soviets seek "more stable re-
 lations" with the US and that the SALT negotiations "can
 be successfully brought to an end shortl " if the US does
 not "put up obstacles."                                               25X1
 The Pravda account of Defense Minister Ustinov's
 election speech last Friday edited out his remarks to
 the effect that the Soviet Government statement of 18
 February "was a major political document" containing a
 "serious warning" to the Chinese,  although Soviet media
 have given unusual play to a Yugoslav press report that   25X1
 said "no one in Moscow doubts that the USSR may at an
 moment provide Vietnam with military aid."
 The Vietnamese announced yesterday that I. A.  Roga-
 chev,  Chief of the Southeast Department of the Soviet
 Foreign Ministry, has been in Hanoi since 23 February
 and had met with a Vietnamese Vice Minister of Foreign
 Affairs to discuss "problems of common concern."   Roga-
 chev is new on this job

 NORTH YEMEN - SOUTH YEMEN:   Border Situation

 National Democratic Front--the South Yemeni supported
 coalition of northern dissidents that appears to be doing
 much of the fighting--had taken Harib.   We cannot confirm

 The military situation is unclear.   Reports from

 USSR-NORWAY:   Defense Ministry Talks
 Norwegian Deputy Secretary of Defense Hoist has told
 the US Embassy in Oslo that Soviet officials used his re-
 cent visit to Moscow to complain again--in a restrained
 manner--about Norway's role in NATO and to stress the
 virtue of neutralism for Norway.   Hoist strongly defended
 his country's security policy.   Soviet-Norwegian relations
 have been settling down following over a year of strain,
 and both parties used the visit to improve the atmosphere.
 25X1
 Defense Minister Ustinov--unexpectedly added to the
 list of Soviet officials to meet with the Norwegian offi-
 cial--told Hoist that the Norwegians "could learn some-
 thing from the Finns, who know how to deal with the Rus-
 sians," and encouraged Norway to take a positive attitude
 toward Finnish President Kekkonen's proposal for a Nordic
 Nuclear Weapons Free Zone.   The Soviets also reiterated
 their longstanding list of specific complaints against
 Norway's security measures,  added a few new ones, and res-
 urrected dormant objections to Norway's close association
 with the US--all in what Hoist describes as a cordial man-
 25X1          ner.
 As the first political representative of the Norwe-
 gian Ministry of Defense to visit the USSR since 1967,
 Hoist said he defended Norway's heightened NATO activity
 as a needed adjustment to the Soviet buildup on the Kola
 Peninsula.   He reassured the Soviets that Norway's self-
 imposed prohibitions on foreign bases and nuclear weapons
 have not been changed by new arrangements for prestockage
 of NATO equipment and brushed aside Soviet comparisons of
 the stable Soviet defense budget with NATO defense budget
 25X1     increases.
 Although Norway wants to be seen as a good NATO mem-
 ber,                it also is aware of the need to have fairly smooth
 relations with the USSR.   Norway's efforts to develop
 fishing and other economic interests in the northern con-
 tinental waters will continue to require extensive nego-
 25X1          tiation with the Soviets.

 UK:   Defense Budget
 //Britain's annual White Paper on defense, issued
 last Friday, confirms a real increase of 3 percent in
 the defense budget for the coming fiscal year and a
 further increase of 3 percent in the next year.   About
 one-third of the budget will be allocated to the purchase
 of new weapons, including additional Tornado multiple-
 role aircraft, a third nuclear-powered attack submarine
 of the Trafalgar class, and several antisubmarine-warfare
 ships.  One-sixth of the budget is earmarked for weapons
 research, mainly on a new aircraft to replace the Jaguar
 and Harrier and a replacement for the Chieftain main bat-
 tle tank.   In a speech in London last weekend, NATO Sec-
 retary General Luns criticized the British for failing    25X1
 to provide for upgrading Britain's four Polaris subma-
 rines--the only non-US strategic forces assigned to
 ~
 NATO--which are due for retirement in the 1990s.//
 //China has agreed to purchase between 8.4 million
 and 10.5 million tons of wheat from Canada over the next
 three years, with shipments to begin next August.   Chinese
 purchases of Canadian grain averaged 2.5 million tons
 between 1971 and 1978, and exceeded 3 million tons in
 each of the last two years.   China previously negotiated
 three-year (1979-81)  agreements with Argentina for the
 purchase of 800,000 tons of grain annually, and with
 Australia for 2.5 million tons of wheat per year.   The
 Chinese also told US officials that they would buy 5
 million to 6 million tons annually from the US.   Alto-
 gether, China is expected to import 10 million to 13
 million tons of grain in each of the next few years.//

 TURKEY:   A Look Ahead
 25X1
 25X1
 25X1
 25X1
 Turkey's deepening economic and internal security
 problems are growing threats to Prime Minister Ecevit's
 left-of-center government--and,  ultimately,  to Turkish
 democracy.   The government's cohesiveness has been weak-
 ened,  its elan has faltered,  and its popularity is sag-
 ging.                                     Ecevit's two-seat majority in Parliament will prob-
 ably see him through the budget vote this week that is
 tantamount to a vote of confidence, but other hurdles
 lie immediately ahead both in and out of Parliament.   As
 the levels of unemployment and inflation continue to rise
 and political violence shows no signs of abating,  rifts
 in the ruling party are  likely to widen,  emboldening the
 opposition to step up efforts to bring down the govern-
 ment.   Ecevit could fall as a result of the senatorial
 election scheduled for October, if not before.   The coZ-
 lapse of his government might lead the watchful military
 establishment to increase its political role in the
 Ecevit passed his most recent test of strength Sunday
 when Parliament voted to approve the government's pro-
 posal to extend martial law another two months.                                    The
 crucial v ote on the budget must be held before Thursday.
 //Although Ecevit commands a slim majority in Par-
 liament,  strains created by Turkey's worsening problems
 make it impossible for him to take any vote for granted.
 The Ministers of Interior and Defense resigned last month,
 the Ministers of Justice and Finance have offered to do
 so, and other cabinet changes are likely after the budget
 vote.   Discontent has also percolated down to lower levels
 of Ecevit's Republican People's Party, where the temporary
 defection of one deputy last month almost caused the gov-
 ernment to fall on an opposition censure motion.   The
 party's left wing continues to grumble about martial law,
 some party centrists are discussing the possibility of a
 governing coalition with opposition deputies,  and at
 least 20 deputies have balked at Ecevit's tax package,
 which is likely to     e up in Parliament after the budget
 vote.//F---

 Sensing the government's vulnerability,  the opposi-
 tion is moving on all fronts to bring it down.   Justice
 Party leader Demirel is leading the assault with a highly
 f E  vit's
 partisan barrage against nearly all facets o    ce
 policies.   The Justice Party voted against martial law,
 and the budget debate is likely to be fierce.
 Demirel recently rebuffed President Koruturk's at-
 tempt to secure major party cooperation to deal with the
 country's problems.   His main objective in opposing Ecevit
 at this time probably is to establish a record on which
 to run in the next election,  though, of course, he may
 also hope to secure enough defections from the government
 to form another Justice-led coalition.
 Political Violence Persists
 The political struggles in Turkey are being played
 against a backdrop of violence that has cost nearly 1,000
 lives during Ecevit's 13 months in office.   The Prime
 Minister knew two months ago when he imposed martial law
 in 13 of Turkey's 67 provinces that he was taking a serious
 risk if the move failed to curb violence.   It is now
 clear that Ecevit's benign form of martial law is not
 25X1    working well.
 The level of violence subsided briefly after martial
 law was imposed, but it is now approaching the pre-martial
 law ratio of nearly 100 deaths per month.   Mass unrest
 is continuing in the more volatile eastern provinces
 where ideological differences are exacerbated by ethnic
 and sectarian rivalries, although so far not on the scale
 of the r'  ting that brought on martial law in late De-
 25X1         cember.
 Ecevit apparently had the support of his party's
 truculent left wing in the vote extending martial law
 two months.   The major surge of political violence has
 been in areas not under martial law, however, and pres-
 sure is likely t  build to extend martial law geograph-
 25X1         ically as well.
 The recent assassinations of Turkey's foremost
 journalist and a former high police official, as well as
 the attempted killing of a retired general imply that

 extremists are now aiming for the Turkish.elite.   This
 prospect--far more than the hundreds of deaths in the
 streets--has brought calls from military, political,  and
 religious leaders for stronger measures and has made some
 of them more willing to consider alternatives to Ecevit.

 ment is approaching 20 percent of the labor force,                                     for-
 eign currency reserves have almost disappeared, and in-
 dustrial production is less than 50 percent of capacity
 because of the lack of raw material imports.   Fearing
 the political and social consequences,  the government has
 so far been unwilling to take the additional austerity
 measures needed to free the third tranche of an Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund loan that would encourage private
 institutions to provide additional debt rescheduling and
 credits.
 The upheaval in Iran and the ensuing wave of Western
 concern about Turkey at first encouraged Turkish leaders
 to think that the country's potential donors might give
 higher priority to political than to economic criteria.
 That hope has waned, however,  as Turkey's would-be bene-
 factors have made it clear that agreement with the IMF
 and a comprehensive economic stabilization program would
 be essential prerequisites for most t  es of short- and
 medium-term assistance.
 Although Ecevit has steadfastly argued that credits
 must precede rather than follow additional austerity

 measures, he recently indicated he could accept a package
 in which they would be taken simultaneously.   But to take
 such measures--and sustain them--will involve political
 risks for Ecevit,  and Turkey's record in following through
 on such promises is not reassuring.                 25X1
 Military Restrained
 //So far,  the military has shown considerable re-
 straint both in carrying out its duties under martial law
 and in its relations with civilian leaders.   It is chafing
 under the tight control Ecevit maintains over martial law,
 however,  and some officers are complaining about having

 Apo
 their hands tied in dealing with extremists.   Also,  some
 officers seem to be becoming more assertive and less con-
 cerned about the government's political imperatives.
 Military calls for tougher measures are likely to increase,
 thereby setting the stage for friction with political
 leaders.   Worsening domestic conditions may ultimately
 lead the military to intervene in politics more obtru-
 sively,                    either to bring down the Ecevit government or to
 l
 ect its successor if it falls or resigns.//

 Outlook
 Ecevit's decisions to postpone his effort to push
 through his tax reform package and to refrain from seek-
 ing a geographical extension of martial law when he
 called for a two-month extension probably ensure that
 he will carry his party with him on the budget issue
 this week.   His bare majority and the backstage maneuver-
 ing by some government as well as the opposition deputies,
 however, preclude safe predictions.
 Additional austerity measures needed to keep the
 economy afloat will again test the government's cohesive-
 ness and the tolerance of the public.   If more members
 of the Turkish elite become victims of political violence,
 pressures will build on the government to clamp down
 harder, and Ecevit will face an unpalatable choice:   if
 he yields to the pressure, his party's left wing might
 bolt;  if he does not,  the military might take matters
 25X1     into its own hands.
 Ecevit may try to hold on until the scheduled sena-
 torial election in October.   A victory by his party then,
 or at least the avoidance of defeat, would give the gov-
 ernment a new lease on life.   Such a result, however,
 would depend on improved economic prospects and a toler-
 able level of political violence,  neither of which seems
 25X1     likely.
 25X1
 The involvement of the military leadership in se-
 lecting a successor could,  in the short term, produce a
 government more able and willing to cope with Turkey's
 problems.   But this would compromise the democratic
 process and,  in the longer term, might simply aggravate
 tensions within and among political,  social,  and economic
 groups when the military withdraws from politics.
