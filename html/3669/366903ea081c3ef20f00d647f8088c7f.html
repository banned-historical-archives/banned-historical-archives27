LIBYA-CHAD: Oadhafi Looking for an Out 
Libyan envoys are carrying a message to Arab states asking for 
support for a settlement of the Chadian conflict through the 
auspices of the OAU in order to av7id a confrontation with 
France  and the (U87)(  
 Tthe public has begun to criticize enly 
OA- 019 72/Cad Libyan leader Qadhafi's policy in Chad and the situation in ?e Libya. 
In a speech 4ateftley-7-Qadhafi reiterated to an audience? Tripoli his 
? support for the pro-Libyan rebels in Chad until Frenc orces leave 
the country, and he denied any involver-tient of LibI..n troops in the 
fighting there. 
25X1 
25X1 
Comment: Qadhafrhopes the offer of a settlement within an OAU 
framework will beracceptable to the French and the Chadians and   
allow him to avOid humiliation. He also believes an OAU-brokered 
settlement ight ensure the withdrawal of French and-RS support for 
Chad. En such a settlement, however, would be unlikely to preclude 
a popylar backlash in Libya against the defeats in Chad and the 
d yorating economic situation. 
/The order to segregate the reinforcements from those units being 
/ withdrawn from Chad almost certainly reflects Tripoli's desire to avoid 
any spreading of the contagion of defeatism among combat units.

TURKEY-GREECE: Aegean Tensions Ease 
Top Secret 
v25X1 
Tensions between Greece and Turkey over rights to the Aegean 
continental shelf continue to subside, although their military 
forces are still on alert  and the basic dispute remains 
unresolved. 25X1 
Turkish Prime Minister Ozal returned to Ankara from London 
yesterday and ordered warships alongside the Turkish research ship 
Sismik to avoid close escort. The ship itself remains in Turkish 
territorial waters. According to a press statement issued by Ozal, the 
military is no Ion er on full alert but remains in a state of increased 
readiness. 
Greek military preparations already in effect continue, but the Air 
Force has been ordered to avoid being drawn into possible 
provocations by the Turks. Prime Minister Papandreou has declined 
NATO Secretary General Carrington's ood offices but claims to have 
made bilateral overtures to the Turks. 
Comment: As long as the Sismik does not enter disputed waters and 
the Greeks do not stridently assert their continental shelf claims, 
tensions will subside, and the military preparations by each side will 
be scaled back accordingly. 
While the Turks have traditionally favored bilateral discussions on the 
continental shelf issue, the Greeks prefer taking it to the International 
Court of Justice. Papandreou probably will reiterate this position to 
the Turks, who are unlikely to accept his stance as a basis for 
discussions. At most, the two sides may reach a tacit a reement to 
disagree so that current tensions may be diffused.

BRAZIL: 
Deadline on Short-Term' Credits 
International banks probably will seek to force repayment of 
some of their short-term credits to Brazil this week, an action 
that could threaten Brazilian banking operations. 
25X1 
?)cY1 
25X1 
Brasilia last week requested its foreign bank creditors to maintain 6,-7t_J/ 
voluntarily through 31 May its nearly $15 billion in trade and interbank_) 
lines of credit that are set to expire teffiaproui. Brazil's advisory 
committee of international bankers refused to endorse this request 
because the Sarney government had rejected the bankers' request 
for a goodwill gesture, such as an interest payment on medium- and 
long-term debt. 25X1 
In recent meetings with foreign bankers, Brasilia reiterated that it 
plans to freeze the short-term credits in its Central Bank if foreign 
banks attempt to reduce them. Central Bank President Gros 
admitted, however, that the freeze is legally binding only within Brazil. 
25X1 
25X1 
 Some international bankers believe short- 25X1 
term credits will drop by as much as 20 percent after4eiertew. 2 / 
77/a)cei 
r 25X1 
Comment: Most large international banks probably will maintain their 
short-term credits because they do not want to precipitate a crisis 
and because they wish to avoid having their lines frozen in Brazil's 
Central Bank. 
Some smaller banks, however, probably will seek to reduce their lines 
to Brazil. If the freeze order is not followed, some Brazilian bank 
branches overseas could experience cash flow problems and be 
forced to close. Brazil's ability to conduct trade also would be 
adversely affected. 
Brazilian banks that refuse creditor demands for repayment risk 
lawsuits to attach assets. International bankers' actions against 
Brazilian banks could lead the Sarney government to nationalize 
Brazil's banking system temporarily.

ANGOLA: 
UNITA's Benguela Railway Proposal 
The public offer by UNITA to permit traffic along the Benguela 
Railway was probably designed to apply pressure on Luanda and 
to boost public relations, but Angola's longstanding rejection of a 
dialo ? ue with the insurgent group makes an agreement unlikely. 
UNITA leader Savimbi announced -Friday that he Is prepared to 
guarantee safe passage for nonmilitary freight along the Benguela 
Railway as a sign of his commitment to national reconciliation. He 
also challenged the Angolan Government to match the insurgents' 
offer and allow goods to pass through the country. The rail line, which 
runs from southern Zaire to Angola's ort of Lobito, has been closed 
since 1975 because of the civil war. 
Comment: Savimbi probably calculates that a refusal to negotiate by 
Luanda would scuttle the initiative and give UNITA a valuable 
propaganda advantage in Africa and the West. 
Angolan officials, on the other hand, probably fear that talks would 
provide a tacit grant of legitimacy to the insurgents, opening the door 
for further Western support and recognition of UNITA and increasing 
international pressure on Luanda to compromise with the rebels. 
Neighboring states that could benefit from a reopening of the 
Benguela line may?in an effort to reduce their dependence on South 
African transport routes?encourage Luanda to respond favorably to 
UNITA's proposal. Luanda nevertheless is likely to ignore the 
proposal altogether or craft a response that includes preconditions, 
such as only indirect talks with the insurgent group, unacceptable to 
UNITA.

 Meanwhile, the 
fighting between Palestinian defenders of the besieged refugee 
camps and Shia Amal militiamen is intensifying and may soon spread 
to other parts of the capital. 
Comment: Attacks on the Syrian forces in West Beirut almost 
certainly will increase over the coming months. Several competing 
anti-Syrian militias have reluctantly withdrawn from the city but are 
adopting hit-and-run tactics to harass Syria's soldiers and to 
undermine Syrian resolve. The escalating attacks on Syrian soldiers, 
however, are likely to force Dam-ascus to deal harshly with the largely 
pro-Palestinian attackers, further eroding the fragile peace in West 
Beirut and drawing Syria into a more costly confrontation?one it has 
successfully avoided so far

later stalled over the issue of interest rates..

accepLIVIar.oposallor.alQW,MInterest.rate.in.return-fer. 
,pr.epayatemt.of.a.port4ora.of.the--Rtillippines-1-outstancting..delstt The 
Philippines will pay a spread of 0.875 of a percentage point over the 
banks' cost of funds so long as interest payments remain current; if 
Manila falls in arrears, the spread will rise to 1 percent. Moreover, the 
banks have the option of converting their interest payments into 
Philippine investment notes thaLwouk finance government-approved 
investment in the Philippines. 
Comment: Although the interest rate is higher than Manila originally 
planned, it is the lowest rate granted recently to any Third World 
debtor except Mexico and could save the Philippines over 
$100 million a year in debt payments. The agreement is also a political 
victory for President Aquino and her chief negotiator, Finance 
Secretary Ongpin, who had been under domestic pressure to reach a 
settlement with the interest rate spread below 1 percent. Manila 
hopes the agreement will boost investor confidence, but foreign 
investors probably will wait to see the results of the natio 
election in May before committing substantial new funds.

POLAND: Price Increases Scaled Back 
The Jaruzelski regime portrayed the price increases for food, fuels, 
and many public services announced-  as smaller tWair"----
planned because of a compromise with the official unions. Meat 
prices will rise 10 percent, and other food prices will go up more than 
9 percent? 25 percent less than had been planned. Prices for public 
transportation, gasoline, electricity, and coal will increase from 
23 to 50 percent. To soften the impact of these price hikes, the regime 
has pledged to increase benefits for low-income workers and to limit 
taxes on any future wage increase. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa 
criticized the rice increases but stopped short of calling for protest 
strikes. 
25X1 
25X1 
Comment: The compromise with the official unions furthers the 
regime's goal of portraying the unions as an advocate of workers' 
interests and a viable alternative to Solidarity. The decision 
nonetheless raises doubts about Warsaw's stated intention to reduce 
subsidies and narrow the gap between market supplies and demand. 
The price hikes will contribute to popular discontent over living 
standards, but they were widely anticipated and are likely to provoke 
no more than scattered protests. 
POLAND: Another Rescheduling Proposal 
Warsaw has proposed that more than $12 billion in long-term official 
debt relief for Poland be considered at a Paris Club meeting 
0-bujf /71011-C1/1.---t4emerfew: The plan?less attractive to Western creditors than the 
Polish proposal in January?calls for a deferral of the majority of 
repayments due between 1986 and 1993. Warsaw says it will 
negotiate an adjustment program linked to an IMF standby 
agreement while bargaining with government creditors 
Comment: This proposal probably is a negotiating tactic?intended 
to exploit creditor concerns over the impact of the Brazilian 
moratorium?in order to gain easier rescheduling terms and smaller 
payments. Warsaw must make some concessions, however, because 
government creditors have steadfastly refused to renegotiate the 
accord reached in 1981. An eventual rescheduling agreement is 
probable because payments by Poland owed governments over the 
next three years exceed $3 billion annually, and Warsaw contends it 
can pay no more than $2 billion. A long-term solution will require 
significant economic reforms and austerity measures, which the 
Jaruzelski regime appears unwilling to implement, as well as a major 
new debt-relief package from all creditors.

Comment: By visiting Ortega, Cerezo is seeking to balance his 
participation in the Core Four summit with the Presidents of 
El Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica last month. He is not likely to 
press Ortega for domestic political reforms because he wants to 
prevent Nicaraguan isolation in regional peace talks. Instead, Cerezo 
probably will seek a public endorsement of his initiative to establish a 
Central American parliament, a proposal to be discussed at the 
summit in Guatemala. He probably hopes that his offer to support 
Tegucigalpa in a conflict with Nicaragua would deflect criticisms of his 
trip by the other Core Four countries and the Guatemalan military.

CHINA: Zhao Takes Charge 
In his first major speech since becoming Acting General 
Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Premier Zhao Ziyang 
recently attempted to assert his authority to revive Beijing's 
stalled reform program. He also sought to mollify the concerns of 
orthodox party officials about the country's economic problems 
and over the spread of Western political ideas in China. 
In his annual report to the National People's Congress, Zhao claimed 
credit for improving economic performance last year, but he 
acknowledged continuing problems with inflation, excessive 
investment spending, slow growth in grain production, and the trade 
deficit. He told the delegates Beijing would maintain credit restraints 
and closely monitor new construction projects to ensure stable 
growth this year, but he claimed that many of China's economic 
problems last year were caused by the incomplete implementation of 
reforms. Zhao argued that Beijing should revitalize its efforts. 
Although Zhao did not propose any new initiative, the policies he 
enumerated would significantly decentralize economic decision 
making in China. For example, to allow enterprises greater control 
over production, he called for expanding experiments with financial, 
labor, and raw materials markets and hinted that Beijing would 
shortly eliminate central guidelines on wage payments in state 
enterprises. 
Zhao also vigorously defended price reform. He admitted, however, 
that too rapid increases in prices could intensify consumer 
resentment and promised that Beijing would not implement major 
price adjustments this year. Zhao's inability to set a schedule for price 
reform and his failure to defend the enterprise bankruptcy regulations 
issued last fall indicate that he does no Lhvte clout to proceed 
with these politically sensitive reforms. 
Domestic Politics, Foreign Policy 
Zhao is now walking a line between building a consensus behind his 
leadership and keeping key elements of the reform program alive; this 
was reflected in the cautious, balanced tone of his speech and in his 
efforts to incorporate something for everyone in his remarks. The 
presence of Hu Yaobang at the session?sitting "stony faced," 
according to press accounts?was intended to portray a unified 
leadership that has simply been through a routine personnel shift. 
Zhao criticized recent weak leadership but also held out an olive 
branch to Hu's supporters, sa in. that those who had made mistakes 
could still do useful work

To ? Secret 
25X1 
The repeated mention of limits on the "antibourgeois liberalism" 
drive demonstrates that Zhao?probably backed by Deng Xiaoping?
is determined to keep this campaign on a tight rein. Since shortly 
after Hu's ouster, Zhao has stressed the need to limit the campaign; 
available evidence indicates that he has had some success in 
enforcing such curbs.  
Zhao's constant return to the theme of limits?he has stressed it on 
numerous other occasions?may also indicate that there are many 
who do not agree and who would, if given the opportunity, expand the 
scope of the campaign significantly. In a possible concession to 
traditionalists, Zhao plainly stated that the drive against undesirable 
Western influences is a task still requiring great efforts. 
The speech gave even less attention to foreign policy than the brief 
discussions in such speeches in past years. Apart from the ritual 
assertion of China's foreign policy independence and peaceful 
intentions, the only specific points Zhao made were that the 
agreement on Hong Kong was working smoothly, a successful 
agreement had been negotiated on Macau, and Taiwan should 
therefore accept the principle of "one country, two systems" as a 
reasonable solution to reunification. Formalistic statements on 
foreign policy are the norm in the annual report, and the scant 
attention paid to foreign affairs this year probably reflects the greater 
urgency of domestic concerns. 
Outlook 
Zhao appears to be moving decisively to establish his authority in his 
new position and in the currently uncertain, shifting political 
environment. Taking care to avoid offending powerful conservatives 
in the party, he will probably concentrate in the next few months on 
consolidating his position before the party congress in October. 
According to a party spokesman, Zhao will be confirmed there as the 
party's General Secretary. 
Zhao's remarks clearly indicate a determination to get on with 
aspects of reform despite the serious, frankly admitted problems 
some of these changes will engender. His ability to do so will depend 
not only on his political skills, however, but also on his success in 
reining in new investment spending and imports.

Special Analysis 
MIDDLE EAST- Impact of US Arms Sales to Iran 
USSR: 
Arab anger over US arms sales to Iran has done little damage to 
US interests in the Middle East, but some Arab leaders are 
avoiding open contacts with Washington in a bid to show their 
displeasure. Arabs have been receptive to recent US steps to 
protect Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and to public 
statements by senior US officials that there will be no further 
arms sales to Iran while its war with Iraq continues. Iran, 
meanwhile, sees the episode as a significant moral victory, 
strengthening its resolve to continue fighting until Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn has been ousted. The Soviets seem 
unable to exploit the affair to their advantage. 
The Arab leaders' initial anger over the arms sales to Iran has 
dissipated. Moderate Arab leaders, especially Saudi King Fahd, still 
believe they were deceived and betrayed by US actions but have 
resisted retaliating, believing that would hurt their interests vis-a-vis 
Washington. Postponed visits to the US by Egyptian President 
Mubarak, Jordanian King Hussein, and North Yemeni President Salih 
have been the most tangible signals of Arab displeasure. 
Measured Iraqi reaction reflects similar concerns in Baghdad that 
attempts at punitive actions would be counterproductive. The Iraqis 
see little practical alternative to maintaining good relations with the 
US, particularly when Tehran is applying increased military pressure 
along the front. The affair has seriously eroded Iraqi faith in US 
credibility, however, and Baghdad is likely to remain wary of closer 
ties to the US for several years. 
Other Arab states probably have been reassured by the US response 
to Iran's acquisition of Silkworm antiship missiles. The US offer to 
provide military protection to Kuwaiti oil tankers and strong US public 
warnings about Iran's use of those missiles have been widely 
applauded by the Arab states on the Persian Gulf. Moreover, 
moderate Arab leaders probably believe that recent statements by 
senior US officials about the Iran affair and personnel changes within 
the US administration signal a change of direction in US Middle East 
policy more favorable to themselves. 
Positive comments by senior US officials about a possible 
international conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict also have eased 
Arab frustrations with Washington's policies. Mubarak and Hussein 
are particularly eager to gain a more active US role in the peace 
process, and they do not want the US-Iran affair to undermine 
moderate Arab objectives on key regional issues or to complicate 
their efforts to gain increased US military and economic assistance.

Reactions in Tehran, Moscow 
Publicity has reinforced Iran's view that it can dictate to the US and 
embarrass Washington. There has been little negative domestic 
political fallout in Tehran, as Consultative Assembly Speaker 
Rafsanjani has skillfully portrayed dealings with the US as Iranian 
manipulation of a superpower. Moreover, Ayatollah Khomeini's public 
endorsement of Iranian actions has silenced critics. 
The affair probably has had little impact on Tehran's war policy or on 
its ability to acquire materiel. Tehran probably is more determined to 
continue fighting until Saddam is ousted, however, believing US 
actions were spurred by a growing Western view that an Iranian 
victory is inevitable. The flow of arms to Iran may increase over time, 
as arms sellers see US actions as legitimizing their sales. 
Moscow has been unable to make significant gains in the region as a 
result of the US-Iran affair, despite its efforts to portray US policy as 
damaging to Arab interests. The Soviets' inability to gain a primary 
role in protecting Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf reflects moderate Arab 
reluctance to give Moscow a major security role. The improvement in 
Soviet-Iraqi ties probably reflects Moscow's concern about Iraq's 
prospects in the war rather than any successful exploitation of the US 
arms sales to Iran 
Outlook 
Arab displeasure with the US arms sales to Iran is likely to decrease 
steadily over the next several months. The moderate Arabs, who 
acknowledge the importance of cultivating Western ties to Tehran, 
probably believe the sales resulted from an aberration in US olic on 
the Iran-Iraq war and concerning the hostages in Lebanon 
The issue nonetheless probably has reinforced the view of many 
Arabs that US policy in the region is designed to further Israeli 
objectives. Increasing skepticism of the US probably has hastened 
the efforts of some Arab moderates to seek al  ernative sources of 
security assistance.

Special Analysis 
IRAN-IRAQ: 
ILLEGIB 
Southern Front Quiet 
The Iran-Iraq ground war probably will continue at a low level of 
intensity as both sides prepare for Tehran's next large offensive. 
Iranian forces are firmly entrenched east of Al Basrah, and Iraq is 
unlikely to try to regain ground there. Iraqi airstrikes on Khark 
Island and offshore oil platforms last week suggest, however, 
that Baghdad may renew efforts to force a change in Tehran's 
war policy by bombing Iranian economic targets. 
With both sides recovering from more than two months of intense 
fighting, the relative calm may continue into summer. Large reserves 
of men and materiel, however, remain on the southern front. Iranian 
forces continue to threaten Al Basrah and may mount a large attack 
within the next few weeks, although they are more likely to conduct 
periodic probes 
Iraq will continue its cautious, defensive strategy?fending off Iranian 
probes and keeping the bulk of its forces in reserve. Its Air Force has 
had a badly needed respite from the hundreds of missions it  flew 
almost daily between the first of the year and mid-February. 
Baghdad is not likely to decide to renew airstrikes against civilian 
targets unless Iran launches another major ground attack, but it 
probably will gradually increase air attacks on Iranian economic 
targets. The expectation of another ground offensive and concern 
about improvements in Iranian air defenses around vital economic 
facilities have probably reinforced Iraq's longstanding policy of 
conserving its airpower. A consistent, effective air campaign against 
economic targets nonetheless remains Iraq's best hope for applying 
pressure on Tehran. 
Meanwhile, Iran has recovered from the airstrikes last fall that 
badly damaged key oil and industrial facilities. Oil exports and 
electric power have been restored to near-normal levels.

Special Analysis 
USSR: Gorbachev, Legal Reforms, and the KGB 
As part of his push for "democratization," General Secretary 
Gorbachev is taking steps to make the administration of justice 
in the USSR more equitable and the use of police power there 
less arbitrary. These measures may help to raise the integrity of 
the law enforcement system in the eyes of the population, but 
they are not being well received by some elements of the KGB. 
Perhaps for this reason, Gorbachev is attematina to kee7 a 
closer watch over the security apparatus. 
In his speech at the plenum of the party's Central Committee in late 
January, Gorbachev urged revisions in the law code to strengthen 
"socialist legality." He emphasized the need to guarantee redress for 
citizens whose rights are abused by public officials. A Central 
Committee decree in November announced measures to ensure that 
police pretrial investigations and court proceedings are not biased. 
Soviet officials are discussing the possible repeal of Articles 70 and 
190 of the criminal code, which have been used to convict dissidents 
of "anti-Soviet agitation" and "anti-Soviet slander." Labor camp 
officials have been more attentive to the complaints by political 
prisoners of mistreatment. 
Gorbachev's Actions, Motives 
Gorbachev has sanctioned exposure in the media of abuses by the 
police, the courts, and the KGB. At the plenum he described the 
Interior Ministry as one of the most corrupt Soviet institutions. Since 
then, a decree by that ministry has called for an expanded purge of 
corrupt officials. 
The head of the Interior Ministry, Aleksandr Vlasov, has announced 
the arrest of several police officers for various abuses. The press has 
also reported cases of police brutality and revealed instances when 
local party officials have carried out vendettas against their personal 
enemies by arranging to get them convicted of crimes that they did 
not commit. 
Even the KGB has failed to escape this drive. In January, KGB 
Chairman Chebrikov publicly chastised a Ukrainian KGB official for 
arranging the arrest of a journalist who was investigating official 
malfeasance, and he pledged that the KGB would operate within the 
law. A senior KGB official has subse uentl been censured for failing 
to enforce anticorruption decrees. 
Also in January, Anatoliy Lukyanov, a Gorbachev protege and a 
lawyer who has advocated legal reforms, was elevated to the party's

Secretariat. The pattern of his public appearances indicates that he is 
responsible for the security apparatus. 
Setting norms for "socialist legality" is an important part of 
Gorbachev's efforts to build public confidence in the party and to 
enhance his own reformist image. Many Soviet citizens have long 
regarded law enforcement agencies largely as instruments of 
coercion. More than 15 percent of all citizen complaints to the party 
were about the police or the court; 
Gorbachev may see a need for closer political supervision of the KGB. 
Unlike former Soviet leaders Brezhnev and Andropov, he does not 
have a network of his own clients at the top levels of the KGB. The 
appointment of Lukyanov probably reflects both Gorbachev's 
commitment to "democratization" and his desire to have a loyal 
associate overseeing the KGB. Two Soviet officials told US diplomats 
independently that the appointment ofLukyanov tightens 
Gorbachev's control of the party. 
The Risks Involved 
Gorbachev's legal reforms and his relaxation of censorship are 
evidently antagonizing some KGB officials. KGB officers were 
probably unhappy over the humiliation of their Ukrainian collea ue, 
which signaled a shift from the policy of shielding 
KGB officers in Georgia, Latvia, and Leningrad have sought to bl c 
the release of controversial film?ccoar-GliagJALLJaagbassetivesQ 
The dispersal of a Jewish demonstration in Moscow last month by 
plainclothes policemen may have been a KGB provocation not 
authorized by Gorbachev but designed to embarrass him. 
Some evidence suggests that KGB chief Chebrikov, reportedly a key 
ally of Gorbachev, has become less supportive of Gorbachev's 
policies. Chebrikov's speeches show little enthusiasm for openness 
the mediaWfur-E,R4baswasreweeeaftepeskeet pst fall6hat Chebrikov 
feared that economic reform might endanger internal securit 
senior KGB officials continue to 
support Gorbachev, if not all of his policies. 
25X1 
Gorbachev realizes the political importance of maintaining the loyalty 
of Chebrikov and the KGB. While Chebrikov on his own poses no 
threat to the General Secretary given the collegial environment in the 
Politburo, Gorbachev needs the KGB's cooperation in monitoring the 
Soviet elite. He is undoubtedly weighing carefully measures that might 
threaten the KGB's equities at the same time that he is usin 
Lukyanov to provide oversight of the KGB's operations.
