 India-Pakistan: Fighting in the East
 The largest and most costly military clashes
 in the eight-month-old Indo-Pakistani conflict
 erupted inside East Pakistan on 21 November.
 Mukti Bahini guerrillas, apparently supported by
 Indian air and ground forces including armor,
 fought Pakistani troops in a region between the
 West Bengal/East Pakistan border and Jessore
 town, some 20 miles inside East Pakistan. Con-
 firmation of widespread Indian military involve-
 men-: at Jessore is not available, but it is likely
 that Indian regulars, perhaps up to two 3,000-
 man brigades, participated in the operation, and
 that they penetrated some eight miles into East
 Pakistan.
 Indian officials at first maintained that the
 offensive was solely the action of Bengali insur-
 gents, but on 24 November, an Indian govern-
 ment spokesman admitted that Indian tanks had
 crossed the border three days earlier in what he
 described as a defensive action in which 13 Paki-
 stani tanks were destroyed. Also on 24 Novem-
 ber, !'rime Minister Gandhi told Parliament that
 Indian troops were instructed not to cross the
 borders "except in self-defense."

 The fighting was heaviest in the Jessore area,
 but incursions were also reported into the dis-
 tricts of Sylhet, Comilla, and Chittagong, as well
 as in the Chittagong Hills. Pakistan claims Indian
 troops were fighting in five places on East Paki-
 stani territory.
 In the first report of aerial losses, the Indians
 claim to have downed three Pakistani F-86s over
 Indian territory and to have captured two Paki-
 stani pilots. The Pakistanis admit losing two air-
 craft and claim they downed two Indian fighter
 jets.
 The View from Islamabad
 Shortly after the fighting broke out, Islama-
 bad accused India of instigating an "all-out offen-
 sive" and later threatened to request an emer-
 gency meeting of the UN Security Council to
 consider the alleged Indian incursion. On 23
 November, President Yahya Khan declared a state
 of emergency, citing the "threat of external ag-
 gression" as the cause. The next day he called up
 the Pakistani reserves. These moves were taken
 primarily to dramatize the situation at home and
 abroad. In fact, Pakistan has been under martial
 law since March 1969, and the country has almost
 no reserve system.
 The Jessore clash followed closely on the
 heels of several conciliatory gestures by the Paki-
 stani  President.  In  his  message  marking the
 Muslim holiday last weekend, Yahya offered a
 "hand of friendship" to India, his most con-
 ciliatory language in recent months. The message
 followed a cordial meeting between Yahya and
 the newly designated Indian high commissioner to
 Pakistan, J. K. Atal.
 There have also been indications that Yahya
 is becoming somewhat more receptive to the pos-
 sibility  of negotiating with the disaffected

 Bengalis, as it becomes more apparent that a
 move in this direction may be the price he will
 have to pay for preserving the nation. Yahya
 appears to be trying to gain enough time to trans-
 fer power to a civilian government, which accord-
 ing to his plans will be established in early
 January.

 holiday message and the escalating border clashes

 providE, little hope for an early political settle-
 ment of the crisis. Mrs. Gandhi publicly stated
 that if Yahya is sincere, he must release Bengali
 leader Mujibur Rahman, forgo the "farce" of
 by-elections in East Pakistan next month, and
 negotiate a political accommodation with the
 East Bengalis. Moreover, New Delhi still shuns
 international initiatives which it considers would
 only delay progress toward establishing virtual
 independence in East Pakistan. Thus, India ap-
 pears increasingly willing to risk a major war with
 Pakistan in order to force Islamabad toward a
 political settlement that would enable a sub-
 stantial  number of the  10 million Pakistani
 refugees to return home.
 In addition, India is adding substantially to
 its support of the Mukti Bahini and broadening its
 press coverage of guerrilla successes.
 The Mukti Bahini- Growing Audacity
 The guerrillas are estimated to be in control
 of almost a third of rural East Pakistan, and the
 Pakistani Army and volunteer militia apparently
 provide little more than a facade of law and order
 in the remainder of the province. In Dacca, the
 army's search operation for Mukti Bahini ele-
 ments last week resulted in some 500 arrests and
 netted leaflets and a small number of weapons.
 The continuing wave of incidents in the capital
 demonstrates that insurgent activity has not been
 effectively reduced.
 There is also evidence that the guerrillas have
 decided that UN relief efforts will no longer be
 exempted from sabotage operations. On 23
 November,  two  UN-marked coastal vessels
 berthed at Narayanganj-about 20 miles from
 Dacca-were mined.  In addition, several  UN
 trucks were reportedly commandeered by the
 Pakistani Army. The guerrillas have long held that
 UN operations support the Pakistani military.
 Fear for the safety of UN personnel led to the
 evacuation to Bangkok of about 40 nonessential
 staff and dependents on Tuesday. The accom-
 panying recall of UN workers from outlying posts
 to Dacca and Chittagong brings the 85-man relief
 operation to a virtual halt, at least temporar-
 ily.

 Egypt: More Talk of War
 President Sadat capped the bellicose rhetoric
 coming out of Cairo recently with two tough
 speeches last weekend. Speaking to military units,
 the Egyptian leader 'declared that "the time for
 battle has come" because there was no longer any
 hope for a peaceful solution. He claimed the US
 does not want serious N-peace negotiations and
 charged that Washington' S procrastination was
 designed to give Israel whatjt could not obtain by
 fighting in 1967. Sadat said the negotiations Israel
 had been seeking in the cotjtext of Secretary
 Roger's initiative would have  one on endlessly,
 allowing Tel Aviv's occupationCof the Sinai to
 become a fait accompli.
 Sadat's remarks may have been ntended

 Sadat dou3tless also hoped his remarks
 would bring a _ increase in international pressure
 on Israel. Neweek, Egypt is expected to seek a
 resolution i  the UN General Assembly calling on
 Israel to rypond positively to Jarring's initiative.
 Cairo is y fso likely to test the atmosphere in New
 York toward sanctions and an arms embargo
 against Tel Aviv.
 Meanwhile, public apprehension is growing
 in Israel, and governmpnt officials have accused
 Sadat of heightening Aar hysteria and of boxing
 himself in. Foreigl  Minister Eban called upon
 Sadaf o "stop the public bombast" and to nego-
 tiate a  ttlement. Declaring that Israel would not

 Cambodia: To the Rescue Again
 The South Vietnamese have responded to
 Cambodian requests for help with a new dry-
 season campaign against Communist main-force
 units, in eastern Kompong Cham Province. Ele-
 ments of a large South Vietnamese task force
 crossed the border on 22 November and have
 moved virtually unopposed along Route 7 in the
 initial phase of the operation.
 I-amiodi-ans obviously were reluctant to
 .be. South Vietnamese troops return, especially

 that the movement of South Vietnamese units
 into eastern Kompong Cham Province will by
 itself relieve the pressure around the Cambodian
 capital, since the Communist units there are not
 responsible for defending the plantations in Kom-
 pong Cham. It is possible that the South Vietnam-
 ese drive will force the Communists to pull their
 9th Division regiments away from operations
 against Cambodian troops in the Chenla II area
 along Route 6.

 A government task force, twice reorganized,
 recaptured the village of Tuol Leap unopposed,
 but it has made little progress in driving the
 Communists from this area. Major elements of the
 enemy's Phuoc Long Front remain within striking
 distance of the capital. Several additional bat-
 talions from the Chenla II area have been airlifted
 to Phnom Penh by South Vietnamese helicopters
 and are scheduled to join renewed clearing opera-
 tions at week's end
 South Vietnam: The-Opposition Lies Low ._,
 The- strtvtt?"- ?o fftic~`f-pdsition of .the Thieu
 government is attributable in part to the weakness
 and division of the opposition. Radical student
 and veterans groups, which were in the forefront
 of anti-government demonstrations q&ring the
 presidential election campaign, have Aden quiet in
 recent weeks. Their leaders are cplaining pri-
 vately that they have been una a to get much
 support for agitation either fry~  their own fol-
 lowers or from other anti-government leaders.
 One veterans' faction is evp  said to be looking
 for ways to cooperate witn'1resident Thieu.
 ill
 Other influentialppposition groups also have
 indicated that they will keep a low profile for the
 time being. The  .ter Quang Buddhists, the one
 group capable of  osing a serious threat to gov-
 ernment stability ,apparently will stick to a mod-
 erate policy o seeking to improve their position
 by working within the system. Tri Quang, the
 leading poljic:al voice among the Buddhists, be-
 lieves tha'An Quang should accept the fact that
 they cantot force Thieu out of office. Tri Quang
 was a rti otivating force behind An Quang's partici-
 pation" in the recent legislative elections, and he
 apparently intends to rely heavily on representa-
 tives in the National Assembly to advance Bud-
 dhist"interes"'f's. He' has-no-strong challengers for
 power--=within-.the An Quang move.merA_4,  his
 views probably will predominate. Some other fn-
 Quang leaders favor a more active 4nti-govern-
 ment policy, however, and they will continue to
 look for opportunities to promote' their views.
 There are indications that the Progressive
 Nationalist Movenr nt-one of the country's
 strongest politip& parties-may abandon its pos-
 ture of mo4ate opposition and join the govern-
 ment  mp. Some of the party's leaders have been
 ne  rating with presidential aides, but they pri-
 ville y acknowledge that other elements of the
 party favor a- continued opposition TS000P .
 Reaction to the economic reform package
 announced by the government last week has been
 surprisingly mild thus far. Some critics of the
 government have attacked the reforms, but their
 protests have looked pro forma. Many people
 have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and if prices
 continue to rise as a result of the measures, the
 protests are certain to increase in intensity.
 For its part, the government is strengthening
 its position in the newly elected Lower House,
 and it now appears to have a majority of the
 deputies firmly in its camp. At the urging of
 presidential aides, pro-government deputies are
 taking a tough line and are refusing to com-
 promise with the opposition. Although these
 tactics will help assure majority support for the
 government, they could alienate some inde-
 pendent and moderate opposition deputies whose
 backing may be needed in the future. In the past,
 the government has been able to secure passage of
 high-priority legislation by mustering a two-thirds
 majority in the Lower House to override less
 desirable Upper House versions. It now is ques-
 tionable whether the government's tactics will
 deliver a consistent two-thirds vote in the new
 house.

 Thailand: Tying Up Loose Ends
 It was scarcely a revolution or even a coup,
 but the military leaders who were quick to apply
 those labels to the abrogation of the constitution
 last week have had to make changes in the admin-
 istrative machinery that rules Thailand. Although
 not significant in themselves, the changes have
 given rise to some maneuvering among second and
 third echelons in the military establishment and
 have provided some indications about the future
 fortunes of some of the principal military leaders.
 A new 16-man National Executive Council,
 with Field Marshal Thanom as chairman, will ex-
 ercise authority for an interim period of three or
 four months until a new cabinet is set up under a
 provisional constitution. The day-to-day conduct
 of affairs will be under the jurisdiction of military
 and civilian "divisions." The military division is
 headed by General Praphat, and the civilian by
 General Prasert. This could be a step up for
 Labor Demonstration in Tokyo on the 18th
 Prasert, but it seems likely that Thanom and
 Praphat will keep him on a short leash. Q-t  g finer _,
 in the new setup is General Krit who, in addition
 to being deputy commander of therrrr         forces,
 now acts as secretary gene al of 15e -ruling revolu-
 tionary party. Thereis`some speculation in Bang-
 kok that Krit riow is the number-three man in the
 rulirig, hierarchy.
 The--pr+ne-ipal -losers in the shuffle appear to
 be Thanom's brother, Sanga Kittika   xn, whose
 assertiveness annoyed-.-.the -other  leaders, and
 Sawaeng_..Senanorong, the only top leader who
 opposed the scuttling of parliament. Former for-
 eign minister Thanat has still not been given a
 position in the new administrative machinery, but
 the fact that he was selected to represent Thai-
 land at the ASEAN meeting suggests that he still
 has a future.

 Thanom has publicly promised a return to con-

 consumption. The ease with which the military lead-

 of Japan stemming from the Japanese occupation.

 Communist China's Educational Policies
 Several  key elements in  Mao Tse-Tung's
 radical reform of higher education may be modi-
 fied as China's universities open for their second
 year of operation since the Cultural Revolution.
 The treatment given higher education in domestic
 propaganda suggests that a number of problems
 remain, but a major article in Red Flag, the
 authoritative party journal, earlier this fall does
 indicate that a more moderate approach is likely
 to prevail in many places.
 The  article  reviewed  the difficulties in-
 volved in "revolutionizing" scientific and tech-
 nical training at Tsinghua University, China's fore-
 most engineering school. When Tsinghua resumed
 full-time classes last fall, it introduced several
 Maoist innovations, but they sparked considerable
 debate, precipitated serious conflicts over enroll-
 ment policy and the curriculum, and damaged
 teacher morale and student discipline. Red Flag's
 candid description of the problems encountered
 at Tsinghua probably reflects guidelines formu-
 lated at a lengthy national education conference
 concluded  in September in  Peking-guidelines
 which are still apparently being debated at other
 colleges and universities.
 The lengthy delay in developing a program
 for higher education in China clearly is the result
 of   the  inherent  difficulties  involved  in
 maintaining academic quality while responding to
 Mao's call in July 1968 to break the intellectuals'
 stranglehold on the education system. Mao or-
 dered that university schooling be shortened and
 that curricula be oriented away from theoretical
 studies toward political and vocational training.
 Students were to be drawn primarily from among
 workers, peasants, and soldiers. Former faculty
 members were to undergo rigorous political re-
 education, and universities were to be placed
 under the control of worker-soldier propaganda
 teams which were to carry some of the instruc-
 tional load.
 While the Red Flag article reaffirms these
 prescriptions, it stresses their negative impact and
 suggests they should be modified substantially in
 practice. It argues, for example, that time-con-
 suming political re-education and labor require-
 ments  have  curbed the enthusiasm  of many
 faculty members and disrupted their "personal

 ease of mind." It recommends they be given more
 say in determining course content and more time
 to prepare lectures and engage in professional
 research, including the "discriminating" study of
 foreign scientific and technical journals.
 The pragmatism of Red Flag was also under-
 scored by its proposals for sharp limitations on
 student power, at its zenith during the Red Guard
 phase of the Cultural Revolution. According to
 Red Flag, activist students should no longer be
 allowed to interrupt lectures when they spot po-
 litical errors, and propaganda teams are to refrain
 from differing with the teacher's professional
 judgment. Although these concessions hardly
 presage complete academic freedom, they attest
 not only to the renewed concern for the quality
 of higher education, but also to the tenacious
 resistance of teachers to the Maoist anti-intel-
 lectual bias. Indeed, many have refused to return
 to teaching  because of persistent political
 intimidation.
 Red Flag had some critical comments on the
 program for recruiting worker-peasant-soldier stu-
 dents into the university. Recruits from this
 group caused serious difficulties when they were
 thrust into classes alongside more qualified
 former students who returned to school last year
 after performing manual labor on farms and in
 factories since 1968. Red Flag admits that at-
 tempts to treat all students in the prescribed
 Maoist egalitarian fashion proved so demoralizing
 that the  worker-peasant-soldier  students  ulti-
 mately had to be given "supplemental" academic
 work.
 The Tsinghua solution suggests that Peking is
 attempting to return to a more demanding educa-
 tional curriculum-a proposal that has been cas-
 tigated by radicals as an attempt to "dish out a
 capitalist double-track system." If widely copied,
 it would mean that programs not currently availa-
 ble on a broad scale would be offered to capable
 students in an effort to remedy the serious short-
 comings caused by the cessation of higher educa-
 tion during the Cultural Revolution.
 The moderate thrust of Red Flag has been
 echoed in other articles in recent weeks. These,
 include a frank admission by the directors of one
 engineering college that they had been remiss in
 neglecting basic theoretical course work. The
 admission stands in sharp contrast with a number
 of articles by other university authorities stressing
 only practical course content. Sentiment for a
 change is not only limited to course content,
 however; controversies also exist over other as-
 pects of the Maoist reforms-the university-spon-
 sored factory system, the attenuated period of
 schooling at both lower and higher levels, and the
 banning of a wide range of sociological and tech-
 nical books formerly used in the schools.
 The present debate by no means signals a
 complete departure from the broader Maoist goal
 of providing university students a mix of basic
 formal training and practical labor. Peking, in
 fact, remains committed to the retention of
 propaganda teams as permanent ideological
 watchdogs in the colleges, and to linking ad-
 vanced theoretical research to the solution of
 practical  agricultural  and industrial problems.
 Nevertheless, the general trend appears to be
 toward providing a differentiated education for
 qualified students, particularly those with an
 aptitude for high-priority technical fields such as
 science, engineering, medicine, and foreign lan-
 guages.

 Meetings in Moscow
 The Soviet party central committee met for
 two days this week in Moscow to review the
 five-year plan before its final formal adoption by
 the Supreme Soviet. In addition, the central com-
 mittee  heard  a  report  by General Secretary
 Brezhnev on the conduct of foreign policy since
 the 24th Party Congress and made some changes
 in the composition of the party's ruling bodies.
 The plenum went only part way in this regard,
 however, leaving a number of loose ends hanging.
 Most  importantly, Gennady Voronov re-
 tained his seat on the politburo, where he has
 been a lame duck since July when he lost his job
 as premier of the Russian Republic and was re-
 assigned to a relatively insignificant post. Mikhail
 Solomentsev, who replaced Voronov as the Rus-
 sian premier, was elevated by the plenum only to
 candidate  membership,  probably  because  the
 plenum failed to remove Voronov. Solomentsev
 was also released from the party secretariat, but
 no one was named to assume his responsibilities
 for heavy industry on that body.
 Voronov may owe his reprieve partly to the
 efforts of his politburo colleagues to prevent
 Brezhnev from completely dominating the deci-
 sion-making process. Over the years, Brezhnev has
 been able to place a number of supporters in the
 politburo  and   secretariat,    and   has  suc-
 ceeded in maneuvering such critics as Voronov
 and  Shelepin  into  positions of lesser power.
 Despite obvious gains in Brezhnev's authority,
 however, there have been no departures from the
 politburo since the retirements of Mikoyan and
 Shvernik   in  1966.  On  outward  appearance,
 Brezhnev dominated the plenum. Not only did he
 speak on foreign policy, but he summed up the
 "debate" on the economic plan and budget. The
 foreign policy address has not been published, but
 the plenum issued a communique approving it.
 At the Supreme Soviet, which convened on
 24 November, Kosygin took the spotlight by de-
 livering the report on the five-year plan instead of
 planning chief Baybakov. The Supreme Soviet,
 which may last through the 27th, is also expected
 to   adopt  the  annual  plan  and  budget  for
 1972.

 Prime Minister Caetano has received Na-

 combat subversion following recent terrorist
 bombings in the Lisbon area. The police have so
 far failed to apprehend those responsible, and the
 government believes special powers are needed
 because of the difficulty of monitoring and

 Under a new amendment to the constitu-

 without recourse to the as?embly, but he wants to
 bolster the moderate imagge of his regime. By
 moving quickly Caetano will undercut right-wing

 Warsaw Pact Ministers Meet
 A meeting of the pact foreign ministers or
 their deputies is expected to take place in Warsaw
 on X10 November.
 The possibility of the imminent conclusion
 of the inter-German negotiations on Berlin makes
 such a gathering timely. The-Era  GermaaaJ yq.
 acknowledged -privately. that they are under -con-
 si.derable -pressure to wind up the talks, and
 Pravda on 18 November went so far as to mis-
 quote East German party chief Honecker to the
 effect that the German talks "can and must be
 successfully concluded  in November." Pravda
 further argued that it is necessary to begin prep-
 arations in the "very nearest future" for a Confer-
 ence on European Security and Cooperation. The
 Yugoslavia: Unrealistic Planning
 Belgrade's development plan for 1971-75 is
 designed to promote long-run stability, but attain-
 ment of several of its targets is in doubt. The plan
 envisions a reduction in the growth rate (7.5
 percent in real output) and less rapid price and
 wage increases than in recent years. The republics
 and the trade unions will inevitably resist slower
 growth because personal incomes and consump-
 tion Will be affected, while the proposal to limit
 price increases to five percent seems optimistic in
 light of the 14-percent increase so far in 1971.
 Further efforts to retard an increase in the rate of
 domestic consumption will be handicapped not
 only by the indecision of the federal government
 but also by the new governmental structure that
 gives :he republics more independence.
 USSR will probably try to use the expected pact
 meeting to issue a fresh appeal for such prepara-
 tions, in the hope of influencing the NATO minis-
 terial scheduled for 9-10 December.
 The pact foreign ministers may also take up
 the question of mutual force reductions, but Mos-
 cow has thus far attributed little urgency to this
 question. There is no sign that the Soviets and
 their allies have done much work to develop a
 common position. The specter of Romania-hangs
 over any attempt to come to a common bloc
 position. Bucharest has frequently been a thorn in
 the side of its allies at pact conclaves and Ceau-
 sescu's views on mutual force reductions are
 known to be at variance with those of his more
 orthodox colleagues.
 Planners hope to reduce the balance-of-pay-
 ments deficit by stimulating the growth of both
 exports and invisible earnings-particularly from
 tourism and workers' remittances-while restrain-
 ing growth in imports. Although the planned in-
 crease in exports of 11 to 13 percent is not
 unreasonable, much of this increase will probably
 be with CEMA countries, which will not redress
 the large imbalance with hard-currency countries.
 The expected increase in imports of 9 to 11
 percent is far below increments of the past several
 years, except for the recessionary period of
 1966-67. Meanwhile, continued growth in invisi-
 ble earnings is dependent upon a prosperous West-
 ern Europe inasmuch as an economic downturn
 there would reduce the flow of worker remit-

 The Oslo meeting reflects a growing'ware-

 unions have long had offices in Bru   s, their
 influence on EC policies has been. mited and

 munity-wide basis is a long way-  f.
 There are, nevertl Tess, tentative signs that
 some labor unions rye ognize the problems posed
 by such developrnerts as the multinational cor-
 poration. The auto-producing sector of the Inter-
 national  eta workers' Federation, in which the
 American     W participates, some months ago
 singled ox the Ford Motor Company for com-
 mon action in extracting benefits on a world-wide
 scale. ?he aim is to press for labor contracts that
 all t rminate at the same time so as to enable
 unions to try to force coordinated collective bar-
 gaining with Ford as a whole instead of wi hif its
 separate enterprises. This procedure, if suc  ssful,
 may serve as a model for dealing w)           other
 multinational corporations.
 The development of a r Are effective Euro-
 pean labor organization w. P obviously be a long
 and arduous process, no   ly because of the dif-

 Italy the negotiations toward a merger of Com-

 ward a still elusive accord.
 The movement of European unions both
 oward greater unity on a regional basis and to-
 d a relaxation of their traditional anti-Com-
 st stance will further weaken the over-all
 struc ? re of ICFTU. Non-European affiliates have
 steppe   p their attacks on the European dom-
 inance o  ICFTU leadership positions and have
 called for    re equal representation. The possi-
 bility of coo eration with the Communists will
 likely doom a'  possible reconciliation between
 the ICFTU and   -e powerful AFL-CIO. The lat-

 part caused by this ist~e. Thus, as European Iabor25X1

 Burundi: More Loose Ends
 President Micombero has survived a power
 play designed to tie his hands and on 28 Novem-
 ber celebrates his fifth anniversary in power. The
 President may use the occasion to make some
 changes in his government.
 Late last month, Micombero established a
 Supreme Council composed of himself and 27
 army officers in order to meet a challenge from a
 radical faction in the government, which was in-
 tent on isolating him and assuming power. The
 radicals, led by Foreign Minister Simbananiyeand
 Justice Minister Shibura, managed to discredit
 their moderate opponents, charging them with
 plotting against the government and  bringing
 them to trial. The radicals' influence crested in
 mid-October when Simbananiye brought about a
 resumption of diplomatic relations with Peking,
 which had been suspended for six years.
 Since the establishment of the Supreme
 Council, the radicals have been lying low. Led by
 the army commander and chaired by the Presi-
 dent, the council is a throwback to the revolu-
 tionary council that supported Micombero when
 he seized power from Burundi's failing monarchy
 in 1966. The new council has authority over a
 broad range of political and administrative mat-
 ters, includin  the selection of senior government
 officials
 Thus far, Micombero has not moved against
 the radical leaders themselves. Moreover, the trial
 of moderate officials is still going on, although
 the prosecution has failed to come up with per-
 suasive evidence against them and the army is
 skeptical of the charge. Micombero may take the
 opportunity of the celebration of his accession to
 power to announce a cabinet shuffle and perhaps
 even reinstate the moderates.
 Micombero may also announce plans,    -
 ed~~       araJ weeksr, to
 draw up a new constitution to replace the one
 scrapped when he took power and to prepare for
 national elections. For these tasks, Micombero
 will probably rely mainly on the Supreme Council
 rather than on civilian officials, who are badly
 factionalized and incorrigibly addicted to political
 intrigue.

 LIBERIA: The Tolbert administration is review-   eral years, foreigners have repatriated about $50
 ing concession agreements with foreign investors, million annually in investment income.
 beginning with the largest iron mining firm in the
 country, the Liberian-American-Swedish Mining
 Company. The company has $275 million in-
 vested in Liberia and appears willing to accede to
 most of the government's demands. It challenges,
 however, the government's charge that the com-
 pany has understated profits to avoid taxation.
 Like the other three firms in the industry, the
 company pays one half of its net profit in taxes.
 Nevertheless, government revenue from  iron
 mining profits is only 16 percent of total revenue
 even though iron ore accounts for 70 percent of
 export earnings.
 Since taking office, President Tolbert has
 carefully stated that his predecessor's open door
 investment policy would continue but that
 investors would have to provide more jobs for
 Liberians, and Liberia must receive a greater share
 of protits. Employment opportunities for Libe-
 rians have stagnated, and the need for more jobs
 may be a major motive for Tolbert. He also
 recognizes that there is considerable scope for
 increasing government revenue. For the past sev-

 Political Stirrings in Panama
 Now that celebrations marking the third an-
 niversary of the coup which put General Torrijos
 in power and the 68th anniversary of Panamanian
 independence are out of The way, the rhetoric and
 patriotic posturing of October and early Novem-
 ber is giving way to a period of reassessment. The
 focus of government attention remains on the
 canal negotiations, but the regime is also begin-
 ning to work out the mechanics of next year's
 assembly elections. Various pre'sure groups are
 attempting to ascertain the thrusf?pf government
 policy so as to formulate their   in positions.
 Aside from the Communist Party, h-cwever, most
 groups have scant expectation that they will bene-
 fit from any relaxation in the current D
 on political activity.
 Although Panamanian negotiators in Wth;,
 ington last week publicly expressed optimism t
 work on a new treaty could be completed b
 end of the year, at home the government seoFns to
 be hedging its bets, utilizing the media tqy- dimin-
 ish public expectations that agreeme   can be
 won quickly or painlessly. The goviment has
 not begun to stir up anti-US sentim  t or prepare
 the people for the possibility of   monstrations.
 But in a press interview, which   s not circulated
 in Panama, Torrijos warned t  t force might be-
 come necessary to recover th  Canal Zone.
 Panama is makinliplomatic efforts to gain
 support for its negoyating position on the canal,
 and its election toAhe UN Security Council will
 facilitate these ef?Ybrts. Thus far, the Panamanians
 have obtained Xrong public backing from Costa
 Rica and a promise of support from El Salvador,
 but efforts%o gain dramatic public statements of
 support t(om Spain and Mexico have been less
 successful. News services in Communist countries
 have begun to focus on the canal issue and are
 encouraging Panama to be firm.
 On the domest;t front, the government once
 again appears to be experiencing a shortage of
 funds. Efforts t9 advance the "revolution" will
 accordingly reLf; at least in the short run, on
 bureaucratic reforms rather than bold new spend-
 ing program': The regime, for example, is getting
 ready to{.Sromulgate a new labor code. It will
 extend overnment support for collective bargain-
 ing anprovide for compulsory union dues check-
 off.oth labor and business are watching very
 carefully to see whether the new code will include
 fday raise provisions. The business community
 `strongly opposes provisions for payment of an
 extra day's salary each week. Its inclusion would
 signal Torrijos' readiness to move ahead with
 rather  sweeping  social  reforms.  Its exclusion
 would indicate a continued interest in wooing the
 usiness community.
 kfter three years with virtually no political
 activit; a good deal of interest is being given to
 the government's promise of legislative elections
 next year>; Traditional political groups, however,
 probably wijl find themselves frozen out of the
 process. The`,- oting districts are expected to be
 heavily weighfed in favor of small rural constitu-
 encies easily cort`'lolled by the government, which
 will probably organize an official party or elec-
 toral front. The Communist Party, the only polit-
 ical organization  thAt Torrijos has allowed to
 function, probably hopes that it can parley its
 informal relationship with the government into a
 more open and structured relationship in the new
 legislature.

 Honduras: Cruz'Problems Grow
 The stability of the lackluster Cruz admin-
 istration is deteriorating because of a lack of
 leadership and the strain of competing political
 ambitions. A deepening fiscal crisis may be the
 final straw, and the government could be toppled,
 perhaps in a matter of weeks.
 Since Cruz took office last June, practically
 nothing has been done toward implementing even
 the "minimum  plan  of government"  recom-
 mended by business and labor to stimulate invest-
 ment and foreign commerce and to improve the
 planning process. Businessmen gave the first ma-
 jor public indication of dissatisfaction by sending
 a large delegation to Cruz on 11 November to
 protest his inaction on Honduras' many pressing
 problems. Cruz, however, claims that he inherited
 an almost empty treasury and that heavy spend-
 ing by the outgoing government left him only 30
 percent of the budgeted funds to cover seven
 months of the fiscal year. The deficit in 1971 is
 expected to reach some $18 million. The Presi-
 dent has asked congress to approve moderate tax
 increases, but the measure is likely to be watered
 down.
 In addition to the fiscal and economic prob-
 lems, Cruz, who spent his first six months in
 office refereeing a scramble for political jobs, now
 proposes to rock his administrative boat by dis-
 missing three cabinet ministers. One is the min-
 ister of labor, and the fairly strong trade union
 movement is threatening strikes if he goes. Also
 rumored to be on the way out are the ministers of
 finance and economy, both initially forced on
 Cruz by the party machinery. Cruz may decide to
 follow through on these dismissals as a means of
 testing his own strength. He is sure to emerge the
 loser, as he has no power base apart from a
 waning national commitment to the "unity pact"
 that placed him in office. His government has also
 been weakened by the machinations of several
 would-be successors, notably General Oswaldo
 Lopez the chief of the armed forces and a former
 president, and Minister of Government Ricardo
 Zuniga.
 If the Cruz government is not brought down
 by these domestic problems, it is only a matter of
 time before the President's intransigence on for-
 eign policy will necessitate his removal. Honduras'
 most urgent foreign policy need is a settlement
 with El Salvador, and Cruz has curtly rebuffed
 several Salvadoran overtures for negotiation. He
 believes that Honduras has the stronger claim to
 the disputed territory and has stated categorically
 that adjudication by the World Court is the only
 acceptable avenue for settlement.
 25X1
 The most obvious successor to Cruz is Gen-
 eral Lopez, whose eight years of inaction in office
 look good only by comparison with Cruz. ~

 CUBA: The touring Fidel Cas-
 tro has been successfully dem-
 onstrating Cuba's solidarity
 with Chile and improving his
 international image.
 Although he has been re-
 ceived cautiously by a number
 of Chileans,  particularly the
 Communists, the Cuban prime
 minister continues to speak at
 mass meetings, chat with uni-
 versity students,  and  meet
 with  local workers. He has
 been circumspect in his re-
 marks, however, lest he be ac-
 cused of meddling in Chilean
 domestic affairs. Castro has re-
 peatedly stressed the impor-
 tance of unity between Latin
 American countries and the
 strengthening of brotherhood
 and friendship between Cuba
 and Chile. He was even less
 bitter than usual about the US
 base at Guantanamo, saying
 only that Cuba "one day"
 would recover it without a
 shot being fired.
 Castro  has  been  so
 pleased with his sojourn in
 Chile that he reportedly plans
 to extend his visit for a few
 days. His heavy schedule has
 thus far allowed little time for
 him to confer with Allende
 other than on the two-day
 cruise to Punta Arenas last
 week. Castro may wish to talk
 at length with Allende before
 returning  to  Cuba, possibly
 with stops in Peru and Ecua-
 dor.
