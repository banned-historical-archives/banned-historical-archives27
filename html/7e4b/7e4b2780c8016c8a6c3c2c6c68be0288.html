 VIETNAM
 Large allied sweep forces this week made contact with
 Viet Cong units in the northern provinces of Thua
 Thien and Binh Dinh.   The Communists stepped up small-
 unit actions and terrorism on the occasion of two Com-
 munist holidays.   In Saigon,  the Constituent Assembly
 has decided that the constitution should provide for
 a president,  a vice president,  and a prime minister
 .in the executive branch of the future government,  and
 that all local officials should be elected rather than
 appointed.
 ommunists have loosed a flood of propaganda protest-
 ing the bombings in the Hanoi area.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERS  STILL UNDER ATTACK
 Despite intensified attacks by the Red Guards,  Liu
 Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping retain their official
 positions as chief of state and party secretary gen-
 eral.   A series of rallies denouncing early victims
 of the cultural revolution may be designed to bring
 out charges which might implicate Lin and Teng.
 CHINA DOUBLES PETROLEUM OUTPUT
 As a result of an increase in output over the past
 five years, essential imports have been reduced to a
 few additives.   Production from known oilfields should
 keep pace with any foreseeable expansion of the econ-
 omy but would probably not support a large-scale con-
 ventional military action of prolonged duration.

 SOVIET PLAN AND BUDGET FOR 1967

 The NATO ministerial meetings both confirmed France's

 CEYLON'S COALITION GOVERNMENT FACES GROWING OPPOSITION           20
 Prime Minister Senanayake's government, which has
 found it necessary to halve the rice ration,  is also
 in growing political trouble over its failure to cope
 with other economic problems.
 IRAQ PIPELINE DISPUTE SNARLED BY ARAB POLITICS
 The dispute between Syria and the Iraq Petroleum Com-
 pany has taken on political overtones.   Iraq is being
 pressured by Cairo and Damascus to nationalize the
 oil company.
 JORDAN UNDER PRESSURE TO ACCEPT FOREIGN ARAB TROOPS
 The United Arab Command meets on 24 December to dis-
 cuss arrangements,  but King Husayn still hopes to
 avoid the actual entry of these forces.
 ZAMBIA SEEKING COMMUNIST ASSISTANCE
 Zambia is cautiously broadening its relations with
 Communist countries.   Although the government re-
 mains wary of Communist purposes,  the number of Com-
 munist personnel in the country is increasing.
 MOBUTU TIGHTENS SCREWS ON THE BELGIANS
 Relations between the Congolese President and Union
 Miniere are once again tense as his 1 January dead-

 quarters to Kinshasa approaches.   There is a good
 chance of an accommodation unless one or the other
 pushes the dispute beyond the point of compromise.

 FAR EAST
 Hanoi and its Communist supporters abroad are
 seeking to use their allegations about US air at-
 tacks in the Hanoi area to stimulate international
 opposition to US policy. North Vietnam and China,
 however,  avoided any specific threats of reprisals
 or moves to broaden the conflict.   Communist forces
 in South Vietnam continued to avoid major contact
 with large-scale allied operations and to concen-
 trate on small-unit actions and terrorism.   The
 South Vietnamese Constituent Assembly made further
 progress in defining the structure of the future
 government.
 There were no major changes in the Chinese
 leadership struggle.   Although standing committee
 member Tao Chu made the first reported attack by a
 high official on Chief of State Liu Shao-chi and
 party general secretary Teng Hsiao-ping, no offi-
 cial moves have been made to bring them down. There
 is evidence that the "cultural revolution" may be
 disrupting work in vital Chinese scientifir no-
 grams,                                                        de-
 spite central committee warnings against interfer-
 ence with economic and government enterprises.

 Heavy contact between allied
 and Communist forces was reported
 during the week in northern Thua
 Thien and coastal Binh Dinh prov-
 inces as allied sweep operations
 in search of large enemy concentra-
 tions continued throughout South
 Vietnam.   Two Viet Cong holidays
 --National Revolution Day on 19
 December and the anniversary of
 the founding of the National Front
 for the Liberation of South Viet-
 nam  (NFLSVN)  on 20 December--were
 celebrated this week with a flurry
 of small-unit actions coupled with
 terrorism and sabotage in widely
 separated areas.
 In Bins Dine province units
 of  the US  lst Air Cavalry Divi-
 sion killed 131 enemy soldiers
 in three days of fighting.   About
 12 miles northwest of Hue in
 Thua Thien Province,  a battalion-
 strength US Marine task force was
 attacked on 20 December by an
 estimated battalion-size Commu-
 nist force;  during the ensuing
 three-hour battle,  54 enemy sol-
 diers were killed and four cap-
 tured.   In the central highlands
 of Pleiku,  a Communist force am-
 bushed a 30-truck convoy and killed
 15 allied troops.
 Constituent Assembly
 Continues Debate
 The Constituent Assembly con-
 tinued to make headway this week
 Page  3
 in working out the structure of
 the future government.   The depu-
 ties have decided that the execu-
 tive branch will have a vice
 president as well as a popularly
 elected president who will appoint
 a prime minister and a cabinet.
 The prime minister's role will
 be limited to routine administra-
 tive duties, and both the presi-
 dent and the legislature will have
 the power to remove him from of-
 fice.
 Additionally the deputies
 voted in favor of the election
 of local chiefs and councils
 from the province level down to
 the villages.   The question of
 elected province and municipal
 chiefs sparked considerable
 controversy,  since t.-:e officials
 who now run the 44 provinces and
 six autonomous cities are almost
 exclusively appointed military
 officers.   Most of the deputies
 argued that local elections would
 bring the public into the govern-
 ment process, but some Catholic,
 military,  and Dai Viet assembly-
 men who have been close to the
 present regime strongly opposed
 the provision as likely to weaken
 central government authority.
 The deputies reportedly have
 also adopted the principle of an
 elected bicameral legislature,
 and an independent judiciary,

 Yi addressed a Peking rally at.
 which 100,000 people were present,
 and on 20 December People's Daily
 warned that if the US expands the
 war the Chinese "will resolutely
 meet the challenge and go to war."
 This is a variation on Peking's
 standard formulation but does
 not extend earlier Chinese com-
 mitments to send men to Vietnam
 "'if needed," and all Chinese
 statements continue to imply that
 Peking will avoid provocative ac-
 tions.
 In the free world, CorMunist-
 dominated front groups tried to
 organize public demonstrations to
 protest the bombings, and on 17
 December, the Havana-based Tri-
 Continental "anti-imperialist"
 organization  (which claims to rep-
 resent 70 countries in Asia, Af-
 rica,  and Latin America)  called
 for harassment of US embassies
 throughout the world.   Such demon-
 strations have already occurred
 in Algeria and Yugoslavia, per-
 haps independently.   On 20 Decem-
 ber some 300 Algerians marched on
 the US Embassy in Algiers, and
 Yugoslavians   actually damaged
 the US Consulate in Zagreb.         ~ 25X1

 CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERS STILL UNDER ATTACK
 The poster campaign being
 waged in Peking by the Red Guards
 against Chief of State Liu Shao-
 chi and party general secretary
 Teng Hsiao-ping intensified dur-
 ing the past week, but no offi-
 cial public move has yet been
 made against them. Liu signed
 a state message to Kenya on 11
 December,  and on 14 December
 Teng attended the funeral of a
 central committee member.
 The ability of these once-
 powerful leaders of the party
 machinery to keep their official
 positions suggests that divi-
 sions within the current leader-
 ship are still blocking a de-
 cision on what is to be done to
 them.   One group,  apparently in-
 cluding Lin Piao,                        seems to want
 to bring them down in total dis-
 grace.   Another wants to limit
 the charges against them prob-
 ably in an effort to reduce reper-
 cussions inside the party.
 Liu and Teng were criticized
 by the standing committee's Tao
 Chu in an unpublicized speech
 given at a meeting of medical
 workers on 13 December--the first
 reported criticism of them by a
 high official.   According to an
 account carried on a poster, Tao
 criticized them mainly for taking
 a "bourgeois reactionary" line
 during the past seven months, and
 did not mention more serious charges
 raised in indictments by the Red
 Guards.   Tao said that "all the
 regions" had been influenced by
 the "poisonous" Liu-Teng line.
 He did not, however,  indicate
 what action, beyond "criticism,"
 was contemplated against either
 Liu and Teng or errant regional
 officials.
 Meanwhile, a parallel but
 much more intense campaign aimed
 at "further exposing" former
 mayor of Peking Peng Chen and other
 early victims of the cultural rev-
 olution has been picking up speed
 in the capital.   Large rallies
 attended by Premier Chou En-lai,
 Madame Mao, and senior members
 of the central committee's cul-
 tural revolution group, have been
 held almost daily since 12 De-
 cember.   Reports of speeches
 given at these rallies have not
 referred to Liu and Teng, but the
 impression given is that the new
 attacks may bring out charges
 which might implicate them.
 There are continuing signs
 that the authority of party com-
 mittees has been seriously eroded
 by events of recent months,  and
 that this breakdown may be dis-
 rupting work in vital scientific

 Some Chinese leaders, notably
 Chou En-lai, seem to have been
 seriously concerned over damage
 the "cultural revolution"  is do-

 scientific developmental programs.
 On 19 December the central com-
 mittee reportedly issued another
 directive calling for curbs on
 "cultural" agitators who inter-
 fere with the work of economic
 and governmental enterprises.
 Like the many similar injunc-
 tions issued since August, how-

 by a group of activist leaders,
 probably including Mao and Lin,
 who are bent on pushing ahead
 with the "revolution" despite
 its destructive character.F'

 CHINA DOUBLES PETROLEUM OUTPUT
 Communist China's petroleum
 industry has roughly doubled its
 output since 1962 and now is pro-
 ducing enough to meet domestic
 needs at the austerity consump-
 tion levels maintained by the re-
 gime.   Further development of
 known oilfields should keep pace
 with any foreseeable expansion of
 the economy but probably would
 not support. a large-scale conven-
 tional military action of pro-
 longed duration.
 The most important factor
 in raising crude oil production
 to an estimated ten million tons
 in 1966 has been the development
 of the Ta-ching oilfield in Man-
 churia, which began producing in
 commercial quantities in 1963 and
 now accounts for 45 percent of
 total output.   Production gains
 at China's two older major oil-
 fields--at Yumen and Karamai--
 have been less dramatic,  and fu-
 ture increases in crude production
 are expected to come from Ta-ching
 and from the new Shengli oilfield
 in Shantung Province.   The exist-
 ence of the latter was first an-
 nounced in 1966,  and it is not
 expected to produce on a large
 scale until 1968.
 Concurrent development of the
 refining industry has enabled
 China to process the increasing
 amounts of crude and improve the
 quality and variety of the end
 products.   In 1966 it produced
 jet fuel,  the lower grades of
 aviation gasoline, and quality
 lubricants as well as basic prod-
 ucts such as motor gasoline,
 kerosene,  and diesel fuel.
 This rising output,  combined
 with tight controls over consump-
 tion, has brought imports down
 from the all-time high of 3.4 mil-
 lion tons in 1960 to about 300,000
 tons in each of the last two years,
 and much of that was low-grade
 Albanian crude imported for po-
 litical reasons.   Peking's only
 real import need now is for ad-
 ditives to produce some aircraft
 fuels and lubricants.
 It is believed that supplies
 of petroleum were just about ade-
 quate for current consumption
 through 1964.   Since then, the
 Chinese may have been able to set
 aside up to: a million tons in the
 regional bulk storage sites that
 have been built throughout the
 country.
 The achievements of the in-
 dustry in recent years, however,
 have not changed China's status
 as a minor producer and consumer
 of petroleum by world standards.
 Petroleum still contributes less
 than ten percent of its energy con-
 sumption.

 EUROPE
 As the year draws to a close, Soviet leaders
 are still wrestling with economic problems.   An ex-
 cellent harvest was produced this year,                                   but indus-
 trial performance has not measured up and the hard
 economic decisions which may well determine the So-
 viet leaders'  own political futures have clearly
 been made no easier for them.   The Supreme Soviet
 this week approved the plan and budget for 1967
 but was given no further word about the five-year
 plan  (1966-70)  which, with a year of the plan pe-
 riod gone by,  has still not been approved.
 Overshadowing the routine economic business was
 the award of the Soviet Union's highest military
 decoration to Brezhnev on his 60th birthday.   The
 surrounding fanfare fell just short of that accorded
 Khrushchev in similar circumstances and served to
 emphasize Brezhnev's pre-eminence in the present
 leadership.
 In Paris last weekend,  the NATO Council of Min-
 isters concluded their semiannual meeting with a
 minimum of fuss,  carefully skirting the boundary
 line between   France and the other fourteen members.
 They handled military matters in their Defense
 Planning Committee without France and were thus
 able to get some business done.   This included es-
 tablishment of a Nuclear Defense Affairs Committee
 designed to give have-not members more participation
 in planning and deployment.   Nonmilitary matters
 were taken up by the full North Atlantic Council
 which,  among other things, commissioned a major
 review of how the alliance should adapt itself to
 the changed political situation in Europe since its
 founding 17 years ago.
 In Yugoslavia,  the ouster last summer of former
 heir-apparent Rankovic is still causing considerable
 political turmoil. Tito has decided, while he tries
 to put things back in order, not to try Rankovic on
 criminal changes lest this complicate his task.

 SOVIET PLAN AND BUDGET FOR 1967
 The USSR's economic guide-
 lines for 1967 indicate that
 there will be a continuation of
 the regime's economic policy of
 the past several years.   If the
 projected rise of about 6 per-
 cent in gross national product
 is achieved in 1967,  the 1966-
 70 plan will be on schedule.
 Nevertheless,  the drastic under-
 fulfillment of the 1966 plan for
 commissioning of new plant and
 equipment is a harbinger of fu-
 ture difficulties.
 An increase in military ex-
 penditures is foreshadowed by
 a planned 8-percent rise in the
 explicit defense allocation in
 the state budget, although this
 published increase is not con-
 sidered a conclusive indicator.
 However, total outlays for
 "science"--a category believed
 to include space and defense-
 related expenditures--are sched-
 uled to rise by nearly 6.5 per-
 cent.   Also,  the 1967 goals for
 nonmilitary uses of machinery,
 when compared with the increases
 scheduled for over-all machinery
 output,  suggest another boost in
 1967 in the output of hardware
 for military and space programs.
 The regime's intention to im-
 prove consumer welfare next year
 is reflected in the 5.5-percent
 rise planned in per capita real
 income.   Much of the growth in
 consumer welfare will be the
 result of better food supplies,
 reflecting the sharp increase in
 farm output in 1966.   A 15-per-
 cent increase in housing comple-
 tions promised for 1967 will,  if
 fulfilled, be an additional gain
 for the consumer.   Further large
 increases in disposable money
 income scheduled for 1967,  how-
 ever, will add to latent infla-
 tionary pressures now present
 in the USSR.   Growth in personal
 savings,  accelerating in recent
 years,  increased by 23 percent
 in 1966,  and savings are now
 equal to almost one fifth of
 total personal disposable income.
 Although agriculture is
 scheduled to receive increased
 resources next year,  the alloca-
 tion of machinery,  fertilizer
 and other major inputs to agri-
 culture will nevertheless be be-
 low the average annual increases
 called for in the Brezhnev pro-
 gram announced in March 1965.
 The lack of evidence of all-out
 effort to meet the provisions of
 Brezhnev's program may reflect
 an official euphoria in the wake
 of the bumper 1966 harvest and
 a weakening of the original com-
 mitments to the farm sector.
 Industrial production is
 planned to grow by about 7.5
 percent,  the same as that esti-
 mated to have been actually
 achieved in 1966.   Special at-
 tention is to be devoted to
 eliminating long-standing bottle-
 necks in the petroleum industry
 and the shift from coal to oil
 and natural gas will continue.

 After several years of relative
 neglect, renewed emphasis is to
 be placed on the ferrous metals
 industry, which is said to have
 limited the expansion of the ma-
 chinery, oil and natural gas,  and
 construction brances.
 The 1967 plan indicates that
 further implementation of the in-
 dustrial reform program is expected
 to help achieve the planned output
 goals in this sector.   Progress on
 the crucial problen of price re-
 form is explicitly recognized in
 the plan as essential to the
 success of the reform movement.
 Although Finance Minister Garbuzov
 claimed the reforms had been
 instrumental in improving the
 performance of the enterprises
 that converted to the new sys-
 tem during 1966,  the fact that
 no enterprises have been con-
 verted since the beginning of
 the third quarter indicates
 that difficulties have persisted.
 NATC TALKS ESTABLISH TRANSITION GUIDELINES
 The NATO ministerial meet-
 ing in Paris last week marked an
 important transitijn in the life
 of the 17-year-old Alliance.   The
 meetings confirmed France's di-
 vorce from the military and many
 of the institutional arrangements
 of the Alliance,  and the remain-
 ing fourteen members made impor-
 tant decisions affecting the fu-
 ture organization of the common
 defense in recognition of this
 fact.   Moreover, with French ac-
 quiescence,                           they also launched a
 major review of ho,a the Alliance
 should adapt itself to the new
 and fluid political situation in
 Europe resulting particularly
 from France's defection and the
 growing emphasis on East-West de-
 tente.
 The Fourteen,  minus France,
 functioned smoothly in the field
 of defense and all military mat-
 ters in the Alliance will hence-
 forth be considered by them in
 the council-level Defense Plan-
 ning Committee  (DPC); nonmilitary
 issues will be taken up by the
 full North Atlantic Council.   The
 DPC established a Nuclear Defense
 Affairs Committee designed to give
 all its members fuller participa-
 tion in the planning of nuclear
 strategy and deployment.   A sub-
 ordinate seven-member group is to
 work out detailed policy proposals
 for this committee.   The Germans
 did not push for a greater role in
 nuclear planning, although Defense
 Minister Schroeder suggested that
 Germany "be given a special influ-
 ence on the decision for release
 of these weapons."   Ambassador
 Cleveland believes that since the
 Germans no longer appear to be
 pressing for a "hardware" approach
 to nuclear sharing,  the debate on
 this question can now be handled
 systematically by the new commit-
 tee.

 The DPC also approved in
 principle new and improved ar-
 rangements for the exchange of
 communications and information
 in times of diplomatic or mili-
 tary crisis.   It adopted a com-
 mon funding procedure for future
 military exercises   of Allied
 Command, Europe, mobile forces.
 Plans for a NATO communications
 satellite linking SHAPE and sub-
 commands were approved.   Prog-
 ress was made on guidance and im-
 provement of forces relating to
 the flank regions of NATO, es-
 pecially the southeastern area.
 Assisted by the recent tri-
 partite discussions by the UK, the
 US,  and Germany,  the DPC also in-
 itiated a fundamental review of
 NATO strategy as related to forces
 and budgets to be completed early
 in 1968.   Although even without
 the French there will be continu-
 ing disagreements over strategy,
 this thoroughgoing review of mil-
 itary planning concepts could pro-
 duce the Alliance's  first real
 five-year plan.
 France chose not to inter-
 vene in any of the military pro-
 ceedings, nor did it withdraw any
 further on the political side.
 The "boundary line" which has by
 now been largely drawn between
 SECRET
 Page  15     WEEKLY SUMMARY
 France and NATO was not even dis-
 cussed.   Moreover,  France chose
 not to argue whether NATO has a
 role to play in an East-West de-
 tente,  nor whether individual mem-
 bers of the Alliance should try
 to develop a common policy to
 guide their separate approaches
 to Eastern Europe.   This reticence,
 however,  indicates no change in
 France's belief that NATO has no
 real function in such matters.
 Foreign Minister Couve de Murville
 reiterated that Paris remains as
 opposed to political integration
 as it is to military.
 The French also chose not to
 dispute the Italian and Belgian
 proposals  that NATO consider the
 problem of the European technologi-
 cal lag behind the US,  and begin
 a fundamental review of the fu-
 ture tasks of the Alliance.   Paris
 was probably operating on the as-
 sumption that these studies will
 not produce the intended political
 strengthening of the Alliance.
 Other forums such as the OECD may
 eventually take over the techno-
 logical area, and in view of the
 emphasis which the Belgian pro-
 posal places on increasing Euro-
 pean weight in NATO, France may
 exploited to serve French ends.

 YUGOSLAV PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE TO HOLD THIRD PLENUM IN SIX MONTHS
 In the wake of the Rankovic
 affair, the Yugos:!av party's cen-
 tral committee is finding it nec-
 essary to meet again on 26 Decem-
 ber--the third time in six
 months--to attemp'_ to contain
 disruptive trends,
 The sweeping party reorgan-
 ization approved by the central
 committee last Oc,:ober was to
 be only the start of a wider ef-
 fort to decentral:_ze political
 power so that anoi:her Rankcvic
 could not emerge.   Arguments
 have arisen over 1--he party's
 future shape and role,  and sev-
 eral prominent figures have gone
 so far as to urge that an oppo-
 sition be permitted within the
 party.   Despite T:_to's repeated
 rejection of a mu:_tiparty system,
 a polarization of liberal and
 conservative forces has been tak-
 ing place.
 In the absence of authori-
 tative guidance from the party
 Yugoslavia's governmental insti-
 tutions have been assuming more
 of a life of their own.   In early
 December,  for exariple, when one
 house of the Slovenian legisla-
 ture refused to pass a health
 services bill,  the executive
 council  (cabinet) resigned.   Al-
 though the regime s press gen-
 erally lauded these unprecedented
 developments as proof of the
 strength of parliamentary develop-
 opment,  it has also criticized
 the Slovenian cabinet for "acting
 too precipitately."
 Although Tito is essentially
 following a liberal line, he ap-
 parently does not wish to press
 the conservatives at this time.
 His decision on 9 December "to
 pardon from criminal prosecution"
 Pankovic and certain of the lat-
 ter's associates widened this
 approach and avoided making them
 martyrs.   However, Tito's action
 did not rule out future measures
 against Rankovic on new charges,
 should he become a rallying point
 for disgruntled conservatives and
 ultranationalist Serbs.
 The Federal Assembly endorsed
 Tito's decision after debate on
 a government report which criti-
 cized the activities of the in-
 ternal security service  (SDB)  un-
 der Rankovic's direction.   For
 the first time,  the regime offi-
 cially acknowledged that the res-
 idences and offices of Tito and
 several other high-ranking offi-
 cials had been under audiosurveil-
 lance at Rankovic's direct order.
 The report also heavily stressed
 Rankovic's use of his power as
 party organizational secretary
 to place his followers in key
 positions throughout the regime.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The catalogue of headaches--none of them new--
 in South Asia,  the Middle East,  and Africa continues
 to be a long one.
 The Indian Government now appears to have enough
 foreign food  commitments  to get it through January,
 but may still face shortages before elections begin
 on 15 February.   It also faces the possibility of new
 communal violence--from the Sikhs over the status of
 the new state of Punjab and again among the Hindus
 over the slaughter of cows.   In Ceylon,  the government
 is worried over popular reaction to a cut in the rice
 ration caused by shortfalls in foreign deliveries and

 lesser order.
 The Cyprus situation may be further complicated
 by the government crisis in Athens.   The Greek rein
 on Makarios may become even looser, a prospect which
 cannot but disturb the Turks.
 The same Arab problems fester.        The Syrian regime
 is riven by dissension among moderates,  extremists,
 and pro- and anti-Nasirists.   Jordan's Husayn is still
 beleaguered by both internal and external pressures on
 his regime and his country's unity;  another chapter
 opens this weekend when the United Arab Command meets
 to implement the Arab Defense Council's recent decision
 to station Saudi and Iraqi forces in Jordan.   The al-
 ready shaky Iraqi Government is feeling the financial
 impact of the shutdown of the Iraqi Petroleum Company's
 pipeline across Syria.   Anti-Egyptian Yemenis are in-
 creasingly restive under the Egyptian military presence.
 In Africa, Nigerian regional leaders remain at
 loggerheads,  and the Smith regime in Rhodesia is still
 firmly in the saddle.    Although tropical African gov-
 ernments consider Britain committed to effect majority
 rule in Rhodesia before granting independence,  London
 and Salisbury may yet find some compromise formula.
 Congo's Mobutu remains at odds with the Belgians over
 the status of the Union Miniere mining firm and the
 regimes of several mini-states--particularly Togo,
 Dahomey,  and Burundi--face continuing internal dis-
 content.

 CEYLON'S COALITION GOVERNMENT FACING GROWING OPPOSITION
 Ceylon's coalition government
 appears to be losinc momentum at a
 time when unresolvec. economic prob-
 lems are becoming acute political
 issues..   On 18 December,  after a
 lapse of only nine c.ays,   the govern-
 ment found it neces:.ary to reinsti-
 tute a state of emergency as a pre-
 caution against public reaction to
 ,3. cut in the rice rE.tion.
 Prime Minister Senanayake's
 .immediate problem is to find enough
 food at prices Ceylon can afford to
 pay.   Growing reali2 at.ion that in-
 sufficient rice is ELvailable in
 world markets to continue a costly
 rice distribution program finally
 led to a decision on 1.7 December to
 cut the ration in hzLlf.   Normally
 about one million tons of rice,  sub-
 sidized by the government, have
 been distributed annually,  about
 half of it imported.   Although two
 major suppliers,  Corununist China
 and Thailand, will provide their
 normal quantities in 1967, Burma
 has defaulted on scheduled December
 deliveries and next year will supply
 only half of its usual. 200,000 tons.
 There is little prospect that
 Senanavake will be able to find
 other sources;  a cr:.tical shortage
 of foreign exchange prohibits him
 from raising the ante in world com-
 Petition for scarce rice exports.
 Senanayake fea:-s a repetition
 of the civil disorder which toppled
 his government after- it cut rice
 rations in 1953.   Ho has attempted
 to lessen the impac-: by announcing
 that the remaining :rice ration will
 be distributed free and has launched
 a campaign to expla._n the govern-
 ment's position. The state of emer-
 gency gives him extensive powers to
 quell disorder and silence his
 leftist critics.   No disturbances
 have been reported thus far, but
 armed police are patrolling Colombo
 --prepared, with military assist-
 ance,  to put down any violence.
 The government's inability to
 cope with unemployment,  the high
 cost of living,  and shortages of
 consumer goods had already begun
 to pay political dividends to the
 leftist opposition and to sow dis-
 illusionment in Senanayake's own
 United National Party.   There is
 also some resentment against the
 Federal Party--a communal party of
 the minority Tamils, which is a
 key member of the governing coali-
 tion.
 Meanwhile,  the leftist oppo-
 sition--led by former prime minis-
 ter Mrs. Bandaranaike, working
 with Communists and Trotskyites--
 has been emboldened by its sweep
 of three by-elections last October
 in which economic issues and commu-
 nal appeals were decisive factors.
 Though subject itself to internal
 strains,  the opposition is enthu-
 siastically laying plans for labor
 agitation and for contestinq sev-
 eral other by-elections early next
 year. Mrs.  Bandaranaike has called
 on the public not to create ten-
 sion over the rice crisis, but
 will probably benefit from any
 widespread dissatisfaction.

 IRAQ PIPELINE DISPUTE SNARLED BY ARAB POLITICS
 The dispute between Syria
 and the Iraq Petroleum Company
 (IPC) over pipeline fees, which
 led to a shutdown of the line
 across Syria, has developed into
 more of a political question
 than an economic one.
 Syrian demands for increased
 transit fees and a back payment
 of about $100 million for alleged
 underpayments by IPC from 1955
 to 1965 have faded into the back-
 ground,                          and radical Arab national-
 ist elements in Syria, Egypt,  and
 Iraq are pressing increasingly
 for Iraqi nationalization of IPC.
 Egyptian and Syrian propaganda
 organs are carrying on an insist-
 ent  campaign  for nationaliza-
 tion, while Iraqi Prime Minister
 Talib threatens the oil company
 with demands for oil royalties,
 whether or not the pipeline op-
 erates?
 On the other hand,  Iraqi
 President Arif,  at first taken
 in by Talib's conviction that
 the West cannot replace Iraqi
 oil, now is worried over the eco-
 nomic consequences of the pipe-
 line shutdown.                       This threatens
 to stop nearly 70 percent of the
 country's oil revenues,  totaling
 about $350 million annually.
 Arif, however,  is restrained from
 dismissing Talib by the fact that
 the prime minister's position on
 the oil dispute is a popular one.
 His dismissal over the issue
 would make Arif a target of rad-
 ical Arab nationalists within
 and without Iraq.
 IPC's British and American
 parent companies have switched
 to oil from southern Iraq and
 the Persian Gulf.   Their French
 partner,  Compagnie des Petroles
 Francaise  (CFP), has contracted
 for some Soviet oil to tide it
 over the next few weeks,  and its
 other needs will be taken care
 of by American companies.   CFP
 so far is standing with its part-
 ners and has spurned a Syrian
 offer for deliveries from the
 pipeline, but is caving in on
 the Syrian demands for increased
 transit fees.
 The Syrians have rejected
 a company offer to put $10.3 mil-
 lion in escrow pending arbitra-
 tion of the dispute under the
 terms of the 1955 IPC-Syrian oil
 transit agreement.
 The Soviets, who have taken
 a very reserved attitude toward
 the Syrian action, may be discom-
 fited by Syrian and Iraqi claims
 that the Soviet bloc would step
 in and buy Iraqi oil if the pipe-
 line dispute is not resolved.

 JORDAN UNDER PRESSURE TO ACCEPT FOREIGN ARAB TROOPS
 Jordan will again confront
 its radical Arab neighbors on the
 issue of stationing foreign Arab
 troops on its territory at a
 meeting in Cairo of the United
 Arab Command scheduled for 24
 December.   The meeting has been
 called to arrange the entry of
 Iraqi and Saudi troops into Jor-
 dan in accordance with the Arab
 Defense Council's decision of 10
 December.   These forces are sup-
 posed to move in by 10 February.
 King Husayn felt compelled
 to agree to the defense council's
 decision but hopes to avoid the
 actual entry of the foreign Arab
 forces.   The issue is a critical
 one.   Ever since Israelis large-
 scale raid into west Jordan on
 13i November, the King has been
 under strong pressure from within
 Jordan as well as from the radi-
 cal Arab states to strengthen de-
 tenses along the Israeli border.
 Husayn may decide to accept
 the Iraqi and Saudi troops in
 order to appease his internal
 and external opponents,  and to
 take some of the steam out of
 the propaganda against him emanat-
 ing from Damascus  and Cairo.   His
 refusal, on the other hand, would
 intensify the verbal onslaught
 from these capitals,  and probably
 would stimulate new agitation in
 Palestinian west Jordan.   The
 King's most radical enemies,  in-
 cluding the Palestine Liberation
 Organization  (PLO),  are unlikely
 to be deterred from their efforts
 to bring him down no matter which
 course he chooses.
 Iraqi troops have taken posi-
 tions near the Jordanian border
 in preparation for entering Jor-
 dan,                                                                         Iraqi Defense Minister Shukri
 said last weekend.  He also stressed
 that Iraq supports the entry into
 Jordan of the PLO's "army."   Jordan
 refused to accept the PLO forces
 at the Arab Defense Council meet-
 ing and almost certainly will ad-
 here to that position.

 ZAMBIA SEEKING COMMUNIST ASSISTANCE
 Zambia is moving cautiously
 to broaden its relations with Com-
 munist countries.
 Zambia is short of qualified
 technicians to carry out its bur-
 geoning development program, and
 this, combined with Zambian dis-
 trust of resident expatriates from
 Rhodesia, South Africa, and the
 UK makes the government receptive
 to Communist assistance.   More-
 over, the Zambian Government's
 irritation at major Western coun-
 tries which refuse to break com-
 mercial ties with Rhodesia is
 causing it to turn increasingly
 to lesser Western powers and the
 Communists.   For example,  it has
 begun to sponsor secondary and
 university education in the USSR
 and Poland, and has accepted a
 group of some 80 Yugoslav road
 construction technicians.
 Since mid-1966,  Zambia has
 established diplomatic relations
 with Poland and Hungary and has
 exchanged several trade and cul-
 tural missions with Communist
 countries.   President Kaunda in-
 cluded China and the USSR in his
 official world tour last August.
 It also appears that a series
 of preliminary trade and aid dis-
 cussions begun in mid-October will
 result in Soviet technical help
 to Zambia--probably to develop
 roads, rural electrical power,
 and university-level education.
 Fthe two
 countries probably have also
 agreed to expand the almost non-
 existent trade between them.   It
 is most likely that this would in-
 volve an exchange of Zambian cop-
 per for Soviet construction equip-
 ment or manufactured goods to be
 used in development projects. A
 Chinese offer of economic assist-
 ance is under consideration.
 Even though it has supported
 some Communist positions--defend-
 ing Chinese nuclear testing, for
 example--Kaunda's government has
 been suspicious of Communist mo-
 tives and is determined to avoid
 introducing the East-West ideo-
 logical struggle into volatile
 southern Africa.   Furthermore,
 even the most militant Zambian
 leaders do not wish to alienate
 the Western powers, who in their
 eyes, hold the key to any realis-
 tic chance for bringing majority
 rule to southern Africa.   Despite
 this wariness, the Zambians'  sus-
 ceptibility in certain respects
 to Communist pressures may bring
 them new problems.
 Recently the Soviets were
 able to circumvent strict Zambian
 limitations on the number of for-
 eign diplomatic personnel assigned
 to Lusaka by insisting on and ob-
 taining permission to post there
 some 25 "couriers."   Their presence
 in Lusaka and that of Communist
 technicians in the countryside will
 increase opportunities for Commu-
 nist contacts with the many Zam-
 bian-based African nationalist
 groups and refugees and with local
 Zambian groups who are disgruntled

 firm's extensive holdings outside
 the Congo would have been con-
 trolled by a Brussels-based com-
 pany,  in which Mobutu's government
 would. retain its present holdings
 of about 17 percent.
 Union Miniere actually se-
 cured Mobutu's tentative agree-
 ment to this arrangement, but he
 broke off talks just before the
 agreement was to have been signed
 and reverted to his demand that
 the entire company move its head-
 quarters to Kinshasa.   The last-
 minute snag arose over the rate
 at which the profits of the pro-
 spective Congo-based company could
 be repatriated to Belgium and over
 the ownership of minerals already
 into the mining region in Sud-
 Katanga Province.   This ostensibly
 is to protect the region against
 an alleged plot by former premier
 Tshombe, but Mobutu quite clearly
 is also reminding the company that
 its personnel and investments in
 the Congo can be used as hostages.
 Previous confrontations be-
 tween the Congolese President and
 Union Miniere have had in them a
 large element of brinksmanship,
 and there is a good chance that
 the two sides will reach an ac-
 commodation before the deadline.
 Nevertheless, their mutual dis-
 trust is genuine,  and either may
 push the other into a position in
 which compromise is impossible.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Border disputes have come into the spotlight in
 Latin America with new developments in three long-
 standing bilateral quarrels over territory.   Many
 other similar disputes in the area continue dormant.
 Although they seldom blow up into serious military
 confrontations,  they frequently have a highly impor-
 tant effect on both bilateral and multilateral rela-
 tions.
 Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham is becom-
 ing increasingly disturbed over Venezuela's responses
 to Guyana's efforts to take the sting out of a quar-
 rel over ownership of a small river island on the
 border.   Venezuelan officials claim heatedly that
 Ankoko Island is and always has been occupied by
 Venezuela and they appear to be hardening their posi-
 tion against any concession to Burnham on the matter.
 The impasse, should it last much longer, could in-
 crease the possibility of a shooting incident.   It
 might also lead Burnham to seek relief in the UN Se-
 curity Council
 The attendance of Peru or Ecuador at any of sev-
 eral coming inter-American meetings may be jeopardized
 by the emergence of a new round in the old border
 dispute between those two countries.   In view of re-
 cent Ecuadorean statements, Peru has asked the guar-
 antor powers--Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the US--of
 the 1942 protocol establishing the present boundary
 to issue a statement reaffirming the validity of the
 protocol.   The guarantor powers are discussing the
 request under full realization that making such a
 statement would inflame Ecuadorean emotions while
 remaining silent would offend the Peruvians.
 An old Chilean-Argentine quarrel over the owner-
 ship of some 230 square miles of territory in the
 southern Andean highlands near Palena, Chile, was of-
 ficially resolved by a British arbitral settlement
 announced on 14 December.   The award gives Argentina
 most of the territory and Chile most of the usable

 STRIKE THREATENS CHILEAN GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC PROGRAM
 Chile's public health workers
 are. now in the third week of an il-
 lectal strike for wage rises higher
 than are offered them under the
 government's wage readjustment pro-
 gram.   The government is determined
 not to exceed its offer of a 20-
 percent increase.   Failure to main-
 tain this position would deal a
 severe blow to the government's
 economic stabilization policy,  and
 would hamper other measures aimed
 at stemming inflation.   Several
 smaller sympathy strikes have been
 called, but there  is  as yet no ma-
 -                 tie-up.
 Unless the strike is settled
 soon,  growing public indignation
 and  the health hazard may force
 the government to take drastic meas-
 ures.   President Frei has alerted
 the army to be reac.y to deal with
 any disorders.   Several deaths are
 attributed to the  .ack of medical
 Services.   Frei is under some pres-
 sure to use the array to run the
 hospitals, but is reluctant to
 do so.
 The public health workers are
 among the lowest paid government
 employees,  and there is consider-
 able sympathy for their position
 both within and outside the govern-
 ment.   They appear to have strong
 backing from the Communist-Social-
 ist labor central  (CUTCh).   The
 Communists
 have seized on the
 issue to embarrass the government
 and to criticize the over-all eco-
 nomic program.
 VENEZUELI\N-GUYANESE BORDER DISPUTE BECOMING MORE HEATED
 The dispute between Venezuela
 and Guyana over ownership of small
 Ankoko Island is becoming increas-
 ingly thorny.   The inability of
 the parties to agree on the proper
 forum in which to discuss a solu-
 tion  is  the latest difficulty.
 The Venezuelans insist that
 any discussions be held in the

 earlier claim to same 60 percent
 of Guyana.   They maintain that An-
 koko was always theirs and that be-
 cause Guyana is asserting a new
 claim,  it must be discussed in the
 joint commission.
 The Guyanese maintain that by
 setting up a base on the island in
 October, Venezuela violated an
 agreement to maintain the terri-
 torial status quo until the commis-
 sion made its final report.   As

 VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WINS ROUND AGAINST TERRORISTS
 The Venezuelan public seems
 to have approved the government's
 measures to curb terrorist action
 in Caracas, and the terrorists
 have so far been unable to react.
 More than a week has passed
 since the suspension of constitu-
 tional guarantees and the occupa-
 tion of  Central  University.   The
 lack of adverse reaction and the
 failure of the Communists to re-
 taliate leave the government in a
 strong position to continue its
 antiterrorist campaign.
 The government, having yielded
 to military pressure for decisive
 action against the terrorists,  is
 in a difficult position vis-a-vis
 the military.   If it gives the of-
 ficers free rein in an anti-Com-
 munist campaign,  further encroach-
 ment on civilian prerogatives is
 possible.   The public can be ex-
 pected to react unfavorably if
 it appears that the military are
 exercising undue influence on
 the government.   On the other
 hand,  the military are likely to
 resist firmly any relaxation of
 the government's present strong
 stand against the terrorists or
 any too-hasty move by the govern-
 ment to reassert its authority
 over the military.
 Failure of the terrorists
 to react immediately does not
 necessarily mean that their
 organization in Caracas has been
 crippled.   Furthermore, the Com-
 munists remain a threat elsewhere
 in the country,  since military
 operations this year against re-
 newed guerrilla activity have
 not yielded significant results.
