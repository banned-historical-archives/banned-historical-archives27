 HIGHLIGHTS
 Despite press stories that Buddhist monk Tri
 Quang is near death, he was well enough on 2 Sep-
 tember to hold a three-and-a-half hour conversa-
 tion with a US official.  Tri Quang was able to
 walk at that meeting, and the official felt that
 he did not appear likely to die in the near fu-
 ture from his fasting.
 I.   The Military Situation in South Vietnam:
 A 20-minute VC mortar attack on the 1st Air Cav-
 alry Division's Camp Radcliff killed four and
 wounded 61 while hitting 77 helicopters (Para. 1).
 Activity in I Corps was highlighted by an engage-
 ment during Operation MACON  (Paras.  2-3).   II
 Corps was fairly quiet over the weekend (Paras.
 4-5).   US forces in Operation TOLEDO have uncov-
 ered numerous base camps in III Corps area (Paras.
 6-7).   A major battle was fought in IV Corps
 over the weekend resulting in some 276 Viet Cong
 killed in action  (Paras.  8-9).   VC are reported
 planning to infiltrate Tan Son Nhut Airfield
 (Para.-10).   A major arms cache in Da Nang has
 been uncovered (Para.  11).   The recently de-
 fected Viet Cong                         has reported
 on friction in the ranks o    the Vietnamese Commu-
 nists  (Paras.  12-13).
 II.   Political Developments in South Vietnam:

 ments highlight the problems of leadership which
 remain unresolved  (Paras.  4-5).   Thich Tri Quang's
 health and resolve to live are still in question,
 although he was reported quite strong on 2 Sep-
 tember  (Paras.  6-9).                                The constitutional assembly
 elections,  less than a week away, will have a base
 of 5,288,512 registered voters upon which to draw

 I.   MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 1.   Viet Cong forces on 3 September launched
 a 20-minute mortar attack against the 1st Air Cavalry
 Division's Camp Radcliff near An Khe in the central
 highlands.        Four US soldiers were killed and 61
 wounded by the barrage.   In addition,  77 helicopters
 were hit.   Five were destroyed and 61 damaged. Forty-
 three of the damaged choppers will reguire a week
 or more of maintenance.   The remaining 11 are con-
 sidered flyable.                                 A reaction force dispatched after
 the attack was unable to find the attackers.
 I Corps Activity
 2.   The only significant activity in I Corps
 over the weekend occurred on 3 September during the
 conduct of Operation MACON.   An aerial observer
 spotted some 50 Viet Cong in an area about 18 miles
 southwest of Da Nang.   Artillery and air strikes
 were called in to support a US Marine battalion
 which was pursuing the VC.   Results of this engage-
 ment were one marine killed and 18 wounded, as
 against Viet Cong casualties of 32 killed.   The
 cumulative results of Operation MACON to date are
 315 Viet Cong killed and 3 captured while US casual-
 ties stand at 19 killed and 73 wounded.
 3.   Three other major operations--PRAIRIE,
 PAWNEE  (US)  and POLE STAR (ROK)--continued without
 significant contact.   In addition,  a new operation,
 nicknamed EL PASO/LIEN KET 56, began on 4 September
 in an area centering about 39 miles south southeast
 of Da Nang.   This search-and-destroy operation has
 a total of five battalions committed--two US and
 three South Vietnamese.
 II Corps Activity
 4.   II Corps remained fairly quiet over the
 weekend with only one significant engagement re-
 ported on 2 September.   Contact on that date in Op-
 eration JOHN PAUL JONES resulted in 20 Viet Cong

 killed, one captured and 83 suspects detained.   Two
 US soldiers were reported killed.   Cumulative re-
 sults of this operation which began on 21 July and
 terminated on 4 September now stand at 20 US killed
 and 118 wounded.   Enemy casualties total 262 killed,
 41 captured and 391 suspects detained.   In addition,
 some 90 crew-served and individual weapons have been
 captured.
 5.   Two other major operations under way in II
 Corps--PAUL REVERE  III and SU BOK  (ROK)--continued
 without significant contact.   A new Operation, nick-
 named SEWARD, began on 4 September in the same gen-
 eral area as JOHN PAUL JONES.   Operation SEWARD has
 the mission of protecting the rice harvest in an
 area about 20 miles in depth along the coast from
 about 30 miles north to about 25 miles south of Tuy
 Hoa.   Four US battalions will participate under the
 control of the 101st Airborne Division's 1st Brigade.
 Two North Vietnamese regiments--the 18B and the 95th
 --and a Viet Cong battalion are reported to be in
 the area with an estimated troop strength of about
 4,400 men.   The only other significant activity con-
 cerned elements of the 101st Airborne Division who
 were providing security for a South Korean base under
 construction.   These forces engaged an unknown size
 enemy force some 19 miles north of Nha Trang, kill-
 ing some 27 Viet Cong and  capturing  27 others.   US
 casualties were four killed and 15 wounded.
 III Corps Activity
 6.   In Operation TOLEDO,  elements of the US
 173rd Airborne Brigade uncovered five base camps
 with numerous trenches,  foxholes and bunkers in a
 post-B-52 strike about 35 miles east southeast of
 Saigon.        Thus far, no enemy resistance has material-
 ized.   A quantity of weapons,                                    food, radios and am-
 munition has been captured.   Cumulative casualties
 for TOLEDO to date stand at six US soldiers killed
 and 35 wounded while enemy losses total 11 killed,
 ten captured and 24 suspects detained.
 7.   Two new operations have begun in III Corps
 areas.   One search-and-destroy operation, nicknamed

 BATON ROUGE, began on 3 September about 23 miles
 Southeast of Saigon.   The two battalions are search-
 ing for an enemy amphibious engineer battalion num-
 bering some 400 men which is reported to be in the
 area.   The other new search-and-destroy operation--
 KIPAPA--began on 30 August and was expanded on 4
 September to three battalions.   This operation is
 emphasizing the location and destruction of tunnels
 and fortifications in an area centered some 24 miles
 northwest of Saigon.
 IV Corps Activity
 8.   One major battle was reported on 3 Septem-
 ber when ARVN troops in Operation DAN CHI 261 engaged
 an estimated Viet Cong battalion about 140 miles
 southwest of Saigon.   Results of this engagement
 were 18 ARVN killed and 91 wounded.   The Viet Cong
 lost 276 killed  (body count),  11 captured and 86
 individual and crew-served weapons captured.   Cumu-
 lative results to date for Operation DAN CHI 261
 now stand at 18 ARVN killed and 91 wounded while
 Viet Cong casualties total 360 killed and 26 cap-
 tured.   Some 12 tons of arms and ammunition have
 also been captured, including 178 individual and
 crew-served weapons.
 9.   In Dinh Tuong Province on 4 September, ele-
 ments of the ARVN 7th Division conducting Operation
 CUU LONG 23/12 made contact with an estimated pla-
 toon to company sized VC force.   Results of the en-
 gagement were one ARVN soldier wounded while 29 VC
 were killed and three VC suspects taken.
 Reported Threat to Tan Son Nhut Airfield
 10.   Two armed Viet Cong were apprehended by
 ARVN intelligence near Tan Son Nhut Air Base on 2
 September.   The captives stated they were from the
 Viet Cong D-30 unit and that two platoons of some
 60 Viet Cong, armed with mortars and grenade
 launchers, were planning to infiltrate the Tan Son,
 Nhut area in three-man teams.

 Friction Reported Among Vietnamese Communists
 Icontirmed that there  is friction within
 the ranks of the Vietnamese Communists.   For the most
 part, this friction stems from the fact that the
 North Vietnamese cadre were aggressive and disci-
 plined whereas the South Vietnamese Communists were
 lazy.
 13.  I                   Inative South Vietnamese Com-
 munist cadre who had gone to North Vietnam in 1954
 and had infiltrated back into the south are now regi-
 mental, divisional,  and COSVN cadre.   However,  since
 their combat experience in the war against France
 had been limited to squad or platoon level leader-
 ship, they were unqualified for their assignments.
 if all North Viet-
 namese cadre were withdrawn from South Vietnam, the
 Communists would have to return to guerrilla warfare.
 However, even if North Vietnam withdrew its cadre,
 the South Vietnamese Com-
 munists would continue to fight,                                            "because they have
 no choice."

 II.   POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 1.   Elections for the constituent national as-
 sembly are less than a week off and continue to
 dominate most aspects of political life in the ur-
 ban areas.   Rural dwellers are also feeling elec-
 tibn pressure, but primarily from the Viet Cong,
 who are increasingly stepping up their previously
 announced physical as well as political opposition
 to the election process.

 fasting in a private clinic, Thich Tam Chau on "sick
 leave," and Thich Thien Minh mending from his grenade
 incident,  the former deputy chairmen, Thich Thien Hoa
 and Thich Phap Tri, have not effectively filled the
 leadership void.   Phap Tri, the Institute representa-
 tive                      to         the antielection "Front of All Religions,"
 was quoted during an interview with a Vietnamese cor-
 respondent as hoping that a reconciliation with the
 government would allow the Institute to participate
 in the elections.
 5.         In another interview on 4 September, Thien
 Hoa is reported to have lashed out at the United States
 and the "dictatorial junta." Without clarifying the In-
 stitute position on the elections, Hoa claimed that
 two thirds of the candidates were backed by the mili-
 tary. He compared recent government actions--such as
 the arrest and detention of thousands of lay and cler-
 ical Buddhists and statements by GVN leaders on invad-
 ing North Vietnam--to those of Hitler. Hoa claimed that
 the "ambitious tactics" of the Americans were turning
 more South Vietnamese people into Viet Cong. Hoa also
 labeled the Ky-Thieu government as a "puppet" of the
 Americans.
 Thich Tri Quang
 6.   Assessments of Tri Quang's health and the
 degree of his intractability over the last few days
 vary as they have throughout the period of his fast,
 which began on 8 June. According to a press account of
 5 September, he might cease his hunger strike soon at
 the request of the monks who initially approved it.
 This possibility, however, has been discounted in the
 latest official reports from Saigon.
 7.   A US official who held a three-and-a-half
 hour conversation with Tri Quang on 2 September found
 him still sustaining himself on fortified liquids and
 strong enough to walk. During the course of the talk,
 Tri Quang reiterated the pitch he made during the early
 days of the "struggle movement" in Hue for US support.
 He specifically asked for the replacement of Ky and
 Thieu with a provisional government,  in exchange for the
 all-out support of the Buddhists and the Front of All
 Religions for the elections.

 8.   Tri Quang said that he had no desire to
 die but that he was willing to do so if US policy
 did not change.   The US official felt that Tri
 Quang did not appear likely to die in the near
 future from the effects of his fast.   However, the
 official believed that the possibility of the
 monk's self-imposed death did exist if he
 should reach the point where he felt his death as

 10.   The final tally of persons registered to
 vote next Sunday is 5,288,512, which represents a

 government's Special Commissariat for Administra-
 tion.

 12.   Government tactics to lessen interference
 with the electoral process were reinforced on 29
 August by the issuance of an amended decree law.
 Persons found guilty of interfering with the right
 to vote will be sentenced to a prison term or to
 hard labor.   General Linh Quang Vien, the minister
 of security,  in a televised interview on 3 Septem-
 ber, outlined the GVN precautions that will be
 taken to safeguard the voters.   According to a
 press report, he also empowered province, village,
 and hamlet chiefs to replace voter registration
 cards that had been stolen by the Viet Cong.
 13.   According to a US Embassy report, there
 have already been hundreds of incidents of Viet Cong
 terrorism directed against the elections.   The em-
 bassy cited several instances of polling places
 that have been bombed.   In Binh Duong province,  for
 example, a group of Viet Cong exploded a mine in a
 voting office after they had requested information
 on voting procedures.   Eight Vietnamese were wounded.

 III. MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS IN NORTH VIETNAM
 1.   US aircraft flew over 1,200 sorties against
 targets in North Vietnam over the weekend.   Pri-
 mary emphasis was placed on POL targets and return-
 ing pilots reported many secondary explosions and
 large fires. In addition, at least two surface-to-
 air missile sites were reported destroyed or
 heavily damaged.
 2.   Six US aircraft were lost during this pe-
 riod, one to a SAM, three by ground fire and two
 to unknown causes.  These included four Air Force
 F-105s and an F-4C as well as a Navy F-8E.  Two of
 the seven crew members involved in these losses
 were rescued, two were apparently killed when the
 F-4C was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile
 and the remainder are listed as missing in action.

 IV.   OTHER COMMUNIST MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS
 1.   On 5 September Communist China charged
 that US jets sank a Chinese coastal freighter and
 damaged another in the Gulf of Tonkin on 29 Au-
 gust.   Peking radio claimed that nine crew mem-
 bers were killed and seven others wounded in the
 attack.       The Chinese protest concluded with the
 standard threat that the "blood debt must be
 paid in blood," and that the Chinese people,
 "armed with the thought of Mao Tse-tung, abso-
 lutely will not permit US imperialism to carry
 out any unscrupulous act."   It also repeated the
 usual warning that "if US imperialism dares to
 impose war upon us," the Chinese will "completely
 wipe them out."
 2.   Chinese Communist coastal freighters
 move in substantial numbers between North Vietnam
 and south China ports, carrying much needed sup-
 plies to the Vietnamese.  Many of them are armed,
 and they frequently fire at US aircraft.   Peking's
 tardy response to the alleged incident reflects
 the pro forma character of these Chinese com-
 plaints.

 New Communist Aid for North Vietnam
 6.   Hanoi now has concluded new economic aid
 pacts with both Peking and Pyongyang.  The North
 Vietnamese mission led by Le Thanh Nghi signed two
 economic pacts with North Korea prior to its de-
 parture on 4 September.   One agreement covers the
 delivery of North Korean grant aid, the other an
 arrangement governing trade exchanges during 1967.
 7.   The aid talks in North Korea followed the
 conclusion of similar discussions in Peking last
 week, at which time China agreed to put assistance
 to North Vietnam on a grant basis.   The Nghi mis-
 sion arrived in Moscow on 5 September,  its first
 stop on a tour of the Eastern European capitals,
 according to a Moscow press announcement.
 8.   The switch to grant aid reflects Commu-
 nist recognition of the inability of Hanoi to fi-
 nance its growing need for economic and military

 aid materials.   It is likely the aid agreements
 also encompass deliveries formerly made under
 trade pacts.   The inflow of bloc goods has grown
 during the past 18 months,but the decline in North
 Vietnamese exports is likely to become more se-
 vere as the North Vietnamese economy deteriorates.
 9.   The composition of aid also will change
 this year.   Agreements in 1965 reflected stepped
 up assistance for North Vietnam's economic devel-
 opment plan, but the program is being de-emphasized
 as Hanoi increases resources devoted to reconstruc-
 tion, rehabilitation,  and maintenance of essential
 economic output and services.
