 THE CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP AND THE SUCCESSION PROBLEM
 The men who rule Communist China are all first-
 generation, old-guard party revolutionaries.  These
 senior citizens are beginning to lose their vigor
 at a time when their responsibility for finding so-
 lutions to China's intractable problems is especially
 heavy. Most of the 18 members of the politburo--
 the party's elite ruling body--are in their 60s or
 70s, and all have been with the party at least 30
 years.  Most served together as political commissars
 or military commanders during the wars against Ja-
 pan and the Nationalist government.  All are intensely
 nationalistic and appear deeply committed to a mili-
 tant brand of Communism, but some seem to take a
 somewhat more moderate approach to particular prob-
 lems.
 Leadership differences in themselves do not
 appear great enough to spark a struggle for power
 when Mao Tse-tung dies or retires fully.  Even so,
 because no other leader has anything like Mao's
 stature and prestige, the removal of his unifying
 influence could introduce a period of disorder
 marked by debilitating purges.  The regime is deeply
 concerned about the succession problem, because Mao
 --who was 70 on 26 December 1963--has weakened both
 mentally and physically in recent years.
 Mao's designated successor &s Liu Shao-chi,
 who has already assumed the top position in the
 government--but not in the party.  After Liu, the
 line of succession apparently runs to Secretary
 General Teng Hsiao-ping, a member of the radical
 group which controls the party apparatus--the main
 instrument of power in Communist China.
 What little is known about second-echelon
 leaders who fill top posts in the bureaucracy just
 below the politburo suggests that they are probably
 just as dedicated and extreme as their superiors.
 Their core is a group, reportedly numbering 800,
 who participated in the Long March 30 years ago
 when Mao was driven from his base of operations in
 Central China to Yenan in the Northwest.  Most of
 these men, who were junior officers then, now are
 their late 40s and 50s.
 second-echelon leaders,
 subject throng ou     eir careers to indoctrination
 and strict party discipline, have been even more
 insulated from contact with the outside world than
 the men at the top.

 Leadership Stability
 Peiping is proud of the
 leadership's record of compava-
 tive stability.   It has inti-
 mated that, because of this rec-
 ord ,                    China is better qualified
 than the USSR to lead the world
 Communist movement.  Mao Tse-
 Tung                      the undisputed leader of
 the Chinese Communist Party
 (CCP) since 1935, was a charter
 member of the party when it was
 formed in 1921.   Liu Shao-chi
 and Chou En-lai have held posi-
 tions of trust since the mid-
 1920s.  Teng Hsiao-ping, fourth
 in the present hierarchy, is a
 relative newcomer.   He came to

 Standing Committee, labeled "Moo's Close Comrades-in-Arms. " From left to right, party

 the fore in the 1930s and reached
 the Standing Committee--the super-
 politburo--in 1956.
 While the turnover in top
 positions has indeed been small,
 the Chinese try to make it appear
 even smaller by the simple device
 of not dropping inactive members
 from the politburo except when
 they die.   Several are inactive
 because they are old, sick, or
 out of favor.  Nevertheless, even
 former Minister of National De-
 fense Peng Te-huai, who was dis-
 missed from his post in 1959 and
 who is obviously in disgrace, is
 still listed as a member.

 SECRET
 Another remarkable attri-
 bute of top Chinese leaders,
 besides their long continuity
 of service, is their ability to
 present a united front in the
 face of internal and external
 problems.   In part, this trait
 reflects the care with which
 Mao has always selected subor-
 dinates, but it is also a trib-
 ute to his ability to inspire
 loyalty.   In the past 25 years,
 only three members of the real
 inner circle (Mao's closest
 lieutenants) have been removed
 from positions of influence.
 These are Kao Kang, purged in
 1953, and Peng Te-huai and top
 economic specialist Chen Yun,
 both of whom lost favor in 1959.
 Occasional reports of fac-
 tionalism--in the sense of active
 competition by disciplined groups
 --seem to be essentially conjec-
 tures based on the supposition
 that there must be some leaders
 who believe that Mao's decisions
 to launch the Leap Forward and
 to challenge the Soviets were
 inopportune and even disastrous.
 However, the limited available
 evidence does not indicate that
 differences of opinion have
 hardened into factionalism.
 The regime's anti-Soviet
 stand, despite its harmfuleffects
 on China's national interests,
 has been strongly endorsed by all
 of Mao's immediate subordinates.
 The Soviets themselves have con-
 ceded that they can find little
 trace of willingness to accommo-
 date at top levels of the Chinese
 party.   Soviet polemical attacks
 on China have criticized Mao,
 Liu and. Chou by name, suggesting
 that Moscow sees no chance of
 encouraging a split at the top
 level.   In its domestic propa-
 ganda Moscow has suggested that
 one of the reasons Chinese leaders
 now are hostile is that over
 the years Mao has purged im-
 mediately any leader who became
 a friend of the USSR.
 Differences
 Mao has never tolerated
 persistent opposition to any
 major policy line and there is
 no indication of active opposi-
 tion now.  Top leaders have long
 exhibited temperamental differ-
 ences, however, which tend to
 divide them into distinct though
 not necessarily opposing groups
 of radicals and comparative mod-
 erates.  The influence of both
 groups can be detected in current
 domestic and foreign policies,
 which contain an eclectic mix-
 ture of doctrinaire and prag-
 matic elements.
 The radical grouping, led
 by Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hs iao
 ping, has clearly dominated in
 recent years.   It is in firm con-
 trol of the party apparatus and
 it tends to be the group favored
 by Mao.  Men in this group share
 fundamentalist, militant views.
 Like Stalin in many ways, they
 are naturally disposed toward
 ambitious industrial goals, but
 the succession of economic dis-
 asters in 1960 and 1961 caused
 them to retreat  grudgingly from
 such goals and to place heavier
 emphasis on security and ideo-
 logical problems.  Thus they are
 preoccupied with preserving what
 they believe is pure Marxism-

 Leninism, with conducting polit-
 ical  campaigns against "class
 enemies"--still in their view a
 major threat--and with weeding
 out unreliable or wavering ele-
 ments from the armed forces and
 the party.  Their hostility to
 Soviet leaders is based in part
 on a seemingly genuine conviction
 that the Soviets are ideological
 backsliders and traitors to the
 world Communist movement.
 Premier Chou En-lai has ap-
 peared to head a moderate group-
 ing that is believed to include,
 at the politburo level, Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi, Finance Minis-
 ter Li Hsien-nien, and Li Fu-chun,
 the regime's top economic spokes-
 man and planner.   (It included
 Chen Yun, too, before his decline.)
 In describing Chou as a moderate,
 allowance should be made for the
 fact that his position as premier
 permits him less opportunity than
 some other party leaders to mani-
 fest his ideological fervor and
 that he has always faithfully
 supported even the most radical
 of Mao's policies.   It is never-
 theless apparent, from a long
 record of public and private
 statements, that he consistently
 feels less attracted to radical
 Solutions than are Mao, Liu, and
 Teng.
 Chou's pragmatism--when he
 is allowed to exercise it--sup-
 plies a useful balance to the
 leadership.  He is more willing
 than the rest to modify doctrine
 that is highly unrealistic when
 applied to China.   For example,
 Chou apparently finds it easier
 than other leaders to recognize
 that overpopulation is a serious
 and long-term problem for China,
 and to dispute the orthodox Marx-
 ist view that it can be a problem
 only in capitalist societies.
 Chou is the only top leader to
 have ever publicly endorsed birth
 control and is the chief backer
 of the birth control campaign
 instituted in 1963.  This cam-
 paign must certainly have the
 silent endorsement of other
 leaders, or at least of Mao, but
 at the same time these men are
 undoubtedly more sensitive than
 Chou to its anti-Marxist taint.
 In September 1963, Soviet propa-
 ganda exploited this point by
 charging that current Chinese
 population control measures, in-
 cluding male sterilization, are
 "incompatible with a Marxist ap-
 proach."
 Chou En-lai is more sophis-
 ticated than his colleagues and
 has a greater awareness of the
 outside world.  As a result, he
 is particularly persuasive with
 foreigners and has a special
 appeal to Chinese intellectuals,
 attributes shared by his fore-
 most current associate on the
 politburo, Chen Yi.  Chou and
 Chen have long demonstrated a
 flair for creating an aura of
 good will for China abroad.
 Their recent successful swing
 through Africa and South Asia
 contrasts with Liu Shao-chi's
 colorless, ineffectual perform-
 ance in this regard last spring
 during a tour of Southeast Asia.
 Mao has never visited a non-Com-
 munist country, nor has Teng
 Hsiao-ping since his student
 days in Paris.  Chou and Chen
 are the politburo spokesmen usu-
 ally chosen to represent the

 regime when it wants to concil-
 iate intellectuals.
 Chou's willingness to oppose
 the USSR in recent years is prob-
 ably based chiefly on nation-
 alistic grounds--that is, on ter-
 ritorial disputes, on Soviet ef-
 forts to control Chinese foreign
 policy and military forces, and
 on Soviet refusal to back up
 China against India and the US.
 Although anti-Soviet, he would
 be unlikely to feel as strongly
 as Mao, Liu, and Teng about the
 ideological aspects of the dis-
 pute or share their conviction
 that the leadership in Moscow is
 permitting Soviet society to back-
 slide dangerously.   Soviet offi-
 cials have said they would rather
 deal with Chou than with either
 Mao or Liu, because he is more
 flexible and intelligent.  This
 distinction is reflected in So-
 viet propaganda, which has dealt
 less harshly with Chou than with
 either Mao or Liu.
 The Aging Leadership
 The men at the top may have
 their differences, but they also
 have one important thing in com-
 mon:   They are all old-guard,
 first-generation Communists, who
 are reaching an age where they
 must realize that a new leader-
 ship generation is almost at
 hand.  Since 1958, when the newest
 members were elected, two polit-
 buro members have died and several
 others are too old to play an
 active role any longer.   This
 latter group includes the party
 elders Chu Teh and Tung Pi-wu,
 the superannuated Marshal Liu Po-
 cheng, and probably Marshal Ho
 Lung.  Minister of National De-
 fense Lin Piao, who is at 56 the
 youngest member of the politburo,
 has chronic tuberculosis.   In
 view of their age, even those
 who are still active will be
 increasingly sidelined with ail-
 ments.   Illness may account for
 the unexplained failure of top
 economic spokesman Li Fu-chun
 to make any public appearances
 during a five-month period in
 1963.
 The state of Mao Tse-tung's
 mental and physical health, which
 has an important bearing on Chi-
 nese domestic policy and Sino-
 Soviet relations, has been in
 question  for some years.  Al-
 though Peiping propaganda has
 consistently portrayed him as
 vigorous and healthy, there was
 strong evidence in the mid-1950s
 of several bouts of illness, pos-
 sibly including a stroke or two,
 and he has declined noticeably
 in physical vigor and mental
 acuity since 1957.   In 1960 and
 1961, Moscow conducted a whisper-
 ing campaign against Mao, intimat-
 ing that he was senile.  His fre-
 quent public appearances--they
 have increased since 1962--belie
 the charge, however, and Moscow,
 perhaps realizing that it is
 dangerous to belittle its adver-
 sary, has dropped this line of
 attack.  Mao appears in fair
 health, and while his grasp of
 details seems to be slipping,
 his leadership has apparently
 not been disputed.
 The best evidence that Mao
 has declined, aside from the bad
 judgment shown in his domestic
 and anti-Soviet policy decisions
 after 1957, lies in his record

 of productivity.  Mao was once
 a forceful speechmaker and a
 prolific and effective writer,
 but no important production has
 been claimed for him since 1957.
 (Although Moscow now asserts he
 was the author of "Long Live
 Leninism," a key anti-Soviet
 polemic published in April 1960,
 he probably did no more than
 supply the general line of argu-
 ment to his staff writers.)  The
 last major article to appear
 under Mao's signature was in 1956.
 He last delivered a public speech
 in November 1957, and since then
 has made only infrequent addresses
 to closed party gatherings.
 Greeting and impressing
 foreign visitors has become one
 of Mao's chief, and perhaps most
 useful, activities.  Usually he
 has little to say to visitors,
 but relies instead on his pres-
 ence and prestige to dazzle them.
 When he does talk at length  he
 is unim ressive.
 Since 1957, Peiping has
 republished large gi'antities
 of Mao's pre-1949 writings on
 political and military doctrine,
 as a reminder of the master's
 greatness.  After the publica-
 tion of a one-page article in
 June 1958, however, no new work
 was attributed to Mao until mid-
 1963, when he began issuing brief
 personal statements denouncing
 various aspects of US policy.
 Four statements--all unimpressive
 strings of clichds--have been

 Vietnam (29 August 1963), in

 attempt to show that Mao is still

 ten short poems by Mao, nine with

 Problem of the Succession
 Totalitarian regimes such
 as China's historically have had
 difficulty arranging for the
 orderly transfer of political
 power, and Peiping seems aware
 that it may soon have to deal
 with this problem.  The regime
 admits that among its foremost
 concerns are those of preserving
 the revolutionary spirit when
 the first generation passes on
 and preventing the kind of back-
 sliding it claims has occurred
 in the USSR.
 Peiping has been working
 assiduously to groom an immediate
 successor to Mao and has been
 attempting to develop a second
 generation of leadership that
 can be relied on to continue
 his policies.  Mao's openly
 designated choice as heir is
 Liu Shao-chi, his first lieu-
 tenant in the party since 1945.
 A major step to increase Liu's
 stature was taken in 1959 when
 Mao turned ever to Liu the

 chairmanship of the Chinese Peo-
 ple's Republic (CPR)--while re-
 taining the more important post
 of party chairman.  Although the
 duties of the CPR chairman are
 largely ceremonial, this transfer
 enhanced Liu's prestige by making
 him nominal chief of state and by
 conferring on him the title of
 "Chairman" hitherto reserved for
 Mao's sole use.
 are indications that he has be-
 come bitter and xenophobic.   Some
 Soviets are said to regard him
 as the most intransigently anti-
 Soviet of all Chinese leaders.
 Liu's visits to North Vietnam and
 North Korea in 1963 were occasions
 for strong anti-Soviet speeches,
 Non-Communists who talk to??Liu
 are usually treated to harangues
 against India or the. US.
 Next to Mao, Liu is China's
 foremost ideological spokesman.
 Except for Mao, Liu is the only
 Chinese whose works are required
 reading for party members.  The
 chief document available for study
 is a 1939 pamphlet   "How To Be
 a Good Communist," which was
 dusted off in 1962 and reissued
 in a re-edited version.  The party
 rank and file have been told that
 in this work Liu made an "out-
 standing contribution" to Marxism-
 Leninism.   A campaign is cur-
 rently developing to have party
 officials study a speech given
 by Liu in October 1963 attacking
 "modern revisionism" and the USSR..
 The speech, described by Radio
 Peiping as "important" was not
 published, possibly because it
 was so imtemperate that it would
 have given Moscow propaganda am-
 munition to support the charge
 that Chinese leaders are overly
 militant.
 Liu has few apparent attri-
 butes of a leader.  He is color-
 less, humorless, and shares none
 of Mao's charisma. Since the
 dramatic failure in 1960 of Leap
 Forward policies, with which Liu
 was closely associated, he has
 not publicly spoken out on do-
 mestic economic affairs.  There

 believe
 that after Mao and Liu, the suc-
 cession will pass to Teng Hsiao-
 ping, party secretary general,
 rather  than to his nominal su
 perior, the comparatively moderate
 Chou En-lai.  Teng seems to be
 favored by both Mao and Liu, has
 a strong position in the party,,_
 probably including supervision
 of the secret police, and is
 slightly younger than Chou.
 Although the old guard may
 be able to retain control for
 several more years, they will
 soon have to begin admitting
 younger leaders into the inner
 circle of policy makers.  They
 have been reluctant to do this
 because of their distrust. of
 men who have not fully shared
 their revolutionary experiences.
 In recent years almost no new
 blood has been brought into the
 top echelons of party, government,
 or armed forces.
 Little is known about the
 individuals who make up the next
 generation of leaders.  Opinions

 on their character vary widely.
 Peiping has scoffed at US pre-
 dictions that leadership atti-
 tudes might soften when younger
 men take over.   In propaganda
 directed at domestic audiences,
 however, it is clear that Pei-
 ping fears that the newcomers
 will be a relatively pragmatic
 group that tends to set purely
 national interests above ideo-
 logical considerations.  These
 fears may well be valid when
 applied to the next generation
 of leaders.  The core of the
 second echelon of leadership,
 however, is still made up of
 first-generation men who were
 junior officers during the Lon
 March in the early 1930s.I
 this second echelon
 is just as dogmatic as the  res-
 ent incumbents.
 second-level lea ers have  e-en
 even more insulated from contact
 with the outside world. and have
 been nurtured entirely in the
 indoctrinated atmosphere of the
 party apparatus.
 An unstable situation could
 develop in several ways.  Mao may
 deteriorate so far that Liu is
 tempted to push him aside before
 he is willing to retire volun-
 tarily.  Even if Liu takes over
 according to scheduled arrange-
 ments, he might be challenged by
 Teng Hsiao-ping--a highly am-
 bitious man who might be unwilling
 to wait his turn.  Either Liu or
 Teng could be challenged by Chou,
 although this seems unlikely.
 Chou has always given the impres-
 sion that he is content to play
 a subordinate role, but he might
 be forced into the contest in
 self-defense to preserve even
 this position.  Liu and Teng
 probably would win such a contest25x1
 handily, because of their control25x1
 of key instruments of power--the 25X1
 party machine and the armed forces
 --but there is an outside chance 25x1
 that in an intraparty dispute
 Chou might find enough support
 from moderate elements, partic-
 ularly  in the army, to over-
 power forces controlled by Liu
 and Teng.
 In spite of Peiping's pre-
 cautions, the succession may turn
 out to be disorderly.  Men who
 had been willing to submerge their
 differences to work under Mao
 might be unwilling to accept the
 leadership of a less impressive
 person with differing views.  A
 new, insecure leader might feel
 (as did Khrushchev) that he had
 to act swiftly to remove poten-
 tial opposition.
 In any case, there is little
 prospect for a reinvigoration of
 the Chinese leadership during the
 next few years.  The process can-
 not even begin until Mao leaves
 the scene; and his departure may
 lead to a protracted power struggle,
 to the growth of factionalism, and,
 conceivabl    to debilitatin
 purges.                                 25
