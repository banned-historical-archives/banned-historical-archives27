 MAQtS CURRENT THESES QN CpNTRA,DICTION AND THE.
 CHENG FENG (PARTY REFQRM IvZC}VEME.NT)
 SUMM~.RY~~
 1.  The current Cheng Feng (Party Reform .Movement),  set in
 motion by Maots .February and March speeches, is a reflection of
 Maols apprehension over possible failure of the Second Five-Year
 Plan (1.95.8-196Z):  CGP popularity may be severely tested in the
 course of selling and implementing the Plan.
 2.  Facing Chinas demography (a population of 600, 000, 000)
 and the relatively small size of the CCP, Mao is concerned with
 possible mass pressures on the regime, particularly in the light of
 the "Hungarian tragedy" during which CP Hungary disintegrated
 rapidly.  (In the now available text Mao admits anti-regime
 fermentation appeared in China in the wake of Hungarian events,
 especially preference for Western democracy, )
 3,  Mao's recent theses on contradictions are consistent with
 his traditional attempts to combine implementation. of Marxism-
 Leninism with proper consideration for Chinese realities.  His
 position as "independent" interpreter of the Bolshevik Bible has
 been acknowledged by Stalin and the Khrushchev regime.  (The -now
 available text should be fully acceptable to the Soviets. )
 4.  The theses that non-antagonistic contradictions exist in a
 "Socialist" society are. no innovations or revisions of Marxism-
 Leninism.  in essence they acknowledge the fact that classes have
 not been completely eradicated and that "socialism" will not be able,
 for a long time, to satisfy fully the needs of the people.  This
 situation creates potential conflict.
 ~  This is the summary of an analysis prepared prior to the
 publication of Mao's speech (18 June).  Gertain observations based
 on study of the incomplete text available have been added in brackets,

 The theses dramatize. the possibility that such conflicts may explode,
 and alert the entire Party apparatus not to aggravate the situation
 which may result from anticipated economic and cultural frustrations
 of the peopled  Fully endorsing the use of repression internally when
 necessary, Mao playa up the "persuasive aspects" of the dictatorship
 as apreventive-defensive measure.
 5.  Mao~s dramatization of the alleged "liberality" of a Communist
 regime may become a showpiece of Communist propaganda.  It fits
 surprisingly well into. the design of the renewed Soviet line for peace-
 ful coexistence and coincides with. the international line.  In view of
 Hungary the Soviets are in no position to dramatize the issue them-
 selves and. may appreciate the general propagandistic benefits of Mao's
 theses for which there are ideological precedents in their own.
 theoretical writings.  Nevertheless, there should be Soviet sensitivity
 on the point of leadership.
 6e  No uniform acceptance or assimilation of Mao~s theses should
 be expected in the Bloc since this would conflict with the prevailing
 propaganda pattern of tactical independence of Communist Parties.
 Limited assimilation in order to absorb fermentation processes is
 already indicated in the attitude of CP Czechoslovakia.
 7.  .A.asimilation in the Bloc is facilitated by the limitations inherent
 in Maot s approach:
 a~  No dilution. of Marxism-Leninism.
 b~  Right to criticize confined to units already controlled by
 +CCP.
 c)  "Destructive" (i. e. , uncontrolled) criticism not permitted.
 d) .Intellectuals to be 'brought under strict Party control,
 e)  "Weeds't permitted in order to expose "enemyts~'
 propaganda and aims.
 f)  .Reliance on and eventual use of force internally indirectly
 acknowledged in concept that "non-antagonistic contradictions"
 may blow up.

 g)  Evaluation of an "antagonism", i, e. , threat to regime,
 remains arbitrary.
 (The now available text further spells out the limitations of Maots
 'liberal" or "democratic" approach,  He does not eliminate the
 repressive aspects of the dictatorship but combines them with the
 preventive measures of Party controlled  persuasion, discussion
 and education,
 8.  The vulnerabilities of Maots theses stem from the fact that
 the Party must, explain to the "people" the hard facts of Chinese
 economic troubles..

 MAC?'S CURRENT THESES ON CONTRADICTION .l~.ND THE
 CHENG FENG (P.~.RTY REFORM MC!VEMENT}
 1,   Three times,  at crucial turning points in the development
 of the Communist Party of China,  Mao Tse-tung has put Party and
 non--Party cadre through an intensive ideological indoctrination
 program in order to enforce a unified leadership approach to the
 task ahead.
 2,   The first and most intensive of these programs (Cheng
 Feng or Party Reform Movements) which lasted from 1942 to about
 1;44,  consolidated the Chinese Communist Party as well as Mao's
 leading position and. readied the leadership corps for the post-war
 showdown. with the Kuomintang.  The second - -and less known- -
 Cheng Feng (Three Seasons. Reform) was initiated in the summer of
 1954 following the consolidation of state power in 1949 and appears
 to have been geared to the ensuing class struggle period which
 culminated in 1955-56 with the drastic and rapid communization.. of
 Chinas s agricultural and industrial base.
 3.  The current Cheng Feng, which was set in motion by Maos s
 report to the Supreme State Conference (2? February to 1 March 1957)
 and his 12 March speech to the .National Conference of Propaganda

 Work, can. readily be linked with the. emerging Second Five-Year
 Plan which is to run from 1958 to 1962.  Held against the background
 of the dislocations. and dissatisfactions created by the rapid
 communization program of 1955 and 1956,  success or failure of the
 Second Five-Year Plan could. well determine the future course of
 events within China.  A note of apprehension is discernible in the
 7 June  annauncernent of the "National Conference of Design" at
 which the guiding principles of the Second Five-Year Plan. were
 discussed.      According to a New York Times  dispatch from Hong
 Kong,  7 June, "the announcement said that the factors that guided
 the principles of the Second Five-Year Plan were the realization
 that. China- was still a big agricultural country with. a meager
 industrial foundation, that it had a Mtge (600, 000, 000) population
 with a low living standard and. that its economy and cultural develop-
 ment was uneven."  Thus, a period beset with many knotty problems
 is seen ahead for China.  The current Party Reform Movement is an
 alert to the entire Communist Party of China as well as itsgovernmental
 auxiliaries and fronts, that its leadership and popularity will be
 severely tested in its efforts to sell and implement the Second Five-
 Year Plan.

 4.  What is Mao1s fundamental approach to the leadership
 problem?  Although his .February and March speeches have not been
 published as yet, his thoughts have clearly emerged in a variety of
 CCP pronouncements and in a summary of his remarks, including
 textual excerpts, acquired and published by the New York Times
 Warsaw correspondent, Sidney Gruson (see New York Times, 13 June).
 These are sufficiently broad in. scope to show that Maots position
 today is remarkably consistent with those propounded openly in years
 past,  ("On Contradiction", 1937; keynote addresses in the First
 Gheng Feng Movement, 1942; Report to the Third Plenum of the Central
 Committee, June 1950; CCP statement "More on the Historical
 Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" of 2$ December 1956;
 etc. )
 Mao posed the problem sharply in his February 1942 Cheng
 Feng speech when he asked "How can Marxist-Leninist theory and the
 reality of the Chinese Revolution- be united?"  The body of thought
 called "Maoism" is but the sum total of answers to this simple question,
 Hence, it is no accident that the common theme of alI three Party
 Reform Movements is an attack on "subjectivism", which is Party
 jargon for insufficient recognition of, and inadequate tactical adjustment

 Approved For Relea~ 2000/08/27 :CIA-RDP78-00915-$~000700200022-8
 to  Chinese reality.  "Subjectivism" among the leadership is the root
 of other harmful attitudes, ea g.:  "dogmatism-+ and "doctrinairism",
 i, e. , mechanical. application of Marxist-Bolshevik doctrine;
 '}formalism", i~ e. ,  reliance on Party jargon in propaganda;
 46sectarianism~', i, e. ,  counterproductive friction within the Party or
 between the Party and the "outside"; "bureaucratism,  commandism'.;
 which are subjectivism in administrative and executive management,
 i. eb , the attitude based on the erroneous notion that reality is changed
 by issuing orders.
 In the February 1942 speech cited Mao seems to express the
 practical reason for his abhorrence of subjectivism:  the demography
 of China.  Visualizing an eventual Party strength of about 4, 000, 00.0
 he pointed out that fl~.e Party would, at best, represent only one per
 cent out of a population of 400, 000, 000 and therefore could. not afford.
 to antagonize the people unnecessarily,  Today the Chinese Party
 claims about 12, 000, 000 members out of a claimed population strength
 of 600, 000, 000.  The Party, then, represents even now only two per
 cent of the total population.
 Mao's concern with Chinas demography is also- evident in his
 recent speeches.  Introducing the concept of birth control--in itself a
 staggering innovation in the social and cultural pattern of China--he

 cites the inadequacy of agricultural production in feeding a growing
 population, as well as the limitations of primary educational facilities.
 If,  as appears indicated, the Second Five-Year Plan may not
 live up to expectations, Mao's concern with possible mass pressures
 on the regime is understandable--particularly in the light of the events
 in Hungary,,  The "Hungarian tragedyt' (as Mao terms it) emerges
 clearly as the immediate cause for Mao~s current ideological and
 practical deliberations,  stemming from concern not only over the
 popular uprising but also aver the rapid disintegration of CP Hungary,

 as a disposition toward breaking away from the Soviet Union, it must
 be emphasized that the principle of "unity of theory and practice" is a
 standard tenet of Marxism-Leninism. and was one of Stalini s pet
 phrases.  Students of Mao's thought have repeatedly reported their
 inability to find any trace of conceptual heterodoxy.  In particular were
 they unable to discern any deviationism in the Party indoctrination
 material issued during the first Cheng Feng (1g42j which is the model
 for the current Party "rectification" campaign?  Neither can there be

 found any deviations from fundamental Bolshevik thought in the
 available xnatexials on Mao's speeches and the current Cheng Feng,
 'What is evident currently, as it was in 1942,  is Mao's insistence upon
 expressing and unfolding  the Marxist-Bolshevik principle of the
 dictatorship of the proletariat in terms of Chinese reality.
 In. 1942, the first C.heng Feng was accompanied by the demotion
 and loss of influence of a small group of 3vlos.cow-trained  Chinese
 Communist leaders who had held key positions in the Central
 Committee of the CCP,  on the grounds of their inability to adapt

 Today too much. is made of the unorthodoxy of Moots thesis an
 1?Contradictions within the hanks of the People", particularly as an
 indication of a Sino-Soviet ideological rift.  Mao as an interpreter of
 the Bolshevik Bible has always insisted that he needs no middleman in
 matters Chinese,  Stalin acknowledged this position through the 1950
 Sino-Soviet treaty, and the Khrushchev regime consistently enhanced
 the prestige of the CCP,

 theoreticians.  (Mao first expounded this thesis in his essay "l'~n
 Contradiction", written in 1937).         In plain language Mao's position
 can be summarized. as follows:  In order to achieve power the
 Communist Party must use farce to crush the class enemy and
 establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, i, e, ,  solve the  "antagonistic
 contradictions" of the class struggle.  1~fter the Communist Party has
 achieved full state and economic control, there is, theoretically
 speaking, no more class conflict,  since classes have been abolished.
 The "class enemy" is now mainly represented by the external threat
 fxorn the imperialists.  Nevertheless,  internally there still may
 develop socio-economic-political conflicts, problems and pressures.
 Since there are no more hostile classes, these conflicts, problems
 and pressures are theoretically speaking "non-antagonistic contradictions",
 i. e, ,  capable of solution by means other than force, principally by
 persuasion, discussion: and education.  3f not correctly handled,
 however, these contradictions may become "antagonistic", i, e. ,
 threaten the. power position of the regime as they did in Hungary,
 necessitating the use of farce,  Through his thesis, then,  Mao
 addresses himself in greater detail than any other Communist theoretician,

 to a fundamental, practical  proposition, i~ e. , under what circumstances
 the "dictatorship of the proletariat" should bring into play its repressive
 forces internally.  It needs to be emphasized that Mao does not now and
 .never has repudiated the use of force or terror per se,  Concerning the
 use of farce against the 'external enemy" Mao has never expressed any
 modifying or qualifying positions,  Concerning the use of force internally
 his current positions do not question the principle, but merely the
 usefulness and productivity of terror under certain circumstances.  In
 this Mao. is no innovator.  He merely follows overt Marxist-Leninist-
 Stalinist doctrine (although not .Stalinist practice) when he attempts to
 establish a balance between the coercive and the paternalistic aspects
 of the dictatorship of the proletariat.  The following statement from a
 report by ~,., :A.. Zhdanov to the Plenum of the Central Committee of the
 Communist Party of the .Soviet Union, 21 February 193?, illustrates the
 point.  Zhdanov said;
 "Leninism teaches;  The dictatorship of the proletariat has its
 periods, its special forms and diversified methods of work,
 During the civil war, the coercive aspect of the dictatorship is
 especially conspicuous....  Cn the other hand, during the period
 of socialist construction, the peaceful organizational and cultural
 work of the dictatorship,  revolutionary law, etc. , are especially
 conspicuous.  But here again it by no me ans follows that during
 the. period of construction, the coercive side of the dictatorship

 has. fallen away,  or could do so. o. o The organs: of

 necessary now,  in. the period of construction, as: they
 were during the civil war period. , .."
 The Stalinist. regime paid lip service. to the paternalistic aspects. of
 the. dictatorship but perpetuated the terror system,  Mao,  although.
 emphasizing the ''peaceful" and persuasive aspect of the dictatorship
 for the time being,  disguises. by this very emphasis the fact that the.
 'organs of suppression" in Clxina continue to exist with their functions.
 unchanged,  Nor could Mao afford to let ".the coercive side of the
 dictatorship" "fall away" since by definition his. thesis admits. that.
 'non-antagonistic contradictions' may become "a.ntagonistic" if not.
 properly handled.  Given. the press- of the. huge. population mass of
 Chinese,  the- low level of economic anal educational  development, the

 lying his emphasis on "persuasion", "correct handling of contradictions"
 and the Cheng Feng Party training program, emerges also from a
 recent Peking broadcast (26 ..April 1957) on "Why are there contradictions
 within the ranks of the people?"  which unmistakably reflects Maois
 position.  The broadcast answered the title. question thus:  "First of
 all we must understand that the main contradictions    /emphasis

 a backward agricultural nation, between the people's demand for rapid

 continued frustration of "the peopleLS demand:" Mao enjoins his Party
 apparatus, especially through the Cheng Feng campaign, not to
 aggravate the situation unnecessarily by i'bureaucratic't working methods
 since the long-term plans of the regime and the short~erm desires
 and aspirations of the ''people" may conflict.  This, in essence, is the

 minor criticisms of the Soviet regime represent attitudes fully

 latter has been. most clearly expressed by the veteran CPUSA. ,leader,
 William Z. Foster (Daily Worker, 12 June) who is a "conservative"
 Communist and still enjoys Soviet trust.  This is his formula:

 could easily imagine that the Soviet leaders, while praising the Chinese
 for their original ideas,  could administer a severe dressing down to
 their own. theoreticians and propagandists for their inability to produce
 "creative" think-pieces.  With all their emphasis on international
 decentralization, the Soviets still are sensitive on points of leadership.
 This may be the reason for Khrushchev`s almost automatic rejection of
 the. idea that in the USSR conflicts exist between the leaders and the
 masses,
 In general, however, the Soviets should be satisfied with the
 limitations which Mao built into- his concepts on how to handle potential

 conspicuous than the propagandistic emphasis on "persuasion" and
 "democracy", are briefly discussed below,
 10.  The limitations imposed by Mao on the. applicability of
 his theses to other areas are paralleled by the limitations inherent
 in his speeches as well as in the current Cheng Feng in respect to
 their domestic application,
 These limitations are:
 a)  Ma.ols theses and the .Cheng Feng are preventive in
 nature;
 b)  The preventive objectives require a stronger CCP both
 in terms of ideological purity and organizational control.
 c)  The use of terror or repressive measures is governed
 by the success or failure. of preventive measures.
 11~  The purpose of the current Cheng Feng is to ensure that the
 Communist Party be  so oriented and deployed as to prevent
 "non-antagox~stic contradictions" from be corning unmanageable and
 explosive.  Hence the far-reaching categorization and definition of all

 could be achieved; the fixing of responsibility for the solution of the
 problems on the entire Party apparatus; the exhortations warning

 "Marxism-Leninism".  Hence the proposed further tightening of
 ideological and organizational discipline, .and the particular emphasis
 on the education of intellectuals in "Party spirit",  i. e. , traditional
 Marxism-Leninism as opposed to f'liberalisrn,"
 12,  Mao's concept of  persuasion is the persuasion of the ?'rnasses"
 by the Party and not persuasion of the Party by the masses,  Criticism
 is therefore limited.
 Organizationally it appears from pertinent references that
 the right of the masses to criticize pertains only to the Communist-
 controlled '"units"' or .organizations (political,  semi-governmental,
 agricultural cooperatives, etc.) which were created during the period
 of communization (1955, 1956).  This form. of organizationally
 controlled criticism and self-criticism keeps discussion in channels.

 Substantively criticism must be "constructive",  i, e. ,  compatible
 with general CCP programs and policies,  ~i.s early as June 8--three
 months after the Cheng Feng campaign was launched--the Peking
 People~s_ Daily  found it necessary to put the brakes on "criticism
 of a destructive nature."  Using language reminiscent of that previously
 used at the time of intense and. coercive drives against counter-

 form the right-wing groups today."

 The next day Peoples Daily     made it crystal clear- that the
 Party cannot afford indiscriminately to regard all criticism as helpful
 and beneficial to the people.  While the editorial says "all views and
 opinions beneficial to the socialist undertakings should'bloorn~ in full,"
 it characterizes as "of a destructive natureF' all criticism which "aims
 at undermining the socialist undertakings, the Peoplers Democratic

 out for attack are "those who publicize the view that the leadership
 exercised by the Communist party should be abolished."
 It is significant that the news. organ. of the Polish CP,
 Trybuna Ludu,  published on 13 June a report. of its Peking correspondent
 on these Pe ople t s Daily articles,
 13,  The indoctrination of intellectuals forma an effective
 limitation on the appl2cation of the much-publicized slogan 'f Let all

 of the Chinese'~.cademy of .Sciences put it on 16 May 1957, it was only
 thanks to "the movement of ideological re -education carried out in
 recent years in China" that the "hundred schools of thought" movement
 is possible now, and "the free debates now/ taking place among the
 intellectuals aim at bringing the professors and scientists of China
 still closer to the Party and at improving the Partyts direction,"
 This is the 1957 echo of Maof s theme of the 1942-44 Gheng
 Feng movement,  "There is in reality no such thing as art for artes
 sake,.,.  The Party's artistic and literary activity occupies a definite
 and assigned position in the Partyts revolutionary work and is subordinated

 to the prescribed revolutionary task of the Party in a given
 revolutionary period."  Mao himself, in the version of his speeches.
 reported by Sidney Gruson, added an interesting interpretation to the
 slogan.  "There need be no fear that the policy of 100 flowers will
 yield poisoned fruit.  Sometimes it is necessary even to have this
 poisoned fruit to know what we are fighting against  For this reason,
 too, it has been decided to publish. the full works of Chiang Kai-shek
 and even a volume of some of the Voice of America broadcasts.  It
 is not enough to attack reactionaries,  We must know exactly what
 the reactionaries want and what they represent."
 The use of provocation as a means of weeding out "poisoned
 flowers" is,  of course,  good Bolshevik practice,  In full control of
 the Party apparatus and the repressive state organs, Mao can well
 afford to say "Marxism-Leninism is not .afraid of criticism and does
 not fear discussion."  He controls the machinery to ensure that
 Marxism-Leninism will win out.

 aspects of the dictatorship at this stage, he endorses without
 qualifications the "use of force against the enemy+'. ~  His criticism

 of Malin parallels the position of the 2tJth CP5U Congress and
 Khrushchev~s secret speech according to which Stalin used force
 unproductively, especially against the Communist Party.
 If it is accepted that Mao's concept o# the dictatorship is to
 establish a correct balance between the persuasive and repressive
 aspects of the dictatorship, the question arises as to when Mao would
 consider the use of terror justified.  On the basis of the available
 materials on Mao~s February and March speeches, the answer is
 obviously that Mao would use repression and terror internally when-
 ever the power position of the regime was threatened  This is
 evident from his renewed. endorsement of Soviet intervention. in
 Hungary and from his position on strikes  Rejecting all strikes as
 being "never beneficial to the working class'+, Mao considers small
 strikes as useful symptoms of a malady to be cured but does not
 consider ++big general strikes+' the same way because "they are
 directed against the regime."
 It is interesting to speculate on how big a strike in China
 would have to be in order to be considered a threat to the regime.  In
 the light of past experience, it is fair to assume that the determination
 of what constitutes a threat to the regime would be made arbitrarily.
