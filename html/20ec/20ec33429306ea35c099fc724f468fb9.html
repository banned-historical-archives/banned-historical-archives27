1I UILY January 1970 
THE COMMUNIST SCENE  
(22 November - 19 December 1969) 
I. New Degradations by the Husak Regime 
The lot of the Czechoslovak people has become progressively worse since 
Husak's takeover last April, to the point that outsiders began to think that 
the only direction it could go would be for the better. But the past month has 
revealed a new law to date for the Czech people. Self-denunciation and denunci-
ation of one citizen by another, purges, and group self-criticism as practiced 
at the lowest depths of Stalinism in the Soviet Union have become the policy of 
the Husak regime. Some of the evidence of this depressing fact is recorded 
below. 
A. Do-it-yourself Brainwashing 
Nearly simultaneously with the release of the notorious questionnaire by 
the Czech Minister of Education, Jaromir Hrbek, requiring university faculty 
to inform on their colleagues and students, Hrbek issued an even more diabolic 
directive to all employees of his Ministry. This document requires Ministry 
employees to evaluate at least ten colleagues and identify their weaknesses, 
political, moral, and professional. Equally degrading, each employee must 
evaluate himself, lay bare his private thoughts, confess his aberrations in an 
ingenious kind of do-it-yourself brain-washing. The employee is warned: ".,. 
untruth and incompleteness of your own evaluation will unambiguously testify 
against you and render impossible any effort to do you good." It further warns 
that the worker will be evaluated "by a collective of co-workers and eventual 
contradictions in data will be investigated." The ostensible purpose is 
stated: "At the Ministry people cannot work Who do:not possess the necessary 
ability, who are not firm politically, who are insincere and have faults in 
their character." The completed questionnaire will provide documentary grounds 
for the dismissal of any employee of the Ministry and can be used as a weapon, 
a sword of Damocles, threatening the economic and personal security of every 
employee of the Ministry. This method of assuring obedience is properly labeled 
an "Inquisition" by Hans Morgenthau, but in its utter cynicism it is devoid 
even of the ideological heat and passion that was so important a motive force in 
the Middle Age atrocities. 
Some feeling for the monstrousness of this directive and its debasement ol 
the human spirit can be gained if the reader will imagine himself being required 
to answer to his present employer in these terms. 
(The directive is attached in a translation published by The New York Review 
of Books on 4 December 1969 along with apenetrating commentary by the eminent 
American scholar Hans J. Morgenthau. Louis Aragon, French Communist Party Central 
Committee member, published the other directive -- to the universities -- with 
his own scathing commentary in his literary journal Les Lettres Francaises in 
October.)

B, Purges. 
Purges sweeping through every level of party, government and public life 
nave expelled thousands from their positions and forced resignations of many 
more who resist pressures to conform, The latest and highest level purge was 
'Ira'r of Josef Smrkovsky and 10 other liberal members of the Czechoslovak parlia-
ment (see attached New York Times article), The new Party orthodoxy increas-
ong_4 resembles Stalin-era Communism, as the following random examples show: 
Jindricn Suk, chief of the Czech news agency C.T.K., former minister of 
Eduction and Culture and former deputy editor of Rude Pravo, was ousted to make 
may for hard-liner Otakar Svercina. One reporter estimates that 10% of all 
journalists and broadcasters have been fired since the Soviet invasion of 1968. 
(One network commentator, Vladimir Skutina, turned up in a Prague hospital 
where he had been taken from prison, His arrest had never been admitted but 
public outcry from Italian intellectual circles had apparently forced his release 
from prison.) 
Cestmir Cisar was replaced as chairman of the Czech National Council, 
)n?: of the two state legislative bodies (the other, the Slovak National Council 
Jill hold its own purge soon), Sixty-two of the 200 legislators were replaced 
in one massive stroke -- nine were expelled, fifty-three were permitted to 
resign, Cisar was popular with the students during the Czech Spring and so was 
suspect and ousted despite his recent espousal of Husak-orthodoxy. 
.- Emil Zatopek, internationally famous Olympic champion runner, expelled 
from the Communist Party in October, "resigned" from the presidium of the Czech 
Olympic committee on 28 November, Zatopek's denunciation of the 1968 Soviet 
invasion had already cost him his Defense Ministry position and his post as 
trainer in the Czech army athletic program. He is now having difficulty find-
ing even menial jobs to maintain livelihood for himself and his family. 
So extreme and so widespread has this "cleansing" process become that it 
eportedly alarms even some of Czechoslovakia's Communist neighbors. Hungary's 
Party paper quoted a Prague comrade as saying that Czech tactics are "rough, 
terroristic and inhuman." Communist Yugoslavia's news service TANYUG, which 
lescribed the purges as failing of their purpose thus far despite having attained 
"wide proportions," adds in a masterpiece of understatement: "It could ... be 
said of the present political situation and the mood of the people that they 
nave calmed down but not consolidated in the sense of their full engagement for 
a new political concept...." 
"Plea Culpa," 
A particularly humiliating -- and cynical -- turn of the screw in Czecho-
sivakia is the requirement for self criticism in which groups publicly purge 
hemseives of their guilt for having supported "Communism with a human face." 
"F:ghtist 014/trtvaism" is the phrase which officially describes their crime, 
Aming recent examples are: 
pinitempipoomminownewame.

. -- Workers in television news service on 21 November 'weighed their own 
contribution by the fact that in the period since January 1968 the television 
news in many cases slipped onto the platform of rightist opportunism." Now, 
having "... self critically 5Ondemne7whatever was unprincipled, unsound and 
harmful to our party" they "fully identify themselves with the political line 
of the new party leadership headed by Dr. Gustav HUsak." 
Prace, the Slovak trade union daily, sometimes "succumbed to reckless-
ness" in the period following January 1968, according to staff members attend-
ing a Communist Party meeting on 10 November. Now, "in a self-critical analysis, 
the Prace staff considered the errors made in the past period, fully dissociates 
itself from them and is determined not to repeat them in the future." 
-- The Czechoslovak radio leadership confessed that "after January 1968, 
under the influence of rightist opportunists in several leading and key positions 
in the Czechoslovak radio, the activities of the radio became inconsistent with 
its traditional revolutionary, socialist, and international mission." Now, 
ono it assumes a great pledge: ... in the spirit of the recent plenums of the 
CPCZ Central Committee, to return the radio to its mission of a daily fighter 
for the genuine interests of the people, for the advancement of socialism and 
for friendship with the peoples of the Soviet Union and Of the other socialist 
countries." 
-- The Czech Journalists' Union management commission "abolished all po-
litically faulty and incorrect standpoints of the former leadership." The 
South Bohemian branch "rejected, among other things, the practice of the past 
year when the communications media became an uncontrollable force subjectively 
serving rightwing opportunism and also clearcut antisocialist intentions" 
These recantations from the journalists bring to mind the Czech journalists' 
appeal to the International Press Institute on the anniversary of the Soviet 
invasion of Czechoslovakia. They urged "all journalists of the really free 
world to describe objectively what is taking place in Czechoslovakia and to 
give us moral support." (See attached, "An Appeal from Prague.") 
II. Dissension Deepens Within Western European Parties  
A. Democracy: Italian Coinniunist Style  
On 12 November the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Sovie-,, 
Union (CPSU) suggested in a major Pravda article that self-criticism and other 
"democratic" practices should be improved at the lowest party level -- the 
cell meeting. (The party report mentioned no such innovation for the higher, 
decision-making levels of the Party.) It is ironic that while the Pravda 
editors were encouraging more democracy and less centralism at the lower _Levets 
of the CPSU for reasons peculiar to the Soviet Union, the most "democratic" ( f 
Western European Communist parties, the Italian Party (PCI), was at the same 
time insisting on less democracy and more centralism forts dissenting critic::., 
The PCI Central Committee had long been wrestling with the problem of the 11 
Manifesto group. The dilemma: Should the leadership try to ignore the blunt 
criticism of the heretical monthly and thus try to preserve the image of Party 
3

Approved For Release 2000/08/29 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400150001-6 
democracy and "unity through diversity"? Or should they expel the trouble-
makers, whose dissenting voice was undermining leadership policies by calling 
f,;r reversion to pristine revolutionary radicalism and for rejection of 
viet tutelage and of collaboration with non-Communist parties for the purpose 
if participating in a coalition government. 
The PCI Central Committee was finally forced to decide and on 26 November 
suspended from membership the four key figures of Il Manifesto: ,editor Rossana 
Rossanda, director Lucio Margi, and two parliamentary deputies, Aldo Natoli 
and Luigi Pintor, The Il Manifesto group is clearly anathema to the CPSU, not 
Dnly because of its contemptuous rejection of the Soviet model, but because it 
ught (with increasing success) to frustrate the PCI's long-cherished hope of 
participating in government. Therefore, rumors that the CPSU had wielded a 
heavy hand to oust the Il Manifesto group have considerable credibility. 
Moscow registered its unqualified approval of the suspension in a 10 
December Pravda editorial. So in two strokes -- the suspension and CPSU public 
approval of it -- the PCI gravely jeopardized its carefully nurtured image of 
a-moderate Party, independent of Moscow, Other Italian political parties, 
particularly those which were prospective coalition partners, wondered what 
was image and what was reality:ln the PCI. Past PCI polemics with the CPSU 
began to look more like shadow-boxing than a real exchange of blows, and the 
PCI's disciplinary action, under Soviet prodding, against the Il Manifesto  
editors spoke louder than words as to "democracy PCI-style." 
B. Austrian Party Split Hardens 
The long struggle between the strong progressive faction and the dominant 
conservative group in the Austrian Communist Party (KP0e) came to a head at 
the 24-25 November Central Committee meeting. It had been called at the in-
stigation of the progressives to reverse an earlier decision to oust Fritz 
Zapf, head of the party's youth organization (FOJ) and member of the Politburo. 
Phe FOJ has been openly critical of the dominant conservative leadership of 
the Party. (The conservatives decreed its dissolution but thus far it has 
refused to dissolve. Nor has it abated its criticism.) In a close vote, 
37-34 with four abstaining, the Central Committee upheld Zapf's expulsion, 
whereupon 27 liberals walked out of the Central Committee declaring they would 
not participate in its work until full freedom of public debate was assured 
for all in the Party. Among them were the editor of the main Party organ, 
Volkstimme (People's Voice) and Politburo member Franz West, and two other 
Politburo members, Egon Kodicek and Maria Urban. 
Many parties, particularly in Europe, are trying to find a way to cope 
with public dissent by members or groups of members (factions). One way is 
to throw out the dissenters, force a split, as Lenin did frequently and as 
the PCI and KPOe leaders (as well taught Leninists) have done. The question is, 
do Communist parties have any other way? It will be interesting to watch 
whether these parties will be able to evolve away from their traditional anti-
democratism and adopt the standards of parties in the open political system of 
multi-party democracy. As likely as not, if the traditionalists continue to 
wield dominant power in CP's (as they do in all but a handful of free world 
4 
Approved For Release 2000/08/29 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400150001-6 
parties), progressive Austrian Communist and Central Committee member Theodor 
Prager's prediction will come true: "If you continue 5our hard lire, you 
will soon be standing all alone. Your majority in the Party will be total, but 
so will your isolation from the working class." (Prager's full statement is 
attached.) 
C. Issues Cleaving the PCF 
The PCI has its Il Manifesto dissenters, the KPOe its Wiener Tagebuch  
dissenters, and the PCF has its Politive Aujourd'hui dissenters -- all of whom 
have now been cast beyond the pale of normal Party activity. But the PCF still 
harbors within its bosom in the Politburo what it regards as a viper: Roger 
Garaudy. And the issue is the same: freedom for open, public debate and 
discussion of divergent views within the Party -- which Garaudy insists on and 
which the conservative leadership just as adamantly refuses to grant. 
Garaudy expects his quarrel with the PCF to come to a head at the forth-
coming 19th Congress of the PCF on 9 February. In a television interview in 
Paris on 5 December, he decried the lack of democracy in the PCF. While the 
Party could publicize far and wide its charges against him, he said, his own 
point of view had to be confined to closed meetings of Party organs. He as-
serted further than neither this form of socialism nor the kind imposed on 
Czechoslovakia by Brezhnev was his idea of what socialism should become in 
France. (Attached is a Le Monde report on the interview and on the PCF's 
response to Garaudy's interview.) Garaudy admitted that he rather expected 
to be excluded from the Politburo and the Central Committee. He added that 
he would continue to work for the Party's program and the objectives "as a 
simple soldier."

THE NEW YORK REVIEW 
4 December 1969 
Inquisition in Czechoslovakia 
Hans J. Morgenthau 
The political act, in its distinctive 
essence, is a matter of interests defined 
in terms of pOwer, which ideologies 
seek to clothe with rational necessity 
and moral worth. More particularly, 
judgments of necessity and worth are 
relative to the interests and power of 
the observer; what appears inevitable 
and noble to one may be condemned 
as capricious and vile by another. For 
example,. the occupation of Czecho-
slovakia by the Soviet army, as seen 
from the Western vantage point, may 
be judged unnecessary, an exaggerated 
response to a political threat, which 
lost the Soviet Union more throughout 
the world than it gained for its 
European empire. But from the Soviet 
perspective, it cannot be termed irra-
tional, that is, without an objective 
connection with the interests and 
power of the Soviet Union. For it is an 
existential fact, well recognized by the 
Czechoslovakian historians of the nine-
teenth century, such as Palacky, who 
were also the awakener s of Czecho-. 
siovakian nationalism, that Czecho-
slovakia, unable to stand alone, had to 
lean on one or the other of its 
powerful neighbors to ths East and to 
the West. 
In other words, Czechoslovakia has 
never had to choose between inde-
pendence and alignment, .but between 
alignment with Russia and alignment 
with Germany (for which in the inter-
war period France was a temporary 
and ultimately ineffectual substitute). 
In the measure that Czechoslovakia 
moved away from Russia, it was bound 
to move closer to Germany. It was 
against this threat that the Soviet 
Union reacted, and may well have 
overreacted, in 1968. 
However, the political act as the 
functional employment of certain 
means for achieving certain interests 
defined in terms of power is also 
subject to moral judgment. The poli-
tical act establishes a relationship be-
tween the holder and the object of 
power, in which the latter is of. 
necessity diminished in his human 
worth; he is reduced to the means Tor 
somebody else's ends. Hence the es-
sential immorality of the political act. 
What makes that immorality tolerable 
is the proportionate relationship be-
tween means and ends. That is to say, 
the human quality of the object of 
power is diminished for the sake of 
ends endowed with a transcendent 
value. The extreme case is the sacrifice 
of life in war for the sake of the 
nation's survival. 
At the other end of the spectrum, 
the extreme disproportion between 
means and ends may make the moral 
condemnation of the means employed 
inevitable. Genocide is a case in point. 
The documents before us are another. 
These documents were issued by-the 
Czechoslovak Minister of Education: 
Professor Hrbek, in the middle off, 
September of this year; their authen-
ticity has been vouchsafed by two 
independent sources. They were 
brought from Czechoslovakia to France' 
where they were translated into, 
French. They were there discovered by 
a group of American scholars who; 
translated them into English. They are; 
published here without changes apart 
from corrections in spelling and punc-
tuation. 
The purpose of these documents 
twofold. Their first and immediate 
purpose is not only to weed out from 
the Ministry of Education and the 
universities the supporters of the 1968 
reforms but also all those who are not 
completely identified with the neo-
Stalinist course of the present pro-
Russian regime. Their long-range pur-
pose is to establish ironclad controls 
over the minds of the remaining em-
ployees and faculty in order to prevent 
a recurrence of the events of 1968 and 
to assure full support for the new, 
policies. To those ends they propose to 
kill not the bodies of men but their 
souls. By confronting the objects of 
power with the choice between corn-
plying to the satisfaction of the au-
thorities and risking social, political, and 
pre, fe2SiOnall disgrace. the ques-
tionnaires aim at the degradation, cor-
ruption, and ultimate dehumanization 
of man in order to make the holders 
of power secure in their power. To 
that end, they employ five devices. 
1. They make men defenseless be-
fore the authorities. How is one to 
answer the questions pertaining to 
"personal evaluation"? If one declares 
oneself satisfied with one's work and 
capable of. carrying it out, one's super-
iors may disagree. If one answers these 
and similar questions in the negative, 
one's superiors may disagree again. In 
other words, the object of power, by 
being compelled to give definite an-
swers to questions which are of neces-
sity a matter of subjective valuation, 
delivers himself into the hands of the 
holders of power.

themselves without ever learning what

will not only make relatively decent

questionnaires are addressed can have 
no such consolation, nor can they find 
satisfaction in such ties. They are 
forced to make their own prisons, 
devastate their own souls, betray and 
suffer betrayal, and in the end detest 
themselves. In the face of the enormity 
of the crime against humanity here 
committed, it adds nothing more than 
a slight touch of irony that the author 
of these questionnaires is a professor,

life's business to profess the truth, and 
that he is in charge of educational

Among Those Forced Out 
Special to The New York limes 
VIENNA, Dec. 17--Jesef Smr-
ovsky, who was Alexander 
Dubcek's principal lieutenant 
during the liberalization IN 
Prague last year, resigned unJ 
der fire from Parliament today'. 
with 10 other liberals. 
The purge stripped the 584 
year-old Mr. Smrkovsky of hie 
last public function. 
The removal of the eleven, 
who were probably the only lib-
erals who still held seats in the 
national legislature, coincided, 
with renewed warnings against 
ultraconservatives from the 
Communist party's center of 
power. 
These seemingly contradictory 
developments indicated that the 
Czechoslovak leadership under' 
Dr. Gustav Husak, presumably, 
with Soviet support, was fol-
lowing a centrist Course against' 
"both extremes. 
The Hungarian Communist 
party chief, Janos Kadar, visit' 
ed Prague today without pre; 
vious announcement. This de-
velopment was viewed in some 
quarters as a move to bolstei 
Dr. Husak's position. 
Now considered a moderate 
at home and in Soviet-bloc af-
fairs. Mr. Kadar was thought 
to have been invited to Prague 
by Dr. Husak to help him rea-
son with the dogmatists in the 
inner party circles. Dr. Husak 
contends that their vindictive-
ness against liberal reformists 
threatens to wreck the Czecho-
slovak economy. 
The parliamentary purge %vat 
seen as a new success for the 
ultra conservatives. 
The 10 Deputies who. lost 
? their parliamentary seats With 
Mr, Smrkovsky Included thei 
r former president of the Acad:i 
emy of Sciences, Frantisek 
Sorm, and a member of the 
, academy, Josef Macek. 
Also purged were Martin 
; Vaculik, secretary of the Prague 
city. party under Mr. Dubcek; 
I Alms Polednak, former head of 
the film industry; Marie Mik; 
ova, a militant liberal; Josef 
Boruvka, a former Minister of 
Agriculture; Oleg Homola, a 
former secretary of the Czech.. 
osiovak-Soviet Friendship So-
ciety; and three lesser known 
'Zdenka Kenclova and Mrs. 
Deputies, .Jiri Lacina, Mrs.; 
-Jirina Tureckova. 
The Federal Assembly, whose 
membership of 350 was elected 
in 1964, was thoroughly 
shuffled in an earlier purge id 
October. 
Dubcek Still a Deputy 
Mr. Dubcek, until then As-
isembly chairman, was on that 
:occasion demoted to simple' 
!Deputy. He still holds a seat in 
:the legislature, but will remain 
Inactive when he takes up his? 
new post as ambassador to 
? Turkey. 
Last Monday's announcement 
:of Mr. Dubcek's appointment 
was widely interpreted as a 
defeat for the ultraconserva-
tives, who had pressed for 
further diseiplinary action 
against the former party chief. 
? Today, the party weekly 
Tribuna clearly, alluded to the 
extremists when it cautioned 
against "expressions of left, 
wing radicalism." In the Com-
munist political spectrum, dog-
matism intensifies toward the 
left and liberalism tdward the 
right. 
Tribuna's warning was even 
weightier because it was signed 
by the weekly's conservative 
editor in chief, Oldrich SvestkaJ 
The "left-wing radicals," Mr., 
Svestka wrote, 'tend to oper-
ate with force and power rath-
er than with reason." In an, 
'allusion td police-state proced-
ures, the Tribuna editor added 
.that the party must never at-
tempt "to break a person's 
character," but must give ev-
eryone a chance to correct past 
mistakes. 
Analysts read the Tribuna ar= 
tide as a deflittion of the moth 
jerately conservative line that 
the embattled Dr. Husak is 
pounding.

1Czech Ultraconservatives Are 
- 
Gaining in the Party's Rank and File 
By PAUL HOFMANN 
Speclol to no New Tort 71mto 
VIENNA, Dec. 9 ? Reports 
reaching here from Czechosl& 
vakia indicate that ultracon-
servatives are gaining ground 
among the Communist party's 
rank and file, causing concer 
In the conservative Pragu 
leadership and even, in Mo 
cow. 
The new extremists w d 
put the clock back to the Sta-
linist era, while the conservis: 
tives, who at present dominate 
the Communist party appa. 
ratus, vow that despite their 
fight against the liberal teal 
dencies of the progressiveR 
there will be "no return" t 
the police state methods of th 
l 
nineteen-fifties. 
According to well - informed 
diplomats in Eastern capitals, 
Soviet ideologists are afraid 
that ultraconservative gains 
may prove fertile ground for, 
he infiltration of pro-Chinese 
tendencies. 
The new left-wing radicals; 
known as ultras, are pressing, 
or ever broader purges to?exl 
Pel from the party all those 
who at some time in the past 
advocated liberal reforms or 
were critical of the Soviet Un-
ion, and are demanding pun-
ishment of the leaders of last 
year's reform movement under 
41exander Dubcck. 
The conservatives who pre-
*ail in the present leadership 
and in the party apparatus 
stress that even those who for 
a few weeks or. months as 
year backed the reform moves, 
ment may remain in the party 
if they were "honest," engaged 
in self-criticism, and supported 
the current pro-Moscow line. - 
Ant-intellectualism and thin-
ly veiled anti - Semitism are 
rampant at Czechoslovak party 
cell meetings these days, Infor-
mants say. 
The rabble is taking over," 
a Czech who professes to be a 
progressive but who still holds 
party membership, said during 
a short visit here recently. q 
He told of a routine meeting 
of the party cell in a Prague 
district that he had attended. 
He said that the meeting had 
been dominated by tirades 
against suspected liberals and - 
that he himself had felt iso-, 
ated. 
"Names were named, and 
whenever one had a Jewish 
ring to it, there was laughter 
and jeering," the, visitor re-
called. 
He said that the name of 
Mr. Dubcek was repeatedly 
pronounced by speakers in a 
derisive way, and every time 
several people in the audience 
shouted 'Try him for treason!" 
"This is not the proletariat 
that is gaining control," the 
visiting Communist said. "It is 
the lumpenproletariat." This 
German term, meaning ragtag 
proletariat, is Marxist parlance 
denoting classless riffraff. 
According to information 
from other reliable sources, 
hardline extremism is sweep-
ing also many other organiza-
tions of the Communist paity 
in Bohemia and Moravia, while 
many moderates stay away 
from cell meetings and fail to 
pay membership fees.

Informed Czechoslovaks es-
timate that party membership 
baa shrunk, frorh more thin 
million two years ago to little 
more than a Million. Czeclioj 
slovakia's population is about! 
14 million. 
Assessments by informed, 
Czechoslovaks and foreign ex-, 
perts vary widely as to how' 
strong the liberal, conserva-
tives and new radical factions 
are. The leadership implicitly 
acknowledged the disarray 
in the party last week by 
announcing that its long-de-
layed national congress, theo-, 
retically the supreme party 
body, would not be convened 
efore 1971. 
Curiously, the party base In 
Slovakia, which remained con-
sistently more conservative 
throughout last year's liberalf-' 
zation phase, now Is compara-
tively more moderate than the' 
Bohemian-Moravian rank and 
file. 
Rank-and-file pressure appar-
ently has set off a new wave( 
of purges in Bohemia and Mo-
ravia, the Czech lands. Party 
officials who replaced liberals' 
after the Soviet-led invasion In 
August, 1968, are now being' 
removed from their posts in 
the new extremist groundswell. 
The party magazine Zivot 
Strany (party life) disclosed 
last week that in northern Mo-
ravia 335 members of local par.; 
ty committees had recently, 
been removed from their posts 
on charges of "right-wing op-

SPedol to The New York Times 
VIENNA, Nov. 21?Alois In-
&a, a leading pro-Soviet con-
servative, returned to Prague 
today after a four-day visit to 
Budapest amid reports that the 
Czechoslovak Communist re-
gime was seeking Hungarian 
support against hard-line ex-
tremists at home. 
Mr. Indra, a secretary of the 
Czechosqjvak communist par-
ty's Central Committee, con-
ferred with Janos Kadar, first 
secretary of the ? Hungarian 
Communist party, and other 
members of the Hungarian rul-
ing Politburo. No mention was 
made of the topics discussed. 
However, analysts of Com-
munist affairs here noted that 
Mr. Indra went to Budapest 
even as the Hungarian party 
press was publishing clear 
warnings against extremist ex-
cesses in Czechoslovakia. In one 
instance earlier this week, the 
main hungarian party organ, 
Nepszabadsag, quoted an un-
identified Prague Communist as 
deploring "rough, terroristic 
and inhuman methods" used by 
hard-liners in the party. 
The choice of Mr. Indra for 
a mission to Budapest was held 
to be significant. the 48-year-
old former Transport Minister, 
is believed to have the abso-
lute trust of Russian officials. 
He was one of a group of three 
men that the Kremlin reported-
ly wanted to set up a new re-
gime in Prague after the So-
viet-led invasion of Aug. 21, 
1968. The other members of the 
pro-Moscow group were Vasil 
Bilak and Drahomir Kolder, 
both influential in the present 
Prague leadership. 
Gustav Husak, the First Sec-
retary of the Czechoslovak 
Communist party, has professed 
complete loyalty to the Soviet 
Union. However, he has repeat-
edly emphasized that he was 
not an ultraconservative. 
In one of the frequent policy 
shifts within the Prague leader-
ship, Mr. Indra has aligned him-
self lately with Mr. Husak and 
has acquired a reputation for 
comparative moderation. 
It is thought that Mr. Husak 
asked Mr. Indra to go to Buda-
pest to enlist the assistance of 
the relatively moderate Hunga-
rian Communist regime against 
Czechoslovak conservative ex-
tremists who are said to be 
trying to discredit him in Com-
munist capitals, Mr. Indra 
would be well qualified for such 
an assignment because of his 
excellent standing in Moscow.

Prague Acknowledges Unpublicized 
Holding of Some Political Foesi 
By PAUL HOFMANN 
SPectal tom. New Y6rk Times 
VIENNA, Nov. 29 ? Thel 
Czechoslovak authorities implic-j 
itly acknowledged today that1 
sornt of their opponents were 
in jail by announcing that one 
of them had been transferred to 
A hospital because of illness. 
The prisoner was identified 
as Vladimir Skutina, a televi-: 
sion commentator and author 
who, after his dismissal from 
the state network earlier this 
year, had continued defying the 
now leadership. 
The Party newspaper Rude 
Fravo reported that Mr. Sku-i 
tine had been released from 
prison under a court order of 
Nov. 11 and taken to a Prague 
hospital. 
The arrest of Mr.. Skutina 
after demonstrations marking 
the first anniversary of the 
1968 invasion was never offi-
cially reported. According to 
private information, Mr. Sku-
tina developed stomach ulcers 
in Pankrac prison. Other 
sources say he has cancer. ? 
It is not known whether any, 
formal charges have beent 
brought against him. Reliable, 
Prague informants say that 
scores of other political prison-j 
e:s are being held in Pankrac'

Prison without any indication 
as to when, or whether, they 
will be brought to trial. 
Mr. Skutina's last book, pub-
lished earlier this year, was 
titled "Prisoner of the Presi-
dent." It told of what its author 
saw and suffered during a year 
In jail on political charges un* 
der Antonin Novotny. 
Political Trials Barred 
The present leaders have 
pledged that no political trials 
will be held. 
One of several dissident In-
tellectuals who were arrested 
with Mr. Skutina and are still 
in jail is Ludes Paclunan,

'chess champion and writer. It 
is known that he went on a 
hunger strike in September and 
again last month. Friends say 
that he is now taking food 
again. 
Mr. Pachman and Mr. Skutina 
aroused the anger of the new 
conservative party leaders by 
maintaining contacts with pro-
gressive groups in factories in 
Prague and other industrial 
areas. 
Pankrac Prison is also an in-
terrogation center for political 
suspects who are still techni-
cally free.

formation from Prague. is Maj. 
Gen. Vaclav Prchlik, former 
political chief of the army and 
head of the security department 
of the party's Central Commit-
tee. He is under orders to re-
port every other day to the

? leged anti-Soviet attitudes.

of Mao Tse-tung, the British-
owned South China Sunday 
Post-Herald said. 
How Far Will He Go? 
There are signs that Mr Husak may yet inflict the ultimate 
weapon of repression?political trials?on Czechoslovakia 
A cartoon in a Prague paper early this year showed a 
depressed-looking man announcing on television: "We shall 
not permit a return to the pre-January cra?if only to make 
sure that January doesn't come again.' That reference to the 
period before Mr Novotny's overthrow in January, 1968, 
was made before Mr Husak took over. For a short time after 
Mr Husak's succession it was possible to believe that this still 
represented his attitude. Nobody could call Mr Husak.a pro-
gressive, but he had been a victim of Mr Novotny's police. 
Today, however, it is no longer possible to feel that there 
is nothing worse! in store for the Czechs. The repression they 
are suffering mai), yet move on to a series of political trials. 
It looks as if Mt Husak and his colleagues may be heading 
back to the bad old days before Mr Novotny fell?not, of 
course, in order to provoke a reaction by the liberals, but to 
make sure that the liberals will not lift their heads again. They 
arc frightened both of the Russians and of their own people; 
and, as is so often the way with frightened men, their instinct 
is to give way slavishly to those above them and ruthlessly 
repress those below. 
Mr Husak ought to be able to feel that hc has done enough 
to satisfy the Russians. He has purged and purged again?
the party, the administration, the press and pretty well every-
thing else that matters. He has imposed a rigorous censorship 
on the written, spoken and televised word ; black is white and 
the moon is still made of blue cheese. About 750 non-
conforming journalists are now said to be out of work. And 
the Russians have wen it all, and apparently thought that it 
was good. Last month they invited Mr Husak and his 
collaborators to Moscow and treated them like prodigal sons. 
But there was a snag. Mr Husak, for all the feasting and 
speechifying, went home virtually empty-handed. Ile took t 
with him neither a promise of the kind of economic help 
that the Czechs really need?a substantial hard currency 
loan?nor any promise that the Soviet occupying forces will 
bc reduced, let alone withdrawn. There was nothing there * 
that might help to reconcile the Czechs and Slovaks to their 
bleak future. On the contrary, he took with him a broad hint 
?by no means the only one to be delivered before and after 
the visit to Moscow?that his country's forced march back 
into its dark past might have to go even farther than most 
people had thought. The joint statement issued at the end of 
the visit spoke of "carrying on to the end the struggle against 
right-wing opportunism." The clear implication was that the 
end had not yet been readied. 
Indeed it has not?not, at least, from the point of view of 
the Russians and the tiny handful of deep-dyed conservatives 
in Czechoslovakia who support them. Too many people are 
still refusing to knuckle under. There arc the students. The 
new students' union, set up to replace the banned pro-Dubcek 
union, is a resounding flop. This week the party paper Rude 
Pravo has complained of "exaggerated nationalism and anti-
Soviet trends" at the universities. Last weekend the authorities 
celebrated the 30th anniversary of the closing of the Czech 
universities by the Nazis; official spokesmen bitterly criticised 
the students who persisted in making embarrassing compari-
sons between the Nazis and today's occupying forces. 
Then 'there are the intellectuals. The various Czech 
" cultural " unions, of writers, artists, film-makers and so on, 
have proved so recalcitrant that Mr Bruzek, the Czech' 
minister of culture, has decided to by-pass them and deal

'ITALIAN REDS OUST 
.4 CHIEF DISSIDENTS 
Party's image as Democratic 
Force Found Damaged 
By ALFRED FRIENDLY Jr., 
Footle to Tho New York TITAN 
ROME, Nov. 29 Four 
leading dissidents have been 
ousted by the Communist party, 
an action that, according to in-
formed sources, has severely 
damaged its reputation as a 
, democratic force in Italy aqd 
has hurt its chances of joinhig 
center and left-wing politicians 
in an eventual coalition govern-
ment. 
The ouster ''has thrown a 
wrench into the works," com-
mented a Socialist Deputy, Ric-
cardo Lombardi, who has 
long been sympathetic to the 
idea of collaboration with the 
Communists. "The least you 
can say is that it does not 
make the unifying process any 
easier," he added, and a great 
deal of cold blood, patience 
and inventiveness will be 
necessary to move ahead with 
"restructuring the left." 
' Limited Horizons Found 
LONDON OBSERVER 
30 Nov, 1969 
What }flirts most, observers 
agree, is the Communists' in-
sistence on putting party dis-
cipline above the right of dis-
sent. The ousted rebels, three 
of them members of the Central 
Committee and two of them 
members of Parliament, de-
viated from party thinking by 
advocating that Communists 
work with revolutionary lett-
ering groups to overthrow the 
existing system rather than 
Maneuver for power within It. 
The declaration that such a 
line is heretical should have 
reinforced the Communists' 
stature as would-be democrats. 
Instead, said a left-wing 
Christian Democrat, Livio 
Labor, a former union leader, 
the decision shows "a desire 
to slow down the process of 
reorganizing the left" and re-
vealed that the Communists 
are a party of limited horizons 
without enough courage to Join 
the "new social forces that 
want to struggle to change 
the country seriously." 
The Central Committee 
members ousted ? after a 
haastily curtailed debate ? 
are Aldo Natoli, a surgeon who 
has five times been elected to 
the Chamber of Deputies from 
Rome: Luigi Pintor, a Roman 
journalist who won a parlia-
mentary seat in Sardinia in 
the 1968 elections, and Rossana 
Rossanda, a publicist who 
served from 1963 to 1968 as a 
Deputy from Milan. 
She and Lugio Magri, whi. 
also lost his party standing, 
are co-editors- of an in-
creasingly popular left-wing 
monthly, II Manifesto, for whic 
the whnle group of .rebels has 
come to be named. 
After ? only four issues 
Manifesto, a 64-page, 65-cent 
magazine commenting on the 
political scene and on revolu-
tionary experiences in Cuba and 
China, has scored what are for 
Italy phenomenal circulation 
gains. Its fourth edition sold 
40,000 copies and its latest 
number, published two weeks 
ago, promptly sold out 45,000 
and went into a second print-
ing. 
New Historical Bloc' 
In the November issue the 
editors said Italy's "social 
crisis" called for the forma-
tion of "a new historical bloc" 
no longer based on outdated 
traditions. To effect radical 
transformation of the system, 
they said, in the language more 
popular with the student move-
ment and the antiunion fringe 
groups among industrial work-
ers than it is with the Com-
munist party, "new organisms 
of power from the base" are 
necessary. 
Alessandro Natta, Com-
munist Deputy who presented 
the demand to the Central rem-
mittee for ousting the Manifesto 
k1roup asserted: "We said we 
would be willing to fight their 
likes, but inside the party, 
and its institutional structure. 
They have refused our request

MOSCOW, Dec. 10?The So-
viet Union publicly intervened 
In the affairs of a Western 
Communist party today. A 
Pravda editorial officially en-
dorsed the suspension of a 
three-member faction by the 
Italian party. 
Such interventions are rare. 
Communist sources suggested 
that this one was really an at-

ty?disaffected with Soviet

structure - and a pro-Moscow. 
position. 
Other informed observers 
said it might also be an at-
tempt to revive the fortunes 
of the desiccated pro-Moscow 
"right wing" of the Italiars, 
party. 
The sources agreed that the 
endorsement was certainly not 
sought by Luigi Longo and 
other top leaders of the Ital-
ian party, that it took a 
stronger position than the 
Italian partra own statements 
' and that it might boomerang 
,and help the so-called Italian 
Communist liberals and fur 
:ther impair the unity of the 
,Communist movement.

, Last month the Central 
!Committee of the Italian Com-
rnunist Party "excluded" Ros-
ana Rosanda, Aldo Natoli and 
Luigi Pintor. They are Com-

Parliament who publish a 
'magazine caned II Manifesto. 
;The. journal rejects Moderate 
'tactics and wants to revive 
:"the sense of revolution as a 
rupture and overthrow of the 
existing order." It also calls 
for workers' councils, in which 
it may be as much ,Titoist as 
Maoist. 
These views impugned the 
,attempts of the Italian party 
to join a coalition government 
with socialist and 'perhaps 
even "bourgeois" parties. .

The editorial called the posi-

the Italian partyathe Commu-

countries and the Soviet

It called the group's activi-

"the Leninist principle of

The extension of party influence into all spheres is taking place 
here also. Taking a critical attitude to neo-Stalinist "normalization" 
in the CSR is being. prevented. Not even critical remarks of fraternal 
parties are being published or talked about. The British party has asked: 
"Where is proof of the alleged counter-revolution in the CSR? Which CIA 
agents or other diversionists have been offered to the public? The 
elected leaders of party and state were arrested." But access to such 
information is prevented here. 
Our attitude in public is being held against us, as presumably being 
against the party interests. The now prevelant "hard" line is against the 
vital interests of the party by its practical exclusion of (the opinions of) 
exponents of other than the prevelant opinion. If you continue in this veih9 / 
you will soon be standing all alone. Your majority in the party will be

LE MONDE, Paris 
28 November 1969 
Testimony from a "Progressive" Leader: "Normalization" 
Marks the Decline of the Party 
One of the principal personalities of the progressive current 
in the Austrian P.C. sent a letter to us, asking that his name not 
be mentioned, from which we have extracted the principal passages: 
"Austria is a small world on the stage of which the big world holds 
1t8 rehearsals." This quotation from Hebbel was used last year in 
gonnection with the small Austrian Communist Party whose ranks never cease 
to diminish and in which is reflected the crisis of the communist movement. 
The party had attracted attention well beyond the national borders during 
its nineteenth congress in 1965. Lowering the curtain on its past, it 
decided to renew its leadership and elaborated a program of "Italian" 
inspiration. 
The progressive forces within the party had succeeded in obtaining 
these changes only because the dominant group in the apparatus had not yet 
realized the full significance of the ouster of Khrushchev. When this was 
accomplished, a systematic resistance against the new orientation began to 
show itself, essentially in documents unrelated to any political practice. 
This action was sufficient, however, to give a feeling of the growing 
pressure from the "friends." Written in German, these publications provoked 
a responsive echo in the GDR and the traditions and ties dating from the 
monarchy assured them a growing interest in Prague and in Budapest. The 
attacks were concentrated on Ernst Fischer, the most outstanding personality 
of the party and one of the most important of the workers? movement since 
the Second World War. 
The springtime in Prague permitted the progressives, for the most part 
personal friends of the Prague reformers, to go over to the offensive. The 
party saluted the program of the Czech communists, sent messages to Dubcek, 
and after 21 August the central committee condemned the invasion; the 
spokesmen of the apparatus were not present at the sessions. The Austrian 
Communist Party equally took the initiative in asking for the convoking, of 
a conference of communist parties from Western Europe. This proposal ran 
into the refusal of the French Communist Party. 
The pressure which began at this moment did not cease to increase, 
occasioning open polemics with the GDR and the Soviet Union, who con-
centrated their attacks on Ernst Fischer.. Our party soon resembled a broken 
mirror reflecting the "normalization" in Czechoslovakia. All possible 
strategems and manipulations were used, a publication paid for out of the 
account for developmental aid to a "friendly" country was utilized for this 
work inside the party -- its first issue was directed against Ernst Fischer, 
its second against Franz Marek, the spokesman of the progressive forces --

finally, a congress of the party was prepared, which was held in January 
and revenged itself on the preceding congress. 
Immediately after this congress proceedings were instituted against 
Ernst Fischer under the pretext of an interview on the radio. The 
arbitration commission (average age seventy years) decided in May on the 
expulsion of Ernst Fischer. A majority of the central committee refused 
to ratify this decision. In October the arbitration commission, by six 
votes against four, again pronounced itself in favor of expulsion, which 
can now be annuled only by a party congress. Twenty seven members of the 
central committee publicly protested against this decision which was as 
sGupid as it was suicidal. 
This public protest could hardly be more than a fight for honor. The 
expulsion of Ernst Fischer was followed by numerous withdrawals and 
resignations. The decline of the Austrian Communist Party is inexorable. 
In the elections even some communists do not vote for the party. 
The expulsion of Ernst Fischer had been preceded by another act, less 
spectacular but just as symptomatic of the "Husakization" of the party. 
The publication of the communist intellectuals, Tagebuch, had been run out 
of the party office building after it had refused to submit to censorship. 
Our party, which had once awakened interest, finds itself isolated 
and without hope. It has always had trouble in becoming a power and no 
longer has any chance of being considered as democratic and progressive. 
It will continue, however, to participate in future conferences of 
communist parties. This presence seems to be the only thing which counts 
for the partisans of "normalization."

party, director of the Center of Maricist Studies and Research (CERM),

conflict which opposes him and his party on the subject of Czechoslovakia. 
After having recalled his point of view -- "the socialism that I wish 
for is not that imposed by Brezhnev on Czechoslovakia" -- he declared: 
"I am not in disaccord with the program, the objectives, and the policy 
of my party, otherwise I would resign. It is possible that I may be ex-
uded from the political bureau and from the central committee of my party, 
ut I would then insist on continuing to serve it as a simple soldier. I 
wish, however, that it will be possible for each person to be able to express 
himself in full liberty within the party."

In expressing himself on television 
MR. ROGER GARAUDY "COMFIRMS HIS OPPOSITION TO THE PRINCIPLES 
OF DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM" 
writes l'Humanite 
L'Humanite on Saturday morning returned to the subject of the 
statements made Thursday evening by Mr. Roger Garaudy, member of the 
political bureau of ti* communist party, on the televised program 
"Panorama" and writes: 
"The French Radio and television Organization broadcasts at length the 
speeches of Chanban-Delman, of Debre, of Poujade and all the other anti-
communist attacks. It was not to an expose of the policy of the communist 
party that "Panorama" consecrated its broadcast of Thursday evening, but 
to an interview with Roger Garaudy. It is very necessary to stress the 
singular character of this interview. Once again it is by a book, 
published during the preparations for a party congress, that Roger Garaudy 
expresses his point of view. He confirms in it his opposition to the 
analyses and conclusions at which the collective organs of the leadership 
have arrived; he confirms in it, despite his denigrations, his opposition 
to the principles of democratic centralism. 
But one who wishes to prove too much risks proving nothing at all. 
Obliged to recognize that he has always been able freely to express himself 
in the political bureau of the central committee, Roger Garaudy had nontheless 
said nothing about the fact that the central committee has decided to open, 
as it has done before each congress, in the party and in its press, the 
preparatory discussion for the congress on the basis of the draft theses 
adopted by the central committee. Roger Garaudy, member of the political 
bureau, has the right to express his opinion there on this. Which is what 
the secretary general of the party invited him to do at the meeting of the 
central committee of last 13-14 October. In effect, Waldeck Rochet said 
then: 'I wish, in the name of our political bureau, that Garaudy would 
change his attitude, that is that he defend the policy of the party and 
participate, like all the militants and members of the party, in the 
preparation of the nineteenth congress in the framework Of the principles 
which rule the party and of its statutory regulations.? But it is 
regrettable that once again Roger Garaudy prefers the publicity of bad 
quality which television obligingly accords him."

LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, Paris 
20-26 October 1969 
Before the Central Committee at Ivry, Roger Garaudy Asked 
the Right Questions. Nobody Answered Them. 
By - Jean Geoffroy 
Because he is luckier than Alexander Dubcek, Roger Garaudy 
is still a member of his-party's Political Bureau. But he will 
have only 4 months' respite. On 8 February next, the 19th Con-
gress of the French Communist Party, meeting at Nanterre, will 
"forget" to include his name among those of the members of the 
Central Committee, which will undoubtedly have a number of new 
'faces on it, if only because there have been practically no 
,changes in its makeup since the last Congress was held in Tann-
1967. 
Garaudy's two speeches to the Ivry CC last Wednesday are, 
at least at this level, his swan song. They highlighted not only 
:his isolation -- even Aragon was silent, although he had first 
made sure that there would be no immediate sanctions imposed on 
Garaudy -- but also the degree to which the problems he raised 
are currently bothering the leadership of the French CP. 
It is not mere happenstance that the hardest attacks on 
the director of the Center for Marxist Studies and Research were 
mounted, at the Ivry session, by spokesmen for the Stalinist 
old guard, like Loon Feix and Andre Stil, the former editor-in-
chief of Humanita, who distinguished himself in 1956 with his . 
commentariei?a?The events in Budapest. The younger generation 
in the Political Bureau, although it has failed to back Garaudy9 
is more circumspect. Roland Leroy, Reno Andrieu, Rena Piquet. 
and Paul Laurent took no part in the debate. They left it to 
Waldeck Rochet to deliver the only party reply to the Garaudy 
charges to see publication. 
"If we were to follow Garaudy..."  
As he voiced them in his initial speech, and then in re-
ply to the several rebuttal speeches9 his views bear chiefly 
on three points. 
1. Tho events in Czechoslovakia should induce French 
communists to question themselves more probingly than they have 
hitherto on the matter of their relations with the Soviet Union. 
Waldeck Rochet's reply: 
'Once again, Garaudy is trying to exploit the events in 
Czechoslovakia to help anti-Sovietism and the opportunist' 
cliques."

2. The international communist conference that met last 
June in Moscow adopted a document that provides no answer to 
a number of fundamental problems (such as that of the indivi-
dual paths each country chooses to move toward socialism), and 
contains no valid analysis of the present situation in the cap-. 
italist countries. 
Waldeck Rodhet's reply: 
"If we wereto follow Garaudy, we should be aggravating 
the dissension within the international communist'movement and 
Its weakening, askwell as the division within our own party, 
to the advantage or imperialism and of the class enemy..." 
3. The prespt principles of organization of the French 
gommunist Party pr4vent any meaningful debate on these problems 
as a whole.. 
Wladeck Rochet's reply: 
"Garaudy frequently violates the principles of organiza-
tion. He has publicly made statements contrary to the party's 
policy in a Yugoslav newspaper, statements which have been 
picked up by a great many bourgeois newspapers. He cannot 
therefore be overly surprised by our response." 
The condemnation is clear, although the Secretary-General 
thought it wise to add that he hoped "that Garaudy will change 
his attitude, that is that he will defend Party policy and will 
be kind enough to join with all militants and Party members in 
preparing for the 19th Congress." 
This discussion took up several hours of the second day 
of the CC meeting, although it was not originally on the agenda. 
It would be a mistake to conclude from this that the Garaudy 
problem is one of the Party's central concerns. This is merely 
the crystallization of a more complex debate which the French \ 
CP clearly does not dare to plunge straight into, but which it 
is finding more and more difficult to dodge: without breaking 
its privileged ties with the Soviet CP (which nobody, for that 
matter, has asked it to do), can the French CP run the risk of 
disagreeing with the "Soviet comrades" by committing itself on 
a practical level to the definition of a French path to social-
ism? 
Of course, on 21 August 1968, the French communist leaders 
expressed their disagreement with the Soviets. This is no minor H. 
thing, nor is the fact that that disagreement is still remembered 
today, even when the new team on the government in Prague is re-
vising the opinions formulated when the Warsaw Pact troops were 
actually invading Czechoslovakia. But, important as that recol-
lection is, it does not answer one burning question: what does \ 
the French CP think of the total obliteration of what Mr. Waldeck 
Rochet himself called "the justified changes made in Czechoslovakia'

in January 1968," which, he adds, his party "assessed and found 
desirable?" One seeks in vain for the slightest token of an 
answer in the speeches made before the Central Committee at Ivry. 
This is the same question which Alain Savary's Socialist 
Party plans to pose to the Communist Party in the dialogue which 
:will shortly be opened between the two organizations. It would 
be surprising if the communists had been saving their real confi-
dences on such an issue for the socialists, and this is why it 
Is highly unlikely that any such debate will get very far. In 
his speech, Georges Frischmann, like Waldeck Rochet in his con-
cluding address, referred to that dialogue without enthusiasm, 
and indicated that it would deal with quite different issues. 
1The Mitterand Method  
It is precisely because he believes that this can be no-
ithing more than a dialogue of the deaf that Frangois Mitterand 
,advocates another method. Starting with the assumption that 
the present balance of power, which is too unfavorable to the 
non-communist left, merely strengthens the French CP in its ri-
gidity, the former president of the Left Federation thinks that, 
before engaging in any dialogue whatever, it would be well to 
go back to the grass roots and recreate that rank-and-file drive 
for unity that made it possible, from 1965 to 1967, to reach 
at least the beginning of an agreement with the Communist Party 
on a common program. He refuses to entertain the notion -- and 
he gives his reasons at some length in his book, "Ma part de 
verit6" rMy Share of Truth3 -- that the events in Prague have 
made it forever impossible to reach an understanding with the 
French CP. 
The Party is faced with two different appeals one is an 
abstract and delicate dialogue with its traditional partner, the 
Socialist Party,and the other is a more practical confrontation 
with a partner whose loyalty it appreciates, but which looks 
very much like a competitor on the unity turf. 
The Ivry Central Committee session provided no enlighten-
ment on this point, either. We shall have to wait for the 
"theses" of the February Congress, which will be published in 
the next few weeks, to find out whether the present leadership , 
of the Communist Party really intends to make even the beginning 
of an answer to both these questions.

parcc qu'il nc l'a guere ete lors du 
dernier congres, en janvier 1967. 
Les deux interventions que Garau-
dy a fakes mercredi dernier dcvant 
le comite central d'Ivry sont done, 
cc niveau du moms, son chant du 
cygne. Elics ont demontre non seu-

meme est demeure silencieux, apres 
avoir, cepcndant, obtenu l'assurance 
qu'auctme sanction immediate ne se-
mit prise contre Garaudy ? mais 
aussi a quel point les problems qu'il 
pose preoccupent un grand nombre 
des dirigeants du P.C.F. 
Cc n'est pas tut itasard si les prin-

Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches 
marxistes ont ete pottees, a cette ses-

2) La conference internationale 
communiste reunie a Moscou en juin 
dernier a adopte un document qui 
n'apporte aucunc reponse a des pro-
blemcs fondamentaux (comme celui 
des differentes votes adoptees par cha-

3) Les principes actuels d'organisa-

Reponse de Waldeck - Rochet 
Garaudy viole frequemment ces

s'etonner de noire reponse. lr 
La condamnation est donc claire, 
.hien que le secretaire general ait cru 
bon. d'ajouter qu'il souhaitait que 
Garaudy change d'attitude, c'est-a-

de plus en plus difficile d'eluder : 
sans romprc ses liens privilegies avec 
le P.C. de l'IJ.R.S.S. (cc que personne

UkIR-DEBAT, Paris (Dissident Communist bulletin) 
10 September 1969 
The Resignation of Comrade Francis Halbwachs 
Comrade Francis Halbwachs, Professor at the Marseille Faculty of 
Sciences, who came into the Party during the German occupation, 
has resigned from the Party. 
Our position is well-known on the necessity of remaining in the 
ranks of the French CP as much as possible to work for its reha-
bilitation and to avoid giving the Stalinist bureaucrats the sa-
tisfaction of a voluntary departure. 
However, Comrade Halbwaths's brother had just been unjustly re-
moved from the Party, and we all know there are circumstances 
when resignation becomes the only step possible. 
We publish Comrade Francis Halbwachs's letter of resignation to 
the Central Committee of the Party through the kindness of com-
rades who were good enough to pass it on to us. [Text followsi 
Comrades, 
Today I am sending you my resignation from the Party after 27 years 
during which I can truly say that the Party was at the center of my life. 
When I became a communist in 1942, it was not just to fight in the 
most effective way possible against the Nazi occupation. I had been a part 
of the '36 movement, I had read a lot and thought a lot, and had had complete-
ly formed my conviction that the fundamental fact of modern history and the 
source of all the values of our time was the struggle of the workers to des-
troy the capitalist regime and build a just and humane society, and that this 
struggle, the October Revolution and the building of socialism in the USSR 
constitute an essential stage. I still believe this, with many more reasons 
for doing so, more experience, more lucidity. 
that in the course of All I have been through I have gradually become 
convinced -- end today thin conviction is absolute -- that you are no longer 
capable of carrying on thin struggle, and that in our own country at least, 
the Communist Party has lost the capacity to direct the socialist revolution 
-name day, or even to participate in it. My conviction rests not upon affec-
tive reactions, but rather on reflection striving to be scientific in charac-
ter, nnd playing upon the phases of en evolutionary progress which I lived 
,through with the whole Party over many years, which I now believe myself 
capable of judging am a whole. 
This evolution was long and progressive, but the stages and breaks 
nrr clearly discernible. The most important one in my opinion, the one that 
reprements an irrevocnble turning-point, might be placed in time around 
1T-6-57.

v?an thn period of the XX Conprese, where everything was revealed 
h,dOna benenth the m7th of the Soviet model of secialism and 
0-teeUeurn nf Ole Party-enide. The Congress wnn soon followed by the 
-i-own Of: the doctrinal and organic unity of the international communint 
Flevement. 'Mete revelations and this breakdown called into question the vory 
frAmdations of what had up td that time been our mode of thought (dogmatic) 
pnd our form of party government (centralist). It would have been a first 
eacity to bring ahot A radical change in our principles in these two do-
. mAinn. Now you obstinritely refuted to enter into the necessary self-criticism 
.oad instead gave yourself over. to denunciation of those among us who were 
. t:7ing to begin a change in direction. 
This was also the time of the major choices on the for of struggle 
against French imperialism and colonialism in connection with tho war in 
,hLgeria. At a time when that was called for was courageoue committal to 
a.dangerous combat! -- against the dominant chauvinist and racist 
cLirrent, aiming for the ineluctnble victory of tho Algerian people, you pre-
::-,-rred to yield to the current and abandon to their fate the young people 
who wore leaving for the war, and sacrifice the opportunities for struggle 
to the great Thorom project of an alliance with the socialiet ecu m -- a pro-
ct which enjoyed the cuccess everyone knows. It has been since this time 
tbat you have been obnonned by the fear of being outflanked On your left, 
which hoe brought you further and further over to the right. From then on, 
due to lack of confidence in the Party and the masses, you have refused 
battle on every occaeion -- even tho moot favorable ones -- to the point 
that the most serioun defeat the French bourgeoieie hen endured since the 
war ultimately became the occasion for conoolidating its ttrength. 
From then on, subject to a pitilese dialectic, you got ever further 
hogried down in your errorz, which you pronounced as truths for fear your in-
allibility nicht be called into question (an Lenin said, a party may be 
t7s.ken neriouely according to its attitude toward its cwn mietakes). Thun 
it wan that you caue-nd the Party to conceal into the imago it hae today: 
struCture eri rncia1-e,7=ocrat relicy. 
However the year just past has marked a new stage and a new disin-
tegration, and it is essentially due to the events of this year that I feel 
compelled to break with you, not only because of a new net of negative traits 
in you which it brought to light, but chiefly because of positive traits and 
new hopes which have appeared -- outside your fold. 
Let us first speak of the events in Czechoslovakia. It is quite clear 
that in the statement you boast about on every occasion (especially around 
Guy Mollet), you deliberately passed the question by. The principle of "non-
interference" you invoke is contrary to internationalism and the very nature 
of the communist movement. Ever since the October Revolution the communist 
movement has drawn the essence of its doctrine from a position taken on what 
has been accomplished in the country (or countries) of socialism. The open 
debate in Czechoslovakia since last January is in the category of those you 
should take sides in, clearly and before the Party and the French workers. 
It is a debate on fundamental issues, and one which basically concerns us: 
for decades on end we have prnclaimed our passionate attachment to a socia-
list form of government which rejected and suppressed -- especially among 
communists -- all freedom of expresaion and communication of ideas, in which 
0. group of bosses arrogated to themselves the right to impose upon a wholo 
INT-10 VV. I. 
4.?

nation what they must think, and sent to prison or penal servitude hundreds 
of thousands of people for crimes of opinion arbitrarily so characterized 
by a police apparatus. It is true that for the last few years you have given 
lip-service to different principles, but without the slightest shred of self.. 
criticism, as if you all had always been irreproachable models of democracy. 
This year, for the ,first time within the heart of the communist movement, a 
party has frankly and by deeds repudiated the practises of bureaucratic so-
cialism and has struck out in the direction of freedom and democracy, which 
is precisely the one that suits the traditions and aspirations of the wor-
king people of our country. The armies of the neo-Stalinist states are shat-
tered by the power 44 this attempt. You protest about the form, you say 
nothing about the fundamentals, but then you go on to affirm your solidarity 
with the "brother parties" and you get ready to proclaim jointly with them 
a community of doctrine at the next Moscow conference. 
I tell you here and now that I am leaving you because I want to have 
nothing further in common with the Brezhnevs and Motchars, and that I am per-
lsuaded that the only chance socialism has in France, the path of hope opened 
4o us by our Czech comrades, depends upon a resolute break with the theories 
lOnd practices of the heirs of Stalin. 
Finally there were revolutionary events in May and June of 1968. Up 
to that point one might have thought that the deplorable level and lack of 
outlook in the Party's activities, going from annoying subscriptions to 
dreary election campaigns, was in all nothing but the reflection of the gene-
ral attitude of a working class infected with bourgeois psychology, bogged 
down in the alienations of a consumer civilization. That is why everyone was 
taken aback by the impetuous uprising, which started in the universities and 
passed down to the entire working class, the most powerful movement in the 
,antiro social history of cur country. You absolutely failed to foresee this 
!Mevellent. Pecauao it did not enter into your plans -- in all their grand 
:.strategy -- because it hod not been unleashed at your command -- a command 
vhich for nese timo has been incapable of unleashing anything -- you deli-
berately ignored the epontaneously revolutionary force and you denntured it, 
pretending to see nothing core in it than mere wage demands. You were not 
satisfied until everything got back in order and you were able to get back 
into your electioneering routine, end we can see right now what a sordid 
'impose? that has brought us to, for lack of any effective mass action .. ac-
tion you took such pains tc dcmobilize, among other things by your incredible 
:decision of I May lent. 
However, for many authentic communists -- and I am one of those --
whose phobia for little splinter groups does not hide the mermen in motion, 
:the days of 1963 completely changnd the outlook. We now know what a fermi-
!dablo revolutionary force lies in the power of the working claen and the 
youth of our country, a force which in May and June began to take on a 
rdiffused ewarenese of its own aspirationo. Henceforth it in thin force and 
'these aspirations that will be the target of our hopes and efforts, whatever 
our sclerotic machine may turn into. My personal intention is to use them as 
'point of departure for the tank of doctrinal intensification and development 
of the Marxism to which I will devote myself from now on. 
have the firm conviction that outside your orbit and in spite lot 
the movement born in May and Juno 1968 will develop, rationalize itself,

Parti, apres vingt-sept ans pendant lesquels je pais 
dire ,que le Patti a ete au centre de ma vie. 
Lorsque je suis devenn communise en 1942, ce 
n'etail pas settlement pour tuner le plus ejficace-
meat possible icontre Woccupation wazie. J'avais 
participe au mouvemeni de 36, beaucoup lu et re-
flichi, et entierement forme. ma conviction que le

et Ia source de Louses les valetas de noire temps

gime capitaliste et construire tine societe piste et 
hurricane, et que de cette tulle, la Revolution d'Oc-
tobre et la construction du socialisme en U.R.S.S. 
constituaient une elope essentielle. Je le crois en-
core. avec beaucoun Was de raisons de le eroire, 
plus d'experience, plus de hicidite. 
Mats, a trailers tout cc que j'ai .vectz, le me suis 
pen a pen convaincu ? et aujourd'hui cette con-
viction est cli-Folue ? que VOUS etes desornmis 
incagables de mener cette lutte, et que, dans notre 
pays tout au moms, le 'Para Communiste a perdu 
definitivement la capacita de diriger Lin four la 
revolution socialiste, peut-etre meme d'y prendre 
part. Ma conviction repose, non sur des reactions 
affectives, mais sur une reflexion qui cherche a 
tre scientifique et qui porte sur les phases d'une 
evolution que fat vecue avec tout le Path pendant 
beaucoup d'annees ,et sur laquelle je crois pouvoir 
maintenant porter un jugement d'ensemble. 
Celle evolution a et?ongue et progressive, mats 
on pent y deceler des elopes et des ruptares. 1.,a 
plus importanle, is mon avis, retie qui a ea en 
fait In valeur d'un aiguillage irrevocable, pent etre 
sititee vers les annees 1956-57. 
C'est l'epoque da XX' Congres, oa s'est revele 
tont cc qiti se cachait sous le tnythe du modete 
sovietique du socialisme et de 'excellence du Patti-
guide. Congres ideated staid par la rupture de 
l'unite doctrinale et organique du mouvement mu-
t/um/4e international. Ces revelations et cette rup-
ture meltaient en question les fondements meince 
de re qui avait ete jusqu'ici noire mode de pen-
see (dogmatique) et noire forme de direction (reit-
tratiste). 11 eat He vital de faire une mutation, 
tin changement radical de no principes dans ces 
deux domaines. Or vous irons etes obstinement re-
fuses our autocritiques necessaires, et consacres 
an contraire a la denonciation de ceux (Ventre 
nous qui essayaient d'amorcer le tournant. 
Crest aussi l'epoque des options majeures sur 
les formes de luttes contre l'imperialisme et ite 
colonialisme frangais en liaison avec la guerre 
d'Algerie. Alors qu'il aurait fallu engager cottrageu-
sement le combat ? un combat dangereua:! 
contre le courant dominant chativin et recite, en 
nusant sur l'ineluctable victoire du peuplz alge-
Hen, VOUS avez prefere ceder au column' aban.

les plus favorable. ? si bien que la pl:fs !guile 
defaite que la bourgeoisie frangaise all subie de-
puis la guerre lui a ete finalement l'occuszon de 
ren forcer son pouvoir. 
Des lors, soumis a une dialectiqtte impitoyable, 
vous vous etes enfonces de plus en plus dans vos

6 December 1969 
DESTRUCTION OF NAM NGUM DAM SOUGHT BY VIETNAMESE, LAOTIAN COMMUNISTS  
The peoples of Thailand, Laos, 
Cambodia and Vietnam are anxiously 
looking to the early)completion of 
the grand Mekong River Development 
Project from which these peoples 
will derive their progress and pros-
perity. This 50 billion dollar pro-1 
ject is designed to benefit the sup-
ply of electricity, tlip development 
Of water resources, iiiiigation, trans-
portation, agriculture, mining and 
fol4estry. 
Component projects in Thailand 
mpleted are the dams at Nam Pong 
d Nam Pung, and under construction 
is the dam of Nam Dom Noi at Ubon. 
And a bridge that will link Nong Khai 
with Vientiane by rail and motor ve-
hicles will soon be abuilding. 
The great Prek Thnot project in 
Cambodia, and the Nam Dong and Sodong 
projects in Laos are under construc-
tion. But among all the component 
projects, the Nam Ngum Dam stands out 
as the key to the various lower Mekong 
projects that are to follow upon its 
completion, because, of the importance 
of its location in the upper reaches 
of the river. 
The 31 million dollar expenses 
for the Nam Ngum project are borne 
by a number of nations; other nations 
taking part in the work include Austra-
lia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Holland, 
New Zealand, France, USA, U.K. and 
Thailand. Over 1,000 engineers, tech-
nicians and laborers are working at 
the site. In a future phase, the 
working force will be increased to 
2,500. Dam completion is set for 
1972. Thailand has donated 1.25 
million dollars worth of cement, and 
upon its completion, Thailand will 
get its electricity supply at a spe-
cial rate. 
1 
While the building of the dam 
is in progress, the North Vietnamese 
Arny and Laotian Communists (Pathet 
Lao) have continuously attacked the 
working area, one of the assaults foil:-
ing the working force to withdraw. Un-
ashamedly, the Pathet Lao radio an-
nounced the assault, at the same time 
vowed the destruction of the dam if 
it should be completed one day. Ob-
viously, the Mekong Development Pro. 
ject is not liked by the Communists 
and they use a smearing tactic in 
accusing the donors of embarking on 
a "money digging" venture. 
The Mekong Coordinating Committee 
met on the 23rd and 24th of August 
to discuss the protection of the Nam 
Ngum project from North Vietnamese 
Army and Pathet Lao attacks. Parti-
cipants in the meeting included 
Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Australia, 
Canada, France, UK, Israel, Japan, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, USA, an 
ECAFE representative, who together 
with U Thant, Sec-Gen of UN, cabled 
from UN Hqs in New York unanimously 
and strongly supporting the Laotian 
Government in its efforts to safe-
guard the workers at Nam Ngum. The 
participants in the Mekong project 
pointed out its importance to the well 
being of the peoples of Laos, as well 
as to those of the entire Mekong basin. 
Premier Souvanna Phouma of Laos 
has asked if the Secretary General of 
UN could approach the participating 
governments in the project underlining 
to them the importance and the inter-
national character of the project, and 
the desirability of establishing and 
respecting a neutral working zone. 
Prince Souvanna has indicated that he 
was willing to declare as neutral and 
inviolable a zone for a radius of 10 
kilometers around the dam site. If\

June 1968 
THE MEI(ONG SCHEME: GUIDELINE FOR A SOLUTION 
TO STRIFE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
W. R. DERRICK SEWELL 
,For more than 20 years Southeast Asia has been the scene of 
constant political turmoil. Civil wars have raged in almost every country 
in the region and guerrilla activity continues in most of them. In Vietnam 
conflict has exploded into one of the fiercest wars in the history of man-
kind, causing destruction and devastation on a massive scale. Tragically, 
too, the milipxy contest seems unlikely to solve any of the basic problems 
of the region. No matter what the eventual outcome, Southeast Asia will 
still be an Oka of abject poverty, and there will still be a compelling desire 
for political independence. At the same time there will still be considerable 
dependence on the rest of the world for assistance. 
Clearly there is no simple solution to these problems. Of all the attempts 
that have been made to deal with them so far, however, the Mekong scheme 
seems to have enjoyed the greatest and the most continuous success. Con-
ceived as a means of stimulating and facilitating economic change in the 
region, its achievements have gone well beyond this important goal. It has 
provided the people in the region with the opportunity to make decisions 
about their own future, and at the same time has provided them with 
the financial and technical aid they need to solve the problems that now 
confront them. It has stimulated cooperation among the nations in the 
region, an accomplishment of no mcan importance in Southeast Asia 
where cultural and political diversity lead more frequently to conflict than 
to cooperation. What is the Mekong scheme and ivhat lessons can be learned 
from its experience in dealing with the problems confronting Southeast 
Asia? 
THE MIGHTY MEKONG 
The scheme is concerned with harnessing the Mekong, one of the world's 
greatest and most majestic rivers. Flowing 2625 miles, from its headwaters 
high in the Himalayas of Tibet to its outlet on the South China Sea, the 
Mekong passes through 6 countries?China, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cam-
bodia and South Vietnam. Its drainage area covers 307,000 square miles. 
Its minimum flow is 60,000 cfs, twice the minimum flow of the Columbia 
River at its mouth. 
Thus far the Mekong has hardly been touched. There is no dam on the 
mainstem of the river, nor at present any bridge across it. Over 24 mil-
lion acres could be irrigated in the basin, but the present irrigated acreage 
amounts to only 380,000 acres. Potentially the river could be navigated for 
more than 1,000 miles from its mouth. Today, however, navigation is con-
fined to the lower reaches. Thc river's energy could be converted into hydro-
electric power, but today it flows unharnessed to the sea. 
It has long been suspected that the development of the Mekong River 
could bring forth substantial benefits. It was not until after the Second 
World War, however, that any systematic attempt was made to determine 
the river's potentialities. In 1951 the Economic Commission for Asia and 
the Far East (ECAFE) requested its Bureau of Flood Control to undertake 
a preliminary survey of the river. Its report pointed out that there were 
major opportunities for developing the river for power, irrigation, and flood 
control and suggested that more intensive studies be carried out. The

countries which share the lower basin received the report with great en-
thusiasm, but due to hostilities in the region no further action was taken 
for the time being. With the signing of the Geneva Accords in 1956 interest 
in the river was revived, not only in the region but on the part of other 
countries too. 
The United States offered the services of its Bureau of Reclamation to 
undertake a study of the river. The four countries sharing the lower part 
of the basin accepted the offer and the Bureau went to work. The report, 
completed in 1957, has become a basic document for the studies which have 
been undertaken since. At the same time, ECAFE called together four inter-
nationally known specialists to undertake a study of the river and the pos. 
sibilitics for its development. Their report became the cornerstone of the 
planning which has taken place since then. It stressed the need for a basin-
wide, cooperative international approach to development, involving data 
collection, Planning and actual implementation. It recommended the es-
tablishment of an international clearing house for information nn plans. 
This recommendation was adopted by the countries, who set up a Com. 
mince for tlie Coordination of Investigations of the Lower Mekong Basin 
(popularly known as the Mekong Committee) in 1957. 
THE MEKONG COMMITTEE 
The Mekong Committee is composed of representatives from Cambodia, 
Laos, Thailand and South Vietnam. It was intended primarily to coordinate 
the studies of the river and enlist and supervise assistance from countries 
and agencies outside the region. Gradually its responsibilities increased, 
so that it is now a major instrument for promothig economic and social 
change in the region, involving not only river development but also health, 
education, welfare, transportation facilities, etc. It meets several tittles a 
year, each time in a different country and sometimes outside the region. 
Its chairmanship is rotated between its members. Since all decisions of the 
committee must be unanimous, one might expect that no agreement would 
ever be reached. But the record of accomplishments of the committee shows 
that this is not the case. 
The first act of the committee was to request the United Nations to send 
out a team of highly reputed engineers to map out the course of needed 
investigations of the Mekong and its major tributaries. Lt. General Raymond 
Wheeler, former chief of the U.S. Corps of Engineers, was appointed leader 
of the team. The Wheeler Mission reported in early 1953, recommending 
a program of data collection and investigations estimated to cost over $9 
million. Many observers felt that such a program was far beyond the capa. 
billies of the Mekong countries, and there would have been little surprise 
if interest in developing the river had died right there. It did not. The Mekong 
Committee regarded the Wheeler Mission's report as a charter for action and 
resolved to garner support to gct the studies underway. The response was 
overwhelming. In a short time sullicient money had been obtained to under-
take most of the required investigations. While S9 million seemed an over. 
whelming sum at the time, it is minute compared with what has been con-
tributcd to the Mekong Committee since then. To date, more than $124 
million has been pledged to aid the Committee's planning functions and to 
get development underway. 
The United States, France, Canada and Japan were among the first 
countries to offer assistance to the 14?Ickong Committee. The U.S. offered to 
provide a hydrometric network for the basin, establish base levels for 
surveying, and undertake a hydrographic survey of the main channel, at 
an estimated cost of more than $2 million. Canada offered to undertake 
aerial surveys and mapping of the mainstem and major tributaries, at a 
cost of some $1.3 million. Japan agreed to undertake a survey of the major 
tributaries to identify the significant possibilities for development. Australia

countries became involved, and progress in getting the studies done was 
steppe4 up accordingly. 
TILE PROGRAM 
There are several outstanding features of this program of cooperative 
international assistance. First, it has involved more than 20 countries from 
all over the world. Some of them are major powers, such as the United 
States, Great Britain and France, but many of them arc small countries 
with only modest means, such as the Philippines, Denmark and Luxem-
? 
bour". Second, the cooperative program has enabled several countries to 
work together on a single project. The planning of a given project, for ex-
ample, may depend upon maps prepared by a Canadian team, geological 
surveys undertaken by Australia, irrigation studies carried out by Israel, 
mineral surycys by France, forcst surveys by Scandinavian countries, and 
legal and jurisdictional studies by Italy. Third, an essential part of the 
studies, investigations and development programs has been the training of 
local personnel to carry out similar work on other projects. The hydro-
metric and meteorological networks are now operated by local personnel. 
Soon the navigation of the river will be in the hands of local pilots trained 
by experts from the Netherlands. About 40% of the staff of the Mekong 
Committee Secretariat are native to the region. Fourth, the aid given to the 
committee has taken a variety of forms, including cash grants, low cost 
loans, and gifts of material and equipment. New Zealand, for example, pro-

vided survey boats, India gave rain gauges, and the World Food Program 
supplied food. West Germany provided low cost loans for the construction 
of the Nam Pong project in,Thailand. France has loaned money to Laos for 
the construction of the Nam Dong and Lower Sc Done projects. 
In addition to aid froin individual countries, the Mekong Committee has 
received considerable assistance from the United Nations and its various 
agencies. Some thirteen U.N. agencies have collaborated with the Mekong 
Committee, So enthusiastic has the U.N. been about the Mekong scheme 
that it has supported it on a continuous basis ever since its initiation. In no 
other case has the United Nations provided aid for planning and develop-
ment of ah international river on such a basis. 
Although ,countries outside the region have been extremely generous, 
the schezne has not been an international handout. Far from it. The Mekong 
countries themselves have provided 28% of the funds for the scheme, i.e., 
some $35 million. This is no mean achievement for countries whose gross 
national product is so small. 
A great deal has been accomplished since the Mekong Committee was 
established in 1957. Hydrologic and meteorologic networks have been set 
up, the main river channel has been surveyed, aerial photographs and maps 
of the mainstem and major tributaries have been prepared, studies of the 
geology of mainstem projects have been completed, and surveys of soil 
conditions, mineral availability, and fisheries have been undertaken. Studies 
of various economic and social factors are also underway. 
The committee is well along in its preparation of a comprehensive plan 
for the development of the river. It expects to 'have this ready sometime in 
1968. Although the final selection of projects for the comprehensive plan 
has yet to come, the basic outline is already discernible. The scheme will 
consist of a number of large, multiple purpose projects on the mainstem, 
and several smaller ones on the major tributaries (see map). Data relating 
to the scheme are set out in the table below. 
The initiation of tributary projects has had several advantages. It has 
provided the inhabitants of the countries with tangible returns on their 
investment in investigations and planning. Evidence of such returns is es-
pecially important in lesser developed countries such as those in Southeast 
Asia. The initiation of these projects has also provided an opportunity for 
the countries in the region to experiment with international cooperation in 
river development. An especially outstanding example is the cooperation 
between Thailand and Laos in the development of the Nam Pong project 
in Thailand and the Nam Ngum project in Laos. 
The Mekong Committee believes that the cooperation which has been 
achieved in the development of the smaller projects will encourage coop-
eration with regard to the mains.tem projects as well. Several of these 
projects will require international agreement and coordination. Some, such 
as the Pa Mong project, are located on the boundary between two countries. 
Others, such as the Sambor project in Cambodia, can operate at maximum 
efficiency only if there is close coordination with operations of other main-
stem projects, some of which are located in other countries, notably the 
Pa Mong project in Laos and Thailand; and Luang Prabang in Laos. Co-
ordination between the Pa Mong and Sambor operations, for example, will 
permit much greater power production at the latter project than would 
otherwise be possible.

APPRAISAL OF THE MEKONG SCHEME 
Although a great deal of progress has already been made, much remains 
to be done before the major economic and social benefits of the Mekong 
scheme will being to appear. The scheme is truly massive in scale. No pre. 
cise estimates of its ultimate costs arc available but they range from three 
to twenty billion dollars or more, depending on how much of the investment 
beyond the damsitcs and irrigation canals is included. The countries thern. 
selves have already shown that they have great faith in the scheme and aro 
prepared to sink a considerable portion of their national investment into 
it. But this will not be nearly enough. It will be necessary to continue to 
rely on substantial contributions of financial and technical aid from 
countries outside the region. This provides both a challenge and an op-
portunity for the more advanced nations of the world. 
The countries sharing the lower Mekong basin will derive tremendous 
benefits from the scheme, and it is probable that these benefits will spread 
to other countries in the region. The provision of irrigation water and the 
initiation of drainage schemes, for example, will permit a vast increase in 
rice production. In some parts of the region it will be possible to grow two 
crops instead of the single one grown at present. The importance of such 
an increase is underlined by the fact that rice production in recent years 
appears to have increased by only 2% per annum while population has 
increased by almost 3% per annum. Not only does this deficiency pose the 
problem of the Malthusian dilemma, but it also means that these countries 
will no longer have a surplus of rice with which to earn foreign exchange 
for the purchase of needed imports. Studies by a Ford Foundation team 
indicate that to secure the food requirements for the 90 million people 
expected to be living in the region by the cnd of the century, and to pro. 
vide a surplus for export necessary to generate a modest increase in in-
come from other economic activities, will require an increase in the pro-
duction of milled rice from the present 8 million tons to 17 million tons, 
i.e., an increase of about 4% per annum. 
The scheme will also make it possible to reduce the huge flood losses 
which plague the region each year. In late September and early October 
the Mekong begins to rise as a result of the monsoon rains. Sometimes ha 
peak flow reaches 20 times the minimum flow. On occasion the river over-

flows the natural levees that have built up over the years, and as much as 10 
million acres may be inundated as a result. Plans call for the storage of 
flood flows on the mainstem and in the Tonle Sap reservoir for later release 
for power and irrigation purposes. 
Moreover, the Mekong scheme will furnish large amounts of low cost 
power. This, it is hoped, will help to stimulate industry and raise the 
standard of living. Present power consumption in the Mekong countries 
is very low?e.g., 18 kwh per capita annually in Cambodia, compared with 
4,800 kwh in the U.S. A major reason for this discrepancy is the high price 
of power in Cambodia, estimated at about 150 per kwh, compared with a 
U.S. average of less than 20 per kwh. Low cost power could be used as a 
basis for expanding forest products and food products industries, and for 
developing electrometal and electrochemical industries in the Mekong 
countries. It could also foster agricultural development through fertilizer 
production and the mechanization of certain farm operations. 
Another benefit of the scheme will be the improvement of transportation 
and communications, particularly through the extension of navigation. 
Ultimately, navigation will be extended to Luang Prabang?more than 1,000 
miles from the sea. This should foster trade between Laos and other 
countries in the region. It should also help to promote economic and social 
development in Northeast Thailand, an area where economic backwardness 
has sown the seeds of political discontent. 
The greatest accomplishment of the Mekong scheme, however, may be 
the example it has set as a means of reducing political tension in the re-
gion. Bringing together lour countries which trade with each other very 
little (less than 2% of the international trade of any of the Mekong countries 
is with other countries in the region), which do not cooperate with each 
other on anything else, and some of which do not even have diplomatic 
relations with the others, is no mean achievement. The fact that the Mekong 
scheme has survived through the civil wars and the Vietnamese conflict 
indicates that the partners in the scheme enthusiastically support its aims 
and objectives and the manner in which these have been pursued. 
The Mekong scheme has been one of the most successful attempts to solve 
economic, social and political problems in Southeast Asia. It is difficult to 
isolate the reasons for its success, but at least four factors seem to be in-
volved. First, the scheme focuscs on the need to increase the food supply 
and raise the standard of living, matters on which there is broad agree-
ment among all factions in the rer,cion that action is essential. Second, it 
leaves basic decision-making in the hands of the Mekong countries but still 
provides these countries with the opportunity to obtain needed financial 
and technical aid. Third, assistance is obtained on a multilateral rather 
than bilateral basis, thus reducing, dependence on any one country and 
minimizing the influence of any one power bloc. At the same time, countries: 
which have only minor foreign aid programs have had an opportunity to 
participate. Fourth, it encourages a regional aproach to development, which 
not only enables the countries concerned to take advantage of the econ-
omies of cooperative development, but which hopefully will also foster 
tolerance and mutual understanding among the various partners. 
The Mekong scheme cannot be expected to solve all the problems of South-
east Asia. It was never intended to do so. But the principles underlying the 
scheme appear to have applications far beyond the development of the 
river. They offer useful guidelines for the formulation of policies now be-
ing conceived to deal with poverty, social distress, and political unrest in 
this troubled region.

THE MEKONG PROJECt NUMBER, 1968 
(EXCERPTS ) 
The Master Plan 
ri-IIIE EKONG DEVEIDPNIENt. PROJECT IS CENTERED 
in the Lower Mekong Basin, which stretches 
more than 1,500 miles from the Burma border in 
the North to the China Sea. The lower basin 
embraces large portions of CaMbodia, Laos, Thai-
land, and the Republic of Vict-Nam. It has a drain-
area of some 236,000 square miles, and thus 
carers an area somewhat larger than France, and 
ncrJy twicc as large as Japan. Some 25 million peo-
pyive in the basin, and about 50 millions live in the 
four riparian countries of which the basin is a part. 
t'he Project seeks the comprehensive develop. 
int of the water resources of this lower basin, 
including mainstream and tributaries, in terms of 
nyldro-clectric power, irrigation, flood control, 
i nage, navigation improvement, water manage-
..,ent, and water supply, along with related far-
thing economic and social growth, for the benefit 
fU people of the area without distinction as 
10 politics or nationality. A measure of the growth 
potential is provided by the prospect of the present 
id hictoric undermilization of the water resources 
of the basin, evidenced by inter alia the facts that 
less than 3 per cent of die basin is irrigated although 
vast portions of it could with great profit be irri-
gated froni the ample waters of the Mekong; and 
that alimr no hydro-electric power is drawn from 
the river toough the four riparian countries yearn 
for industrial development for which the tremen-
dous hydro-electric power potential of the river 
and its tributaries could provide a prime ingredient. 
Mekong development work is directed by the 
Mekong Coordination Committee, established in 
1957 by the Governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thai-
land, and the Republic of Viet-Nam as an auto-
nomous inter-governmental agency under the aegis 
of the United Nations, more particularly the United 
Nation*. Economic Commission for Asia and the 
Far East. The Committee consists of four pleni-
potentiary representatives (one 'from each of the 
four riparian countries), and is formally empow-
ered to "promote, coordinate, supervise and con-
trol the planning and investigation of water resour-
ces development projects in the Lower Mckong 
i;1"; and to "make requests on behalf of the 
irovernments- for special financial and

and take title to property ...". The Committee 
requests and receives advice on major questions 
from an international Advisory Board of high com-
petence, which meets with the Committee at least 
once and usually several timcs a year. 
Day-to-day management is provided on the 
Comtnittee's behalf and under its direction by an 
Executive Agent assisted by a small full tinic staff 
attached to ECAFE, and financed in part by the 
four riparian governments, in part by the UN 
regular budget in its ECAFE section, and in part 
by the UN Special Fund. Approximately half of 
the professional members of this central manage-
ment staff arc nationals of the four member ripa-
rian states. 
In addition to the four riparian governments, 21 
countries from outside the basin (Australia, Canada, 
India, Japan, New Zealand, Pakistan, United King-
dom, and the United States, under their Colombo 
Plan programmes; and Belgium, Republic of China, 
Denmark, Finland, France, Iran, Italy, Israel, Fede-

number of private business organizations have to-

Some $105 million have to-date been pledged?about 
one-third by the four riparian partners themselves

Committee issues a detailed Annual Report of its 
activities, thc most recent of which covers the 
period ending 31 December 1965. (E/CN.11/714).

TIMING 
A frequent question asked about Mekong Deve-
lopment is: When will Mekong Development be 
completed? This is a little like asking: When will 
India be fully developed? Or Japan, or the United 
States, or Australia? One can hope that economic 
development and growth will never end in any of 
these countries, or in any others. And one can 
hope and believe that, say a century from now, 
water resources development projects will still bc 
being planned and constructed on the Mekong 
Mier and its tributaries, so vast are the resources 
which -may ultimately be utilized. - 
The Mekong Coordination Committee was estab-
lished in 1957. In 1959 it cmbarkcd upon its first 
five-year programme of work, of which the cssen-
tial part was data collection and planning, with the 
emphasis on the planning of tributary projects. The 
sccond five-year work programme, 1964/1968, 
while envisaging work in all thc many categories 
of Mekong Committee activity, fairly may be said 
to be concentrated on the construction of tribu-
tary projects, and the intensive planning of main-
stream projects; it is likely that six or eight tribu-
tary projects will bc constructed during this second 
five-year period, and the Committee hopes that 
the feasibility investigations of several of the main-
stream projects, notably Pa Mong, Sambor, and 
Tonle Sap will by the end of this period have been 
brought to the point where scrious financial discus-
sions looking towards construction can begin. The 
decade commencing in 1971 will hopefully see the 
completion of a number of additional tributary 
projects, and of at least these three mainstream 
projects. 
The practical point is that Mekong Develop-
ment is not only already in the construction phase, 
with the first project already generating power, but 
that the overall project is very rapidly arriving at 
the point where big finance will have to be dis-
cussed?arriving at this point very much sooner 
than perhaps has been generally appreciated.

WHERE THE REDS ARE 
STOPPED IN VIETNAM 
Fortunes of war are turning in 
South ._ Vietnam's vital Mekong 
Delta. Allies are running strong,: 
Communists are hurting. Enemy 
casualties,- we high, defections 
on the rise. 
Still, there are many "ifs." Main 
uncertainty, is whether Hanoi will 
move in vtith its own troops to 
keep th(t. iet Cong afloat. 
yINH LONG PROVINCE, 
South Vietnam 
! Here in .lhe vast lower reaches of. 
South Vietnjun, the Vict Cong military, 
machine is rtipning out of steam. 
While Arnerican and South Vietnam-
ese military 'experts warn that a coin,: 
plete end to fighting is a long way off,, 
evidence of Allied successes is piling up 
in the rich Mekong Delta-
? Viet Cong defections to the .Saigon 
Government have spurted to 300 a month' 
in this Proynce alone. A year ago the 
rate was 50 0 month. 
? The Communists, riddled by man-
power loss;, appear unable to mast 
their forces or launch the multihattalion 
strikes they Used to. Ammunition short-
ages are developing as Allied troops put 
the squeeze on supply lines. 
? Roads mid canals that only a few 
months ego were "guerrilla territory" , 
-are being opened up. An air of pros-
perity is returning to once-isolated pro-
vincial and district capitals. 
? Sa' - seems to be ruling more ef-
o Hiles and villages. 
? ., against the guerrilla "in- ! 
fiasti'ticti&'"-t1 isp1v personnel, spies 
? and terrorists-are imrtiog the Reds. In 
the first five months or this year, U. S. 
sources report, 60 per- cent more in-
frastructure personnel have been rooted 
out than in the previous five months. 
The situation in the Delta is stump-4 , 
.up this way by one long-time observer: 
The Communists are being forced to ! 
pull ii their horns, to operate with less 
A 
and less freedom. That means their 
ability to tax, to recruit, to impress fight-
ers and to carry out terrorist attacks is 
being minimized all the time." 
Meaning for all. What happens in 
the Delta has special meaning for all of 
'South Vietnam. Almost half the nation's 
17 million people live here. The region 
produces most of the ccnintry's rice. Both - 
the Communists and Saigon view success 
or failure here as a key influence on the 
political struggle now shaping up be-
tween the Reds and the Government. 
As one expert explained: 
"A Government presence in the Delta 
would be .proof that Saigon can produce 
stable and viable rule as the U. S. begins 
.to pull out. 
"Viet Cong dominance, on the other, 
band, would go a long way toward con-
vincing the rest of Vietnam-and the. 
outside world-that there is no chance to 
build a non-Communist administration in 
the country." 
Fighting in the Delta is a "separate" 
conflict from that going on in the areas , 
stretching from north of Saigon to the 
border of North Vietnam. There are al- . 
most no North Vietnamese troops fight-
ing here. Guerrillas native to the region ' 
carry the brunt of battle. 
The land itself is a terrorist's haven-
pocked with swamps, mangrove and 
bamboo forests, streams and man-made 
canals. There is no clustering of huts 
in villages. Hamlets, instead, may string 
out for 15 miles along a canal. Trying 
to achieve security under those condi-
tions has posed an enormous challenge. 
More and more, American air, water 
and ground forces and Saigon troops 
seem to he meeting that challenge. 
Success involves more than simple 
military gains. For instance, war-weary 
peasants, once hostile to the U. S. and 
Saigon, now are starting to co-operate 
with the Allies rather than with the 
Communists. 
One example: Four guerrilla units in-
filtrated Vinh Long Province to attack 
the provincial capital and its airport. 
Peasants inforrncd the Government. Then, 
when South Vietnamese regulars failed 
13 
to repel the attackers, a local militia 
unit made up of discharged Army vet-
erans and youths threw back the assault. 
Such intelligence gathering and fight-
lug spirit long have been mksing ele; 
ments On the Government side. 
Traveling tlimiigh the Delta, it is easy 
to spot NOM(' of the changes that have 
taken place oily recently. 
Meetings of provincial chiefs are Ink-
ing place hi some towns where, until 
six months ago, South 'iletnamese 
ers had never dared visit for fire yirars.

INDIAN-SOVIET DEAL ON RAILWAY CARS ENDS IN FIASCO  
During a visit to New Delhi in January 1968, Soviet Prime Minister 
Alexei Kosygin made a surprise offer to purchase some 54,000 railway freight 
cars from India. Even though the deal would tie up a substantial portion of 
her steel production and would inevitably mean close economic bonds to Moscow, 
the offer was warmly received by India, which was then suffering an economic 
slump. Kosygin's bid caught the popular imagination and helped greatly in 
making his visit a success. 
In high hopes, Indian negotiators set out for Moscow to work out the 
terms of the purchase. Before long, however, it became apparent that the two 
sides were worlds apart on the question of price, even though they managed to 
come to terms on the technical specifications for the cars. The negotiations 
dragged on for months. Despite abundant evidence that the Soviets would not 
increase their offer, the Indian government persisted in its belief that a 
deal could be consummated. On 28 July 1969 the Minister for Foreign Trade 
and Supply told the Indian parliament that a Soviet technical team was ex-
pected to arrive in India shortly for a final round of talks on the negotia-
tions. He said: "It is hoped that a contract will be signed following these 
talks...." The negotiations were a principal point on the agenda of India's 
Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Dinesh Singh, when he visited Moscow in 
September 1969 to discuss possible fields for further development of economic 
cooperation between the two countries. According to news accounts, the 
Soviets promised him speedy efforts to sort out the difficulties blocking 
the final agreement, and reiterated their promise to send a technical dele-
gation to India in the near future to discuss these issues. 
The technical delegation finally did arrive in India. After further 
protracted negotiations, the Soviets' final offer was Rupees 56,000 per car, 
the raw materials for which would alone cost India Rs 74,000! 
It was finally clear to even those most eager to deal with Moscow that 
the Soviets probably did not intend to go through with the deal. Why 
then had Kosygin made the offer in the first place? Several explanations 
can be offered: 
-- The proposal, as mentioned earlier, made Kosygin's January 1968 
visit a great success. 
-- Shortly after Kosygin's visit the Soviets agreed to sell tanks to 
Pakistan, India's arch rival. The railway car bid may have been intended 
to assuage Indian concern over this sale. 
-- By binding India more closely to itself, the USSR may have hoped to 
develop more influence over Indian foreign policy, which was attempting to 
remain neutral on the issue of the war in Vietnam in view of its membership

Approved For Release 2000/08/29 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400150001-6 
in the International Control Commission established by the Geneva Accords 
of 1956. 
-- The USSR may have hoped to offset the great prestige accorded the 
United States as the result of huge American shipments of wheat and other 
grains which prevented widespread famine in India. 
Another explanation appeared well after Kosygin's visit; it may have 
been in the back of his mind at.the time, or, more likely, it may have mere-
ly developed in parallel with the negotiations on the railway cars. It is 
this: The Indian Airlines Corporation needs to buy some new airplanes to 
replace planes now in use on regional and trunk routes. It has been con-
sidering four alternatives: the BAC-111, the DC-9, the Boeing-727 and the 
Soviet TU-154. Technical opinion in the Indian airlines is strongly in 
favor of the Boeing-727 rather than the Russian TU-154. Despite this, there 
were extensive rumors in New Delhi that Russia was bringing pressure on the 
Government of India to purchase the TU-154. Otherwise, it was stated, Russia 
would not buy railway cars from India. The situation has been compounded by 
the fact that the newly appointed chairman of the Indian Airlines Corporation, 
Mohan Kumaramangalam, (who went to Moscow to discuss the deal) was not only 
a former Communist but the counsel for the New Age, the Communist Party news-
paper, in a libel case against the weekly filed by an Army officer! 
This case is not without precedence. The USSR has negotiated 
large trade treaties with other countries, or granted large economic credits, 
and then failed to live up to the recipient's expectations. The original 
signing of the treaty or granting of credit is accompanied by great propa-
ganda campaigns, and the subsequent fizzling out usually passes unnoticed. 
In fact, India came out of it better than the Canadians, who signed a 
treaty for the sale of 9 million tons of wheat to the USSR and were left 
holding the bag when the Soviets broke the agreement by buying only 5.5 mil-
lion tons (and later renegotiated to buy the remainder under terms more 
favorable to the USSR).

The Union Minister for Civil 
Aviation and Tourism, Mr. Ka-

Monday that a decision on the 
purchase of new aircraft for 
Indian ,Airlines would be taken 
very soon. Since the kind of 
plane the Government purchas-

for air traffic in India for the 
next ten years, he said, the Gov-
ernment wanted to take a little 
more time to consider the issue 
in all its aspects. 
However, the fact remains that 
this question has been hanging 
fire for the last many months. The 
matter came up before the Cabi-

was taken. This has given rise 
to considerable speculation that 
the delay was due to .the fact that

Problem of New Planes 
for Indian Airlines 
By M. Pattab 
The question of replacement of 
planes in use in the trunk lines 
and the regional routes of Indian 
Airlines has no 'doubt been engag-
ing the attention of the authori-
ties since 1966. A committee which 
was set up tinder the chairmanship 
of Air Marshal P. C. Lal recomMen-
ded that the Viscounts bi use were 
good enough for another five years

TECHNICAL COMMITTEE'S 
REPORT 
It was early in 1068 that Indian 
Airlines constituted a technical 
committee for evaluating four 
types of aircraft, namely, DC-9 (40 
series already flown and certified).

and TU-134 and make recommen-
dations as to which of them would , 
be most suitable for Indian Air.

lines. This team consisted of the 
Assistant General Manager. the 
Director of Operations. the Direc-
tor of Planning and the Director 
of Engineering of Indian Airlines. 
They visited the United States mid 
held discussions with the maim-
facturcrs of both the DC-9 and 
the Boeing 737. They also confer-
red with Scandinavian Airlines 
and Lufthansa, which were using 
one of the two varieties on their 
services. The team submitted its 
report in May 1968 to the Board 
of Indian Airlines recommending 
the purchase of the Boeing 737. 
h. its report, the team had actual-
ly stated that both the DC-9 and 
the Boeing 737 were equally good, 
but as the price of the latter was 
less by Rs. 18 lakhs for each air-
craft. the team thought it would 
be desirable to go in for the Boe-
ing 737 in the interests of econo-
my and saving in foreign exchange. 
The seating capacity of both the 
types of aircraft is just about the 
same ?115 to 125. 
The team rejected the sugges-
tion for the purchase of the TU-134 
and the BAC-111 though they 
were sound planes from the tech-
nical point of view. The Soviet 
plane was rejected primarily be-
cause of its high operating cost. -

this, the DC-9 has a breakeven 
load factor of 49 per cent on stage-
lengths of 650 nautical miles, while 
for the Boeing 737, the corres.

BAC-111 has a slightly higher 
breakeven load factor ranging 
from 55 to 56 per cent, but its 
seating capacity is only 96. hi 
other words, the team has found 
that the cost of operation of a Roe-
Ing 737 or a DC-9 was much cheap-
er with its larger seating capacity. 
Further. the TU-I34, which has 
only a seating capacity of 60, needs 
an extra navigator on it flights.

British planes.

Protest Against Indian Airline Chief's Power to Choose Planes 
QUOTE: Mr. Loke Nath Misra and Mr. R.M. Singh Deo, Swantantra members 
of the Lok Sabha, have protested to the President and the Prime Minister against 
Mr. Mohan Kumaramangalam being vested with the power to choose planes to 
replace Caravelle in Indian Airlines. 
In their letter they have pointed out that Mr. Kumaramangalam was a card 
holding communist' until 1966. He left the CPI to become Advocate General 
of Tamil Nadu but he has not ceased to take interest in communist affairs. 
Both MP's pointed out that he was even now the counsel for New  Age in the case 
against the weekly filed by an army officer. 
The letter writted to express the resentment of some section of parlia?
mentary opinion against the haste with which the union government was seeking 
to make a deal. The Swantantra group holds the view that in a world where 
the most advanced nations competed with sophisticated planes it would be a 
tragic mistake to saddle Indian Airlines with noncompetitive aircraft. Mr. 
Misra and Mr. Singh Deo regretted that a canard was started against Mr7 Mfarat 
Ram to make his resign his chairmanship of Indian Airlines and alleged that

INDIAN EXPRESS, New Delhi 
20 October 1969 
QUOTE: Technical opinion in the Indian Airlines is strongly in favour 
of Boeing-727 rather than the Russian TU-154 as the plane to meet the IA's 
requirements in the fourth plan period. 
It is understood that the Russians have underquoted their American counter-
parts in their bids. While final prices are subject to further negotiations, 
Boeing-727 will cost about 6.5 million dollars against only about 5 million 
dollars for TU-154. But in spite of price difference, the technical data and 
performance of Boeing-727 is so superior to that IA experts favour the former. 
Both planes are 160-seaters, but TU-154 is of 63,000 H.P. against only 
43,500 HdP for Boeing-727. This means that the Russian Planes's fuel consump-
tion will be almost 50 percent higher than that of the Boeing. In India, avia-
tion fuel is so expensive that fuel costs constitute 29 percent of flying costs 
as against only 11-14 percent for most other airlines. In view of this, the 
flying costs of TU-154 would be much higher than that of Boeing-727, possibly 
to the point of being completely uneconomical. 
The Russian planes higher horse power means that it can take-off from 
short airstrips. But this is considered irrelevant for Indian conditions, where 
a 160-seater would be used only on trunk routes where the runways are already 
long enough to take planes like the Caravelle or Boeing-727. 
Apart from the question of fuel costs is engine performance. Boeing-727 is 
generally regarded among the best planes ever built, and is certainly the best-
selling plane in aviation history. The engine life of TU-154 is expected to 
be only about 3,000 hours, But Boeing-727 has a proved engine life of 7,000 
hours plus, possibly going up to 10,000 hours. Moreover, the Boeing has been 
in production for a long time and is a proved aircraft, while TU-154 is still 
in the development stage. The reliability of TU-154 engine will have to be 
taken on trust. 
This factor ties up with delivery dates. The government is scheduled 
to take a final decision on planes in November, and if it chooses the Boeing 
then delivery can be made by June 1970. But it will be only in the middle 
of 1971 that the Russians will be able to deliver TU-154. 
On the question of spare parts, the IA seeks to have 75 percent of engine 
parts and 20 percent of the airframe parts in stock. In the case of TU-154's 
63,000 H.P. engines, spare parts will obviously cost more than the Boeing's 
43,000 H.P. engines. The ratio of spare parts cost to plane cost will be 
about 30 percent in the case of the Boeing, but nearer 45 percent in the case 
of TU-15hUNQUOTE.

The Soviet attittide is all the

WAGON DEAL 
OFF 
It is not at all surprising that 
the promise of a massive rail-
evaY wagoo deal with the So-
viet Union. has ended in a fias-
co. There have been any num-
ber of indications since early 
this year that the agreement 
, for the sale of well over 50,000 
lwagons for the Siberian Rail-
way may not come off in view 
of the ridiculously low prices 
which the Russians have been. 
offering. If New Delhi chose 
to ignore these, it has itself to - 
blame. Even :',after his recent 
trip to Moscow where he un-
doubtedly raised the issue, Mr. 
Dinesh Singh thought it fit to 
pin his hopes on the visit of ' 
a second Solyiet delegation to 
India. This team has now gone 
, round the country but has stuck, 
io the earlier quotation of Rs. 
56;000 for each wagon. This 
'figure is even lower than the 
cost of the raw materials alone 
which is estimated at Rs. 
74,000. The Soviet delegation 
cannot be unaware of this sim-
ple fact. All this goes to show-
that it has gone through the 
motions: of examining India's 
capacity and of discussing pri-
ces without any intention of 
entering into an agreement. 
There are several possible rea-
sons for this strange behaviour. 
It is, for 'instance, conceivable 
that Moscow has wanted to use 
the offer of the wagon deal to 
"persuade" New Delhi to go in 
for its TU 154 planes and is 
therefore dragging its feet be-
cause India has not yet decid-
ed to "reciprocate" its gesture 
or goodwill. It is also possible 
that the Russians genuinely 
doubt whether the Indian-built 
wagons will be able to stand 
the rigours of the Siberian cold. 
But if this was the case they, 
should have said so long ago. 
Mr. Kosygin took New Delhi 
BALTIMORE SUN 
20 November 1969 
Indian-Russian Deal Collapses 
by surprise early last year when 
he %oltinteered to purchase In-
dian railway wagons by the 
thousand. The country was then 
facing the dual problems of, 
recession and inflation and was 
greatly cheered by this unex-
pected offer. It confirmed New 
Delhi in its belief that Russial 
could be depended upon to 
come to its rescue at a critical 
time. But apparently Mr. Kosy- ' 
gin had? either not thought the 
proposition through which is 
unlikely or he had some other 
objective in view. It is not 
possible to establish a link be-
tween the promise to buy Indian 
Wagdnseand the sale of tanks, 
to PakiStan later in the year. 
But great powers often resort 
to such tactics to soothe the 
feelings of aggrieved nations. 
There is impressive evidence in 
any case to show that in 1967 
the Russians were critical of 
India's performance in the field 
of foreign relations and the 
general policy of allowing 
greater freedom to private ine 
dustry. They felt that though 
the Government still followed. 
the policy of non-alignment and 
had not gone hack on its pre-
vious commitment regarding 
the expansion of the public 
sector, its emphasis was strik-
ingly different. New Delhi wag 
not unduly critical of America's' 
Viet Nam policy, was graduate 
ly dismantling economic con-
trols and suitably trimming the 
next five-year plan. It would 
not be surprising therefore if 
Moscow concluded at that time 
that it had to do something big 
to arrest the decline in its influ-
ence. It could not possibly 
meet even one-quarter of 
India's requirement of ten 
million tons of foodgrains 
which New Delhi needed des-
perately to avert a widespread 
famine. But it could. as in the 
past, make a dramatic offer of. 
help in the field of industry or 
trade. This is precisely what 
, Mr. Kosygin did. 
New Delhi Refuses To 
Subsidize The Sale Of 
Now, with the Indian economy, 
tut the Finance Ministry was 
4etuctant to go even that far on

The scheme to sell the gondo-

Seven years first was broached 
1:er Soviet Prime Minister Alexei 
Kosygin when he visited India in 
January, 1967. It was welcomed 
enthusiastically by Mrs. Gandhi 
iind by Dinesh Singh, then her 
eommerce minister and now 
injnister of external affairs, as a 
generous offer to help India's 
recession-hit engineering indus-
trY? 
The manufacturers, however, 
were never enthusiastic. They 
did not want to commit their 
factories for many years to a 
special Soviet design. At the 
same time, they felt the govern-
ment had so much political capi-
tal invested in the deal that they 
I 
could demand a huge subsidy if 
it went through.

an government has decided not 
to provide large subsidies for the

, The Finance Ministry, now un-

tveen the unbudging Soviet offer

of orders which they seem uni 
likely to fill on time. Limitcd 
supplies of steel from India's" 
limping government-run steel 
plants are contributing to the 
delay. 
Sharp Price Increases 
Another problem, although ap-
parently not determinative, is 
that the Soviet specifications for 
an ore car capable of withstand-
ing the extremes of Siberian 
weather require 10 tons of a spe-, 
cial chromium-vanadium steel 
?which India would have to 
spend its own scarce hard-cur-
rency to import?in each 80-me-

India to boost its asking price

been sent to clinch the deal left 
for home after a fruitless four' 
weeks. A spokesman for the 
State Trading Commission here 
said today: "There is no break-
ing off of talks. Another round i3 
possible. But we do not have any

Today, Bali Ram Bhagat, the 
minister of foreign trade, insist-
ed to Parliament that India 
would sell the cars only if the

nated even those normally given to looking at every-
thing Russian through red-tinted glasses. 
Cleaily a gesture was called for, and Kosygin 
made one on a grandiose scale. 
Seeing that the Indian wagon industry was suffer.i. 
ing from recession, he made the lordly offer to buy 
54,000 wagons. The magnitude of the order promptly 
sent the Indian Government's publicity machinery and 
a large section of the press into a state of uncritical 
euphoria. It was only when time dragged by and no 
firm order materialised that optimism at last was re-
placeu by uneasiness. 
When, people wondered, were the Soviets 'going 
to sign a firm commitment? Tho Soviets did not reply. 
They listed specifications, talked about special steels, 
flooded India with a mass of data about technical re-
quirements, and hinted that Indian facilities were-0 
quite equal to the manufacture of the wagons in terms 
of both quality and quantity. 
These hurdles were overcome, but the final one 
WI lay ahead ? the question of price. It was only 
atter every technical pitfall had been surmounted that 
the news leaked out that between Indian manufactur-
ing costs and the Soviet offer there was an unbridge-
o'ole gulf. 
It soon became clear that Soviet "generosity" was 
phony and that Moscow's terms were not only unie-
inunerative but utterly absurd ? and neither the many 
taigh-powered delegations that rushed to and fn.) be. 
tween India and the Soviet Union, nor piteous cries 
about Indo-Soviet friendship, could save the deal. 
The last delegation to pursue the subject a fort-
night ago offered Rs 56,000 per wagon when it well 
knew that the minimum feasible Indian quotation Was 
Rs 1,16,000, and that even the cost of raw materials 
per wagon amounted to Rs 74,000. 
In terms of simple arithmetic, the "generous ges-
ture" of the Soviet Union had finally boiled down toIndia facing a loss of almost Rs 325 cores if the deal 
went through! 
Lest there be illusions about whose rates were 
fair, India's or Russia's, it may be pointed out that 
this country has sold wagons in the past not only to 
South Korea, Ceylon, Iraq, Yugoslavia and East Africa, 
but even to socialist Hungary, the Soviet Union's 
junior partner in COMECON. 
Indian prices are not only lower than any in the 
world, but the Soviet Union has not been able to
acquire these wagons elsewhere. Its insistence on 
acquiring them at less than half our manufacturing 
cost is nothing, therefore, but a piece of outrageous 
thumb-twisting. 
It is a long-standing Soviet practice to make tall 
claims, to reap immense propaganda benefits, to in4 
troduce extraneous factors, and then back out; in4 
to mulct a country of Rs 325 crores and to call it gene-
rosity cannot be contained even in the extremely flexi.i 
Me framework of Socialist Truth ? and there is no 
reason why India should do business on such term-s. 
It is time the Indian Government realised thati 
Russia's so-called friendship is a pure and simple hoilixe 
Our hopes of its siding with us against Pakistan were 
dispelled years ago; its much touted aid has amount-I 
ed to a small fraction of the help given to AIN 
by our friends in the West. In return for its largespq 
Russia has exerted unashamed pressure, interfered in 
our internal affairs and sought to control our foreign 
policy. 
The rot has gone in far enough. The integrity 
this nation cannot be bartered against wagons and 
untested aircraft. Even less can it be bartered against 
promises of non-existent carrots. Please cut it out

SOVIETS' USE OF MENTAL INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPRESS DISSIDENTS  
Stalin's successors have tried to create the impression that blatant 
terror has faded from the Soviet scene. Indeed, until recent years world 
opinion and even many Soviet citizens showed little awareness of the ex-
tent and harshness of imprisonment in present-day forced labor camps. Far 
less is known about the subtler means that the Soviet secret police (the 
KGB) uses to enforce political and intellectual conformity. One of these 
means, initiated under Khrushchev and expanded by the Brezhnev-Kosygin re-
gime, is confinement to a mental institution. A number of political pro-
testers are known to have been put out of the way in psychiatric hospitals 
of a special type dubbed by some Soviets as "hospital-prisons." How many 
other, unreported, cases there may be is open to speculation. 
A list of dissident Soviet citizens who are known to have suffered 
this fate is attached. Five of the cases, on which more detailed informa-
tion is available, are presented as examples of the situation. They'in-
volve: former Major General Pyotr G. Grigorenko, former collective farm 
chairman Ivan A. Yakhimovich, mathematician Alexander S. Yesenin-Volpin, 
interpreter Natalya Gorbanevskaya, and writer Valeri Y. Tarsis. 
As is evident in these cases, the KGB makes little pretense of follow-
ing legal procedures. Even the civil rights laws, which favor the state 
and offer the individual only flimsy protection, are flagrantly violated. 
As Mrs. Grigorenko noted, Soviet laws are observed with regard to murderers 
and rapists, but totally ignored in the case of her supposedly paranoid 
husband. It is extremely interesting to note that Yesenin-Volpin prepared 
a guide for protestors to advise them of their legal rights when being in-
terrogated by the KGB. 
A feature common to several of the cases is the evidence that the "pa-
tients" not only are not insane, but could well be termed highly superior 
citizens. Grigorenko's wife declared that his sanity was confirmed in De-
cember 1965 by the Medical Board for the Determination of Disability, and 
that he was healthy enough to work as a construction foreman. Mrs. Grigor-
enko stated to the general's investigators that she had "never noticed" his 
insanity and was told, in reply, that her husband's political views and his 
dissemination of them rendered him "socially dangerous." Yesenin-Volpin 
was described by 95 leading Soviet mathematicians in a signed petition as a 
"talented and able-bodied mathematician" whose forcible commitment to a 
hospital for seriously-disturbed mental patients was injurious to his health. 
Tarsis, in Ward 7, an autobiographical novel on his term in an insane asylum, 
wrote that the inmates were quite sane and that the psychiatrists, instead 
of trying to treat patients, often adopted the role of prosecutors in-
vestigating "anti-Soviet" activities. 
The achievements of some of the "patients" are impressive. Grigorenko

rose in the army from private to major general, had a successful record in 
World War II, and was a lecturer at Moscow's Frunze Military Academy. 
Yakhimovich was a collective farm chairman, a job in which his talents 
and enthusiasm evidently excelled according to a laudatory article in the 
national newspaper for Soviet youth. Yesenin-Volpin, besides being a tal-
ented mathematician, is a recognized poet and translator. Tarsis was an 
editor and translator, a twice-wounded war correspondent, and the author 
of short stories and two books. 
Beyond the group's achievements is their general tendency to be sensi-
tive and caring, to have a strong impulse to promote and defend social 
causes, and a willingness to suffer the consequences of open protest. Some 
of the causes espoused by the "patients" by means of letters, petitions and 
demonstrations are: 
--to help the Crimean Tatars to regain their full rights; 
--to head off the rehabilitation of Stalin; 
--to permit the Czechs to carry out their liberalization program; 
--to voice support for the Dubcek regime in Czechoslovakia; 
--to secure an open trial for young writers accused of anti-Soviet 
activities and to protest the violation of those writers' rights when 
closed trials are held; 
--to protest the arrest of writers Sinyavskiy and Daniel by publicly 
demanding that the provisions of the Soviet Constitution be observed; 
--to publicize the facts of the oppressions of the Stalin era; 
--to protest violations of legal procedures at a Leningrad trial. 
How to cope with such "offenses," is a difficult problem for the regime. 
The acts are not crimes which can be easily proven in court; rather, they 
would require the prosecutors and the KGB once again to stage sham trials 
like the ones which evoked stormy domestic and foreign protest in 1966, 1967, 
and 1968. Apparently the regime prefers not to subject itself to the poten-
tial embarrassment of a seoret trial ora closed trial from which the tran-
script may leak to the Western press. Instead, it chooses at times to deal 
with these kinds of dissidence by committing the perpetrator to a mental in-
stitution. To be effective, this policy should be just well-enough known to 
serve as a threat that will cause the dissident-minded to keep quiet, but not 
so well-known that it will arouse large numbers of Soviet citizens and darken 
the Soviet image around the world. 
As will be seen, much of the attached material comes from the Khronika  
Tekushchikh Sobytiy (Chronicle of Current Events). This is an underground 
journal put out bi-monthly in the USSR by means of "samizdat" (literally 
"self-publishing," this term relates to any material that is printed or writ-
ten and then copied and circulated from hand to hand). Khronika deals with 
a wide range of protest developments, and has provided several revealing ac-
counts of persons committed to mental institutions.

Tel. G-6-27-37 
DECLARATION 
At the request of Attorney Kaminskaia, my husband, 
Piotr Grigorevich Crigorenko was to appear in the Mos-
cow Municipal Court as a witness in the trial of Ginzburg, 
Calanskoy, it af. The Chairman of the court,. Miromov, 
turned d 
issued b 
attestin 
Thi4 
by thDiabilite 
n the request, citing as his reason a certificate 
Mental Health Clinic No. 1, Leningrad District, 
hat my husband is mentally unbalanced. 
rtificate is false; in December 1965, a decision 
TEK [Medical Board for the Determination of 
] confirmed his sanity; his case was removed 
from tl4 files and since then he has not [even] been 
called in' for consultation. A document to this effect was 
presented to the court. 
In 'full possession of his health, P. G. Grigorenko is 
employed as a foreman at the SU-2 [a division of the 
Moscow Building Trust], and also heads a party school 
in the capacity of propagandist. There are 20 people in 
his group, 13 of them Communists and seven non-party 
members. 
It turns out, then, that in one place my husband serves 
as a political leader, while in another he is regarded as 
mentally disturbed. What is this?a mistake? No, it is 
a violation of legality, which has been going on for more 
than four years. 
On February 1, 1964, Grigorenko?a Major-General 
and Candidate in Sciences?was arrested and charged 
with anti-Soviet activity. Yet, his case was not investi-
gated, and instead he was sent to the Serbsky Institute, 
where he was found to be mentally disturbed. On the 
basis of that finding, he was sent to a Leningrad prison-
hospital for compulsory treatment.. 
When I asked precisely when my husband had lost hie 
sanity?since I had never noticed it?I was told by the 
CIA-RDP79-01194A000400150001-6 
investigators, Lt. Colonel[s?] Kuznetsov and Kantov, 
that my husband's political views and his dissemination 
of them rendered him socially dangerous. I was also in-
formed by the [other?) investigators?lawyers?that he 
would be kept in the [army) reserve in the status of a 
sick person, retaining his rank and pension. 
From party sources I learned that there is a regulation 
that mentally ill people temporarily have to relinquish 
their party cards, which are restored to them after re-
covery. What, then, happened next? 
By Khrushchev's order of August 29, 1964, my husband 
was demoted to the rank of private and expelled from the 
party as mentally unbalanced. 
All of the patients in the hospital received sickness 
benefits?except my husband. The law was observed 
with regard to murderers, rapists. Two of the inmates?Lt. 
Col. Shevchenko, who had knifed his daughter and Lt. 
Col. Burkovsky, who had shot three men?were retired 
into the reserve, also keeping their ranks and pensions. 
On April 29, 1965, my husband was discharged from 
the hospital as a Group-2 invalid. For ten months this 
Group-2 invalid, a disabled war veteran, was refused both 
his pension and a position. He was forced to go to work 
as a loader. 
In December 1965, by a decision of the VTEK of 
Mental Health Clinic No. 1, Leningrad District, my hus-
band was certified to be mentally healthy and his case 
removed from the files. But this was not followed by the 
restoration either of his party card or of his military 
rank, or of the pension he had earned by 34 years of 
honorable military service. Wounded a number of times, 
he has not been certified, to this day, as a disabled war 
veteran. 
The entire story which I have related here is nothing but 
a gross miscarriage of justice. I consider it a prelude to 
new repressions against my husband. I am filled with, 
horror, the more so because during the years of the 
personality cult I lost my first husband, my sister and my 
brother-in-law, in addition to having been myself sub. 
jected to repressions. 
As a Communist and as a citizen of the Soviet Union, 
I demand an end to the illegal acts against my husband 
and my family, and to the persecution of my children and 
myself. I demand the complete restoration of my hus-
band's rights as a party member and citizen,. and the 
reinstatement of his military rank.

NAP' A. YAKIIIMOVICH (1930?- )?Philologist, gradu-
ated Latvian State University in 1956, appointed chairman 
of a collective farm in Latvia in 1960. Author of appeal 
to Susloy (Doc. 17), which cost him his job. In July 1968, 
declared his support of the Dubcek regime in Czecholova-
kin (see The New York Times, July 30, 1968). For back-
ground information, see laudatory article about Y. which 
appeared in Soviet press in 1964 (Doc. 18). 
"The Duty of a Communist": From a 
Kolkhoz Chairman to Suslov 
do not have sufficient information to judge the 
degree of guilt of the persons subjected to repression, 
but of one thing I am firmly convinced and one thing 
1 know--the type of trial that took place in the Moscow 
Municipal Court January 8-12, 1968, is causing enormous 
damage to our party and to the cause of communism, 
lint', in our country and elsewhere. 
We have celebrated the glorious [50th] anniversary; 
we pride ourselves on our achievements in economic 
and scientific techniques; and we ourselves, at the very 
time the IJnited Nations has declared 1968 the Year 
of the Defense of the Rights of Man, are handing the 
enemies of communism trump cards to be used against 
us. It is absurd! 
We were naked, hungry, and destitute, but we won 
because we placed in the foreground the liberation of 
man from injustice, outrage, lack of rights, etc. And we 
can lose everything, despite our rockets and hydrogen 
bombs, if we forget the origins of the Great October 
Socialist Revolution. 
From the time of Radischey,1 trials of writers have 
always been an abomination in the eyes of progressive, 
thinking people. What were our home-grown leaders 
thinking of when they shut [Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn's 
mouth, made rr fool of the poet [Andrei] Voznesensky, 
"punished" [Andrei D.] Siniavsky and [Yuli M.] Daniel 
with forced labor, when they involved the KGB [secret 
policell in spectacles with "foreign enemies" ? 
One must not subvert the confidence of the masses 
in the party; one must not speculate with the honor 
of the state, even if a certain leader wants to end 
santizdat.2 Sarnizdat can be eliminated only by one means: 
by the development of democratic rights, not their vio-
lation; by observance of the Constitution, not its viola. 
lion; by the realization in practice of the Declaration 
of Human Rights, which [Andrei Y.] Vishinsky [former 
Foreign Minister] signed in the name of our state, not 
by ignoring it. 
Incidentally, it appears that Articles 18 and 19 of the 
Declaration read: 
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, con-
science, and religion . . . Everyone has the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes 
freedom to hold opinions without interference and to 
seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through 
any media and regardless of frontiers. 
3 
You know Article 125 of our Co, titution perfectly 
well, so I shall not quote it. I only t ant to recall the 
thought of V. I. Lenin to the effect t ' .f! need full 
and true information, and truth should 1...! tit --;?nd upon 
the question of whom it should serve" (IP ,!. edi-
tion, Vol. 54, p. 446). 
I believe that the persecution of young dissenters 
a country where more than 50 percent of the population 
are younger than thirty years of age is an extremely 
dangerous line?adventurism. It is not the toadies, not a 
public of yesmen (0 Lord, how they have multiplied!), 
not the mama's boys, who will determine our future, 
but rather those very rebels, the most energetic, brave, 
and high-principled members of our young generation. 
It is stupid to see in them the enemies of Soviet power? 
and more than stupid to let them rot In prisons and to 
mock them. For the party, such a line is equivalent to 
self-strangulation. Too bad for us if we are not capable 
of reaching an understanding with these young people. 
They will create, inevitably they will create, a new 
party. Ideas cannot be murdered with bullets, prisons, 
or exile. He who does not understand this is no poli-
tician, no Marxist. 
You, of course, remember the "Testament of Palmiro 
Togliatti." I have in mind this part of it: - 
A general impression has been created of foot-drageing 
and opposition in the matter of a return to Leninist 
norms which would insure both within the party and 
outside it more freedom of utterance and discussion 
on questions of culture, art, and politics, as well. 
It is difficult for us to explain to ourselves this Pool-
dragging and this opposition, particularly in view of 
contemporary conditions, when the capitalist encircle-
ment no longer exists and economic construction has 
attained enormous successes. 
We have always proceeded from the thought that 
socialism is a system in which there exists the broadest 
freedom for the workers who participate in the cause, 
who participate in an organized way in the leadership 
of social life as a whole. (Pravda, Sept. 10, 1964.) 
Who benefits from a policy of foot-dragging and op-
position? Only overt or covert Stalinists, political bank-
rupts. Remember: Leninism?yes! Stalinism?no! The 
20th Congress of the party did its work. The genie is 
at large and cannot be confined again! By no forces 
and nobody! 
We are on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 
Soviet army [Feb. 23]. We are on the eve of the con-
sultative meeting of the fraternal Communist parties 
[which opened in Budapest Feb. 26]. Do not complicate

On the contrary, Comrade Podgorny [Soviet Presi-

permitted the grossest violations of legal procedure.

Soviet youth organ Komsomolskaia pravdq (Oct. 30, 
1964). 4n abridged translation 0/ these excerpts, with 
the introduction by the paper's correspondent, is pre-
sented below as a sidelight on the personality and views 
of the author o/ the letter.?Ed. 
He wears brown cowboy pants, is black "devil's hide" 
jacket, and a beret. But it's not so much the kqlkhoz 
chairman's "suspicious" manner of dress as it is his 
beard that bothers leaders in the district and even in 
the republic: "Isn't that Yakhimovich a dandy!" I heard 
it as an intimation and even as a simple statement of 
fact in Kraslava and Riga, hut not in Sivergala. 
The Sivergala kolkhozniks would never think of their 
chairman that way. To them, Antonovich is hardworking, 
honest and fair, a man who worries more about the 
kolkhoz than about himself. 
The chairman's house is full of books. The shelves,' 
bookcases and table are loaded with them. There are 
two booklovers in the house: Ivan Antonovich himself 
and his wife. Both are philologists, graduates of the 
Latvian State University, he in 1956 and she in 1960. 
While she was still a student, he was teaching rural 
children, then became a regional inspector and, finally, 
the head of a backward kolkhoz. When she began teach-
ing in the Sivergala school, he became a student again, 
this time by correspondence with the agricultural academy.

on the broadest scale, you can well imagine what you 
have done, what kind of seeds you have sown throughout 
the country. Have the courage to correct the mistakes 
that have been made, before the workers and peasants 
take a hand in this affair. 
I don't want this letter to be passed over in silerice, 
for the cause of the party cannot be a private cause, a 
personal cause, and, even less, a second-rate cause.

Central Committee of the party, and to insist that all 
members of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union be acquainted with the contents 
of this letter. 
The letter is sent to Comrade Suslov with this in view. 
With Communist greetings!

A year ago I learned by accident that Ivan Antonovieh 
Yakhimovich, chairman of the "Young Guard" Kolkhoz, 
was keeping a diary. At that time, he told me that he was 
keeping the diary only "for himself." This fall, how-
ever, he entrusted me with his notebooks. Here are some 
excerpts from that diary, which he decided to make 
public, and which I thought would interest everyone. 
?D. Vasilieva, correspondent 
for Komsomolskaia pray& 
1960 
March 12: A month has passed since our wedding. 
And it's already a month since I became chairman of 
the kolkhoz. Ira is in Riga finishing up her studies. 
Work, work, and more work. Even asleep I can't 
get away from my worries and anxieties. The kolkhoz 
is poor, and I'm considered just another poor relation. 
My pay is 300 rubles. I set the figure myself. This seems 
. eccentric to lots of people, the act of a little boy play. 
ing at patriotism. But to me, these are the hard, cold 
facts of life. Besides, the 300 rubles is only temporary, 
until the kolkhoz picks up. 
April 5: We bought five tons of potassium nitrate 
with money borrowed from the kolkhozniks. There isn't 
a cent in the bank. An urgent payment of 70,000 rubles 
has suddenly come due. The debt to the kolkhozniks 
is now 42,000. It has been dragging on since 1958. 
We run o the stores and the trade bureau carrying 
a suitcase with the cash. Whenever we appear, they 
taunt us by asking, "With or without suitcase?"--i.e., 
with or without money? 
May It: I've been accepted as a candidate member 
of the CPS. 
May 22: The planting is simper done. The spring

' wheat is in, more than half the flax, 40 percent of the 
, potatoes, 10 percent of the corn. i

but I do know that I value it rpore than ever before. 
hate 20; Some sailors from Ole Baltic Fleet came 
to the kolpoz. Their concert wps too fine for words. 
Our people were pleased, and our guests were pleased 
Iwith themselves. If only our amateur performances were 
on , the same level! 
' December 2: The farms in Latgaliia cannot be com-
pared with others in the republic. Latgaliia is eco-
: 
nomically tiackward. There are no sound buildings, no 
purebred cattle. The soil is poor. To get a good harvest, 
two ''irir thype times as much has to be put in as in 
other parts of Latvia. Our bread, tri lk, and meat cost 
us so i much more because the rail id is so far away 
and the roads to the fields are so bad. 
Latgaliia is really virgin land. It has to be developed 
decisitelr and boldly. 
I, 
1961 
April 23: So much is happening! What a blast-off, 
what a flight! April 20th, Yuri Gagarin leaped into 
space and returned to earth. The invasion of Cuba and 
the crushing defeat of the interventionists. 
Spring is coming. Tomorrow we begin planting. We 
have advanced everyone twenty kopek. apiece, Of two 
rubles in old money, for each working day .. . . 
May 3: How often we still try to justify our mistakes 
in education and our simple laziness by blaming the 
poor, ungifted students. Someday it will be different: 
lack of talent, not talent, will be the exception. The 
mediocre person will be considered a waste and a failure 
on the part of the whole collective. The normal human 
being hies tremendous potentialities within him?that's 
a law, not an invention. It is the duty of society and 
of each individual to turn the potentiality into reality. 
May 29: I received a severe reprimand for not fulfilling 
the quarterly quota for meat. 
June II: Heat and drought. A few more days of 
this and the fields will burn up and the harvest will 
be 14t. There are unpromising clouds floating about, 
sometimes even thunder and two or three drops of rain, 
then once more it's dry and hot. The streams have 
dried up, and the swamps have settled. All the roads 
have become passable. 
But the winter rye is all right despite the weather, and 
even the clover has matured early. The nightingales 
give no peace. Summer residents, fishermen, and tour-
ists have arrived, making us envious as hell. But there 
isn't even time to be envious?we're starting to get the 
fodder ready. The first stalks of grain have already 
appeared. What a wonderful smell! 
July 21: I'm reading the story "The Last Wish of 
Aleksandr Ulianov" in Sergei Lvov's Fire of Prometheus. 
August 3: Being a kolkhoz chairman is like being 
sentenced to hard labor! How many hours does a 
chairman work? Around the clock. How many hours 
does he sleep? Only enough to keep him on his feet. 
But that isn't the hard part. Serving the people is a 
: CIA-RDP79-01194A000400150001-6 
heavy responsibility, but an honorable one. It's horrible 
when bureaucracy interferes. How tired you get o 
petty supervision! They figure it out, chew it over, and 
shove it under your nose: how many hectares to plant 
with what, what kind of harvest to get, and when. 
This is called planning from below .. . . 
August 10: I'm going to Riga for a 91-54 tractor. 
The news has spread all over the kolkhoz. 
August 25: We're beginning to thresh the rye. Such 
impatience, such an itch to make something out of 
this! Electricity, a club, a barn, a new organization of 
jobs, rational discipline! It's time to launch a real 
campaign for these things, one that will carry everyone 
along. How we need such a campaign! It's the only way 
to attract good people. 
September 30: I'm a papa. My daughter was born. 
Just think how old I've gotten overnight. What a 
wonderful way to grow old! 
November 6: We've paid our debts. Now we don't 
owe the government or anybody. It has changed every-
thing; it's as if the resentment, suffering and agony had 
never been. 
November 28: The nausea and pains have come back. 
I'm not smoking. I've become irritable, and I get tired 
easily. A "repair job" Is necessary. I'm going to the 
hospital tomorrow. 
December 7: I didn't go to the hospital. Things 
changed, and so did I. 
5 
1962 
February 19: The brigade leaders greeted the sugar. 
beet project with silence. When we got down to con-
crete plot sizes for each brigade, the reception turned 
hostile. Bleidel remarked, "Twenty hectares in our 
situation is no joke!" 
March 10: Communism is the highest quality in every-
thing, from man on down to a child's little sock. 
May 16: Today's meeting of the management has left 
a bitter aftertaste: we punished several men for mis-
handling the machines. Brench got a stern reprimand 
and a fine of thirty rubles. Geka is going to be tried. 
The failures and problems in dealing with people! 
July 7: We're beginning to spray the corn with 
herbicides. There was a general meeting of the kolkhoz. 
The semi-annual report. It's possible we'll become "hun-
dred-thousanders" this year. 
July 13: Irochka crawls along fast, pulling her little 
legs under her. She claps her hands together and says 
"Papa" already. She is very curious and bright. She's 
a lot of trouble, but more joy. 
August 16: Nikolaev, Popovich . . . One gets used 
to miracles. 
September 25: Rain. Uninterrupted rain. We're plow-
ing the fields for fall. The tractors get stuck. So Ivan 
Trubach has decided to do his plowing in two separate 
steps. He takes care of the swampiest spots by first 
dragging his feet along the ground, feeling out the best 
path for his tractor. Where Trubach has been with his 
machine, there will be a harvest. 
November 29: Our number has increased! They 
brought Tatiana Ivanovna home from the maternity ward

yesterday. 
December 11: We raised the money for a ten-kilowatt 
1,Jotor for our drying room. By actual count this is the 
fifteenth motor already. Do you recall, Comrade Chair-
man, how you ran around looking for kerosene lamps? 
1963 
February 2: It's too bad that so far we haven't been 
able to reconcile our young people to systematic labor: 
nudging and scolding don't get very. far. And we've 
had no luck with the Komsomol secretaries. Maybe 
Rosa Butkana should be nominated. She's energetic, 
strong-willed, and principled. 
March 4: Again and again we go back- to Lenin, 
not out of duty like the schoolboy or student, but out 
of the natural need for advice, ideas, and moral purity. 
April 2: A light blue, faultlessly clear sky, the tops 
of the birches barely moving. This is all I can see from 
lily hospital bed. A stomach ulcer sent me to the hos-
pital a ftdr all. A lot of our fellow kolkhozniks are here, 
being "ntended" before the planting. I look upon my 
own illness as a soldier wounded in battle looks upon 
the mutilated part of his body: put this to rights as 
quickly ,its possible and let me get back to the ranks. 
Almost iveryone here has similar thoughts. When the 
attack crimes, each of us must be at his post. 
April 4: I can't get the clash with Krikov, head of 
the financial planning department, out of my head. 
lie didn't want any arguments and on his "own discre-
tion" fixed the plot sizes for flax, corn and sugar beets. 
I told him the plan would only work on paper, and 
not on the land. Krikov just about choked with fury. 
Was I being cheeky? No. It's all very, well to be 
humble, but not in all situations. To be humble where 
the truth is concerned is to be a scoundrel. 
April 7: I have armed myself with books: Turgenev, 
Pushkin, Chekhov. I especially want to reread Turgenev. 
I go from book to book, becoming less tired and more 
delighted all the time. 
But I miss my work like the very devil. In the near 
future we're going to have to work out our fertilizer 
ourchase and distribution in such a way as to avoid 
having to move manure to the outlying fields. We should 
keep a supply of peat out there (piles of it, mixed with 
ground phosphates and dung-water) and prepare the 
compost on the spot: a little manure, peat, soil, and 
mineral fertilizers. The manure could also be bought 
on the spot from the kolkhozniks. We must wage an 
all-out battle against unproductive expenditures. 
Pastureland should be closer to the farms so that 
milking times can be coordinated. Calves, sheep and 
horses should be kept in the farthest fields. Also, lu-
pine plants, pea plants, mixed vetch and oats, and seed 
...lover. In toward the center the land should be worked 
more intensively. 
April 15: My neighbor in the next bed treated us all 
to eggs, proudly explaining, "My wife brought them, 
hiking 25 kilometers on foot. We've lived together a 
long time and never had a serious .argument." Before, 
this peasant looked plain and grey to me, but now he's 
transformed, handsome even. My mood picked up im-
mediately, but it could have been completely ruined by 
Icy Ovalov's Story of a Life. 
: CIA-RDP79-01194A000400150001-6 
Right now, nothing depresses me more than a 
thoughtless attitude toward human feelings, toward the 
purity of those feelings. Did the heroine of this story 
ever love her drunkard-husband? No. Consequently, 
their domestic relations are petty, stupid, and offensive 
from start to finish. All the heroes of the book are 
narrow, mediocre and weak. I'm sorry for them, with 
all their little ideas and little passions, but most of 
all I'm sorry for the author. The book leaves a flat, 
grey impression like the description of a bygone day. 
I compare everything I read with my own experience, 
observations and feelings. It's disappointing not to find 
in a book anything that you can strive for. 
I look at our love and am glad it is growing, becoming 
broader, more mature, deeper, more humane. Our love is 
not afraid to look truth in the ere, not afraid to demand 
that we each fulfill our duty. Most important of all, it is 
growing and will continue to grow along with us and our 
children. For us, where to live or how to divide the house-
hold chores is no more of a problem than filling our time 
and avoiding boredom. We live in the whole world and 
bring the whole world to each other. 
April 20: I left the hospital yesterday. I didn't want to 
wait for the bus, so I got back to the kolkhoz on a dump 
truck. My life begins again with a working day. . . . 
June 14: There's no doubt that talent has been un-
covered and put to work for human society by material 
incentives. But moral incentives will predominate in the 
future and will so eclipse the former that any comparison 
of the two will seem an absurd joke. . . . 
August 25: I once wrote to the republic Ministry of 
Production and Purchases with asuggestion for organiz-
ing purchases preferentially, based on the need for spe-
cialization. Livestock products should be emphasized, and 
grain minimized. Well, in practice, I've had to abandon 
that viewpoint. In fact I had no alternative: I had no right 
to sacrifice grain. In the interests of the state most of all, 
I didn't have the right. What kind of a mood would the 
kolkhozniks have been in, what would they have planted 
in the spring? 
For over a week auditors have been digging around in 
our files. Rumors and gossip are spreading. All this dis-
organizes people, interferes with work. It's possible that 
I'll be replaced by another man. That would be hard to 
take. I can't imagine not being on the kolkhoz. To have 
lived four years with its trials and tribulations . . . I'm 
most concerned not for myself, but for the kolkhoz, that 
it shouldn't take a beating. It's very important that not 
just any man be allowed to take the post of chairman. 
October 15: In the forest, it's ashf all the summer smells 
were being burned away in a great smoldering bonfire. 
Autumn. The work in the fields is done. People are in a 
good mood. The main thing is that there is faith in the 
coming year, which means "a desire to work." This makes 
me glad and gives me strength. I still don't know my fate. 
December 8: A reprimand . . . Well, that's not so bad. 
The main thing?they left me in the kolkhoz. 
1964 
January 1: A tiny fir tree in the room. The candles 
are lit. The children are asleep. Ira and I have wished 
each other a happy new year. We turn things over in 
our minds and agree that the past year hu been good,

I became a student again, and our kolkhoz became a 
"millionaire" (old price scale), meeting the plan for 
meat and milk deliveries to the state and settling up 
accounts with the kolkhozniks. Despite the difficulties 
and special problems of the year, we made a good 
stride forward: All branches of livestock production 
became profitable. Even pork brought a profit this year. 
February 2: The reports and elections meeting. I was 
re?elected chairman. 
February 9: We've gone over to monthly wages for 
the kolkhozniks. The advantages of this system have 
become immediately apparent: it gives people a taste 
for money, diverts them from private farming, encourages 
the accountants, and gets the kolkhoz finances moving. 
, I reniember Janis Nartysh's "philosophy" which he 
:elaborated for me at the start of my tenure here. "What's 
:bad for the kolkhoznik? Freedom of choice: if he 
,wanls he works; if lie doesn't want to, he just lies 
the 'stove." Now Janis doesn't much care to lie on 
he id ovi?. 
February 9: Yesterday we saw "The Living and the 
D ead." both parts. The penal servitude of war. The 
povierles'sness of the strong. Hut it was as it should be: 
the determination to defend one's country is more powerful 
than the will to enslave. It was that great determination 
that gave the strength and forged the victory. I liked

The words we waste in conversation! We talk?and

must work, pencil in hand: think, think?not just pour 
one empty vessel into another. 
February 2.5: Another daughter, our third. Weight: 
four kilos. Hair: black. 
Erhpery. I feel so sorry for zupery! How hard it 
must have been to live persecuted and alone. To forget 
oneself only in the endless skies, or with children. To 
feel the constant need for beautiful people, a need almost 
like hunger . . . How tragic that fate foisted off on him 
a friend-mistress and a nutty wife. What a wild absurdity 
those relationships seem, when you see people of St. 
ExupCry's type. 
April 3: I went to Yelgava, to the agricultural academy. 
My exams and tests are behind me, my first year is behind 
me. I did well in the history of the CPSU, mathematics, 
and physics; I got a C in chemistry. I'm happier about 
that than about all my A's put together. But it's too bad 
I didn't have two or three more days. Slimit is Shmit, 
and it's shameful to pass with just a C from such an 
instructor. 
; April 16: Khikmet is a thousand times right in saying 
that in the 20th century only a genuine Communist can 
be the happiest of men. I want to be that happy. 
May 21: The planting's nearly done, but it's cold. 
May is always capricious. This year we stood firm on 
our right to full autonomy. Down to the last hectare. 
we figured out and decided for ourselves what to plant. 
July 6: The drudgery of harvest time approaches. In 
those fields where neither reapers nor combines can be 
used, we'll cut the grain by hand. We held brigade 
meetings, and a specific rye field was assigned to each 
household. The kolkhozniks determined the dimensions 
themselves, according to their abilities. Everyone is in 
a cheerful mood. In addition to the pay, we're going to 
give out bread. Everyone is clear an our goal: to finish 
up before August 1st. 
The harvest "watchmen" have been approved: they'll 
be responsible for overseeing the collection, weighing, 
and delivery of the grain. As usual, Yazep Kovalsky will 
be one of them. Nobody has ever doubted the honesty of 
this man. He is the conscience of the kolkhoz. 
July 31: All the grain is in. It took seven days. For us 
that's record time. . . . 
Khronika, issue #4. of 31 October 1968, provides some background on ? 
Yakhimovich prior to his being arrested and placed under psychiatric exam?
ination, as follows: 
On 27 October 1968 a search was conducted at the home of Ivan Yakhimovich. 
Yakhimovich, in the not?too?distant past the chairman of the collective farm 
"Yauna Gvardo" in the Kraslavsky Region of the Latvian SSR, was relieved of 
,his job after he wrote his well?known letter to the Central Committee. His 
wife, Irina Yakhimovich, was also expelled from the school where she taught. 
,Now their family, including three children, lives in Yurmala, a town in the 
,Latvian SSR. Irina Yakhimovich works in a kindergarten. Ivan Yakhimovich in 
'the summer of 1968 was illegally deprived of his registration -- in his pass?
port the militia simply cut out the registration stamp -- and, naturally, he 
has not found a job. 
In setting up the search, which was authorized by Kvieshons, the Deputy 
Procuror of Yurmala, it was said that the search would be conducted because of 
the suspected robbery of Yurmala branch of the State Bank in the sum of 19,654 
rubles. Of course, no money was found in the course of the search -- but the 
searchers seized several pieces of samizdat material, the protest letter of 
Yakhimovich on the occasion of the arrest of the participants of the demon?
stration of 25 August, the draft of his unfinished article on the post?January 
development in Czechoslovakia, the personal diary of his wife, etc.

ALEKSANDR SERGF.EVICH YESENIN-VOLPIN (1924- )?
Mathematician and poet-philosopher, son of poet Sergei 
Yesenin (who committed suicide in 1925). Yesenin-Volpin 
was twice imprisoned (in 1949 and 1959), in the latter 
instance for smuggling an "anti-Soviet" philosophical 
treatise to the West. A collection of his poems, A Leal 
of Spring (New York, Praeger), was published in 1961; 
in 1962, his poetry was described by Leonid Ilichev (then 
head of the Ideological Commission of the party's Cen-
tral Committee) as the "ravings of a mentally deranged 
person." On December 5, 1965, led a rally in Moscow's 
Pushkin Square in protest against the arrest of Siniavsky 
and Daniel. On February 19, 1966, challenged the legality 
of the Siniavsky-Daniel verdict in an interview with a 
correspondent of The New York Times. An active pro-
tester against the Galanskov-Ginzburg trial (Docs. 21 
and 32), was picked up at his home in mid-February 
1968 and again taken to a mental institution. In March 
1968, 95 mathematicians protested his forcible confine-

Petition of 95 Mathematicians 
To: The Minister of Health, USSR 
The Procurator General of the USSR 
Copy to: 
Chief Psychiatrist, City of Moscow 
We have learned that the prominent Soviet mathemati-
cian and well-known specialist in the field of mathemati-
cal logic, Aleksandr Sergeevich Yesenin-Volpin, has been 
forcibly, without prior medical examination, and without 
the knowledge or consent of his relatives, placed in Psy-
chiatric Hospital No. 5, Stolbovaia Station, 70 kilometers 
from Moscow. 
The forcible commitment of a talented and entirely able-
bodied mathematician to a hospital for seriously-disturbed 
mental patients and the conditions in which he finds him-
self as a consequence of the very nature of the institution 
subject him to severe mental trauma, are injurious to his 
health, and abase his personal dignity. 
Proceeding from the humanitarian aims of our legisla-
tive organs and, even more, of our public health services, 
we consider this fact a flagrant violation of medical and 
legal norms. 
We request that you intercede immediately and take the 
necessary steps to enable our colleague to [resume] work 
under normal conditions.

to the Minister of Medical Care of the USSR, Academician B. V. Petrovsky, first 
by Academicians A. N. Kolmogorov and P. S. Aleksandrov, and later by 99 other 
scientists (including the greatest Soviet mathematicians-academicians, profes-
sors, winners of Lenin Prizes) did the situation of Volpin improve a bit; nov 
he is once again in Kashthenko Hospital, but in Section 32, which is more 
pleasant than Section 3. 
"The regulation 'Concerning the Urgent Hospitalization of the Psychiatric-
ally Sick Who Represent a Public Danger' (regulations concerning 'Legislation 
on Medical Care,' volume 6, 1963) could be the only official basis for such 
actions. However, in the first place, it is only official and not legal, since 
the very fact of the forcible hospitalization contradicts Articles 58-60 of 
the Criminal Code of the RSFSR under which measures of compulsion of a medical 
nature are established by a court of law. 
"The hospitalization of persons as 'publicly-dangerous' directly contra-
dicts the basic principle of legality, the principle of the presumption of 
innocence, since the confession of being socially dangerous is made by a per-
son who has committed an offense, which can be established only by the verdict 
of a court of law. In the second place, even this somewhat cruel and illegal 
regulation was rudely violated. When someone stays in the hospital for 24 
hours he must be examined by a commission of three men, which did not take 
place in the case of Volpin, nor in the case of Gorbanevskaya. Their rela-
tives were not informed, which they should obligatorily have been according 
to the regulation. Finally, the commission, appointed after the letter was 
sent by the mathematicians, established only that Volpin requires care and it 
partly improved his conditions of confinement in the hospital. According to 
the regulation, the commission was similarly obliged to examine the patient 
once a month and thereupon to report, not whether he is sick in general, but 
rather whether his sickness is of a 'publicly-dangerous nature.' If not, the 
patient is discharged in the care of his relatives. The regular commission, 
which was set up on 17 April, also declared that Volpin needed another month 
and a half to 'get well." 
Note: Brief mention is made in Khronika # 6, 28 February 1969, of A. S. 
Yesenin-Volpin's advice on the legal rights of those who face interrogation, 
as follows: 
"Interrogation may face anyone, sometimes if only because his telephone . 
number is found in a notebook seized in a search. But it is important for a 
person to know not only his own rights, but also the extent of the rights of 
the investigator conducting the interrogation. Volpin's 'Instructions,' even 
though written in the author's own complex style, will provide a great deal 
of legal information necessary for the person being interrogated so that he 
can survive the increasing violations of legality and not become their un-
witting accomplice."

Note: The following is from Khronika # 1, 30 April 1968: 
"N. Gorbanevskaya, without advance notice and without the consent of her 
relatives, on 15 February was transferred from Maternity Home #27, where whe 
was lying to conserve strength for her pregnancy, to Section #27 of the Kash-
chenko Hospital. The decision to transfer her was undertaken with the parti-
cipation of the psychiatric duty officer of the Timiryazevsky Zone, but the 
basis for the transfer was termed the request of the patient to be discharged. 
Al 23 February Gorbanqyskaya was discharged from the Kashchenko Hospital, since 
the psychiatrists con ded that she didn't require treatment.

VALERI YAKOVIEVICH TARSIS (1906- ) Joined 
the party as a young man and worked as an editor in a 
state publishing house. Fought in World Wail' and was 
twice wounded. In the early 1960's, had several novels 
published abroad, including The Bluebottle (London, Col-
lins and Harvill Press, 1962) and Red and Black (New 
York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1963), both of which are set in 
the Stalin era. Arrested in 1962 and kept in an insane 
asylum for seven months after writing a letter to Khru-
shchev calling the Soviet Union an unbearable place to 
live. After his release, wrote Ward 7 (London, Collins and 
Harvill Press 1965), a barely fictionalized account of his 
confinement in which he predicted the inevitable over-
throw of Soviet totalitarianism, which he equated with 
fascism In 1966 was permitted to go to England, where 
he bitterly denounced the Soviet regime and was granted 
political asylum, resulting in the revocation of his Soviet 
citizenship.

Issues 3 & 4 of Khronika reported the arrest of several Leningraders and 
the circumstances of that arrest. In #5 of Khronika, 31 December 1968, it is 
reported that in October, two of the accused -- Nikolay Danilov and Yevgeny 
Shashenkov -- were declared not responsible, and the court prescribed compul-
sory treatment in a psychiatric hospital of a special type, i.e., a hospital-
prison. 
Nikolay Danilov, a jurist, at the end of the 1950's worked as an inter-
rogator of the KGB in the Ukraine and in Sakhalin Oblast, after which he left 
that job and for some time was a common laborer. It was not until recent times 
that he began to work as a legal adviser. He writes poetry. Absenting him-
pelf from the institute, in April 1966, together with Yury Gendler, Lev Kva-
qhensky and Viktor Faynberg he wrote a letter to the General Procuror of the 
11SSR about violations of legal procedures permitted in a Leningrad trial. 
In June 1966 he was kicked out of the institute. Nikolay Danilov has a 9-
year-old daughter. 
Yevgeny Shashenkov is an engineer. In 1960, when a student at Leningrad 
University, he wrote a letter addressed to Stalin, after which he was arrested. 
He experienced every cruelty of the investigator of that period, and then for 
the first time was placed in a prison-like psychiatric hospital. The second 
time he got sent there was in 1963 or 1964. Now he must undergo this experi-
ence a third time. In any event Shashenkov displayed firmness during the 
interrogation and refused to give testimony.

RUSSIA 
Notes from the Underground 
Soviet newspapers almost never men-
tion the acts of protest against gov-
ernment policy that have become com-
monplace in Russia during the past few 
years. Scarcely over do they speak of 
the arreSts and other reprisals against dis-
senters that are now taking place with in-
creasing frequency in the Soviet Union. 
Despite the blanket of official silence, 
there is one publication in Russia that re-
cords the protests and persecution of 
the country's dissenters. It is a small, 
often tattered, clandestine newsletter 
called Chronicle of Current Events. De-
spite constant KGB (secret police) ef-
forts to stamp it out, the Chronicle. 
which usually runs no more than 40 
typescript pages, circulates among in-
tellectuals in Major Soviet cities with 
the speed of a brush fire. 
The Chronicle appears through what 
Russians call satnizdat, which means 
self-publishingt it is a play on the So-
viet term Gosizdat, the state publishing 
house. Behind closed doors, readers type 
copies of the newsletter. which they 
pass on to friends in chain-letter fash- ? 
ion. Fresh news items kir the paper are 
sent back to the anonymous editors by 
the same chain of communication. 
Though anyone who copies or circulates 
the Chronicle faces severe penalties, ten 
issues of the Chronicle have appeared 
since it was launched in 1968: The.. 
front page of a recent issue carries a quo-
tation from the U.N. Bill of Human 
Rights and a list of the cases reported

port on such historical documents as Al-
exander Solzhcnitsyn's letters to the 
Writers Union about the banning of 
his works. The Chronicle regularly of-
fers listings of the latest officially for-
bidden hooks by both Western and Rus-
sian authors circulating in samizdat edi-
tions in the Soviet Union. 
Dispassionate in tone, it prints terse 
bulletins about the condition of polit-

Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, together 
with their labor-camp addresses. Top

Chronicle is to secure civil rights for So-

Alexander Daniel, the 20-year-old son 
of Yuli, was denied admission to Tartu 
University in Estonia, although he had 
been accepted earlier and had graduated 
at the top of his high school class. Re-
cently he was fired from a menial job 
in the computer center of the Moscow 
Engineering Institute. At a meeting 
called to discuss young Daniel's case, 
the rector of the institute, Nikolai Strel-
chuk, expressed particular dissatisfaction 
about the number of Jews, like Daniel, 
who had been hired at the institute. 
On July 11, Genrikh Altunian, a So-

COMMUNIST DEFAMATION EFFORT FAILS  
A libel suit brought by a retired Indian Army officer, Brigadier Eric T. 
Sen, against the Indian Communist Party weekly publication, New Age, and its 
publisher, D. P. Sinha, involved the 1967 publication of a booklet, "I Was a 
CIA Spy in India," allegedly written by John Smith, a former Foreign Service 
communications clerk in the United States Embassy in New Delhi. Smith dis-
appeared in 1960, then turned up in Moscow in 1967 as a defector and as the 
ostensible author of the booklet which was obviously prepared by the Soviets. 
Among other wild accusations, it charged that Sen was involved in CIA activi-
ties in India. 
Brigadier Sen brought suit against the New Age Printing Press, charging 
that it contained libelous references to him. The case had innumerable hear-
ings over the next eighteen months, with the Communists using every legal 
means -- and some illegal -- to defend themselves, to delay the proceedings, 
to discredit Brigadier Sen and to frustrate his suit. In fact, a reading of 
their cross-examination of Brigadier Sen provoked a stinging observation from 
a justice of the Delhi High Court that the Communists had grossly abused their 
opportunity for cross-examination, and that besides casting "wholly unmerited 
aspersion on the character and patriotism of all those distinguished officers 
and soldiers who joined the Indian Army before independence, the questions 
have not the remotest connection with the defense set up by the petitioner 
(accused)." 
Also in the course of the hearings, Bhupesh Gupta, editor of the Commu-
nist Party of India weekly, New Age, and member of Parliament, was convicted 
of contempt of court, an offense involving moral turpitude, by the High Court 
of Delhi as a result of his paper's irresponsible reporting on the case. 
Brigadier Sen endured the Communists' harassments and pressed his case 
to a successful conclusion. On 25 October the Communist Party's official 
publisher of the booklet admitted in open court that his charges were un-
verified; he apologized and regretted the harm caused to Brigadier Sen; and 
he pledged not to publish, print or sell any further edition of the pamphlet 
Following the apology, Brigadier Sen agreed to withdraw his defamation suit.

Compromise allowed in 
'CIA agent' case 
Iiiindustan Times Correspondent 
New Delhi, Oct. 25?Brig. E. T. 
Sen (Retd) and D. P. SInha, 
printer and , publisher of New 
.Age, a Communist Party weekly, 
were today st,Ilowed to enter into 
a compromise by Mr G. S. KaIra, 
Judicial Magistrate, in the defa-, 
=Aim case - filed by Brig. Sen 
against the printer. 
Brig. Sen had charged that a 
pamphlet published by Mr Sinha, 
which ?contained what were pur-
ported to be the confession of 
John Smith, an alleged CIA 
agent, had wrongfully linked his 
name with John Smith"; espion-
age activities in India, and had 
thereby defamed him. 
The compromise was effected 
on an application made by Mr 
Sinha under Section 345 of the 
1 
Criminal Procedure Code. 
In his assurance, ..Mr Sinha 
said: "I published the pamphlet. 
"/ was a CIA Agent in India," a 
Communist Party publication, 
without any intention of causing 
any personal harm to Brig. E. T. 
Sen. When this pamphlet was 
published I had not verified the 
veracity of the allegations con-
tained in the pamphlet from Brig. 
E. T. Sen or 4ohn Smith." 
Mr Sinha said that he was 
sorry for the harm caused to 
Brig. Sen? and that no further 
conies of the osmnloot would be 
printed or sold by him. 
The magistrate allowed, Brig, 
Sen to withdraw his cordolaint 
after he gave an undertaking ,that 
he woula not take any legal Pro-
ceedings about the alljigations 
against him In the pamphlet.

close collaboration to defame In-
nocent rersons in this country as

was established last week in a case 
concerning a CPI publication "I 
was a CIA agent" by Jahn Smith. 
Smith who was F n underling in 
the US embassy in India from 1954 
to 59 claimed In that book that the 
CIA was behind a good lot of poli-
tical events that happened in India 
frcm 1947 to 1966, though he biro-

since long. Later Smith defected 
tO Moscow. Among the persons

publisher of New Age publications,

Mr Sinha told a Delhi judicial mag-
:.-traie that he had failed to verify 
the ilegations against the Brigadier. 
inha also agreed that the Brigad? 
had nothing to do with the CIA. 
.anet then, the CPI's official publish-
openly expressed regret for his 
Jetion and undertook not to pub. 
fish or sell in any manner the same 
aamphlet in any form. 
Accordinp to knowledgeable circles 
the CPI bad taken a high level 
decision to tender an uncoodl? 
By Our Special Correspondent 
(lonal apology fearing the case

would come out if the case pro-

It face and prevent more

h interesting in this context: He 
stated: 
Sinha's Apology 
"I published the pamphlet 'I 
was a CIA agent in India! a 
Comm/List Party Publication 
without any intention of caus-
ing any personal harm to Brig.. 
E. T. Sen. When this pamph-
let was published I had not veri-
6ed the verazity of the ailega? 
lions contained in the parnph et 
from Brig E. T. Sen or. John 
Smith. 
Prig. E. T. Sen has stated that 
he bad nothing to do with the 
CIA and the allegations against 
him are not true. I take him at 
his word and accept his state-
ment as correct. I am sorry for 
the harm caused to him. It is 
regretted. 
There are no more copies of this 
pamphlet in stock with us. No 
further edition of this pamphlet 
2 
will be published, printed or soul 
by me either directly or indi-
rectly. Furthtrmore, Brig E T.' 
Sen can make public this state-
ment in any manner he desires" 
In this context the public opini-
on in India should be well warned 
against Soviet-CPI efforts to elimi? 
nate political opposition by dubb-
ing it as CIA aient. Communist 
publications go all cut to dub peo-
ple they do not like as American 
agents. And as the CPI's official 
publishsr has now confessed they 
have done it In this particular case 
without any verification or any facts 
to support them. It is therefore 
reasonable to suppose that to many 
other cases also the allegations aro 
made without any baslr. The case 
also reveals the close collaboration 
between the Soviet Intelligence sera 
vices who concoct these charges and 
the Communist Party of India 
which spews them through Its net-
work of publications. 
On behalf of Brig. Sen, the case 
was fought by Advocate C. L. 
Sareen. Mr Sateen had shot into 
the limelight after he successfully 
protected a defecting Soviet sailor 
Taresov whom the Russians want-
ed to whisk off after charging him 
falsely with theft. Mr Sareen 
also successfuly represented the 
Soviet student Ulugzade who 
had sought asylum in American 
embassy In New Delhi.

Why was this devious

The version published la

Scantly from the version cir-

cuiated by the Communist 
Central office on November 
29, 1967. . Whole sentences 
have been recast, names that 
are not there in the circulated 
document are there in the

paragraphs have been added 
which do not find a place la

This in Itself is enough to

BHUPESH APOLOGISES: 
The loud-mouthed libellous 
C'17711111/11,TIS have asked for 
Brig. E. T. Sen's forgiveness 
in the defamation case which 
the artny man launched agai-
nst the publisher of NEW

Gupta, for ',printing the pam-
phlet "I WAS A CIA 
AGENT". The slanderous 
pamphlet, 1,411t ten by a for-
mer Amelcan Embassy 
C 
clerk,, had contained wild 
charges agains, some lead-
ing Indians including Gen. 
Thitnavya, Ram Subhag Sin-
gh, Frank Morues. 
One of the victims of the 
communists' vicious character 
assassination campaigns, was 
Brig Sen who took them to a 
court of law. During the hear-
ing of the case of com-
munists arid their lawyers tried 
ORBIT, New Delhi 
23 November 1969 
to malign Sen in a manner 
to which the High Court took 
serious objection, administer-
ing them a "severe warning". 
However after these attempts 
failed, the comrades just caved 
in and tendered the apology. 
Said the printer of the CPI 
weekly: "When this pamphlet,

contained in the pamphlet 
from Brig. E. T. Sep or John

vice conspiracy to discredit 
I dien Army o ecers 
By Our Special Correspondent 
THE Communist Party publication "I Was a 
1 CIA Agent" was a Soviet-CPI plot to sow 
seeds of suspicion between the people on the one 
hand and the army and some leading politicians 
on the other, sources that have analysed the con-
tents of the book suggest. 
The contents of the book 
first appeared in a Soviet 
magazine and later were pub. 
lished in a pamphlet form by 
the CPI. Though an Ame-
rican who was declared of 
unsound mind and who later 
defected to Moscow is its 
official author, its real author 
is the Soviet intelligence which 
dreamt up this plot. 
The Communist Party has, 
after a protracted legal battle 
in which it was humbled, ad-
mitted that the contents relat-
ing to one of the army cfficers 
was unverified and agreed 
that it will neither print nor 
distribute the book as a whole 
or in part, in any form. This 
confessiou, legal circles say, 
came in order to protect the 
CPI from being fully exposed 
in the court for its conspiracy 
with Soviet intelligence. 
[In the earlier two issues 
ORBIT had analysed this 
CPI apology.] 
Fake Incidents 
The attempt to create dia. 
trust of the Indian army's 
officers is patent in the bc.ok. 
The Delhi High Court has 
detected this in analysing the 
cross-examination conducted 
by the CPI counsel. The 
book accuses several officers 
including the late Thimayya 
5 
of being American agentF. 
No proof is produced except 
some misstatements and bear4 
may and what the author John 
Smith says he knows. But 
these ?Negations do not stand 
even elementary scrutiny. 
Counsel C.L. Sareen who 
appeared on behalf of the reti-
red army officer maligned in 
the book proved that the real 
author of the book does not 
know a thing about the Indi-
an army nor much about 
topography of Delhi either. 
He could prove that almost 
every incident mentioned in 
I; is fake. ? 
That the real author of 
the book has made allegations 
without even making sure of 
his facts, is also clear from 
the incidents mentioned 
In the book. In one of these 
he says that a colonel In 
charge of promotions could 
get a car and an aircondi-
tioner because of the money 
he recieved from spying for a 
foreign country. 
However, the fact is that 
this colonel was drawing a 
four figure salary at the time. 
His wife was working in a 
Commonwealth High Corn-
mission and getting a !sigh 
salary. The colonel got his 
car by taking a car loan from 
the government. And as an

party lawyers were unable to 
guide the party properly as in 
regard to contempt to law 
will the CPI stop parading its 
pack of "Supreme Court law-
yers" as paragon of legal wis-
dom anymore?

One more silly piece of 
nonsense is the discovery in 
the communist party pubhca-
'ion that there is no freedom

at that time he claims 
with American money because 
the former Home 'Minister 
had discovered something 
about CIA. Are we to be-
lieve that what Nanda did to 
expose CIA was not followed 
up by his eminent successor? 
Is this not a terrible and cal-
culated slur on the spotless 
character and patriotism of 
Nanda's successor? Surely 
such 'Communist-Soviet plot 
to malign the outstanding 
leaders, of our country should 
not be allowed to go unchal-
lenged: 
The Home Ministry which 
is also concerned with general 
law and order in the country 
must take note of some of 
the 'developments during the 
trial. The Communists who 
first challenged the army offi-
cers to come to court tried to 
use their well known techni-
que of misleading the public 
when the court case proceed-
ed. 
All the Communist organs 
were pressed into service 
to publicise widely the 
proceedings in such a 
manner as to force the 
complainant to leave 
the case. When the com-
plainant went to Delhi 
High Court against the 
publication of truncated 
and tailored versions of 
his testimony, the Delhi 
High Court observed: 
"The hearings and versions 
were not a fair and. 
faithful report of proceed-
ings in the court which 
seems to betray an oblique 
purpose and motive." The 
court further observed: "But 
as their plea is that they were 
ignorant of the precise Impli-
cations of the law of contempt 
and their legal advisers were 
also unable to guide them pro. 
perly..." The Communist 
Party however always parades 
its pack of "Supreme Court 
lawyers" and their collective 
views as the last word in legal 
wisdom in national and inter-
national affairs. It was this

remarked: "The Impugned

This observation of th 
court only strengthens 'th 
conclusion of knowledgeab 
circles that one of the purpos 
of the CPI-Soviet conspirac 
in publishing this book wa

The Communist purpose 
is clear from this. 
The Communists also made 
an attempt to browbeat the 
army officer and his lawyer so 
that they may give up the pro? 
secutlon of the party for lebelo 
lious matter. This again is 
one of the classical communist 
techniques. 
The Delhi High Court ob-
served "it appears to me that 
a considerable portion of the

Malign Army 
? 
It is pertinent to point out 
hero that during the cross ex. 
amination, the Communist 
party's counsel tried to belittle 
the Indian Army and its sense 
of loyalty to the country. The 
Delhi High Court observed 
about this. 
"Apart from the fact the ques--

The Communist party's 
counsel made an attempt to 
implicate the complainant 
army officer with a foreign 
power by suggesting that the 
legal fees of the complainant's 
lawyer was being paid by a 
foreign embassy. When the 
army officer said that he was 
paying it himself, the Commit. 
nist party counsel wanted the 
army officer to produce the 
bank account. 
This Is how the Delhi High 
Court described the incident: ,

Cross-Examination 
"The counsel for the peti-

production of the bank ac-
count of the complainant

nation of the complainant

questions were put Co the 
complaint with regard to the 
payments made by him on go-
count of counsel's fee, not 
even once did the learned 
counsel refer to the statement 
of account called far from the 
bank." No further comment 
is needed.

From Our Special Correspondent 
NEW DELIII : For eighteen months the Commu-
nists tried to wear the gallant old soldier down by 
impugning his patriotism and using smears and 
innuendos to blacken his reputation. And for eighteen 
months retired Brigadier E. T. Sen fought doggedly 
on, trading blow for blow till final victory. 
In the end the publisher of the 
Communist pamphlet that lip-d 
libelled Brig, Sen had to admit 
he had not even bothered to 
check the facts in the discredited 
booklet, which appears to have 
been ghost-written by KGB 
(Soviet Secret Police) hacks in 
the name of John Smith, the 
mentally deranged code clerk 
who defected to Moscow and 
claimed to be a CIA agent. 
In the Rajya Sabha on February 
2, 1968, Congress MP Arjpn 
Arora had asked his Home Minis-
ter: "May I?know if the Govern-
ment has advised its army officers 
mentioned in the pamplet 
WAS A CIA AGENT' to file a 
defamation case so that the vera-
city of the allegatipns may he 
questioned before a court of law?" 
COM. GUPTA'S BIG TALK 
Before the Minister could 
reply, Comrade Bhupesh Gupta' 
of the CPI, who is also the Edi-
tor of the CI'I mouthpiece, NEW 
ACE, shot up in his seat and in-
terjected : "We would welcome' 
that because it would give us a? 
chance to cross-examine and get 
the Prime Minister as a witness.. 
Do it. We welcome it!" 
The defamation case was duly 
filed. But when judgement was 
delivered it turned out that the 
brave Comrade had to eat his 
.7ords. The printer and publisher 
of NEW ACE, in a statement in: 
the court of Mr C. S. Kaira.i 
Judicial Mnistrate, apologised: 
for publishing- the pamphlet. Ice-,j

Brigadier Sen. said there were no! 
Stocks of the booklet in hand, and

ABJECT RETREAT 
In the lawyers' chamber.. Bhu* 
pesh t;tipta, it is reliably learned, 
begged opposing Counsel to fcir-
give and forget, folding his hands 
in repentance. 
Like his dear Prime Minister, 
whom he wished to cross-examine 
in court, Bhupesh confessed that 
the charges in the pamphlet were 
based on "wrong assumptions" 
and Inmee untenable! 
The apology tendered by D. P. 
Sinha, Manager and Publisher of 
NEW AGE (Editor: Bhupesh 
Gupta) says : 
"I published the pamphlet

Li Communist Party publication. 
without any intention of causipg 
any personal harm to Brig. E. T.

"When the pamphlet- was

"Brig. E. T. Sen has stated

ENDS IN A WHIMPER 
So ended in a whimper the 
massive character assassinatipn 
campaign the Communist Party 
had mounted in 1907 against a 
number of reputable Indians who 
opposed India being turned into 
a Soviet satellite. The pamphlet 
was part of the game. Supposed 
to have been written by a former 
dismissed clerk of the American 
Embassy, it contained allegations 
against Gen. Thimayya, Dr Ram 
Subhag Singh, Mr Frank Monies 
and a host of other well-known 
personalities. 
Brig. E. T. Sen, who filed the 
defamation case, was one of the 
main victims of the John Smith 
smear campaign. He took up the 
challenge that Bhupesh Cupta 
threw in the Rajya Sabha on 
February 29, 1968. 
The Communists played it 
pretty rough. There were some 
vicious attempts by their lawyers 
to break Brig. Sen in Court and 
NEW AGE and PATRIOT indul-
ged in tendentious and highly-
coloured reports. 
But these tactics proved a dis-
mal failure. Contempt of Court 
proceedings were launched against 
the two journals and they were 
given a "severe warning" for 
misleading reporting. 
In his judgement on October 
17, 1969, Justice Hardayal Harilv 
of the Delhi High Court did not 
mince his words when he com-
mented on the conduct of the 
lawyers defending the Communist 
slanderers : - 
GROSS ABUSE 
"At several places the cross-
examintion (by the defendani's 
lawyer) was apparently directed 
to matters which have not the 
remotest connection with the 
matters in this issue. A number 
of questions would appear to 
have no more connection with the 
the case than what the journey 
of the American Astronauts to 
the moon mizht have with the 
political situation in Czechoslova-
Ida or India. And vet onees dna 
pages of the record seem to be 
filled with such quotations. 
 it appears to me that a 
considerable portion of the cmss-
examination of the complainant 
(Brig. Sen) is n gross abuse of the 
opportunity afforded for cross-
examining." 
We reproduce a sampling of 
the line of cross-examination: 
Q. Did you have any conscience ? 
to join the Army (in 1940) con- 1 
trolled by the foreign rulers when 
you joined? 
Q. Did you join the Army be-
cause you were keen to fight the 
Fascists of Germany and Italy?. ? 
Q. When you joined the Army 
were you aware that there was 
national revolt for the freedem 
of the country? 
Q. Were you aware in 1940 
that the British Army was being 
used to suppress the Indian 
National Movement? 
. Q. Were you aware that the 
Indians hired by the British rulers 
in the Indian Army as also the 
British officers of the Indian Army 
were used to suppress the National 
Movement of the country? 
Q. Did you or did you not have 
any qualms of conscience that you 
were likely to be used against 
the National Movement in the 
Indian Army? 
Q. Was it your aim M 1941 to, 
serve the British masters or India 
after independence? 
Q. Were you completely in-. 
different to the political and 
military objectives which may be 
assigned by the British Govern-
ment to the Army when you 
joined the Army? 
Said Justice Hardy : "Apart 
from the fact that the questions 
have a tendency to cast n wholly 
unmerited aspersion on the 
character and patriotism of nil 
those distinguished officers apd 
soldiers who joined the Indian' 
Arrny before Independence, the 
questions have not the remotest

The John Smith-KGB, memos,

character assassination tactics.

jurists Furious At Red 
SIants if Gen. Thimayya 
NEW DELI!!: Parliamentary .'circles are deeply 
perturbed by the Communists slandering the Indian 
Army in the now impugned pampNet "I was a CIA 
Agent," fabricated by the Russians and the CPI to 
malign such distinguished sons of India as Brigadier 
Sen, the late Gen. K. S. Thimayya and, a number of 
other disting.uished soldiers and politicians, painting 
them as traitors to their country. 
The- pamphlet was published 
by the official Communist organ, 
NEW AGE, edited by Comrade 
Bhupesh Gupta, MP. The court 
proceedings were reported exten-
sively in NEW AGE and PAT-
RIOT, the two Russian financed 
papers, ? "in a tendentious man-
as was held by the Court, 
which administered theM a severe 
warning. 
But the Communists also ac-
cused Cen. Thimayya, and for this 
they have not apologised. The 
question tho outraged Indian na-
tion and its Army would like 
these Russian collaborators _to 
answer is : 
Was Gen. K. S. Thimayya, the 
illustrious soldier of India, a CIA 
agent? 
In normal circumstances, one 
would expect Mrs Indira Gandhi 
or Y. B. Chavan to force the 
Communists to apologise. Thpy 
are, however, new allies of theiss. 
But the PEOPLE are waiting for 
an answer. 
Four Parliamentarians have re-
peated the question MARCH now 
poses to the Indians. 
"REPREHENSIBLE" 
In a letter to the Brigadier's 
lawyer, C. L. Sareen, Mr M. C. 
Setalvad says: "It was a delibe-
rate and reprehensible attempt to 
libel the Brigadier and other offi-
cers of the Indian army. I km 
not an active politician, but if an 
opportunity arises, I shall certain-
ly take up a proper attitude in 
the matter in Parliament." 
Says Mr Ashok Mehta; "I cop-
gratulate you and Brig. E. T. Sen 
on the firm stand you took. You 
have exposed the technique of 
character assassination much fav-
oured by certain sections of poli-
tical opinion in the country today. 
I agree with your analysis and 
with the alert you have sounded 
against palpable dangers." 
In his forwarding note to the 
Members of Parlhunent, lawyer 
Sarcen says: "In the impugned 
pamphlet, several army officers, 
both named and unnamed, were 
clubbed CIA agents. Our illustri-
ous soldier, Cen. Tbknayya, as 
also not spared. The retired BO-

and, despite all the calumny and 
threat, risk of exposure of ids

"'It appears to me that a con-
siderable portion of the cross-
examination of the complainant is 
a gross abuse of the opportunity 
afforded to the accused for cross-
examination of the complainant!" 
After quoting these strictures 
by the judge against the Com-
munists', Sareen appealed to the 
Parliamentarians: 
"As a Parliamentarian charged 
with the defence of the country's 
interest, you cannot afford to 
leave the matter at that. The 
pamphlet is a part of an arganis-
ed attentrit to create distil:1st 
between the people and the Army. .. 
This itself should be serious. llut 
as the pamphlet was published in 
collusion with a foreign country, 
the enormity of the crime can be 
understood. 
:"The attempt to malign inno-
cent people, to sow the seeds of 
suspicion about the patriotism of 
the Army among the people by 
the CPI, in collusion with a 
foreign country, you would agree, 
merits attention at the highest 
level. 
"The people, several of whom 
are victims of similar calumny by 
certain political parties in collu-
sion with a foreign power, but t 
who cannot defend themselves, .? 
now look up to you to protect 
the from such nefarious activi-
ties."
? MARCH of the NATION 
sincerely hopes Parliament will 
take up this issue and prevent 
the honour and integrity of 
India's fighting men being sul-
lied by those to whom slander h 
a convenient weapon and the big 
lie . an accepted way of life.

Distinguishing the Palestinian Commando Organizations  
All Palestinian commando organizations have the same basic aims: 
(a) the regaining of all of Palestine, including present-day Israel, and 
the establishment of a Palestine state which would include Muslims, Christ-
ians, and Jews; and (b) the rejection of a peaceful solution of the Arab-
Israeli impasse, and the use of armed force as the chief weapon against 
Israel. 
The Major Palestinian Organizations: 
1. The Palestine Liberation Movement (Fatah), the largest commando 
organization, has no special allegiance to any particular state or political 
party. In contrast, other major commando groups are sponsored by either an 
Arab government or a political party (sometimes both). 
2. The nucleus of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  
(PFLP) comes from the George Habbash wing of the leftist Arab Nationalist 
Movement (ANM). The ANM's more extreme Marxist-Leninist faction, led by 
Nayif Hawatmah, controls the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of  
Palestine (PDFLP). 
3. The Vanguard of the Popular Liberation War and its military arm, al-
Saiqa, are sponsored and controlled by the Syrian Government and the Syrian 
Ba'th Party. 
4. The Arab Liberation Front (ALF) was created by the Iraqi Government 
and the Iraqi Ba'th Party. 
5. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964 by 
the Arab Summit conference as a quasi-governmental organization. It has a 
regular army of its own, the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), and a commando 
unit, the Popular Liberation Forces, which was formed after the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war. 
In February 1969, after al Fatah succeeded in taking over its control, 
the PLO began to function as an umbrella for the various commando organiza-
tions and other Palestinian groups. Its Palestine Armed Struggle Command  
(PASC) coordinates the release of information concerning fedayeen commando 
operations, and is also to coordinate their military activities. PASC now 
includes eight commando organizations. The PFLP is the only.major fedayeen 
group which has not yet joined and which still continues to operate inde-
pendently of PASC. Efforts are being made to bring PFLP into both the PLO 
and PASC, but so far no agreement has been reached.

Differences between the Commandos: 
1, Party affiliations and sponsorship. 
Arab governments sponsoring commando groups have tended to give their 
time and effort to their own rather than to Fatah and other groups. They 
have also been suspicious of commandos sponsored by a rival government or 
political party and have at tines deported them or curtailed their activities. 
2, Nature of cooperation. 
Disagreements have arisen over reorganizing the PLO and over representa-
tion in that body. Fatah favors proportional representation, depending on 
the size of the commando organization, and is against equal votes for each 
commando group because the small groups could then paralyze action with their 
veto? 
3. Smaller vso larger groups. 
Fatah is against the formation of smaller groups because it feels that 
these are being used to sap the energy of the bigger organizations. In con-
trast, the small commando groups feel that they serve a useful purpose and 
reflect differences of opinion. 
4. Class struggle. 
Most commando groups consider themselves representative of progressive 
national liberation movements. The PDFLP believes that the commandos should 
only include the workers and peasants because of the collusion between im-
perialism and the big bourgeoisie. Fatah believes that this class limitation 
would weaken the movement and that Marx's class breakdown is not applicable 
to the Palestinian situation anyway. 
5 Palestinian vs. Pan-Arab movement. 
Some groups such as the ALF emphasize the Pan-Arab nature of the struggle. 
Others such as Fatah consider the conflict as primarily a Palestinian one 
linked with the Arab revolution. 
6. PFLP strategy. 
Although the commandos sympathize with any attacks against Zionist, im-
perialist, and Israeli interests, only the PFLP has engaged in terrorism 
against these targets abroad. Fatah has registered its opposition to those 
activities, and at this time the PFLP is alone among the commando groups in 
undertaking them.

Hue Massacre: 
Effort to Destroy 
Entire Society 
Authority Says Murders 
Were According to Plan 
and Almost 6,000 Died 
BY ROBERT S. ELEGANT 
Times Staff Writer 
HONG KONG?"A squad with a 
death order entered the home of sr 
community leader and shot him, his 
wife, his married son and daughter-
in-law, his young unmarried daught-
er, a male and female servant and 
'their baby. The family cat was 
tr an d; the family dog was 
'clubbed to death; the family goldfish 
were scooped out of the fishbowl 
and tossed on the floor." 
? Douglas Pike, a leading authority 
"nn communism in Vietnam, reports 
that scene after conducting an 
intensive investigation of events in 
Hue when_ the Communists held the 
old imperial city for 24 days in 
February, 1968, and slaughtered 
What he estimates was almost 6,000 
'civilians for political purposes. 
"When the Communist squad left," 
he continues, "no life remained in 
'the house. A 'social unit' had been 
eliminated." 
Foreign Service Officer 
, Pike, a Foreign Service officer, is' 
the author of "Viet Cong," the boolc 
generally judged the single most 
authoritative and exhaustive study 
of communism in South Vietnam. 
The extinction of the community 
leader's family "was not due to rage, 
frustration or panic," Pike said. The 
execution" was part of what Pike 
identifies at "Phase II" of the 
continuously sanguinary Commu-
nist occupation, when "cadres be-
lieved for a few days that they were 
permanently in Hue?and acted 
accordingly." 
He notes ' that Ale Viet COM 
thereupon launched "a -period of 
social reconstruction. Cominiinist 
style. Death orders went out againat 
'social negatives,' Individuals or 
groups who represented a potential 
ilanger for liability." 
There was no discernible personal 
animus, despite the wanton cruelty 
that tortured the pets. 
"This was quite impersonal." Pike 
said. It was not a blacklist of 
Individuals but a blacklist of titieS 
and positions in the old society. It 
was directed not against people, but 
against 'social units'?religious ots, 
ganizations, political parties and 
social movements like women's and 
youth associations." 
5,800 Dead or Missing 
By Pike's count, based on his own 
research and local estimates, 5,800 
Hue civilians are dead or missing, 
and the missing are not likely to 
reappear. In addition, 1,800 civilians 
were hospitalized, making a total of 
7,600 civilians killed, abducted or 
Injured by the Communists. 
Pike said almost all the killing was 
dictated by political aims and or-
dercd by political commissars. A 
few civilians, not more than several 
hundred at most, were killed or 
Injured in the course of battle. 
So far, 2,780 bodies have been 
recovered from the mass graves 
where the Communists carefully hid 
their victims. Further finds are 
made daily. But Pike does not 
expect all the bodies to be recoyerq 
(because the Communists 
went out of their way to 
conceal the mass graves. 
The number of deaths 
would probably have been 
higher but for the limita-
tions of time and circum-
stances," he said. 
Out of approximately 
75,000 persons under ef-
fective Communist rule, 
for about three weeks,' 
7,600 became casualties. 
Even allowing the widest' 
latitude for battle casual-
ties and inadvertent kill-
ings, that means not less 
than 5% of the civilian 
populace and perhaps as 
high as 10% were deliber-1 
ately slaughtered. 
Pike, now stationed in: 
Tokyo with the U.S. Infor-, 
nation Service, lived in 
Yietnam for eight Years. 
? 
before writing "Vi e t 
Cong." During a leave of 
absence he returned to 
Vietnam, as he does perio-
dically, and spent more 
than a week early this' 
November pursuing his 
research in Hue. 
Lengthy Conversation 
Ills findings and conclu-
sions as reported here are 
abstracted from a lengthy, 
personal conversation and 
the draft of his report on 
his investigations at Hue. 
After his research, Pike 
believes that the massacre 
of Hue will be the pat4 
tern for nationwide acs 
tion should the Commu-
nists conquer South Viet, 
nam. He bases that conclu-
sion upon the fact that the 
massacres were deliberate 
acts of policy, rather than 
random individual deeds. 
He divides the Commu-
nist campaign against the 
civilians of Hue into three 
periods: 
Phase I occurred during 
the first few days of the 
occupation, when the Viet 
Cong did not expect to 
stay but wished to make 
an example and to "break 
the enemy's administra-
tive structure." 
"Civilian cadres," Pike 
said, "accompanied by fir-
ing squads executed key! 
!individuals to weaken 
'governmental administra-
tion following Communist' 
withdrawal. This was the \ 
'blacklist period, the time 
pf the drum-head court. 
Kangaroo Courts 
' "Cadres with clipboards 
,bearing lists of names and 
'addresses summoned Va-
rious 'enemies of the revo-
lution' to kangaroo courts. 
Public trials usually lasted 
'about 10 minutes, and 
there were no known run.-
'guilty verdicts. Punish-
knent, invariably execu-
tion, was meted out imme-
diately." 
Aside from "particularly* 
venomous attack on Hue 
intellectuals," w h o de-

procedure. 
Phase II was the period 
of "social reconqruction." 
In order to "build a, new 
social order, it was neces-
sary to purge the old 
order," The "social nega-
tive s" were eliminated. 
Anyone who might stand 
in the way of the Commu-
nists' consolidating their 
hold and imposing , their 
own rule was killed. 
During Phase 11 approx-
imately 2,000 of the 5,800 
dial, including the family 
that was slaughtered, even 
to cat, dog and goldfish. 
Worst Phase 
Phase HI, however, was 
the worst. During the last 
week of their sniy, the 
Communists knew theyt 
would be forced to ,with 
draw. They were deter-
mined to leave no witnes-
ses who might testify 
against them or identify. 
the 150 clandestine Com-
munist cadres who had; 
"surfaced" to i ale Due. 
"Most victims were 
kil-
led in batches during Ibis 
period. At the Sand Dune 
Grave they were tied 
together in groups ,of 10 
and cut down with sub-
machine guns." 
? Pike adds: "A favorite 
local sonvenie is a spent' 
Russian m a c Ti in e - gun, 
shell taken from a 1,;rave. 
Frequently, the dead were: 
buried in layers of three or 
four, making iticritifica.t 
tion particularly difficult."' 
He believes the Hw 
massacres were different 
from other Viet Cong ter-
roriSm "not only in degree, 
but in kind." 
? New Government , 
It was not the , quick 
terror used to build Viet 
Cong morale or to frighten 
the populace but the slow, 
intensifying terror intend-
ed to create the basis of.si 
new government. . ? 
"There was no agonized 
outcry, no demonstrations 
at North Vietnamese em-
bassies around the world,". 
Pike said. "Lord Russell;

said, "one is submerged in

French Reds Hint Chiefs Ouster 
fly PATRICIA email 
Voris Ruteou 01 The Suns 
Paris, .DCC. 12?A French 
Communist party announcement 
on the illness of the party secre-
tary, Waldeck Rochet, appears 
tot have confirmed reports that 
he will be ousted as leader of the 
Vest's second-largest Commu-
nist party at its next Congress in 
'February. 
The communique from party 
headquarters last night said Mr. 
Rochet had been advised by his 
doctors to begin "several 
months of convalescence and re-
duced activity." 
The 64-year-old Communist 
leader has undergone surgery 
twice this year for kidney and 
prostate trouble. 
Strong Constitution 
A man with a strong constitu-
tion, Mr. Rochet has told party 
officials and Moscow that he will 
soon be fit again. 
, According ' to Informed 
sources, his doctors have sec-
onded this verdict, but the party 
Is apparently turning s deaf ear. 
Since Mr. ,Rochet succeeded 
The late Maurice Thorez in 1964, 
he has been the center of contra 
? versy, starting with a brief in-
tra-party struggle before be 
,even landed the Job. 
, The invasion Of ezdchoslo-
NAIR by Russian troops in 1968 
caused Mr. Rochet considerable 
!toddy. The amblguout $111tude 
of the French Communist party, 
which was split over whether to 
support the invasion reinforced 
this. Mr. Rochet was attacked 
by the conservative wing of the 
party for following Moscow only 
after a period ef hesitation. 
The liberals took him apart 
for not taking a strong stand 
against Russian occupation of 
Prague. -* 
Two men figure prominently, 
In the Speculation as to who will 
succeed Mr. Rochet. Both of. 
them are pillars of the Political 
Bureau. 
Roland Leroy, a 43-year-old 
deputy for the Seine-Maritime 
department, is secretary of the 
Central Committee of the Com-
munist party. His mission has 
been to control the dissident in-
tellectuals. A protege of Maurice 
Thorez, his main drawback is 
his youthful ardor. He is known 
as a man in a hurry. 
Fifty-year-old Georges Mar-
chats, on the other hand, is s 
"Stalinite" of the old school. Un-
like Mr'. Leroy. he has never 
been in the public eye, and is 
what the Russian Communists 
call an "apparatehik." ilk du:
