 U lien the remnants of the Chinese Corwinnist Army  reached northern
 Ghensi after the long trek of 1934-35, they decided upon five basic
 principles to guide them in their reorganization and long-range
 training program.  Three of these principles worst  To use the land
 reform noverent as a reans of amplifying the source of soldiers,
 to nut soldiers not on active conbat duty into oroduction activities;
 and, to equalize the treatment of officers and men. The last two
 principles, which were the nucleus of a plea for political activity
 within the mititnrjt were as follows:
 a.  To convert the Party Delegate System into the Political Work
 System and thus bring the production line and the front line
 into the Party; to expand, the Party organization within the aru
 and thus strengthen the control of the Party over the IQilf tart'.
 To extend the educational rovement in the array and bring about
 a reduction of illiteracy 1W a cultural education programs to
 spread the theories of Communism among all ranks of fighting
 men, from top commanders to enlisted men, and thus heighten their
 appreciation of Party policies and of practical training in the
 'business of war; to promote discussions of present-day problems
 in order to raise the cultural level of the army and to strengthen
 its Party c mrehension, that is, its political faith.
 Time the system of political activity in the military was established.
 Thur. i ng the last decade, the Chinese Communist Artgr under the ny s tem of
 political tutelage has grown strong.  It has continuously succeeded
 with small forces in shattering the numerically vastly superior
 Nationalist forces.  It has now succeeded in conquering the entire
 Chinese mainland and establishing its political power therein<  P!ach
 of the credit for this accomplishment should go to the system of
 political activity in the military.
 2.    Chinese Communist Party Political Work Systen in the Militaryr
 L.he Political Work Organization in the military is intended to carry
 T
 out the will of the Party, to follow the leadershiv of the Party, to
 carry out the orders cf the Party, and to advance the progress of
 political activity in the rilitary establishment.
 The Political work Organization is not under the direction of any
 milit=7 organization of equal rank, but is ceoreiinate with each
 ri li taay unit on each level.  Under the General Haaliquarters of the
 Chinese Communist Ara W, as well as in the Military Districts and In
 the Public Security Forces, there are two systems operating on an
 equal basis in all units down to the company level.  One sysLem is
 responsible for all military activities, from cermsanders to enlisted
 men.  The other system is responsible for political activities.

 With regard to corimiesa.ry service, sanitation, military
 movements, military campaigns. and enc  m ants, the political
 organization mast follow the orders of the military.  In
 matters of political training and activity among the messes,
 the military organization mast follow the directions of the
 iolitical organization.  Orders should be transmitted only
 through the regular channels of the respective organizations.
 ?)  Party expenses are paid by the political deoartment.
 (8) All military orders must be countersigned by the political
 commissar.  Chairmen of the T}alitieal departments do not need
 to sign.  Orders of the political departments are issue,
 Independently and the military commander need not countersign.
 From the above regulations it may appear that the political and
 military organizations are coordinate; actually this is not the case.
 The political organization is above the rilita17.  All decisLans of
 the military must be concurred in by the political commissars, thus
 he political organization controls the military.
 Power of the Chinese Communist Party over the Military
 The Party employs two methods for controlling the military.  Brat,
 it sets no its own organization in the mil=tart' establishment and
 organizes Party committees on all levels, thus directly controlling
 the basic personnel and cadres of the military.  Second, the Par?
 controls the Political Work Organization in the military and thus
 indirectly controls the military,
 a   Party Organization in the Military
 (1)  In the General Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Army,
 as well as In the headquarters of the Military District Pbrces
 and. the Public Security Forces, there is a Party committee.
 At the head of the cormaittee are a secretary and one or two
 deputies.  The committee is composed of seven to fifteen
 members who carry the responsibility for the Party activity
 throughout the military,
 (2)        The Party organization in the field armies, aa?r groups, armies,
 and divisions is the same as in the General ffeadquarters of the
 Chinese Con-mist Arzr.
 (3)     iments have central branch departments: battalions have
 central sub-branch denartrants; companies have branch
 departments; and platoons and squads have cells.  The personnel
 will be determined by the status of the unit to which it
 belongs and the nurber of Party members in the unit.
 #)        Under special circumstances a tem,aorary front line Party
 work committee may be organized where action is on a base area.
 Its organization will resemble that of the Party committee in a
 field army.
 (5)
 The Party* e   in objective in military units shall be to expand
 its membership among the enlisted r.,en of the combat force.
 Company and platoon leaders may be chosen from among nor Party
 members. but squad leaders must be Party mer+bers.

 6)   According to statistics of the Chines Cotnmrnist Party
 compiled in August 1950, there were 1,200,000 Party members
 in the armed forces.  This is 20 percent of the total
 strength of %he Chinese Communist Arm.  Consequently the
 will of the Party/ is very easily transmitted through Party
 organization to the lowest ranks.
 b.    relationship of the party to the Political Work Organizations.
 (1)  From the political department of the Chinese Comnmxnist Arm
 down to the diiision level, the duties of the political
 com* iasars are carried on by the secretary of the Party
 eorwiiittee in the unit concerned.  Thus the high.ranktr ,
 Political Work Organization personnel are largely Party
 committee members also.
 ('2) Because there are no political departments in regiments
 and battalions, the political commissar does not serve as
 secretary of the central and central eab-branch departments.
 The secretary of these branch organizations assist$ the
 comnisear in carrying on the work.
 (3)
 The political advisor of a com?  y acts concurrently as
 secretary of the branch department, since the number of
 persons in a comparq is not large and the arount of work,
 is consequently less.
 c-      l cecutiou of the Will of the Party by the Political Work Organisation
 The Party organization In the armed forces can control only Party
 members.  It cannot directly influence officers and men who are not
 "arty members.  The Party, therefore, must control the thole of
 the military indirectly through the Political Work Organization.
 It has already be stated that in certain -ahases of the relationship
 between the Party and the Political Work Organization in the
 armed forces, the responsible personnel of the Party act concurrently
 as political commt,ssers.  Thus actually the Political Work
 Or anization in the armed forces is a part of the Party ord.^,nization.
 T'he will of the Party can be coareyed from the PariWls military
 committee through the political commissars to the political
 departnents.  Thus it nay be said that all the activities of the
 Political ,Tor?,. Organization are merely to transmit the will of
 the Party throughout the entire personnel of the armed forces,
 whether they be Party members or not.
 Thus it is evident that the Party, in order to control the military
 thoroughly and carry out the will of the Party, not only sets up
 the Party organizations in the armed forces, but also controls the
 Political Work Organization.
 4~   Protection of the Party by the Political Work Organization
 The control of the armed forces by the Chinese Con unlst Party arsneare
 to be a totr?to bottom arrangement carrying the decisions of the,
 Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party through the Political
 Work Organization to the individual enlisted man.  However, the Political
 Work Organization not only transmits the decisions of the Party to the
 individual soldier, but it also coordinates the activities of every

 The members of a squad carry out a squad's responsibility, and thug

 o t the Chinese Communist Ar ' . the whole military structure Is bound
 togother in carrying out the vishee of the Party  Thus does the
 Political Work Organization protect the interests of the Party In the
 armed forces.
 Tne Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Panty expects two
 things of its iereonnel in the political activities program in the
 armed forces.  first, they asst steMy and strengthen the martial.
 spirit in the arced forces.  Second, they must carat out every order
 absolutely.
 a. Stabilization and Intensification of the Fighting Spirit in the Military
 MAO Tse-tung has said that the significance of the Chinese
 Corn"anist Arri  lies in the fact that it is the armed representative
 of the classes in carryine opt their political responsibilities.
 Its work is to establish and bulvark political rower.  He-said
 furtliur that the Chinese Comrinnist Arvy needs a fighting rank and
 f?ie; hence, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee 9xpects
 !;he personnel of the Political Work Organization to stabilize and
 intensify the martial spirit of the armed forces, so as to on the
 one hand support the existing political establishment and on the
 other to be prepared to meet azy enemy attack.  The Political
 Work Crank 2ation depends upon education to carry out its ditties.
 The present e&acati'nal progTa.:  is an follows:
 (l)  Political classes to rates the level of politici t corsscto'anees.
 (2)  Morning and evening lectures at roll call to establish
 political and military discipline.
 (3)  Collection of speeches for the iadoctrinatioa and education
 of officers and men in the spirit of the revolution a9A
 patriotism.
 (4)  Special slogans such as "protect the lands %revtenge past
 vrongs,r and "carry the revolution to completion" to aetaabltah
 firmly the political views of the rank- and file.
 Reading of Party -publications, political documents, and books
 in order to-understand the state of the Party.

 noon-Party members in carrying
 This sort of liaison work frequently results in the marrying out
 of the political workers' orders and also accomplishes the purpose
 of the protection of the Party.
 Relationship between the Military and the People under the Political
 ,fork System.
 The Political Work Organization not only protects the control of the
 Party over the military, but also insures cooperation between the armed
 forces and the people.  MAO Tee-tung has said that the responsibility
 of the military is not solely to fight, it also has the responsibility
 of propagandising, organizing. and arming the masses.  Separated from
 the people, the purpose of warfare is entirely lost, as well as the
 value of the military.  Hence, the political workers have a responsibility
 for work among the masses.
 During the last several ddcadea, there has been a great gulf between the
 Chinese military and the peo-ols.  The military cheated and oppressed the
 people, the people hated the army, and no cooperation was ever
 possible.  However, the Chinese Communist Army has demolished this
 line of demarcation.  Where ever the Chinese Communist Army has been
 engaged, the Chinese Communist Party has used every device to arouse
 the people to join in the support of the troops by giving of their
 manpower and their wealth to aid in the struggle of the Chinese Communist
 Party.  The present situation is due largely to this factor, without
 regard to whether the cooperation was always out of a genuine love of
 the cause.   The political work program carries on the following
 activities to improve relations between the military and the peonls
 a.      Within the military.
 (1)  Promote the love of the people and the strict enforcement of
 the three disciplines and the eight i^-portant comrandso thus
 obviating the chief obstacles to close cooperation between
 the military and the people.
 (2)  Assist the people In their production activities, thus laying
 a foundation for class friendship between the military and
 the people.
 (3)  Spread the idea that it is the political responsibility of
 the military to liberate the people from their distress;, while
 at the same time promoting the martial s-airit of the people,
 thus furthering the idea that the military and the people
 have common interests in both good times and bad.
 (4)  Effect the economic rehabilitation of the poor workers and
 peasants through struggle, land reform, and the liquidation
 of evil landlords.  Thus the degree of support afforded the
 military by the people will be increased.
