 China-USSR: Maneuvering In The Triangle
 Summary
 Over the past year Beijing has unilaterally moved to establish a
 broader framework for normalizing relations with Moscow that could open
 the way for an expanded political dialogue and resumption of
 party-to-party contacts. These steps reflect China's increased confidence
 In its ability to maneuver within the Sino-US-USSR strategic triangle--a
 confidence stemming in part from steady improvements in Sino-US
 relations, its reading of the US-USSR strategic balance, and Soviet signals          25X1
 Although Beijing probably does not expect any significant change
 soon in Soviet policy on the security issues that divide them, it may be
 preparing to make a greater effort to probe the limits of Moscow's
 flexibility. The Chinese probably have concluded that they have little to
 lose by,offering General Secretary Gorbachev some inducements,
 calculating that at a minimum this gives them more leverage with the
 United States. They probably are also convinced that they can control the

 pace of any improvements in Sino-Soviet relations to avoid endangering
 their expanding ties with the West. The Chinese, in our view, do not
 appear to have a clearly thought out strategy, however, and could end up
 moving further toward accommodating Moscow than they now
 envision--especially if Gorbachev responds with some new, more
 imaginative Initiatives of his own.
 The Soviets, for their part, are undoubtedly pleased by the recent
 progress in relations but realize they may still have lost some ground in
 the triangular relationship. Apprehensive about Sino-US ties, particularly
 In the military sphere, Moscow seems to be trying to develop a "China
 card" of its own in the hope of driving a wedge between Beijing and
 Washington. The Soviets, while apparently encouraging an improvement in
 Sino-Mongolian relations, have yet to offer China any security
 concessions. It remains to be seen, therefore, whether Gorbachev will
 give relations with China a higher priority
 and reassess the old policy of encirclement and military
 intimidation. If he does, we could eventually see the Soviets float some
 new initiatives on troop deployments along China's northern perimeter or
 Beijing's Game
 Creeping Normalization
 25X1
 25X1 I
 The Chinese continue to insist that they will not "normalize" political relations
 with Moscow until the Soviets accommodate China on at least one of the so-called
 "three obstacles:" agreeing to withdraw from Afghanistan, stopping support to the
 Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, or reducing Soviet forces deployed against China.
 Yet they have steadily doled out small, symbolically important helpings of normalization   25X1
 over the past year without any Soviet quid pro quo.
 Since. last winter, for example, Beijing has begun once more to refer to Soviet
 leaders as "comrade" and the Soviet Union as "socialist," terms not used since the
 mid-1960s. More recently, the Chinese have restablished parliamentary relations and
 agreed to resume trade union ties, and exchange foreign minister visits sometime next      25X1
 year. Chinese leaders also made a not so subtle display of their. "independence" on. the
 eve of the Geneva summit by receiving the Soviet American specialist Arbatov and a
 delegation of the Supreme Soviet at the same time they hosted Vice President Bush.
 The Chinese continue to insist they are not prepared to resume formal
 party-to-party ties. But we believe that if asked, they might be tempted to send an
 observer to the next Soviet party congress, scheduled for next February, although they
 probably would carefully weigh the US reaction first. A Chinese Foreign Ministry

 spokesman coyly turned aside a journalist's question recently on this subject by saying
 only that China had not been invited.
 In pursuing this more conciliatory tack, the Chinese have not abandoned their
 view of the Soviet Union as the main threat to their security and geopolitical interests.
 Rather, we believe they see increasing opportunities for China to maneuver between the
 superpowers--if only on the margin. This confidence may be based on several
 assumptions:
 ? That neither the current US-USSR rivalry nor the balance of strategic forces will
 change significantly over the rest of this decade, thus Beijing need not fear
 superpower collusion against its interests. The outcome of the Geneva summit
 probably, has not altered the Chinese view, although they clearly will be watching
 the evolution of US-USSR relations closely over the coming months for some
 signs of change.
 ? Having placed their relations with the United States on a firmer footing over the
 past two years, China is, in a stronger position to move forward with Moscow
 without appearing to do so out of weakness.
 ? Finally, a younger more reform oriented Soviet leadership may in time be willing
 to reassess its policy toward China, thus it is in China's interest to offer
 Whether Deng Xiaoping shares these assumptions is unclear. Earlier this year he
 was under pressure from some of his Politburo critics--Chen Yun and Peng Zhen--to
 expand economic and political contacts with Moscow at a faster pace, according to US
 Embassy reporting and our media analysis. Since Deng was unable to shunt them aside
 at the recent party congress, we suspect that they and perhaps some within Deng's own
 reform wing of the party, are continuing to press for the adoption of a more flexible
 strategy in dealing with Moscow and Washington.
 Prospective Gains and Potential Danger
 Beijing, for its part, is likely to continue gradually to expand economic and
 political contacts with Moscow, leaving the way open for Gorbachev to respond more
 positively to China's security concerns. It may even be preparing to make a more
 intense effort to probe the limits of Soviet flexibility. The Chinese probably believe that
 at minimum improving relations serves their modernization program by keeping tensions
 manageable. They also regard the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc states as potential
 markets for goods, such as textiles, that they are having a harder time selling in the
 West and as sources for some technology they need, such as in the field of
 hydroelectric power.

 By being patient and flexible toward Moscow, Chinese leaders probably also
 believe they stand to gain at least some leverage with the United States on issues like
 Taiwan and technology transfer--certainly more than they would if they allowed
 Sino-Soviet relations to remain static or to deteriorate. They probably recognized,
 however, that if they pursue this tack too far they run the risk of not only encouraging
 Moscow to stand pat on security issues, but of weakening the strategic underpinnings of
 Beijing probably believes that it can continue to control the pace and scope of
 improvements in ties with Moscow to avoid alarming the West, whose reaction the
 Chinese carefully monitor. Indeed, Chinese almost certainly will continue to invoke the
 three obstacles partly to reassure Washington and to frustrate attempts by Moscow to
 exploit improved relations to its own advantage within the triangle. We also expect
 Beijing to continue its support for the Afghan and Cambodia insurgents.
 Although the three obstacles no longer appear to be the impediment they once
 were to "normalizing" Sino-Soviet relations, we believe Sino-Soviet strategic differences
 will continue to set limits on how far Beijing is prepared to go in improving ties with
 Moscow--especially as long as China also wants access to Western technology for its
 modernization drive. But Beijing's new approach to triangular politics runs large,
 potential risks. If Gorbachev decides to respond in some new, more imaginative way,
 than has been past Soviet practice, this could reopen last spring's debate among
 Chinese leaders over relations with Moscow and push Deng to move further toward
 The Soviets. have reason to be pleased with the recent progress in Sino-Soviet
 relations, especially because it has cost Moscow little. But they also recognize that they
 have not been able to deter China from developing closer ties with the United States,
 especially in the military sphere, and that they could actually lose some ground in the
 strategic triangle. Moreover, we believe Moscow must worry that Washington will try to
 solidify its relations with Beijing rather than be more forthcoming with Moscow in
 response to any improvement in Sino-Soviet relations.
 Apprehensive about Sino-US ties, the Soviets have sought recently to develop
 some kind of "China card" of their own.  To that end they have expanded the dialogue
 with the Chinese by adding more topics to the agenda of their periodic consultations.
 The Soviet have, for example:

 ? Sent a delegation of foreign ministry officials to Beijing for a week of
 consultations on disarmament issues in August.
 ? Persuaded the Chinese to discuss disarmament issues, space weapons and
 security in the Asia/Pacific region, as well as Afghanistan, Cambodia and various
 "bilateral" issues, at their seventh round of consultations at the deputy foreign
 minister level, held in Beijing this October.
 The Soviets also have pushed for more exhanges like Georgy Arbatov's recent
 visit, which reportedly prompted a Chinese proposal for a Sino-Soviet seminar on
 International issues in 1986, as well as an agreement to exhange more scholars
 Interested In International relations and the foreign policies of the two countries:
 ? Mikhail Titarenko, the new Director of the USSR's Institute of the Far East, visited
 China in late October-early November for talks with Chinese academics on party
 matters and domestic reforms.
 ? Chinese First Deputy Premier Song Ping stopped off in Moscow in late November,
 enroute home from visits to Bulgaria and Poland, for talks and dinner with Soviet
 First Deputy Premier Talyzin, Chairman of the USSR's State Planning Committee.
 The Soviets are striving not to reawaken Chinese fears of superpower collusion.
 Instead, Arbatov reportedly was rather candid with the Chinese about the unlikelihood of
 a breakthrough in US-Soviet ties anytime soon. The Soviets could adopt a different tack
 in the aftermath of the Geneva summit, but we believe they probably will continue to
 put more emphasis on the importance of "socialist unity," and especially China's
 obligation to stop blaming the superpowers equally for world tensions and to join forces
 with the USSR and its allies against the "imperialist" camp.
 To further their efforts to develop a China card, the Soviets also have
 soft-pedalled their reservations about Chinese economic reforms and acknowledged
 China as "socialist." In doing so, they probably hope to encourage the United States
 and its allies to question the wisdom of helping China to modernize its economy and
 armed forces. We also believe they do not want to appear to be interferring in China's
 internal politics, lest they undermine those in the Chinese leadership who are both
 critical of the reforms and in favor of closer Sino-Soviet relations.

 The Soviets continue to refuse to make concessions on the three obtacles and
 privately insist that these are artificial barriers Beijing uses to slow the improvement in
 relations with Moscow and thus to protect its ties with Washington. They predict the
 Chinese will eventually abandon such devices and hence imply that Moscow need not
 give any ground. Meanwhile, the Soviets continue to criticize
 China's support for the resistance movements in Afghanistan and Cambodia
 and Its opposition to the USSR on other Asian issues.
 At the same time, the, Soviets are encouraging the new Mongolian leadership
 under Jambyn Batmonh to improve relations with China. Batmonh noted during his visit
 to Moscow in August that the Mongolians were "paying close attention to the process
 of normalizing Sino-Soviet relations." Since then, Sino-Mongolian contacts have
 developed along lines similiar to Sino-Soviet relations over the past few years. In
 encouraging Mongolia to follow its lead, we suspect Moscow may hope somehow to
 persuade Beijing over time to agree to some sort of an acccomodation on the
 Mongolian question--possibly involving a compromise regarding Soviet forces now
 stationed in Mongolia.
 For the Soviets' part, it remains to be seen whether Gorbachev will give China a
 higher priority and devise a more flexible strategy for dealing with the security issues
 that divide them. A number of Soviet officials have interpreted the replacement of
 Gromyko, whose focus was the United States and Europe, with Shevardnadze as a sign
 that Gorbachev intends to play a more active role in Asia.
 We believe, however, that several factors will continue to inhibit Soviet flexibility.
 The Soviets expect China to remain an adversary for many years even if they manage
 somehow to deal with one or more of the -obstacles." The two countries have
 competing ambitions in Asia and other parts of the world--a situation the Soviets
 believe is unlikely to change for the better any time soon. Some Soviets, moreover,
 believe that recent Chinese gestures f-rtnfirm the correctness of Moscow's current policy
 of toughness. Then too, Gorbachev probably must proceed cautiously because of the
 suspicions of China among the Soviet olorN and possible opposition among key interest
 groups, such as the party bureaucracy. rnitslary establishment and security services, to
 offering security concessions to Beijing
 The Soviets also                                         I expect that China,
 although hardly a threat at the moment, Will grow stronger and pose a more substantial

 security threat in another decade or two. The Soviet's practice has been to keep the
 Chinese hemmed in until Beijing demonstrates a genuine interest in improving
 relations--not just a desire to buy time to modernize its armed forces. Soviet policy
 toward North Korea, India, and Vietnam suggest this remains the basic thrust of their     25X1
 policy.
 There Is no direct evidence that the Soviets are considering major concessions
 Indeed, most Soviet officials seem to believe in "hanging tough" with the Chinese and
 not offering them any concessions. But they could recognize Beijing's claims to almost
 .all of the 700 disputed Islands in the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, most of which have little
 importance in either economic or military terms, while offering China compensation for
 the strategically important Heixlazi Island, opposite Khabarovsk. The Soviets also could
 make some token force reductions opposite China, by ,withdrawing one or more of their
 ready ground force divisions from the area or thinning out various Soviet units there.
 Then, too, the Soviets could withdraw one or more of the five divisions they now have
 in Mongolia without seriously eroding their overall security situation or calling into
 None of these options appears very likely at the moment, but Gorbachev and his
 colleagues may at some point decide that a decision to accommodate Beijing on some
 of its security concerns is worth the risk, because:
 ? Sino-Soviet relations still lag far behind China's ties with the West, and Moscow
 could lose additional ground by standing still while Washington and Beijing are
 moving closer.
 ? An improvement in Sino-Soviet ties would weaken the US position, demonstrate
 that the drift in Soviet policy is over, and show that Gorbachev is in charge.
 ? Moscow also might see a unique opportunity to influence Chinese domestic
 politics, by bolstering any elements favoring a more rapid improvement in
 Siniet relations, or a more restrained dialogue with the United State
 We cannot rule out the possibility that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kapitsa
 discussed such moves with the Chinese during his week long visit to Beijing in early
 December, at which time the two sides agreed on an exhange of foreign minister visits
 in 1986, beginning with a visit to Moscow by Chinese Foreign Minister Wu late next
 s ring.
