 The future actions of protagonists in the Indochina
 arena will depend upon the outcome of the current dry-
 season campaign in Kampuchea.   The Vietnamese will be able
 to reduce Kampuchean resistance to a tolerable level for
 the time being at least, but, because of deeply felt anti-
 Vietnamese animosities harbored by all Kampucheans, the in-
 effectiveness of the Heng Samrin regime, and the continued
 Chinese willingness to resupply the insurgents, resistance
 in some form will continue and will probably require Viet-
 nam to maintain a large occupying army for the foreseeable
 future.  Vietnam may invade Thailand to attack resistance
 bases there and possibly "teach a lesson" to the Thai mili-
 tary.   Hanoi is determined to achieve hegemony over the whole
 of Indochina regardless of economic cost and international
 The Chinese will probably not try to salvage the exist-
 ing fragmented Kampuchean resistance by mounting a second
 invasion of Vietnam.   They are likely to administer a "sec-
 ond lesson" to Vietnam only in the event Hanoi attacks
 Thailand in force and threatens the Bangkok regime.   China
 has other ways of bringing pressure to bear on Vietnam,
 ranging from intensifying its present resupply and orga-
 nizational efforts with the Kampuchean insurgents, through
 increasing its diplomatic and economic activities, to sup-
 i
 port
 ng or creating resistance in Laos.
 The Soviets will take military action against China
 only if Beijing mounts a sustained second invasion of
 Vietnam that endangers Hanoi.   Otherwise, the Soviets
 will continue to supply Vietnam with large quantities of
 military and economic aid in order to help Hanoi deter or
 repel a second Chinese invasion.  Most Soviet leaders wish
 to avoid armed conflict with China for fear it would hamper
 Soviet efforts elsewhere in the world and lead to a wider
 conflict.   Others, however, feel that Soviet prestige would
 suffer if the USSR failed to respond militarily to another
 Chinese invasion of Vietnam.   If the Soviets decided mili-
 tary action was appropriate, they could engage Beijing in

 The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at
 present is united in its opposition to Vietnamese control
 over Kampuchea.   Its unity may be put to the test, however,
 because of Thailand's tilt toward China, which conflicts
 with ASEAN nonalignment and the perception of some members
 that        is a long-term threat to regional security.

 Vietnam's dry-season campaign is entering a new phase.
 An estimated 200,000 Vietnamese troops are preparing to
 launch large-scale clearing operations to eliminate all
 Kampuchean resistance, especially in the western provinces
 The fighting is likely to spill over into Thailand.   In-
 deed, Hanoi believes that resistance guerrillas operate from
 sanctuaries in Thailand.   If it does not eliminate all Kam-
 puchean resistance during the current dry season and faces a
 protracted and costly guerrilla war, Hanoi might decide it
 must destroy guerrillas in Thailand.  Vietnam has ample air
 and ground forces in Kampuchea that could be deployed for
 this purpose.  Accidental clashes, leading to a greater
 degree of tension, could also occur along the ill-defined
 Thai-Kampuchean border.
 For their part, the forces of Pol Pot's Democratic
 Kampuchea will avoid major military confrontations by
 operating in small groups and sending larger units into
 relatively safe areas in the mountains and rain forest.
 They must also resolve problems of feeding themselves,
 distributing Chinese-provided supplies to small, isolated
 units, maintaining a communications network, and opening
 new infiltration and resupply routes to and from Thailand.
 Non-Communist anti-Vietnamese resistance groups report-
 edly conduct reconnaissance and organizational operations
 in western Kampuchea and have bases in refugee camps astride
 the Thai border.   Clashes have taken place in the past be-
 tween these guerrillas and Pol Pot's forces in some areas,
 although in others they now appear to have an understanding
 that defines areas of operational responsibility.   The non-
 Communist resistance groups have neither a political front
 nor a unified military command.  Nevertheless, they see
 themselves as potential flagbearers of Kampuchean resist-
 ance if Pol Pot's forces should be eliminated, and thus they
 represent a valuable long-term resource for the Chinese
 and the Thais.

 The Vietnamese, with their superiority in numbers,
 firepower, and mobility, will be able to deal heavy blows
 to Kampuchean resistance during the current campaign and,
 for the time being at least, will probably reduce it to
 tolerable levels.   In this instance, Hanoi will be able
 to declare a victory; international recognition of Pol Pot
 will decline rapidly,  and,  led by countries like India, many
 states will accept the inevitable and recognize Heng Samrin.
 Over the long haul, however, historic and deeply in-
 grained anti-Vietnamese animosities, coupled with the
 Chinese willingness to support all anti-Vietnamese guer-
 rillas, should ensure that resistance in some form will
 continue indefinitely.   The repressive policies of the
 Vietnamese, especially their unwillingness or inability
 to feed people in many areas, and their reported contempt
 for the Heng Samrin leadership will probably preclude the
 early establishment of an effective puppet regime able to
 administer the country and assume responsibility for in-
 ternal security.
 The major imponderable, along with the degree and
 effectiveness of Chinese pressure, is the extent to which
 Vietnam is willing to accept heavy political, economic,
 and military sacrifices over a considerable period of
 time to achieve hegemony over Indochina.   Past experience
 has shown that the stubborn, unified leadership--supported
 by a population, in the north at least, inured to hardship
 by more than three decades of war--will not easily crumble
 or compromise on long-held goals.   Continued support from
 the Soviet Union will strengthen Hanoi's resolve.   Adverse
 international opinion, so far only a marginal factor, might
 cause Vietnam to modify its tactics, but is unlikely to
 force Hanoi to disavow its goal of a Vietnamese-dominated
 At the end of the current dry-season campaign, Viet-
 nam will probably take several short-term measures to con-
 solidate its position:

 -- Embark on a major propaganda campaign stressing
 the "reality" of Heng Samrin rule, at the same
 time making serious attempts to strengthen it.
 The population, weakened by malnutrition and
 disease, will probably remain docile for the time
 being.
 -- Remove some Vietnamese troops, again in the
 glare of maximum propaganda.
 -- Carry out a reported plan to resettle persons
 from overcrowded areas of Vietnam in Kampuchea.
 If accomplished, this would further improve the
 security situation for the time being--although
 it would also fuel Kampuchean resentment of the
 Vietnamese.
 -- Try to influence world opinion, especially that
 of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
 (ASEAN),* by promising that Hanoi will not in-
 terfere in the internal affairs of other coun-
 tries and claiming it has no territorial designs
 elsewhere in the region.  Hanoi is likely to be
 tough minded in dealing with these states, and
 may make demands on Thailand in particular to
 modify its present pro-China policy.
 Thereafter, Vietnamese actions will depend on the nature
 of Kampuchean resistance and the ability of the guerrillas
 to sustain a protracted struggle.   Hanoi will have four
 options, listed in descending order of probability:
 -- Maintain a large occupying army for the foresee-
 able future, possibly making token reductions
 with maximum propaganda exposure.   This option
 would result in a war of attrition with a cyclical
 pattern of intensity depending on the weather.
 The Kampuchean people would be subjected to con-
 tinuing violence, starvation, and disruption.
 More than ever,  they would tend to seek refuge
 in Thailand.
 * A group of non-Communist states comprising Indonesia,
 Malaysia,  Singapore, Thailand,  and the Philippines.

 -- Withdraw the majority of Vietnamese troops and
 seek to strengthen the Heng Samrin regime using
 remaining forces as a prop, with the expectation
 that some resistance is inevitable.   The danger
 to Hanoi is that the reduced troop level and the
 ineffectiveness of the puppet government would
 allow resistance to burgeon.
 -- Negotiate a compromise settlement and withdraw
 Vietnamese troops after a period of time.   Hanoi
 would find this difficult to accept:   it has
 stated publicly that the position of the Heng
 Samrin regime is "irreversible."   Furthermore,
 because of across-the-board Kampuchean animosity,
 Vietnamese influence with any successor govern-
 ment would not be assured unless Hanoi maintained
 a large military presence.
 -- Withdraw Vietnamese troops completely and leave
 the country in the unreliable hands of the Heng
 Samrin regime.   The danger here is that resist-
 ance groups would be able to increase their
 strength rapidly, threaten Phnom Penh, and
 raise the specter for Hanoi of the installation
 of a new, Chinese-influenced government.   In-
 deed,  under these circumstances,  the Heng Samrin
 government itself might be tempted to make a deal
 with China and/or Thailand.
 Chinese Objectives.   China's basic objectives are
 definable in short- and long-range terms. Over the next
 few months, China wishes to ensure that Kampuchean resist-
 ance will survive the dry season, and to prevent the con-
 flict from spilling over the border into Thailand.   Over
 the long haul, China wants to prevent Vietnam from con-
 solidating its hold on Indochina,  to impel Hanoi away from
 its close relationship with the Soviet Union, to force
 Vietnam to acknowledge China as a major power in Southeast
 Asia with legitimate regional interests,  and coincidentally
 to demonstrate to the United States and the West that the
 Soviet Union and Vietnam can be successfully confronted.

 Chinese Reactions So Far. At present,  China is sup-
 porting anti-Vietnamese resistance forces in Kampuchea,
 including non-Communist groups to a limited extent.   It
 is also planning to support, and, where necessary, create
 an anti-regime resistance in Laos.
 The Chinese are applying psychological and military
 pressure on Vietnam by maintaining tensions along the
 Sino-Vietnam border, thereby compelling Hanoi to remain
 in a state of general mobilization.   This exacts a con-
 siderable sacrifice in terms of men and resources and
 inhibits Vietnam's reconstruction and development.
 At the same time, China is attempting to isolate Viet-
 nam diplomatically by playing on the themes of Vietnamese
 expansionism and repression (that is, the refugee exodus
 and famine in Kampuchea) in international forums.   China
 is also trying to discourage potential foreign investors
 and aid donors from involvement in Hanoi's economy.
 Beijing tries to demonstrate its own reasonableness by
 maintaining the formality of border talks with the Viet-
 Finally, China is trying to foster a split in the
 Vietnamese leadership by applying a variety of pressures
 intended to convince some in Hanoi to question present
 Vietnamese policy.
 Chinese Options in the Future.   If Vietnam succeeds
 in substantially weakening the Kampuchean resistance by
 the end of the present dry season, China will be unlikely
 to remain quiescent.   Beijing's options will be limited,
 however.      It will do its utmost to ensure that the resist-
 ance continues.   It probably will also seek to use the
 thousands of Kampuchean refugees in Thailand as a base
 on which to organize new resistance.   China will also con-
 tinue its attempts to isolate Vietnam politically and
 economically.   It will probably move to strengthen its
 relations with non-Communist Southeast Asian states and
 try to persuade them to act in concert to defend them-
 selves against a long-term Vietnamese threat to regional
 security.
 There are not many circumstances that might cause
 Beijing to go beyond these activities and mount a second

 invasion of Vietnam.   It might do so if it decided Viet-
 namese military successes in Kampuchea were impugning
 China's credibility as an "ally" and regional power.   The
 Chinese may, however, have concluded that the first in-
 vasion was too costly and even so did not force a Viet-
 namese withdrawal from Kampuchea; China probably also
 realizes a second invasion would not save Pol Pot.   It
 may feel that even the collapse of anti-Vietnamese resist-
 ance would not itself represent sufficient grounds for
 a second lesson.
 The Chinese might also feel a "second lesson" was
 called for if Vietnam drove deep into Thailand, threat-
 ened the Bangkok regime, caused heavy Thai casualties,
 and occupied Thai territory.   Recent public statements
 by senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Deng
 Xiaoping, tend to link China's credibility to Thailand's
 territorial integrity.   China has been careful, however,
 not to commit itself to any specific course of action,
 in order both to avoid precipitous involvement from which
 it would have trouble extricating itself and to keep the
 Vietnamese off balance.
 Should China decide a second lesson was required,
 it need not necessarily repeat its large-scale offen-
 sive along the length of the border.
 Beijing's options in case of a second lesson
 -- Mounting a heavy ground strike against one or
 more major targets inside Vietnam, such as the
 border city of Mong Cai, which suffered rela-
 tively little damage during the February inva-
 sion, or against specific economic targets
 along Vietnam's northeast coast.   After de-
 stroying its objective,  China could once again
 withdraw.
 -- Striking through Laos,  a course that would have
 the advantage of demonstrating Hanoi's weakness
 as a protector but would accomplish little mili-
 tarily because of the nonstrategic nature of
 available targets.    This would be particularly
 true if China limited its strike to the northern

 provinces, over which Vientiane, and by exten-
 sion Hanoi, has little control.   Furthermore,
 the difficult nature of the terrain and the
 logistic difficulties involved make it unlikely
 that China would find this an attractive target.
 A strike into Laos might also incur adverse
 world and regional reaction; many countries
 would feel China was committing aggression
 against a small and neutral third party.
 -- Launching a major airstrike against selected
 Vietnamese targets.   This would have the ad-
 vantage of being highly visible, over quickly,
 and less costly than ground operations.   It
 would have little impact, however, on Viet-
 namese actions in Kampuchea or Thailand;                                   should
 many aircraft be lost to Vietnam's effective
 air defense system, it could be portrayed as
 a Chinese defeat.
 -- Sending volunteers to fight in Kampuchea or
 Thailand.   This seems unlikely; China prob-
 ably feels it is too late to deploy troops
 to Kampuchea; and even if China were willing
 to send troops to Thailand, Bangkok would
 probably reject the offer.
 -- Attacking Vietnamese forces in the Spratly
 Islands.   This would be difficult because
 of equipment and support limitations; it would
 also probably have little deterrent effect on
 the Vietnamese and might involve political
 repercussions because the Philippine Govern-
 ment also claims several of the Spratly
 Islands.
 China and a Second Invasion.   A number of deterrents
 inhibit China from administering a large-scale "second
 lesson":
 -- The formidable buildup of Vietnamese forces,
 increasingly equipped with modern Soviet weap-
 ons, along the Sino-Vietnamese border, making
 a second invasion even more costly than the
 first.

 of Deng Xiaoping as a tactic, rather than an
 issue of substance, to attack him.   The poor
 state of military equipment, reservations over
 the effects of the first invasion on China's
 diplomatic standing,  and,  above all,  the costs
 to other sectors of China's economy were is-
 sues in the debate over tactics used against
 Vietnam and would become so again in the
 absence of a major Vietnamese attack on China.
 -- Possible Soviet retaliation.   Although the Soviets
 did not respond militarily after the first inva-
 sion, Chinese leaders may believe that Moscow would
 be forced to do so next time because of intense
 pressure from Vietnam.   Fear of Soviet reprisals
 alone, however, probably would not deter China.
 -- Adverse world opinion.   Another invasion by
 China might create sympathy for Vietnam as the
 underdog and also reinforce fears of the ASEAN
 states--especially Indonesia and Malaysia--of
 Chinese expansionism.
 Indications and Warning.  We are likely to detect
 Chinese preparations for a major assault--either an at-
 tack with limited objectives or a full-scale invasion--
 against Vietnam or Laos.                         Chinese forces near the border
 with Vietnam number between 150,000 and 200,000 men,  and,
 in view of the major Vietnamese buildup of forces north of
 Hanoi since March, this number would not be adequate to
 launch a successful major campaign.   Any large Chinese
 reinforcement effort,  however, would take less time than
 that for the February invasion because of experience
 gained and because some logistic equipment was left near
 We would be less likely to receive advance warning
 if the Chinese chose to make a small thrust against a
 single specific target because troops already in the
 border area are probably enough to mount a localized as-
 sault with a minimum of preparation.

 We would be unlikely to detect preparations for
 small-scale operations in Laos.   The Chinese maintain
 limited defense troops along the border and a main force
 division within 100 kilometers; these forces would be
 enough to conduct shallow, small-scale harassment attacks
 inside Laos.
 The Chinese can easily and without warning, increase
 the number of incidents along the Sino-Vietnamese border,
 such as shallow ground penetrations or overflight of Viet-
 namese territory by combat aircraft.   China's naval presence
 in the South China Sea could also be strengthened quickly.
 The Soviets will not take military action against
 China if China does not reinvade Vietnam.   This section
 discusses the options available to the Soviets in this
 event and the factors that will influence their decision.
 We emphasize, however, that the probability that Moscow
 will need to exercise any of these options is as low as
 the prospects for a second Chinese invasion of Vietnam.
 Should the Chinese not invade, the Soviets will carry
 on as they are doing at present--that is, sending mili-
 tary equipment and a limited number of advisers to Viet-
 nam, using Soviet aircraft to ferry troops and supplies
 to Kampuchea, and supplying large amounts of economic aid,
 including food, to ease the burden on Vietnam.
 Current Soviet Assessmet.   Publicly,  the Soviets sup-
 port Vietnam's contention that the victory of the Heng
 Samrin regime in Kam uchea is "irreversible," but 0
 some Soviet leaders privately doubt
 that Vietnam will succeed in eliminating all Kampuchean
 resistance during the current dry season and have predicted
 that Vietnam may eventually be forced to negotiate a com-
 promise.

 Moscow provides large amounts of military and eco-
 nomic aid to Hanoi, hoping that a strong Vietnam will
 deter or repel a second Chinese invasion and thus fore-
 stall the need for a direct Sino-Soviet confrontation.
 Since the February invasion, Moscow has reportedly de-
 livered at least $500 million in military aid to Vietnam--
 an amount that represents a tenfold increase over 1978
 and is some 25 percent higher than all Soviet military
 aid over the five preceding years.   So far in 1979 the
 Soviets have sent Vietnam more aircraft than in any single
 year since 1954, plus some 200 tanks and 24 naval vessels.
 Soviet Options If Chinese Reinvade Vietnam.   The
 Soviets could of course choose not to take military action
 against the Chinese and instead intensify their present
 efforts.   Should Moscow decide to intervene militarily,
 however, it could act against the Chinese either in Indo-
 china or along the Sino-Soviet border.
 If the Soviets chose to intervene in Indochina,
 they could:
 -- Deploy additional naval units to patrol the
 coast off Vietnam.
 -- Increase their military involvement, currently
 limited to advisory roles and some combat sup-
 port functions.   They might step up their
 activity either in Vietnam itself to support
 Vietnamese troops in the Sino-Vietnamese border
 area, or in Kampuchea to free Vietnamese troops
 for combat against the Chinese.   They could,
 for instance, supply antiaircraft and ground
 attack helicopter and fighter-bomber units.
 -- Send to Vietnam a light division-size task
 force, consisting of two airborne regiments
 plus antitank and antiaircraft units.   This
 force could be sent rapidly, within a week,
 and might be suitable for bolstering Viet-
 namese positions against Chinese attacks.
 -- Deploy to Vietnam a force equal to a Soviet
 combined-arms army--a force of three to five
 divisions plus supporting units totaling
 around 50,000 to 60,000 men.   This would take

 one or two months and would require a large,
 unprecedented air and sea lift along a long
 and vulnerable supply line.   If there was suf-
 ficient time, however, the force could de-
 cisively influence the military situation.
 Moscow could exercise a number of options along the
 Sino-Soviet border in case of a second Chinese invasion
 of Vietnam.   Initially the Soviets could:
 -- Launch a psychological campaign threatening
 the use of force against China, including
 propaganda and diplomatic warnings going be-
 yond Soviet statements last February.  At
 that time, the Soviets merely warned China to
 stop before it was too late and leaked to the
 press a story that all Soviet troops had been
 placed on alert.
 -- Mount conspicuous military exercises along the
 Sino-Soviet border.   These would probably not
 affect the situation in Vietnam but would
 represent a powerful reminder of Soviet mili-
 tary supremacy in the border area and also
 would increase Soviet combat readiness.
 If these measures were not successful, the Soviets
 could:
 -- Mount small-scale offensive operations--for
 instance, reoccupy disputed riverine islands
 or harass Chinese border guards--using some of
 the approximately 60,000 well-armed KGB border
 forces.
 -- Launch punitive air attacks against military
 and industrial targets throughout northern China.
 The Soviets have air supremacy along the border;
 there would be little immediate risk of major
 Chinese retaliation in kind although a token
 retaliatory strike is possible.
 -- Launch regimental-size raids with relative
 impunity against Chinese light infantry and
 cavalry units in the border area.   None of the
 23 or 24 active Soviet divisions within 200

 kilometers of the border is manned at full war-
 time strength, but most could field at least
 one regimental-size unit within 24 hours and
 could be brought up to strength within 48 hours
 by mobilizing local reservists.
 -- Launch a full-scale coordinated conventional
 assault into northern Manchuria to destroy
 selected military and industrial targets and
 to seize Chinese territory.  Moscow could then
 try to exchange such territory for Vietnamese
 land occupied by the Chinese.
 How the Soviets Would Choose.   Soviet decisionmaking
 is based on a complex worldwide and long-term calculus of
 interests.   Policy toward Indochina does not proceed in a
 regional vacuum:   the possibility that Soviet military
 action against China might bring about a long-range anti-
 Soviet alliance between the United States and China,  as
 well as the implications of events like the invasion of
 Afghanistan, need to be balanced against specific objec-
 tives in Indochina.
 There are few clues about what options the Soviets
 would choose in the event of a second Chinese invasion
 of Vietnam.  Moscow's response would depend on the se-
 verity of the Chinese action and the threat it posed to
 the Vietnamese regime.   If the Chinese military action
 was more sustained than the first invasion, but did not
 pose a direct threat to Hanoi, Moscow might adopt a more
 threatening propaganda tone but would probably limit its
 actions to intensifying the type of support it is already
 providing.
 Soviet decisionmaking would become immeasurably more
 difficult if a Chinese invasion appeared open-ended.   Most
 Soviet leaders probably oppose multidivision operations
 into China because of the danger of involvement in a pro-
 longed ground war and escalation into a more widespread
 conflict.   These leaders, aware of the uncertainties in-
 volved in a military move against the Chinese, especially
 the United States' reaction thereto, would be anxious not
 to impair important Soviet interests elsewhere in the
 world and would also wish to keep open the possibility
 of improving Sino-Soviet relations.   They would probably
 point out that Moscow's treaty commitments do not require
 the USSR to come to the defense of the Vietnamese and in

 fact were phrased precisely to prevent Vietnam from em-
 broiling the USSR in a wider war.   They would question
 whether any of the military options along the Sino-Soviet
 border would necessarily compel a Chinese withdrawal from
 Vietnam.
 Some elements in the leadership, however, might wish
 to teach China a lesson.   They would argue for military
 action along the Sino-Soviet border or for some degree
 of Soviet military involvement in Indochina itself.   In
 their view,  Moscow would pay a heavy political price if
 it failed to come to the aid of its Vietnamese ally.
 Furthermore,  they would reason that the Soviets have
 military supremacy and could deal with any possible
 mediately detect the deployment of small numbers of Soviet
 combat support units, pilots,  or additional advisers to
 either Vietnam or Kampuchea.
 If the Soviets chose to move along the Sino-Soviet
 border, they could launch small-scale ground attacks up
 to regimental size or a large-scale air assault within
 hours, and neither the United States nor China would be
 able to detect preparations.   A large-scale conventional
 invasion of China would require several weeks' prepara-
 tion and the mobilization of all forces along the border;
 we would be able to detect such preparations soon after
 they were under way.
 Current Policy.   The collective foreign policy of
 the
 Association of Southeast
 Asia Nations since 1971
 has
 been based on the concept
 of "Zone of Peace, Freedom,
 and
 Neutrality," which seeks
 to accommodate the interests
 of
 the United States, China,
 and the Soviet Union in the
 region and thereby obtain their assurances that they
 will not intervene militarily.   To this end ASEAN mem-
 bers are publicly committed to nonalignment.   This
 policy, and indeed the unity of ASEAN itself, may be
 put to the test because of events in Indochina.

 Before the emergence of a powerful Vietnam, most
 ASEAN states saw China as the major external threat.
 All are now concerned that Vietnam in future may try to
 export revolution.   Several states, however, still fear
 China's long-term intentions and may in time come to be-
 lieve that a strong Indochina under Vietnamese control
 would represent a useful counterweight to China.   In the
 meantime, because they see Thailand as their frontline
 state on Indochina, they give prime weight to Bangkok's
 policy recommendations.   Some ASEAN members, however--
 particularly Malaysia and Indonesia--fear that Thailand's
 obvious tilt toward China could upset ASEAN neutralism,
 increase Vietnam's animosity toward ASEAN,  and encourage
 Vietnam as well as the two Communist superpowers to in-
 terfere in ASEAN's internal politics.
 Thailand.   Bangkok's policy at present is conver-
 gent with that of China--that is, to try to bring about
 a neutral Kampuchea (and Laos) free of Vietnamese con-
 trol.   It is increasingly concerned, however, at the

 land and if this occurs would probably seek aid from the
 Thailand is unlikely to encourage a negotiated set-
 tlement in Kampuchea until military options based on re-
 sistance guerrillas are exhausted.   It might, however,
 welcome a Vietnamese initiative for a compromise solu-
 tion at the end of the dry-season campaign, believing that
 this would constitute a defeat for Vietnam and signal
 Hanoi's realization of its inability to eliminate Kam-
 puchean resistance.
 On the other hand, Thailand might change its pro-
 resistance policy to one of recognition of the Heng
 Samrin regime if:
 -- A major Vietnamese cross-border attack on Thai
 forces took place without a strong reaction--
 that is, more than a verbal protest--from either
 the United States or China; or
 -- Vietnam eliminated all organized resistance
 during the dry-season campaign.

 Other ASEAN States.     Malaysia and Indonesia fear
 China as a long-term threat because of domestic con-
 siderations:  Malaysia has a large (35 percent) ethnic
 Chinese minority and a Communist insurgency controlled
 by ethnic Chinese, and Indonesia believes that China
 aided the Indonesian Communist Party's attempt to gain
 control of the government in 1965.   Both countries adopt
 a cautious and nonconfrontational approach to Vietnam.
 If Vietnamese troops effectively eliminated Kampuchean
 resistance over the next few months, Malaysia and In-
 donesia might press for a modification of the present
 hardline policy in order to accommodate the new
 reality.
 Singapore, an island nation dependent upon free
 sea lanes for its survival, sees the Soviet Union as the
 major external threat, and is unhappy at Vietnam's re-
 liance on Moscow.   It believes that attempts at com-
 promise with Vietnam will fail, and takes the strongest
 anti-Vietnamese posture in ASEAN.   Singapore urges the
 establishment of an ASEAN security grouping or at least
 increased cooperation on security matters within the
 ASEAN framework.   This is opposed by other ASEAN states,
 especially Malaysia and Indonesia, for fear it might
 Manila seems content to defer to the rest of ASEAN

 dispute with Vietnam over ownership of part of the
 Spratly Islands.  Manila is unlikely to mount any initia-
