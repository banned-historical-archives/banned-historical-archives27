1. US concerned over lessened German cooperation-,-The 
Department of State has expressed to US High Commis-
ioner McCloy its concern over indications from several 
sources that the Germans have recently taken a less co-
operative attitude in negotiations on the Schuman Plan, 
probably because they feel their position has been strength-
ened by the apparent eagerness of the Western Powers to 
' sue for German military support. The Department suggests, 
in view of the great importance of the German attitude during 
this period while the Western allies are attempting to reach 
agreement of German participation in a common defense, as 
well as the long-range importance of the outcome of the 
Schuman Plan, that McCloy may wish to point out to West 
German Chancellor Adenauer that this feeling of decreased 
German cooperation exists generally among the Western 
nations. The Department considers that current discussions 
of drawing Germany into a common defense arrangement, far 
from lessening the need. for European economic cooperation, 
make it more imperative that the negotiatiiins on the Schuman 
Plan, to whose success the US attaches great importance, be 
concluded rapidly and satisfactorily.

cording to Kirk's information, reports concerning the exist-

crystallized since mid-September and is based on the conviction 
that the entering of US forces into North Korea would indicate 
a basic US aim to carry the war to Manchuria and China in 
order to return Chiang Kai-shek to power in China. In com-
menting on this information, Kirk says he finds it difficult 
to accept these reports as authoritative analyses of Chinese 
Communist plans. He takes the line that the logical moment 
for Communist armed intervention came when the UN forces 
were desperately defending a small area in southern Korea and 
when the influx of an overivhelmtng number of Chinese ground 
forces would have proved a decisive factor. He warns that 
prudence is indicated in this situation but expresses his view 
that the Chinese Communists, through press propaganda and 
through personal contacts with foreign diplomatic personnel, 
have taken a strong line since the Inchon landing in the hope 
of bluffing the UN on the 38th Parallel issue. 
3. INDONESIA: Army faces tense situation with Ambonese--
An Indonesian army officer has disclosed to US Consul Mill 
In Surabaya that the Indonesian army is on stand-by orders 
in that area as a consequence of increasing tension with 
Ambonese armed units which were members of the Dutch 
colonial forces prior to the granting of Indonesian independence. 
According to Mill's informant, the Ambonese are well armed 
and very bitter against the Indonesian army. He regards the 
situation as potentially very serious.

� victories in Korea have decisively dispelled the spirit of 
defeatism and pessimism which had prevailed in Sweden

ITALY: Fusion of Socialist parties predicted--US Ambas-

the Italian Interior Ministry that the two non-Communist 
Socialist parties may combine soon and that such a fusion 
would attract considerable numbers from the pro-Communist 
Socialist Party as well as deal a "terrific blow" to the Italian 
Communist Party;. The Italian official added that, once the 
Socialist fusion gets under way, it is "not impossible" that 
some Communist leaders would break with their Party. 
(CIA Comment: Considerable evidence indicates that 
the predicted Socialist fusion may take place in the near future, 
but the present solidarity of Communist leadership in Italy is 
not likely to be affected.)

out, however, that there are influential elements in India 
which might be willing to agree to the occupation of all Korea 
by UN forces provided the whole country is placed under UN 
control until a nation-wide plebiscite can be held. The Am-
bassador considers it "barely possible" that Nehru might 
be persuaded to go along with a solution of this kind.

3. GERMANY: Soviet harassment in Berlin-- General Taylor, 
US Deputy High Commissioner in Berlin, reports that the 
recent intensification of Soviet harassment in Berlin has 
increased tension in the city, but adds that Western occupa-
tion authorities are not particularly alarmed. Taylor feels 
that the recent Soviet "incidents" are intended to influence 
East Germans on the eve of the Soviet Zone elections and 
to decrease participation in the 1 October West Berlin in-
dustrial fair. 
(CIA Comment: The primary purpose of these re-
newed Soviet tactics is probably the usual one of undermining 
the confidence and morale of the West Berlin and West German 
population. The Communists may also estimate that a display 
of strength before the 15 October elections will discourage the 
East Germans from passive resistance during the elec-
tions.) 
4. PORTUGAL: Attitude toward Western defense--US Ambassador 
MacVeagh in Lisbon has been informed by Portuguese Foreign 
Minister Cunha, during a discussion of the Portuguese position 
regarding Western defense, that his government favors the 
maximum possible use of the German defense potential. Cunha 
added that Portugal also favors the establishment of an inte-
grated defense force under a unified command, but cannot agree 
to contribute to such a force so long as Spain remains outside 
the defense system. Cunha also stated that his government holds 
that decisions of the proposed unified command should not apply, 
without their consent, "to countries lying outside the integrated 
area.,.,

(CIA Comment: Spain's exclusion from the NATO is 
not the major reason for Portugal's unwillingness to contribute 
to an integrated defense force. Premier Salazar is primarily 
concerned with finding a way to remain in the NATO without 
reducing the authority of his totalitarian regime and the poli-
tical predominance of the Portuguese military caste. Salazar's 
desire to have Spain brought into European defense plans is 
nonetheless a consideration because of his obligations under� 
the Spanish-Portuguese Treaty of Friendship and Non-aggression.)

1. Soviet attitude toward UN occupation of North Korea--The 
US Delegation to the, UN transmits the opinion of the UK 
Ambassador in Moscow that the Kremlin, in considering the 
turn of the military tide in Korea, might regard the occupa-
tion of North Korea by UN forces as a cause for war. The 
UK Ambassador points out that, although there have been no 
official indications of the Kremlin's reaction to the altered 
Korean situation, the Soviet leaders are undoubtedly seeking 
means either to forestall UN occupation of North Korea or, 
failing this, to neutralize the dangers to the USSR that such 
an action would raise. In considering the possible actions 
open to the Kremlin, the UK Ambassador feels that the USSR 
will hesitate to put forward detailed proposals on either count 
but will take full advantage of any.well-intended but naive 
proposals which might be put forward in the UN. If such an 
opportunity is not presented, the UK Ambassador believes the 
main Soviet effort will be made in the propaganda field. 
The UK Ambassador suggests that, in addition, the 
Kremlin may attempt to distract attention from the Soviet, 
failure in Korea by staging a diversion elsewhere, with Indo-
china and Berlin being obvious possibilities. In analyzing 
the possibility that the USSR might risk a global war in order 
to restore its prestige and eliminate a threat to its security, 
the UK Ambassador concludes that the USSR is unlikely to 
assume this risk primarily because "Stalin has never yet 
been prepared to risk all in order to gain all." The UK 
Ambassador comments that, if UN forces.occupy North 
Korea, the resulting reorganization of the country and the 
attendant publicity will have far-reaching consequences 
throughout Asia.

undoubtedly searching for methods either to forestall a UN 
crcpX ation.of North Korea or to neutralize its effect; and

(b) the USSR will probably not take any steps which in the

2. Comments on proposed new UN Commission on Korea--
The US Delegation to the UN reports that former General 
Assembly President Romulo, commenting on the UK draft 
resolution for establishing a new commission on Korea, 
stressed the need of assuring the proposed new unification 
commission of full cooperation from the authorities of the 
Republic of Korea. Romulo feels that great care should be 
used in selecting members for the new comniis�ion and 
emphasized that India, the Philippines, Australia, New 
Zealand, and Canada should serve. Romulo added that non-
Asian members should be chosen on the basis of capacity 
and willingness to help establish a unified democratic Korea.

3. GERMANY: Role in Western defense causes concern--
According to US High Commissioner McCloy in Frankfurt, 
Chancellor Adenauer, although very pleased with the recent 
actions of the US-UK-French Foreign Ministers, is dis-
tressed about rumors that a decision in principle on the 
employment of "German contingents" in Western defense may 
be postponed indefinitely. Adenauer believes that any formal 
announcement to this effect would have serious repercussions 
in Bonn by strengthening the hand of the government faction 
which continues to oppose German participation in Western 
defense efforts. Adenauer also believes that German public 
opinion requires "a good deal of careful working on" before

it readily accepts the idea of participation, and that efforts to 
mold opinion cannot begin openly until the Western Allies 
.announce their decision. McCloy feels there would be no 
objection in the Federal Republic Government if the Germans 
were requested in the near future to consider a contribution 
to be made at a later date. 
4. BELGIUM: Supreme Western commander favored--US Am-
bassador Murphy in Brussels reports the opinion of a Belgian 
Foreign Office official that, although a constitutional question 
Is involved in the transfer of sovereignty required to create 
a joint Western supreme defense command, there will be no 
difficulty in obtaining the necessary legislation. The Belgian 
official declared that such ground, air, or sea combat units 
as Belgium has now or may have in the future would be 
allocated to the supreme high command. The Belgian official 
remarked that it was difficult for the Belgian Government to 
understand why an interim appointment of a chief of staff should 
be preferred to the immediate appointment of a supreme com-
mander.

the Indian Ministry of External Affairs has expressed to e 4 is

Meanwhile, the British Delegation to the UN has

Deputy High Commissioner Hays reports that for

3. YUGOSLAVIA: Food situation continues to worsen--US C. (A 1 tert 
Embassy Belgrade reports that the over-all estimate of 
crop yields continues to decline as the harvest of corn, 
sugarbeets, and late potatoes progresses. Heavy slaughter-
ing of livestock is taking place in anticipation of coming 
winter feed shortages, but there is no evidence of a Yugo-
slav effort to arrange for imports of bread grains or live-
stock feeds to make up the food deficit.. The present 
government plan is apparently to secure the minimum 
requirements of sugar, beans, and fats, and one Yugoslav 
official has indicated that an immediate 10 percent cut in 
bread rations for all consumer categories is being con-
sidered. The Embassy feels that such a reduction would 
be grossly inadequate to close the food shortage gap.

stated that a Viet Minh attack in the pacified Phat Diem 
region of southern Tonkin is probable "shortly" but that 
the French were not "particularly worried" because 
troops could be sent into the region by sea. Pignon added 
that there was "absolutely no evidence" that Chinese 
Communist troops had participated in the recent Viet

US Embassy London, meanwhile, reports that 
the UK Foreign Office has revised its over-all estimate

Indochina problem, the Legation expresses its belief that 
a "fairly rapid" solution requires greatly increased native 
forces and that the value of the concept of a national army

aid. Stating that the military elements of a solution to the 
Indochinese problem cannot be divorced from the political 
aspects, the Legation concludes that delay in the creation 
of national forces has been due not only to French hesitancy 
to make such a concession but also to the skepticism in 
some French and US military circles regarding the value 
of "native troops."

NATO military command and German participation in the

In session, but the Danish Rigsdag does not convene until

rearmament and the creation of a separate German army 
and will insist upon integration of whatever German forces 
are authorized. Minor constitutional problems may arise

4. AUSTRIA: Austrians reassesslg their position--US Charge 
Dowling in Vienna reports that, as a result of the growing 
realization among the Austrian people that the Western 
Powers may not be able to negotiate an Ahstrian treaty with 
the USSR, there are uneasy stirrings toward an active Aus-
trian role in the East-West struggle. In the Western zones 
of Austria, the new attitude is reflected by rural movements 
for the formation of resistance bands against an eventual 
Soviet invasion. In the Soviet zone of Austria, although the 
attitude of local officials and political leaders is still un-
waveringly firm, the population as a whole is showing less 
resistance to Soviet pressures and a tendency to come to 
terms with the occupation authorities. The Charge comments 
that the Austrians, rather than turning toward the West for 
further help, are attempting to find within themselves the 
resources with which to meet any coming crisis. Dowling 
has no great anxiety regarding Austria's allegiance to the 
West, but asserts that the West risks losing the practical 
values of that allegiance unless more dramatic evidence of 
Western support of Austria is forthcoming.

spread to almost all parts of that island and to Panay and 
Mindanao as well. The Embassy considers that Huk expansion 
placed particular emphasis on northern Luzon areas adjacent 
to the Formosan straits, probably in the expectation of receiv-

ing the capture of Taiwan. The Embassy believes that although 
little or no aid from mainland Asia has reached the auks, 
there are prospects for increased Huk activity now that the

culated by the USSR to strengthen those Iranian elements 
favoring a pro-Soviet orientation and to counter the expected

duce the effectiveness of Soviet efforts to draw Iran away from 
the West; and (c) strengthen the Iranian Government's- bargaining

� EUROPE 
1. BELGIUM': Prospects for present government�US Ambas-
sador Murphy in Brussels transmits the opinion of former 
Belgian Premier Eyskens that the prbsent Belgian Govern-
ment has a good chance of remaining in power until after the 
Christmas'-holidays, although a revision broadening the base 
of the government is inevitable. Eyskens also believes that 
the military program of the present government has a reason-
able chance of success in the October meeting of the Belgian 
Parliament. 
(CIA Comment: CIA concurs in Eyskens' estimate 
regarding prospects for the Belgian Government, but believes 
that the military program may meet with sufficient parlia-
mentary opposition to delay its passage beyond October. The 
government's proposal to extend the period of compulsory 
military training will be the particular target of the opposition.) 
Eyskens' views on German rearmament--Ex-Premier 
Eyskens considers considers Western Germany the ''key to European 
defense," and says that Belgians will have no confidence in 
European security runtil West Germany is equipped with from 
15 to 20 panzer divisions. The former Premier believes that 
the question of German rearmament now overshadows every 
other European issue and that there can be no solution unless 
the US talses tpe lead in supporting such a rearmament. Eyskens 
feels that a future German army must be a component part of 
a European military establishment and believes that Germans 
at the present stage would ,be *Ming to accept French high 
command, but that this question might possibly be solved later 
by some systeth of rotation. 
(CIA1Comment: CIA believes that although Eyskens' 
statements on the rearming of West Germany represent the 
sentiment of the Belgian people, Belgium would be, most re-
, luctantto permit German rearmament to take precedence 
.`ovir'that of the North Atlantic Treaty nations.)

o Schuman's views on German rearmament�According to US 3 TS 
Embassy London, French Foreign Minister Schuman has ex-
presged the view that German rearmament is at present 
inadvisable, (Schuman used rearmament in a broad sense 
to include both establiphment of a German national army and 
the manufacture of ordnance items in Germany.) Although 
Schuman did not appear "absolutely set" on the nature of 
the proposed West German police force, he felt that the 
French would favor Nacing, such a force under control of the 
individual German states, rather than under the federal govern-
ment. Schuman saw no objection to a West German gendarmerie 
having a common organization, training, and uniform, but he 
stressed the importance of not giving the Germans a "taste 
for arms," and expressed apprehension lest any federal police 
force fall under the eventual command of some "old school" 
German militarist.

1. PALESTINE: Tri ar....p.,ILtp_OL.1 asked on box_yier9=a--The a /19 
Jordanian-Foreign Ministry has handed US Minister Drew in 
Amman a note requesting action under the US-UK-French 
Declaration of 24 May 1950 against a recent Israeli violation 
of Jordanian territory which Jordan claims Israel is attempting 
to justify with a "faked map. (The Tripartite Declaration 
� pledged US-UK-French action to prevent violation of existing 
frontiers and armistice lines). According to the Jordanians, 
the area into which the Israelis have moved is part of the 
original Transjordan mandate and thus not covered by the 
armistice agreement between the two states. Drew states 
that the Jordanian Foreign Minister, who appeared unimpressed 
by his argument that the Tripartite Declaration was not intended 
to apply to minor border incidents, has also invoked the Anglo-
Jordanian Treaty of Alliance. Drew adds that the Jordan Cabinet 
has unanimously voted to expel the Israelis forcibly but comments 
that although the government is known to be "extremely agitated," 
this move should be interpreted as a political maneuver made 
with the knowledge that the UK would prevent use of the Arab 
Legion for that purpose. 
(CIA Comment: This border violation, although minor 
In its0.1 and of a type which has cropped up frequently under the 
Jordan-Israeli armistice agreement, could become a difficult 
problem for the Western Powers if the incident is not settled by 
diplomatic means before additional tension as generated. At 
the time the Tripartite DeclaratiOn was issued, the Arab states 
were skeptical about its usefulness in preventing a violation at 
existing "frontiers or armistice lines," and they will undoubtedly 
regard the present case as a test of Western sincerity in the matter.)

US favors UN commission to hear Chinese Communists 
TheDepartment of State has informed US Ambassador 
Austin, in discussing the problem of Chinese Communist 
participation in the Security Council debates on Formosa, 
that although the US does not recognize the Peking regime 
as the government representing China the Department has 
decided that it is to the interest of the US to have the SC 
air Communist complaints in the Formosa case. The 
Department takes the view that the Chinese Communists 
would have to be given a hearing, although not necessarily 
in the initial stages of the debate, before the SC could take 
final action on the question and points out that failure to 
do so would offer the Communists a pretext to claim that 
self-help is their only remaining resort. The Department 
indicates the best procedure would be for� the SC to initiate 
an impartial inquiry by a commission which would give 
the Communists a full hearing and make a report, a pro-
cedure which might avoid the necessity for Communist 
participation in a hearing before the full SC.

1. Western Union favors seating Communist China in UN--
The Secretary General of the Netherlands Foreign Office 
has expressed to US Ambassador Chapin at The Hague the 
view that political thinking among the Western Union nations 
is becoming morie and more. staklified in. favor.of admitting 
the Chinese Communists to the UN without delay. The 
Dutch official said that this viewpoint has been kept "behind 
the scenes" because of a desire to avoid showing disunity 
during the Korean crisis, but that there was growing appre-
hension among the Western Union nations lest the increasipg 
tension between the US and Communist China extend the 
Korean conflict into a world war. 
2. Iranian views on Soviet trade negotiations�US Ambassador 
Grady in Tehran reports that Prime Minister Razmara has: 
(a) emphasized that he would not begin formal trade negotia-
tions with the USSR until a settlement had been reached 
regarding the gold and foreign exchange owed Iran; and (b) pro-
posed the use of some trade mechanism other than the ex-
isting Soviet commercial agency in Iran, which Razmara feels 
could be used to dominate Iranian traders and to carry on sub-
versive activities. Grady points out, however, that Razmara 
cannot be indifferent to the prospect of *concluding a trade 
agreement since Iran's northern provinces have alknost no 
trade outlets except the USSR and since conclusion of a 
a / atisfactory agreement, involving possibly $10 million worth 
bf goods, would provide immediate economic benefits and 
*could materially strengthen his position.

USDeputy High C9nuniSsioner Hays in Germany reports 
that Chancellor Adenauer 'has� submitted two letters to 
the Commission modifying his former advocacy of a heavily 
armed Federal police as a counterforce to the Soviet Zone 
paramilitary police organization. Adenauer now requests 
a motorized-Federal police fore of 25,000 men, to be ex-
panded later to 60,000. These police would be billeted in 
barracks, armed with automatic hand arms, heavy and light 
machine guns, hand grenades, and mortars, and would have 
at their disposal various support units. Because Adenauer 
fears that the Soviet Zone German police will invade West 
Germany as soon as the East German regime has been given 
independent status by the USSR, he also asks that the occupa-
tion governments guarantee to repel any attack by the East 
Germans. Adenauer believes that a public statement of such 
a guarantee would both strengthen West German morale and 
have a deterring effect on the authorities in East Germany 
and the USSR.

forces, concentrated on the border will remain a "passive 
but menacing back-stop" for the Viet Minh rebels and their 
presence in South China will permit Ho's forces to move back 
and forth across the border. In view of this Situation the 
French officials deplore both the "Maginot, mentality of the 
French military commander in Tonkin and General Carpentier's 
distrust of the powerful anti-Communist Dai Viet party (the 
only organization in Vietnam capable of carrying on a grass

3 West German steel problem-41S .Embassy London reports 
that, during an informal discussion with a British official 
of the problem of German steel production (which is already 
above prescribed levels), the British official appeared re-
ceptive to the idea of permitting an expansion of German steel 
output. The British representative felt, however, that any in-
crease in German production should be devoted to defense 
requirements and to easing shortages arising out of them and 
that any changes in the regulations on steel output should be 
made when the Occupation Statute is relaxed. The British re-
presentative suggested that specific proposals be developed 
for revising the restrictions on all West German industry to 
facilitate a US-UK-French agreement before thy end of 1950. 
4. West Germans to propose Occupation Statute revision--US 
High Commissioner McCloy in Bonn reports that the Federal 
Republic plans to recommend that the US-UK-French Foreign 
Ministers consider at their forthcoming meeting three revi-
sions of the Occupation Statute: (a) declaration of a de facto 
peace as quickly as legal requirements permit; (b) replacement 
of references to the "occupation" by some term implying security 
or protection; and (c) partial replacement of the Occupation Statute 
by a convention or contractual agreements. The Germans would 
also like the present "cumbersome legislative review" process to 
be replaced by a system under which the Western Powers could 
veto any German law contravening basic occupation principles. 
Reforms of this kind would be regarded by West Germans as 
"an enormous success for the Bonn Government."

1. Light action in south and northeast sectors--South Korean 
forces made limited gains in the north and east sectors, 
while UN defenders in the south were subjected to almost 
continuous small-unit probing attacks. UN naval units 
fired close support missions in the Pohang area; aircraft 
from two carriers attacked targets along the east coast. 
Air action continued in close support of ground troops, 
and B-29's hit the marshalling yards in the North Korean 
east coast city of Chongjin.

2. Adenauer now proposes "motorized" federal police-- US 
High Commissioner McCloy in Bonn reports. that because 
of French and Socialist opposition to Chancellor Adenauer's 
proposal for a West German force to match the paramilitary 
East German Alert Police, the Chancellor is now thinking 
in terms of establishing a motorized federal police equipped 
with small arms, machine guns, and mortars. Adenauer be-
� 
lieves such a force could maintain internal order and be use-
ful in international emergencies; he added that he had already 
received 40,000 applications. Adenauer believes his new 
proposal will meet with the approval of Socialist leader 
Schumacher. Rather than wait for time-consuming legislative 
approval, Adenauer wants the High Commission to declare an 
emergency and direct him to begin establishing the federal 
police at once; this action, Adenauer feels, could be ratified 
by the Bundestag in 60 to 90 days. Meanwhile, Adenauer 
broposes to go ahead with a 10,000-man increase in the 
LaencVer policeiNthich he wants reorganized to raise effi-
ciency and to eliminate subversives.

1. Central front quiet, two towns lost in northeast�The broad 
central front remained quiet during the past 48 hours, but 
UN forces suffered slight reverses in the northeast where 
North Korean forces captured the towns of Uihung and Kigye. 
UN naval activities were confined to suirface patrols, while 
naval-based aircraft flew close support missions and bombed 
targets in northeast Korea. On 27 August UN-US aircraft 
flew a total of 500 missions; fighters attacked a large troop 
concentration in the Kyomipo-Sariwon area (North Korea) 
and B-29's bombed the northeastern industrial city of

1. Lull in operations continues--The continuing lull in enemy 
operations along the entire front may indicate that the North 
Korean forces are being disengaged for regrouping before 
launching further attacks. Many of the invader's best units 
suffered heavy casualties during the past weekand a. major 
reorganization of enemy units may be necessary. Both sides 
continued probing and patrolling operations, but. few troops 
were engaged. Heaviest action occurred in the east sector, 
where South Korean units made slight withdrawals from ex 
tended positions, UN-US naval airplanes continued to provide 
close support for ground operations, and air force planes 
continued to attack enemy equipment, troop concentrations 
and other targets in rear areas.

1. Front lines remain static�No significant changes were made 
in the Korean front lines during the past 24 hours. Except for 
sharp local engagements, action on both sides was confined to 
patrolling and sporadic exchanges of mortar and artillery fire. 
In the south sector, the North Koreans continued to move re-
inforcements into the Chinju area and launched a strong attack 
against the US 25th Division. This attack was repulsed after 
him hours of heavy fighting. In the center sector, a night attack 
against the 27th Regiment north of Taegu was thrown back. 
South Korean forces in the north sector are under heavy enemy 
pressure north of Uihong and have been forced to withdraw 
slightly; counterattacks are now in progress. Concerning the 
report of new fighter-type aircraft, reconnaissance subsequent 
to the information of 24 August has disclosed no evidence of

According to US High Commissioner McCloy in Frankfurt, SL5 
West German Chancellor Adenauer has asked political party 
leaders to agree to a program under which the Federal Republic 
would request the High Commission to authorize: (a) a Federal 
police force equal in number and equipment to the East German 
Alert Police (Bereitsch,aften); and (b) about five German combat 
divisions, plus auxiliary services, for a European defense force. 
He told the party leaders that the arms and equipment for the 
troops would come from the US. Adenauer also wants to request 
the immediate reinforcement of Western occupation troops in 
Germany. Adenauer reportedly believes firmly that a European 
army is the most desirable solution of the defense problem.

most important development has been the clearing out of the 
communication line of the US 27th Regiment which had pre-

sure in this sector appears to have eased. In the north, South 
Korean forces have been forced back slightly under strong 
North Korean pressure. In the east, South Korean units con-
tinued to move northward. Naval action consisted solely of 
patrolling and bombarding targets along the east coast. B-29's 
bombed chemical plants at Hungnam with excellent results.

I. Little change in ground situation--The situation in the Korean 
front lines remained largely unchanged during the past 24 hours 
� while North Korean forces continued to press the attack along 
the south coast and in the Waegwan area. In the south, elements 
of the US 25th Division succeeded through limited counterattacks 
in regaining ground west of Masan which was lost during the 
previous day. In the center sector, six miles south of Tuksong, 
enemy forces were able to reinforce their bridgehead on the 
east bank of the Naktong River. Also in this sector, US forces 
are attempting to reduce enemy units which have infiltrated 
behind the US 27th Regiment and are cutting its communication

by air and sea units.

2. West German leader expects new pressure on Berlin--US High 
Commissioner McCloy in Frankfurt has been told by West

Schumacher believes the pressure will come not from the USSR 
itself but from the German Democratic Republic and may in-
volve the use of the Alert Police (Bereitschaften). Schumacher 
declared that a stronger resolution to block Communism is 
spreading among the West German people but said the presence 
of more Western divisions, particularly US,, is urgently needed 
in Germany because the Germans are reluctantA9pke a posi-
tive stand while they feel their country might be overrun. McCloy

defense of Europe to be impossible without German military 
aid, Schumacher consistently avoided giving any indication of 
what form he though Germany's contribution to European de-
fense should take. Schumacher expressed his doubt-doncerning 
the effectiveness of the small force proposed by Chancellor 
Adenauer to act as a counter to the Soviet Zone Bereitschaften 
but indicated a desire to make a common stand with Adenauer 
against Communism and for the restoration of German unity. 
This attitude McCloy regards as offering "a ray of hope for 
positive action."

intensive Communist drive to take over Berlin within the 
next few months but does not believe it likely that East German 
military forces will be used in a move against Berlin in 1950.)

US Embassy La Paz is advising women and children to leave 
the Catavi mine area. 
(CIA Comment: Discontent has recently beengeneral 
among mine labor, which is usually very volatile, and it is 
highly possible that violent disorders may occur. Such action 
would disrupt Bolivia's vital tin production and might, com-
bined with current disorders in La Paz, cause a serious

1. Heavy action in south and center sectors--The south and 
center sectors of the Korean front were the principal scenes 
of activity during the past 24 hours. In the south, the North 
Korean forces are exerting heavy pressure in the direction 
of Masan and have succeeded in forcing US units out of 
several advantageous positions. US counterattacks have 
failed to restore positions lost the day before. In the center 
sector, 15 miles north of threatened Taegu, the US 27th Regi-
ment and the South Korean 1st Division were successful in 
repelling heavy enemy attacks supported by tanks and artillery. 
Northeast of Waegwan, however, an enemy battalion has pene-

by the unscrupulous tactics used by Indian Prime Minister Nehru 
in blocking any solution of the Kashmir problem and by Nehru's 
apparent confidence that India will escape any UN Security Council 
criticism on this point because of its strategic position between the 
East and the West in the UN. Henderson comments that it should

UN forces are continuing to make gains in the central and 
east sectors. The enemy bridgehead over the Naktong 
River in the Changnyong area has been completely eliminated, 
and enemy attacks in both the southfancl central sectors 
have been repulsed. In the north, the enemy appears to 
be either withdrawing or shifting troops to other posi-
tions in the area. On the past coast, UN forces have 
pressed forward several Miles north of the recaptured 
towns of Kigye and Pohang. 
US Ambassador Muccio reports from Taegu that the 
the city is returning to normalcy after a large portion of 
the population streamed southward as a result of con-
flicting orders issued on 18 and 19 August. An estimated 
80 percent of those who left the city have returned, and, 
despite ineffective shelling of the city from extreme ranges, 
normal activities are being resumed. 
In the occupied areas, the North Koreans are at-
tempting to maintain control and security by imposing 
travel restrictions DU the movements of persons over 
12 kilometers from their domiciles.and.by threatening 
to impose the death penalty against all those who fail

1. �  Enemy making strong drive toward Taegu--Front line 
positions in Korea remained relatively unchanged during . 
the past 24 'hours while heavy fighting between small, units 
continued. In the south sector, in the vicinity of Chinju, 
North Korean forces have managed a quick reorganization 
following the planned withdrawal of Task Force Kean and 
have initiated a limited offensive against the US 25th 
Division in the Kosonz area. The enemy's main effort, 
� however, appears to be in the direction of Taegu through 
the central sector heldby the US 1st Cavalry and the South 
Korean 1st Division. In the heavy fighting going on in the 
vicinity of Waegwan, 1st Cavalry elements have recaptured 
an enemy-occupied hill and have inflicted heavy casualties. 
� Simultaneously, however, a strong enemy attack has forced 
a 1200-yard withdrawal of elements of the South Korean 
1st Division. North Korean forces are reportedly reorgan-
izing and regrouping in this area and further attacks in the 
direction of Taegu are expected. just south of Waegwan, 
North Koreanlorces are putting up strong resistance to 
heavy US counterattacks against the two bridgeheads on the 
east bank of the Naktong River. The situation of Pohang 
on the east coast is not clear although.late press reports 
claim its recapture by US-UN forces. 
Meanwhile, the South Korean National Assembly

1. Heavy fighting goes on throughout area--Heavy fighting 
continues in Korea but no significant changes have been 
� made in those areas where the heavy fighting is taking 
place. In the Chinju area, US forces have made a planned 
withdrawal of several miles and have consolidated; Task 
Force Kean, which has been conducting the offensive near 
Chinju, has been dissolved and its responsibilities turned 
over to the US 25th Division. To the north, in the Yongsan 
area where the North Koreans hold their strongest bridge-
head across the Naktong River, the US 24th Division has 
been reinforced by the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade 
and heavy fighting is taking place. An attempted enemy 
break-out from this bridgehead and a drive to sever the 
rail line to Pusan is expected, but latest reports indicate 
satisfactory US progress in restraining this movement. 
Farther to the north, in the Tuksong area west of Taegu, 
another enemy bridgehead has been established and is now 
under US attack. Immediately north of Tuksong, both US 
and South Korean troops have made gains against the 
enemy. To the east, the situation has remained stable. 
The evacuation by water of the South Korean forces near 
Yongdok has proceeded without enemy interference. Mean-
while, the South Korean National Assembly reconvened in

that only the formulation of a peace plan can meet this

of such a plan must be the unification of Korea and the

also told the US delegation that when he approached 
Malik concerning his plan for formation of a_committee of

posal but said he might change his mind if shown the ad-
vantages. When told by Rau that any proposal for peace

Malik asked whether "foreign troops" would also with-

3. European rearmament effort called inadequate--Executive 
Director Bonesteel of the European Coordinating Committee 
in London, in commenting on the proposed European defense 
increase of an estimated $3.5 billion over a three year 
period, stresses the view that this effort, even when added 
to the $13.5 billion of projected US aid, is inadequate to 
meet the requirements of effective defense. Bonesteel 
declares that the European, proposal reflects a glaringly 
disproportionate effort on the part of Europe and states the 
view that it is "almost worse than useless to do only half 
the job." He considers that the present European response 
reveals the blunt fact that Europeans-are not yet prepared 
to meet a reasonable proportion of the needs for adequate 
defense and, although they are prepared to make some effort 
within comfortable domestic political and economic limits, 
they are counting upon still greater US aid to fill the gap. 
Bonesteel feels that the above meager results can only be

4. .Possible German units in a European army--The US CIA /5 
High Commission in Germany expresses the view that 
even though there is a "wide difference of opinion" 
among Officials --at Bonn on the question of a German-con-
tribution to European security, it would be possible to 
raise a German force as part of a European army. The 
Commission believes that both the politicians and German 
youth oppose the reconstitution of a national German 
army but would be willing to make a real German contri-
bution to European security if certain assurances were 
given and if "the vision of an independent, viable Germany 
within a real European federation gave promise of be-
coming a reality. The Commission considers that the 
major German parties would not undertake any defense 
commitments unless a considerable revision of the occupa-
tion statute provided for increased German sovereignty 
and unless there were some form of Allied protection for 
Germany against the USSR.

I. UN forces make gains in two sectors--UN forces in Korea 
have achieved successes in the center and east sectors 
during the past 24 hours in heavy fighting against the North 
Korean forces. In the center sector, Task Force Hilfnd 
the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade are continuing their 
attack against the Changnyong bridgehead on the east bank 
of the Naktong River and are inflicting heavy enemy casual-
ties as they near the River. Also in the center sector, ,UN 
forces have regained high ground previously lost north of 
Taegu. In the north sector, South Korean forces have lost 
contact with the enemy southeast of Kunwi, 'indicating a 
possible redeployment of enemy units in this area. On the 
east coast, ROK forces succeeded in recapturing the towns 
of Pohang and Kigye and have advanced to high groundto-
the north. A heavy B-29 attack against military targets 
in the North Korean city of Chongjin on the east coast has 
reportedly achieved excellent results.

1, North Koreans further enlarge Naktong bridgehead--North 
Korean forces continued to enlarge the bridgehead along 
the Naktong River in the US 24th Division's area in the 
central sector. The enemy launched an early attack in the 
lower portion of this sector but after a three-hour engage-
ment the attack was stopped. To the south, Task Force Kean 
continued to consolidate its gains around Chinju and to wipe 
out isolated enemy pockets. In the western sector, North 
Korean armored forces reportedly penetrated South Korean 
positions and occupied a hill about two miles east of Waegwan. 
South Korean troops near Yongdok will be evacuated by water 
under cover of darkness. US air forces, in the largest raid 
yet made in the Korean war, made a strike of 100 B-29's 
carrying a total load of 1000 tons of bombs against enemy 
concentrations on the west bank of the Naktong River,

2. UK unable to send troops from Malaya or Hong Kong to Korea--
US Ambassador Douglas in London, in compliance with instruc-
tions from the Department of State, has pointed out to Prime 
Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Sevin the desirability 
of immediately dispatching British ground forces to Korea, 
possibly sending troops now in Malaya or Hong Kong. In reply, 
Attlee and Bevin said that to withdraw troops from Malaya 
would seriously endanger the outcome there and that present 
forces in Hong Kong are not adequate to deal with the situation 
which might develop there. The British officials indicated 
they understand the importance of refuting Soviet propaganda 
aimed at convincing the world the UN effort in Korea is ex-
clusively a US venture. They also indicated they would do 
everything possible to expedite the movement of troops to 
Korea.

1. Mirth Koreans continue build-up along Naktong�While the 
r North Koreanscontinued to build up their forces along the 
west bank of the Naktong River--now estimated at six divi-

military situation in Korea during the past 24 hours. Task 
Force Kean continued to wipe out enemy pockets in the Chinju 
region and to consolidate defense positions. Task Force Hill_ 
kept the North Korean bridgehead in the US 24th Division's 
zone under pressure and made limited progress toward re-
ducing it. The situation in the Yongdok-Pohang area remains 
static. Meanwhile, there have been no significant North

Nationalist troops from Burmese territory. The Prime Min-
ister stated that, as a result of the Chinese Nationalist action, 
he would not raise the question of these troops in the UN on 
15 August as was previously planned.

just south and east of the city of Chinju, but considerable

which are now har.assing,lbies of_tommunic-atibn; The 
enemy continues to build up troops and equipment in the 
central sector, where UN forces are increasing their efforts 
to liquidate stubbornly-held bridgeheads east of the Naktong

Korean forces still hold the smoldering city of Pohang and 
UN troops are maintaining their defense perimeter around 
the adjacent fighter. airfield. UN naval units bombarded the 
North Korean port of Chinnampo on the west coast and sank 
two enemy ships; UN air units continued to provide close

2. Kirk's estimate of Soviet intent�US Ambassador Kirk in 
Moscow reports that neither the Korean conflict nor the 
obvious increase in the intensity of the war of nerves has 
altered the Embassy's basic opinion that the Soviet leaders 
do not desire to engage the USSR in a global conflict in the 
near future. The Ambassador feels that the Soviet action 
in Korea was merely a step forward in the Kremlin's pro-
gram to make the most effective use of Soviet capabilities 
for championing world peace movements and simultaneously 
creating a war scare. Kirk is convinced that the Kremlin 
did not expect the North Korean invasion to bring about C.-. 
united _condemnation by 53 UN members or to provoke an 
increase in Western defense preparations to cope with an 
eventual major crisis. Kirk believes that the Kremlin, in 
the light of this new situation, is now considering the rela-
tive merits of: (a) touching off at least initially localized

hostilities through a Satellite state on another scene (China

resources and increasing the strain on its solidarity; and 
(b) allowing a settlement to work itself out in Korea, perhaps 
over Soviet protests, and permitting a world-wide atmos-
phere of relaxation to set in, thereby "giving the huge mili-
tary preparations in the West no place to go." Kirk com-
ments that the Kremlin may wish, by permitting the Korean 
situation to work itself out and by maintaining the "mystery 
of Soviet strength, "to keep the West so expensively mobilized 
that the economic burden will cause disaffection among West-
ern peoples and make them more receptive to Soviet blandish-
ments. Kirk suggests that the peace movement and a con-
tinuation or intensification of the present war of nerves would 
be features of such a long-range Soviet program. 
.WESTERN EUROPE 
3. NAT countries await US leadership--Executive Director 
Bonesteel of the European Coordinating Committee in London, 
in discussing prospects for increased defense efforts by West-
ern Europe, expresses the opinion that at least some of the 
NAT deputies appear to be waiting to see to what extent the 
US is prepared to undertake, even conditionally, increased 
commitments in the West European defense program. Bone-
steel adds that these NAT deputies seem to be especially 
concerned with: (a) the assignment of additional US forces 
to European defense; (b) the creation of a central high command; 
(c) the establishment of "ex'ecutive authorities" in the NATO. 
Bonesteel comments that the amount and speed of substantive 
achievements in the forthcoming discussions among NAT 
deputies z "may depend in large part on US willingness" to 
assume leadership in these matters. 
(CIA Comment: The speed of progress toward an 
effective European defense will be determined in very large 
measure by the degree of leadership exercised by the US.)

1. Enemy strengthening bridgehead southwest of Taegu--UN 
forces in the south are continuing their advance toward 
Chinju against lessening opposition, but other UN forces 
in the central sector are confronted with growing enemy 
strength in the bridgehead southwest of Taegu. Bitter 
fighting is taking place in the vicinity of Pohang and the 
nearby fighter airfield, with reinforced UN troops under. 
strong enemy pressure. 
UN B-29's, in the northernmost raid to date, dropped 
550 tons of bombs on the important seaport and rail center 
of Najin-Dong, approximately 100 miles southwest of Vladi-

of communication and provided close support for UN ground

2. Chinese NationalistAroop_s Burma--The Department of 
State has informed US Embassy Taipei that an early settle-
ment of the problem of some 2,000 Chinese Nationalist 
troops, who took refuge in northeastern Burma and who 
have refused to be interned by the Burmese Government, 
seems possible only through a Nationalist Government order 
to these troops to permit themselves to be disarmed� The 
Department notes that the US can give the Nationalist Gov-
ernment no assistance if this question is brought before the 
UN and instructs the Embassy to urge the Government on 
Formosa to issue the necessary orders before Burma acts 
in the UN as it has proposed to do by .15 August. 
(CIA Comment: The raising of this problem in the 
UN would hamper US efforts to focus attention on Korea and 
adversely affect US-Burmese relations. The USSR would 
also be provided with a useful propaganda opportunity.)

UN forces continuing their attack on the southern front 
against sporadic opposition have now driven within a few 
miles of Chinju. An enemy bridgehead containing two 
regiments in the central sector southwest of Taegu is 
stubbornly holding on; enemy troops and equipment are 
being built up in considerable strength on the west side 
of the Naktong above this bridgehead. Little change took 
place during the past 24 hours in the general northern 
sector, but an enemy force of two regiments, supported 
by artillery and tanks, is now fighting in Pohang and 
threatening the nearby fighter airfield at Yonil. UN air 
and naval units continued to provide close support for 
ground troops at various points along the defense peri-
meter. 
US Ambassador Mucci� in Korea reports that, 
of the 20,000 South Korean personnel in training, an 
estimated 5,000 are now available for combat. A lack of 
small arms and infantry support weapons, however, makes 
it impossible to utilize these 5,000, and Mucci� recomk.-
mends that the necessary weapons be forwarded by airlift. 
Radio Pyongyang has announced that as of 31 July, 
49.5 percent of all crop taxes in kind had been paid and 
has called on the People's Committees to see to it that 
crops are harvested on time. The unusually low percentage 
figure (North Koreans regularly claim 90 percent) may indi-
cate a shortage of North Korean agricultural manpower and 
security police forces.

WESTERN EUROPE 
2. Views on West European defense--US Ambassador Kirk 
In Moscow is inclined to doubt UK Foreign Minister Bevin's 
assumption that West German rearmament would in itself 
cause the USSR to attack immediately in Western Europe. 
Kirk believes: (a) a Kremlin decision to move militarily 
in Europe would be based on its estimate of military con-
sequences and a rearmed West Germany would not be an 
important consideration at this time; (b) "Eve cannot pre-
dicate our preparations on the hope that a soft answer 
turneth away wrath"; and (c) West Germany cannot be left 
defenseless until France and Belgium are strong enough 
to match a rearmed West Germany without increasing the 
risk of losing the entire country to the USSR. In order to 
offset the fears of Germany's western neighbors, West 
German rearmament should, in the Ambassador's opinion, 
be a part of the NAT defense mechanism. A West German 
police force an exact counterpart in size, armament, and 
training of the existing East German paramilitary organi� 
-
zation, should effectively counter the threat of military 
action against West Germany. Kirk also recommends full 
and early use of the West German industrial production 
capacity for non-military items. 
Meanwhile, US Ambassador Bruce in Paris urges 
that the European rearmament program be operated as a 
collective enterprise and not as a combination of separate 
national efforts. Bruce feels that, to date, integrated 
planning has been lacking in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. 
He believes such collective planning should start with an 
estimate of the forces needed for the defense of Western 
Europe and with provisions for producing and financing the 
'necessary military equipment and supplies. The Ambassador

also feels thatan American should head a small group of 
experts to develop the proposed procurement and production 
program, which would use West German industrial capacity 
for the production of non-combat items, such as trucks 
and spare parts. Bruce observes that the French idea of 
creating a central military fund, presumably directed by an 
American, has "great merit" for unifying West European 
defense efforts, and increasing efficiency and econsmay. 
Bruge is convinced that the necessary safeguards can be 
set up to prevent US funds from being improperly distrib-
uted by a central military fund administration.

1. UN attack in south accelerating--Attacking UN forces near 
Chinju are accelerating their pace and forcing the retreating 
North Koreans to abandon equipment and supplies as they 
move back. The enemy may attempt to consolidate a new 
defense line on the high ground southeast of Chinju. In the 
central sector, UN forces are continuing to reduce enemy 
bridgeheads which are apparently not being reinforced, while 
In the north sector, South Korean troops have regained the 
� ground they lost during the past 48 hours. On the east coast, 
however, strengthened enemy forces have again captured 
Yongdok and North Korean elements are reported to have 
joined guerrillas in the vicinity of Kigye, nine miles inland 
from Pohang. This enemy penetration along the east coast 
constitutes a serious threat to the port city and the airfield 
nearby.

US Ambassador Muccio reports that the South Korean 
Cabinet, with President Rhee's approval, designated a 
"special war committee of the Cabinet" on 3 August, con-
sisting of the Ministers of Defense, Interior, Transportation,

daily to receive military briefings and to consider non. 
military measures to support the war effort. The Cabinet 
also approved in principle the establishment of a military 
advisory council to assist the Defense Minister.

2. Views on Western European defense--Netherlands Foreign S 
Minister Stikker, in discussing the Brussels Pact meeting _ 
of 1 August with US Ambassador Chapin at The Hague, reports / 
that British Foreign Secretary Bevin favors postponing the S/,5 
the rearming of West Germany because of his fear that such 
an action might be a direct incitement to the Kremlin to 
attack. Bevin also feels that the rearming of Germany should 
wait until France and Belgium are strong enough to balance 
increased German strength., Bevin did say, however, that 
Germany must be made an integral part of Western Europe 
as soon as possible. According to Stikker, Foreign Minister' 
Schuman of France, Van Zeeland of Belgium, and Bech of 
Luxembourg concurred in the views of Bevin. During the 
Brussels Pact meeting, French Foreign Minister Schuman 
expressed complete dissatisfaction with progress in Western 
Union and North Atlantic Treaty staff planning; Schuman 
remarked that it was impossible for individual nations to 
rearm effectively without a "strong central coordinating 
authority." Stikker told Chapin that he personally believes 
Germany should be rearmed at the first practical moment, . 
and that he had made "great efforts" to convert the French 
to his view. Stikker also believes that the Western European 
defense line must be established in West Germany and not 
in the Netherlands, if the full cooperation of the Dutch people 
is to be obtained. 
Meanwhile, high British officials have expressed to 
US Ambassador Douglas in London their concern over the 
"inadequacy of additional preparedness efforts currently 
contemplated by European countries, including the UK, 
and stressed the "need for US pressure on all concerned." 
The officials stated that the UK had long endeavored to 
stimulate greater efforts by the Western Union countries, 
but was handicapped by its limited capacity "to give or 
withhold." The officials think West European governments 
� (4nd the government of the UK, would "welcome US pressure� 
which would strengthen them in dealing with parliaments and 
public opinion.

1. Defenders withdrawing to Naktong river defense line  --UN 
forces along the broad central front in Korea are making 
an orderly and planned withdrawal to new positions on the 
east bank of the Naktong river, which offers the best 
natural defense line in the area remaining in the hands of 
the defenders. Sharp attacks by fresh US troops have 
apparently blunted the attempt of North Korean forces to 
turn the extreme left flank east of Chinju; South Korean 
troops have again pushed back the invaders north of Yong-
dok on the east coast. The UN defenders now have limited 
reserve forces located in the areas of Pusan-Masan and 
Taegu. , 
UN naval forces bombarded the town of Mokpo 
along the southwest coast, and the east coast naval payol 
continued to provide close fire support for UN forces in 
the Yongdok sector. B-29's made their third bombing - 
raid on industrial targets in Hangnarn (chemical center 
of North Korea); other air activity was limited to close-
ground support missions and attacks on enemy lines of 
communication. 
The North Korean radio broadcasts are now 
claiming that elections have been held for "Peoples 
Committees" in virtually all the "liberated" provinces 
. in South Korea. North Korean i,ropaganda has always � 
insisted that the Peoples Committees, which were banned 
in South Korea by the US Military Government in Septem-
ber 1945, were the rightful organs of government for all 
Korea. The "re-establishment" of these Committees 
has been consistently presented as the first step in the 
"liberation" of South Korea. The announcement of these 
"elections" paves the way for later propaganda claims 
that South Koreans have approved their integration into 
the fraineWork, of the North Korean Democratic Peoples

2. French favor "common defense" for Western Europe--
During a recent discussion of West European defense 
problems with French leaders, US Ambassador Bruce 
was told by Premier Pleven that the French lack of con-
fidence in their ability to create from their own resources 
a military organization capable of withstanding aggression 
makes it necessary to provide for the defense of Western 
Europe under a common military establishment. Pleven 
added that it would be easier for the French Government 
to force a reorganization of the French army under 
orders from a central authority. During the discussions, 
Minister of Defense Mock expressed the opinion that 
the "common approach" is the only formula under which 
the French people could be brought to accept the partici-
pation of Western Germany in a North Atlantic Treaty

I. US troops attacking on south flank near Chinju--Fresh US 
troops are counterattacking along the extreme left flank 
near Chinju in an effort to halt the North Koreans, who are 
only 40 miles from the key port city of Pusan. UN forces 
also advanced slightly north of Yongdok on the east coast, 
but the enemy retained the initiative at all other points 
along the defense perimeter. In the central sector, UN 
forces withdrew slightly under heavy enemy pressure. UN 
aircraft flew 425 sorties during the past 24 hours (the 
largest total of the war) and reported the destruction of 
6 enemy tanks, 45 trucks, 1 bridge, and other military 
equipment and targets. Two air raids caused heavy damage 
in Hangnam, North Korea, where the three major industrial-
chemical plants of Korea are located. One plant is the 
largest explosive producer on the Asiatic mainland; the 
second is one of the largest chemical fertilizer and synthetic 
ammonia plants in the world; and the third manufactures 
industrial chemicals, including chlorine, caustic soda, and 
calcium carbide. 
A refugee from Seoul reports that all persons be-
tween the ages of 17 and 30 have been mobilized for support 
of the North Korean military effort. The men have been� 
assigned to haul supplies to the battle areas while the women 
prepare food for the troops and repair roads. The Commu-
nist radio in Pyongyang recently announced the arrival of 
volunteer Hungarian and Bulgarian medical groups, which 
are apparently scheduled to serve with North Korean troops.

the UN has made a deep impression on Soviet leaders, and that 
the Kremlin must view with serious concern the march of events 
which threatens to make the West much stronger within a year 
or two. 
The Embassy estimates that the Kremlin may no* feel 
that propaganda moves and obstruction within the UN are in-
sufficient and that the time has come for making concrete ap-
peasement moves which would tend to relax the marshalling of 
the free world's strength. In assessing Soviet intent in returning 
to the UN the Embassy points out that now is the propitious 
time for UN,
moves in Korea and comments that the USSR 
will probably submit proposals based on the withdrawal of foreign 
troops and new elections, perhaps under UN observation. If the 
USSR intends a real appeasement move, the Embassy believes the 
proposal may be accompanied by a withdrawal of North Korean 
troops to the 38th Parallel to avoid their eventual defeat and to 
permit maximum political capital to be derived from the Soviet 
role of "peacemaker." The Embassy warns that the outcome of 
such elections might favor the Korean Communists. The Embassy 
suggests the USSR will continue to link a peaceful settlement in Korea 
to the question of admitting the Chinese Communists to the UN, 
with a vote delayed for the time being, and that the USSR may 
attempt to make Formosa an issue in the hope of exploiting the. 
US unilateral commitment on. that island. The Embassy believes 
the Kremlin's eyes are on the major issues involved, and doubts 
that the USSR is returning to the SC with the somewhat legalistic 
Motive of blocking UN action wits xegard to aggression elsewhere.

3. Indian Cabinet said to be anxious for Kashmir settlement- /75 
-
A representative of one of India's "most powerful political 
figures" has informed US Ambassador Henderson in New 
Delhi that the Indian Cabinet was "extremely anxious" to 
have the Kashmir dispute settled promptly in a way which 
would leave as little bitterness as possible. The Cabinet 
was reported to be convinced that the only possible basis for 
such a solution was UN Mediator Dixon's recent suggestion 
that a plebiscite be held in the Vale of Kashmir (which would 
probably vote in favor of Pakistan) but that the rest of Kashmir 
�be partitioned along present occupation lines, thus assuring India 
that it would obtain Jammu. Dixon reportedly made his suggestion 
after it became clear that Indian Prime Minister Nehru was un-
willing to agree to a general plebiscite, even under the "generous 
concessions" which Pakistani Premier Liaquat All Khan had offered. 
Pointing out that Liaquat had violently apposed Dixon's proposal, 
Henderson's informant voiced the hope of "several prominent Indian 
leaders" that "anything the US could discreetly do" to modify Paki-
stan's opposition would be valuable. Henderson comments that Nehru, 
who was described to him as somewhat reluctant to go along with 
Dixon's proposal, appears to want to get certain concessions from 
� Pakistan in return for his agreement to a solution which would prob-
ably give the Vale of Kashmir to Pakistan.

1. Little change in tactical situation--There have been no 
substantial changes in the tactical situation in the past 
twenty-four hours. Principal activity has been in the key 
western sector where North Korean troops are exerting 
heavy pressure against the US First Cavalry and Twenty-
Fifth Infantry Divisions. In the southwestern sector, enemy 
troops are moving eastward toward contact with advanced 
US positions. Further to the north enemy troops are moving 
east to gain positions on the road running north from Kochang 
to Kumchon, present headquarters of the First Cavalry Divi-
sion on the main rail line from Kumchon to Pusan. Positions 
are generally stabilized in the eastern sector where South 
Korean troops hold the line, although the concentration of 
enemy troops indicates the possibility of a major push 
towards Hamchang in the direction of Kumchon and Taegu. 
An attack by UN forces toward Yongdok on the east coast 
met stiff enemy resistance, and no change in the location 
of the front line one mile south of Yongdok has been reported. 
US naval units continued to support ground forces in the 
Yongdok area by off-shore bombardment of enemy concentra-
dons, and other units launched four carrier air strikes, hitting 
enemy lines of communication and troop concentrations in the 
southwest and west sectors. 
The United Nations Commission on Korea estimates 
that from 750,000 to 1,000,000 refugees are now added to the 
'3,000,000 persons normally occupying the area still under 
ROK control. Water supplies are deficient and unreliable, 
sanitation extremely poor, and congested living conditions 
most serious. Although this congestion and continued mili-
tary reverses are unquestionably having a deleterious effect 
on the morale of the South Koreans, they are continuing to 
, support the government.

2. Views on US policy toward Korea--US Ambassador Kirk thi5 
in Moscow has emphasized the importance of clarifying 
US political objectives in Korea and of properly correlating 
US policy in Korea with the problems of containing Soviet 
expansion in other areas of the world. Kirk believes the 
key political issue regarding Korea is whether UN forces 
should be committed now or in the near future to the elimina-
tion of Soviet influence and power from Korea north of the 
38th parallel. Ambassador Kirk recommends that the UN 
declare its determination to assist the Koreans by all possible 
means to achieve their freedom in an independent, unified 
and democratic state, but believes it would be decidedly pre-
mature in such a declaration definitely to commit the US to 
the use of its forces north of the 38th parallel. Kirk stresses 
that the US is not now in a position to make a realistic ap-
praisal of the obstacles, military and otherwise, which will 
exist after North Korean troops are driven back to the 38th 
parallel. According to Kirk, elementary prudence dictates 
that the US not now assume an obligation which would re-
quire a US military effort out of proportion to the political 
and strategic importance of Korea. 
In estimating Soviet intentions, Kirk points out that 
the USSR has thus far cautiously avoided involving Soviet 
prestige and has given no indication of its reaction when the 
tide of battle turns against North Korean troops. In support 
of his belief that the USSR at that critical point will not 
throw .its own forces or those of the Chinese Communists 
into South Korea, Kirk points to: (a) estimated Soviet re-
luctance to initiate global war; (b) the flexibility shown by 
the USSR when confronted with opposition in such areas as 
Iran, tee co and Berlin; and (c) the Soviet attitude since the 
.Korearl'fighting began. Kirk considers it more likely that the 
'USSR will attempt to arrange some kind of truce on the basis 
� 
Approved for Release: 2019/01/02 C06749454 
Approved for Release: 2019/01/02 C06749454 
of the status quo, and, if unsuccessful, to withdraw North 
Korean troops to the 38th parallel. This latter move might 
be accompanied by a proclamation affirming the inviolability 
of the 38th parallel. On the other hand, if the USSR should 
decide that a commitment to defend North Korea would in-
volve too great a risk of global war, Kirk recommends that 
the US be prepared to take advantage of any temporary mili-
tary vacuum and, coincident with political unification moves 
by the UN, take whatever military measures might be neces-
sary to maintain internal law and order north of the 38th 
parallel. 
3. UK views on Soviet intentions--According to US Ambassador CIAls 
Douglas, the UK Foreign Office is considering two very 
tentative hypotheses concerning the Soviet return to the 
Security Council. One is that the USSR, planning to achieve 
its objectives through the "simulation of cooperation," will 
pursue a course aimed at ending the Korean conflict and 
solving the problem of Chinese representation in order to 
lull the West into a false sense of security, justify a demand 
for the withdrawal of US troops, and enable US action regard-
ing Formosa to be chkllenged in the SC as a threat to the 
peace. The other is that the USSR intends to block further 
effective action through the UN, not only in Korea but in such 
areas as Iran or Indochina. The Foreign Office believes it 
would be a tactical error to permit the USSR to give priority 
at the SC meeting to the question of the Chinese representative.

1. North Koreans attack in central sector--North Korean forces 
in considerable strength are attacking US positions in the cen-
tral sector near the vital city of Yongdong, and at the same time 
enemy forces are attempting to turn the defensive flanks in the 
extreme south and along the east coast near the battered city 
of Yongdok. Present evidence indicates the invading forces have 
the reserves and equipment necessary to launch a major onslaught 
designed to destroy the defending UN forces or to push them into 
the sea. In the southern area, the North Korean. Fourth Division 
has advanced well beyond Hadong along the road toward Chinju 
and enemy forces in battalion strength have occupied the port 
city of Yosu. Along the northern flank, the battered port city of 
Yongdok has rezorteelLy been recaptured by South Korean forces - 
following a saturation bombardment of the city by US naval forces. 
The navy also bombarded other points in enemy-held territory 
along the east coast. 
Approximately 132 of the 210 South Korean National 
Assemblymen met in Taegu for their first post-invasion meet-
ing to hear President Rhee and Assembly Speaker Shin declare 
their confidence in an eventual UN victory in Korea. Rhee and 
Shin also expressed confidence that the 38th Parallel boundary 
would be abolished and that the fatherland would be unified. 
During the course of this meeting, radio broadcasts originating 
from the North Korean capital of Pyongyang sent out an appeal 
allegedly made by 48 former members of the South Korean Na-
tional Assembly in Seoul asking the Assemblymen in Taegu to 
withdraw their support of Rhee and come over to the side of the. 
"people." Foreign correspondents of the Communist press of 
France, England, and China, now touring North Korean cities that 
have been bombed by US forces, report that US planes are bomb-
ing from above the clouds and clearly engaging in "terroristic 
bombing designed to kill the peaceful inhabitants." Such reports 
are obviously designed to feed the Communist propaganda charg-
ing that the US is the aggressor against Asiatic peoples.

2. Reactions to suggested UN Commission for Yugoslavia-- The CIA /5 
US Delegation to the UN agrees in principle with the Depart- 
ment of State's suggestion that a Security Council Commission " 
be established and sent to Yugoslavia and possibly other sen-
sitive areas, but believes a more general approach to the 
problem of preventing a spread in the Korean conflict would 
be more practical. The Delegation feels that greater Security 
Council support can be obtained for the more general approach 
because such an approach would avoid discussion of specific 
areas, thus reducing the chances of highlighting present dif-
ferences among friendly nations. The Delegation proposes 
that a Security Council Commission or any committee appointed 
by it be authorized to observe any area where international 
peace or security may be endangered. The Delegation feels 
that the introduction of such a proposal before the return to 
the SC of Soviet delegate Malik on 1 August would secure the 
"initiative" for the West. 
US Ambassador Kirk in Moscow feels that sending an 
observation group to inspect the Yugoslav border might =de-
sirably pinpoint Yugoslavia as the predestined next victim of 
Soviet aggression and react to the disadvantage of Yugoslavia 
in its ideological war. Kirk suggests that the establishment 
of UN observation teams on a regional basis (such as Europe, 
the Near East, and South Asia) might be an effective approach.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE SOVIET UNION'S RETURN TO THE UN 
Although it is too early to discern clearly the Soviet Union's 
motives in returning to the UN, this surprise move re-establishes 
the Soviet Union's freedom of action in the UN and opens the door 
either to some form of negotiated solution of the Korean conflict 
or to obstruction of further UN action concerning Korea and other� 
areas where the USSR may plan overt moves. The move,lias made, 
however, at the expense of an announced Soviet objective, the prior 
seating of the Chinese Communists in the Security Council. This 
modification of Soviet terms, as set forth in the Stalin-Nehru ex:-
change, suggests that the Soviet objective in returning to the SC 
may be to seize the opportunity, at this low ebb in US military 
fortunes, for a favorable settlement of the Korean war. More-
over, the USSR probably considers that the tactical defeat suffered 
in returning before the Chinese Communists were seated will be 
largely obscured by the overwhelming North Korean military 
successes. It also seems likely that the USSR, having under-
estimated world reaction to the Korean conflict and disturbed at 
the coalescing of the non-Soviet world behind the US through the 
UN, is seizing this favorable opportimity both to strengthen its 
fropaganda position as a "peace-loving ' state not directly in-
th 
,, olved in e Korean conflict and to exert greater influence in 
glare TX deliberations. 
It is possible that the USSR, anxious to see a compromise 
�golution on�favorable terms at a time when Communist prestige 
in\ Korea is at a peak, is returning to the UN in order to set the 
stake for compromise negotiations. With the possibility that US 
forces will -be-either oonftned-to-a-srnall Oerimeter around Pusan 
orldrivementirely_ from Korea, the USSR may consider the pres-
ent.time a highly favorable opportunity to seek a solution which,

while apparently compromise in nature, would eventually 
secure the fruits of victory to the USSR. 
On the other hand, it is possible that the Sovipt 
Union, pursuing a new phase of more active aggression 
and perhaps contemplating further moves in other areas, 
has determined tccr,etitrn.to the UN with the purely obstruc-
tive purposiKoniamstringing the further consolidation of 
UN acticimbi Korea or even shielding from similar UN 
action other moves it may have in mind. In this case, not 
only the Soviet veto but the Chinese Communist issue 
would provide weapons forcontesting the legality of any 
UN action. This is particularly true in such a case as 
Formosa where the USSR might be in the position of being 
able to call on the UN to prevent the US from blocking the 
movement of Chinese forces from one part of China to 
another.

1. Defense lines stable, but enemy build-up continues--No major 
changes have occurred in the defense line during the past 24 
hours, but the continuing build-up of enemy pressure in all 
sectors increases the possibility that the North Koreans are 
preparing for another onslaught. In the south, the North Korean 
Fourth Division was forced back two miles by attacking US forces 
east of Hadong. In the area southwest of Yongdong,envelopmerit 
isolated one company of US troops; a second attack by the enemy 
succeeded in making a minor penetration into southern-held ter-
ritory near Kidae. On the eastern sector south of Yongju, UN 
forces repulsed the Seventh North Korean Division offensive whicho 
was supported by tanks. 
North Korean propaganday_which is being supervised by 
Soviet advisors, is stressing Stalin's reply to Nehru 's letter on 
the Korean issue as further evidence of the Soviet desire to 
defend the peace and security of the world. Radio broadcastd 
state that the North Korean regime would welcome a "peacefuli 
settlement;" but repeat the point made by Stalin to Nehru that 
the door to such a peaceful settlement will be open only after 
delegates of the Chinese People's Republic are seated in the

1. Defense perimeter within 100 miles of Pusan--The winding 
defense line, against which the North Koreans are throwing 
an estimated nine divisions, is now within 75 airline miles 
of Pusan along the left flank, 105 airline miles from Pusan 
in the central sector, and 90 airline miles above Pusan along 
the east coast. Despite heavy losses and disrupted and ex-
tended lines of communication, the enemy is still superior to 
the three US Divisions and four South Korean Divisions in 
manpower, equipment, and guns.

1351 
The recent advance of enemy forces in the southwest 
has secured practically all of that area, and advance elements 
are moving east to Hadong on the coast road to Pusan. In the 
western sector the enemy has forced elements of the US First 
Cavalry to withdraw to new positions three miles east and 
south of Yongdong. The central sector has been relatively 
quiet. North Koreans are continuing their build-Up in the 
Tayang-Punggi-Yongju area, however, and the appearance - 
there of fresh enemy troops increases the possibility of a major 
enemy effort to break through unrested South Korean divisions 
to Taegu. On the east coast, enemy strength has been increased 
in the Yongdok area by the appearance there of the Fifth Division, 
and additional enemy troops in undetermined strength are moving 
south along the east coast road below Samchok. 
US and British fleet units conducted a carrier air strike 
against southwestern Korea during the past 24 hours, but in 110 
sorties over the Kunsan-Mok0o-Kwangju area the pilots could find 
no enemy troop concentrations or movements. The enemy is 
apparently observing strict camouflage discipline and moves on 
the roads by night whenever possible.

sador Chapin at The Hague has learned from an intermediate 
source that the Chief of the Dutch Air Force is very much 
interested in the possibility of forming a Dutch fighter plane 
unit (using US planes) for UN service in Korea. The Air Force

3. HICOG estimate of Soviet actions in Germany during 1950-- CM/S 
US High Commissioner McCloy in Frankfort transmits the 
High Commission's estimate that during the remainder of C/49/5 
1950 the USSR will intensify its efforts to overthrow by 
disruption and subversion the present social and economic 
order in West Berlin and Western Germany. The Commis-
sion believes that only the outbreak of global war or drastic 
Western action as yet unscheduled would alter present Soviet 
plans for Western Germany during 1950. A new danger period 
will probably begin for West Berlin, possibly in conjunction 
with a Soviet grant of "some form of peace settlement" to 
the German Democratic Republic, which is most likely to 
occur following the 15 October elections scheduled for East 
Germany. There will also be increased pressure for the with-
drawal of We'stern occupation forces and the USSR will intensify 
Its efforts to establish subversive networks throughout West 
Germany. The Commission feels that during the next few years 
the USSR is willing "to go very close to precipitating a world war"

in an effort to win all of Germany and that the USSR will 
make preparations for an eventual attack by the East German 
republic against Western Germany. The inability of the Ger-
man Federal Republic and the Western Powers to solve West 
German problems tends to discourage the Germans from com-
mitting themselves unequivocally with the West; the Commission 
feels this German reluctance will grow.if the campaign in Korea 
continues to be unfavorable to the US and UN.

1. North Koreans launching supreme effort to drive out UN forces--
The invaders are massing all available manpower and equipment 
along the entire front in what may be their supreme effort to drive 
the UN forces into the sea before US reinforcements can arrive 
to redress the present North Korean superiority in troops and 
armored equipment. The North Koreans are continuing their 
unopposed drive through southwestern Korea, with an enemy 
force in regimental strength reported to be in the coastal city 
of Mokpo. Along the front from Taejon to the east, the enemy 
continues to mass troops and materiel and to increase pressure 
against US and South Korean positions. Two new North Korean 
divisions, have been identified in the central sector, which, com-
bined with the shifting of the combat-wise North Korean First 
Division, indicates preparations for a major push south toward 
Taegu and Kumchon. Enemy troops south of Yongdok on the 
east coast were pushed back one mile by US-South Korean forces, 
but the situation remains serious. Aircraft of the US Seventh 
Fleet are striking at enemy troops in southwest Korea. 
Reports from refugees indicate that Seoul, the former South 
Korean capital, is suffering from inflation and a rice famine, with 
rice prices there ranging from 7 to 11 times the levels prevailing 
in Pusan and Taegu. On the third day of enemy occupation, author-
ities confiscated all rice found during a house-to-house search and 
the people in Seoul have been without rice since that time.

1. Invaders advance steadily along entire front--North Korean 
forces are building up additional strength while moving for-
ward steadily in all sectors except in southwestern Korea, 
where unopposed Northern troops are sweeping rapidly toward 
the southwest coastal towns of Mokpo and Yosu. The invading 
forces driving rapidly over the undefended road net of south-
western Korea apparently have the capability of overrunning 
the entire southwest. Once in control of Southwest Korea, the 
invaders will be in a position to flank the provisional capital 
of Taegu, and then to move along the southern coast road to-
ward Pusan. In the western sector, where the enemy has re-
portedly massed 10,000 troops west of Taejon, the North 
Koreans have advanced approximately seventeen miles beyond 
Taejon toward Yongdom. Enemy pressure against the US 25th 
Division sector to the east of Taejon is increasing, and further 
east the enemy Fifteenth Division has made small advances. 
On the east coast, the enemy has recaptured Yongclok and has 
at least two regiments in this area threatening the US position 
at Pohang. Planes of "the US Seventh Fleet hit niilitary targets 
in the Seoul-ICaesong area during the past 48 hours, and clearing 
weather permitted land-based aircraft to give maximum support 
to UN ground forces during the past 24 hours. 
Ambassador Mucci� in Taegu points out that it is essential 
to keep the thousands of refugees crowded into the, remaining South 
Korean territory hopeful and confident of the future; he proposes 
that the Southern economy be maintained as nearly as possible to 
normal and that preparations be made now to Improve the standard. 
of living after theend of hostilities. Among the projects suggested 
by Muccio are the establishment of technical training institutes for 
agriculture, fisheries and mechanical fields'.

US High Commissioner McCloy in Bonn reports that the Allied 
High Commission has agreed upon a. letter, still to be cleared in 
Paris and London, rejecting Chancellor Adenauer's request for� 
a Federal police force. The letter, however, does give approval 
to the establishment in the Laender of a mobile police force, sub-
ject to the supervision of the Federal Government to assure uniform 
training and equipment. This mobile force, which cannot exceed� 
10,000 men, may be(a) quartered in barracks; (b) specially trained 
and equipped; and (c) recruited at large or transferred from the ex-
isting Laender police forces. The High Commission believes that 
the Federal Government must have the power to call out and control 
these mobile police forces for the duration of any emergency. The 
letter concludes by inviting the Federal Government to discuss the 
establishment of the proposed mobile force informally with the High 
Commission.

1. Situation Quiet as North Koreans build-up supplies�Relative 
quiet has prevailed on the Korean front following the fall of 
Taejon to North Korean forces. The principal change in the 
front on 21 July was the five-to-ten-mile withdrawal of the 
Southern First Corps, located northeast of Taejon. (The US 
Twenty-Fifth Division is to replace the Southern First Corps.) 
In the central sector, North Korean forces appeared to be 
continuing a build-up of supplies. At the same time, elements 
of the US First Cavalry Division are now moving forward 
southeast of Taejon to relieve the US Twenty-Fourth Divi-
sion. On the east mast, South Korean troops improved their 
position north of Yongdok. Air operations have been limited 
by bad weather during the past 24 hours; the North Korean 
air force was not in action. Allied carrier aircraft have made 
a strike on North Korea from the Yellow Sea.

1. Taejon falls--US troops dig in to south�Northern Korean forces 
have taken Taejon following a sustained infantry attack heavily 
supported by tanks and artillery and US troops are now dug in 
along a defensive ridge south of the city. Enemy troops moving 
unopposed south and west of Taejon_ have been observed below 
Chonju on the road to Namwon and appear to be driving for the 
southwest coastal cities of Yosu and Mokpo, in an effort to 
secure the entire southwest area of Korea. Northern troops 
could move from this area toward Pusan along the southern 
coast roads. There was no activity on the southern Korean-
held right flank of the US position near Taejon, but Northern 
forces suffered local reverses both in the central corridor area 
and on the east coast. Despite the reported destruction of large 
numbers of North Korean aircraft on the ground by carrier air 
strikes this week, Northern planes were in action over southern 
Korea during the past 24 hours. A formation of US B-29's was 
-attacked over Seoul; two Yaks were destroyed over Taejon after

3. US aid to Iran., South Asia favored--US Ambassador Grady 
in Tehran, in discussing the advantages of extending the pre-
sent US foreign aid program, expresses the opinion that US 
aid would be highly useful to Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, 
and India, not only for its material effects but even more 
for the increased confidence it would give countries which 
"are clearly in a precarious position" and feel that US aid 
has "skipped over them." In the case of Iran, Grady asserts 
that a grant program, involving first year capital expenditures 
of up to $50 million, is "almost essential" to cover projected 
health, sanitation, and agricultural projects which might not 
meet Export-Import Bank loan standards and to provide addi-
tional technical assistance. Grady adds, however, that US 
aid "can be fruitless if we are over-generous" and that 
loans rather than grants should be used whenever possible. 
Grady cites Pakistan as a country in which maximum use 
should be made of the loan principle and expresses "serious 
doubts" about the advisability of making any outright grants 
to India.

4. YUGOSLAVIA: View on US military aid--US Ambassador 
Allen reports from Belgrade that the Yugoslav Deputy Foreign 
Minister has stated that although his government might be 
expected to request arms of the West in present circumstances, 
it would be unwise for Yugoslavia to do so. The Deputy For
Minister added that it would be wiser to obtain the arms 
from other sources because a request for arms from the 
West would create difficulties for both and "could be taken 
by the USSR as direct provocation and as ,a pretext for mili-
tary action." The Yugoslav official also pointed out that 
Yugoslavia's efforts to build up its own defenses necessarily 
increased its dependence on foreign economic aid, a situation 
which he feels "the US had failed to take fully into considera-

5.-GREECE: Deputy Premier says new government likely--
Deputy Prime Minister Papandreou has informed US Embassy 
Athens he regards the present Cabinet as inadequate for the 
needs of the hour and no longer capable of surviving. Assert-

and fellow travellers has destroyed confidence in his leadership, 
Papandreou expressed the belief the only solution would be for 
Plastiras to resign, meanwhile pledging support to a reshuffled 
centrist government until such time as new elections would be 
"appropriate." Papandreou believes it would probably be 
most expedient for him to assume the premiership himself tem-
porarily, with Liberal leader Venizelos later assuming the post. 
The Embassy considers the establishment of a new government 
under Marshal Papagos to be the most likely consequence of 
Plasiiras' fall.

the present Cabinet, its early fall appears inevitable. CIA 
doubts, however, that Papandreou's hopes of establishing a 
new centrist government can be realized. CIA agrees with

emerge, although the possibility exists that political senti-
ment may crystallize in favor of the appointment of some 
neutral figure such as ex-Premier Diomedes to head a care-
taker government empowered to take extraordinary measures

1. Possession of Taejon in balance--North Korean tank-infantry 
teams have penetrated the outskirts of Taejon where the situa-
tion continues to be fluid. Early official reports indicate con-
siderable success for US anti-tank weapons in this engagement. 
The area held by the Southern First Corps immediately east of 
the US position at Taejon has remained relatively quiet. Further 
to the east, the invaders are continuing to press down the central 
corridors leading to Kumchon and Taegu and brisk action is 
taking place on the east coast in the vicinity of Yonga4 Although, 
poor weather restricted air operations somewhat du`41ns the past

� 
two damaged on the ground, two gunboats strafed and damaged, 
five tank-cars burned, four locomotives destroyed, and a large 
chemical plant set on fire. The attacking aircraft found the Wornsam 
oil refinery still burning from the previous day's raid. 
The United Nations Commission on Korea (UNCOK), currently 
located in the southern port city of Pusan, has decided that under 
present circumstances the mission of UNCOK observers should be 
expanded. The number of observers will be increased and the Com-
mission's expanded duties will include the investigation of atrocity 
stories to prepare factual reports to the UN. Other UNCOK respon-
sibilities include gathering information from refugees and other 
sources to provide social and political guidance for the future and 
duties relating to "the eventual withdrawal" of the invading forces.

The first, which Zehnder feels is not supported by currently 
available evidence, is that the USSR will endeavor to create 
difficulties for the US on a number of fronts while keeping 
out of any direct involvement, in the hope of weakening the 
US by dispersing its forces. Zehnder, a specialist on the 
USSR, favors the alternative view that there will be no 
further Communist aggression while the Korean hostilities 
continue; he also believes the Kremlin desires to avoid a 
global war. In support of this view, Zehnder argues that it 
is contrary to the Russian temperament and history to be-
come involved, even indirectly, on a number of fronts; he 
maintains that the Russian always avoids a dispersal of forces 
and thinks militarily and politically in terms of concentrated 
mass effort. Zehnder reported there was some evidence in 
recent Russian-language broadcasts indicating the Soviet public. 
is being prepared for a government move to reestablish peace 
in Korea or for the eventual failure of the Communist venture 
there. Zehnder added that the Swiss Government and public 
generally welcomed the speed and determination with which 
the US had met the Korean crisis.

from North Korean positions near the outskirts of the former 
provisional capital of South Korea. Considerable enemy move-
ment in the vital central Korean corridors� leading to the south 
took place during the past 24 hours, and US aerial observers 
report a continuing build-up of enemy tanks, trucks, and troops, 
Which may indicate preparations for an all-out attack against 
the main rail line at Kumchon and Taegu. The rich rice area 
of southwest Korea is virtually undefended, and other invading 
forces advancing to the west of Taejon may attempt to secure 
this region for North Korea. On the east coast, the US 1st 
Cavalry Division has completed disembarking at Pohang and is 
already several miles inland; carrier aircraft from the landing 
support force struck hard at airfields and installations north 
of the 38th Parallel. 
Past failure of the Republic of Korea to win the support 
of its restless student class may lie behind reports that over 
50 percent of Seoul's students are actively aiding the Corn-
mivlist invaders, with many voluntarily enlisting in the Northern 
Army.. Among other elements of Seoul's population, the working

be kept from "yielding ultimately and perhaps rapidly, to the

have made the French feel more defenseless than ever, and if 
US reverses continue, there is a danger that France will be-
come convinced that the US would be incapable of repelling an 
invasion of France or its neighbors. The Ambassador points 
out that for months the "neutralists" in France have been 
spreading the doctrine that, because the US is powerless to 
protect Western Europe and France cannot avoid destruction 
in the event of war, France should not support the NAT and 
the MDAP, which create the illusion of security. Bruce ob-

vigorously to radical measures designed to transform paper 
security into reality.

have made the French feel more defenseless than ever, and if 
US reverses continue, there is a danger that France will be-
come convinced that the US would be incapable of repelling an 
invasion of France 'or its neighbors. The Ambassador points 
out that for months the "neutralists" in France have been 
spreading the doctrine that, because the US is powerless to 
protect Western Europe and France cannot avoid destruction 
in the event of war, France should not support the�NAT and 
the MDAP, which create the illusion of security. Bruce ob-

Iiidans, Afghans seek US-UK action in Pathan dispute--US 
Ambassador Henderson in New Delhi reports that both the 
Afghan Ambassador and the Indian Government have called 
upon him to emphasize the gravity of Afghan feelings over 
the Pathan tribal situation and to urge that the US and UK 
prevail upon Pakistan to negotiate the problem with Afghani-
stan. The Afghan Ambassador recently informed Henderson 
�that Afghan feeling over Pakistan's "repressive" treatment 
of its Pathan tribesmen was such that further incidents in the 
tribal area might lead to an uncontrollable incursion of 
Afghan tribesmen across the Pakistan border and possibly 
to actual Afghan armed intervention. Later, Secretary Gen-
eral Bajpai of the Indian External Affairs Ministry made a 
similar request for US-UK intervention, arguing that an 
outbreak of Afghan-Pakistan hostilities would present the 
USSR with "just the kind of opportunity" it was looking for.

Bajpai asserted that India was trying to restrain Afghanistan 
but added that the Afghans were convinced that their interest 
in the tribesmen was legitimate and that they would not be 
deterred by anything the UN might do. In reply to Henderson's 
observation that Pakistan had agreed to discuss the matter if 
Afghanistan recognized that the tribal territory was an integral 
part of Pakistan, Bajpai stated that he hoped the two countries 
could be persuaded to negotiate without prior conditions. 
(CIA Comment: These parallel representations appear 
to be an Indian-encouraged attempt by Afghanistan to force 
concessions from Pakistan by capitalizing on US concern over 
the stability of the area. Although Afghan public opinion is 
undoubtedly exercised over the Pathan problem, there are 
no indications that feeling has reached the pitch described 
by the Afghan Ambassador. India, which has shown signs of 
encouraging Afghanistan vis-a-vis Pakistan in the past, may 
well be motivated in this instance by a desire to thwatt 
Pakistan's plans, to send troops to Korea.)

cri5ssed the Kum river in force and despite heavy losses are 
now driving against outnumbered US troops into the outskirts 
of Taejon from the west. Immediately to the east of Taejon, 
a heavy infiltration of enemy troops on the US right flank 
threatens to drive a salient between US troops and the South-

South Korean troops repulsed an enemy attack north of 
Hamchang but were driven from Yongju, at the head of a�

5/5 2. SPAIN: Reaction to world situation following Korean outbreak--
US Charge Culbertson in Madrid estimates that Franco feels 
that recent events in Korea have sharpened the lines between 
the West and the USSR, thus strengthening his position and the 
international position of Spain. Culbertson discounts the possi-
bility that Franco could "carry the Spanish Government" into 
a fundamental change of Spain's present policy toward the USSR; 
he points out that there is more evidence indicating Franco may 
be considering altering Spain's present policy toward the US. 
On balance, however, Culbertson concludes that present evidence 
probably indicates that Franco will only withdraw-deeper into. 
the isolation which has been Spain's role in Europe during the 
20th century. Increased Spanish isolation, Culbertson feels, 
would raise the cost of inducing Franco to make common cause 
with the West. Culbertson postscripts that, although Spaniards 
would certainly resist aggression and welcome foreign assist-
fl in case of attack, the government does not now appear 
interested in assuming the responsibilities of an ally in general 
defense of Western Europe.

Ambassadbr Warren in Karachi reports that Pakistan is

about the effect of such a commitment on Pakistan's own 
defenses. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sir Mohammed Zafrulla 
Khan told Warren that he and Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan 
were convinced that Pakistan was "already committed" in the 
event of further aggression or general war; both were deter-
mined to do what they could, and were confident that they could. 
obtain popular support for the use of Pakistani troops in Korea. 
Zafrulla requested US "advice" regarding Pakistan's defenses, 
pointing out that providing troops to the UN would leave Pakistan

unable to fight even a delaying action against a Soviet attack 
through the Kyber or Cha.uman passes and would also weaken

might achieve through an offer of troops, would, before com-

1. Pressure on US troops eased somewhat--During the period 
immediately following the withdrawal oi-US troops south of 
the Kum river, the invading forces opposite the US positions 
have confined themselves to probing action in considerable 
strength along the Kum river and reorganization of Northern 
units in rear areas. To the east, North Korean troops have 
already crossed the Pogang river and may soon force the 
South Korean First Corps to evacuate the important defense 
center of Chongju. Further to the east, invading forces con-
tinue their slow advance through difficult terrain toward the 
open corridors leading south to Kumchon and Taegu. During 
the past 24 hours, US and Australian air strikes knocked out 
9 enemy tanks and more than 50 vehicles; other air operations 
struck at the invader's lengthening lines of communication. 
US naval units along the Korean east coast bombarded roads, 
troop concentrations, railway yards and oil tanks in enemy 
" controlled territory south of the 38th parallel. 
Foreign diplomats and UN representatives in Korea 
have been notified that the South Korean Government is 
moving its provisional capital to Taegu, 60 miles northwest 
of the important port of Pusan. US Embassy personnel are 
moving to the new Southern capital. Dr. Chough Pyungok, 
a South Korean leader who just returned from a trip " 
through Southern-held territory, reports that the people re-
main calm and strong in their support of the Republic of 
Korea. As an example of the people's loyalty, they are offer-
ing to sell the Government their rice and other farm products 
at prices lower than those available in the open market. In

US Ambassador Allen reports from Belgrade that, although

subject p.nd "on balance" does not believe an attack is 
imminent. The Yugoslav Government considers the current 
rumors to be part of the-Soviet war-of-nerves, a view in 
which the Military Attache in Belgrade concurs. Allen adds 
that the Yugoslav Government, though not worried, is closely 
watching the situation and that recent Yugoslav press releases 
on hostile Satellite activities were made for their propaganda 
value in attempting to discredit the current Soviet 'peace 
campaign" propaganda.

movements in the Balkans are considered to be part of an

against Yugoslavia must be regarded as a continuing possibility.)

1. North Koreans breach Kum river line--North Korean forces 
are pressing their attack along the 90-mile front running 
from Kongju on the Kum river, where US troops have been 
forced to fall back, east to the ea of Tanyang. After a 
brief reconnaissance of suitable crossing sites and two un-
successful attempts to cross during daylight hours, the North 
Koreans forded the Kum river below Kongju under cover of 
darkness and overran a US artillery battalion position. US 
forces in the immediate area are withdrawing in the direction 
of Taejon, while other US troops continue to hold the Kum 
river line east of Konju. Farther to the east, however, the 
invading forces have advanced 9 miles south of Chongju and 
increased the threat of an encirclement of Taejon. In the 
course of air operations, two YAK fighters on the newly-
repaired Kimpo airstrip were reportedly destroyed, and one 
US B-26 was severely damaged by Northern fighters. 
North Korean radio broadcasts continue to present 
speeches attributed to US prisoners criticizing US action in 
Korea. US prisoners making such statements are unques-
tionably under coercion; typical quote. . . "it is the belief of 
this group of prisoners that. ethe Korean people 5hould7 
be permitted to evolve their own international protilenris. 
Other North Korean broadcasts strongly deny that US prison-
ers have been murdered and claim that the "People's Repub-
lic" is treating captured Americans in accordance with 
international law. Meanwhile, there are indications that 
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, may become the seat 
of a government of a "Japanese People's Provisional Repub-
lic" staffed by Japanese Communist leaders. Seven Central 
Committeemen of the Japan Communist Party, who were re-
5.4cently "purged" by SCAP, have escaped police surveillance

2. Chinese Communist vessels in Hong Kong--US Consulate 
General Hong Kong has expressed concern to the Govern-
ment of Hong Kong lest six small merchant vessels there 
(on which the US holds mortgages but which are under 
Chinese Communist control) be moved to Chinese mainland 
ports. The Consulate General has asked the Hong Kong Gov-
ernment to cooperate in preventing the departure of the ex-
Nationalist ships. 
(CIA Comment: The movement of these vessels 
seaward from Hong Kong would involve some risk of seizure 
by Nationalist warships still maintaining a limited "blockade" 
of the Chinese mainland, and the Chinese Communists are not 
likely to take such a risk at this time simply to supplement 
their limited ocean-going merchant fleet. However, the six 
vessels are modern and fast, and although they would only 
slightly increase the Chinese Communists' total military 
capacity for any assault on Taiwan, they could be of some 
specialized value in such an operation. If the ex-Nationalist 
ships attempt to leave Hong Kong, the Crown Colony Govern-
ment almost certainly will not take restraining action without 
direct orders from London similar to those recently issued 
detaining the disputed aircraft at Hong Kong.)

1. North Korean forces continue to exert heavy pressure--
North Korean forces are continuing to press forward south 
of Chonan toward Taejon and US units have now withdrawn , 
to positions south of the Kum river. Movements of North 
Korean forces west of Chonan indicate the invaders may 
attempt to flank the Kum river line from the west; other 
North Korean forces being held in reserve are in position 
to exploit any Northern breakthrough to the east between 
the US right flank and the South Korean First Corp left 
flank. Repeated enemy probing action against the positions 
of the Southern 6th and 8th divisions in the Chungju-Tanyang 
area maintains the threat to the corridor leading to Kumchon. 
No substantial developments have been reported from the 
east coast. North Korean planes reappeared, with one US 
B-29 and one observation plane being shot down during the 
past 24 hours. 
ECA observers in Korea report that no food shortages 
exist in areas now under South Korean control, and none are

the Han river bridges during the early days of the invasion 
prevented a mass movement to the south and in general 
minimized the refugee problem.

1. North Koreans force defenders to fall back�The superiority 
of the North Korean forces in both numbers and equipment 
is forcing the US and South Korean forces to withdraw in the 
face of concentrated artillery, tank and infantry attacks. 
The two or three North Korean divisions attacking the four 
US battalions deployed in the Kongju-Chochiwon area will 
probably force the defenders to fall back to defense positions 
along the Kum river. 
The prospects for political stability in the areas 
under control of South Korean and US forces have not changed 
appreciably during the past 24 hours. Reports from Southern 
areas now occupied by the invading forces confirm earlier 
rumors that recruiting for military service is now in progress 
in Seoul. The North Koreans have also instituted a compulsory 
labor draft, possibly to meet emergency transport needs aris-
ing from recent damage to transport facilities from US air 
strikes. Food is reportedly becoming scarce in Seoul and the 
"People's Committee" there began taking a strict census, 
apparently to identify all families and relatives of personnel 
in the South Korean armed forces, police and government.

declarations regarding Taiwan by Chinese Foreign Minister 
Chou En-lai; (4) a reported journey to Moscow by Mao Tse-tung

I. Northern forces advancing steadily--The pattern of the 
movement of North Korean forces, which have pushed 
forward steadily during the past 24 hours against in-
creasing resistance from la atc:and groUndlorces, indicates 
that the invaders are preparing to launch a two-pronged

Chochiwon which will than place them in, a:progition to curve 
toward Taejon from the west; invading forces in the Umsong-
Chungju area are preparing to outflank Taejon from the east 
and North Korean elements may attempt to cut communications 
between Taejon and Taegu. The reorganized Southern First 
Corps, faced with heavy pressure from invading forces in the 
Umsong-Chinchon area, withdrew east and south to new positions. 
Increased activity by Northern forces was reported along the 
east coast. 
�US Ambassador Muccio reports that President Rhee, who 
Is Atheerful, composed and resolute," has agreed to remain in 
Taegu for the time being. Rhee feels strongly that for morale 
reasons there should be no formal transfer of the Cabinet to 
Taegu, but he has agreed that the National Assembly Emergency 
Council should assemble in Taegu. The number and actiinity-
