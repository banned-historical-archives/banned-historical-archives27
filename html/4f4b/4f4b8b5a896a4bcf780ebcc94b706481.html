 Secret
 China: The Politics
 of Hu Yaobano
 Key Judgments   General Secretary Hu Yaobang, 67, has taken great strides toward
 Information available consolidating his power since becoming head of the Chinese Communist
 as of 28 January 1983 Party in June 1981. His associates now hold key posts in most of the party's
 was used in this report.                                                                   F-25X1
 sensitive organs and occupy important government positions as well.
 Hu is far from secure, however. He did not earn the top party post as much
 as he had it handed to him by his mentor, Deng Xiaoping, over the
 objections of senior leaders. Many influential Chinese do not regard Hu as
 a leader in his own right but merely as Deng's protege
 Hu has Deng's complete confidence-although they do not agree on
 everything-but we believe Hu's relations with other senior leaders are
 strained. Politburo member Ye Jianying in particular appears to us to have
 reservations about Hu. Hu has attempted to court the party elders, but we
 believe none of them, regardless of their personal feelings about Hu, would
 feel compelled to defer to him in Deng's absence
 senior military officers distrust Hu.
 They believe he is too critical of Mao and the army's role in the Cultural
 Revolution, and they believe he lacks the stature and experience to lead the
 nation. Military men also see threats to their prerogatives and political
 power in the political and economic reforms that Hu champions.
 At the top of Hu's political agenda is the party purge scheduled to begin
 later this year and run through 1986. One key goal for Hu will be to re-
 move as many opponents as possible, but Hu also sees the purge as a way to
 revitalize the party and restore respect for it as an institution. Hu was
 alarmed by events in Poland, and he believes the party must be cleansed of
 the corrupt and incompetent to avoid a similar situation in China. Thus,
 Hu advocates:
 ? A reduced role for the party in policy implementation.
 ? A larger role for intellectuals and technocrats.
 ? Less social regimentation and a somewhat freer artistic climate.
 ? More popular participation in local decisionmaking
 In our judgment, Hu is not a key economic policymaker. He seems to have
 a relatively unsophisticated understanding of economics and the complex-
 ity of the problems facing China. Hu generally supports the economic
 reform program and has been an active supporter of increased foreign
 investment in China.

 We believe Hu has had relatively little influence in foreign policy matters
 until recently, but he is clearly expanding his role. Hu has very little first-
 hand knowledge of the world beyond China's borders, and he appears to
 have a very limited understanding of the Western democracies or apprecia-

 publicly.
 he:
 e tensions with Moscow, but still sees the Soviet
 Union as the greatest threat to China's security.
 ? Tends to identify China's interests with those of the Third World.
 Hu's test will come when Deng passes from the scene. Hu brings some con-
 siderable strengths-including a headstart and Deng's support-to the
 contest for influence that will follow. He is a very tough, clever, pragmatic
 politician who has demonstrated that he can not only survive in the rough-
 and-turnhle wnrld of ch;nese politics, but thrive.
 Hu is a man used to exercising power in the
 shadows and not someone to cross.
 Hu's post-Deng prospects will improve if:
 ? Party elders like Ye die.
 ? Hu can increase his influence in the military by gaining a seat on the par-
 ty body that sets military policy, advancing the careers of his supporters
 in the military, and forcing retirements in the senior officer corps.
 ? Hu continues to place associates in the party and government bureaucra-
 cies, especially the party's Organization Department, the internal securi-
 ty apparatus, and the economic planning organs
 Hu must also follow Deng's example and learn to court and placate his op-
 ponents. Hu's hard-driving personality, a strength in many ways, also
 makes him prone, in our judgment, to overreacting when the situation calls
 for a deft touch, and he could easily alienate friends as well as critics

 China: The Politics
 of Hu Yaobang
 Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew, after
 meeting General Secretary Hu Yaobang, summed
 him up-accurately, we believe-as a man "used to
 exercising power in the shadows" and not someone to
 cross. Hu, 67, is a very tough, clever politician who
 during the Cultural Revolution faced a Red Guard
 mob with icy contempt. His enemies have purged him
 twice in his 50-year party career, and each time Hu
 has come back to settle scores. Like his mentor, Deng
 Xiaoping, Hu is willing to sacrifice policy and allies to
 achieve larger ends, and in China's rough-and-tumble
 politics he has shown himself to be not only a survivor,
 but someone who thrives.'
 Hu's current standing in the party is something of a
 conundrum. He holds the top party post, but he does
 not wield the authority that goes with it; Deng is still
 the most powerful man in China. Furthermore, be-
 cause Hu did not earn the top position as much as he
 had it handed to him by Deng over the objections of
 other senior leaders, he is in a race to consolidate his
 position before Deng passes from the scene.
 Increasing his personal power is Hu's primary con-
 cern, but he is also committed to carrying out an
 ambitious political and economic reform program
 designed to cleanse the party and raise living stand-
 ards. We believe Hu, who has concentrated on domes-
 tic affairs throughout his career, has yet to put his
 mark on foreign policy
 Hu's Power Base
 Recent appointments, dismissals,
 behind-the-scenes maneuvering all indicate
 to us that Hu is moving quickly to place men loyal to
 him in key positions.' These events also suggest to us
 that Hu is following a master plan and has a pool of
 loyal supporters to draw on, essential preconditions
 for success.

 analytical chronology of Hu's career.

 The core of Hu's personal power network is a group of
 former officials of the Communist Youth League
 (CYL) who served under Hu in the 1952-66 period.
 We can identify 60 former CYL officials serving in
 major government and party positions; most received
 their assignments under circumstances that suggest to
 us Hu was instrumental in placing them. Hu also has
 taken a very active role in rehabilitating hundreds of
 officials purged during the Cultural Revolution.
 Many are deceased or too aged to play an active role,
 but their former associates, whose careers stand to  25X1
 benefit from the restoration of their mentor's' reputa-
 tion, may feel beholden to Hu.
 Hu's closest asso-
 ciates are Hu Qili, Hu Keshi, Li Chang, Wang
 Zhongfang, and Xiang Nan. Hu Qili, perhaps Hu's
 principal ally, is a recent appointee to the party
 Secretariat and head of the party's General Office, 25X1
 which controls the party paper flow and is active in
 preparing the purge that will begin this summer.
 Xiang is now the Fujian provincial party boss,

 Figure 1. Hu meeting a Tibetan woman during a visit to Xizang
 (Tibet) in May 1980. Hu has traveled extensively in China during
 the last few years, campaigning for support from local officials and
 Hu Keshi, Li, and Wang are key figures in the
 Chinese Academies of Science and Social Science,
 which often serve as think tanks for Hu and Deng.
 We believe Hu is well on his way to establishing a
 solid grip on the party bureaucracy. He has chaired
 twp of the most sensitive departments himself, Orga-
 nization (1977-78) and Propaganda (1979-80), and
 associates now head nearly all the important ones.
 Exceptions are the Organization Department, led by
 Deng ally Song Renqiong, and the critical Military
 Commission, which sets military policy and oversees
 the political loyalty of the army. It is chaired by
 Hu's influence in the government and provinces is
 weaker than in the party, but he has a core of loyalists
 in those areas too. Soviet China-watchers have told
 diplomats in Beijing that approximately 20 officials at
 the vice minister rank or above have ties to Hu,
 generally through the CYL. In our opinion, Hu has
 relatively few associates in the economic ministries or
 on the planning commissions, fields dominated by
 Politburo members Chen Yuri, Li Xiannian, and
 Premier Zhao Ziyang. Appointments in the Foreign
 Ministry last year, especially Wu Xueqian as Minis-
 ter, indicate to us that expanding his influence in the
 foreign policy bureaucracy is a high priority for Hu.
 Hu had relatively little experience with foreign affairs
 before heading the party, and he wants his people in
 control of this vital policy arena

 Secret
 Hu Yaobang in Person
 Hu Yaobang's close relationship with Deng Xiaoping
 over the years has earned him the sobriquet of
 "Deng 's man. " Foreign diplomats have noted Hu's
 similarity to Deng in style and mannerisms. This may
 equally well reflect conscious or unconscious imita-
 tion of Deng, habits acquired over their many years of
 close association, or Deng 's choice of Hu as his
 protege because of their similarity in personality.=
 In meetings with Hu Yaobang, Western observers
 have been impressed with his intelligence, dynamism,
 self-confidence, and frankness.. Hu also projects an
 image of himself as "a man of the people. " On one
 occasion with a group of foreigners, he noted that he
 was just a "country bumpkin. " He prefers to dress
 informally and has been known to punctuate his
 speech with earthy expressions in heavily Hunanese-
 accented Chinese. His energy and direct manner have
 led these same Western observers to compare him
 favorably with the more reserved Premier Zhao
 Ziyang or Hu's predecessor, Hua Guofeng.
 Probably reflecting his long years in propaganda
 work, Hu Yaobang has a proselytizing speaking style.
 His speaking style is animated and uses gestures-
 especially pointing his finger. Hu's extensive use of
 rhetorical questions and practical examples in his
 speeches also reflects his propaganda background.
 We believe that the favorable opinion of Westerners
 who have met Hu stands in sharp contrast to the
 more mixed view of him expressed by Chinese.
 Although some Chinese are drawn to his "man of the
 people" style, the very qualities that ingratiate Hu to
 foreign statesmen, his energy and frankness, are not
 traits generally associated with leaders in China,
 where reserve and aloofness are prized. Deng Xiao-
 ping, also known for his energy and candor, is an
 exception. Hu's animated style suggests a lack of
 refinement to many Chinese. Hu's nationally tele-
 vised address to the Sixth Plenum in July 1981, when
 he rose from his seat repeatedly and pushed his voice
 close to its limits
 Hu's self-effacing remarks
 at the Plenum, an effort to show respect to party
 elders opposed to his promotion, apparently were seen
 in some quarters as a sign of weakness

 :25X6
 25X1 I
 An Image Problem. Hu is also attempting to improve
 his image as a leader. We believe many Chinese have
 a negative impression of Hu. They do not see him as a
 national figure in his own right but merely as Deng's
 "go for." For example, sophisticated residents of
 Guangzhou who strongly support Deng are far less
 enthusiastic about Hu in comments to US officials.
 They dismiss him as an unimportant figure who."is
 incapable of leadership." Hu's personal style has also
 contributed to his image problems. (See box "Hu
 Yaobang in Person.")
 We believe Deng has assumed a less public role in
 part to vacate the stage for Hu. Since becoming head
 of the party in 1981, Hu has maintained a busy public.
 schedule that tends to contrast his relative youth and
 vigor with the fraility of the party elders. Hu has
 toured the provinces dispensing instructions and inves-
 tigating grievances with great fanfare. Despite injunc-
 tions on personality cults, the party press increasingly
 contains references to the authority of his statements.
 National television protrays Hu as a world leader who
 receives the respect of foreign visitors. In our view,
 however, such public relations efforts have made little
 impression on cynical Chinese, who continue to see
 Deng as the real leader of China

 Relations With Key Political Players
 Deng and the Party Elders. The ups and downs of
 Hu's career closely parallel Deng's. Hu clearly has
 Deng's complete confidence.
 Deng has entrusted Hu with numerous
 sensitive political missions over the years
 Despite their closeness, Hu and Deng apparently do
 not agree
 Den is more conservative
 Hu is also more skeptical of the
 United States and warmer toward the Third World
 than Deng. Their differences, however, are clearly at
 the margins of most issues and generally seem to be
 matters of tone and emphasis rather than substance.
 Hu is willing to buck
 Hu has stated repeatedly and with apparent
 sincerity that Deng is still "the helmsman" and that
 Deng makes the hard decisions on major issues
 We believe Hu's relations with some top leaders are

 Peng also was responsible for the internal security

 senior mili-

 Hu's position as party head entitled him to the
 chairmanship. Some officers even prefer abolishing

 experience. Hu is regarded as too liberal on cultural
 and social issues by many, and Hu's outspoken and
 frequent criticism of Mao, who is still revered in
 military circles, has alienated military men. There
 seems to be a belief in the People's Liberation Army
 (PLA) that Hu does not understand or appreciate the
 army's needs and that, once Ye and Deng pass from
 the scene, the military will be without a sympathetic

 Both Hu and Deng have expended considerable ener-

 made fewer public appearances in part to build Hu's
 image as a leader, and Hu in his frequent addresses to
 military audiences has tried hard to assuage their
 concerns about the impact of the reform program and
 the party's criticism of Mao. Under pressure Hu has

 Intellectuals. The intellectual and artistic communi-
 ties are Hu's most ardent supporters. Hu has argued
 in the leadership for relaxing controls on the arts and
 for giving intellectuals a leading role in the modern-
 ization program. He has also defended intellectuals
 from more conservative elements, particularly the
 military, who are angered by their criticism of Mao,
 the PLA, and socialism. Although Hu has taken a
 harder line on cultural issues lately, many intellectu-
 als profess. to understand the political necessity and
 claim not to harbor ill will toward Hu,
 The intellectual community is not a political force in
 China, but it has performed valuable services for Hu.
 He has used their talents to criticize and discredit the
 views of opponents, including Hua and the military.
 The intellectuals are also a source of policy expertise
 and advice in areas where Hu needs assistance, such
 as economic and technical issues.
 Policy Views
 Our knowledge of Hu's policy views is clouded by his
 tendency to tailor his remarks to his audience and the
 fact that most public statements in China reflect a
 general leadership view rather than personal opinion.
 Our records suggest to us, too, that until recently Hu
 has tended to be more of an executor of policy than a
 formulator
 Two facts, however, clearly emerge from Hu's speech-
 es and statements over the years: his primary concern
 is the health and well-being of the party, and he is
 most influential in the area of party policy and
 personnel. Hu speaks with the greatest passion when

 Despite a close personal identification with the party

 value of a policy by its results and, if need be, will use
 his considerable intellectual abilities and in-depth
 knowledge of Marxism to find an appropriate ideolog-
 ical justification. Hu's pragmatism has its bounds,
 however. Like other top leaders, he will not abide
 those who question the suitability of socialism for

 consequences will be very bad. People will listen to
 you if you act as you preach. This is the most
 important requirement for doing a good job in
 ideological and political work.9
 Hu's remedy-besides cleansing the party-is to im-
 plement the reform program. In speeches Hu has
 stressed especially:
 ? Strengthening the legal system.
 ? Promoting intellectuals and experts regardless. of
 class backgrounds to responsible positions, especial-
 ly in the economy.
 ? Reducing social controls including those on the arts.
 ? Allowing more popular participation in local
 decisionmakina.
 willing to tolerate more ferment in the system than
 other leaders. Hu's support for the "democracy wall
 movement" in 1979 bolsters this impression.
 Economic Views. Hu does not seem to be a key  .
 economic policymaker; Politburo members Chen Yun
 and Premier Zhao share that responsibility and we
 believe Hu defers to them. Moreover, we believe Hu
 may have a relatively unsophisticated understanding
 of economics and the complexity of the problems
 facing China. In our view, he has a tendency to see
 China's economic problems as essentially personnel
 problems; this is an important aspect of the situation
 but to emphasize it underestimates the primacy of
 institutional obstacles to growth. Reflecting his long
 years in propaganda and ideological work, he also
 seems to overestimate the value of propaganda cam-
 paigns and moral suasion as solutions to economic and
 other policy problems.
 Based on the relatively few statments we have, Hu's
 views on economic development strategy seem closer
 to Chen Yun's, a cautious supporter of the reform
 program, than Zhao's, one of the program's most
 enthusiastic advocates. Like other leaders Hu has
 endorsed the principle of giving managers more con-
 trol over their enterprises, but his speeches have a
 more orthodox Marxist tone and stress central plan-
 ning and limits on experimentation; Hu liberally
 quotes Chen on these issues. We believe Hu may also
 favor a somewhat faster rate of growth than other
 leaders. In a 1980 speech in which he bitterly at-
 tacked Hua, Hu stated Hua's advocacy of high
 economic targets and heavy industry, which other
 reformers were attacking, was not a major shortcom-,
 ing.
 Hu has strongly supported the Special Economic
 Zones, four small areas on China's coast where
 extensive foreign investment is encouraged. During a
 recent inspection tour of the provinces, Hu attempted
 to reassure nervous cadre that.the psuedocapitalistic
 zones have the support of the leadership and that
 cadre who enforce controversial economic policies
 today will not suffer politically tomorrow. He also
 stated that China's open door to the world will
 continue-media warnings about a dangerous influx
 of bourgeois influences notwithstanding-and encour-
 aged local officials to expand their foreign trade
 We should promote a new cooperative economy by
 encouraging the peasants to pool their money
 together to start their own undertakings, be share-
 holders of their own businesses, manage their
 businesses democratically, and determine the
 amounts of their bonuses.1?
 a public letter to a provincial
 official last March indicate to us that Hu is more
 willing to reduce central control of agriculture than of
 industry. He favors giving greater authority over
 income, field management, and marketing to the
 peasant with the collective retaining only formal title
 to the land and Beijing a say in the mix of crops sown.
 Hu also endorses a system of private peddlers who
 would travel from village to village buying and selling
 excess production, a practice criticized as petty capi-
 talism and speculation in the past.

 Foreign Policy. Based on our review of Hu's career,
 we believe he has had little influence in foreign policy
 matters in the past; until his elevation to General
 Secretary he focused almost entirely on domestic
 politics. Hu has downplayed his role in foreign affairs
 during conversations with visitors-he has always
 stuck close to the official line in such meetings-
 makes  ee major decisions, and he continues to have
 Deng still
 the sensitive, substantive conversations with visitors.
 We believe Hu fully expects to assume Deng's role,
 however, and he clearly is expanding his influence in
 foreign affairs. He is seeing more foreigners and
 placing associates in the foreign policy bureaucracy.
 Hu is particularly well represented in the party's
 United Front Work Department and International
 Liaison Department, which suggests to us Hu is
 particularly interested in such issues as the status of
 Hong Kong and Taiwan and party-to-party relations.
 Hu has almost no firsthand knowledge of the world
 beyond China's borders. He visited Romania, Alba-
 nia, and the Soviet Union briefly in the 1950s and the
 early 1960s, Kampuchea in 1978, and North Korea in
 1982. To our knowledge he has never traveled in a
 non-Communist country, and until last year he met
 very few foreigners who were not Marxists or Social-
 ists. Given his concentration on internal politics
 throughout his career, Hu's understanding of the
 Western democracies would appear to be very limited.
 As far as we know, Hu speaks no foreign language.F-
 Elements of the traditional ethnocentric Chinese view
 of the world are evident in Hu's speeches and com-
 ments. A tone of moral superiority comes through
 Hu's pronouncements, as when he told one party
 gathering that China's international relations are
 distinguished by a high degree of integrity. Like his
 19th century forebearers, Hu is very interested in
 acquiring Western know-how but is concerned about
 the cultural attitudes and "bourgeois" values that
 might accompany it. Hu reminded a group of writers
 in 1980 that, although foreigners have skills China
 needs, they are not comrades and must not be treated
 as Chinese.
 Hu strikes us as poorly informed about how advanced
 much of the world is compared with China, which is
 not surprising given his limited travel and contacts
 with foreigners.
 At the Ambas-
 sador's conference last summer, Hu stated that mo-
 rale in embassies would improve if officials traveled
 more in their host country; they would then appreciate
 the quality of life in China. As is the case in other
 policy areas, better ideological education is Hu's
 standard prescription for combating the appeal of
 Western lifestyles.
 Analysis of Hu's conversations and speeches on for-
 eign relations suggest to us that he favors identifying
 China more closely with Third World interestsF-
 u differs with Deng on this issue, and
 Hu would also prefer a more passive foreign policy
 that would allow China to concentrate on domestic
 issues.
 Hu's views on relations with the United States are
 very much in keeping with his view of the world and
 limited exposure to the West.
 Hu is more skeptical of the
 relationship with the United States than Deng, and a

 Secret
 Hu is one of
 those taking a particularly hard line on US dealings
 with Taiwan. Caution is required, but the few private
 remarks Hu has made on the political relationship
 seem to support their assessments. In a speech to the
 Secretariat in 1981, Hu reportedly accused Washing-
 ton of paying attention to Beijing only when forced to,
 and,                                    Hu
 made a point of noting that friendly Sino-US relations
 are a fairly recent development and the exception to
 the rule. The 1981 speech did acknowledge the strate-
 gic importance of the United States in dealing with
 the Soviet threat, however, and when discussing the
 economic relationship with US officials, Hu has ex-
 pressed interest in expanding trade and exchanges.
 Hu has kept to the party line when discussing Sino-
 and we believe he supports efforts to reduce tensions
 with the Soviet Union. The history of Sino-Soviet
 relations and his analysis of Poland's problems sug-
 gest to us that he is wary of moving too close or too
 quickly. We believe recent statements to the press by
 Hu that convey an impression of flexibility, including
 a willingness to restore party-to-party relations under
 the right circumstances, reflect a leadership position
 rather than Hu's personal view. The 1981 speech to
 the Secretariat, and other speeches since then, indi-
 cate to us that Hu has not changed his perception of
 the Soviet threat to China.
 The Task Before Hu
 A Succession Balance Sheet. Hu enters the succession
 sweepstakes with some significant advantages that
 seem to be increasing. He already has the top title,
 General Secretary of the party, and he enjoys the
 trust of the most influential man in China, Deng.
 Deng, moreover, has repeatedly demonstrated a will-
 ingness to expend his political capital to advance Hu's
 cause. Hu has begun building an impressive power
 base in the party, and he is in an excellent position to
 expand it during the upcoming purge.
 Many of the most frequently voiced objections to
 Hu-his relative youth, inexperience in military af-
 fairs, lack of national stature-apply with equal or
 greater force to most would-be rivals. Hu's headstart
 coupled with Deng's comparatively good health make
 it very difficult for a peer to challenge Hu
 These pluses are enhanced by Hu's considerable
 personal abilities. Chinese press reports, credible in
 light of the descriptions of those who have met Hu,
 present a picture of a man capable of working long
 hours to see that his ideas become reality. In an aging
 and infirm leadership, Hu may simply be able to
 outwork his opponents-particularly those among the
 party elders. A self-confident man steeled in the
 rough-and-tumble politics of the Cultural Revolution,
 Hu is a political competitor who will not passively
 accept defeat.
 Hu's weaknesses are more difficult to assess because
 they are more subjective. Some of his personal traits,
 for instance, could easily become liabilities. Hu's
 considerable drive produces behavior that may be
 viewed by others as impulsive and exceeding his
 authority. He injects himself into minor matters over
 which he does not have major responsibility, a pattern
 which may in the long run generate considerable
 resentment even among his political allies. He also has
 a tendency to speak rashly and to make snap judg-
 ments, which he later has to qualify or reverse.
 The seriousness of Hu's image problem is also hard to
 gauge. The temptation is to minimize it, but Hu is still
 a man who reached the top on Deng's coattails, not 25X1
 because he convinced the senior leadership of his
 ability. In our judgment, 18 months after reaching the
 top, Hu is not yet viewed as an independent leader.F_-]
 25X1
 25X1
 25X1

 25X1
 Hu needs a policy success, too, which would help his 25X1
 image problem. Unfortunately for him, policies he is
 closely identified with-the new minorities policy,"
 the easing of restrictions on the arts and dissent-are
 floundering or have been partially reversed or have
 generally. failed to yield the expected results. Increas-
 ingly, Hu has attempted to link his name with the
 successful agricultural reforms by appearing at fo-
 rums that tout their success. The agricultural reforms,
 however, are more closely identified with Zhao, who

 pioneered them in Sichuan Province, and it is unlikely
 that Hu will garner little more than reflected gloryF-
 In our judgment the largest question facing Hu is
 whether he can hold the reform coalition together-
 elders and peers. Like Hu, Deng has a reputation for
 abrasiveness and bullheadedness, but, after his return
 to power in 1978, Deng found the ability to compro-
 mise and to placate while patiently advancing his
 program. The immediate post-Deng period will be
 tense as elders and peers jockey for influence. Hu will
 have to court and placate and cajole other players-if
 he is to consolidate his power. Hu's impulsive, hard-
 charging style makes him prone, in our judgment, to
 overreact in a situation requiring a deft touch, and he
 could easily alienate friends as well as critics. Hu's
 chances for success will improve materially if he can
 learn from Deng.
 Bureaucractic Musts. Because of the progress he has
 made, Hu's survival is becoming less a question of
 how long Deng lives and more a question of Hu's
 ability to put a few more important pieces in place.
 Three broad areas stand out-the party elders, mili-
 tary, and party/government bureaucracy.
 Hu's progress in these three areas can be gauged in
 the months ahead by his success in accomplishing
 some specific tasks. To the degree that the following
 occurs, Hu increases his chances of surviving and
 prospering after Deng dies:
 ? Party elders die, but most especially Politburo mem-
 bers Ye, Chen, Li Xiannian, Li Desheng, Zhang
 Tingfa, Wei Guoqing, and Peng Zhen.
 ? Hu gains at least a seat on the Military Commis-
 sion, preferably its chairmanship.
 ? Yang Dezhi and Qin Jiwei increase their influence
 in the military.
 ? Xiang Nan, Hu's candidate, replaces Song Ren-
 qiong as head of the Organization Department.
 ? Hu's associates gain leadership positions in the
 Ministry of Public Security and the economic plan-
 ning bureaucracy, where Chen and Zhao are
 strongest.
 ? The party purge begins on time and succeeds in
 removing critics of the Deng-Hu program down to
 senior provincial levels.

 of the Communist Youth League in July.

 Hu returned to public life in March and Deng returned in July. The two men com-
 menced a long struggle to unseat party Chairman Hua Guofeng. Hu was elected to
 the 11th Central Committee and became head of the party's Organization
 Department. He was also Vice President of the Party School. These posts put him
 in a position to influence the removal of Gang of Four supporters from the party.
 Elevated to the Politburo at the Third Plenum of the 11th Congress in December.
 The Congress laid the ideological foundation for the reform program. Hu also
 became Third Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission. In November he
 led a Chinese delegation to Kampuchea.
 Hu became head of the party Propaganda Department in January and relin-
 quished control of the Organization Department. He also served as Secretary
 General of the Central Committee.
 At the Fifth Plenum of the 11th Congress in February, Hu was elevated to the Po-
 litburo Standing Committee. The Congress also reestablished the Secretariat,
 which Hu headed as General Secretary. The Secretariat began to evolve into the
 key organ responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the party. As Hu's political
 fortunes improved, Hua Guofeng's declined; four key supporters of Hua were
 dropped from the Politburo at the Plenum. Zhao Ziyang replaced Hua as Premier
 in September.
 Final blow for Hua came at Sixth Plenum in June when he was forced to resign as
 Chairman after 15 months of political maneuvering. Hu was named to replace
 him.
 The 12th Party Congress abolished the position of chairman and vice chairman of
 the party, leaving Hu atop the party structure as General Secretary. Hu began, to
 meet more foreign visitors and traveled to North Korea with Deng.
