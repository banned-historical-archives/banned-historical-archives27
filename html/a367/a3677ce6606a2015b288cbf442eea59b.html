Sino-Soviet Relations: The Summit and Beyond 
Summary 
General Secretary Gorbachev's visit to Beijing--15 to 18 May--will 
formally end the estrangement of the past three decades. For Beijing, the 
summit offers an unprecedented opportunity to reduce the near-term 
Soviet military threat and build up Chinese leverage in its relationship with 
the United States. For Moscow, the summit sends a signal to Washington 
that the Soviets have now achieved a more balanced position in the 
strategic triangle and will continue to use warming US-Soviet ties to prod 
China to be more cooperative. We believe Gorbachev views the summit 
as also advancing the Soviet goal of playing a significantly larger role in 
Asia and ju!  7:ifyin the proposed unilateral troop cuts along the 
Sino-Soviet frontier.

SECRET NOFORN N NTRACT ORCON 
While visiting Beijing, Gorbachev is likely to announce specifics on 
his proposed 200,000-man force reduction in the Soviet Far East, and he 
will press Beijing to respond. Beijing appears in no hurry to offer 
reciprocal reductions, and will probably opt to discuss potential 
confidence-building measures Instead. Gorbachev could also make a 
dramatic offer of unilateral cuts in the Soviet Pacific Fleet or propose 
some other arms control initiative to influence governments in 
non-Communist East Asia. Although we do not expect a border 
demarcation agreement to be ironed out before the summit, the Soviets 
may offer to relinquish the disputed islands opposite Khabarovsk If Beijing 
assures them of Chinese compromises on the western sector. An 
important achievement of the summit may be a joint communique 
establishing the foundation for a new relaZionship, but it may also contain 
dissenting Chinese and Soviet views on Cambodia. 
In the wake of the summit, we see the likelihood of some 
significant new areas of Sino-Soviet interaction, particularly in the 
military-industrial sphere. China is exploring Soviet alternatives to 
Western military hardware and technology, increasing the possibility that 
Chinese firms will provide Moscow with controlled Western technology. 
China is unlikely to risk its access to advanced Western technology by 
deliberately violating reexport controls on dual-use technology, but Beijing 
lacks an effective means to control ttrw_e7c ort of high technology by its 
several thousand trading companies.   
Despite improving Sino-Soviet relations, a variety of sources 
indicate China will continue to place priority on good ties to Washington. 
Br .jing looks to the United States to provide a counterweight to the Soviet 
Union and Japan, and believes that only the West can provide the levels of 
investment, advanced technology, and large markets required for Chinese 
economic and military development. Although a gradual rejuvenation of 
party links between the Communist giants is inevitable, we believe China 
and the Soviet Union will remain separated by Beijing's lingering distrust 
of Moscow's ultimate goals and their rivalry for influence in Asia. 
Goals of the Summit 
Beijing and Moscow hope for a cordial summit to demonstrate that 30 years of 
acrimonious Sino-Soviet relations are ending and to ratify a document establishing the 
foundation for a new relationship. We believe that, from China's vantage point. 
President Bush's visit to Beijing in February and a successful Deng-Gorbachev summit 
promote Beijing's desire to have better relations with Moscow and Washington than they 
have with each other. Beijing has nervously watched the Increasing warmth in 
US-Soviet contacts over the past two years and probably scheduled the summIt--even 
before the so-called 'three obstacles to normalized relati7A7 fully resolved--to 
ensure that it maintains its leverage with both superpowers.

A Preview of Gorbachev's Key Meetings 
Gorbachev's most important meeting will be with Deng Xiaoping. The 
Deng-Gorbachev meeting will be the first leadership summit since Khrushchev 
met with Mao in 1959, even though Deng's official post is not heed of state or 
party but Chairman of the Chinese Military Commission. Chinese analysts and 
officials are portraying the summit as a personal triumph for Deng, one that 
sets a new basis for the development of bilateral ties before he finally retires. 
Deng and Gorbachev have created a legacy of bold reforms to revitalize 
economies sagging from overreliance on central planning. They have attempted 
to decrease the official role in controlling the economy and cut bloated military 
establishments. Deng and Gorbachev hold sharply different views on the value 
of political liberalization, however, as Deng has pursued market-oriented 
economic reforms and openness to the West with only feeble attempts to make 
the Communist Party more responsive to criticism. 
Gorbachev's meeting with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang will effectively 
mark the reestablishment of party-to-party ties. Beijing will look for Gorbachev 
to admit mistakes in past party relations and promise noninterference and 
equality in the future. Chinese media may carry only limited coverage of their 
meeting--in comparison with the press fanfare anticipated for Gorbachev's 
other meetings--to play down the significance of the restoration of party ties. 
Gorbachev's meeting with Premier Li Ping will include substbntive 
discussions on uilateral issues. During his meeting with President Bush, Li 
assumed a greater foreign policy role than he has in the past, and we anticipate 
his talks with the General Secretary will include discussions of troop strengths 
along the Sino-Soviet border and the Soviet troop presence in Mongolia, the 
Cambodian issue, economic cooperation, and progress on demarcating the 
Sino-Soviet border. Li may be the Chinese leader who will pay the first  
high-leveL r t rn visit to Moscow, perhaps this year,/  
Li would be an unusual choice; he is not Gorbachev's host and his 
positio.� does not correspond to any that Gorbachev holds. 
Gorbachev's meeting with his nominal host, President Yang Shangkun, 
may be more symbolic than substantive. Yang extended the official invitation to 
Gcrbachev--making it a state rather than a party visit--probably out of 
deference to Western sensitivities.  As Gorbachev's host, he will probably 
receive an invitation to visit Moscow.

Beijing also views the summit as an unprecedented opportunity to reduce the 
near-term Soviet military threat to China. China almost certainly still perceives the 
Soviet Union as its most credible long-term threat, but lessened security tensions until 
at least early in the next century can assist Beijing in building the economic and military 
strength it now lacks. The summit also allows Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, now 84, 
to set the parameters of Sino-Soviet relations before he loses his ability to assert his 
political will. 
For Gorbachev, a rejuvenated relationship with Beijing means the ability to divert 
resources from military preparedness on yet another long border, advances the Soviet 
goal of playing a significantly larger role in Asia, and perhaps begins a process of 
halting the steady expansion in Sino-US cooperation In East Asia. Gorbachev probably 
views his meeting with Deng as a strong message to the United States and domestically 
that he has achieved a major breakthrough with the Chinese by overcoming opposition 
from the Chinese leader who has been the most suspicious of Moscow. Gorbachev also 
sees the summit as justification for Soviet military reductions in the Far East. which he 
hopes to translate into savings for the domestic economy. Moscow will also continue 
to use warming US-Soviet ties to prod China to be more cooperative. The Soviets, for 
example, scheduled Secretary Baker's visit to Moscow just a few days before the 
summit. 
Parameters of the Joint Communique 
Aside from the first face-to-face discussions between Gorbachev and senior 
Chinese leaders--Gorbachev has met only Premier Li Peng--the most important bilateral 
achievement of the summit is likely to be a joint communique. Moscow has sought 
such a document for years and probably sees it as the equivalent of the Sino-US 
communique of 1972, which formally ended Sino-US animosity and defined the 
principles of the relationship. Beijing, for its part, finds such documents extremely 
useful in diplomatic interactions, offering the Chinese the tool to influence the conduct 
Of the Other nation by claiming violations of the principles or the spirit of joint 
communiques. . ,the communique will focus on 
the five principles of peaceful coexistence--noninterference in each other's domestic 
affairs, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, nonuse of force, 
good-neighborliness, and friendship. 
Soviet and Chinese diplomats have already held extended meetings to shape the 
document, and the most contentious points probably have not yet been resolved and 
may be skirted entirely. Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev's late April visit to Beijing 
reportedly focused on ironing out disagreements, with Cambodia apparently the main 
stumbling block:

Cambodia: Room For Compromise? 
Although Soviet and Chinese press are downplaying prospects for a 
breakthrough on Cambodia at the summit, both sides seem to be moving closer 
on the composition of an international control mechanism to monitor the 
Vietnamese withdrawal and the convening of an international conference. 
Beijing has increased pressure on Moscow, probably out of concern that Hanoi 
has seized the diplomatic initiative with its recent announcement of an 
"unconditional" Vietnamese pullout from Cambodia by September. The Chinese 
also worry that People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) Premier Hun Sen's recent 
Initiatives and his growing international stature  will enhance his ability to 
dominate Cambodia after the Vietnamese pull out. 
The Chinese have tried to gain Soviet commitment to several aspects of 
a comprehensive settlement including: 
� Endorsement of Prince Sihanouk as the head of a quadripartite 
provisional government and dissolution of the present PRK 
Government. 
� Support for reducing the four Cambodian military forces to the 
same low level (approximately 10,000 to 15,000 men per faction) 
and their reintegration in a unified defense force. 
Moscow !as increased pressure on Hanoi to be more responsive on key 
issues on the eve of the summit, but is unlikely to go beyond the positions 
Vietnam is advancing at the Sino-Vietnamese talks from 8 to 10 May: 
� In an attempt to break the stalemate over power-sharing 
arrangements. Moscow has been advocating an expanded version 
of an old PRK proposal on establishing a quadripartite 'supreme 
council of national reconciliation which would be "above" the PRK 
government--not in place of it--and responsible for holding 
elections. 
� Moscow probably will continue to support the PRK's stance 
against the Chinese proposal to reduce each party's forces to an 
equal level because it would leave the PRK at a disadvantage and 
could allow the Khmer Rouge to regain exclusive power. Moscow 
will also push Beijing to cut ofictl the Khmer Rouge during 
instead of after Hanoi's pullout.

(b)(3) 
� Beijing reportedly seeks a written Soviet commitment to a comprehensive 
Cambodian settlement that Includes power-sharing arrangements for a future 
government in Phnom Penh headed by Prince Sihanouk. 
� Although kMoscow is  stepping up (b)(1) 
pressure on Hanoi on the eve of the summit�and had told Beijing it would help (b)(3) 
resolve the internal side of a settlement--the Soviets insist they cannot dictate 
policy to Vietnam or the PRIC 
Barring a dramatic breakthrough on Cambodia--a possibility but not a likelihood during (b)(1) 
the Sino-Vietnamese Vice Ministerial talks in Beijing from 8 to 10 May--the communique (b)(3) 
may well contain separate statements on Cambodia, with Beiiina  and Moscow agreeing 
to disagree. Rogachev has studied 
the 1979 and 1982 Sib-US agreements on Taiwan, suggesting that Moscow seeks ways 
to finesse Cambodia and other outstanding Issues.   (b)(3) 
A second major complication is whether the document will codify the resumption 
of party ties.  reports that the Soviets are pushing for a set (b)(1) 
of principles and objectives of party-to-party ties possibly similar to a 1988 (b)(3) 
Soviet-Yugoslav joint declaration. The Chinese reportedly are demurring, arguing that 
this would upset the United States and would prefer that the meeting between party 
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and Gorbachev signal, without fanfare, a return to 
normalcy. Chinese party leaders, however, may see advantages in spelling out in writing 
that the Soviet paternalism of the 1950s has ended and that future ties are based on 
independence, equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in each others internal 
affairs. Beijing might attempt to use the prospects of a statement on party relations to 
entice Moscow to be more responsive on Cambodia. =(b)(3) 
Whether party ties are codified in a summit comr.lunique, a gradual rejuvenation 
of party links across the board is inevitable. Chinese party representatives are likely to 
attend future world Communist meetings convened by Moscow, and regular party 
exchanges will begin. The Soviet All-Union Komsomol and the Communist Youth 
League of China have already agreed to resume contacts after the summit, and both 
sides are discussing future exchanges of journalists, teachers, and students, according to 
Soviet radiobroadcasts. Beijing reportedly is especially interested in sending Youth 
League members to apprentice in Soviet scientific research institutes and industrial 
enterprises. While party-to-party connections may not accomplish much more than 
transactions through existing government channels, they will create a special dimension 
in Sino-Soviet ties that the West does not enjoy. 
Security and Border Issues 
Gorbachev is likely to bring to Beijing specifics on the proposed 200,000-man 
(b)(3) 
force reductions in the Soviet Far East, but will push Beijing to reci rocate.

The Soviets seek a comprehensive border accord that could trade 
Heixiazi Island opposite the Soviet city of Khabarovsk for Chinese concessions 
In the west. The Chinese have dropped a demand for the repudiation of the 
unequal treaties and appear willing to settle for the Soviets giving back the land 
that they took beyond the border marked by the treaties in the west. 
In our judgement. Moscow has been prepared for some time to give 
Heixiazi back. Gorbachev set the stage for a compromise when he publ:cly 
announced Soviet agreement with the long-held Chinese position that the 
eastern border passes along the main channel of the Amur River in his 
Vladivostok speech. The Soviets later agreed to begin aerial photography of the 
eastern sector, which Moscow must have realized would show Heixiazi on the 
Chinese side of the main channel. The Soviets will probably be careful to claim 
that the natural flow of the river has changed the border to avoid setting a 
precedent that could apply to any other disputed territories along the USSR's 
borders; a rationalization that Moscow would be unable to use in the western 
sector. Beijing will also approach the more legalistic territorial dispute In the 
west with caution to avoio setting damaging precedents for Its territorial claims 
on the border with India and in the Spratly Islands.

1991--but that forces will be restructured to a defensive configuration. The reduction 
and restructuring of Soviet units could affect half of the ground force divisions opposite 
China--through reductions in personnel strength, conversion to static defense divisions, 
and disbandment. Although the Soviets would retain a qualitative superiority, the 
changes could cut Soviet tank strength--estimated at 14,200--by some 5,000. China 
has appi .-.;ximately 5,900 tanks in regions opposite the Soviet Union. Thus far, China has 
pointed to its own 1-million-man reduction in the size of its armed forces since 1985 
and appears in no hurry to schedule meetings of a military and diplomatic experts group 
that was agreed  to In principle at the Foreign Ministers' discussions in December and 
February. 
Chinese leaders probably calculate that because Gorbachev's offer of cuts was 
unconditional, they stand to gain little at this time by offering reciprocal reductions. We 
believe Beijing first wishes to see some of the Soviet cuts implemented and, in our 
judgment, the extent of Beijing's willingness to offer reciprocal Chinese actions will 
depend on the ultimate outcome of a current debate within the hinese leadership over 
defense strategy and the nature of the strategic threat to China Ll At the summit, Beijing 
will probably opt simply to discuss with Gorbachev potential confidence-building 
measures--such as limiting  the scope and number of exercises and providing advance 
notice of training activities. 
Marked increases in the number of meetings involving the border demarcation 
issue in the past few weeks suggest to us that both sides are seeking at least an 
agreement in principle on the disputed territories at the summit. To date, most of the 
territorial issues in the eastern sector have been settled and only the areas near the 
Pamirs in the west remain largely unresolved. We judge that if the Soviets are assured 
of future compromises in the west, Gorbachev may concede the islands opposite 
Khabarovsk to the Chinese during this visit. According to a Chinese-controlled Hong 
Kong newspaper, Zhenbao (Damansky) Island�the site of bitter clashes in 1969--has 
already been turned over to China. Chinese troops are reportedly now patrolling the 
island unarmed, which could be a signal to Moscow that China will not place major 
military installations on Heixiazi Island if it is returned. 
Addressing the World Stage 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
In many ways, Gorbachev and Deng will be playing as much to the United States, 
the rest of Asia, and the world as to each other during the summit. Gorbachev, for (b)(1

the Soviet leader would probably prefer to 
make such a grand gesture at a summit in Japan but, given the poor prospects for such 
an event this year, may choose the second best podium in East Asia. Gorbachev, 
however, will be careful to avoid giving Beijing the impression that Moscow is using 
China as merely a tool to reach other Asian countries and may even informall sound 
Out Beijing to gauge possible Chinese reaction to any dramatic proposal. 
For the Chinese, the summit risks reawakening fears in the West and 
non-Communist Asia of the rebirth of monolithic Communism, which could jeopardize 
Chinese access to Western technology and markets. Thus, as they have done over the 
past few months, Beijing will try to find ways to reassure the world that Sino-Soviet 
rapprochement is constrained. The surprise decision by Beijing to send a navy ship to 
Hawaii in April for its first Western port call since 1949 was clearly designed to remind 
all concerned of the special nature of US-China military ties. In addition, Beijing's 
invitation to a US naval task group to visit Shanghai beginning on the afternoon of the 
day that Gorbachev is scheduled to leave Shan hai demonstrates that in the military 
sphere China continues to lean to the West. 
Similarly, we believe Beijing's insistence on highly specific language on Cambodia 
is intended to reassure its friends in ASEAN and the West, particularly Thailand, that 
Beijing is not losing sight of important regio  I 
a. rnnearne find will sit^ io7 highlight 
continuing sharp differences with Moscow. Beijing is 
insisting on language in the communique th�iii state flatly that Sib-Soviet relations 
will not return to their status of the 1950s or affect bilateral ties with third parties. We 
expect  both Beijing and Moscow to quickly brief thoir allies and friends after the summit.

Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation at a Glance 
Bilateral ec000mic interaction has grown steadily for the past four years despite 
a lack of normalized political relations. In 1985, for example, the two sides 
signed their first five-year trade agreement in more than 25 years: 
� Sino-Soviet trade approached $3.3 billion last year, far less than 
the $14 bitlio:i Sino-US trade but 10 times the level of 
Sino-Soviet trade In 1982. Cross-border trade--which made up 
only 3 percent of overall trade in 1987--topped 6400 million in 
1988, accounting for more than 10 percent of trade. 
� In 1986 the Soviets agreed to renovate 17 factories and construct 
seven new facilities, most in northeastern China. Several hundred 
Soviet technicians ultimately will be sent to China for these and 
other industrial programs, and an equal number of Chinese will be 
sent to the USSR for training. One roadblock to progress has 
been Chinese dissatisfaction with the quality and technical level of 
Soviet industrial equipment Moscow has offered. 
New areas of cooperation for 1989 include joint ventures in the energy field. 
limited Soviet financial assistance to Chinese projects, and Chinese labor 
exports to the Soviet Far East: 
�Moscowhasoffered8eiilng nuclear power plants and. 
 technical details for a plant in Liaoning 
Province have been agreed upon but financial arrangements are 
still under negotiation. Moscow is already a major supplier of 
thermal power plants with over a dozen contracts, mostly in 
northern China. 
� The Soviets recently agreed to extend a 6125 million credit .to 
Beijing for steel-manufacturing equipment, the third known Soviet 
credit to China In the past year. Previously. China had avoided 
any credit arrangements because of the bitter experiences of 
'Soviet aid* in credits in the early 1960s. 
� B ing is sending over 10,000 Chinese laborers to the Soviet 
Union as part of three labor agreements signed in 1988, according 
to the Chinese press. This Is part of complicated 
compensatory-trade arrangements which--In some 
cases--exchange Chinese labor services for a percentage of the 
goods produced from such labor.

China has traditionally purchased passenger aircraft, transport helicopters, and trucks 
from the Soviets, and we believe there is a strong possibility that this cooperation will 
extend to military hardware and technology. China's military would almost certainly like 
to acquire Soviet radar and electronic warfare gear, export versions of Soviet main 
battle tanks, and attack helicopters, particularly if the sales package includes production 
technology.2 In our judgment, the unresolved question is how far Moscow is willing to 
go in transferring capabilities that can markedly improve the quality of Chinese forces 
facing the Soviet Union and its allies. 
The Chinese and Soviet military establishments may also begin a dialogue on 
regional affairs and limited intelligence exchanges--areas which Beijing had in the past  
refused to consider. 
Sharing of dual-use technologies in electronics research and production is 
another area in which Sino-Soviet cooperation may reach new levels. China is already 
providing its highly advanced gallium arsenide technology�used in microelectronics to 
enhance remote sensing and high-speed computing--to Moscow in exchange for silicon 
production technology, and Beijing recently proposed exchanging top experts in 
microelectronics. Soviet technology is attractive to many Chinese be

Although we expect economic ties to continue their steady growth after the 
summit, both sides appear somewhat disa ointed with the ace of ex ansion 
The Chinese have suggested that less ambitious programs be discussed and probably 
want to see results on existing agreements first. A major problem has been that while 
many agreements in principle have been signed, bureaucratic and other problems have 
delayed their implementation. Nonetheless, Sino-Soviet trade probably will exceed a 53 
billion average annual figure for the rest of the five-year barter trade agreement that 
extends to 1990. And new cooperation in such areas as border trade, joint ventures. 
Soviet financial credits, and labor exchanges�particularly the export of Chinese 
construction, agricultural, and timber workers to Siberia--holds new promise of mutual 
economic benefit. 
(b)(3) 
Regional Implications 
Better Sino-Soviet relations are likely to have a positive impact on some aspects 
of East Asian security. Sino-Soviet rapprochement has already contributed to reducing 
somewhat Chinese tensions with Vietnam, India, and Mongolia. Both Beijing and 
Moscow also have a vested interest in easing tension on the Korean peninsula and 
finding a way to establi&I official relations with Seoul. Should the Soviets and Chinese 
begin to cooperate on such issues as jointly encouraging North  Korean restraint, this 
cooperation could have positive implications for regional stability. 
The continued improvement in Sino-Soviet ties that we foresee in the next year 
or two will give Moscow and Beijing more weight in regional affairs, but we believe 
there are few major arenas of potential bilateral cooperation in East Asia, as each will 
seek to advance its own competing influence. In particular, as Moscow steps up 
overtures to the non-Communist Asian countries, increased competition for investment 
and trade opportunities as well as political influence is likely. Moscow will probably not 
be a serious economic competitor in the near term because economic development in 
the Soviet Far East lags behind Chinese reform efforts. In the long term, however, 
competition for investment and trade almost certainly will increase, especially if the 
Soviets are willing to compromise on political issues important to regional actors--such 
as Japan's claim to th6 Northern Territories and pressure on North Korea to be more 
accommodating toward Seoul. The Soviets are also beginning to develop special 
economic zones in the Far East--modeled after China's�which could compete with 
those in China. Beijing is likely to look with suspicion upon any future Soviet inroads in 
the region�which China has traditionally viewed as its ''backyard.*

Implications For Washington 
Improved Sino-Soviet relations will increase Chinese and Soviet leverage in 
relations with tne Unitod States and add to Gorbachev's image as a peacemaker. The 
already minimal potential for Sino-Soviet military conflict will recede even further, 
presenting new challenges to US foreign policy. In an atmosphere of triangular detente. 
Japan probably will be under greater pressure to Improve Its relations with the Soviet 
Union. Moreover, if the image of the Soviet military threat in East Asia Is diminished, 
non-Communist East Asians may see less need to spend money on defense or to permit 
US military access, especially if Moscow announces It will abandon its military base at 
Cam Ranh unilaterally, further curtail its naval deployments in the Asia-Pacific region, or 
return the contested Northern Territories to Japan. It is conceivable that the Soviets will 
eventually make all of these moves, with the withdrawal from Cam Ranh probably the 
most likely in the near term. If Sino-Soviet relations improve too rapidly, however, 
others may turn more to Washington as a counterweight to the two Communist giants 
Some Asian countries--such as India and Vietnam--may seek greater interaction with 
the United States if they perceive warming Sino-Sqviet relations as threatening. 
Moscow and Beijing may also cooperate on a number of UN issues, arms control 
questions, and in multilateral forums where Soviet and Chinese positions are closer than 
China's are to the United States. In some of these cases, however, China's positions are 
largely rhetorical--such as on Nicaragua and the debt question--and are primarily aimed 
at a Third World audience to demonstrate China's independent foreign policy. In our 
judgment. Beijing looks to the United States to play a strong role in maintaining stability 
in Asia and will remain extremely wary of Soviet calls for an international forum to 
discuss Asian security. China almost certainly believes that any such collective Asian 
security pact would lend legitimacy to Soviet attempts to extend influence in East Asia 
and, in any event, represents a ruse for obtaining US military force cuts. 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
While Beijing seeks to enhance its leverage in triangular relations, the Chinese 
have gone to some lengths to reassure the United States that improvements in 
Sino-Soviet relations do not portend a radically different US-China relationship. Chinesen__,,,, 
leaders have reportedly decided that relations with the United States must remainku)l ) 
paramount and have apparently avoided trying to score gains with the Soviets at the(b)(3) 
expense of the United States. In recent meetings with Chinese leaders, US officials have 
been reminded of the unique and enduring aspects of Sino-US relations, such as the  
close cooperation in the military sphere. 
The United States will remain central to Chinese foreign policy because of the 
continuing need for a counterweight to the Soviet Union and Japan, and the belief that 
only the West can provide the investment, advanced technology, and large hard currency 
paying markets required for Chinese economic and military development. We believe 
the Chinese leadership continues to judge that, although the Soviet Union sincerely 
desires a period of extended peace to rebuild Its economy, it will eventually again 
attempt to bring China under its sway. Moreover, Chinese leaders probably calculate
