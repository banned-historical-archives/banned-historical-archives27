NEW YORK' TINES ! 
28 January 1973 
ESPIONAGE CHARGE 
DENIED BY WILSON 
LONDON, Jan. 27 (AP)?
Former Prime Minister Harold 
Wilson denied today a report 
that he hid an American spy in 
his residence outside London 
'where he met with Soviet Pre-
mier Alexei N. Kosygin in 1967 
for secret talks on Vietnam. 
Mr. Wilson also denied that 
a United States agent was 
given drafts Of documents that 
he drew up before the talks or 
a transcript of a telephdhe call 
between- Mr. Kosygin and 
Leonid t. Brezhnev, the Soviet 
Communist party chief, that 
British intelligence had alleg-
edly tapped. 
The charges which were 
made by Brig. Gen. Paul Gor-
man in testimony yesterday at 
the Pentagon papers trial in Los 
Angeles. were 'a totally tom-
red version" of whit took 
place, Mr. Wilson contended. 
' He denied that British agents 
had tapped a telephone conver-
sation between Mr. Kosygin 
and Mr. Brezhnev. ' 
General Gorman said a 
United States agent, named 
Chester Cooper, had lived at 10 
Downing Streett the official 
residence of British prime min-
isters, so that he could work-
with Mr. Wilson as he prepared 
for the meeting with Mr. Kosy-
gin. 
The general said that the 
agent later hid in What he 
described as a "garret prison 
room" at Chequers when the, 
two leaders met. There was no 
indication whether. the agent, 
was able to hear what they dis-
? 
cussed., 
Mr. Wilson said that Mr., 
Cooper, whom he described as 
the President's special repre-
sentative, was not in a position 
to know what he and Mr, Kosy-, 
gin said. = 
. The cloak-and-dagger story 
-Was reported in four previously, 
unpublished Pentagon Taper* 
that dealt with British-Amen-
can links. ,4 
Mr: Wilson said In a statei 
ment: "There is also a suggesv

WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY: Last Sunday, Senator Edward Kennedy [ 
proposed in the New York Times that President Nixon, having, . 
after all, gone to China ancfreestablished informal relations 
.there, there is oo purpose left to be served in continuing to 
ostracize Cuba, 'Mr.. Kennedy's. point struck many people as logical-
ly compelling as we see the ongoing collapse of commitments 
and alliances annealed by the. spirit of resistance.to communism 
a generation 'Ago: Among greater and lesser casualties of that, 
,.dissolution is the Central Intelligence Agency, whO/se'organizing 
bias, if you will, was the postwar decision to let communism 
move no further. 
To discuss these points'xwe have two guests. Mr. Mario 
Lazo became an American citizen only a few days ago, though 
he has lived half his life here, he other half in Cuba. He 
.:was among the two or three best known lawyers in Havana, the 
founder of a huge firm well-known among other things for its 
philanthropic activities. He leg, Cuba after the Bay of Pigs 
and published a year or so ago a Ofinitive account of the failure 
of the move to liberate Cuba,."Da0ger In The Heart." 
Howard Bunt was intimately involved as an official 
in the CIA in the*Bay of Pigs. Indeed, the New York Times named. 
him as the principal CIA official directly involved in that 
venture. He is a graduate of BroMn University, who was a war 
correspondent for Life magazine, A freelance writer who has . 
published, forty-two books, most of them Spy novels. On retireMent. 
from the CIA after twenty years of duty, he did freelance work 
as a White House consultant and last June was arrested in connect-. 
.ion with the Watergate case, Last Monday he pleaded guilty 
before federal court and the sentencing is yet to come, The 
-presiding judge and Mr. Hunt's own lawyer have forbidden him 
to speak about Watergate. But his involvement there has not, 
pretumably, diminished his knowledge Of the CIA' and Cuba and . 
:his special qualifications, born of long experience to discuss. 
Hthe CIA and foreign policy. 
The lawyers from Washington have only just now advised, 
us that we may not submit to questioning as usual by the panel, 
to whom I apologize. 
I should like to begin by asking Mr. Hunt whether 
his public identification as a long-time CIA official confers 
upon him now the right, if only in self-defense, to describe 
with appropriate discretion some of the activities of the CIA, 
particularly as they relate to Cuba. 
E. HOWARD HUNT: I believe that it does, Mr. Buckley.! 
After all, it was not 1 who identified myself as a former employee, 
officer, or official of the Central Intelligence Agency. That 
Information tame from the government itself, And I considered"; 
It then, and I consider it now, a unilateral abrogation by the

'.from the Central Intelligence Agency. ? 
BUCKLEY: Your point is that -- that when you were: 
Harrested somebody in the government... 
HUNT: Max I

HUNT: I was

BUCKLEY: Uh-huh.

When you were what? Detained? 
I surrendered ? to U.S. authoriti 
HUNT: But I was never at any time arrested. 
. BUCKLEY: Well, was them-- had that Was 
that point a warrant for your arrest? ' 
HUNT: NO warrant was ever issued forli 
BUCKLEY: No. UhLhun. 
HUNT:, I was never a fugitive. 
BUCKLEY: Yes. But - but -- at that at that Point?, 
understand it, the fact of your having been associated. 
CIA was for the first time publiclY-ventilated?-
HUNT: That is correct, yes. 
BUCKLEY: Yes. Now, does -- does this mean that you'... 
you can speak about yourself as having been a member of the 
CIA with.moral.impugnity, or does it mean that you can go further 
In that.-- than that and describessome of the activities of , 
CIA in Cuba and some of the forecasts for CIA in the current 
mood of detente? 
'?HUNT: I feel that I'm.able.to do. that, yes.\ 
\ 
BUCKLEY: Okay. Well, then,let:.me ask you a.direct. 
question. The,.CIA is.not permitted, as,I understand .it to. 
engage, In domestic activity. Right? 
HUNT: Right. 
1. BUCKLEY: NOW, does that.mean-that nobody has any, 
Irtght.to..suipeCt.that -- that the-Watergate.businesswas a CIA'.

.1 for, example, that the CIA atone.tiMe.,was involved in domestic-
Mierationt. And I cite the discovery, the disclosure, of... ? 
BUCKLEY: The NSA business? 
HUNT: ...CIA support of the National Student Association 
That was a domestic operation. 
BUCKLEY: But for purposes of foreign travel wasn't 
it? 
HUNT: Not solely, no. They recruited:American students

to work abroad. 
BUCKLEY: Well, what -- what about the Suspicion, 
that' has been widely ventilated, that experience, especially 
I.lifelong experience, with the CIA teaches a person to forget 
.about the legal impediments that lie between him and the accomplish. 
lment.of a mission that he seeks to -. to achieve? In -- in 
ithe grownup world, as I understand it, everybody recognizes 
Ithat it is illegal for a CIA 'operative to -- to -- to work in 
Cuba and it's illegal for a Cuban operative to work in the United ' 
States' but they both do'it. 
HUNT: Yes.

, ? ' BUCKLEY: Now, Under the circumstances, I g0ess the?H.,, 
question .I'm asking is, if,ank Spends_twenty- years working for i:',

the CIA, is it likely that on returning to one's own country;, 
one has so?much absorbed the ethos of the CIA that one tends 
to-voaf,*,ter_what,it_is ?tha'[tHone,wants?and to consider local 
legislatiOn'that-standS in the Way as sort of irrelevant? 
4 
; 
HUNT: If one even were to consider 
- It would not be illegal under United States law, fordexample, 
for CIA to mount an entry operation in Ottawa or -- or Fort 
Erie, Canada, the other side of the Peace Bridge. But here ' 
we have a?geographical distinction.. We would not be guilty.. 
Under United States law of of, let's say, a. second-degree: 4 
,burglary charge by the United States for an operation that we 
.conducted in Canada, or in Mexico; we would be were'it conducted 
In Florida. or Texas or SouthernCalifornia. 
BUCKLEY: Well, I -- I wish to... 
HUNT: Am I answering... 
BUCKLEY: Yes, you are. And I wish to be Very'explici 
about it. I want to abide by the -- the ground rules and not 
not try to -- any sneak punches. But I guess what I'm -- what 1 
I'm asking is, is -. is it fair to say, without violating our 
understanding, that in approaching the Watergate business you

LAZO: No, I think that was the first time that I 
remember. You had something else in. mind? If you ask me, I'll 
be glad to answer you. 
BUCKLEY: Well, you -- you -- you were living i 
as a Cuban citizen. 
LAZO: That s right. 
BUCKLEY: And you were - as I understand it, you. 
were helping out agents of a foreign country, including indirectly 
Mr. Hunt, who were pursuing the orders of the President of the 
United States. I'm asking you did you know what those orders 
were. 
LAZO: Well, Mr. Buckley, look We worked, my partner 
and.'! worked, for many years with the CIA and the FBI. Anything 
we could dO to help them wt -- we did. 
BUCKLEY: Was this in violation of Cuban law? 
LAZO: No, No this,;.:. 
.BUCKLEY: It's okay to work with :a foreign...

was no country that was closer-to.the United States than Cuba,

Cuba that.the United States should know. For instance, we repre en.

out and they were reporting from all over the country, and the 
,headquarters, the main office, of the railroads was right under 
our office, and they would give us reports all the": time and . 
we would pass them to the American embassy.., My sympathies have

Now, at I was saying, when the embassy Went down andr! 
it seemed to me that the United States didn't ?have very good . 
.sources of information anymore, then I would send reports once 
,a week by a. courier, who would ? go from Havana. to New York to

'BUCKLEY: YOU you were.really a volunteer collectf 
.LAZO: Yes, surely. 
BUCKLEY: ...information. All right. All right, . 
now, going back to Washington, I'd like to ask this of Mr. Hunt. 
It is often-referred to, the Bay of Pigs, as -- as the ,greatest 
Jiasco.in postwar American history. And -- and -- and reference 
to it is usually used to inspire some sort of a -- a disdain 
for CIA, Now, I'd like to ask you a two-part question. Number 
one, was. it A failure of intelligence by CIA that resulted in 
the fiasco? And number two, if it was more than that i if it 
was a political failure in Washington, is it a reseentibility 
of CIA to make recommendations with reference, to thelr anticipation-. 
of the fortitude. in Washington? 
HUNT:. Let me answer as follows. And I want to answer 
as completely .and'responsively as I can. First, the fiasco . 
Of the Bay of Pigs... 
BUCKLEY: A little louder, please. 
HUNT: The fiasco of the Bay of Pigs was not a failure 
of intelligence. It was not a failure of intelligence collection 
or of positive intelligence operations. The failure of the 
Bay of Pigs came about because at a critical time commitments 
that had been made by high officials of the United States govern-
ment to the Cubans who were fighting, to their leadership in 
Miami and elsewhere, those officials backed away from those 
commitments and, in effect, abandoned the brigade at the beachhead. 
That was a political decision. 
CIA never had any reason to believe that these commitments 
would be abandoned. We had, after all, been recruiting the 
Cubans, sending them to training camps in Guatamala for many, 
many months. And these were the ground rules. First of all, 
'there was the United States fleet offshore. The Boxer was the 
flagship. Secondly; the -- the principal things that the --
thing that the Cubans were interested in was that they not 
be opposed at the beachhead by Castro airpower. And this was 
a definite commitment that was made. Now, this commitment was 
made by the Eisenhower administration, in which now President 
Nixon served as Vice President. And I believe he chaired the 
'National Security Council in that capacity. So, in effect, 
the commitment that was made to the Cubans, who went forward 
and risked their lives, was nullified by a subsequent political 
decision of the New Frontier. 
BUCKLEY: Well, was there anything to lead you to 
believe, between the inauguration of President Kennedy and the 
:Bay of Pigs, that he had second thoughts about it? 
HUNT: There was this. First of all, during the campaign. 
:President Kennedy 'campaigned -- then Senator Kennedy 'campaigned 
on a promise of help to the Cuban exiles. Pres -- Vice President 
.Nixon, who was intimately involved with the operational planning 
from his position In the National Security Council, could not

to close down all recruiting and training activities for time

this period, Allen Dulles, Dick Bissell, some of the other princi 
pal officers of CIA went down to the Kennedy Palm Beach compound 
? and told him exactly what the situation was. In due course, 
after about two or three weeks, the commitment was made: go 
ahead, continue as before. ?

an incoming President would want to review what his predecessors 
had done.

no inference on our -- or our-pirt, thit there would be a drawing 
away from the overall commitment, which was to overthrow Castro 
and regain Cuba for the free world. 
said... 
BUCKLEY: Right. Now, the -- Senator Kennedy has 
HUNT: Senator Edward Kennedy? 
BUCKLEY: Yes. I'm sorry. Edward Kennedy has said 
apropos of the situation that only only an armed invasion 
would have pursuaded -- or, would have succeeded in causing 
Castro to be overthrown. Now, I take it everybody agrees that 
that was the case when Castro first took power. He -- he 
he was very popular at that point. To what extent was the intelli. 
gence reckoning about -- on the Bay of Pigs dependent on a view 
of a transformed attitude towards Castro by the Cuban people? 
Did you proceed -- and I'd like for Mr. Lazo also to comment 
on this -- did you proceed on the assumption that people whose 
mission it was to overthrow Castro would be universally welcomed? 
HUNT: Not universally, no. But certainly4by a majority 
of the Cuban people. This is not to say that we vAeWed the 
the Cuban citizenry under Castro as a military asset to ourselves. 
We viewed them as probably being responsive to early indications 
of victory, and of overwhelming force that we intended to show. 
Again, I should bring out that our -- that the New Frontier 
did dilute our original plans. It was to be -- instead of an 
armed airborne envelopment of the -- of the central city in 
Cuba, this was minimized, apparently by Dean Rusk. 
r ,I bring out a number of these points in a forthcoming,t

!not done in the way that you would normally think. For instance 
Ithey didn't -- he didn't -=-"they don't follow 'em around in

fthat they assign Cuban secret servicemen to the varioUs dives! 
.'and places in Havana, which was a city of a million people, 0

1Wherp,ithe, underworld gathered.' 
L 110 
BUCKLEY: Uh-huh. 
LAZO: These people are disguised. Sometimes they 
feign intoxication, although the Cubans don't drink very much. 
And they keep their eyes open and their ears open, and if theyti 
Isee anything suspicious or hear anything, they follow 'em and. 1 
they do plenty of bugging of telephones. And that goes on for 
for a week or ten days. 
Barker was the head of this Cuban group, you see. 
But in taking this job he had signed a police form which was 
'handed to him, Land it turned out that this police form contain! 
'a -- an oath' of' allegiance to Cuba. And somebody heard about 
that, some kid in the embassy, heard about it and reported it 
to Washington, and then they took away his citizenship. And 
Colonel Grant, when .he brought Barker to me, said, "Mario," 
,he said, "this fellow has had a wonderful war record, was a 
;captain in the American Air Force. He was the first fellow 
to volunteer from Cuba. He had something like twelve missions 
over Germany. He was shot down. He was in prison there. And 
I wish you'd help him. Everybody admires him." So of course 
did help him. And that was arranged. 
Now, the second thing that happened was a little *more 
dramatic. This was in early 1960 after Castro had been in power 
about a year. Barker came to me one time, distraught and nervou 
;and his problem then was that he had had hiding in his house 
one of his closest friends who had been doing counterrevolutionar 
work and had been there a couple of weeks and finally had decided, 
to make a move and got caught. And under the pressure of tortur 
he'd confessed where he was. And Barker had wisely arranged , 
to call his wife every two hours from a pay station in Havana 
.to a grocery store near their house in the suburbs. He had 
,a daughter, a little girl by the name of Maria Elena, Helen, 
,she was about ten years old. And they had one faithful servant. 
tAnd he thought I could get him out because we represented '.a 
couple of the American airlines. He's a very intelligent fellow 
:But he was, as I say, distraught; he wasn't thinking very straight. 
Of course to harbor a so-called "criminal" was a capital offense, 
!too. So Barker was in danger of being killed. 
So 4 tOld him exactly What you. woultifhave told him. .

what your house looks like, 'cause he's been there; but he hasn't 
been there for six months. And tell that little girl of yours 
to say the same thing and your servant to say the same thing, 
and never deviate from that. And I'll do what I can to get 
this boy to change his story before he dies." 
So in those days they permitted one member of the 
family to see somebody who was about to be executed. In this 
case, it was this boy's Oster. A very attractive girl, about.--
Cuban girl, about twenty-five, typical Cuban girl with -- with 
pale, pallid white skin, ebony black hair, flashing eyes, long 
eyelashes', high spirited girl. And I went to see her and I 
said, "Will you help my friend?" And she said, "Of course. 
Your friend did everything he could to save my brother. Now 
we have to try to save him." And I arranged for a launch to 
go across the bay to Cabanios E?) Fortress to. see the execution. 
And as the priest was moving away and the squad was getting 
ready to fire, this fellow began screaming, in Spanish of course: 
he said, "One more fhing. I want to say that I haven't been 
in Bernard Barker's house in six months." And he kept on repeating 
that until they shot him. But he was a very nice-looking fellow 
. and they didn't want to shoot him. As a matter of fact, only 
one bullet hit him. And he slumped down. Two men Went up and

In charge of the squad told them that if they didn't shoot him 
they would be courtmartialed, and they shot him; they killed 
him. 
And two days later we sprung Bernard Barker. Then 
he came to my office and he said, "I want you to tell me what 
I can do to help bring down the monster who murdered my best 
friend." And I took him over to the American embassy and introduced 
him to the CIA agent there. And that's the way he started working 
for the CIA,

a list. here of four recommendations that I made well before 
I joined the project, based on my personal assessment of the 
situation in Cuba. Now, I made this in 1959, and I will list, 
them. . 
The first recommendation I made was (inaudike due 
to network technical difficulty] to destroy the Cuban radio , 
and television transmitters before or coincident with the Cubani-
The third was to destroy the island's microwave relay System 
just before the invasion begins. And the fourth: discard any, 
thought of a popular uprising against Castro until the issue 
has aleeady been militarily decided.

in Cuba at the time of the electton here in order to understand ' 
why these 'people went into the'--' went into Watergate. And 
I want. to just -- let me go back to the Bay Of Pigs. just for 
a second. 
The Bay of Pigs'wS% a struggle that took place, in 
Washington, not in Cuba. It was a struggle between the liberal 
presidential advisers on the one hand and the conservative CIA 
and the Pentagon on the other. In between these two broups 
was the new President, who had never been accused of lacking 
either intelligence or courage, but he sided' with his liberal 
advisers. And the key point in this invasion was the destructio 
of Castro's tiny- aieforce on the ground before the, Invaders

hit the beaches. This was to be done- by three air strikes of 
sixteen planes each coming from Nicaragua to the south coast 
of Cuba. Forty-eight sorties minimum. They knew where Castro's 
planes were. These were being watched by American reconnaissance, 
by the U-2. 
What happened was this. The first strike of sixteen 
planes was cut in half by orders from the White House. The 
second strike was cancelled entirely. The third strike, after 
It was too late to call off the invasion, was cancelled entirely. 
So that instead of having forty-eight sorties minimum, you had 
eight. And they destroyed almost all of Castro's air force 
on the ground, but Castro was left with three jets, two Sea 
Furies, and they commanded the skies. The Cuban freedom fighters 
were flying from Nicaragua three and half hours to the beachhead 
and they had twenty minutes or thirty minutes over the target 
and than three and a half hours back. I thought of that yesterday 
when I fleW from Hartford here. Seven hours to be over the 
target for thirty minutes at the most. And Castro's jets, which 
were fueling nearby, flew in -- two -- two at the same time 
and -- and -- and slaughtered them. 
) BUCKLEY: What dies' this have to do with Barker? 
LAZO: It has a great deal to do with Barkers because 
Barker was one of the high-level men in the invasion, and he 
saw this thing happen by orders, decisions for disaster, taken 
In Washington, and he was -- I don't know what the word is --
absolutely humiliated by what happened. He can never forget 
this. Barker is a great patriot from the point of view of the 
United States, but he loves Cuba too. And he saw that Cuba 
? had been betrayed; I use the word deliberately. The Cuban brigOe 
on the beach was betrayed. They had been told that they would ' 
? have continuing supplies to the beach. They never got any supplie

LAZO: Here's what it has to do with Barker. But 
let's let's come now to November of last year, at the time 
of the election. Now we know about the Bay of Pigs and we know 
how Barker felt about that. We also have to know something 
about conditions in Cuba last November. You don't know much 
about that, because the attention of .the Americans was -- is 
focussed on Southeast Asia. Cuba's not in the news. But Castto 
Is now facing the greatest crisis that he's ever faced. And 
everything's going against him. His regime is coming to an 
end. s 
To understand this you must remember that when he.. 
came to power the: Cubans were among the better-fed people of 
the world. That's not Lazo speaking; that's the Department 
,of Agriculture in Washington. And today. everything is rationed --

was four million, whichis what Cuba made. fifty years ago,. and:'

LAZO: Yes. 
BUCKLEY: But go ahead ?now and relate that, please,

LAZO: Yes. Well, the point is that this year he'll

their money crop. That's the way they get their moneY to import

However, here is Castro in November, 1972, knowing

surviving is to get recognition and help from the United States. 
He can't get that from the Republicans: His one chance was '

BUCKLEY: 
.E'xcu'se me. 
?LAZO: it's all right. 
BUCKLEY: So you can enter into this, Mr. Hunt, since 
we're not talking about Watergate. Is it your point that because 
Cuba -- and how would this sound inside the inner councils of 
CIA -- that because Cuba is vulnerable to American pressure 
? in a sense that the Soviet Union is not, therefore it makes 
tsense to take a ?hard line with Cuba even whilv we're taking 
a soft line towards the Soviet Union? 
HUNT: Yes, that makes sense "to me. Castro Cuba, 
of course, is a client state of the Soviet Union. And I think 
it's a ?matter of record among people who study Latin American , 
affairs that Castro has been a somewhat less than,satisfactory 
iclient of the 'Soviet Union... 
BUCKLEY: Insufficient servility? 
HUNT: Insufficient servility. Following the Cuban 
missile crisis there were a great many .problems. He felt himself' 
lin a sense abandoned by the loss of his Russian military advisert. 
,The Soviet Union itself, of course, is undergoing a time of 
ttremendous economic stress. The mere fact that they signed 
;/1 wheat and corn deal with the United States would indicate 
Ithat they are having trouble not only fulfilling their internal 
needs, but this means less for their client states, such as '. 
'the Arab world, Egypt in particular -- the United Arab Republic 
and Cuba. Cuba is very small potatoes as far as the Kremlin 
ks concerned, 
LAZO: Of course it is. 
HUNT: The death of Che Guevara in effect put an end 
to the type of guerrilla activity that Castro had been promising 
and promulgating throughout the hemisphere.

it to be, how can you say that they consider Cuba to be small

that you afford as a subsidy for a small potato cliebt state, 
LAZO: Well, there... 
BUCKLEY: If it were situated in mid Africa, or something 
like that, they probably wouldn't pay a million dollars; they 
wouldn't be worth it. But situated where they are now, it is 
an important lesion in the Caribbean basin, isn't it? 
HUNT: It's quiescent. It's quiescent at the time. 
On the other hand, we have no reason to believe that there are 
not Soviet military emplacements in Cuba in a state of readiness. 
We don't know. There have been no American or international 
observers who have ever, gone there. 
BUCKLEY: Why doesn't the CIA know? 
HUNT: I would say because of post Bay of Pigs restrict-
ions on the degree, the parameters of intelligence activity 
directed at the island republic. 
BUCKLEY: In other words, an American citizen is not 
entitled to rest confident that the CIA knows whether there 
are, or there are not, massive Soviet offensive weapons burred 
in Cuba? 
HUNT: No,. he's not. 
LAZO: What was your answer to that? 
HUNT:. No, he is not. 
BUCKLEY: Now, is that-- are you making a technical 
aspersion on CIA? 
HUNT: No, I am simply saying that as in any government

Obviously Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, the entire southeast Asian ' 
picture has monopolized most of the American military and intelli-

HUNT: And the men and the resources available for 
;focusing on Latin American problems accordingly were reduced. 
iC1A hasn't been hiring very much in recent years. It's been , 
'Cut back. They have had to absorb within their own ranks budget 
[deficiencies. Whenever a new line of activity, support activity, 
develops in another part of the world -- and again I go back 
to Southeast Asia -7 the funds have to come from somewhere. 
They come, generally speaking, from Latin American activities. 
Certainly U-2 overflights of the island republic have been cut 
back. They were, in any case, after the Bay of Pigs turned 
over to the Air Force. The U-2, which CIA developed and utilized 
to successfully for so many years, was taken out of the agency's 
hands and put in the hands of the kir Force. 
There has been a tendency I think within the entire 
government to do nothing, or if anything is done at all it is 
to provide the appearance rather than the substantive action. 
And accordingly,! answer your initial question in that sense, 
BUCKLEY: So that it isn't that it couldn't/be done... 
HUNT: Right. 
A -3UCKLEY: It's that we haven't given it that kind 
Hof priority. 
HUNT: We may not, to my knowledge. And, after all, 
I retired two years. ago, two and .a half. years ago, from CIA.. 
. At that time, I myself was not confident that there 
were not missiles or ether offensive weapons in Cuba, ? placed 
there by the Soviet Union. . 
BUCKLEY: Well, is it ? when Senator Kennedy says, 
"Loot, let's, for God sakes, go ahead and recognize Cuba, having 
first engineered the consent of the Organization of American 
iStates, on the grounds that not to do so, given our current

LAZO: These were very highly trained men. And this

So counter-intelligence. Secondly, trying to find 
out about the security leaks. And then, of course, as you know, 
there were rumors that there were going to be riots at the Repoli,. 
lican convention. They would have liked to have known about 
that, too. 
So there're very good reasons for this. And politics 
is a dirty business. You know that. The Americans all know 
that. McGovern in his campaign accused -- he compared Nixon 
to Hitler on three occasions publicly, the Nixon government 
to the Hitler henchmen. And that's the communist line. In 
Cuba today whenever Nixon's name is printed in the government 
papers, the way they print it is N-I -- the swastika -- O-N. 
That's the communist line. McGqvern was doing that. And this 
kind of thing is not a parlor game..' It's not tiddly-winks. 
It's...

the United States government? 
LAZO: Not necessarily. 
BUCKLEY: Why not? 
LAZO: Because they could have been doing it with 
anti-Castro Cuban money. That's possible. 
BUCKLEY: But counter-intelligence operations are 
usually done in behalf of a government, aren't they? 
LAZO: I don't know, and you don't know where the 
money was coming from.

Justice Department is acting perversely in prosecuting people 
who plead guilty to breaking American laws. 
LAZO: There are some things which rise beyond --
above that: love of country. Let me put it this way. I feel 
that I'm in the presence of a great man sitting here, one of 
the great men of our time. You know, when we left Cuba, my 
wife and I, we left with two dollars. To lose everything that 
you've made your entire life, at the end of a long life, is 
very bad. To lose a friend, the way Barker lost his friend, 
the way this gentleman recently lost his wife, is much worse. 
But when you lose honor, you lose everything. And he hasn't 
lost -- and these men have not lost their honor, as far as we 
believe. And I can assure you that the six hundred and fifty 
thousand Cubans in this country have the highest regard for 
'them. Don't you be concerned. We're going to help you in every 
way we can. And you still have your honor. That's the important 
thing. 
BUCKLEY: Well, but it's only important I thint for 
'you, Mr. Lazo, to acknowledge that, paradoxical though it may 
'sound, the pursuit of honor can require temporal punishment. 
LAZO: .Yes, it can.

the Justice Department and the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 
would cooperate with .the Sen-
ate investigation of political 
eavescliopping at the Demo-
trade National Committee't 
'Watergate headquarters. ' 
, kleindienst said , the 
"only reason" for holding back 
any records of the. Govern-
meet's Watergate inquiry would 
be the passibility of prejudicing 
St pending *court case or the 
fact that the material was un-
reliable and pnssibly damaging 
tocinriocent persons. ' ? 
The Attorney General told 
reporters at a breakfast meet-
ing that the investigation to 
be headed by Senator Sam J.

thing." ? 
"The judicial system is net 
the best place to explore all 
the- ramifications" of political

The Nixon Cabinet officer 
acknowledged freely 'that he. 
exthanged information arid

Hotise, but he denied that the 
President or any of Mt. Nixon'S 
'aides had attempted to inter-

/ By Eric Wentworth 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
Rep. Edith Green (D-Ore.) 
said yesterday that the U.S. 
Office of Education bought it-
self a "political headache" last 
June by renewing a public re. 
lations contract involving 
Watergate figure E. Howard 
Hunt Jr. ' 
, In a House floor speech, 
IVIrs: Green said an Office of: 
Education contra c t review' 
board approved the renewal at, 
Its June 21 meeting despite 
knowing of Hunt's being im-
plicated In the Watergate ease, 
and despite lack of competi-
tive bidding and the absence 
Of contract documents. 
The contract with Robert R. 
Mullen and Co., datinehack to 
1969 reportedly before Hunt 
joined that public relations 
firm, ' carries a eumulative 
price tag of nearly $750,000. 
The Mullen firm's major mis-
sion has been to etimelate 
nubile interest in educating 
handicapped children. 
Office of Education officials 
recalled that Hunt setved, in

Saying that "all the facts 
have not been developed by ei-: 
tiler side," Chief U.S. District 
Judge John J. Sirica inter-
vened in the questioning of a 
key government witness in the 
Watergate bugging trial yes-
terday to ask him the name of 
a person to whom he ad-
dressed logs of illegally tap. 
ped telephone conversations., 
The witness, Alfred C. Bald-
win III, repeated that he could 
not recall the name. During 
subsequent testimony Baldwin 
said the person had a first 
name like a last name and a 
"German-sounding last name." 
At one point, Baldwin testi-
fied, he picked out a name 
from an FBI list similar til" the 
name of a Nixon campaign 
aide. But that name "wasn't 
picked as being the person," 
Baldwin said. 
Sines repeatedly has said 
that he intends to find out 
who else?if anyone?was in-
volved in the Watergate inci-, 
dent. He prefaced his ques-
tioning of Baldwin by assert-
ing that it was "perfectly 
proper" and that he was not 
"accusing anybody of any 
wrongdoing" by asking the 
questions. 
The questioning t?'f'curred aS

the' Re-election of the Pres!, 
dent,- James W. McCord Jr: 
and G., Gordon Liddy, are on 
trial on charges of conspiracy,. 
burglary and illegal wiretap-
ping and eavesdropping in. 
connection with the June 17 
break-in at the Democratic NA-
tional Committee's Watergate 
headquarters. Five other 'men,' 
consultant E. Howard Hunt 
Jr., already have pleaded. 
guilty' to the charges. 
Baldwin testified Friday, 
that ordinarily he hinted over 
to McCord the logs of tele-
phone conversations he moni-
tored in the Democratic Party 
headquarters from ft hotel 
across the street. On one occa-1 
sion. Baldwin testified, Mc-
Cord instructed him to putl 
some logs in an envelope, put 
-a name on -the front and de-
liver it to A guard at the re-
election committee headquar-?, 
ters. 
, Asked Friday if he could re-
call the name, Baldwin said he 
Could not. Asked if he knew, 
of his "own personal knowl-
edge" who got the logs, Bald-
win said he did not. 
Baldwin. returned to the wit-
tiest; stand yesterday for cross-
examination, Under question-
ing by McCord's lawyer. Ger-
ald Alch, Baldwin testified 
that he was monitoring the 
telephone conversations under 
the impression that what he. 
been given immunity froOli 
prosecution to testify, said he; 
had this impression because 
several factors, Including cor-
respondence McCord had', 
'shown him with the Federali 
Communications Commission! ... 
and that MCCord worked for 
the re-election committee, .. 
"And wasn't another one o, 
the factors," Alch asked, "yottE, 
knowledge that your surveil' 
,ance was in some way ton.) 
nected with secdrity?" 
"Connected with ' security' 
and. to the people it Was going' 
, . 
to, that is correct," Baldwinreplied. ? 
Alch has cotrded that Me,. 
Cord was involved -in bugging 
the Democratic headquarters 
but asserts that the bugging 
was legal because It Was lin-, 
tended to find out about poss0'; 
ble violence aimed at the- re...

'of memory as to`the name 'or 
that party?" Sirica asked. 
"The first interview ;With 
the -F131, I believe, we sent 
over several names at that 
time and we went over several 
'names thereafter and the only: 
thing I can recall is when the 
name was, given me?the first 
liame?V assumed it , was the 
last narrie," Baldwin said. 
"What wail :the first name 
given you?" Shies asked.' 
"I used the reference Glenn, 
because a friend of mine, his 
last name is Father Glenn," 
Baldwin said, "and I used that 
as a reference and we tried to 
establish the name of the indi-
vidual." ? 
Sirica did not pursue the 
point but later; under cross-e* 
amination by Liddy's lawyer, 
Peter Maroulls, Baldwin ex. 
Panded his explanation, saying 
he "wrote the first name down 
Its being the last name . .? 
Then T was given the second 
name that. I could not snell 
and as I recall It was a Ger-
WASHINGTON STAR

Man-sounding naerth."'' 
Baldwin also said In talking , 
to the FBI he "used an anal. 
ogy" when he suggested the 
name was Glenn. Glenn, Bald-
win said, "was not the ,name;? 
It was just 'given as an anal. 
Maroulis . asked Baldwin if 
he remembered telling two 
'Los Angeles Times reporters 
during an interview that in 
one session with the FBI, 
'agents had read names to him 
and he had picked' Our the 
name "Sedan." 
? 
"It wasn't picked as heing, 
the person," Baldwin replied., 
"It was one ,of the . names% 
picked that we pulled' out: 
from. a group of, names td, 
think about." ? - 
? "Mr., Baldwin," lMaroulis 
asked? 'did You know at the 
time that you mode that state-
ment to The 'Les' Angelei 
Times that there waS a man' 
named Glenn .Sedam who 
worked for the Committee to 
,k-elect the President?", 
Five of the Watergate de-1 
tfendants now have pleaded . 
f?guilty to conspiracy; burglary ? 
hand illegal wiretapping and 
i'eavesdropping. ?? ? 
That in itself is hardly the, 
1,stirprise of the year, consid-
'iering that the last four to: 
;admit 'guilt were caught with 
t heir trousers at half mast. 
Even though the five who 
'have admitted their guilt 
:could get ? prison terms of up 
to 55 years; even though they 
,luive admitted to one of the 
? most sordid and serious as-, 
? ,eaults on our system of free 
elections in this nation's his-
tory there is' something dis-
quieting abput their confes-
sions. 
? It is difficult to escape the. 
feeling that these confessions 
flow out of a new conspiracy 
? to ensure that no trial ever 
. Occurs . where the American 
people will learn the whole 
? truth about who ordered the 
burglaries, the espionage that 
`incredible corruption of our 
election precesses. 
; The suspicions ,wallow, like 
Maggots. on an August (lay, 
that the Confessors are sacri-
ficing themselves, honorable 
'to .their understanding that 
? ,"if you are caught, the sec-
? retary , will disavow your so 
lhat the public will never 
';knOw. 
just how far into gov-
ernm cut the rottenness 
:reaches.' 
'1 had read it - in the 
newspaper; prior to that I did 
not," Baldwin said. Maroulis 
then turned his questions to 
,another subject. ' 
In other testimony yester-
day, M. Douglas Caddy, a 
tWashington lawyer, testified 
that on the morning of 'the 
break-in Hunt called him on 
the phone and- visited him if 
his apartment to arrange to 
retain a criminal lawyer% 
Caddy also testified that he 
Spoke with Liddy in the earlY,,i 
Morning hours of June 174 
shortly after police had ar-
rested McCord and four other 
men inside the Democratic 
headquarters, and I.,iddy re-
tained Caddy to "represent 
him in this case." 
' Caddy said Hunt had called 
him between 3:05 and 3:15 
a.m., approximately t h 
Same time that Baldwin 'said 
Hunt made a phone tall froin, 
Baldwin's hotel room After 
;Baldwin testified he saw Hunt'

' 
from the fact 'that Liddy r?

could consider the.. time atuir

, Caddy said later that 'hel

' 
, but More h Just a Ca 
, 
Maybe the tragic death of 
his wife in a plane crash did 
Motivate the guilty plea of E. 
'Howard Hunt Jr., the former 
Central Intelligence Agency 
,operative` who was working 
as a White House consultant 
and apparently masterminded 
the political spying. 
Maybe grief did convince 
Huntthat he could not undera 
go a lengthy trial. 
But how do we understand 
those guilty pleas of "the 
Miami four "?Bernard L., 
Barker, Frank Sturgis, Eu-
genio R. Martinez and Virgil-
io II. Gonzalez? 
' 
, Is it just that they were 
caught red-handed in Demo-
cratic party headquarters at 
'about 2:30 a.m. on June 17 
"and that they have admitted 
guilt on a certain assumption 
that any jury would find 
them guilty? Well, why did 
their lawyer, Henry Rothblatt, 
refuse to represent them in 
the guilty plea? What's with. 
all this cryptic talk by Roth-
blatt about his ex-clients 
"following orders" in "a rad. 
Rau fashion"? , 
Then there is the spectacle 
of Judge John J. Sirica ac-
cepting the guilty pleas and 
then trying futilely to get 
?"the Miami four" to tell him 
the whole nasty truth even 
when the four were not under, 
oath. 
' Barker had wound up with 
$114,000 in his bank account,' 
but for the life of him he 
just couldn't' tell 'the judge' 
a thing about who gave it,to; 
him. ? 
"I don't believe you," the, 
judge said to Barker, thusl 
putting himselfalongside 
millions of Americans who, 
long 'ago were convinced that 
the money came from Nixon 
campaign funds. 
The judge apparently had,? 
? read the newspapers and, 
knew about all the rumors 
that higher-up culprits in this 
bit of political criminalityl 
'gave "the Miami four": 
enough money and promises; 
to' induce those confessions, 
? Sirica wondered about all 
legations that someone was, 
still paying the four. No, no,; 
no, they replied.' 
The judge then asked them 
point-blank whether anyone 
suggested they might get 
"executive clemency or, 
commutation of sentence," 
or to put it less delicately, 
whet h er President Nixon. 
would spring them from priv, 
on if they kept their mouths 
Shut and took their medicine, 
like loyal but lousy spies. ? ? 
They produced more har. 
liicony than a barbershop qUar-' 
tet ? as they chorused, "No,. 
your honor.', ? . 
It is still too early to regard 
this courtiown drapla,as.the 
er 
'great cover-up. Still to RAI 
trial are James W. McC..rd 
Jr. who was Security come'. 
inalor of the Committee fort

the White House and on the' 
re-election comMittee, W 
'shall see whether they ever 
testify under oath, and hoe; 
zealously the prosecution' 
probes them for the full: 
truth. 
Then, 
Judge Sirica lies 
tough reputation of handing 
out rough sentences. Not only, 
will his sentences be watched, 
closely, but the media and a 
lot of other Americans wilt 
keep a long eye peering to, 
Ward the day when the White' 
House starts fumbling withr 
the key to the prison.

that McCord had given him 
17 memoranda concerning-Mc-

cate" that McCord had set 'up 
a 'listening post in the How-

Liddy and McCord are on

ming from the June :17 break-
in at the Democratic Party

'summary financial statement 
and turned it over to Stana:. 
Sloan said he "destroyed the 
?eitsh book" -containing actual 
records of disbursements. 
Sloan first gave his account 
of his hallway conversation 
with Liddy under questioning 
from Silbert, and said he did 
not know what Liddy was talk-
ing about. He repeated it when 
Sirica sent the Jury out and 
questioned Sloan himself. The 
judge then asked Sloan how 
Liddy was to use the money 
_Sloan had given him earlier. ,

; f struck any current agency oi orations? i 
our had strong ties; others suggested,  
the suggestion being that I and !-
McCord might have reactivate; net-
work they remembered from tti?ir i 
ernment cloak-and-dagger days. 
that the defendants were still getting: 
money from the same source that had 
ifinanced the Watergate operation from 
1the start?presumably the secret coffers 
I of the Committee for the Re-Election of 
the President. But NEWSWEEK learned 
I that a new fund, to provide financial 
;support for the defendants, was set up 
after their arrest by some well-heeled 
;Republicans who hoped to limit further 
embarrassment to the party by short-
circuiting the trial. 
The defendants weren't saying. The 
I:latest to bow out?Bernard L. Barker, 
'Eugenio  Martinez, Frank A. Sturgis and 
1Virgilio P. Gonzalez?first fired their law-
yer, Henry Rothblatt, who had insisted 
; on a trial, and then codessed ? almost 
eagerly to the charges of conspiracy, 
! burglary and wiretapping (maximum 
sentence: up. to 55 years in jail and 
$50,000 in fines). Under questioning by 
; Federal Judge John J. Sirica, with the 
; jury out of earshot, they claimed only 
that Hunt and Barker had convinced 
them that the Watergate caper was 
somehow related to the fight against 
Communism and Castroism, This, osten-
sibly, was enough to. appeal to the 
anti-Castro sentiments of the defendants; 
two of them, Martinez and Sturgis, had 
:been involved along with Hunt and 
Barker in the CIA-directed Bay of Pigs 
operation. But who had, financed the es-
capade? Barker maintained that expense 
:money .was mailed to him in unmarked 
envelopes, and he therefore didn't know 
the source. "Well, I'm sorry," said the 
frustrated judge, "I don't believe you." 
The four also denied receiving any 
outside support after their arrests, or 
promises of help in return for pleading 
guilty?but NEWSWEEK learned other-
wise. Several reliable Washington sourc-
es said that the defendants were reCeiv-
.ing at least part of their current .funds 
from Republican moneymen eager to 
minimize the GOP's embarrassment. "As 
, I understand it," one insider told NEWS-
WEEK'S Nicholas Horrock, "the kitty did 
? not reflect approval of their acts, but 
, simply a desire to do what they could 
to relieve the party of the embarrassment 
of a long and messy trial." . 
! Pensions: I3eyond that, Horrock 
learned that five of the seven defendants 
Duress: In court, attorneys for the 
two remaining defendants?McCord and ; 
G. Gordon Liddy, a former FBI man and 
White House staffer?called for a mis-
trial. The jury, they argued, could not ! 
remain unprejudiced after the unex-
plained disappearance of so many de-
fendants. But Judge Sirica turned them 
,down and then attorney Gerald Alch ' 
1disclosed that he planned to defer4 
McCord with the principle of "duress" ?i 
a chancy strategy based on McCord's I 
supposed fear that pro-McGovern leftists I 
were planning violence against top Re-' 
pyblicans "including but pot limited to. 
., the President." Said Alch: "If one is un- I 
der a reasonable apprehension?regard- ! 
less of whether that apprehension is in ! 
fact correct?he is justified in breaking a 
law to avoid the greater harm." 
Legal experts scoffed, noting that du-
ress is usually accepted as a defense only ; 
in extreme emergencies. Even if there ; 
were a plot, attorneys said, McCord ! 
could easily have turned the matter over 
to the authorities. Alch's defense was 
"aimed strictly at the emotions of the 
jurors," said One former Justice Depart- . 
ment attorney. "If he can get to one of ; 
them who's deathly afraid of rioting left- ! 
ists, he might get a hung jury." 
The jury was permitted to hear bare-
ly half of the proceedings. Jurors did ' 
hear a young plain-clothes man describe 
:the arrests inside Watergate ("ICeep.cool 
?you got us," said Sturgis, hands in the 
air). But they trooped out of court again 
as lawyers bickered over the testimony ? 
of former FBI man Alfred C. Baldwin, 
who admitted listening in on some 200 
Democratic telephone conversations. The 
government wanted Baldwin to describe 
the contents of the calls in order to sup-
port a possible blackmail motive. But - 
some of the wiretapped Democrats ob-
jected that their privacy was being in-
vaded, and the U.S. Court of Appeals

.27 JANUARY 1973 
CC;ininittee Fined $8,000 
By Timothy 
Washington Pos 
The Finance Committee tot 
Ile-Elect the President pleaded' 
Ito contest yesterday in 'US.' 
bistriet Court to eight viola-
tions of the elections financing 
law, and Was fined $8,000. 
!' It was the first time that a 
campaign committee had been 
found guilty since mailing 
of financial reports first ? 
be-
tflme an offense under the 
Corrupt Practices Act df 1925.. 
By entering a plea yeSter-? 
day, the finance committee 
avoided having to account for 
how it Spent the unreported 
money or to respond to ? any 
evidence presented by the 
Justice Department. 
"I've never seen the differ-
once between a nolo conten-
dere (no contest) plea and a 
guilty plea," said U.S. District 
Judge George L. Hart Jr., in 
fining the committee the maxi-
mum of $1,000 on each count. 
No individuals were charged 
In the complaint, so a possible 
onc-year jail term was not ap-
plicable. - 
The charges were the first 
hi be brought under the Fed-
eral Elections Campaign Act, 
which took effect April 7, 1972, 
and cited cash financial pay-
ments through the committee's 
treasurer, Hugh? W.. Sloan , Jr., 
to its legal adviser, G. Gordon 
Liddy. . 
Liddy is a defendant hi the 
;Watergate, trial. Testimony 
has indicated that he received 
more than $232,000 from the 
commtttee for various assign-
ments. 
The complaint charged spe-
cifically that Sloan gave $12, 
000 to Liddy on two different 
occasions In May and June, 
1973, without obtaining re-
ceipts or keeping required rec-
ords on the purposes for which 
the money was spent. 
Also listed in the complaint 
Is $5,300 given to Liddy after 
May 10 by Herbert L. Porter, 
scheduling director of the 
committee. Porter has testi-
fled In the Watergate trial 
that he gave Liddy a total of 
$85,000.

ply ,with -Certain sections of a 
toniplex new law., It" is the 
policy of this,, cointratee to 
fully cOniply with all election 
laws. We have always sOught 
to do so." ? 
The Justice Department cam 
plaints, known technically' , as 
criminal informations, grew 
out of a General Accounting 
Office report in August that 
charged the committee with 11 
apparent or possible violations 
of the Federal Election Cam-
paign Act. 
At the time of that report, 
Maurice Stens, finance corn, 
,mittee chairman, denounced. 
It as "incomplete and inaccu-
rate" and said it "reaches 
false and unwarranted conclu-
sions.' 
"We are gravely concerned 
that this report, with its sug-
gestively reached conclusions, 
has impugned the Integrity: 
and good 'name of several in, 
dividuais who have not, itif 
our opinion and in the opin-
ion of legal counsel, violated' 
any provision of the ? law,"; 
Stens added at the time. -; 
Attorney Kenneth Parkin-
son for the eommittee would 
not comment further on the 
no contest plea yesterday, 
Government attorneys indk 
cated they were surprised by 
the plea. , 
Judge Hart, asked what al-
ternatives were open to him 
at the time of the plea, said 
he could only accept or reject 
it,/ and that the maximum fine 
he imposed couldn't' have beohl 
More at the end of a lengthy',1

r Special to The New York Times 
: WASHINGTON Jan, and the United States Attorney. 
Demands for the appointment 
, of a special prosecutor in the 
' Watergate ease began a week 
after five men were caught in 
pemocrotic headquarters on 
June' 17. , ' 
r Some of the demands were 
, overtly political; others , ap-
peared nonpartisan. But al-, 
.ways there was the question 
of how vigorously the Depart-' 
Ment of Justice, would pursue 
' a 'case in which several Presi-
dential aides were involved! 
and in which others?perhaps 
, of higher rank?might be lin-
plicated. . 
! That question has come up 
again, implicitly but forcefully, 
as the trial of two remaining 
defendants charged with con-
spiracy, burglary and eaves-
dropping moves toward a , 
!.climax in the United States 
District Court here. 
,Doubts Intensified. 
Whateter doubts may remain 
in the public mind seem to 
have been intensified particu-
larly by the actions of Judge 
John J. Sirica,, who has pre-
sided over. the three weeks Of, 
the trial. 
Judge Sirica has said on a 
number of occasions?most re-
'cently on Friday?that he does 
not mean to "'haply anything" 
ot to rebuke either the Gov-
ernment, or the defense for its 
handling Of the case. 
But he has also shown dis-
satisfaction 'with the ?questions 
asked by the prosecution and, 
to a lesser extent, the defense, 
and he has examined witness 
-
us himself. His tone with them 
Mei often been incredulous. 
, The lawyers arc most inter-
ested in a precisely drawn, 
eight-count indictment, which 
seven men were accused of 
committing specific violations 
of the law during a limited 
period of time. 
' 'There Are Limits' 
, "This isn't the Warren Com-
mission," said an attorney who 
Is familiar with the Watergate 
'case but not directly inovoived 
In it. "When you get to the 
trial, there are limits to where 
you can go." , 
The scope was to a large 
extent settled, the attorney and 
Other sources said, by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation 
diningt.he grand jury inquiry, 
'that produced the current in-
dictinents on Sept. 15. . 
The difficulty in assessing 
the secret grand jury decision. 
on how far the conspiracy 
lwen and who should be 
dieted was demonstrated vivid-
ly on Friday when Judge Snide 
raised as an issue the, credi-
bility of a major Government. 
witness, Hugh W. Sloan Jr. 
Mr. Sloan had resigned as 
treasurer of the Fit/Ince Com-
mittee to Re-elect the Pre& 
dent after handing G. Gordon 
Liddy, a former committee of-
ficial who is now a defendant,, 
$199,000 in campaign funds. 
, Judge Sifica questioned Mr. 
!Sloan with the jury not pres, 
ent and appeared skeptical' 
about some of the answers; 
which included a statement 
that he had "no idea" what 
had been done with the $199,1 
000. 
The Government , asserted 
that Mr. Sloan had had noth-
ing to do with the. Watergate 
affair, and Seymour Glanzer, 
one .of the prosecutors, invited 
the judge to examine the F.B.I.. 
reports and the grand jury. 
transcripts. 
' But Judge Sirica said he 
would concern himself ,only 
with "the lestimoey in this 
courtroom." The testimony he 
.'has been hearing deals almost 
exclusively with the narrow in-
dictment and not with the wider 
questions in the case, such as 
whether the break-in at the 
Watergate office building was 
part of a wider espionage effort 
and whether anyone beyond 
those indicted knew about. or 
profited from the spying. 
Magruder Questioned 
Jeb Stuart Magruder,. who 
served as deputy director of 
the Committee for the Re-elec-
tion of the President, was ques-' 
tioned by the Government 
about various intelligence as
he had given to Mr. 
Liddy. 
The "major" assignments, Mr. 
Magruder said, involved learn-
ing the plans of ? potentially!

at campaign appearances around

TRIALS 
The Spy in the Cold 
"Well, I'm sorry but I don't believe! 
you," said Federal Judge John J. Sirica.1 
He was addressing four of the Water- ! 
gate defendants, and what he did not be-
lieve was their claim that they could 
not remember who had supplied them , 
,with money. Even sums as high as 
$114,000.. they said, simply turned up 
un brown manila envelopes from none 
knew where. Despite the judge's sharp 
questioning. the four insisted last week i 
on pleading ignorance?and guilt. That ! 
reduced the number of defendants from I 
seven to two and also reduced the like-
lihood that the trial would ever disclose; 
who sanctioned the conspiracy to bug 
Democratic Party headquarters last1. 
June. 
The four?three of whom are Cu-! 
bans from Miami?were talked into1 
pleading guilty, TIME has learned, by. 
the same man who recruited them into 
the conspiracy in the first place: E. . 
Howard Hunt, the former CIA officiali 
who had pleaded guilty himself a week' 
earlier. Hunt promised his four confcd-i 
crates that unidentified "friends" would' 
offer each defendant up to $1,000 for 
every month he spent in prison, with 
more money to be,paid at the time of t 
his release (TIME, Jan. 22). 
The guilty plea by the fotir defen-
dants staved off a prospective court-1 
room uproar?testimony that Hunt had 
told them the Watergate bugging had 
been approved by the White House. spe- ? 
cifically by two presidential advisers 
?former Attorney General John 
Mitchell, then head of the Committee1 ? 
for the Re-Election of the President. 
and Charles W. Colson. who at the time 
was. on the White House staff as spe-
cial counsel to the President. 
Castro. Hunt's influence over the ? 
four dates back to 1961, when Hunt ; 
was !a leading CIA official engaged in 
. planning the Bay of Pigs invasion of . 
Cuba. At that time, the four men were 
convinced that Hunt spoke secretly for 
I the U.S. Government; apparently .they 
still are. In 1972, when Hunt recruit-
cd them into the Watergate conspiracy, 
1 he grandly told them: "It's got to be 
done. My friend Colson wants it. Mitch-.? 
ell wants it." Colson is in fact an old 
! friend of Hunt's; it was he who got 
Hunt onto the White House staff in 
1971 as .a $100-a-day consultant. Hunt 
also told the four that their old enemy 
, Fidel Castro was sending money in- ;. 
,!directly to the Democratic Party in ! 
? the hope that a McGovern victory 
!would soften the U.S.. attitude toward 
;Cuba. 
After the Watergate arrests, Hunt 
, became more cautious, referring to Ad-
ministration officials merely as "my , 
; people." lie insisted that his people . 
were prepared to put tip plenty of mon-
ey for the defense of the arrested men. 
Of the $35,000 Hunt is known to have 
received from his people, however, only ! 
about $8,000?or $2,000 apiece?has 
!reached the four defendants. Vet the: 
four men do not appear to be displeased; 
1with the arrangement. To have worked, 
with Hunt. one of them told the 
.court, had been "the greatest honor." 
? 
"Under the spreading chestnut tree.

hold you and you sold me." In an inter--
view with TIME Correspondent David 
Beckwith, E. Howard Hunt quoted 
those mocking lines from George Or-
well's 1984, and then he added defen-
sively: "There was none of that in any 
.operation I ever ran. Nobody above or - 
below me was ever sold out. I protect 
the people I deal with." 
! Hunt, a remarkable storyteller (who. 
.has written some 46 novels as well as 
an account of the Bay of Pigs fiasco ' 
?called Give Us This Day), decided to 
:talk because "I've been taking a real 
beating in the press. I've been portrayed 
as an irresponsible adventurer, a des-
perado. And bring a photographer. The 
!pictures of me at the trial have made 
me look like a buffoon." For legal rea-
sons, he refused to say much about the 
, Watergate trial, but he reminisced free-
ly other adventures. 
"Let me tell you a story," Hunt de-
'dared. "The last wartime operation I 
was involved in was an air resupply op-
eration in central China. We had a five-
man guerrilla team that hadn't been re-, 
;supplied for months', so we went 
I parachuting supplies out of a C-47 to 
!them in a rice paddy. I went along as a 
!cargo kicker, holding onto the chute 
; wire and pushing the stuff out in a hur-
ry from about 600 feet. Two of us were 
hit in the face by flak on the way back, 
and one later got caught by the Japs 
and skinned alive, but the point is this: 
A team out on an unorthodox mission 
expects resupply, it expects concern and 
attention. The team should never get 
I ? 
the feeling they're abandoned. End of i! 
Istory." . Hunt M . . makes no effort to hide his I 
1  
own sense of abandonment. "Nobody 
has invited me anywhere for six 
months," he says. "My family has been 
harassed, my kids are teased and taunt-
ed at school. Most of my old CIA friends, 
; people I worked with for years and 
? thought I was close to, have cut me' off. 
I had lunch last week with my daugh-
ter at a club in Georgetown and saw a 
, CIA officer who worked for me in Ja-
pan. He looked right through me." 
Secure. Speaking of the death of 
his wife In a Chicago plane crash last: 
' month, Hunt insists that the mysterious 
; 
$10,000 she was carrying in $100 bills' 
was to have-been invested "in a newt 
business enterprise Out there, a concern 
? that might have provided me With a job 
after I got out of jail." Turning a bit 
maudlin, he remarks: "I've often wished 
that it had been me .on the plane in-' 
' stead of my wife. The Watergate would 
have been over for me. My family 
' would have been financially secure. And 
i; the four children would have a mother !-? 
? instead of a father wasting away in jail." 
! At another point, as he spoke of trying 
to explain his situation to his nine-year-
old son, he wept. Still later he referred 
to himself as "a fish at the erid of a 
line; I'm struggling hard, but it looks 
like a pretty strong line." 
Hunt joined the CIA in 1950 after 
having served in the Navy and the OSS 
!during World War II, worked as a LIFE 
'correspondent in the South Pacific, won ! 
.a Guggenheim fellowShip in creative ! 
'writing and sold a movie script (Bimini 
Run) to Warner. Bros. for $35.000. He 
is proud of his 20 years in the CIA,.: 
though he feels "the agency" has. treat- , 
ed him badly of late. "When they iden-
tified me as a former CIA officer right 
after the Watergate arrests," he says, ' 
"they abrogated our agreement of ? 
confidentiality." 
As a member of the agency's "De- . 
partment of Dirty Tricks," he worked 
on. the operation that overthrew the 
Communist-supported Guatemala re-
gime of Jacobo Arbenz in 1954. After 
the coup, he recalls, "Arbenz and his 
? people were stripped naked at the air-.. 
port and searched before they were al-
lowed to leave. One of his aides was Che 
Guevara. If we'd let our Guatemalans! 
start to shoot them, as they wanted, ' 
there's no telling when the shooting ; 
would have stopped. It was a close de- ; 
cision, and I have often wondered how 
effective Castro would have been with- ! 
out the intelligence of that asthmatic lit- ! 
tle medical student from Argentina." 
On his years in espionage, Hunt re-
Elects: "You sees our Government trains 
people like myself to do these things ? 
and do them successfully. It becomes a 
way of life for a person like me." Of- ! 
ten he traveled under assumed names, 
says Hunt, "to preserve plausible deni-
al," the phrase rolling from his lips so ; 
smoothly that it sounds like an agency 
cliche. Again and again he returns to ! 
the theme of an officer's loyalty to his 
subordinates: "If your people are 
caught in an operation, you do every-
thing you can for them. Money is the 
.cheapest commodity you've got in an !. 
operation like this." 
Hunt retired from the agency in 
1970. "The Bay. of Pigs," he says bit- ! 
terly, "really ended my chance for sub-
stantial advancement within the CIA, be
cause I was associated with it and the ,? 
thing went sour." In 1971 he was asked, 
to join the White House to plug secu-
rity leaks. "It wasn't a petty operation. ? 
There were major leaks involving the - 
SALT talks, operations in India. One leak 
resulted in the extermination of one of . 
? our agents in Asia. The Administration , ? , 
couldn't stand for that, and I worked ? ? 
closely with the CIA trying to stop it." 
Why did he get mixed up in the Wa-
tergate ease? Hunt admits that he had ; 
!a political motive. which Ile dresses up ' 
rather elaborately. "There is a built-in 
bias by the intellectual community, in-
eluding the news media, against people 
who want to preserve the best of our 
. country's heritage. As for me, I dont 
Want to exchange the good of this coun- . 
! try for the uncertainties of change." 
Hunt also has a more practical expla-
', nation for his involvement: "I was not - 
; aware that my activity constituted a fed-
eral offense. I never personally went 
into Democratic offices, and I thought 
!' the most they could get mc on was sec- ? 
ond-degree burglary.' 
; Hunt insists that he never thought ' 
! much or the Watergate scheme in the -(!'? 
? first place. "1 cased the situation thor-
oughly, and I'm good at it. I appraised 
; the risk lin bugging Democratic head- ! 
! quarters) as very high and the potential 
' return as very low. I recommended ; 
against it. but it wasn't my decision: I 1. 
can tell you this: if it had been a CIA op-
trillion and I'd been in charge, It new 
would have happened,"

e The .disclosure came as loth 
sides rested, today in the trial 
of the two remaining defend-
ants in the Watergate .case. 
Well . placed Administration 
sources italic, said that "Justice
Department-, officials learned of 
some of Mr. Segretti's activities 
within weeks after. the Water-
gate arrests last June :17,ebu 
decided on the basis of, pre 
ilininary 'interviews, with Mr. 
Segretti that his activities were 
legal and therefore beyond the 
scope of an extensive F.B.I. in-
quiry: ? 
e That decisioreWas reaffirmed 
last October, the sburce said, 
after newspaper accounts indi-
cated the full ?scope of Mr. 
Segretti's activities, which were 
said to have involved sabotage 
'Attempts ? against Democratic 
tandidates during the primary 
election campaigns. 
It was further ? learned that 
-Mr. Segretti began his opera-
tions, Apparently on behalf of 
Some White House officials, as 
early as September, 1971, at 
'about the same time E. Howard 
Hunt, then a White Rouse con-
sultant, reportedly began organ-
izing his political intelligence 
team. ? 
, ? Mr, limit's operation eventie 
I.ally' led- to the unsuccessful 
'break-in at the Democratic 
1National Committee offices in 
!the Watergate' office ceinplee 
here. ? e 
? Mr. Segretti Is knewn to havd 
:met at. least twice with Mr. 
iHunt, in Florida and in Cali-. 
;knee and he was once asked 
? 
. to help arrange a fake demon-
stiation during the Democratic 
National Convention. 
Sources said,, however, that 
the Justice Department had 
made no effort to determine the 
full extent of Mr, Segretti 
ne.tivities or to find out wile 
placed Mr., Segretti in commit 
with Mr, Runt. . 
White House officials' have! 
repeatedly said that they did' 
not , know either about Mr., 
"Segretti's espionage operation' 
Or the political intelligence ace, 
tivitles headed by 'Mr. Hunt 
and G. Gordon Liddy. a former 
totinsel to the Republican re-
election committee. ? . 
However, Dwight L. Chapin, 
.President Nixon's appointments 
secretary, was reportedly asked? 
to leave his White House job 
after the November electiciff, 
'apparently because he:: was 
named .last year as the White 
House contact for Mr. Segietti. 
Ronald L. Ziegler, the White 
House press secretary, silbse-
quently confirmed that Mr. 
Chapin was leaving. Mr. Ziegler, 
denied that Mr. .Chapin was 
being fleeced out or that his 
decision had anything to do 
with the espionage controversy,' 
Before last October's news-
paper reports about Mr. Se-
gretti, three top Justice Depart= 
Ment officials publicly declared 
that every possible lead was 
being investigated in the Wa-
tergate case. ? e ? 
In a news conference Oct. 
5, the last one he held, Pres-
ident Nixon depicted the F.B.I.' 
inquiry into the Watergate 
case as so thorough and come 
pieta that it made the 1948 
Congressional investigation of 
Alger Hiss look "like a Sunday 
School picnic." ? 
"Let's look at what hap-' 
petted," the President said. 
"The F.B.I. has assigned 133 
agents to this investigation. It 
followed out 1,800 leads. It 
conducted 1,500 interviews. I 
wanetd every lead carried out 
to the end because I wanted 
be sure that no member of the 
White House staff and no man, 
or woman in a position of, 
major responsibility had any-
thing to do with this kind of 
reprehensible activity." 
But officials of the Justice 
Department and F.B.I. acknowl-
edged in recent interviews that 
investigations early in the sum-
mer and in the fall of Mr. 
Segretti's activities were cur-
sory at best, and the two 
agencies blamed each other for 
the lack of action. 
"The cut-off came just when 
Segretti went underground; 
after the newspaper stories on 
him broke," one F.B.I. official 
said. 
He added that the decision to 
call off the inquiry had come 
from the Justice Department's 
Criminal Division. 
"That's a matter of legal 
judgment" with which the 
bureau did not officially 
quarrel, he said, "but I suspect 
that there was discontent at 
lower levels." 
Henry E. Petersen, chief of 
the Criminal division, refused 
to discuss the Justice Depart-
ment's investigation in an in-
terview, but one well-informed 
official categorically denied 
that the F.B.I. was "called off 
on anything," 
"The bureau called up and 
said, 'We're pot doing any-
thing on Segretti," the Jus-
tice Department official relat-
ed, "and asked, 'Do you see 
anything in this?'?" - 
At this point, Mr. Petersen 
A Democrat who was named 
Assistant Attorney General last 
year, queried the Justice De-
partment's Fraud Division, the 
official said, and also found no 
support for a full inquiry 
on Segretti. 
"He had no affirmative rec-
ommendations from anybody 
on this," the Justice Depart-
ment official said. "If he had, 
he:wouldn't have called It off." 
Attorney General Richard. G. 
Kleindienst, told' newsmen last 
Oct. 24 that no inquiry into 
the activitiet of Mr. Segretti 
was planned "because as of 
right now, Any evidence that 
has come to us would not-in-
dicate the violation of a Fed-
eral law." ? ' , 
In a series of interviews, a 
number of toast and present 
Justice Department officials 
argued that even without any 
immediate evidence of wrong-
doing, the Government -had an 
'obligation to investigate fully 
the activities of Mr. Segretti. 
One Justice Department law-
er'noted that the department 
had' special 'procedures for 
cases involving organized 'crime 
figures or major political fig-
ures. 
? "You look at everything 
When you have a case like 
'this," he said.' "It should be 
fully 'explored in all its ramifi-
cations even though it may 
appear not to be a. criminal 
,violation."  
e Other sources noted that the 
:published reports of Mr: Se-
'grettrs alleged operations de-
scribed a number of ostensibly 
Illegal activities, including the 
forging of campaign letters and 
the promise of future political 
rewards in return for pre-
election support. 
In addition, Mr. Segretti was 
said to have been paid with 
funds 'from a Republican fund 
totaling at least $350,000 that 
May have been collected in 
violation of campaign finance 
disclosure laws. 
Lawrence R. Young of subur-
ban Los Angeles, one of Mr. 
Segretti's close friends, has told 
many newspapers that Mr. Se-
great said that Republican offi-
cials permitted hint to review 
his F.B.I. dossier. Shortly be-
fore testifying before a Fed-
eral grand jury about the Water-
gate case. Mr. Young also 
quoted Mr. Segretti as having 
said that Presidential aides 
coached hint before his grand 
jury appearance. 
At least '19 long-distance 
calls were placed front Mr. 
Segretti's telephone to Mr. 
Hunt's between mid-March and 
June last year, and at least one 
such call was placed to the 
home of Mr. Chapin. 
Many other friends and for-
inter associates of Mr. Segretti 
have been traced by newsmen, 
usually through long-distance 
telephone toll reports, and have 
publicly told of having been 
approached by the young law-
yer and asked to participate ill 
a large-scale espionage and 
sabotage operations against the 
Democratic party. 
Administration officials have 
consistently discounted such 
reports as hearsay and unprov-
able rumors. ' 
Mr. Kleindienst challenged 
reporters last year to "get the 
evidence to me that would in-
dicate that a specific person 
has violated a special criminal 
law and my department will in-
;vestigate it. 
? But in a series of interviews 
over the last two weeks, for-
mer friends, and associates of 
Mr. Segretti said that they had 
Bet been contacted by the 
"rm inland, just abeolutely 
'Oland thatsthey never celled 
,me," said Mr. Young, "'a law-
yer. "I was so sure they were 
coming I even had a -speech' 
Iprepared." ? -' ? . *. e 
: Among the things the bureau 
Would have learned, Mr. Young 
bald, was that Mr. Segretti ? had 
told him of a Miami meeting 
With Hunt in which Hunt "men-
. hioned hiring Cuban refugees to 
lpose as McGovern support, 
and tear up the inside of eth 
Doral Hotel," the Miami Beath 
hotel to be used by Mr. Mee

The prosecution in the,

;Democratic Party, a man "not

'Nixon campaign aide.. 
Prodded by Chief U.S. Dis-
trict Judge John .I. Sirica, the 
prosecution closed its case, the 
.defense opened and closed its 
..ease in a matter of hours and, 
final- arguments were begun ; 
yesterday?the '15th day of the' 
trial. The case is "expected to' 
; go to the jury today. 
Liddy's lawyer, Peter Mar-
:, oulls, told the jury in a brief 
opening statement that Liddy 
had had a "shadow of guilt" 
cast on him from ?E. Howard 
Hunt Jr., a former White 
House aide who earlier 
pleaded WRY to the same 
? charges of conspiracy, bur-
glary, and illegal wiretapping 
,:and eavesdropping for which 
Liddy Is on trial. "I intend to: 
Show this shadow is without 
Substance," Maroons said. 
, Liddy and his .codefendant, 
lames W. 'McCord Jr., both of . 
whom worked for the Commit-
tee for the Re-election of,the 
President 'before the JUne 17 
? break-in at the Democratic Na-
..tional Committee's Watergate 
:headquarters, are the only two 
:tt emitInIng defendants of the 
'Seven, Including Hunt, ,origi-
Approv 
natty indicted. Four other men 
besides Hunt, all from Miami, 
also have pleaded guilty. 
As Maroons was delivering 
his opening statement, assert-
ing that both the prosecution 
and defense concede that Lid-
dy's superiors at the commit-
tee "are on the safe side of the 
line of innocence," Sirica in-
terrupted him 
"Walt a minute now," Sirica 
said. "Who made that 
concession? Mr. Silbert (the 
chief prosecutor)? You are ar-
guing what you think the evi-
dence is. This is for the jury 
to decide." 
MorOulls had asserted that 
'deputy campaign director Jeb 
Stuart Magruder, scheduling 
director Herbert L. Porter, ad-
ministrative director Robert 
C. Odle Jr. and campaign 
treasurer Hugh W. Sloan Jr.?
all re-election Committee offi-
cials with whom Liddy had 
freqUent contact?"are with 
out involvement and Of course, 
had no criminal intent." : ? 
Shim said that if the jurors 
,"decide that Mr.. Magrudet or, 
Mr. Odle or Mr. Sloan are in-
volved in this alleged conspir-
acy, they can do it. However,. 
they're not on trial. I ? Will 
grant you that. They ? (the 
jurors) can draw 'their own 
conclusions from the evidence

who pleaded guilty entered 
their plea, Sinks attempted to 
question each of them to :de-
termine whether anyone other 
than the; .seven persons in-
dieted was involved. 
As a legal matter, however;; 
the jury can do nothing more 
in the case than decide the 
guilt or innocence of Liddy 
and McCord. It is not ,the 
function of a jury in a crimi-
hal trial to formally diclose 
any findings beyond a verdict 
or to recommend further at-
tion at the conclusion of a 
trial. . . . 
Liddy afid McCord, will

tify yesterday concerning 
their character and reputation 
in the community. Each of the 
six witnesses testified that the

She was testifying had an ex-

received to conduct activites

$24,000, Silbert said, is "the' 
money we have traced into the

sons from Miami." 
Referring to McCord, also a 
former FBI agent and a for-
mer CIA employee; Silbert 
said, "Isn't it sad. Former FBI 
agent, isn't it sad, directing 
the interception of telephone 
conversations." 
The "proof of guilt it to 
overwhelming," Silbert told' 
the jury, "that the only vet-

side's would be a verdict of 
guilty on all counts in which.

trial, gave one final wave to 
the spectators and press be-
fore he 'was led away. 
Prineipal Assistant U.S. At-
torney Earl J. Silbert said, af-
ter' the verdict was returned; 
that it was "fair and just." 
In hit final statement to the 
jury, Silbert told the eight 
'women and four men that 
"when people cannot get to-
gether for political purposes 
without /fear that their prem-
ises will be burglarized, their 
conversations bugged, their 
phones tapped . . . you breed 
distrust, you breed suspicion, 
you lose confidence, faith and

Silbert asked the jury to 
"bring in a verdict that will 
help restore the faith in' the 
democratic system that has 
been so -damaged by the con-
duct of these 'two defendants 
land their coconspirators." 
Despite repeated attempts 
by ,ludge Sirica to find out if 
anyone else besides the seven 
defendants was invelved in 
the conspiracy, testimony in 
the trial was largely tonfined 
by the prosecution to proving 
its case against Liddy and Mc-
Cord, with occasional mention 
made of the five who had 
pleaded guilty, ' The jury, 
which was --, sequestered 
throughout the, trial, was' 
never told of the guilty pleas. ' 
When Hunt pleaded guilty 
clan. 11, Stiles questioned hirn' 
in an attempt to find out if 
anyone besides the persons in-
dieted was involved in the con-
spiracy. 
_Hunt's lawyer, William 0. 
'Dittman, blocked Sirica's ques-
tions, saying the prosecution 
had told him it intended to 
tall Hunt and any other de-
fendant who was convicted to, 
intify before the grand jury. 
An apparent purpose of re--
rieWed grand jury testimony 
Would be to probe the invOlve..

now intended to take, Silber 
said, "I don't think I'll cormil

'Were arrested, with McCord,, 
by Washington Police in the

the arrests marked the be-
'ginning of the Watergate Au-
?? 
These five men, dressed in 
business suits, ,and wearing 
tubber surgical gloves, had 
electronic bugging equipment 
and sophisticated cameras and 
film. In their possession or 
their t'ooms they had $5,300 in-
$100 bills.

Near the end' of July, it was 
learned that:the finance coun-

hp refused to answer -FBI 
'questions about the Watergate 
bugging and break-in. The 
counsel was Liddy, a former 
Treasury and White House 
aide who was the other de-
fendant to remain in the trial:.

, The conviction of two of the senior ufficialt lit Pres1.1 
dent Nixon's campaign organization for criminal con-',; 
,spiracy, burglary and wiretapping of the Democratic t; 
'National Committee's Watergate headquarters proves 
!that this sinister operation was no trivial escapade byl 
.Unimportant persons. It was pati of a larger, far-flung. 
',well-financed plan to use political espionage and sabo,1 
,tage techniques to disrupt and defeat the political op*: 
4sition. The intrusion of these police state methods intoi 
'domestic politics is witho'ut precedent and deserves the; 
mOst thoroughgoing exposure and condemnation. 
The White House has dissembled again' and again in,: 
a ,frantic effort to divert the searchlight ?of publics 
suspicion from its own responsibility for this ugly busi2 
rites& But thanks to the courage and tenacity of Chief, 
';judge John J. Sirica of the United States District Court 
'who presided at the Watergate trial, the public now haa 
?on record sworn testimony that former Attorney General'. 
John N. Mitchell, the President's campaign manager, and; 
; former Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stens, Mg?

?Mony from Hugh W. Sloan Jt., the former' treasurer ()ti-
the Committee for the Ite-election of the President, afteri 
the prosecutor in the case had unconacionably failed WI 
.do so, 
Mr. Sloan also testified that one of the convicted 
'defendants told him after the police made the Watergate2, 
:arrests: "My boys got caught last night. / made a mis-
take by using somebody from here, which I told theme 
would never do." 
' That testimony was not contradicted, hut neither didl 
, Mr. Sloan explain who was meant by "them." It is tt 
(fair deduction that senior White House aides as well Etat, 
Herbert W. Kalmbach, the ?resident's personal lawyer.1 
not only had knowledge of this repulsive operation buts! 
also planned it, recruited agents for it, and received', 
their reports. 
Dwight L., Chapin, President Nixon's appointment 
secretary, has been forced to resign because he has beerici 
publicly identified as the White House contact for onei,

:last week to lawyers for the prosecution!: 
and the defense. 
.??. ?.; 
' Twice Sirica ordered the 
'jury from the courtroom after 
the prosecution's examinaAon 
of key witnesses and then 
questioned them himself about 
? matters not probed by the 
prosecution. 
.On Jan, 15, during the trial's, 
'second week, Silica addressed 
four of the defendants aftert 
they had pleaded guilty snd 
outlined some of the issues he 
said he .expected to be devet-
,operi in the courtroom'. Sirica 
said that the jury is "going to 
wonder who, if anyone, hired 
you to go in there, if you were: 
. ? 
"I am just assuming that. 
.they (the jury) will be asking 
themselves these questions,'!. 
? Siriea 'continued as the four: 
men stood before him. "They. 
are going to want to know if 
there are other people, that is, 
'higher-ups in the Republican 
, Party or the Democratic Party; 
or any patty who sic men-
tioned, or who are involved in' 
',this case and should be in this.

"The question will arise, tin 
doubtetily, what was the ma-

soy you did," Sitica 
'They will want to know 
where. this money enme from, 
who was the money man, who. 
did the paying off. ... They are 
'going to want to know a lot of 
things before this . case la 
? over." ? 
Those questions could have 
? ,been posed to witnesses from 
three sources-government, at-
torneys representing the ores-. 
LO Hired pies and Wli 
ecution, lawyers for the ,de-
'feriae and the judge. 
When the trial of the last

McCord Jr., the former secur-

Nixons' re-election committee

-
lion remained ' Unanswered, 
'During cross-examination of

attorneys quite expectedly' 
have not pursued the lines of 
Inquiry, suggested by Judge' 
Sirica. 
,r 
? The government,, for ; 
'part, acknowledged that It' 
knows the answers to many of 
the judge's questions but can' 
tends they are more inferenA 
tial than legally conclusive= t? 
And therefore should not have' 
been raised by the prOsecutten 
during the trial. 
Last FridaY, Sirica rejected; 
the prosecution's suggestion, 
that he read the Secret 
Airy inintites of the Case ?de: 
find the answers to' some of, 
'.his questions, and said he 
Would continue Personally 
interrogate witnesses when he 
felt it necessary. ! ? 
He then ordered that testi-
mony obtained by his own 
questioning of S key witness 
outside the presence of the; 
jury, be read to the 12 mem-
bers of the jury. 
That testimony revealed 
that former Secretary ot Com-
merce Maurice H. Siam,' fi-
!Mince chairman of the Nixon 
Campaign, and former Attor-
hey General John.N. Mitchell, 
the President's campaign man-
ager, 'both had verified that 
deputy campaign director Jeb 
Stuart Magruder had author-
ity to approve cash payments 
,to Liddy for an intelligence 
,gathering operation. 
The grand jury's 'indictment, 
which was drafted by the 
three prosecutors and ap-
proved by their superiors in 
the Justice Department, dealt 
only with the activities of the 
'seven original defendants and 
was limited to allegations the 
'government believed could be 
conclusively proven In court. 4 
it mentioned none of the un-
dercover activities that the 
prosecutors previously char-
acterized as "improper" and 
"despicable." hat which, they

. Former White House aide F. 
Howard Hunt Jr. pleaded 
guilty in the trial's fourth dny, 
and. the four Miami men at% 
rested imide the Watergate on 
June 17 followed his lead twO 
'days later. 
When the five detendanth

it was no longer legally per.

Since the guilty pleas were, 
entered, the prosecution did 
not call about 10 persons on 
Its witness list who could have 
testified about matters relatl. 
lug to. the five men. 
'It did not -call Hunt and the. 
four others who pleaded guiltY, 
As witnesses against the two.

"The truth will conte out,", 
the judge. declared Mat Tuesf ?

'added: "I hope it will come' 
out larthis case. And if I think, 
should ask questinns  
bring out additional facts thati 
haven't been developed, 
shall continue to do so.' 
? That afternoon, Sirica ques-
tioned Hugh W. Sloan Jr., the' 
?former treasurer of the Cont' ? 
mittee for the lie-election ot, 
the President, about the au-,_ 
thorization of large. cash pay-: 
ments to Liddy?then finance;

According to investigatort 
end the prosecution, Sloan had 
no prior knowledge of the' 
Watergate bugging .or any, 
other-espionage akivitiee 
agains the Democrats. He' 
quit his job when, sifter June 
17, he learned! that money he . 
had been disbursing was used!, 
for clandestine operations, in-
vestigators have said. 
In response to his original: 
questioning by the proseenl 
tion, Sloan testified TuesdaY': 
that he paid Liddy $199,000 on" 
orders from Jeb Stuart Magru-
der, then deptuy director of

, Earlier; Magruder had teal'

1109,000 cash payments td, 
Liddy for purposea of setting' 
up an "intelligence network", 
Which, Magruder sail, would 
Use only legal methods to ob-
tain information. 
Neither Magruder nor Sloan 
was asked by the prosec3tion 
who had authorized the? 
payments to Liddy or who else; 
might have known about the:

Sloan: No Sir. I was merebf 
authorized to do so. I was not 
told the purpose. - 
Sirica:: Who authorized yoti 
to turn the $.109,000 oyer 
Mr. Liddy in cash? 
Sloan: Jeb Magruder. 
Silica: For what prupose? 
Sloan I have no idea'. . 
Sirica: You didn't quesiiati 
Mr. Magruder about the pur;; 
pose of the$199,000 
Sloan: No sir. I verified with 
Mr. Stam and Mr. Mitchell' 
that he was authorized to 
make those.' ' ' 
SiriCa: You verified it .with 
who? , 
Sloan: Secretary Stans, the 
finance chairman, and f didn't 
directly, but he verified it with 
John Mitchell, the Campaign 
Chairman. 
Sielea: This $199.000 tould 
be turned over to Mr. Liddy is 
what you are:saying? 
Sloan: Not the svcifie 
amount, hut Mr. Magruder, his 
authorization .was autheriza. 
lion enough UP turn over' the 
sums in question. 
As is customary of -govern-
tneilt ? witnesses in criminal 
trials, Sloan had been told in. 
Advance .bY the prosecution or 
what he Would .generally be' 
asked on the witness stand by: 
the. government. When Sloan 
had been questioned by the 
prosecution about the $199,000 
payments and Other morley 
Liddy was authorized to re, 
eeive, the relevant .exchangei 
Went this. way: ? 
Prosecutor: Did there come: 
k time in the end of March or 
Carly April when you had a' 
conversation with Mr. Liddy 
about: dash disbursements to 
him?, ? 
?Sloan: Yes , . . Mr. Liddy 
Came to me indicating that he 
was being authorized consid-
erable allocation of cash 
funds. Itched with him at that 
time what seemed to br, 
budget which he did , not iihow 
to me other than-the figures 
On R. It totaled 1250,000. The 
first, disbursement he indi.. 
cated he would need fairly. 
shortly would be $83,000 with 
'roughly $12,000 disbursements 
following. 
? Prosecutor: After Mr, Liddy, 
gave you this informal inn 
about the budget, the $250,000; 
and the disbfirscment. relating 
to the $83,000. did ydn' check 
that With Job Magruder? 
Sloan: Yes I did. ? 
Prosecutor; 1V}int did lie tell 
you? 
Sloan: He Indicated that 
this budget w-is in fact--this 
allocation was th fact nuther-
Ized to Mr. Liddy. Ile loth-
tated, however, that he wished 
In each specific ,instance ? to 
Clear the amount and the. tim. 
Ing of the distribution. 
The' testimony of, Sloan tO. 
Sirica was different from the 
',interrogation by. the prosecu-
tion in other key respects. S1r:1 
lcai unlike the prosecutiOn,:1 
asked Sloan why he left the 
Nixon committee and was told 
he quit because of the Water9 
gate incident and ". ' the' 
internal situations that:existed/ 
in the committee at the time.".'" 
Sloan alsd.gave a different: 
'account to the judge of what, 
Liddy had told .him 'the daY, 
police had arrested' five 'then: 
Inside the Watergate on, June 
17. ? 
When asked by the prOseetr-
tibry what Liddy had said 
Sloan answered: ?"1-le said to: 
the best of my recollection,: 
,'My boys got caught last night.: 
4 made a mistake: Used 
somebody from here, which' t 
said l'd never do. I'm afraid 
am going to lose my job.',". 
When Sirica questionedl 
Sloan, he gave 'essentially' the 
same account but changed the,: 
phrase, used somebody: 
from here, .Which I said I'd? 
never 'do," to "I made a mis-? 
take by using somebody from\ 
here, which 1:: bald them I, 
would never do." ? '! 
? 
Sloan, however, was not 
asked whether he knew Who 
Liddy meant by:"them." ' 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Earl, 
J. Silbert; the chief prosecutor' 
In the case, told' Sirica later: 
Meat "there was nothing in Mr... 
Sloan's testirnony that was a 
surprise to us or-that We didl 
not know." . 
Silbert 'presided over the 
grand jury that, investigated' 
the Watergate bugging andy 
the prosecution received the' 
F131's field reports in the case.' 
lAmong ?them were report? 
describing interYiews with the 
four officials of President Nix., 
on's re-election, committee 
who testified in the trial Ttica-
day.' The four,-,who also ap7 
peared before the' grand jury,, 
'were Herbert L. Porter, sched, 
tiling director of the -Nixon 
campaign; Robert C. Okle, di-
rector of administration; Ma, 
gruder, and Sloan. All are ex-
White House aides. ? 
? Federal investigators" have 
'told The Washington Post that 
as much as $750;000 in Nixon 
campaign funds was expended 
on espionage and sabotage op., 
'erations aeninSt. the Demo-
crats and that Mitchell, 'Ma., 
gi?tufer, Porter and titans were 
among' high campaign and. 
While House officials who had 
authority to receive or ap-
prove such cash payments 
from Sloan. 
Neither Judge Sirica nor the 
prosecution asked any of the! 
Nixon committee officials on 
Tuesday whether they knew:of 
anyone in addition' to those 
four persons who received or 
approved such payments. Nor 
were they asked 'whether the 
money received by LiddY was 
the only cash Sloan disbUrsed 
fer elatititatine operations. 
Among such payments, ac-
Cording to' federal investiga-' 
tors; were at least $25,000 to 
Magruder; and a minimum of 
$35,000 to Herbert W. Kalm-
bach, President Nixon's per-
tonal lawyer and until April 't 
the deputy finanae chairman 
Of his re-election campaign. 
Investigators reported that 
Kalmbach, who Was also inter. 
viewed hy,the FBI, gave the 
money to a California attor-
ney, Donald Segretti, to spy 
im and disrupt the priMary 
ampaigns of various Demo, 
cratic presidential candidates. 
The nanie ?,'of Segretti, who 
also was interviewed by the 
'FBI and appeared before the 
Watergate grand jury, was 
struck from the !prosecution's 
proposed list of vitnesses at 
about the same time, that the 
government learned that How, 
and 'Hunt wanted to plead 
guilty. 
?According to federal investi-
gators, Segretti was recruited 
to participate in spying and 
sabotage operations by Dwight 
L. Chapin, President Nixon's 
appointments secretary, and 
reported on his activities to 
both hunt and Chapin. 
Testiniony either from or' 
About Segretti, who federal in-
vestigators say was not in-' 
'Volved in the Watergate bug,' 
iging but received other under.. 
!Cover assignments from Hunt,' 
might have dealt with some of 
'the broader questions ,Judge 
Sirica said he wanted an.: 
swered at the trial., 
' In an account lly The Los 
Angeles Times, Assistant U.S. 
;Attorney Silbert is repotted to 
have said that Segretti "would 
',have to he tied in with some-
:thing Illegal" to be called as a 
'witness, and that there is no 
evidence he broke any laws. 
"Silbert agreed in an inter-
view that allegations about 
Segretti, if true, could place 
the Watergate case in a larger 
perspective for jurors," The 
Times account Said,. 
Many of the broader issues 
posed by Judge Slrica t were 
explored in detail by the FBI, 
particularly in its questioning 
of the four Nixon committee 
officials who testified Tues-
day. Among the questions cov-
ered by the !FBI, but not 
raised at the trial:were: 
.? Who conceived the origi-
nal idea for the "Intelligence 
network" mentioned by Ma-
gruder in his testittiony, And 
who gave final approval to the 
plans? According to investiga-
tions, the decision to under-
take undercover operations 
against the Democrats was 
made in the White House as a 
basic strategic element of the 
President's re-election cam. 
paign and the plans were di; 
rected by presidential aides at;

By MARTIN ARNOLD 
Special to The New York Vines 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19?The Pentagon paperS trial, ip 
'only the second day of testimony, went right to the heart 
today of the defense's legal position: That much of the 
spring of that year could have 
helped Hanoi plan last year's 
Tet offensive. 
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and Ah-
bony J. Russo Jr., the defend-
ants, are accused of stealing 
eight pages Of the summary of 
the document along with the 
Pentagon papers themselves 
memorandum, and, by impli-
cation, making them public, an 
act that the general said was 
directly harmful to American 
troops in Vietnam and, there-
fore, the country's national 
defense. 
The defense elicited that Gen-
era Depuy himself had helped 
edit the document that the 
printing office sold. That docu-
ment was entitled "Report on 
the War in Vietnam: Com-
mander in Chic? Pacific: Com-
mander U. S. Military Assist-
ance Command Vietnam?' 
The comparisons were ittade 
through the use of slides that 
Material contained in the top 
Secret papers had long been 
lit the public domain. 
The defense presented in 
Court a United States Govern-
Ment Printing Office publication 
that WAS available to the gen-
eral public for 56 a copy 
early in 1969. The defense 
pointed out that it contained 
Much of the tame information 
that the prosecution contends 
injured the national defense 
When it was made public, in a 
different form, at a much later 
dat.e. 
?It was the second day in 
which Lieut. Geo. William G. 
bePuy, a prosecution witness, 
Underwent cross-examination 
by the defense. Yesterday, and 
again today, the general insist-
ed that a 1968 Joint Chiefs of 
Staff memorandum on the ef-
fects of the Communist Tet 
Offensive in Vietnam in the 
"responded: - l'rdr a ""defitliti

' 
Later ,Sirieri said., "i On

'geld he. got the money "in the 
'Mail', in a blank envelope." ' 
kThen, according to the:04, 
dial chilli transcript, :the fetit

if they were coercedt to plead

asked if they were ..gtillty-t,t6, 
each Of the 'seven charges, in 
the Indictment against them. 
? On Monday, ''..Judge Shit*, 
questioned Alfred' C. Baldwin 
III, it former FBI, agent and 
?? 
key prosecution witness whb 
testified that he . Monitored 
Wiretapped telephone calls St 
defendant McCord's instruc-
tion. In earlier testimony, Bald-
Win said that McCord% usually 
Ireceived the logs of the mein. 
flared ? eonversationt, but: that 
once 1,in June McCord %had 
were shown to"the Jury. 
Thus, the 1968 Joint Chiefs 
of Staff memo, which General 
Depuy said was dangerous to 
make public, said this: 
"He [the enemy] committed 
over 67,000 combat maneuver 
forces plus perhaps 25 per cent 
were impressed men and boys, 
for a total of about 84,000." 
The general said that this in-
formation, in the Joint Chiefs 
report, which was written in 
the latter part of February, 
1968, could help Hanoi evalu-, 
ate American and South Viet, 
nam intelligence, and was "sem, 
sitive" even now, in . his 
opinion. 
But Leonard Weinglass, an 
attorney for Mr. Russo, using 
a slide, showed that in the 
report sold by the Government 
Printing Office early in 1968, 
Geri. William C. Westmoreland, 
Commander of the Army in 
Vietnam, had written, and Gen-
eral Depuy had helped edit, 
this statement: ' 
"The let offensive Was ex-
ceedingly costly to the enemy 
throughout the country. Be-
tween 29 January and 11 Feb-
ruary the Communists lost 
Isome 32,000 men killed and 
5,800 detained, out of an esti-
mated force of 84,000." 
The 1968 Joint Chiefs of Staff 
memo said, "Probably the only 
major unit to escape heavy 
losses was the 7th NVA fNorth 
Vietnam Army] Division. How-
ever, present dispositions' give 
the enemy the continuing capa-
bility of attacking in the Saigon 
area with 10 to 11 combat el-
