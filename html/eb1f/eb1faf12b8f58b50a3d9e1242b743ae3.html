 Divorce, Chinese Style
 It has long been an open secret in China that
 Chiang Ching is not popular with most leading party
 Oofficials.  This year she has finally been dealt a
 series of especially staggering blows that have left
 her virtually powerless in the cultural field she has
 dominated for nearly a decade.   Her recent misfortunes
 also raise serious doubts about her present and fu-
 ture role in politics.   Significantly, Mao himself has
 been personally associated with these moves against
 g,q his wife, and it is now widely accepted in China that
 / Lfthe Chairman has all but washed his hands of her.
 Madame Mao's star has dimmed since her failure
 Qto win a government position at the National People's
 Congress in January.   This failure has been attri-
 buted to Mao, who reportedly vetoed her nomination to
 3),4 more than one government job.   Moreover, throughout
 the year, Mao has apparently stepped into the cultural
 arena to mediate disputes, in each case siding with
 beleaguered artists accused by his wife of political
 errors.   For example, he added to the list of people's
 congress delegates the name of a performer purged
 during the Cultural Revolution and nipped in the bud
 a potential witchhunt of artists whose paintings al-
 legedly contained political errors.
 This summer, Mao lifted a ban imposed by Chiang
 Ching on the distribution of a documentary film on
 J      the life of China's model worker.  Madame Mao claimed
 the film contained numerous political flaws.  Mao,
 after reviewing the case, reportedly said the film
 had been unfairly criticized and ordered that it be
 widely disseminated.   A document to this effect is
 currently circulating within China.
 Most importantly, Mao personally authorized the
 rehabilitation of several leading cultural officials

 who were among the earliest purged and most viciously
 f attacked during the Cultural Revolution.  These offi-
 cials stood directly in the way of Chiang Ching's at-
 tempts to revamp the cultural sphere, and their return
 cuts sharply into her influence in that area.           These
 lge' people have not yet appeared in public, but a large
 number of their associates appeared for the first
 time since the Cultural Revolution at National Day
 celebrations on September 30.
 The Mao-endorsed rehabilitations are the latest
 9 in a series of signs that Chiang Ching is being
 nudged out of her cultural role.   The propaganda has
 not mentioned her in a cultural context since last
 April; Peking has sponsored numerous theatrical fes-
 tivals highlighting the appearance of new cultural
 ~" works, thus diluting the impact of the handful of
 "model" works produced under Chiang Ching's auspices;
 and evidence is mounting that the cultural portfolio
 now belongs to Politburo member Chang Chun-chiao.
 Chang has hosted several cultural delegations since
 this summer, and officials in the Ministry of Cul-
 ture reportedly have admitted that he is in charge
 1  of culture.
 Mao and his wife have evidently crossed swords
 on issues other than culture.  The Chairman reportedly
 chastised her for trying to make a full-scale cam-
 paign out of the "back door" issue, i.e., pulling
 strings to obtain favorable jobs.  For the second
 time in as many years,  in fact, Peking issued a di-
 rective deferring action on the back-door problem
 until an unspecified later date.
 Chiang Ching's behavior when left alone with
 foreign visitors seems to be an especially sore
 point.     Mao reportedly was outraged when he read the
 transcripts of his wife's interview in 1972 with
 American sociologist Roxane Witke.  Chiang Ching told
 Ms. Witke at the time that the transcripts would not
 be released until the Chinese leadership had approved
 them; Ms. Witke was officially informed some months
 later that she would not receive the transcripts.

 Madame Mao's last solo outing with an official
 visitor was a year ago, when she hosted Mrs. Marcos
 of the Philippines.   That incident ultimately caused
 the Chinese some embarrassment.            Mrs. Marcos was ap-
 parently led to believe that Chiang Ching would be
 Mao's successor, and, after the establishment in June
 of diplomatic relations between Peking and Manila,
 the Philippine government apparently tried to show its
 appreciation by naming an orchid after Chiang Ching.
 1-3 Peking had to politely request that the orchid be re-
 named to commemorate Sino-Filipino friendship.
 Incidents such as these may have been behind the
 six prohibitions on Chiang Ching's political activity
 that Mao reportedly set out in a document recently
 circulated within China.   The document allegedly pro-
 hibits Madame Mao from meeting with foreigners alone,
 from making speeches without prior party approval--and
 from meeting with Mao.
 In an apparent variation on this theme, stories
 have been making the rounds in China that the Polit-
 buro wants to reactivate its resolution of the 1940s
 that approved Mao's marriage to Chiang Ching on the
 condition that she not be allowed to participate in
 politics.   Rumor also has it that Mao wrote his wife
 a harshly worded letter early this year in which he
 suggested they go their separate ways.
 In any case, the word is out to the Chinese
 people that Chiang Ching does not have Mao's support.
 This deprives her of a powerful weapon that she has
 used in the past and could have been expected to use
 after Mao's death, namely that opposition to her is
 tantamount to opposing Mao, that she is the sole
 repository of Mao Tse-tung thought, and that others
 in the leadership have distorted Mao's policies.   She
 cannot credibly make that claim today, and, more im-
 portantly,  she will not be able to do so in the post-
 Mao era. Thus her hands are tied politically, for
 now and in the future, unless she manages to find
 another avenue to promote her ambitions.

 Ironically, it was just a year ago that Madame
 Mao, using historical analogy, seemed to be making
 a case that she was the logical successor to Mao.   She
 has come a long way down since that time.  This is not
 to say that the left wing of the party, which she rep-
 resents, is politically dead.  Chiang Ching's views
 have a constituency throughout the country, and she
 personally may still have supporters in the cultural
 field.   Given Mao's disassociation from her, however,
 it appears that her personal political future is
 very bleak and that the party's left wing will have
 to find another spokesman, one who is more adept at
 playing the political game than Chiang Ching has been.

 Taipei Tries Another Tack
 Taipei has decided to alter its tactics for
 dealing with the latest batch of Nationalist pris-
 oners released by Peking.   The move is primarily an
 UI attempt to avoid the bad publicity generated after
 the Nationalists refused to accept a similar group
 earlier this year.
 When ten released Nationalist soldiers captured
 in the late 1940s arrived in Hong Kong last April
 announcing their desire to join relatives on Taiwan,
 Taipei refused to have anything to do with them and
 described the event as a "united front trick."  Taipei
 took a propaganda beating for its stubbornness, es-
 9
 suicide.   Several of the group eventually returned to
 the mainland in September, and Peking deplored Tai-
 pei's  callous disregard" for its old soldiers, a
 charge that must have stung the Nationalist leaders.
 Peking announced last week that nearly half of
 the 144 "US-Chiang agents" released in September
 would be permitted to return to Taiwan.  The group
 pecially after one frustrated ex-prisoner committed
 to Taipei's decision to treat the freed "agents" with
 greater compassion.
 Taipei's new approach came in the form of a
 non-official broadcast to the mainland announcing
 that reception centers would be established on
 Nationalist-controlled offshore islands to handle
 those who wished to return.   The broadcast pointed
 out, however, that the released agents would be
 is made up of persons who had participated in Na-
 tionalist raids against the mainland in the early
 1960s.  Most of them have close relatives still liv-
 ing on Taiwan.  Moreover, they are closely linked
 with Premier Chiang Ching-kuo, who was in charge of
 the raids.  These factors almost certainly contributed

 screened carefully before being allowed to proceed
 to Taiwan proper.  Peking responded, announcing that
 60 "agents" had departed for the islands.  They now
 are being screened at the reception centers.
 rremier uniang mace the decision to accept the
 prisoners in early October at the strong urging of
 his top intelligence and security officials.  They
 recommended that those prisoners considered "reliable"
 should be allowed to proceed to Taiwan and that the
 main criterion should be their anti-Peking propaganda
 value.   Those who have no such value will be required
 ._, to remain on the offshore islands.   In this way,
 Taipei hopes to be in a better position to counter
 the propaganda advantages that Peking seeks to gain
 by manipulating the release of Nationalist prisoners.
 At the same time, however, the Nationalists
 remain extremely sensitive about the possibility
 that Taiwan residents--or friendly foreigners--will
 interpret acceptance of the prisoners as a sign of
 weakness in their attitude toward Peking.  Taiwan's
 ;p   newspapers waited until after National Day celebra-
 J                    tions on October 10 to report the government's will-
 ingness to accept the released "agents" and,  for the
 home audience, announced that they had "escaped" from
 the mainland.  The reports included no indication
 of when the released prisoners might come to Taiwan.
 The Nationalists have their work cut out for
 them in this attempt to steer a middle ground that
 will avoid both the appearance of a flirtation with
 Peking and the adverse publicity that would result
 from another cold-shouldering of freed prisoners.
 In the end, Taipei will probably attempt to play
 down the whole affair and hope that it blows over
 quickly.   (SECRET NOFORN/ORCON/NOCONTRACT)

 National Da   in the Provinces
 China's restrained celebration of National Day
 in Peking was mirrored in the provinces.  Although
 only one provincial first secretary failed to appear--
 Inner Mongolia's Yu Tai-chung---one or more secre-
 taries were missing in most provinces.
 One first secretary thought to be missing, Chou
 Hsing of Yunnan, was actually gravely ill.  He died
 on October 3 in Peking.   His replacement is Chia
 Chi-yun, a veteran civilian who headed neighboring
 Kweichou Province from July 1965 until his purge
 Oin the Cultural Revolution.   Peking's uncharacteristic
 swiftness in naming Chia fits with the continued
 emphasis on unity and stability, but the national
 eadership is still nervous about minority problems
 n the area in recent months.  Tsinghai and
 Heilungkiang have lacked first secretaries for
 months.
 There were some reappearances, the most sur-
 prising of which was the return of former Shanghai
 first secretary Chen Pei-hsien.   Chen was not given
 a title, but he was listed with members of the party
 c               standing committee.   Ironically, party vice chairman
 Wang Hung-wen headed the turnout--Wang was one of
 Cthe leaders of the leftist forces that ousted Chen.
 a Wang's presence in Shanghai did not appear to be
 related to Chen's reappearance, but resulted from
 Wang's continuing efforts to restore order and
 production in Chekiang.
 Also of note was the reappearance of three
 former Peking municipal party secretaries who were
 colleagues of former Peking party boss Peng Chen.
 Peng has been rumored as slated for rehabilitation.
 In Honan Province, a new deputy secretary was named.

 China's Aluminum Purchases
 China has contracted to purchase some 350,000
 tons of aluminum for delivery this year, a huge in-
 crease over the 1971-1974 annual average of about
 90,000 tons.  Almost all of the deals have been
 made since June, apparently as an outgrowth of a
 Chinese metals delegation tour through Western
 Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

 "Approximate amount from contracts arranged through
 September 1975.
 Since many of the purchases are through third
 country brokers or international companies, the
 country of origin of the aluminum is not always
 clear. At least five of the contracts apparently
 include US-origin aluminum totalling perhaps 60 to
 80,000 tons.   Other major sources are France, Norway,
 Japan, Bahrain, Canada, Iceland, and Eastern Europe,
 particularly Hungary and Romania.
 The Chinese are buying at discount prices in
 many instances--an average of less than 34 cents
 per pound, 2 to 3 cents below the free market rate
 --but, the total cost still will run from $250 to
 $300 million.  Peking's willingness to spend this

 ities is continuing.  The low level of aircraft pro-
 duction also may be increased.
 China is unlikely to continue importing such
 large amounts of aluminum.  Domestic capacity--
 perhaps 320,000 tons--is expanding at a steady
 rate and the Chinese have made good progress in
 utilizing their low-grade ores to expand output.
 Imports are likely to fall back at least to the
 levels of the past four years.
 The sales to China come at a time when Western
 dealers are faced with huge inventories following
 the world-wide drop in demand.   Sales are small in
 comparison to the size of total inventories, how-
 ever, and as one-time purchases, the impact on
 aluminum producers will probably be minimal.  The

 aluminum industries probably will not be appreciably

 much of its scarce foreign exchange would seem to
 indicate that the purchases go beyond a simple
 economy measure. China's nonferrous metals sector
 reportedly is falling short of production goals, and
 some of the imported aluminum may be making up for
 these shortfalls.  Much of the aluminum, however,
 apparently is going into stockpiles.  Almost all is
 in ingot form requiring further processing; the
 Chinese do not have the capacity to process this
 much aluminum over a short period of time.   Some
 of the stockpiles may be replacing depletions over
 the last year or so when world prices were high.
 The stockpiles probably are being increased
 in preparation for expanded aluminum consumption
 during the 1976-80 plan period.   The Chinese re-
 portedly are planning to expand their power network
 and large-scale construction of communications facil-
