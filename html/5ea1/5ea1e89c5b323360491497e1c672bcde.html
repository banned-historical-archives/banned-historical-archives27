 EAST-WEST RELATIONS                    .  ,  .  .    .  ,  .  .  .  .     page  1
 Moscow's treatment of the Rusk-Gromyko conversations
 and its general commentary on the Berlin situation suggest
 that the Soviet leaders are confident that formal negotia-
 tions will be arranged.   Pravda conveyed a favorable im-
 pression of the New York       ads, and a Soviet public lec-
 turer in Moscow has predicted the exchanges would be fol-
 lowed by negotiations ensuring a peaceful settlement.   So-
 viet spokesmen have stated privately that the next few
 weeks will be decisive in determining the bloc's next moves
 and have hinted that the year-end deadline could be extend-
 ed.   A Soviet memorandum to the UN on partial disarmament
 steps and European security arrangements also was intended
 to strengthen the Soviet effort to obtain an agreement on
 negotiations by indicating a willingness to broaden the
 agenda of any East-West talks.
 UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENTS   .
 .   Page  4
 Much of the UN activity during the 16th General As-
 sembly--now in its third week of general debate--centers
 on private negotiations to avert a Chinese Nationalist
 veto of Mongolia's admission.   Such a move would prevent
 Mauritania's entry and also have far-reaching consequences
 on Taipei's position in the United Nations.   UN members
 are also attempting to break the deadlock between the So-
 viet bloc and the West over the appointment of an interim
 secretary general.
 SYRIA-EGYPT  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  5
 Nasir's prestige appears to have sunk to an all-time
 low following Syria's break with the UAR.                  He had ordered
 contingency military preparations to permit rapid movement
 of Egyptian troops to Syria, but apparently has become less
 hopeful that a counterrevolt will take place to afford him
 the opportunity for direct military action in its support.
 He probably now will concentrate on a large-scale program
 of subversion against the new Syrian government and also
 try to accelerate the progress of his own revolutionary
 movement in other Arab countries.   The Kuzbari government
 and the "Syrian Army Revolutionary Command" have consoli-
 dated their control and,  in order to allay suspicion a-
 roused by their rightist background,  are attempting to
 conciliate public opinion by promising to continue and
 expand some of the social and economic reforms instituted
 by Nasir.   The USSR is maintaining an officially noncom-
 mittal attitude toward the revolt, although its leaders
 probably see the split as an opportunity for renewed Com-
 munist activity in Syria.

 Little progress has been made in the negotiations be-
 tween UN and Katanga representatives, and the situation in
 Elisabethville remains tense.              Each side professes confi-
 dence in its military superiority and is preparing for pos-
 sible further conflict.                            The stalemate apparently has pro-
 duced further pressure on Adoula to order a Congolese of-
 fensive.   The schism between moderate and Gizengist fac-
 tions in the central government continues.

 Souvanna Phouma,  Souphannouvong,  and Boun Oum are to
 meet at Ban Hin Heup on 6 October to resume negotiations
 for the establishment of a coalition government.   General
 Phoumi has indicated that Vientiane is willing to accept
 Souvanna as premier if the coalition cabinet reflects a
 "proper balance."  Kong Le - Pathet Lao forces continue
 "mop-up" operations against Meo units in the Plaine des
 Jarres area;  Vientiane troops, meanwhile,  are conducting
 patrols in central Laos.   At Geneva, general agreement
 has been reached on the future role of the conference co-     25X1

 French-Algerian negotiations seem likely to be resumed
 soon,  in view of the reportedly favorable reaction of the
 provisional Algerian government to De Gaulle's 2 October
 television address. In Algeria, however, tension between
 Europeans and Moslems remains high and is being stimulated
 by the rightist Secret Army Orgaftization, which hopes to
 provoke enough violence to wreck any prospect of a nego-
 tiated settlement.                  While De Gaulle's threat to dissolve
 parliament and to reassume emergency powers has further
 antagonized his domestic critics, all except the extrem-
 ists seem hesitant, because of the lack of a democratic
 alternative, to risk action which might overthrow him.
 FRANCO AND US BASES   .

 General Franco's public statement on 1 October that
 "circumstances counsel revision" of the ten-year US-Spanish
 defense and bases agreement implies that he will soon press
 for new concessions.   The treaty runs until September 1963,
 with a provision for automatic extension; any negotiations
 for revision would normally get under way in the next few
 months.   Spanish officials have indicated for some time
 that they want more modern arms; more recently,  in a sep-
 arate development,  they have pressed for US support of

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 October 1961
 SOVIET DOMESTIC PROPAGANDA ON THE PROSPECTS OF WAR .  .  .  .   Page  13
 Internal press and radio commentary associated,,,with
 major tough Soviet statements addressed to the West have
 on several occasions aroused anxiety among the Soviet.pub-
 lic.   These have, in each case, been followed by efforts
 to allay domestic fear that war might be imminent.   Some
 Soviet citizens seem to have developed a certain amount
 of indifference to official statements.   Others, however,
 were undoubtedly perturbed by official statements that
 the international situation is serious but appear to ac-
 cept the reassurances which have followed.   There appears
 F_ Kilru-,;
 to be little doubt among the Soviet people that
 shoheV^,s; posi.tlern on the German question is Just.
 CROP PROSPECTS IN THE SINO-SOVIET BLOC .  .  .
 Page  15
 Crop prospects for the Sino-Soviet bloc in 1961 are
 not outstanding and in some areas, notably Communist China,
 are particularly poor.   China's prospects for a third suc-
 cessive unfavorable agricultural year indicate that food
 shortages--together with malnutrition and related health
 problems--will probably continue to plague the regime
 throughout the coming winter and spring.
 With the exception of the New Lands, growing condi-
 tions for small grains were generally favorable in the
 USSR this year.  Although expected to be 15 to 20 percent
 above the poor harvests of 1959 and 1960, this year's to-
 tal grain harvest will still be below the bumper harvest
 of 1958, leaving the regime with little progress during
 the past three years toward its ambitious 1965 agricultural
 targets.
 Total output of grain in the European satellites is
 estimated to be about the same as last year, largely be-
 cause of a bumper crop in Poland.   No basic improvement
 in the per capita availability of food is expected for the
 satellites in 1961/62.   East Germany, Hungary, and Bul-
 garia will probably have the most difficulty in meeting
 consumer demands for foodstuffs.
 HOUSING PRIORITY LOWERED IN USSR . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 A newly published figure for housing construction in
 the USSR in 1960, significantly lower than that originally
 claimed in the official plan report, is a new indication
 of reduced priority for Soviet housing and casts doubt on
 the possibility of achieving the Seven-Year Plan (1959-65)
 for housing.   A substantial underfulfiliment of the plan
 in 1960 and subsequent housing data suggest that the So-
 viet regime decided in mid-1960 to sacrifice part of the
 popular housing program to other construction projects.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Second Five-Year Plan (1961-65). Planned investments have
 been cut, however, allowing larger expenditures for mili-
 tary purposes and, possibly, for repaying foreign loans.
 The revised plan is generally conservative and probably
 will be fulfilled in its main aspects.                                    25X1
 COMMUNIST CHINA CELEBRATES NATIONAL DAY  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 1E9
 On 1 October the Chinese Communist regime went through
 the motions of celebrating the 12th  anniversary of its
 founding, but in contrast to previous National Day cele-
 brations the principal speechmakers made few boasts con-
 cerning the past year's achievements.   Instead they spoke
 of "certain difficulties," "three successive years of grave
 natural calamities," and "a reduction of agricultural out-
 put," and said 1961 and 1962 would mark a period of eco-
 nomic consolidation and adjustment.   On foreign policy
 matters, Peiping's tributes to Sino-Soviet friendship were
 met by unresponsive Soviet speeches and pro forma Soviet
 attendance at National Day functions in both Peiping and
 Moscow.
 PEIPING'S RELATIONS WITH JAPAN .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 20
 Communist China has in recent weeks engaged in a prop-
 aganda campaign of growing shrillness against the Japanese
 Government.   Reacting to what it considers Prime Minister
 Ikeda's increasing hostility, Peiping now calls him "worse
 than" his predecessor, Kishi.   Annoyed with Japanese So-
 cialists for their new coolness toward united front tactics
 with Japanese Communists in anti-US activities, Peiping is
 casting about for new leftist channels through which to
 influence Japanese politics.                                                 25X1
 FACTIONALISM IN SOUTH KOREAN REGIME   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 22
 Factional struggle threatens the stability of South
 Korea's ruling military council.   Security boss Col. Kim
 Chong-pit, whose followers tend to favor protracted mili-
 tary rule and a state-operated economy, is pressing for
 the removal of the council's vice chairman, Maj. Gen.
 Yi Chu-il, whose group appears to want a more moderate
 approach to the country's difficulties.   The chairman
 of the council, Lt. Gen. Pak Chon -hui  is believed to be
 working to avoid a showdown.                                                 25X1
 GHANA  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 23
 The regime's arrest on 3 October of prominent politi-
 cal adversaries and leaders of the union which spearheaded
 last month's strikes underscores Nkrumah's determination
 to forestall the emergence of any effective opposition
 movement.    The arrests,  along with the removal of K. A.
 Gbedemah from the cabinet last week, have stimulated new
 discontent with Nkrumah's leadership, especially among
 labor elements.   However,  Nkrumah's move may intimidate
 into inaction Gbedemah and other moderates within the ruling
 party who appeared to bectygt~t~~~VVarlc, ,ppen opposition.

 BRITAIN AND THE COMMON MARKET  .

 London has agreed to outline to a preliminary minis-
 terial meeting to be held in Paris on 10 and 11 October
 the specific concessions it seeks before joining the Euro-
 pean Common Market (EEC).   Criticism of British accession
 by other Commonwealth members has sharpened in recent weeks.
 The Macmillan government may find it increasingly difficult
 to reconcile the general assurances it has given the Common-
 wealth and British agricultural interests with an approach
 to the EEC that is sufficiently forthcoming to give the
 formal negotiations a good start early in November.

 CYPRUS AFTER A YEAR OF INDEPENDENCE .
 .  .  .   Page 9
 Cyprus is experiencing large-scale unemployment, a
 serious drought,  increasing violence,  and the growing
 influence of a domestic Communist party.   Greek Cypriot
 extremists continue to demand union with Greece,  and
 some members of the Turkish minority are again coming to
 feel that partition of the island is the "final answer"
 for communal problems.   The government continues to func-
 tion effectively, however, and both President Makarios
 and Vice President Kuchuk appear determined to make the
 Cyprus settlement work.   Makarios, in the face of Turkish
 Cypriot objections,  is pursuing a "nonaligned" foreign
 policy but--as indicated by his remarks at the recent
 Belgrade conference--with an awareness of Cypriot economic
 dependence on and cultural affinity for the West.   Com-
 bating the continued growth of Communism appears to pre-
 sent the government with its greatest challenge.

 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 Moscow's treatment of the
 conversations between Secretary
 Rusk and Foreign Minister Gro-
 myko and its general commentary
 on Berlin suggest that the So
 diet leaders are confident formal
 negotiations will be arranged.
 Following the third meeting be-
 tween Secretary Rusk and Foreign
 Minister Gromyko on 30 September,
 Pravda on 2 October quoted from
 a US statement that the sessions
 were cordial, that they were re-
 lated to the possibility of
 East-West negotiations, and that
 Gromyko was likely to meet with
 President Kennedy.   Soviet press
 coverage of the first two dis-
 cussions merely reported that
 the meetings had been held but
 gave no indication of the gen-
 eral atmosphere or possible re-
 sults.   The coverage of 2 Oc-
 tober, therefore, conveys an
 impression that the talks are
 proceeding favorably.
 Izvestia also injected a
 hopeful note in an article
 which cla'ime..d. that the Soviet
 people did not believe that
 the international situation
 was entirely covered with the
 "leaden clouds of war."  A
 speaker at a public lecture in
 Moscow on 26 September predict-
 ed that the Rusk-Gromyko talks
 would be followed by negotia-
 tions and cited the US-Soviet
 agreement on disarmament princi-
 ples as a favorable sign.  The
 East German party organ Neues
 Deutschland echoed this line
 in an editorial of 28 September,
 stating,  "Everyone realizes now
 that there will be negotiations."
 Polish party First Secretary
 Gomulka on 30 September also
 asserted that "on our side nothing
 stands in the way of a peaceful
 solution of the German problem
 by means of fruitful negotiations
 and mutual agreements."  The Pol-
 ish  news service reported that
 "UN circles" expect an East-West
 foreign ministers conference to
 be followed by a summit meeting.
 This general line suggests
 that Moscow views the Rusk-Grog
 myko talks as the opening of a
 decisive phase in the Berlin cri-
 sis.  A number of Soviet journal-
 ists, in their contacts with Amer--
 ican officials,  have stressed
 that the next several weeks will
 determine the future course for
 the bloc and have hinted that
 the Soviet year-end deadline for
 a solution could be revised if
 negotiations were in process or
 scheduled.  The third secretary
 of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
 City stated that the USSR was
 not disposed to sign a separate
 East German treaty if there were
 real possibilities for East-West
 agreement.
 A Pravda correspondent
 claimed that the next six weeks
 would be most important for set-
 tirmg: a date for a meeting at the
 highest level.   He added that..
 the date could be "sometime in

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 that if they failed to material-
 ize, Khrushchev would have some
 "very interesting warnings" at
 the Soviet party congress.
 Communist sources in London
 were apparently responsible for
 press reports that the bloc
 foreign ministers would convene
 in November to consider the next
 move on Germany.  According to
 these reports, the bloc would re-
 view the results of current East-
 West contacts,  such as the Rusk-
 Gromyko conversations, and  de-
 cide whether to proceed with a
 peace treaty before the end of
 the year.   If no East-West ne-
 gotiations were arranged by No-
 vember, the bloc would go a-
 head as announced and convoke
 a peace conference, but that if
 it was clear the West was  pre-
 pared to negotiate,  the Warsaw
 Pact ministers would recommend
 postponement of a peace con-
 ference until "two or three
 months" into 1962. Other press
 reports quoted "Communist diplo-
 mats" as saying that the bloc
 might postpone a separate treaty
 if the West agreed to negotiate
 a Berlin settlement.
 These semiofficial state-
 ments have been accompanied by
 an official effort to appear
 responsive to Western views
 that the agenda of any formal
 negotiations should be broader
 than the Soviet proposal of a
 peace treaty and free-city status
 for West Berlin.   The Soviets
 have begun to emphasize European
 security and certain limited
 partial disarmament  measures
 to show willingness to enlarge
 the scope of East-West  discus-
 sions.  The Soviets have made
 it clear, however, that European
 security discussions are no sub-
 stitute for a German treaty.
 Disarmament
 A Soviet Government memo-
 randum submitted to the 16th UN
 General Assembly suggested reach-
 ing agreement on freezing mili-
 tary budgets, denouncing the use
 of nuclear weapons, banning war
 propaganda, concluding a nonag-
 gression pact between the NATO
 countries and the Warsaw Pact
 nations, withdrawing foreign
 troops from the territories of
 other countries; taking measures
 against the further spread of
 nuclear weapons, creating atom-
 free zones, and taking steps to
 lessen the danger of surprise at-
 tack.
 All of these measures have
 appeared as provisions of earli-
 er Soviet disarmament proposals,
 although not necessarily as "par-
 tial" disarmament measures.   The
 increase in the number of partial
 disarmament measures listed may
 be aimed at countering neutralist
 dismay over the Soviet position
 that a test ban solution can be
 reached "only" through agreement
 on general and complete disarma-
 ment.   Several of the measures--
 a NATO - Warsaw Treaty nonaggres-
 sion pact, establishment of a
 nuclear-free zone in Central Eu-
 rope:,; withdrawal or at least re-
 duction of foreign troops  in Eu-
 rope, and a ban on supplying nu-
 clear weapons to other countries
 --are probably calculated to ap-
 peal to groups in Western Europe
 who favor tying European security
 arrangements to a German settlement.

 The memorandum's call for
 reciprocal commitments not to
 be the first to use nuclear
 weapons is at variance with a
 recent statement by Khrushchev.
 The Soviet leader--who in past
 years had advocated such an
 agreement--told New York Times
 correspondent SuT  erger ear y
 in September, "It would be un-
 timely at present to say that
 in the event of war, atomic
 weapons would not be employed."
 He added that if both sides

 nuclear weapons but retained
 their stockpiles and the'im-
 perialists unleashed a war,
 "any side" that felt it was
 losing would "undoubtedly use
 its nuclear bombs."

 Bloc leaders continue to
 stress possible guarantees for
 future access to West Berlin.
 Gomulka said on 30 September
 that the peace treaty will
 allow a "solution of the West
 Berlin problem in a way.  .  .which
 will provide it with free com-
 munications with the world and
 international guarantees of the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENTS
 The 16th UN General As-
 sembly is in its third week of
 general debate.  Most activity,
 however, is taking place in pri-
 vate negotiations among UN mem-
 bers on such key issues as the
 admission of Mongolia and Mauri-
 tania and the appointment of an
 interim secretary general.
 Admission of Mongolia
 The Security Council on 2
 October again deferred considera-
 tion of Mauritania's and Mongo-
 lia's membership applications.
 All 11 council members acquiesced
 in the deferral, reportedly to
 allow time for further negotia-
 tions with Nationalist China on
 its opposition to Mongolia's en-
 try into the UN.  The USSR still
 insists it will veto Mauritania's
 application if Mongolia is re-
 jected.      Mauritania's applica-
 tion is first on the agenda, but
 the USSR has circumvented this
 tactical dilemma by threaten-
 ing to veto Mauritania's admis-
 sion unless Mongolia has already
 been accepted.
 The Security Council will
 probably meet again soon on the
 problem, and a Nationalist veto
 of Mongolia then could accelerate
 the assembly debate on Chinese
 UN representation and might also
 lead to early Soviet efforts to
 have the assembly reject Taipei's
 credentials--a vote requiring on-
 ly a simple majority.  The West
 wants to have the issue debated
 as an "important question" re-
 quiring a two-thirds vote.
 possibly be such that the group
 in the end would vote as a bloc
 and oppose Nationalist China.
 The Secretary Generalship
 The Soviet delegation has
 further modified its position
 on Dag Hammarskjold's successor
 in an effort to meet the Afro-
 Asians'  objections and to gain
 their support for some form of
 the troika principle.  The bloc
 is currently pressing a proposal
 for the Security Council to name
 a provisional "chief of the sec-
 retariat" plus three deputies--
 one each from the West, the So-
 viet bloc,  and the neutral
 states.  This four-man directo-
 rate would be required to act in
 the spirit of "concord" and to
 serve until April 1963, when
 Hammarskjold's term would have
 expired.
 In his explanation of this
 plan to Ambassador Stevenson,
 chief Soviet delegate Zorin was
 ambiguous on the question of
 whether the Soviet terminology
 involved a veto power for the
 deputies.  On 1 October, however,
 the Soviet delegation published
 a formal statement outlining
 the proposals and denying that
 Moscow envisaged a veto power
 by any of the deputies.
 The Soviet delegation has
 been seeking support from Afro-
 Asians for this latest plan.
 The USSR reportedly has agreed   25X1
 to the appointment of Burma's
 U Thant as interim secretary
 general with full powers. F__1
 Although spokesmen for the
 twelve French African states in
 the Brazzaville group continue
 to assert that they will oppose
 Taipei as a bloc if Mauritania
 is denied UN membership because
 of a Nationalist veto of Mongo-
 lia, there are indications that
 the group is not as unified on
 this issue as some spokesmen
 claim.   Foreign Ministry officials
 of Cameroun, Togo, and even
 Senegal have recently expressed
 opposition to Chinese Communist
 membership in the UN.  However,
 resentment of Taipei could
 The USSR's main purpose
 seems to be to avoid a decision
 which would reconfirm the exist-
 ting situation and represent a   25X1
 defeat for the Soviet contention
 that the executive branch of the
 UN should be reorganized.

 The early-morning coup in
 Damascus on 28 September caught
 the Nasir regime completely by
 surprise,    and the small military
 clique responsible for the action
 quickly consolidated its initial
 success with comparatively little
 resistance throughout Syria.
 With the possibility of any pro-
 Nasir counterrevolt in Syria
 becoming increasingly remote,
 Nasir appears to be slowing down
 the contingency invasion prepa-
 rations noted in the days imme-
 diately following the coup.
 The ineffectual drop of
 about 100 paratroops in the
 Latakia area early on 29 Septem-
 ber was meant to be the first
 move in an invasion plan appar-
 ently based on a faulty inter-
 pretation  of the situation,  com-
 bined with Nasir's determination
 to take the strongest possible
 stand against the rebels through-
 out the crisis.   Freighters at
 Alexandria continued loading of
 invasion materiel until 3 October,
 probably in the hope that some
 sign of indigenous support for
 an invasion attempt would show
 itself.   With the chances for
 direct military action apparently
 fading,  Nasir will probably con-
 centrate on subversion.
 The Kuzbari regime in Syria,
 .well aware that it will be called
 reactionary, has made strenuous
 efforts to give the impression
 that social gains made during
 the UAR period will be retained.
 The appointment of a moderate
 socialist as minister of national
 guidance was a move in this
 direction,  as have been several
 announcements that such worker
 benefits as employee profit
 ,sharing and participation in
 management would be retained
 and expanded.   The agrarian re-
 form law decreed by Nasir also
 is to be carried out.
 leaders Akram al-Hawrani and
 Salah al-Din Bitar.   Apparently,
 the Kuzbari regime promised
 early parliamentary elections
 in return for this support.
 Nasir's monolithic political
 movement,  the National Union,
 has been dissolved throughout
 Syria.
 Schools have been closed
 while the curriculum is being
 "cleansed" of material glorify-
 ing Nasir as the champion of
 Arab unity.   Egyptians in Syria
 have been ordered to register
 with security authorities as
 foreigners, but orders for their
 mandatory expulsion have been
 rescinded; several hundred have
 already returned to Egypt.
 The prospects for continued
 maintenance of a stable govern-
 ment in Syria do not appear good.
 Before union with Egypt,  Syria
 was beset with internal political
 turbulence,  and coups and counter-
 coups were'frequent.   The Kuz-
 bari government will probably
 be subjected to increasing pres-
 sure from less conservative
 political groups.   There is,
 moreover, reason to believe that
 some of the army officers in the
 revolutionary command are not
 entirely satisfied with the make-
 up of the Kuzbari cabinet.
 Only Jordan among the Arab
 states has so far recognized
 the Kuzbari government;   Qasim
 and King Saud are undoubtedly
 greatly pleased at Nasir's set-
 back but have given no indi-
 cation when Iraqi and Saudi
 recognition would be extended.
 Beirut has been the-scene
 of several sizable pro-Nasir
 and pro-UAR demonstrations
 since the coup and is apparently
 being used by Egypt as a base
 of operations against Damascus.
 The new government's inter-
 nal position should be strength-
 ened by the 1 October declaration
 of support from a cross-section
 of Syrian political leaders,  in-
 cluding those who were respon-
 sible for Syria's union with
 Egypt in 1958.   Of particular

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY 3URY
 Little progress has been
 made in the negotiations between
 UN and Katangan representatives
 and tension is continuingr.,in.Elis-
 abethville.   The points at issue
 are the position of Katangans
 European mercenaries.  and the
 terms of Katangans reintegration
 with the rest of the Congo.   Ka-
 tangan officials claim that the
 mercenaries have been dismissed,
 and that their repatriation now
 is the concern of the UN and the
 foreign consular corps.   UN rep-
 resentatives charge that the
 Europeans have merely gone under-
 25X1 ground.
 A high UN official has told
 the Katangans that unless they
 helped to round up the remaining
 white mercenaries, the UN would
 have to take "appropriate meas-
 ures" to seize the Europeans.
 The American consul in Elisabeth-
 ville comments that such measures
 might lead to a reopening of
 hostilities.
 They:>Katangan..XN:.megotiat ions
 are complicated by the belief of
 the UN in its military superiori-
 ty, and by Tshombe's apparent
 feeling that he must put up a
 bold front.   UN commander
 McKeown,  in a 30 September con-
 versation with Ambassador Gul-
 lion, admitted the difficulties
 in planning and the language
 barriers encountered by the UN
 in the past, but ascribed its
 present posture mainly to an un-
 willingness, based on humanitar-
 ian considerations, to go on the
 offensive.   He deprecated the
 Katangan "attacks," which he
 said were actually ill-directed
 mortar and small-arms fire.
 McKeown indicated that with the
 addition of a small jet fighter
 capability, the arrival of 20
 armored personnel carriers, and
 some regrouping of forces, the
 UN would have the Katangan sit-
 uation in hand.
 The American Consulate in
 Elisabethville,  while confirming
 that the UN troops believe that
 "next time we shall finish the
 job we started last time," re-
 ports that the UN Elisabethville
 headquarters has no intelligence
 organization.   UN troops have
 been ostracized by local civilians
 and have little chance to gain
 information by informal contacts.
 The consulate also reports
 that on the Katangan, side there
 is a mixture of confusion and
 confidence,  with much talk of
 a "last-ditch stand" and "whip-
 ping the UN again."   The Katan-
 gans have received at least one
 and possibly six Dornier light
 transports, which could be used
 for reconnaissance and limited
 bombing missions.   UN officials
 believe that mercenaries and
 military equipment are still
 being smuggled across the Rho-
 desian border,  the vehement pub-
 lic and private denials of Rho-
 desian officials notwithstand-

 Rioting by anti-Tshomb6
 Baluba tribesmen in areas around
 Elisabethville is further com-
 plicating the security situation
 in Katanga.   The 30,000 tribes-
 men in the Elisabethville refugee
 camp reportedly are also being
 molested by pro-Tshomb6 youth
 groups.   Estimates of the number
 killed in these essentially trib-
 al  outbreaks range from 50 to 100.

 ment.  Adoula,  in conversations
 with Ambassador Gullion in Leo-

 atively moderate stand on the
 substantive issues, but he has
 so far rejected Tshombe's offer
 to hold talks at a neutral site.
 The continuing stalemate
 in Katanga apparently is result-
 ing in further pressure on Adou-
 la to order a Congolese offen-
 sive.   He told Ambassador Gul-
 lion recently that he had threat-
 ened to resign in order to head
 off the "activists" in his cab-
 inet; nevertheless,  Congolese
 military leaders apparently are
 planning a large-scale invasion
 of Katanga from both Kasai and
 Kivu provinces.   The Congolese
 command has had no training for
 such an operation,  and trans-
 port and logistic facilities
 are inadequate,  while liaison
 between Mobutu's Leopoldville
 headquarters and the various
 army components is tenuous.
 There is evidence of a
 continuing schism in Leopoldville
 between the moderate and Gizen-
 gist factions which has not been
 healed by the appointment of
 several Gizengists to the Adoula
 cabinet.   Adoula apparently is
 relying on splits in the radical
 bloc--particularly between Gi-
 zenga and Interior Minister
 Gbenye--to keep it under con-
 trol.   He admitted to Gullion
 that there were differences be-
 tween himself and Gizenga but
 expressed confidence that Gizen-
 ga could be controlled.
 Gizenga,  in a conversation
 with Gullion, pressed strongly
 for a Congolese constitution
 which would effectively end Ka-
 tangan separatism.   He was e-
 vasive when asked if he favored
 Congolese military intervention.
 He also insisted that the gov-

 Souvanna Phouma,  Souphan-
 nouvong, and Boun Oum are sched-

 village of Ban Hin Heup on 6
 October to resume negotiations
 for the establishment of a coali-

 discussions, the first to be held
 since the Zurich conference in
 June, will be initiated on the
 Vientiane-controlled south bank
 of the Nam Lik;  thereafter meet-

 sides of the river.   Major points
 for discussion include the des-

 forces,  Phoumi stated his in-
 tention to arrive at agreement
 on "broad lines of handling this
 question" prior to the formation
 of the government, with emphasis
 on the implementation of demobi-
 lization before elections.
 Pa,thet Lao - Kong Le forces
 have continued their mop-up
 activities in Xieng Khouang
 Province.   Reports indicate the
 loss by Meo units of posts at
 Tha Lin Noi and Pha Phong in
 the Plaine des Jarres area.
 Farther south,  in the areas south
 and east of Thakhek, Vientiane
 forces have continued their oper-
 ations to eliminate enemy pockets.
 At Geneva, general agree-
 ment has been reached on the
 future role of the cochairmen.
 The approved draft, which
 eliminates the initial Soviet
 demand for a veto by the co-
 chairmen over activities of
 the International Control
 Commission (ICC), allows
 them to make recommendations to
 the ICC, which it may accept
 or reject.   In a 27 September
 discussion of the future func-
 tion of the ICC in Laos,  however,
 both the Soviet and Chinese chief
 delegates took the position that
 it should carry out its activities
 only with the full agreement of
 and on request of the Laotian
 Government.   They maintained
 that the concept of permanent
 ICC teams at predetermined
 inspection points was unacceptable.
 The two bloc delegates
 pressed the US delegate for an
 estimate on how much longer the
 conference would continue and
 argued that,  inasmuch as the
 three Laotian parties have al-
 ready expressed their views in
 the Zurich communique, it would
 not   be  necessary   to  have
 a  unified  Laotian             govern-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 In a private talk with Am-
 bassador Harriman on 29 Septem-
 ber, Soviet delegate Pushkin
 reiterated the Soviet desire
 for an early agreement and
 indicated that there was at
 least some room for negotiation
 on the future of the ICC's
 operation in Laos.   However,
 it is unlikely that the bloc
 would agree to any plan which
 did not limit the ICC's authority
 to the terms of a general agree-
 ment which would have to be con-
 cluded between the commission
 and a government headed by
 Souvanna Phouma--who has stated
 his opposition to the idea of
 an ICC with unlimited authority.
 French-Algerian negotia-
 tions seem likely to be resumed
 soon,  in view of the reportedly
 favorable reaction of the pro-
 visional Algerian government
 (PAG) to De Gaulle's 2 October
 television address.   In Algeria,
 however,  tension between Euro-
 peans and Moslems remains high
 and is being stimulated by the
 rightist Secret Army Organiza-
 tion (OAS), which hopes to pro-
 voke enough violence to wreck
 any negotiated settlement.
 While be Gaulle's threat to dis-
 solve parliament and to reassume
 emergency power's has further
 antagonized his domestic critics,
 all except the extremists seem
 hesitant,  because of the lack
 of a democratic alternative, to
 risk action which might over-
 throw him.
 While the only specific
 steps De Gaulle outlined on 2
 October were aimed at establish-
 ing a provisional executive body
 to govern Algeria, he made some
 attempt to mollify both the
 Europeans in Algeria and the PAG
 on his ultimate intentions.   He
 made up for his much-criticized
 failure to mention guarantees
 for Europeans at his 5 September
 press conference, and stated
 that he does not regard negotia-
 tions and moves to establish a
 provisional executive as mutually
 exclusive.   He stressed that the
 initiative for any provisional
 body should come from Algerians
 themselves,  although Paris will
 reportedly set the process in
 motion this month by establish-
 ing, as a forerunner, a "con-
 sultative committee" to advise
 the Delegation Generalein
 Algeria on problems of self-
 determination.   French of-
 ficials profess hope--on the
 basis of indications they
 reportedly received during the
 last round of talks at Lugrin
 --that the PAG might be will-
 ing to discuss participation
 in a provisional body.
 During the transition to
 independence,  the provisional
 body would be supported by the
 "local police force" De Gaulle

 General Ahmed Rafa, the only
 Moslem general officer in the
 French Army, who was promoted
 from colonel early in September
 and on 4 October was named in-
 fantry assistant to the commander
 in chief in Algeria.
 Foreign Minister Couve de
 Murville told Ambassador Gavin
 in Paris on 3 October that talks
 would begin soon with the PAG.
 The PAG had reportedly felt that
 France should make the first
 overture toward resuming talks.
 A PAG official in Tunis told the
 US ambassador there on 29 Sep-
 tember that the rebels were
 alarmed by the growing strength
 of the OAS.   He said that while
 they feared De Gaulle might not
 be able to carry out commitments
 made in negotiations,  they never-
 theless felt that only he could
 judge when the internal French
 situation would permit serious
 new negotiations.
 De Gaulle's speech will in-
 crease the determination of the
 OAS, especially in Algeria, to
 provoke violence sufficient to
 make a negotiated settlement
 impossible..  The OAS will prob-
 ably be encouraged by the impres-
 sive response in the European
 sections of Algeria to its 2
 October call for a half-hour
 general strike.   The mobs which
 SECRET
 have recently been active in
 Algiers were composed predomi-
 nantly of young European toughs
 who probably see little future
 for themselves in an "Algerian
 Algeria,'.' and question their
 welcome elsewhere.   They have
 access to plenty of arms, and
 might face the army and secu-
 rity forces with the necessity
 of firing on them.
 De Gaulle's 2 October
 characterization of politicians
 playing "their discredited games
 of the former system" destroyed
 whatever good will he may have
 earned in his consultations late
 last month with party leaders.
 Parliament convened in a sullen
 mood when the fall session opened
 on 3"October, and the Socialist
 party has authorized its depu-
 ties to introduce a censure
 motion against the government
 whenever an "opportune time"
 occurs.   Such a motion,  if
 passed, would almost certainly
 lead to a dissolution of parlia-
 ment, but the US Embassy in
 Paris estimates that no re-
 sponsible political leader is
 currently prepared to meet De
 Gaulle in a full-fledged public
 fight.
 Meanwhile,  in addition to the
 influence of the OAS, there are
 some elements in the armed forces
 which dislike De Gaulle's policies
 but do not want to precipitate   25X1
 chaos and enhance prospects of a
 fascist-type seizure of power.
 They apparently hope to
 back responsible civilians who
 would take the initiative in     25X1
 proposing and organizing a "demo-
 cratic alternative" which could
 assume power legally.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 FRANCO AND US BASES
 General Franco's public
 statement on 1 October that
 "circumstances counsel revi-
 sion" of the ten-year US-Span-
 ish defense and bases agree-
 ment implies that he will soon
 press for new concessions.   The
 treaty runs until September 1963,
 and negotiations for renewal
 would normally get under way in
 the next few months.   Spanish
 officials have indicated for
 some time that they want more
 modern arms; more recently,  in
 a separate development,  they
 have pressed for US support of
 Spain's African policy.
 Under the 1953 defense
 agreement, which provides for
 two successive five-year exten-
 sions unless one of the signa-
 tories requests cancellation,
 Spain granted the US permission
 to construct and use air bases
 located near Madrid,  Saragossa,
 and Seville and a naval base at
 Rota,  near Cadiz.   In exchange
 the US has provided military and
 economic aid amounting to some
 $1.2 billion since 1953.
 Addressing cabinet members
 and top-ranking military officers
 at the celebration of his 25th
 anniversary as chief of state,
 Franco stated that the agreement
 needed to be revised to meet the
 new situation brought about by
 recent technical developments.
 In the spring of 1960, Munoz
 Grandes, chief of the Spanish
 High General Staff,  repeatedly
 stressed to the chief of the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 officials the need for strength-
 ening and expanding the existing
 agreement.
 The US agreement to quit
 Moroccan bases by the end of
 1963 leads Franco to feel he
 is in a much stronger position
 to extract new concessions from
 the US when the Spanish bases
 agreement is renegotiated.
 Madrid will become increasingly
 insistent on this point as the
 military capability of Morocco
 improves.   Spanish officials
 have already expressed anxiety
 on several occasions over the
 security situation in Morocco
 as the US bases phase out.
 Madrid is particularly concerned
 over the eventual renewal of
 Moroccan aggression against Ifni
 and the Spanish Sahara and over
 demands by Moroccan nationalists
 for the surrender of the en-
 claves of Ceuta and Melilla.
 Spanish officials have
 shown considerable displeasure
 over Washington's African
 policy.   On 8 August 1961,  a
 high official in the Spanish
 Foreign Ministry vigorously
 defended Portuguese policy in
 Angola in a talk with US Navy
 Secretary Connally.   While the
 official stressed that he was
 speaking on a personal basis,
 he argued that the US defense
 agreement should logically lead
 to US support for Spain's posi-
 tion in Africa.   In view of
 Franco's statement in his 1
 October speech that Portugal
 was being attacked unjustly
 abroad because of its African
 policy,  the Generalissimo
 may have in mind pressing the
 US for some expression of sup-
 port in Africa.
 SOVIET DOMESTIC PROPAGANDA ON THE PROSPECTS OF WAR
 Soviet domestic radio and
 press statements since July on
 the prospects of war have taken
 the line that while the inter-
 national crisis is, grave, the
 forces opposing war are strong
 and growing stronger, and that
 there is confidence that they
 will prevail.   These assurances
 have been coupled with asser-
 tions of the military strength
 and preparedness of the USSR.
 There has been no indication
 that the population at large
 is being steeled to endure a
 war;  the hardships of World War
 II have been recalled frequently
 and graphically,  but without
 citations of heroism or patriot-
 ism.   There appears to be little
 doubt among the Soviet populace
 that Khrushchev's position on the
 German question is just.

 On several occasions, pub-

 with tough Soviet statements ad-

 tion,. his radio-television ad-
 dress of 7 August in which he
 said the possibility of a West-
 ern attack could not be excluded,
 and the announcement on 30 Au-
 gust of the USSR's resumption
 of nuclear tests.   The most re-
 cent period of possible public
 anxiety coincided with a series
 of dire estimates of rising
 international tension by Soviet
 military leaders from 14 through
 26 September.
 On 25 September, however,
 Khrushchev's statement to Nehru
 that talks ?*can and must play
 an important role in cleansing
 the international atmosphere"
 provided a counterbalance to
 the military predictions.   Daily
 press and radio commentary echoed
 both lines but by 27 September
 had settled on a distinctly hope-
 ful note.
 Information has been sparse.
 on the conclusions drawn by the
 Soviet man in the street from
 these frequently conflicting
 statements.   Some citizens ap-
 there was little propensity to
 blame either US or Soviet leader-
 ship.
 A trip by embassy officers
 in early August to Alma-Ata and
 Tselinograd confirmed this im-
 pression.   Many of the individ-
 ual                                                              Soviet citizens encountered

 late August to Tbilisi,  Bukhara,
 Tashkent,  and Samarkand revealed
 continuing concern, especially
 among educated and politically
 informed Soviet citizens.   The
 embassy noted, however,  that
 they were receptive to explana-
 tions of US attitudes on Berlin.
 A trip to Murmansk by em-
 bassy porsonnel'.in early Sep-
 tember revealed "certainty" on
 the part of the few Soviet con-
 tacts made that war would not
 come because it would be a "ca-
 tastrophe for all concerned."
 Successful negotiations were
 expected on a German peace

 CROP PROSPECTS IN THE SINQSOVIET BLOC
 China
 Communist China is facing
 its third successive unfavorable
 agricultural year.  Grain output
 for 1961 will probably be about
 the same as last year's estimated
 185,000,000 tons.  This is also
 the same level achieved in 1957,
 when there were some 60,000,000
 fewer to feed.  As a consequence,
 malnutrition and related health
 problems can be expected to rise
 sharply next winter and continue
 at least through spring, with a
 further decline in labor pro-
 ductivity and continued public
 discontent,
 Peiping has published no
 statistics on agricultural pro-
 duction this year, but avail-
 able evidence indicates that
 the 1961 winter wheat harvest
 was probably the smallest in
 several years.  The third
 successive year of drought in
 North China, a reduction in the
 sown area,  late planting with
 consequent heavy winter kill,
 seed shortages, and peasant
 apathy all contributed to this
 small harvest.
 Weather conditions in
 South China have apprently
 been relatively good, and an
 average crop seems likely.
 In Central and East China,
 however, drought conditions were
 reported throughout the spring
 and summer.  The extent of
 drought damage to the late rice
 crop, harvested in October and
 November, cannot be determined
 yet.   It is clOar, however, that
 the outcome of the harvest in
 this Yapgtze valley area--ac-
 counting for 52 percent of the
 rice acreage in China--wil?l
 have major significance for
 the coming year's food supply.
 Conditions in Hupeh, one of
 the major rice-producing
 prd-vinces in this area, are
 worse thus far than in 1959
 and 19600
 Despite continuing shortages
 of foreign exchange, Communist
 China is preparing to negotialILLEGIB
 for further grain imports from
 nonbloc sources in the coming
 av-  a ready hinted
 o    e   anadian trade commis-
 sioner in Hong Kong that they
 wish to buy more grain in 1962
 than was stipulated in the earlier
 agreement.     The Chinese have
 contracted for delivery of
 5,500,000 tons of foreign grain
 in 1961 at a cost of more than
 $350,000,000.
 Asian Satellites
 In North Vietnam, prospects
 for the important October-November
 rise harvest, which normally
 accounts for two thirds of the
 annual rice output, are causing
 the authorities concern.  Field
 work is reportedly behind schedule
 in many areas, with transplanting
 of rice delayed by the abnormally
 dry conditions during July and
 August.   Should growing conditions
 remain abnormal, the effect on
 the late rice crop will create
 serious food problems for the
 regime next winter.
 While North Korea's expecta-
 tion of a bumper harvest this
 year may prove overly optimistic,
 weather conditions suggest at
 least a normal-to-good harvest.
 Pyongyang has not been plagued by
 the rural mismanagement which has
 characterized Chinese agriculture
 over the past few years.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 For the third year in a
 row the USSR has made little
 or no progress toward the am-
 bitious 1965 target for total
 agricultural output.   Grain
 production this year, favored
 by weather in all but the New
 Lands area, will probably total
 115,000,000-120,000,000 tons.
 Although 15 to 20 percent above
 the poor harvests of 1959 and
 1960, this will still be short
 of the 1958 bumper crop, which
 by non-Soviet estimates was
 probably about 130,000,000
 tons.   The USSR called it
 141,200,000,  and made this
 figure the point of departure
 for the 1965 goals,   While
 the traditional exaggeration
 of grain figures, some inflation
 will remain, and the Soviets
 may well claim that the 1961
 harvest is larger than that
 of 1.958
 Production of meat and
 milk in 1961 will probably about
 equal 1960 and will continue
 to lag badly behind the in-
 creases needed to meet the
 Seven-Year Plan goals.   More
 feed and slightly larger herds,
 as well as a mild winter and
 early spring,  have favored
 the industry.   On the other
 hand, meat production at the
 state slaughterhouses in the
 first half of this year was
 7 percent below the same period
 last year,  and the Soviet
 press has conspicuously avoided
 commenting on progress.   Cotton
 production is expected to be
 somewhat above the mediocre
 1960 crop, but dry weather in
 some of the important growing
 areas may keep the production
 of sugar beets,  sunflower seeds,
 and fiber flax below the rela-
 tively good 1960 crops.
 Eastern Europe
 In the European satellites,
 total production of grain is ex-
 pected to be about the same as
 last year--about 43,000,000 tons--
 largely because of the bumper
 harvest in Poland.   Preliminary
 estimates of grain output in
 1961 are down from 1960 in Bul-
 garia, East Germany, Hungary,
 and Rumania,  and up in Poland,
 Albania, and Czechoslovakia.
 Weather conditions, which had
 been generally favorable during
 the spring for most crops through-
 out the satellites, turned for
 the worse about mid-June.   As
 the only bloc member without
 any significant degree of col-
 lectivized agriculture,  Poland
 has apparently done much better
 than East Germany or Czecho-
 slovakia under similar weather
 conditions,  primarily because
 the collective units of the lat-
 ter two countries had higher
 harvest  losses.
 In spite of its bumper har-
 vest,  Poland will still need to
 import about 1,000,000 tons of
 grain if livestock herds and grain
 consumption are to be maintained
 at current levels,   With the re-
 cent US decision   to delay signing
 of a PL-480 agreement,  Poland is
 left with import commitments of
 only 600,000 tons.   If import needs
 are not met,  the government will
 have to increase procurement of
 domestic grain by raising com-
 pulsory delivery quotas and/or in-
 creasing free market  purchases to
 guarantee the grain supply.
 With the possible exception of
 Albania,  no basic improvement in
 the per capita availability of
 food for the satellites is ex-
 pected during 1961/62.   East Ger-
 many, Hungary,  and Bulgaria will
 probably encounter most difficulty
 in meeting consumer demands for
 foodstuffs.   The most  serious
 shortages are likely in East Ger-
 many unless it can increase its
 imports,  an effort which Walter
 Ulbricht has said will not be made.
 Nevertheless, availability of quality

 of the National Economo  the
 USSR for 1960 gives a figure
 for housing construction in
 that year considerably lower
 than the amount originally
 claimed in the official plan
 report.   This is a new indication
 that the priority for housing
 construction has been reduced
 and casts doubt on the possi-
 bility of achieving.the Seven-
 Year Plan (1959-65) for housing.
 A substantial underfdlf illment''of
 the plan in 1960 and subsequent
 housing'data appear to indicate
 that, the Soviet regime decided
 in mid-1960 to sacrifice part
 of the popular housing program.
 to other construction projects.
 The handbook figure is
 82,800,000 square meters, 2,200,-
 000 lower than the total origi-
 nally claimed and only 3 percent
 above performance in 1959.   This
 reduction, which may be in part
 an attempt at statistical
 correction,  is the latest'in a
 series that started in December
 1959.   At that time it was
 anticipated by State Planning
 Committee (Gosplan) chief
 Novikov that, of the 1960 hous-
 ing goal of 101,000,000 square
 meters of new urban housing,
 only about 92,000,006 would be
 completed.   In January 1961,
 the plan fulfillment announce-
 ment stated that about 85,000-
 000 square meters had been
 built during the previous year.,.
 The original reductions
 seemed attributable to a; slow-
 down in private housing con-
 struction, probably because of
 the reported cancellation of
 state loans for private housing.
 Subsequent information, however,
 points to a substantial cutback
 of housing to be built under
 the state plan.
 indicated that judging by state
 housing accomplishment in 1958
 and of 1959, the 1960 plan would
 probably be overfulfilled by 7
 to 9 percent.   Instead, however,
 the state housing goal for
 1960 was underfulfilled by 7
 percent.
 This lower rate of housing
 construction continued into 1961;
 the report on the first six months
 showed that only about 24 percent
 of the year's state housing had
 been completed.   In spite of a
 sharp improvement in July, state
 housing completions still lagged
 behind those of the first seven
 months of 1960 by about 2 per-
 cent.
 A lower priority for hous-
 ing is also indicated by the
 decline in housing's share of
 the volume of state construc-
 tion to 28.7 percent in 1960
 from 30.9 percent in 1959.and
 32.6 percent in 1958.   Further-
 more, while the 1960 housing
 plan was substantially under-
 fulfilled, the over-all construc-
 tion plan was virtually fulfilled.
 The shortfall in state housing
 in 1960 was so large that only
 about half of it can be attrib-
 uted to technical difficulties
 during the transition to new
 construction methods.
 The chronic shortage of
 housing in the USSR causes more
 intense and widespread dissatis-
 faction than any other aspect
 of Soviet life.   Accordingly, ' ' .
 there has been no publicity on
 the lowered priority for hous-
 ing,  in contrast to the fanfare
 accompanying;the high priority
 given to housing in 1957--which
 resulted in a sharp rise in
 housing in subsequent years.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 HUNGARIAN FIVE-YEAR PLAN REVISED
 Following above-plan per-
 formance in 1959 and 1960,  the
 Hungarian regime has announced
 higher goals for production in
 certain industries and for na-
 tional income in its Second
 Five-Year Plan  (1961-65).  Planned
 investments have been cut,  how--
 ever,  allowing larger expendi-
 tures for military purposes and,
 possibly,  for repaying foreign
 loans.
 The goals established in
 the original   directives,  pub-
 lished in September 1959. were
 generally more conservative than
 the Five-Year Plan goals of any
 other satellite,  and apparently
 this conservative outlook pre-
 vails.   The average rate of in-
 crease in industrial production
 from 1958 to 1965 now is planned
 at 9.0 to 9.4 percent a year,
 compared with 7.4 to 7.9 percent
 a year in the 1959 directives.
 Since the growth of industrial
 production was about 11 percent
 a year during 1959-60,  the rate
 of growth for 1961-65 will have
 to be only 8.5 percent to meet
 the five-year goal,  or just
 slightly higher than the maxi-
 mum rate planned previously for
 the seven-year period.
 Agricultural production is
 to increase 30 to 32 percent by
 1965 over the 1954-58 average.
 This target, which requires an
 average annual rate of growth
 of 3.5 percent from 1960,  ap-
 pears to be the most realistic
 of any bloc goal for agriculture.
 National income is expected
 to increase 55 to 60 percent
 from 1958 to 1965 instead of the
 50 percent in the original
 directives.   This increase re-
 flects both the higher goals for
 industrial production and the
 above-plan performance during
 1959-60.   Nevertheless, total
 capital investment during
 the five-year period will be
 10 to 12 percent less than
 previously planned.   This scal-
 ing down of investment targets,
 however,  is not designed to
 benefit the consumer,  as per-
 sonal consumption is still
 to increase slowly.   The offi-
 cial explanation for increas-
 ing the goals for production
 but not those for investments
 is the need to raise expendi-
 tures connected with national
 defense.
 However, increases 'in nation-
 al income probably  will permit
 larger repayments than origi-
 nally planned on loans re-
 ceived from bloc countries
 after the Hungarian revolt in
 1956.   No postponement in re-
 payments of Soviet credits
 has been reported for 1962-
 65, and no new credits to
 Hungary have been announced
 to offset such repayments.
 Because the now plan is
 so conservative,  it probably
 will?be fulfilled in its main
 aspects                        (Pre- .     25X1

 COMMUNIST CHINA CELEBRATES NATIONAL DAY
 Peiping gave little public-    China's  socialist  construc-
 ity to the advance preparations   I tion.
 for National Day (1 October)
 in 1961.  The festivities in
 Peiping were similar in form to
 those of 1960. The populace was
 given a two-day holiday and a
 few extra rations were issued--
 but for the first time these in-
 cluded no meat,   a fact which
 reflects the austerity forced
 on the regime by its economic
 setbacks.  As in 1960, the:cus-
 tomary mammoth parade of half
 a million persons included mili-
 tia but no military units. The
 official press states that
 2,000 guests from more than 70
 countries were present, but
 fails to add that many of these
 were students, diplomats, and
 others already resident in Chi-
 na. The only prominent foreign
 visitors were the President of
 Cuba, the King and Queen of
 Nepal, and Dowager Queen   1+.-
 abeth of Belgium.
 On foreign policy matters,
 Peiping's attempt to paint a
 rosy picture of Sino-Soviet
 friendship was belied by unre-
 sponsive Soviet speeches and
 unenthusiastic Soviet attend-
 ance at National Day functions
 in both Peiping and Moscow. In
 its unctuous speech on 28
 September, Chinese    arsa~? ,
 Liu Hsiao promised his Soviet
 audience in Moscow that Peiping,
 following Mao Tse-tung's teach-
 ings, would preserve Sino-Soviet
 solidarity like the "apple of
 our eye."  Liu again endorsed
 the Soviet Berlin stand and in-
 timated--for the first time by
 a Chinese spokesman--that the
 Soviet party's draft program
 has validity outside the USSR.
 Back in China, People's Daily
 also acknowledged Soviet ex-
 perience could be helpful in
 The Russians gave only
 perfunctory attention to the
 Chinese anniversary.   In a
 speech at a Moscow reception on
 29 September, First Deputy
 Premier Kozlov reiterated stand-
 ard expressions of Soviet sup-
 port for Peiping's "lawful place"
 in the United Nations and for
 liberation of Taiwan. He avoided
 anything that could be construed
 as Soviet tolerance of Chinese
 ideological claims. In Peiping,
 the Soviet delegation attending
 the ceremonies contained no
 major figures.
 For the second year,  Chou En-
 lai did not give a banquet for
 Soviet experts in China, a fur-
 ther indication that Soviet techni-
 cians have not returned in numbers.
 The tone of both press and
 public pronouncements on China's
 domestic outlook was at sharp
 variance with last year's. Al-
 though it was evident by Octo-
 ber 1960 that the regime was in
 economic trouble, particularly
 in agriculture, the full gravity
 of the situation was not acknowl-
 edged last year.  The People's
 Daily editorial of a year ago
 stated,  "There is every possibil-
 ity for the Chinese people to
 catch up with Britain... within
 a period of less than ten years."
 It spoke of the great leap for-
 ward as a continuing movement
 and called for an "unprecedented
 bumper summer harvest in 1961,"
 The corresponding People's Daily
 editorial in 1961 admitted to
 a "reduction of agricultural
 output" as a result of "three
 successive years of grave nat-
 ural calamities',;'  regarding
 industrial  production, the

 editorial eschewed further ex-
 pansion for the time being and
 simply suggested "readjusting,
 consolidating, filling out, and
 raising standards" for 1961 and
 1962.
 In its most specific :ref -
 erence.to.  industrial production,
 People's  bail   stated  that'..
 "14 out of Dail
 2-     main targets"
 for the Second Five-Year Plan
 were fulfilled in 1959 and 1960.
 If this is compared with Li Fu-
 chun's announcement in March
 1960 that 13 out of the 24 major
 industrial and agricultural prod-
 ucts had reached their 1962
 targets by the end of 1959, there
 is a clear implication that in-
 dustry made little or no progress
 during either 1960 or 1961 over
 the level achieved in 1959.
 The regime maintained that
 the party's general policies have
 always been correct, but conceded
 a need to perfect the means for
 putting them into practice.  The
 theoretical journal Red Flag
 stated in its 1 OctoVer editorial
 that "many of our cadres are
 familiar with wars and revolu-
 tion but they are not versed
 in the rules and regulations
 of socialist construction."
 The editorial commented that
 the party has called for a new
 study movement to take up
 "questions concerning the building
 of socialism':'.'  There was no
 indication that the study move-
 ment would take on the pro-
 portions of a party purge.
 At the top level,  a11. full
 members of the poliburo were
 represented in the ceremonies at
 Peiping except Peng Te-huai--
 whose standing has been in
 question since September 1959--

 PEIPING'S RELATIONS WITH JAPAN
 Communist China has in re-
 cent weeks engaged in a propa-
 ganda campaign of growing shrill-
 ness against the Japanese Govern-
 ment.   Peiping's anger began
 when the Ikeda government refused
 visas for a Chinese Communist
 delegation to the Japanese
 Communist party congress in late
 July. The official Peiping
 Peovle's Daily said the act
 exposed Ikeda as "devoid of any
 sincerity for improving Sino-
 Japanese relations."  The dele-
 gation would have been the
 highest Chinese Communist group
 ever to attend a party
 gathering in a non-Communist
 country.
 However,  it was ex - Prime
 Minister Kishi's visit to Taiwan
 in mid-August which actually
 triggered the current rash of
 invective.   The visit,  although
 a private one, was viewed by
 Peiping as a blatant manifesta-
 tion of Japanese plotting, with
 Ikeda's connivance, to create
 "two Chinas."  Particularly
 galling to Communist China was
 Kishi's reference to Taiwan and
 Japan as "two countries."  Pei-
 ping even accused Japan of having
 designs on the island.

 Communist China's appre-
 hensions of a resurgent Japan
 in the Far East are comparable
 to the bloc attitude toward
 the possible revival of a mili-
 tarized Germany in Europe.   "The
 iron hooves of Japanese aggres-
 sion are rattling again," Pei-
 ping asserts, adding that Japa-
 nese monopolists and militarists
 now are actively collaborating
 with Washington and Taipei in
 schemes against Communist China.
 Chief of Staff Lo Jui-ching,
 condemning alleged US-Japanese
 connivance in planning a North-
 east Asian military alliance,
 warned on 28 September that
 China "would never permit" Japa-
 neseaggressive designs to come
 to fruition.
 The ghost of Japan.'s "Great-
 er East Asia Co-Prosperity
 Sphere" of the World War II is
 revived in connection with what
 Peiping regards as evidence of
 Japan's political and economic
 expansion in Southeast Asia.
 Such warnings to Asians
 probably reflect a sensitivity
 to Japanese economic penetration
 into Southeast Asian markets
 Peiping hoped to have for itself
 before economic difficulties on
 the mainland stalled its foreign
 trade offensive.
 Chinese Communist hostility
 toward Ikeda seems to have
 reached the level of that direct-
 04.1 at Kishi, with whom the
 Chinese said they could have no
 dealings.   Visits to China by
 members of the governing Liberal-
 Democratic part's -were, once en-
 couraaged,:,but Liberal-Democratic
 visitors in June received only a
 perfunctory welcome.
 Peiping is particularly
 annoyed over moves by the
 Socialist party--formerly Peiping's
 principal channel to left-wing
 elements in Japan--and its af-
 filiated labor federation, Sohyo,
 to dissociate themselves from
 united-front activities with
 the Japanese Communist party
 against Japan's ties with the
 US.   The Socialists and Sohyo
 have instead begun to espouse
 their own program of apparent
 neutrality aimed at winning
 greater popular support.   Clearly
 piqued, Peiping last summer
 asked the Japanese Socialists to
 delay sending a scheduled mission
 to the mainland.
 More recently, Peiping
 responded to feelers from the
 Socialists concerning the dispatch
 of a delegation to the National
 Day celebrations with an unethusi-
 astic, "Come if you want;.,to.'!,,(:Still,
 Peiping has not attacked the
 Socialists publicly, suggesting
 it may still hope that they will
 be able to play a useful role in
 promoting Peiping's and the Com-
 munists' interests.
 Meanwhile, Peiping seems to
 be placing a greater reliance
 on the Japanese Communist party

 FACTIONALISM IN SOUTH KOREAN REGIME
 The arrest by security
 forces on 25 September of 28
 persons linked to the vice chair-
 man of South Korea's Supreme
 Council for National Recon-
 struction  (SCNR), Maj. Gen. Yi
 Chu-il,  is the latest mani-
 festation of a major factional
 struggle between Yi and national
 security boss Col. Kim Chong-
 pil.                   Both men head powerful
 alliances within the military
 junta.  The chairman of the
 SCNR, Lt. Gen.Pak Chong-hui,
 is believed to stand above the
 conflict and to be working to
 prevent a Showdown.   Should he
 fail, the stability of the
 regime would be endangered.
 Following the purge of the
 coup's front man, Lt. Gen. Chang
 To-yong, in'July, two major fac-
 tions emerged in the junta--one
 led by Kim,  the other jointly
 led by Yi and marine Maj. Gen.
 Kim Tong-ha.   The core of Kim
 Chong-pills faction is a group
 of young officers who were in
 the "eighth  class"--the class
 of 1949--at the Korean Military
 Academy.   This class suffered
 severe casualties in the Korean
 war and subsequently found
 promotions blocked by the rela-
 tively youthful generals.   The
 officers in Kim's faction tend
 to favor protracted military
 rule and authoritarian measures
 to solve the country's economic
 and political problems.   Yi's
 faction is made up largely of
 senior officers who are more
 inclined to preserve accustomed
 relationships and institutions.
 All those seized on 25
 September are alleged to have
 been involved in preferential
 treatment, based on regional
 loyalties, to "illicit-fortune
 seekers."  Those favored are
 among the 27 business leaders
 who dominate the country's
 economy and who have been ordered
 to pay $37,000,000 in back taxes
 and fines within six months.   In
 order to force the regime to grant
 them more favorable terms, they
 have cut back their business
 activities, thus depressing the
 domestic economy.   Feeling
 against the group is believed to
 be particularly strong among
 Kim's faction, which tends to
 favor the nationalization of
 industry.   Pak's position on
 nationalization is unknown, but
 the struggle between Kim and
 Yi may increase the pressure on
 Pak to approve a state-operated
 economy.

 any showdown, Kim's  ac ion
 has the advantage that he controls
 the secret police.   Furthermore,
 the 800 or more members of the
 "eighth class" still on active
 duty include a high proportion
 of battalion commanders, the
 lowest echelon of command to
 exercise court-martial juris-
 diction and one of the highest

 GHANA
 The Nkrumah regime's ar-
 rest on 3 October of prominent
 political adversaries and lead-
 ers of the union which spear-
 headed last month's strikes
 underscores the President's de-
 termination to forestall the
 emergence of any effective op-
 position movement.  The move
 suggests that Nkrumah, who
 appears determined to increase
 Ghana's ties with the bloc and
 to press ahead with the imple-
 mentation of "socialist ideals"
 at home, will rely even more
 than in the past on repressive
 measures to silence his
 critics.
 Included among some 50 per-
 sons taken into custody were
 P,K. .K. .:.Quaido,. a   member   of
 the right wing of the ruling
 Convention People's party  (CPP)
 and a former cabinet minister,
 and Joseph Appiah,  the deputy
 leader of the small parliamentary
 group of the opposition United
 party (UP).   Veteran politician
 J. B. Danquah,  the UP's candi-
 date against Nkrumah in last
 year's presidential election,

 gainst the arrests.  A govern-
 ment labor official has fore-
 cast "real trouble" for the
 regime.
 Nkrumah did not move at
 the same time against K. A.
 Gbedemah, a long-time associate
 who was ousted from the govern-
 ment last week along with other
 moderates who have expressed
 their opposition to Nkrumah's
 increasing alignment with the
 bloc and reliance on left-wing:
 advisers.   This seeming over-
 sight probably is attributable
 to Gbedemah's close indentifi-
 cation, especially in the minds
 of Western negotiators, with
 the still-unsigned Volta River
 project.
 However, Gbedemah's re-
 moval from the political scene
 is almost certainly only a
 matter of time and may follow
 quickly, especially if Nkrumah
 is or becomes convinced that
 his former lieutenant is plan-
 ning an attempt to rally the
 many discontented elements in
 the country to his leadership.
 Gbedemah stated publicly after
 his ouster that he intended to
 remain active in politics.
 The detainees, who were ac-
 cused of plotting Nkrumah's
 assassination and other "sub-
 versive activities," were round-

 BRITAIN AND THE COMMON MARKET
 In response to a request
 from the six Common Market  (EEC)
 countries, London has agreed to
 outline to a preliminary minis-
 terial meeting in Paris on 10
 and 11 October the specific con-
 cessions it seeks in applying
 for EEC membership.   These con-
 ditions have heretofore been
 couched in generalities.   To
 present the case in some detail,
 Britain's representative, Lord
 Privy Seal Heath, will reported-
 ly tender six "papers" and make
 a two-hour statement.
 prime Minister Macmillan
 has insisted from the beginning
 that the terms of entry must
 take account of the welfare of
 Britain's farmers and the com-
 mercial interests of its Com-
 monwealth and Outer Seven part-
 ners.  As long as it was unclear
 exactly what this would involve,
 Macmillan could maintain that
 these interests would not be
 seriously hurt, while dampening
 EEC suspicions that he might
 be thinking of fundamental
 treaty changes.
 Developments of the past
 few weeks will complicate
 Heath's task of taking a suf-
 ficiently forthcoming attitude
 toward the Six without arousing
 further domestic and Common-
 wealth opposition.   At meetings
 in Accra and London recently,
 Commonwealth criticism of
 British accession was much
 sharper than in midsummer (one
 participant called the Accra
 talks the "bloodiest" of such
 meetings), and emphasis shifted
 somewhat from worry over trade
 to fear for Commonwealth co-
 hesion.   Some of this criticism,
 especially from Australia and
 Canada, was no doubt calculated
 to encourage London to be "tough"
 with the EEC.
 The Macmillan government
 was jarred,  however, by the
 hostility to the Common Market
 expressed by Nigeria, Ghana,
 and Sierra Leone,   Association
 of these three countries with
 the EEC--on the same basis as
 the ex-French and Belgian African
 territories--had seemed one way
 to avoid a "commercial division"
 of Africa.
 While all six EEC countries
 appear to welcome, with varying
 degrees of enthusiasm,  the
 prospect of Britain's entry,
 none appears ready to sacrifice
 fundamental EEC principles.
 Indicative of this,  the EEC
 Council declared following its
 26 September meeting that "re-
 quest for membership in the
 community implies on the one
 hand acceptance without reser-
 vation of the rules and objec-
 tives of the EEC treaty, and on
 the other hand membership in the
 two other existing communities
 --the Coal-Steel Community and
 Euratom."
 The need to preserve a
 common front when the hard
 bargaining begins has been the major
 difficulty the Six have had in
 organizing themselves for the
 talks with London.   France is
 still opposed to a permanent
 chairman of the EEC delegation,
 favoring instead a rotation
 system which would bring Couve
 de Murville to the chair during
 the probably crucial negotiating
 period early next year.   Paris
 has had to agree,  however,  that
 the talks opening in November
 will be held in Brussels,  the
 seat of the Common Market,
 and that the EEC Commission     25X1
 will attend as adviser and
 participate fully in coordinating
 the EEC position.

 Cuban President Dorticos
 left Peiping for Moscow on 3
 October on the final leg of
 his month-long tour of the
 bloc.   The Cuban-Chinese com--
 muniqu6 cited Peiping's "pleas-
 ure" that Cuba has "chosen the
 road of socialist development,"
 The communiques following his
 Czech and Soviet visits in Sep-
 tember had treated the subject
 of Cuba's adoption of "social-
 ism" with similar reserve.   All
 three bloc nations gave full
 support to most other Cuban
 themes, with Czechoslovakia and
 Communist China endorsing Cuba's
 claim that the US "occupation"
 of Guantanamo naval base is
 "unlawful."  There has also
 been ample bloc propaganda
 .coverage of Havana's increas-
 ingly frequent charges that a
 "new US invasion of Cuba" is
 being readied.
 A delegation led by the
 Cuban under secretary of foreign
 trade arrived in Moscow on 27
 September to negotiate details
 of the Cuban-Soviet 1962 trade
 program and may go on to other
 bloc countries later.   The Cas-
 tro regime probably will press
 for a larger volume of bloc
 foodstuffs and other vital,con-
 sumer goods to lessen the effect
 of increasing shortages in these
 areas.
 In a speech on~.29 September,
 Castro announced he had received
 "good news" concerning bloc
 purchases of Cuban sugar in 1962
 in a communication from "Comrade
 Dorticos and Comrade Blas Roca."
 Roca, a long-time Cuban Commute
 nist leader whose influence in
 the government reportedly has.
 increased sharply in recent
 .months, played an important role
 in the Dorticos delegation's
 discussions with bloc officials.
 According to Castro, the
 bloc has agreed to buy 4,500,000
 tons of sugar for the next four
 years at more than the world
 market price.  This would be
 500,000 tons over the amount
 scheduled to be purchased by
 the bloc this year.  However,
 in a 4 October press conference
 in Moscow, Dorticos said the
 bloc would purchase "at least"
 4,860,000 tons of sugar annually
 through 1965.

 Cuba may further serve to harden

 Costa Rica severed relations
 with Havana on 10 September..
 However, the Goulart adminis-
 t,rat.i.on   in Brazil--whose
 attitude toward Castro would
 be of' key importance in
 any formal consideration of
 possible OAS action on Cuba--
 has categorically declared it-
 self opposed to any "interven-
 tion" in Cuban affairs.
 Ecuador and Mexico, which
 previously have expressed res-
 ervations on any multilateral
 consideration  of the Cuban
 problem, have given no indica-
 tions of changing this posi-
 tion thus far.   Several other
 Latin American states which
 have long opposed the Castro
 regime, including Peru and
 Guatemala, have recently shown
 sharper hostility toward Castro.
 Guatemala has requested Panama
 to notify Castro that Guatemal
 will permit the establishment
 of a Cuban government in exile
 in its territory unless former
 Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz
 is expelled from Cuba within a
 month.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 EL SALVADOR
 El Salvador's provisional
 military regime, strongly com-
 mitted to a program of basic
 socio-economic reform, is making
 preparations for a constituent
 assembly election in December.
 The regime came to power in a
 military coup against a Commu-
 nist-infiltrated government
 last, January, and the young
 officers who dominate it are
 convinced that speedy reform
 is the only alternative to a
 Communist take-over.  Theirs
 has been the first Latin Ameri-
 can government to launch a re-
 form program in line with the
 concepts of the Alliance for
 Progress since these concepts
 were outlined by President
 Kennedy early this year.
 Since the new regime came
 to power, the United States has
 authorized $23,000,000 in eco-
 nomic assistance, mostly in the
 form of loans.   In addition,
 the Inter-American Development
 Bank has lent $8,000,000, and
 another $9,000,000 is being
 negotiated.
 The upsurge of Communist
 activity in El Salvador follow-
 ing the ouster of the Lemus ad-
 ministration last October had,
 frightened members of the long-
 dominant "fourteen families" '
 and convinced some of them that
 reforms are necessary.   By early
 March, however, there were signs
 of open resistance to the new
 government's reform program as
 the elite families began to
 realize that their position was
 being threatened by their long-
 time ally, the Salvadoran Army.
 The government's first reform
 measure, a decree providing for
 a paid day of rest on Sundays
 for agricultural workers, was
 the first measure   by any
 Salvadoran government  in favor
 of agricultural workers, who
 compromise the bulk of the coun-
 try's population and have
 generally lived at bare sub-
 sistence levels under an eco-
 nomic system little changed
 since colonial times.   Other
 reforms have included the
 lowering of rents in urban
 tenements and increased govern-
 ment control of the institu-
 tion--long dominated by the
 big coffee planters--which
 regulates coffee sales, the
 country's principal source
 of export earnings.
 The provisional regime
 hopes that the support its
 reforms are winning from the
 lower and middle classes will
 assure its newly organized
 political party control of
 the constituent assembly to
 be elected late this year.
 The diverse political parties
 in existence prior to the
 establishment of the "official"
 party are considering the
 formation of an opposition
 coalition.   Such a coalition
 would probably'have the support
 both of recalcitrant landowners
 and Communist and pro-Communist
 groups; such tactical alliances
 have been made in the past in
 El Salvador.
 Government leaders are
 seeking to avoid a climate of
 class warfare and have ener-
 getically sought to convince
 the elite families that their
 long-range interests would be
 best served by supporting the
 government's program.   Last
 week the government made a con-
 cession to the landowning groups
 by modifying and postponing the
 effective date of a decree
 setting minimum standards for
 the food which agricultural
 laborers receive as part of
 their wages.   This move was
 probably a'pre-election tactic
 signifying no weakening of
 the resolve of government
 leaders to carr   out their
 reform program.

 SOVIET TRANSPORTS IN THE WORLD AVIATION MARKET
 Moscow's efforts to pene-
 trate the international avi-
 ation market and to conclude
 civil air agreements outside
 the bloc have focused attention
 on the degree to which Soviet
 aircraft--particularly the
 latest model jet and turboprop.
 transports--are commercially
 competitive with comparable
 Western models.   There are few
 important differences in per-
 formance and design character-
 istics.   On the other hand,
 Western aircraft are generally
 superior in such factors as
 fuel economy, maintenance,
 durability,  safety, and comfort.
 For several years the
 Soviet Union has indicated a
 willingness to sell its large
 transports outside the bloc,
 but the IL-18,  a medium-range
 turboprop,  is the first model
 it has backed with a serious
 promotional effort,  including
 offers at reduced prices and
 on particularly favorable credit
 terms.   In mid-1960, Avtoexport

 authorized to seek nonbloc buyers
 for IL-18s and other civil air-
 craft,  including helicopters;
 commercial officers from 23
 foreign embassies in Moscow
 were given demonstration flights.
 Since then the USSR has delivered
 nine IL-leis to Ghana,  two to
 Guinea,  and two to Mali.   Offers
 to other underdeveloped countries
 have not been accepted.
 Characteristics and Performance
 A comparison of Soviet
 transports with those of the
 West as to range,  speed,  carry-
 ing capacity,  and landing
 facilities required reveal few
 significant differences.   Most
 such comparisons reveal that
 the deficiency of a Soviet
 plane under one of these head-
 ings is balanced by shortcomings
 of its Western counterpart in
 some other category.
 An outstanding exception
 to the general comparability

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 is the long-range turboprop
 TU-114, which is clearly supe-
 rior to any Western transport
 in flight-range and passenger
 capacity;  the TU-114 can carry
 from 120 to 220 passengers
 up to 5,400 miles.    On the
 other hand, few countries
 have enough territory to
 warrant the purchase of such
 a long-range transport. Khru-
 shchev himself has admitted
 that the TU-114 is basically
 a bomber and is unsuitable
 for passenger service.
 Weaknesses common to
 all Soviet transports are
 the high rate of fuel con-
 sumption and the use of
 heavier airframe structures
 than are manufactured in the
 West.   The carrying capacity
 of Soviet transports is also
 reduced by the heavier weight
 of the aircraft engines.
 Soviet aircraft are also
 inferior in comfort and con-
 venience,   The TU-104,  for
 example,  is extremely noisy.
 Cabin pressurization is often
 erratic,  and cabin temperature
 is said never to exceed 60?F.
 Passengers are reportedly
 distracted by excessive
 structural vibrations.  A
 further cause of inconvenience
 is the comparately small size
 of the cabin doors.
 Safety
 The Soviet Union,  unlike
 Western countries, is not a
 member of the International
 Civil Aviation Organization,
 which sets rigid safety charac-
 teristics for its members'
 planes.   The large number of
 crashes of TU-104s and IL-18s
 within the past few years attests
 to the inferiority of Soviet
 aircraft to Western models in
 safety characteristics. Because
 of its high landing speed,  there
 have been many cases of tire
 failures on the TU-104, and on
 occasion water trucks have been
 employed to wet down the brakes.
 Few underdeveloped countries
 have runways long enough to
 accommodate a TU-104 safely.
 Serious safety deficiencies
 have also been evident in the

 IL-18s, and they were grounded
 for a time in 1960 following
 a series of widely publicized
 crashes.   The trouble apparent-
 ly resulted from engine fires,
 which could not be confined
 and extinguished because of
 lack of adequate fire protec-
 tion.   Although the IL-18s
 are again flying,  there is re-
 portedly still considerable
 skepticism about the aircraft.'s
 safety among Soviet and satel-
 lite travelers.   The operational
 safety of several other medium
 transports--the AN     AN-10,
 and AN-12--is also questionable,
 since they use the same engine
 as the IL-18.
 An additional defect of
 Soviet turboprop transports
 is the comparatively lengthy
 time required to feather mal-
 functioning engines;  a few
 seconds lost can mean serious
 structural damage.
 Cost and Economy
 The initial unit cost is
 lower for Soviet transports
 than for the equivalent Western
 aircraft,  but such hidden
 costs as those arising from
 maintenance problems and ex-
 pensive spare parts requirements.
 make the difference illusory.
 The high cost of spare
 parts can make the Soviet air-
 craft expensive,  even as a
 gift.   Hungary received three
 IL-18s gratis only to learn
 later that the necessary stock
 of spare parts would cost more
 than the assessed value of
 the aircraft.   Maintenance
 is easier for purchasers of
 Western aircraft.   US aircraft
 manufacturers have offered
 buyers complete maintenance
 facilities in their own coun-
 tries,  thus obviating the need
 for lengthy waits for parts
 and overhaul.
 Frequency of overhaul.
 has also been a serious draw-
 back of Soviet aircraft.   Soviet
 aircraft engines average only
 200 hours before major over-
 haul.   By comparison,  the
 average intervals between
 engine overhauls on Western
 aircraft is 1,000 to 1,300
 hours.   Soviet propellers,
 likewise,  are short-lived.
 The estimated life of a propeller
 blade for the Soviet turboprop
 engine is only 300 to 600 hours,
 as opposed to 2,500 hours for
 a comparable Western model.
 The result is a vast dis-
 parity in the operational avail-
 ability of a Soviet aircraft
 and a comparable Western model.
 US jet transports,  for example,
 fly on the average three times
 as much as their Soviet counter-
 parts.
 Even bloc purchasers have
 accepted Soviet aircraft re-
 luctantly.
 Soviet aircraft purchased
 by nonbloc countries have had
 other serious faults affecting
 economy of the operation.   The
 AN-12 turboprop transports,
 for example,  have experienced
 fuel tank ruptures and blown
 tires.   Ghana Airways has had
 to change its Khartoum-to-Accra
 schedule from a weekly to a
 bimonthly run because of engine
 failures on the IL-13 in the
 African heat.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Prospects for Soviet Sales
 The shortcomings and un-
 suitability of some models
 of Soviet aircraft have been
 readily recognized by pro--
 spective purchasers, who have
 viewed Soviet offers with
 skepticism.   Thus the Soviet
 Union has never been able to
 sell the TU-104 outside the
 bloc, although it has fre-
 quently offered the plane to
 Middle East countries.   How-
 ever,  Soviet willingness to
 sell at a reduced price and
 to provide favorable terms--
 especially including payment
 in native currency--are
 strong inducements and have
 brought limited acceptance
 of the IL-18.
 The newest transports
 in the Soviet inventory--
 the short-range turboprop
 AN-24 and short-range jet
 TU-124--are smaller, and more
 economical than earlier models,
 and offers of these aircraft
 to underdeveloped countries
 will   probably  meet  with
 greater   success

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PRESIDENT KEKKONEN OF FINLAND
 Urho Kekkonen, who will
 visit the United States for
 approximately two weeks begin-
 ning 16 October,  in almost six
 years as President and previous
 periods as prime minister has
 become Finland's most contro-
 versial postwar leader..  Now
 nearing the end of his term as
 President,  Kekkonen is in the
 midst of a bitterly contested
 campaign for re-election early
 next year.
 The Finnish presidency is
 invested by the constitution
 with special powers in the con-
 duct of foreign relations,  and
 Kekkonen has wielded these pow-
 ers actively.   As a result, he
 has been sharply criticized for
 what many of his countrymen re-
 gard as an excessively accom-
 modating attitude toward the
 Soviet Union and a tendency to
 portray himself and his Agrarian
 party as the only elements in
 Finland capable of maintaining
 good relations with Moscow. He
 has incurred further criticism
 for keeping a hand in party
 politics despite a Finnish tra-
 dition of an austerely nonparti-
 san head of state.
 Born in north-central Fin-
 land. in 1900,  the son of a log-
 ging foreman, Kekkonen has been
 physically vigorous all his
 life.    He was national high-jump
 champion in his youth and en-
 gaged in a six-mile ski race
 with 58-year-old King Olav dur-
 ing his state visit to Norway
 earlier this year.   Kekkonen
 studied law at the University
 of Helsinki and received his
 Doctorate of Law degree there
 in 1936,  after having done post-
 graduate study in Germany.
 As a young lawyer, Kekkonen
 dedicated himself to a political
 career and eventually became le-
 gal adviser to the Agrarian par-
 ty--one of Finland's three
 largest parties,  along with the
 Social Democrats and the Commu-
 nist-front Finnish People's
 Democratic League  (SKDL).   Kek-
 konen,  like other aspiring young
 politicians who joined the party
 during this period when it suf-
 fered  from a dearth of young
 leaders, is widely referred to
 as an "asphalt agrarian" because
 of his tenuous connection with
 the rank-and-file small farmers.
 Kekkonen was first elected
 to parliament in 1936 and rose
 rapidly in government circles.
 By the time of the Winter War
 with the USSR (1939-40), he had
 already held three ministerial
 posts.   Little is known of his
 official activities during
 World War II except that from
 1940 to 1943 he was chief of
 the Bureau for Displaced Per-
 sons, an organization whose task
 was to aid refugees from Karelia,
 the border province lost to the
 USSR in 1944.
 Postwar Career
 Following the war, Kekkonen
 served in a number of high posi-
 tions,  including that of direc-
 tor of the Bank of Finland and
 minister of justice.   While
 serving in the latter capacity
 from 1944 to 1946 he handled the
 proceedings against eight prom-
 inent Finnish wartime leaders
 who at Soviet insistence were
 tried as "war responsibles."
 These trials aroused much re-
 sentment and controversy in

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUM
 Finland since the overwhelming
 majority of Finns regarded the
 eight as patriots.  Kekkonen
 incurred the dislike of conserv-
 ative  and labor groups as a
 result of his part in the trial,
 even though he played a rela-
 tively minor role in the actual
 proceedings.
 He first became premier in
 1950,  and before he was elected
 president in 1956 had headed
 five cabinets--nearly all of
 them coalitions composed of
 Agrarians and Social Democrats.
 It was during this period that
 Kekkonen established his repu-
 tation as the leading Agrarian
 party politician and tightened
 his control of the party, which
 he has retained to this day. He
 also became known as one of the
 few non-Communist political
 leaders in Finland considered
 persona grata by Moscow,  and
 began to groom himself to suc-
 ceed the aging elder statesman
 Juho Paasikivi,  a Conservative
 party member,  as Finland's next
 president,
 Presidency
 Kekkonen won the presidency
 by the narrowest margin in the
 history of Finland's electoral
 college--151 votes to 149 for
 his Social Democratic opponent.
 He has since sought to assume
 the dignity of his office,  but
 there remains a gap between the
 gregarious Kekkonen and the
 stereotype of the remote and
 austere presidents of Finland
 who are accorded a respect sim-
 ilar to the deference paid
 elsewhere to royalty.   He has
 proved to be a "strong" Pres--
 ident who has not hesitated to
 exercise to the fullest the ex-
 tensive powers granted him by
 the constitution.
 His term of office has
 been marked by bitter recrim-
 inations between his supporters
 and those of almost all the
 other non-Communist parties.
 In addition to charges that he
 has failed to rise above parti-
 san considerations and personal
 animosity in the discharge of
 his presidential duties, there
 has been sharp criticism of his
 performance in the all-impor-
 tant area of Soviet-Finnish
 relations.   He has chosen to
 deal personally with any seri-
 ous problems arising between
 Finland and the Soviet Union,
 and his frequent bypassing of
 the Foreign Ministry and of
 parliamentary committees in
 handling these matters has
 caused some resentment.
 Soviet-Finnish Relations
 Kekkonen's views on the
 nature of Finland's relations
 with the Soviet Union are di-
 rectly influenced by his belief
 that in order to maintain its
 precarious position of independ-
 ence, Finland can never pursue
 political or military policies
 in direct conflict with the
 strategic interests of the So-
 viet Union.   In essence this
 is what is referred to in Fin-
 land as the "Paasikivi line,"
 which Kekkonen's supporters,  in
 the campaign to choose presiden-
 tial electors this January, are
 seeking to describe as the
 "Paasikivi-Kekkonen line."   Ac-

 that Finland must pursue a pas-
 sive foreign policy, the prin-
 cipal objective of which is to
 avoid embroilment in disputes
 between the major powers.
 For Kekkonen the basic
 problem of Finnish foreign pol-
 icy is to convince the Soviet
 Union of the security of its
 northwestern frontiers and to
 assure Moscow of Finland's de-
 termination to resist attack
 which might be launched against
 the Soviet Union across Finland.
 Finnish officials regard this
 as the old problem of overcom-
 ing traditional Russian suspi-
 cion and seeking to assure Mos-
 cow of the security of adjacent
 strategic areas such as Lenin-
 grad and Murmansk,
 All non-Communist parties
 in Finland support this policy
 of nonprovocation, but there
 are differences of opinion as
 to how far Finland should rea-
 sonably be expected to go in
 this respect.   The opposition
 parties maintain that Kekkonen
 has carried the assurances of
 a friendly Finland on Soviet
 borders a step further and has
 acquiesced in Soviet interven-
 tion in Finland?s internal af-
 fairs.   They cite the 1958 cab-
 inet crisis when Moscow refused
 to conclude a trade agreement
 until the coalition government
 of Social Democratic Premier
 Fagerholm had been replaced by
 a government more to its liking.
 Kekkonnen?s handling of the ques-
 tion of Finland?s association
 with the European Free Trade
 Association (EFTA)  in early
 1961 is also criticized because
 he sounded out Moscow?s views
 beforehand, although only eco-
 nomic considerations were in-
 volvedo
 Kekkonen, however, main-
 tains that a policy of "brutal
 frankness and honesty" is
 necessary in dealing with the
 Russians and that even an es-
 sentially economic matter ac-
 quires political overtones in
 the eyes of the ever-suspicious
 Russians,   Finland,  therefore,
 must be prepared to go to great
 lengths to assuage these suspi-
 cions.
 Kekkonen?s views are also
 influenced by his pessimistic
 outlook on the outcome of the
 East-West struggle.   He be-,
 lieves that in the past few
 years the world balance of pow-
 er has shifted from the Western
 powers to the Sino-Soviet bloc.
 Recalling Finland?s lonely
 struggle against the USSR in
 1939-40 and the fact that the
 West did not come to the assist
 ante of Hungary in 1956, Kek-
 konen considers it his duty to
 order Finland's relations with
 the Soviet Union in such a
 manner that even if war breaks
 out between East and West,  Fin-
 land will remain unaffected.
 His more pro-Western critics
 regard this as not only illu-
 sory but also dangerous for
 Finland,  since it could lead
 to a "peace at any price" ap-
 proach in dealings with Moscow.
 Aware that the USSR could
 overwhelm Finland at any time,
 Kekkonen may be increasingly
 inclined to reconcile himself
 to a greater measure of Soviet
 intervention in Finnish affairs
 as the price to be paid to pre-
 vent outright annexation or
 absorption
 Most Finns as well as
 foreign observers concede that

 there is no doubt as to Kekko-
 nen?s patriotism or his resist-
 ance if confronted by flagrant
 encroachments on Finland?s in-
 dependence by the Soviet Union.
 His defenders point out that
 Kekkonen was one of three par-
 liamentary deputies who in 1940
 voted to continue the war with
 the Soviet Union rather than
 accept the onerous peace terms.
 They also refer to Kekkonen?s
 outspoken remarks at various
 official dinners and luncheons
 during Khrushchev?s visit to
 Helsinki in September 1960 on
 the occasion of Kekkonen?s 60th
 birthday.   The President then
 asserted that the Communist
 system was not an appropriate
 one for his country and that
 Finland would not become Com-
 munist--even if all Europe were
 converted--unless a majority of
 its people so desired; he added
 that he thought this would
 never be the case,
 Kekkonen?s critics, how-
 ever,  fear that in a crucial
 situation he may not have the
 courage and strength of charac-
 ter of Paasikivi, who,  they
 maintain, was ready to say "no"
 to Soviet demands when he be-
 lieved Finland's interests
 might be adversely affected.
 These critics also believe
 that Kekkonen is prepared to
 go to any lengths to lessen the
 possibility of Northern Europe?s
 involvement in a future war and
 that to accomplish this he
 would be prepared to try to
 push the Soviet line of coaxing
 Norway and Denmark away from
 NATO,   Thus far,  however,  he
 has not seriously advocated
 this line in his frequent con-
 tacts with his Scandinavian
 colleagues.
 Kekkonen has used exten-
 sive travel in Europe--particu-
 larly in Scandinavia--as one
 means of seeking to develop
 greater understanding of Fin-
 land's special position between
 East and West.   He has also
 made numerous trips to the
 Soviet Union, most recently in
 January 1959 when he met Khru-
 shchev in Leningrad to discuss
 the crisis in Finnish-Soviet re-
 lations.   Earlier this year
 Kekkonen made official visits
 to both Britain and Norway. His
 visit to Canada and the US is
 regarded by some observers as
 an effort to strengthen his po-
 sition in this pre-election
 period and to mollify critics
 who believe his numerous trips
 to the Soviet Union have given
 him a distorted view of the
 world power balance.
 How much Kekkonen?s own
 views may be affected by West-
 ern visits is somewhat ques-
 tionable
 Finns  generally  feel
 that   their   national  history
 has   left   them   little   to         25X1

 .CURRENT.INTEL?LIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The first anniversary of
 Cypriot independence--16 August
 1961--found the new republic
 facing a multitude of political
 and economic problems:   high
 unemployment., the fourth con-
 secutive year of drought, in-
 creasingly frequent outbursts
 of violence, and growing Com-
 munist strength.   Neither the
 Greek Cypriots (80 percent of
 the population) nor the Turkish
 Cypriots (18 percent) celebrated
 the anniversary, although gov-
 ernment leaders observed the
 event with a reception.   Unlike
 most colonial areas which have
 gained independence in recent
 years, there was never a move-
 ment for a free Cyprus, and no
 Cypriot "nationalism" exists
 today.
 The London-Zurich Agree-
 ments, which established the
 republic,  have been observed for
 the most part by all parties
 signing them in 1959--the Greek
 and Turkish Cypriot communities
 and the governments of Greece,
 Turkey, and Britain--because
 all of them prefer the present
 arrangement, unsatisfactory as
 it may be,  to the chaos that
 would follow their repudiation.
 Despite the island's many prob-
 lems, the complicated machinery
 of government set up primarily
 to protect the Turkish Cypriot
 minority has proved workable,
 largely because of the efforts
 of the Greek Cypriot President,
 Archbishop Makarios,  and the
 Turkish Cypriot vice president,
 Fazil Kuchuk.
 Neither Makarios nor Kuchuk
 has pressed demands for so-
 lutions to remaining specific
 disputes as long as further
 negotiations leading to a com-
 promise are possible.   When
 disputes within the government
 have come to a head, however,
 Makarios has acted with firm-
 ness bordering on disregard of
 the Turkish position.
 The two leaders are prob-
 ably aware that their subordi-
 nates and likely successors
 would be less likely to accept
 compromise--a fact that empha-
 sizes the necessity of settling
 outstanding problems before they
 leave office.   General elections
 are scheduled in 1965, and Ma-
 karios has frequently stated
 his desire to retire from po-
 litical life at the earliest
 opportunity..
 The two major problems to
 be negotiated between Greek
 and Turkish Cypriots when in-
 dependence was proclaimed were
 the establishment of separate
 Greek and Turkish municipal
 governments in the five cities
 on Cyprus--as provided for in
 the constitution--and the im-
 plementation of constitutional.
 provisions for a 70:30 ratio
 between Greeks and Turks in the
 civil service.   Considerable
 progress has been made toward
 fulfilling the requirement on
 civil service.
 Negotiations on municipal
 governments remain deadlocked,
 however, with the Greeks press-
 ing for administrative separa-
 tion and the Turks demanding
 geographic partition.   In April,
 the Turkish members of the legis-
 lature, in an effort to force a
 more rapid pace in negotiations,
 refused to approve an extension
 of the tax law.   Makarios or-
 dered the tax collectors to
 continue their work, despite
 general agreement that he lacked
 authorization for such a move.
 Recently there have been indi-
 cations that the Turks may be will-
 ing to modify their, position on
 the municipal governments issue.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMRY
 There has been a revival
 of extremism in both communi-
 ties.                     Reports of shootings
 and beatings of political op-
 ponents became more common in
 the summer of 1961.   There are
 continuing reports that both
 sides are smuggling arms into
 Cyprus for possible future use
 by terrorist groups.
 Among the Greeks, an or-
 ganization of former members
 of EOKA, the underground organ-
 ization which fought the British
 from 1955 to 1959, has been
 formed,  calling itself the Pan-
 Cyprian Organization of Fight-
 ers.   Both this organization
 and the leading non-Communist
 Greek Cypriot opposition party
 repeatedly have denounced
 Makarios for signing the London-
 Zurich Agreements and have re-
 vived the demand for "enosis"--
 union with Greece.
 Among the Turks,  there is
 an apparent loss of confidence
 in the settlement, based on fear
 of economic domination by the
 Greeks,  the delay in implement-
 ing the constitutional provi-
 sions designed to protect Turk-
 ish interests, and the revival
 of the enosis campaign.   Parti-
 tion,  long the Turkish reply to
 enosis, is again being suggest-
 ed 'as the "final answer."
 Communism is not at pres-
 ent a threat within the Turkish
 community,  but among the Greek
 Cypriots it remains the great-
 est potential danger for the
 future of the republic.   The
 Communist party,  known as the
 Restorative Party of the Work-
 ing People (AKEL),                 the only
 large organized political party
 on Cyprus,  received nearly 40
 percent of the Greek Cypriot
 vote in the 1960 legislative
 elections.   The party has five
 of the 35 Greek members of the
 House of Representatives--be-
 cause of a pre-electoral agree-
 ment with Makarios--and controls
 the municipal governments in
 three of the five cities.
 AKEL continues to gain sup-
 port by astute exploitation of
 grievances among the Greek
 Cypriots.   The economic prob-
 lems, the existence of the two
 British bases on the island,
 and a latent neutralist senti-
 ment among the population all
 invite such exploitation.
 The Communists dominate
 the largest and most effective
 trade federation on Cyprus,
 have active youth organizations,
 and are expanding front groups
 among farmers and women.   Their
 campaign has been aided by the
 Soviet Embassy, established in
 Nicosia in December 1960, and
 by visiting Soviet cultural
 and sports groups.   A Soviet-
 Cypriot Friendship Society was
 created in March 1961.   Radio
 Moscow began daily broadcasts to
 Cyprus in Greek and Turkish in
 the spring of this year.   AKEL
 has thus far failed,  however,
 in its campaign to force Makarios
 to request Soviet economic aid.
 The Soviet Embassy has repeat-
 edly stated that such aid is
 available if requested.
 The only major non-Commu-
 nist Greek Cypriot political
 organization is the government's
 Patriotic Front, and this,  in
 essence,  is a loose coalition
 thus far dominated by Makarios.
 While the Front is not now an
 orthodox political party,  there
 have been repeated reports that
 it is to be revamped, with district
 and local organizations estab-
 lished and a program designed
 to counter some of the appeal of
 AKEL.   The non-Communist labor
 federation,  far smaller than its
 AKEL-dominated counterpart,  lacks
 the funds and leadership to suc-
 cessfully challenge its opposi-
 tion for control of organized
 labor.
 The government has indi-
 cated it may be about to move
 against the Communist threat.
 In July, Makarios warned AKEL
 against "undermining" the work
 of the government and implied
 that AKEL's Lecognition as a
 legal party, reinstated by the

 British shortly before inde-
 pendence, may again be with-
 drawn.
 Foreign Relations
 Cyprus'  relations with the
 major powers and with neighbors
 in the area are generally good.
 There has been no outstanding
 problem with Britain.   There
 gard of Turkish Cypriot views.
 A Turkish Cypriot delegation
 recently visited Israel.   Greece
 and Turkey have small military
 contingents  on the island, and
 an agreement between Athens and
 Ankara for supplying arms to
 the new Cypriot Army appears im-
 minent.
 Makarios' performance at
 the neutralist conference at
 Belgrade probably gives the
 best indication of the govern-
 ment's present foreign policy.
 He emphasized by his attendance
 that Cyprus is committed to a
 policy of nonalignment.   This
 is a policy generally approved
 by the Greek community--but not
 by the Turks.   When Kuchuk
 threatened to veto Cypriot par-
 ticipation in the conference as
 in disregard of special treaty
 obligations,  Makarios replied
 that if a policy of neutrality
 was in conflict with provisions
 of the constitution or any
 treaty,  then such provisions
 were "completely unacceptable,
 as the interests of the people
 of Cyprus are above all."  This
 dismissal of Kuchuk's threat
 did not lead to a veto, and
 Makarios went to Belgrade, but
 he was accompanied only by mem-
 bers of the Greek community,
 were occasional acts of sabotage
 against the water line to one
 of the two British bases in
 July and August;  these appear
 to have been a reaction by farm-
 ers to the goverment's failure
 to provide an adequate water sup-
 ply,  rather than a demonstration
 of antipathy toward Britain.
 Cyprus decided in March 1961 to
 remain within the Commonwealth
 for a period of five years.
 The Communists have crit-
 icized the existence of Amer-
 ican communications facilities
 on Cyprus,  the labor policy of
 the American-owned Cyprus Mines
 Corporation--largest employer
 on the island--and the "meddling"
 in domestic labor matters by
 American  personnel.   The govern-
 ment,  however,  has largely ig-
 nored the complaints and has
 maintained close relations with
 the US Embassy.
 Britain has supplied $15,-
 000,000 in grant aid during the
 first year of independence.   The
 US has sent 50,000 tons of PL-
 480 grain,  and in June 1961
 signed a technical cooperation
 agreement with Cyprus.   In Au-
 gust,  the Cypriot Government
 unveiled an ambitious five-year
 development program calling for
 the expenditure of some $173,-
 000,000.   It hopes to secure
 half of the funds from foreign
 sources. Makarios simultaneously
 announced plans to sell the
 "largest part" of the archbishop-
 ric lands to landless farmers
 and those with small holdings.
 Makarios' visit to the UAR
 in June was approved by nearly
 all members of his community,
 although the Turks were miffed
 by the obvious Egyptian disre-
 In his speech before the
 Belgrade delegates, Makarios de-
 nounced all forms of colonialism
 and called for self-determination
 for all people--including the Ger-
 mans.   His remarks on Germany and
 Berlin were closer to the West-
 ern position on these issues
 than those of any other speaker
 and were promptly criticized
 by the Communist press on Cyprus.
 Greek Cypriot leaders are aware
 of the republic's dependence on
 the West and generally support
 the Western view in most inter-
 national organizations.   They
 also recognize,  however, the
 potential value of association
 with the nonaligned states--
 particularly should the present
 settlement founder and the
 "Cyprus issue" once again be
 raised before the United Nations.
