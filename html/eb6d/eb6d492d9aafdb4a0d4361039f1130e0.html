 VIETNAM
 The Communists have continued to work hard to bol-
 ster the image of the Liberation Front as Saigon's
 equal.   For its part,    Saigon has been trying to con-
 vince world opinion that the unyielding attitude of
 the Communists is delaying progress in Paris.   Most
 ground fighting during the past week was the result
 of Communist reaction to allied military operations.

 CZECHS AND SLOVAKS FEDERALIZE DESPITE EMERGING PROBLEMS
 The federalization of Czechoslovakia, which splits
 the country into two semi-autonomous Czech and Slo-
 vak states under a streamlined central government in
 Prague, went into effect on 1 January.   Announcements
 of the formation of a new federal government, however,
 failed to mention the status of National Assembly
 President Josef Smrkovsky.
 BULGARIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZED
 Party boss Todor Zhivkov has reorganized the top
 levels of the government and has reshuffled personnel
 in a continuing effort to solve troublesome economic
 and administrative problems.
 FRENCH STUDENTS CONTINUE MILITANT LINE
 Although a measure of calm has returned to French
 universities,  the decision last week of the National
 Union of French Students to declare itself "a mass
 political movement" and to reject the government's
 educational reform program shows that student unrest
 is far from over.
 COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE AIRS DIFFERENCES
 When the Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference
 gets under way next week in London,  the British will
 find themselves in the hot seat as Afro-Asian mem-
 bers bring up such potentially explosive issues as
 Rhodesia, Nigeria,  and British policy on Commonwealth
 immigration.
 EUROPEAN SPACE PROGRAM FACES NEW CRISIS
 Britain has plunged the European Launcher Develop-
 ment Organization into a new financial impasse and
 has cast a shadow over recently announced West Euro-
 pean efforts to establish a unified space effort in
 certain fields.

 The Vietnamese Communists, during this period of impasse in Paris
 over seating and other procedural arrangements, are confining themselves
 mainly to nurturing the image of the Liberation Front as an independent
 entity and a valid spokesman for South Vietnam. They also pass up few
 opportunities to enlarge upon alleged differences between Saigon and Wash-
 ington over negotiating tactics.
 On the Saigon side, Vice President Ky's return to Paris may at least be
 delayed; there is some speculation that he may not return at all. The
 government's unity appears imperiled not only by differences over tactics to
 be pursued by South Vietnam in the Paris talks but also by strong under-
 currents of friction between Ky and Prime Minister Huong.
 Fighting in South Vietnam was light this week. The Communists
 generally observed their own three-day New Year's truce. There continue to
 be indications, however, that the enemy is getting into position for more
 intensive activity should Hanoi conclude that it would be propitious.
 In the inevitable jockeying for power in advance of the Chinese Com-
 munists' ninth party congress, radical elements in the leadership are scoring a
 few points. Harsh Maoist programs are moving into high gear in the country-
 side and may have a seriously disturbing effect. The new upheaval in some
 areas caused by this latest radical backlash may at the least force a delay in
 holding the party congress, thought to have been tentatively set for early
 spring.
 The Chinese, meanwhile, are pushing ahead with their road construc-
 tion in northwest Laos. Recent aerial photography shows that the road being
 built southward from Ban Botene is now motorable to within five miles of
 the Pathet Lao stronghold of Muong Sai. Government guerrillas in the area
 claim as many as five Chinese battalions have been brought in to provide

 VIETNAM
 Communist military activity
 this week closely followed the
 pattern of the previous week, with
 a mid-week holiday standdown that
 was called for and generally ob-
 served by the enemy.   Most ground
 fighting was the result of Com-
 munist reaction to allied mili-
 tary operations against enemy
 troop concentrations and routes
 to target areas.   Communist mor-
 tar and rocket crews continued
 their harassing attacks, especially
 in northern III Corps.
 Allied forces, which did
 not schedule a New Year's cease-
 fire, continued to disrupt enemy
 efforts to set up offensive ac-
 tions.
 Communist Political Developments
 The Communists have contin-
 ued to work hard to bolster the
 image of the Liberation Front as
 Saigon's equal.   While the allied
 delegations consulted with their
 governments and with each other
 during the past week,  the Com-
 munists in one forum after another
 castigated Saigon for obstruct-
 ing the talks,   The Communists
 renewed the call for a replace-
 ment of the Thieu government with
 a "peace cabinet" that would sit
 down and negotiate with the Com-
 munists in Paris.   Hanoi openly
 warned the US in one broadcast
 that even if the procedural has-
 sle were resolved, there was
 little prospect of progress on
 substantive issues as long as
 Saigon clung to its present "at-
 titudes."
 Using every opportunity to
 contrast Saigon's alleged in-
 transigence with their own "good
 intentions," the Hanoi - Libera-
 tion Front delegation in Paris
 issued a joint communique on De-
 cember 26 claiming that a round
 table was a real and probably
 final compromise on the part of
 the Communists on seating ar-
 rangements.   They hinted broadly,
 however,  that if the allies ac-
 cepted it, the Communists were
 prepared to be flexible on other
 procedural problems.
 Throughout the week, the ef-
 forts to tear down Saigon's repu-
 tation and to feed its suspicions
 of Washington's intentions were
 coupled with maneuvers designed
 to strengthen the position of the
 Liberation Front.   The Communists
 pressed for additional meetings
 between Front and US representa-
 tives on the prisoner issue, and
 gave extensive publicity to the
 reception of the head of the Front
 delegation in Paris at the French
 Foreign Ministry.   The Front also
 talked up their local revolution-
 ary committees as an effective
 challenge to Saigon's authority
 in the countryside.   In a series
 of interviews granted this week,
 the head of the Front delegation
 implied that these local Communist
 administrative authorities blan-
 keted practically all of South
 Vietnam, and predicted that the

 Front would set up a national
 government to rival Saigon.   He
 was purposefully vague as to the
 timing of such a move, however.
 Political Developments in
 South Vietnam
 Following the return of Vice
 President Ky to Saigon for con-
 sultations,  the South Vietnamese
 have begun a propaganda campaign
 to convince world opinion that it
 is the unyielding attitude of
 the Communists that is delaying
 progress in Paris.   Government
 spokesmen are emphasizing that
 South Vietnam has already made
 many concessions, including agree-
 ing to a round table,  "provided
 the character of a two-sided ne-
 gotiation is reflected physically."
 In what appears to be a
 further effort to reduce impa-
 tience  in the US,  President Thieu
 has publicly announced that he
 believes some US troop withdrawals
 will be possible in 1969 in view
 of improving South Vietnamese
 military capabilities. His con-
 fidence in his country's growing
 self-reliance is reminiscent of
 SECRET
 the attitude that prevailed be-
 fore the Tet offensive last
 February, however, and would
 probably be severely weakened by
 a major new Communist offensive.
 Meanwhile, the delegation's
 morale is undoubtedly low as a
 result of the pressures it has
 encountered in Paris and a lack
 of support from the home front.
 The dismissal of 12 staff mem-
 bers of the delegation from their
 regular Saigon jobs is virtually
 certain to be interpreted as a
 slap at Ky and his friends, and
 will weaken the delegation's
 prestige in Saigon.
 Ky has let it be known that
 he is considering not returning
 to Paris, probably in the hope
 of getting assurances from both
 Thieu and the US that his services
 are valued.   There is little in-
 dication that he has made any
 progress in returning some of
 his supporters to key positions
 in the regime or has otherwise
 made any political capital, as
 he hoped he would when he agreed
 to go to Paris.

 INDONESIA PREPARES FOR WEST IRIAN VOTE
 Indonesia is trying to elim-
 inate dissident groups in West
 Irian in order to ensure an
 orderly vote favorable to Djakarta
 in this year's "self-determina-
 tion" election.
 Indonesia is required to
 let the West Irianese determine
 their future status, either
 independence or union with Indo-
 nesia, before the end of this
 year under terms of the 1962
 "New York Agreement."   This
 agreement ended the dispute be-
 tween Indonesia and the Nether-
 lands over the former Dutch ter-
 ritory of New Guinea and trans-
 ferred its administration to
 Indonesia.   Since its administra-
 tion began in May 1963, Djakarta
 has encountered consistent local
 agitation against union with
 Indonesia.   This resistance has
 been increased by the central
 government's neglect of the area
 and exploitation by local Indo-
 nesian administrators.
 The anti-Indonesian move-
 ment includes a poorly armed but
 persistent guerrilla organization
 of some 2,500 men, which the
 Indonesians have been unable to
 flush out of the jungle.   The
 Djakarta government now believes,
 however, that it is making progress
 through amnesty offers and nego-
 tiations.   One of West Irian's
 three major rebel leaders, along
 with approximately 700 of his
 followers, surrendered in early
 December after a government-
 offered amnesty.   A second leader
 has sent representatives to
 Djakarta to discuss possible
 surrender terms.
 In parallel moves to improve
 its image, Djakarta has begun
 introducing more consumer goods
 into West Irian and upgrading
 the caliber of its military and
 administrative personnel.   Djakar-
 ta's resources are limited, however,
 and administering the territory
 places added pressures on the
 government's already strained
 finances.
 The opposition, expecting a
 rigged vote, is apparently now
 trying to get on record as ob-
 jecting to the manner in which
 Indonesia plans to conduct the
 self-determination election.   The
 Indonesians intend to have the
 votes cast by hand-picked dis-
 trict representatives and tra-
 ditional tribal chiefs who can
 be made to see the practicality
 of voting to remain with Indonesia.
 A United Nations represent-
 ative,   who will participate in
 establishing procedures for the
 voting, is apparently sympathetic
 to Indonesia's objectives.   He
 desires, however, that the
 voting be carried out in a manner
 that will not invite suspicion
 of undue manipulation.   Presumably,
 Indonesia will delay the voting
 until near the end of 1969.

 RADICAL FORCES IN CHINA SHOW NEW STRENGTH
 Since the October plenum of
 the Chinese Communist Party, radi-
 cal elements in the leadership
 apparently have been able to
 seize the initiative on some is-
 sues.   Extreme social programs
 advocated by Mao Tse-tung have
 been intensified, despite the
 social and political unrest they
 create.   It is possible that the
 regime will postpone again the
 overdue party congress, which has
 been tentatively set for early
 spring.   A People's Daily edi-
 torial on 31 December confirmed
 that the congress would be held
 in 1969, but did not specify a
 date.
 In the jockeying for power
 almost certainly going on in ad-
 vance of this congress, the radi-
 cals have scored a few points.
 Radiobroadcasts   from two prov-
 inces claim that some provincial
 leaders opposed by the radical
 Cultural Revolution Group in
 Peking were recently "exposed."
 Although nobody was named, one
 man is almost certainly Wang En-
 mao, long-time military and party
 leader in Sinkiang.   During the
 Cultural Revolution, radical forces
 have made repeated attempts to
 dislodge Wang, but have had no
 apparent success.
 Meanwhile, harsh Maoist pro-
 grams are moving into high gear in
 rural areas and may have a seri-
 ously  disturbing effect.   A re-
 cent directive by Mao to push the
 Cultural Revolution in the coun-
 tryside this coming winter and
 spring is being interpreted in
 at least one province as a demand
 to launch a large-scale purge of
 "class enemies."  A Shensi broad-
 cast of 25 December said that in
 response to Mao's demand, the
 military planned to send squads
 of troops to all villages to help
 "clean out" the large number of
 spies, traitors, landlords, and
 other "bad elements" who allegedly
 still exist.   A similar campaign
 conducted recently in Kwangtung
 resulted in thousands of execu-
 tions, often after public tor-
 tures.
 The transfer of urban dwell-
 ers to the countryside--begun on
 a large scale last fall, partly to
 satisfy Mao's long-standing con-
 viction that heavy physical labor
 is good ideological training for
 everyone--was given another spur
 on 21 December with the publica-
 tion of a new Mao "instruction"
 on the subject.   According to
 provincial broadcasts, entire
 families will now be resettled,
 not just high-school-age youth
 and cadres, the previous targets
 of the campaign.   Some reports
 suggest that as much as one fourth
 of the population of large cities
 will be dispersed.   This forced
 emigration has added to the army's
 burden of maintaining public or-
 der in rural areas, because it
 is deeply resented by both the
 emigrants and their unwilling
 hosts in already overpopulated
 communes.   In some communes near
 Canton, troops are being perma-
 nently assigned to keep people

 the area's problems. There have been some signs of flexibility in Moscow's
 position, although it conforms closely with the aims of the Arab nations and
 probably has Cairo's approval. The USSR has avoided the excessive harshness
 that would damage its diplomatic efforts, however, and appears genuinely
 interested in working with the Western powers to patch together the ele-
 ments of a political settlement.
 Federalization came quietly to Czechoslovakia this week. Some new
 faces showed up among the leadership, but there were no real surprises. The
 leaders skirted the issue of the future of progressive assembly president
 Smrkovsky, whose fate will be decided later this month. The visit by a Soviet
 party delegation to Czechoslovakia this week seemed aimed at strengthening
 conservative elements at lower levels in the Czechoslovak party-a technique
 the Soviets have increasingly used to influence top-level policy and appoint-
 ments in Prague.
 Political differences between the Russians and Yugoslavs over the
 invasion of Czechoslovakia have not unduly affected their bilateral economic
 relations. The two countries have just signed their annual trade protocol, and
 it provides for an optimistic increase in trade above that of 1968.

 SOVIETS WARM UP TO BONN AND THE WEST
 Moscow is taking a somewhat
 more amiable line toward Bonn as
 it works to undo the damage done
 by the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
 Fence-mending apart, in its cur-
 rent diplomacy toward the West,
 Moscow also has one eye on the
 new US administration,  and would
 prefer to be as free as possible
 of accumulated diplomatic bur-
 dens.   Not far below the surface,
 too,  is Soviet fear of China's
 troublemaking capability, which
 encourages Moscow to damp down
 tension on its Western flank.
 Moscow has muted its anti-US
 propaganda in general,  and has
 carefully avoided criticism of
 the President-elect.   The Soviets
 have stressed restoration of
 their rapport with France.   They
 have also made protestations of
 goodwill to the Italians, the
 Dutch,  and the Belgians, and have
 cozied up quietly to the European
 Community.   Soviet propaganda
 continues to bully the UK, how-
 ever, probably because of the
 relatively low premium on good
 Anglo-Soviet relations in the
 short run.
 In what amounts to a tacti-
 cal about-face,  after months of
 hurling abuse at Bonn after
 Czechoslovakia, the Soviets have
 moved to resume negotiations of
 a civil air agreement with West
 Germany.   They have also inti-
 mated that they are ready to re-
 sume talks on exchanging declara-
 tions renouncing the use of force.
 Alternate use of the carrot
 and the stick is a well-established
 feature of Soviet dealings with the
 West Germans,  and the current ver-
 sion is likely to be no more than
 another tactical maneuver designed
 to play on differences within the
 Western alliance.   The USSR is
 well aware that Bonn fears the
 prospect of far-reaching talks be-
 tween Moscow and the new US admin-
 istration.   The Soviets also sense
 Bonn's keen interest in salvaging
 something of the Eastern diplomacy
 it had been pursuing before Chech-
 oslovakia.
 The Russians have sweetened
 their civil air proposal by offer-
 ing Bonn coveted onward flight
 rights from Moscow to points in
 the Far East.   The USSR will be
 less responsive to West Germany's
 request for membership in an ex-
 panded Geneva disarmament confer-
 ence,  however.   The Russians, cer-
 tain to set a high price even to
 admit Bonn as an observer,  are
 likely to demand West German rat-
 ification of the nonproliferation
 treaty and equal status at Geneva
 for East Germany.
 Bonn's designation of West
 Berlin as the site for election of
 the federal president in March is
 likely to put the current trend
 in Soviet - West German relations
 to an early test.   Bonn's move im-
 plies difficulties with the So-
 viets and East Germans, who have
 warned against such "provocations."
 The first Soviet reaction,  in the
 form of an oral protest to Allied
 ambassadors in Moscow, seems to      25X1
 have been essentially for the rec-
 ord, however, and in the nature of
 an appeal to desist.

 CZECHS AND SLOVAKS FEDERALIZE DESPITE EMERGING PROBLEMS
 The federalization of Czech-
 oslovakia, which splits the coun-
 try into two semiautonomous Czech
 and Slovak states under a stream-
 lined central government in Prague,
 went into effect on 1 January.
 Announcements of the formation
 of a new federal government, how-
 ever, failed to mention the status
 of National Assembly President
 Josef Smrkovsky.   The issue of
 his continuing in his position
 has generated considerable fric-
 tion between the Czechs and Slo-
 vaks, and it probably will not
 be settled until a new federal
 assembly is formed later this
 month.
 Both the new federal govern-
 ment and the Slovak national gov-
 ernment have brought in young,
 competent officials, but the new
 personnel assignments contain no
 surprises.   Only two of the seven
 heads of federal ministries are
 new appointees.   Jan Marko,  a
 Slovak technologist, was named
 minister of foreign affairs--
 though he has no experience in
 this area--while Jan Tabacek,  a
 Slovak economist-technologist,
 was designated minister of for-
 eign trade.   Marko is said to be
 a "compromise" candidate who was
 selected over a pro-Soviet hard
 liner nominated by conservative
 leader Vasil Bilak.
 The status of Smrkovsky has
 become a cause celebre.   Many
 Slovak organizations have backed
 Slovak party boss Husak's demand
 that a Slovak fill one of the top
 three positions in the federal
 government.   Inasmuch as Presi-
 dent Svoboda and Premier Cernik
 have already been confirmed in
 their posts, the Slovaks are in
 effect calling for Smrkovsky's
 ouster.
 Students, workers,  farmers,  an
 intellectuals have threatened to
 demonstrate en masse if any of
 the liberals in the leadership--
 particuarly Smrkovsky--are dropped,
 or if Dubcek's reform program is
 further compromised.
 Another ranking Soviet party
 delegation arrived in Prague on
 26 December as part of a con-
 tinuing Russian effort to keep
 in close touch with Czechoslovak
 officials during the period of
 "normalization."   The eight-mem-
 ber Soviet delegation, heavily
 weighted with party professionals,
 was headed by Konstantin Katushev,
 central committee secretary for
 relations with other Communist
 parties.   It also included first
 deputy foreign minister Vasily
 Kuznetsov, who served as Mos-
 cow's troubleshooter in Prague
 after the invasion.   The delega-
 tion has met mostly with Czech-
 oslovak conservatives, and one
 of the aims of the visit is no
 doubt to strengthen these con-
 servative forces in the Czecho-
 slovak party.

 BULGARIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZED
 Party boss Todor Zhivkov
 has reorganized top levels of
 the government and reshuffled
 personnel in a continuing effort
 to solve troublesome economic
 and administrative problems.
 The changes signify a recentrali-
 zation of authority and a tight-
 ening of party control, in con-
 trast to the cautious attempt
 in recent years to induce flexi-
 bility into the decision-making
 process.
 Zhivkov's proposals were
 approved, apparently without op-
 position, at a party plenum on
 26 December, and were ratified
 the next day by the National
 Assembly.   Most of the changes,
 which touch nearly all the higher
 levels of the party, government,
 and even mass organizations,
 carry forward the directives of
 the plenum held last July.  As
 envisaged then, Zhivkov's plan
 streamlines the functioning of
 the cabinet and consolidates
 various departments in the par-
 ty's administrative apparatus.
 Although the number of gov-
 ernment ministries remains the
 same, the decision-making power
 has been compressed into fewer
 hands.   Four of Zhivkov's deputy
 premiers were given ministerial
 portfolios.   There were only two
 important, clear-cut demotions.
 The minister of foreign trade was
 replaced, probably because of the
 unsolved balance of payments
 problem.   The minister of in-
 ternal affairs fell victim to
 the government's desire to bring
 more effective leadership into
 security affairs.
 The party tightened its
 control over the economy, never
 significantly loosened, by con-
 solidating economic-oriented
 ministries and creating a new
 Economic Coordination Committee.
 Zhivkov has appointed his first
 deputy for government affairs,
 Zhivko Zhivkov, to head the new
 committee and has given it a
 wide latitude of responsibility
 and power.   The committee will
 be expected to solve the economic
 problems that have resulted from
 rapid but unbalanced growth and
 from overextension in Western
 credits.   Other administrative
 changes point up Sofia's desire
 to de-emphasize its highly prop-
 agandized economic reform pro-
 gram, which was never actually
 implemented.
 Moscow's harsh repression
 of the Czechoslovak experiment
 has not been lost on the Bul-
 garian leadership, and Sofia is
 apparently trying to form even
 closer ties with the USSR.
 Zhivkov probably coordinated
 his package plan with the Soviet
 leadership when he and two of
 his important deputies recently
 flew to Moscow for high-level
 consultations.   Sofia is looking
 to Moscow for timely aid in
 coping with its serious economic
 and financial difficulties, and
 in return is giving unquestioning
 support to Moscow's international
 policies.                                 25X1

 FRENCH STUDENTS CONTINUE MILITANT LINE
 A measure of calm has returned
 to French universities following
 a number of serious incidents in
 December, but the student commu-
 nity remains in a volatile state.
 Moreover, actions taken recently
 by the major student union, the
 National Union of French Students
 (UNEF),  suggest that students may
 take an even more militant atti-
 tude as the school year progresses.
 The UNEF has been in the forefront
 of the student movement in recent
 months, particularly after the ban
 on extremist organizations reduced
 the activity of other groups.
 At its three-day national con-
 gress in late December,  the UNEF
 decided to go beyond the role of
 defender of purely student inter-
 ests and, despite opposition from
 Communist and moderate elements,
 plunged into the field of politics.
 The congress approved a statement
 describing the UNEF as a "mass po-
 litical movement," and adopted a
 platform calling for defense of
 political liberties within the
 universities, rejection of the
 government's program for educa-
 tional reform,  and concerted ac-
 tion with the workers.   This openly
 political posture is certain to
 arouse the ire of many in the gov-
 ernment,  and especially in the par-
 liament, who strongly opposed even
 the limited amount of political
 freedom granted students in the
 education bill.
 The UNEF's re-election of
 Jacques Sauvageot as its president
 also points to the possibility of
 greater militancy in the universi-
 ties.   Sauvageot, a key leader in
 the student revolt last May, had
 stated prior to his election that
 the students are "preparing for
 the overthrow of the regime."   The
 UNEF platform's call for concerted
 action with the workers is also
 supported by Sauvageot, who fears
 that otherwise students will be
 isolated.   Workers and their union
 leaders remain wary of any close
 association with the students,  how-
 ever, and will. probably try--as
 they have successfully in the
 past--to keep the protests and de-
 mands of the two groups separate.
 The deep divisions that still
 exist among students may impair
 their ability to mount an effec-
 tive protest against the govern-
 ment.   At the congress,  Sauvageot
 failed in his effort to integrate
 into the UNEF representatives from
 the extremist "action committees"
 that emerged during the May crisis.
 The committees, unable to unseat
 Sauvageot, withdrew from the con-
 gress and stated their intention
 to hold an assembly of their own
 this month.
 Moderate and Communist stu-
 dents were also dissatisfied, not
 only with the political line
 adopted by the congress but also
 with what they believed was unfair
 treatment meted out by the major-
 ity.   The short shrift given the
 orthodox Union of Communist Stu-
 dents by the UNEF congress reflects

 the hostility that has long marked
 relations between the Communist
 Party and French students, who see
 the party as part of the "estab-
 lishment."   The French Communist
 daily, L'Humanite, has already
 protested the political role
 chosen by the congress,  asserting
 that UNEF action as a "political
 striking force" would be directed
 against the organized workers'
 COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE AIRS DIFFERENCES
 The conference of prime minis-
 ters of the Commonwealth countries
 in London from 7 to 15 January will
 again reveal wide differences on
 international questions, and will
 also produce a barrage of criticism
 of British policies.
 The atmosphere of the confer-
 ences, held about every two years
 in London, has become increasingly
 tense over the last decade as newly
 independent Afro-Asian countries
 join the Commonwealth and use the
 meetings as a forum to air their
 grievances.   The disparity of in-
 terests between such countries as,
 for instance, Australia and Swazi-
 land, not to mention the bitter
 disp-itos between member states--
 notably India and Pakistan--has
 raised questions about the viabil-
 ity of the Commonwealth.   This
 year's divisive issues include Rhode-
 sia, Nigeria, and Britain's immigra-
 tion policy.
 Much to London's dislike, Rho-
 desia will again be a main topic of
 discussion.   The last conference in
 September 1966 was devoted princi-
 pally to this subject,  and a threat
 of the African members to leave the
 organization was barely averted.
 This year the Africans will prob-
 ably charge that Prime Minister
 Wilson broke his pledge of "no inde-
 pendence before majority rule" by
 the offers he recently made to Ian
 Smith.   Wilson may attempt to con-
 vert the Africans to a more "real-
 istic" approach, but he will have
 rough going.
 Britain and Nigeria will prob-
 ably try to keep the Nigerian
 civil war off the main agenda,  al-
 though Tanzania and Zambia can be
 expected to lobby on behalf of the
 Biafrans.   The pro-Biafrans will
 assail the British policy of sup-
 plying arms to the federal side,
 and there may be some attempt to
 pass a resolution calling for an
 international arms embargo.   Partly
 in anticipation of the Commonwealth
 meeting,  the British launched their
 much-publicized peace initiative of
 last month.   They will probably
 stress their numerous attempts to
 find a solution to both the politi-
 cal and humane aspects of the con-
 flict.
 Indira Gandhi intends to
 criticize recent British restric-
 tions on Commonwealth immigration
 into the UK.   In conjunction with
 some    Caribbean  members,  India is
 expected to suggest the establish-
 ment of a special bureau in the
 Commonwealth secretariat that would
 be responsible for immigration
 problems and questions of race re-
 lations.   The British,  as well as
 the Australians and others, prob-
 ably oppose this plan and will
 argue that it would infringe on
 national sovereignty.1

 EUROPEAN SPACE PROGRAM FACES NEW CRISIS
 Britain has plunged the
 European Launcher Development
 Organization  (ELDO)  into a new
 financial impasse and has cast
 a shadow over recently announced
 West European efforts to estab-
 lish a unified space effort in
 the fields of launchers as well
 as applications and scientific
 satellites.
 At a meeting of ELDO's
 council on 19-20 December, the
 British agreed to pay their $23-
 million contribution to the 1969
 budget only if they were relieved
 of any future obligation.   Lon-
 don's 1970 share of the contem-
 plated $626-million total costs
 of the present ELDO program--
 aimed at development of the
 Europa II rocket--would have
 been $17 million.   Long opposed
 to European "duplication" of
 American capabilities in the
 launcher field, the UK had al-
 ready made known its intention
 to withdraw from ELDO in 1971.
 As a result of the British
 stand at the ELDO council meet-
 ing, France and Belgium refused
 to vote at all on the proposed
 1969 budget.   Moreover, the Ital-
 ians reiterated that they might
 not pay their contribution for
 1967 and 1968--already in arrears
 --nor that due for 1969.   At
 European space meetings at Bonn
 in November, Rome had provision-
 ally agreed to a compromise
 whereby it would accept a reduced
 ELDO budget--which cut projects
 in which Italy would have had a
 role.   In return,  the French and
 Germans had agreed to purchase
 from the Italians--outside the
 scope of the ELDO program--a
 crucial booster motor for the
 French-German Symphonic communi-
 cations satellite project.   Bonn
 and Paris will now presumably
 have to take over development
 of this so-called apogee-perigee
 motor.
 It is not clear what action
 Britain's ELDO partners may take
 if they are unable to persuade
 London to reconsider its posi-
 tion.   At the least, France may
 find it a heavy burden--in its
 present economic difficulties--
 to assume a portion of the
 British default.   At the Bonn
 meetings, the UK had agreed to
 continue to furnish its Blue
 Streak rocket--the first stage
 of the Europa II--even after
 1971.   Presumably, this commit-
 ment remains firm, but the UK's
 withdrawal from financing of the
 last phase of the present pro-
 gram will probably further de-
 lay ELDO's hope of having Europa
 II ready in time for a 1971
 launching of the Symphonie.
 ELDO ministers may meet in
 February to attempt to find a
 long-term solution to the new
 impasse.   In the meantime, ELDO
 will finance its operations on
 a month-to-month basis, with pay-
 ments not to exceed last year's
 level .

 Arab-Israeli incidents continued at a high rate last week, highlighted by
 the Israeli attack on Beirut airport, which earned the Israelis a unanimous
 vote of condemnation by the UN Security Council. The raid has put
 Lebanon's fragile internal political balance in danger, and all security forces
 have been placed under army command to enforce a ban on demonstrations.
 There is some feeling that the government may have to change its generally
 pro-Western policies in order to hold the country together. The Soviet Union
 has already offered immediate military and economic aid to the Lebanese.
 Arab terrorist organizations seem bent on provoking more incidents from
 Lebanese territory, raising the prospect of further Israeli retaliation.
 Trade accords signed on 28 December may increase Algeria's long-range
 economic dependence on the USSR. The Soviets agreed to purchase im-
 portant quantities of wine and petroleum, and no longer will require annual
 balancing of trade between the two countries. Thus, the way may be open
 for an influx of Soviet goods not matched, in the short range at least, by
 Algerian exports.
 Political unrest in Pakistan continued to be reflected in strikes, demon-
 strations, and protest marches as the new year opened. An aide to former
 foreign minister Bhutto has announced that Bhutto will oppose Ayub for the
 presidency in the 1969-70 elections. The announcement was probably de-
 signed to steal the initiative from other opposition leaders now meeting in
 Dacca in an effort to come up with a unified campaign strategy.
 In Nigeria, frustration over the continuation of the stalemate in the civil
 war is growing as serious antitax rioting persists in the Western State.
 Throughout Nigeria the prolongation of the war is being attributed increas-
 ingly to Western support for Biafra, and there is growing criticism of the US
 decision to provide transport aircraft to relief agencies active in Biafra.

 BEIRUT RAID HEIGHTENS MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS
 The recent raid by Israeli
 commandos on Beirut airport
 appears to have aroused almost
 universal condemnation of Israel,
 while knitting Arab resistance
 more tightly together.
 On 28 December,  Israeli com-
 mandos attacked Beirut civil air-
 port by helicopter and destroyed
 13 civilian aircraft on the
 ground.   There was virtually no
 Lebanese armed resistance, and
 the only casualties appear to
 have been Israelis.   Damage now
 appears to be considerably less
 than the initial estimate of
 $43.8 million,  and was largely
 covered by insurance.   The an-
 nounced intention of the raid was
 to retaliate against Lebanon,
 which Israel claims connived in
 the Arab fedayeen attack on the
 El Al airliner in Athens airport
 earlier last week.
 Both Lebanon and Israel took
 the matter to the UN Security
 Council, where, as expected,
 Israel was condemned unanimously.
 Most nations are appalled at the
 risks taken by Israel in attack-
 ing an international airport
 and deplore the extension of the
 Arab-Israeli conflict to inter-
 national air traffic.
 Beyond initial shock at the
 type and extent of Israeli retali-
 ation, responsible world leaders
 generally believed that the "law
 of retaliation" adopted by Israel
 would not only be counterproduc-
 tive in damping down Arab terrorism
 but would serve to heighten Arab
 zeal.   It is the stated objective
 of Arab resistance groups to draw
 reluctant or moderate Arabs into
 an active role in the struggle
 for Palestine.   By punishing
 Beirut for the Athens incident,
 Israel may have greatly assisted
 the terrorists in forcing the
 reluctant Lebanese Government
 to join activist Arab nations.
 Even the Israeli press has
 shown mixed feelings in dealing
 with the raid.   Although news-
 papers of all political hues
 rationalize about the effective-
 ness and efficiency of the epi-
 sode,  there appears to be an
 underlying mood of pessimism
 about the present system of fight-
 ing terror with greater terror.
 The Arab reaction has been
 predictable.   The ineptness of
 the Lebanese defense has embit-
 tered the people and weakened
 still another moderate Arab
 regime.   At the same time, the
 Lebanese now see the struggle
 with Israel from a more personal
 and committed point of view.
 The fedayeen smell success in the
 spate of publicity and have vowed
 a "rain" of revenge raids against
 Israel.   Arab leaders have sensed
 that the public mood has quick-
 ened in response to the harden-
 ing of Israeli policy.   King
 Husayn has once more called for
 an Arab summit meeting to assess
 the new danger of escalating ten-
 sions and to try to create more

 WAR-WEARINESS GROWS IN NIGERIA
 War-weariness and frustra-
 tion over the continuing military
 stalemate are growing in Nigeria,
 where federal authorities are
 becoming increasingly suspicious
 of US intentions.   The Biafrans,
 who almost certainly see these
 developments as justification of
 their defense strategy, appear
 determined to hold out.
 In the Western state,   spo-
 radic rioting over taxes persists,
 and there is increasing evidence
 among the Yoruba tribesmen of gen-
 eral disaffection with the state
 government, extending in some cases
 to the federal level.   This malaise
 appears rooted in economic discon-
 tent, but includes a growing dis-
 satisfaction with corruption
 among state officials and with
 the failure of the federal author-
 ities to end the war.   There are
 indications that such agitation
 will continue in the West and may
 spread to Yoruba elements in the
 Lagos state.
 Frustration over the stale-
 mate is becoming evident in north-
 ern Nigeria, where the federal
 authorities'  inability to win
 is being attributed increasingly
 to Western, and particularly US,
 support for Biafra.   Press re-
 ports about US intentions to in-
 crease relief aid to the Biafrans
 were interpreted in the north as
 "aid and comfort to the enemy,"
 and the recent US provision of
 airplanes to relief agencies
 flying to Biafra will almost
 certainly provoke a strong ad-
 verse reaction.
 In Lagos,  federal leader
 Gowon told the US ambassador that
 providing relief planes could
 have very serious consequences
 for US-Nigerian relations and re-
 quested further clarification
 of the US move.   Gowon indicated
 his belief that this action gave
 more evidence of a US shift to
 a position of support for Biafra,
 and made public a strongly worded
 communique that could well spark
 anti-US demonstrations.
 The Biafrans, who believe
 that if they hold out long enough
 the Lagos regime will fall apart,
 are now attempting to bolster
 their military position to stave
 off an expected major federal
 offensive.

 PAKISTANI OPPOSITION LEADERS MEET TO PLAN STRATEGY
 A three-day strategy meet-
 ing of opposition leaders, sched-
 uled to begin on 3 January in
 East Pakistan, may provide some
 measure of the disparate anti-
 government forces' ability to
 work together.
 Leading government critic
 Asghar Khan plans to attend the
 meeting, which will reportedly
 include most other major opposi-
 tion leaders, both independent
 and party-affiliated.   If the
 group decides to contest the
 1969-70 elections and back a
 single candidate, Asghar may be
 hoping that his enthusiastic
 support in West Pakistan, his
 recent warm reception in East
 Pakistan, and his reputation for
 honesty and integrity will make
 him the most acceptable man to
 oppose President Ayub Khan.
 Several other opposition
 leaders have personal ambitions,
 however, and are probably also
 hoping for the bid.   The acting
 chairman of ex-foreign minister
 Bhutto's People's Party announced
 Saturday that Bhutto--in jail
 since 13 November for inciting
 violence--will oppose Ayub for
 the presidency in 1970.   Bhutto
 will not be able to attend the
 3 January meeting, but his
 supporters probably hope that
 the announcement of his candidacy
 will steal the initiative from
 Asghar and other contenders.
 Initial reaction from within anti-
 government ranks to Bhutto's pro-
 spective candidacy, however, has
 been largely negative.
 of brutality.
 Various antigovernment
 groups continue to organize dis-
 turbances throughout the country.
 A highly effective general strike
 and a sizable, student-led pro-
 test march in Rawalpindi on 25
 December resulted in violence
 and at least two reported deaths.
 Border militia were called in the
 following day to help the police
 maintain order.   Rawalpindi
 students are reportedly planning
 further demonstrations to protest
 alleged police atrocities.   In
 East Pakistan, pro-Peking leftists
 staged a rural strike on 29 Decem-
 ber that apparently was effec-
 tive only in scattered areas,
 largely at the periphery of the
 province.   Several deaths were
 reported in Dacca, however.   In
 responding to the continuing un-
 rest in the country, the police--
 at times reinforced by the mili-
 tary--have been moving in to re-
 store order but acting with re-
 straint, apparently on orders
 from Ayub to avoid unnecessary
 violence, bloodshed, and charges

 Brazil's National Security Council announced on 30 December that
 thirteen politicians, including opposition leader Carlos Lacerda, have been
 stripped of their political rights. Ten of the thirteen were federal deputies
 from the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement, one was a deputy from
 the progovernment party, and one was a federal judge.
 Panama's military junta                                       pre-
 fers a "nonpartisan" presidential election in 1970 that would be outside the
 traditional political party system. The members of the 3-man Electoral
 Tribunal have been charged with revising the electoral code and are studying
 a plan that calls for a "popular consultation" that would select a president
 from several candidates hand-picked by the junta. Elections for a new
 National Assembly may be as far off as 1976.
 President Balaguer of the Dominican Republic has dissolved his palace
 intelligence service and has given its chief, Colonal Tejeda Alvarez, an
 ambassadorial post. Tejeda's close ties with the ambitious commander of the
 important First Brigade, Colonel Nivar Seijas, raise speculation that Balaguer
 believes it a convenient time to weaken Nivar's influence by removing one of
 his strongest allies.
 Efforts to achieve a reconciliation between the secessionist Caribbean
 island of Anguilla and the Associated State of St. Kitts from which it
 withdrew have failed. Consequently, Anguilla council leader Robert Webster
 plans to declare total independence on 8 January. The main problem for the
 present moderate leaders of the small island would be that of finding a way
 to survive without substantial outside assistance.
 Peru's military government appears to be actively seeking Latin Ameri-
 can backing for its position on the International Petroleum Company (IPC)
 issue. The Peruvians hope to put pressure on the US to refrain from using
 economic sanctions against Peru, which has expropriated IPC property, but
 without compensation so far.
 The Argentine Government has ended the 21-month-old wage freeze and
 has authorized an eight percent across-the-board salary hike. Other increases
 in the minimum wage and family allowances will probably raise average
 income per wage earner by 11 percent.

 HAITIAN PRESIDENT PREOCCUPIED WITH INTERNAL PROBLEMS
 President Duvalier has in-
 stituted additional security
 measures throughout Haiti in an
 effort to cope with recurrent
 terrorist activities, according
 to the US Embassy.
 During the past two weeks,
 hit-and-run terrorist attacks
 were made on US installations
 for the first time.   In mid-
 December,  two bombing attempts
 were made against the US-
 Haitian binational center in
 Port au Prince.   One of the
 bombs caused minor damage, but
 the other was found before it
 could be set off.   In addition,
 fire destroyed the headquarters
 of the US-financed malaria eradi-
 cation program.   A small group
 of Communist activists may be
 responsible for the recent sabo-
 tage, but the possibility that
 some other groups were involved
 cannot be ruled out.   Last July
 and August, Communist activists
 were blamed for a spate of ter-
 rorist incidents.
 President Duvalier is also
 making changes in his immediate
 circle of advisers that are
 causing some political tension.
 He apparently is attempting to
 patch up a family feud with his
 eldest daughter, Marie Denise,
 and her husband, Colonel Max
 Dominique, who were exiled to
 Europe in June 1967.   In August
 1968, Duvalier granted amnesty
 to Dominique and his family, and
 last month, Marie Denise returned
 to Haiti.   She was subsequently
 appointed to an important palace
 position, replacing one of the
 President's close confidants.
 In a recent interview, Marie
 Denise said that her husband
 will join her within the next
 two weeks.
 The strong rivalries
 among members of the palace en-
 tourage apparently are now be-
 coming increasingly bitter as a
 result.
 The terrorism and palace
 intrigue are not likely to alter
 Duvalier's personal power posi-
 tion, but they will have an un-
 settling effect on over-all
 political conditions.                   25X1
