 Chinese Expectations for the Zhao Visit
 Summary
 The Chinese leadership wants a successful  Zhao visit  to
 highlight recent  gains in Sino-US relations,  bolster China's
 prestige,  and enhance Beijing's position in  the Sino-US-USSR
 strategic triangle.   Zhao probably also hopes  to facilitate-
 broader?Sino-US economic ties--especially greater access to
 American technology--both  to underscore China's continued
 commitment  to its open door policy and to demonstrate the'
 benefits of that policy.   Zhao is likely to stress publicly
 China's adherence to an "independent foreign policy"  and
 privately restate--in non-polemical  terms--Chinese concerns over
 the  Taiwan Relations Act and  US  arms  sales  to Taiwan.   But  we
 expect him to place greater emphasis in private on common
 strategic and economic interests in the hope of laying the
 foundations for a smoother relationship with the Reagan
 administration,  which Beijing probably expects  to win another
 four-year term.
 Importance of Symbolism
 Beijing may attach more importance to the symbolism than the
 substance of the Zhao visit.   It will be the first by a senior
 Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping came to Washington in 1979 and
 the first ever by a Chinese premier.   Beijing probably regards
 the timing of the visit as also important in underscoring how
 much the relationship has improved since last spring.
 This memorandum was prepared by the China Division of the
 Office of East Asian Analysis as background for the visit of PRC
 Premier Zhao Ziyang to the United States.   Questions and comments
 on  the memorandum are welcome and may be directed to the Chief,

 Zhao almost certainly hopes to develop a better personal
 relationship with the President both to counteract Taiwanese
 influence and erase any residual strain left over from their
 first brief meeting at Cancun in 1981.   Zhao is likely,
 therefore, to stress common interests--especially in countering
 Soviet expansionism and promoting stability in East Asia.   In
 doing so he presumably will raise or be prepared to discuss
 recent North Korean overtures for talks.   He probably hopes the
 US in turn will acknowledge in public the importance of China's
 contribution to stability in Northeast Asia.
 Zhao will raise Taiwan as every Chinese leader has with
 senior US officials visiting China over the past year.   Recently
 the Chinese have taken the line that continued US support for
 Taiwan, especially arms sales, encourages Taiwan-to ignore
 Beijing's overtures for talks and thus undercuts China's policy
 of pursuing peaceful reunification.  The Chinese may believe
 that, with, a US President coming to China in an election year,
 they have greater leverage. on this question now than later.   If
 so, they may probe US willingness to play a more active role in
 helping to bring about a Beijing-Taipei dialogue.
 At a minimum, Chinese-leaders seem determined to drive home
 the message that mishandling this issue endangers Sino-US
 relations.  Their strong reaction to both the Pell resolution and
 the amendment to-the Asian Development Bank funding bill was
 intended in part to emphasize their concern that the Taiwan issue
 be handled in a way that does not:
 -- Publicly embarrass Beijing and force it to respond
 forcefully.
 -- Cast doubt on the administration's commitment to a one
 China policy.
 A.senior Chinese official, who will accompany Zhao, underscored
 this theme in a recent conversation with a US Embassy officer in
 Beijing.
 Stabilizing Ties
 Underlying their concern over Taiwan is, we believe, a
 genuine fear that Sino-US relations could deteriorate again,.
 jeopardizing their strategic and economic interests.  Although
 Beijing no longer is interested in pushing publicly for -a "united
 front" against the USSR, we believe the Chinese still want a
 limited, more tacit security relationship with Washington that
 creates uncertainty in the Kremlin about the degree of support
 the US might lend China in response to an overt Soviet military
 threat.  The Chinese interest in access to US dual technology,
 some US weaponry sales, and good political relations in general
 indicates the value they still attach to the US as a strategic

 Although the Chinese are unhappy with some of our economic
 policies (e.g. textiles), they remain very interested in
 promoting broader economic ties to facilitate their economic
 modernization drive.   From all accounts, they especially prize
 American technology and continue to encourage foreign, and
 counterweight to Soviet military power.   Indeed  the Chinese have
 repeatedly insisted                                     neither       ?25X1

 approach to containing the Soviets has changed.                        25X1

 is closely identified with the open door policy--and hence has a
 vested interest in demonstrating the benefits of this strategy.
 Triangular. Politics
 At a minimum, Beijing does not want to lose ground in
 the triangle as the US presidential election campaign heats up.
 Judging.by recent commentary in the Chinese media, Chinese
 leaders remain concerned that the administration might be tempted
 to try to enhance its reelection prospects by reaching an accord
 on INF with Moscow that would damage Chinese interests.
 Because of current US-Soviet strains, on the other hand, the
 Chinese may see an opportunity to improve relations with both the
 US and USSR.   If so, they may decide after the Zhao trip to adopt
 a more flexible position on, for example, confidence building
 measures during the next round of Sino-Soviet talks in March,
 hoping to move Sino-Soviet relations forward and increase their
 leverage with the US at the same time.

 Zhao Ziyanq--A Political Portrait
 Summary
 Zhao Ziyang, at 64,          is  the  youngest of six members on  the
 Politburo Standing Committee,  China's most powerful policymaking
 council,  and formally ranks fourth in  the Chinese Communist Partu
 hierarchy,  after Hu Yaohang,             Ye Jianying and Deng Xiaopinq.
 Together with party General Secretary Hu Yaobang,  Zhao will
 preside over a  transfer of power from  the waning generation of
 old revolutionaries  to a group of leaders who matured under  the
 Communist system.   Zhao has demonstrated both political  skill  and
 administrative expertise in his rapid ascent  to national
 prominence,  and he can be expected to play a leading role in  the
 decade ahead.
 Sources of Influence
 Zhao is in a key position to affect both the broad contours
 of policy and the details of implementation that give substance
 to general policy directives:
 -- Within the Chinese system, Zhao commands instant respect
 as a member of the party's top echelon.   He Darticipates
 in the highest policy deliberations within the Politburo
 Standing Committee and is an ex officio member of the
 party's Secretariat, which handles day-to-day party
 business.   His views carry political weight exceeded only
 by that of a handful of party elders--notably Deng
 Xiaopinq, Chen Yun and Peng Zhen.
 This memorandum was  prepared by the China Division of the
 Office of East Asian Analysis as background for  the visit of PRC
 Premier Zhao Ziyang to  the United States.   Questions and comments
 on  the memorandum are welcome and may be directed to  the Chief,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/17: CIA-RDP85T00287R001000030001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/17: CIA-RDP85T00287R001000030001-9
 As Premier of the State Council, Zhao stands at the apex
 of the governmental apparatus.   Below the critical policy
 threshold of the Politburo, he is the final administrative
 authority and has broad latitude in devising the specific
 details of policy implementation.   The organizational
 resources at his disposal are formidable.
 By most accounts, Zhao appears to enjoy the confidence of
 senior leaders normally suspicious of possible rivals and
 jealous of their prerogatives.   They presumably find much
 to admire in Zhao's makeup:   a quick study who is not
 intimidated by details; a model of sobriety, discretion,
 and tact; and party experience that includes the requisite
 degree of toughness--even ruthlessness--as a former land
 reform and party purge administrator in provincial
 assignments.
 Zhao and the Leadership
 Zhao appears to have the knack of pleasing his superiors and
 the corresponding gift of arousing few animosities among his
 peers.   Unlike Hu Yaobang, he has placed relatively few
 supporters in positions of influence.   For having spent a
 lifetime in the party, he has created no readily identifiable
 enemies while winning support of the powerful.   His rapid climb
 to become China's youngest provincial first secretary in 1965
 presumably had the approval of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, who
 was then party general secretary.   His early rehabilitation
 following the Cultural Revolution bears the imprimatur of Zhou
 Enlai as well.
 Although there may be no close personal ties between Zhao
 and Deng--such as exist, for example, between Deng.and General
 Secretary Hu Yaobang--there is certainly mutual respect.   Deng,
 China's single most powerful leader, was probably instrumental  in
 transferring Zhao to Sichuan Province in 1975 and in providing
 him the freedom for economic experiments there that eventually
 became the national model.   Zhao's rapid rise is inconceivable
 without Deng's sponsorship. -Deng and Zhao have shown through
 their statements and actions that they agree on reforming China's
 party,  government,  and economy.
 It is possible that Zhao's relative distance from Deng made
 him all the more acceptable to other, more conservative, members
 of the Politburo Standing Committee.   Zhao appears to enjoy good
 relations with State President Li Xiannian, who has spent his
 career within China's economic bureaucracy, and with veteran
 economic policymaker Chen Yun--whom we  believe is second only to
 Deng in prestige within the party.   When opinions differ, Zhao
 seems to have no problem deferring to the views of elder party
 leaders.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/17: CIA-RDP85T00287R001000030001-9
 Zhao also seems to have a stable working relationship with
 party General Secretary Hu.   Their areas of responsibility are
 fairly well defined along party-government lines, with Hu the
 party chief having the acknowledged upper hand.   Zhao projects
 the image of a team,player and detail man who faithfully
 implements the party line, apparently modeling his behavior after
 that of Zhou Enlai, Mao's long-time lieutenant.   Hu eventually
 may view as threatening Zhao's mastery of the details of economic
 adminstration and government organization.   For now, however,
 there is no indication that this is the case.
 Policy Preferences
 As with all but the most outspoken Chinese leaders,  it is
 difficult to distinguish Zhao's own views from official
 positions.   It has been Zhao's place as the government's
 principal spokesman to announce major political and economic
 initiatives.   In the eyes'of most Chinese, however, he is clearly
 identified with bureaucratic and economic reforms.   Most
 observers,  in fact, are impressed by Zhao's apparently deep
 commitment to economic reform. Almost certainly part of Zhao's
 early appeal as a candidate for the premiership was his
 unequivocal willingness to support the reform initiatives of Denq
 and his allies.
 In particular, Zhao has strongly supported measures to
 decentralize some economic decisionmaking responsibilities,
 restructure and rejuvenate China's bureaucracy, and establish
 "special economic zones" to attract western capital and tech-
 nology.   Although they have achieved only limited success, these
 measures remain at the center of Beijing's program.   In the case
 of economic decisionmaking, party policy continues to vacillate
 between relaxation and restoration of central controls.
 In foreign policy Zhao has an important administrative role
 and, by virtue of his position on the Politburo Standing
 Committee, oarticipates in policy deliberations.   On most issues,
 he accurately reflects the party consensus established under
 Deng's leadership.   While his public statements are often bland,
 in numerous private conversations Zhao has shown himself to be a
 strong proponent of China's opening to the West and the United
 States and convinced, that China will ultimately derive economic
 advantages from improved political ties to Western nations.
 Zhao's career also demonstrates that he is in tune with the
 senior party leadership on the question of party primacy, an
 underlying element in the current campaign  against "spiritual
 pollution."   Zhao and others of the so-called reform group within
 the party seek change, but only within a system that does not
 allow opposition to--or even implied reservations about--the
 party's leading position or the proclaimed superiority of
 social ism.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/17: CIA-RDP85T00287R001000030001-9
 The Decade Ahead
 Zhao appears to have capably filled the office of premier,
 which makes heavy demands on its occupant.  The premier must span
 the chasm between politics and administration, striking a
 workable balance between the need for bureaucratic routine and
 shifting political requirements.   Zhao has demonstrated political
 flexibility and administrative firmness that have impressed
 Chinese and Western observers alike.
 The problems complicating Beijing's*ambitious policy agenda
 for the 1980s will, in our view, dampen the prospects for most
 economic and political initiatives.   Such successes as are
 achieved should redound to Zhao's political advantage,  improving
 his already favorable image.
 Zhao's deportment in office and smooth relations with senior
 leaders lead us to conclude that his political durability
 surpasses that of any generational peer,  including Hu Yaobanq.
 Several Chinese observers have suggested that, should Hu falter
 as party leader, Zhao would be a logical replacement.   We have no
 clear indication, however, of the extent of Zhao's ambitions.   If
 he does not challenge for primacy within the party and is content
 to operate as China's businesslike manager of government, his
 importance will probably grow as political generations change.

 China:   Leadership Politics
 Summary
 Zhao Ziyang will  be visiting the US at a  time when China's
 domestic political      situation is  complex and uncertain.   No majgr
 personnel  changes  have been made at     the  top--Deng Xiaoping is
 more       than ever China's paramount leader,  and others in the
 Politburo Standing Committee,       including Zhao,   have maintained
 their positions.  Nevertheless,  subtle  changes in  the power and
 prestige of several  senior leaders seem       to have had an effect on
 the content  and. direction of China's domestic policies.
 A Transitional Year
 For Beijing, 1983 was a year of amibitious initiatives.   The
 reform group--led by Deng, General Secretary Hu Yaobang and
 Zhao--had brought off a successful  12th Party Congress, and
 seemed determined to deal simultaneously with a host of tough
 political problems--bureaucratic reorganization,  ideological
 confusion,  party rectification,  official  corruption,  and a rise
 in street crime--while trying to maintain momentum in economic
 reform.   Their record has been mixed at best,  in part because of
 the growing influence of more conservative party elders--Deng's
 generational peers--who have questioned reforms with greater
 effect since mid-year.
 We believe that the elevation of Li Xiannian to State
 Presidency and of Peng Zhen to Chairmanship of the National
 People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee at the June NPC

 session is symptomatic of the reassertiveness of party
 traditionalists, and helps explain the more conservative tone of
 Beijing's recent domestic policy pronouncements.   Li and Peng'
 draw their support from the dwindling but still influential old
 guard of the party, which is ideologically orthodox, suspicious
 of younger leaders, wary of reforms that diminish party controls
 over society, and unwilling to retire gracefully from power.
 Deng probably shares their views on some issues, such as party
 Spiritual Pollution--A Confusing Departure
 For reasons that are still unclear, the Chinese leadership
 recently undertook a new political campaign that has apparently
 baffled many party, members by blurring the focus of China's
 entire political program.   For years, Deng and his allies have
 insisted that Cultural Revolution era leftists who remained-in
 positions of authority were the cause of most of China's problems
 and should be purged from the party and replaced with younger,
 better educated recruits.   A Central  Committee plenary meeting  in
 October finalized plans for a three-year "rectification" of the
 party that would eliminate politically unreliable and incompetent

 Deng's speech to the plenum, however, also set off a
 campaign against "rightist" phenomena: the spread of undesirable
 Western intellectual and cultural  influences in China and of
 doubt over the party's ability and right to rule.   Deng charged
 that some of the party's own propagandists had spread this
 "spiritual pollution" by publishing articles on humanism and
 "alienation in socialism," and that this attitude of "liberalism"
 had to be eliminated.   While his remarks were generally
 consistent with ideas other party traditionalists have expressed
 before, the intensity?and breadth of the campaign that has ensued
 Perhaps the most visible result of the campaign against
 spiritual pollution has been the confusion it has provoked
 throughout China about the direction of domestic policies,
 especially reform.   Since mid-November, the party has been trying
 to define the limits of the spiritual pollution campaign and
 prevent it from disrupting agricultural work, foreign trade,
 science and technology, and foreign relations.   Zhao has not
 played a prominent role in the campaign
 Progress has been slow, however, in Dart because
 authoritative Politburo guidance still has not been issued.
 Until  the line from Beijing becomes clearer,  the negative effects
 of the campaign--such as local attacks on reform, confusion over
 policies and intellectual distrust of the party--will persist.

 The campaign also has aroused speculation about political
 infighting within the Politburo.   Some of the spiritual pollution
 commentaries have contained implicit criticism of Hu Yaobang, who
 has been associated with the "liberal" wing of the party, even
 though he is on record criticizing writers for the mistakes now
 under attack.  There are rumors of high level dissatisfaction
 with Hu's judgment and leadership style.   Some of the stories
 even suggested that Deng has found Hu lacking in the essential
 skills of leadership.   The cumulative effect of this, plus his
 relatively low profile in the campaign, may have damaged Hu's
 Since-early 1980, Deng has sought to nail down for Hu
 Yaobang a place as his political heir, and, more broadly, to
 establish procedures for orderly succession that would avert
 political instability.   Zhao's appointment to the premiership
 also is part of this transition to a younger leadership.   In
 contrast to Hu, Zhao has not suffered any visible damage from the
 recent turn of political events, despite his clear association
 image as the party's nominal  leader.
 Were Deng to die today, his place as first among equals
 within the Chinese leadership would probably fall to one of his
 generational peers, such as Li Xiannian or Peng Zhen, rather than
 to Hu or Zhao.   Hu would probably continue to preside over rather
 than actually lead the party, in much the same way as. he has
 under Deng.   Zhao, for his part, would almost certainly remain as
 China's Premier, as there seems a general consensus that he has
 performed caoably in that role.   As the party's old guard are
 Deng's age or older, Hu's best strategy would he to maintain his
 position and wait for them to fade.   In this regard, he still has
 substantial advantages over ootential rivals in his own or
 younger generations.  The entire succession question, however,  is
 still very much in Deng's hands.   Still in good health, and with
 his political prestige at its highest ever, Deng seems not to be

 China's. Economy:   An Overview
 Summary
 In the economic realm,  Zhao Ziyanq faces  two sets of
 issues:   those familiar   to most world leaders--inflation,
 unemployment,  and budget  deficits--and a second set of more
 fundamental  economic problems  that  are  the legacy of.  20  years of
 Chinese mismanagement.     These include chronic energy, and
 transportation shortages,  and a management system  that  encouraqes
 inefficient,  wasteful  operations.   Over  the  vast few  years,
 stabilization policies aimed at  curtailing inflation and reducing
 unemployment repeatedly have interfered with efforts       to solve
 these more fundamental  problems.
 The Chinese economy today clearly is in better shape than it
 was just a few years ago.     Improvements are particularly evident
 in personal consumption and in agriculture.   Beijing's "open
 door" policies with respect to foreign trade and investment have
 also contributed to the overall health of the economy.   More
 important, there is a.growi      derliness and direction in
 economic policymaking.
 The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85), which was not finally
 approved until late 1982, provides a reasonably well-defined
 policy framework.   During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) the
 state planning apparatus was dismantled.   Now, the olanninq
 agencies have been reestablished and strengthened, and they have
 produced a plan that Beijing regards as its most complete,
 practicall  and realizable five-year plan since the early 1950s.
 This memorandum was prepared by the China Division of the
 Office of East Asian Analysis as  background for  the visit of PRC
 Premier Zhao Ziyang to  the United States.   Questions and comments
 on  the memorandum are welcome and may be directed to  the Chief,

 However, the Chinese economy is still very much in a
 recovery phase--recovering from 20-years of mismanagement.   And
 the government repeatedly has set aside measures designed to
 speed up recovery when it felt that it had to deal with more
 immediate threats to economic    ability--inflation, unemployment,
 and budget deficits.
 Good Growth, But...
 In general, the period since 1978 has been one of relatively
 high growth rates accompanied by continuing signs of imbalance.
 In 1982 economic growth was moderate-to-good with GNP and
 industrial production each rising by over 7 percent.   In other
 areas:
 -- Energy production rose by 5.7 percent,  easing severe
 energy shortages:
 -- Agricultural output, benefiting from favorable weather and
 a continuation of liberal Policies, grew by 11 percent.
 -- Foreign exchange reserves rose to US $ 11.3 billion as
 Chinese exports increased and imports continued to fall
 because, of diminished needs for foreign grain and
 industrial materials and equipment`.
 -- Personal  income growth slowed, but consumer demand still
 outstripped commodity supplies.
 -- In the absence of high-quality, stylish goods, consumers
 continued to deposit large sums of money in savings
 accounts; and inventories of rejected merchandise
 continued to pile up.
 -- The inflation rate was at least 5 to 10 percent.
 -- Urban unemployment probably rose, to about 10 percent.
 Systemic problems persisted in 1982, despite the favorable
 overall picture:
 There was no improvement in the wasteful use of
 resources.   More energy and raw materials were used per
 unit of output.
 Quality remained a serious problem, especially for
 consumer goods.
 Continuing high industrial costs resulted in state revenue
 shortfalls.                                                               25X1

 t I.
 Ironically, management reforms aimed at reducing waste made
 it more difficult for China to complete urgently needed energy
 and transportation projects.   Beijing's decision to allow
 enterprises to retain part of their profits, for example,  led to
 heavy investment by enterprises in projects that the central
 government regarded as low priority.   This stretched supplies of
 scarce building materials and made it impossible to guarantee
 cement, steel, glass, and other building materials to high
 1983 saw a continuation of these problems.   Investment
 spending.was reportedly up by over 10 percent, despite the
 leadership's efforts to hold it at the-1982 level.   In response,
 the central government has ordered a review of the construction
 program; lower priority projects are to be halted or dropped.
 And new, tougher regulations pertaining to project review and
 Too-rapid growth in industry continues to thwart efforts to
 get managers to  improve quality and cut costs.   As a result,
 state revenue shortfalls--a result of enterprise losses--have
 reached unanticipated levels.   The situation is so serious that
 Zhao has warned provincial  leaders that failure to reduce the
 deficits could cost them their jobs.
 Management Reforms:   Mixed Results
 Some of these difficulties are attributable to, or have been
 aggravated by, management reforms.   The basic thrust of reforms
 has been to decentralize decisionmaking in an attempt to boost
 production and efficiency.   Reforms in agriculture have shown the
 most success.   Essentially, they entail a reduction of the
 government's role in production and marketing decisions.   Now,
 the bulk of these decisions apparently are made by farm
 households.   In industry, the reforms allow enterprises to retain
 a portion of their profits.   But because of mayor irrationalities
 in China's price system, the,changes have not produced the
 desired effects.   For example, at current prices, managers and
 local officials find it more profitable to build a factory to
 produce cigarettes than to invest in a new mine or plant
 producing industrial raw materials--where, despite scarcities,
 Currently, Beijing has adopted a more cautious approach to
 economic reform.   Further, minor changes are being made in the
 hope of improving efficiency.   But because there are so many day-
 to-day problems that demand attention,  and because economic
 reform is complex--and politically risky--the leadership has
 postponed further major changes until,.they say, sometime after
