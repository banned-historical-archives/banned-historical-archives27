 China: The Continuing Search
 for a Modernization Strategy
 Summary              For the past two years the fundamental problem for policymakers of the
 People's Republic of China has been deciding upon the means for
 transforming the world's largest underdeveloped country into a modern,
 industrialized state. Freed of the dominating influence of Mao Zedong in
 1976, the PRC leadership's first attempt at solutions was embodied in the
 10-year draft plan (1976-85), unveiled in February 1978. The plan was
 intended to lay the groundwork for eventually bringing about the "four
 modernizations"-of agriculture, industry, national defense, and science
 and technology.
 Although the new plan gave more prominence to developing agriculture
 than in the past, the plan's central focus on heavy industrial growth
 constituted a continuation of Chinese policies of the previous two decades.
 The most innovative element in the plan was China's unprecedented
 willingness to use massive imports of Western equipment and technology in
 the development effort.
 Between the announcement of the new plan in February and the watershed
 Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party in December 1978, the CCP
 leadership came to a new and sobering appraisal of the size and nature of the
 gap between China's existing capabilities and its ambitions. During 1978,
 surveys of PRC natural resources, construction programs, and trained
 manpower-together with investigations of how Chinese production proc-
 esses and institutions had functioned over the past decade-began to give
 the leadership a much better appreciation of China's weaknesses. On the
 international side, the knowledge garnered from the surge in delegations
 sent abroad and from foreign visitors to China made the government more
 aware of the costs and problems involved in exploiting foreign resources.
 By the time of the Plenum the central leadership had also concluded that
 large segments of the Chinese Communist Party were not oriented toward
 the goals of modernization and could not be depended upon to be fully
 responsive to orders from the central authority. At the same time, the regime
 also concluded that other important institutional changes were necessary-
 in legal systems, in educational and cultural policy, and in attitudes toward
 population control-for economic modernization to proceed.
 At and after the Third Plenum the leadership shelved the 10-year plan and
 embarked on a three-year (1979-81) readjustment program. The underlying
 theme of Chinese domestic policy since then has been that economic
 productivity, consumer welfare, and political stability are interrelated. The
 many changes in economic policy since the Plenum  increasing the
 material incentives for production and hence the incomes of workers and
 peasants, installing new systems of rewards and penalties for individual
 managers and economic entities, and experimenting with new and more
 efficient forms of industrial organization-are all aimed at productivity
 increases.
 In effect, the regime is making an unprecedented appeal to the self-interest
 of the Chinese population. Incomes are beginning to rise, most notably in
 agriculture, but also in industry, and the leadership has already begun to
 grapple with the problem of managing and meeting consumer demand for
 more and better quality goods and services. The growth of consumer
 expectations is now a major problem for the government and will remain so
 for years to come.
 Political stability enters into the relationship between consumer welfare and
 productivity because the leadership believes that its grasp on power and the
 permanence of its policies pivots on demonstrating the benefits of the new
 policies for most of the Chinese population. In the absence of improvements
 in consumer welfare, productivity will remain low and the potential for
 political disruption, as well as the leadership's vulnerability to challenges
 from within the party, will increase.
 Resource allocation policies were also shifted at and after the Third Plenum
 by the leadership to support the new policy course. Investment in heavy
 industry, particularly iron and steel, was cut back while the allocations to
 agriculture, light industry, and the building materials industry were
 increased. While maintaining its interest in acquiring foreign equipment
 and technology and continuing to solicit and to receive long-term credits to
 pay for it, the leadership suspended or postponed a number of planned
 purchases from abroad. The domestic construction program was also cut
 back, eliminating poorly planned projects and those requiring long lead-
 times. The new priorities focus on easing longstanding constraints on
 industrial production-electric power, coal and building materials, and
 transportation.
 The leadership will not be able to complete this "readjustment" within the
 planned three-year period and has already indicated that the process will
 take more time. First, the new policy course still has not been completely
 accepted within the party, in part because the changes are such radical
 departures from the policies of the Maoist era and in part because of
 bureaucratic resistance to changes of any kind, Since May 1979 a campaign
 has been under way to defend the policies of the Third Plenum and to screen
 out party members unwilling to adapt to the new tasks of modernization.
 Second, although the new incentives policies have given new impetus to
 production in agriculture, the changes in industrial incentives and organiza-
 tional policies are being implemented only slowly and have not so far
 stimulated industrial output. Third, new construction in the bottleneck areas
 of Chinese industry will take three to five years to complete; hence the
 present constraints in the energy, raw material, and transportation sectors
 probably will not begin to loosen until some time beyond 1981.
 Over the next few years, we expect the growth of gross national product to
 fall off from the average 6-percent rate of the past two decades to around
 5 percent. Moreover, the sources of growth will also change, with industrial
 growth slowing, perhaps to around 6 to 7 percent per year, and agricultural
 growth picking up significantly to something on the order of 4 to 5 percent
 per year. While foreign equipment and technology will continue to flow into
 the PRC at higher rates than in the past, deepseated problems in absorbing
 these imports will be overcome only gradually. With the exception of
 imported fertilizer plants, foreign technology is unlikely to have much of an
 impact on production during this period.
 The experiences of the past two years have made the Chinese leadership
 circumspect in discussing possible development strategies for the 1980s and
 1990s. It cannot make systematic, long-term plans for the economy until the
 results of the current period of readjustment begin to come in. The sparse
 information received thus far on Chinese thinking about the next two
 decades suggests, however, that agricultural development will continue to be
 viewed as the fundamental basis for economic modernization and the point
 of departure for pursuit of import substitution policies. These policies would
 gradually decrease the present PRC dependence on imports for food, fibers,
 and industrial materials and eventually lead to greater use of export
 earnings for purchases of high technology processes and equipment. This
 strategy seems aimed at initially heavy exploitation and then eventual
 diminution of PRC economic linkages to the developed world to create the
 conditions for domestically driven, "self-reliant" economic growth.
 In any case, two major variables affect economic as well as all other plans for
 long-term modernization: The first is whether the present leadership can
 consolidate its hold on power and implement its current and contemplated
 economic policies. Success in this endeavor is by no means assured and is
 further complicated by the likelihood that many in the leadership will pass
 from the scene during the next five to 10 years. The second is whether the
 policy of placing a low priority on Chinese military modernization by linking
 it to the eventual development of a modern industrial base can be continued.
 A serious deterioration in relations with the Soviet Union or Vietnam could
 lead to increased allocations of resources to the military at the expense of
 economic development.

 for a Modernization Strategy
 The Challenge of Modernization
 Historical factors and others of more recent origin are
 driving the Chinese leadership in its effort to modern-
 ize the PRC. The present leadership's perception of the
 weakness of China relative to the great powers, the
 USSR, Japan, and the United States, was also shared
 by their predecessors, going back to the last century.
 Similarly, China's present leaders share their prede-
 cessors' fundamental conviction that China rightfully
 belongs in the front rank of the world powers. The
 Chinese Communist achievement has been the unifica-
 tion of the state and the mobilization of its potentially
 rich human and material resources to a point where the
 PRC is now accepted as a major participant in the
 international arena and is now less vulnerable to
 pressures from outside powers than it has been since
 the mid-1800s.
 Nevertheless, China remains a huge underdeveloped
 country with an economy that has grown at a
 respectable rate of about 6 percent (about the same as
 the average growth rate of all non-Communist less
 developed countries since 1961). With a population of
 I billion per capita GNP works out to around $400 per
 year (see the table). In recent years the Chinese
 leaders, like leaders in a number of other LDCs, have
 grappled with slow rates of increase in agricultural
 production that only narrowly exceed the 2-percent
 annual rate of growth of population and has periodi-
 cally been forced to import grain from abroad for
 maintenance of consumption levels. As with other
 LDCs, China's industry provides only limited opportu-
 nities for expanded employment and embodies levels of
 technology that with few exceptions range from 10 to
 30 years behind those of industry in the developed
 countries. Inadequately developed systems of transpor-
 tation, distribution, and fuel and power supply also
 cause sporadic fluctuations in industrial output.'
 Several factors separate the PRC from the rest of the
 less developed world. First, China has a modest but
 credible nuclear force and maintains a 4 million man

 conventional armed force that dwarfs those of other
 LDCs. While China's capabilities for defending its
 territory against conventional attack seem strong, like
 other LDCs it has only limited capabilities for using its
 forces far beyond its borders. Second, although it
 shares many of the problems faced by other predomi-
 nantly agricultural LDCs, China has a better cushion
 against wide swings in total crop output (as India, for
 example, does not), since it grows a large number of
 diverse crops under a variety of differing weather
 regimens. Yields per hectare for most Chinese crops,
 while higher than those in many LDCs, also have some
 distance to go before diminishing returns set in. Third,
 China's energy and mineral resource endowment
 compares favorably with those of the United States
 and the USSR; but except for oil the PRC's exploita-
 tion of these resources has been slow and difficult.
 Fourth, since breaking its close relationship with the
 Soviet Union in 1960, China has only recently begun to
 develop the linkages with the world economy that
 prevail in most LDCs. This has clearly lessened its
 vulnerability to foreign economic pressures, kept levels
 of foreign debt low, and insulated China from the
 effects of adverse developments in the world economy.
 Nevertheless, it has also severely limited the PRC's
 access to the financial and technological resources of
 the developed world.
 The PRC appears also to have distributed the sparse
 fruits of economic growth more evenly among its huge
 population than is the case in almost every other LDC.
 This has been accomplished through rationing and
 other administrative policies and by promoting a
 national ethos that deemphasizes material rewards as
 incentives to production. Although this more equitable
 pattern of income distribution contrasts strongly with
 conditions in other LDCs, that accomplishment has
 entailed a substantial if unquantifiable cost. The more
 rapid growth and industrial development that marks
 such LDCs as South Korea and Taiwan is in part the
 result of government policies of emphasizing material
 incentives to production despite the consequent widen-
 ing of income differentials. Finally, for the past two
 decades the PRC has experienced political upheavals
 that have brought economic progress to a halt, crippled
 the institutions of government-including the ruling
 Chinese Communist Party-and led sizable segments
 of lower level party and government cadre to avoid,
 responsibility and initiative in their work for fear of
 political reprisal.
 Thus the problem of China's economic, military, and
 political backwardness has been only partially amelio-
 rated over the past three decades. The current leader-
 ship is nominally headed by Hua Guofeng but has been
 goaded into seeking new ways of grappling with the
 problem by Deng Xiaoping. The leaders appear
 convinced that this backwardness must be rectified if
 the PRC is to project more forcefully the preeminent
 role in Asian and world affairs that they perceive to be
 its right. This perception of weakness has been
 reinforced by their observation of the rapid rate and
 increasing complexity of technological change and its
 impact on both defense establishments and conditions
 of life in most countries of the world. Further, many of
 the leaders now appear to have concluded that the
 political institutions and modes of governing that have
 evolved in the PRC since the late 1950s have con-
 strained growth and are at least partially responsible
 for the widening of the gap between Chinese economic
 and technological levels and those of the developed
 world. The system of government in China from 1949
 to 1976 was deeply influenced by the visionary and
 sometimes capricious decisions of one man, Mao
 Zedong. Both outside observers and, latterly, many of
 the current leadership cite Mao's dominance of policy
 as the major factor responsible for the political
 instability and the poor performance of the economy
 after the Leap Forward of 1958, and during the
 Cultural Revolution of 1966-71 and the succession
 struggles of 1974-76.
 The attempt to change the PRC's status from that of
 an LDC to a front-rank developed state is described as
 the program of achieving the "four modernizations"-
 of Chinese agriculture, industry, national defense, and
 science and technology-by the end of this century. To
 accomplish this, however, it will also be necessary to
 achieve what might be called a "fifth modernization."
 That is, installing a new political and social order that
 will facilitate rather than constrain the leadership's
 attempt to overcome the many obstacles that lie ahead.
 The Modernization Effort
 All Chinese discussion of the "four modernizations"
 since the idea was first broached by Zhou Enlai in
 1975 have viewed the process as a multistaged effort to
 achieve the status of a "front rank" economic power by
 the year 2000. To date this general goal has not been
 more precisely defined and the leadership has been
 circumspect about announcing specific goals for what
 they call the "New Long March." Announced long-
 term goals have been few in number and subsequently
 revised downward or abandoned. Ongoing discussion
 of planning priorities and the clearly evolutionary
 nature of current policies suggest that the process of
 determining the ends and means of China's moderniza-
 tion will remain a practical matter involving much trial
 and error.
 The Transient 10-Year Plan. Most of the known long-
 term economic goals were made public when the draft
 outline of the 10-year plan (1976-85) was discussed by
 Chairman Hua Guofeng at the Fifth National People's
 Congress in February 1978. Grain production was
 targeted to reach 400 million tons by 1985, implying
 an expected annual rate of growth of 4.3 percent-well
 above the 3.2-percent average of 1965-77. The value of
 total agricultural output was projected to rise at an
 annual rate of 4 to 5 percent, or I to 2 percent above
 the rate prevailing between 1965 and 1977. Industrial
 production was planned to rise at more than 10 percent
 annually, also above the 9 percent average annual
 growth of the past decade. Steel production was slated
 to nearly double from the 32 million tons produced in
 1978 to 60 million tons in 1985. Two goals revealed in
 other discussions during 1978 were that coal produc-
 tion by 1987 (rather than 1985) would double to more
 than I billion tons and that light industrial production
 between 1978 and 1985 would grow at a 12-percent
 annual rate-sizably faster than the 7 to 8 percent rate
 of growth of consumer goods over the previous two
 decades.
 To attain these ambitious levels of production, Hua
 Guofeng noted that agricultural investment would be
 stepped up and that "basic" mechanization of agricul-
 ture would be achieved by 1980 in order to break the
 sector out of its past pattern of slow growth and to
 provide impetus for overall economic development. In
 addition, Hua sketched out an investment program for
 industry and transportation asserting that during the
 next eight years "the state plans to build or complete
 120 large-scale projects, including 10 iron and steel
 complexes, nine nonferrous metals complexes, eight
 coal mines, 10 oil and gas fields, 30 power stations, six
 new trunk railways, and five key harbors." The
 magnitude of the proposed effort to invest in new
 capacity was underlined by Hun's statement that the
 capital construction effort as a whole in 1978-85, in
 terms of funds budgeted, would equal the total for the
 previous 28 years r
 The Great Leap Outward. The key clement that set this
 program of economic modernization apart from such
 earlier Chinese pushes for economic growth as the
 First Five-Year Plan (1953-57) and the Great Leap
 Forward of 1958 was the major role assigned to
 massive imports of Western equipment, complete
 plants, and technology. Although official pronounce-
 ments in favor of expanding foreign trade and making
 greater use of foreign technology to speed moderniza-
 tion began soon after the fall of the Gang of Four in
 1976, during 1978 not only foreign trade and commer-
 cial policies but the whole spectrum of PRC attitudes
 toward the outside world shifted into more open and
 liberal lines.
 In February 1.978 an eight-year long-term trade
 agreement was signed with Japan calling for an
 exchange of $10 billion worth of Chinese oil and coal
 for an equal amount of Japanese plant and equipment.
 Later in the year Beijing and Tokyo agreed to extend
 the agreement for an additional five years. At midyear
 a trade agreement was signed with the European
 Community setting up a framework for expanded
 trade and by yearend several technical cooperation
 agreements had been signed with foreign countries and
 organizations. PRC investigation of the systems of
 industrial and business management used in the non-
 Communist developed states as well as in Romania,
 Hungary, and Yugoslavia intensified. Beijing also
 began sending the first of what were expected to be
 large numbers of Chinese students abroad to study

 science and technology and opened China up to foreign
 scholars, students, and tourists as well as foreign
 technicians and businessmen. Domestically, the PRC
 reinstated the study of foreign languages, primarily
 English and Japanese, both in the slowly reviving
 formal education system and in part-time programs in
 factories and in urban areas.
 Most attention focused, however, on the PRC import
 program. During 1978 the number of Chinese delega-
 tions going abroad and foreign businessmen coming in
 surged as Beijing stepped up its search for industrial
 technology and equipment from Japan, Western
 Europe, and the United States. By the end of the year
 the PRC had been involved in negotiations for about
 $40 billion in complete industrial plants, modern
 equipment, and related technology, and had signed
 contracts amounting to $7 billion.
 I n mid-1978 still more projects were added to the PRC
 construction program. These indications that the
 timetable for modernization had been accelerated plus
 the high level of PRC negotiating and fact-finding
 activity abroad fueled speculation that the import
 program was carefully worked out and would involve
 hundreds of billions of dollars in capital equipment and
 technical services. On the other hand, Li Xiannian was
 reported in the fall of 1978 as observing that a two-
 year period would be necessary before PRC economic
 construction programs could get off the ground. At the
 same time, a number of foreign visitors noted that the
 Chinese were unwilling to discuss the specifics of the
 import program.
 Uncertainty and an openness to change also marked
 other aspects of PRC foreign trade and financing
 policies throughout 1978. By midyear the regime had
 announced that it would accept such unprecedented
 arrangements: (a) long-term credits and the financing
 of capital imports through foreign bank deposits with
 the Bank of China; (b) barter and compensation deals
 for plant purchases; (c) the importing of materials to
 reprocess for export; (d) designation of certain fac-
 tories to produce goods for specific foreign markets;
 and (e) fuller compliance with international standards
 on patents, trademarks, and copyrights. At the same
 time Chinese officials had also maintained that direct
 government-to-government loans, joint ventures with
 foreign firms, and private foreign investment were
 unacceptable. By yearend, however, the PRC had
 dropped these strictures and all three measures were
 under consideration.
 In summary, the only new element in the draft 10-
 Year Plan was the unprecedented readiness of the
 PRC to develop closer linkages with the developed
 world. While agricultural development received more
 prominence than in the past, the plan retained the
 PRC's traditional emphasis upon rapid heavy indus-
 trial development. In focusing popular attention on this
 new and optimistic plan for the future, the leadership
 also appeared to be attempting to get the population
 "on board" and looking forward-rather than dwelling
 on the economic problems and political disruptions
 that had occurred since 1967. In any event, it is clear
 that the obstacles to carrying out the plan posed by
 China's economic problems were not completely un-
 derstood by the leadership until after the plan was
 announced.
 Between the February 1978 announcement of the
 10-Year Plan and the watershed Third Plenum of the
 CCP in December 1978 the Chinese leadership came
 to a new and sobering appraisal of the size and nature
 of the gap between China's existent capabilities and its
 ambitions. During 1978, surveys of the PRC's natural
 resources, construction programs, and trained man-
 power as well as investigations of how Chinese
 production processes and institutions had functioned
 over the past decade had begun to give the leadership a
 much better appreciation of China's weaknesses than
 was the case earlier in the year. On the foreign side, the
 knowledge garnered by delegations sent abroad and
 from foreigners visiting the country made the govern-
 ment more cognizant of the costs and problems
 involved in exploiting foreign resources.
 Economic performance during 1978 was also not
 reassuring to the leadership in its attempt to modern-
 ize. On one hand, the leadership could derive satisfac-
 tion from the recovery of agricultural production in
 1978-up 8 percent after three years of no increases.
 On the other hand, Chinese industrial production,
 which had begun to level off during the last three
 quarters of the year, was disappointing and appears to
 have been a major factor behind the new industrial
 policies brought forward in December. By the time of
 the Plenum the central leadership had also concluded
 that the Chinese Communist Party apparatus itself
 was deeply resistant to the kind of changes required for
 modernization. Policies adopted at and after the Third
 Plenum strongly suggested that some of the higher
 level party leaders and much of the CCP rank and file
 were insufficiently responsive to directives from the
 center and remained unwilling to depart from the
 policies and practices of the past.
 All of these problems were examined in depth at
 several lengthy conferences on economic and
 political problems held between mid-September and
 15 December when the Plenum was formally
 convened.
 The CCP Change in Course-the Third Plenum,
 December 1978. At the Third Plenum the CCP
 formally announced that the emphasis on political
 struggle of past decades had ended and that the
 general tasks of the party now would focus on "socialist
 modernization." The new focus, however, was not on
 pushing for ambitious, long-term goals but rather on
 remedying the conditions that constrained rapid eco-
 nomic development. Thus the draft 10-Year Plan,
 announced 10 months earlier, was not mentioned in the
 materials of the Plenum. Rather the Plenum focused
 on the national economic plans (ji-hua) for 1979 and
 1980. These annual plans were described as parts of
 three-year (1978-80) and eight-year (1978-85) pro-
 grams (gui-hua) for the "development of the national
 economy" as well as part of a 23-year (1978-2000)
 outline (she-xiang) for the Four Modernizations. The
 semantic distinctions between plans, programs, and
 outlines reflected the varying degree of firmness with
 which the leadership had come to view its prospects
 and goals over time.
 With the shelving of the 10-Year Plan at the
 December Plenum, the PRC leadership became much
 more concerned with the solution of short-term prob-
 lems and the establishment of a firm foundation for
 modernization than with the attainment of long-term
 production goals. Thus the three-year period 1979-81
 was to be a time of readjustment and preparation. In
 January 1979 Japanese newspapermen asked Hu
 Qiaomu, a senior theoretician and close associate of
 Deng Xiaoping, if concrete plans for modernization
 had been worked out. Hu replied that they had "no
 particular blueprint ... the goal we have set is to move
 forward step by step and continually gain experience."
 December 1978 constitutes a watershed in PRC
 history because of the large number of new policies and
 changes in old policies initiated at the Third Plenum.
 Changes in planning priorities were one of the more
 important results of the Plenum. The conferences of
 fall 1978, held to draw up economic planning proposals
 for consideration by the Plenum, apparently had
 recommended a shift of resources away from heavy
 industry and toward light industry and agriculture as
 well as a cut in the number of industrial capital
 construction projects. The Plenum accepted the pro-
 posal on raising the priority of agriculture and light
 industry; the proposed cutback in industrial projects
 apparently was not acted upon until two months later.
 On 24 February an authoritative People's Daily
 editorial suggested that investment in the steel indus-
 try should be reduced in the interest of more balanced
 development of other sectors, notably agriculture and
 light industry. This was followed in early March by
 Li Xiannian's admission that he and others in the
 leadership might have been "overhasty" and that some
 of the targets for 1985, steel in particular, were too
 high and ought to be scaled back.
 By the end of March, the proceedings of national
 capital construction and chemical industry conferences
 revealed that construction plans were to be "adjusted"
 through halting and postponing industrial projects. On
 24 March People's Daily, paraphrasing Lenin that
 "we go one step backward to go two steps forward
 later," admitted that construction plans had been too
 ambitious and that the process of deciding upon which
 projects would be stopped or postponed was under way.
 The decisions arrived at are still not entirely known
 and their impact has yet to be fully felt, mainly
 because both a number of central government minis-
 tries and provincial authorities continue to circumvent
 the cutback policies. In general, it appears that the
 steel, machine building, and chemical industries were
 to be most affected and that projects in the coal,
 electric power, petroleum, transportation, and building
 materials sectors were to be less affected. Agriculture
 and light industry and those projects which could be
 brought into production within a short time were to be
 developed rapidly. Housing, public utilities, scientific
 research, education, and health were also slated to
 receive additional attention. Beijing's explanation of
 the need for the cutback focused on such factors as
 insufficient supplies of power, construction materials,
 and skilled manpower and the initiation of construc-
 tion projects without paying sufficient attention either
 to where raw materials for the new plants would come
 from or to how their output would be used. People's
 Daily summed up the influence of these factors by
 noting that since the early 1960s the value of com-
 pleted capacity additions as a proportion of investment
 outlays had steadily fallen.
 The mid-February suspension of over $2 billion in
 contracts with Japan, coming at a time when the PRC
 was cutting back on construction plans, raised the
 possibility that the leadership was pulling back from
 China's new policy of developing increased linkages
 with the developed states. However, contracts with
 non-Japanese suppliers were not affected and the
 suspension was mainly attributable to such factors as
 PRC miscalculation of payment requirements, a con-
 sequent temporary shortage of foreign exchange, and
 Japanese reluctance to provide more favorable credit
 terms. The PRC subsequently lifted the suspension in
 May 1979; the net effect apparently was to further
 delay the timetable for the huge Baoshan iron and steel
 complex.
 The shift in policy course at the Third Plenum and the
 subsequent flux that has marked Chinese moderniza-
 tion policies primarily reflected the leadership's realis-
 tic appraisal of the dimensions of China's economic
 problems. Nevertheless, Deng and the leaders associ-
 ated with him also appear persuaded that the perma-
 nence of both their hold on political power and their
 policies for modernization had become contingent
 upon accomplishing two tasks. The first was neutraliz-
 ing those within the CCP who would slow the pace of
 change and, second, rapidly demonstrating that their
 programs were in the best interest of most of the
 Chinese population. Thus, the present thrust of PRC:
 policy for the short term, that is, the next two or three
 years, is fairly clear; that for the years beyond is much
 less so.
 Short-term Policy
 The fundamental premise of PRC economic policy
 since the Third CCP Plenum of December 1978 has
 been that consumer welfare, economic productivity,
 and political stability are indivisible. The premise was
 elaborated in detail at the Fifth National Peoples
 Congress (June 1979) and the leadership's strong
 commitment to it was evident during the Fourth
 Plenum of the CCP (September 1979) as well as in
 Vice Chairman Ye Jianying's 1 October speech
 commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding
 of the PRC. Throughout this period additional empha-
 sis has been given to raising personal income and
 consumption in rural and urban areas from the
 stationary per capita levels of the past decade and to
 providing the goods necessary to meet the new demand
 that will be generated by increased incomes. Thus
 production in the agricultural and light industrial
 sectors has been further stimulated both to provide
 increased goods for domestic consumption and for
 exports. (Agriculture and light industry account for
 almost two-thirds of PRC export earnings.) Since
 December the already high priority of agriculture in
 investment allocations has been further raised. New
 investment including imports of foreign technology,
 has also been planned for light industry which until
 December 1978 has been expected to expand produc-
 tion with little new investment. Striking changes in
 PRC policies concerning the incentives to produce, the
 systems of managing production and political activity
 in the economy have also occurred.
 In agriculture, for example, prices now paid by the
 state for farm produce have been raised and the
 quantities procured by the state on compulsory terms
 are to remain constant for five years. Prices paid by the
 peasant for such industrial inputs as fertilizer, pesti-
 cides, and farm machinery are also being lowered.
 Taxes on the income from rural industrial and
 commercial undertakings have been cut while the tax
 exempt periods for newly established rural enterprises
 have been lengthened. Production teams in low-
 yielding and grain deficient areas are to be exempted
 from agricultural taxes altogether. The primacy of
 production teams as the locus of economic decision-
 making has been strongly reaffirmed to give them
 wider latitude for planting the crops they grow best
 and thus enhancing their opportunities for increased
 incomes. Evidence so far received indicates that this
 last measure has led many teams to shift their cropping
 patterns away from grain crops and into cash crops-
 vegetables, tobacco, oilseeds, and the like. The govern-
 ment is supporting the trend toward establishing more
 rational cropping patterns by repudiating past policies
 of "onesidely" emphasizing grain production and by
 surveying agricultural growing areas in each province
 and designating specific zones for specialized crop
 production.
 Some of these measures will cut into state revenues and
 others will make food a more expensive commodity in
 the cities. The leadership is willing to accept the
 decline in state revenues that may result from raising
 farm procurement prices and lowering the prices of
 industrial goods sold to farmers even though it may
 make the provision of funds for investment more
 difficult. The Third Plenum had also noted, for the
 first time, that subsidies to offset increased urban food
 prices would be necessary. While state retail grain
 prices have not so far been raised, Beijing began giving
 subsidies to individual urban consumers to partially
 cover the cost of the November 1979 rise in state retail
 prices for meat, eggs, milk, and other "nonstaple"
 foods.
 Measures have also been taken to ensure that neither a
 poor harvest nor a decline in the flow of grain into the
 cities, as a result, for example, of the changes in crop
 patterns noted above, will seriously affect urban grain
 supplies in the near term. Thus over the past year
 China signed three-year (1979-81) grain agreements
 with Australia, Argentina, and Canada that will allow
 the PRC to import 6 million to 7 million tons of wheat
 and corn during each year of the agreements. Further,
 the PRC has said that it expects to import 5 million to
 6 million tons of grain annually from the United States
 over the next five years.
 Incentive policies in industry, transportation, and the
 services sector are evolving more slowly but neverthe-
 less in similar directions. A small wage increase was
 granted to about three-fifths of the urban labor force in
 1977, and on 1 November 1979 the government
 announced that further wage increases would be
 distributed to 40 percent of the urban work force on the
 basis of promotion for merit. Although an across-the-
 board wage increase and establishment of a system for
 regular promotions have periodically been discussed,
 the government has not so far implemented such
 measures. Rather, the leadership appears to be experi-
 menting with measures whereby remuneration is more
 closely tied to productivity; that is, piece rate wages,
 selective promotions on merit, and systems of rewards
 and bonuses for individuals and enterprises that meet
 and exceed production quotas.
 Since December the regime has experimented with a
 system under which enterprises that fulfill production
 quotas and contracts are allowed to keep an additional
 small percentage of profits normally turned into the
 state. These retained funds are to be used primarily for
 increasing collective welfare-such as housing and
 day-care centers-in the enterprises and secondarily to
 be used for bonuses to outstanding workers. Many of
 these measures have been in operation on a trial basis
 for only a short time and evidence so far received
 suggests that these changes are having mixed results.
 On the one hand, bonus systems have contributed to
 increased labor productivity in those enterprises where
 they accrue to individuals or small groups of workers.
 On the other hand, provision of cash awards to
 collective groups-for example, to all members of an
 enterprise-have admittedly been poorly received and
 have created discontent.
 In addition to specific incentives to producers, govern-
 ment policy currently continues to emphasize improve-
 ment in the quality of life in urban areas. Funds are
 being made available for construction of new housing
 and renovation of old living quarters. The improve-
 ment of urban services-public utilities, restaurants,
 retail sales outlets, household goods repair shops-is
 also being pushed, in part through encouraging the
 formation of new establishments and in part through
 allowing service entities to retain a larger portion of
 their revenues when they meet quality and perform-
 ance standards. The expansion of the services sector
 has the additional advantage of providing new jobs for
 those younger people in the cities who cannot be
 absorbed in industry.
 In addition to increasing incentives, Beijing's attempt
 to raise productivity also includes experimenting with
 changes in industrial organization and management in
 order to make the structure of production more
 efficient. These experiments include encouraging spe-
 cialization of production by factories to eliminate the
 wasteful tendency for factories to ensure their sources
 of supply by producing their own machinery and other
 input requirements. Corporate forms of industrial
 organization are also being tried. In these, government
 ministries and bureaus set overall policy and goals and
 their subordinate industrial and transportation corpo-
 rations are given the main responsibility for and
 control over the task of production. The regime seems
 particularly enamoured of the uses of legal contracts in
 these new systems. Within the framework of overall
 state-set goals, the contracts specify details of how and
 when goods are to be produced and delivered among
 supplying, producing, and marketing units and stipu-
 late financial penalties for nonfulfillment of contract
 provisions.
 New systems of management are also being intro-
 duced. Chief among these is the elimination of
 management by committees often composed of non-
 technical outsiders. In its place the old "single-head"
 system has been reinstituted in which technically
 qualified factory and enterprise directors are responsi-
 ble for day-to-day operation of plants and are only
 generally supervised by party authorities. At lower
 levels of plant operation, the regime has also continued
 to experiment with worker election of their workshop
 leaders, section chiefs, and shift foremen. Given
 prospects of greater rewards for increased productiv-
 ity, these groups presumably will elect individuals who
 are believed to be most competent to lead the work:
 effort.
 These changes in incentive and in management and
 organization policies are clearly based on assumptions
 that the productivity of both the Chinese labor force
 and of PRC industrial and agricultural capital is much
 lower than it should be. PRC discussions of industry
 have pointed out that in recent years the growth of the
 industrial labor force and the rates of addition to
 industrial capacity have been higher than the rate of
 increase in industrial output. Discussions of agricul-
 tural productivity similarly point to the fact that
 although supplies of industrial inputs to agriculture
 such as chemical fertilizer, tractors, and irrigation
 equipment have grown sharply in recent years, agricul-
 tural production has only barely exceeded population
 growth. Not enough information is available to inde-
 pendently test the truth of these propositions. The
 available material does suggest, however, that in the
 short run higher rates of production are possible for
 agriculture but improbable for Chinese industry.
 In agriculture, the rapid rise in supplies of chemical
 fertilizer, in stocks of powered irrigation equipment,
 and in the tractor park since 1970 apparently have not
 had great effect on agricultural production (figure 1).
 Poor growing conditions, particularly in 1976 and
 1977, have been a major factor in offsetting the
 influence of these inputs on production. Nevertheless,
 the high costs of such inputs relative to the low prices
 paid by the state for farm products, coupled with
 higher level strictures on the the use of inputs by
 production teams, have almost certainly meant these
 inputs have not been efficiently used. The current
 effort to remedy these disincentives is leading to more
 efficient use of these inputs; consequently, sustained if
 modest increases in production appear possible.
 On the other hand, there is little information that
 would bear out the Chinese contention that large
 amounts of unused capacity exist in industry. The
 leveling out of the rate of growth of industrial
 production since 1978 (figure 2) suggests that large
 increases in output are unlikely to be forthcoming over
 the next few years. Further, the Chinese quest for
 increased production through more efficient use of
 existing industrial capacity faces two major obstacles.
 The first is the experimental nature of new organiza-
 tional and management policies which so far have
 affected only parts of the industrial establishment. The
 second major obstacle is the resistance of the ponder-
 ous Chinese industrial bureaucracy to the innovative
 changes the central leadership is attempting to bring
 about. There is ample evidence that the staffs of
 industrial organs, from the ministry level down to
 individual industrial enterprises, resist these changes
 as profound and perhaps personally damaging depar-
 tures from longstanding ways of doing things.
 An important element in all these changes is the
 Chinese leadership's decision, formalized at the
 December plenum, to diminish the scope of CCP
 organizational involvement in factories and to limit the
 time available for political meetings and similar
 activity. The latter limitation comes under the so-
 called "five-sixths" rule under which scientists, techni-
 cians, and intellectuals, as well as factory hands, are
 - Agricultural Production
 .... Chemical Fertilizer Production
 Powered Irrigation Equipment Inventory
 - - Tractor Inventory
 supposed to devote five-sixth of their labor to their
 professions and/or production and only one-sixth to
 political meetings. The leadership clearly believes that
 cutting back political activity in the enterprises,
 coupled with the placing of responsibility for produc-
 tion on individuals under a system of rewards for
 success and penalties for failure, will lead to better use
 of existing PRC plant and labor. The quest for greater
 efficiency has been underlined by publicizing the
 removal of inept managers, the suspension of produc-
 tion in individual plants, and the permanent closure of
 still other plants for failure to meet production goals,
 for turning out below-standard products, and for
 excessive consumption of energy and raw materials.
 During 1.979 Beijing also bolstered the emphasis on
 increased productivity and efficiency by restoring the
 banking system to its traditional role as a major
 economic control and auditing arm of the central
 government. Supervision of factory financial matters
 by the People's Bank, which handles the revenue and
 expenditure of enterprises and provides loans for
 working capital, has been tightened up. The Bank's
 financial powers are already being used to withhold
 loans from inefficient producers and to rectify abuses
 of the incentive system by refusing to release funds for
 bonuses judged to be excessive. The central govern-
 ment has also moved to ensure that state funds for
 agriculture and for capital investment are more
 productively used by reestablishing the Agricultural
 Bank (abolished in 1965) and by strengthening the
 operations of the Construction Bank. The funding of
 investment through the Construction Bank is being
 changed from the old system of outright grants of
 construction funds for projects to a system where the
 Construction Bank judges the wisdom of proposed
 projects, monitors their progress, and extends funds as
 loans with interest charges which must be repaid.
 Short-term Prospects. The economic policies pursued
 by the Chinese leadership since the December plenum
 constitute an unparalleled appeal to the individual
 interest of the Chinese people. Even though these
 policies have only begun to take hold they are already
 engendering new problems for the regime. In agricul-
 ture, for example, the strengthening of the decision-
 making power of the production teams has periodically
 led to disbandment of the teams in a few areas and a
 division of collectively owned farm tools and farm
 lands among individual farmers. The government has
 moved quickly to eliminate these isolated reversions to
 household farming-which prevailed prior to the 11955
 cooperativization of agriculture-by reasserting pro-
 duction team and brigade authority over such activity.
 The regime similarly is finding that production team
 decisions on what they plant do not always accord with
 state cropping and procurement plans, particularly for
 the important cotton crop. The government is also
 having trouble controlling the operations of rural free
 markets, or village fairs, where both agricultural
 products and consumer goods are traded at market
 rather than state-set prices. Strong demand and higher
 prices in these markets periodically divert goods away
 from state procurement and distribution channels.
 Aside from the use of the banking system to stop the
 "reckless" award of bonuses in excess of gains in
 industrial productivity, the government has also found
 that the additional leeway given to factory managers
 and enterprises is stimulating "unsocialist" activities
 that undercut the state material allocation and distri-
 bution systems. New restrictions have been placed on
 the operations of small, illegal factories and suppliers
 that are often able to provide needed goods more
 quickly to enterprises than is the cumbersome state
 supply system.
 The leadership has moved promptly to keep these
 activities within bounds and probably will continue to
 be able to limit their economic consequences. Never-
 theless, some of these departures from past practices
 provide an opening for those unhappy about the
 pragmatic cast of present policy to criticize the
 leadership. Sensitivity to this issue has been amply
 documented by the continuing series of "study ses-
 sions" conducted throughout the party and the PLA
 (People's Liberation Army) to defend the correctness
 of the economic policies adopted at the Third Plenum.
 Rising consumer expectations now are a problem of the
 first magnitude for the government. Notwithstanding
 repeated insistence that consumer welfare can be
 improved only gradually and should be preceded by
 increased productivity, the new policies have stimu-
 lated long-suppressed popular demand for more and
 higher quality food, clothing, housing, and consumer
 durables. One indication of the strength of this demand
 is that despite low interest rates urban and rural bank
 savings have steadily risen over the past two decades.
 The size of these deposits is unknown, but they are
 clearly large enough to have become a serious concern
 for the government. On 22 March the PRC abandoned
 the old system of a uniform annual interest rate of
 3.2 percent for fixed deposits regardless of term and
 installed a system of six-month, one-, three-, and five-
 year time deposits. Interest rates on all deposits were
 also increased from 3.6 percent (for six-month depos-
 its) to 5 percent (for five-year deposits). In addition to
 inhibiting the withdrawal of funds from these ac-
 counts, the higher interest rates are also intended to
 attract more of the increased money income that is
 beginning to be received by the population.
 Other indications of the force of consumer expecta-
 tions are reflected in disapproving press comment on
 greater worker concern for their "lifestyles" than with
 production and on conspicuous consumption of food
 and drink. A number of observers have noted the
 gradual shift in the dress of the urban population from
 the uniform drabness of the past to varied styles and
 better quality clothing. Still others note the avid
 interest of many urban consumers in acquiring wrist-
 watches, bicycles, and televisions, often through
 "backdoor" or black market transactions.
 Meeting this demand will be an acute problem for at
 least the next several years. Industrial production
 began to slow in 1979 as the economy emerged from
 the recovery of 1977-78. The new incentives policies
 and more efficient organizational and management
 measures have not been in place long enough to have
 had much effect on industrial output. While these
 policies may indeed lead to some increases in output
 over the next few years, they will only partially remedy
 the more fundamental problems of industry. These are
 the constraints associated with past periods of Chinese
 industrial expansion-shortages of coal and raw mate-
 rials, overburdened transportation systems, and insuf-
 ficient electric power-which are the outgrowth of past
 investment decisions. During 1979 the government has
 increased investment in these troubled sectors, particu-
 larly in energy and transportation. Nevertheless,
 construction of new capacity in these areas will take
 between three and five years to accomplish. Thus, a
 significant loosening of these constraints in the short
 term is not in the offing.
 In addition to generating increased output in the short
 run from essentially fixed industrial capacity, the
 leadership faces a serious problem in adjusting the mix
 of industrial output, primarily in the area of consumer
 goods production. The PRC set the 1979 target for
 growth in the value of industrial production at 8
 percent. In a striking departure from past practice, the
 target for heavy industry (7.6 percent) was planned to
 be less than that for light industry (8.3 percent). At
 yearend the PRC announced that the total industrial
 output target had been met, that heavy industrial
 output had increased by 7.4 percent, and that the light
 industrial target had been overfulfilled, with output
 increasing by 9 percent. However, Beijing also ad-
 mitted, in several December 1979 discussions, that the
 increase in the supply of consumer goods still fell far
 short of the increased demand for such goods gener-
 ated by higher incomes in both urban and rural areas.
 Moreover, examination of components of light indus-
 trial production suggests that the annual target had
 been met more through increased production of such
 high value commodities as TV sets, sewing machines,
 and bicycles than through production of such basic and
 lower value goods as clothing, soap, and household
 furnishings.
 Further, the production of consumer goods still is not
 oriented to popular wants nor is it of acceptable
 quality. As in the past, a question remains as to how
 much of this production actually is sold and how much
 accumulates in warehouse stocks. This problem
 underlies continued government attempts-through
 encouraging improved market research by and the use
 of contracts between producers and marketers of
 consumer goods-to ease this situation. This is a new
 and exceedingly complicated management problem for
 both the government and industrial producers. Thus,
 progress has been slow and their efforts will not quickly
 meet the expectations of Chinese consumers.
 Nevertheless, the attempt to meet rising consumer
 expectations quickly, albeit only partially, and to
 increase export earnings got off to a good start in 1979,
 in the main because of improved agricultural perform-
 ance. Foodstuffs account for about one-half of con-
 sumer expenditures in the PRC and a large share of the
 raw materials used in light industry come from
 agriculture. Another record harvest of grain (over
 315 million tons) and respectable increases in most
 nongrain crops, except cotton, are allowing almost
 immediate increases in food consumption and provide
 the basis for increased output of consumer goods in
 1980. The leadership should be able to cite both
 concrete improvements in consumer welfare and an
 expanded capability for paying for imports in defend-
 ing the correctness of its policies.
 The relative political stability that has prevailed since
 the fall of the Gang of Four in 1976 has immensely
 facilitated the leadership's attempt to grapple with
 these complex problems of demand and supply. The
 regime can demonstrate initial results from the first
 year of these short-term policies and serious threats to
 political stability have, for the moment, diminished.
 However, the leadership also recognizes that more
 time will be needed for the new policies to take hold
 than was originally expected at the time of the Third
 Plenum. Deng Xiaoping has been reported in the press
 as having told a group of overseas Chinese in Septem-
 ber and the president of Asahi Shimbun in October,
 that the "readjustment" period might be prolonged.
 As for the pattern of growth over the next few years,
 we suspect that GNP will fall off from the annual
 6 percent rates of the past to around 5 percent.
 Moreover, the sources of growth will also change with
 industrial growth slowing, perhaps to around 6 to 7
 percent per year, and agricultural growth picking up
 significantly to something on the order of 4 to 5 percent
 per year. While foreign equipment and technology will
 continue to flow into the PRC at higher rates than in
 the past mainly because of China's $7 billion worth of
 purchases in 1978, deep-seated problems in absorbing
 such imports will be ameliorated only slowly. Absorp-
 tion problems coupled with the general cutback in
 investment plans are largely responsible for the sharp
 drop in China's whole plant purchases in 1979 to $1
 billion. With the exception of imported chemical
 fertilizer plants, foreign technology is unlikely to have
 much of an impact on production during this period.
 Meeting the expectations stimulated by the new policy
 course will remain a constant and major concern for
 the leadership. Failure would increase popular discon-
 tent, with consequent adverse effects on productivity,
 and would make wholehearted participation in the
 modernization effort even more difficult to achieve.
 More important is the impact of failure within the
 CCP. Apparently large numbers of CCP rank-and-file
 cadres continue to have little enthusiasm for imple-
 menting policies that sharply differ from their past
 experience. These may become even less responsive to
 central direction than they now are. Moreover, if these
 policies do not succeed, the ability of those within the
 party who resist the pragmatic cast of current policy to
 challenge the dominant leadership will be greatly
 strengthened.
 The outcome of these short-term policies cannot be
 predicted with assurance. On balance, the odds favor
 their success because they embody an unprecedertedly
 rational approach to China's economic problems.
 Compared with the Maoist era, the present leadership
 appears to be much less bound by ideological con-
 straints in its policy choices and more thorough in
 thinking through the probable outcomes of new
 policies, and is clearly able to react quickly to the new
 problems that arise. Moreover, this rational approach
 is also manifest in their treatment of longer term
 development policies. Even though these policies do not
 have direct and immediate impact on the Chinese
 economic process, they complement the operation of
 shorter term policies and are crucial for the overall
 modernization effort.
 The Fifth Modernization
 The present emphasis upon readjustment and the flux
 in long-term economic planning obscures measures
 being taken by the leadership to bring about a fifth
 modernization-providing the political and social pre-
 requisites for economic modernization. New impetus
 was given to this effort by the consolidation of political
 power in the hands of Deng Xiaoping and his
 associates at the Third Plenum of the CCP in
 December 1978. Since the Plenum this effort has
 centered on four major tasks: reshaping and strength-
 ening the Chinese Communist Party as the fundamen-
 tal instrument of political power, attempting to estab-
 lish some semblance of the rule of law within society,
 continuing to upgrade the Chinese educational system,
 and intensifying programs for slowing population
 growth.
 The Party and the Maoist Legacy. Reshaping and
 strengthening the CCP is aimed at making party
 organizations and members more responsive to direc-
 tion from the central leadership and at narrowing the
 scope of party operations within society. Most of the
 weaknesses in the CCP are the direct result of actions
 initiated or condoned by Mao Zedong between the
 Cultural Revolution of 1966-67 and his death in 1976.
 The events of these years debilitated the party
 organization and demoralized most of its older mem-
 bers. In 1967 the CCP apparatus was incapacitated by
 the Red Guard movement to the point where the PLA
 had to be used to restore order. Party affairs were
 thereafter dominated by Mao's sycophant Lin Biao
 until Lin's death in 1971; subsequently the party's
 effectiveness as the instrument of rule was further
 diminished by the factionalism that marked the era of
 the Gang of Four and the struggle for the succession to
 Mao.
 During this period, party membership roughly doubled
 from the 17 million members of 1967 to more than 37
 million in 1978. An unknown but clearly significant
 number of these entered the party without going
 through the established system of personal recommen-
 dation by CCP members, probationary periods, and
 review of qualifications by party organizations at the
 next higher level. For as much as half of the current
 CCP membership, mass movements, inner-party fac-
 tionalism, and freedom to operate with a minimum of
 control from above have been the accepted norms of
 party work. For Deng Xiaoping and his colleagues the
 party organization is a poorly disciplined instrument
 containing a sizable segment of cadres who either do
 not understand or who disagree with many of the new
 policies introduced by the leadership. Further, to the
 degree that both these newer members and the older,
 pre-Cultural Revolution generation of members are
 wedded to Maoist ways, they constitute a potential
 reservoir of support for any higher level leader
 attempting to reverse Deng's policies.
 Measures to remedy these problems were undertaken
 at or soon after the Third Plenum in December 1978.
 Deng Xiaoping's control over the central organs of the
 party was strengthened by the appointment of his
 protege, Hu Yaobang, as Secretary General of the
 party and the naming of another long-time associate,
 Song Renqiung, as head of the Organization Depart-
 ment of the CCP, the organ responsible for personnel
 assignments. Reestablishment of the party's Commis-
 sion for Inspecting Discipline by the Plenum also
 underlined the leadership's strong interest in seeking
 out and punishing violators of party rules and regula-
 tions. Additional weight was given to the Commission
 by the appointment of senior party figure Chen Yon to
 head the Commission. Chen, who was restored to his
 position as vice-chairman of the party and member of
 the standing committee of the Politburo at the Plenum,
 was a major figure in the party rectification movement
 of 1942-44 and is the leader most closely associated
 with the pragmatic economic policies of the First Five-
 Year Plan period and the early 1960s. The Commis-
 sion has not so far been used to undertake "rectifica-
 tion" of the party membership by purge and indoctri-
 nation on the scale of the 1942-44 campaign.
 Nevertheless, since May 1979 a low-key rectification
 campaign has been under way featuring increased
 attempts by Discipline Inspection Commissions at
 ferreting out past and current violations of party rules
 1979. A People's Daily editorial of 5 November
 revealed that local authorities still had not complied
 with the April 1979 orders to suspend or defer
 uneconomic and impractical capital construction
 projects. A 23 November People's Daily article singled
 out this noncompliance with central directives as a
 major contributing factor to the "slow progress" of
 readjustment. Subsequently, several People's Daily
 articles explicitly called for "obedience" to Central
 Committee decisions and implied that strong sanctions
 would be imposed if such obedience were not
 forthcoming.
 In addition to attempting to make the CCP member-
 ship a more responsive and efficient vehicle for
 implementing the policies of the center, the leadership
 is also attempting to direct CCP activity into lines that
 will facilitate economic modernization. In line with the
 Plenum's announcement that the work of the party had
 been shifted from political struggle to economic
 modernization, CCP political work has been cut back
 from past levels and its content has been changed to
 emphasize economic productivity and reliance on
 material incentives. Similarly, the dispatch of CCP
 "work teams" from higher levels down into factories
 and farms both to conduct political campaigns and to
 exhort workers to greater effort, has also been cut
 back. This hallmark of the Maoist era has been pushed
 aside on grounds that the burden of feeding and
 housing these groups at the working level is too heavy,
 that they tend to disrupt rather than stimulate
 production, and that they undercut the authority of
 local CCP cadres at the working levels.
 and a strengthening of Organization Department work In restricting those party activities that have proven
 in CCP organs. These organizational measures have counterproductive in the past, the Dengist leadership

 decade as party committees at every level became the
 The problem of the refusal of lower level organs to sole organs for making decisions on all questions no
 comply with Central Committee directives was strik- matter how small. In effect, the party has become a
 ingly illustrated in November and early December source of bottlenecks that stifle innovation and initia-
 tive in political and economic work.
 Preliminary steps toward breaking this bottleneck are
 evidenced in the prominence now being given to
 nonparty organs-people's government organs at pro-
 vincial, municipal, perfectural, and county levels-in
 the governing process and the concurrent trend toward
 playing down the role of CCP secretaries and commit-
 tees in the operations of these organs. In some areas,
 provincial party committees have also begun to dis-
 band or reduce the staffs of party bureaus and sections,
 transferring many of their functions back to govern-
 ment organs.
 How far this process, which is analogous to the
 experiments with "one-head" management in indus-
 try, will go is not yet clear. However, the damages
 brought by excessive party interference in economic
 and other matters in the past plus the immensity of the
 task of governing 1 billion people and managing an
 increasingly complex economy may be leading the
 leadership toward a system that may eventually
 resemble that of the Soviet Union; that is, the
 development of a separate and equally ponderous
 government bureaucracy alongside that of the party.
 In such a system, clearer distinctions should begin to
 appear between party members whose main occupa-
 tion is party work-the apparatchiks-and those who,
 while they are party members, are specialists in
 government and economic organs. The current effort
 and attendant publicity on the recruiting of scientists
 and technicians into the CCP may be a precursor of
 this trend as well as the attempt to enlarge the
 proportion of general administrative and specialist
 cadres "of all trades and professions" within the party.
 In an environment in which economic modernization is
 the paramount objective, a government bureaucracy
 staffed by technocrats may eventually become a more
 important factor in Chinese politics than heretofore
 has been the case.
 Lastly, the attempt to make the CCP a more efficient
 instrument for modernization also includes exposing
 party members at all levels to the contrast between
 China's backwardness and the advances made in the
 industrialized world. In addition to the travels of the
 top leaders themselves, including Hun Guofeng and
 Deng, large numbers of provincial party figures have
 traveled to the developed world as part of PRC
 delegations. Many of these officials have subsequently
 convened provincial forums to present their observa-
 tions and conclusions. A number of provinces and
 municipalities have also held conferences of party and
 nonparty figures to hear the experiences and sugges-
 tions of scientific and technical personnel who have
 also gone abroad as members of various Chinese fact-
 finding and negotiating teams. Members of the CCP in
 urban areas are being exhorted to study and attend
 courses intended to help them understand science,
 technology, management, economics, and foreign lan-
 guages. In rural areas, similar efforts are under way to
 educate party cadres in scientific farm management.
 The magnitude of the problem of educating the rural
 party rank and file may be particularly difficult if
 conditions in the countryside are similar to those in one
 county of Guizhou Province. In this county more than
 half of the party branch secretaries at the brigade level
 are illiterate and only one-third of commune and
 brigade party cadres have enough arithmetic to
 balance farm accounts.
 In many respects, PRC chances for accomplishing the
 "four modernizations" over the long run pivot on the
 success of the leadership in remolding the CCP. For
 the moment, Deng Xiaoping and his colleagues seem
 secure from challenges to their leadership from within
 the top levels of the party. Nevertheless, the tasks of
 expunging Maoist work styles and the "lingering
 fears" of many cadres that present policies may be
 abruptly changed as well as the tasks of disciplining
 and educating the party membership to the point
 where they can intelligently carry out policies for
 modernization are difficult and will not be accom-
 plished overnight. If the party as the supreme political
 institution and as the main instrument of policy cannot
 be modernized along these lines, the prospects for
 accelerating modernization of Chinese society in
 general and the economy in particular are not
 promising.
 The Rule of Law. The instability and disorder of
 Chinese party affairs over the past decade has clearly
 had its counterpart in society in general. If only a
 fraction of the voluminous reporting of past injustices
 suffered by the Chinese population are true, then the
 relationship between the rulers and the ruled must
 have reached a new nadir at the time of Mao Zedong's
 death in 1976. Increased incidence of crime, cadre
 corruption, arbitrary arrest and expropriation of per-
 sonal property, and capricious official actions in civil
 and criminal cases all apparently contributed to a
 general deterioration in the quality of life in the PRC.
 The primitive state of Chinese legal codes and legal
 institutions and their consistent subordination since
 1949 to the dictatorial authority of the CCP did little
 to mitigate the situation.
 For the Dengist leadership, restoration of some sem-
 blance of law and order is important to the moderniza-
 tion process. First, the use of law to provide an orderly
 and more secure environment for the population is a
 fundamental requirement for evoking popular response
 and support for the modernization effort. New laws,
 and institutions to enforce them, are needed if the
 leadership's new economic policies particularly regard-
 ing foreign investment and business operations in
 China and the use of contracts in domestic economic
 activity are to be effective.
 Although a new constitution was promulgated in
 March 1978, the PRC's second in three years, little
 progress was made in developing new legal institutions
 and legal codes until after the December 1978 Plenum
 of the CCP. On the institutional side, staffing of the
 revivified people's procuratorial organs and the system
 of people's courts picked up momentum in 1979. The
 functions of these organs are to limit the powers of
 police and security organs regarding investigation and
 arrest and to ensure an orderly and fairer disposition of
 criminal and civil cases. Movement in this area has
 been slow in part because many of the PRC's small
 number of trained lawyers have been forced into other
 occupations over the past decade and, in part, because
 legal work is not viewed as a desirable occupation. This
 As for new laws, the main achievements appear to be
 the promulgation of a joint Chinese-foreign investment
 law, a criminal law, a criminal procedures law, and
 organic laws for the people's courts and procu-
 ratorates, which came into effect on 1 January 1980.
 These laws, coupled with the reactivation of procura-
 torial and court systems, are intended to promote order
 and stability within society by providing at least a
 rudimentary assurance to the population that enforce-
 ment of the law will be more equitable than in the past.
 Only preliminary work has been undertaken on mak-
 ing other aspects of the Chinese legal system more
 supportive of the modernization effort. An eight-year
 plan (1978-85) for the study of law was adopted at a
 national legal conference in March 1978. While this
 plan covers research into every facet of law, its focus on
 completing legal studies and compiling textbooks and
 dictionaries of legal terms implies that the process of
 modernizing law is only beginning.
 In the meantime, the lack of progress in revamping
 systems of Chinese business law remains a con-
 straining factor in modernizing the economy. The
 concern of foreign businessmen for protecting patents
 covering equipment and processes shipped into China
 has not been allayed by PRC assurances that a new
 patent law will be forthcoming in the near future. The
 new joint venture law has only partially facilitated
 PRC overtures to foreign firms for new investment.
 These efforts continue to be hampered by vagueness in
 Chinese terms regarding ownership, taxation, and the
 means of remitting profits from such investment out of
 the country.
 Domestically, the regime's experiments with using a
 system of contracts between producers, distributors,
 and consumers to ensure efficient provision of goods
 last difficulty arises mainly from the past vulnerability and services are unlikely to be effective in the absence
 of workers in the legal system to political attack and to of some overall system of contract law. The questions
 charges of "rightism." In at least one province,
 Heilongjiang, the absence of court buildings and
 inadequate funding is also holding back the formation
 of legal organs. In addition, the process of setting up
 these organs is also being slowed by the reluctance of
 party committees to loosen the dominance over legal
 matters they have maintained over the past 10 years.
 of how the terms of such contracts will be drawn up,
 how disputes over contract provisions will be adjudi-
 cated, and who will levy penalties for nonfulfillment
 have been under continuing discussion within China.
 In early 1980, the President of the Supreme Court,
 Jiang Hua, noted that "economic divisions" had been
 established at higher court levels and that similar
 organs would be set up under lower courts throughout
 China. These "economic divisions" apparently are
 similar to the courts for economic cases set up in the
 city of Tianjin in late 1979. In addition to handling
 violations of pollution regulations and prosecuting
 assorted economic crimes, Tianjin's economic courts
 also hear cases of nonfulfillment of contracts. The
 courts, however, will hear such cases only when
 contract disputes cannot be successfully arbitrated
 within and among the government hierarchies having
 interest in the issues. This implies that putting the new
 system of contracts into effect will be a slow and
 cumbersome process. Such a process will negate much
 of the new efficiency which the contract system is
 supposed to bring to PRC production processes.
 The Dengist leadership faces several problems in
 attempting to establish systems of law and order akin
 to those that are part of the fabric of the developed
 world. The grafting of essentially western legal
 concepts and institutions on traditional Chinese society
 is a task that has frustrated Chinese reformers for over
 a century. The Chinese preference for settling disputes
 through private arrangement of differences between
 the parties concerned rather than through public
 adjudication by outside authorities remains strong in
 the PRC. The task is also made more difficult for the
 present leadership because the bulk of Western legal
 tradition is based on concepts of personal equality
 before the law and representative democracy which are
 unknown under a Communist political system. The
 PRC appears to be slowly developing a system that
 incorporates many of the characteristics of Western
 legal systems but one in which the CCP remains the
 supreme arbiter of justice. Even small progress in this
 area will be useful to the leadership in enlisting the
 support of the population, in encouraging the flow of
 foreign resources into the PRC, and in installing more
 modern systems of economic management.
 Educational Policy. The crucial role of education in
 facilitating both the absorption of modern science and
 technology and the broader task of bringing modernity
 to a backward rural society has been a consistent
 concern of the Chinese leadership since the fall of the
 Gang of Four in late 1976. While educational policy
 has been focused primarily on remedying the effects of
 the 10-year hiatus in formal education and replenish-
 ing the supply of trained scientists and technicians, the
 Dengist leadership has also given important attention
 to the long-term effort to raise urban and rural
 education levels in general. In working out policies of
 readjustment and scaling back some of its more
 ambitious economic plans since the December Plenum,
 the leadership has so far continued to emphasize
 education in the modernization effort.
 One step in the process of developing education was the
 January 1979 decision to expand institutions of higher
 learning by almost 30 percent. This decision gave the
 go-ahead to provincial and municipal authorities to
 establish 153 new institutes and colleges and to reopen
 16 that had not functioned for some years. The
 categories of school envisaged reflect the push for more
 trained scientists and technicians-46 schools of engi-
 neering, 18 medical schools, 13 schools specializing in
 agriculture, forestry, veterinary medicine and meteor-
 ology, and 10 economics and financial institutes.
 Moreover, the list also reflected a strong commitment
 to overall improvement of the educational system by
 establishing 77 new teachers colleges to meet the needs
 of secondary education.
 These 169 new schools will constitute a third track in
 the PRC system of higher education and as such their
 development will be slow. At present the 88 "key
 universities"-model schools that train the best stu-
 dents, have the best teachers, and set standards for
 first-rate academic work-receive the highest priority
 in allocations of resources to higher education. The
 remaining 500 existing universities and colleges appear
 to have a lower priority. In these schools insufficient
 numbers of qualified teachers, shortages of school
 buildings, and inadequate supplies of books and
 equipment are particularly acute problems. The needs
 of existing schools almost certainly will mean that the
 new "third track" schools will come into being only
 slowly and will not be able to provide quality education
 for many years to come.
 Nevertheless the decision to establish these schools is a
 strong indication of leadership interest in preparing the
 ground for modernization and will eventually help to
 place the increasing numbers of middle school gradu-
 ates who would otherwise have no opportunity for
 further education. This past fall the PRC was able to
 enroll less than 1 million of 7 million 1979 middle
 school graduates. The potentially disruptive problems
 of disaffected and partially educated youth are not
 limited to the 6 million who did not gain entry into
 college this past year. An unknown but clearly large
 number of older candidates-those who could not
 enter during the period when university-level educa-
 tion was suspended or whose training in politicized
 middle schools is weak, as well as those who have been
 in rural areas as part of the "down to the countryside
 movement"-also remain frustrated by their lack of
 access to higher education. The leadership has ad-
 mitted that there are no acceptable short-term reme-
 dies for this problem. However, a concerted effort is
 being made to steer those who will not be accepted by
 the college system into vocational schools and into jobs
 in factories and agriculture where their education can
 at least partially be continued through correspondence
 courses and other forms of spare-time education.
 The universal emphasis upon China's backwardness
 and the need for all to learn more modern ways is not
 narrowly limited to training a new generation of
 scientists and technicians. Correspondence courses,
 short full-time training programs, lecture series, and
 TV and radio courses for workers, industrial and
 commercial cadres, and secondary school teachers
 have proliferated over the past year. A host of subjects
 is covered: simple arithmetic and reading, principles of
 chemistry and physics, international affairs, industrial
 management techniques, and English and Japanese
 language courses. At a more general level, provincial
 and municipal radio broadcasting schedules continue
 to be changed to include more programing on cultural,
 artistic, and historical matters as well as on scientific
 and technical subjects. Similar liberalizing patterns
 are also apparent in book publishing and in the
 resurrection or introduction of new academic and more
 general periodicals. These policies and programs pri-
 marily affect urban areas. Nevertheless, parallel ef-
 forts are under way in rural areas, mainly through
 upgrading primary and secondary schools and provid-
 ing rotational training courses for rural cadres and
 spare-time education for peasants. Illiteracy-Beijing
 recently noted that almost 100 million peasants are in
 this category-and the high rate of school dropouts
 have been singled out as particularly serious problems
 in rural areas.
 In all these areas, as in the formal school system itself,
 the time and other resources devoted to political and
 ideological matters has been reduced to the point
 where the central leadership has recently been forced
 to reassert the virtue and necessity of political study
 and correct ideological content in educational and
 cultural matters. The impressive aspect of these
 policies is that while the recent tightening of ideologi-
 cal standards and the reallocation of scarce resources
 have apparently slowed the liberalization of cultural
 life and the expansion of the educational system, the
 leadership has not abandoned the effort.
 The perils of these policies are well understood by the
 leadership. Containing the dissatisfaction generated by
 large numbers of young people whose newly whetted
 appetites for higher education cannot be appeased will
 be a recurrent problem for years to come. Moreover,
 other problems will arise because these policies run
 directly counter to fundamental Maoist tenets. Most of
 the Maoist commitment to preventing the emergence
 of a managerial-bureaucratic elite and to minimizing
 the differences between intellectuals and factory labor,
 between workers and peasants, and between the urban
 and rural segments of society will gradually be eroded
 by these policies. Like the parallel effort with incen-
 tives policies, unless managed carefully the growth of
 these differentials will lead to the formation of
 disaffected groups who provide a latent source for
 political manipulation and consequent instability.
 Since both their policies for modernizing China and
 the maintenance of their political positions depend
 upon minimizing instability, Deng Xiaoping and his
 colleagues are likely to remain highly sensitive to these
 problems.
 Population Control. Policies aimed at eventual casing
 of the pressure of population growth on China's limited
 resources have been reaffirmed and reinforced by the
 leadership since the December 1978 Plenum of the
 CCP. After sporadic efforts to promote birth control in
 the 1950s and 1960s, the PRC adopted a more open
 and forceful approach to the problem in 1973. Despite
 setbacks attributed to the succession struggles of 1976,
 between 1973 and 1978 more coercive policies appear
 to have led to a one-third drop in the rate of population
 growth, from 2.3 percent in 1973 to 1.5 percent in
 1978' Evidence of the leadership's strong interest in
 further decreasing population growth rates was pro-
 vided by the inclusion of government advocacy of
 family planning in article 53 of the new PRC
 Constitution of March 1978 and Chairman Hua
 Guofeng's call in the same month for reduction of the
 growth rate to less than 1 percent by 1980.
 The Third Plenum further raised the priority of family
 planning by formally approving measures decided
 upon in late 1978. The most important of these
 measures appears to have been the imposition of a new
 system of economic rewards and penalties aimed. at
 cutting the birth rate. The system promotes the
 standard of one child per couple as ideal, permits two
 children per couple and penalizes couples who produce
 three or more children.
 Under trial regulations put into effect by various
 provinces and municipalities during 1979, rewards for
 ""one child" families are to take the form of child care
 allowances paid to the parents until age 16 and waiving
 of charges in child care centers and miscellaneous
 school fees for such children. These couples are also to
 be given preference in obtaining housing and in the
 allocation of private plots in rural areas. The tradi-
 tional Chinese belief that security in retirement is
 guaranteed by a large number of children is also
 addressed in these regulations. Retired "one child"
 couples are supposed to be given augmented retirement
 pensions.
 Penalties for couples bearing three or more children
 include docking of the wages or work points of each
 parent by, in the case of Shanghai, 10 percent for each
 child born beyond two until such children reach age 16.
 Such multiple child families also are to be denied
 additional housing and expanded private plots when
 these become available. Expenditures for the rewards
 program are to be paid by the welfare funds of the
 place of employment or local authorities and revenue
 from the penalty system is to go into such welfare
 funds.
 ' A detailed appraisal of population policies and the problems of
 measuring population growth in the PRC is contained in J. S. Aird,
 "Population Growth in the People's Republic of China," Joint
 Economic Committee of Congress, Chinese Economy Post-M'ao,
 9 November 1978, pp. 439-475.
 Other provisions of the program are the prohibition of
 marriage to college-level students and to workers
 during their apprenticeship periods on pain of expul-
 sion. Rewards, in the form of cash and time off from
 the job, are also provided for married couples who
 undergo sterilization.
 The new measures to reduce population growth are
 driven by Beijing's recognition that the demographic
 factors favoring significant increases in growth
 rates have become stronger. The number of women in
 the child-bearing ages began to rise sharply in the
 1970s and this trend will continue through the 1980s
 (figure 3). In addition to using economic coercion to
 prevent a potentially rapid rise in the birth rate, the
 regime is also giving unprecedented publicity to the
 burdens population growth place on food supplies, job
 opportunities, educational facilities, and housing.
 Similarly, the costs to both parents and the state of
 bringing up and educating children is also receiving
 more emphasis.
 The obstacles facing the leadership in ameliorating
 China's most fundamental problem are sizable but not
 insurmountable. Success in curbing population growth
 pivots on eliminating resistance to planned parenthood
 in the rural areas. Part of this resistance is grounded in
 economic factors; for example, grain distribution is
 largely determined by the size of family. Firm imple-
 mentation of the new system of economic rewards and
 penalties-in particular, the docking of work points for
 multiple children families in rural areas-could meas-
 urably diminish the economic incentives for large
 families. Changing traditional rural values, for exam-
 ple, the strong preference for male children both to
 augment family labor power and for support in old age,
 will be a much slower process. Improved educational
 levels and the growth of closer cultural and economic
 links between rural and urban areas-all embodied in
 or implied by many of the regime's new policies of
 modernization-are likely to facilitate this process.
 Nevertheless, both the implementation of the "one
 child" program and the effort to change the traditional
 Chinese attitudes toward family limitation depend for
 their success upon the thoroughness and persistence
 with which party and government cadres prosecute

 them. Half-hearted application by lower level cadres of
 these often unpopular policies has hampered the effort
 in the past. Whether this continues depends upon how
 successful the leadership is in the task of making the
 CCP a more responsive instrument of central control.
 At present, cadres are being exhorted to become
 "models" in family planning and instances where
 cadres themselves have been prime violators of these
 policies are being given publicity as "negative
 examples" for the rest of society.
 Some years must pass before the impact of these new
 measures for slowing population growth becomes
 apparent. In any case, there is almost no chance that
 the PRC will be able to meet the announced goal of
 reducing population growth rates to 1 percent this year
 and to half of 1 percent by 1985. Current estimates
 suggest that the rate will not fall to the 1-percent level
 until late in this decade. Nevertheless, the evidence
 suggests that the current leadership is committed to
 diminishing the hazard that continued population
 growth poses to eventual economic modernization.
 All of these tasks, summed up above under the rubric
 of the "fifth" modernization, are fundamental ele-
 ments in creating the political, social, and cultural
 infrastructure required for sustained economic mod-
 ernization and growth. Perhaps the best illustration of
 Chinese understanding of the close relationship be-
 tween all five "modernizations" is contained in
 Ye Jianying's 30th anniversary speech of September
 1979:
 By the four modernizations we mean the four major
 aspects of modernization and not that modernizing
 is confined to thesefour aspects. Along with the
 reform and improvement of the socialist economic
 system, we will reform and improve the socialist
 political system and develop a complete socialist
 legal system. While building an advanced material
 civilization we want to raise the educational, cul-
 tural, and health levels of the whole nation ...
 and thus build an advanced socialist civilization.
 These are important objectives as well as necessary
 conditions for the realization of thefour moderniza-
 tions. [Emphasis supplied.]
 Nonetheless, these problems are not susceptible to
 quick or easy solutions. Years of consistent and patient
 effort by this leadership and its successors will be
 required before these elements begin to reinforce,
 rather than hamper, Chinese economic growth.
 The Shape of Economic Policy, 1982 and Beyond
 The experiences of the past two years appear to have
 given the Chinese leaders a much greater appreciation
 of the profound changes in political institutions, social
 conditions, and cultural life required for economic
 modernization. At least for the moment, there is also
 an awareness that neither hortatory campaigns of the
 "Great Leap Forward" type nor the mounting of
 grandiose but ill-founded programs similar to the
 10-year plan of 1978 can be used as shortcuts to
 remedying China's backwardness. If there is a consen-
 sus developing among the Chinese leaders as to how
 the modernization effort should go in the future, it
 would seem to be one of continuing the pragmatic,
 trial-and-error approach used since the Third Plenum
 to meet the problems and choices confronting them.
 The Chinese leadership cannot work out systematic
 long-term plans for the economy until the results of the
 current period of readjustment begin to come in. The
 sparse information received thus far on Chinese
 thinking about the next two decades suggests that
 agricultural development will continue to be the
 fundamental basis for overall economic modernization
 and growth. Although there have been no thorough
 Chinese discussions of long-term development strate-
 gies, agricultural growth apparently is deemed the
 point of departure for the pursuit of an import
 substitution program in the 1980s and 1990s. Such a
 program seems aimed at initially heavy use and then
 eventual diminution of PRC economic linkages to the
 outside world to create the conditions for domestically
 driven, "self-reliant" economic growth. The elements
 of this approach to development appear to be as
 follows:
 ? Maintenance of steady, if unspectacular, increases in
 grain production and in industrial crops while
 accelerating the output of nongrain foods, particu-
 larly meat products. The aim is to more fully exploit
 the large areas of China suitable for grazing sheep,
 goats, and cattle but which cannot be sown to crops
 except at high cost. Thus, the composition of Chinese
 diets would gradually shift away from grains and
 toward higher intake of vegetables, edible oils, and
 meat products, into a pattern akin to those associated
 with the higher income LDCs.
 As agriculture develops, the PRC apparently hopes
 to move to import substitution policies in the mid-
 1980s. This is aimed first at eventually eliminating
 imports of grain and other food products and natural
 fibers, which currently account for over 20 percent of
 the import bill. Export growth will continue to be
 aggressively pursued. Oil exports will be important
 but limited by domestic needs; textiles will be pushed
 but held down by quota systems in developed country
 markets. Light industrial and agricultural products
 will continue to be important components of Chinese
 exports. Export expansion may prove to be difficult
 to sustain because of low rates of growth in the
 OECD markets and the derivative effects of such low
 growth on China's LDC trading partners.
 As import costs for food and fibers decline and export
 earnings increase, PRC imports of complete plants,
 equipment, and technology are likely to accelerate.
 The pattern of such imports is likely to remain much
 like that of the past-spurts of purchases followed by
 extended periods of absorption time. New production
 capacity for the extractive and industrial processing
 industries and the transportation sector is likely to be
 a main component of these imports.
 Toward the end of the decade the PRC apparently
 hopes that imports of new industrial capacity and
 expansion of present domestic capacity will have
 diminished the importance of imports in meeting the
 country's need for finished and semifinished indus-
 trial materials as well as transportation equipment.
 These now account for over one-third of the import
 bill.
 ? The government recognizes the danger of increased
 balance-of-payment problems. The Chinese already
 can draw on almost $30 billion in firm credits and
 loans through 1985 and are actively seeking more for
 the period beyond 1985. We see no reason why they
 should not remain adept managers of payments
 problems.
 An important if implicit assumption in this scheme is
 that investment priorities will begin to place more
 emphasis upon heavy industry in the late 1980s.
 Whether this can be done without slowing agricultural
 and light industrial growth depends upon such ques-
 tions as the composition and size of overall economic
 growth during the early 1980s, whether or not the
 leadership has been successful in achieving momentum
 in the agricultural sector, and whether the government
 can control consumption without depressing productiv-
 ity. In any case, the two major variables that affect
 economic as well as all other plans for long-term
 modernization do not change. First whether the
 present leadership can consolidate its hold on power
 and implement its present and contemplated economic
 policies. Their success in this endeavor is by no means
 assured and is further complicated by the likelihood
 that most of the present leadership will pass from the
 scene during the next five to 10 years. Second, whether
 the policy of placing a low priority on Chinese military
 modernization by linking it to the eventual develop-
 ment of a modern industrial base, which has been
 followed since February 1978, can be continued. A
 serious further deterioration in relations with the
 Soviet Union or Vietnam could lead to increased
 allocations of resources to the military at the expense
 of economic development.
 Even assuming that the leadership is successful in
 carrying out the new course along lines similar to those
 postulated above, it is difficult to foresee PRC
 attainment of the status of a "front rank" industrial
 state by the turn of the century. If China's present
 leaders and their successors are able to finally master
 the food-population problem, to rectify the imbalances
 within industry and between industry and the other
 sectors, and to have begun a full mobilization of
 China's immense material and human resources by the
 year 2000, they will have done well.
