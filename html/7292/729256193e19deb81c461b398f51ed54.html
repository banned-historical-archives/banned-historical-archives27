 Jr
 shall be my intention to try with determina-
 tion.
 My personal regards to you.
 Cordially and sincerely,
 JOHN Q. MCADAMS.
 VIETNAM
 The  SPEAKER pro  tempore  (Mr.
 PRICE).   Under previous order of the
 House the gentleman from New York
 [Mr. RYAN] is recognized for 30-minutes.
 (Mr. RYAN asked 'and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his remarks
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. RYAN.  Mr. Speaker, I am de-
 lighted today that Members of the House
 of Representatives have taken time in
 which to discuss the serious situation
 which exists in Vietnam.  I believe that
 we have heard this afternoon from the
 gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. GAL-
 LACxER] and the other Members who
 have addressed the House,. a very sincere
 discussion of some of the very compli-
 cated and complex problems which con-
 front us in the entire area.
 Mr. Speaker, last June 10 when the
 Foreign Aid Act of 1964 was under con-
 sideration on the floor of the House, I
 discussed some of the very serious prob-
 lems confronting the United States in
 Vietnam. I said then:
 The military situation in the area is stead-
 ily deteriorating and the United States is
 becoming more and more involved in a
 mean and ugly war.
 I suggested then that there should be
 debate in the House of Representatives
 concerning our policy in this war-torn
 area. Unfortunately, since then the mili-
 tary situation has gone from bad to worse
 and our involvement has become even
 deeper.  But debate has begun in the
 House of Representatives and in the
 other body.  It is very important that
 elected Representatives of the people
 present their views on an issue which
 is fraught with so much complexity and
 so much danger and has so many rami-
 fications for the American people.
 Although recent events, including the
 bombing of North Vietnam, have height-
 ened the crisis, the fundamental situation
 has not really changed since I talked on
 June 10. It is still true that the shifting
 governments in Saigon have not been
 able to gain the support of the South
 Vrietnamese people.  Indeed, it is diffi-
 cult to see how anyone in South Vietnam
 could be fiercely loyal to the Central Gov-
 ernment when that Government hardly
 exists.  There have been eight coups in
 16 months.  The most recent occurred
 only a few days ago.

 south.  Certainly the south could use
 the industrial goods of the north.
 Mr. Speaker, the elements for negotia-
 tion in this situation do exit.  Once
 there is a willingness to negotiate, a
 proper forum within which to negotiate
 can be found whether it is through the
 machinery which was set up in 1954 at
 the Geneva Conference or through the
 United Nations or some other, forum or
 international conference.
 It is impossible at this moment, I
 realize, to set forth any surefire formula
 for negotiations. However, various pos-
 sibilities can be suggested. Again let me
 stress that any plan must insure the in-
 dependence of South Vietnam.
 In the first place, there must be an
 immediate cease-fire.  Then there can
 be serious discussion of the terms of a
 potential  political  settlement.   Any
 agreement for a settlement would have to
 be guaranteed by both the United States
 and the Soviet Union.
 A minimal agreement might guarantee
 that both North and South Vietnam
 would agree not to join any military alli-
 ances or attempt to overthrow each other
 either directly or by subversion.  Each
 would be allowed to develop its own form
 of government. The South would agree
 to normalize trade relations with the
 North, but it would not be necessary to
 offer diplomatic recognition.  The rela-
 tionship between East and West Ger-
 many might be used as an example in
 that respect.  As I suggested last June,
 joint economic projects between the
 North and South might lead to eventual
 reunification and free elections.
 Another  possible  area  of  solution
 might be to provide for both North and
 South Vietnam to enter the United Na-
 tions on the stipulation that all aggres-
 sive action, including subversion, cease
 between them and, furthermore, that
 trade be resumed.  The United Nations
 might very well be called upon to send
 a peacekeeping force into the area to
 supervise such an agreement.
 Then there is another possibility, one
 which in the long scope of history and
 on the basis of a long-range look into the
 future should be given very serious con-
 sideration.  That is the creation on a
 regional level of an agreement which
 would include North and South Vietnam,
 Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. Such an
 agreement would prohibit the signatory
 countries from ;joining any military alli-
 ances or attempting to overthrow the
 governments which are parties to the
 agreement.
 A common market might be devised for
 North and South Vietnam, Laos, Cam-
 bodia,  and  Thailand.   Consideration
 might be given to the establishment of a
 customs union and a payments union to
 finance special projects and long-term
 economic development. A regional plan-
 ning bank could plan projects for the en-
 tire area or for the individual countries.
 Mr. Speaker, whatever political settle-
 ment is envisioned would have, I say
 again, to be guaranteed by the great
 powers.  Either the International Con-
 trol  Commission  under  the  Geneva
 agreement or the United Nations would
 be expected to play a peacekeeping role
 in the area.
 As I said at the beginning, there are
 no final answers to the difficult problem
 of South Vietnam.  However, neither is
 there any satisfactory military solution.
 Therefore, a diplomatic resolution of the
 problem must be found.
 I return to The thought of a recent
 editorial which appeared in the New York
 Times on February 9, 1965, which is ex-
 pressed in this way:
 The only way out is diplomatic, inter-
 national, political, economic-not military.
 A solution will not be found by exchanging
 harder and harder blows.  Perhaps a new
 start can be made from an untried base-
 that Americans, Vietnamese, Chinese, and
 Russians are all sensible human beings who
 are ready for peace in southeast Asia, or at
 least willing to consider it.
 Mr. Speaker, it is time to make a new
 start in Vietnam.
 MR. JUSTICE FELIX FRANKFURTER
 (Mr. CONTE (at the request of Mrs.
 REID of Illinois) was granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. CONTE.  Mr. Speaker, it is an
 irony of life that amid our rejoicing and
 celebrations we must give pause to
 mour.  Two days ago, on the birthday of
 the first American President, we lost a
 man who had become within his lifetime
 first among  American  judges.  Felix
 Frankfurter never sat as the Chief Jus-
 tice of this land, but he was its chief
 jurist.
 Long before his death, novice and
 trained lawyers studied and were guided
 by the brilliance of the law he set down
 in his opinions and as, indeed, they
 shall long be guided after his death.  For
 no man more epitomized the clarity, the
 intricacy, the sternness and the mercy of
 the law than did Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
 And if for future generations we must
 mark this man, if mark him we can, then
 let us say: "To no one did he sell, to
 none did he deny or delay, right or jus-
 tice."
 Mr. Speaker, at this point, I wish to
 insert into the RECORD the New York
 Times editorial of February 24, 1965:
 FELIX FRANKFURTER
 Felix Frankfurter was the heir and exem-
 plar of several traditions that have mingled
 successfully in the rich tapestry of American
 life.
 Had he lived in the 18th century enlighten-
 ment, he would have been at home in Dr.
 Johnson's London or in the Paris that so
 warmly  welcomed  Thomas  Jefferson  and
 Benjamin Franklin. He had a Jewish love of
 learning for its own sake as befit the descend-
 ant of six generations of rabbis and Talmudic
 scholars. He was an effervescent, insatiable
 conversationalist-a suitable taste and talent
 for a man born, as he was, in 19th-century
 Vienna.
 Frankfurter had  the authentic radical's
 need to protest against injustice and, in so
 doing, to risk unpopularity with the rich and
 respectable.  He exposed the wrongful con-
 viction of labor leader Tom Mooney during
 the patriotic excitement of World War I.. He
 crusaded in behalf of a new trial for Sacco
 and Vanzetti, in 1927, shocking many de-
 fenders of the status quo in Harvard Yard
 and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 He  was  active in innumerable dissenting
 movements.
 But Frankfurter had also the authentic
 conservative's devotion to the past, respect
 for power and taste for balance and order
 and moderation.  He entered public life un-
 der the auspices of Henry L. Stimson, one
 of America's great conservative statesmen.
 As Chairman of the War Labor Policies Board
 in World War I, adviser to Presidents and fin-
 ally Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
 Frankfurter served his Government with con-
 spicuous devotion.  Nor was it any accident
 that he contributed the phrase "with all de-
 liberate  speed"-with  its  nicely  balanced
 double imperative-to the Supreme Court's
 school desegregation decision.
 During more than 20 years at the Harvard
 Law School, he was a superb teacher of law.
 Combining erudition with enthusiasm, he
 awakened, stimulated, goaded, enlighter.ed
 and  finally  educated  hundreds  of  young
 men-not only as skilled professionals but
 as civilized men and as future public servants
 with lively consciences.
 Among his admirers there was a school of
 thought- that for Frankfurter elevation to
 the Supreme Court, although it seemed to
 crown his career, was in fact an anticlimax
 and  a  wrong  turning.   This  greatest  of
 teachers, some believed, lacked the ultimate
 self-confidence to wield judicial power, inti-
 mately acquired though he was with the
 workings of political power.
 Certainly his death will only temporarily
 still the long-continuing controversy between
 the judicial activists and the advocates of
 judicial self-restraint whose cause he cham-
 pioned.  There isno need here to arbitrate
 this rich and fruitful intellectual dispute.
 One has only to observe that he was ad-
 mirably brilliant, honest and unsparing in
 his contribution to the public dialog.
 As a philosopher and scholar of the law, a
 judicial craftsman, a master of prose style
 and a formative influence on a generation of
 American lawyers and public officials, Felix
 Frankfurter was a major shaper of the his-
 tory of his age.
 FORT SNELLING
 (Mr. MACGREGOR (at the request of
 Mrs. REID of Illinois) was granted per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include extra-
 neous matter.)
 Mr. MACGREGOR. Mr. Speaker, a cit-
 izens' group in Minnesota, named the
 Fort' Snelling State Park Association and
 headed by Samuel H. Morgan, of St.
 Paul, has been doing a magnificent job In
 working to preserve the historic and nat-
 ural values of the Fort Snelling area, the
 birthplace of modern Minnesota. Plans
 are underway now, with notable accom-
 plishments already recorded, for a State
 park in the fast-growing Minneapolis-St.
 Paul metropolitan area within easy ac-
 cess of nearly two-thirds of the popula-
 tion of the State. It has been designated
 as a national historic landmark.
 Over $200,000 has been raised from
 private sources to implement the work of
 this association. Because this park is so
 important to the entire State of Minne-
 sota I am inserting iri the RECORD today
 a portion of the chapter entitled "The
 Americans Build Fort Snelling," from
 the book "Minnesota-A History of the
 State," by Dr. Theodore C. Blegen, the
 dean emeritus of the University of Min-
 nesota graduate school.  Dr. Blegen's
 excellent one-volume history of our State
 was published in 1963 by the University
 of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, Minn.
 The excerpt is as follows:

 had to get military advice to the proper
 authorities, and to determine who was in
 power very often caused a cessation of
 combat operations with the enemy. In
 effect, the war would stop while the heads
 of government and the key leaders in the
 Army were changed, and this meant a
 complete retraining program by the
 American mission of all military unit
 heads as well as political subdivision
 chiefs.
 Probably one of the hallmarks of our
 mission in Vietnam has been the extreme
 patience of our American advisers, from
 our Ambassador and military command-
 ers, down to the valiant Americans who
 spill their'blood along with their Viet-
 namese comrades.  The situation to say
 the least is vexatious but we must always
 keep our eyes on our strategic role-that
 of thwarting these Communist advances.
 We will be  successful.  The Viet-
 namese will win their struggle.  How-
 ever, the road to victory never has been
 easy.  The future may call for more in-
 tensive strikes at the base and source of
 Communist power and aggression in
 North Vietnam.  The borders of South
 Vietnam may have to be sealed to pre-
 vent the flow of reinforcements and war
 material to the subversive Communist
 army. The 1,800 miles of coastline must
 be patrolled and the potential for re-
 supply of North Vietnamese operations
 on the sea be destroyed.
 The American people stand firm be-
 hind their President and behind the
 principles of freedom everywhere.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  Mr. Speaker, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. MURPHY of New York. I yield to
 the gentleman from New Jersey.
 . Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I
 would like at this point in the RECORD to
 include an observation, to the effect that
 the gentleman from New York [Mr.
 MURPHY] is speaking from a very knowl-
 edgeab1e position, being a graduate of
 the Military Academy and having been
 one of the great heroes of the Korean
 war. He full well knows what the battle
 with the Communists means.  He is
 fully prepared to evaluate properly ex-
 actly what we are doing in southeast
 Asia.
 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gen-
 tleman for his very knowledgeable opin-
 ions in this debate here today.
 Mr. MURPHY of New York. I thank
 the gentleman from New Jersey.
 BANKING POLICY AND NEW BANKS
 (Mr. HANNA asked and was given per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD.)
 Mr. HANNA. Mr. Speaker, it is fairly
 obvious that the Comptroller of the Cur-
 rency's office in general, and the recent
 more liberal policy for new bank entry
 in particular, has become a popular
 agency not only for criticism but also a
 rebuke.  No agency has operated infal-
 libly and, therefore, all are open to criti-
 cism. Also, it is fair to observe that these
 /  departments of Government are no more
 likely to be completely clear of partisan-
 ship under a Democratic administration
 than they were under a Republican ad-
 No. 36-4
 ministration and I do not think that any-
 one is surprised that this is so.
 The Office of Comptroller has taken on
 the vigor and assertedness not always
 present in its operations and there are
 many who would have preferred the
 previous status.  Mr. Saxon announced
 candidly his intention of broad competi-
 tion in the banking field, and injected
 new ideas and new personalities into the
 field.  This he has done in the normal
 course available under the law by char-
 tering new banks.  This policy, coming
 as it did after a long history of very
 limited new bank entry, gave the appear-
 ance of a revolutionary change and, in
 fact, on filling the area of banking ex-
 pansion to meet the level of banking
 service and need as determined by his
 office.  Mr. Saxon's first year's service
 struck with particular impact.  In our
 judgment, and I think those of sober ob-
 jective observers, the soundness of the
 Saxon policy  can only  be ultimately
 determined by the results of that policy
 when time has given a sufficient period
 to correctly assess the affects of that
 policy.
 Banking is, under our laws, a quasi-
 public activity, with special privileges
 and special responsibilities.  To the de-
 gree that new bank entries are extremely
 limited it can become a private monop-
 oly under public protection. It occurs to
 this Representative that our country, in
 its past, has preferred policies of maxi-
 mum competition in a free market and
 such a policy is ill served by a banking
 policy which would develop fewer and
 fewer banks as our population and eco-
 nomic strength expanded.
 Mr. Speaker, if an investigation, upon
 appropriate grounds, is indicated as being
 desirable-, I would suggest that such in-
 vestigation direct itself to an objective
 scrutiny of the policy of the Controller,
 seeking to determine whether the re-
 sults of free competiton, better and
 newer services, and wider business op-
 portunity have in fact been achieved.
 The operations of all Government agen-
 cies are no doubt open to some sniping
 on the details of particular cases, but
 if there is, beyond that, a charge raising
 the question of criminal action or mal-
 feasance in office, these should be par-
 ticularly made and particularly pursued,
 with emphasis of responsibility on the
 part of those making the charges.
 There remains one further observa-
 tion Mr. Speaker. Some of the confusion
 and much of the criticism should be
 directed against the confusion in the laws
 Congress has drawn relative to banking
 regulations.  Some recent events have
 demonstrated clearly that responsibilty
 has been too broadly proliferated in three
 It is our opinion that when time has
 given a proper measure for performance,
 Mr. Saxon's contribution will, on bal-
 ance, have been a constructive one.
 INVESTIGATION NEEDED WITH RE-
 SPECT TO SOME PHASES OF THE
 BANKING BUSINESS
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from Iowa [Mr. Gaossl is recog-
 nized for 15 minutes.
 (Mr. GROSS asked and was given per-
 mission  to  revise  and  extend                                                                                            his
 remarks and to include extraneous
 material.)
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, an inves-
 tigation of some phases of the banking
 business in this country is overdue.
 Evidence has come to the surface in-
 dicating there is something wrong in the
 way national banks are being chartered,
 denied charters, and in the general ad-
 ministration of banking laws.
 The  Bobby  Baker  investigation,  as
 halfhearted and spineless as it has been,
 has provided evidence indicating political
 influence is involved at least to some ex-
 tent in the chartering of national banks
 by Comptroller of the Currency James
 Saxon.
 Certainly, the strong political com-
 plexion of some of the stockholders of
 the District of Columbia National Bank
 raises some serious questions that call for
 a much deeper investigation than there
 has been to this date.
 Such an investigation, to have any real
 meaning, must disclose the names of all
 political figures-including Members of
 the U.S. Senate and House of Represent-
 atives-who are dealt in on the original
 stock and thereby stand in a position to
 make a financial killing.
 The payment of a $5,000 fee to Wayne
 Bromley, a former assistant to Bobby
 Baker, and the cashing of the check in
 that amount by Baker, certainly raises
 some questions in connection with the
 Redwood National Bank at San Rafael,
 Calif.  Baker and Bromley have taken
 the fifth amendment on all questions re-
 lating to the possible use of political in-
 fluence in that and other matters, but
 this provides no excuse for Congress to
 fail to do a full investigation.
 I repeat that these cases and others
 raise danger signals that the chartering
 of national banks is serving a type of
 political patronage.  There is also evi-
 dence that the activity of political figures
 has been an important factor in the de-
 cision to reject an application for a na-
 tional bank charter.

 some of his banking associates misrepre-
 sented their political fixing ability in
 order to get additional new deposits for
 Korth's Continental National Bank in
 Forth Worth.
 Correspondence  that  Korth  made
 available in connection with the TFX
 warplane investigation discloses strong
 evidence of political manipulations in
 connection with at least one national
 bank charter. Here is a brief chronology
 of what happened in this case:
 First. An application was filed for a
 new national bank charter in Winter,
 Tex. It was opposed by several bankers,
 including Fred Holland, president of the
 Merchants and Planters National Bank
 of Sherman, Tex., and John Q. McAdams,
 president of the Winters State Bank of
 Winters, Tex.
 Second. Holland wrote to Korth on
 November 7, 1962, asking the then Secre-
 tary of the Navy for help in blocking the
 national charter for Winters, and prom-
 ising to "make it worthwhile" to the
 Continental  National  Bank  at Fort
 Worth.  Holland commented that there
 were other banks in the Winters, Tex.,
 area that would be equally grateful if
 Korth and his associates at Continental
 in Fort Worth would block the Winters
 Charter.
 It should be noted at this point that
 Winters, Tex., is a considerable distance
 from either Fort Worth or Sherman,
 Tex.-far too distant to be competitive
 in normal banking business.
 Third. On November 9, 1962, Korth re-
 plied to Holland stating he would "do
 everything I can" to assist in blocking
 the Winters application.
 Fourth. Holland replied on January
 22, 1963, enclosing a copy of a letter to
 Comptroller of the Currency Saxon and
 making reference to the fact that G. E.
 "Gus" Holmstrom, senior executive vice
 president of Korth's bank, knew all about
 it and added:
 We will greatly appreciate you helping us
 With this matter and shall certainly look for-
 ward to the opportunity of returning the
 favor.
 Bear in mind that Korth, then Secre-
 tary of the Navy, was the former presi-
 dent of Continental National Bank and
 still owned about $160,000 worth of stock
 in Continental.
 Fifth. On April 23, 1963, Holmstrom
 wrote to McAdams, of the Winters State
 Bank, assuring him that he and Korth
 would do all they could to block the is-
 suance of a national bank charter at
 Winters.
 Sixth. On the same day, April 23, 1963,
 Holmstrom, the senior vice president of
 Fort Worth's Continental National, wrote
 to Korth, then Navy Secretary, and I
 quote the following from that letter:
 Just a short note to let you know that John
 Q. McAdams has increased his account with
 us substantially, and I am convinced now
 that if the application for a national bank
 charter at Winters could be declined, we
 would probably  get all of his business.
 Thought you might be interested in having
 this Information.
 Seventh. On June 21, 1963, Comp-
 troller of the Currency Saxon rejected
 the application for the new national bank
 charter at Winters.
 Eighth. A few days later, on June 29,
 1963, McAdams wrote to Navy Secretary
 Korth :
 Want to thank you as sincerely as I know
 for the assistance you gave in defeating an
 application for a national bank in our town.
 If the opportunity is ever presented for me
 to show my appreciation for this favor it
 shall be my intention to try with determina-
 tion.
 This is not the whole story but it is
 enough to demonstrate that a penetrat-
 ing investigation is called for in this case
 and other cases involving the business of
 banking. And let it be a fair and decent
 investigation, not a repetition of the
 Bobby Baker affair which has long been
 smothered under an avalanche of white-
 wash.
 Following are the texts of the letters
 released by Korth after he found an in-
 vestigating committee hot on his trail in
 the TFX fighter plane contract case:
 THE MERCHANTS & PLANTERS
 NATIONAL BANK,
 Sherman, Tex., November 7, 1962.
 Hon. FRED KORTH,
 Secretary of the Navy,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR FRED: I first want to apologize for
 taking your valuable time to discuss a mat-
 ter of relative unimportance, in view of the
 fact that you have so many very important
 ,things to do.
 Gus told me a couple of days ago that he
 had talked with you about the application
 here for  a national bank charter.   I be-
 lieve he also told you, at the same time, that
 the sponsoring group was Charles Spears and
 his associates, who presently have the Gray-
 son County  State  Bank and the Texoma
 Savings & Loan Association.
 Presently there are  2  banks  in  Sher-
 man and 10 banks in Grayson County, which
 we sincerely believe take care of the bank-
 ing needs of our community.  The proposed
 location of this new bank is less than five
 city blocks from the Grayson County State
 Bank, and is to be located in a shopping cen-
 ter which we understand will be started in
 the near future.
 We  know  the  prevailing  attitude  with
 respect to new charters, as well as branch
 banks in general, and feel that we must have
 assistance from friends like you if we are to
 effectively oppose this application.
 I have assured Gus that if we are success-
 ful in our efforts that we shall certainly
 make it worth while to his bank, and would
 like nothing better than to solicit similar
 assistance from  the  banks  in  Denison,
 Whitesboro, Whitewright, and the others in
 our area.
 When you have time I would appreciate
 having your thoughts on this subject.
 Respectfully yours,
 FRED HOLLAND,
 President.
 Mr. FRED HOLLAND,
 President, the Merchants & Planters National
 Bank, Sherman, Tex.
 DEAR FRED: I have your letter of November
 7 and certainly share your concern with
 reference to the proposed new national bank
 charter.  I shall do everything I can con-
 sistently to assist you in blocking what I
 consider an improper application.
 I will discuss this matter with the proper
 people.
 With best regards.

 Hon. FRED KORTH,
 Secretary of the Navy,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR FRED: I am enclosing copy of a let-
 ter to Mr. Saxon relative to our opposition
 to the granting of the new bank charter
 here.  You will notice that we have based
 our opposition on the lack of community
 need and stayed completely away from the
 fact that it will be actually a part of the
 Grayson County State Bank and Texcma
 Savings & Loan Association, which you will
 remember are both controlled by Cha:-les
 Spears.
 Gus Holmstrom knows the situation here
 well and I am sure he would tell you that
 if there was a need for another bank at
 this time we would be the first to recognize
 it.
 We will greatly appreciate your helping us
 with this matter and shall certainly look
 forward to the opportunity of returning the
 favor.       ,
 Cordially yours,
 FRED HOLLAND,
 Presidenr..
 Hon. FRED KORTH,
 Pentagon Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR FRED: John Q. McAdams keeps call-
 ing me concerning a new bank charter appli-
 cation in Winters.  I have told him that we
 would do whatever we could, and I also ad-
 monished him to be very careful as to w sat
 statements he made, as we were not in it
 position to commit ourselves in any way, due
 to our correspondent at Abiline.
 However, it seems rather foolish for the
 national department to grant a charter in
 a town with only 3,000 people, and only $4
 million on deposit.
 The bank now located there is adequate
 for this size town, especially when there are
 many banks in the county in every direction
 from Winters.
 With kindest regards.
 Yours very truly,

 Indonesia would be lost forever to the
 free world.
 Should this happen the great subcon-
 tinent of India, already under Chinese
 pressure along its Himalayan frontier,
 would be a prime target for further ex-
 pansion of communism. Here we have
 involved not only the Indians but also
 the Pakistani. The Philippines, Taiwan
 and Japan are likewise flanked and could
 not survive infiltration, subversion or as-
 sault. The Chinese colossus would then
 be at the front door of Australia and New
 Zealand, both with only token defense
 forces.
 Where can the stand be made?  Un-
 favorable as Vietnam might be, where
 will conditions be better? With'each vic-
 tory, with each swallow our enemy will
 grow stronger and the free world weaker.
 This lesson is not lost on Australia and
 New Zealand, both of which are begin-
 ning to look to their defenses.
 Our policy, through both Republican
 and Democratic administrations, has
 been to contain communism-and it has
 generally been successful.  Since the
 dust settled on World War II with East-
 ern Europe behind the Iron Curtain, only
 North Vietnam, North Korea,- and Cuba
 have fallen to the Communists.  Even in
 Korea, unsatisfactory as the conclusion
 there might seem to many people, com-
 munism did not advance beyond the 17th
 -parallel. It was contained.
 We have heard-it said that commu-
 nism contains within itself the seeds
 of its own destruction.  There are signs
 that these seeds are maturing and that
 the Communist empire is beginning to
 break up.  Freedom cannot be forever
 suppressed. A successful policy of con-
 tainment-of denying the expansion of
 communism-will expedite this process.
 Expansion to include the mushrooming
 population and the great resources of
 southeast Asia can only strengthen our
 enemy and weaken the free world's abil-
 ity to finally take a stand-as take a
 stand we must.
 It is far easier to say what must be
 done than it is to say how it should be
 done.  On this score we must rely on
 those better informed than we, but we
 cannot help but speculate on what might
 work.
 I am pleased to note the observations
 of the gentleman from New Jersey that
 the South Vietnamese in the field are
 prepared to continue the battle. I agree
 that a prime objective must be a stable
 government in Safgon capable of attract-
 ing the loyalty of the South Vietnamese.
 I deplore the lack of leadership and the
 internecine strife that has characterized
 South Vietnam for too long. Yet, I think
 it is not too much to expect that South
 Vietnam will  produce-perhaps  with
 our help-the leadership it so desperately
 requires just as England produced its
 Churchill at the ebb of the 'tide, as
 France accepted De Gaulle in the midst
 of chaos, indeed as Malaysia produced its
 Tunku.  This must, be the objective of
 our diplomacy.
 Militarily, all is not as black as is
 painted but success in the field is vital to
 the establishment of a stable government.

 job in Malaya was easier in that the
 enemy-the Chinese Communists-were
 ethnically different from the Malayans.
 The Vietcong refuse to wear black hats
 and the "protected villages" which the
 South Vietnamese "liberate" fall when
 left to the protection of the home guard
 which frequently contains one or more
 of the Vietcong.  I am aware of the
 greatly increased effort this would re-
 quire of the United States and South
 Vietnam.
 A greater effort must then be made to
 interdict the border and stop the flow of
 men and arms to the south.  This is a
 tremendous job.  I like to think of our
 air strikes to the north as being not
 only "retaliatory"-in which objective I
 have little confidence-but also as being
 aimed at marshalling points and trans-
 portation lines and therefore an effort to
 interdict the border by the best and
 easiest means at hand.  I am apprehen-
 sive of escalation but doubt that such
 will occur at the present level of "re-
 taliation."
 And then, long since, I would have
 brought the Soviet Union into conversa-
 tions about this area. A major war be-
 tween China and the United States,
 from which Russia could abstain, would
 of course be in the Russian interest.
 Short of that, however, Russian inter-
 ests in southeast Asia far more closely
 parallel American interests than they
 do those of the Chinese.
 We had a bitter lesson in opportunis-
 tic negotiation before World War II,
 as area after area was sacrificed, to
 fascism by the inactivity and, perhaps,
 the fear of the Western powers.  The
 list is long-Ethiopia, Albania, Austria,
 the Saar, the Sudentenland.  We need
 not, I hope, learn that lesson again.
 The task is not easy.  It calls for the

 GENERAL LEAVE TO EXTEND
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, I ask
 unanimous consent that all Members
 who wish to do so may be permitted 5
 legislative days in which to extend their
 remarks at this point in the RECORD.
 The  SPEAKER   pro  tempore.  (Mr.

 of the gentleman from Illinois?
 There was no objection.

 ask unanimous consent that the special

 Mr. MURPHY of New York.  Mr.
 Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to join
 my colleague the gentleman from New
 Jersey [Mr.  GALLAGHER]  in expressing
 my personal, and I know the overwhelm-
 ing sentiments of my district, concerning
 the militant role that we must play in
 southeast Asia.,
 I think we must bear in mind that mil-
 itary force is an extension of a nation's
 foreign policy and that force is used
 when diplomacy fails.  The question in
 this case, however, is, Who used force
 first and what is the proper solution in
 dealing with a foe that has resorted to
 the tactics the Communist bloc has initi-
 ated in the southeast Asian region?
 The Honorable William P. Bundy, As-
 sistant Secretary of State for Far East-
 ern Affairs, spoke before the Washington
 Chamber of Commerce, Washington,
 Mo., on Saturday, January 23, 1965, and
 traced the history of the present situa-
 tion starting with the year 1898.  I in-
 clude some of his remarks:
 AMERICAN  POLICY  IN  SOUTH VIETNAM  AND
 SOUTHEAST ASIA
 (Address by Hon. William P. Bundy)
 I
 The first question requires a look at his-
 tory.
 Even when the Far East was much more
 distant than it is today, we Americans had
 deep concern for developments there.  Amer-
 icans pioneered in trade and missionary ef-
 fort with China and in opening up Japan to
 Western Influence.  In 1898 we became in a
 sense a colonial power in the Philippines,
 but began almost at once to prepare the way
 for   independence   and   self-government
 there-an independence promised by act of
 Congress in 1936 and achieved on schedule
 in 1946. By the 1930's, we had wide interests
 of many types in the Far East, though only
 few direct contacts in southeast Asia apart
 from  the  individual  Americans  who  had
 served over decades as political advisers to
 the independent Kingdom of Thailand.
 Events then took a more ominous turn.
 We became aware that the  ambitions     of
 Japanese military leaders to dominate all of
 Asia were a threat not only to the specific
 interests of ourselves and other Western na-
 tions, but to the peace of the whole area and
 indeed of the world.  China, in which we had
 taken a lead in dismantling the 19th century
 system  of foreign special  privileges,  was
 progressively  threatened  and  large  parts
 overrun.  We ourselves were finally attacked
 at Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines.   We
 responded to aggression by conducting with
 our allies a major Pacific war that cost the
 United States alone 272,700 casualties and
 over a hundred billion dollars.
 In the end Japanese militarism was de-
 feated, and the way apparently cleared for
 an Asia of free and independent national
 states that would be progressively freed of
 colonialism, that need threaten neither each

 other nor neighboring states, and that could
 tackle in their own way the eternal problems
 of building political and economic struc-
 tures that would satisfy the aspiration of
 their peoples.
 That kind of Far East was a pretty good
 definition of our national interests then.  It
 is equally valid today.  We cared about the
 Far East, and we care today, because we
 know that what happensthere--among peo-
 ples numbering 33 percent of the world's
 population, with great talent, past historic
 greatness, and capacity--is bound to make a
 crucial difference whether there will be the
 kind of world in which the common Ideals
 of freedom can spread, nations live and work
 together without strife, and-most basic of
 all-we ourselves, in the long run, survive as
 the kind of nation we are determined to be.
 Our basic stake in the Far East is our stake
 in a peaceful and secure world as distinct
 from a violent and chaotic one.  But there
 were three great flaws in the 1945 picture
 after the defeat of Japan.
 1. In China, a civil war had been raging
 since the 1920's between the Government, led
 by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Chinese Com-
 munist movement.  After a brief and edgy
 truce during the war against Japan, that
 civil  war was  resumed  in  circumstances
 where the  Government had been     gravely
 weakened.  We assisted that government in
 every way possible. Mistakes may have been
 made, but in the last analysis mainland
 China could not have been saved from com-
 munism without the commitment of major
 U.S. ground and air forces to a second
 war on the Asian mainland.  Faced with
 a concurrent threat from Soviet Russia
 against Europe and the Near East, we did not
 make-and perhaps could not then have
 made-that commitment.  And there came
 to power on the mainland, in the fall of 1949,
 a Communist regime filled with hatred of
 the West, with the vision of a potential
 dominant role for China, but imbued above
 all with a primitive Communist ideology In
 its must virulent and expansionist form.
 2. In Korea, a divided country stood un-
 easily, half free and half Communist.  With
 our military might sharply reduced after the
 war, as part of what may have been an in-
 evitable slackening of effort, we withdrew our
 forces and reduced our economic aid before
 there was In existence a strong South Korean
 defensive  capacity.  With  Soviet  backing
 North Korea attacked across the 38th parallel
 in June 1950.   With the Soviets then absent
 from the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. was
 able to condemn the aggression and to mount
 a U.N. effort to assist South Korea.    The
 United States played by far the greatest out-
 side role in a conflict that brought 157,530
 U.S. casualties, cost us at least $18 billion in
 direct expenses, and in the end--after Com-
 munist China had also intervened-restored
 an independent South Korea, although It left
 a unified and free Korea to be worked out in
 the future.
 In retrospect, our action In Korea reflected
 three elements:
 A recognition that aggression of any sort
 must be met early and head on, or it will
 have to be met later and in tougher circum-
 stances.  We had relearned the lessons of the
 1930's-Manchuria, Ethiopia, the Rhineland,
 Czechoslovakia.
 A recognition that a defense line in Asia,
 stated in terms of an island perimeter, did
 not adequately define our vital interests-
 that those vital Interests could be affected by
 action on the mainland of Asia.
 An understanding that, for the future, a
 power vacuum was an invitation to aggres-
 sion,                that  there  must  be  local  political,
 economic, and military strength in being to
 make aggression unprofitable, but also that
 there must be a demonstrated willingness of
 major external power both toassist and to
 intervene if required.
 8. In southeast Asia, finally, there was a
 third major flaw-the difficulty of liquidat-
 ing colonial regimes and replacing them by
 new and stable independent governments.
 The Philippines became independent and
 with our hhlp overcame the ravages of war
 and  the  Communist  Rule  rebellion.  The
 British, who had  likewise prepared India
 and Burma and made them independent,
 were In the process of doing the same in
 Malaya even as they joined with the Ma-
 layans in beating back a 12-year Communist
 subversive effort. Indonesia was less well
 prepared; it gained its independence, too,
 with our support, but with scars that have
 continued to affect the otherwise natural
 and healthy development of Indonesian na-
 tionalism.
 French Indochina was the toughest case.
 The French had thought in terms of a slow
 evolution to an eventual status within some
 French union of states--a concept too lei-
 surely to fit the postwar mood of Asia.  And
 militant Vietnamese nationalism-had fallen
 to the leadership of dedicated Communists.
 We all know the result.  Even with sub-
 stantial help from us, France was unable to
 defeat the Communist-led nationalist move-
 ment.  Despite last-minute promises of in-
 dependence, the struggle inevitably appeared
 as an attempt to preserve a colonial position.
 By 1954, it could only have been won, again,
 by a major U.S. military commitment, and
 perhaps not even then.  The result was the
 settlement at Geneva.   The accords reached
 there were almost certainly the best achiev-
 able, but they left a situation with many
 seeds of future trouble. Briefly:
 1. North  Vietnam  was  militantly  Com-
 munist, and ha., developed during the war
 against the French an army well equipped
 and highly skilled Inboth conventional and
 subversive warfare. From the start, North
 Vietnam planned and expected to take over
 the south and in due course Laos and Cam-
 bodia, thinking that this would probably
 happen by sheer decay under pressure, but
 prepared to resort to other means if needed.
 2. South Vietnam had no effective or pop-
 ular leadership to start with, was demoral-
 ized and unprepared for self-government,
 and had only the remnants of the Vietnamese
 military forces who had fought with the
 French.  Under the accords, external mili-
 tary help was limited to a few hundred ad-
 visers.  Apart from its natural self-sufficien-
 cy in food, South Vietnam had few assets
 that appeared to match those of the north
 in the struggle that was sure to come.
 S. Cambodia was more hopeful In some
 respects, more remote from North Vietnam,
 with a leader in Prince Sihanouk, a strong
 historical tradition, and the freedom to ac-
 cept external assistance as she saw fit.  From
 the start Sihanouk Insisted, with our full
 and continuing support, on a status of neu-
 trality.
 4. Laos, however, was less unified and was
 left under the accords with a built-in and
 legalized Communist presence, a disrupted
 and weak economy, and no military forces of
 significance.
 Such was the situation President Eisen-
 hower and Secretary Dulles faced in 1954.
 Two things were clear-that in the absence
 of external help communism was virtually
 certain to take over the successor states of
 Indochina and to move to the borders of
 Thailand and perhaps beyond, and that with
 France no longer ready to act, at least in
 South Vietnam, no power other than the
 United States could move in to help fill the
 vacuum.
 Their decision, expressed in a series of ac-
 tions starting In late 1954, was to move in to
 help these countries. Besides South Vietnam
 and more modest efforts in Laos and Cam-
 bodia, substantial assistance was begun to
 Thailand.
 The appropriations for these actions were-
 voted by successive Congresses, and in 1954
 the Senate likewise ratified the Southeast
 Asia Treaty, to which Thailand and the Phil-
 ippines adhered along with the United States,
 Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and
 Pakistan.   Although  not  signers  of  the
 treaty, South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia
 could call on the SEATO members for help
 against aggression.
 So a commitment was made, with the sup-
 port  of  both  political  parties,                                                                                                that  has
 guided our policy in southeast Asia for a
 decade now.  It was not a commitment that
 envisaged a U.S. position of power in south-
 east Asia or U.S. military bases there.                                                                                                  We
 threatened no one.  Nor was it a commit-
 ment that substituted U.S. responsibility for
 the basic responsibility of the nations them-
 selves for their own defense, political sta-
 bility, and economic progress.  It was a com-
 mitment to do what we could to help these
 nations attain and maintain the independ-
 ence and security to which they were en-
 titled-both for their own sake and because
 we recognized that, like South Korea, south-
 east Asia was a key area of the mainland of
 Asia.  If it fell to Communist control, this
 would enormously add to the momentum
 and power of the expansionist Communist
 regimes  in  Communist  China and  North
 Vietnam, and thus to the threat to the whole
 free world position in the Pacific.
 Let us look at Vietnam from the
 beautiful city of Saigon.  I visited Saigon
 in December of 1963 with five of my col-
 leagues, and spoke at length with Gen..
 Paul D. Harkins, commander of our Mili-
 tary Assistance Advisory Group, Ambas-
 sador Henry Cabot Lodge, and many of
 our American military and businessmen
 in the area.  The most striking thing
 about Vietnam is the fact that it is the
 richest agricultural area In the world.
 The experts have said that sufficient food
 can be produced in this area to feed al.
 most all of Asia.  This territory in the
 southern portion of Vietnam also per.-
 mits guerrilla forces to live off the land
 without a constant resupply to sustain
 their activities in the field.  The area is
 abundant in geese, ducks, and of course
 the staple commodity-rice.
 During the early phase of the Viet-
 namese operation against the Vietcong,
 our military adviser initiated a policy
 wherein all of the villages of the country
 were  organized  and  defended  in a.
 unique manner. Instead of letting the
 farmers fall prey to small marauding:
 bands of Vietcong, each town was forti-
 fied.                                                                                                   The valuables were placed in a,
 warehouse or hut in the center of town.
 and at the first sign of an attack, the
 villagers would retreat to this redoubt,
 and a radio call for help was sent to the
 nearest army force whose immediate re-
 sponse was guaranteed through the use
 of helicopters and other high-speed air-
 craft, in conjunction with paratroop op-
 erations.  When the war was virtually
 won in the north the Vietcong were
 starved out, but in the south they could
 rely upon the overabundance in the
 Mekong Delta to support their operation,
 hence  their  success  in  the  Saigon
 area.
 The war has been further complicated
 by the very complex situation within the
 country.  You can imagine the problems
 our advisers had with the turnover of
 governments. The American advisers

 ,what the gentleman says and in support
 of what the President of the United
 States says.
 Mr. Speaker, I am more than pleased
 to see that this discussion today has been
 treated on a nonpartisan basis-that the
 great leaders in the? Republican Party
 are speaking as Americans and speaking
 in behalf of the United States.
 Mr. S13eaker, I think the gentleman
 from New Jersey has done the country
 a great service today.
 Mr. GALLAGHER. I thank the gen-
 tleman for his kind observations.
 Mr. GRAY.  Mr. Speaker, will the gen-
 tleman yield?
 . Mr. PUCINSKI.  I yield to the gen-
 tleman.
 Mr. GRAY.  Mr. Speaker, I consider
 it a high honor and a great privilege to
 associate myself with the remarks of the
 distinguished gentleman from New Jer-
 sey [Mr.  GALLAGHER].  The  gentleman
 has made a very valuable contribution
 to our foreign policy and well being
 policy here today and I commend him
 very highly for taking this time to dis-
 cuss this vital subject.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I thank the gen-
 tleman from Illinois very much for his
 kind remarks.
 Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Florida, a member of the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Affairs.
 Mr. FASCELL.  Mr. Speaker, I join
 in the general commendation of the gen-
 tleman in the well of the House who is
 discussing this subject and giving the
 House an opportunity to give its support
 to the policy of the President of the
 United States in this very difficult situa-
 tion.
 The rest of the world must and should
 know that the United States is not frus-
 trated-we do know what our duty is and
 we are doing our duty. Despite the fact
 that there may be some question of
 what needs to be done, we know in our
 hearts we are doing the only thing that
 can be done at the present time, looking
 to the future and working for a different
 way to resolve the problem.  I think
 most of us agree that we must hold the
 line and beat back the efforts being made
 by the aggressors, or we will not have the
 future opportunity to work toward an-
 other solution.
 the Communists will have gained an im-
 portant victory in a strategic area of the
 world and 'will have made the United
 States look like the paper tiger that Red
 China claims she is. If that should ever
 happen, how could we expect our allies
 to believe us when we say that we stand
 shoulder to shoulder with them.
 I am tired of listening to proposals of
 retreat and appeasement to the Com-
 munists.  I believe that these proposals
 do a great deal of harm to American
 world leadership.
 Since, the emergence of the United
 States as the natural and willing leader
 of the free world we have led and will
 continue to lead the fight against Com-
 munist aggression.
 If the time should come that we are
 no longer willing to oppose communism,
 then let us make that clear. But we are
 not going to abandon the battle now.
 And if we should quit in Vietnam, the
 rest of the world will take this as a signal
 that we are quitting the fight and giving
 the Reds a victory by default. And they
 will think that this is the beginning of
 a policy of giving in to the Communists
 throughout the world.
 Mr. Speaker, during the past few years
 things have not been easy.  They have
 been far from easy. But we have always
 shown the world that we will fight the
 Communist aggressors and will stick to
 our commitments.
 We should not and will not quit the
 battle now-or until the face and soul
 of communism is wiped from the face
 of the earth.
 Mr. FARNUM.  Mr. Speaker, in my
 opinion this honorable body has been
 greatly enlightened by the report of my
 distinguished colleague from the State
 of New Jersey, the Honorable CORNELIUS
 E. GALLAGHER, on the conditions prevail-
 ing in Vietnam.
 Without necessarily agreeing in their
 entirety with my colleague's conclusions,
 it appears to me that in his factual re-
 port he has rendered a significant serv-
 ice in calling the attention of this body
 and of our Nation to the necessity for a
 view of the entire situation when state-
 ments are made about our policies in
 that area of conflict with communism.
 There is certainly no suggestion on my
 part that free and unlimited debate be
 limited in the slightest.  That is un-
 thinkable in a democracy.
 But it would serve the national in-
 terest, I believe, if all who have occasion
 to speak of affairs beyond our borders,
 and particularly at this point in history
 of affairs in the Far East, keep in mind
 some of the points made by the honorable
 Member.
 Certainly all of us agree with him
 that we must continually serve notice on
 the world that our Nation is united in
 meeting the challenge of communism in
 Vietnam.
 Mr. NEDZI. Mr. Speaker, we who join
 in today's discussion are conscious of
 the need for the House of Representa-
 tives to speak responsibly and with un-
 derstanding on the situation in Viet-
 nam.                                                                                           I am pleased that we are doing so.
 Both Houses of Congress have a role
 to play, as elected representatives of
 the people, in reviewing, criticizing, and
 But we have not solved the basic
 problem of how to deal effectively in non-
 military terms with what is commonly
 called subversion either military, eco-
 nomic, or political.  We are willing and
 should be willing to commit the neces-
 sary manpower, materiel, and resources
 to met any military threat, but we must
 also look one step ahead and be working
 to obtain those solutions which will per-
 mit us to deal effectively with subver-
 sion without being forced into a partial
 or full military response.
 Vietnam is not the last place that we
 are going to meet subversion.
 The United States cannot afford to be
 nibbled to death and we are not going to
 be nibbled to death.
 We have made that clear. No enemy
 should have any doubt about that. The
 history of the American people is clear,
 that we will stand up, fight and die if
 necessary to protect what we believe in.
 But we face a new kind of warfare and
 we must be prepared to deal in every way
 with that new kind of warfare.
 Mr. MICHEL.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. FASCELL. I yield to. the gentle-
 man from Illinois.
 Mr. MICHEL.  The point the gentle-
 man from Florida makes is a good one.
 I have heard mentioned earlier in this
 discussion Korea and several other cases
 in point.
 Would the gentleman not agree that
 Korea was an act of overt aggression?
 Rather than lumping the two together,
 here we see a classic example of indirect
 aggression at play. It is something new.
 Here we make, really, the first full test
 of whether or not we will meet this as we
 met the overt aggression.
 . Mr. FASCELL.  The gentleman from
 Illinois is correct. Of course, we must
 meet it.  We will meet it.  The fact is
 that our enemy is working in all other
 countries of the world in this same fash-
 ion, but without the obvious military
 overtones to their acts.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I thank the gen-
 tleman, who is a most knowledgeable
 member of the Committee on Foreign Af-
 fairs.

 And, as Secretary Rusk so rightly
 Chairman Khrushchev agreed to that in
 Vienna in 1961, and that became the object
 of the Geneva Conference on Laos and was
 the result agreed to in the accords of 1962.
 But before the ink was'dry, Hanoi, with the
 backing of Peiping, treated with contempt
 the pledges it had just given.  All Viet Minh,
 that is North Vietnamese military personnel,
 were not withdrawn from Laos-
 And, having been in Loas in Novem-
 ber 1964, I can testify that half of the
 Country is occupied by the Vietminh
 and Pathet Lao forces-
 thousands remained.  And North Vietnam
 continued to infiltrate guerrilla cadres and
 certain supplies through Laos into South
 Vietnam.  The International Control Com-
 mission was paralyzed in its efforts to ob-
 serve noncompliance. And Prime Minister
 Souvanna Phouma of the government of Na-
 tional Union, who supported those accords
 of 1962, was denied authority over territory
 or forces controlled by the Pathet Lao and
 the Vietminh.
 It is true that today neutralists and con-
 servatives are now working together and that
 there is no Soviet supply line supporting the
 Pathet Lao.  But a peace which would be so
 simple to achieve is blocked by the continu-
 ing refusal of Hanoi and Peiping to comply
 with the accords of 1962.
 And so, when people ask you, "What about
 the neutralization of South Vietnam?" keep
 your eye on Laos because there was a sin-
 cere and genuine effort to give the Lao-
 tians a chance to be independent and neutral
 in  the most fundamental  sense  of those
 terms.  And there was an agreement which
 has been frustrated by those who seem not
 to be content so long as there is any chance
 to expand their world revolution.
 Mr. Speaker, there are no quick or easy
 or ready solutions to the very difficult
 situation confronting us in South Viet-
 nam and southeast Asia.
 It is too late to debate the question of
 whether or not the United States should
 have responded in 1954 to a cry for help
 from a new country seeking to preserve
 its newly found and shaky independence.
 The fact is that we joined in an agree-
 ment to defend southeast Asia from ag-
 gression-a policy which has been sup-
 ported by President Eisenhower, Presi-
 dent Kennedy, and President Johnson.
 We have stayed to help an embattled
 people free themselves from outside in-
 terference and domination so that they
 might develop their own society, choose
 their own leaders, and determine their
 owns course of development.  We have
 stayed because we believed our national
 'security as well as the great principles
 for which we stand are at stake.
 There are those who argue that we
 should pull out now; that we should
 withdraw on the best terms possible, but
 in any case withdraw.
 But, Mr. Speaker, we are in no posi-
 tion to, pull out of Vietnam or southeast
 Asia until and unless an effective means
 is found to-guarantee the independence
 of these people. If we were to withdraw
 from South Vietnam today, or tomorrow,
 or even the next day without such a guar-
 itself.
 The loss of South Vietnam to the Com-
 munists would clearly menace neighbor-
 ing Thailand and Cambodia.  It would
 bring increased pressure to bear on al-
 ready beleaguered Malaysia.   It would
 open a side door into India. It would
 threaten the Philippines and even Aus-
 tralia.  It would make impossible any
 alternatives for Indonesia. In brief,
 Western interests and indeed freedom
 itself throughout southeast Asia and the
 Pacific would be imperiled.
 James Reston, writing in the New York
 Times 10 days ago, stated:
 Very few people here question the neces-
 sity for a limited expansion of the war by
 U.S. bombers into Communist territory. The
 American and the South Vietnamese posi-
 tion was crumbling fast, and the political
 and strategic consequences of defeat would
 have been serious for the  free world all
 over Asia.
 But, Mr. Speaker, a series of retalia-
 tory bombings do not constitute a for-
 eign policy and I am fully confident that
 this fact is recognized by the President
 of the United States.
 He has stated that, "We seek no wider
 war," that "our goal is peace in southeast
 Asia."
 This peace cannot be achieved by arms
 alone; neither can it be achieved by uni-
 lateral withdrawal or surrender.
 Mr. Speaker, it is imperative, I feel,
 that we heed the wise words of Secretary
 Rusk concerning Laos; that we keep our
 eyes on the relevant facts of current his-
 tory.
 It is also imperative, I feel, that we
 remember the President is charged under
 our Constitution with the conduct of our
 foreign policy; that we support him in
 his efforts to preserve both peace and
 freedom in southeast Asia in this very
 sensitive and delicate period of world
 history.
 Mr. GALLAGHER. I thank the gentle-
 man for his observations, and also com-
 pliment him for the suggestions he made
 on his tour in southeast Asia.
 Mr. PICKLE.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  I yield to the gentle-
 man from Texas.
 (Mr. PICKLE asked and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)                               .
 Mr. PICKLE.  Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to make this one point.  We all want
 peace in Asia and throughout the world.
 We should bear in mind that we do not
 gain ground by giving up.     You do not
 improve your position by retreat and you
 do not strengthen your leadership by a
 statement of weakness.        You cannot
 negotiate with the deaf.
 Mr. Speaker, as the headlines continue
 to blare at us every day, many cuestions
 are being raised about our involvement
 in southeast Asia, "flow did we ever get
 in Vietnam?  What are we doing so
 deeply committed in far-off parts of
 Asia?  Whose idea was all this, any-
 way?"
 3359
 Most of the people asking these ques-
 tions seem to believe that our interest in
 Asia, and especially southeast Asia, is
 something brand new, something strange,
 and even something a bit irregular. But
 nothing could be further from the truth.
 Our interest in southeast Asia goes back
 some 130 years, when the first diplomatic
 contacts between the United States and
 the Kingdom of Siali, now Thailand,
 took place.  Since that time, we have
 helped in the opening of Japan to the
 West; we were the ruling power in the
 Philippines for nearly 50 years; and we
 risked and waged two wars because we
 were concerned over the basic proposi-
 tion that it was in the interest of the free
 world-and particularly of the United
 States-that Asian nations be allowed to
 develop themselves free from outside ag-
 gression.
 Whether we like it or not-especially
 some of our short-memoried and rain-
 bow-seeking friends-we are looked to
 throughout the world as the one Gov-
 ernment which will help small independ-
 ent nations remain free.  It is a heavy
 responsibility; but it is a proud banner
 we carry.  At their invitation, we have
 offered help to the nation of Vietnam.
 That  little country-beset  with  the
 greatest conflicts of racial riddles, re-
 ligion and distrust-is fighting for its
 life-fighting against communism.
 These are tortuous and exasperating
 times for all of us.  Voices of doubt and
 appeasement and negotiation plead that
 we should take the easy-and tempo-
 rary-course of immediate withdrawal.
 But this is unthinkable; we cannot give
 an inch to aggression, or the aggres-
 sors-like the proverbial  camel-will
 soon be inside our own tent.  We must
 steel our determination and stiffen our
 backs with the firm faith that right
 makes might.
 In the beginning, we were either right
 or wrong to help the free people of Viet-
 nam; and we are either right or wrong
 now to preserve and maintain our com-
 mitment.  There is no middle ground.
 Our course is the right one;  the de-
 termination to see it through tough times
 is the difficult task.  The wise and the
 worried  know  this.    The  weak  and
 doubtful want to ignore it.  But history
 cannot let us escape it.
 In our time, our society faces one
 great issue-we must meet and answer
 the threat of communism.     It is a con-
 frontation that cannot be escaped.  In
 Korea, we either met it or lost north
 Asia; in Vietnam, we either meet it or
 lose all of southeast Asia.  You do not
 gain ground by giving it up. You do not
 improve your position by retreating; you
 do not strengthen your leadership by a
 statement of weakness.  And you cannot
 negotiate with the devil.
 What would it profit us to abandon
 Vietnam only to have a worse threat in
 India or Pakistan or Turkey or France
 or Mexico-on and on-until the cries of
 retreat grow into a thunderous tidal wave
 of isolationism-and we are left alone.
 It is better to have the confrontation
 now-to firm up our resolute position-
 than to close our eyes to the tyranny.
 President Johnson has answered these
 threats with positive and forthright ac-

 tion.  You can be sure that this same
 kind of reply will be forthcoming when-
 ever and wherever freedom Is endan-
 gered.                    The American people support the
 President in these hours.  And history
 will praise him for the strong leadership
 he is giving us today.
 We are not embarked on some new
 and remote adventure in Vietnam; we are
 embarked on just one part of the de-
 fense of freedom that has occupied us
 since we became a nation almost 190
 years ago.  The scale of our participa-
 tion may be new, but the fact of our par-
 ticipation is old, continuous, and honor-
 able.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I thank the gen-
 tleman from Texas for his statement.
 Mr. ICHORD,  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Missouri.
 Mr. ICHORD,  Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to take this opportunity to highly
 commend the  gentleman from New
 Jersey for taking this special order to
 speak out on this very important ques-
 tion.  I unhesitatingly associate myself
 with the remarks of the gentleman who,
 as a member of the Committee on For-
 eign Affairs, is in a position to have a
 superior knowledge of the background
 of the South Vietnam situation and the
 present state of affairs.
 I personally feel that there have been
 altogether too many speeches both in-
 side and outside of the Congress by gen-
 tlemen who are not as highly informed
 on the situation as the gentleman from
 New Jersey. We of the Armed Services
 Committee-and the Presiding Officer
 now in the chair is a ranking member of
 that committee-also had the occasion,
 the opportunity and the duty of dealing
 with the South Vietnam situation at
 length. Although I am not authorized to
 speak on behalf of the committee I be-
 lieve I would be correct in saying that
 all members of the committee, both on
 the Republican side and on the Demo-
 cratic side, give the President of the
 United States their wholehearted support
 iri his announced policy on South Viet-
 nam.
 I thank the gentleman for yielding.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I thank the gen-
 tleman for his kind words.
 Mr. PEPPER.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Florida.
 Mr. PEPPER.  I wish to commend the
 able gentleman from New Jersey and
 those who have worked with him in this
 important matter on the splendid sen-
 timents which he and they today have
 expi essed giving notice to the President
 and to the potential aggressors of the
 world that America will not falter in
 standing against those who commit ag-
 gression in any part of the world.
 I think all of us realize that it is of
 the utmost importance at this critical
 time that nothing which shall be said
 in the Congress or in the country by any
 responsible voice shall give any encour-
 agement to those who are watching with
 the most critical eye to see whether the
 faith and the courage of the people of
 America will falter in this high resolve
 of defending freedom; whether we will
 regard the end as hopeless; or whether
 we will count the cost too great and the
 cause not worthy of the aid that we
 give.
 Mr. Speaker, many of us for a long
 time have had great hope in the United
 Nations organization as the peacekeep-
 ing force of the world.  Unfortunately,
 it has not been able to achieve that
 status; unhappily, recent events in the
 Assembly  have  discouraged  the  hope
 that the United Nations was making real
 progress toward stemming aggression
 and keeping the peace of the world.
 So today, Mr. Speaker, if the United
 States with the strength and the will
 that it possesses does not defend the
 cause of freedom in the world, where
 will freedom find a champion?  If we
 falter here, withdraw elsewhere where
 we stand as the bulwark of freedom, the
 aggressors can sweep across a large part
 of the world without any effective oppo-
 sition.  Until more collective machinery
 can be provided effectively to defend
 freedom, the dedicated might of Amer-
 ica is the only force which can shield
 the weak and the free against the ag-
 gressive strong in many vital parts of
 the world.
 Mr. Speaker, the motives of the peo-
 ple of America In respect to Vietnam and
 wherever else we assert our power have
 no selfish ends.  We seek no ill gain;
 we support no colonialism; we are a part
 of no conspiracy to preserve the status
 quo because It is the status quo.  We are
 in league with none who would suppress
 the legitimate ambitions of those slow
 to arrive at the center part of the world
 stage.  We are part of no combine to
 hold back any who have the right to
 progress, whoever it be and wherever
 they are.  We do not propose to dictate
 anywhere to establish for selfish purposes
 any area of influence or to dominate any
 field or play the game of power politics
 according to the old way of nations.  We
 do not arrogate to ourselves the only
 righteousness or infallibility of judgment
 and, of course, we are always willing to
 reason with those who want to reason
 about right and how to do it or to ne-
 gotiate over what is negotiable and here
 in Vietnam as well as elsewhere we will
 negotiate about the best way of preserv-
 ing the freedom of an independent peo=
 pie and protecting them against aggres-
 sion with any of good will.  But, we
 shall not negotiate relative to our deter-
 mination to discharge our solemn duty
 under ' the United Nations Charter to
 defend freedom against aggression and
 we shall not negotiate as to whether we
 withdraw from duty whatever the diffi-
 culty, however great the danger.
 So, Mr. Speaker, I think it is highly
 important that we let the word go forth
 from the will and the heart of America
 that there is no weakening of our will,
 there is no division in our sentiment,
 there is no faltering in our faith to stand
 behind the cause of freedom and against
 aggression wherever that threat occurs.
 Let the word go forth that in pursuance
 of this high resolve we will stand with
 others if we can or, God helping us, we
 will stand alone if we must.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I thank the dis-
 tinguished gentleman, who has served
 with such distinction in the other body
 and in this House of Representatives.
 Mr. DORN.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  I yield to the gentle-
 man from South Carolina.
 Mr. DORN.  I join in supporting the
 President and the distinguished gentle-
 man in the well, and congratulate the
 gentleman on having taken this time,
 because this issue is the greatest single
 issue before the American people today.
 It is one of national survival.
 To me it is utterly fantastic and incred-
 ible that any responsible person in the
 United States in view of the past 20 or
 30 years of history of the modern world
 would propose that we pull out of South
 Vietnam or negotiate at a time when
 Kosygin in Hanoi a few days ago de-
 manded that we get out of South Viet-
 nam.  He demanded that we leave there,
 and branded the United States as im-
 perialist; this at a time when Mao Tse
 Tung has also demanded that we abandon
 the cause of freedom in South Vietnam.
 To me it is inconceivable that anyone
 in this country should acquiesce in that
 blackmail and turn these people over to
 the  ruthless  international  banditry
 known as communism.
 I want to commend the gentleman, and
 point out that during the last few days
 reports continue to come through that
 hordes of Red Chinese soldiers are mass-
 ing on the borders of India.  As Lenin
 is reported to have said more than 45
 years ago, the road to Paris is the road
 through Peiping. They have Peiping. If
 we give them South Vietnam, we would
 be  giving  them  all southeast Asia.
 India and 67 percent of the world's un-
 tapped oil in the Near East would be
 next.  Then north Africa, which is just
 a part of the great Afro-Eurasian land
 mass, will fall. Western Europe would be
 outflanked and would collapse as predict-
 ed by the Communists.  The road to
 America will be completely open because,
 as the gentleman knows, it is only 1,500
 miles from Africa to South America,
 The defense and security of this Na-
 tion and of-the entire western world and
 our western civilization is hanging in
 jeopardy today in South Vietnam.
 Mr. Speaker, I want to again commend
 the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr.
 GALLAGHER] and I rise to stand by the
 President of the United States in his
 earnest desire that there be no with-
 drawal and, certainly I think at this
 time, no negotiation, with the Commu-
 nist gangsters.
 Mr. GALLAGHER. I thank the gen-
 tleman for his contribution and for his
 kind words.
 Mr. MORRIS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from New Mexico.
 Mr. MORRIS.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 long admired the gentleman from New
 Jersey  [Mr.  GALLAGHER]  for his wide
 knowledge in the field of foreign affairs.

 thing to the attention of this House and
 to the attention of the Nation, and I am

 military equipment is smuggled into
 South Vietnam by sea, usually in harm-
 less-appearing fishing boats.
 By. this time, isn't the nature and
 source of this insurgency clear enough?
 In addition to the incontrovertible evi-
 dence consisting of captured Communist
 documents, testimony  obtained  from
 Vietcong prisoners, and the seizure of
 thousands of weapons manufactured in
 the Communist bloc, the most recent and
 dramatic proof of foreign Communist in-
 trusion In South Vietnam came last week,
 and on a massive scale.
 A Communist Vietcong ship was spot-
 ted hidden in a cove on the South Viet-
 nmese coast, in Phu Yen Province.
 After aerial investigation, air strikes
 were called for and the ship was sunk.
 South Vietnamese military units moving
 into the area encountered unusually
 fierce Vietcong resistance.  When the
 area was finally cleared after several
 days' fighting, Government forces found
 themselves in possession of a Vietcong
 weapons cache covering about 100 by 300
 yards-an estimated 80 tons of Commu-
 nist-manufactured  weapons.   Among
 this arsenal were 2,000 rifles and 150
 crew-served    weapons-machineguns,
 mortars and antiaircraft guns-enough
 war material to equip many Vietcong
 battalions. More arms, ammunition and
 explosives now being off-loaded from the
 sunken ship will bring the total even
 higher.
 The capture of these Communist weap-
 ons and the sinking of the Communist
 ship which was in the act of bringing
 arms from North Vietnam should prove
 to even the most doubting that the Com-
 munist claim that the war in South Viet-
 nam is simply a "civil war" is utterly
 false.
 The Communist North Vietnamese
 leader, Ho Chi Minh, and the Chinese
 Communists have regularly and insist-
 ently demanded that the United States
 get out of South Vietnam. They demand
 that we remove our 23,500 military ad-
 visory personnel, end our military assist-
 ance to the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment, and depart from the area.  The
 problems of Vietnam, the Communists
 say, would then be settled by the Viet-
 namese people themselves without out-
 side interference,

 to the preservation of freedom.
 (Mr. McGRATH (at the request of Mr.
 DANIELS) was given permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. MCGRATH.  Mr. Speaker, recent
 events in South Vietnam appear to be
 causing a noticeable strain on the pa-
 tience of Americans with both the con-
 duct of the fighting there and the con-
 tinually unsettled state of the South
 Vietnamese Government.
 In some quarters, this strain has given
 rise to fears on the part of some and
 hope on the part of others that the
 patience of the Government of the
 United States might soon evaporate.
 Further, stepped-up Communist military
 activity has caused insistence by some
 Americans that the United State nego-
 tiate itself out of South Vietnam.
 I cannot agree with those of short
 patience who would hurry the United
 States to the negotiations table. I can-
 not agree that this is the time to "play
 it safe," and back out of our pledge to
 the South Vietnamese people by face-
 saving agreements which, in the light
 of past experiences with the Commu-
 nists, we could not expect to be honored.
 I do agree, however, with President
 Johnson's actions aimed at convincing
 the Communists in North Vietnam and
 their advisers and conspirators elsewhere
 that the United States is determined to
 abide by its pledge to the South Viet-
 namese and continue to fight Communist
 aggression and subversion in southeast
 Asia.
 The situation in South Vietnam has
 now become a test of wills between the
 Communists and the United States and
 other defenders of freedom. To win this
 test, we must be patient and must not
 permit our determination to waiver.
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  I yield to the gen-
 tleman from California.
 Mr. COHELAN.   Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to take this opportunity to compli-
 ment the gentleman from New Jersey
 [Mr. GALLAGHER) for his very forthright
 and excellent statement.
 It was my great privilege only this last
 fall to be in southeast Asia at the same
 time the gentleman from New Jersey was
 in that area for the Committee on Po;:-
 eign Affairs.
 In the interest of time I am not going
 into any great detail other than to say
 that in 1964, prior to the great national
 political campaign, the issue of Vietnam,
 of course, was very important and very
 much a part of that national debate.  It
 was my good fortune to be present at the
 Commonwealth Club in San Francisco on
 September 22, 1964, when the Honorable
 Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, dealt with
 this general question in a major address.
 Mr. Speaker, I believe it ?s relevant at
 this point in the discussion this after-
 noon to quote one section of his very
 thoughtful speech on the subject of
 southeast Asia.
 He said to the Commonwealth Club in
 San Francisco:
 Let me turn for a few minutes to our most
 serious  immediate  problems  In  southeast
 Asia.  That area entered a new chapter in
 its strife-torn history with the partition of
 Vietnam in 1954 and the consolidation of
 the Communist regime in Hanoi.  It  re-
 quires no domino theory to explain the sub-
 sequent pressures on Laos and South Viet-
 nam.                                                                                              One need only recall the Communist
 appetite for world revolution, an appetite
 which grows upon feeding.
 When President Kennedy took office  in
 January 1961, he found in Laos, for example,
 an active battleground between government
 forces supported by the United States and a
 combination of neutralists, Pathet Lao and
 North Vietnamese forces supported by a So-
 viet  airlift.  He  became  convinced  afte:-

 of inevitable divine right, and it is no
 such thing.
 When we criticize the South Viet-
 namese, let us remember that for four
 long years the South Vietnamese people
 have suffered 5,000 fatalities a year in
 the fight against communism-fatalities
 at a higher rate in proportion to their
 population than the United States has
 ever incurred in any war it has ever,
 fought.  Can we say that such a people
 don't have the will to fight?  Can we
 say that we should abandon such a peo-
 ple?                     When we criticize the instability
 of their government, and Lord knows we
 wish that a George Washington or a
 Ulysses S. Grant or a Robert E. Lee were
 to rise among them who could unite
 his people and coordinate their efforts,
 let us nevertheless remember that this
 Is a nation just 11 years old, which has
 spent 5 of those years in stability and
 increasing prosperity, and 6 of those
 years under an outright subversion and
 attack.
 I do not say that we should not ever
 negotiate.  I certainly do not say that
 we have any desire to lose more lives in
 South Vietnam, or spent more money
 there, or broaden the war there.  But
 I do say that it is in our own self-interest
 to demonstrate there, as we have been
 called upon to demonstrate time and
 again throughout our history, that ag-
 gression, whether overt or subversive,
 against the freedom and against the dig-
 nity of human beings, will not go un-
 challenged.
 Two weeks ago the halls of this Cham-
 ber rang with voices saying, "Don't
 weaken the President's position in deal-
 ing with the Arab nations";  "Don't
 weaken the President's position in the
 conduct of our foreign affairs." What on
 earth are we doing to the President's
 position in the conduct of our foreign af-
 fairs when voices are raised in the Con-
 gress of the United States, saying,  We
 have to pull out of South Vietnam"? We
 have lost 281 lives fighting the Commu-
 nists in South Vietnam.  The South
 Vietnamese have lost over 20,000 lives
 fighting the Communists in South Viet-
 nam. We talk about their will to fight,
 but what on earth do you think it does
 to their will to fight when the Halls of
 Congress ring with the demand that we
 abandon them.?
 America has to be something more
 than a hardware store selling fine mili-
 tary hardware. It must remain the prin-
 cipal advocate of those principles in
 which the free world believes if it is to
 retain any claim to its position as the
 leader of the free world. We believe in
 the right of human beings to guide their
 own destinies, and we believe in free
 elections as the means by which people
 guide their own destinies. We believe in
 social evolution through political means,
 and not through war, but we do not rec-
 ognize kidnaping and assassination as
 legitimate political means.
 The call will be for a neutralization
 of South Vietnam. In 1954 the call was
 for a neutralization of all of Vietnam.
 Any time that the Communists indicate
 any desire to abide by the Geneva ac-
 cords, I believe that our people would be
 delighted to pull out of Vietnam. But I
 do not believe that so long as the Com-
 munists persist in the techniques of sub-
 version, of bombings of civilians, of the
 kidnaping and assassination of civilian
 governmental officials, that our people
 are prepared to abandon another people
 who fight such techniques.
 The Communists say, and the Com-
 munists believe, that we have lost the will
 to resist communism.  Those who say,
 "Negotiate," are rendering a great dis-
 service to the cause of freedom, unless
 they also say, "Negotiate from a position
 of strength.  Negotiate not simply for
 the disengagement of American forces,
 but for the preservation of American
 ideals."
 Perhaps we have lost our will; perhaps
 we have become too fat from eating what
 we should have saved; perhaps we have
 become too soft from riding where we
 should have walked; perhaps we have be-
 come too dulled from watching where we
 should have participated; perhaps we
 have become so spoiled from being one
 of the most pampered people the world
 has ever seen, that we have lost the will
 to respond to the cry of humanity in
 trouble.
 I believe, and pray, that we have not.
 Our enemies have always underestimated
 us; our enemies have always underesti-
 mated our dedication to the cause of free-
 dom, our determination that man shall be
 the master of his own destiny.  Each
 generation of Americans in its time has
 been tested, and no generation of Ameri-
 cans has been found wanting. For us to
 be found wanting at this hour will not
 only mark the end of America's day as
 the leader of the free world, it will mark
 the beginning of the night for freedom
 everywhere.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore  (Mr.
 PRICE).  Under previous order of the
 House, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.
 PUCINSKI] is recognized for 30 minutes.
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, I yield
 to the gentleman from New York [Mr.
 STRATTON].
 Mr.  STRATTON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I
 thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
 I would like to take just a moment to
 commend the gentleman  from New
 Jersey [Mr. GALLAGHER] for taking this
 time so that all of us who feel, as he does,
 that the President is doing a brilliant job
 in handling the Vietnamese situation
 might have a chance to express that
 sentiment publicly.
 The gentleman may recall that early
 in January I had occasion to speak
 briefly on the floor of this body to ex-
 press my concern over the fact that some
 Members of the other body were talking
 about negotiating and talking about get-
 ting out of Vietnam.  I had occasion
 then to say that I felt this was extremely
 dangerous, that this talk was jeopardiz-
 ing our position there, and that it would
 be as foolish for us to pull out of the com-
 mitment we had made in Vietnam as it
 would have been to pull out of the com-
 mitments we had made in Greece or in
 Turkey or the commitment we had made
 in Berlin or the commitment we had
 made in Korea and in the Formosa
 Straits.
 Since that time, of course, President
 Johnson has taken actions that rein-
 force, as the gentleman from New Jersey
 has pointed out, our determination to
 stay in Vietnam not only with the strikes
 against the north, but also, as today's
 news reports indicate, with American-
 piloted jet attacks against the Vietcong
 in South Vietnam. Both actions are de-
 signed to demonstrate to the Communists
 that their continued support of infiltra-
 tion in the south will be increasingly
 costly to them and to convince them that
 perhaps they might agree to live up to
 the promise the gentleman from New
 York [Mr; PIKE] mentioned a moment
 ago they had made way back in 1954 and
 have since been violating.
 I fully support President Johnson in
 these actions and I agree with what the
 gentleman from New Jersey says with
 regard to these demands for negotiation.
 There have been Members of the other
 body and there have been people in the
 press too who say, "Why, does not the
 President go on television and tell us
 what our policy is?" Well, perhaps one
 thing that this special order today can
 do is to reiterate the very simple policy
 that, as I see it, we are following; namely,
 we are doing in Vietnam the same thing
 we did with the Marshall plan, the same
 thing we did in Greece and Turkey, the
 same thing we did in Berlin, the same
 thing we did in Korea, and the same
 thing we did in Formosa and in Cuba-
 we are resisting and trying to contain
 the spread of aggressive expansionist
 communism.
 If we were to pull out of Vietnam now
 under such circumstances I think a
 very substantial part of what our courage
 and our money and our patience accom-
 plished in years past would go down the
 drain, as the gentleman from New Jersey
 [Mr. GALLAGHER] has so eloquently dem-
 onstrated. Certainly there is no unwill-
 ingness on our part to sit down around
 a table and talk at any time. But as the
 gentleman from New York [Mr. PIKE]
 mentioned a moment ago, if the Com-
 munists are prepared to agree to get out
 of South Vietnam and to leave the South
 Vietnamese people alone, and to abide
 by the commitment they made in 1954,
 we would all be happy.  But any other
 kind of agreement, any other kind of
 negotiation, would, as Senator DIRKSEN
 stated on the floor of the other body some
 days ago, be tantamount to running up
 the white flag of surrender. I believe our
 policy is that the commitment in 1954
 be honored by the North Vietnamese.
 Communists.
 Mr. Speaker, I would like to say one
 further  thing.   The  gentleman  from
 Illinois [Mr. PucrNSKI] mentioned that
 the Gallup poll indicates that 83 per-
 cent of the people of this country are
 behind the President in this matter. I
 would like to add a personal experience
 to back that up. Over the past weekend
 I had occasion to go back to my district
 and, without feeling that this was neces-
 sarily the popular view, I took advantage
 of several speaking engagements to re-
 iterate this particular position in support
 of the President on Vietnam.  I would
 like to advise the gentleman from New
 Jersey that I was surprised and pleased
 to find the sentiment in my district of
 upstate New York overwhelmingly in

 favor of this policy and behind the Presi-
 dent of the United States.
 I think it is time, as the gentleman
 has said, for us here in the House to say
 this out loud, and make crystal clear
 that we in the Congress are not about
 to throw away the long and successful
 history of American responses to Com-
 munist expansion in critical areas around
 the globe.
 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.  Mr. Speak-
 er, will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from New Jersey.
 (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN asked and
 was given permission to- revise and ex-
 tend his remarks.)
 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.  Mr. Speak-
 er, I should like to commend the gentle-
 man from New Jersey [Mr. GALLAGIiER]
 for his presentation today and for the
 opportunity which it gives all of us to
 discuss a very serious subject. This sit-
 uation in Vietnam is, of course, quite
 sensitive, because there are admittedly
 differences of opinion back home and
 here in Washington, too, as to what the
 appropriate course of this country should
 be.
 Let me state that in my opinion it is
 important that we remain firm with re-
 spect to our policy in Vietnam.  In my
 opinion, also, our present policy is cor-
 rect.  It seems to me a most inopportune
 time for us to be considering publicly the
 possibility of a neutralization which
 almost surely would riot be meaningful,
 of southeast Asia or of South Vietnam.
 It seems highly unlikely that discussions
 at this time would ever result in condi-
 tions that would bring about an end to
 the tensions which- plague that area.
 For that reason I think we have really no
 alternative but to proceed along the
 course we have taken.
 Unlike some, I do not believe this is a
 question of whether the Gallup polls
 support the position of the President of
 the United States. National policies need
 the support of public opinion, but pub-
 lic opinion should not be the decisive fac-
 tor in determining the wisdom of na-
 tional policies.  Nor do I think it is a
 question of deciding whether or not the
 President is doing a brilliant job. There
 Is room for differences of opinion about
 the way in which he is exercising his
 responsibilities for leadership.
 I do feel, however, that we could un-
 dercut the vital interests of this country
 if we should, for one reason or another,
 decide to abandon what we have been
 doing. If we do not show steadiness of
 purpose, if we do not recognize that a
 firm response is necessary to the contin-
 uing subjugation and aggression which
 has been occurring, we might well con-
 tribute to the political instability in Sai-
 gon, which is presently one of the prob-
 lems that South Vietnam faces. For that
 reason I think we should support the ad-
 ministration in its efforts to see to it
 that the Communists do not take over
 South Vietnam.  Should this occur, it
 would inevitably increase the possibility
 of widening communist aggressions still
 further. I should hope that differences
 of opinion among us will not confuse us
 as to the essentiality of what we are at-
 tempting and the justification for the
 course we are following at-.the present
 time.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I thank the gen-
 tleman for his enlightening remarks, his
 observations, and his contribution to the
 discussion.
 Mr. DANIELS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from New Jersey.
 (Mr. DANIELS asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. DANIELS.  Mr. Speaker, I thank
 the gentleman for yielding.
 I wish to compliment my able colleague
 from New Jersey for his stand and views
 on this most important issue and wish to
 associate myself with him.  Increas-
 ingly, we are hearing calls from col-
 leagues in both Houses and from the
 press for negotiations leading to a politi-
 cal settlement in South Vietnam.                                                      The
 argument is made that neither side can
 win a guerrilla war in Vietnam, that the
 South Vietnamese people are weary and
 unwilling to support the war further, and
 that the United States and South Viet-
 nam are risking a major conflict by
 bombing targets in North Vietnam.
 The position of the U.S. Government is
 frequently interpreted as not favoring
 the idea of negotiations leading to a
 political  settlement.  Obviously,  our
 Government wants the killing of soldiers
 and civilians in South Vietnam to cease.
 It wants to see an end to the wanton
 destruction of property, and the cruel
 disruption of the lives of the Vietnamese
 population.  Our administration leaders
 have made it clear that the United States
 does not seek the destruction of North
 Vietnam.  Our country seeks no special
 privileges or concessions in South Viet-
 nam, and we would be glad if all our
 assistance could be channeled into the
 peaceful economic development of the
 country instead of into arms, military
 assistance, barbed wire, and floodlights.
 The very real question before us today
 is: What is there to make us think that
 a new political settlement would solve
 the problems of South Vietnam when
 there has already been a political settle-
 ment?
 On July 21, 1954, there was concluded
 at Geneva a treaty which bound the par-
 ticipants to respect the independence
 and territorial integrity of both North
 and South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
 These 1954 Geneva Accords were agreed
 to both by North Vietnam and Commu-
 nist China.  North Vietnam specifically
 agreed to withdraw its military forces
 from South Vietnam and not to interfere
 in the internal affairs of that country.
 The U.S. Government had reservations
 about  a political  settlement  which
 handed over the entire territory of North
 Vietnam to Communist administration.
 Even though we did not subscribe to the
 Geneva Accords, however, we issued a
 statement at that time promising to re-
 spect them and warning that we would
 view renewed Communist aggression in
 violation of the Accords as a serious
 threat to the peace and security of the
 area.
 We all know what has since happened.
 The North Vietnamese Communists,
 confident that the chaotic political and
 economic situation existing in South
 Vietnam would soon lead to a total
 breakdown, bided their time for several
 years in the belief that South Vietnam
 would drop Into their hands like a ripe
 mango.  Meanwhile, the North Vietna-
 mese had secretly left behind in South
 Vietnam a large number of Vietcong
 agents and numerous arms caches, ready
 to be activated in the manner of an ex-
 prosive device when the proper time ar-
 rived.
 When it became apparent to North
 Vietnam that South Vietnam was grow-
 ing stronger instead of weaker, and
 would not easily fall victim to North
 Vietnamese subversion, the decision was
 taken in Hanoi, initially in 1957 and then
 on a more ambitious scale in 1959, to ac-
 tivate the subversive apparatus already
 present in South Vietnam and to step up
 the rate of infiltration of guerrilla fight-
 ers, arms, and terrorism into the south-
 ern part of the country.  Last year, an
 estimated 37,000 guerrillas were infil-
 trated from North Vietnam into South
 Vietnam. This is the peak figure which
 has been steadily increasing during the
 past 5 years.
 The South Vietnamese efforts to de-
 fend themselves, their appeal to the
 United States and other free world na-
 tions for assistance, and the events
 which have flowed from these Commu-
 nist and South Vietnamese decisions are
 well known to all of us. Ever since 1954,
 on a day-month-and-year basis, the
 Communist North Vietnamese have will-
 fully and systematically violated the Ge-
 neve Accords  they are pledged to ob-
 serve.  These violations have also ex-
 tended to North Vietnamese obstruc-
 tion of the work of the International
 Control Commission teams to inspect re-
 ported violations of the Accords, which
 established the ICC's right of operation
 in both North and South Vietnam.
 In these difficult circumstances, the
 South Vietnamese Government and peo-
 ple have and are taking military action
 to defend themselves.  This action, and
 the U.S. military assistance given in re-
 sponse to requests for help from South
 Vietnam, is consistent with International
 law and with the Charter of the United
 Nations-every nation possesses the right
 of self-defense.
 Since there already exists a political
 solution for Vietnam which has not
 been lived up to by the Communist side,
 what is present today which would make
 us believe that a new negotiated agree-
 ment would solve all our problems? Cer-
 tainly the record of Communist actions
 since 1954 gives us no cause for assurance
 on this score.
 The  late  President  Kennedy  once
 stated that we would never negotiate
 from fear, but that we would never fear
 to negotiate. The United States has
 never shut the door to negotiations on
 any matter. What is required in the
 present situation, however, is an end to
 North Vietnamese infiltration into South
 Vietnam and evidence that the North
 Vietnamese Government is prepared to
 leave its neighbors alone.  The decision
 will be made by Hanoi. Should it decide
 to cease attacking its southern neighbor,

 CONGRESSIONAL. RECORD - HOUSE                      3353
 Mr. MICHEL. Is this really the big-
 gest deterrent or detriment to political
 stability?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  The gentleman
 has stated it correctly. Political stabil-
 ity is the most significant detriment or
 deterrent to military victory and the sav-
 ing of freedom in South Vietnam from
 the Communist aggressors. If they have
 stability I think we can move on to vic-
 tory without esculation.
 Mr. MICHEL. Does the gentleman feel
 our retaliatory strikes to date have been
 effective, and that they should be stepped
 up or continued?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  No doubt they
 have been extremely effective.  I think
 the Communists now know they are not
 going to have an easy time if they pur-
 sue their present game.  They are no
 longer immune from the violence they
 enjoy handing out. It is becoming quite
 costly to them.
 Mr. MICHEL.  What answer would
 the gentleman have-to those who argue
 or say we ought to recruit volunteers
 from some of the other neighboring
 Asian countries out there to help South
 Vietnam defend their own land or for
 that matter to carry on guerrilla war-
 fare in the north?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I would agree to
 that.  In some of the other countries
 that I visited on my way to Vietnam I
 found there is a growing desire to send
 troops and trained guerrillas, especially
 in the Philippines.  They are prepared
 to send a regiment. They had a similar
 problem during the Huk uprising, so
 they are knowledgable to the ways of
 this war. There is a stability there now,
 freedom is flourishing.  I think there
 have been five or six nations that al-
 ready indicated a desire to send volun-
 teers.
 Mr. MICHEL.  Does the gentleman
 feel our Government, as such, is giving
 sufficient encouragement to that ven-
 ture?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  Yes, I do.
 Mr. MICHEL.  I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I thank the gen-
 tleman very much for his remarks.
 They were most helpful.
 Mr. PUCINSKI. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I yield to the
 gentleman from Illinois.
 Mr. PUCINSKI.   I should like to join
 in commending the gentleman from New
 Jersey for taking this time to make pos-
 sible a discussion of asubject that I think
 is more on the minds of the American
 people today than any single subject in
 America. I am sure the gentleman will
 be most encouraged to know that the
 very inspiring statement he made here
 in attempting to define American policy
 in Vietnam is supported by more than 83
 percent of the American people.
 It was my privilege to include in the
 RECORD last Monday the latest Harris
 survey which clearly indicates that 83
 percent of the American people support
 President Johnson's policy of measured
 retaliation against military staging areas
 in North Vietnam from which the Com-
 munists launch their aggression against
 South Vietnam.
 I am sure that the discusison here to-
 day in the House, being led by a dis-
 tinguished member of the Committee on
 Foreign Affairs, will be of great solace
 and comfort to the people of South Viet-
 nam.  It gains in significance particul-
 arly when they hear of the statement
 made by the highly respected majority
 leader of this Chamber, the gentleman
 from Oklahoma [Mr. ALBERT], and also
 the statement of the very capable and
 dedicated Chairman of the Committee
 on Foreign Affairs of the House, Dr.
 MORGAN, all joining ranks behind Presi-
 dent Johnson in his determined effort to
 keep the spirit of freedom alive in South
 Vietnam.
 The gentleman from Iowa read a dis-
 patch from the wire services which re-
 ferred to efforts being made by Secre-
 tary General U Thant to resolve the prob-
 lems in Vietnam. There also are reports
 that the British have been engaged in
 similar efforts to find a solution to this
 problem.  Certainly we as Americans
 have no objection to either U Thant or
 the British, or any other responsible_gov-
 ernment, trying to find a solution to the
 problem of Vietnam. This indicates that
 Vietnam is not a 'battle in which we alone
 are involved, but one that properly con-
 cerns the entire world; at least that seg-
 ment of the world which should be in-
 erested in preserving freedom for the peo-
 ple of South Vietnam.
 But I think that notwithstanding these
 efforts, well meaning as they may be,
 the President of the United States, Mr.
 Johnson, has set forth our policy as
 clearly and succinctly as anyone I know
 of, a policy that all Americans can sup-
 port and rally behind regardless of their
 political affiliation.  Mr. Johnson has
 made it clear that our position on South
 Vietnam is to remain there and continue
 helping them until the North Vietnamese
 Communists have withdrawn all their
 forces from South Vietnam; cease their
 aggression, and stop their subversion.
 We can then, and only then, begin seri-
 ously considering some form of discus-
 sion or negotiation for settlement of the
 conflict between North and South Viet-
 nam.
 I believe it would be unfair to Presi-
 dent Johnson and indeed to our Govern-
 ment, to try to read into the actions of
 U Thant or the British action, some
 meaning that the United States plans to
 withdrawn its commitment to the people
 of South Vietnam.  President Johnson
 has never closed the door to a discus-
 sion about methods to peacefully resolve
 the conflict but he has made it crystal
 clear that we shall remain in South Viet-
 nam until the freedom of her people is
 secure from Communist aggression or
 subversion.
 We have never refused to consider ne-
 gotiations, but we are reminded that it
 was only 10 years from Manchuria to
 Pearl Harbor.  It was Only 18 months
 from Moscow to the rape of Poland.
 Both of these tragedies occurred while
 the world was negotiating.
 We must never forget that we were
 negotiating  in  Panmunjon  for  11
 years.  President Eisenhower went to
 Korea in 1953 in good faith.  He won a
 truce while both sides were to negotiate
 a peace treaty.  There were specific
 conditions laid down for this truce.
 One of the conditions was that the Com-
 munists would not move in any addi-
 tional troops or firearms, aircraft, or
 ships or build any military installations
 in North Korea, and we would do like-
 wise in South Korea.  Yet the fact of
 the matter is that while we have been
 negotiating in Panmunjon, the Commu-
 nists have moved large supplies of air-
 craft and munitions into North Korea
 during these past 11 years of negotia-
 tions.  North Korea has become one of
 the most powerful Communist bastions
 in the world.
 We are also aware that in Warsaw we
 have been holding informal discussions
 with the Peiping Communists.  We have
 had more than 128 meetings with them.
 Not in one instance have they shown
 their willingness to stop their aggression
 and subversion in Asia and conduct
 themselves as civilized people.
 In southeast Asia, indeed, there have
 been many other examples of negotia-
 tions, all falling to Communist infamy.
 We need only look at the broken Commu-
 nist  promises in Laos.  Furthermore
 Mr. Speaker, we would not be in South
 Vietnam today if the North Vietnam
 Communists had not violated the pledges
 we negotiated from them in the Geneva
 Conference in 1954.
 So it would seem to me, Mr. Speaker,
 that this discussion today is essential
 because it helps emphasize the deter-
 mination of the American people to
 stand firm in South Vietnam.
 It would be my hope that the Member
 in the well and the other members of
 the House Committee on Foreign Af-
 fairs would give careful and favorable
 consideration to House Joint Resolution
 341, which I introduced last week.  I
 should like to read it:
 Announcing the sense of Congress in sup-
 port of President Johnson's policy of meas-
 ured retaliation against North Vietnam mili-
 tary installations as the situation requires.
 Whereas the United states, during the ad-
 ministrations of President Truman, Presi-
 dent Eisenhower,  President Kennedy,  and
 President Johnson, has been committed to a
 policy of assisting the people of South Viet-
 nam preserve their freedom and independ-
 ence from Communist aggression; and
 Whereas the North Vietnamese Commu-
 nists have in recent months stepped up con-
 siderably their aggression against both civil-
 ian and military installations in South Viet-
 nam; and
 Whereas this aggression has caused the
 serious loss of life to South Vietnamese sol-
 diers and civilians and to American observ-
 ers presently stationed in South Vietnam to
 help train South Vietnamese troops against
 Communist aggression; and
 Whereas the President of the United States
 has had to order carefully measured retalia-
 tory action against the North Vietnamese
 military staging areas where Hanoi and Pei-
 ping Communists have been or axe being
 trained for aggression against South Viet-
 nam; and
 Whereas the President of the United States
 has made it abundantly clear that to with-
 draw American assistance from South Viet-
 nam would expose the whole of southeast
 Asia to occupation by the Chinese Commu-
 nist forces; and
 Whereas such occupation would violate all
 the principles of the Geneva Conference of

 teed its independence and freedom from
 Communist aggression; and
 Whereas withdrawal of Amepican support
 from South Vietnam would only serve to
 hasten the day when Communist farces In
 Asia and China would wage all-out aggres-
 sion against the rest of the world; and
 Whereas the Hanoi and Peiping Commu-
 nists have failed to show a single overt sign
 which would indicate the problems of Viet-
 nam could be settled through negotiation:
 Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of
 Representatives of the United States of Amer-
 ica in Congress assembled, That it is the
 sense of Congress, speaking for the American
 people, that
 (1) This  Nation  stands  firmly  behind
 President Johnson's determination to wage
 carefully measured and meaningful retalia-
 tion against military Installations in North
 Vietnam which serve as the staging areas for
 training Communist forces to carry on con-
 tinued aggression against South Vietnam,
 (2) That the people of the United States
 stand firmly behind the people of South Viet-
 nam in their long and tireless efforts to pre-
 serve for South Vietnam freedom and in-
 dependence, and
 (3) The. people  of the  United  States,
 through their elected representatives in the
 Congress of the United States, send to the
 people  of  South Vietnam their heartfelt
 admiration for the great sacrifices which the
 people of South Vietnam have endured dur-
 ing the past twenty years in their struggle
 to retain   self-determination  and human
 dignity.
 I sincerely hope the Congress will ap-
 prove the resolution as a reaffirmation
 of our position in supporting President
 Johnson and the people of South Viet-
 nam.
 It would be my hope that this Joint
 resolution would do much to strengthen
 the spirit of the South Vietnamese.
 Very often we hear people say, "Do the
 Vietnamese have the spirit to win?"
 Any nation, any people, who have sur-
 vived and endured the hardships of Com-
 munist aggression and subversion for 20
 years as the people of South Vietnam
 have done, certainly do not need any
 further proof of their will to win. While
 we are aware and concerned about the
 internal problems in South Vietnam, we
 must understand that these are prob-
 lems which frequently follow in nations
 in turmoil. But the fact of the matter
 is that the South Vietnamese also have
 the right to ask to what extent the free
 world is ready to help them in their
 heroic struggle.
 I think the gentleman from New
 Jersey [Mr. GALLAGHER] and the Mem-
 bers who have participated in this dis-
 cussion have made a great contribution
 today in sending word to the people of
 South Vietnam and in the final analysis
 it is the people of a nation who really
 count-that we stand firmly along side
 of them in their heroic struggle and we
 shall remain in South Vietnam until her
 brave people can take their place among
 the free peoples of the World.
 Again I congratulate the gentleman
 from New Jersey for leading this very
 significant discussion here today.
 Mr. PIKE.  Mr. Speaker,  will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. GALLAGHER. I yield to the
 gentleman.
 (Mr. PIKE asked and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. PIKE.  Mr. Speaker, I, too, want
 to congratulate the gentleman from New
 Jersey [Mr. GALLAGHER] for taking this
 time today. We have heard so much of
 the voices of criticism and the voices of
 opposition.
 It is so easy to stand back and snap at
 a policy that somebody else has to carry
 out.
 Mr. Speaker, we have heard very little
 of the support I feel is in the hearts of
 the American people.  I appreciate the
 opportunity to add my own support to-
 day.
 Mr. Speaker, in common with every
 other Member of Congress, I have re-
 celved a great many letters from my
 constituents calling for "negotiations" to
 end the war in Vietnam. Almost with-
 out exception the writers refer to some
 vague "international guarantees" which
 can assure security there. Some call for
 "United  Nations'  guarantees  of  the
 peace," while others call for turning the
 matter over to the Southeast Asia Treaty
 Organization.  These people are Indulg-
 ing in wishful thinking, and I would ex-
 pect that deep in their hearts they know
 they are indulging in wishful thinking.
 In the year 1954 there were negotia-
 tions of exactly the type which they re-
 quest, and these negotiations resulted in
 the division of Vietnam into two nations,
 a North Vietnam which was to be Com-
 munist, and South Vietnam, which was
 not. The United States was not a party
 to these negotiations, nor to the Geneva
 Accord which resulted from them, but
 it has abided by them.
 The Communists of China, the Soviet
 Union and North Vietnam were a party
 to those negotiations, and that accord,
 and let us examine whether they have
 abided by them. From 1954 to 1959 the
 new nation of South Vietnam was becom-
 ing the success story in southeast Asia.
 One hundred and forty thousand land-
 less peasant families were given land
 through an agrarian reform program.
 The principal crop, rice, jumped from
 the prewar production of 31/2 million tons
 to 5 million tons by 1960. Rubber pro-
 duction exceeded prewar totals. School
 enrollments had tripled; primary school
 teachers had tripled; almost 3,000 medi-
 cal aid stations and maternity clinics had
 been established throughout the country.
 What had happened in North Viet-
 nam?  Its per capita gross national prod-
 uct was 38 percent lower than South
 Vietnam; its per capita food production
 was 10 percent lower by 1960 than it had
 been in 1956; so North Vietnam, which
 had participated in the negotiations, and
 which had signed the Geneva accord of
 1954, cast hungry eyes southward.
 In 1960 Ho Chi Minh stated that the
 north was being "more and more con-
 solidated and transformed into a firm
 base for the struggle for national re-
 unification."  Just 6 years after the
 Geneva Accord, the head of North Viet-
 nam publicly declared his intention to
 violate it. To those who say that shoot-
 ing is not the answer, I can only say, I
 agree.  But let them remember that in
 1959 the Communists embarked in South
 Vietnam on a program of sabotage, ter-
 ror and assassination, in a program of
 attacks on innocent hamlets and villages,
 and on a program of the coldblooded
 murder of thousands of schoolteachers,
 health workers, and local officials who
 opposed their form of liberation.  This
 was how the Communists who, had signed
 it honored the Geneva accord.
 In the years 1960 and 1961 almost 3,000
 South Vietnamese civilians in and out
 of government were assassinated; 2,500
 were kidnaped.  So to those who say
 "Let us negotiate," I say, "What is the
 purpose of negotiating a new treaty with
 people who will not honor the treaty al-
 ready negotiated?"
 Negotiation is not an end in itself, but
 is only a means to an end. All of us rec-
 ognize the frightful dangers implicit in
 an escalation of the war in Vietnam, or
 in the latter half of the 20th century of
 any other war, any other place, any other
 time.  But does this mean that at all
 times and at all places we will make
 meaningless treaties rather than fight
 for those things to which Americans have
 always been most deeply committed? Do
 we fail-to recognize the equally frightful
 dangers of making aggression easy and
 attractive?  Have we learned nothing
 from the lessons of recorded history?
 Do we fail to recognize the dangers of
 an escalation of appeasement? The sit-
 uation in South Vietnam is in a state of
 daily change, and we live in a time of
 peril where all of the alternatives are
 ugly alternatives, but I submit that the
 ugliest of all of them would be for an
 American retreat which would make ag-
 gression look easy and attractive.
 In this time of change, the one thing
 which does not change, and the one
 thing which has not changed through-
 out recorded history, is that when ag-
 gression is allowed to become attractive
 anywhere, when aggression is allowed to
 become easy anywhere, when aggression
 is unopposed anywhere, then attractive,
 easy, unopposed aggression breeds more
 aggression, as surely as the night follows
 the day.
 There are those who say that South
 Vietnam is not the right place to fight
 communism? that the South Vietnamese
 people and their leaders are neither the
 right people nor the right leaders with
 whom to fight communism.  I believe
 that the place to fight communism is
 where communism is being fought.  In
 4 years of American military commit-
 ment in South Vietnam we had, as of
 February 15, lost 281 lives due to Com-
 munist military action.  In the year
 1964 alone, in the county in which I re-
 side, we lost 202 lives in traffic accidents.
 I- have not received one letter condemn-
 ing the waste of lives upon our highways.
 We accept it as part of the American way
 of life, and it may be part of our diffi-
 culty that we accept too much as part
 of our American way of life; that we
 take the kind of government under
 which we have prospered so much for

 1965                      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 We should have learned from that ex-
 perience and many others since that no
 nation's independence is expendable, that
 every loss of freedom on the part of some
 other people chips away at our own and
 merely postpones an inevitable showdown
 with the forces of aggression.  We are
 supporting ourselves in supporting the
 people of South Vietnam.
 There mtlst not be any American Dien-
 bienphu.  Let us not negotiate ourselves
 into one, either, for the effect could be
 the same.
 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recall to
 this House the text of the joint resolu-
 tion of the 88th Congress last August in.
 support of President Johnson's response
 to the Gulf of Tonkin attack:
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
 representatives of the United States of Amer-
 ica in Congress assembled, That the Congress
 approves and supports the determination of
 the President, as Commander in Chief, to
 take all necessary measures to repel any
 armed attack against the forces of the United
 States and to prevent further aggression.
 The United States regards as vital to its
 national interest and to world peace the
 maintennace of international peace and se-
 curity in southeast Asia.  Consonant with
 Constitution of the United States and the
 Charter of the United Nations and in ac-
 cordance with its obligations under the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty,
 the United States is, therefore, prepared, as
 the President determines, to take all neces-
 sary steps, including the use of armed force,
 to assist any member or protocol state of the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty re-
 questing assistance in defense of its free-
 dom.
 Mr. Speaker, President Johnson de-
 serves our support on Vietnam at this
 time-even more than he did last Au-
 gust.            I am confident that the Congress
 and the American people will continue
 to support him.  Let us be ever mindful
 that our security and the security of the
 free world depends in large measure on
 our success in Vietnam.  It is his deter-
 mination to assure our security which
 guides the President in the difficult de-
 cisions he must make in this critical sit-
 uation.
 Mr. ALBERT.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. GALLAGHER. I yield to the dis-
 tinguished majority leader.
 Mr. ALBERT.  First, Mr. Speaker, I
 desire to associate myself with the re-
 marks of the able gentleman from New
 Jersey, who is a very industrious, con-
 structive, and effective member of the
 Committee on Foreign Affairs.  He has
 stated this matter succinctly and he has
 stated this matter well. I commend him
 on the high quality of his statement.
 Next, Mr. Speaker, I cannot let this
 discussion pass without taking the op-
 portunity to speak out in support of the
 courageous and difficult policy President
 Johnson has followed in the Vietnam
 crisis.
 Let me, at the outset, disassociate my-
 self from 'those who would question the
 motives of those who disapprove of these
 policies. God knows, Mr. Speaker, these
 are not days of ease and comfort in our
 Nation's life.  American men are en-
 gaged in a life and death struggle in
 Vietnam.  Their own lives and the life
 of this Republic are both involved. If we
 believe, as I believe, that a democratic
 society can best make its greatest de-
 cisions through discussion, then we must
 encourage free and searching discussion
 of this problem. We can only have such
 a discussion if we are prepared to assume
 that difference of opinion does not in-
 volve divergence of objective-that those
 who agree with the details of a given
 policy are not necessarily more patriotic
 that those who disagree.
 Further,, Mr. Speaker, I hope we can
 all find common ground on the proposi-
 tion that neither political party can gain
 any partisan advantage from this debate.
 There are vast areas of public policy in
 which each of the two great political par-
 ties can, with pride, point to its own
 position and criticize that of the other
 party.  But in foreign policy, when the
 future of the whole people is the stake, a
 striving for partisan advantage is, at the
 very least, in poor taste. I hope we can
 avoid it now, and in whatever circum-
 stances the present crisis may bring
 forth.
 Mr. Speaker, I support the President.
 I support him because it seems to me that
 he is making every effort to prevent the
 collapse of an important bastion of the
 free world.  I support him because he
 has adopted a cautious policy of the use
 of American strength on a scale precisely
 measured to fit the needs of the situation.
 We could, of course, lash out against
 the Vietcong or their allies with-all the
 overwhelming  strength  of  American
 arms.  We could bring to all of Indo-
 china-perhaps all of southeast Asia-
 the all-pervading peace and quiet of the
 graveyard.  This is a solution that is
 not open to us alone. If it were a mo-
 rally acceptable choice-which I ques-
 tion-it would still hardly be a strategi-
 cally sensible option.
 At the other extreme of the spectrum
 of choice lies paralysis or retreat.  We
 could let a healthy respect for what can
 happen degenerate into a craven fear
 of the consequences of any action at all.
 Hesitating-and  Mr.  Speaker,       we
 ought to hesitate-before we throw our-
 selves fully into an all out war, we could
 decide that no risks are worth such
 stakes.
 President Johnson has shown him-
 self to be able to steer capably between
 both these dangerous alternatives.  He
 has used force effectively. He has used
 it in a way and at a level calculated to
 make our position in southeast Asia crys-
 tal clear-and yet he has neither plunged
 over any brink himself, nor has he
 pushed our adversaries nearer to one.
 I am reminded, in these critical days,
 of the tense 2 weeks in October 1962,
 when John F. Kennedy was guiding the
 Nation-and the free world-through
 what we all knew could have been its
 ultimate crisis.  In those dramatic days,
 John F. Kennedy coolly weighed the al-
 ternatives, courageously prepared him-
 self to wield the mightiest weapons man
 has ever developed-and patiently sought
 a means by which those weapons might
 remain unused.
 He succeeded and his Vice President,
 who sat with him throughout that 2
 weeks, and who has now succeeded to
 those awful responsibilities-is follow-
 3351
 jag that same prudeist proud, and patient
 path.
 Lyndon. Johnson'_; task is, if anything,
 more difficult.  The nature, even the
 identity, of our enemy is more obscure.
 The strategic stakes and the tactical
 imperatives are less obvious.  In the
 Vietnamese crisis, to an even greater
 extent than in the Cuban missile crisis,
 the full facts, in all their intricacy, must
 of necessity, be known only by the Presi-
 dent and his immediate advisers.
 During the Cuban crisis, there was an
 outpouring of national dedication to the
 task ahead that must have been very
 encouraging  to  President  Kennedy.
 People who had, a week earlier, bitterly
 criticized the President, then picketed
 the White House in support of his stand.
 Without  knowing  of  and   drawing
 strength from, the ability of this great
 people to face whatever the dawn might
 bring, even the cool courage of John
 Fitzgerald Kennedy might not have been
 equal to the task.
 Today, with the stakes as great, with
 the need for patience, understanding,
 and courage even greater, the President
 of the United States deserves to be told
 that his countrymen are behind him.
 Debate and honest criticism are very
 much in order-as they always are
 among free men.
 But expressions of what I believe to
 be the sentiments of the great majority
 of the American people are also in order.
 Mr. Speaker, I hope this discussion will
 show the President-and the tough-
 minded adversaries he faces on our be-
 half-that his prudence meets our de-
 mands, his determination is matched by
 our readiness to support him, and his
 courage is rooted in that of a free people.
 Mr. MORGAN.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I yield to the dis-
 tinguished chairman of the Committee
 on Foreign Affairs.
 (Mr. MORGAN asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. MORGAN.  Mr. Speaker, the dis-
 tinguished gentleman from New Jersey
 is to be commended for securing this
 time to focus on U.S. policy and actions
 in Vietnam.  As chairman of the Foreign
 Affairs Committee, I have kept posted
 on developments In that troubled area,
 and I  am    personally  convinced  that
 President Johnson is cautiously follow-
 ing a course of action there which is
 aimed primarily at serving our long-
 range security interests and needs.
 The constant probing aggression of
 the Communist forces in Vietnam is proof
 of their savage and implacable resolve
 to impose their control in every area
 lacking strength to oppose their creep-
 ing conquest.  We are in South Vietnam
 because it is in our security interest to
 help these people retain their freedom
 from Communist aggression.  We are
 there at their request.
 Our President has wisely followed the
 course of firmness in Vietnam. He has
 demonstrated a strong desire to achieve
 a realistic peace on honorable terms.
 He has shown every wish to limit conflict
 and steer the conduct of operations in
 Vietnam toward the goal of peace.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE              February 24
 At the same time, the President has
 resisted premature demands for nego-
 tiations with the aggressors.  We would
 all like to see negotiations leading to
 peace, but to negotiate now would be to
 repeat and compound the folly that lead
 Chamberlain to compromise with Hitler.
 Neither our generation nor those that
 follow us can forget the terrible after-
 math of those futile negotiations.
 While the situation has deteriorated in
 Vietnam, we must remember that the
 people of that country have had a long
 history of disunity, and unlike t4e Brit-
 ish in India, the French, on departing,
 left no legacy of equipment for self-
 government. In spite of this, the strug-
 gle for freedom has gone on and in some
 respects has even improved recently.
 This is not the time to urge the Presi-
 dent to relax in the firmness of his policy.
 When the North Vietnamese give satis-
 factory assurances of a real desire for
 peace on honorable terms, there will be
 no problem in negotiating.  Until then,
 the President deserves and merits our
 strongest support in his efforts to win our
 goals in Vietnam. We must never allow
 ourselves to forget that this is but an-
 other of many Communist probes, in
 which they tirelessly seek to press their
 conquests in areas where the free world
 might fail to marshal its forces to stop
 them. If we let premature negotiations
 cost us the eventual, enslavement of
 South Vietnam, we can only look forward
 to a renewal and an escalation of Com-
 munist aggression in other areas.
 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this oppor-
 tunity to express my full confidence in
 our President, in the Secretary of De-
 fense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and in
 the bipartisan leadership who all stand
 united in support of U.S. policy in Viet-
 nam.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  Mr. Speaker, I
 thank the distinguished chairman of our
 committee.  At this time I yield to the
 gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Gnoss], a
 member ' of the Committee on Foreign
 Affairs.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 asked the gentleman to yield so that I
 may read a short two-paragraph news
 dispatch of this afternoon. It is as fol-
 lows :
 UNITED   NATIONS.-Secretary   General  U
 Thant disclosed today he had been engaged
 In private discussions for some time with the
 United States and other parties to the Viet-
 nam conflict and had made concrete pro-
 posals aimed at a negotiated settlement.
 He declined to disclose the nature of his
 proposals, but told a news conference he was
 confident a formula could be found which
 would end  the fighting and enable the
 United States to withdraw gracefully once
 stability has been achieved.
 Mr. Speaker, I wonder how this gentle-
 man injected himself into the picture in
 the nature of a peacemaker or an alleged
 peacemaker?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  Mr. Speaker, I
 thank the gentleman for his comments
 and observations. I think the statement
 he read reflects the desire of the admin-
 istration to leave South Vietnam when-
 evei^ the Communists decide to leave that
 nation to its freedom.  If the Commu-
 nists go on home and call off the war I
 am sure we would be happy to make a
 graceful exit.
 Mr. EDMONDSON.  Mr. Speaker, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Oklahoma.
 Mr. EDMONDSON.  Mr. Speaker, the
 gentleman from New Jersey has made a
 constructive and a 'statesmanlike speech,
 and I commend him for his firm state-
 ment of support for President Johnson's
 policy in Vietnam.
 I want to join the gentleman from
 New Jersey, and our distinguished ma-
 jority leader, in declaring my own sup-
 port for the President's strong stand in
 Vietnam, and for his declared determi-
 nation to prevent any expansion of Com-
 munist power in Asia.
 This is an issue on which all Americans
 should stand united, and on which we
 can have only one Commander in Chief-
 the President of the United States.
 Mr. MICHEL.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. GALLAGHER. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Illinois.
 Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to
 say to the gentleman from New Jersey
 that I appreciate his having taken this
 special order to open up the discussion
 of this subject matter.
 I do not happen to be one of those who
 feels that a discussion of this nature in
 the foreign policy field should be limited
 to the other body. It is a legitimate area
 for discussion in the House of Repre-
 sentatives.
 I am sorry that I did not get to hear
 all of the remarks of the gentleman from
 New Jersey but I believe in essence I
 heard the greater part of them. I hope
 the gentleman will correct me if I am
 in error, but the gentleman takes the
 position, does he not at this time, that he
 is opposed to our going into any nego-
 tiations at the present time and that the
 gentleman's position in a general way
 would be opposed to one of neutralizing
 the area?
 Mr. GALLAGHER. I believe that the
 gentleman from Illinois states the case
 with regard to my position on neutraliza-
 tion of South Vietnam.
 I believe that history has demonstrated
 that the course of neutralization merely
 means a new Communist campaign of
 insurgency to begin the next day in an-
 other country.
 I do not believe that it has ever been
 the policy of our country to refuse mean-
 ingful and honest negotiations. We are
 perhaps the greatest negotiators in his-
 tory. But I do not believe we should run
 to a conference table at which no one
 has yet taken seats. I believe if we panic
 ourselves into a position of negotiation,
 disregarding our moral obligation not to
 barter away another nation's freedom,
 that this in itself would be the greatest
 detriment to a diplomatic termination of
 the struggle now going on in Vietnam.
 Mr. MICHEL.  If the gentleman will
 yield further, I recall the gentleman's
 reference to the year of 1938 at the time
 of the partitioning of Czechoslovakia.
 I had occasion to look up the direct
 quote of Winston Churchill with ref-
 erence to that in which he said:
 The belief that security can be obtained.
 but by throwing a small state to the wolves.
 is a fatal delusion.
 Mr. Speaker, I feel that this state-
 ment is very apropos for the present day
 with respect to South Vietnam.
 Might I ask the gentleman from New
 Jersey, if he will yield further, if he
 feels, as I do, that before we go into any
 negotiations, we want to go into such
 negotiations from a position of strength"
 How does the gentleman feel we could
 strengthen our position in South Viet-
 nam in order to go to any kind of a con-
 ference table for a negotiation from that
 position of strength to which I am sure
 he referred?
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  I thank the gen-
 tleman for participating in this discus-
 sion as well as the other Members of this,
 body.  We are demonstrating staying
 power. The Communists seem to feel
 that we will grow tired and weary of the
 battle there and will withdraw. I think
 the    President   has   demonstrated
 strength, prudence, and a desire to pro-
 tect freedom.  He is demonstrating the
 staying power of the United States.
 Just today we have learned of the first
 use of heavy bombers in the fight in
 South Vietnam. So I think the demon-
 stration of our determination to remain
 there, if need be, is the best way to let
 the Communist leaders know that we
 mean business and, perhaps, they will
 then live up to the agreements to which
 they themselves were a party in 1954 and
 in 1962.
 Mr. MICHEL.  If the gentleman will
 yield further, I am sure the American
 people are somewhat concerned over
 these frequent turnovers of government
 and of generals themselves tossing out
 one another.
 Since the gentleman from New Jersey
 has just come back from that area, did
 he obtain any kind of impression as to
 whether or not the generals in the mili-
 tary themselves, the South Vietnamese,
 were wearying of the battle?  Is there
 still that determination from top to bot-
 tom among the military in South Viet-
 nam to the effect that the fight should
 continue to be joined?
 Mr. GALLAGHER. Strangely enough,
 when you leave Saigon in South Viet-
 nam and go out into the country you
 find a fierce determination on the level
 of field officers and company command-
 ers as well as the provincial governors
 to continue the fight.  These people are
 each day fighting and dying to protect
 their country and for the cause of free-
 dom.
 Of course, it is my own opinion-that
 until there is political stability in Saigon
 the military plans cannot move ahead
 in the field. In other words, if the field
 commander must keep one eye on Saigon
 and the other eye on the enemy, it is
 difficult for them to carry on the fight
 with maximum efficiency.
 I think the forces that are presently
 there are sufficient to do the job, but no
 job can be done well unless we have
 political stability in Saigon. So, I thin;
 that the generals and religious politi-
 cians should start putting their country
 ahead of their own personal feuds.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE              February 24
 Vietcong enlisted force Is recruited in the
 south, largely through intimidation, the
 hard core units, including most of the
 Vietcong leaders and technicians, are
 supplied from North Vietnam.
 The talk of neutralization and aban-
 donment of our commitment in south-
 east Asia gives new validity to the argu-
 ment of the Communists, that we will
 grow tired, impatient, and weary in Viet-
 nam and retire and leave the field to
 them and that their conquest will be won
 by default.
 It seems to me that this is the biggest
 impediment to a diplomatic termination
 of the agony of Vietnam.  Diplomatic
 termination will come only when we
 demonstrate our resolve to protect free-
 dom, and reassure them of our staying
 power.
 Our President has made it clear that
 we are willing to withdraw as soon as the
 foreign powers supporting the Vietcong
 leave the field and live up to commit-
 ments they agreed to in 1954 and 1962,
 which means a free nation in South
 Vietnam.
 Does such a thing exist as unilateral
 negotiation?  For if Peiping and Hanoi
 remain intractable in their right to sub-
 vert a free government in violation of
 our existing agreements, what is there to
 negotiate except the abandonment of
 freedom?  It would mean stepped-up
 military activity on their part and a need
 for an accommodation with the Com-
 munist powers by those who are now free
 in southeast Asia, as well as a defeat by
 default on our part.
 Can anyone seriously believe that neu-
 tralization of South Vietnam would not
 mean immediate Communist takeover
 there and a new battle beginning in
 Thailand the next day?
 The advocates of such a policy must
 understand that our abandonment of
 commitments  to protect freedom in
 southeast Asia is a recognition that we
 expect Communist China to absorb all
 of southeast Asia. Are we prepared for
 some future negotiations for the parti-
 tioning of Hawaii which is on the col-
 lision course of the Communists an their
 way to Seattle?
 Vietnam must be viewed in its military
 and political context and as its status
 relates to the whole of southeast Asia.
 I do not necessarily subscribe to the so-
 called falling domino theory, which to my
 mind is an oversimplification of the prob-
 lem.             I am certain, however, that aban-
 donment of South Vietnam to the Red
 hordes of China and North Vietnam,
 either through negotiation or withdrawal
 of military support, will lead to increased
 Communist pressures on the other coun-
 tries of southeast Asia and their eventual
 takeover by the Communists.
 We are not seeking in South Vietnam
 only to save a nation.  We are attempt-
 ing to hold a militarily strategic land

 TERCENTENARY  COMMISSION TO
 COMMEMORATE THE ADVENT AND
 THE   HISTORY   OF   FATHER
 JACQUES MARQUETTE IN NORTH
 AMERICA
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, I intro-
 duce, for appropriate reference, a joint
 resolution to establish a Tercentenary
 Commission to commemorate the historic
 presence of Father Jacques Marquette in
 North America.
 The function of the Commission will be
 to develop and execute suitable plans for
 the celebration of the 300th anniversary
 of the arrival of Father Marquette at
 Quebec on September 20, 1666. In con-
 junction with these plans, the Commis-
 sion, in cooperation with the Secretary of
 the Interior, will investigate the desir-
 ability, of establishing a permanent na-
 tional monument or memorial.
 Mr. President, Michigan is proud to
 claim Father Marquette as one of her
 own. Two years after his arrival in North
 America, he established a mission at
 Sault Ste. Marie.  Later in 1671 he
 founded the Mission of St. Ignatius at
 the Straits of Mackinac, and this re-
 mained his home until his death.
 Returning from a missionary trip to
 Illinois in 1675, he died on the eastern
 shore of Lake Michigan near the present
 city of Ludington.  He is buried in our
 State. Michigan rivers, counties, town-
 ships, cities, and streets proudly bear his
 name.
 But Father Marquette is known in
 American history for what he accom-
 plished beyond our boundaries.  Two
 hundred  and  ninety-two  years ago,
 Father Marquette and the renowned ex-
 plorer, Louis Joliet, set out to explore our
 continent's greatest river-the Missis-
 sippi. The histories say that on May 17,
 1673, Father Marquette and Joliet left
 St. Ignace with two bark canoes, five
 French guides, and a little smoked meat
 and Indian corn.
 In 4 months they descended the Missis-
 sippi to the mouth of the Arkansas,
 satisfied themselves that the river emp-
 tied into the Gulf of Mexico, and re-
 turned to St. Ignace-a journey of 3,000
 miles.  They brought back with them
 knowledge of America's greatest river
 and richest wilderness.
 Today as we puzzle the complex prob-
 lems of science, space, economic growth,
 and human relations, I believe it not in-
 appropriate that we give thought to those
 early  pioneers-among  them  Father
 Marquette-who met with determination
 and courage the basic and compelling
 challenges of their day-the exploration
 of a vast uncharted continent, and the
 planting in its rich soil of the tender
 shoots of civilization.
 Mr. President, I hope Congress will
 act to make possible an appropriate an-
 niversary observance in commemoration
 of Father Marquette's contributions to
 our country.

 Mr. MAGNUSON.  Mr.. President, by
 request, I submit an amendment, in-
 tended to be proposed by me, to the bill
 (S. 1053) to authorize appropriations for
 procurement of vessels and aircraft and
 construction of shore and offshore estab-
 lishments for the Coast Guard.  I ask
 unanimous consent that the amendment
 be printed in the RECORD, together with
 the letter from the Secretary of the
 Treasury requesting its submission.
 .The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.  The amendment will be received,
 printed, and appropriately referred' and,
 without objection, the amendment and
 the letter will be printed in the RECORD.
 The amendment (No. 43) was referred
 to the Committee on Commerce, as fol-
 lows:
 At the end of the bill insert the following
 new section:
 "SEC. 2. Any of the authority in the first
 section of this Act may be utilized for al-
 teration, addition, expansion, and extension
 to facilities acquired from any military de-
 partment: Provided, That the total cost of
 projects constructed under this section shall
 not exceed $5,000,000."
 The letter presented by Mr. MAGNUSON
 is as follows:
 THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY,
 Washington, February 17, 1965.
 The Honorable WARREN G. MAGNUSON,
 Chairman, Committee on Commerce,
 U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: On February 1, 1965,
 this Department transmitted to the Presi-
 dent of the Senate and the Speaker of the
 House  of Representatives  a  draft  bill  to
 authorize appropriations for procuement of
 vessels and aircraft and construction of shore
 and offshore establishments for the Coast
 Guard.  The draft bill was referred in the
 Senate to the Committee on Commerce and
 introduced by you as S. 1053 on February 9,
 1965,
 Since the submission of this bill, the pos-
 sibility has developed that the Coast Guard
 will acquire facilities which are to be closed
 or deactivated by the Department of Defense
 pursuant to the recent announcement of
 such closings throughout the United States,
 At least one such facility will be acquired by
 the Coast Guard when it is vacated by the
 Department of the Army and in connection
 with that acquisition, construction and re-
 habilitation to make the facility suitable
 for Coast Guard use is required.
 In  the  circumstances,  the  Department
 recommends the addition of the enclosed
 new section to S. 1053 in order to permit the
 Coast Guard to use funds authorized by the
 bill for the construction and rehabilitation
 required  at  this  facility.   Since  the  ac-
 quisition will" take place prior to the end
 of the next flscal_ year, it would be inex-
 pedient to await submission of the next au-
 thorization bill to provide for the necessary
 work.    The language of the section would
 establish  a maximum limit on  the  total
 amount of funds appropriated for acquisition,
 construction, and improvement which could
 be  used  for  the  work  contemplated. If
 necessary, these funds would be made avail-
 able through the deferment of projects which
 have previously been authorized.
 In support of this addition, information
 will be_furnished to the committee as to the
 projects which are intended to be accom.
 plished in a form similar to that for the
 items listed in the first section of the bill.
 Additionally, the Department will be pre-
 pared to submit any other available data that
 the committee or staff may require.
 An identical proposal has been transmitted
 to the chairman of the House Committee on
 Merchant Marine and Fisheries.
 The Department has been advised by the
 Bureau of the Budget that the proposed
 legislation  would  be  in  accord  with  the
 President's program.
 Sincerely yours,
 AMENDMENT OF INTER-AMERICAN
 DEVELOPMENT BANK ACT, RE-

 SPECIAL  OPERATIONS  OF  THE
 INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT
 BANK (AMENDMENT NO. 44)
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  Mr. President, I of-
 fer an amendment which I send to the
 desk.   The amendment  proposes to
 change the authorization for increased
 capital from the recommended sum in
 the bill of $900 million to a reduced sum
 of $480 million.
 Under my amendment the U.S. Gov-
 ernment would obligate itself to pay $200
 million a year for 2 years, instead of
 $250 million a year as provided in the
 bill now pending before the Senate.
 Mr. President, I ask that the amend.
 ment be printed.

 Mr. HARTKE.  Mr. President, in in-

 Senators from the three States involved.
 However, the name of the senior Senator
 from Kentucky [Mr. COOPER] was inad-

 sent to the Printer.  In order to correct
 the RECORD, and to make clear that my
 statement was correct, I ask unanimous
 consent that his name may be added at
 the next printing, as it should have been
 in the beginning, as one of the cosponsors
 of S. 1226.

 REFLECTIONS ON VIETNAM FACTS-
 ARTICLE BY ERIC SEVAREID
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the RECORD an article entitled "Re-
 flections on Vietnam Facts," written by
 Eric Sevareid, and published in the
 Washington Evening Star of February
 23.  In part, the article reads as follows:
 No vital facts arebeing withheld from us.
 The difficulty is that one set of facts falls
 from one side of the road, another set from
 the other side, and the result is a roadblock.
 February 24
 Elsewhere in his article, Mr. Sevareld
 says:
 There are no good solutions; there are only
 choices between evils, some of which, we must
 remember, are more evil than the existing
 evil.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 REFLECTIONS  ON VIETNAM  FACTS
 (By Eric Sevareid)
 My credentials as a card-carrying colum-
 nist and compulsive commentator would
 surely be revoked by what follows, If a com-
 mittee of professional censure existed in this
 calling.  Like all  those whose slow  brain
 must make the daily race with rapid events,
 I have periodically longed for a week, say,
 of enforced illness, be it at home, in a hos-
 pital, or jallhouse-a week for nothing but
 reading, listening, and reflection.  Ah, the
 mental mists that would melt away, the
 clarity that would emerge.
 Now  I  have  been  granted  the     blessed
 week-in a most accommodating hospital,
 ordered thence for rest and routine tests of
 minor ailments; and I have read, listened to,
 and thought about virtually nothing but
 Vietnam, in detail and in cosmic conse-
 quence.
 No, that is somewhat misleading.  What I
 have read, what I have listened to, are other
 men's reflections on Vietnam, and what I
 have found myself actually reflecting on is
 this mass of reflection.  I cannot recall an
 intellectual stalemate  quite like this one
 over  Vietnam  and     what  the  U.S.  course
 should be. An intellectual blockade, really,
 since the mass of suggestions, which run the
 gamut from A to B-from the preposterous
 to the dubious-confuse, in their totality,
 far more than they clarify.
 This is a prime example of the falsity of
 the cliche that if only the people are given
 the facts they will always find the road.  No
 vital facts are being withheld from us.    The
 difficulty is that one set of facts falls from
 one side of the road, another set from the
 other side, and the result is a roadblock.
 But our system ordains that writers must
 write, speakers must speak, and politicians
 must do both.  The net result amounts to a
 supreme example of what Voltaire meant by
 his remark: "The necessity of saying some-
 thing, the embarrassment produced by the
 consciousness of having nothing to say, and
 the desire to exhibit ability, are three things
 sufficient to render even a great man ridicu-
 lous."
 I find myself In the same predicament with
 the great.  I must say something since news-
 paper space, like nature, abhors a vacuum,
 but I can illuminate nothing.  If I feel less
 ridiculous about this than most, it may be
 because when I first began a career of utter-
 ing in public, the remarkable man who hired
 me, Ed Murrow, gave this unprecedented ad-
 vice, "When there is no news, just say so.
 When you are unsure of your facts, admit it.
 When you have no solution to offer, don't
 pretend otherwise.  Who knows, people might
 appreciate that."
 The only facts I feel sure about are mostly
 negative in nature-the heaviest conceivable
 bombing of the supply lanes from North Viet-
 nam will not stop the supplies, since there is
 always the night and the brush; even a very
 large American air- and road-oriented ground
 force will not destroy a guerrilla force; pin-
 prick bombing Inside North Vietnam will not
 seriously injure them militarily or weaken
 their will; saturation bombing of North Viet-
 namese barbers, railways, bridges, and fac-
 tories may produce favorable political results
 (it may also bring a mass infantry Invasion
 of South Vietnam), but we would kill hun-
 dreds of women and children in the process;
 negotiation for a neutral and unified Viet-
 nam is a hopeless Idea, since it implies ask-

 ' Mr.  LIPPMANN. He has changed them, I  from lots of people, De Gaulle is like a man
 think, and changed them for the better.  who can't see very clearly what's right in
 After the World War, and up to President front of him, who sees pretty well what's
 Johnson's time, the United States was not
 only the protector of Europe, the defender,
 military protector, but it was the banker,
 and it was the general political and moral
 boss, superintendent at least, of Europe.
 And in the course of that, we got ourselves
 very badly entangled,. first with the British,
 who thought they were our special friend,
 resulted in their being excluded from the
 Common  Market, by General  de  Gaulle.
 Then we got into a tangle with the Germans,
 who thought they were the special favorites
 of the United States.  In those days, Chan-
 cellor Adenauer was the Chancellor of Ger-
 many.  He was our chief adviser on Euro-
 pean affairs.
 We oughtn't  to      have  special  favorites
 among our Allies, and President Johnson,
 who has kept on excellent terms with the
 British, and with the Germans, has ended
 that. And the key to that whole business,
 that came over this proposal to create a
 multilateral  mixed-manned  nuclear  fleet,
 which the Germans would have owned 40
 percent of, and that aroused fury all over-
 in France, among all the people who fear
 Germany, and there are a great many people
 who still fear Germany in Europe, all over
 Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union,
 and he put that on ice, he suspended that.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Is this what you once called
 masterly inactivity?
 Mr.  LIPPMANN. Masterly inactivity.  You
 see, when you are no longer needed as the
 leader of Europe, then the right thing to do
 is to stop trying to lead it.  Let Europe de-
 velop in its own way, which is I think going
 quite satisfactorily.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Is it going in the direction
 of a more cohesive united Europe?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Yes; it's going in the direc-
 tion of the breaking down of the Iron Cur-
 tain, between the two halves of Europe.
 This is a process of trade, and sport and cul-
 tural communication between the two halves
 of Europe.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Do you think we could have
 arrived at that rather favorable point had
 ewe not taken the great leadership for many
 years, had we not had all these troops in
 Europe?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. We had to do it.  It was
 under our protection, and with our finan-
 cial help, that Europe recovered, but it has
 recovered.  It's like a family, you have to
 recognize that the child has grown up, it
 has grown up and you can't treat it as if it
 were a baby.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, in Germany
 now, there seems to be a revival of interest
 in the reunification of that country;- Do you
 see this coming about?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. I think it's going to come.
 I'm not surprised at the revival of interest,
 because Germany without, divided as it is,
 not even in possession of its own capital, is
 a sick country.  It's done very *ell economi-
 cally, but politically, it's sick.  And it will
 never be well until St's reunified.  The re-
 unification can come about, I think, only by
 the process I was  talking  about,   by the
 gradual weaving together of the two parts
 of Europe.  When that has taken place, Ger-
 many will be reunited in the process.
 Mr. SEVAREID. President de Gaulle is now
 the }ast of the great wartime leaders of the
 West, and the most powerful political per-
 sonality in Europe.  Why don't we get along
 with  him  better? Who  misunderstands
 whom?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Well, there's a good deal of
 misunderstanding both ways, I don't doubt.
 Memories of the war.  He and President
 Roosevelt didn't get on. He and Churchill
 had difficulties, but they got on better'than
 President Roosevelt and De Gaulle.  But the
 basic difficulty about De Gaulle, 't find' this
 across the room, or halfway down the street,
 but who sees absolutely perfectly what's in
 the distance., He has the farthest vision, he
 can see further, than any man in our time,
 and  I  don't  even  exclude  Churchill.  De
 Gaulle foresaw, at the worst moment in the
 fall of France, how in the end, the war would
 be won; namely, by the coming in of Russia
 and the United States.  That kind of vision
 is very annoying to public men who don't see
 that far.
 On the other hand, the fact that he doesn't
 see very clearly in front of him, and stumbles
 over the furniture, is very annoying too, and
 kicks their shins, as he goes, that sort of
 thing.   But  that's  the  problem  and  the
 genius of his vision is so important.  For in-
 stance, he has foreseen, and we have fol-
 lowed-we didn't take it from him, but we
 are following the same policy by the same
 logic-he has foreseen, that the reunification
 of Germany and of Europe, would have to
 come about through increasing connections
 with Eastern Europe, between East and West
 Europe.  He's doing that.  He's been much
 closer to the East Europeans than anybody.
 Well, we're doing that too.  In the Far
 East, it is very annoying to us that he recog-
 nized China.  It was a sign of very great
 vision, to see that there'd never be peace in
 the Far East until it was made with China.
 You can't make it with anybody else, and
 that kind of thing is the cause of the diffi-
 culty.
 Mr. SEVAREID. You think President Johnson
 ought to personally meet with President de
 Gaulle any time soon?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. I'm in no hurry for that.
 I don't think they're built to understand
 each other too well.  I think they'd better
 meet through very skillful ambassadors.
 Mr.  SEVARIED. Apparently  the  President
 wants to go to Europe sometime soon, and
 to Russia too. Do you think the time is really
 ripe for that? .
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Well, if he asked my ad-
 vice, which he hasn't, I would not advise
 him to go.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Why not?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. I'd advise him to get the
 Great Society going in this country, and we
 have something in the bank to talk about.
 His style isn't the style that Europeans natu-
 rally understand, this old-fashioned Ameri-
 can style, and I wouldn't think he'd do too
 well, and I don't think you can accomplish
 anything by face-to-face talk with a man like
 De Gaulle, or with a man like Kosygin.
 Mr. SEVAREID. It's just a mass public rela-
 tions exercise.
 Mr. LLPPMANN. It will be public relations,
 and too many reporters, and too many cam-
 eras,  and  too  many  everything,  and  it
 wouldn't work, and they'd all say things that
 they'd wish they hadn't said, when it's over.
 So I'm in favor of the President staying home.
 If he wants to travel I think he might go to
 South America, one or two trips.  That might
 be useful.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, if the Presi-
 dent does go to Russia, he'll find a new regime
 now, Mr. Khrushchev gone since we last had
 these conversations.  Why do you think he
 did go, and what's different about this new
 regime?
 Mr.   LIPPMANN. Well,   I  don't  know.  I
 haven't been to Russia. I don't think-the
 cards are not face up on the table. We can't
 read it clearly. If you look at the underlying
 forces, Kosygin has just as great an interest
 as Khrushchev had first of all, in avoiding
 nuclear war with the United States, and also,
 an interest in getting better relations with
 Eastern Europe, and the Western World for
 'economic reasons. I'm told by everybody I've talked to, and
 I've only talked to one relative of one of the
 new rulers of Russia, who was here on a
 scholarship, they got tired of Khrushchev's
 inefficiency, and his wildness.  He promised
 things  that  he  hadn't  the    authority  to
 promise.  And that was the reason they said
 let's  get this  more  organized,  and    more
 orderly, and the very noticeable fact is that
 first, they've divided Khrushchev's jobs into
 two jobs.  Khrushchev was both Secretary
 of the Communist Party, which was consid-
 ered the most powerful job, and the other
 job, he was Prime Minister of the Soviet
 Union, or Chairman of whatever they call it.
 Now they have two men, Kosygin and Brezh-
 nev, and it's very interesting, they no longer
 travel together.  They don't go to foreign
 countries together as in the early days be-
 fore Khrushchev got the both jobs, he used
 to travel around with his other man.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Bulganin.
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Bulganin.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Well, I suppose one of these
 two men must be the prevailing one even-
 tually.
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Unless there's been a change
 and this-Russia is evolving unless the evolu-
 tion is that the Communist Party is no long-
 er the militant  world  party that  it was
 when Khrushchev first came into power.
 Mr. SEVAREID. The established church in-
 stead of church militant, in other words.
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Yes.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, about Great
 Britain, I think you were there recently.
 There seems to be a feeling of deep crisis
 about  that  country.   Financial  crisis  for
 one thing, a government with a bare ma-
 jority in Parliament, what is really hap-
 pening with them?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. There is a deep crisis in
 Great Britain, and it may be that the his-
 torians will say that it was Labor Party's
 misfortune to come into power too soon, be-
 cause                                                                                                                              the things that prevent the Labor
 Party from doing what it says it wants to do,
 and may be able to do which is to revivify
 Great Britain from within;  its industrial
 life, and its technology and its education, is
 postponed because they're still dealing with
 the remnants of their Empire out in Malaya,
 all the way from Aden to Singapore, and with
 the remnants of their old sterling area, which
 is a remnant from the days when London
 was the banker of the world.  Now Labor
 is having the job of dealing with that, and
 that's a job that should be done by Conserva-
 tives.  That's their business.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, did you fol-
 low the Churchill funeral ceremonies on tel-
 evision?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. I did.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Well, what was the real sig-
 nificance in your mind of the enormous emo-
 tional impact of this?  Merely the man as a
 personality, great turning point in British
 history? What was it?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Oh, I think the fundamen-
 tal emotion here, at least the one I felt,
 and I assume that other people-was one of
 immense gratitude to this man who had
 saved the world from nazism, and fascism.
 That's one of the great achievements of a
 single man in modern history.
 Mr. SEVAREID. You mean, he did this?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. He did that. Without him,
 there was no reason to think that Great
 Britain could have resisted, or would have
 resisted.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Well, did the funeral of this
 man represent in a sense the burial of the
 British lion that the world has known for
 300 years, everywhere in the world?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Well, I've heard people say
 that, but I don't think we're in a position
 to make any such-reach any such conclu-
 sion here.  I don't think so.  I remember a
 song of Beatrice Lillie, "There's Life in the
 Old Girl Yet," and we'll probably see that.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Were you particularly upset
 about the fact that the Vice President did
 not go to the funeral?

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE             February 2ri
 Mr. LIPPMANN. No, I think the President
 made a mistake about this, when he couldn't
 go himself.  I think he was too sick. His
 head wasn't clear enough to have done the
 obvious and right thing to do, which was
 to appoint General Eisenhower as his per-
 sonal representative.  Eisenhower was al-
 ready invited by Lady Churchill to come to
 the funeral, but he should have been the
 American representative.  He was the man
 who  was  Supreme Commander  under
 Churchill, he had been President twice, he
 was the man. There was too much con-
 fusion in the White House to think out
 the right thing. I don't blame the President
 for not wanting the Vice President to leave
 when he himself was sick.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, a moment ago
 you said that the President, before he goes
 abroad, ought to get the Great Society pro-
 gram really' working.  How do you define
 this program, the Great Society?  What's
 the essence of it?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Well, I think the best way
 to answer that is to say how it differs from
 the New Deal, the Fair Deal, or the Square
 Deal, of all those deals, that have preceded
 it.  All of those older deals were based on the
 assumption that the amount of wealth in
 the country was more or less fixed, and that
 in order to help the poor, or to educate peo-
 ple or to do anything, you had to divide the
 wealth, take away from the well-to-do, and
 give it either to the Government or to the
 poor or somebody.  That's why it's called a
 New Deal.  It's the same pack, but you deal
 it differently-or a Square Deal, and so on.
 Now, the Great Society is a result of a
 revolution that's occurred, a silent and be-
 neficent revolution that's occurred in our
 generation, under which, we have learned
 not perfectly, because it's very difficult-it's
 a new art, we have learned how to control,
 regulate and promote  the production of
 wealth in an advanced industrial society like
 our  own.  We are able to produce more
 wealth by putting on taxes, interest rates, and
 all the budgetary arrangements that we use,
 and make the thing grow, and we finance the
 new developments, education and everything
 that we talk about in the Great Society, the
 beautifying of cities, and everying of that
 sort out of the taxes on the increase of
 wealth that we're able to produce.  We in-
 creased the wealth, the product of the United
 States by-I don't know-30 billions last
 year.  The taxes on that will pay for the
 whole of the Great Society, and nobody is
 any poorer, everybody's richer.  Now, that is
 what the Great Society-that's its basis.
 Mr. SEvAREID. Well, what's the single most
 important aspect  of  the  President's  pro-
 gram?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. It's education, because it's
 like a vestibule from which all the corridors
 lead out,  unless you have education you
 cannot take away from the poorest part of
 the population, the thing which keeps them
 poor, their inability to-they haven't learned
 enough and been trained enough to keep a
 good job, to do a good job.  It also leads to
 research, to production of people to increase
 the scientific knowledge and the technical
 knowledge.   It's the basic of making the
 democracy work.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, do you agree
 with the claims of some people in the press,
 that President Johnson in trying to govern
 by consensus, so to speak, is refusing to
 spend any of his political capital; that he
 doesn't want to lose any of his mass public
 support; that a great President ought to be
 more courageous on that score.  Do you feel
 that way?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. On the contrary, I think
 he's just-I am in entire sympathy with
 him.  It applies internally.  Now, when you
 get abroad, that's another question.  But
 within the country, the only real way to
 solve a problem like, for Instance, the racial
 problem, is by having an overwhelming ma-
 jority in favor of enforcement of civil rights.
 Unless you get--a concensus, really means
 that about between 65 and 75 percent of the
 people are in favor of the policy, that's really
 what it means.  Not everybody's going to be
 in favor of it, and that's what the President
 had-he was in that range, when he was
 elected-and that's what he's trying to con-
 serve.  And he's quite right to conserve it.
 He will, if anybody can solve the civil rights
 problem in the United States, It will be done
 that way, having the law, enforcing the law,
 but getting observance of the law by con-
 sent, voluntary consent, by a great mass of
 people.
 The same is true of capital and labor.
 You can't solve them, except by a consensus,
 and the same is true of this whole argument
 that we heard so much about, about the
 welfare state, and what do you do for the
 poor, and what do you do for the rich and
 all that.  Now, consensus politics is possible
 only in a society which has reached the kind
 of revolutionary condition  that we have,
 where we can control the output of wealth.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, most of us
 don't think of President Johnson as a philos-
 opher in any formalized sense, or an ideo-
 logist in any sense, what's the secret of his
 appeal to the people?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. The root basis of it is that
 he is really one of them, to a degree, which
 very few Presidents in recent times have
 been.  He  doesn't  have  to  be  told  what
 simple Americans, farmers, businessmen, are
 thinking.  He already feels it himself.  It's
 in him, and they know he feels it, and that's
 what   gives-that  creates  the  relationship
 between them.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Well, does he have that qual-
 ity of appreciation instinctively, more than
 President Kennedy, or President Eisenhower?
 Mr.    LIPPMANN. He does    indeed.   If you
 think of their careers, as compared with his,
 you'll see that they were as compared with
 Johnson, outsiders, coming into the political
 life of this country.  But he's right in the
 heart of it, where it grows, and the thing
 is in him.  He doesn't have to be taught it.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, since we last
 had one of these conversations, we had quite
 a considerable national election.  The Re-
 publican Party, in terms of offices held at all
 levels in the country, is at its lowest point in
 about 30 years.  Are we In danger of a one
 party system here?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. No, we're in no danger of
 having a one party system.  We may have
 a condition which we've had several times
 before in our history when one party was
 predominant for a generation. But theparty
 system always revives in a free country and
 we're a free country, so there's no danger.
 The problem is for the other party to mean
 something  and  correct  its mistakes.  The
 great mistake of the Republican Party since
 the time of Theodore Roosevelt, is that it
 quarreled with the intellectual community
 in the-United States, and they all went over
 to the Democrats and that gave the Demo-
 crats an intellectual capacity for dealing with
 issues that the Republicans simply didn't
 have.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. Lippmann, this is the
 20th year since the birth of the United Na-
 tions.  President  Kennedy  I  think,  once
 called it the keystone of our foreign policy.
 Most people in the world seem to have great
 hopes for it.  What do you think now about
 its present condition, and its prospects?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Well, I think it's in great
 difficulties.  It's going through a crisis.  The
 League of Nations and the United Nations,
 these two versions of the same idea, both
 required before they could operate success-
 fully, that peace should be made.  The rea-
 son the League of Nations failed was that
 it couldn't make a peace, it needed to have a
 peace to keep. The same is happening to the
 United Nations.  It's in the grave difficulty
 because there's no peace In Europe from the
 Second World War, Berlin, you know, the
 occupation, division, and there's no peace in
 Asia, and I don't expect that the United
 Nations can make that peace, the great
 powers have got to make the peace.
 After It's made, and on the basis of its
 being made, the United Nations can function
 to keep it from tipping over and keeping
 order and balance and the question is, I
 think, it's the crucial question for not merely
 for the United Nations but for the world, is
 whether we can bridge these next years cf
 10, 15 years without war, in which case the
 United Nations will survive, and so will the
 peace of the world.
 Mr. SEVAREID. But surely there will always
 in this revolutionary time, be outbreaks of
 one kind or another in many, many places.
 Mr. LIPPMANN. There'll be outbreaks and,
 of course, the world is In ferment, and mov-
 ing very rapidly, but the great power con-
 frontations, which are a very different thing
 from rioting, even in the Congo, or a place
 like that, those great power confrontations
 have to be put in order, in some balance that
 is acceptable to the g-eat powers.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Would any institutional re-
 organization of the United Nations be of
 much value?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Well, I think we made a
 great mistake about the United Nations In,
 I forget the year, I think it was about 1948.
 We had wanted to use the United Nations to
 prevent wars and troubles breaking out, anti
 the Soviet Union vetoed everything, and we
 wanted to get around the veto, and so we
 decided let's give  the power to  keep the
 peace to the General Assembly, where we
 then had a perfectly clear and certain ma-
 jority.  Now, that is the decision which the
 Soviet Union is rebelling against.   That's
 why they won't pay their dues, because they
 won't admit that the General Assembly ever
 had the right to raise an army and use it
 for peacekeeping purposes, and we admit Ir.
 theory that actually, we don't want to have
 the General Assembly commit us to go into
 war anywhere.  We're willing to, theoreti-
 cally, we're not really arguing with the Rus-
 sians.  We're just saying these were the rules
 The U.N. is bankrupt, Congress won't appro-
 priate money, if you don't pay up, if we pay
 all the bills, pay up and then we'll go on
 from there.  That's the situation as I under-
 stand It.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Would there be any great
 advantage in putting the decisive power back
 in the Security Council?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. The only advantage of it is
 that that's the only place you can put de-
 cisive   power.  When  you  have  decisive
 power, you have to give a veto.  The Sen-
 ate of the United States would never have
 ratified the charter if we hadn't had a veto.
 And if the Senate of the United States were
 asked to day, would you be willing to go to
 war, because 75 of the 112 nations in the
 General Assembly voted you to go, but you
 didn't want to go, would you go?  Well, of
 course you wouldn't go.
 Mr. SEVAREID. Well, the whole affair in the
 Congo beginning 1960, when the U.N. tried
 to intervene and stabilize it, this has dam-
 aged the U.N. In more than financial ways
 certainly.  But what about Africa and this
 central part of it, the Congo?  How far ought
 we to go in trying to stabilize that place?
 Mr. LIPPMANN. Well, we've always known,
 we knew then back in, when was it, 1960,
 whenever it was that the Congo was liberated,
 or made independent, we knew then that
 we didn't want to get in there.  We were
 afraid that the Russians would come in and
 therefore we turned to the United Nations,
 and asked Dag Hammarskjold to take care
 of the Congo, keep it in order so that we
 wouldn't  get  involved  and  the Russians
 wouldn't get involved.   And that's how the
 United Nations got in there, and that was
 done  successfully  for  quite a  long  time.
 The original idea of giving it the United
 Nations was correct.  The United States has

 victory, and this was literally true. It ought
 to be remembered that this was the first
 step of the offensive against Japan, and that
 the forces under Admiral Nimitz' command,
 from Tarawa to Iwo, never took a backward
 step.
 A RARE CHARACTERISTIC
 This characteristic of Admiral. Nimitz, of
 ranging from thb benign and  gentle to
 heights of resolution, of accepting terrible
 costs in order to win a necessary objective,
 is a very rare one.  It was noted in Abra-
 ham Lincoln by Carl Sandburg in an ad-
 dress before a joint session of Congress on
 Lincoln's  birthday, February  12,  in  1959.
 Sandburg referred to Lincoln as a man "of
 both steel and velvet * * * as hard as a rock
 and soft as drifting fog." The analogy is ap-
 plicable to Chester William Nimitz as well.
 As Mark Van Doren, the playwright, said of
 Lincoln: "He was gentle but this gentleness
 was combined with a terrific toughness, an
 Iron strength."
 Looking back now on how swiftly things
 happened after that memorable Christmas
 Day in 1941 which marked the Admiral's ar-
 rival, it seems amazing that so much could
 have been achieved so soon.  Six weeks after
 that Christmas Day, Adm. William F. Halsey
 was in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands with
 a task force compiled out of the slender
 resources left to the fleet. Within less than
 6 months the Battle of Midway would be
 fought, the great turning point of the Pa-
 cific War in which Japan lost fighting ships
 and aircraft it could never replace.  Japan
 actually lost the war at Midway. Six months
 Is not a long time from the desperate plight
 of late December to one of the greatest sea
 battles of all time, in which men who had
 never been in action fought with superb gal-
 lantry to break the back of Japanese sea-
 power.
 To go back to the beginning, Admiral
 Nimitz was seated in his home in Washing-
 ton early in the afternoon of December 7,
 1941, listening to Toscanini conduct the Na-
 tional Broadcasting Co. orchestra.  In his
 own words, "There was a pause in the pro-
 gram and a flash: `Pearl Harbor had been
 attacked by the Japanese'-and this report
 was repeated several times."
 TO DUTY STATIONS
 "In a very few minutes the Assistant Chief
 of the Bureau of Navigation, Rear Adm. Jack
 Shafroth, who lived nearby (Admiral Nimitz
 was then the officer in charge of the Bureau
 which is now known as the Bureau of Per-
 sonnel) called me and said he would join me
 to go down to our duty stations at the Navy
 Department."  They found the old Navy De-
 partment on Constitution Avenue buzzing
 with excitement.  Hundreds of telegrams and
 telephone calls were pouring in from anxious
 parents and relatives of personnel in the
 Navy and Marine Corps at Pearl Harbor. This
 situation continued for many days and Ad-
 miral Nimitz and his assistants spent most
 of their time trying to establish current lists
 of casualties and notifying next of kin.  Also
 during this period, a number of Congressmen
 came in to enlist in the Navy.
 Again, in Admiral Nimitz' own words: "On
 the 16th of December, I was called to the
 Office of the Secretary of the Navy, Frank
 Knox, who asked me how soon I could travel.
 To this I responded that it depended on
 where I was going and how long I would be
 away.  Then he told me he had just returned
 from a conference with President Roosevelt
 where it had been decided that I was to go
 out to Pearl Harbor to take command of what
 was left of the Pacific Fleet."
 The President, it developed, had decided
 that a relief for Adm. Husband E. Kimmel as
 commander In chief, Pacific, was imperative.
 The reason was that the Roberts Commission,
 headed by Assistant Justice Owen J. Roberts
 Of the U.S. Supreme `Court, had already pro-
 ceeded to Pearl Harbor and begun an investi-
 gation of the entire situation.  Mr. Roose-
 velt decided that it would be inconceivable
 to have Admiral Kimmel in command at the
 same time that he was under investigation
 and hence had relieved him.
 In response to Admiral Nimitz' question
 as to where he was going and how long
 he would stay, Colonel Knox had a ready
 answer.  He told the admiral that he would
 go and stay as long as necessary to bring
 the war to a successful conclusion.
 It was characteristic of Admiral Nimitz
 that his first concern on reaching Pearl Har-
 bor was the officers under whose command
 the United States had suffered the most
 tragic defeat in its history.   He inherited
 three staffs, those of Admiral Kimmel, Vice
 Adm. William S. Pye, and Rear Adm. Milo S.
 Draemel.  Says Admiral Nimitz today, "These
 were all fine men but they had just under-
 gone a terrible shock and it was my first
 duty to restore morale and to salvage these
 fine officers for further use and this I pro-
 ceeded to do."
 Having been told of his mission, Admiral
 Nimitz proceeded as thoughtfully and with-
 out undue haste as though he were under-
 taking an ordinary mission instead of one
 that would require Herculean powers of pa-
 tience, faith, and resolution.  Before leav-
 ing Colonel Knox's office he told the Secre-
 tary that he should have a relief in the
 office of the Bureau of Navigation who could
 take over without a long period of indoc-
 trination.  He suggested Rear Adm. Randall
 Jacobs, who had been Admiral Nimitz' As-
 sistant Chief of Bureau until a short time
 before the attack.   At first Colonel Knox
 demurred, partly  because  Admiral  Jacobs
 had just taken command of the Atlantic
 Fleet Base Force. But he finally agreed and
 when Admiral Nimitz left Colonel Knox's
 office he ran into Admiral Jacobs in the cor-
 ridor.  He took him by the arm, led him to
 his own desk, and Informed him that he
 was thenceforth Chief of the Bureau of Navi-
 gatton.
 Thereafter occurred 2 days of confused
 and hurried packing, as Admiral Nimitz de-
 scribes it, and then the railway trip from
 Washington to San Diego which put him in
 San Diego on December 22.
 "I needed that railroad journey," says Ad-
 miral Nimitz, "to catch up on my sleep and
 collect my thoughts.   Stormy weather de-
 layed my departure from San Diego until
 December 24, when I took off and landed
 at Pearl Harbor In the early forenoon of
 December 25.
 "I found the lochs covered with oil one-
 half inch thick from the sunken ships.
 Many boats were hurrying back and forth be-
 tween the wrecks and the peninsula.  I was
 met by Rear Adm. P. N. L. Bellinger, the
 Pacific Fleet aviation officer, who informed
 me that the boats were picking up drowned
 sailors and marines from ships and taking
 their bodies to a central point on the penin-
 sula.
 "I was met at the landing by Admiral Pye
 who escorted me to the quarters that I oc-
 cunied during the time I was in Pearl Harbor
 before I shifted headquarters to Guam (in
 1944).   When  I  asked  who  lived  in  the
 quarters with me, Pye said, 'Nobody.' I then
 invited him to come In and, over his protest,
 made him eat a second breakfast while I had
 mine.    Thus was my cheerful reception at
 Pearl Harbor on Christmas Day, 1941."
 Nobody recognized better than Admiral
 Nimitz the tremendous task he was under-
 taking or the colossal responsibility pressed
 upon him.  I had remarked in my letter to
 him that our military situation in the Pacific
 was  "chaotic"  after  the  attack  on  Pearl
 Harbor.  That, said Admiral Nimitz in his
 reply, was definitely an understatement. He
 added:
 "From the  time  the  Japanese     dropped
 those bombs on December 7 until at least 2
 months later, there was hardly a day passed
 that the situation did not get more chaotic
 and confused and appear more hopeless. The
 decision at the highest level of government
 to concentrate on the defeat of Germany,
 while holding off Japan, was a wise one and
 was well understood by all of us who had
 to carry on the war In the Pacific.
 "The several errors made by the Japanese
 on December 7, 1941, helped very materially
 to shorten the war.  Their failure to come
 back a second day to destroy our repair fa-
 cilities at the Navy yard and to burn our
 41/2 million barrels of fuel oil in surface tanks
 was a most serious error.  These tanks could
 have  been  destroyed  by  machinegunning
 them with 50-caliber incendiary machine-
 gun bullets.
 "Likewise,  the  Japanese  made  an  even
 more serious error on December 7 by leav-
 ing our submarine base on Quarry Point free
 from attack. As a consequence, no subma-
 rines or supporting equipment were damaged
 and submarines could proceed immediately
 to stations in the far western Pacific and
 start their long campaign of destruction of
 the Japanese merchant marine which we-
 a primary factor in the defeat of Japan.  The
 submarines sank in excess of 75 percent of
 Japanese merchant marine shipping.
 "At the time of the attack on December 7,
 there was under construction at Red Hill,
 back of Pearl Harbor, an underground bomb-.
 proof storage for all petroleum products. At
 that time In the Atlantic, allied tankers were
 the principal targets of the German sub-
 marines and you need only check the figures
 for 1941 and 1942 of the Atlantic losses to
 see  what  might  have  happened  had  the
 Japanese destroyed the 41/2 million barrels of
 oil we had on the surface at Pearl Harbor.
 "For me, meantime, after my arrival on
 Christmas morning of 1941, I sweated blood
 until the underground   bombproof storage
 was complete and our oil supply safely piped
 therein.  Had our oil supply been destroyed,
 and considering the tremendous shortage of
 fuel  and petroleum  production,  generally,
 in Europe, it would have taken years to re-
 establish that supply and would have de-
 layed our Pacific war accordingly.                                                                                                                                      Had our
 Pearl Harbor installations for repairs been
 destroyed, our fleet would have been forced
 back to- the west coast of the United States
 for support, another item which would have
 prolonged the war.
 "So in spite of the reverses we suffered on
 December 7, 1941, there were some spots on
 which we could congratulate ourselves on
 our luck."
 There was further cause for rejoicing t.,i
 the fact that the Japanese had made the at-
 tack on our fleet while it was inside Pearl
 Harbor.  Had the fleet been at sea, Admiral
 Kimmel would certainly have tried to force
 a battle to bring into play the powerful arma-
 ment that our battleships carried.  However,
 Admiral Nimitz points out, these ships would
 have been limited to a maximum speed of
 about 18 knots while the Japanese task force
 had a fleet speed of 22 knots.
 This difference in speed would have im-
 posed on Admiral Kimmel a tremendous dis-
 advantage.  He could not have forced a fleet
 engagement until the Japanese commander
 was ready for it.
 Furthermore, said Admiral Nimitz:
 "The Japanese Task Force that came to
 Pearl Harbor that day had six aircraft car-
 riers whereas Admiral Kimmel had none--
 the Lexington being far to the westward on
 another mission.  Imagine, if you can, what
 would have happened to our slower battle-
 ships in such an action with the aircraft of
 six carriers working on them and with our
 fleet having no air cover at all.  Remember
 that on December 7, the Japanese destroyed
 all of the aviation strength of the Army
 Navy, and Marine Corps on Oahu.     Instead
 of losing some 3,700 to 3,800 men as we did at
 Pearl Harbor, we would have lost by drowin-

 1965                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Here was the patriarch of Wyoming-a
 gentle, smiling, green-eyed Irishman who had
 seen the whole transition from playing games
 with Sioux Indian kids outside the stockade
 of Camp Carlin where he was born August 7,
 1877, to Carlin's Atlas missiles burrowed in
 silos on the perimeter of Cheyenne.
 Here was Mr. Wyoming-the beloved T. Joe
 whose acquaintances ranged from Chief Sit-
 ting Bull to J.F.K. and L.B.J., popes and
 potentates, and princes.
 Here was a frontiersman who lived with
 Indians  before  they  were  subdued,  who
 helped freight the plains, who ranched, who
 was a sheriff, who tamed the old cattle wars,
 who helped found Cheyenne and to make it
 great, who gave the world a wild and wooly
 kind of entertainment called the rodeo, who
 gave literature a new set of romantic and
 symbolic western terms, whose sunset years
 were spent in dedication to the orphanage
 he helped found in 1927 at Torrington, Wyo.
 And T. Joe became part of Colorado, too.
 He had more friends, in Denver and Colorado
 than he had in Wyoming just because there
 are more people here.  It is significant that
 when T. Joe was made a chief of the Crow
 Indian tribe, they named him well-Chief
 Travels Well Known.
 God blessed him with strength of body
 and spirit to allow him a life of almost nine
 decades-years filled with sadness, tribula-
 tion, and much joy.  We know that Chief
 Travels Well Known will be well received in
 There are cavalry horns, rowels, spurs,
 peace pipes, headresses he got in tribal cere-
 monies, wampuum, fire horns, badges from
 the most famous firemen and policemen of
 his times.
 The cowboy art and photographs are price-
 less-pictures of the early pokes of the 2-Bar
 Warren Ranch at Chugwater, the Y Cross at
 Horse Creek, Charlie Irwin's Y-6.  The pic-
 tures                                                                        of  the  first  rodeos  with  the  early
 greats-Thad Sowder, Harry Brennan, Sam
 Scobey,  Clayton Danks, Bill  Pickett, Will
 Rogers, and Buffalo Bill Cody.
 I hear talk Cheyenne wants to do some-
 thing with T. Joe's home, the basement of
 which is filled with these priceless histori-
 cal treasures.                                                                      Why not take it over and

 Neither Yates nor NBC executives will dis-
 cuss the cost of this 1-hour program.                                                    It
 was as expensive as any television documen-
 tary ever made.                                                                                                                                    But whatever the cost, the
 results are worth the money.
 What  Yates,  along  with  Writer Calvin
 Tomkins,  Cameramen  Dexter  Alley and
 Richard Norling, and Film Editor Georges
 Klotz have succeeded in doing is to make
 every viewer a participant in that transcon-
 tinental journey.
 There is a lot of blood in the show. Buf-
 falo were killed, antelope were shot and one
 silver tipped grizzly bear died.  One might,
 with validity, object to the gore, until he
 remembers that this program is supposed to
 create the sights, sounds and the attitude of
 a more violent time.
 The narrator is Lorne Green, the man with
 the rich voice who is known as Ben Cart-
 wright on "Bonanza."  His work on "The
 Journals of Lewis and Clark" reminds us,
 once more, that Greene was Canada's top an-
 nouncer before he took up acting and resi-
 dence on the Ponderosa.
 Yates, who grew up in Sheridan, Wyo., used
 the program to make observations on topics
 about which he feels quite strongly.  One
 is our treatment of the American Indians.
 Another is the terrible, tragic waste of the
 Nation's natural beauty and scenic splendor.
 The script notes that the friendly Otos
 Indians are now extinct; that a million buf-
 falo "were killed just for their tongues"; that
 for 80 years the Teton Sioux Indians "fought
 their losing battle with the white man," and
 that once Lewis and Clark had explored the
 West, "the days of the plains Indian, as well
 as the beaver, were numbered."
 There is particular eloquence in the story
 of the Nez Perce Indians.  This tribe was
 friendly for "70 years, until a long succes-
 sion of betrayals and broken promises forced
 the Nez Perce to revolt.  The U.S. Army then
 destroyed them."
 Along with pictures and Clark's descrip-
 tion                                                                                                                               of  the  "remarkably  clear  Columbia
 River," narrator Greene comments: "that re-
 markably clear river is polluted today and
 no longer crowded with salmon."
 This-is another of the programs that must
 be seen in color for full enjoyment.  It is the
 kind of program that has permanent value
 and as producer Yates said: "You won't be
 able to do such a show a few years from now.
 Civilization, in the name of progress, will
 have ruined all of the scenery."

 the past few days there has emerged here
 on this floor an expression of views on
 the great crisis in Vietnam that seems
 to have flowered into what some choose
 to call the great debate. To the extent
 that it can in truth remain a great de-
 bate, it can serve well the best interest of
 our country's concern about the peace of
 the world.
 In the course of the floor debate, I ad-
 dressed myself some few days ago to the
 two central questions at issue: First,
 why not negotiate now; and, second, if
 there are to be no negotiations now, what
 policy can we best pursue that affords
 the greatest opportunity to stabilize the
 balance of power in the world at the same
 time that we best preserve the chances
 for an acceptable settlement in the Far
 East?
 In regard to the first question, that of
 negotiations now, it seems to me that it
 Is unthinkable to undertake them at this
 moment.  They could only be interpreted
 in Hanoi as a sign of weakness, however
 else we might intend them.  To Invite
 in North Vietnam the conclusion that we
 lead from fear or weakness could only
 risk an explosive impasse unintended by
 either side.  If indeed it is true that
 North Vietnam believes that we intend to
 pull out and go home, and if it is like-
 wise true that the President of the
 United States and those of us who sup-
 port his policy genuinely intend to have
 us stay, there are thus the makings for
 the type of international explosion that
 could lead irresponsibly to a war that no

 one wants. It would be war by accident
 or by misunderstanding.
 In order, therefore, to clear the air and
 to remove the uncertainties, at least on
 our side, it is important that we address
 to the North Vietnamese and, through
 them, to Peiping a clear and unequivocal
 declaration of the American intention to
 remain in southeast Asia.  It is for the
 purpose of placing this intent beyond
 any misunderstanding that I have sug-
 gested a firm six-step approach which,
 in my judgment, would achieve that end.
 That approach includes the following
 measures :
 First. We should make crystal clear
 to both Hanoi and to Peiping, and in-
 cidentally to the world at large, that we
 have no territorial ambitions anywhere
 in Asia-or around the globe, for that
 matter; and that we have no designs on
 their government or their internal poli-
 tics. They must wrestle with their own
 internal futures, so  far  as  we  are
 concerned.
 Second. We  should  announce       the
 drawing of a firm line along the 17th
 parallel and projected westward along
 a route to conform with the independent
 status of the other countries bordering
 on China, making it clear that we intend
 to tolerate no breeches of that line; and
 that, starting along the 17th parallel,
 the Vietcong infiltrations from the north
 must cease at once.
 Third. If within a specified number of
 days the Vietnamese do not cut off their
 probing activities across the line, we
 should announce our intention to bomb
 all military bases, airfields, marshaling
 areas,  and  encampments  in  North
 Vietnam.
 Fourth. If this still does not persuade
 them of our intention to stand in south-
 east Asia, then we should announce that
 we will proceed to the bombing of logistic
 targets-bridges   and   transportation.
 lines.
 Fifth. Should the above measures still
 not persuade the Vietcong of our full
 intentions, we should also announce that
 we shall next proceed to the bombing of
 industrial centers and other obvious sup-
 ply targets in support of their military
 effort.
 Sixth. Simultaneously,   we   should
 make clear that we are ready to talk,
 that we are prepared to negotiate a rea-
 sonable settlement in Indochina.                       We
 should make clear, however, that the
 17th parallel and the land below it are
 not negotiable.
 The advantage of this approach would
 be first, to strengthen our bargaining
 position at such a time as negotiations
 would seem to become practicable; and
 second, to remove all uncertainties in
 the minds of the men in Hanoi or Pei-
 ping as to our intentions. It would leave
 up to them the clear-cut decision as to
 whether then they are willing to talk
 terms or whether they are willing to
 plunge the region into large-scale war-
 fare.
 In the latter eventuality, that would
 be their decision, not ours. In any case,
 we would not be stumbling into war or
 retreating into it piecemeal, as might
 conceivably be the case under our pres-
 ent policy of tit for tat.  Under these
 circumstances, we are forced to assume
 the worst, but hope for the best. Should
 the worst occur, it is better that we face
 it now in a position of relative strength
 and greater capability, rather than later,
 when time and indifference might take
 the same frightful course in regard to
 national capabilities that they did in
 other parts of the world when the will
 to resist aggression wavered.
 Because this proposal has engendered
 a good deal of discussion since I first
 advanced it on the floor of the Senate,
 on February 17, 1965, I ask unanimous
 consent to have printed in the RECORD
 editorial comment on the proposal from
 two Wyoming newspapers, as well as a
 transcript of a radio interview by the
 Westinghouse Broadcasting Co.  In the
 latter, entitled "Washington Viewpoint,"
 I was interviewed by Ann M. Corrick, As-
 sistant Chief of WBC Washington news
 bureau, and Pete Clapper, WBC corre-
 spondent.
 There  being no objection, the edi-
 torials and the interview were ordered
 to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:
 [From the Wyoming State Tribune,
 Feb. 18, 1965]
 AMEN-CALL THE REDS' HAND
 One of the pleasures of living is the un-
 expected:  One  never  knows  what  might
 happen next.
 Today, we have been rocked to our Gold-
 water-Miller buttons by a statement by Sen-
 ator MCGEE, with whom we have quarreled
 on   many   occasions,   on   the Vietnam
 situation.
 Differing with a group of Senate liberals,
 Mr. MCGEE says this country ought to call
 the hand of Red China and the Communists
 "even if it means risking full-scale war."
 Says the Senator from Wyoming: "If Red
 China is prepared to go to war to expand
 its sphere of influence and territory in south-
 east Asia, we might as well find that out
 right now, before it's too late."
 This is the hottest war-hawk statement
 we have seen since the Republicans in .1962
 were crying for aggressive action against the
 Russian meddling in Cuba;  but it is one
 that a lot of citizens will support.
 McGEE says that, to negotiate now "is as
 unthinkable as it was to negotiate when the
 Communists threatened to take West Berlin
 and Germany; when they attempted to take
 Korea; when they attempted to make an
 armed camp of Cuba."
 "Our commitment in Vietnam is no less
 than our commitments were and are in those
 other areas of the globe," MCGEE says.
 He also suggested that the United States
 deliver an ultimatum to the Hanoi regime
 "that would be every bit as serious and de-
 liberate as the late President Kennedy's ulti-
 matum to Russia during the Cuban crisis."
 Furthermore,  the  United  States  should
 serve notice it will no longer tolerate infil-
 tration or military raids in Vietnam below
 the 17th parallel; and that this should be
 coupled with a reaffirmation that this coun-
 try has  no                                                          desire  to  intrude into North
 Vietnam and no  territorial  ambitions  in
 Asia.
 This was in direct contrast and opposition
 to a statement issued by a group of other
 Democratic  Senators    Including Senators
 GEORGE MCGOVERN, of South Dakota, STEPHEN
 YOUNG,  of  Ohio,  and  FRANK  CHURCH,  Of
 Idaho, that this country ought to seek a
 negotiated settlement in Vietnam.
 It is in direct opposition to the stance ?pf
 Oregon's WAYNE MORSE who long has ques-
 tioned the fact that we are in Vietnam at
 all.  Mr. MORSE wants the United States out
 of there.
 3415
 In fact, it even is a stronger statement
 than one issued by the Republican leader-
 ship yesterday, which was praised and ac-
 cepted by two other Democratic Senators,
 LONG, of Louisiana and LAUSCHE, of Ohio.
 The Republican leaders, DIRKSEN, of Illinois
 and FORD, of Michigan, said they support
 President Johnson's action in ordering strikes
 against the Communist supply bases in North
 Vietnam.
 But Mr. MCGEE would go even further.  He
 urges action which would, in effect, tell the
 Red Chinese, "Put up or shut up."
 Mr. MCGEE'S statements are the most ag-
 gressive we have heard uttered on the Viet-
 nam situation; if a certain person whose
 initials are BMG had made such statements
 a few months ago, the outcries against him
 would have  been even greater than they
 were.
 But we support the McGee thesis none-
 theless.  It is time to call the hand of the
 Communists in Asia; in fact, it is long past
 due.
 This goes beyond what President Johnson
 has said thus far, which is that we seek no
 extension of the war there.
 Mr. MCGEE suggests a deadline with the
 Ho Chi Minh regime being warned that to
 cross it will mean dire consequences.  He
 doesn't say what the consequences should
 be but we should imagine the threat is one
 of all-out retaliation.
 Whatever this latter might be, the pro-
 posal is to call the hands of the Red Chinese
 as well as of all the Communists; and we
 hope the Johnson administration will hear
 and act.
 We can no longer procrastinate, parley,
 and persevere.  Time is on the side of our
 enemies.
 [From the Laramie Daily Boomerang, Feb. 19,
 1965]
 TIME To CALL THE HAND
 Vietnam is  the  key to  southeast  Asia.
 That is the primary reason why the Commu-
 nists are seeking to infiltrate the area and
 take  over control  of  the South    Vietnam
 Government.    That is the reason the United
 States is just as stubbornly trying to main-
 tain its freedom.
 There are three reasons why Vietnam oc-
 cupies a position of importance in Asia.                                                                                                                                          It
 raises a surplus of rice in a part of the world
 where hunger is an always present feature.
 A  Communist  victory  in  South     Vietnam
 would flank a vital part of the Asian land
 mass setting up other nations for conquest,
 and third, if the Communists would win,
 nations threatened by them could have no
 future confidence in the United States.
 The Vietcong has stepped up its efforts in
 South Vietnam, reportedly on orders from
 Hanoi in North Vietnam.  For this reason
 the United States and the Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment have carried out retaliatory raids
 into North Vietnam.
 We're at war in Vietnam whether it's an
 official  or  recognized  war.  The  price  in
 American lives hasn't been as high as it has
 been previously in other areas, but one life is
 a high price to pay.  That price is mounting
 daily with the Vietcong carrying out raids
 against   American  installations.   Yet,  how
 can we say the price is too high if the effort
 results in freedom?
 We're not winning the war in Vietnam, but
 then neither are the Communists.
 The Vietcong is ahead at present because
 of propaganda and partly because the will-
 power of the American people isn't strong
 enough.  We fight in Vietnam against the
 protests of many of our leaders.  Many urge
 negotiation, others suggest withdrawal.
 We protest the seemingly lone defense of
 the United States against the spread of com-
 munism, but somewhere it has to be stopped.
 Many say we should let Vietnam go, that it
 is of no importance, but barring its im-

 portance for the above-named reasons, it's
 still another nation in the communistic plan
 to take over more and more territory, and
 with each country gained the Reds grow in
 strength.
 We believe that, our country is the best in
 the world.  We feel that we are the leader
 in the free world, but if we are, then we have
 to take the lead in defending that freedom.
 Senator GALE MCGEE said. Wednesday that
 the United States "should call the hand of
 Red China and the Communists in South
 Vietnam even if it means full scale war."
 We've lived for several years under the
 premise  of peaceful  coexistence  with  the
 Communists, yet, all of that time the Com-
 munists have had world designs, working
 to infiltrate various countries as they did
 in Cuba, taking over against the wishes of
 the majority.  These countries have fallen
 from the ranks of the free.  Others are en-
 dangered.  As long as we don't make a
 stand the pattern will continue.
 We must stop the Communists somewhere
 if there is to be any justification for the term
 "peaceful coexistence."  If we don't do it in
 Vietnam we lose the confidence of the rest
 of the free world, and it's unlikely we'll
 have the guts to stop them some place in
 some future time.  If we do stop them
 here and hold the line, then it could mean
 an  end to future  communistic encroach-
 ment.
 Senator MCGEE called the shot, and we
 think that we, as a free nation, must go
 along with that call if we hope to preserve
 our freedom for our children.
 WASHINGTON VIEWPOINT
 Miss CoRRICx. Good evening.  This is Ann
 Corrick with Pete Clapper in the Senate
 Radio-Television  Gallery  on  Capitol  Hill,
 Our guest on Washington Viewpoint this
 evening is Democratic Senator GALE McGEE,
 of Wyoming, a former university history
 professor, who was reelected last November
 to his second term in "the Senate.      Sen-
 ator McGEE is a member of the Senate Ap-
 propriations Committee, Commerce, and the
 Post Office and Civil Service Committees.
 Senator, a full-scale great debate appears
 to be developing In the Senate over Vietnam
 and the Communist influence in southeast
 Asia. For your part, you have said we should
 call the hand of Red China and the Commu-
 nists even if it means risking full-scale war.
 Red China already has exploded one nuclear
 device and the State Department says it has
 reason to believe she will touch off another
 one any day.  Doesn't that mean that a full-
 scale war means nuclear war?  And isn't
 that too high a price to pay to save a country
 that doesn't appear to have the determina-
 tion to save itself?
 Senator MCGEE. Well, you ask a very deep
 question and a very long question, in terms
 at least of the reply.  First, the stakes are
 high in Vietnam.  I view Vietnam as the
 last in a link of crisis areas that have to be
 stabilized  before  the world  is  fully  bal-
 anced-its stability restored in the wake of
 the last World War.     You can draw a line
 now from Finland all the way across Eastern
 :Europe and across northern Greece and Tur-
 key and Pakistan and India to the China
 Sea, and that line is not crossed recklessly
 by either side, until you get the southeast
 .Asia,  The world will not be back in balance
 until that line is drawn firmly.  If we don't
 draw it firmly, southeast Asia goes to the
 Chinese  or  Communists.  That    is  enough
 and its resources to unbalance the world. So
 what I'm saying is that the same price we
 risked at Berlin, that we risked in Greece,
 which was all-out war, if they wanted to go
 that far, that we risked in Korea, has to be
 risked in Vietnam.  I believe that this a
 probing action that's going on there, the
 same as it was in the other areas of the globe.
 They're testing us out, but we have to assume
 the worst, and hope for the best.  And that
 was the reason for my reference, that if they
 chose this to be the occasion for war, that
 would be their choice-better we learn it
 now rather than discover it piecemeal much
 later under less favorable circumstances.
 Miss CosaIcK. Do you really believe that at
 this stage in the game and considering the
 alliance with Hanoi and Peiping and Moscow,
 that the Communists will back down simply
 if we issue an ultimatum.
 Senator McGEE. Oh, I don't know.  Only
 they can answer that.  First, I don't think
 that Hanoi is too comfortable with the pro-
 spect of China moving in.  I think Hanoi
 worries as much about Peiping as do the rest
 of the countries in southeast Asia. Secondly,
 I don't believe that the Russians relish China
 dominating this large and fruitful area of
 the world to the exclusion of the Russians.
 Therefore, there are some inhibiting factors
 present.  The other is that they alone can
 decide whether a showdown in Vietnam is
 worth risking their current emerging econ-
 omy.  China doesn't have nuclear capabili-
 ties, won't have for some time to come.  She
 has exploded nuclear devices.  Her cities are
 vulnerable.  Her industry has not yet really
 gotten off the ground.  If this is what she's
 ready to risk now in an all out war, that's
 for her to decide.  I would doubt that she
 would, but if she does, it's better we know
 that now when we have every measurable
 advantage of striking capability than to dis-
 cover it as we discovered it with Mr. Hitler
 in Czechoslovakia and then in Poland, where
 we surrendered to an aggressor one step at
 a time.  I think that it's imperative to force
 a showdown.
 Miss CORRICu. If we should force a show-
 down, which side would Russia go on?
 Senator MCGEE. My guess is that Russia
 would probably applaud any kind of an open
 conflict between the Chinese and the Ameri-
 cans.  It gives Russia a free hand.
 Miss CoRRICK. You mean she'd stay out?
 Senator  MCGEE. I think that she would
 stay out, as she did in the Far East in World
 War II until it could be determined what
 the shape of it was going to be.  It's to her
 advantage. There are three giants in the
 world-two real giants-Russia and the Unit-
 ed States.                                                                          China is only a budding giant, a
 long way from arriving yet.  And I think
 that the Soviets would not get directly in-
 volved, would not find it desirable to do so, or
 fruitful to do so.  Every advantage would ac-
 crue to them not to  do  so.   There's  no
 friendship of any substantive sort between
 Peiping  and  Moscow. Historically there's
 never been.   There's not about to be now.
 And I think from the Soviet point of view,
 there would be no reason for involvement
 there.  They're not deeply involved in south-
 east Asia even at this time.  This has been
 largely a Chinese affair.
 Miss CoRRIcx. They're not supplying aid to
 the Vietcong?
 Senator MCGEE. No.   They haven't been
 involved there in any way as a matter of fact.
 This has been pretty much preempted by
 China.   They're  making  noises  now,  but
 that's, I think, for propaganda purposes in
 the Communist world, rather than for any
 realistic purpose in our own world.
 Miss CoRRicie. Pete Clapper.
 Mr. CLAPPER. Senator MCGEE, there has
 been a good deal of concern expressed on
 the Senate floor, but not many positive pro-
 posals for what to do about South Vietnam.
 And you have a plan of action.  What is it?
 Senator  MCGEE. Well,  the  first  plan  of
 action, in my judgment, is that we dare not
 negotiate right now.  I think we've got to
 be sure that we don't do the wrong thing.
 I think it would be a mistake to seek negotia-
 tions  right  now.                                                                              And  that's  important.
 And that's been the real nub of the debates
 in the Senate this past week.  There's been
 a drive on by some of the very excellent
 Senators to demand  negotiations    at this
 time. The reason I say this is not the time is
 that we have reason to known that Hanoi and
 Peiping both are convinced we're going to
 get out of there; if not this week, next year.
 And that time is  on their side.   There-
 fore, they're not interested in negotiating in
 realistic terms.
 The noises that are being made on the
 floor of the Senate, the protestations that are
 being made in some portions of the press,
 all are taken 10,000 miles away as indications
 that America is beginning to waiver in its
 position in southeast Asia, and therefore, if
 we were to approach now on negotiation,
 after these airstrikes that they have just
 made on our airfields and our billets and
 other installations in South Vietnam, it could
 only, and would only be interpreted by them
 as leading from weakness.  Now you and I
 know that we're going to stay. The American
 President has made it clear that we're going
 to stay.  But what we know is irrelevant.
 What the Communists think is what really
 counts because that's what motivates them.
 And they're confident, even as illustrated in
 the conservations that Edgar Snow had not
 very long ago with Mr. Mao, that we're going
 to be out of there in a measurable period of
 time.  That's why we dare not negotiate now.
 So I propose that we serve an ultimatum on
 North Vietnam which says that the infiltra-
 tion of northern troops across the 17th
 parallel must stop at once, and give them a
 chance to stop-x number of days.  If they
 continue to  cross  the line, then we tell
 them-we will have warned them-we bomb
 every bona fide military installation-that
 means, every encampment, every barracks,
 every airfield, that sort of thing, in North
 Vietnam.  If they still think that's a joke,
 that it's only bluff, then after the passage of
 a specified number of preannounced days,
 we then would bomb all of the logistical fa-
 cilities-the bridges, the highways, the rail-
 roads. And if this still hasn't communicated
 in a language that they alone seem to under-
 stand when the chips are down, then we
 should announce that we will bomb the in-
 dustrial centers.  That would be the planned,
 announced, and scheduled acceleration of the
 war.  The purpose would be, not to spread
 the war, but to write in strong, unadulter-
 ated terms, our intentions to stay there.  I
 think this would have a great advantage in
 clearing the air and getting through to both
 Hanoi and Peiping.  We should accompany
 this ultimatum with a very clear statement
 again that we don't want their country, we
 don't want, their government, we have no
 territorial ambitions in Asia, but we do in-
 tend to kep them north of the 17th parallel,
 and nothing below the 17th is negotiable.  I
 think those are the terms in which we ought
 to speak, and that does raise the question
 whether Hanoi would accept it or not.   May-
 be they won't.  I think this will hurt Hanoi
 enough that they would have to,-but it leads
 us inescapably, then would China decide that
 she had to go into the war.  And I think it's
 timewe know the answer to that question.
 Mr. CLAPPER. Senator McGEE, two practical
 questions: Do you think that our side could
 tell If the infiltration is coming to an end
 at x number of days?  Is this possible in that
 jungle?
 Senator MCGEE. Yes.  I think without be-
 traying any classified information, we know
 who comes across, where they cross, where
 they came- from in crossing, where they go
 after they've gotten across.  Our intelligence
 there is not without some real strength.
 Mr. CLAPPER. OK.  The next question is,
 Do you think that bombing would be enough?
 This is a backward country, this North Viet-
 nam.  Does bombing really knock anything
 worthwhile out?
 Senator  MCGEE. Bombing  doesn't  knock
 armies out.
 Mr. CLAPPER. That is right.
 Senator MCGEE. But bombing knocks out a
 warwaging capability.   Because the troops
 that are coming into South Vietnamnow are

 that he  understands  this question better

 when it really comes down to the final fate-
 ful moment, he and he alone has all the
 facts  at his  fingertips  and  only  he can

 OUR 44TH STATE
 (By Lucille Storen)
 In this year of its diamond jubilee,
 The State of Wyoming looks back,
 A glorious page in our country's history
 It presents; not much does it lack.
 The Wyoming rodeo, known far and wide;
 Its Indians, Cheyenne and Crow;
 The legendary cowboys, saddles and rawhide;
 This State, to all seekers, will show.
 A State in 1890, yes, Wyoming is there,
 Forty-fourth is its star in our flag,
 We know it wouldn't be fair to say
 It ever dishonored that flag.
 Wyoming, Wyoming, pride of our land,
 To us you will always be
 A loyal State, a great State, beautiful and
 grand.
 Spectacular, amazing, Ohl We all agree.
 TREASURE STATE
 (By John Krantz)
 Wyoming! Wyoming!
 Your treasure is great.
 Some are hot springs, geysers,
 Yellowstone National too.
 Wyoming, Wyoming,
 It is your diamond jubilee.
 The Green River rendezvous,
 Could only be for you.
 Wyoming! Wyoming!
 People trot your land of late
 So we the pupils of New York State
 Give you a hand=and congratulate.
 A SISTER STATE
 (By Wanda Kowalski)
 In eighteen hundred ninety
 This land became a State
 And nature blessed it greatly   -
 With forest, cattle, and bait
 You recognize this place too
 Where resources abound
 Wyoming, peopled with races two
 Has a wonderful heritage all around.
 With equality a password
 And freedom so common a thing
 This  State truly  must be rated well
 So its praises must New Yorkers sing.
 POEMS ON WYOMING'S 75TH
 -ANNIVERSARY
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, as I have
 pointed out previously, the year 1965 is
 a landmark year for the State of Wyo-
 ming.  Wyoming-the Equality State-
 this year marks its 75th anniversary of
 statehood, and will do so formally at
 ceremonies in Cheyenne on July 10.
 Evidence that the people of the United
 States are not only aware of Wyoming's
 diamond jubilee, but also will aid Wyo-
 mingites everywhere in marking the an-
 niversary is certainly welcome.  Such
 evidence has come to me from Andrea
 DeMaio, of the Holy Family Civics Club,
 in the Bronx, New York City. She en-
 closed some poetry composed by mem-
 bers of the club in honor of Wyoming's
 diamond jubilee. In behalf of all Wyo-
 ming citizens, I express my thanks to the
 club and to its moderator, Sister Joan
 of Are, for their interest in a sister State.
 I ask unanimous consent that the
 poems be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the poems
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 EAST GREETS WEST
 (By Carole Lochard)
 Wyoming, our sister State of diamond jubilee
 boast
 Greetings from New York, and to you our

 We hope your mighty forests continue to
 thrive and grow
 And grasslands furnish health and hoe.
 May your rivers and valleys flow, run, and
 blend,
 Your      canyons and your mountains your
 mightiness contend,
 May you always, clear sister, enjoy birthdays
 evermore,
 Happy 75th birthday from the Bronx in New
 York State.

 INCREASE OF FUND FOR SPECIAL
 OPERATIONS  OF  THE  INTER-
 AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the unfin-
 ished business be laid before the Senate
 and made the pending business.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 clerk will state the bill by title.
 The LEGISLATIVE CLERK.   A bill (H.R.
 45) to amend the Inter-American Devel-
 opment Bank Act to authorize the United
 States to participate in an increase in the
 resources of the Fund for Special Opera-
 tions of the Inter-American Development
 Bank.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection?
 There being no objection, the Senate
 resumed the consideration of the bill.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, is
 there an amendment pending?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 pending amendment is the amendment
 of the Senator from Ohio [Mr. LAuscsni).
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 clerk will call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, a par-
 liamentary inquiry.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Senator will state it.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  Am I correct in my
 understanding that my amendment, No.
 42, is the pending business?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Senator is correct.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  Mr. President, the
 pending amendment, if adopted, would
 prevent the Inter-American Develop-
 ment Bank from floating in the United
 States any bond issues which by the
 natural impact of such flotation would
 take American dollars out of our coun--
 try and put them into foreign countries.
 The question may well be asked as to
 why I have proposed that if and when
 more money is subscribed to the Inter-
 American Development Bank, we should
 prohibit the bank from selling bonds in
 the United States, if and when it deter-
 mines to procure more money for its
 operations.  That question is quite perti-
 nent, and, of course, it must be answered.
 Yesterday I made the statement that
 last week there was before the Senate a
 bill dealing with gold. We discussed the
 perilous position in which we find our-
 selves because of the constant movement
 of gold out of the country.
 In the face of those arguments, but
 having hanging over us another threat,
 which was of greater consequence, we de-
 cided to remove the 25-percent gold
 coverage on deposits which the member
 banks of the Federal Reserve System
 have in their Federal Reserve banks.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  I have no objec-
 tion. I would rather consider some fur-
 ther restrictions on tourism, because it
 would be much better for a year or two
 for Americans to take a look at their own
 country. But that is not the issue before
 us.  I do not believe that this is the
 vehicle to solve our problem. We have a
 bill involving $750 million for a period
 of 3 years, and I would hope that we
 can dispose of that. All the other good
 ideas for improvements we can leave for
 some other vehicle.
 Mr. HARTKE.  I see a basic incon-
 sistency with what the Senator has
 pointed out.  We cannot. take the bal-
 ance-of-payments problem and be on
 one side of the situation one moment
 and on the other sido the next moment.
 We should adopt a policy which should
 apply universally throughout the Gov-
 ernment.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  I do not believe
 that the President, even though he is
 concerned about the balance of pay-
 ments-as we all are-believes this to
 be so important that our foreign policy-
 every activity that we have-will be sub-
 ject to that one consideration. I do not
 believe it is quite that critical.  It may
 become such.  If the program that the
 President suggests does not work as effi-
 ciently as he would like it to work, I am
 sure he would be prepared to come in
 ,with stronger controls until we do work
 out a balance.
 I am sure that 'if it continues, tourism
 can be restricted in more direct ways. I
 notice in this morning's newspapers that
 Secretary Udall and others have been
 trying to persuade Americans to travel
 in the United States for a year or two,
 to look at our own country.  This is a
 healthy way of approaching the prob-
 lem. It will not work if people insist on
 going to Monte Carlo to be fleeced in-
 stead of going to Las Vegas to be fleeced.
 If they continue to go to Monte Carlo
 we may have to 'put some restrictions on
 their travel abroad.  However, I believe
 they may be content to be fleeced in Las
 Vegas, rather than in Monte Carlo, for a
 year or two, at least, and then, if we are
 in a better position, they can go over
 there again.
 At any rate, we have a specific prob-
 lem before us, and that is whether
 we  wish  to  participate  in  carry-
 ing out an agreement which has been
 entered with all the members of the
 Bank over a period of many months. We
 can either take it or not. Of course,
 Congress is at liberty to reject it if it
 wishes to reject it. At any rate, I do not
 believe we should issue congressional di-
 rectives that are not to the, point.  We
 have a way of reaching the issue properly
 if we wish to do it through putting on a
 tax which would make it unattractive to
 float such bonds in this country.,
 Mr. LA J CHE. Mr. President, I shall
 be very brief.  We are not telling the
 International Development Bank what to
 do.  It wants $750 million of our money,
 at the rate, of $250 million a year.  We
 are, in effect, saying, if my amendment
 is adopted, "We will allow you to have
 .,that money, , but you must remember
 that we hve a balance-of-payments
 'problem, and therefore if in the future
 you should decide to sell bonds, you must
 agree not to sell them in the United
 States."
 The manager of the bill has argued
 that our Government through the Sec-
 retary might be able to handle it with-
 out my amendment.
 To that statement I give the answer
 that from 1962 to 1964, at a time when
 our balance-of-payments situation was
 growing worse, $225 million worth of
 bonds were sold in the United States.
 Those dollars paid ' by our private in-
 vestors for bonds of the Inter-American
 Development Bank are not tied into the
 purchase of U.S. goods.  They can be
 used to buy goods wherever the recipient
 country desires to buy them.
 It is argued that we should enact a
 law which would increase the interest
 equalization tax rate.  That has not
 worked.  I would not be at all surprised
 to have a new request made of us.
 To the Senator from Indiana I should
 like to say that our balance-of-payments
 problem, as described by the Senator
 from Arkansas, does grow from a number
 of causes.  One is'the presence of Amer-
 lean troops in foreign countries, where
 they spend our dollars.  The second, to
 a substantial degree, is the large number
 of American tourists who are spending
 dollars in foreign countries, and the
 small number of foreign tourists who are
 coming to the United States to spend
 their dollars here.  The third is the in-
 vestments which American business is
 making directly in building factories
 around the world.  The fourth-and
 not in a minor degree, but in a substan-
 tial degree-is the American dollars that
 are buying foreign bonds.
 There may be other causes, but these
 are the primary ones. All of them con-
 tribute to create the grave problem that
 is facing us.
 All I wish to do is to start effectively.
 Secretary Udall has asked the people of
 the United States to travel in America.
 President Kennedy asked the people to
 do the same thing in 1963.  The Com-
 merce Department set up a program to
 encourage  travel in America.  These
 efforts did not work.  There was not
 much response to it.   My belief is that
 it did not work because the people were
 not conscious of the grave problems con-
 fronting us.
 The Senator from Arkansas speaks of
 solving the problem in some wishful way.
 He says, "Let us speak with sweet words;
 let us appeal, and it will be solved."
 My proposal is to write it into the law
 and say to the Bank "We will make this
 money available to you in the amount
 that is suggested, but all we want is that
 you, the Bank, will not further aggravate
 our balance-of-payments problem by
 selling new issues of bonds in the United
 States."
 The Senator from Arkansas admits
 that our interest rates are low. In Eng-
 land, as I pointed out earlier, the interest
 rate is 7 percent for loans. When these
 20 countries assemble and decide to sell
 bonds, the normal impulse will be to sell
 them in the market that charges the low-
 est ,rate of interest. Where is that?  It
 is in the United States.. Therefore I re-
 34.?
 spectfully suggest that we should not try
 to wish ourselves out of'. this task and
 problem that confronts us and that we
 had better start taking affirmative action.
 Adopting my amendment is one way of
 doing it.
 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and
 nays on my amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Is there
 a sufficient second?  The report is not
 sufficiently seconded.

 AT.JANZA, POR PROGRESO NEEDS SUPPORT TO FUR-
 THER DEMOCRACY IN LATIN AMERICA
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.       Mr. President,
 neighbors, be they nations or individ-
 uals, inevitably find that mutual advan-
 tage lies along the path of good rela-
 tions.  We are neighbors with all the
 nations on earth, because we inhabit the
 same planet. But, both historically and
 geographically, we bear a special rela-
 tionship to our neighbors to the south.
 today, the Latin American nations of
 this hemisphere face a great challenge.
 Social, political, and economic change
 must, of necessity, be brought about.
 The question impatiently awaiting an-
 swer is this: Will the change be evolu-
 tionary or revolutionary?
 The Alliance for Progress has been
 advanced as our primary offering to
 meet the challenge, by  evolutionary
 steps.  We in Congress have the duty
 to do everything we can to enable the
 Alliance to succeed in its work.
 The people of Texas feel a particularly
 close friendship for our Latin American
 neighbors. Texas was once a part of
 Mexico; we still share a long border with
 our good friends to the south. The cul-
 ture of Texas reflects the influence of
 our unique Mexican past,and Is one of
 our irreplaceable treasures. Fifteen per-
 cent of all Texans, more than 11/2 million
 people, have Spanish surnames.
 Mr. President, I state categorically my
 support of the aims of the Alliance for
 Progress. Thus far, the program has not
 lived up to the expectations of many;
 but perhaps some of those expectations
 were unrealistic. It would be difficult to
 imagine a more difficult goal than that to
 which the Alliance is dedicated: Wide-
 spread, rapid, evolutionary-rather than
 revolutionary-social change.
 The Alianza pare el Progreso has taken a
 giant leap forward. In terms of where it has
 to go, it has taken only a short, faltering
 step.
 These words were written in 1963 by
 the then, SenatorHUBERT H. HUMPHREY.
 They still serve to describe the Alliance's
 accomplishments. Hundreds of thou-
 sands of housing units have been built.
 But the need is for over 10 million.
 Classrooms have been built, and the
 number of persons in Latin America who
 can read and write is at an alltime high;
 but 54 percent of the population is still
 illiterate.
 Experience has taught us that the con-
 ditions of extreme poverty and inequality
 of opportunity which exist throughout
 so much of Latin America are breeding
 grounds for the Communist line which
 preaches economic advancement, but
 which results in shackles of totalitarian
 control.  Thus far, Castro has not suc-
 ceeded in getting any other nation to fol-
 low his example.  But if the values of
 Western civilization are to shape the
 future of Latin America, then it is im-
 perative that, at this crucial stage in the
 development of this hemisphere, we show
 what can be accomplished by a free peo-
 ple in a democratic society. More houses
 and more schools must be built.  Agri-
 cultural and industrial production must
 be stepped up.  Land reform is needed.
 The barriers to social and economic
 justice must be blasted away.    At the
 same time, attention must be paid to the
 unrest and the insecurity which arise
 during times of rapid social change. We
 must show the people of Latin America
 that the future belongs to those with the
 on to see that man's fulfillment comes
 not only from material accomplishment,
 but also from a realization of the nature
 of the human spirit; that man is more
 than an animal, more than a mouth to
 be fed, more than a number in a statis-
 tician's notebook.
 The pending bill, which authorizes a
 $750 million increase in the U.S. contri-
 bution to the Fund for Special Opera-
 tions of the Inter-American Develop-
 ment Bank, and which permits  the
 merger of the PSO with the Social Prog-
 ress Trust Fund, can bring us one step
 farther down the long road to a stable,
 democratic Latin America.

 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 At the end of the bill strike out the quota-

 graph :
 "(c) The contribution of the United States
 under this section shall be made upon con-
 dition that at least 50 per centum of the
 aggregate amount of loans made from such
 contribution shall be repayable in United
 States dollars."
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator from Alaska yield for a question.?
 Mr. GRUENING. I yield.
 Mr. MORSE.  How long does the Sen-
 ator intend to speak?
 Mr. GRUENING.  Approximately 12
 minutes.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I often
 find myself in my present predicament.
 I am trying to operate an education dem-
 onstration.  I see that the senior Seri-
 ator from Illinois [Mr. DOUGLAS], a great
 teacher, is present in the Chamber.  He
 ought to be here with me.  The delri-
 onstration is employing the use of audio-
 visual techniques from Chicago, and a
 group of sixth grade youngsters.
 I am sorry that the Presiding Officer
 cannot be with me.  He has heard me
 discuss this question in the committee.
 I shall leave the floor to attend as
 much as I can of the demonstration. I'
 would not be surprised if the Senator
 from Alaska were asked some questions.
 May I have a gentleman's understand-
 ing with the Senator from Alaska that
 when he finishes his speech, he will ask
 for a quorum call and protect me with
 respect to any unanimous-consent agree-
 ment relating to limiting debate on this
 bill?

 ridiculous in the eyes of the rest of the
 world.
 If almost every edition of the news-
 papers did not carry reports of more
 American fighting men being killed and
 wounded in a bloody, senseless war in the
 swamps of South Vietnam, the political
 and, military situation there would be
 huorous-indeed farcical-if it were
 not so tragic.
 What is our excuse _for being in South
 Vietnam fighting an undeclared war?
 Because, answers our Government, we
 were asked for assistance in resisting
 Communist aggression by the free, demo-
 cratic Government of South Vietnam.
 What government? Yesterday's? To-
 day's? Tomorrow's?
 Why were we given the signal honor of

 imminent.  To send hundreds of thousands
 of Americans into an endless jungle war or
 to bomb North Vietnamese ports and indus-
 trial centers on a saturation basis would be
 a surer road to global holocaust than to a
 "victory" arms can never win for either side.
 As Mr. James Reston stated in his col-
 umn in the New York Times on the same
 day:
 But most of the people in Washington, in-
 cluding  President  Johnson,  are  neither
 hawks nor doves but something in between,
 who want to find an honorable way out of
 the confusion.
 The opportunity for an honorable way
 out of the mess in Vietnam has been
 afforded the United States by the pleas
 for negotiation made by the Pope, by the
 Secretary General of the United Nations,
 by India, and by France, and by numer-
 ous private citizens, including some of
 our colleagues.
 Those who urged the escalation of the
 undeclared war in South Vietnam should
 ponder well the words of the then-Sen-
 ator from Massachusetts John F. Ken-
 nedy who, on April 6, 1954, beginning on
 page 4671 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD,
 said:
 To pour money, material, and men into the
 jungles of Indochina without at least a pros-
 pect of victory would be dangerously futile
 and self-destructive * * *,  I am frankly of
 the  belief  that  no  amount  of  American
 military assistance in Indochina can conquer
 an enemy which is everywhere, and at the
 same time nowhere, an enemy of the people
 which has the sympathy and covert support
 of the people * * *.   For the United States
 to intervene unilaterally and to send troops
 into the most difficult terrain of the world,
 with the Chinese able to pour in unlimited
 manpower, would mean that we would face
 a situation which would be far more diffi-
 cult than even that we encountered in Korea.
 type of conflict there.  We are aiding
 one side in a civil war. We are already
 providing more military support to our
 side in the civil war-the South Vietna-
 mese-than North Vietnam is supplying
 to its side-the Vietcong.
 But unless we are willing to drop the
 futile disguise that our military men are
 in South Vietnam as advisers and take
 over all of the actual fighting, then the
 civil war will be successful only to the ex-
 tent that the South Vietnamese are
 willing to fight-and this they are not
 willing to do. They are more concerned
 with being left alone.
 And now on.the horizon appear the
 "hawks," urging that the United States
 take over the actual fighting in South
 Vietnam; even if it means taking on in

 One of our officers reported that the

 barracks were designed not to, keep the

 Our men are dying in defense of a

 Mr. -President, I ask unanimous con-

 (See exhibit 1.)
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, Mr.
 Baldwin openly admits that escalation
 of the war could result in our having up
 to a million men fighting in South Viet-
 nam in a Korea-type military operation.
 This does not include the number of
 military troops we would have to send to
 Korea if Red China-as is most likely
 decided to reopen that front.
 Such an escalation of the war would
 stop our steps towards economy in Gov-

 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 2.)
 Mr. GRUENING. I hope the President
 will not attach too much significance to
 the urging he has received that he adopt
 the position of the "hawks" from such
 outstanding Republican leaders as the
 former Vice President, Richard Nixon,
 the former GOP presidential candidate,
 Barry Goldwater, and the able and dis-
 tinguished minority leader [Mr. DIRx-
 sEN]. As has been pointed out, if we be-
 come involved in a Korea-type, bogged-
 down foot war in South Vietnam, all
 three of these distinguished gentlemen
 will, when the casualty lists froman es-
 calated war start coming in, be among
 the first to dub the war "Johnson's war"
 and to revive the eery that the Democratic
 Party is the "war party."
 I hope, also, that the President will
 heed well the voices raised by his former
 colleagues on this side of the aisle who,
 having at heart only his best interests
 and the best interests of our country,
 have been urging him to heed the pleas

 the New York Times, Feb. 19, 19651
 THE WAR HAwKS-
 A comparatively small group of Americans,
 at this moment predominantly political in
 character and predominantly Republican in
 politics, is doing its best to multiply the
 perils and frustrations of the war in south-
 east Asia.
 This group ignores the realities of the
 present situation.  It ignores the obvious
 war weariness of the people of South Viet-
 nam.  It ignores the steady stream of deser-
 tions from the Vietnamese Army.  It ignores
 the difficulty of protecting isolated American
 bases against the surprise attacks of guer-
 rillas.
 It ignores the possibility of an invasion of
 South Vietnam by the very considerable
 North  Vietnamese  Army.  It  ignores  the
 problem of how an aerial counterattack could
 cope successfully with a massive ground at-
 tack of this character.  It ignores the possi-
 bility of Chinese intervention. It ignores the
 logistics and belittles the cost in lives lost,
 blood spilled and treasure wasted, of fighting
 a war on a jungle front 7,000 miles from the
 coast of California.
 The whole aim of this group is to expand
 the Vietnamese war, even if it means draw-
 ing in China and perhaps the Soviet Union as
 well.  By its lights, Presidents Johnson's dec-
 laration that the United States seeks no
 wider war is as much a prescription for fail-
 ure as any attempt at a negotiated peace.' It
 is one thing to say, as Secretary McNamara
 did in his testimony yesterday, that this
 country has "no other alternative than con-
 tinuing to support South Vietnam against
 the Red overrule ,.      _ _

 a recognition would awaken a greater sense
 of national and Military determination, in-
