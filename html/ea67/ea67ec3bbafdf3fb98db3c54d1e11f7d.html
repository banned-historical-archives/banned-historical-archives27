News in Perspective 
Peking Sees Moscow as a Clumsy Ally 
This is the second in a 
series of articles by Dennis 
Bloodworth,- chief Far East 
correspondent for the Lon-
don Observer, who has just 
toured Communist China. It 
was written in Singapore to 
escape censorship. 
SINGAPORE?What passed 
between Soviet Premier Nikita 
rus c ev an Chinese Com-
munist Chairman Mao Tse-tung 
at their meeting in Peking in 
early August is still largely 
secret 
But the joint Mao-Khrusbehey 
communique and subsequent 
international devel opments 
have, been revealing, despite 
the 'secrecy.. 
The communique called for 
holding summit talks at once, 
although in reality Peking is 
not interested in relaxing in-
ternational tension. But it also 
devoted disproportionate space 
to condemning Yugoslav "re-
visionism," a subject on which 
China is infinitely more sensi-
tive than the U. S. S. R. 
Khrushchey evidently bowed 
before Mao's objections to the 
holding of a Middle East con-
ference within the United Na-
tions Security Council, for after 
leaving Peking he proposed a 
debate in the General Assembly, 
instead. 
But when the meeting ap-
proved a resolution that suc-
cessfully blunted the edge of 
the crisis in the Arab world, 
Communi s,t Chinese guns 
e?-pened up on Nationalistheld 
Quemoy within 48 hours. 
This move, however, must be 
read in the light of information 
from Russian sources in Peking 
that Mao asked fen. more arms 
for China and Ehrushchey made 
certain promises. 
The urgent necessity for this 
top-level, give-and-take session 
becomes clear if it. is set against 
the background of Sino-Soviet 
relations, of the delicate bal-
ance that Moscow and Peking 
must always strike' between 
their divergent ambitions if 
Communist solidarity is to be' 
preserved. -

 News In Perspective  
'People's Communes' Drown Voice of the Peasant 
This is the last in a series 
of articles by Dennis Blood-
worth, chief Far East corre-
spondent for the London 
Observer, who has just toured 
Communist China. It was 
written in Singapore to es-
cape censorship. 
SINGAPORE, Oct. 1?Th e 
young farmer in tattered 
clothes led me between fields 
of the transplanted rice. 
Across the green plain rose 
that mountain barrier of 
Szechuan which the Japanese 
never ventured to cross. This 
was the rich and tranquil 
country of Southwest China. 
At first glance this looked 
like a well run farm anywhere 
in the world. But as I walked 
around I noticed differences. 
There was not just one 
large homestead, but scores 
of small ones, revealing that 
thousands of peasants lived 
and worked on these acres. 
Yet all boundary markings 
had been removed and the 
verges plowed for crops. There 
were no tractors, no signs of 
mechanization, but in the 
fields I saw teams of 40 and 
.50 men and women working 
with their hands. 
Some of the farmsteads 
were being demolished, while 
in the middle distance stood 
a grey barrack of a place, 
looking like a penitentiary. 
This was a communal dormi-
tory with a central kitchen 
and general canteen which 
could seat 500. Behind each 
of its many doors was a new 
home for families moved from 
the doomed cottages ? two 
small earth-floored rooms. 
For this was not just a 
farm, but an agricultural pro-
ducers' cooperative. When the 
Chinese Communists first 
took over, they confiscated 
all land from the landlords 
and redistributed it in small 
parcels to the enthusiastic 
peasants. By degrees, however, 
the peasants were then forced 
into Joining cooperatives in 
which all members pooled 
their land, for which they 
were paid rent, and their 
labor, for which they re-
ceived piecework pay. The co-
operative did all its market-
ing and buying through the 
state. Households were 
grouped into work teams. 
By this year, these coopera-
tives?to which 97 per cent 
'of the peasant households be-
By Dennis Bloodworth 
London Observer 
vanced": the peasant received 
nothing for his land any more. 
He was once more a paid 
laborer, directed by a coopera-
tive committee which he 
helped elect, and only digni-
fied by the holding of one 
share in the company, as it 
were. 
Today even this last stake 
is becoming meaningless, for 
the cooperatives themselves 
are being grouped into large 
"people's communes" in which 
his single voice is drowned. 
But the Hsin Li cooperative, 
with its 563 households, is 
playing its part in an even 
more important drama. "You 
see those fields over there?" 
the cooperative vice director 
asked. "They're experimental. 
From what we have learned 
from them we know we can 
get two rice crops and one 
wheat crop out of the same 
patch of land every year. But 
to do this you have to waste 
nothing, to give the land 
everything you've got." 
This year, he said, wheat 
output on the farm would 
reach 1800 pounds per acre, but 
next year it would be 25,000 
pounds per acre?nearly le 
times as much. The first rice 
crop of 1958 had yielded 3600 
pounds per acre. The second 
would yield nearly 20,000 
pounds. 
When I questioned these fig-
ures I found they were based 
on the yield of the highly-
dosed experimental acreage. 
The vice-director nevertheless 
insisted that comparable in-
creases in production could be 
achieved by ploughing deeper, 
using better seeds and more 
fertilizer, and by planting so 
closely that 10 shoots would 
grow where one grew today. 
This was not just an isolated 
case of excited figuring. The 
national planning of China is 
based on such forecasts. 
But can the Chinese repeat 
oil a nation-wide scale any-
thing like the output achieved 
on a few thousand selected 
acres? And will the soil stand 
up to such treatment or are 
the Communists about to turn 
their country into a dustbowl? 
Agricultural experts agree 
that modern science has open-
ed the way for almost incred-
ible leaps in output, and this 
year China is producing nearly 
39 million tons of wheat-2 
million tons more than the 
United States-70 per cent 
longed ? had become "ad- more than last year. China 
also has vast expanses of land growing population without 
as yet untiljed in her outer 
provinces. 
But the question-mark re-
mains. 
Furthermore, this grain gam-
ble is important in a far wider 
context. It is of vital interest 
to the world that China should 
be able to finance her. indus-
trial program with agricultural 
produce and still feed her 
being obliged to expand out-
ward. 
Today, about every one hu-
man in four is a Chinese. In 
30 years, there may easily be 
one billion of them. One can 
only hope that Peking's dream 
of increased farming output 
does not turn into nightmare, 
not only for China but for thi 
rest of the world.
