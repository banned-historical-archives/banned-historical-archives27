 FAR EAST
 Indochina: A New Threat in the North
 North Vietnamese units in northernmost
 Quang Tri Province kept up heavy shellings of
 allied positions last week and also began a series
 of ground attacks against isolated field positions.
 Allied counterattacks and air strikes have report-
 edly inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers.
 Most of the ground attacks were directed at
 South Vietnamese Marines participating in Lam
 Son 810-a search-and-clear operation against en-
 emy units operating in the central and western
 sectors of the province.
 more than 260 Communists were killed as against
 government losses of 31 killed and 32 wounded.
 Ground fighting has abated somewhat in the
 central highlands, but the current respite will
 probably last only as long as it takes for enemy
 units to regroup for new attacks on South Viet-
 namese artillery bases and other targets in western
 Kontum and southern Pleiku Provinces.
 The breach between Thieu and Ky is con-
 tinuing to widen; they have begun to hurl accusa-
 tions at each other in public, making it most
 unlikely that either would consider renewing their
 political marriage of convenience for the election.
 Thieu has suggested that Ky resign the vice presi-
 dency, but Ky rejected this, charging that the
 President is a "tyrant" who relies on fraud,
 threats, and pressure to gag the opposition.
 President Thieu's tactics in persuading the
 Lower House to pass the presidential election bill
 last week have provoked considerable private
 criticism in Saigon. The President's main objec-
 tive-to ensure inclusion of a restrictive nomina-
 tion clause in the bill-is widely viewed as an
 effort to keep Vice President Ky out of the presi-
 dential race. The clause requires candidates to be
 endorsed by either 40 of the nearly 20C) National
 Assembly members or 100 of the 550 members of
 provincial councils. Several independent and pro-
 government deputies have complained privately
 that members of the government exerted heavy
 pressure on them to vote for the bill. At least half
 of the deputies are generally believed to have
 accepted bribes from a presidential aide in ex-
 change for their votes. One prominent deputy
 claims that, although he was not offered any
 money, he was warned that his campaign for
 re-election in this summer's Lower House elec-
 tions would suffer if he failed to vote for the
 nomination clause.
 In the past, similar controversies stirred up
 by Thieu's methods of dealing with the National
 Assembly have blown over fairly soon. Although
 in this case Thieu's leading rivals for the presi-
 dency may keep the matter in the spotlight for
 some time, it seems likely that they will continue
 to focus mainly on the contents of the election
 bill rather than on Thieu's tactics in getting it
 passed.

 The Vice President
 hopes Minh, who seems certain to get the neces-
 sary endorsement of Assembly members, will per-
 suade provincial councillors sympathetic to him
 to endorse Ky. Minh might be receptive to this
 suggestion, realizing that his own chances would
 be improved if Ky runs because the Vice Presi-
 dent would draw support away from Thieu. Minh
 might, however, have difficulty persuading pro-
 vincial councillors to endorse Ky if Thieu ap-
 peared to be the likely victor, as the councillors
 might be reluctant to go on public record against
 the President.
 Opposition Deputy Released
 The release of prominent opposition deputy
 Ngo Cong Duc last week after four days of con-
 finement will help calm the furor over his deten-
 tion. Duc was released shortly after the Lower
 House voted by a wide margin to order the exec-
 utive branch to free him. As a result of the affair,
 the government's image may have suffered in
 Duc's home province in the Mekong Delta, where
 many of the people apparently believe the dep-
 uty's claim that the incident leading to his arrest
 was part of a government plot to have him dis-
 qualified as a candidate in this summer's Lower
 House elections.
 An article in the January-February issue of
 an authoritative North Vietnamese party journal,
 only recently available in Washington, contains
 the clearest signs to date that a fundamental
 change in Hanoi's war strategy took place around
 the turn of the year. The article strongly suggests
 that the Communists are now taking a different
 approach on two basic issues: the relative priori- 25X1
 ties to be attached to prosecuting the war and
 developing the home front in North Vietnam; and
 the kinds of military tactics that now are suitable
 for Communist forces, especially in South Viet-
 nam.
 These  questions have periodically been
 topics of debate in North Vietnam as the nature
 of the war has changed over the past decade.
 Since 1968 the line has been that the war and the
 home front have roughly equal priority and that a
 long, drawn-out, low-key struggle is in prospect in
 the South. The newly available article, on the
 other hand, asserts categorically that the war is
 North Vietnam's first order of business and that
 intense, large-scale fighting involving conventional
 forces is called for on the battle front.
 On the first point, the article makes no at-
 tempt to argue that a balance of some kind
 should be maintained in the allocation of re-
 sources to development at home and to the war
 effort. In one remarkably candid passage illumi-
 nating Hanoi's manpower mobilization effort of
 the past few months, the article states: "As the
 great rear area of the three theaters (Vietnam,
 Laos, and Cambodia), North Vietnam has the
 primary duty at the present time to seek to
 mobilize manpower and material in order to meet
 fully and promptly all the requirements of the
 front line.... Irrespective of the situation, North
 Vietnam must fully and promptly meet all re-
 quirements for reinforcements for the various
 theaters."
 In discussing military tactics, the article
 acknowledges that fighting a so-called protracted
 war is basic Vietnamese Communist policy, but it
 points out that "protracted fighting is not pro-
 tracted guerrilla fighting"-i.e., that stand-up bat-
 tles by conventional forces have an important
 role. The article calls for  "sudden  leap-like

 developments" aimed at quickly changing the bal-
 ance of forces, citing the Communist offensives of
 1968 and the spring of 1965 as examples. And
 just to make clear that the examples are ap-
 plicable to today's war, the article asserts that the
 "total defeat of the 'Vietnamization' of the
 war...also involves large leaps to change the
 balance of forces to the point where the enemy
 will not be able to continue the war."
 These ideas probably were formalized as
 Communist policy at the party central commit-
 tee's 19th plenary session held around the turn of
 the year. Their appearance in a study journal
 intended primarily for Communist cadre indicates
 that they are part of the party line. More than
 any other evidence available to date, the article
 indicates that North Vietnam is bent on raising
 the level of fighting in Indochina in the months
 ahead, and that it is prepared to put much more
 manpower into the war than has appeared in the
 infiltration network so far this year.
 Cambodia: War on the Doorstep
 During the week Communist forces con-
 tinued to offer strong opposition to government
 efforts to dislodge them from an area just 15
 miles northeast of Phnom Penh. In some of the
 sharpest action in recent months, the enemy at-
 tacked and broke up a Cambodian Army task
 force that was attempting to reach two embattled
 government positions east of the Mekong River.
 The task force, which consisted primarily of
 elite Khmer Krom units, was trapped by the en-
 emy on 8 June after it moved out of the village of
 Vihear Suor and headed east toward one of the
 isolated positions at Kompong Chamlang. The
 Communists first brought the eight-battalion
 column to a halt by attacking it with intense
 small-arms fire, and then followed up with a con-
 centrated mortar and rocket barrage. Although
 the task force was thrown into temporary disar-
 ray, most of its elements managed to fight their
 way through encircling enemy troops and return
 to Vihear Suor. Preliminary casualty reports in-
 dicated that 26 government soldiers were killed
 and another 166 wounded. Communist losses re-
 portedly totaled at least 85 killed.
 Although the Communists' objectives in
 holding this area are not yet clear, they may be
 trying to provide a screen for an infiltration route
 from the north that conceivably could be used
 once the area between the Mekong and Prey Veng
 town becomes inundated. Whatever the case, the

 government evidently is determined to keep
 trying to clear this area once its forces there have
 been regrouped and reinforced.
 Phnom Penh also suffered through another
 petroleum crisis during the week. Reserve stocks
 of diesel fuel for vehicles and for the city's indus-
 trial plants were exhausted, forcing a number of
 the latter to shut down while one of the capital's
 two power plants was running dangerously low on
 fuel. The anticipated arrival of another petroleum
 convoy up the Mekong was expected to improve
 the situation, but only temporarily, because the
 government has persistently mismanaged such de-
 liveries.

 Assembly. The president of that body informed
 the government that the Assembly will dissolve
 itself if the recent increase in the cost of gasoline
 is not rescinded. A majority of the assemblymen
 reportedly are opposed to the new price because
 it imposes a heavy burden on the poorer segments
 of society, and because they believe the govern-
 ment acted unconstitutionally in raising the price
 without consulting the National Assembly.
 In responding to the Assembly's demand,
 the minister of finance stated that a combination
 of transportation difficulties and the requirement
 for additional government revenue had neces-
 sitated the price rise and, therefore, its revocation
 would be "economically disastrous." He also indi-
 cated, however, that he was asking the minister of
 commerce to work directly with the Assembly in
 order to find a mutually satisfactory solution to
 the question of prices in general. This conciliatory
 response evidently placated the aroused deputies,
 who viewed it as a sign that the government is
 willing to consult with them before initiating sim-
 ilar policy changes in the future.
 Laos: The Military Situation
 After several weeks of relative inactivity in
 the Luang Prabang area, North Vietnamese forces
 on 6 June overran government high-ground posi-
 tions at Phou Som Poi and Phou Pane, about 18
 miles northeast of the royal capital. Elements of
 the two battalions of government irregulars in-
 volved are now regrouping, and so far report
 casualties of 10 killed, 25 wounded, and 100
 missing. Some Lao political and military officials
 have warned that the rapid return to their home
 military regions by Lao Army and irregular units
 that had been defending Luang Prabang has left
 some gaps in the city's defensive perimeter.
 Smaller government units are being moved into
 key positions, however, and no major new Com-
 munist thrust toward Luang Prabang seems in
 prospect.

 The Communists kept up their shelling at-
 tacks and small-unit probes around the irregular
 base at Bouam Long, north of the Plaine des
 Jarres. Only limited casualties resulted, however,
 and no important positions have fallen to the
 Communists. On the southern edge of the Plaine,
 three battalions of irregulars so far have encoun-
 tered little enemy resistance to their sweep opera-
 tion northeastward from Khang Kho.
 The tempo of the war slowed somewhat in
 southern Laos. No new Communist attacks de-
 veloped in the Route 9 area of the western pan-
 handle. The only major action on the Bolovens
 Plateau occurred on 3 June when a North Viet-
 namese battalion attacked an irregular command
 post five miles east of Paksong. Government
 losses were high-27 killed, 59 wounded, and 64
 missing-but the irregulars have regrouped and
 have reported little further enemy contact.
 South Korea: Return of the Prodigal Son
 Last week Pak Chong-hui appointed Kim
 Chong-pil prime minister, marking the full return
 to public life of one of South Korea's most dy-
 namic and controversial politicians. As chief arch-
 itect of the near-bloodless coup that elevated Pak
 to power in 1961 and as founder of the govern-
 ment party, Kim was at the center of much of the
 factional strife that characterized the regime's
 early years. As head of the Korean CIA, he built a
 personal empire that made him both feared and
 powerful. In 1968, Kim was forced to the politi-
 cal sidelines when his own presidential ambitions
 almost brought him into open conflict with Pak.
 Kim's gradual re-emergence as a political force has
 been strongly resisted by his factional opponents,
 who have benefited from his political eclipse.
 Kim's appointment appears to be a reward
 for his strong efforts on behalf of Pak and the
 government slate in the recent general elections.
 Kim's political rehabilitation was also helped by
 the fact that he has long been personally close to
 the President and is married to Pak's favorite
 niece.
 Kim undoubtedly will seek to use the
 premiership to strengthen his claim to be Pak's
 political heir, but his room for maneuver will
 depend almost entirely on the President. Al-
 though Kim has considerable political appeal in
 his own right, control of the new administration
 remains firmly in the hands of Pak. Kim's cause
 could be helped by additional changes Pak may
 make among his top lieutenants. At present, the
 government party machinery is in the hands of
 Kim's enemies, but they are under fire from the
 party rank and file because of the party's rela-
 tively poor showing in the recent National As-
 sembly elections. Pak's selection of officers to
 head the new Assembly could also affect Kim's
 political prospects.
 Other cabinet changes announced along with
 Kim's appointment were largely routine and pri-
 marily designed to start Pak's third term with a
 fresh  image. The new foreign minister, Kim
 Yong-sik, is an experienced diplomat who briefly
 held the same position in 1963. Significantly, Pak
 retained the key economic ministers, including

 Communist China: Present, But Not All Accounted For
 Two long-absent politburo members-Kang
 Sheng and Hsieh Fu-chih-suddenly resurfaced
 last week  during  Romanian  party chief
 Ceausescu's visit to Peking. Their absence almost
 certainly was due to political troubles, but it is
 not yet clear that either man has regained his
 previous stature or that the jockeying for position
 within China's uneasy ruling coalition has ended.
 Indeed, the press treatment accorded the brief
 reappearance of both men, who appear to repre-
 sent opposite ends of the political spectrum on
 the politburo, seemed an unusually contrived at-
 tempt by their supporters to demonstrate that
 neither side has permanently lost ground in the
 complex behind-the-scenes struggle in Peking be-
 tween ultraleftists and putative moderate leaders.
 The actual power of both Kang and Hsieh has
 diminished considerably over the past year and it
 is possible that neither man has won full political
 rehabilitation. In any case, continued rumors that
 Chen  Po-ta-Mao's long-time secretary and
 China's fourth ranked politburo member-has
 been purged, the conspicuous absence last week
 of some other key figures associated with the
 ultraleftist or more conservative forces, and nu-
 merous reports of crackdowns on extremist ele-
 ments all suggest that a number of crosscurrents
 are roiling the waters in Peking.
 Kang Sheng, who ranks fifth in the party
 hierarchy and who was a leading figure on the
 extremist side during the Cultural Revolution,
 was present at a major reception for Ceausescu on
 3 June attended by Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao.
 Kang was listed in his customary place among the
 regime's top leaders, indicating that he formally
 retains his position on the elite politburo standing
 committee. Nevertheless, he failed to participate
 in substantive talks with the Romanians and did
 not appear with his colleagues at subsequent re??
 ceptions.
 Also on 3 June, but well after the report
 that Kang had reappeared, the Chinese press re-
 leased a remarkable article featuring the call made
 later that day on the Romanian delegation by
 Hsieh Fu-chih, his first recorded public appear-
 ance in over a year. The article accorded Hsieh all
 his usual titles, except that of public security
 minister, and by simply noting that other digni-
 taries such as Chou En-lai and Madame Mao were
 also  "present on the occasion" gave what
 amounted to extraordinary billing for Hsieh. Be-
 cause Hsieh's visit had the appearance of having
 been hastily contrived and Kang's re-emergence
 was clearly ceremonial in nature, the whole exer-
 cise had the effect of projecting both men as rep-
 resentatives of opposing  forces within the elite
 rather than as powerful figures in their own right.
 Despite his impressive list of party and govern-
 mental positions, for example, Hsieh does not
 appear to be actually performing any of his varied
 duties at present.
 In a broad sense, much of the maneuvering
 within the politburo since it was formed two
 years ago has stemmed from the efforts of ultra-
 leftist ideologues long close to Mao to strengthen
 their political positions in the face of countervail-
 ing moderate pressures. In recent months the po-
 litical seesaw in Peking has appeared to tip in
 favor of the moderates, and a concerted effort
 appears to have been made to thrust one ultraleft-
 ist leader, Chen Po-ta, to the political sidelines.
 Similar efforts have been made since last fall to
 circumscribe the authority of his colleague Kang
 Sheng, but he now appears to have gained some
 sort of reprieve which may be intended by Mao
 himself to demonstrate that the political seesaw
 has been tipping too far and that the voices of the
 left in regime councils are not to be completely
 silenced.

 discouraging to the many Filipinos who had

 the electorate is entitled to know how its dele-

 chicanery that has been going on in the ostensibly
 nonpartisan assemblage. The Marcoses have been
 busily buying delegates, despite their efforts to

 EUROPE
 Ceausescu Raises Soviet Hackles While in Peking
 Tensions in Soviet-Romanian relations have
 surfaced again in the past ten days as a result of
 Romanian leader Ceausescu's nine-day official
 visit to Peking. Given a tumultuous reception
 there by Premier Chou En-lai and other Chinese
 luminaries, Ceausescu later met with Chairman
 Mao prior to embarking on an unprecedented
 tour of south China escorted by Chou.
 The  warmth  of the  Chinese leg of
 Ceausescu's trip to the Far East-later stops will
 be Pyongyang, Hanoi, and Ulan Bator-was evi-
 dent in statements by Chinese leaders and articles
 in the Chinese press. The communique issued on
 the Romanian's departure followed predictable
 lines in restating Peking's and Bucharest's favorite
 and often self-serving formulas, albeit in low key.
 The communique's omission of extreme Chinese
 formulations on ideological and foreign policy
 issues underscored Ceausescu's insistence on
 maintaining a balanced and independent posture.
 Meanwhile, political winds from Moscow ob-
 viously were intended to cast a chill over the visit.
 Already nervous over China's "ping pong diplo-
 macy" and other moves to improve Sino-US rela-
 tions, Radio Moscow and the Soviet army news-
 paper, Red Star, came down hard on Ceausescu's
 trip even as the Romanian delegation was en
 route to Peking. Moscow used a Romanian-
 language broadcast to remind Bucharest pointedly
 of the harm China has done to socialist unity, and
 one Moscow commentator even cited the Soviet-
 Romanian treaty of July 1970 and the Warsaw
 Pact charter to stress the importance that socialist
 countries attach to "coordinating their foreign
 and domestic policies."
 The Romanians recognized from the outset
 that Ceausescu's trip would antagonize Moscow
 but they apparently are not overly concerned.
 Moscow's expected lectures will thus be noted
 with equanimity. Ceausescu's statements in China
 welcoming closer ties with Peking make clear to
 all concerned that Bucharest intends to maintain
 and even flaunt in the Communist and non-Com-
 munist  worlds  its  unique  freedom  of  ma-

 The search for national unity, the main
 theme of the 18th session of the party presidium
 last week, was spurred on by recommendations
 that party and defense organs take the lead in
 making this a reality. To ensure that the planned
 government decentralization does not weaken the
 federation, the  presidium  proposed  increased
 party assertiveness in safeguarding federal inter-
 ests and more extensive popular involvement in
 national defense.
 Presidium chairman Veljko Vlahovic's tough
 keynote speech to the 52-member body charged
 that "uncontrolled spontaneous development" in
 society had gone far enough and that the party
 itself was guilty of "unprincipled compromises,"
 defensiveness, and passivity, all of which con-
 tributed to the recent political crisis. Vlahovic
 referred to the presidium's previous session in late
 April at Brioni, which dealt behind closed doors
 with disturbing nationalist tendencies. He con-
 cluded that the party must assert its proper role
 of controlling the pace and scope of the govern-
 mental reorganization.
 Vlahovic indicated that the top party leader-
 ship is to be restructured, in keeping with Tito's
 reform plans. Vlahovic stressed that the party

 NATO After Lisbon
 The discussions of the foreign ministers last
 week reflected the different views within the Al-
 liance on how to promote detente while pre-
 serving Western security.  The European allies
 were cautious about exploring Soviet overtures on
 mutual and balanced force reductions (MBFR),
 but at the same time they were prepared to ac-
 knowledge progress in the Berlin talks and to
 soften the tone of NATO's insistence on a Berlin
 agreement before beginning multilateral prepara-
 tions for a Conference on European Security
 (CES).
 The procedures approved by the allies for
 initially probing Soviet attitudes on MBFR-con-
 tinued bilateral explorations followed by a meet-
 ing of the NATO deputy foreign ministers-were
 those advocated by the US. The idea of even-
 tually appointing an emissary or emissaries from
 the Alliance to prepare for MBFR negotiations
 was adopted at Canadian urging. Although the
 European allies, except France, were willing to go
 as far as the combined US-Canadian approach,
 they remain suspicious of Soviet intentions. The
 West Germans, for example, are probably still
 concerned despite recent public expressions to
 the contrary, that early multilateral talks on force
 reductions would undercut Western leverage in
 the Berlin talks.
 Paris did not associate itself with the MBFR
 decisions, but its urging of allied caution on
 MBFR has brought it closer to involvement in
 NATO consideration of force reductions than at
 any time in the last two years. The French say
 they are concerned-as are the British and some
 other allies-that force reductions on terms ac-
 ceptable to the Soviets would weaken West Euro-
 pean security. Foreign Minister Schumann has
 emphasized that  Moscow may hope through

 Schumann exhorted his European colleagues
 at the ministerial to face up to the prospect of
 reductions of US troops by increasing national
 defense efforts instead of hoping for MBFR. The
 inclination, however, of many of the European
 allies-including the French-will be to seek in-
 creased security in the context of a broader de-
 tente instead of through domestically difficult
 increases in their defense budgets. This inclination
 translates into considerable latent support for an
 eventual CES, which, in spite of its standing as a
 Soviet proposal, is considered by many of the
 allies of potential advantage to the West. This
 attitude was reflected in the desire of most of the
 allies to modify the wording of the Berlin-CES
 linkage to make it less offensive to the Soviets.
 Early commentaries by the Soviets on the
 NATO meeting attributed what they called the
 "purposely vague expressions" of the NATO com-
 munique to disagreement among the allies. The
 Soviets' own position on the relationship between
 MBFR and CES has hardly been a model of
 clarity. In a flurry of visits to Western capitals
 before the NATO meeting, Soviet diplomats, in-
 cluding Deputy Foreign Minister Tsarapkin, cre-
 ated confusion with their vague presentations on
 the timing of MBFR talks relative to a CES and
 on the question of whether force reduction talks
 could deal with foreign or indigenous forces, or
 both. It is, indeed, uncertain how far Moscow's
 own planning has progressed. According to Ro-
 manian Deputy Foreign Minister Gliga, there has
 been no Warsaw Pact stu y of MBFR.

 signs may provoke either the retention of or
 changes in the coalition government of Prime
 Minister Emilio Colombo, which now includes
 Christian  Democrats, Socialists, and                                                                     Social
 Democrats.
 Immediately before recessing for the elec-
 tions, the government stepped up parliamentary
 activity on social. and economic reforms to en-
 hance its parties' prospects in the contest, which
 will renew the regional assembly of Sicily, the
 provincial councils of Rome and Foggia, and 158
 municipal councils. Three major reforms on
 which progress was made concern housing, the
 universities, and taxes.
 The Christian Democrats are on the defen-
 sive in the election campaigns, particularly in
 Sicily, Genoa, and Rome. In these areas they face
 voter reaction against poor administration, un-
 satisfactory economic conditions, and several re-
 cent spectacular crimes. They are running scared
 but are maintaining their usual electoral unity,
 and are warning that neo-Fascist gains would
 ultimately help the Communists. Both the Social-
 ists and the Social Democrats are emphasizing the
 need for reforms, but the latter are more strongly
 opposed to legislative cooperation with the Com-
 munists for this purpose.
 The neo-Fascists of the Italian Social Move-
 ment (MSI) are campaigning more aggressively,
 confidently, and expensively than in the past,
 appealing to conservatives' fears of a leftward
 drift, as well as to growing popular nostalgia for a
 more ordered society. The MSI, which polled five
 percent in nationwide elections last year, is ex-
 pected to improve its position, taking votes at
 least from the right-wing Liberals and Monarchists
 and perhaps from the government parties as well.
 The Italian Communist Party (PCI) is also
 emphasizing law and order and devoting particu-
 lar attention to Sicily, where it has strengthened
 its forces with 48 activists sent from the mainland
 for propaganda and organizational work. In the
 last Sicilian election in 1967, the Communist vote

 dropped from 24 to 21 percent, but the Proletar-
 ian Socialists, then newly organized and sup-
 ported by Moscow, more than made up for the
 difference by polling five percent. This year the
 two parties are running together in a number of
 contests, and the Communists are likely to show
 an improved standing.
 The Colombo government has been in power
 for ten months, a relatively long time for Italian
 governments in recent years. In each of the past
 three years, moreover, a serious cabinet crisis has
 occurred in June or July. The government may
 nevertheless hope that political  maneuvering
 linked to the presidential election next December
 will help it to survive if the voting indicates no
 major shift against the coalition parties in this
 month's  elections.

 Iceland:  Parliamentary Election Outcome Cloudy
 After a two-month-long, dull and desultory
 campaign, Icelanders go to the polls on 13 June
 to elect a new parliament. Confronted with the
 largest electorate on record because the voting age
 was lowered from 21 to 20 and with increasing
 fragmentation at the left end of the political
 spectrum, Icelandic politicians are reluctant to
 predict the outcome of the election.
 The present coalition, consisting of the con-
 servative Independence Party and the Social Dem-
 ocrats,. has been in power since 1959 and bears
 the onus for the nation's record of sustained
 economic maladjustment, marked by rapid infla-
 tion and repeated devaluations of the krona. At
 the same time, the country's principal economic
 asset-its herring fisheries-went from boom to
 bust between :1965 and 1970, and Iceland has had
 to readjust its fish processing and marketing to
 turn a. profit from other varieties of fish, such as
 cod and capelin.
 Intensive overfishing by British, German,
 and East European fleets has been blamed for the
 disappearance of the herring from its traditional
 grounds off Iceland. To protect the nation's mari-
 time resources, all parties agree that Iceland's
 fishing limits should be considerably extended
 from their present 12-mile line, but the govern-
 ment and opposition are sharply divided as to
 how far and how fast to extend them. The gov-
 ernment's proposal, adopted on the eve of parlia-
 ment's dissolution and the opening of the cam-
 paign, calls for the appointment of a committee
 to draft legislation setting a 50-mile fisheries
 limit, but it does not commit itself to any time-
 table. The defeated opposition proposal called for
 the unilateral establishment of a 50-mile fisheries
 limit and a 100-mile antipollution zone by 1
 September 1972.
 While presiding over the transformation of
 the nation's fisheries, the government has begun
 to take timid steps toward diversifying Iceland's
 economic base. Despite opposition cries that it is
 promoting  pollution  and a foreign economic
 take-over, the coalition has encouraged new in-
 dustries financed by outside capital and based on
 Iceland's abundant power resources. After many
 years of hesitation, the government also finally
 brought the country into the European Free
 Trade Association (EFTA) in 1970. The subse-
 quent efforts of major EFTA members to obtain
 membership in the European Communities (EC)
 has been greeted with malicious satisfaction by
 the opposition, especially as the government has
 been obliged to begin treating with the EC with-
 out evidence to present to the xenophobic public
 that the decision to enter EFTA was a wise one.
 All but ignored in the campaign have been
 Iceland's foreign  policy,  its membership  in
 NATO, and the continuance of the US-Iceland
 Defense Agreement, with its provision for the
 presence of 3,000 alien forces, with 2,000 de-
 pendents, sitting on the doorstep of the capital
 and controlling the country's only international
 air gateway. Only the Communist-dominated
 People's Alliance has raised these issues, and then
 just for the record.

 The situation within the respective political
 parties presents no key to the outcome of the
 election. The Independence Party and the agrar-
 ian Progressive Party have only recently patched
 up a number of internal disputes, and neither
 group's leaders have the full confidence of their
 rank and file. On the left, the emergence of the
 Liberal Left Party, after a long gestation, has
 drawn off support from both the Social Demo-
 crats and the People's Alliance. Numerous inter-
 nal splits in the new party in the course of the
 campaign, however, have placed its viability in
 question. At the same time, a small group of
 Moscow-oriented Icelandic Communists, unhappy
 with the 1968 amalgamation of its party with the
 People's Alliance, has banded together in the
 Reykjavik Socialist Society and announced its
 refusal to support People's Alliance candidates.
 Between the People's Alliance and the Reykjavik
 Socialist Society stands the Brigade, a group
 based on a one-time Communist youth organi-
 zation, which  is offering its support to the
 People's Alliance on a candidate-by-candidate
 basis. Ideologically unclassifiable is the newly
 created Candidature Party, a youth group whose
 sole program is protest, yet its few candidates
 could take enough votes from the established
 parties to upset close contests.
 With only a two-seat majority in parliament
 and facing the prospect that they will lose just
 enough to push them out of power, the two
 parties in the governing coalition are looking for
 suitable partners to broaden their parliamentary
 base. The most likely candidate is the Liberal Left
 Party, if it can survive the elections with at least a
 few seats and its internal organization intact. If
 this alternative fails and the coalition parties lose
 their majority, there is some sentiment among
 members in the Independence Party to dump
 their long-time Social Democratic partners and
 replace them with the conservatives' old adver-
 saries, the Progressive Party.                   I
 UN-USSR: Secretary General Thant will meet

 during a lengthy trip that will include stops in
 Ethiopia, Mongolia, Poland, and Geneva-the site
 of the UN's European headquarters. The Soviet
 Union is believed still to favor another term for
 Thant and probably will seek to dissuade him
 from his oft-repeated intention not to serve again.
 Thant's latest statement-delivered at a press
 conference on 3 June-was a bit more categorical
 than previous ones in that he expressed doubt
 that an impasse over the succession would de-
 velop and, for the first time, indicated he would
 return to Burma upon retirement.
 There has been a considerable proliferation
 of candidacies, announced and unannounced, in
 recent weeks, and this trend is likely to continue
 given the rising presumption that Thant may not
 be available. Helsinki is pushing hard for its UN
 delegate, Max Jakobson, despite supposed Arab
 opposition based on his Jewish background. The
 Finn's supporters claim that their soundings have
 uncovered no firm Arab  osition.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Israel-Egypt: Both Sides Still Far Apart on Suez Agreement
 Policy statements this week in both Israel
 and Egypt detailed the large areas of disagreement
 that stand in the way of any interim agreement
 on the opening of the Suez Canal.
 In a major foreign policy speech to the
 Knesset on 9 June, Prime Minister Golda Meir
 reiterated Israel's basic terms for an interim Mid-
 dle East accord that would include the reopening
 of the Suez Canal. Mrs. Meir listed nine condi-
 tions that her government is demanding:
 Israel with new weapons, especially aircraft, to
 rectify what she termed the unequal arms balance
 caused by Soviet supplies to Egypt.
 In a speech on 8 June to troops along the
 Suez Canal, Egyptian President Sadat renewed his
 offer of 4 February to open the canal "if the
 Israelis are ready to withdraw in the first stage as
 part of the total withdrawal." Sadat listed three
 conditions for Egyptian agreement to an interim
 accord on the clearing of the canal:
 -fighting on the canal must not be renewed;
 -Egypt must clear and operate the waterway;
 -free passage must be assured for all shipping, includ-
 ing Israeli vessels;
 -no Egyptian or other armies can cross the canal;
 -effective and agreed supervision procedures must be
 provided for the agreement;
 -there must be adequate means to deter any viola-
 tions;
 -the evacuation of Israeli forces from the canal would
 not lead to a further withdrawal before a final peace;
 -the new line held by Israeli forces would not be
 considered the permanent boundary;
 -a permanent boundary would be determined in a
 peace treaty.
 The Israeli prime minister commented that
 the prospects for reopening the canal have suf-
 fered as a result of the Soviet-Egyptian treaty and
 recent pronouncements by Egyptian President
 Sadat. She also appealed to the US to supply
 -Egyptian forces .must be allowed to cross to the East
 Bank;
 -the cease-fire would be limited to six months; if a
 final settlement is not reached and total withdrawal
 not achieved in that time, Egyptian forces would
 have the right to complete the liberation of their
 territory;
 -Cairo would not concede any territory, either
 through "lease" or through bargaining; the Egyp-
 tians consider the border the recognized interna-
 tional boundary with Palestine.
 Addressing himself to the US, Sadat said, "If
 the US supports Israel in the occupation of our
 land, I will treat the US as Israel's partner." In an
 obvious appeal for greater US pressure on Israel,
 Sadat noted that the US had not yet defined its

 USSR-Egypt: Military Aid Relations
 President Anwar Sadat's recent remarks on
 the Soviet-Egyptian Treaty of Friendship and
 Cooperation suggest that military aid agreements
 between the two countries are likely to revert to
 longer term commitments emphasizing a balanced
 approach in building Egyptian forces into a self-
 reliant organization.
 Sadat's objective appears to be to create a
 well-trained Egyptian armed force capable of
 repelling an Israeli attack and over the longer
 term to develop an offensive capability. At the
 same time he appears to desire a lessening of the
 current level of dependence on Soviet military
 forces in Egypt.
 Such long-term goals, if they are to be real-
 ized, would shift the focus of the Soviet military
 aid program. Since the June 1967 war there has
 been a patchwork of pacts to re-equip and train
 the Egyptians on materiel similar to that lost in
 the war and to meet immediate threats from
 Israel. There appears to have been little attention
 paid to planning for an independent Egyptian
 military establishment that could, for example,
 assume those control functions in the hands of
 the USSR since 1970. Such a goal was implicit in
 the extensive preparations for arms agreements
 prior to mid-1967. Negotiations along those lines
 Jordan:  The Noose Tightens
 The army is closing in its cordon around the
 remaining fedayeen enclaves in the north. Various
 incidents, usually involving artillery fire against
 fedayeen positions, have occurred daily since 29
 May. In the Ajlun area, the army controls most of
 the commanding heights and has concentrated a
 number of artillery and armored units around the
 town. As many as 18 armored, mechanized, and
 infantry battalions are positioned on the fringes
 of the wooded  commando redoubt between
 Jarash and Ajlun. Army and militia units control
 were under way when hostilities broke out in
 June of that year, but have never been resumed.
 Future agreements probably will encompass
 training in Egypt on the more modern types of
 equipment received since early 1970. Progression
 to later models probably also will be sought, such
 as the replacement of the MIG-21 jet interceptor
 by the swing-wing Flogger, which Moscow appar-
 ently is producing for export.
 A major effort over the next several years
 will be to raise the technical ability of Egyptian
 forces to use increasingly sophisticated Soviet
 materiel effectively. Egyptian forces over the next
 several years probably will take control of a ma-
 jority of the SA-3 surface-to-air missiles, the
 ZSU-23/4 self-propelled antiaircraft artillery, and
 a variety of electronic detection, jamming, and
 communications equipment now manned by the
 USSR. The Soviets are likely to maintain control
 of the advanced equipment of special importance
 to them, such as the SA-6 surface-to-air missile
 system and the new supersonic jet interceptors
 that arrived early this year in Egypt. The presence
 of Soviet military units in Egypt is assured for
 some years to come to protect vital Soviet instal-
 all the towns in the area, additional checkpoints
 have been set up to restrict fedayeen movement,
 and armored units have been drawn up above two
 of the refugee camps. After a siege of several
 days, troops entered the Gaza refugee camp on
 the afternoon of 7 June and searched its inhab-
 itants.

 Libya:  Money Isn't Everything
 The tremendous profits from oil have not
 yet enabled Libya to deal with its major domestic
 problems, despite the fact that its per capita in-
 come is higher than Israel's. Inadequate health
 facilities and a lack of modern housing have yet
 to be tackled, and  Premier Qadhafi himself
 stressed in a recent speech that quick solutions to
 these problems cannot be expected. Complicating
 the problem of social reform are poor government
 planning and the inability of the revolutionary
 regime to  retain the services of experienced
 Libyan civil servants.
 The premier aired some startling statistics
 about social conditions even as he promised new
 hospitals and housing. He noted that 35,000
 Libyans suffering from tuberculosis are walking
 the streets and that others are afflicted with
 scores of endemic diseases for which they are
 unable to obtain any medical treatment. "How
 can we run tens of hospitals with only 47 doc-
 tors?" Qadhafi asked, pointing out that even
 nurses are lacking. Plans for an improvement of
 health  facilities appear to  be moving ahead
 slowly; the health minister stated that bids had
 been let for two 1,000-bed hospitals, one of
 which will serve as the nucleus for a medical
 school. Staffing arrangements-the crux of the
 problem-were not spelled out.
 Qadhafi also scored the lack of housing, not-
 ing that Libya was a nation "living in huts or old
 houses," with some 35,000 persons completely
 homeless. He noted that the country lacked con-
 tractors who could build houses or pave roads.
 The government must build 10,000 houses annu-
 ally for the next five or six years, he said, in order
 to demonstrate the "greatness" of the revolution.
 In 1969, the new government inherited three
 major sources of skilled labor from the royal
 regime: former Italian colonists, largely expatriate
 oil workers, and a rudimentary civil service that
 had attracted the bulk of Libya's few literate
 citizens. The Italians were expelled en masse last
 summer and the number of foreign oil workers
 has been reduced by nationalistic pressures.
 As for the civil service, poor administration
 by the army officers who took power after the
 revolution has been gradually driving officials into
 early retirement and causing widespread discon-
 tent among those who remain. The government,
 feeling the pinch, has even sought to re-enlist
 former civil servants whom it forced out after the
 revolution, but it has had little success thus far.
 The result is that an even heavier workload must
 be borne by the government workers who are
 sticking it out.
 The Libyan police have become particularly
 discontented over the treatment they have re-
 ceived. As professionals, they resent the lack of
 trust shown them because of their pre-revolution
 service, and they are bitter about playing second
 fiddle to a generally inept army in terms of equip-
 ment and pay. An earlier government attempt to
 retire them has recently been reversed because of
 an urgent need to retain their services, but moves
 to win them over seem to have failed.
 As a result of these various basic problems,
 the young Libyan leaders will soon be faced with
 a decision on whether to use Libya's vast funds to
 employ foreign personnel in needed domestic re-
 forms or to hew to their xenophobic policy of
 wasting money on unrealizable projects.

 Pakistan:  Situation Report
 Refugees from East Pakistan continue to
 swarm into India, only to be confronted by sick-
 ness-especially cholera-and hunger. The Indian
 Government estimates that the refugees now
 number more than five million, and health offi-
 cials indicate that the death toll from cholera and
 other diseases is probably well over 5,000. Mos-
 cow has joined India in calling for urgent meas-
 ures to end the flow of refugees, including greater
 efforts to create conditions of security in East
 Pakistan so refugees would be willing to return.
 Indian relief facilities have been severely
 overtaxed by the refugees who, according to some
 estimates, are arriving at a rate of about 100,000
 per day. The land used for refugee camps is lo-
 cated mostly in low-lying areas. These sites are
 now subject to monsoon flooding, and cholera,
 which is largely confined to refugee areas, could
 spread. The local economy in border areas is also
 suffering, as prices have risen while wages for
 unskilled labor, normally not much above the
 subsistence level, have plunged dramatically. Al-
 though Islamabad recently agreed to set up camps
 on the East Pakistani side of the border to receive
 returning refugees, no facilities have yet been
 constructed.
 International relief is being coordinated by
 the UN High Commission for Refugees. Pledges of
 money and relief supplies including $17.5 million
 from the US have been received from a host of
 countries. The US, as well as the USSR, is prepar-
 ing to assist in the massive movement of refugees
 to less populated areas. In a special effort to
 control cholera, vaccines and rehydration fluids
 are to be airlifted to India for at least the next
 eight to ten weeks. India can provide foodgrains
 for the refugees from its foodgrain stockpile, but
 it already is critically short of dry milk, oil, and
 pulses. Moreover, any foodgrains diverted from
 India's stockpile of about 5.8 million tons will
 have to be replaced by imports.
 In East Pakistan food remains the key prob-
 lem. Starvation may already be occurring in some
 regions in the south hit by the cyclone last No-
 vember. A World Bank team now touring the East
 wing reported that populated areas in the north-
 west also are critically short of food and that the
 harvesting and planting of rice are being ne-
 glected. The head of the team in graphically de-
 scribing the over-all  economic stiuation, has
 commented that "if Jesus Christ were put in
 charge it would take 18 months to put the pieces
 together." Islamabad is finally showing signs of
 being responsive to international offers of aid for
 East Pakistan, but the real test of Pakistani inten-
 tions will come when UN personnel arrive for
 duty in the East.
 Economic activity in the eastern province
 remains well below normal and the US consul in
 Dacca reports that economic recovery seems to
 have reached a plateau. Prices of most commod-
 ities in the capital are not much above pre-
 hostility levels, but inflation has probably been
 held in check by a 50-percent reduction in the
 population. Production of jute goods-the East's
 major industry-was only five to ten percent of
 normal in May, and production in June is not
 expected to be much higher. Businessmen stress
 that no progress is possible until a political solu-
 tion is found and a sense of security restored to
 the community.
 The economic news from West Pakistan re-
 mains generally grim. Although foreign-exchange
 holdings rose in May for the first time in over a
 year, the increase largely reflects the unilateral
 moratorium on foreign debt. A sobering note is
 the stated intention of several factories in the
 Punjab to lay off workers. Some factories in
 Karachi already are operating one shift instead of
 three. Finally, in a move to penalize tax evaders
 and those Bengalis and West Pakistanis who
 looted East Pakistani banks, Islamabad has re-
 called its highest currency denominations. These
 denominations account for 60 percent of the
 value of outstanding currency.

 Tunisia-Italy: Seabed Boundary Dispute
 Potential Mediterranean oil deposits and a
 disputed international seabed boundary are trou-
 bling relations between Italy and Tunisia. The
 controversy, which has led to the postponement
 of the signing of agreements on fishing rights and
 economic aid, focuses on the tiny Italian islands
 of Pantelleria, Linosa, Lampedusa, and Lampione,
 which lie between Sicily and Tunisia and on the
 role these islands should play in the demarcation
 of a seabed boundary.
 The Tunisians claim that the boundary line
 should be equidistant from the Sicilian and Tuni-
 sian coasts with the islands entitled only to a
 seabed boundary corresponding to their 12-nauti-
 cal-mile territorial sea limit. The Italians, on the
 other hand, maintain that the boundary should lie
 halfway between the islands and the Tunisian
 coast, an arrangement that would give Italy a
 large part of the seabed that extends eastward
 from Tunisia.
 Italy's state-owned oil company, ENI, has
 recently conducted seismic studies in the Mediter-
 ranean, including the disputed seabed, but Italy
 refuses to share these findings with Tunisia. An
 Italian  Foreign Ministry official has admitted,
 however, that the survey has made the area in
 question  "most  interesting." Other Italian of-
 ficials maintain that the oil potential has been
 exaggerated and that a friendly settlement is still
 possible, perhaps modeled after treaties between
 Italy and Yugoslavia and between Italy and Malta.
 The Tunisians, nevertheless, are unwilling to con-
 sider any compromise until they have access to
 the seismic studies. The dispute is exacerbated by
 the recent polarization between the international
 oil companies and the producing states and by the
 fact that Tunisia's neighbors-oil-rich Algeria and
 Libya-have seized greater control over their
 petroleum resources.
 From the viewpoint of international law the
 Tunisians appear to have the stronger claim. The
 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental
 Shelf states that, in the absence of an agreement,
 the boundary will follow the median line between
 opposite coastal states unless another boundary is
 justified by "special circumstances." The Interna-
 tional Court in adjudicating the North Sea Case
 ruled that, in using equidistance or other methods
 in dividing up the shelf, equitable principles
 should be applied. The practice thus far has been
 to ignore small islands situated near the center of
 a semienclosed sea and to award to those islands
 only that portion of the seabed that lies beneath
 their territorial seas. The Italians have already
 suggested referring the dispute to international
 arbitration, which would delay exploitation of
 resources for some time.
 The issue portends many other seabed
 boundary problems as technology permits ever
 deeper sea-floor exploitation. It comes at a time
 when the UN is laying the groundwork to solve
 seabed sovereignty problems, among other Law of
 the Sea issues, at an international conference in
 1973.                                      25X1

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Violence Becomes an Issue in Chile
 The murder on 8 June of conservative Chris-
 tian Democratic leader Edmundo Perez Zujovic
 will enable President Allende to enhance his
 newly self-proclaimed role as protector of law and
 order and to carry out his threat to crack down
 hard on extremists of both the left and right.
 His most likely target now is the political
 right.
 President Allende has also publicly
 implie   rig tilt involvement by linking Perez'
 murder to that of General Schneider last October.
 Senior military officers, however, reportedly have
 discounted rightist involvement. Leaders of the
 Christian Democratic Party (PDC) have demanded
 that military intelligence services be allowed to
 share in the investigation of the murder.
 The VOP, which describes itself as a "social-
 ist and revolutionary organization of the armed
 proletariat," broke off from the better known
 leftist extremist Movement of the Revolutionary
 Left (MI R) about two years ago. The US Embassy
 says that the VOP now appears to be a mixture of
 extremists and common criminals.
 Only recently Allende authorized a crack-
 down by security forces on the MIR. Early in his
 administration he tried to co-opt the MIR by
 giving some of its members responsibility for his
 personal security and excusing their excesses on
 the grounds that he shared their ideals. On 26
 May, however, he called in the two top MIR
 leaders to warn them that they were threatening
 his programs by their incitement of violence and
 issued an ultimatum that they must support his
 government or suffer the consequences. About
 the same time, Allende's nephew and the chief of
 his bodyguard withdrew from the MIR at his
 behest, and Socialist Party leaders forced many of
 their own members to drop their ties with the
 group.
 When Allende and an official group appeared
 at the University of Concepcion, headquarters of
 the MIR, on 29 May, a student leader challenged
 the President to his face by calling for armed
 violence, and the students booed Allende's out-
 raged response. He excoriated the MIR's concept
 of revolution and its tactics and said that revolu-
 tions rest on the proletariat, not students.
 Allende's new stance may reassure the great
 majority of Chileans, perhaps most importantly
 the armed forces and police. The widespread ac-
 ceptance of his program and administration by
 Chileans was tempered initially by concern over
 his tolerance of the MIR and the violence it bred.
 Having proven his stand  for order by acting
 against the left, Allende can with impunity seek
 to pin the  Perez murder on rightist extrem-     25X1
 fists.

 was removed from his post as interior minister
 last month. Artola's arrest of a bishop was the
 immediate cause of his departure from the cabi-
 net, but there is some evidence that Velasco was
 beginning to fear the general as a potential chal-
 lenger. General Artola lacks a strong power base
 within the military, however, and now has been
 appointed military attache to France. In the
 meantime he is being closely watched because
 Velasco fears that he may try to organize a move
 based on his popular support in Lima's slum areas
 and the contacts he made while chief of the
 intelligence and security services.
 The more serious challenge to Velasco comes
 from the growing ranks of military officers dis-
 satisfied with the policies of the government.
 Fear of provoking a serious split in the mili-
 tary apparently has played a major role in pre-
 venting a confrontation between Velasco and his
 military opponents during the past two and a half
 years. The President's prestige has slipped in re-
 cent months, however, and discontented officers
 may now believe that the repercussions of his
 removal would not be too serious.
 The President, however, has survived many
 periods when his imminent removal was widely
 rumored, proving himself to be a capable political
 operator. His basic strength lies in the fact that,
 more than any of his potential successors, he has
 been acceptable to all factions within the mili-
 tary. His role in government councils has often
 been to balance the demands of the radical re-
 formers in his cabinet against the wishes of the
 moderates. It is possible, however, that the Presi-
 dent's health, or the strains of two-and-a-half
 years of being in the center of a political tug of
 war, could cause Velasco to step down voluntar-
 ily. Likewise, the scales may have tipped far
 enough in favor of the moderates to allow them
 finally to mount a successful challenge.
 Uruguay:  The Government Leans Further to the Right
 President Pacheco seems intent on pressing
 an aggressive line against leftist elements despite
 significant domestic opposition.
 His hard-line policies brought on another
 clash with the legislature on 2 June when it
 passed an education reform bill by a near unan-
 imous vote despite the  threat of presidential
 noncompliance. The bill would establish a new
 governing council for the strife-torn secondary
 schools, which have been administered by the
 government since last year. The strong congres-
 sional action has given the President some pause,
 and he has delayed action on the bill.
 There is no doubt, however, that Pacheco is
 determined to respond strongly to the general
 violence and Tupamaro terrorism. He replaced the
 minister of education, who resigned last week
 apparently because of a disagreement with the
 President over how to deal with student violence,
 with Pedro Cersosimo, a hard-lining, pro-Pacheco
 congressional deputy. Also indicative of the senti-
 ment in government have been recent statements
 of administration spokemen touting a new, vio-
 lence-prone rightist youth group that has or-
 ganized resistance to the take-over of secondary
 schools by radicals. There are already allegations
 that the government is directly supporting the
 group.
 Pacheco apparently believes-probably cor-
 rectly-that the military would support his use of
 harsh measures. It is this military support and

 Congress's  awareness  of  it  that have helped
 Pacheco win several battles with the legislature
 despite his lack of political finesse.
 The resignation of the education minister
 was accompanied    by several  other ministerial
 changes, bringing total cabinet changes to nearly
 70 during Pacheco's tenure. The net result has
 been a more obvious law-and-order slant to the
 administration, with the most recent appointees
 chiefly distinguishable for this attitude and their
 loyalty to the President.
 The President's increasingly aggressive policy
 was also demonstrated by his recent warning to
 the Soviet ambassador to cease interfering in
 Uruguayan affairs by funding the left's political
 campaign and by police harassment of the Cuban
 news agency in Montevideo. If the new leftist
 coalition appears to be gaining public support as
 the November elections approach, Pacheco will be
 sorely tempted to expel officials from the Soviet
 mission or from the Cuban news staff in order to
 divert some domestic criticism  and sully the
 reputation of the left by linking it with foreign
 elements. Mexico's recent expulsion of Soviet
 officials  probably  would  make  it  easier  for
 Uruguay to follow suit.
 Pacheco may now be inclined to use an
 expulsion for possible political gain in view of the
 fact that Uruguay's high hopes for increased trade
 with the USSR were dashed by the disappointing
 results of a recent trade mission to Moscow. In
 addition, the Communist-controlled labor sector
 promises to be a growing problem in months
 ahead, and past expulsions of Soviets have been
 followed  by  a  slackening of labor agita-

 CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION IN THE PHILIPPINES
 The constitutional convention that convened in Manila on 1 June is the culmination of
 years of growing Philippine sentiment favoring constitutional revision. The present constitu-
 tion, drafted in 1935 by an assembly very much susceptible to the "guidance" of American
 authority, was subject to final approval by President Roosevelt. Following World War I I, the
 constitution was amended at US insistence in the context of a complicated economic,
 transitional arrangement to include provisions favoring American investment. Many Fili-
 pinos understandably regard this constitution as a colonial document and, in their minds,
 this alone necessitates the present constitutional convention.
 There is, however, another factor far more important to the background of this
 convention-popular disenchantment with the domestic political status quo. Since congress
 in March 1967 first put the machinery for constitutional revision in motion, the prospect of
 a convention has generated considerable enthusiasm and interest among moderate students,
 the liberal activist wing of the Roman Catholic Church, the urban intelligentsia and, in
 general, the Filipino middle class. These reformist-minded elements see the convention as a
 chance at long last to attack the corruption and blatant abuse of power that has always
 typified Philippine government.
 Such introspection and critical self-examination hopefully mark the start of a real step
 away from the emotional Philippine conviction that the country's problems and weakness
 derive from its colonial legacy and from its continuing "imperialistic" exploitation-a
 colonial mentality that has hindered Filipino political development. Nevertheless, the
 enthusiasm that has built up around the constitutional convention appears to be largely
 naive and misplaced. There seems to be a widespread expectation within reformist circles
 that the convention will prove to have an almost mystical cathartic effect on Philippine
 politics-an idea that by replacing one constitution with another the many flaws of the
 political system can be erased.
 In actuality, the failures of the system are not rooted in the existing constitution but
 rather in the ingrained characteristics of Philippine society. Although the Philippines has the
 trappings of democracy-free elections and the regular constitutional transfer of power-the
 Filipino society and economy remain largely under the control of wealthy families, both
 long pre-eminent and newly rich. With its deep roots in Philippine society, this oligarchical
 establishment has nearly monopolized political life. Politicians are preoccupied with en-
 suring that the benefits of office accrue to themselves and their families. Nepotism and the
 abuses associated with it are condoned if not demanded by social mores. Corruption is a
 way of life. Everything about the system acts to negate a sense of responsibility as regards
 the national interest and the general welfare, and it is this, rather than a constitutional
 problem, that is the basic obstacle to good government in the Philippines.

 Although the convention will serve as a sounding board for reformist views, the last
 word on important decisions will be had by the political establishment and President Marcos
 himself. The conservative, entrenched oligarchy will not stubbornly resist and defeat all
 efforts at reform during the convention. On the contrary, consitutional reform has become
 fashionable, and everyone is for it, including the establishment, although to different
 extents and for different reasons. The convention may enact legal and technical reforms by
 the score. It remains to be seen, however, how much constitutional reform can do to alter
 long-standing political patterns.
 When Filipino reformers talk of change and reform, what they really want is the
 development of a new breed of political leadership-politicians with a sense of integrity and
 social conscience who will either transform or destroy the traditional political system. This
 new leadership is not presently in sight, and will emerge more from an evolutionary process
 than from constitution writing.
 There are, of course, positive aspects to the convention. Within certain limits it is a
 serious effort at self-correction. The process of revision, however, could be far more
 important than the end product. Throughout the discussion and debate that has already
 taken place and will continue on the convention floor, Philippine leaders hopefully will gain
 a better understanding of the social and political pressures building within Philippine society
 and perhaps develop the beginnings of a social conscience.
 It is difficult, however, to escape the conclusion that the exercise in constitutional
 reform could result in more harm than good. In the enthusiasm surrounding the convention,
 it has become common to hear public figures proclaim that the convention represents the
 last opportunity for peaceful evolutionary change in the Philippines. Regardless of how ideal
 a constitution the convention produces, however, Philippine politics are not going to be
 transformed. The unrealistic hopes and expectations being generated by the convention
 could turn into a backlash of disillusionment and a loss of faith in the system's capacity for
 self-reform. I n particular, if President Marcos' actions confirm suspicions that he intends to
 manipulate the constitutional convention into extending his term of office, popular reaction
 will be sharp. Just how serious a backlash develops, however, will depend in large part on
 what the convention does with regard to the future political ambitions of President Marcos
 and his wife.

 the first Philippine president to win a second
 term, Marcos resorted to coercion and corruption
 on a grand scale. The landslide proportion of his
 victory was not credible to the most naive ob-
 server, and the misuse of public funds on his
 behalf was a significant factor in bringing the
 Philippine Government to the verge of bank-
 ruptcy. This revelation of the enormous powers
 that can be wielded by an incumbent president
 acted as a catalyst on the reform movement and
 greatly increased the impetus for constitutional
 change. Since then, Marcos' cynical and insensi-
 tive handling of student protest, the nation's con-
 tinuing economic difficulties, and his generally
 defensive and uncertain leadership have further
 lessened his reputation. Recently Marcos has at-
 tempted to improve his image by calling for a
 "democratic revolution" and declaring war
 against "pressure groups" and "oligarchies." This
 has been embarrassingly unconvincing. In regard
 to the reform movement Marcos is suffering from
 what, in popular terms, can only be called a
 monumental credibility gap.
 Much of the anti-Marcos feeling is being gen-
 erated not within the reform movement but
 within the Philippine political establishment. In
 Manila the crescendo of anti-Marcos vituperation
 in the establishment-controlled press is intense.
 Marcos is finding himself increasingly a target as
 he moves further into what is his final term under
 the present constitution and as his opponents
 redouble their efforts to prepare the way for
 future victory for themselves. The Liberal Party,
 enfeebled by infighting and eclipsed by the pow-
 erful political machine Marcos has developed over
 the past six years, now is making every effort to
 construct new coalitions against the President.
 Many of the senior members of his own Nacion-
 alista Party are themselves in open opposition or
 engaged in secret conspiracies with the Liberals.
 In response Marcos is now completing a purge of
 the Nacionalista leadership designed to remove or
 neutralize all those not totally loyal, and es-
 pecially those who might have presidential aspira-
 tions of their own. In a country where party
 affiliation has never meant much, the political
 Special Report
 establishment now seems to be split into two
 general groups-those who support Marcos and
 those, regardless of party label, who oppose him.
 All of this has been enough to forge an
 obvious if somewhat fragile common interest be-
 tween reformers and politicians out of power.
 They are agreed that the power of the presidency
 has become too strong and could be leading to
 the perpetuation of a Marcos "dynasty." In the
 ongoing public debate on presidential reform, a
 broad consensus appears to have been reached
 favoring a single six-year term without re-election,
 as opposed to the present four-year term with
 possible re-election to a second term. The anti-
 Marcos opposition is insisting that the single-term
 stipulation should apply to Marcos, thus making
 him ineligible for re-election in the first presiden-
 tial race under the new constitution. Aside from
 getting rid of Marcos, reformists hope that a sin-
 gle-term presidency in the future will limit the
 attractiveness of the presidency, or at least the
 damage an unscrupulous incumbent could do.
 There is also a measure of public support for
 barring close relatives of an incumbent president
 from running for the office. This is patently
 aimed at the first lady, Mrs. Imelda Marcos, an
 ambitious, strong-willed woman, who, many Fili-
 pinos fear, harbors ambitions to follow her hus-
 band in the presidency.
 What started out as a nagging suspicion
 among anti-Marcos forces that the President
 would attempt to tailor the presidential clause of
 the new constitution to his own advantage has
 turned into something approaching sullen cer-
 tainty. Despite public denials of any interest in
 the presidency following the expiration of his
 term in 1973, Marcos, in private word and deed,
 has made it clear that he is not reconciled to a
 lame-duck role. Instead of seeing the constitu-
 tional convention as the capstone of his career, he
 appears to see it as an opportunity to gain further
 time in office. In talks with convention delegates
 and confidants, Marcos has expressed his approval
 and support for the six-year single term.

 Despite his efforts to line up convention
 delegates, however, it is by no means certain that
 Marcos has decided on how hard to push his
 preference to stay in office. He has not yet been
 able to get a clear picture of how serious the
 opposition to an extension of his tenure would
 be. His decision may not be reached until he
 assesses the showing of the candidates he backs in
 next November's congressional elections.
 Aside from the central question of presiden-
 tial term, widespread public support has de-
 veloped for limiting or removing some of the
 specific powers of the executive. Under the
 present constitution, a president of the Philip-
 pines, less encumbered by effective checks and
 balances than is a US president, can in many
 instances act more arbitrarily. Without concur-
 rence by congress, he can suspend the writ of
 habeas corpus, declare martial law, and in times
 of national emergency exercise legislative power.
 Reformers would like to remove or weaken such
 powers. The president now has sweeping powers
 of appointment at the national level. Reformers
 would like to limit his authority in this area,
 especially in regard to the judiciary, which in the
 past has been subject to political control. The
 financial powers of the presidency are another
 major target. Under the present system, the presi-
 dent personally controls and releases all public
 funds. This has given the president enormous
 coercive influence and has encouraged the mis-
 direction and juggling of public funds that has
 always plagued the Philippine Government. The
 convention could act in this area by making cer-
 tain appropriations, like those for the courts and
 congress, automatic and by strengthening the
 authority and autonomy of the auditor-general.
 Finally, the convention is going to spend a
 great deal of time discussing the question of
 Special Report
 decentralization.  The Philippines is a unitary
 state; jurisdiction over areas such as appointments
 and licensing, even at the local level, is ultimately
 exercised by the national executive. For some
 time there has been strong reformist sentiment to
 decentralize by allocating more authority and
 responsibilities to provincial and local govern-
 ments. After years of debate, discussion, and
 some grandiose proposals, there are a few signs
 that some of this enthusiasm is diminishing. An
 awareness is growing that the delegation of power
 to lower levels of government that are, in many
 cases, controlled by provincial political machines
 and vested interests would not necessarily be such
 a progressive move. Although the convention will
 probably institute some measure of decentraliza-
 tion, it is unlikely to go so far as to move to a
 federal or semifederal system.
 President Marcos has not shown his hand on
 these and other proposals to limit executive
 power. He certainly is not against all of them and
 could probably live with them all. His only obvi-
 ous and immediate interest is the adoption of a
 provision that will give him the opportunity to
 stay in office.
 During the past several years civic and uni-
 versity groups, scholars, politicians, and armchair
 constitutional lawyers have been enthusiastically
 engaged in studying and rewriting the Philippine
 constitution. Filipinos have been inundated with
 books and pamphlets suggesting drastic overhaul
 of the governmental structure. The principal ef-
 fect of all this debate and examination seems to
 have been growing respect for the present con-
 stitution, which is patterned basically on the US
 model, and some realization of the dangers of
 change for change's sake. The public consensus
 for change now seems to have jelled along fairly
 conservative lines, favoring fewer rather than
 many sweeping changes. There is, however, one
 substantial and rather questionable structural al-
 teration that the convention may well make-a
 move to a unicameral legislature. Early on, broad

 support developed among reformist elements in
 favor of junking the Senate and creating a unitary
 national assembly. The Senate's well-deserved
 public reputation as a corrupt, rich-man's club,
 even though one shared with the House, no doubt
 has a lot to do with sentiment for its abolition.
 Also, a lot of chic has been attached to uni-
 cameralism as a more efficient and "progressive
 system," especially within academic circles.
 Nevertheless, a move to unicameralism remains a
 dubious reform. The Senate, for all its corruption,
 has occasionally served as a useful check on the
 presidency; its abolition would clearly make life
 easier for the executive.
 Ironically, some of the strongest
 proponen s o  unicameralism are also bitter
 enemies of Marcos and advocates of a weakened
 presidency. The fact that the President and his
 wife are now actively lobbying for unicameralism
 and the abolition of the Senate will occasion
 second thoughts on the part of many reformists.
 Given the broad support unicameralism presently
 enjoys among convention delegates, however, its
 adoption must be considered a strong probability.
 There is also some talk about giving a unitary
 national assembly the right to elect the president.
 This is being put forward by some reformists as
 the  "final  solution"  to  traditionally  corrupt
 Philippine presidential elections. A number of
 delegates have also suggested having the presiden-
 tial cabinet drawn from the ranks of the National
 Assembly. Marcos himself is said to be interested
 in such a mixed presidential-parliamentary system
 because of the opportunities it would offer to
 perpetuate himself in power. It now appears that
 such a scheme will be his fallback position if he
 encounters too much opposition to his efforts to
 maintain a grip on the present presidential office.
 On balance, it seems unlikely that either reform-
 ists or politicians would dare to disenfranchise the
 Filipino people by abolishing direct election of
 the president. Marcos' interest in the possibilities
 of such a system, however, means that an attempt
 toward this scheme can by no means be ruled out.
 Special Report
 The Welfare State
 One general topic sure to get a lot of pub-
 licity and take up a large amount of the conven-
 tion's time is the question of how much and what
 kind of social reform will be written into the new
 constitution. For several years now there has been
 widespread agitation for the incorporation of a
 comprehensive social program in the new con-
 stitution. Such a program would include universal
 free education, health care, land reform, mini-
 mum guaranteed wages-in short the entire reper-
 toire of the fully developed social welfare state. A
 number  of reformers and  politicians, most
 notably former president Macapagal, are riding
 this horse for all it is worth. It would be difficult
 to find anyone opposed to such politically appeal-
 ing programs and even more difficult to find the
 money to pay for them. There is some realization,
 however, that a constitutional document is not
 the medium for formulating specific social pro-
 grams. Even the most sincere and altruistic con-
 stitutional convention could come up with little
 more than a statement of principle vaguely com-
 mitting the Philippines to eventual achievement
 of certain social objectives. Such a commitment
 may be temporarily gratifying but could even-
 tually add to discontent by raising expectations
 that cannot be met.
 The Role of Nationalism:
 US Interests Directly at Stake
 Although the bulk of the convention's atten-
 tion will be directed at the domestic issues dis-
 cussed above, anti-US nationalism is still a force
 in the Philippines and makes for good politics.
 The convention could move in a number of areas
 to complicate relations further between Manila
 and Washington.
 On the frequently troublesome issue of US
 base rights, the outlook currently seems hopeful.
 At present the question of the US military pres-
 ence is attracting very little popular attention,
 although this could change overnight given a new

 incident involving a  US serviceman.  Recent
 opinion polls have put the base issue near the
 bottom of the list of topics the people want the
 convention to tackle-another reflection of the
 new, critical public focus on domestic politics.
 Some convention delegates may generate con-
 siderable sound and fury on the base issue, and
 there will, in all likelihood, be proposals ranging
 from immediate termination of US base rights to
 demands for greater Philippine representation in
 command arrangements and more favorable terms
 in areas of criminal custody and jurisdiction.
 Nevertheless, to what extent the convention in-
 terjects itself into base questions will largely be
 up to President Marcos, who appears to want to
 keep the issue out of the convention. Negotia-
 tions between Manila and Washington for revision
 of the base arrangement have been under way for
 several months and are proceeding smoothly.
 Marcos, who has never made any bones about his
 desire to see the bases remain, now seems to want
 an agreement concluded quickly in order to pre-
 vent or discourage the convention from meddling
 in this emotional and potentially explosive area.
 A much greater problem appears to be
 shaping up in regard to possible convention de-
 cisions on economic policy and especially the
 question of US "parity" rights. In 1946 the
 Philippine constitution-under US prompting-
 was amended to allow Americans to acquire and
 engage in the exploitation of natural resources
 and  the operation of public utilities until
 1974-privileges originally restricted to Philippine
 nationals. "Parity" has persisted as a symbol of
 "US economic imperialism" and has been a major
 fuel for the fire of anti-US nationalism. Conven-
 tion delegates are now "courageously" demanding
 that parity be written out of the constitution and
 not extended beyond 1974. Despite such na-
 tionalistic rhetoric designed for public consump-
 tion, this has not been a real issue since at least
 1965 when the US officially went on record as
 not favoring an extension of parity rights. Parity,
 itself, seems destined to die a natural death in
 1974, thus depriving Filipino nationalists of one
 of their favorite whipping boys.
 Special Report
 Very much at question, however, is what
 happens to the assets and operations acquired by
 Americans in the parity area between 1946 and
 1974. The US has taken the position that such
 "vested rights" do not terminate in 1974. The
 Philippine Government has taken the opposite
 position. Before 1974, it says, US investors will
 have to reduce their equity share to 40 percent;
 the balance will have to be sold to Filipinos. The
 constitutional convention could, if it chose to do
 so, have the last word. In addition to the central
 question of vested parity rights, the convention
 also will consider other measures that could
 jeopardize American  investments outside the
 parity area. There is considerable popular demand
 that the new constitution incorporate an eco-
 nomic policy of "Filipinization," i.e., mandatory
 increased participation of Filipinos in the manage-
 ment, employment, or ownership of firms now
 controlled by foreign interests. "Filipinization" is
 primarily favored as a means of reducing Chinese
 involvement in areas such as wholesale and retail
 trade and credit, but it could conceivably affect
 all foreign business operations. A measure of sup-
 port has also been expressed for the nationaliza-
 tion of entire industries such as oil and telecom-
 munications, both areas where there has been
 considerable US investment.
 The threat to US investment aside, such a
 program of economic nationalism is bound to
 have a damaging effect on an already shaky
 Philippine economy. US commercial investment
 in the Philippines, although small in proportion to
 total US overseas investment, is significant within
 the Philippine economy. If the convention does
 act to eliminate vested parity rights, a consid-
 erable chunk of available domestic capital will
 probably be spent to buy already operating pro-
 ductive facilities rather than invested in new
 areas. Greater production and new jobs desper-
 ately needed in the Philippines will be sacrificed,
 and chances of new foreign investment will be
 further dimmed.
 How far this fact will go in tempering the
 convention's decision remains to be seen. For

 President Marcos, who has not yet shown his
 hand, economic nationalism represents a real
 problem. Given the sobering experience of the
 current Philippine balance-of-payments problem,
 his administration is in no mood to rock the
 economic boat. Nevertheless, it cannot be auto-
 matically assumed that the convention will be
 swayed by such rational and pragmatic factors.
 Even those politicians and convention delegates
 fully aware of and concerned over the dangers of
 moving against foreign investment will find it
 difficult to take a public stand against prevailing
 nationalist sentiment. More to the real point,
 Filipino economic nationalism has been and re-
 mains, to. a large degree, a very convenient inven-
 tion and tool of the Philippine establishment.
 Wealthy Filipinos now are very much aware of
 the buyer's market and fire-sale prices that will no
 doubt result if American investment is forced
 out: US divestiture is in their individual interest
 over the short term, whether or not it is in the
 national economic interest. Unfortunately, short-
 term, individual interest is all too often the basis
 for political decision in the Philippines.
 Rising Philippine nationalism quickly spills
 over into the realm of foreign policy. Although
 there is relatively little support for neutralism, the
 appearance of a more independent foreign pos-
 ture would be welcomed by many Filipinos.
 There is also growing general interest in the de-
 velopment of diplomatic ties with Communist
 states. The recent round of "ping-pong diplo-
 macy" in particular raised Philippine fears that
 Manila, with its hitherto firm anti-Communist
 line, is being left at the gate. As a result the
 convention may well adopt a constitutional com-
 mitment to peaceful relations with "all states"-a
 harmless enough measure that should please
 nearly everyone. There has also been a lot of talk
 favoring the new constitution redefining Philip-
 pine national territory to include Sabah, thus
 reiterating Manila's claim to the Malaysian state.
 Given the improving relations between Kuala
 Lumpur and Manila, it seems likely that President
 Marcos will finesse this potentially disruptive
 topic. Also in regard to Philippine national ter-
 Special Report
 ritory, Washington and Manila may be on another
 at least minor collision course. The Philippine
 Government appears determined to insert into the
 new constitution its "archipelago theory." This
 would define as territorial waters all the sea area
 bounded by the archipelago's outermost islands.
 This claim, which would restrict or prohibit non-
 Filipino navigation, fishing, and seabed exploita-
 tion in this extensive area, runs directly counter
 to the US position on law of the sea.
 The currently untroubled state of US-Philip-
 pine relations could change abruptly. Philippine
 nationalism, a genuine force in itself, is still
 subject to manipulation by the elite for political
 ends. During the Manila student demonstrations
 in early 1970, for example, President Marcos
 proved himself perfectly capable of using "red-
 herring" nationalism to divert dissatisfaction with
 him to the United States. Through overuse, how-
 ever, it has become increasingly difficult for
 Marcos to get away with this tactic. Also, given
 the embattled political and economic position of
 the administration, the President is presently
 strongly inclined to seek and ensure himself of US
 support. Nevertheless, a deliberate escalation of
 nationalistic, anti-US rhetoric and action within
 the convention is possible if Marcos or other
 establishment elements come to believe that by
 such means their own self-serving objectives and
 interests can be obscured.
 The Convention Itself.- Politics as Usual
 The tack the convention will take in han-
 dling the issues discussed above and the many
 others it may take up cannot be divined at this
 point. The convention will move slowly, running
 probably nine months to a year. The first weeks
 are likely to be confined entirely to procedural
 and organizational work. In preconvention meet-
 ings and seminars, the delegates generally showed
 a lack of concern in attending to organizational
 work. Little was accomplished, not even the
 selection of a convention chairman. The preoc-
 cupation of Philippine political parties with the
 November congressional elections suggests the

 convention will not get down to business for
 some months. There will be plenty of time for
 opposing forces to test the water and play things
 by ear. One thing seems clear, however; during
 the lengthy convention, the traditional rules of
 rough and tumble Philippine politics will apply.
 Convention delegates, mostly from rural pro-
 vincial areas, will be subjected to the persuasive
 talents of competing lobbies and interest groups,
 coerced, tempted with offers of money and posi-
 tion and, in general, plied with wine, women, and
 song. Many issues are likely to be settled in
 Manila hotel rooms rather than on the convention
 floor.
 Despite the hopes of many advocates of con-
 stitutional reform, the convention fell into the
 patterns of traditional Philippine politics when its
 320 delegates were elected last November. Given
 the special nature of the election and the bad
 taste lingering from the 1969 irregularities, the
 campaign was heavily supervised and ostensibly
 nonpartisan. Inevitably the election did not quite
 live up to its billing. In the rural barrios, name
 was far more important than constitutional issue,
 and the "personal" endorsement of the local po-
 litical boss determined many races. Most success-
 ful candidates were linked to the political parties
 and vested interests of the establishment. The
 largest bloc of winners, perhaps an outright
 majority, was associated one way or another with
 the Marcos machine. The President, however, did
 not engage in overkill along the lines of 1969.
 Enough genuine reformers, independents, and
 political opponents of Marcos were elected to
 qualify this election as reasonably honest by re-
 cent standards. All in all, the convention make-up
 mirrors the existing political situation. It reflects
 not only the great strength of the Marcos machine
 but also the growing unrest of students, intel-
 ligentsia, and other reform elements-a vocal
 minority that will make the convention some-
 thing more than a Marcos puppet show.
 Since the elections last November, the Presi-
 dent has maintained a low public posture, deny-
 ing any intention to intervene in the convention.
 Special Report
 Although Marcos has been actively trying to
 influence the selection of a pliable convention
 chairman, real power could lie in the convention's
 working committees-the  level where Marcos'
 numerical advantage is bound to pay off. In any
 case, clear indications of the extent of Marcos'
 control should emerge after the convention's
 organizational structure develops and rules of
 procedure are adopted.
 The pace of the convention will probably
 depend primarily on Marcos' strategy in regard to
 next November's senatorial and provincial elec-
 tions.  Marcos is attaching considerable  im-
 portance to these elections and may even be
 tempted to engineer a margin of victory along
 1969 lines. A big win for his slate would keep his
 political machine strong and intact. More im-
 portantly, it could be used by Marcos as a popular
 mandate justifying his desire to remain in office.
 Right now, however, the President is having some
 difficulty in putting together a strong senatorial
 slate. His purge of Nacionalista ranks has di-
 minished the number of attractive potential can-
 didates and those that remain are understandably
 reluctant to run for an office that may very well
 be abolished by the new constitution. It seems a
 good possibility that Marcos will attempt to put

 off the convention's resolution of the presidency
 issue and other important items until after the
 November elections.
 How effective the anti-Marcos opposition
 can be in countering presidential manipulation of
 the convention remains to be seen. Real coopera-
 tion between opportunistic politicians, reformers,
 and the several genuine radicals among the dele-
 gates will be difficult to achieve and even harder
 to maintain. Aware that Marcos is eager to avoid
 the impression of steam-rollering the convention,
 the anti-Marcos forceswill miss no opportunity to
 accuse him of precisely that. Public charges of
 presidential intervention, some based on fact,
 others probably fabricated, are already a daily
 occurrence in Manila. The anti-Marcos delegates
 will no doubt attempt to orchestrate their efforts
 on the convention floor with outside protest
 demonstrations. Orchestration or not, there will
 probably be plenty of action in the streets of
 Manila during the coming year on the part of
 both radical groups seeking to disrupt the conven-
 tion and moderates lobbying for reform.
 Aside from simply embarrassing Marcos, the
 opposition forces also hope to sway enough of his
 support to turn events in their favor. The anti-
 Marcos forces, who hail primarily from Manila
 and other urban areas, as a group will comprise
 the most skilled and sophisticated parliamen-
 tarians in the convention. By contrast, many of
 the  pro-Marcos delegates are inexperienced
 politicos from the provinces. Their vulnerability
 to articulate argument, parliamentary finesse, and
 outside protests and pressure could conceivably
 weaken Marcos' control. Most realistic observers,
 however, believe that the President will neverthe-
 less have the votes to control the convention-at
 least on the issues he considers vital. How deter-
 mined Marcos is to use these votes to extend
 himself in office, regardless of the public uproar it
 would cause, is a question he has not yet an-
 swered himself.
 Special Report
 The real significance of the convention lies
 in the effect it will have on the future develop-
 ment of the Philippines as a stable and democratic
 nation. In recent years the traditional Philippine
 political process has come under criticism, and
 the strains are beginning to show. Some establish-
 ment members now accuse President Marcos of
 threatening the system by his very success in
 playing the game and by his refusal to share
 wealth and power by stepping down gracefully.
 This jealous complaint is somewhat justified, but
 the real challenge to the traditional political sys-
 tem comes from a new dynamic of change and
 unrest in Philippine society. Disaffection is cur-
 rently centered in the student movement but is
 also beginning to run through the liberal wing of
 the church, the intelligentsia, and the educated
 middle class in general.
 This new mood is still largely confined to
 Manila and other urban areas. The traditional
 system still works smoothly in the barrios where
 apathy abounds and a vote can still be bought
 cheaply. What is happening in Manila--the politi-
 cal, educational, and cultural center of the Philip-
 pines-is, however, far more pertinent than the
 status quo situation that exists in much of the
 rest of the country. The city has all the ingredi-
 ents for unrest and rebellion-tremendous and
 growing disparity between rich and poor, an eco-
 nomically depressed and dissatisfied labor force,
 and the general air of urban crisis shared by many
 great cities. Most importantly, it has a university
 student population of over 300,000, who believe
 they are economically exploited (higher educa-
 tion in the Philippines is largely private and
 profitable). The current trend toward mass action
 and confrontation politics, so alien to Philippine
 tradition, is unlikely to be reversed. It has already
 shaken the establishment, and future Philippine
 Governments will have increasing difficulty in
 coming to terms with Manila and its new asser-
 tiveness. Marcos is the first president of the
 Philippines to run into the fact that building a

 powerful political machine and the ability to con-
 trol national elections are no longer enough to
 govern comfortably and effectively.
 In planning his moves in regard to the con-
 vention, Marcos will have to evaluate their effect
 on the student/reformist movement and the situa-
 tion in Manila. Exactly how he assesses this prob-
 lem and the constraints it places on him is
 unclear, but there are disturbing signs that the
 President, increasingly isolated and surrounded by
 "yes" men, does not have a good appreciation of
 the depth and nature of the popular disenchant-
 ment with him. In the past, Marcos has sought to
 dismiss the student movement as simply a Com-
 munist plot and, in traditional style, has at-
 tempted to manipulate it, buy it off, and split it
 up. In the final analysis he seems to have inter-
 preted it mainly as a personal affront. There is
 certainly little in his past record or current plans
 to indicate that he sees growing student and re-
 formist activism as expressive of sincere and
 potentially dangerous public dissatisfaction with
 his and previous Philippine administrations.
 Marcos is determined to get
 what he wants from the convention and is taking
 the steps necessary to deal with anticipated
 demonstrations in Manila. Reaction to a power
 play by Marcos would be one of outrage, but,
 Special Report
 even though there is an air of rebellion in Manila,
 a revolutionary situation does not exist. The stu-
 dent movement, for all of its troublemaking po-
 tential, remains immature, fractious, and ideolog-
 ically divided. Although an extended period of
 running confrontation in the streets might well
 result, the government should be able to maintain
 control of the situation. In the aftermath, how-
 ever, a far greater security problem might exist in
 Manila than hitherto. Martial law and/or the sus-
 pension of the convention would almost certainly
 further radicalize the student movement, broaden
 the base of violent opposition, and, in general,
 present a golden opportunity to Communist agita-
 tors and organizers.
 Marcos might still decide against pushing his
 ambitions to the point of provoking a period of
 turmoil. He still has his options open, and there is
 still time to display statesmanship by abandoning
 his efforts to retain power. He might yet decide
 that the presidency is not worth having under the
 anticipated grim circumstances. Conversely, it is
 by no means certain that the students and other
 reform elements have the strength and determina-
 tion to challenge effectively presidential manipu-
 lation of the convention or make it necessary for
 Marcos to resort to repression.
 Whatever the case, this much seems clear: at
 a time when anti-Marcos feeling and popular
 demand for reform are coalescing and reaching a
 peak, the President is at the moment planning to
 tailor the new constitution to his personal politi-
 cal ambitions. If he successfully follows through
 with these plans, there are bound to be adverse
 implications for future Philippine political de-
 velopment. Such a shabby ending to years of
 enthusiasm for constitutional revision would go
 far toward destroying moderate faith in the sys-
 tem's capacity for self-reform, place further
 strains on the traditional Philippine political
 process, and in all likelihood usher in a new and
 uncertain period of sharpened popular disaffec-
