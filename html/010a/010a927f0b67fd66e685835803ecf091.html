 WESTERN EUROPE
 Goethe's..famous line that "nothing is:harder
 to bear than a succession of fair days" would
 raise a few mirthless laughs from European leaders
 during a winter that has known few fair days either
 politically, economically or meteorologically.
 During the month the full vital statistics of 1974's
 grim economic, situation came out, showing:
 Germany
 7.5%
 + $9.7
 France
 15%.
 -- $6.7
 UK
 20%
 -- $8.7
 Italy
 19%
 - $8.6
 But worse, according to most expert predictions, is
 yet to come---with the first half of this year to see
 growth rates approaching postwar lows and unemploy-
 ment postwar highs.   Small wonder Europeans looked
 hard for any glint of silver linings.   "Good news:
 trade deficit less than predicted," ran a lead head-
 line in La Stampa while one in The Times gloated,
 "C152m drop in Britain's monthly trade deficit," even
 though that particular deficit was one of the worst
 in British history.   These days less disastrous news
 equals good news.
 The two headlines say a lot about the current
 European mood.   Following months of deep popular
 apprehension and grim warnings.by government leaders
 about economic crisis--after inflation did in fact
 go up and employment down--Europeans found comfort in
 the fact that bad as things were, they could be worse
 and that the rate of economic decline appeared to be
 tapering off.

 2..
 Amid the Encircling Gloom
 Now that Europe finds itself in the middle of
 the long-awaited crunch, what were the social and
 political effects of this severe recession?  The most
 obvious characteristic of the January scene was
 stability.   There was none of the social disorder
 that had been widely feared and no appreciable trade,
 union agitation, except in Spain and Portugal and
 there as much for political as economic reasons.
 Politically there was no spread of extremism, and par--
 .liamentary opposition parties behaved with remarkable
 restraint.  Apparently the warnings by government
 leaders last fall convinced the public that the eco-
 nomic crisis, being world-wide, was bigger than any
 individual country and not primarily the responsibility
 of the government in power.   In'November and December,
 as unemployment replaced inflation as the primary worry,
 most government leaders were seen to move quickly to
 combat it.
 The question now is how far public patience can
 be stretched.   In France and the UK unemployment in
 January is well over 700,000 and is climbing steadily
 .toward the million mark which, as Embassy London pointed
 out, is the panic figure in Britain.   In Germany the
 million figure was passed during the month.  But though
 the outlook for unemployment and growth rates is bad
 for the coming six months, it is extremely unlikely
 that any European government will fall as a result.
 In Germany and Britain, however, the situation is
 precarious for deeper reasons, and continued economic
 difficulties could help to precipitate a political crisis
 sometime in the spring.
 Shadowboxing on the,Rhine
 In Germany most everyone likes Helmut Schmidt
 but fewer and fewer people like his party.   To the
 latest pollster's question,  "If an election were held
 today, which party would you vote for?", they responded:

 Christian Democrats
 53%
 Social Democrat.$
 38%
 Free Democrats
 7%
 Moreover, in the six forthcoming Land elections,
 the Social Democrats face, largely for local reasons,
 electoral losses of greater or lesser magnitude,
 paralleling those in last fall's elections in Bavaria
 and Hesse.   The question is whether Schmidt's prestige
 can be turned to his party's advantage or whether his
 party will drag him down.
 For the Free Democrats the situation is even
 more menacing since politically they exist at the
 subsistence level.   Not surprisingly there was in-
 creasing speculation during the month that the FDP
 might jump to the Christian Democrats, destroying
 Schmidt's government but saving themselves.   On the
 Land level it was not just talk.   The party organiza-
 tion in Rhineland-Palatinate announced on January 11
 that it would like to join the CDU in a coalition
 after the March election.   However, a similar proposal
 in North Rhine Westphalia, which could bring down the
 Bonn government, was promptly` suppressed by the party's
 leader, Foreign Minister Genscher, and this brought an
 end for the moment to the party's drift.   Both Genscher
 and other party officials have assured Embassy Bonn
 that they expect their party to survive in the forth-
 coming elections and to remain in the Bonn coalition
 until the federal election next year--and even beyond.
 But this sounds like bravado, and defeats at the polls
 might bring a sudden change of heart.
 Being divided and leaderless, the Christian Demo-
 crats are not in a position to exploit these signs of
 coalition weakness.   Like bawling Nibelungs, the CDU
 chieftains have been almost as concerned to keep one
 another from power as to seize it for themselves.  Will
 a Siegfried--the lout who is fearless--push them all
 aside and take the prize for himself?  That was the
 question as Franz-Josef Strauss appeared to be preparing

 perhaps a final time -he is 60--to take command of
 the patty.   The spring election campaigns may show
 whether Strauss can live down his past and develop
 the nation-wide appeal to take leadership of the
 party or will remain its perennial second most power-
 ful man.
 Britain's Labor Pains
 Perhaps nothing during the month caught the
 condition of Britain better than the fact that unem-
 ployment and strike figures could not be issued
 because of a strike by government statisticians.   In
 fact the strike situation has become so grave that
 Wilson--in an action that never comes easily to a
 Labor leader--strongly condemned striking auto workers,
 pointing out that as a result of"such walk-outs in
 that industry alone 350,000 man days  (20% of the man
 days of the whole industry) had been lost during 1974..
 Other economic developments during the month
 were equally disheartening.   Demand continues to
 weaken and unemployment to rise.   New orders are fall-
 ing off in major industries and the investment outlook
 is dismal.   Prices continue to increase.   On the point
 of collapse, Burmah oil joined the ranks of major
 British firms requiring government assistance to survive.
 Doctors and dentists rejected government proposals re-
 garding pay and private patients.  And even the deus ex
 machina in the form of North Sea oil suddenly lost some
 of its attraction for investors.
 The politically most serious element in this
 situation was the growing potential for a split between
 the government and the trade unions.   Finance Minister
 Healey in a speech in early January warned workers
 that they have the choice between unemployment and a
 reduction in wage increases, which had gone up on an
 average of 29% in 1974.   Their casuistry equal to any
 test, the trade unions denounced the latter proposi-
 tion as a pay cut, and consequently the social contract

 could stretched to the. snapping point.-  Although
 a break between the government and the unions is
 not yet inevitable, the differences which have
 begun to-surface summon up the specter of the cold
 war between them during Wilson-'s second administra-
 tion, which itself was in fact brought down by the
 unions in 1.970.
 As the strain in relations increases, the tensions
 between the left and right within the government and
 the unions are growing.   During the month there were
 signs that Britain's version of Strauss, Tony Benn,
 was preparing to make his move for power; it is anti-
 cipated that he will soon resign, possibly over the
 EC issue, and lead a left-wing challenge to Wilson's
 leadership.   Benn's--and Wilson's--future could hang
 as much on the EC referendum as Schmidt's and Strauss'
 .as
 the Land elections.   The referendum, scheduled for
 late June, is becoming one of the most divisive issues
 of recent British history.   Anti-EC groups have formed
 a broad coalition with the most influential trade
 union leader, Jack Jones, agreeing to play a leading
 -role in it.   Bringing together the extreme right of
 the Tories with the extreme left of Labor, the referen-
 dum will not only have historic significance for Europe
 but possibly also an important incidental impact on
 domestic British politics.
 A Pink Dawn in the South?
 The month's trends in Southern Europe generally
 pointed to the left.   The mini-"historical compromise"
 between the Christian Democrats and communists in
 Venice was reinacted during the month by local Chris-
 tian Democratic party organizations in several other
 areas of Italy.   This development is further evidence
 of increasing Christian Democratic interest in reaching
 some practical accommodation with local communist parties.
 The decision of both the Christian Democrats and com-
 munists to support abortion legislation is another sign

 of the social and..political shifts now taking, place
 in Italy.
 There are also signs of growing fermentation in
 Spain though-almost everyone remains paralyzed--or
 hypnotized--by Franco.   However, recent weeks have seen
 some of the worst labor troubles in Spain since the
 civil war--work stoppages, plant sit-ins, retaliatory
 walk-outs, firings and battles with the police..  Most
 of these difficulties started with economic motivations
 but became rapidly political once under way.  While
 all strikes in Spain have a political character since
 they are illegal, the one entirely political strike
 was the general strike in the Basque country last
 month which got out 150,000 workers, as such the most
 successful strike since the civil war.   The focus of
 labor unrest in January shifted to Barcelona and to
 a lesser extent Madrid.   The prospects are for labor
 agitation to go on.
 In Portugal the struggle for power became more
 open during the month.  Although communist popular
 support was slipping, the general trend of developments
 was clearly to the left.  While the moderates in the
 Armed Forces Movement remained in the majority, the
 leftists in the Movement have the upper hand and
 increasingly acted in collusion with the communists.
 In the several showdowns during-January, the left
 consequently had its way.  A communist-supported labor
 law that places the trade union movement under commu-
 nist domination, thereby providing the communists with
 a sure power-base, was approved over the opposition of
 socialists and moderates.  In Oporto on January 25
 leftists successfully forced the cancellation of a
 conservative Center Democratic Social Party convention.
 The military themselves banned the socialist rally to
 be held in Lisbon on January 31.   But the moderates
 are beginning to organize themselves and could do well
 in the April election--though this very prospect could
 provoke the left to postpone or cancel it.

 Chinks in the Soviet Western Flank
 The visits to Peking in January of Dutch Foreign
 Minister van der Stoel and Franz-Josef Strauss, who
 was unexpectedly invited to see Mao, highlight the
 recent, progress in Chinese-European relations.
 Since their opening to the West at the beginning
 of the decade, the Chinese have increasingly seen
 Western Europe as a central element in their objec-
 tive of-political and psychological encirclement of
 the Soviet Union.   The stream of European visitors
 to Peking in recent years have all heard the same
 litany:   Europe should maintain a close alliance with
 the United States; NATO conventional forces should be
 strengthened; US-European military cooperation must
 be sustained; and the American troop presence in
 Europe must be preserved.  At the same time the
 Chinese condemned as a Soviet deception the whole
 detente policy as manifested in Ostpolitik, SALT, MBFR
 and CSCE.   Keeping up a strong political and military
 guard, they insisted, was in the West's own best
 interest since Europe rather than China was the
 primary target of Soviet aggression.   The Soviet
 Union, they told German Foreign Minister Scheel in
 1972, was merely making "a feint to the East while
 attacking the West," a statement repeated publicly in
 August 1973 and subsequently by.Chou himself.
 More and more Europe has become the focus of
 Chinese interest, flattery and cajolery.   In the past
 six or seven months alone Makarios, Heath, Kohl,
 Mintoff, Hartling, van der Stoel and Strauss have
 visited Peking, and Schmidt, Rumor and Tindemans will
 soon follow.   In April Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping
 went to Paris and in October Vice Minister of Foreign
 Affairs, Chiao Kuan-hua, visited Bonn and Paris.   In Bonn
 Chiao spoke out for German reunification, and there
 was some press comment at the time that this support
 of what is still an official goal was a welcome courtesy
 that had not been heard in some time by foreign visitors
 to Germany.

 8 -
 As-the pace 'of -contacts in recent months increased,
 the Chinese attitude toward Europe was given a new
 twist.   In the wake of US-Soviet detente, Watergate
 and the strain on US-European relations, the Chinese
 began to deal with Europe separately from the United
 States.   This new approach was publicly enunciated
 last April by Teng at the special session of the UNGA
 when he said that Europe has a common bond with the
 Third World in the need to oppose superpower hegemony.
 One sees here a second important strand of Chinese
 policy and one representing a longer-term strategy:
 an independent Europe standing in opposition to both
 the United States and the Soviet Union.
 Chou took up these themes in his January 13
 speech to the National People's Conference, and gave
 in addition his first public endorsement of European
 integration.   The new approach is further reflected
 in Chinese trade policy in which preference is occa-
 sionally shown for European over American products.
 Moreover, after years of raising and dropping the
 question of formal relations with the European Com-
 munity, the Chinese have apparently decided to move
 ahead, informing van der Stoel during the month that
 they hope to accredit a mission-to the Community in
 March or April.
 At the moment the Chinese are following both
 approaches--Europe with the United States and Europe
 vs the superpowers--merely changing emphasis as seems
 expedient.   In their meetings early in January with
 an der Stoel, for instance, they called for Western
 Europe to develop an independent and credible nuclear
 force while with Strauss a few. days later they stressed
 that American and European security interests are in-
 separably intertwined or, as Teng put it,  "American
 defense begins in Europe."  There is no evidence so far
 that the Chinese are working against our interests in
 Europe, and in their meetings with Strauss they argued
 strongly for a continued American assumption of much
 of the European defense burden.

 Peking's "guest list" and the views expressed
 to the.visitors it make it obvious that the-Chinese
 are most comfortable with conservatives and old-
 fashioned anti-communists.                                    Our Liaison Office in
 Peking links Strauss' exceptional treatment with a
 statement by Chiao that the most dangerous forces
 in Europe are the liberal-socialist governments,
 duped by Soviet detente propaganda but, thanks to
 the economic crisis, soon to be replaced by conserv-
 ative governments less taken in by Moscow.   The.
 question arises whether this approach could give the
 Chinese some scope for mischief in domestic European
 politics.
 Although a trip to China is now one of the rites
 of political leadership, European governments continue
 to regard their political relationship with Peking
 as essentially platonic.  Apart from some trade pro-
 spects, they see at the moment little in China for
 themselves.   Nor are they apt to be a good long-term
 proposition for China.   They will sooner or later
 have to puncture China's dream of turning them and
 the EC into instruments of anti-Soviet policy.   Helmut
 Schmidt did precisely this when he told Chiao that
 security and detente are mutually supporting and that
 the Chinese defense of Arab oil policy conflicts with
 their desire for a strong, unified Europe.  And it is
 significant that upon his return to Bonn, Strauss met
 with Schmidt and joined him in a public statement that
 the Federal Republic has no intention of improving its
 ties with Peking at the expense of relations with the
 Soviet Union.
 In sum, China has some importance to the British
 because of Hong Kong, may exercise a lurid attraction
 to the German right-wing, appeases French antagonism
 to superpower dominance and is an object of.some
 fascination to all, but she does not otherwise occupy
 a significant place in the domestic affairs or the
 foreign policy of any Europe.an country.   Politically,
 there is no yellow fever threat in Europe.
