 Colby Era Ends for Greatest Intelligence Organization
 An era comes to an end with the de-
 parture  of  William  Egan  Colby  (Bur-
 lington  H.S. '36;  Princeton,  BA, '40;
 Columbia, LLB, '47) from the greatest in-
 telligence organization in the world.
 Mr. Colby, as is his wont, had nothing
 to say in the Daily either on the subject of
 his career or his departure. His aides,
 close mouthed as usual, said naught.
 The White House also declined to say
 anything, merely insisting again that if it
 was anyone's day, it was President Ford's.
 Dr. Kissinger and Dr. Schlesinger, two
 old  cronies,  had kind words for their
 departing colleague. The former remark-
 ed, that "Colby is a good man, but now
 that he is gone I hope we can expand the
 Daily to eight pages."
 Dr.  Schlesinger  remarked  that  now
 with Colby gone he will be putting in his
 subscription  request  for the  Daily via
 freedom of information channels.
 Published by Named Principals Only for the Director of Central Intelligence
 One old-timer, who was once a power at
 Langley, expanded a bit on the "eventful
 years" under Colby. "However you may
 have regarded  his  predecessors,"  he
 grimaced, "you have to admit that it was
 under Colby that the CIA became a houses
 hold  word."  He preferred  not  to say
 what that word was.
 A young Agency analyst said that with
 the departure he hoped he would be able
 to pick up Colby's fine parking space near
 the water tower in the West lot.
 Congressperson Abzug told reporters
 yesterday that she was sorry to see Colby
 leave. She noted that the organization
 over which he presided had taken an in-
 terest in her years before anyone else.
 "Any Agency that could recognize me as
 a  comer  cannot  be  all  bad,"  the
 Congressperson said. She went on to la-
 ment the fact that she and Colby had
 begun to work together only recently. "If

 telligence chief to prepare a psychiatric
 assessment of the Agency's old and new
 directors.  Qadhafi said he finds the
 behavior of American leaders baffling,
 noting that their actions are often erratic,
 mercurial,  reckless, and even at times
 fanatic. The chief has suggested that they
 can be understood if one recognizes they
 are in the "mid-life crisis."
 Colby's counterparts abroad were, to a
 man, bemused by Colby's unique three-
 month tenure as the lame duck director of
 a major competitor. They were sure that
 this unprecedented experiment had im-
 plications for them all, but none was sure
 what  the  implications  were.  Several
 agreed  to  talk  on  the  record  to  the
 Daily's inquiring reporter.
 M of MI-6:  "You American chaps
 never learn. We always thought with our
 brains and your money, Britain would
 rule the roost. We devoted a lot of time
 and a lot of talent to trying to bring
 you up to standard, but you simply do not
 appreciate that the old ways are the best."

 lieve that Colby is really leaving the old
 firm? Pardon, but not on your life. It is all

 Director Fulfills Dream Concept
 Conceived b y Former  hiet, FE
 President Ford's announcement that
 CIA Director William E. Colby will soon
 be leaving the Agency to return to private
 law practice has touched off an investiga-
 tion by the nation's press.
 Our sources have learned that within
 the next few days the press will print
 charges  that  Colby's  departure  is  a
 massive plot arranged by the Agency as a
 smoke screen for Colby's new assignment
 as a deep cover agent.
 The press apparently tumbled to the
 plan, which is described as "vast and
 massive," when reporters from the Uaily
 Princetonian  checked  into construction
 Gonomor Deplorer
 Seeks von Pluckett
 The highly-touted research blimp, the
 Gonomor Deplorer, is in fact the key-
 stone  of  a  CIA effort  to  locate  and
 recover a German zeppelin, the K. von
 Pluckett, which has been missing since
 1904.
 The  Deplorer  was  developed  by  the
 Maxima Corporation, a Division of Huge
 Airbag Co. The Deplorer's announced
 mission was to recover industrial waste
 particles from the air for recycling into
 solid trash.
 Congressional  sources have revealed
 that  the  CIA  covertly  paid  for  and
 developed the $100 Deplorer to aid in an
 intensive search for the Pluckett, which

 olutionary new hot airbag features.

 progress on Colby's new law offices in
 suburban New Jersey.
 The press suspects that the facility goes
 somewhat beyond the needs of a lawyer
 hanging out his shingle.
 Colby, in an unusual move, has refused
 to return the calls of reporters on the
 matter.  An official Agency spokesman
 says  the  allegations  are  "pure  poppy-
 cock"  and  "obviously  the  ravings  of
 paranoids."
 The spokesman said-not for attribu-
 tion and on deep background-that as far
 as he knew, Colby's only assured client to
 date  is  one  S.  Hersh,  who. was  ap-
 prehended by police while surveiling a
 well-known intelligence analyst, O. Pike.
 The charges concerning Colby's depar-
 ture  are expected to launch  535
 Congressional investigations.

 it had been sooner, the Agency would not
 be in the mess it is."
 A.  Warhol revealed to a friend the
 other day that the Agency had asked him
 to come down and paint a portrait in the
 modern style of some guy named Colby.
 Warhol said he had his doubts, especially
 when  they  wouldn't  let  him  in  the
 building.
 Similarly Laudatory
 The reaction from abroad was generally
 laudatory, whether of Colby or of his
 departure.  L'Observatore  Romano
 quoted Vatican sources as saying the Pope
 is always happy to see one of his sheep
 come in from out of the cold.
 Indira Gandhi told the Indian Parlia-
 ment that it was "no coincidence" that
 Colby was being replaced by a man who
 had spent the past two years in Peking.
 "What further proof do you need," she
 asked, "that China is behind the sinister
 design of external forces to destabilize
 India?"
 She promised to use all her powers, es-
 pecially her emergency powers, to protect
 her democratic principles of one-person
 rule.
 One day in  1965 the Chief, Far East
 Division in the Plans Directorate, wrote a
 memo  to  the  Director  of  Current
 Intelligence, noting that President John-
 son was a great newspaper reader and that
 OCI  might  consider  issuing  its  daily
 product as an "intelligence new~aper."

 Furor over Colby Splits Chinese
 In China, controversy over the Colby
 departure has split the leadership and
 threatens to engulf the country in yet
 another ideological struggle. One power-
 ful faction accuses unnamed party and
 government  functionaries  of  having
 "lost"  Angola through their failure to
 "ride the great green wave" of the effort
 to save Angola from Soviet hegemony.
 The Colby controversy has rekindled
 enmities from the anti-Confucius cam-
 paign of 1974 and the cultural revolution
 of 1966-69, with Teng Hsiao-ping and
 the principal antagonists.
 There are those who equate Colby's ex-
 perience on the Hill over the last year with
 Teng's ordeal during the cultural revolu-
 tion. These theorists see the release of the
 Soviet helicopter pilots as a sign that
 Colby's fortunes will improve. These who
 hold to this view point out that the only
 other purpose accomplished in the release
 was to befuddle Western analysts.
 Curiously, the official who repurtedly
 is the most astute student of Colby's
 methods seems to be staying out of the
 Mao's wife, Chian  Chin emer ing as                 (See Furor...Page 2

 controversy.     This   official   is   Wei
 Yam-Kobe,  who  heads  China's  in-
 telligence organs.  It is said that he walks
 faster than anyone else in Peking, and
 that he spends the early part of the even-
 ing staring at a map and suggesting topics
 for his analysts.
 Much  of  Wei's
 tributed to his cost-cutting. For example,
 he  has  saved  millions  of  dollars that
 otherwise might have been squandered on
 intelligence-gathering efforts against the
 US.  He has settled for subscriptions to
 two  newspapers,  -the  Congressional
 Record, and Aviation Week.
 Wei reportedly has told his associates:
 "The only difference betwee~t the way I do
 it and the way Colby did it is that Colby
 would have created his own newspaper."
 Late Item
 A reliable but untested source reports
 that negotiations are under way to acquire
 the services of a retired annuitant to write
 a  continuing  history  oil  American
 Intelligence  for  Intelligent  Americans.
 The only obstacle to the signing of a con-
 tract is annuitant Colby's insistence on an
 exception to the 90-percent limit on com-
 pensation.
 Sen. Abourezk and Rep. Harrington make another attempt to
 convince Director that the CIA should intervene in Gabon
 record.
 Dr. Proctor said that the analysis of the
 May Day photography was now in. He
 said  that  there  was  a  clear  shot  of
 Brezhnev without his hat. Analysts believe
 he is balding, and an alert memorandum
 will be out shortly.
 Mr. Duckett said his people had infor-
 mation that Octagon photos of Loch Ness
 showed suspicious sheds along one of the
 northern reaches of the Loch. His office
 wonders  whether  the  Scottish  tourist
 board  is  surreptitiously  building  a
 Mark-II monster.
 Mr. Blake said he was pleased to report
 that most elevators worked yesterday dur-
 ing lunch hour.
 Gen.  Wilson reported that he would
 simply like to flag to the Director's atten-
 tion that the latest Task Group had found
 41 critical issues about which very little
 could be done, and papers were being
 prepared on them.
 Mr. Carver murmured that he had been
 to see  Jim  but it wasn't very fruitful
 because he is no longer in office.
 The Inspector General announced he
 had doubled the size of his staff again
 yesterday.
 The  General  Counsel,  Mr.  Warner,
 said that it had been a rather dull day but
 he did want to mention in passing that the
 Director had been sued for $19 billion.
 Mr. Cary reported that members of six
 committees wanted to visit Australia. He
 asked also if anyone could identify for
 him a certain Representative Nedzi, who
 had placed a call to him.
 The Deputy Director said that he was
 glad to be back in the US again. He asked
 that  the  minutes  not  reflect  several
 messages from a King, two Prime Min-
 isters, and awell-informed Lisbon taxi
 driver with whom he had recently met. He
 said that he had an interesting story about
 a cannibal girl and an American with a
 machine gun  which  he would tell  the
 members privately later. He got off a
 remark in French followed by one in a
 language which appeared to be Russian
 because Gen. Wilson giggled when the re-
 mark was made.
 The meeting closed with the suggestion
 that tomorrow's 9  a.rn.  meeting might
 take place at 9 a.m. or at 5:30 p. m. or it
 was  possible that  the 9  a.m.  meeting
 would take place both at 9 a.m. and at
 5:30 p.m.

 DIR Colby is also head of the Central
 Intelligence Agency (CIA),  one  of the
 groups on USIB. CIA produces reports
 and  assessments  about  world
 developments.  It is  said to dabble in
 military intelligence, but it is well known
 that  this  is  the  responsibility  of  the
 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and
 the  National  Command  Authority
 (NCA).
 From  time
 to time,  DIR/CI  Colby
 volunteers suggestions on the intelligence
 community  budget.  These  are  always
 given  appropriate  attention  by  the
 National Command Authority (NCA), as
 well as by another agency known as the
 Department of Defense (DoD).
 Perhaps  DIR/CI  Colby's  strongest
 point was his strong support of the con-
 cept of National Intelligence (NI). His
 devotion to that concept was exceeded
 only by that of the National Command
 Authority  (NCA)  and  the  Defense
 Intelligence     Agency     (DIA).
