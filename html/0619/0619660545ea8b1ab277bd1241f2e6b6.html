 TREATMENT OF RELIGIOUS REFORM MOVEMENT
 BY CHIREBE COMF4lJRIST PRESS DURIRG 1951
 For this survey of the religious reform movement, as presented in the
 .Chinese Communist press, three Chinese Communist newspapers -- the Peiping
 4e-min Jih_)ao, the Shanghai Chieh-f
 -- were selected for                   ih-thy and the Canton Nan-fang Jih-
 Coesnuniat Party organs of nenorth, central, andtsouthChina,prespectively.  All
 available issues, numbering 988, of these newspapers from January to December
 1951 were examined.  The Peiping and Shanghai newspapers closely paralleled
 each other in subject matter, quantity, and time of appearance,  The Canton
 press coverage was approximately half that of the other two papers.
 The surve?? -evealed'that the Chinese Communists did not attack religion
 per Be, but co...entrated on the elimination of so-called imperialistic influ-
 ence in churches and other such institutions by means of take-over, disbandment
 of reactionary organizations, and deportation of nonconforming religious per-
 sonnel.  This was done in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea Move-
 ment; the Patriotic Movement, the Regulations Governing Registration of Cul-
 tural, Educational, Belief, and Religious Institutions Receiving Foreign Sub-
 lies or Which Are For21gn Controlled Financially;   tb-Thrte-Se1P'Reform
 Movement ,(self'-rule,'aelf-support; And-self-preaching);.and-the-Law on Punish-
 ment of-Counterrevolutionaries.
 Much of this religious reform movement was directed against the Catholic
 Church.  The statistical table below shows that a total of 417 items were con-
 cerned with the Catholic Church, 68 were concerned with the Protestant, `and 11
 were concerned with the Buddhist and Moslem churches.  Of the 417 items on the
 Catholic Church, 128 items were about the religious reform movement, 38 were
 concerned with the patriotic movement, 51 attacked Catholic-operated orphanages
 and nurseries, 107 were directed against Catholic dignitaries such as Antonio
 Riberi and'Jean de Vienne, and 87 attacked Catholic organizations, such as the
 Legion of Mary.

 The press articles were of three tyne@ and lave been divided into the fol-
 lowing categories:
 A.  Items reporting official action taken with regard to religious organi-
 zations and personnel.
 B.  Items reporting spontaneous moves by -el'gious organizations and person-
 nel to advance the self-reform movement and eliminate imperialistic influence In
 churches.
 C.  Reports and editorials other than Categories A and B.
 The greater part of the material, by far, fell into Category B.  Limited
 samples of this type of item are presented in Section IV.
 With regard to Cat, gory A, the majority evidence is that official activity
 against religion is being taken by the various military control commissions.
 Summaries of all items of this category appear in Section III.
 There were relatively few items of the type falling into Category C.  Three
 articles of this type appear as Section V.
 Section I is a table showing the number of items dealing with religion that
 appeared in the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao, t?.e Shanghai Chieh-fang Jih-pao, and the
 Canton Nan-fang Jih-pao during 1951.
 Section II gives the titles of items on the Legion of Mary that appeared in
 the Shanghai Chieh=fang Jih-pao July - October 1951.  This shows the type of propa-
 ganda build-up-leading to a desired objective -- in this case, the disbandment of
 the organization.

 IV.  ITEMS REPORTING SPONTANEOUS MOVES BY RELIGIOUS
 ORGANIZATIQNS AND PERSONNEL TO ADVANCE THE SELF-REFORM MOVEMENT
 AND ELIMINATE IMPERIALISTIC INFLUENCE IN CHURCHES
 CATHOLIC MANIFESTO URGES INDEPENDENCE -- Peiping, Jen-min Jih-pao, 8 Jan 51
 A manifesto issued by a group of over 500 Catholics assembled on 30 Nov-
 ember 1950 by Father Wang Liang-teo, a Catholic living in Kuang-yuan Hsien,
 North Szechwan, advocated severance of relations with the imperialists and
 institution of new churches based on independent administration, maintenance,
 and preaching.  Catholics in Suiyuan, Chungking, Nan-ch'ang, Wuhan, Chia-chiang
 in West Szechwan, Yueh-ch'ih in North Szechwan, and'other areas responded to
 this call.  For example, early in January 1951, Shih Ming-liang, suffragan
 bishop of the Chungking diocese, and 695 parishioners, issued an "independent
 sad new church movement" statement.       -
 As evidence thrt this reform movement is winning widespread popular sup-
 port, large bodies of Chinese Catholics have signed "new church movement" reso-
 lutions.  All patriotic Catholics, moreover, who cut their interrational reli-
 gious attachments, are guaranteed freedom of religious worship and activity.
 However, to enjoy this freedom, it was made clear that Chinese Catholics must
 disengage themselves from "conspiratorial activities di-  'ted by higher organs
 of the Catholic  .lurch in Rome and the US."
 DISCUSS CATHOLIC REFORM MOVEMENT -- Peiping, Jen-min Jih-pao, 21 Jan 51
 Ma Hsu-lun, vice-chairman of the Committee of Culture and Education, an-
 nounced the establishment of a Religious Affairs Office on 17 January 1951.
 The announcement was made at the conclusion of a reception tea attended by
 40 leading Catholic clergymen and laymen of North China at the invitation of
 the Committee of Culture and Education.
 The Catholic leaders were convened to exchange views on the Catholic Re-
 form Movement.  Catholics attending included:  Li Chun-wu, suffragan bishop;
 Wang Ju-chi, chief secretary of the cardinal's public affairs office, Ch'i
 Yueh-tien, vice-chairman of the cardinal's public affairs office, Chang Pi-te,
 bishop of Chiu Hsien diocese, Lei Chen-hsia, bishop of Fen-yang Hsien dio-
 cese, and Wu K'o-chai and Nieh Kuo-ping, members of the preparatory committee
 of the Tientsin Catholic Refjrm Movement Council, priests from Peiping Catholic
 rburches, and principals from various Catholic schools.
 Following a welcoming speech by Vice-Chairman Ma Hsu-11n, Vice-Chairman
 Lu Ting-1 delivered an address.  Lu told the group that since July 1950 when
 Protestant personalities initiated the self-rule, self-support, and self-
 preaching patriotic reform movement, more than 90,000 Protestants had signed
 the reform movement proclamation.  The 14th Annual Conference of the National
 Council of the Church of Christ in China, meeting in Shanghai on October 1950,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/10/06: CIA-RDP80-00809A000700060173-2
 passed a resolution to support the Protestant reform proclamation and to rally
 all Protestants to achieve the objectives of self-rule, self-support, and self-
 preaching.
 As fur the Catholics, Lu said that Wang Liang-tso of North Szechwan, head
 of the Catholics, had issued a proclamation for an independent reform movement
 in November 1950.  Subsequently, Catholics in the Yangtze area and in North
 China had issued bimilar proclamations.  Pointing out that for the last 100
 years imperialists have been using the Catholic church as a tool for. their ag-
 gression, Lu called for a severance of relations between the Catholic church,
 and the imperialists and for the establishment of the Catholic church a4'n
 independent Chinese enterprise.
 Chairman Chou En-lai, speaking extemporaneously, said that the government
 supports and endorses the Three-Self Movement, a patriotic movement, among re-
 ligious circles.  He pointed out that people of all faiths, including Catholics,
 should be patriotic, saying that patriotism anc: the love of one's country are not
 contrary to the principle of "Under heaven all members of one faith belong to
 one fa-ily.". He emphasized that members of the faith cannot include rotten ele-
 ments and that Judas-like imperialist elements and tools, such as Yu Pin, cannot
 be considered as members of the faith.  Finally, Chou said, Catholics and Prot-
 estants cannot become strong by depending on others and not relying on their
 own efforts for self-transformation; those who are independent have a future.
 k'a  Speaking for the Catholic group were Chang Pi-te; Le Chun-vu; T'.ien Chih-
 ng, lecturer of Fu-jen University; and Chang Huai, professor at Fu-jen Uni-
 versity.  Li Chun-wu said that after a year's experience the government has
 proved its policy of religious freedom and "we must support and follow all the
 policies of the government."  Chang Huai said, "We must firmly oppose imperial-
 ism and not allow religion to become a tool of the imperialists.  We must carry
 out the movement fur self-rule, self-support, and self-preaching. Catholics in
 Peiping cannot fell behind others in this movement."
 PEIPING CATHOLIC LEADERS HOLD CONFERENCE -- Peiping, Jen-min Jih-pao, 27 Mar 51
 The preparatory committee of the Peiping Catholic Defend World Peace and
 Oppose American Aggression Committee held a conference, on 25 March 1951, which
 was attended by 160 principals and teachers from 21 primary and middle schools
 and universities.
 Among those attending the confereuce were Chang Han-min, Chu Fu-hhiang,
 and Chen Jo-yu.
 The conferees unanimously advocated:  aid to the people's government in its
 determination to purge secret counterrevolutionaries in the Catholic Church,
 severanc, of all relations with imperialists, and the exposure of the US-Chiang
 bandits' poisonous distortion of the Catholic Independent Reform Movement.
 Liu Fu-tong, chairman of the preparatory committee, stated that patriotic
 Catholics must voluntarily search out secret counterrevolutionary elements in
 the church.   If this is not done," he said, "we do not love our religion."  He
 said that the failure to do so would be injurious to the church.  Liu referrer
 to recent press reports of special agents concealing themselves in the Catholic
 Church for the purpose of carrying on activities destructive to the people's
 government. This is P disgrace to the church.  Catholics must search out the
 counterrevolutionary elements before the faith can be strengthened and the past
 disgrace washed away.

 NANKING DIOCESE ISSUES SUPPORT I ATEMENT -- Shanghai, Chieh-fang Jih-pao,
 25 May 51
 On 31 March 1951, Catholics of the Nanking diocese issued the following
 statement:
 Fellow Chinese and Catholic brethren:  The imperialists, in their inner
 nature usurpers, have, since the Opium War,'stretched a demonic paw into China
 And, with every manner of unequal treaty, encroached upon our sovereign ter-
 ritory.  They have placed our people in bondage; and have gone on to utilize
 Catholicism in their aggressive march.  Since there are, in the church, men of
 Yu Pin's cast who are willing to be used by the imperialists, the spiritual
 chastity of our congregation has been defiled.  That our patriotic coreligion-
 ists should so disg.?ace and pollute us with this imperialist liaison, is a
 fearful calamity.
 After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, it appeared we
 would not    upprnssed in the old manner, for the Chinese people of today have
 arisen.  But the US imperialists, despising the Chinese people, increased their
 aggressive activities.  They supports;: the undertakings of cdnspirators and sa-
 boteurs on the mainland, committed military aggression against Taiwan -_ our
 sovereign territory -- and against our Korean neighbor, and, in a final breach
 of international trust, carried througn a unilateral treaty with Japan and re-
 armed that country.  These facts amply expose their evil conspiracy.  In their
 minds, they intend not only to subjugate China, but also tb- entire world.

 In the name of the UN, they slander the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
 and our People's Republic of China.  This tactic of making right out of wrong
 is deceiving and cheating the people of the world.
 We Catholics of Nanking and other cities know that our coreligionists and
 all the people of China belong to one great whole.  All that is required is the
 complete destruction of. the imperialist plot befo                          re-

 willthis
 comply with governmental d,rees, support the same basic principles, work harder,
 produce more, and decisively expurgate from our church all traces and influence
 as imperialism.  To reach the goals outlined above, we must effectuate, in a RQsitive manner, the Three-Self principles -- self-rule, self-support, and self-
 preaching -_ and, with the exception of religious me- ers and articles of faith,
 we will.oppose church interference in the government of China and will separate'
 Ourselves from political and economic entanglements.  We will be sustained,
 ruled, and taught b?, our. own countrymen and will tolerate no foreign aid or
 domination.  Under  se direction and guidance of Mao Tse-tung and all strata of
 leadership in the people's government, we will strive to create a peaceful,
 democratic, and independent new China'
 The- Catholics of China have the same orientation as the Chinese masses;
 t4ey have a fervent patriotic duty to love mankind and peace, and they now
 dust choose whether or not to display their patriotism for the benefit of the
 Fatherland and the people.
 We must now respond as one man to the call to Resist America, Aid Korea;
 Defend Rome, Protect Fatherland; and oppose US rearming of Japan; strive for
 lasting world peace, and build a new China.
