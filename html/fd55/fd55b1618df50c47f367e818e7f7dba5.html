 MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
 SUBJECT:     DCI Briefing of CIA Subcommittee of House Appropriations,
 2 June 1966
 1.  The Director, accompanied by Colonel White, Dr. Wheelon,
 Mr. John Clarke, and Mr. Houston briefed the CIA Subcommittee of
 House Appropriations on 2 June 1966 at 10:30 a. m.  Present for the
 Subcommittee were:
 George H. Mahon, Chairman
 Frank T. Bow
 Glenard P. Lipscomb
 Robert L. Michaels, Staff Assistant
 25X1
 2.   The Chairman opened with questions on the research and
 development budget submission and asked how the submission tied
 in with                         Dr. Wheelon briefed on the R&D program
 and the NRO problem, saying that our share would be unknown until
 it was finally set by the Director, NRO.  Dr. Wheelon then gave
 details on some of the specific R&D projects involved.  The Subcom-
 mittee expressed special interest in               The Director stated      25X1
 it might be the biggest intelligence breakthrough since the overhead
 camera.  Mr. Mahon asked if the Russians knew what we are doing,
 and the Director said they will know it is there but probably will not
 know what it is for.  Mr. Mahon inquired how CIA could have people
 who are qualified in these highly sophisticated fields, and Dr. Wheelon
 pointed out his own training and background and the type of people he
 recruited.  Mr. Mahon asked if industry participated, and the Director
 said they did a good deal of it and in this connection we were program
 managers.   He pointed out that both Mr. Flax and Mr. Foster were
 complimentary on the competence of our people.
 3.  Mr. Mahon asked about the cutback on Cuban operations.

 Mr. Mahon sai   e
 assumed Castro has to raise a fuss as he recently did to persuade the
 Russians to help him.  The Director said this was part of the act,
 but also it was an exercise in mobilization and a move to detect
 counterrevolutionaries.  Mr. Mahon asked if the President and the
 Secretary of State were satisfied on intelligence in Cuba, and the
 Director answered in the affirmative.  Mr. Mahon asked how much
 Russian aid is given to Cuba, and the answer was they had been
 given about $350, 000, 000 to $400, 000, 000 a year, which is a fairly
 steady total for the last two or three years although the emphasis now
 is less on military and more on trade items.
 4.  Mr. Bow asked further about the Cuban situation, and the
 Director said the internal situation was not good, particularly its
 economy.
 ipscom  asked about the Cuban military,
 an  the   .rector said they were at considerable strength and loyal.
 He said Castro had drawn back on his earlier efforts to subvert other
 Latin American countries from his attempts on some 22 countries a
 year ago to concentrate on three countries now.  He also noted that
 he was attacking President Frei of Chile.  Mr. Bow said he did not
 think much of Frei, but the Director said comparatively he stood up
 pretty well.  Mr. Lipscomb asked if we had good information on the
 Cuban military, and the Director said we did,
 and noted that 85 per cent of the armed forces
 now belong to the Communist Party.
 5.  Mr. Mahon asked about personnel, noting a proposed
 increase from                     nd asked for the cause.  Colonel
 White noted that     had been included in the supplemental request
 for Southeast Asia and briefed further on the other increases,
 including NPIC.  Dr. Wheelon briefed on budget items connected
 with          operations involving Russian missile ranges.  The

 7.  Mr. Lipscomb asked why FBIS was not run by State or
 the Voice of America, and the Director said its purpose was to
 collect intelligence and this was our responsibility.   Colonel White
 gave the history of FBIS, and Dr. Wheelon noted this was one among
 other services of common concern in accordance with the statutory
 concept.  Colonel White noted how FBIS had reacted in connection
 with the Dominican crisis.  Mr. Lipscombasked how many copies
 were issued, and Colonel White offered to supply the breakdown to
 Mr. Lipscomb.  (Colonel White furnished this information, and
 Mr. Warner will arrange for its delivery to Mr. Lipscomb. )
 Mr. Lipscomb asked if the reports were actually used, and Colonel
 White said we put out periodic questionnaires and if any customer
 did not respond he was automatically cut off.  In all cases they had
 requested to be put on distribution again.  Mr. Lipscomb asked how
 many people were involved, and Colonel White said     people in 1967
 with a budget of                The Director emphasized it was a very
 'important function, and  r. Wheelon ma de the point that if the function
 were carried on by a policymaking organization the reports would tend
 to follow policy.  The Director concurred, saying the objectivity of
 CIA must be retained and that he had had considerable experience in
 the past of the effect of policy on intelligence and this was why
 Mr. McNamara came to CIA rather than DIA for his information.
 Mr. Lipscomb asked if the newspapers know that FBIS is CIA, and
 on being answered in the affirmative asked what would happen if
 someone wanted to know the cost of the operation.  Colonel White
 said we simply would not tell them.
 8.  The Director briefed on the assessment of the troubles
 in Red China, particularly the struggle for power and the fact that
 this had practically eliminated the propaganda against the United
 States  and South Vietnam.  Mr. Mahon noted that he had met with
 Chou En-lai and Mao Tse-tung with Ambassador Hurley in 1945 and

 was impressed with Chou as a smooth and smart official.  The
 Director noted the heir apparent is very militant and answered
 affirmatively to Mr. Bow's question as to whether he might be the
 type that would use the A-Bomb.
 9.  Mr. Mahon asked if there was a possibility that the
 South Vietnamese would sue for peace.  The Director said our
 judgment was that there would be a minimum of three years and
 more likely five years before we could start moving our troops
 out of South Vietnam.  He felt that the large pattern of bigger
 attacks would drop off and they would go back to straight guerrilla
 operations but would need U. S. military strength and the political
 action teams until the basic structure was strengthened.  He noted
 that Red China could take stronger action much as the -1 -;-44-4__

 assistance.  He said Sihanouk in Cambodia goes with the wind and
 that we had a report that he was possibly on his way out, but with
 the long, slow process similar to Sukarno's elimination this might
 take five years.
 10. Mr. Bow asked about General Larsen's report on
 the Vietcong and North Vietnamese in Cambodia, and the Director
 said we agree to the extent that they use Cambodia but do not say
 that they are based in Cambodia.  He said we should hit the situation
 in           early and noted that U. S. military aid is not going there
 as fast as our Ambassador would like.  Mr. Mahon noted that
 Indonesia seemed to be the only bright spot, and the Director noted
 that in the Indonesian-Malaysian situation there was still some hard
 bargaining and the status of Singapore would be a sore point between
 them.  He noted the Indonesian economy was bad and answered
 affirmatively Mr. Mahon's question about the killing of some 300, 000
 Communists in Indonesia.
 11.  Mr. Mahon noted that Chinese intelligence must think
 the United States is absorbed in a power struggle with the opposition
 of Fulbright and Morse, the domination of racial problems in the
 news, and similar problems carried by the United States press.
 The Director said he felt Chinese intelligence was good.  He noted
 the Chinese have started up their heavy bomber program, presumably
 to achieve a delivery system for the A-Bomb.
 12.  Mr. Lipscomb expressed considerable concern at the
 way the Executive Branch was handling publicity on various items,
 such as the question of the shootdown of the plane over China and

 CR
 the question of General Larsen's claim of troops in Cambodia,
 and pointed out that first we deny then we admit or equivocate and
 he wondered if this would not hurt our credibility abroad.  The
 Director said it did and that the problem is that the people who
 make such statements should coordinate more carefully before
 they talk.  For instance, in the case of General Larsen's statements,
 DIA does not believe there is sufficient information to back them
 up while CIA believes there is.
 13. Mr. Mahon said he felt sorry to have expressed so much
 pessimism but he felt we would be in a state of war in one degree or
 another for the rest of the century.  The Director said his view was
 that if we were to try to negotiate with the Communists we must at
 the same time intensify our military effort as this is the only type
 of negotiation they understand.

 discussing manpower with 14x. Mahon,
 as noted in paragraph 5, I was on the

 I.   The cautious compromise worked out between govern-
 ment and Buddhist leaders should quiet the crisis
 atmosphere in Saigon for at least the next few days.
 A.   Buddhist leaders in Saigon have generally
 restrained excessive reactions by their fol-
 lowers to the attack on militant bonze Thien
 Minh on 1 June.
 B.   They have also cautioned their followers to
 avoid excessive agitation against the regime
 until it is clear how the agreement on expan-
 sion of the "war cabinet" leadership bodies will
 be carried out.
 II.    The Buddhists apparently agreed to dampen their
 agitation in return for implementation of recently
 announced government plans to expand the present
 National Leadership Committee  (NLC).
 A.   Ten civilian representatives--presumably in-
 cluding spokesmen for the Buddhists--are to be
 added before 6 June.

 B.    The chairman of the NLC,  General Thieu, will
 apparently resign as agreed by the members at
 yesterday's meeting.
 C.    The enlarged NLC will "make an effort" to set
 up a "civilian and armed forces council" prior
 to 19 June to "assist" the Central Executive
 Committee,  chaired by Ky.
 1.   It is not clear whether references by gov-
 ernment leaders to the "National Leadership
 Committee" are synonymous with Buddhist
 references to the "Directorate."
 III.   It appears that the accord to enlarge the NLC was
 agreed upon without too much reaction from the Direc-
 tOrate generals.
 A.    It is possible that they feel their positions
 as daily executors of Directorate policy will not
 be significantly threatened.
 IV.   Some agitation may occur during the celebration of
 Buddha's birthday on 3 June.
 A.    There are indications that some Buddhist groups
 hope to conduct the observances with dignity and
 without political overtones.
 B.    There is other cvidence that efforts are being
 made,  possibly with some Buddhist connivance,  to
 organize strikes and demonstrations on 3 June.

 V.    In Hue, meanwhile, progovernment troop units
 moved in today without any resistance.
 A.      Government sources said the radio station
 and key points of the city have been secured
 without a shot being fired so far.
 B.      It is not clear,  however, whether the troops
 will obey orders to prevent further violence
 by the dissident forces or participate in any
 effort to disarm or overpower the rebels.
 1.   Some "struggle" troops obtained supplies
 of heavy caliber automatic weapons during
 the violence in the city on 1 June.
 VI.    Only light contact with the Viet Cong has been
 reported during thepast several days.
 A.   Border surveillance patrols are continuing in
 allied Operation PAUL REVERE,  a major sweep
 operation in western Pleiku Province.
 B.   All other operations involving US personnel
 continue without significant contact with the
 enemy,
 VII.    There are continuing indications that the Com-
 munists are moving substantial numbers-of reinforce-
 ments into northwestern Pleiku Province.

 in Paragraph V below
 I.      Only fragmentary returns from yesterday's elec-
 tion are available.   Vote totals have been
 coming in slowly and it may not be possible to
 discern any clear trend until late today.
 A.      With an estimated 50 percent of the expected
 Santo Domingo vote of 240,000 reported:
 1.   Dominican Revolutionary Party candidate
 Juan Bosch appears to be leading with
 about 59,4 percent of the vote.
 2.   Reformist Party candidate Balaguer has
 38.8 percent of the vote,
 3.   Bonnelly trails with only 2.2 percent.
 B.    In 1962, Bosch captured 78 percent of the
 capital's vote,  and without a similar margin
 will have difficulty overcoming the lead
 Balaguer is likely to develop elsewhere.
 Scattered returns from the interior show
 Balaguer doing extremely well.
 II.   No significant instances of fraud or violence
 marred the election, which foreign observers
 lauded as "exemplary."

 B.     None of the political factions has levied
 charges of voting irregularities--which may
 help pave the way to popular acceptance of
 the outcome.
 III.    Favorable weather aided in promoting a good-
 sized turnout--estimated at 1.2 million, or 65
 to 70 percent of the eligible voters.
 IV.    The turnout and the relatively large number of
 women who cast ballots are thought to favor
 Balaguer's chances.
 V.    As of 0900 AM EDT unofficial returns show
 Balaguer with 168,366 votes while Bosch is
 trailing with 122,078..   The two Santo Domingo
 morning papers indicate that a Balaguer sweep
 may be in the making.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 (Information as of 4:30 AM EDT)
 1.    Only fragmentary returns from yesterday's elec-
 tion are available.   Vote torals have been
 coming in slowly and it may not be possible to
 discern any clear trend until late today.
 A.   With an estimated 20 percent of the expected
 Santo Domingo vote of 240,000 reported:
 1.   Dominican Revolutionary Party candidate
 Juan Bosch appears to be leading with
 about 60 percent of the vote.
 2.   Reformist Party candidate Balaguer has
 37 percent of the vote.
 3.   Bonnelly trails with only 2.1 percent.
 B.   In 1962,  Bosch captured 78 percent of the
 capital's vote,  and without a similar margin
 may have difficulty overcoming the lead
 Balaguer is likely to develop elsewhere.
 II.    No significant instances of fraud or violence
 marred the election, which foreign observers
 lauded as "exemplary."
