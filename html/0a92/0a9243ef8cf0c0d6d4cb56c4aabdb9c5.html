 VIETNAMESE COM41jNIST BLOODBATH: MYTH OR R~.AJXFY"?
 From time to time controversy arises as to whether the Viet-
 namese Communists would perpetrate a bloodbath if they succeeded
 in gaining control of South Vietnam.  The controversy has arisen
 again in the pages of the press because of an essay by one D.
 Gareth Porter, a young graduate student at Cornell University in
 Ithaca, New York,   on for his anti-Vietnam war views.  The essay
 once again tries to dispute the well established fact that the
 North Vietnamese leadership in the mid-fifties conducted a blood-
 bath in liquidating great numbers of opponents of their regime
 during a "land reform" at the time.  There have been other "Porters"
 in the past who have similarly tried to discount or minimize the
 fact of past communist bloodbaths and the possibility of future
 bloodbaths.
 The chief argument of "revisionist" historians like Porter
 rests on the idea that the exact number of persons liquidated is
 in doubt and cannot be proved.  By this logic., Stalin's wholesale
 liquidation of real and imagined oppositionists during his land
 reform in the early thirties can also be called (and indeed for
 years was called) a myth by the Porters of the time since the
 exact number of his victims was in doubt and. could not be verified.
 In a way, it comes down to a "numbers game":  how many hundreds
 or thousands have to be arbitrarily murdered before one speaks
 of a bloodbath?
 Other arguments of the revisionist historians are equally
 specious.  They cite mistranslation and misinterpretations of
 North Vietnamese official pronouncements concerning such matters,
 but it is hard to see how their "corrected" translations are a
 warrant for believing the massacres did not take place.  Also,
 while discounting voluminous non-Communist testimony and research
 as anti-Communist "propaganda," they, at the same time, typically
 take North Vietnamese accounts, for example of the land reform,
 at face value,  They ignore the undisputed fact, acknowledged
 even by the Communist regimes, that their mass media are used
 primarily to influence opinion i.e. to propagandize, and only
 secondarily to impart factual information.  Distortion of facts
 and. out-and-out lies by Communist mass media as well as in official
 pronouncements of various kinds are familiar phenomena.  While
 it is quite legitimate to re-examine the historical record, it is a
 patently unsound research practice (to put the most charitable
 view on it) to accept only the Coimnunist version as being correct
 and. either to ignore contrary views resulting from serious
 research, or denigrate them as mere "anti-Communist propaganda."

 The revisionist historians' arguments are examined closely
 and at length, and effectively refuted in a New York Times Magazine
 article of 15 October 1972 by John S. Carroll, a U. . correspon ent
 for many years in Vietnam and now Washington correspondent of the
 Baltimore Sun.  Revisionist views are also challenged by a number
 of other persons eminently qualified to address the problem by
 virtue of their first-hand experience in Vietnam and talks with
 numbers of North Vietnamese who fled South from the land reform
 terror.  Their views, expressed in letters to the editor of the
 Washington Post, as well as-Carroll's investigation, are attached
 hereto.  See especially also Washington Star columnist Crosby
 Noyes' succinct and persuasive statement.
 Reproduced as an attachment also are two sections of a book-
 let, The Vietcong Strategy of:Terror by Douglas Pike, one of the
 ranking experts: on North Vietnam and    Vietcong.  In these
 sections he recounts carefully the 1968 mass murders by the Com-
 munists in Hue, and painstakingly catalogues cases of atrocities
 by Vietnamese Communists between 1960 and 1970.  This record of
 Communist terrorism is supplemented by the attached newspaper
 accounts of Communist atrocities since the beginning of the invasion
 launched last March.  Taken together, these public accounts
 provide a reliable and fairly comprehensive record of Communist
 terror from which each !reader can decide for himself what would
 most likely happen in the event of a Comunist takeover of South
 Vietnam.

 AFTER WE GET OUT, WILL THERE BE A BLOODBATH IN. SOUTH VIETNAM?
 1      $y john S. Carroll
 What would happen if the United States cut off
 all the guns, bullets and bombs the Thicu regime
 needs to survive? George McGovern, who promises
 to do just that if given the chance, has a scenario.
 First, President Thicu and his colleagues would
 clear out of Saigon. A coalition would emerge which
 would initially embrace all the major elements on
 South Vietnam's richly variegated political land-
 scape and then negotiate a merger with the North.
 Yes, there iwould be bloodshed. Perhaps, McGovern
 says, sever Al hundred people might be assassinated.
 This opinion was not reached casually. It is
 groundefl in a number of current writings in the
 press, plus scholarly publications and memos from
 such authorities as Prof. George McT. Kahin, head of
 the Southeast Asia program at Cornell. Taken
 together, it is a fascinating body of literature, one
 which attempts to uproot: much of what pre-Nixon
 Admii'Iistration historians believed about what hap-
 pened `.4n a. similar situation-the Communist vic-
 tory Ins North Vietnam in 1:;54.
 This ':revisionism has come as a response to
 President Nixon's strident warnings of a blood-
 bath in South Vietnam. It was, as we shall see.
 developed hastily, and then eagerly seized upon
 by well-meaning writers, lawyers and politicians
 who wanted to believe that pulling the plug on
 the Saigon Government would be morally inex-
 pensive, if not free. Today at least one of the
 principal assumptions on which the revisionist
 history rests is not even believed by its own
 author. Otters are demonstrably false.
 All this ti, interesting for the effect it could have
 on the elcq on and, in turn, the effect on foreign
 policy. Perhaps the voters, after weighing the
 bloodbath of continued war against the probably
 smaller bloodbath of a Communist take-over, will
 choose tJte latter. But they should do so with eyes
 open. The choice should be painful.
 As a pro= or anti-war issue, `the bloodbath
 theory must naturally be considered along with
 other questions, such as the human cost of the
 bombing of North Vietnam and the possibility that
 the Saigon Government will ultimately crumble
 with or without our sunport. Taken alone, the
 bloodbath argument says something about the
 use of "history" in politics. Nixon uses the most
 1  extreme accounts of past. killing to predict future
 mayhem. McGovern, in spite,
 of his careers as historian and
 Vietnam spokesman, sweeps
 the whole problem under the
 rugby subscribing to shaky re-
 investigations of the past, de-

 evidence of a bloodbath in
 reports of the International

 set up by the Geneva Confer-

 "while hot definitive, give us
 a reasonable account of the
 situation in North Vietnam

 this slender reed, the authors
 base  their conclusion  that
 nothing resembling a blood-

 wanted to refute the Presi-

 of  the  Christian  Century
 findings. Reports        of  the
 I.C.C. were soon being hailed
 as   authoritative accounts
 of the post-1954 events in
 North  Vietnam.  The  argu-

 almost Identical- to that in
 the Christian Century, was
 used in quick succession by
 Professor Kahin (New York
 Times Dec.  6,  1969), Tom
 Wicker (The Times, May 12,
 1970),  and Clark Clifford
 (Life, May 22, 1970). It also
 turned up in a book called
 "Atrocities in   Vietnam:
 Myths and Realities" by Ed-

 thire are several well-known
 reasons why the land-reform

 the I.C.C. reports. One is a
 legal  end  run  the  Hanoi
 regime  made  around    the
 Geneva regulations. By early
 1955, the regime had made a
 very significant change in its
 laws to allow political re-

 the land-reform tribunals-a

 Sen4tor. McGovern himself
 has probably done more than
 anyone else to spread this be-

 declared that the sacrifices
 in Vietnam have been for the
 purpose` of saving Thieu. Re-

 that if Thieu and  some of
 his frieinds feel endangered"
 they could be granted asylum

 new wave, again started by
 Gareth Porter of Cornell. Por-
 ter has now circulated his
 new paper, which attacks the
 bloodbath theory as being
 based on "propaganda and
 careless  scholarship," and
 then, relying on the party
 newspaper  Nhan     Dan and
 other official North Vietnam-
 ese                                                                    publications,  concludes
 that only 800 to 2,500 persons
 were executed during the land
 reform.
 Porter contends that, for
 one   thing,   Hoang   Van
 Chi mistranslated North Vi-
 etnamese                                                                             documents   and
 speeches. The most serious
 case, he says, is Chi's trans-
 lation of the 1956 speech in
 which Gen. Vo Nguyen Gap
 discussed the mistakes com-
 mitted in the land reform pro-
 gram. Giap admits that the
 sources as "official documen-
 tary evidence," or "the actual
 historical record." In these
 impressive-sounding  sources
 he has found little evidence
 of a bloodbath. Hanoi has
 not accused itself of murder;
 therefore, it is innocent.
 Apart from the historical
 arguments. McGovern bases
 his  antibloodbath  faith, on
 his judgment of what the Com-
 munists intend to do today,
 not what they did 18 years
 ago.
 In July of 1969 he said his
 then recent visit to Paris had
 been helpful in making Tills
 assessment. "When I suggest-
 ed to Hanoi and N.L.F. *a..
 tional Liberation Front)
 gations that some Ameridtns
 fear a bloodbath during' or
 after  an  American  witt'lr
 drawal," he said, "they re
 party  "executed  too many    plied that just the opposi
 people." according to the Chi would    happen-the  killin
 translation-but Porter says
 this should have said meKely
 that there was an  "unjust
 disciplining of innocent peo-.
 pie." Chi also says the speech
 contains an admission that of-
 ficials "resorted to terror."
 Here again Porter says the
 translation is wrong; it should
 have said,  used excessive
 repressive measures." These
 are two of eight examples.
 At best. Chi seems guilty
 of failing to explain that his
 translations are not literal.
 At worst, his work is "fraudu-
 lent," as Porter asserts. But
 even if one reads Giap as
 translated by Porter, it is
 hard to believe that he isn't
 using elliptical language to
 describe terrible events. Chi,
 and others who speak both
 Vietnamese and English, say
 that loose translations are
 frequently used In dealing
 with Lao Dong party jargon,
 which is often euphemistic.
 "Unjust  disciplining"  does
 mean executions, they say,
 just as "excessive repressive
 measures" means terror.
 There remains one other
 disturbing  aspect  of   the
 Porter paper. After criticizing
 others  for making use of

 The Administration's reply
 to  those who  say  the
 Vietnamese Communists have
 changed their ways is simple:
 Look at Hue.
 "We saw a prelude of what
 would happen in South Viet.
 nam when the Communists
 entered the city of Hue last
 year," Nixon said In  1969.,
 "During their brief rule there,
 there wal a bloody reign of
 terror in hich 3,000 civilians
 were cIu  ed, shot to death
 and buri   In mass graves."
 Thei fare several detailed
 studie;of the Hue killings.
 The Jjie best liked by the
 White House is by Douglas
 Pike, an officer of the United
 States Information  Agency
 who has written extensively
 on the N.L.E. He concludes
 WASHINGTON STAR
 28 September 1972
 CROSB''Y S. NOYES
 that in addition to the initial
 executions of civil servants,
 police officials, military men
 and community leaders, there
 was an ominous phase dur-
 ing which the Communists
 thought they could hold the
 city forever, and set out to
 shape it to their liking.. .
 "Orders  went  out,"  Pike
 writes, "to round up what one
 prisoner termed 'social nega-
 tives"' Pike estimates that 2,-
 000 died in this period, in-
 cluding a significant portion
 of the intellectual community.
 He describes the destruction
 of a prominent "community
 leader" and his family. Not
 only was the man executed,
 but so were his wife, his mar-
 ried son and daughter-in-law,
 his young unmarried daughter,
 a male and female servant,
 their baby, the cat and the
 goldfish.
 If Pike's analysis is sound,
 denly "re-education" lists be-
 came liquidation lists. Ack-
 land concludes that the deaths
 were a result of the destruc-
 tion sown by an army in re-
 treat.
 Whether  the  Pike  studyF
 proves that Communist rule
 would be a bloodbath, as the
 Nixon side insists, may be
 open to debate. Yet in reading
 the Ackland study, which tries
 to refute this idea, one can
 hardly be encouraged by the
 treatment accorded the peo-
 ple of Hue, even prior to the
 "army in retreat" period. Is
 there any reason that those
 killed for not showing up at
 meetings, or for being "par-
 ticularly unpopular," would
 have fared any differently if
 the  Communists  had  cot
 trolled the entire country ar4
 not just Hue? "A revolution."

 This convenient finding -
 which is frnade in support of
 Gcorge McGovern'. proposals
 to surrender South Vietnam to
 Communist rule - holds that
 President Nixon had it all
 wrong when he estimated In
 1971  that perhaps a half-
 millinn penpfe were extermi-
 nnted by the North Vietnam-
 ese after they took over from
 the French in 1954.
 Still  a n o t Ii e r Vietnam
 "scholar," one Gareth Porter
 of  Cornell University, has
 come, forth to chnltcngc the
 authority for that estimate. Its
 origin, he says, was a hnnk
 the events in Hue portend
 brutal social engineering un-
 der a Communist regime.
 The  counterargument  to
 Pike comes from Len E. Ack-
 land, the co-author of the
 Christian   Century article,
 who lived in Hue during 1967
 and returned after Tot to re-
 construct the occupation in
 Gia Hot, a precinct of 25,000
 residents.
 Ackland agrees that there
 were some blacklist killings
 at first. He writes that during
 the first week and a half, the
 deaths included executions of
 people "as examples" for fail-
 ing to report as ordered to
 meetings, as well as killings
 of selected individuals "be-
 cause they had been particu-
 larly unpopular with Hue's
 population." The mass deaths
 came, Ackland goes on, when

 So    American officials see
 the   eported  executions  in
 Bin id h as a sample of the
 ing over South Vietnam by
 force.
 Such violence, these officials
 say, especially would be ex-
 pected if a Communist victory
 were "sudden and decisive."
 Other  American  officials,
 however, say  that history
 would suggest that a sudden
 and decisive victory "just isn't
 in the cards for either side."
 These officials feel that if
 the North Vietnamese Commu-
 nists were eventually to gain
 control  of  South  Vietnam
 through a gradual political set-
 tlement, they might well adopt
 a conciliatory attitude toward
 their  former  opponents in
 hopes of uniting the country.
 But those who most firmly
 -subscribe  to  the "bloodbath
 theory" are convinced that any
 kind of enemy take-over would
 result in the execution of many
 officials in the Government in
 Saigon.
 Some Americans with con-
 siderable experience in study-

 four and a half years, nearly 25,000 South
 Vietnamese civilians and officials have
 been executed by the North Vietnamese
 Communists and the Viet Cong.
 There have, of course, been atrocities
 on the Allied side. But anyone who is stilt
 prepared to maintain that a Communist
 takeover In South Vietnam would not
 lead to a bloodbath of major dimensions
 Is simply Ignoring the evidence at hand.
 A politician like Senator McGovern,
 who advocates a quick and unilateral
 American withdrawal from Southeast
 Asia, need look no farther than the shal-
 low graves of Binhdinh province to see
 where the policies he advocates would
 lead those who have placed their trust in

 Chapter III: Hue
 he city of Hue is one of the saddest cities of our earth,
 not simply because of what happened there in February,
 1968, unthinkable as that was. It is a silent rebuke to all of
 us, inheritors of 40 centuries of civilization, who in our
 century have allowed collectivist politics to corrupt us
 into the worst of the modern sins, indifference to inhuman-
 ity. What happened in Hue should give pause to every civil-
 ized person. It should be inscribed, so as not to be forgotten,
 along with the record of other terrible visitations of man's
 inhumanity to man which stud the history of the human
 race. Hue is another demonstration of what man can bring
 himself to do when he fixes no limits on political action and
 pursues uncautiously the dream of social perfectibility.
 What happened in Hue, physically, can be described with
 a few quick statistics. A communist force which eventually
 reached 12,000 invaded the city the night of the new moon
 marking tha new lunar year, January 30, 1968. It stayed
 for 26 days and then was driven out by military action. In
 the wake of this Tet offensive, 5,800 Hue civilians were dead
 or missing. It is now known that most of them are dead.
 The bodies of most have been found in the past 20 months,
 in single and mass graves throughout Thua Thien province
 which surrounds this cultural capital of Viet-Nam.
 Such are the skeletal facts. the important statistics. Such
 is what the incurious world knows, if it knows anything at
 about Hue, for this is what was written, modestly, by the
 world's press. Apparently it made no impact on the world's
 mind or conscience. For there was no agonized outcry. No
 demonstrations at North Vietnamese embassies around the
 world. Lord Russell did not send his "war crimes tribunal" to
 Hue to take evidence and indict. In a tone beyond bitterness,
 the people there will tell you that the world does not know
 what happened in Hue or if it does, does not care.
 The City
 Considered by Asian standards, Hue is 'not old, less than
 t,: o centuries. The ancient imperial capital was Hanoi. A
 dynastic breakup in the early 1800's afforded a powerful
 court noble the chance to seize the mantle of power, which
 he did. He proclaimed himself Emperor Gia Long and went
 on to become one of Viet-Nam's most =famous rulers. One of
 Gia Long's first acts was to move the capital far to the
 south, to the banks of the meandering Perfume river half
 way between Hanoi and Saigon. There he settled his court
 behind the newly-built walled fortification now called the
 Citadel. Inside his artisans erected buildings, working with
 sketches of the nalrh provi qe, shoot and wound
 the hamlet chief and-hisYieputy.

 Statistics (See Chart Below)
 In May, 1967 the GVN-U.S. began employing nev and
 more sophisticated s)-sterns, some using computers, for the
 collection and 2. 1a1ysis of statistical data, including data on
 terror incidents. Under the new systerns, categories were
 changed some what and therefore the pre-1967 figures below
 are not strictly comparable to those later (hence the drop
 in total number of terror acts for 1968 and first ten months
 of 1969).
 With respect to the general matter of the Viet-Nam war
 and statistics, experienced writers in the mass media, the
 academic community and in government have learned, often
 from personal and bitter experience, not to try to quantify
 the Viet-Nam war. As a result they reflexively eschew sta-
 tistics, not because they do not recognize them as a valuable
 too], but because they know the conditions and circumstances
 under which they are collected make them. at best, untrust-
 worthy, and at worst, dangerously misleading. With respect
 to terror acts, the data proccessing system is chiefly depen-
 dent on reports from the 2500-village countryside, a shaky
 base indeed.
 Like most people in developing societies the Vietnamese
 are not great record keepers and particularly are not keepers
 of precise numbers, usually seeing no need. (Belief in the
 imperative need for figures, indeed simply to become sta-
 tistics-conscious, seems to be a characteristic that develops
 as does the society.) Beyond this unperceived need to collect
 statistics of any sort, including. those on terror, there is in
 Viet-Nam a fog of war which by its disruptive naturevirtual-
 ly prohibits systematic and patient collection of data. War is
 often responsible for the destruction of such data as has
 been assembled. This is the case, for example, of records of
 land surveys. title deeds and other legal documents on Hold-
 ings in th Mekong Delta, a jurist's nightmare, one which
 the courts will be sorting out for a generation.
 Thus in Viet-Nam there is the triple problem of indiffer-
 ence to the collection of statistics, inability because of war
 to collect them, and incomplete reporting even when collected.
 Therefore this chart is to be treated cautiously. Its benefit,
 if any. is simply to suggest the scope and general order of
 magnitude of communist terror acts over the years; the
 error probably is not more than plus or minus 25 percent.

 PITY THE SOVIET. FAFZMER
 There has been a tendency to blame this year's poor showing by
 Soviet agriculture almost wholly on the weather.  Granted, the
 extremes of climatic conditions in the USSR of the past few months
 have been the most horrendous of the last quarter century.  But
 climatic adversities cannot explain why Soviet agriculture which
 gets the world's largest inputs of labor (nearly one-third of the
 Soviet labor force) and financial investment (over the last 20
 years a capital investment of some $600 billion and today about
 one-fourth of all investment in buildings, structures and equip-
 ment) is unable to meet consumer needs and is gradually trans-
 forming the Soviet Union from a grain exporter into a grain
 importer.  The main message in the attached Backgrounder and
 accompanying press reprints is that as long as Soviet agriculture
 continues to operate under its present system of collectivization,
 as long as the Soviet "economic model" persists, so long will Soviet
 agriculture remain in its present precarious condition.

 FOR BACKGROUND USE ONLY                         October-November 1972
 Perhaps indicative of Soviet sensitivities about the plight of
 agriculture in the USSR is the leadership's preoccupation with
 "overtaking the U.S." in farm production.  Last November, for
 example, Soviet Premier Kosygin told the Supreme Soviet that "the
 general volume of ... agricultural production in the USSR in 1975
 will exceed the present level of ... agricultural production in
 the United States."  However, the way things are going at the moment,
 the Soviet Union looks to be unable to overtake its own agricultural
 production rate for the next several years --- let alone by 1975.
 In the Soviet Union, national Farmers' Day is celebrated on
 October 8th.  This year in Moscow the weather was gloomy and skies
 overcast.  It was fitting backdrop for the officially announced
 estimates that came over radio and TV to the effect that this year's
 grain harvest will come only to about 167 million metric tons.
 Officials emphasized that this harvest will be roughly at the
 average level for the previous five-year plan.  What the officials'
 statements ignored was that this year's harvest will fall about 30
 to 35 million tons below what their planned target was for this year
 and about 25 percent below last year's harvest.
 Granted, one of this year's biggest bogeys has been the weather.
 First, winterkill damaged about 10 percent of the winter crop.  Next,
 scorching weather cut sharply into the harvest of the breadbasket of
 European Russia as that area went through its hottest, driest summer
 in 26 years.  Finally, harvesters in the late-grain-ripening areas
 of Siberia were faced with a cold, wet autumn harvest season and a
 race against frost to get the grain cut.  Chances are that because
 of extreme dampness and the slim possibility of fully drying the
 grain, the Siberian area crops will have an unusually high spoilage
 rate.  Tus, despite official forecasts of a healthy 167 million
 ton intake, the tonnage of actually useable grain will be something
 far below that figure.
 Even though climatic conditions this year have again exposed
 the fragility of Soviet agriculture, weather cannot be blamed for
 most of the ills that continually plague that sector of the economy.
 Weather does not account for irrational planning practices, tractor
 and tractor parts shortages, the insufficiency of combines for
 harvesting, inadequate storage facilities, and the ever-too-low
 fertilizer input.  Bad rural roads and lack of adequate transport
 continue to hamper both fertilizer delivery and grain collection.
 All this in spite of the enormous investments that have been poured
 into agriculture, particularly during the current five-year plan.

 Agriculture is probably the saddest victim of the Soviet penchant
 for forcing growth by heavy doses of investment aimed at increasing
 the quantity of production as quickly as possible without regard to
 efficiency or quality.  In fact, there is nothing that sheds more
 light on the use of resources under the "Soviet economic model" than
 an analysis of its agricultural methods.  Soviet investments in
 agriculture (using American prices at 1970 purchasing power) were over
 $50 billion in 1956-1960, over $270 billion during the 1960's, and
 are scheduled to surpass $260 billion during the current five-year
 plan.  In other words, during the course of 20 years agriculture will
 have received close to $600 billion in capital funds.  This figure
 does not include investments in farm supply industries such as
 chemiE Ts or highways or central warehouses.  This extremely high
 cost of Soviet agriculture goes far beyond the subsidizations pre-
 valent in any Western country.*
 In addition to the tremendous capital fund investment that Soviet
 agriculture has been getting, the farm sector now gets about one-
 fourth of all investment in buildings, structures, and equipment.
 And lately, deliveries of fertilizer, spare parts, fuel, and electric
 power from industry have been increasing,;  But despite all this
 attention, the farm sector cannot keep up with demands arising from
 new consumer programs and Soviet grain buyers have again been forced
 to scrape the barrel for imports from the Americas, Canada, and
 Western Europe.
 Mist experts stress that Soviet agricultural returns would be
 greater if investments were made in intensive improvement --- in
 quality, in technology, in skilled labor, in yield per acre and
 weight per animal --- rather than as is being done in more con-
 struction, more acres, and more head of livestock.  But Mr.
 Brezhnev has put his money on gross expansion.  Yet today, in spite
 of some expansion, agriculture continues to be the weakest and least
 productive sector of the Soviet economy and its huge collective and
 state farms, the most poorly managed and inefficient organizational
 form in the country.  Nearly one-third of the labor force is still
 employed on farms and the cost of producing grain and meat is still
 far above world market prices.
 During 1971, even with their second largest crop in Soviet
 history, the USSR was forced to buy heavily on world markets.  At
 this writing, purchases of grain from Western markets for delivery
 in 1972 and 1973 are over 27 million metric tons (valued at $1.8
 billion) and can be expected to increase.  Payments must be in hard
 *In the United States, for example, agriculture in 1970 invested
 $5.8 billion.  Capital stock at the end of 1970 was valued at $66
 billion after depreciation and at $145 billion undepreciated.

 currency and will not be offset by Soviet grain exports which bring
 in either soft currency from East European clients or practically
 nothing, as in the case of Cuba or Bangladesh.
 The forecast is that in the short run the Soviet Union will be
 able to finance its foreign grain purchases without trouble through
 gold sales and cutting back on other hard currency imports.  But in
 the longer run, when payments of principal and interest begin to
 fall due, the chronic Soviet trade imbalance with hard-currency
 'trade partners will become ever more severe.  Western experts say it
 is highly questionable whether the Soviet Union will be able to
 :recover soon or fully from its current agricultural setbacks.

 Dread Waste.
 Officials have assured the
 public  several  times  that
 there is no cause to fear a
 bread shortage, hut. the press
 has  also  carried  articles
 criticizing people who waste
 bread.
 The government has al-

 the bread supply by con-
 tracting for vast quantities
 of  foreign  wheat,  mostly
 Americlin and Canadian. By
 Western, est.imate, the Soviet
 Union will spend 51.5 billion
 or more nn foreign grain
 purchases. At this level, the
 poor harvest becomes an im-
 portant factor for the entire
 Soviet economy.
 The Soviet Union operates
 on a five-year plan whose
 parts are all interconnected.
 The plan for this year fore-
 saw production of about .:90
 million'tnns of grain. West-
 ern experts here predict the
 harvest will he. 20 to ?.0 mil.
 lion tons short of that goal.
 Western scholars assume
 that the five-year plan (Ines
 not slimy much margin for
 error. When a crucial factor
 like the harvest falls so far
 belpw expectations, adjhist-
 menls throughout the econ-
 omy are probably inevitable.
 The first of these may
 come in the hard currency
 budget. If the Soviets do
 spend more than $1.5 billion
 for grain this year, far more
 than they had planned, they
 will have to cut hack other
 purchases of foreign goods,
 or perhaps sell off some of
 their vast gold reserves.
 (The Soviet ruble is a
 "soft" currency - it isn't
 traded   on   international
 money markets, and West-
 ern businessmen won't ac-
 cept it).

 Soviet   Union  now seeks
 Abroad is modern technol-
 ogy. So a had harvest can
 hinder the modernization of
 this country's enormous but
 uncompetitive ecnnnmy,
 though this may be the sine

 the Soviet leaders have set
 for themselves.
 Rrrzhnev  and  his  col-
 )eagues may well feel that
 this is an undeserved trick
 of fate. Their plan was not
 unreasonable, assuming rei-
 atively normal wrather. But
 the weather hrre has hrrn
 wildly abnormal since last
 winter. and it has frustrated(
 the country's farmers in al-
 most every imaginable way.
 First the weather was dry
 and  extremely cold.  The
 winter wheat harvest was
 unsuccessful.  The ground
 was dry when planted, and
 got drier as .July and August
 became months of drought.
 Then,  when    the harvest
 began, heavy rains In many
 sections ruined much of the
 crop.
 Leap Year

 crops, like apples, did poorly
 this year. One Muscovite re-

 Poor 1itbor productivity in the countryside
 Is not We fault of the farm workers. It Is
 caused by the unwieldy setup of the collective
 and stated farms.
 Accoling to economists Michael E. Brad-
 ley and M. Gardner Clark, writing in the
 spring Issue of the British Journal Soviet
 Studies, the average size and labor force of
 Soviet and American farms compare as

 charact4r. The peasant. 'is no longer inter.
 ested In ithe land, and management becomes
 so enmp1la-ted that effective supervision of
 labor Is nearly impossible.
 Soviet farm managers and economists
 have come tip with various proposals to
 subdivide and decentralize the large farms.
 The  most  successful  and ? popular  ex-
 perimental approach has been to place a
 small acreage, approximately the size of the
 average American farm, in the hands of two
 or three families for several years.

 allotted Mild. These so-called Independent
 mechanized teams - the Russian word Is
 zveno, or link - have brought encouraging
 results wherever they have been tried.
 Only a few hundred zvenos have been set up
 thus far because Communist dogmatists fear
 that they might let in capitalism by the back
 door. I3utt the zveno system has supporters.
 The strongest zveno advocate is Politburo
 member Genady 1. Voronov, formerly pre-
 mier of Russia proper.
 In the past, Mr. Voronov's suggestion to
 introduce zvenos on a larger scale has been
 overruled. A speech he made two years ago,
 championing the zvenos, was published only
 in a small provincial journal.
 Soon thereafter he lost his position as
 premier of the Russian Federation though he
 remains a full member of the Politburo.
 Recently the idea has again come to the
 fore. Its favorable discussion in Pravda and
 Izvestia, against the background of this
 year's grain calamity, may point to a larger
 application of the zveno system.
 ' Russian consumers, meanwhile, are not
 expected to feel the present crop failure as
 severely as the one of 1963-1964, which
 preceded the ouster of former Premier Nikita
 S.Krushchev.
 The party and government have boldly
 decided to Import enough food grain to keep
 the public's breadbasket filled, at least in
 metropolitan areas. While the people are
 urged not to waste grain, nowhere have they
 been admonished to tighten their belts.
 Another favorable factor is the party
 leadership's decision of last year to concen-
 trate on meat and dairy farming rather than
 on field production.
 Larger units preferred
 Concentration on meat and dairy farming
 has the advantage in Soviet conditions that it
 lends itself to production in bigger farm
 units, which the Communists prefer.
 The farm predicament Is likely to come up
 at the party Central Committee session that
 will precede the meeting of the Supreme
 Soviet on Sept. 19. Once again General
 Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev, Is expected to
 present the main report.
 His recent swing through the eastern
 territories indicated concern for the weak
 spots of Soviet agriculture:  Its extreme
 dependence on the vagaries of the weather,
 its immobilization of a huge labor force, and
 the built-in handicaps to labor efficiency and
 management.

 The big imports of food grains to tide the
 Soviet Union over a difficult winter show that
 the Kremlin is keenly aware of the possibility
 of political repercussions at home.
 While these imports may lead to a raising
 of eyebrows by Moscow's financial experts,
 for the public at large they are a sign that
 their leaders are taking practical measures

 Brezhnev's battle
 for bread
 The Russian press in recent weeks has
 had a wartime look about it. Every-
 where tkcre is talk of "winning the
 battle." };von sober Pravda tries to con-
 vey the excitement, highlighting dis-
 patches ftf'om its front-line correspon,
 dents in Siberia and Kazakhstan, car-
 rying articles full of military metaphors
 and splashing pictures of war her6cs
 and their assault vehicles. No, not
 tanks, combine harvesters :  the battle
 today is for bread.
 This year's harvest has had to com-
 pete against the natural perils of a
 frosty winter followed by a very dry
 summer. The damage done to the crop
 in wester. Russia makes the yield from
 the new  ranaries of Kazakhstan and
 Siberia or vital importance. But, judg-
 ing from ;its eager shopping for grain,
 from  the; United  States,  Canada,
 France aril Australia, the government
 seems to be preparing for the worst.
 The problems of this year's harvest
 are a stage in the protracted battle to
 modernise farming, and to, put agricul-
 ture, which even today employs more
 than a riarter of all Russian workers,
 on a pa  with industry. The struggle
 has been going on for nearly 20 years.
 Khrushchcv tried to restore the balance
 by shock tactics, the magic of maize
 and th   mass reclamation of virgin
 lands.  incc he disappeared from the
 scene tfie battle has been less spec-
 tacular lout not less expensive : farming
 is to aChcorb  21.5  per cent of total
 capital investment in the current five-'
 year plat(,
 CPYRGH 'w YORK TTrTS

 't'argets have become more realistic
 than they were in K.hrushchev's day.
 The aim for 197t-75 is an average
 yearly grain crop of 195m tons com-
 pared with 167.5m tons to the previous
 five years. 't'otal agricultural output is
 in yo u l) by about 21 per cent over the
 same pcrio . Or at least that is the
 plan. Altho gh Russian farming output
 has, on a rage, been' rising steadily
 over recent years, the increase -m pro-,
 duction d   s not correspond-.to the
 money you ed in.
 This  ap arently - unbridgable  gap.
 hrtwecn wi at goes in and what comes
 out has lc  westerners to suggest two
 alternative ourses for Russia's planners.
 The first i that Russia should follow
 the   exam le  of  nineteenth-century
 Britain an  rely on industrial exports
 to pay for  large part of its food. But
 the analo   does not really apply.
 Britain, at that time, could afford this
 policy front its sale of manufactured
 goods ; the Soviet Union is still mainly
 exporting  aw materials. Its problem
 is  not  h w  to  pay  for  foreign
 food but . ow to increase its own
 yield from is land.
 Mr  Bre.hnev  has  several    times
 admitted tI at it will take many five-
 year plans o overcome the difficulties.'
 Ile has al   made it plain that the
 basic probl is not so much bread as
 grain for livestock and a resultant
 major exp nsion in meat and dairy
 farming. T is is where the deal with
 the United States, with its emphasis on
 animal  fe d-stuffs,  comes  in.  But
 a   change  in  approach  is  needed.
 Hitherto t e outside world has pro-
 vided Russ'  with stopgap supplies in
 years of ba harvest. If Russia's plan-
 ners could phick up the courage to
 accept the  ccessity of regular outside
 raise Soviet-American trade
 unprect'dentcd heights.

 rearing programme would be enlarged
 beyond the scope of present plans.
 The second suggestion put out by
 westerners Js that Russia should shift
 its farming towards smaller holdings
 and more private enterprise. This, -too,
 is an unlikely development. It is true
 that in their recent efforts to boost farm
 production the Russians have paid
 greater heed to financial incentives.
 Prices for farm produce were, raised,
 bonuses were introduced and wages
 have gone up on both . state and
 collective farms. But over the past 20'
 years the unmistakable trend is away
 from smaller units of production and
 private holdings towards larger estates
 under closer control. In 1950 there
 were some 125,000 collective farms.
 By now these have been merged into
 33,000  larger  units,  each  kolkhoz
 averaging Moo acres under cultivation.
 Despite present troubles and past
 failures, Russia's agricultural planners
 have not altered their ends and hardly
 their means. They are still banking on
 more equipment, more- fertilisers, and
 on land improvement and' a bigger
 electricity  supply, ' to  bring  them
 closer to western levels of productivity.
 How far they still have -to go is
 reflected in manpower figures. In 1970
 no less than 26.4 per cent of the total.
 Soviet labour force was still employed
 in farming ; this was twice the French
 and five,times the American proportion.'
 Without a radical change in -this pat-
 tern, and the plan for 1975 forecast' a
 proportion still as high as 23.1 per
 cent, Russia will continue to be sort-.
 ously handicapped in its economic race
 with the west. But this is the long-term
 problem. Mr Brezhnev's mind is no.
 doubt on  more  immediate issues:
 Russia's last disastrous harvest, in 1963,
 preceded Nikita Khrushchev's fall.

 Inbalance of Trade
 The large sales to the Soviet
 Union will cause a severe Im.
 balance in trade between the
 two countries. Last year, the
 United States exported about
 $t25-million  to  the  Soviet
 Union and Imported about half
 that amount. The disproportion
 will grow with the extensive ag-
 ricultural purchases as well as

 Because of this anticipated[
 trade imbalance. Moscow will
 have to find ways of paying for
 its purchases. Under the origi-
 nal   $750-million   three-year
 deal,   the Administration,
 through the Commodity Credit
 Corporation, had agreed to ex-
 tend a maximum of $500-
 mil-lion in credit.
 Agriculture Department of
 ficials said that the additional
 purchases would be paid for
 "privately," meaning, in most
 cases, by cash.
 Gold Sales Possible
 Some officials here believe'
 that the Russians may have to
 sell gold on the world market
 to cover the heavy agricultural
 purchases.
 It is believed that under thel
 terms of the deals, some of the:
 farm products will be deliv red
 by third-country ships andFthe
 rest by Soviet and American
 ships.
 The Russians, aware of the
 'trade Imbalance, have  beer

 States to participate in joint
 efforts to exploit the untapped
 oil, gas and metal resources of
 Siberia.
 This was a major topic dis-

 isaster in Grain Harvest
 By Murray Seeger
 Loa An?ele* Times
 MOSCOW-Revelations  of
 .new gra n pure nsc. an new
 cy)mestic indicators here sug-
 gest that the Soviet Union is
 facing n dlsastro-is agricul-,
 tural year this year.
 "It appears that their crop
 losses will be phenomenal,"
 one analyst observed.
 Other observers noted that
 the country's crop problems
 started  cjlring  the  winter
 when there was little snow to
 nourish : the  winter  wheat
 crop. Tfie summer growing,
 season I*s seen record tempe-i
 matures 'pnd a drought.
 "Their, grain Is ripening all
 at the same time," one expert
 said. "Usually, they move their
 machines from the south to
 fthe north and east as the crop
 [develops. This year, it has
 come on all at the same time
 land they cannot follow their
 schedules."
 Last week, the official press
 revealed   that   Communist
 Party leader Leonid Brezhnev
 held an unusual meeting of
 the party Central Committee,
 agricultural officials and Im-
 portant editors to discuss the
 grain harvest.
 Editors Included
 Although the substance of
 meeting has not been dis-
 ci sod, diplomatic observers
 sa d the unusual inclusion of
 e [tors in such a meeting sug-
 g sted that the party was pre-
 p ring to tell the p'hlic of a
 m jar short fall in the i'72
 1  m output.
 ,, -oviet  authorities  admit
 ti y do not have enough mod-
 on  harvesting equipment to
 met their annual needs. The
 n wspaper  'Rural  Life   re-
 p rted lest week that 21,000
 tr icks were being sent to the
 A tat' region ? in southwestern
 R ssja to help bring In the
 to at harvest.
 "The harvest front Is speed-
 II  transferring to the east of
 t    country," the newspaper
 s. d. "The fate of the crop of!
 1 2 will be settled there in
 c rated days and hours. All
 e orts must be exerted for
 s  cessful conducting of the
 h rvest and Increased grain
 sa es to the state.""
 Ithough Russia has often
 h d major crop failures In the
 p st, the '1972 problem Is espe-
 11  acute because
 and government leaders have,
 been conducting a campaign
 to increase the supply of meat
 to the people.
 The grain purchases outside
 the country must therefore in-
 clude more expensive fodder
 grains as well as bread grains
 In order for the leaders to
 keep their promise of a better
 diet for the people.
 Butcher Cattle
 An alternative to spending
 valuable  hard currency or
 gold for grain would be to
 butcher the nation's new de.
 veloping cattle herds prema-
 turely.
 "I don't think they are pre-
 pared politically to do that,"
 one Western observer said.
 It was reported earlier this
 month that the Soviet Union
 Ihas decided to buy about 10
 million tons of wheat and 4
 million tons -of feed grains
 from the United States for do.
 livery next year,
 One million tons of soy'
 beans were also believed to..
 have been sold to the Soviet

 some $900 million. The Soviets
 were granted the right to, buy,
 as much as $500 million worthl
 on three-year loans at Sll per{

 Sales now being arr nged'
 are expected to be largely for
 cash since It would otherwise

 The last member of the Soviet Embassy's unwelcome trio finally
 departed as Anatoliy A. Lobanov, one of three Soviet diplomats whose
 recall the Danish government suggested in April, left Denmark on
 31 August.  The three diplomats in question First Secretary Lobanov,
 `.Chard Secretary Anatoliy N. Illarionov and Attache Mikhail K.
 Makarov, were charged with committing actions incompatible with their
 status.
 On 7 April the Danish Foreign Ministry informed the Soviet
 Ambassador Nikolai G. Egorychev that the Danish government would not
 expel the free-wheeling "diplomats" if they would quietly leave the
 .country.  The Soviet Ambassador rejected all allegations of wrong-
 doing on their part and none of the accused diplomats made any
 apparent move to leave his post.
 But what the three had been up to is well documented in the
 Danish press. Makarov attempted to bribe a member of the Danish
 Folketing (parliament), known for his anti-European community
 views by offering to underwrite the expense of publishing and
 distribution of an anti-Common Market pamphlet.  Makarov also tried
 unsuccessfully to buy an Asian Embassy's diplomatic code; his fellow
 diplomat, presumably Illarionov, posing as a Latin American, then
 .offered the Asian diplomat ten thousand kroner for the code.  All
 this unwanted publicity forced the two men to leave during the summer.
 :Lobanov remained in Copenhagen and the Soviet Ambassador indicated
 that he had no intention of ordering Lobanov's departure.  But
 parliamentary inquiry to the Danish Foreign Minister concerning
 Lobanov's status seems to have precipitated his overdue departure:
 Five months after the fact, the last of the miscreants left the
 Danish scene.  Ambassador Egorychev remains behind to handle another
 "misunderstanding" in Danish-Soviet relations.
 The latest incident occurred in early September when a Danish
 fishing trawler in international waters picked up a Russian trying
 to flee across the Baltic to Sweden.  Shortly after the rescue an
 armed Soviet naval vessel came alongside the Danish trawler which was
 then boarded by pistol carrying Soviet sailors.  The hapless Russian
 was forced to leave his refuge.  The Danish Foreign Ministry says
 it is investigating the incident and intends to officially protest
 to the Soviet Union.

 MOSCOW BLENDS INTO THE LOCAL SCENE
 An unusual story has filtered out of Burma -- one which
 Moscow's TASS correspondent there would not file to his hometown
 newspaper.  The story concerns TASS correspondent Yuriy Grigoriev's
 conversion to Buddhism.  According to several newspaper accounts
 Grigoriev, a thirty-three-year-old newsman , returned to Burma for
 the second time in October 1971 as a correspondent of the official
 Soviet news agency TASS.  In April of this year Grigoriev was
 ordained a Buddhist monk, assumed a Burmese name for himself and
 his wife and daughter who also became converts.  One of the more
 intriguing aspects of this story is that Grigoriev's conversion
 ceremony was attended by various members of the Soviet embassy, an
 uncommon official blessing at best.  One might surmise that Moscow
 had given its approval for its own political reasons.  The
 Vientiane newspaper Xat Lao viewed the episode with due skepticism.
 "As is well known most Soviet diplomats and news correspondents
 assigned to perform duties abroad are members of the communist
 party who do not believe in God.  The ideals of the communist party
 is their religion.  Therefore, there have been doubts whether
 Grigoriev had resigned from the party before he became a Buddhist
 monk; whether he really had faith in Buddhism; whether he just wants
 to serve propaganda purposes; whether he wants to spy; or whether
 he wants to destroy Buddhism."
