IT SUPPLIES A STARTING POINT FOR WHAT 1 HAVE BEEN

OTHERWISE, WITH SUCH A LARGE SUBJECT, I MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN IN THE POSITION OF THE YOUNG ARAB PRINCE WHO 
WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY UTILIZING THE ABUNDANTLY 
STOCKED HAREM HIS FATHER HAD GIVEN HIM FOR HIS 21ST 
BIRTHDAY--HE KNEW WHAT TO DO, BUT COULDNIT FIGURE 
OUT WHERE TO START,

UNITED STATES HAS BEEN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR 
ALLIES OF WESTERN EUROPE. WE CAN GO ON EASILY 
FROM THERE TO THE "OTHER EUROPE," ESPECIALLY THE 
SOVIET UNION, WHERE ALMOST EVERY DEVELOPMENT IM-
PACTS ON US POLICY, AND FREQUENTLY THREATENS OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY. CHINA, OF COURSE, IS ALSO VERY 
MUCH A PART OF THE WORLD SITUATION THESE DAYS, AS 
IS THE FESTERING--AND MENACING--STALEMATE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST, I WILL CONCLUDE WITH A BRIEF DIS-
CUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK FOR PEACE AND STABILITY IN 
INDOCHINA, 
EUROPE  
WHAT, THEN, HAS THIS "YEAR OF EUROPE" SO FAR 
PRODUCED? MOST OF WESTERN EUROPE HAS BEEN CON-
SOLIDATED AROUND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES; THERE 
HAS BEEN PROGRESS IN EAST-WEST DETENTE; AND A 
NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE 
UNITED STATES IS EVOLVING. 
ONE ASPECT OF WESTERN EUROPE--AND THE MOST IM-
PORTANT--REMAINS THE SAME THE MORE IT CHANGES: THE 
PERSISTENCE OF POLITICS, ALL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT DOMESTIC INFLATION THAN 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS. MOST OF THE CONCERNS OVER FOR-
EIGN AFFAIRS ARE SHARED CONCERNS: MULTILATERAL

RELATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, RELATIONS 
WITH THE US, AND RELATIONS WITH THE USSR. WESTERN 
EUROPEANS ARE ALSO SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS TO SOCIAL, 
CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AT A LOWER LEVEL, 
SUCH AS THE FESTERING WALLOON-FLEMISH PROBLEMS, AND 
ULSTER. 
THE THREE LARGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT OF THE 
WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES?FRANCE, BRITAIN, AND 
WEST GERMANY--HAVE MUCH IN COMMON, THE THREE

WITH CONFIDENCE. 
PRESIDENT POMPIDOU EMERGED FROM THE PARLIAMEN-
TARY ELECTIONS IN MARCH WITH A SOLID MAJORITY IN THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND WITH INCREASED PERSONAL 
STRENGTH, MEN CLOSE TO HIM HOLD MAJOR POSTS AND 
THE INFLUENCE OF THE ORTHODOX GAULLISTS HAS BEEN 
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY 
ACTED TO MEET ITS PRE-ELECTION COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL 
AND ECONOMIC REFORM. STUDENT AND WORKER DEMONSTRA-
TIONS HAVE DIED DOWN AND ARE UNLIKELY AGAIN TO 
THREATEN GOVERNMENT STABILITY. PARIS SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO DEAL WITH ITS EUROPEAN PARTNERS AND THE 
US FROM A STRONG POSITION.

SIGNS OF STRENGTHENING. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN BE-
LOW THREE PERCENT; ECONOMIC GROWTH IS APPROACHING A

INTO THE INFLATIONARY RATE. MOST OF THE TRADE

ONES WILL NEGOTIATE NEW CONTRACTS NEXT FALL. TALKS 
ON THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT 
AND UNION LEADERS WILL BEGIN SOON, AND MAY BE A 
CLUE AS TO WHETHER BRITAIN CAN ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT 
INDUSTRIAL PEACE TO PERMIT ITS INITIAL ACCOMMODA-
TION WITH EC MEMBERSHIP. 
IN BONN, THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF SOCIAL AND FREE 
DEMOCRATS--LED BY CHANCELLOR BRANDT AND FOREIGN 
MINISTER SCHEEL--HAS A SIZEABLE PARLIAMENTARY MA-
JORITY AND SEEMS ASSURED OF STAYING POWER FOR THE 
FULL FOUR-YEAR TERM. As ELSEWHERE, INFLATION HAS 
BEEN GROWING AT RECORD RATES, BUT THE CHANCELLOR 
SHOWS SIGNS OF GETTING ON WITH DOMESTIC REFORMS; THE

HIM; AND THE VISITS HE HAS JUST HAD WITH PRESIDENT 
NIXON AND WITH BREZHNEV HAVE ADDED TO HIS STATURE. 
THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE COMMUNIfle LAST JANU-
ARY AND, MORE PARTICULARLY, THE SHIFTS IN NATIONAL 
POLICIES THAT MADE THAT ENLARGEMENT POSSIBLE, HAVE 
SET THE STAGE FOR RESUMING STEP-BY-STEP PROGRESS 
TOWARD A WESTERN EUROPE THAT CAN EVENTUALLY BE A 
COHESIVE FORCE IN WORLD POLITICAL AS WELL AS ECO-
NOMIC AFFAIRS. 
THE SPECIFIC SIGNS OF THIS POSITIVE--IF STILL 
PAINFUL MOVEMENT--ARE EVIDENT IN MANY AREAS, SUCH 
AS: 
--THE EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF COMMUNITY AFFAIRS 
IN THE BRITISH PRESS; 
--THE EXCELLENT PERSONNEL THAT LONDON HAS SENT 
TO STAFF THE EC's INSTITUTIONS AND THE LIVE-
LINESS OF THE DEBATES IN THE EUROPEAN PAR-
LIAMENT; 
--THE WILLINGNESS OF BONN TO DISAGREE WITH 
PARIS ON EC POLICIES; 
--THE IMPATIENCE OF SOME OF THE NEW MEMBERS 
WITH THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE BRUSSELS IN-
STITUTIONS;

BUT IT IS THE IMPENDING ARRIVAL--NOT THE AR-
RIVAL--OF "EUROPE" THAT HAS INJECTED A NEW AND COM-
PLICATING FACTOR INTO THE UNFOLDING OF DETENTE ON 
THE EUROPEAN SCENE, WHEN MOSCOW FIRST ADVOCATED A 
CONFERENCE ON EUROPEAN SECURITY, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT 
THE SOVIET UNION ACCEPTED THE "REALITY" OF THE COM-
MUNITI y. ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE FIRST 
MINISTERIAL SESSION OF THE CSCE WILL CONVENE AT THE 
END OF JUNE AS SCHEDULED, THE SOVIETS CANNOT HAVE 
BEEN TOTALLY PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE PREPARATORY 
TALKS HAVE GONE NOR WITH THE OUTCOME THAT SEEMS IN 
PROSPECT. MOSCOW WANTED AN EARLY AND QUICK COMMIT-
MENT TO THE CONVENING OF CSCE, BUT INSTEAD WAS 
DRAGGED THROUGH LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS OF AGENDA ISSUES. 
DESPITE THE QUALMS WITH WHICH THE UNITED STATES 
ENTERED THE CSCEJ THERE IS A MUTUALITY OF INTERESTS

AMONG THE EUROPEANS THAT IS OFTEN STRONGER THAN THE 
LURE OF BILATERAL "DEALS" WITH THE RUSSIANS. MORE-
OVER, ALTHOUGH THE EUROPEANS ARE RELUCTANT TO PUT 
OUT HARD CASH FOR DEFENSE, THERE IS NO COLLECTIVE 
DESIRE TO COMMIT SUICIDE. 
OUR ALLIES HAVE REACTED FAVORABLY TO MANY OF 
THE MBFR PROPOSALS WHICH WE PROPOSED THAT NATO SHOULD 
CONSIDER WHEN THE TALKS RESUME THIS FALL. NEVERTHE-
LESS, THE REDUCTION OF THESE PROPOSALS TO SPECIFIC 
GUIDELINES AND TACTICAL APPROACHES WILL NOT BE EASY. 
MOST OF THE ALLIES ARE RESIGNED TO--AND SOME GRATEFULLY 
ACCEPT--CONFINING INITIAL REDUCTIONS TO US AND SOVIET 
FORCES. BUT THEY ARE PROFOUNDLY WORRIED THAT THE 
EXERCISE MAY DEGENERATE INTO A BILATERAL ONE AND 
THAT IT MAY TOUCH UPON THE FORWARD-BASED SYSTEMS 
WHICH MAKE POSSIBLE A FLEXIBLE RESPONSE STRATEGY. 
THE EUROPEANS ARE PLEASED THAT WASHINGTON AND 
MOSCOW HAVE FOUND NEW AREAS OF WIDER AGREEMENT--
PARTICULARLY IN STRATEGIC ARMS CONTROL; THAT THE US 
IS AGAIN FOCUSING ATTENTION ON EUROPE AND THAT WASH-
INGTON HAS FRANKLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WANTS A MORE 
MATURE ATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH THE PARTNERS ARE 
"MORE EQUAL." BUT THEY GREATLY FEAR THAT COMMON US-
SOVIET INTERESTS MAY COMPETE INCREASINGLY WITH THE

MUTUALITY OF US-EUROPEAN INTERESTS; THEY SPECULATE 
THAT MBFR AND SALT II MAY RESULT IN A DECOUPLING 
OF THE DETERRENT; THEY THINK THEY DETECT AN AMERICAN 
IMPATIENCE THAT WESTERN EUROPE DOES NOT SPEAK WITH 
ONE VOICE; AND SOME FEEL THAT OUR COMMERCIAL AND 
MONETARY DIFFERENCES HAVE CONVERTED ALLIES INTO 
ADVERSARIES. THE AMBIGUOUS RESPONSE WHICH WESTERN 
EUROPE HAS SO FAR GIVEN TO DR. KISSINGER'S 23 APRIL 
SPEECH AND TO THE PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL FOREIGN POLICY 
STATEMENT REFLECTS THESE SENSITIVITIES. 
AS WE PROCEED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THIS 
SUMMER TO WORK OUT THE OUTLINES OF A NEW ATLANTIC 
RELATIONSHIP--WHETHER IT IS CALLED A "CHARTER" OR 
SOMETHING ELSE--THE QUESTIONS OF DEADLINES AND EX-
PECTATIONS WILL BE CRITICAL. THE FACT OF THE MATTER 
IS THAT EUROPE MUST DO A GREAT DEAL IN A VERY SHORT 
TIME. IT MUST NEGOTIATE A NEW TRADING SYSTEM, CON-
TRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM, ADOPT A 
POSITION ON AN ACCEPTABLE REDUCTION OF FORCES IN 
CENTRAL EUROPE; COMMIT ITSELF TO DO MORE FOR ITS 
OWN DEFENSE OR, AT LEAST, TO DO IT BETTER; FIGURE 
OUT HOW TO LINK JAPAN TO THE ATLANTIC NATIONS; AND 
FINALLY, CREATE A NEW ATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP.

ALL THIS MEANS THAT WESTERN EUROPE MUST COMBINE 
ITS SELF-INTERESTS WITH SOME MEASURE OF APPRECIATION 
OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AS AN INCIPIENT WORLD POWER. 
BUT, SINCE THE CONSTITUENT MEMBERS OF EUROPE STILL 
HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO WORK OUT THEIR MUTUAL RELA-
TIONSHIPS, THE MOST THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IN THE NEAR 
FUTURE IS THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIAL EUROPEAN-
US RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BASED ON COMMON VITAL IN-
TERESTS. 
THE SOVIET UNION  
You HAVE NO DOUBT NOTICED HOW OFTEN THE SOVIET 
UNION HAS CROPPED UP IN WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A 
DISCUSSION OF WESTERN EUROPE. THIS IS, QUITE SIMPLY, 
A FACT OF OUR WORLD--THE RUSSIAN BEAR CASTS A LONG 
SHADOW, SO LET US LOOK AT THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, 
AND MILITARY SITUATION IN THE ONLY COUNTRY WHICH 
HAS EVER PUBLICLY THREATENED TO "BURY" THE UNITED 
STATES. 
THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP  
THE SOVIET POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IS STABLE; ITS 
RELATIONS WITH THE MILITARY HIERARCHY ARE GENERALLY 
GOOD. GENERAL SECRETARY BREZHNEV'S POSITION AS THE 
FIRST-AMONG-EQUALS HAS STRENGTHENED IN THE PAST TWO

YEARS, AND THE POLITBURO CHANGES ANNOUNCED BY THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON 27 APRIL INCREASED HIS AUTHOR-
ITY. HE IS UNLIKELY TO TRY TO SEIZE ALL THE REINS 
OF POWER, HOWEVER, LEST HIS COLLEAGUES BECOME RES-
TIVE AND CLOSE RANKS, AS THEY DID IN 1964 WHEN 
KHRUSHCHEV WAS OUSTED. 
THE INCLUSION OF DEFENSE MINISTER GRECHKO, FOR-
EIGN MINISTER GROMYKO, AND KGB CHIEF ANDROPOV IN THE 
POLITBURO, TOGETHER WITH THE OUSTER OF SHELEST, WAS 
INTENDED AS A SIGNAL THAT DETENTE AND COOPERATION 
WITH THE WEST COMMAND THE SUPPORT OF ALL MAJOR CON-
STITUENCIES IN THE USSR. BREZHNEV'S REPORT TO THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS ENDORSED BY 
EVERYONE WHO COUNTS IN THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP. MORE-
OVER, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE INSTRUCTED THE POLITBURO 
TO FORGE AHEAD, TO IMPLEMENT THE "PEACE PROGRAM" AND 
MAKE "IRREVERSIBLE" CHANGES IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
SITUATION. 
IN WASHINGTON LATER THIS MONTH BREZHNEV CAN BE 
EXPECTED TO PRESS FOR A MAJOR EXPANSION OF ECONOMIC 
AND TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION--JUST AS HE DID LAST 
MONTH IN BONN. HE RECENTLY URGED SEVERAL US SENATORS 
TO CAST ASIDE COLD WAR MISCONCEPTIONS AND SEEK AREAS 
OF COOPERATION. BUT HE STRESSED THAT THE "UNLIMITED

Approved For Release 2002/1gft*ttDP80R01731R002000090003-2 
POSSIBILITIES FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION" WOULD REQUIRE 
THE MOST SENSITIVE TYPE OF POLITICAL DECISION. IN 
THIS CONTEXT, HE HELD OUT THE LURE OF LARGE-SCALE 
DEALS INVOLVING THE EXCHANGE OF WESTERN CAPITAL AND 
TECHNOLOGY FOR SOVIET RAW MATERIALS. 
THIS PUSH FOR DETENTE REFLECTS THE KREMLIN'S 
ACCOMMODATION TO SOVIET DOMESTIC NEEDS, AND ITS AP-
PRECIATION OF THE CHANGING INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. 
IN BRIEF, THE USSR HAS NO SATISFACTORY ALTERNATIVE 
TO A WESTERN ORIENTATION. FACED WITH A DECLINING 
ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE WHILE THE EXPECTATIONS OF SOVIET 
SOCIETY ARE RISING, BREZHNEV HAS MADE A SERIES OF 
PRAGMATIC AND FUNDAMENTAL CHOICES, PRIMARILY ECONOMIC, 
THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REVERSE WITHOUT EXPOSING 
HIS LEADERSHIP TO DAMAGE THAT COULD BE GRAVE--AND 
POSSIBLY FATAL. 
THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SOVIETS WILL CEASE 
THEIR VIGOROUS COMPETITION WITH THE US FOR GLOBAL 
INFLUENCE AND PRESTIGE. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS NO 
SIGN OF LET-UP IN THEIR EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE OUR IN-
FLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST THROUGH DIPLOMATIC ACTION 
AND KGB OPERATIONS; NOR HAS THERE BEEN ANY INDICATION 
OF A DECLINE IN STRATEGIC WEAPONS PROGRAMS.

ASSUMING THAT THE LEADERSHIP REMAINS MORE OR 
LESS IN ITS PRESENT COLLECTIVE FORM, MAJOR POLICY 
SHIFTS SEEM UNLIKELY. BREZHNEV IS CAUTIOUS BY NATURE, 
f(koc,e,5 
AND IN ANY COLLECTIVEA)DEPARTURE FROM ESTABLISHED 
POLICY IS WRENCHING. IbECISIONS ARE BASED ON CON?
SENSUS--A PROCESS THAT MILITATES AGAINST DRAMATIC 
CHANGES. 
THIS APPLIES, TOO, TO DECISIONS INVOLVING THE 
MILITARY APPROPRIATIONS. No LEADER CAN RISK EXPOSING 
HIMSELF TO THE CHARGE THAT HE HAS NEGLECTED DEFENSE 
NEEDS--NEITHER CAN HE GIVE CARTE BLANCHE TO THE MILI?
TARY AND THE ARMS PRODUCERS. DEFENSE NEEDS MUST 
BALANCE OUT AGAINST OTHER PRIORITIES, AND ONE MILI?
TARY REQUIREMENT MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST ANOTHER. 
OCCASIONALLY THIS STRAINS RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PO?
LITICAL AND MILITARY LEADERS. 
GRECHKO'S ACCESSION TO THE POLITBURO NEED NOT 
MENACE DETENTE. IN THE SHORT TERM, IT MAY EVEN 
STRENGTHEN BREZHNEV'S HAND DOMESTICALLY ON MILITARY 
NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SALT AND MBFR BY REASSURING THE 
SOVIET PEOPLE THAT THE MILITARY SUPPORT HIS POLICY 
IN THIS AREA. IN THE LONGER TERM, HOWEVER, IT COULD 
MAKE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR THE USSR TO ACCEPT

CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AT SALT. THE MILITARY NOW HAS 
A VOTE, AND THIS CANNOT FAIL TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON 
THE TRADEOFFS BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND THE POLITBURO. 
THE_QUESTION OF THE ECONOMY  
IN DISCUSSING THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE 
SOVIET UNION, I HAVE SEVERAL TIMES MENTIONED ONE OF 
THE MOST TROUBLESOME PROBLEMS BESETTING THE POLITICAL 
LEADERS--THE ECONOMY. 
IN THE PAST MOSCOW HAS STRESSED ECONOMIC GROWTH 
AND INVESTMENT RATHER THAN CONSUMER GOODS. SINCE 
1960, HOWEVER, INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN YIELDING A 
STEADILY SMALLER RATE OF RETURN. GROWTH RATES FOR 
THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT HAVE DECREASED FROM OVER 
6 PERCENT ANNUALLY DURING 1951-60 TO LESS THAN 5.5 
PERCENT PER YEAR FOR 1961-70. PRODUCTION OF CON-
SUMER GOODS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS HAS BEEN SLOWLY 
GAINING IN PRIORITY. 
THIS DECADE WILL PROBABLY SEE AS MANY DISAP-
POINTMENTS AS DID THE '60s. THE 1971-75 PLAN GOT 
OFF TO AN INAUSPICIOUS START IN 1971-72. THE GROSS 
NATIONAL PRODUCT GREW BY AN AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF 
ONLY 3 PERCENT FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS, AND IN 1972 
GAINS IN BOTH THE GNP AND INDUSTRY WERE THE SMALLEST 
SINCE WORLD WAR II.

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, THAT MILITARY 
PROGRAMS ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS, THE GROWTH OF MILITARY SPENDING HAS PROB-
ABLY LEVELED OFF DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS, AS 
COMPLETION OF A NUMBER OF LARGE STRATEGIC DEPLOYMENT 
PROGRAMS HAS REDUCED SPENDING FOR MILITARY HARDWARE. 
THIS HAS BEEN OFFSET, HOWEVER, BY AN ACCELERATION 
IN THE RATE OF GROWTH OF SPENDING FOR MILITARY R&D. 
DURING 1973-75, MILITARY SPENDING PROBABLY WILL 
RESUME ITS GROWTH AS THE SOVIETS BEGIN TO MODERNIZE 
THEIR STRATEGIC FORCES AND AS MILITARY R&D CONTINUES 
TO BE EXPANDED ON THE ORDER OF 8-10 PERCENT PER YEAR, 
THE AVERAGE GROWTH RATE IN TOTAL MILITARY EXPENDI-
TURES WILL PROBABLY BE ABOUT 3 OR 4 PERCENT OVER 
THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WELL WITHIN THE CAPACITY OF THE 
DEFENSE INDUSTRIES AND THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL. 
SOVIET ADVANCED WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT  
LAST YEAR, AS YOU KNOW, THE US AND THE USSR 
SIGNED AND RATIFIED THE ABM TREATY AND THE INTERIM 
AGREEMENT ON STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE WEAPONS. ALTHOUGH 
THESE ACCORDS ESTABLISH NUMERICAL LIMITS ON DEPLOY-
MENT OF ABMs, ICBMs, AND SUBMARINE BALLISTIC MIS-

OF THESE WEAPON SYSTEMS. THERE IS, IN FACT, NO EVI-
DENCE THAT SALT HAS HAD ANY IMPORTANT EFFECT ON THE 
CURRENT SOVIET WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. EVEN 
BEFORE THE SIGNING, THE SOVIETS HAD BEGUN TO SHIFT 
RESOURCES FROM FURTHER DEPLOYMENT TO R&D PROGRAMS 
DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR FORCES. 
THERE ARE DOUBTLESS MANY DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS 
FOR THESE SOVIET R&D PROGRAMS. A SIMPLE DESIRE FOR 
SOME MEASURE OF STRATEGIC SUPERIORITY IS SURELY ONE 
FACTOR, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SOVIET UNION HAS FOR A 
LONG TIME SUFFERED FROM WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A MILI-
TARY INFERIORITY COMPLEX. ANOTHER MOTIVATION MAY BE 
A DETERMINATION TO CLOSE THE ACROSS-THE-BOARD TECH-
NOLOGY GAP BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND THE WEST IN 
GENERAL--AND THE UNITED STATES IN PARTICULAR--THAT 
HAS PLAGUED THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP FOR YEARS. PUBLIC 
LECTURERS IN MOSCOW ARE FREQUENTLY BADGERED BY CIT-

PULL OFF ANOTHER SIMILAR SPECTACULAR, AND EFFORTS 
TO ACHIEVE SOME SORT OF TECHNICAL BREAKTHROUGH ARE 
ALL THE MORE LIKELY NOW THAT SALT HAS PROHIBITED 
QUANTITATIVE INCREASES IN STRATEGIC WEAPONS. 
MOSCOW APPEARS SO FAR TO BE COMPLYING WITH THE 
LIMITATIONS ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF STRATEGIC WEAPONS. 
WE ARE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT THE NUMBER OF DEPLOYED 
ICBM LAUNCHERS HAS NOT INCREASED SINCE THE AGREEMENTS 
WERE SIGNED) THAT DEPLOYMENT OF ABMs IS STILL IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE ABM TREATY, AND THAT CONSTRUCTION 
OF BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINES, ALTHOUGH CONTINUING, 
IS WELL WITHIN THE SALT LIMITATIONS. 
ICBM DEVELOPMENT  
LET ME NOW DESCRIBE BRIEFLY SOME OF THE NEW 
WEAPONS UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOVIET UNION, 
AMONG THESE ARE AT LEAST THREE NEW ICBMs. 
ONE OF THESE NEW MISSILES IS LARGE--IN THE 
SS-9 CLASS--AND IT MAY CARRY A PAYLOAD SOMEWHAT 
HEAVIER THAN THAT OF THE PRESENT SS-9. WE BELIEVE 
THIS NEW LARGE MISSILE WILL EVENTUALLY BE EQUIPPED 
WITH A MIRV PAYLOAD, ALTHOUGH TO DATE THE SOVIETS 
HAVE TESTED IT ONLY WITH A SINGLE RE-ENTRY VEHICLE. 
IT COULD BE READY FOR DEPLOYMENT IN 1975.

TWO OTHER NEW MISSILES ARE SMALLER. ONE IS 
IN THE SS-11 CLASS, THE OTHER IS LIKE THE SS-13. 
BOTH COULD BE OPERATIONAL IN 1975. THEY, TOO, HAVE 
SO FAR BEEN TESTED ONLY WITH A SINGLE RE-ENTRY VE-
HICLE, BUT WE SEE NO REASON WHY THEY COULD NOT EVEN-
TUALLY BE EQUIPPED WITH MIRVs, 
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FEATURE OF TWO OF THESE 
NEW MISSILES IS THE INCORPORATION OF ON-BOARD COM-
PUTERS FOR A NAVIGATING GUIDANCE SYSTEM--A CLEAR 
DEPARTURE FROM EARLIER SOVIET GUIDANCE TECHNIQUES ? 
THE NEW GUIDANCE SYSTEMS WOULD PERMIT THE SOVIETS 
TO ACHIEVE BETTER TARGETING FLEXIBILITY AND THE 
MISSILES WOULD BE MORE READILY ADAPTABLE TO A MIRV 
SYSTEM. 
BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINES  
THE USSR IS CONTINUING ITS HIGH PRIORITY PRO-
GRAM TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND ITS ALREADY CONSIDERABLE 
FLEET OF BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINES, UNTIL LAST 
YEAR, THIS FORCE OF "MODERN BALLISTIC MISSILE SUB-
MARINES," AS IT IS REFERRED TO IN THE SALT AGREE-
MENT AND PROTOCOL, CONSISTED OF THE Y-CLASS SUB-
MARINES THAT THE SOVIETS BEGAN LAUNCHING IN 1966,

RESEMBLES THE Y-CLASS BOATS, BUT IS LONGER AND HAS 
A HIGHER MISSILE BAY AREA. WE CALL THIS NEW SUB-
MARINE THE D-CLASS. 
THE SOVIETS HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED A NEW AND 
LARGER NAVAL BALLISTIC MISSILE FOR DEPLOYMENT ON 
THE D-CLASS, WHICH HAS ONLY 12 LAUNCH TUBES IN COM-
PARISON WITH THE 16 ON THE Y-CLASS, 
WE BELIEVE THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR THE 
NEW MISSILE IS NOW COMPLETE--IN LATE 1972 IT FLEW 
SOME 4,300 NAUTICAL MILES. SUBMARINES ARMED WITH 
IT COULD BE WITHIN RANGE OF TARGETS IN THE US WHILE 
STILL IN HOME WATERS. 
THE SOVIETS ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING ABM DEVELOP-
MENT IN AREAS PERMITTED UNDER THE ABM TREATY, ES-
PECIALLY IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING SYSTEMS. ONE MIS-
SILE BEING DEVELOPED, FOR INSTANCE, IS BELIEVED TO 
HAVE A SLIGHTLY IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OVER THE GALOSH 
MISSILES DEPLOYED AROUND MOSCOW, AND THE RADARS 
USED WITH IT ARE LESS EXPENSIVE. THE SYSTEM, HOW-
EVER, PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST CUR-
RENT US STRATEGIC MISSILES, BUT--ESPECIALLY IF IT 
WERE READILY DEPLOYABLE--IT COULD BE VERY USEFUL IN 
DEALING WITH A LIMITED CHINESE MISSILE THREAT.

IN SUM, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SIGNING OF THE 
SALT AGREEMENTS HAS NOT SLOWED SOVIET EFFORTS TO 
DEVELOP NEW AND IMPROVED STRATEGIC WEAPONS, THERE 
IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE SOVIETS CONSIDER 
THEMSELVES TO BE IN A VERY SERIOUS COMPETITION WITH 
THE US, AND THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WEAPON SYS-
TEMS AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS A MAJOR PART OF 
THAT COMPETITION. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THEY ARE 
PURSUING THIS COMPETITION VIGOROUSLY. 
MIR& 
IF WE TURN NOW TO CHINA, WE FIND A MUCH LESS 
STABLE POLITICAL SITUATION, COUPLED (STRANGELY ENOUGH 
PERHAPS) WITH IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN ADVANCED WEAP-

INTERNAL POLITICS  
PEKING'S DETENTE WITH THE US IS PROGRESSING 
DESPITE THE UNRESOLVED INTERNAL POLITICAL SITUATION 
IN CHINA. 
THE FIRM AND DECISIVE DIRECTION THAT HAS GUIDED 
CHINESE DIPLOMACY IS LACKING IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.

IT COULD ALSO REACH PARTS OF ALASKA. ANOTHER, LARGER 
ICBM CAPABLE OF STRIKING TARGETS ANYWHERE IN THE US

WITHIN SUCH LIMITATIONS, THE SOVIETS WILL TRY 
TO EXPAND THEIR ASSETS IN THE AREA, WORKING PAR-
TICULARLY THROUGH IRAQ AND SOUTH YEMEN. THEY WILL 
AIM TO REDUCE WESTERN INFLUENCE AND PARTICULARLY 
TO OBSTRUCT THE CREATION OF WESTWARD-LOOKING GULF 
ALLIANCES THAT MIGHT BE INIMICAL TO SOVIET INTERESTS. 
THEY WILL ALSO WANT TO BLOCK INROADS FROM PEKING. 
INDOCHINA  
Now, IN CONCLUSION, LET US LOOK AT THE SITUA-
TION IN INDOCHINA. FOUR MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE 
THE SIGNING OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT, AND THE OUTLOOK 
FOR LASTING PEACE OR STABILITY IN THE AREA IS STILL 
UNCERTAIN. 
PROSPECTS IN VIETNAM  
IN VIETNAM, THE FIGHTING HAS SIMMERED DOWN, BUT 
THE COMMUNISTS HAVE BEEN REBUILDING THEIR MILITARY 
STRENGTH IN THE SOUTH SINCE THE CEASE-FIRE, THE 
RAINY SEASON WILL SOON BE IN FULL SWING EXCEPT ALONG 
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL COAST, THE RAINS WILL IN-
HIBIT COMMUNIST TROOP MOVEMENTS AND USE OF HEAVY 
EQUIPMENT IN MOST OF THE COUNTRY, BUT THEY WILL ALSO 
HAMPER SOUTH VIETNAMESE AIR OPERATIONS. EXCEPT IN 
NORTHERNMOST SOUTH VIETNAM, THE RAINS WILL SLOW THE 
INFILTRATION OF MEN AND SUPPLIES FROM NORTH VIETNAM.

ON BALANCE, THERE SEEMS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE THE 
COMMUNISTS WILL NOT TRY ANYTHING BIG BEFORE FALL, 
WHEN THE RAINS END. 
BUT WHAT THEN? RIGHT NOW, NO PROGRESS IS BEING 
MADE TOWARD ANY FINAL POLITICAL SETTLEMENT BY THE 
THIEU GOVERNMENT AND THE VIET CONG IN THEIR TALKS IN 
PARIS. WHILE SOME BREAKTHROUGH CANNOT BE RULED OUT, 
IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT EACH SIDE WILL GO ITS OWN WAY. 
THERE ARE TWO DANGERS IN THIS. ONE IS THAT THE 
CURRENT SMALL-SCALE FIGHTING MAY SLOWLY ESCALATE AND 
THE WAR MAY RESUME FULL-BLOWN, IF THIS HAPPENS, THE 
SITUATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE COMPLICATED. THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR CONTROL AND SUPERVISION 
IS NOT MUCH OF A RESTRAINING FACTOR, AND UNLESS THE 
US CAN DIG UP SOME SUCCESSOR FOR THE CANADIANS, IT 
MAY SIMPLY FALL APART BY MID-SUMMER. THE OTHER EN-
FORCING ORGANIZATION, THE JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION 
COMPRISED OF GVN AND VIET CONG DELEGATIONS, IS STILL 
INEFFECTIVE. 
CREEPING ESCALATION OF THE FIGHTING WOULD NOT 
NECESSARILY CONFRONT THE US WITH A DECISION WHETHER OR 
NOT TO INTERVENE, ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT THIEU PROBABLY 
WOULD REQUEST AIR SUPPORT IF GOVERNMENT FORCES BECOME 
HARD PRESSED. THE NEED FOR SUCH A DECISION COULD ARISE

QUITE SUDDENLY IF THE COMMUNISTS SHOULD RESUME THE WAR 
THROUGH AN ALL-OUT OFFENSIVE OR EVEN A SERIES OF CO-
ORDINATED MAJOR OPERATIONS. INDEED, SOME INTELLIGENCE 
ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT HANOI HAD SUCH ACTIONS IN MIND 
WHEN IT BROUGHT IN NEW TROOPS AND SUPPLIES DURING 
THIS WINTER'S DRY SEASON. UNDER THIS THESIS, WITH 
THE US MILITARY WITHDRAWAL ACCOMPLISHED, THE COMMU-
NISTS CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE THE CEASE-FIRE, AND THE 
POLITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE VIET CONIG4ttlETVVEerTaM 
LITTLE OTHER ALTERNATIVE, 
SHOULD THE WAR RESUME SOON, SAIGON WOULD STILL 
HAVE A CLEAR ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF GROUND COMBAT 
TROOPS--ABOUT 287,000 AGAINST 17,000?BUT THE COM-
MUNISTS MAY HAVE A SLIGHT EDGE IN FIREPOWER. THE 
COMMUNISTS HAVE STOCKPILED ENOUGH SUPPLIES FOR ABOUT 
SIX MONTHS' HEAVY FIGHTING, 
THE COMMUNISTS, HOWEVER, MAY WISH TO HUSBAND 
THEIR ASSETS FOR SOME TIME IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A 
STRONG RIVAL PRESENCE IN SOUTH VIETNAM, THEIR IN-
TENSIVE RESUPPLY AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY MAY 
BE POINTED TOWARD CREATING A SECURE MILITARY ENCLAVE 
FROM THE DMZ ALMOST TO THE DELTA, THEY COULD MAKE 
OTHER MOVES, ALL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE PARIS 
AGREEMENT, TO TRY TO DEVELOP A FUNCTIONING ADMINIS-
TRATION IN THIS AREA. THEY WOULD HOPE THAT THIS

VIRTUAL EXTENSION OF THE DRV ALONG SOUTH VIETNAM'S 
WESTERN BORDER WOULD GRADUALLY FORCE SAIGON TO ACCEPT 
THEIR POLITICAL TERMS, IT WOULD ALSO PUT THEM IN A 
STRONG POSITION TO FIGHT AGAIN, IF NECESSARY, 
LAOS  
THE CEASE-FIRE IN LAOS, ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS 
FLAWLESS, IS HOLDING BETTER THAN IN VIETNAM, BUT THE 
COMMUNISTS ARE STALLING IN THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS, 
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRIME MINISTER SOUVANNA IN 
VIENTIANE APPARENTLY IS PREPARED TO SHARE POWER WITH 
THE PATHET LAO, AN EVENTUAL COALITION GOVERNMENT IN 
LAOS SEEMS A PRETTY GOOD BET, BUT WHETHER IT WILL 
WORK ANY BETTER THIS TIME THAN BEFORE--OR WHETHER 
IT WILL LAST--IS QUESTIONABLE, MORE TO THE POINT, 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT NORTH VIETNAM IS PULLING 
OUT ANY OF ITS 85,000 TROOPS, WITH NO US BOMBING 
AND WITH THE CEASE-FIRE, THE COMMUNISTS SHOULD NOT 
NEED ALL THESE TROOPS, BUT THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY 
INTEND TO KEEP ROADS IN THE LAO PANHANDLE OPEN, 
THEY ARE CREATING A NEW NORTH-SOUTH ROAD SYSTEM 
ON THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE SIDE THAT COULD IN TIME 
OBVIATE THE NEED FOR THE LAOS COMPLEX, AND ALLOW 
SOME FORCES THERE TO GO HOME, THUS, LAOS COULD

PROBABLY GET OFF THE BURNER IF THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE 
AND CAMBODIAN SITUATIONS WOULD SO ALLOW. 
CAMBODIA  
IN CAMBODIA, THERE IS STILL NO CEASE-FIRE. 
KHMER COMMUNIST TROOPS, WITH SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE 
FROM THE NORTH VIETNAMESE, HAVE INCREASED PRESSURE 
ON THE GOVERNMENT'S OVERLAND LIFELINES TO PHNOM 
PENH-- INCLUDING THE MEKONG R I VER--AND ARE OPERATING 
CLOSE TO THE CAPITAL'S OUTSKIRTS. THE LON NOL GOV-
ERNMENT IN PHNOM PENH IS SHAKY, AND THE MORALE AND 
PERFORMANCE OF ITS ARMY ARE POOR. US AIR STRIKES 
HAVE BEEN KEEPING THE COMMUNISTS FROM SCORING MAJOR 
LOCAL VICTORIES. 
A RECENT BROADENING OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS BROUGHT 
BACK SOME MEN OF TALENT, BUT HOW LONG THEY WI LL BE ABLE 
TO PULL TOGETHER IS QUESTIONABLE. THEY HAVE NOT 
ACCOMPLISHED MUCH SO FAR. IF,HOWEVER, THEY CAN GET 
THE CAMBODIAN ARMY BETTER LEADERSHIP AND OTHER FORMS 
OF ESSENTIAL SUPPORT, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO RESIST THE CURRENT COMMUNIST PRESSURE THROUGH THE 
REST OF THE YEAR. ITS SURVIVAL COULD, THEN, INDUCE 
HANOI AND THE KHMER COMMUNISTS TO OPT FOR A CEASE-
FIRE IN CAMBODIA--WHICH WOULD INCLUDE AN END TO US 
BOMB I NG--FOLLOWED BY SOME KIND OF NEGOTIATIONS.

As THINGS STAND NOW, THE COMMUNISTS WOULD BE 
BARGAINING FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. IF THEY 
ENTERED A COALITION GOVERNMENT, THEY PROBABLY WOULD 
SOON COME TO DOMINATE IT. THIS COULD IN TIME OPEN 
THE WAY TO SHIPPING IN HEAVY MILITARY EQUIPMENT 
THROUGH THE SEAPORT OF KOMPONG SUM AND COMMUNIST 
ACCESS TO THE COUNTRY'S AIRFIELDS. EXTENSIVE NORTH 
VIETNAMESE USE OF CAMBODIA COULD HAVE CONSIDERABLE 
IMPACT ON THE CAPABILITIES OF COMMUNIST FORCES IN 
SOUTH VIETNAM, AND ON SAIGON'S WILL TO RESIST, 
THE GREAT POWER FACTOR  
IN ANY OF THESE EQUATIONS, ACTIONS OF THE US MAY 
OR MAY NOT EXERT A RESTRAINING INFLUENCE ON HANOI. 
OTHER FACTORS WILL ALSO BE AT WORK. ONE IS THE 
EXTENT TO WHICH NORTH VIETNAM CAN COUNT ON ADDI-
TIONAL, AND INDEFINITE, MILITARY SUPPORT FROM ITS 
COMMUNIST ALLIES--PRIMARILY THE USSR AND CHINA--
FOR MILITARY ADVENTURES IN THE REST OF INDOCHINA. 
THESE ARE QUESTIONS AND FACTORS ABOUT WHICH OPINIONS 
DIFFER WIDELY AND EVIDENCE IS SPARSE, BUT THEY COULD 
WELL BE A KEY TO WHETHER OR NOT INDOCHINA SOON 
SETTLES DOWN.
